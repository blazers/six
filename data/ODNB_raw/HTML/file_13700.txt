<span class="headword">Hookes,  Nicholas</span>  (1632&#150;1712), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born in London, the son of Thomas Hookes of London. He was a king's scholar at Westminster School under Richard Busby. He was elected to a scholarship at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1649; his tutor was Alexander Akehurst and he took his BA degree in 1653.<br>
<br>In his graduation year Hookes published <span class="italic">Amanda, a sacrifice to an unknown goddesse, or, A free-will offering of a lovinge heart to a sweet-heart</span>, dedicated to Edward Montagu, a fellow <i>alumnus</i> of Westminster School and an undergraduate at Sidney Sussex College, the son of Lord Montagu of Boughton. There are commendatory verses by Richard Moyle, Charles Ireton, and Thomas Adams, all of Trinity College, and Matthew Palmer of the Middle Temple. The last three had attended Westminster School. Hookes attempted to secure the attention of two potential patrons; in addition to Edward Montagu he addressed a pair of poems to Sir Thomas Leventhorp, an undergraduate at Christ's College (54&#150;6, 81&#150;3). In the same year as <span class="italic">Amanda</span>, Hookes also published <span class="italic">Miscellanea poetica</span>; they are usually found bound together. The latter volume mainly consists of Cambridge elegies in Latin. Most of <span class="italic">Amanda</span> consists of verses on various occasions addressed to an imaginary mistress. For the most part they are unexceptional exercises in the amatory Cavalier mode, varied with moments of idiosyncrasy, such as the lines from &#145;To Amanda Going to Bed&#146;:<blockquote>
<div>Make me thy maiden-chamber-man,<br>
</div>
<div>Or let me be thy warming-pan<br>
</div>
<div>&hellip; Then i'th morning ere I rose<br>
</div>
<div>I'd kisse thy pretty pettitoes.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>However, the very act of publishing verses in this overtly royalist style was potentially very provocative in the 1650s.Hookes's bids for patronage and college preferment (the ostensible aim of <span class="italic">Miscellanea poetica</span>) were unsuccessful, and after his <i>annus mirabilis</i> of 1653, nothing more is known of him until his death almost sixty years later. He died in Lambeth on 7 November 1712 and was buried in St Mary's, Lambeth, on the south side of the north aisle. A Latin inscription describes him as &#145;virum qui summam dubiis probitatem sincera in Deum pietate, spectata in utrumque Carolum fide, eximia in omnes charitate, moribus suavissimis et limatissimo ingenio, omnibus elegantioris literaturae ornamentis exculto, mire adornavit&#146; (&#145;a man who wonderfully adorned his age in sincere piety towards God, in the greatest probity towards men, in outstanding loyalty to both Charleses, in exceptional charity towards all, by the great elegance of his wit and his great cultivation in all things that adorn the <i>belles-lettres</i>&#146;). The phrasing of the epitaph suggests that he must have died in comfortable circumstances. Hookes's wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1692?), was buried in the same grave, as were other family members.<br>
