<span class="headword">Parkinson, Sir  Albert Lindsay</span>  (1870&#150;1936), <span class="occ">builder and contractor</span>, was born on 24 February 1870 at Hastings Place, Lytham, Lancashire, the second of the four sons in the family of seven children of Jacob Parkinson (<i>d</i>. 1902), joiner, and his wife, Mary Anne Hall, who later ran a boarding-house in Blackpool. He left school at fourteen to join his elder brother working with their father, who had moved the family to Blackpool in 1873, and had built up a joinery business, registered as Jacob Parkinson &amp; Co. in 1877, working from a small shed in Central Drive, Blackpool. As the business expanded into the building trade, the Parkinsons built a sawmill and joinery works to supply timber for their projects, and moved into the new premises in Kent Road in 1896, the year in which Albert Parkinson took control of the company. After the death of Jacob Parkinson in 1902, it became a limited company, with Albert Parkinson as managing director.<br>
<br>With his brother William in charge of the day-to-day running of the business, Parkinson soon established a reputation for getting things done quickly and on time. Taking advantage of the rapid development of Blackpool as a holiday resort, he built the Talbot Hotel in seven weeks, and after he had built the Theatre Royal, Newcastle upon Tyne, in six months, the company won contracts for more theatres, including the Princes Theatre in London, also built in six months, in 1905, and the interior of the Lyceum. He also built several roller-skating rinks, including one in Paris. He opened offices in Newcastle in 1902, and London in 1905, and in 1911 won his first major contract, to build the new asylum at Whalley for Lancashire county council, completed in 1914 at a cost of &pound;1 million. In 1905 the company built the Blackpool racecourse, the first time it had used reinforced concrete in construction. Parkinson's first wife, whose name is not known, died about 1908 and on 21 February 1911 he married his second wife, Margaret (<i>b</i>. 1886/7), daughter of Jackson Robert Singleton, a corporation official and one of Parkinson's partners. He had three sons from his first marriage and one from his second.<br>
<br>During the First World War the Blackpool works supplied shell boxes and joinery for the war department, while Parkinson won contracts to build two aerodromes in 1916 and 1917, and to extend others. During the war he developed the Parkinson&#150;Kahn reinforced concrete house, which he used in several large housing estates in Lancashire and other parts of the north in the 1920s. The firm also built office blocks in London, including Aldwych House (1920&#150;21); the Poland Street garage (1924), the first in Britain to be built with a circular ramp; cinemas such as the Odeon, Temple Fortune, London (1929); the Miners' House in Blackpool (1924&#150;7); the Collegiate School for Girls, Blackpool (1928); and Oddendino's Hotel, Regent Street, London (1927&#150;8). As well as a number of industrial buildings such as the new fish dock in Grimsby (1930&#150;34), the firm undertook road-building contracts, including a section of Western Avenue in London (1929&#150;33), the Barnet by-pass (1928&#150;9), and, most importantly, the Liverpool and East Lancashire Road (1929&#150;33), 25 miles of arterial road between Liverpool and Manchester, the largest new road project ever undertaken in Britain. Government contracts included new RAF aerodromes at Bicester and Heyford (1926&#150;7) and the headquarters of the Royal Corps of Signals at Aldershot. At the same time Parkinson bought several local businesses in Blackpool, including Louis Tussaud's waxworks, and expanded into the ownership of breweries and hotels elsewhere. In 1927 he split the company into two, separating the building and contracting side of the business from the property management side.<br>
<br>Although the headquarters of the company was in London, Parkinson remained closely involved in local activities in Blackpool. A member of the town council from 1905 to 1919, he was mayor of Blackpool from 1916 to 1919, and served as MP for Blackpool from 1918 to 1922, as a coalition Unionist. After he was knighted in 1922, he changed the name of the company to Sir Lindsay Parkinson &amp; Co. Ltd. He declined a baronetcy in 1934.<br>
<br>Parkinson claimed to be the first person in Blackpool to own a private motor car, and his interest in flying led him to organize the country's first aviation meeting in Blackpool in 1909. A keen sportsman, he played for the South Shore Football Club in 1885, and later for Blackburn Rovers as an amateur, and had several offers from league clubs to turn professional. He also played cricket for Blackpool from 1890, and for a number of years took a team to Ireland. In 1924 he and his brother William gave Blackpool a cricket ground and pavilion which later became the county ground, and at his death he was chairman of the Blackpool United Football Club and president of the cricket club. In the 1920s he became a successful greyhound owner, and from 1929 a less successful racehorse owner. He also built up a large art collection, which included the Romanov imperial Russian art collection.<br>
<br>Sir Lindsay Parkinson died on 3 February 1936 at his home, Royal Bank, Preston Old Road, Marton, Blackpool, and was buried in Marton cemetery on 8 February. He was survived by his wife. He had transformed a small local business into a major national company, but after the Second World War it lost its leading role in the building industry, and was sold in the early 1970s.<br>
