<span class="headword">Perkins,  Francis Arthur <span class="st"> [Frank]</span></span>  (1889&#150;1967), <span class="occ">diesel engine manufacturer</span>, was born on 26 February 1889 at Clifton Villa, Park Road, Peterborough, Northamptonshire, the second of the three sons of John Edward S. Perkins, who became managing director of Barford and Perkins Ltd, makers of agricultural machinery, and his wife, Margaret Charlotte, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Long. He was educated at Lindley Lodge preparatory school (1899&#150;1902), Rugby School (1902&#150;4), and Gresham's School, Holt (1904&#150;7), and went up to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1907, leaving with a pass degree in mechanical engineering in 1910.<br>
<br>A career in agriculture was always likely, given his background, and Perkins initially rented a farm in Hertfordshire. On the outbreak of the First World War he volunteered, and was commissioned in the army, serving in the 34th divisional company of the Royal Engineers in the Dardanelles, Palestine, and Egypt. In 1915 Perkins, who was commonly known as Frank, married Susan Gwynneth Gee, daughter of Hugh Roberts Williams, a government inspector. They had one son and three daughters. Perkins was demobilized in 1918 with the rank of major and worked for Lawes Chemicals Ltd before joining the family firm at the Queen Street ironworks in Peterborough.<br>
<br>Barford and Perkins was one of fourteen firms to join the Agricultural and General Engineers (AGE) group, a holding company formed in 1919 on the initiative of Thomas Aveling and Frank Garrett to enable leading British manufacturers of agricultural machinery to compete against American rivals in the world market by rationalizing production and centralizing sales. In the 1920s Barford and Perkins was developing roadrollers powered by petrol engines, and in 1928 Perkins moved to the leading British manufacturer of steamrollers and steam traction engines, Aveling and Porter Ltd of Rochester, another AGE member, as works director and vice-chairman; in the same year the two companies formed a joint roller manufacturing company. Perkins became involved in the development of a four-cylinder high-speed diesel engine to power agricultural tractors made by Garretts of Leiston, also a member of AGE. A Garrett tractor, with an Aveling and Porter Invicta diesel engine, was exhibited at the Smithfield Show and at the World Tractor Trials in Wallingford in 1930, and in 1931 it broke the world non-stop ploughing record in a ploughing marathon organized by the Oxford University Institute of Agricultural Engineering, ploughing for 977 hours. But the project was halted in 1932 when AGE went bankrupt and was disbanded and its companies were sold off individually.<br>
<br>Aveling and Porter and Barford and Perkins were sold together, and a new firm of Aveling and Barford Ltd began manufacturing at Grantham. Perkins bought the development and production rights on the Invicta engine and started his own company, F. Perkins Ltd, to continue the development of a lightweight high-speed diesel engine at the Queen Street works in Peterborough, which had closed at the end of 1931 but which still belonged to his father. With Charles Chapman, former head of engineering at Aveling and Porter, as chief engineer, and three former employees of Aveling and Porter, he was testing the first Perkins engine, the four-cylinder Vixen, by the end of 1932. This became the Wolf series, and was accepted by Commer Cars Ltd at the end of 1933 to power Commer trucks.<br>
<br>Perkins drove from Peterborough to Perth in a Hillman Wizard fitted with a Perkins Fox engine, at a fuel cost of one-eighth of a penny per mile, in 1933, and from Helsinki to Moscow in 1934, and in 1935 a racing car fitted with a Wolf engine broke or set six world records for diesel at the Brooklands circuit. However, the main demand for diesel engines at this point was for commercial vehicles. Diesel engines were not only cheaper to run, but they could cope with heavier loads than their petrol equivalents, and the firm converted many trucks and vans from petrol to diesel for its customers. It was five years before the company started to make a profit, following the success of the first six-cylinder diesel engine, the P6, which came on to the market in 1937, and could be used to power boats, trucks, vans, and industrial machinery. Sales rose from &pound;7006 in 1933 to &pound;206,320 in 1939. Shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War, the Air Ministry commissioned F. Perkins Ltd to provide engines for air&#150;sea rescue launches, and during the war these made up the bulk of the company's production.<br>
<br>After the war the world demand for diesel tractors and commercial vehicles grew, and the Perkins P6 became the most popular engine, with customers including Ford UK and Massey-Harris of Canada. The company moved to a new factory at Eastfield, outside Peterborough, in 1947, and turnover grew from &pound;1.25 million in 1946 to &pound;9.35 million in 1951. In 1951 F. Perkins Ltd launched itself as a public company. Although it continued to expand during the 1950s, with overseas plants and sales and service outlets in France, Spain, India, and Brazil, and a turnover in 1956 of &pound;21.5 million, problems were developing. Customers began to think about manufacturing their own engines rather than buying from Perkins, and at the same time competitors were producing lighter-weight, more economical engines.<br>
<br>Too late, Perkins put more money and time into research and development rather than being content with the success of the P6, but the new design, the R6, was developed too quickly and was not properly tested, leaving dissatisfied customers. Following the closure of the Suez Canal in 1956 and the subsequent loss of markets in India and the Far East, the value of sales fell by a third in 1957, and for the first time Perkins incurred losses, of &pound;319,000. Following a report prepared by Perkins's deputy, Monty Prichard, which recommended amalgamation as the only way forward, a deal was made with Massey-Ferguson, one of its biggest customers, at the beginning of 1959. Massey-Ferguson bought all the shares in F. Perkins Ltd, which became a subsidiary and continued to produce engines in Peterborough. Production grew from 77,000 engines a year in 1959 to 250,000 in 1963. Perkins remained as chairman until 1962, when he was elected honorary president.<br>
<br>In 1961 Perkins's first wife died, and in 1965 he married a widow, Maud V. Dixon, daughter of Robert L. Andrews, a retired army captain. Perkins's interests&#151;shooting, fishing, and sailing&#151;were those of a country gentleman, and he owned and managed a small arable farm. He was president of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (1956&#150;7), high sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire (1956&#150;7), and president of the Peterborough Agricultural Society from 1961, and was made an honorary freeman of the City of Peterborough in 1962. Perkins died on 15 October 1967 at his home, Alwalton Hall, near Peterborough.<br>
