<span class="headword">McAlpine,  Alfred James <span class="st"> [Jimmie]</span></span>  (1908&#150;1991), <span class="occ">contractor and businessman</span>, was born on 15 June 1908 at Lindisfarne, Lundin Links, Fife, the eldest of three children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47882/', "Sir Alfred David McAlpine (1881&#150;1944)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49301/', "McAlpine family")</script>], contractor, and his wife, Ethel May Williams (1887&#150;1961), daughter of James Williams of Aboyne, Aberdeen. His father was the fourth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40244/', "Sir Robert McAlpine (1847&#150;1934)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49301/', "McAlpine family")</script>], the founder of Sir Robert McAlpine &amp; Sons; Alfred David McAlpine was a partner in the firm. The family moved from Scotland in 1911 and took up residence in Glan Ceirw, Cerrigydrudion (Merioneth), after the birth of the second child, Gladys Gwendoline (1910&#150;1978); McAlpine's father had been made partner in charge of the construction of the Alwen dam and reservoir in north Wales. The third child, Ethel Mary (1915&#150;1989), was born at Glan Ceirw, and in 1918 the McAlpines moved again, to Marchwiel Hall, near Wrexham. Sir Alfred and Lady McAlpine eventually bought the property, and lived there until their deaths; it was then inherited by Ethel Mary, who lived there with her husband, Peter Henry Bell (1911&#150;1977).<br>
<br>McAlpine was educated at Sandroyd preparatory school (1919&#150;22) in Cobham, Surrey, and then at Repton School (1922&#150;6). There he was a member of Orchard House and a keen cricketer, playing for the first eleven in 1926. He then enrolled at Pembroke College, Cambridge, but did not graduate, and in 1928 he took up employment with Sir Robert McAlpines at its site on the Great West Road at Brentford, Middlesex&#151;the Firestone Tyre and Rubber Co. Ltd. He was employed as a timekeeper. It was quite normal for the young members of the McAlpine family at that time, and subsequently, to take up very junior positions on company construction sites, which reflected the founder's view that potential partners needed the knowledge that site works gave them so that they had an improved understanding of their ultimate management roles within the company. McAlpine worked on a number of sites during the late 1920s and 1930s, when there were financial difficulties within the construction industry brought on by the depression. There was a general lack of work even though the company managed to secure contracts in the north-west and midlands, where his father was mostly involved, but in 1930 the company established a subsidiary company and opened offices in Manchester. McAlpine's father was made chairman of this company, which was styled Sir Robert McAlpine &amp; Sons (Midlands) Ltd and secured work for, among others, Bowater and the Manchester Ship Canal Company, and its largest contract was the construction of the Birkenhead section of the Mersey Tunnel.<br>
<br>After the death of Sir Robert McAlpine in 1934 and the death of his eldest son in the same year, owing to the continued worldwide depression the partners decided to close their midland subsidiary and invited Sir Alfred (knighted in 1931) and his son, Jimmie, to move to the south-east, where it was considered there were better work opportunities. This offer was refused, for by now the McAlpine family were settled in north Wales and had become important members of the social, political, and sporting communities. Father and son therefore decided to take their chances with their subsidiary business and gave up all interests in the parent company. This severance took place in 1935, and in 1940 the &#145;Midlands&#146; name was transferred back to the parent company and the new company of Sir Alfred McAlpine &amp; Son was formed, with Jimmie McAlpine as vice-chairman. He became chairman on the death of his father in 1944 and held this position until retirement in 1985, when he became life president and when his surviving son, Robert James McAlpine, became chairman.<br>
<br>McAlpine married five times. He first married, on 24 June 1931, Peggy Barbara Sanders (1910/11&#150;1986), daughter of John Ernest Sanders, an exporter. There were two sons: Robert James (<i>b</i>. 1932) and Alfred William (1935&#150;1962). McAlpine's second marriage was to Mary Kinder Read (1916&#150;1993), daughter of Frank Hargrave Read, manager of a shipping company, on 1 April 1940. There was one daughter, Valerie Anne (<i>b</i>. 1942). McAlpine married thirdly Rosemary Lavery (1913&#150;1983), divorced wife of James Harold Lavery, and daughter of Charles Hugh Gregory-Hood, army officer, on 17 September 1951. Again there was one daughter, Sally Dorothy (<i>b</i>. 1952). McAlpine's fourth marriage, on 27 October 1959, was to Eleanor Margaret Wallace (<i>b</i>. 1932/3), daughter of John Nicholson Wallace, merchant. There were no children of this marriage, which, like its three predecessors, ended in divorce. McAlpine married finally, on 31 October 1979, Cynthia Greenaway (<i>b</i>. 1941), daughter of Harry Whitney, a master baker. McAlpine's residence from 1931 to 1939 was at Barnfelde, Burton Road, Rossett, near Wrexham; next he moved to Tickwood Hall, Much Wenlock, Shropshire. From 1958 until his death he lived at Gerwyn Hall, Marchwiel, near Wrexham.<br>
<br>McAlpine often remarked that it was the war that had put the company onto a firm financial footing and that he had been lucky to have taken over when he did. He was, however, also quick to acknowledge that the senior staff he took with him when the companies split were an important, if not the most important, factor in the successful growth of the company. McAlpine's lack of technical training and the fact that his father ran the business autocratically could easily have isolated him from his senior staff, but he performed his role as chairman with a light hand on the tiller, suiting his temperament and training. All but one of the managers who transferred to the new firm with McAlpine remained with him until their retirement, which provides some indication of the loyalty engendered by McAlpine and the family name.<br>
<br>Post-war construction&#151;airfields, opencast coal production, power stations, industrial building&#151;kept the company busy during the 1950s. At the end of the decade, motorways&#151;which were to carry the company through until McAlpine's death&#151;were just beginning to feature; the company built these first in the Belfast region, and then, in 1961, it constructed 26 miles of the M6 between Warrington and Preston, Lancashire. McAlpine had distinct reservations about tackling a job of this size and it is well recorded that he worried that this contract, almost equal in value to the annual turnover of the company at that time, was a risk which could prove, in the business sense, fatal. His early work experience during the depression had made him extremely cautious and throughout his forty years as chairman he insisted that the company maintain a high level of liquidity, having substantial cash reserves and minimum borrowings. Fortunately the job was successful and this gave McAlpine confidence to allow the company to develop further motorway teams. Indeed, within his lifetime McAlpine saw the company become the country's leading motorway builder. His love of large civil-engineering projects was never in doubt, as was his rather dismissive attitude to other sectors of the construction industry. He was fortunate that while he was chairman sufficient civil-engineering work became available for the company, keeping the business not only viable but also highly successful.<br>
<br>Since leaving school McAlpine had maintained his interest in all sports and in particular cricket. During the seasons of 1930 and 1931 he captained Denbighshire County Cricket Club, then a member of the Minor Counties League, and he also played for the Free Foresters. He was a lifelong supporter of the game, a member of the I Zingari and the Northern Nomads, and, most importantly, an enthusiastic sponsor of his local village team, Marchwiel, and of the many cricket festivals organized at Marchwiel Hall. He was a lover of the five-day game and liked nothing better than watching Geoff Boycott craft&#151;albeit sometimes slowly&#151;one of his many centuries. He expressed the view that one-day cricket was well and good but that &#145;proper cricket&#146; was the game he most enjoyed. He was a keen golfer all his life, though he regarded golf as a mere game.<br>
<br>McAlpine was part of an industry which was well known for its characters and he was undoubtedly one of them, but throughout his working life he kept very much out of the industry limelight and was little known outside the company. He was a shy man who shunned publicity except within his own company, where he was known by everyone by the slightly feudal title of Mr Jimmie. It was part of the received wisdom within the company that he was able to pick the right person for the job, but indeed it is more likely that he had a complete trust in the abilities of his senior managers to engage competent staff. He did, however, have the skill to engender an almost childlike loyalty to him, as the clan leader, and to the company. This loyalty extended to his workforce, whom he insisted on talking to and encouraging every time he visited the sites, which he did regularly until a short time before his death. He was aware that this patriarchal role was one which he could do with ease and which was of substantial importance: his actions bound together his directors, staff, and workers in a way which was, even then, quite unusual for a chairman of a multi-million pound business. He was always relaxed and very much at ease with his staff and was genuinely pleased to share their leisure time. He talked to them in language they understood and in ways that made them feel valued, praising their qualities rather than criticizing their faults, and taking a broad and tolerant view of their mistakes.<br>
<br>McAlpine died of heart failure at Macelor Hospital, Wrexham, on 6 November 1991, and was buried later in the month in St Garmon's churchyard, Llanarmon Dyffryn Ceiriog, an area he loved and where for many years he had enjoyed shooting. His grave is alongside that of his younger son, who was killed in a car crash in 1962. He was survived by his fourth and fifth wives, and by three of his children.<br>
