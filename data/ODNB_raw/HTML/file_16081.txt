<span class="headword">&Agrave; Lasco <span class="st"> [Laski]</span>,  John</span>  (1499&#150;1560), <span class="occ">evangelical reformer</span>, was born in Lask, Poland, the second of three sons and brother to four daughters of Jarslov Laski (<i>d</i>. 1521?), voivode of Sieradz, and Susanna Bak (<i>fl</i>. 1484&#150;1510), daughter of the Bakova-Gora councilman Zbigniew Bak. His birth coincided with a rise in the family's fortune. His uncle Jan Laski (<i>d</i>. 1531) rose quickly in the ranks of the Polish nobility, becoming royal secretary, chancellor, and finally, in 1510, archbishop of Gnesen and primate of the Polish Roman Catholic church. In that same year Jan Laski brought his three nephews to Cracow to provide for their education.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>In March 1513 the primate travelled to Rome to participate in the fifth Lateran Council. His two older nephews, Jerome and John, accompanied him on this journey, and were joined the following year by their youngest brother, Stanislaw. While the primate engaged in ecclesiastical and diplomatic discussions, the three young men continued their education under the watchful eye of their tutor, Jan Branicki. Early in 1515 they took up residence in Bologna, along with other Polish students. They pursued a private course of study, focusing on Latin, Italian, ecclesiastical law, and history. Apparently they were not enrolled in the university. According to his tutor, John was an exemplary student, &#145;in whom there is virtue that I have before never seen in a boy&#146;  (Dalton, 63). While in Bologna, &agrave; Lasco became acquainted with Reginald Pole, who later led the Catholic reformation in England. He just missed the German humanist Ulrich von Hutten, who probably left Bologna a few months before &agrave; Lasco's arrival.<br>
<br>In 1518 &agrave; Lasco moved to Padua, where for a short time he took on a diplomatic role as counsellor for the Polish nation. In March 1519 he went back to Poland. At some point during this period, &agrave; Lasco suffered the embarrassment of excommunication when his cousin defaulted on a loan that he had secured with John's name. The archbishop, however, made good the debt, and John was reconciled with the church. Meanwhile the primate had begun to advance the career of his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, who on 30 November 1517 was summarily named custodian of Leczyca, a canon of Plock, and coadjutor to the deacon of Gnesen. The following month he became deacon of Gnesen, and in May 1518 was appointed a canon of Cracow. In 1521 he was ordained to the priesthood, appointed dean of Gnesen, and named royal secretary. In 1525 he became provost of Leczyca, that is, head of the cathedral chapter, and in the following year was appointed to the same office for Gnesen.<br>
<br>In 1524 &agrave; Lasco accompanied his older brother, Jerome, on a diplomatic mission to France. Jerome had been introduced earlier to the French court during his student days in Bologna. <i>En route</i> they stopped briefly in Basel, where &agrave; Lasco first met Erasmus. He was immediately drawn to the humanist and would later return for a more extended visit. The brothers pushed on to Paris where &agrave; Lasco met some of the leading French humanists, including Marguerite de Valois, sister of Fran&ccedil;ois I, and Faber Staupulenses (Lef&egrave;vre d'&Eacute;taples). He may also have attended lectures at the Sorbonne.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1525 &agrave; Lasco returned to Basel, where he lodged with Erasmus in quarters provided by the publisher Johann Froben. During his stay he also met Beatus Rhenanus, the publisher Oporin, Heinrich Glarenius, Zwingli, Guillaume Farel, and Conrad Pellican, with the last of whom he briefly studied Hebrew. Funds supplied from Poland supported Erasmus's household during this period. &Agrave; Lasco even purchased the master's library for 300 gulden, allowing Erasmus to use it until his death. Later Erasmus tried to terminate the agreement when &agrave; Lasco failed to make a second payment on time, and the dispute continued until Erasmus's death in 1536. Then in the following spring &agrave; Lasco made a final payment to the executor of Erasmus's estate through his messenger, Boniface Amerbach. He began to receive books in April 1537, but eventually sold most of them and virtually dissolved the collection.<h2>
<a name="Politicalengagements"></a>Political engagements</h2>In June 1525 the primate, Jan Laski, summoned &agrave; Lasco back to Poland by way of Italy. John spent a few months in Padua and Venice, where he called upon the doge, Andrea Gritti, who would later be an important diplomatic ally. Then, after requesting additional funds from Poland, he continued his trip home, arriving in Poznan in April 1526. He spent the next several years immersed in the affairs of Poland's political and ecclesiastical hierarchy, while lamenting the loss of his student days in Basel.<br>
<br>From 1527 the Laski family was plunged into a complicated and ominous political intrigue. After the death of Lajos II Jagiellon in 1526, a bitter dispute arose over succession to the Hungarian throne. Ferdinand von Habsburg was perhaps the strongest contender, but J&aacute;nos Z&aacute;polya was the local favourite. Jerome &agrave; Lasco secretly committed himself and his family to Z&aacute;polya's cause, continuing the anti-Habsburg policies of his uncle. Meanwhile the Polish king remained officially neutral in the affair. In 1528 Jerome travelled to Istanbul where, misrepresenting himself as an official ambassador, he concluded a treaty between Z&aacute;polya and Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. The Turkish forces then attacked Hungary and in 1529 laid siege to Vienna. John &agrave; Lasco's role in this agreement is not clear, but he was often called upon to raise financial support. As a reward for his efforts, Z&aacute;polya named him bishop of Veszpr&eacute;m in 1529, a post in which he was never confirmed by the papacy. In March 1530 he delivered a speech before a Polish council of nobles, defending both his brother and Z&aacute;polya. This blatant opposition to the Habsburgs and the papacy, and the unpopular alliance with non-Christian Turks, brought ecclesiastical censure to the aged primate in Poland. He escaped further torment only through his death on 19 May 1531 in Kalisz; John &agrave; Lasco accompanied his uncle's body to Gnesen for burial.<br>
<br>The conflict over Hungary continued, with neither side gaining a decisive victory. In October 1530 the claimants met with other interested leaders in order to resolve the issue diplomatically. They agreed to a year-long armistice but found no permanent resolution. When conflict broke out again, Ferdinand gradually gained the upper hand. Suspicious and desperate, Z&aacute;polya turned on his former ally, Jerome &agrave; Lasco, who may have been asking for repayment of his debts. When Z&aacute;polya threw Jerome into prison, John immediately went to Kasemark in Hungary in order to secure his release. He sought support from important acquaintances, including the king of Poland, the king of France, and the duke of Prussia. Eventually Jan Tarnowski, a nobleman and confidant of Z&aacute;polya, took matters into his own hands and secured Jerome's release. Jerome immediately switched his allegiance to Ferdinand and sent his brother John to make the humiliating request for reconciliation. The entire affair plunged the Laski family deeply into debt and effectively ended its short-lived political power.<h2>
<a name="Changingallegiances"></a>Changing allegiances</h2>After this d&eacute;b&acirc;cle, &agrave; Lasco withdrew for a time from public life, often residing with his sister-in-law, Anna von Kurozaek, in Rytwiany, Poland. Although he frequently complained of poverty he managed to support a young pupil, Nikolaus Anian Burgonius, sending him to Wittenburg in 1534 to study with Melanchthon. The two men were devastated when Burgonius died in Leipzig the following year. During the same period, &agrave; Lasco retained Andreas Frycz Modrzewski as his personal secretary. Modrzewski too resided for a time with Melanchthon and later contributed significantly to the protestant movement in Poland. These connections with Melanchthon are remarkable at a time when &agrave; Lasco had not yet declared himself for the protestant reformation.<br>
<br>After the death of his uncle &agrave; Lasco's place in the ecclesiastical hierarchy diminished rapidly. Several attempts to have him appointed to a bishop's see came to nothing. Declining career prospects and increasing contact with reforming impulses on the continent brought &agrave; Lasco closer to a momentous decision, one which would change his life. In April 1537 he travelled briefly to Frankfurt am Main, probably to test his prospects abroad. During this trip Duke Georg of Saxony imprisoned him briefly in Leipzig, on charges stemming from the Hungarian affair, regarding him as an enemy of Ferdinand von Habsburg. When a letter from the Habsburgs testified to John's new allegiance to Ferdinand, the duke released him. He spent a few days with Melanchthon and then visited the home of the noted German theologian and statesman Julius Pflug. In 1538 he returned to Poland where King Sigismund offered him the small bishopric of Kujawien. &Agrave; Lasco politely refused; apparently he had already decided to emigrate.<br>
<br>In 1539 &agrave; Lasco set out for western Europe with his brother Jerome. He first returned to Frankfurt where he met Albrecht Hardenburg. He then accompanied his friend to Mainz and to Louvain, where Hardenburg served on the theological faculty. In Louvain he joined a small group devoted to biblical study that had its roots in the <i>devotio moderna</i>, a late medieval pietistic movement most famously represented by the <span class="italic">Imitatio Christi</span> of Thomas &agrave; Kempis. There he met the daughter of a Louvain weaver, whom he married in the spring of 1540; her name remains unknown. He defends his decision in a letter to a Polish bishop, citing the scriptural injunction (<span class="roman">1 Corinthians</span> 7: 9) to marry if one cannot remain chaste. To avoid possible persecution, the couple moved a few months later to Emden in East Friesland. Meanwhile Jerome returned to Poland and took to what proved to be his deathbed near the end of 1541. &Agrave; Lasco quickly returned home and was with his brother when he died in December. When word of his homecoming spread abroad, &agrave; Lasco's enemies seized their opportunity. Using reports of his recent marriage, he was challenged to sign an oath testifying his allegiance to the Roman Catholic church. An archivist's note states that &agrave; Lasco actually signed the oath to deny that he had taken a wife and declared that he had not abandoned the doctrine of the gospel, but the oath itself makes no mention of the marriage. Nevertheless the sincerity of his religious allegiance had been called into question, and he was officially deprived of his benefices.<br>
<br>Returning to Emden, &agrave; Lasco now moved more decidedly into the protestant camp. In 1543 he accepted an invitation from Countess Anna of Oldenburg to be pastor of the Emden church and superintendent of all East Friesian churches. He followed the Swiss models for reform laid out by John Calvin and Heinrich Bullinger, although he repeatedly emphasized his independence from these leaders. He soon denied the physical presence of Christ's body and blood in the Lord's supper and stressed the importance of rigorous ecclesiastical discipline within the life of the church. He instituted a <i>coetus</i>, or synod of pastors and lay elders, to assist in church government. He hammered out his theology in the context of disputation, including dialogues with the Anabaptist leaders Menno Simons and David Joris. In 1549 East Friesland came under pressure to accept the Augsburg interim, the religious agreement forced by the emperor Charles V on the protestant princes of Germany in the previous year. For East Friesland this meant the danger of a return to Roman Catholic rule, and ultimately led to &agrave; Lasco's expulsion from Emden. He had anticipated this fate, however, and crossed to England to make arrangements for his being sheltered there. Ostensibly he made the journey to participate in a doctrinal colloquy summoned by Archbishop Thomas Cranmer as part of his programme of religious reform. Cranmer had written at least three times to &agrave; Lasco, inviting him to this conference, while &agrave; Lasco himself corresponded at intervals with Bullinger, Bucer, Melanchthon, and Calvin, all key components in Cranmer's plan. Cranmer even wrote to &agrave; Lasco urging him to bring Melanchthon to the conference. The invitation would also have had the support of William Turner, the king's physician and Protector Somerset's confidant, who had spent some time in Emden under &agrave; Lasco's spiritual direction. As nephew of the late archbishop of Gnesen, moreover, and an acquaintance of the duke of Prussia, &agrave; Lasco was also well known in English political circles, and he was later accused of having used this trip to negotiate a treaty between England and Prussia against Charles V, a charge he consistently denied.<br>
<br>&Agrave; Lasco arrived in England in September 1548 and departed in late February or early March 1549. In the event the colloquy never took place, but this brief visit was none the less beneficial, for he had secured a place of refuge for his East Friesian congregations, should they be forced to leave the continent. On his return to Emden his earlier fears were realized. The countess had accepted a version of the interim and she asked &agrave; Lasco to resign. He rebuked her for a lack of courage but consented to depart. After a tearful farewell, he left Emden and set out for Bremen, where Hardenburg was serving as pastor. In April 1550 he continued his journey, arriving in England the following month. For a short time he resided with Cranmer in Lambeth but soon purchased his own home on Bow Lane, in the city of London. In June he, his wife, and his children (John, Jerome, and Barbara) were made English denizens.<h2>
<a name="YearsinEngland"></a>Years in England</h2>In England, &agrave; Lasco served as superintendent of the Strangers' Church of London, which was officially incorporated by letters patent on 24 July 1550. The royal charter, still preserved in London's Guildhall, grants to the strangers the old church of the Austin friars off Threadneedle Street, which was renamed the &#145;Temple of the Lord Jesus&#146;. &Agrave; Lasco is named as superintendent, along with four additional pastors; two of these would oversee the Dutch church, which to this day continues to meet in Austin Friars, and two would direct the French/Walloon church, which would meet in St Anthony's Chapel on Threadneedle Street. The charter granted them freedom to use their own rites and ceremonies, &#145;not withstanding that they do not conform with the rites and ceremonies used in our Kingdom&#146;  (Lindeboom, 202). This was an extraordinary privilege, especially given the fact that a religious <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> had just been passed the previous year. In his most famous work, <span class="italic">Forma ac ratio</span> (1555), &agrave; Lasco gives an account of the &#145;Form and Rationale&#146; of the ceremonies used by these immigrants, which may have had some influence upon the 1552 <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, especially on penitential rites associated with the morning and evening prayer services. More direct lines of influence can be traced to John Knox's Scottish order (1560&#150;61) and to the Middleburg ordinal (1602), later used by English puritans. On the continent traces of the Strangers' Church's order can be found in the 1563 German Palatinate order and in the &#145;forms and prayers&#146; attached to Pieter Dathenus's 1566 psalter, which in turn influenced liturgies in the Dutch reformed churches.<br>
<br>Opposition to these novel rites came almost immediately, most notably from Nicholas Ridley, bishop of London, in whose diocese the churches were established and who endeavoured to limit the independence of their congregations. This opposition was no doubt linked to the controversy over John Hooper's refusal to wear the requisite ecclesiastical vestments to his consecration as bishop of Gloucester. &Agrave; Lasco took an active role in this controversy, vocally supporting Hooper in his opposition to the vestments. He was quite disappointed when Martin Bucer and Pietro Martire Vermigli finally persuaded Hooper that he should accept the prescribed ecclesiastical garb and be consecrated bishop.<br>
<br>At the same time there were disputes between the Dutch and the French congregations as to the ownership of property and the diversity of rites. When accused of departing from Calvin's example, &agrave; Lasco wrote directly to the Genevan reformer, asking for his assistance in the dispute. Meanwhile, a small Italian congregation joined the stranger group. Its minister charged &agrave; Lasco with departing from Calvin's teaching on predestination, but the superintendent responded simply that Calvin had spoken &#145;too harshly&#146; in this matter  (&Agrave; Lasco, <span class="italic">Opera</span>, 2.676). In addition to professional struggles, &agrave; Lasco also experienced personal tragedy. His three-month-old son Paul died in November 1550, and in 1552 he lost his wife to the sweating sickness. He himself contracted the sickness and suffered from chronic headaches thereafter. In 1553, however, he announced plans to remarry. His second wife, Katherina, accompanied him for the rest of his life and with her he had five more children, one of whom, Samuel, gained some notoriety as a soldier.<h2>
<a name="ReturntoEmdenandPoland"></a>Return to Emden and Poland</h2>When Queen Mary ascended the English throne in 1553, &agrave; Lasco and most of his associates were forced to find refuge elsewhere. At first they sought a home in Denmark, but they were soon turned away, ostensibly because of their Zwinglian views on the sacraments. Late in 1553 &agrave; Lasco returned to Emden, where he found it necessary to rebuke a former colleague, Gellius Faber, for publishing a catechism that was too Lutheran in its content. He also began a literary war against the Lutheran theologian Joachim Westphal over sacramental issues. In the meantime he continued to involve himself in the affairs of returning exiles, advising congregations in both Wesel and Frankfurt am Main. In both cases he consulted Calvin. In April 1555 &agrave; Lasco went to Frankfurt, where he finally met Calvin personally. There he drew the fire of another Lutheran theologian, Johann Timann. In his response &agrave; Lasco argued unpersuasively that he agreed in substance with the standard Lutheran confession, the <i>confessio Augustana</i>.<br>
<br>In 1556 &agrave; Lasco's career came full circle, and he was allowed to return to Poland. He immediately came under attack for his sacramental teaching, most notably from a former colleague, Bishop Hosius. In 1557 he addressed a defence of his doctrine to the Polish king and appended a copy of the <i>confessio Augustana</i>. As the king read the confession, &agrave; Lasco's defence fell on the floor where a dog started to devour it. A sympathetic servant rescued the document and transcribed it for the king's reading.<br>
<br>During his final years &agrave; Lasco attended numerous meetings and synods aimed at achieving a religious consensus among the Polish people, and especially among Polish protestants. His efforts failed in 1558, when the Prussian Lutherans refused to sign a common confession at a conference in K&ouml;nigsberg. In the autumn of 1559 he fell sick, and by Christmas he was desperately ill. On 8 January 1560 he died at Pinczow in the presence of his wife and children. The funeral was held on 29 January, and his body was buried at the high altar in the church at Pinczow; the site of the grave was destroyed in 1884 by the bishop of Cracow. Soon after his death a certain Grzegorz Orszak began to circulate rumours that the lips on &agrave; Lasco's corpse had fused together, in divine judgment upon his heresy. The synod decided to reopen the grave to dispel the rumour. &Agrave; Lasco left his family in relative poverty, though the local nobility granted them a gift of 289 gulden. In 1564 his wife wrote a touching letter to Duke Albrecht of east Prussia, requesting further support. The Laski family as a whole soon reverted to Roman Catholicism, before disappearing from the historical record.<h2>
<a name="Religioussignificance"></a>Religious significance</h2>Throughout his career John &agrave; Lasco demonstrated a curious mixture of ecumenism and fierce independence. As an ecclesiastical diplomat he believed strongly that for protestantism to succeed upon the continent it was essential for the various evangelical factions to unite. The means to this end was a common confession of eucharistic doctrine. Hitherto the debate had centred upon the presence of Christ's body and blood in the elements of bread and wine. On this point &agrave; Lasco was decidedly Zwinglian, believing that Christ's body remained in heaven. However, he cleverly, though unsuccessfully, tried to refocus the discussion, drawing attention to the entire action of the ceremony rather than viewing the elements as the focal point. In this perspective the benefit of the eucharist does not lie in the bread and wine alone, but rather it depends upon participation in the rite as a whole. By such participation believers are &#145;sealed&#146; by the Holy Spirit in the spiritual communion with Christ. They should therefore remain seated while receiving communion, because in this way the sacrament testifies to &#145;our Sabbath rest in Christ&#146;  (&Agrave; Lasco, <span class="italic">Opera</span>, 2.658). As a seal, this rite carries divine authority, causing &agrave; Lasco to reject the Zwinglian analogy for the eucharist, as a soldier's oath of allegiance. He likewise opposed what he understood of Calvin's position, that Christ was somehow spiritually present in the elements.<br>
<br>&Agrave; Lasco also made notable contributions to the formation of church polities. As superintendent of churches in East Friesland he was instrumental in establishing the <i>coetus</i>, the governing body consisting of ministers and lay elders, and perhaps more than any other leading reformer he insisted that both groups formed a single &#145;order&#146;, albeit with the important distinction that only ministers could teach and administer the sacraments. When he moved to England he instituted something like a synod, in which ministers and elders from the various stranger congregations supervised the entire organization of their churches. These incipient forms of presbyterianism would not be unknown to later Elizabethan puritans. Nor did they forget that the crown had once granted to these immigrants a right of legal nonconformity, something which in their own time it would not grant to England's own citizens.<br>
