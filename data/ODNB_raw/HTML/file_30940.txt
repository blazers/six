<span class="headword">Clayton,  Philip Thomas Byard <span class="st"> [Tubby]</span></span>  (1885&#150;1972), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and founder of the Toc H movement</span>, was born on 12 December 1885 at Maryborough, Queensland, Australia, the third son and sixth and youngest child of Reginald Byard Buchanan Clayton, manager of a sugar plantation, and his wife, who was also his first cousin, Isobel Byard Sheppard. In 1886 the family returned to England and Reginald Clayton started an agency in the City for the export and import of goods to and from Australia. Philip Clayton was educated at St Paul's School and, as Squire scholar, at Exeter College, Oxford. He obtained a third class in classical honour moderations in 1907 and a first in theology in 1909. He then went to live in the deanery of Westminster and read with the dean, J. Armitage Robinson. In 1910 he was made deacon and in 1911 was ordained priest in Guildford by E. S. Talbot, bishop of Winchester.<br>
<br>Clayton began his clerical career in 1910 in the parish of St Mary, Portsea, where Cyril Garbett, later archbishop of York, was vicar. He volunteered as an army chaplain when war broke out and worked in hospitals in France. The senior chaplain of the 6th division, Neville Talbot (son of the bishop of Winchester and later bishop of Pretoria), was looking for someone to establish a rest-house for the troops in the bottleneck on the way to and from the Ypres salient. He interested his friend Clayton in the idea and together they found an empty mansion at Poperinghe and transformed it into Talbot House, named thus in memory of Neville Talbot's brother, who had been killed in action a few months previously. Thousands of men used the house, which had a canteen, recreation and writing room, library, chaplain's room, and chapel, and which became known as TH, or Toc H in Morse signallers' language. Clayton, always known as Tubby, used it as a base for visiting men in the front line. He was given a roving commission with the 14th East Ham heavy battery in 1916. Tirelessly energetic, his magnetic personality became known and loved by thousands behind and in the front line. He was awarded the MC in 1917.<br>
<br>On his return to England after the war Clayton established an ordination school at the former Knutsford prison, from which 435 priests were eventually ordained, and where he himself was chaplain and tutor. He also established a Talbot House in London in 1920 and began the Toc H movement, which had forty branches by 1922, the year in which it became an association incorporated by royal charter. The premisses of the movement were fellowship, service, fair-mindedness, and the kingdom of God.<br>
<br>To collect funds Clayton went on a Canadian tour in 1921. In 1923 the archbishop of Canterbury, Randall Davidson, gave him All Hallows by the Tower as a living to redeem as the spiritual centre of Toc H. It became Toc H's guild church, and he remained its vicar until 1963. In 1923 a lamp, which was to become its symbol, was lit for the movement by the prince of Wales in the Albert Hall. From that year onwards Clayton embarked on world tours for fund-raising. The movement prospered and eventually numbered a thousand branches in Britain, hundreds overseas, and a women's association of similar strength. Clayton was appointed CH in 1933.<br>
<br>In 1934 Clayton undertook a strenuous tour of the Rhodesias and South Africa which led to a nervous breakdown. He recovered during a year spent in India at Belgaum with his brother Sir Hugh Clayton. For a few months in 1935 he was chaplain on the <i>Codrington</i> and then the <i>Beagle</i>, stationed at Malta. Early in 1936 he returned to England and to work at All Hallows and the Tower Hill Improvement Trust, which he had launched ten years before.<br>
<br>In the early years of the Second World War, Clayton was with the Royal Navy in the Orkneys, establishing Toc H clubs around Scapa Flow. In 1940 All Hallows was destroyed by a bomb and he was given the chaplaincy of Anglo-Saxon Petroleum's tanker fleet, which took him to various parts of America. In 1943 he sailed to Gibraltar in a small naval craft and thence went on a tour of Karachi, Abadan, Tehran, Basrah, Baghdad, and Haifa, returning to Gibraltar late in 1944. The next year discussions began on reviving All Hallows; Clayton was active in raising funds, undertaking an exhausting tour of Canada and the USA, which resulted in the Americans sending the Winant volunteers to help rebuild the church, which was rededicated in 1957. From 1958 onwards he was connected with the voyages of Sir Francis Chichester, three of whose yachts he personally blessed.<br>
<br>A man of enormous sympathy and courage, never sparing himself, convinced that his work was God-ordained, Clayton was unaware of time or his own appearance. He was frequently late for appointments, causing much distress and anxiety to his aides-de-camp and to those who awaited his arrival. He was an imaginative and original speaker with a retentive memory and a sense of humour which made him excellent company. His voice had a deep growling resonance and his eyes were mischievous. His way with people of all ages and circumstances was renowned, but he was rarely at ease with women. Despite his thousands of admirers and disciples he was a deeply lonely man with very few close friends. His constant companion was his dog.<br>
<br>Clayton received the degree of DD (Lambeth) in 1954. He died at his home on Tower Hill on 15 December 1972. He was unmarried.<br>
