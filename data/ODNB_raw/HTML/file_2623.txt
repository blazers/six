<span class="headword">Blanford,  Henry Francis</span>  (1834&#150;1893), <span class="occ">meteorologist and geologist</span>, was born on 3 June 1834 at 27 Bouverie Street, Whitefriars, London, where his father had a workshop manufacturing gilt mouldings, the son of William Blanford and his wife, Elizabeth Simpson. He was the younger brother of the geologist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31923/', "William Thomas Blanford")</script>. He went to schools in Brighton and Brussels. After then studying for some time at the School of Design, first at Somerset House, then at Marlborough House, he entered the Royal School of Mines, London, in 1851. There he received the duke of Cornwall's scholarship. Afterwards he studied mining for a year at the Bergakademie, Freiberg, Saxony, and spent some time preparing <span class="italic">An Introduction to the Use of the Blowpipe</span> (1856; 3rd edn, 1875), an English translation of Carol Johann August Theodor Scheerer's work.<br>
<br>In 1855 Blanford and his brother William were appointed to the Geological Survey of India. Arriving at Calcutta in late September of that year, they spent their first field season (1855&#150;6) surveying the Talchir coalfield in Orissa. There they identified the effects of ice action in the boulder bed now known as the Talchir tillite, thereby laying a foundation for the later conception of the Gondwana glaciation and of Gondwanaland as a great southern continent. From 1 December 1856 Blanford acted as first curator of the new Museum of Geology at Calcutta, and took charge of the office of the superintendent of the geological survey. He also delivered a course of lectures on geology at Presidency College, Calcutta, during that winter. In 1857 he was dispatched to Madras, where he spent three years determining the stratigraphy and palaeontology of the cretaceous rocks near Trichinopoly and Pondicherry. In December 1861, partly because his health was suffering, he resigned from the survey and returned to Europe. However, the following year he accepted a post as professor in the Bengal education department, lecturing in physics and chemistry at Presidency College, where he remained until 1872.<br>
<br>In August 1863 Blanford became one of the secretaries of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, and partly in consequence of his duties there he became interested in meteorology. In the following year Calcutta suffered from a devastating cyclone, of which Blanford published a detailed description in 1866, and the urgent requirement to establish a storm warning system for the port led the lieutenant-governor of Bengal to appoint Blanford as meteorological reporter for Bengal in 1867. In this post Blanford began to systematize the gathering of meteorological data in Bengal and made important observations concerning the origin of cyclones. His accounts, published annually as the <span class="italic">Report of the Meteorological Reporter</span>, were praised as &#145;model monograms of the subject&#146;  (<span class="italic">Nature</span>, 11, 1874&#150;5, 146).<br>
<br>Blanford married Charlotte Mackenzie, daughter of George Ferguson Cockburn of the Bengal civil service, and granddaughter of Lord Justice Cockburn, on 20 June 1867. In 1874, at the recommendation of General Richard Strachey, he was appointed meteorological reporter to the government of India, with the object of organizing a comprehensive pan-Indian system of data gathering, analysis, and dissemination. One of his most important contributions during this time was his hypothesis that the &#145;varying extent and thickness of the Himalayan snows exercise a great and prolonged influence on the climatic conditions and weather of the plains of North West India&#146;  (<span class="italic"><span class="roman">&#145;On the Connection of the Himalaya Snowfall with Dry Winds and Seasons of Drought in India&#146;</span>, Proceedings of the Royal Society</span>, 37, 1884, 3), the application of which enabled him correctly to forecast deficient summer monsoon rainfall over western India in 1885.<br>
<br>Blanford held the post of reporter until he retired in 1889, but during the final two years he was in England on furlough. From early 1892 failing health forced him to abandon scientific work, and he died of cancer at his home, 7 Ingles Road, Folkestone, on 23 January 1893. His wife, one son, and three daughters survived him.<br>
<br>Blanford was elected a fellow of the Geological Society in 1862, and of the Royal Society in 1880. In 1884&#150;5 he was president of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. He was a versatile and prolific writer, publishing over eighty scientific papers. He made a number of important contributions to both geology and, more especially, to meteorology, but also wrote on malacology and archaeology. The majority of his papers appeared in <span class="italic">Nature</span>, the <span class="italic">Journal</span> and <span class="italic">Proceedings</span> of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, and the <span class="italic">Indian Meteorological Memoirs</span>, an important series which he instituted at Calcutta. Of his several independent works the most important were, perhaps, <span class="italic">The Indian Meteorologist's Vade Mecum</span> (1868; enlarged edn, 1877), which was described as a &#145;model handbook&#146;  (<span class="italic">Nature</span>, 19, 1878&#150;79, 294); <span class="italic">A Practical Guide to the Climates and Weather of India, Ceylon, Burma, and the Storms of the Indian Seas</span> (1889); and the pedagogic work, <span class="italic">Rudiments of Physical Geography for the Use of Indian Schools</span> (1873; 6th edn, 1878).<br>
