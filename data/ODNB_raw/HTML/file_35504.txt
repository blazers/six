<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Philby,  Harry St John Bridger</span>  (1885&#150;1960), <span class="occ">explorer and Arabist</span>, was born at St John's, Badulla, Ceylon, on 3 April 1885, the second son of Harry Montagu Philby (<i>d</i>. 1913), a coffee planter, and his wife, Queenie (1864&#150;1950), known as May, daughter of Colonel John Duncan, commander of the local garrison. The Philbys were from Chigwell in Essex and perhaps originally from Filby Broad in Norfolk. Philby's father was an unsatisfactory husband and his wife left him in 1891, going home to her parents in London and taking her four sons with her. Thereafter Philby's contact with his father was sporadic and the family was always short of money. Philby, who was known as Jack, won a scholarship to Westminster School, where he excelled in both studies and games. In 1904 he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, with an exhibition in classics. Switching to modern languages, he took a first and was accepted into the Indian Civil Service. He spent an extra year at Cambridge studying oriental languages under the famous E. G. Browne and in November 1908 sailed for India, where he was posted to the Punjab. In 1910 he married Dora Johnston (<i>d</i>. 1957); they had a son and three daughters.<br>
<br>In the Punjab, Philby won a reputation for zeal and industry and early reports on his work were glowing. But a couple of incidents which revealed his innate pugnacity, together with a marriage too early by Indian Civil Service standards, held up his promotion. He took refuge in the acquisition of languages: Urdu, Punjabi, Baluchi, Persian, and, eventually, Arabic. The allowances he got for them helped his shaky finances and his linguistic aptitude changed his career. In October 1915 Percy Cox, the chief political officer with the Mesopotamian expeditionary force, needed linguists as civilian administrators, and Philby was among those selected.<br>
<br>In Mesopotamia, Philby's work was the old mixture of competence and tactlessness. He won influential supporters (Cox and Gertrude Bell, for example); he reformed the administration's finances; he became Cox's personal assistant; he was appointed CIE. But failing to get on with Cox's deputy, Arnold Wilson, he contrived to have himself sent, in November 1917, as head of a mission to Ibn Sa&#145;ud, ruler of the Nejd in central Arabia, whom the British were keen to woo into an attack on the Rashids of Ha&#146;il, allies of the Turks. He travelled with a small party by camel from the coast of the Persian Gulf to Riyadh. There he spent ten days and was deeply impressed by the personality of Ibn Sa&#145;ud. It was the start of an admiration that stayed with him for life. Persuading Ibn Sa&#145;ud to provide an escort, he continued his journey, again by camel, to Jiddah on the Red Sea, characteristically without waiting for Baghdad's permission. This crossing of Arabia from coast to coast brought him for the first time into the public eye.<br>
<br>In Jiddah, Philby met the Hashemite ruler of Hejaz, the Sharif Husain, leader of the Arab revolt, whose sons were in the field against the Turks, under the guidance of T. E. Lawrence. He became convinced that the British authorities in Cairo and London were wrong to prefer Husain over Ibn Sa&#145;ud as the future leader of the Arabs. But his arguments to this effect did not prevail, either then or later. Though he went back to Riyadh for a time, the end of the war brought the closure of his mission to Ibn Sa&#145;ud. After a long leave in England, during which he was sent out to Arabia in a fruitless bid to reconcile Husain and Ibn Sa&#145;ud, he was recalled to Baghdad to help with the administration of the new state of Iraq. But he was out of sympathy with British policy there, especially with the decision to insert a Hashemite monarch (Faisal, son of the Sharif Husain), and in 1921 he accepted with relief the post of British representative in Transjordan, where the emir Abdullah, another son of Husain's, had been installed by a decision of Winston Churchill, the colonial secretary, at a conference in Cairo. Here too, though, he was eventually uncomfortable. Chief among his grievances were friction with Sir Herbert Samuel, the high commissioner in Jerusalem, and dismay at what he saw as the British government's departure from the policy established at the Cairo conference. Accordingly he resigned in 1924 and a year later left the public service altogether.<br>
<br>Philby rejoiced in his freedom but had no income apart from a small pension. In 1926 with the support of some businessmen he settled in Jiddah (whence Ibn Sa&#145;ud had now ousted the Hashemites), founded a trading company, Sharqieh Ltd, and became a close friend and an unofficial adviser of Ibn Sa&#145;ud. His family visited him from time to time but for the most part stayed in England. Business, exploration, writing, and Ibn Sa&#145;ud's councils were henceforth the pattern of his life. Commerce, however, was only his bread and butter: his true interest was exploration. Over the next thirty years he made a series of remarkable journeys, of which the greatest was his crossing of the &#145;empty quarter&#146; in 1932. On these journeys he travelled by camel and later by car. By day he collected place names, temperatures, compass bearings, barometric pressures, rocks, fossils, flora and fauna, and ancient inscriptions. At night he wrote them up in his diaries, squatting in the sand by lamplight and hiding his work from his suspicious Arab escort. These journeys and the many books, articles, and lectures in which he described them are a monument to his scholarship, industry, and endurance, and won him high honour with the Royal Geographical Society, the British Museum, Kew Gardens, and academic societies all over the world. He was awarded the founder's gold medal of the Royal Geographical Society in 1920 and the Sir Richard Burton memorial medal of the Royal Asiatic Society in 1925. His other writings (on Islam, on the history of Arabia, and autobiography) suffer from a ponderous and sometimes antiquated prose. In all, he published fifteen books.<br>
<br>As a member of Ibn Sa&#145;ud's circle of advisers Philby's position was unique. A foreigner, a European, and&#151;at first&#151;an unbeliever, he was widely suspected of being a British agent. But the king enjoyed his company and valued his knowledge of the outside world and his uniquely candid opinions. He was an influential middleman in the negotiations which led to the award of an oil concession to an American company in 1933 (a blow to the British and a turning point for Saudi Arabia). His conversion to Islam in 1930&#151;probably not an act of faith but inspired by an urge to enter more deeply into Arabian society&#151;brought the two men closer. Thereafter he was called by Saudis Sheikh Abdullah. Ibn Sa&#145;ud paid no salary but from time to time presented him with gifts, among them, in 1945, a second wife, Rozy Abdul Aziz (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1929). They had two sons, who became citizens of Saudi Arabia.<br>
<br>Before and during the Second World War Philby was a pacifist and an appeaser. In 1939 he stood as an anti-war candidate in a by-election in Hythe and lost his deposit. Back in Arabia his outspoken attacks on British policy irritated the king and prompted him to warn the British legation in 1940 of Philby's intention to travel to America for a lecture tour. Philby was arrested in Bombay, taken to England, and imprisoned briefly under wartime regulations. After friends procured his release he was involved for a time with the Common Wealth, but soon gave up British politics. At the end of the war he returned to his old life in Arabia. But after the death of Ibn Sa&#145;ud in 1953 his outspoken criticisms of the extravagance and corruption under the new king led in 1955 to his exile in the Lebanese village of Ajaltun. A year later there was the semblance of a reconciliation and he subsequently paid several visits to his old haunts, but his home remained in Lebanon. He died on 30 September 1960 in hospital at Beirut, where he had been staying with his son, the British intelligence officer (and Soviet spy) <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40699/', "Harold Adrian Russell (Kim) Philby (1912&#150;1988)")</script>. He was buried the next day in the Muslim cemetery in the Basta quarter of Beirut.<br>
<br>Philby's character was a mixture of opposites. His claim to be a man of unyielding principle was largely true. He stuck to his guns, even though it made him an awkward colleague and subordinate. He was always &#145;agin the government&#146;, obstinate and combative. He records that he was once caught saying: &#145;I didn't hear what you said but I entirely disagree with you&#146;  (Philby, <span class="italic">Arabian Days</span>, 135). He was, in short, an opinionated radical. At the same time he had an old-fashioned tory's addiction to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, the cricket scores, the honours list, the Athenaeum. And he could be devious. His replacement of a senior colleague as head of the mission to Ibn Sa&#145;ud in 1917 was a dubious manoeuvre. The part he played in winning the Saudi oil concession for the Americans was secretive (though it was good for the Saudis). His motives for the adoption of Islam were obscure. His views on the Palestine problem were highly inconsistent. His treatment of his long-suffering wife Dora was sometimes shabby. Yet there was something about him that was defiant, persistent, even noble. Few would quarrel with the inscription on his tombstone: &#145;Greatest of Arabian explorers&#146;. And in the central judgements of his life&#151;that Ibn Sa&#145;ud was the man to back in Arabia and that the Arabs had to have their independence&#151;he was right and almost everyone else was wrong.<br>
