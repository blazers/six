<span class="headword">Hill,  Rosamond  Davenport</span>  (1825&#150;1902), <span class="occ">social reformer and educational administrator</span>, born in Chelsea on 4 August 1825, was the eldest of the three daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13286/', "Matthew Davenport Hill (1792&#150;1872)")</script> and Margaret Bucknall (<i>d</i>. 1867). Her father, the first recorder of Birmingham, was the eldest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13313/', "Thomas Wright Hill")</script> and Sarah Lea of Birmingham, whose five sons flourished as social reformers and professional civil servants in the Victorian period. Matthew's brothers included the postal reformer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13299/', "Sir Rowland Hill (1795&#150;1879)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54053/', "Frederic Hill (1803&#150;1896)")</script>, one of the first inspectors of prisons, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13272/', "Edwin Hill (1793&#150;1876)")</script>.<br>
<br>The children of Thomas Wright and Sarah Lea Hill shared an interest in an overlapping group of social concerns, including educational reform, penal reform, and reform of the treatment of juvenile delinquents. Rosamond Davenport Hill was thus part of the third generation of social reformers in the Hill family, along with her sisters <a name="cosubject_38756"></a><span class="headword">Florence Davenport Hill</span>  (1828/9&#150;1919), who was also born in Chelsea, and <a name="cosubject_56689"></a><span class="headword">Joanna Margaret Hill</span>  (1836/7&#150;1901), who was born in Hampstead. All three were involved in prison reform and the reform of the treatment of juvenile delinquents and the children of the poor. Rosamond, the best known of the three, was also involved in educational reform. Their parents had moved from Birmingham to London after their marriage in 1819, and the family, which also included two sons, Alfred (1821&#150;1907) and Matthew Berkeley (1834&#150;1892), lived in Hampstead from 1831 to 1851. They were acquainted with a wide circle of reformers and writers including Charles Knight, Leigh Hunt, and William Thackeray. Contact with such individuals, as well as with their own extended family, provided Rosamond, Florence, and Joanna with a political education and fuelled in all of them a sense of social responsibility. While their parents espoused conventional Victorian notions about appropriate roles for women, the daughters were encouraged to develop independence of mind and to value their own capacities for serious work. For example, their father had a great respect for the noted Irish writer and reformer Maria Edgeworth. When she visited London in 1840 he arranged that Rosamond and Florence should pay a call on her: Rosamond's biographer, E. E. Metcalfe, relates that this visit made a deep impression on Rosamond and on Florence.<br>
<br>The education of the Hill sisters took place both at school and at home. Rosamond attended a day school when she was eight and later went to boarding-school, but from late adolescence she studied at home with a governess. As the eldest daughter Rosamond was especially close to her father. She acted as his private secretary, and visited prisons and reformatories with him in Great Britain and in Europe. In 1856, after a visit to Ireland, she wrote &#145;A lady's visit to the Irish convict prisons&#146;. Throughout her life she continued to present and publish papers on prison reform, education, female emigration, and temperance. She and her sister Florence were co-authors, along with their father, of <span class="italic">Our Exemplars: Rich and Poor</span> (1860).<br>
<br>In 1851 the Hill family moved to Bristol. There Matthew Davenport Hill's involvement with prison reform brought him into close contact with the social activist Mary Carpenter, whose reform interests included educational work with society's poorest children, and with the reform of the treatment of juvenile delinquents. Rosamond, Florence, and Joanna became part of Carpenter's reforming circle. Rosamond, for example, helped to manage the St James's Back ragged school, and, with Carpenter, started an industrial school for girls. Joanna became secretary of the local workhouse visiting association, in which cause she continued to interest herself after moving to Birmingham in 1864.<br>
<br>Matthew died in 1872, and Rosamond and Florence &#145;now left Bristol and entered upon that affectionate and happy partnership which closed only with the close of life&#146;  (Metcalfe, 47). They began this new period of their lives with a trip to Australia, to visit the family of their paternal aunt, Caroline Clark, one of whose children, Emily, was, like her cousins, concerned with child welfare reform. On their return Rosamond and Florence published <span class="italic">What we Saw in Australia</span> (1875), an account of their visits to prisons, reformatories, and schools in New South Wales. In 1878 Rosamond and Florence published their life of their father, <span class="italic">The Recorder of Birmingham: a Memoir of Matthew Davenport Hill</span>.<br>
<br>By 1879 the two sisters had established themselves in a house in Belsize Park, where they lived until 1897, after which, in retirement, they moved to a house named Hillstow, in Headington, near Oxford. Matthew Davenport Hill and his family had been members of the Church of England, but Matthew's father, Thomas Wright Hill, had been a Unitarian, and after her father's death Rosamond left the Church of England for the Unitarians. The most public period of her life began in 1879. The <span class="roman">Education Act</span> of 1870 had created a network of locally elected school boards. The fact that women could serve on the boards was a significant innovation. When Rosamond Davenport Hill was elected in December 1879 as a Progressive member of the London school board for the City of London she became one of a handful of pioneer women school board members. She served until 1897. As a school board member Rosamond was noted for her activities in relation to industrial schools and also for her advocacy of the introduction of what would become known as domestic science courses for girls. In 1882 she became chair of the board's cookery committee, and published an influential article in <span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span>, &#145;Cookery teaching under the London school board&#146;. In 1895 she was appointed a life governor of University College, London. She died at her home on 5 August 1902.<br>
<br>Florence Davenport Hill continued to work in the areas of prison reform and poor law reform and took a special interest in the reform of the treatment of pauper children, especially pauper orphans. She became an advocate of the boarding-out system, rather than the workhouse, as a means of providing for such children, and published a book on the subject, <span class="italic">Children of the State</span> (1st edn, 1867; rev. and enlarged 2nd edn, ed. Fanny Fowke, 1889). In it Florence articulated her views concerning the dangers pauper children presented to the community because of the &#145;bad tendencies of those of evil pedigree&#146;  (p. 22) as well as the dangers they faced themselves, not only from hunger, disease, and ill treatment, but also from the workhouse, which reduced all its inmates to &#145;one dead level of hopeless and demoralised dependence&#146;  (p. 16). For Florence Davenport Hill the cure for the moral degradation of the workhouse included the inculcation in pauper children of the values of integrity and self-discipline. Florence believed that for boys and girls alike, but especially for girls, such positive moral values could only be instilled in a homelike environment. Florence Davenport Hill's public career also included service as a poor-law guardian for the borough of St Pancras. She died at her home in Oxford on 2 November 1919, at the age of ninety.<br>
<br>Joanna Hill, like Florence, was concerned with poor law reform, pauper children, and the most appropriate treatment for working-class girls in danger of becoming juvenile delinquents. She wrote <span class="italic">Boarding out Pauper Children</span> (1869), &#145;A plea for the extension of the boarding-out system&#146; (1883; cited in Florence Davenport Hill, <span class="italic">Children of the State</span>, 2nd edn, 17), and <span class="italic">Practical suggestions for the use of associates for the department for G[irls'] F[riendly] S[ociety] candidates for workhouses and orphanages</span> (1884). She died at her home in Birmingham on 26 October 1901.<br>
<br>Of Rosamond as a woman reformer it was said: &#145;She conferred a boon on her own sex by demonstrating that a woman may be as capable of bearing a part in the direction of her country's affairs as her male fellow-citizens&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sunday Magazine</span>, July 1880, cited Metcalfe, 20). Rosamond and Florence were part of a wide circle of women reformers which included Octavia Hill (no relation); Helen Taylor, and Frances Power Cobbe. As women reformers they took a special interest in the welfare of girls. Although they were not notably active in the women's movement, their concerns and activities did bring them into contact with such women's rights advocates as Millicent Garrett Fawcett, and they supported women's suffrage while at the same time adhering to the Victorian belief that women had special responsibilities and special gifts for maintaining moral values in both the private and the public spheres.<br>
