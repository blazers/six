<span class="headword">Lane,  William</span>  (1745/6&#150;1814), <span class="occ">publisher</span>, was probably born in Whitechapel, London, the son of John Lane, poulterer, and his wife, Mary. He became a liveryman of the Poulterers' Company in 1767, and in the same year was admitted into the Honourable Artillery Company, in which he was to achieve some eminence. He began his bookselling activities about 1770 from his father's shop, but had moved to 13 Aldgate High Street by the end of 1773; it was at this time that his first publications came out, among them the <span class="italic">Ladies' Museum</span> (1773&#150;1814), and that he began to explore the possibilities of circulating libraries.<br>
<br>While retaining an interest in the artillery company (he had been elected to the office of adjutant in 1772 and in 1774 was the first captain of the Red regiment of trained bands), he resigned as adjutant in 1775 in order to concentrate on his business. He transferred to the Stationers' Company in 1777, becoming a liveryman in 1776 at the time of his move to 33 Leadenhall Street. About 1784 he set up a press there, and founded an ambitious system of circulating libraries; to anyone wishing to found such a library he offered a stock of books, a catalogue, and instructions. He was a pioneer in establishing circulating libraries in country districts; earlier they had been confined to major towns and watering-places. Also, as a means of diffusing his own publications, this time through advertisement, he was among the backers in 1788 of the first evening daily, the <span class="italic">Star and Evening Advertiser</span>; it created a precedent in offering a copy service to others. Lane's partnership with the printer of the <span class="italic">Star</span>, Peter Stuart, was curtailed in 1789 at the time of the <span class="roman">Regency Bill</span>, when Stuart allegedly printed anti-Pitt propaganda; in revenge, Stuart began a short-lived rival to the <span class="italic">Star</span> in which Lane was pilloried as a &#145;scribbling poulterer&#146; and his paper as the &#145;Dog Star&#146;. Lane's <span class="italic">Star</span> continued until 1831, when it was absorbed by <span class="italic">The Albion</span>.<br>
<br>In 1790 Lane adopted for his business the title Minerva Press. It was under this imprint that the light romantic novels were issued which constituted the staple fare of Lane's circulating libraries. Often written by women (including Agnes Maria Bennett and Elizabeth Meeke), and intended for a female readership, the novels are characterized by a blend of sentiment and sensationalism with elements of the fashionable Gothic, such as the popular <span class="italic">The Children of the Abbey</span> (1796) by Regina Maria Roche; a number of them were translations from the French. The Minerva Press became synonymous with cheap fiction and into the nineteenth century the name &#145;meant little more than a convenient epithet of contempt&#146;  (Blakey, 1). (In recent analyses &#145;notorious presses&#146; such as Minerva are held responsible for the &#145;constant criticism and mockery aimed at fiction by educated people in the period who saw in it an undermining of traditional classical culture&#146;  (Todd, 219&#150;20).)<br>
<br>Nevertheless by the end of the eighteenth century Lane had become wealthy by profits from them and from military activities. By 1791 he had risen to the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the White regiment and first captain of the West London regiment in 1794. In his business Lane formed separate departments in printing, and in publishing and bookselling. In 1801 he took Anthony King Newman as his partner in publishing. In 1803 the company was trading as Lane, Newman &amp; Co. When war with France was renewed in the same year his publication of <span class="italic">The Soldier's Companion</span> secured him a considerable fortune. Minerva books were circulating internationally. Lane retired from business at some time between 1803 and 1808 and settled in Brighton. He was replaced by John Darling in 1809.<br>
<br>Lane married twice; his second wife, Phoebe (<i>bap</i>. 1770), was the daughter of Lewis Shepheard of Richmond, Surrey. Lane died on 29 January 1814 at 3 Gloucester Place, Brighton, aged sixty-eight. He had no children. He was buried in his wife's family vault at Richmond parish church on 9 February 1814. Acquaintances credited Lane with &#145;strong mental powers &hellip; energy and spirit&#146;  (Blakey, 25). The development of the library system remains his most significant achievement.<br>
