<span class="headword">Caine, Sir  Sydney</span>  (1902&#150;1991), <span class="occ">colonial official and university administrator</span>, was born on 27 June 1902 at 58 Gresham Road, Hendon, London, the son of Harry Edward Caine, railway clerk, and his wife, Jane Harker, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Buckley. He was educated at Harrow county school and the London School of Economics (LSE), obtaining a first-class honours degree in economics in 1922. He first became an assistant collector of taxes, then in 1926 passed the revived civil service competitive examination and entered the Colonial Office, where his understanding of fiscal administration was appreciated at a time when the department and the colonial governments were forced by worldwide recession to make cuts in expenditure. In 1929 he was appointed secretary to the West Indian sugar commission and five years after that secretary to the United Kingdom sugar industry inquiry committee, created to protect the economies and expand the markets of the sugar-producing British dependencies.<br>
<br>In 1937, when Hong Kong required a sounder economic structure, Caine was sent there as financial secretary. He reshaped the system of revenue collection and designed a number of fiscal reforms which, because of the Japanese invasion, could not be fully implemented until after the Second World War, when they formed the basis of the territory's subsequent prosperity. He enjoyed living in the Far East and the many intellectual challenges it presented.<br>
<br>Caine was recalled to the Colonial Office as an assistant secretary in 1940. There his wide understanding of the financial implications of radical economic and social changes in colonial administration intended by the first <span class="roman">Colonial Development and Welfare Act</span> was particularly valuable. He was soon seconded to the colonial supply liaison office in Washington, to handle economic and labour problems arising from the United States <span class="roman">Lend-Lease Act</span>. As a member of the Anglo-American Caribbean commission he was afforded in 1942 an opportunity to further the interests of the West Indies and help protect their constitutional advance while negotiating the terms of collaboration between Britain and America to defend that region during and immediately after the war. The scope of his work widened when that same year he returned to England as financial adviser to Oliver Stanley, the secretary of state for the colonies. In 1944 Stanley promoted him to assistant under-secretary of state and in 1947 Arthur Creech Jones promoted him to deputy under-secretary of state. As such, early in 1948 he led the discussion in Paris between French and British officials on closer economic co-operation between the colonies of the two countries, including the building of better communications between neighbouring territories. Later that year he presided over similar discussions with officials of the Belgian ministry for colonial affairs. Although he transferred to the Treasury as third secretary towards the end of the year, his work still had a strong connection with Britain's overseas possessions as, from 1949 to 1951, he led the United Kingdom Treasury and supply delegation in Washington and the World Bank mission to Ceylon.<br>
<br>Caine's career took a different direction in 1952 when he became vice-chancellor of the new University of Malaya. Once again radical innovations were required of him. Instead of one university site where the faculties covered the complete range of subjects, he oversaw the development and expansion of two branches of the university, and witnessed the creation of a third. In 1949 Raffles College had combined with King Edward VII's Medical College to form the basis of a university in Singapore. When Caine arrived in Malaya plans were under way for an expensive transfer to Johore, where a site had already been acquired by the government but not yet transferred to the university authorities. Caine, with the assistance of the then director of the London School of Economics, Sir Alexander Carr-Saunders, drew up a new plan for the Singapore University College to remain a centre for the arts, science, medicine, social science, education, and law, with a separate campus in Kuala Lumpur for teaching agriculture and engineering as well as the arts, science, and medicine. Already Nanyang University College had been hurriedly created for Chinese students who were not sufficiently fluent in English to qualify for places in the University of Malaya. It had a more technical leaning, resembling some American universities. In 1957 Malaya became an independent kingdom and Caine returned to England, having already set in motion the scheme for the branches of the University of Malaya to become separate universities by 1962. While there he had also acted as economic adviser to the chief minister of Singapore, helping to design long-term economic policies to foster the development of local industries, rapid expansion of the social services to the extent that could be supported financially by the colony, and a more even distribution of income. At the same time he was appointed chairman of the Caribbean fiscal commission, which drew up financially viable plans for the support of the administration of the short-lived Federation of the West Indies.<br>
<br>From 1957 to 1967 Caine was director of the London School of Economics, responsible for considerable expansion of its premises and for handling the notorious student protest at the announcement of Sir Walter Adams, principal of the University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, as his successor. Since 1965 Caine had himself served as governor of the Reserve Bank of Rhodesia, created by the British government after Ian Smith's unilateral declaration of independence to handle the external finances of the government of Rhodesia, including colonial administrators' pensions and students' fees. Caine regarded the LSE insurrection as a bid for student power, such as had begun the previous year at Berkeley in the United States, and believed it was fomented in the LSE by American agitators. He had been considering ways to give students a voice in the management of the school, and had sympathy with some of their demands. He exercised reason and firm resolution in dealing with the protesters, until the issue was settled in time for them to sit their final examinations and for him to retire on 30 September 1967.<br>
<br>In retirement, as well as writing several papers on financial matters (including one for the Institute of Economic Affairs advocating &#145;pay television&#146;) and educational principles, he produced one book on the foundation of the LSE and another on the purpose and prospects of British universities, over which he considered the government exercised too much control. As a practical expression of those views he became chairman of the planning board of the independent University of Buckingham, which opened in 1973. The latter was unusual in offering two-year degree courses, the academic year consisting of four, rather than three, long terms.<br>
<br>Caine was created CMG in 1945, KCMG in 1947, a grand officer of the order of Orange Nassau (Netherlands) in 1947, and commander of the order of Dannebrog (Denmark) in 1965. He served as a member of the Independent Television Authority from 1960 to 1967 (deputy chairman from 1964 to 1967); as a member of the International Institute of Educational Planning from 1963 to 1970; and as co-ordinator of the Indonesian Sugar Study from 1971 to 1972. He received honorary doctorates from the University of Malaya in 1956 and from the University of Buckingham in 1980.<br>
<br>Caine was a handsome man with a considerable presence. He was married three times: first on 15 August 1925 to Muriel Ann Maud (<i>d</i>. 1962), daughter of Abner Harris, of 18 Hervey Close, London; second on 23 March 1965 to Doris Winifred (1900/01&#150;1973), daughter of Walter Folkard, of Forest Gate, London; and third in 1975 to Elizabeth Crane Bowyer, daughter of J. Crane Nicholls and widow of Sir Eric Bowyer (1902&#150;1964). There was one son of his first marriage, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/72052/', "Sir Michael Caine (1927&#150;1999)")</script>, and two stepsons and two stepdaughters of his third marriage. Caine died on 2 January 1991; he was survived by his third wife, his son, and his stepchildren. A memorial service was held at St Clement Danes on 2 February 1991.<br>
