<span class="headword">Baldwin,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1615), <span class="occ">music copyist and composer</span>, is of unknown origins and parentage. According to Ernest Brennecke, Baldwin was admitted a lay clerk of St George's Chapel, Windsor, in 1575; he cites no documentary evidence in support of this claim and none exists today, though subsequent repair work on the Windsor records may have obscured it. Baldwin is first mentioned there in 1586&#150;7, when he received his stipendiary &pound;10 p.a. plus 22<i>s</i>. livery money. He supplemented this income by acting as the chapel's music copyist, and additional payments of 20<i>s</i>. were made to him &#145;pro scriptione sacrarum Cantionum&#146; (&#145;for the copying of sacred songs&#146;, that is, services and anthems for the chapel liturgy) in every year for which accounts survive. On 3 February 1594 the lord chamberlain commanded the subdean of the Chapel Royal &#145;that John Bauldwyne of the College of Wynsor shoulde be placed next in ordynarye in Her Majesties Chapple&#146;, and on 23 March 1595 it was ordered that Baldwin be sworn &#145;gentleman in ordinarie (without pay) &hellip; until a tenor's place be voyde, and then he to have and be sworne into wages for the firste and nexte tenor that shalbe admitted&#146;  (Rimbault, 35&#150;6). On 28 March 1596 Baldwin witnessed a promise of good behaviour by another of the Windsor clerks. He finally gained his Chapel Royal position on 20 August 1598, following the death of Robert Tallentire. Baldwin sang at the funeral of Queen Elizabeth, the coronation of James I, and the funeral of Prince Henry. On 9 September 1613 he married Elizabeth Jonson in the church of St George the Martyr, Southwark.<br>
<br>Baldwin is one of the most important and versatile of late Elizabethan music scribes. He was wholly responsible for at least three collections: Oxford, Christ Church, MSS 979&#150;983, a set of partbooks probably started in the late 1570s which contains over 170 pieces, most of them vocal and sacred; his so-called commonplace book  (BL, RM 24.d.2), compiled over a period of roughly twenty-five years from <i>c</i>.1581 to <i>c</i>.1606; and <span class="roman">My Ladye Nevells Booke</span>, an important source of William Byrd's keyboard music, which was finished on 11 September 1591 and is now in the possession of the marquess of Abergavenny. Baldwin also repaired and completed the Forrest&#150;Heyther collection of masses  (Bodl. Oxf., MSS mus. sch. e.376&#150;381), which passed into his hands about 1581. In addition he copied two pieces into Robert Dow's partbooks  (Oxford, Christ Church, MSS 984&#150;988) at the instigation of their then owner, Giles Thompson, who was dean of Windsor from 1603. Baldwin's work is always elegant and usually accurate, though he was occasionally guilty of modernizing the Latin sacred music of earlier generations by filling out its melismatic passages with additional text underlay.<br>
<br>Baldwin's commonplace book includes eighteen of his own compositions, the best-known being his setting of Nicholas Breton's &#145;In the merry month of May&#146;, which was probably sung before Queen Elizabeth at Elvetham House, Hampshire, on 22 September 1591. According to a contemporary account:<blockquote>three excellent Musicians &hellip; disguised in auncient countrey attire, did greet her with a pleasant song of Coridon and Phyllida, made in three parts of purpose. The song, as well for the worth of the dittie, as for the aptnes of the note thereto applied, it pleaseth her Highnesse, after it had been once sung, to command it againe, and highly to grace it with her chearefull acceptance and commendation. (Nichols, 3.116)</blockquote>Many of Baldwin's textless compositions appear to have had a didactic purpose and incorporate complex proportional changes and contrapuntal devices, as in his &#145;upon the plainesong&#146; and <span class="roman">In nomine</span> in five parts. There are also two four-part motets, <span class="italic">Redime me</span> and <span class="italic">Pater noster</span>, in Christ Church, MSS 979&#150;983.<br>
<br>Baldwin died in Southwark on 28 August 1615, possibly of plague, and was buried the following day in the parish of St George the Martyr. Letters of administration were granted to his wife on 7 September. Their son was born some three months later and was baptized John on 1 December.<br>
