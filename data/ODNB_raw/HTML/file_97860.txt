<span class="headword">Hill, Sir  John</span>  (1774&#150;1855), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born at Portsea, Hampshire, in 1774, the second son of Thomas Hill (<i>bap</i>. 1738, <i>d</i>. 1819), foreman of the mastmakers in the royal dockyard, Portsmouth, and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Alms. He entered the navy in September 1781 as captain's steward on the <i>Infernal</i> (bomb vessel) under his uncle Captain James Alms, where he remained until March 1783. From June 1787 until June 1791 he served on the <i>Goliath</i> and <i>Bedford</i> (both 74 guns) in the channel and with the sloop <i>Nautilus</i> on the Newfoundland station, as captain's servant, midshipman, or able seaman. On 24 June 1791 he joined his uncle again, this time in the <i>Proserpine</i> (24 guns) in the West Indies as master's mate. <br>
<br>Hill was appointed lieutenant on 28 July 1794 and joined the <i>Invincible</i> (74 guns) in the Channel Fleet under Thomas Pakenham, where he served until his appointment on 7 October 1795 to the <i>Juste</i> (84 guns), a French prize that had been taken by the <i>Invincible</i> during the first major battle of the French revolutionary wars on 1 June 1794. He was with the <i>Juste</i> until the Spithead mutiny in the spring of 1797, when he was set ashore together with four other lieutenants. He joined the <i>Repulse</i> (64 guns) in June 1797 but after three months he was appointed flag-lieutenant to Sir John Orde on the <i>Princess Royal</i> (98 guns), part of the Mediterranean Fleet. On 23 May 1798 he was appointed by Lord St Vincent as first lieutenant of the <i>Minotaur</i> (74 guns) under Captain Sir Thomas Louis and took part in the battle of the Nile during which, in his own words, he was &#145;slightly wounded but did not return myself as such never having left my quarters&#146;  (TNA: PRO, ADM 9/36/1868). His ship received the surrender of the <i>Aquilon</i> (74 guns) after a two-hour duel and Nelson directed him to take command of the <i>Aquilon</i> and sail her to Lisbon. He was confirmed as commander on 8 October 1798 and left the <i>Aquilon</i> in November 1798. <br>
<br>Hill's first full command was of the <i>Heroine</i> (32 guns) in February 1800 and he spent two years in the Bay of Biscay and the Mediterranean conveying troops; he also served with the army ashore in Egypt. On 31 March 1804 Hill took command of the <i>Humber</i> (16 guns) in the channel and spent four years conveying troops. In April 1804 he married Lucy (1765&#150;1862), with whom he had three daughters and one son, John Thomas, who became a general and colonel of the Duke of Cornwall's light infantry. In March 1813 he was appointed to the Agency of Transports and in October 1813 resident agent of transport. He spent a number of years in troop transport ships in the North Sea and off the Dutch and French coasts, and in the Baltic where he embarked and disembarked the Swedish army to Pomerania before the battle of Leipzig. In 1815 he disembarked the duke of Wellington's army and materials before the battle of Waterloo &#145;without a single accident to a soldier and with the loss of only two horses&#146;  (TNA: PRO, ADM 9/36/1868). After the battle he took on board the wounded British soldiers and a large number of French wounded and prisoners. On Wellington's recommendation he was promoted to post captain on 28 October 1815 and, at Wellington's request, was sent with the army of occupation to Calais, where for three years all seaborne troop movements were under his direction.<br>
<br>On 18 February 1820, again on Wellington's recommendation, Hill was appointed agent victualler at Deptford, one of the navy's three yards with responsibility for feeding the navy; he was promoted to comptroller of victualling on 3 August 1822 and appointed a victualling commissioner on 6 December 1827. When famine struck the west coast of Ireland in June 1831 he was chosen by Sir James Graham, the first lord of the Admiralty, to be the agent of government to administer relief. Hill's duty was to inquire as to the real state of the distress, its probable duration, and the numbers affected. He was to avoid raising expectations as to the extent of government aid, which was to be strictly limited; he was to encourage local efforts and, above all, ensure that government aid did not stifle the contributions from private charity and the landed interest which, because there was no funded poor law, should be the principal source of relief. In his frequent reports to Graham he made it clear that he had suffered considerable pressure from the proprietors and others and that while he accepted that the distress was very great, it had been exaggerated. On his return Graham wrote to Earl Grey that Hill &#145;has been so much abused by the Irish landlords whose hands he kept with difficulty out of the public purse, that I propose to ask the King to knight him as a proof we approve his conduct&#146;  (Graham to Grey, 25 Aug 1831, CUL, MS 26, bundle 6). Hill received his knighthood from the king on 31 August 1831. <br>
<br>Hill was appointed captain superintendent of the victualling and dockyards at Deptford on 12 June 1832. When famine again struck Ireland in 1836 Hill was sent to Donegal in July, this time under the direction of Thomas Spring Rice, the chancellor of the exchequer. His instructions were to establish the exact state of the distress and to ensure that government relief was limited strictly to that necessary for the preservation of human life. The onus of providing relief was to be placed on local proprietors. On his return to England in October 1836 he was able to tell Spring Rice that he had saved the crown a considerable sum. After only six months back at Deptford, Hill was sent by Spring Rice in March 1837 to take charge of government relief for the people of the highlands and islands of Scotland, where there was a severe famine caused by crop and potato failure. Considerable funds were raised by public subscription, and in his four months in Scotland he spent only &pound;7000 of the &pound;10,000 he had been allocated by government for the purchase of seed. He toured the distressed districts to establish if government aid was required for food and he reported it was not; the people, he said, were very healthy, indeed in a far superior condition to those he had seen in Ireland, though he made some unfavourable comments on their industriousness as crofters  (Hill to Spearman, 7 June 1837, TNA: PRO, T 1/4201). The destitution committees in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Aberdeen and the government praised his efforts, as did the queen, who expressed &#145;her gracious approval&#146;  (Spring Rice to Hill, 11 Aug 1837, NL Scot., MS 1054, fols. 197&#150;200). Hill was granted a civil list pension for his service in Ireland and Scotland. <br>
<br>In 1838 Hill moved from Deptford to be captain superintendent of the dockyard at Sheerness, where his responsibilities included the command of the guard ships <i>Ocean</i> and <i>Temeraire</i>. He was the last captain of the <i>Temeraire</i> before its removal for demolition as marked by J. M. W. Turner's celebrated painting. He returned to Deptford in 1842, and in 1845, at the outset of the potato famine in Ireland, Sir Robert Peel sought his advice as to relief arrangements, but he was not called on to take charge of famine relief. On his retirement from Deptford in 1851 Hill moved to Walmer; Wellington promised to do everything in his power to make Hill's residence there agreeable, and he appointed Hill captain of Sandown Castle, the last person to hold that position. He was promoted rear-admiral of the blue on 2 April 1851 and of the white on 28 May 1853. He died of old age at his home, Walmer Lodge, Walmer, Deal, Kent, on 20 January 1855 and was buried at St Mary's, Walmer.<br>
<br>Hill's naval career was marked not by heroic exploits in ships of the line but rather by a reputation for intelligence, reliability, solidity, and integrity earned in the less colourful, but nonetheless vital, area of transport and supply. These qualities, and the support of the duke of Wellington, commended him to the governments that appointed him to &#145;three special missions in Ireland and Scotland&#146;  (TNA: PRO, ADM 9/36/1868) at times of famine.<br>
