<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bancroft,  Ian Powell</span>, Baron Bancroft  (1922&#150;1996), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born at Risedale Maternity Home, Barrow in Furness, Lancashire, on 23 December 1922, the only son of Alfred Ernest Bancroft (1886&#150;1954), a schoolmaster who later became an inspector of schools, and his wife, Lilian, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stokes (1889&#150;1977). He was educated at Coatham School, Cleveland, where he became head of school, and from where he won a scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford, to read English. Graduating with a second-class degree in 1942, he immediately joined the rifle brigade, serving with the 7th armoured division throughout the landings in Normandy and the advance through France and Germany. Demobilized with the rank of captain in 1945, he returned briefly to Balliol College for a year's further study.<h2>
<a name="Civilservicecareer"></a>Civil service career</h2>Bancroft joined the civil service in 1947 as one of the &#145;reconstruction&#146; entrants and was posted to the Treasury, where he was quickly marked out as someone who had the potential to go very high in the service. He was soon made private secretary to Sir Henry Wilson Smith, a second secretary, and then assistant private secretary, first under William Armstrong and then under Louis Petch, to the chancellor of the exchequer, R. A. Butler. When Butler left the Treasury on becoming lord privy seal in December 1955, he took Bancroft with him as his private secretary; he later described Bancroft as &#145;the best Private Secretary I ever had&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>). Before returning to the Treasury Bancroft served a spell in the Cabinet Office. Once back in the Treasury he was promoted to assistant secretary in the public expenditure divisions. In 1964 he became principal private secretary to the chancellor of the exchequer, first to Reginald Maudling and then, on the change of government, to James Callaghan. Meanwhile, on 28 June 1950 he had married Jean Hilda Patricia Swaine (1925&#150;2013), daughter of David Richard Swaine, an inspector of schools. They had two sons and a daughter, and enjoyed a long and very happy marriage.<br>
<br>On leaving the private office in 1966 Bancroft was promoted to under-secretary in the establishment side of the Treasury. Following the recommendations of the Fulton commission on the civil service, this part of the Treasury was hived off in 1968 to become the major part of the newly created Civil Service Department, under William Armstrong as permanent secretary and head of the home civil service. Bancroft's duties there included responsibility for the machinery of government division of the Civil Service Department, which was involved in the many proposals to change the functions of departments and the boundaries between them in which successive prime ministers liked to indulge. One of the several major departmental changes in which he played an important part at this time was the proposed amalgamation of three departments&#151;housing and local government, transport, and public building and works&#151;to form the Department of the Environment. Once the decision to amalgamate was taken Bancroft was sent to the Department of the Environment to assist the process by being appointed its director-general of establishments on promotion to deputy secretary. He had the task of overseeing the merging of the central organizations of three departments with quite different structures, traditions, and priorities, into a single co-ordinating division. Such mergers inevitably affect adversely the career prospects of many individuals and can damage staff morale generally. Bancroft was helped by the fact that he was an outsider and not suspected of favouring one of the merging departments against the others. By 1972 he had helped his permanent secretary to create a well-integrated department which was functioning well and in which morale was high. He had as a result gained a reputation as an organizer and manager who was particularly good in the field of staff relations, and this strongly influenced the rest of his career.<br>
<br>Bancroft's success at the Department of the Environment led to his next step when, at the end of 1972, he was moved to customs and excise with the expectation that he would take over as head of that department when its permanent secretary, Sir Louis Petch, reached retiring age a few months later. There was, however, a change of plan as the Civil Service Department needed him back. Sir William Armstrong, its permanent secretary, was being used by the prime minister, Edward Heath, as his principal adviser on economic policy, in preference to relying on the Treasury. The main economic problem facing the government was how to reduce the level of unemployment, which was regarded as unacceptably high, yet at the same time contain the rising pressure in the economy on costs and prices. The government was attempting to deal with these problems by a strategy which combined a relatively expansionary fiscal policy with a tight control of public sector pay (and later of pay and prices generally). This involved actions which breached previous understandings about the principles governing civil service pay, and was not only producing unrest and low morale in the civil service generally but also a call for industrial action by some members of civil service unions. Armstrong did not have the time to deal with these civil service problems. A new post of second permanent secretary was therefore created in the Civil Service Department, and Bancroft was brought back to fill it on promotion. He made his primary objective the removal of some of the resentment and ill feeling among civil servants, by demonstrating that civil service managers were aware of the problems that the civil service unions were experiencing and by seeking through negotiation in the civil service Whitley councils to find ways of dealing with the more sensitive issues. While he was successful in improving relations between civil service managers and staff, this could not lead to any major change in the Heath government's policies, which became more rigid with the passing of legislation to enforce the control of prices and incomes. Even with some relaxation after the change of government in early 1974, the inherent conflict between central government economic strategies and the traditional way of negotiating public sector remuneration remained. The continuing problems of the economy at large meant that pay issues, low morale, and industrial unrest would overhang civil service management for many years and severely affect the last period of Bancroft's civil service career.<br>
<br>At the end of 1975 Bancroft went back to the Department of the Environment as its permanent secretary. It had already seemed likely that he would become the next head of the home civil service and that a spell as a departmental permanent secretary would provide him with valuable experience. In the Department of the Environment he had again to deal with issues that required sensitive handling. Relations between central and local government were deteriorating. The Layfield report on local government had pointed to the excessive dependence of local government on central government finance, and had recommended major changes in the financing arrangements in order to give local authorities more independence and responsibility. These proposals, while welcomed by local government bodies, were not in the circumstances of the time acceptable to central government. Local authorities were already increasingly overspending the public expenditure allocations agreed by ministers, and the government feared that this tendency would be augmented by greater independence. With public expenditure as a whole growing faster than central government wanted, the mood at the centre was for more rather than less control of local government spending, particularly in the context of general public expenditure cuts in 1976. Local authorities were therefore becoming both disappointed and resentful.<br>
<br>The general direction of policy towards local government fell to the Department of the Environment, although other Whitehall departments had degrees of responsibility for some services administered through local government bodies. Bancroft's experience of working with departments in the context of Treasury expenditure control was valuable in securing the co-ordination and cohesion of the approaches of central government to local government issues, and at the same time he quickly established good personal relationships with local government leaders. In most respects the amalgamation of departments into the Department of the Environment, which Bancroft had earlier done so much to bring about, had proved to be one of the more successful changes in the machinery of government.<br>
<br>The decision of the prime minister in 1976 to split the Department of the Environment and create a separate Department of Transport therefore came as a great shock to Bancroft, as it seemed to be about to destroy the work of many civil servants over several years. However, close and friendly co-operation between Bancroft and Peter Baldwin, who became permanent secretary of the Department of Transport, enabled a number of collaborative functions to be retained, especially the maintenance of common staff lists and a common staffing organization. Once again Bancroft's way of discussing issues with his colleagues and the staff associations concerned, and his sensitive handling of the staff most affected by the change, reduced the upset created by the reorganization.<br>
<br>Bancroft's experience and achievements made him a strong candidate to succeed Sir Douglas Allen as head of the home civil service when Allen retired at the end of 1977. But by then the continuing problems of morale and increasing militancy over pay issues in the civil service were having to be handled in a political environment which had become far more critical of all aspects of public administration. On appointment as head of the civil service Bancroft found that the economic situation and policies of the time gave very little room for manoeuvre. His problems increased with the change of government in 1979. The new prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, was determined to improve the efficiency of the civil service by bringing in private sector methods and by cutting staff numbers. She was very critical of what she regarded as the negative attitudes of senior civil servants when they were made to contemplate new ideas. Bancroft accepted that the civil service would have to be reduced substantially and that the Civil Service Department would have to play a key role in that reduction, but he felt that the management problems with which his senior colleagues would have to grapple as numbers were reduced and posts eliminated were insufficiently understood in no. 10. His attempt to persuade the prime minister that some of her criticisms of senior civil servants were unfair was seen as an example of the weakness which the prime minister believed permeated government departments generally and the Civil Service Department in particular. He persuaded the prime minister to give a dinner to permanent secretaries at which he hoped that a better understanding might be achieved, if problems could be discussed informally in a relaxed atmosphere. It proved to be a disaster. The explanation of difficulties merely persuaded the prime minister that very few of the permanent secretaries were &#145;one of us&#146;, and she ended the dinner unexpectedly early. From that moment Bancroft's position became increasingly untenable.<br>
<br>The prime minister's decision in November 1981 to abolish the Civil Service Department and divide its functions between the Treasury and the Cabinet Office brought to an abrupt end the concept of a separate department for civil service affairs which had been the major recommendation of the Fulton commission's report of 1969. Bancroft's distinguished career as a civil servant came to a premature and distressing end along with his department. It also permanently affected the balance of top civil service posts. The functions of the head of the civil service were initially divided between the secretary of the cabinet and the permanent secretary of the Treasury as joint heads of the service, but on the subsequent retirement of the then permanent secretary of the Treasury, Sir Douglas Wass, in 1983, the cabinet secretary became the head of the civil service. Bancroft was bitter about the decision to abolish his department but accepted it with dignity, and did what he could to ensure that his colleagues did not suffer unduly. In recognition of his public services, in 1982 he was offered and accepted a life peerage (he had already been made CB in 1971, KCB in 1975, and GCB in 1979). He became a cross-bencher.<h2>
<a name="Postcivilservicecareer"></a>Post-civil service career</h2>After leaving the civil service Bancroft took on a number of non-executive directorships, including the Rugby Group, Grindlays Bank, Bass, and Sun Life (of which he had a spell as deputy chairman). He was a visiting fellow of Nuffield College, Oxford, from 1973 to 1981, and chairman of the Royal Hospital and Home, Putney, from 1984 to 1988. Despite these commitments, however, he continued to devote attention to civil service affairs, and in speeches and lectures expressed his concern that the unity and integrity of the civil service was being endangered by over-rapid changes, the full consequences of which had not been adequately considered. He became a very effective speaker on these issues in the House of Lords, where his turn of phrase and keen wit injected a sharp sting into his criticism of government policies affecting the public services. Especially irate about the Conservative government's proposal in 1996 to privatize the recruitment and assessment agency of the civil service commission, he played a very persuasive role in the debate on that proposal in the House of Lords, which led to a government defeat in the relevant vote there and to the setting up of a select committee of the House of Lords to report on the public service. But by that time Bancroft was too ill to serve on that committee himself. He lived to see the special report of the select committee, which recommended that the recruitment and assessment agency should not be privatized, and the rejection of that recommendation by the government, which gave a contract to a private company. In February 1999 the Labour government announced that the selection stages of the fast stream recruitment process would be returned to direct civil service management when that contract expired in 2001; Bancroft would have been delighted.<h2>
<a name="Character"></a>Character</h2>As a civil servant Bancroft was conscientious and hard working, calm, and fully in control, taking care to plan and organize his work in co-operation with his colleagues, and an excellent team leader. He was well liked and highly regarded by all his staff and colleagues and by the ministers he served, especially valued for his support as a private secretary. He was always concerned about the well-being of those who worked with him and saw great virtues in the long-established traditions of the civil service, as typified in many of the senior officials under whom he had worked in his younger days. Having entered the civil service at a time when memories of wartime co-operation between government and both sides of industry were strong and there was a high degree of consensus on economic policy issues, he always looked for ways to find solutions to problems by securing agreement on policies after dispassionate analysis. The integrity of the service, the absence of corruption, and the outlawing of patronage were objectives he fought for and was prepared to defend against all proposals he regarded as damaging to them. He became head of the civil service when many of those traditions he valued were being questioned, and he greatly regretted his inability to persuade politicians that some of the proposed changes affecting the service could be severely damaging both to standards of service and to the integrity of government. Unlike many of his colleagues he appeared to enjoy being cross-examined by parliamentary committees about the work of his departments, seeing this as an opportunity to foster a better understanding of departmental objectives. By contrast, however, in the light of the difficulties he experienced, he was reluctant to be interviewed by the media while a civil servant, and warned his senior colleagues against undue exposure. But he no longer felt the need for such restraint after he had left the civil service, and he became a very effective participant and campaigner in various public causes. He died at Trinity Hospice, London, on 19 November 1996, of liver cancer, and was cremated on 25 November. He was survived by his wife and three children.<br>
