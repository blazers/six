<span class="headword">Butler <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Reid]</span>,  Lois</span>  (1897&#150;1970), <span class="occ">aviator and skier</span>, was born on 3 November 1897 at 275 Drummond Street, Montreal, Canada, the only daughter and second of the five children of Sir William Duff Reid (1866&#150;1924) and his wife, Minnie Cormack (<i>d</i>. 1949). Taken to Canada in 1873, when his father undertook railway projects, William Duff Reid later joined him on the Canadian Pacific Railway. On the death of Reid senior in 1908 he became president of the Reid Newfoundland Co. Ltd, based at St John's.<br>
<br>Lois Reid was sent to England to be educated at Abbots Langley School, and returned in 1913 to complete her education at Havergal College, Toronto. She met her future husband, Lieutenant-Colonel Hugh William Knox-Niven (<i>d</i>. 1923), when he arrived as aide-de-camp to the governor of Newfoundland. They married in 1918; there was one daughter of this marriage, which ended in 1923 with Knox-Niven's death. In 1925 Lois married Alan Samuel Butler (1898&#150;1987), chairman of the De Havilland Aircraft Company. He ran an air-survey firm in Newfoundland and had been involved in carrying the first airmails there. They had a daughter and a son. Alan Butler owned a succession of De Havilland aircraft in which he toured and raced. In 1928, with Lois as passenger, he set a world speed record for two-seater light aeroplanes, of 119.77 m.p.h. In 1929 Lois gained a private pilot's licence (no. 1963), and in the following year acted as second pilot to her husband, flying a twin-engined Gloster Survey biplane (G&#150;AADO) from London to Cape Town. Designed for aerial survey and photo-mapping by De Havilland for the Aircraft Operating Company, Cape Town, the AS31 was a unique aircraft required for an urgent four months' contract to cover 63,000 square miles in Northern Rhodesia. The Butlers left Heston Aerodrome on 20 March 1930, accompanied by an engineer, the plane laden with spare parts. Lois kept a diary and photographic record of the 8000-mile trip, which involved twenty-three stops for refuelling and repairs and took twenty-seven days. They arrived in Cape Town on 15 April, Lois having undertaken approximately one quarter of the flying each day. On her return she competed in the king's cup air race and the Europa <i>Rundflug</i>, a 7000 mile race around Europe.<br>
<br>The years between the wars were truly golden for those with means, leisure, and a sense of adventure; the Butlers possessed all these. Lois Butler joined the Kandahar Ski Club in 1930 and, already a first-class skier, was awarded her gold K in 1931 and an alpha for downhill racing in 1933. The UK was largely responsible for starting downhill and slalom racing, and Lois was a member of the British ladies' team, taking part in European ski championship meetings that later became world cup events. When Canada sent a team to these international ski meetings she naturally transferred her affections and ski prowess to the Canadian team, representing Canada at the 1936 winter Olympics at Garmische Partenkirchen, and many other important international meetings, until all sports came to a full stop with the advent of the Second World War.<br>
<br>By 1939 Lois Butler had accrued over 300 hours as a pilot and was among the first eight women asked to join the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA), formed in September to ferry aircraft from the manufacturers' airfields to RAF bases. A reluctant Air Ministry had finally agreed that women pilots could be allowed to fly small trainer aircraft, and by the bitter January of 1940 they were ferrying open Tiger Moths from the factories. The weather and visibility was always bad, but spring found them adept at flights from the south of England to the north of Scotland. The group having proved itself, Lois Butler was among the first to be selected later that year for conversion to light operational aircraft at the Central Flying School of the RAF. As the pressures of war increased so did the intake of women to the ATA, and eventually they were flying all types of operational aircraft. By VE-day (8 May 1945), Lois Butler had flown more than 1000 hours, handling 36 types of Royal Navy and RAF aircraft, including the Mosquito, the fastest of them all. This was a range of experience obtained by very few service pilots.<br>
<br>After the war the Butlers sold their home in London and the family moved to Salisbury, Rhodesia. They also acquired tobacco farms near Bulawayo, but Lois did not settle, and they returned to Studham Hall, in Bedfordshire, leaving their son, David, in Rhodesia. Lois Butler returned to skiing at the Kandahar Club, renewing her friendships in Europe. The summers were spent sharing her husband's passion for boats; they would go down the French canals to the Mediterranean each summer and visit the Greek islands. It was during one of these holidays that Lois Butler died, of a heart attack, in Piraeus, Greece, on 17 August 1970. She was buried in St Mary's Church, Studham.<br>
