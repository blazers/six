<span class="headword">Radcliffe,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1650, <em>d.</em> 1714), <span class="occ">physician and philanthropist</span>, was born in Wakefield, Yorkshire, the son of George Radcliffe, governor of the Wakefield house of correction (1647&#150;61) and a man of strong republican principles, and Sarah, daughter of Mr Louder, a prosperous Wakefield resident. He was baptized at All Saints, Wakefield, on 1 May 1650. Radcliffe claimed that he was a kinsman of the Catholic earl of Derwentwater. As Radcliffe's father had numerous children he initially intended that his son pursue trade or agriculture; however, members of the neighbouring gentry and clergy noticed John's cleverness and persuaded the father to send him to the local grammar school, where he proved an apt pupil. He matriculated at University College, Oxford, on 23 March 1666 as a batteler, or exhibitioner, on the freestone foundation, and in 1667 was made senior scholar on account of his success in the logic school. He graduated BA on 26 October 1669 and became a fellow (until 1677) of Lincoln College as no vacant fellowship was available in University College. He then pursued courses in botany, chemistry, and anatomy, receiving an MA with &#145;uncommon applause&#146;  (<span class="italic">Biographia Britannica</span>) on 7 June 1672. During his time at Lincoln he was supported in part by his mother, his father having died. He then enrolled for degrees in physic and received his BM on 1 July 1675, after which he promptly began a medical practice from his college rooms. He possessed few books and disparaged those who relied on old medical treatises, preferring instead contemporary texts, particularly those of Thomas Willis, then England's most influential medical authority. When visited in his rooms as a medical student by Ralph Bathurst, master of Trinity College and a former experimental collaborator of William Harvey and Willis, who asked Radcliffe the location of his study, he supposedly pointed to a few vials, a skeleton, and a herbal. University contemporaries valued his wit and vitality rather than his scholarship, observing that he had little interest in contemplative pursuits.<br>
<br>Throughout his career Radcliffe expressed himself with a candour that at times verged on rudeness. As a bachelor of medicine he offended James Lydall, an eminent Oxford practitioner (and early colleague of Willis), as well as John Luffe, later regius professor of physic, and two apothecaries. None the less, Radcliffe's early success with patients soon persuaded the apothecaries to keep his prescriptions in their files. Radcliffe gained a reputation early on for success in treating smallpox, which was epidemic in Oxfordshire in the late 1670s. In contrast to most other practitioners, who used external heat in their treatment, Radcliffe adopted Sydenham's &#145;cooling treatment&#146; for the disease, which was then unorthodox. Rapid recovery of some smallpox patients who Radcliffe had treated by this means enhanced his reputation. More significant, however, was his success with Lady Spencer, a well-connected but chronically ill woman then living near Oxford at Yarnton. She had been under Dr Lydall's and Mr Musgrave's care with little success and had not been ambulatory for years when she first saw Radcliffe. However she started walking within three weeks of his first consultation, and her recommendation of Radcliffe to her numerous noble relatives established him as a pre-eminent local practitioner within two years of his taking the bachelor's degree. He graduated DM on 5 July 1682 as a &#145;grand compounder&#146;, a designation that referred to his accumulation of substantial wealth. In 1684 he moved to Bow Street, Covent Garden, London, where he soon established a lucrative practice, earning, his apothecary Francis Dandridge said, 20 guineas a day within his first year. His timing was propitious, for the court reputation of Richard Lower, a well-known Covent Garden physician who had succeeded to Willis's practice upon the latter's death in 1675, was declining owing to his outspoken support of whig principles. In 1686, two years after arriving in London, Radcliffe succeeded in being appointed principal physician to James II's daughter, Princess Anne of Denmark. He became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians on 12 April 1687, where he opposed physician, poet, and whig notable Samuel Garth in his successful campaign to have the college sponsor the first English dispensary for the deserving poor.<br>
<br>Radcliffe's eighteenth-century biographers noted that his appealing and often witty conversation attracted patients as much as his clinical skill. A frequenter of fashionable coffee houses, Radcliffe was known to love wine. At times his wit could be coarse. For example, a hypochondriacal nobleman who had befriended Radcliffe sent him repeated requests for a consultation, only to receive the reply eventually that &#145;his Lordship did not know when he was well, for he was in perfect health, if he would but think himself so&#146;. Finally, though, Radcliffe visited the man, who told him he had a &#145;strange singing&#146; in his head. &#145;If it be so&#146;, Radcliffe reportedly replied, &#145;I can prescribe to your Lordship no other remedy than that of swiping your a&#151; with a ballad&#146;, a response that &#145;perfectly cured his Lordship's malady&#146;  (<span class="italic">Biographia Britannica</span>, 3453). At other times Radcliffe's intended jests crossed the boundary of acceptable levity. Having successfully treated William III for symptoms of dropsy, including leg swelling, in 1697, Radcliffe was called by the king for advice on a recurrence of the illness in 1699. Apparently the monarch had not followed Radcliffe's earlier advice for temperance, and the physician found him with an emaciated body but swollen lower legs. When William III asked him his opinion of the legs Radcliffe reportedly replied: &#145;Why truly, I would not have your magesty's two legs for your three kingdoms&#146;, a jest that terminated his presence at William's court  (<span class="italic">Biographia Britannica</span>). However, despite his occasional conversational blunders with social superiors Radcliffe, who was &#145;a confirmed Jacobite and violent tory&#146;  (Sakula, 256), was capable of political caution. When James II's daughter and son-in-law, Princess Anne and Prince George of Denmark, abandoned her father's cause and joined the prince of Orange (later William III) in Nottingham in 1688, Radcliffe was encouraged by the bishop of London to visit her there as she was in an advanced stage of pregnancy. Radcliffe demurred, citing a need to attend his critically ill patients in London. However, his contemporary biographer, William Pittis, attributed this behaviour to Radcliffe's reluctance to declare himself at a politically unstable moment. Radcliffe was elected MP for Bramber in Sussex and sat for the borough until the dissolution in 1695.<br>
<br>Even though William III appointed his countryman, Bidloo, as his chief physician, Radcliffe's court practice continued to prosper after the departure of James II. When two of William's foreign attendants, William Bentinck, afterwards earl of Portland, and William Zulestein, earl of Rochford, became seriously ill and recovered after Radcliffe's ministrations, William rewarded him with 500 guineas and an appointment as one of his physicians at a salary of &pound;200 p.a. Aware that William's tenure was new and, perhaps, not secure, Radcliffe declined the appointment. None the less he continued to be called to court and stated that he received &pound;600 per year for the period 1688&#150;99 from the king alone. In 1691 William, duke of Gloucester, the two-year-old son and heir of Princess Anne and Prince George, experienced &#145;fainting fits&#146; (seizures), a malady that had proved fatal to some of their other children. Radcliffe agreed to care for him provided that Princess Anne and her sister, Queen Mary, rely on him exclusively for medical advice. The child recovered and did not experience additional fits, an outcome that brought Radcliffe a reward of 1000 guineas. In 1695 William III directed Radcliffe to attend the earl of Albemarle, one of the king's favourite commanders, who had then been ill on the continent for two months with fever. When the patient recovered within a week the king gave Radcliffe &pound;1200 and the offer of a baronetcy, while Albemarle gave him 400 guineas and a diamond ring. (Radcliffe declined the title.) Although he experienced some investment losses, notably &pound;5000 on a failed East Indies shipping venture in 1692, Radcliffe calculated his remaining wealth in 1692 at &pound;30,000 and at &pound;80,000 in 1707. He acquired estates in Buckinghamshire, Yorkshire, and Northamptonshire, and had paintings by Rembrandt and Rubens in his house in Bloomsbury Square, London.<br>
<br>Part of Radcliffe's medical reputation rested on his ability to make accurate prognoses, which he often delivered bluntly. When Queen Mary developed smallpox in December 1694 the privy council called for Radcliffe. Reviewing her treatment regime before seeing her Radcliffe pronounced her &#145;a dead woman&#146;, saying that it was impossible to save her because the treatments she had received from others assured her demise. She died soon after. Late in 1697 he told William III that he would live a maximum of four more years regardless of his medical regime. William died in 1702. In 1699 the duke of Gloucester became ill with what his physicians, Edward Hannes and Bidloo, judged to be smallpox. When the youth's condition worsened Radcliffe was called. He despaired of the duke's recovery and accurately predicted the time of his death to the hour, but not before indulging in his custom of disparaging the skill of the other physicians. Radcliffe's impolitic manner lost him a position as Princess Anne's principal physician. Reportedly he accepted a summons to see her in 1695 but then failed to appear, justifying his behaviour by saying that her illness was &#145;nothing but the vapours, and that she was in as good a state of health as any woman breathing, could she but give into the belief of it&#146;. A contemporary said he did not appear because he &#145;was too addicted to the bottle&#146;  (<span class="italic">Biographia Britannica</span>, 3457). None the less, when Anne became queen and seemed critically ill her physicians consulted secretly with Radcliffe and used his prescriptions, for which he was paid handsomely by the government.<br>
<br>A lifelong bachelor, Radcliffe acknowledged one marriage proposal. It failed, however, for though the woman brought a dowry of &pound;15,000 and the balance of her parents' estate on their deaths, she was pregnant by a family bookkeeper. In breaking the engagement Radcliffe's letter to her father of 19 May 1693 expresses his characteristic sauciness:<blockquote>The hounour of being ally'd to so good and wealthy a person as Mr. S&#151;d has push'd me upon a discovery that may be fatal to your quiet, and your daughter's reputation, if not timely prevented. Mrs. Mary is a very deserving gentlewoman, but you must pardon me, if I think her by no means fit to be my wife, since she is another man's already, or ought to be. In a word, she is &hellip; actually quick with child, which makes it necessary that she be disposed of to him that has the best claim to her affections. &hellip; Hanging and marrying, I find, go by destiny; and I might have been guilty of the first, had I not so narrowly escaped the last. (<span class="italic">Biographia Britannica</span>, 3456)</blockquote>At the age of fifty-nine Radcliffe became enamoured of a patient, Miss Tempest, on whose account he refurbished his coach and servants' liveries. Addison, writing under the name Aesculapius, ridiculed him for this in the <span class="italic">Tatler</span> of 21 and 28 July, and 13 September 1709.<br>
<br>In 1713 Radcliffe was elected MP for Buckingham and began recommending the physician Richard Mead to his patients. In the same year he purchased a mansion at Carshalton, Surrey, which later became St Philomena's Convent School. Radcliffe died in semi-disgrace, his final three months shadowed by a recurrence of contentious behaviour toward his most venerable royal patient, Queen Anne, who died on 31 July 1714. During her final hours one of her intimates, Lady Masham, sent for Radcliffe. Suffering from a severe episode of gout and learning beforehand from Mead that the queen's case was hopeless, Radcliffe declined to attend. Also, he said that in view of the queen's antipathy to him his presence might worsen her final moments, adding later in a letter that he would have come if the request had come from the proper authorities. Subsequently an old friend, Sir John Pakington MP, moved that Radcliffe be censured by the House of Commons for his failure to serve the queen, but the matter dropped. Radcliffe suffered an apoplexy while at church and died at Carshalton on 1 November 1714, having accurately predicted the date of his demise in a letter of 15 October 1714. His body lay in state at Carshalton until the 27th, and was then moved to Oxford, where it was buried on 3 December in St Mary's Church.<br>
<br>Although Radcliffe described himself as avaricious and was known to be a slow payer of debts and not above cadging drinks, he was also known for his generosity to those in need, particularly members of the clergy. His will, dated 13 September 1714, provided substantial annuities to his sisters and other relatives. He left the bulk of his estate to University College in trust for building and operating a library (completed 1747), enlargement of college buildings, two medical travelling fellowships, and faculty annuities. Executors of additional trusts used the funds to build the Radcliffe Infirmary, the Radcliffe Observatory, and the Lunatic Asylum, Oxford. Additional substantial contributions were made to the building of the Royal College of Physicians (in Pall Mall East), and St John's Church, Wakefield. He also bequeathed &pound;500 a year to St Bartholomew's Hospital, London. In 1811 it was decided that the Radcliffe Camera should be limited to books on medicine and natural science. A larger library was eventually needed, and in 1901 the Radcliffe Science Library was opened and extended in 1934 with the aid of a Rockefeller grant. In 1715 Jean Gagnier published an elegy on Radcliffe's death, <span class="italic">Exequiae clarissimo viro Johanni Radcliffe MD</span> (1715). A gold headed cane, said to have been Radcliffe's, was given to the Royal College of Physicians by Mrs Baillie.<br>

<a name="cosubject_22986"></a><span class="headword">John Radcliffe</span>  (1690&#150;1729), <span class="occ">physician</span>, seems to have been no relative of his namesake. He was the son of John Radcliffe of London, gentleman, and his wife, Ann, and was born on 10 May 1690; he was admitted to Merchant Taylors' School in 1703. He matriculated at St John's College, Oxford, on 17 October 1707, and became BA on 2 June 1711, MA on 23 April 1714, and DM on 30 June 1721. On 25 June 1724 he was chosen a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians; he was physician to St Bartholomew's Hospital. He died on 16 August 1729.<br>
