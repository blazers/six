</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Back, Sir  George</span>  (1796&#150;1878), <span class="occ">naval officer and explorer</span>, was born on 6 November 1796 at Stockport, Cheshire, the second son of John Back and his wife, Ann. He entered the navy as midshipman of the <i>Arethusa</i> in 1808. He was present at the destruction of the batteries at Lequeitio, northern Spain, and, after being repeatedly under fire, in 1809, while on a cutting-out expedition with the <i>Arethusa</i>'s boats, he was taken prisoner by the French at Deba. The prisoners were sent to San Sebastian, and Back was small enough to be carried in one of the panniers of a sumpter mule across the Pyrenees. While a prisoner at Verdun, he studied mathematics, French, and drawing. In the winter of 1813&#150;14 he travelled on foot through a large part of France, and on reaching England was appointed midshipman to the <i>Akbar</i>, in which he served against the French on the North American station. The <i>Akbar</i> was dismasted in a hurricane off Cape Hatteras, and nearly foundered. In 1816 she was paid off, and in 1817 Back was appointed Admiralty mate of the <i>Bulwark</i>.<br>
<br>In 1818 Back volunteered for service in the <i>Trent</i>, under Sir John Franklin, who was then entering on the first modern voyage of discovery in the Spitsbergen seas. On his return he rejoined the <i>Bulwark</i>, but in 1819 he set out with Franklin on his expedition by land to the Coppermine River, attempting to determine the latitude and longitude of the northern coast of North America, and the trend of the coast east of the Coppermine. In that terrible expedition it was largely owing to Back's dauntless determination that the party survived. At Fort Enterprise, Franklin sent him back to Fort Providence, and he was in imminent danger of starvation on the way. In five months he travelled 1204 miles on snow-shoes, with no other covering at night in the woods but a blanket and a deerskin, frequently at -48 &deg;F and once at 67 &deg;F below zero, and sometimes without food for two or three days at a time. Later on, when Franklin was in dire straits, he again sent Back to get help from the Indians, and after incredible exertions and sufferings, and after seeing one of his companions die, he succeeded just in time to save Franklin's life. On returning to England he was made lieutenant on 1 January 1821.<br>
<br>In 1823 Back was appointed to the <i>Superb</i>, and sailed to the West Indies. In 1824, while at Lisbon, he was invited to join Franklin's expedition to the Mackenzie River, and hastened to do so, joining Franklin in London in December 1824. On that 1825&#150;6 expedition he rendered Franklin notable service, especially in his dealings with the Inuit, and on coming home in 1827 he found that he had been promoted commander on 30 December 1825. His repeated applications for a ship met with no response, and he went to Italy to improve himself in the arts. At Naples in January 1832 he heard of the supposed loss of Captain Ross in the Arctic regions, and offered the Royal Geographical Society to go in search of him. He had been informed by Copper Indians on his previous journey of the existence of a river rising in the neighbourhood of the Great Slave Lake, and debouching on the Polar Sea, and by tracing this river to its mouth he hoped to make his way to Regent's Inlet, where he thought Captain Ross might be. The council accepted his offer, and grants from government and Hudson's Bay Company, supplemented by a public subscription, financed the expedition, on which Back set out from Liverpool with only one companion of his own rank, Dr Richard King, as surgeon and naturalist, in February 1833.<br>
<br>Back's instructions were, in brief, firstly to make for the sea by the aforesaid river and, if possible, aid Captain Ross, and, secondly, to survey the coast as far as possible. The first winter he spent at Fort Reliance&#151;a house that he constructed near the Great Slave Lake, when himself half-starved and amid starving Indians. In April he received news of Captain Ross's arrival in England, but he was ordered to push on to the river and survey the coast from there to Cape Turnagain. His first difficulty was to discover where the river lay, and to avoid embarking on the wrong one. The name of it was Thlew-ee-choh-deeseth, or Great Fish River (later known as the Back River). His journey down it is vividly recounted in his <span class="italic">Narrative of the Arctic Land Expedition to the Mouth of the Great Fish River, in 1834 and 1835</span> (1836), illustrated by his sketches. The ice prevented Back's proposed survey of the coast, and after again wintering at Fort Reliance he reached La Ch&ecirc;ne, the Hudson Bay station where he had started over two years before, in August 1835, having travelled 7500 miles, including 1200 of discovery. Besides his discovery of a river over 440 miles long, he had made important observations of the Aurora Borealis, and had given the name of Montreal to an island afterwards sadly familiar in connection with the fate of Franklin.<br>
<br>In September 1835 Back reached England, and received a hero's welcome. He was awarded the Royal Geographical Society's gold medal, and was promoted by the Admiralty to the rank of captain on 30 September 1835, by order in council&#151;an honour that no other officer in the navy had received except William IV. In February 1836 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. Also in 1836 he was, at his own proposal, appointed to the command of an expedition, the object of which was to complete the coast line between Regent's Inlet and Cape Turnagain. Back was given command of HMS <i>Terror</i> and the expedition set out in June 1836. The ship became trapped in ice; Back described the voyage in his <span class="italic">Narrative</span>, a book that captures much of the drama of Victorian Arctic exploration.<br>
<br>Few sailors ever survived more terrible perils and hardships than Back did on his expeditions. &#145;Arctic work&#146;, as Lord Brougham said of Franklin, &#145;had got into his blood&#146;, and he could not resist a challenge. Not surprisingly, his body reflected the demands made upon it, and after his last expedition he was for six years more or less an invalid, and never sailed again. In 1837 he received from the Royal Geographical Society both its medals. In March 1839 he was knighted; in 1844 he became president of the Raleigh Club (the Royal Geographical Society's exclusive dining club) and in January 1847 he was elected FRS. He also received the gold medal of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de G&eacute;ographie de Paris (1835). He was employed by government to report on the harbour of Holyhead, but afterwards lived in retirement on half pay. On 13 October 1846 he married Theodosia Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1861), widow of Anthony Hammond of Savile Row, London. He was a vice-president and long on the council of the Royal Geographical Society, and contributed many reports. He continued an active interest in Arctic exploration, and served on the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95281', "Arctic council")</script> that advised the Admiralty on the search expeditions for Franklin. Back and nearly all his fellow members of the council were wrong about the location of the missing men, so the Admiralty sent expeditions to the wrong places. With the end of the Franklin search, Back again withdrew into quiet retirement. He was made rear-admiral in March 1857, vice-admiral in September 1863, and admiral in October 1876, and in June 1854 he became DCL at the University of Oxford. Expeditions sometimes engender rivalry and recrimination. To his critics, Back was vain, dandyish, a womanizer, charming to persons from whom he hoped to gain, but &#145;intensely selfish, sly and sycophantic&#146;  (Holland, 27). However, to his admirers, who included the British public, he was in bravery, intelligence, and love of adventure the very model of an English sailor. He died at his home, 109 Gloucester Place, Portman Square, London, on 23 June 1878 and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery. His paintings, drawings, and sketches from his expeditions are an invaluable historical record.<br>
