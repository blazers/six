<span class="headword">Campbell <span class="st"> [<em>married names </em>Hurd, Howe]</span>,  Dorothy Iona</span>  (1883&#150;1945), <span class="occ">golfer</span>, was born on 24 March 1883 at 1 Carlton Terrace, Edinburgh, the daughter of William Campbell, a metal merchant, and his wife, Emily Mary Tipper. Her father was a native of Edinburgh, but her mother was born in England and they were married in London in 1861. She had several older siblings, all of whom were born in Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Dorothy Campbell learned to play golf at North Berwick, about 20 miles east of Edinburgh, under the instruction of the renowned Ben Sayers. She is reported as stating that she began playing at the age of ten and won her first medal when she was twelve. In 1897 the British ladies' championship came to Scotland for the first time and Dorothy's older sister reached the quarter-final stage. The Campbells did not venture out of Scotland to compete in subsequent years, so Dorothy's d&eacute;but in championship golf was at the age of twenty. In June 1903 she played in the inaugural Scottish ladies' close championship at St Andrews and reached the semi-finals. In May 1904 the British championship was played at the Scottish links of Troon. Dorothy represented Scotland for the first time in the preceding matches against England and Ireland, beating both her opponents. She then advanced to the semi-finals of the championship, where she was defeated by Lottie Dod, the eventual winner.<br>
<br>On 25 May 1905 at Cromer in Norfolk, Dorothy Campbell took part in the historic first international between the British Isles and America, which inspired the eventual establishment of the biennial Curtis cup matches, and she contributed to the overall victory of the home side. This match was followed by the ladies' internationals between England, Ireland, and Scotland, in which she again won both matches. Then in the British championship she won the preliminary stroke competition and again reached the semi-finals. After returning home, she took her first Scottish title with a nineteenth-hole victory over the holder, Molly Graham, on her home course of North Berwick.<br>
<br>In 1906 Campbell made her third appearance in the semi-finals of the British championship and retained her Scottish crown. In 1907 her form early in the season boded well. She took first place on both days of the Ranelagh stroke-play tournament in April, leading Scotland to victory in the international division. However, a bout of influenza the week before the British championship meeting forced her withdrawal from the ladies' internationals and ruled her out of contention for the championship. Nevertheless, she subsequently managed to reach the final of the Scottish close, though she lost the title to Frances Teacher.<br>
<br>The British championship was held at St Andrews in May 1908 and Dorothy Campbell contested the final against her fellow Scottish international Maud Titterton. They attracted a gallery of several thousand spectators, including the famous open champion Old Tom Morris, who died two days after the final. In adverse weather conditions which made the course almost unplayable Titterton squared the match on the final hole and won the championship on the nineteenth. Campbell went on to take the Scottish close title for a third time.<br>
<br>1909 was a pivotal year in Dorothy Campbell's career. In May at Birkdale she led Scotland to victory in the ladies' internationals before taking the British championship title for the first time, at the age of twenty-six. She then contested her fifth consecutive Scottish close final, losing 3 and 1 to Elsie Kyle. In the autumn she crossed the Atlantic to compete in the US ladies' championship at the Merion cricket club, Philadelphia. In the final she defeated Nonna Barlow to become the first player to win the two most important titles in ladies' golf, the British and US championships. After this achievement she settled in Canada, taking up residence in Hamilton, Ontario.<br>
<br>As a result of her move Campbell was unable to defend her British title in 1910. However, in that year she won the first of three consecutive Canadian ladies' championships in Toronto before travelling to Chicago, where she successfully defended her US title, also winning the preliminary stroke-play event. In 1911, accompanied by four North American golfers, she sailed from New York to Glasgow on board the <i>Caledonia</i> to take part in the British championship at Portrush in Ireland. Just days after her arrival she lined up for Scotland in the ladies' internationals, but lost both matches, to May Ross (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Hezlet) of Ireland and Cecil Leitch of England. However, her form evidently improved over the next few days, as she advanced through the championship to defeat Violet Hezlet, a local player, by 3 and 2 in the final, confirming her status as the best female golfer in the world. Though she retained the Canadian title later that year, she lost at the semi-final stage of the US championship to Margaret Curtis by 4 and 3.<br>
<br>After winning her third and final Canadian title in 1912, Campbell married J. V. Hurd on 11 February 1913. She went to live in Pittsburgh and her golfing career took second place to motherhood. However, she managed some notable performances in the late 1910s. In 1916 she won the preliminary stroke-play event at the US championship, and two years later at Pinehurst, North Carolina, she took the North and South championship, an important event in the American golfing calendar. She won the North and South for a second time in 1920 and reached the final of the US championship, where she was defeated by the defending champion, Alexa Stirling. A third win in the North and South came in 1921, when it is said that during the final she twice holed out from 40 yards using a goose-necked mashie she called Thomas.<br>
<br>In or about 1923 Mrs Hurd moved to Philadelphia and joined the Merion cricket club, where she had won her first US title. At about this time she recognized that her style of golf, with no wrist movement, a two-fisted grip, and a broad swing, was somewhat out of date. While it produced a straight but short shot, those using more modern techniques were gaining more length. Under the guidance of the professional at Merion, George Sayers, son of her old mentor at North Berwick, she adopted the Vardon grip and greater hand action. In September 1924, at the Rhode Island country club, she put her new style into action to remarkable effect, winning her third US championship. At the age of forty-one she became the oldest winner in the championship's history, a record that still stood at the end of the twentieth century.<br>
<br>Dorothy Campbell Hurd visited the British Isles in 1928, played on the Scottish international team for the first time since 1911, and reached the quarter-finals of the British championship. After returning home she made her last appearance in the semi-finals of the US championship at Hot Springs, Virginia. On her last competitive visit to Britain in 1930 she again lined up for Scotland in the ladies' internationals, winning two matches by 7 and 6 and losing the third by one hole. She later married Edward Howe. She died tragically on 20 March 1945 when she fell underneath an express train as it left Yemassee, South Carolina. She had been staying over the winter at the Tidalholm guest house in Beaufort, South Carolina, and had planned to take the train for New York. A funeral service and cremation took place at Ardsley, New York, on 24 March.<br>
<br>Dorothy Campbell was the first woman golfer to score major victories on both sides of the Atlantic and thus the first to make a truly international impact on the game. Her two British, three US, and three Canadian titles, won before the advent of women's professional golf, secure her position among the greatest female players in the history of the sport. In 1978 she was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame, and in 1991 her name was added to the Canadian Golf Hall of Fame.<br>
