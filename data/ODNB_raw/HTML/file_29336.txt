<span class="headword">Whitworth,  Charles</span>, Baron Whitworth  (<em>bap. </em>1675, <em>d.</em> 1725), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was possibly born at Blore Pike, near Eccleshall, Staffordshire, and was baptized on 14 October 1675 in his maternal grandfather's church at Wilmslow, Cheshire. He was the eldest of the six sons of Richard Whitworth (<i>d</i>. 1718) of Blore Pike, and his wife, Anne, the daughter of the Revd Francis Moseley. He spent his childhood at the family home of Batchacre Park, Adbaston, Staffordshire. After Westminster School (queen's scholar, 1690) he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1694 (BA 1699, fellow 1700). On graduation he became secretary to George Stepney, envoy at Berlin, who had attended the same foundations and who was at that time the best-informed Englishman in the affairs of the Holy Roman empire. In this expertise Whitworth was Stepney's successor, and already in November 1701 was &#145;fitly qualified&#146; to act as British aide to Cardinal Lamberg, the Holy Roman emperor's chief commissary at the congress of Regensburg. In February 1702 Whitworth's warrant was signed, but that &#145;these credentials [were] ready sooner than his money&#146; was, as for all contemporary British diplomats, Whitworth's plight now and throughout his career  (BL, Add. MS 37353, fols. 1&#150;3).<br>
<br>Whitworth stood in for Stepney at Vienna when the latter was absent from his ambassadorial duties there, until in September 1704 he was appointed envoy-extraordinary to Russia, where, so Tsar Peter I commented to Whitworth in May 1705, &#145;for some considerable time no Englishman had appeared with a public character&#146;. Whitworth on his journey from Vienna had been able to meet high incidental expenses only by drawing heavily on his father, expenses exacerbated by time spent discovering the tsar's whereabouts. His initial commission was to attempt regularization in Anglo-Russian commercial relations by remedying the Russia Company's mismanagement of its award (1698) of the tobacco monopoly in Russia. A commercial treaty with Russia was not achieved in Whitworth's lifetime, but that the tobacco monopoly business was resolved between 1707 and 1711 owed much to his assiduity and resource. In 1708 he had to handle Russian sensibilities over an arrest for debt in London of the tsar's emissary, Matveyev, who had been sent to Queen Anne in 1707 to seek British mediation in the Great Northern War between Tsar Peter and Charles XII of Sweden, when the power of the latter was increasingly threatening the very survival of Petrine Russia. But the triumph of Russian arms over Sweden at Poltava in July 1709 transformed the scene in eastern Europe, and recognition of this change was signalled in London by Whitworth's elevation to ambassadorial status in February 1710.<br>
<br>While Whitworth remained formally accredited to Russia until November 1712, the course of events in northern and eastern Europe necessitated commissions for him in Berlin, Vienna, the Palatinate, and The Hague. Augustus of Saxony-Poland, with electoral responsibilities newly accorded by the new emperor, Charles VI, was himself a participant in the Great Northern War, with consequent prejudice to British commercial interests in Danzig; Tsar Peter's peripatetic activity in Brandenburg and Bohemia following his Turkish peace of July 1711 and Russian resentment at the Western powers' apparent disregard of Russia's Balkan vulnerability furnished Whitworth with sufficiently demanding briefs between May and October 1711. Already in 1710 the elector of Hanover, statutorily designated successor to the ailing Queen Anne, and the future George I, had entered into a friendship treaty with Russia with an eye to territorial gains from Sweden in Germany. However, in the face of Russian importunacy Whitworth always upheld the primacy for Britain of her friendship with Sweden, and on 15 April 1711 he wrote to Henry St John with a summary of the current Russian temper: &#145;on one side their vanity and insatiate desire for new conquests, on the other the fear of losing what is already gained, hang on them like an ague&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sbornik</span>, 61.177). His <span class="italic">Account of Russia as it was in the Year 1710</span>, though not published until 1758, was soon available in manuscript to the ministry at home. Succinct and perceptive, it was a survey of Petrine Russia which held its readership through to the century's end and beyond. Though a whig by affiliation, Whitworth afforded unimpeachable counsel to the tory government on his return home in 1713 as to how a beleaguered Sweden might be cajoled into an accommodation with her Western allies.<br>
<br>In April 1714 Whitworth was posted to Augsburg to observe the Franco-imperial peace negotiations at Baden that summer, and in the autumn he returned to Regensburg as British minister to the imperial diet. This accreditation lasted until August 1716, when he was appointed envoy at Berlin. In May 1717 he was seconded to The Hague on account of the stubborn refusal of the Dutch to respect the British trade embargo with Sweden and their obdurate adherence to neutrality in international affairs following the costly war with France. Whitworth was also instructed, along with Admiral Sir John Norris, to undertake a mission to the tsar while he was in the United Provinces, its purpose being to further a commercial treaty without a political commitment, and to steer the tsar away from blandishing France and opening his own channel of communication with Charles XII. Whitworth from the outset was sceptical about the mission, which indeed yielded no result; but from then until his return to Berlin in May 1719 he remained in the United Provinces, endeavouring through the thickets of Dutch internal politics to implicate the republic with its formal allies Britain and France (the triple alliance) in plans to serve the interests of the emperor, Charles VI, not only in the contentious Southern Netherlands but against Spain in the Mediterranean (the projected Quadruple Alliance). In November 1717 Whitworth was frustratedly to observe &#145;this state jogs along like a resty jade, a whip and a spur make him advance a step or two, but 'ere you are aware he stops short again and your trouble is to begin&#146;  (C. Whitworth to G. Tilson, 8 Nov 1717, TNA: PRO, State Papers Holland 258).<br>
<br>Whitworth's return to Berlin in 1719 was occasioned by Lord Stanhope's success in London in finally overcoming Hanoverian antagonisms towards Prussia. In 1720 he married the comtesse de Vaulgremont (<i>d</i>. 1734), the daughter of a government official in French-speaking Flanders; the marriage was childless. He was raised to the Irish peerage as Baron Whitworth of Galway in January 1721 and entered parliament in 1722 as a member for Newport, Isle of Wight. Whitworth had remained at Berlin until June 1722, opining that &#145;as for the Czar himself, all England has to wish is only a common intercourse of civility and trade. All further engagements are unnecessary and may be dangerous&#146;  (C. Whitworth to C. Townshend, 14 Oct 1721, TNA: PRO, State Papers Prussia 90/15). Though a sick man, he served at the congress of Cambrai (1723&#150;5), an attempt to resolve imperial issues outstanding since the formation of the Quadruple Alliance. This was rendered abortive by the Madrid&#150;Vienna axis of 1725. He died at his house in Gerard Street, London, on 23 October 1725 and was buried on 6 November in the south aisle of Westminster Abbey. His barony lapsed on his death. His friendships suggest an engaging and sagacious man, but Whitworth was firstly a most accomplished diplomat and an unsurpassed interpreter of the Russia of his day.<br>
