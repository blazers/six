<span class="headword">Goodchild,  John</span>  (1697&#150;1756), <span class="occ">linen draper and philanthropic society administrator</span>, was born early in the year 1697. Nothing is recorded of his parents but he had a brother Thomas who was a purveyor of dairy produce to the royal household. John Goodchild was described as a gentleman of the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields when, on 14 July 1720 at the church of St Nicholas Cole Abbey, London, he married Isabella Wray (1693&#150;1731) of Masham in Yorkshire, sister of Sir John Wray, twelfth baronet.<br>
<br>Goodchild's residence and business premises were on the north-east corner of Charing Cross. His first son, John, born the year after his marriage, probably grew up as an apprentice in his father's business but the second, Cecil Wray, born in 1729, and the third, Robert, born in 1730, both attended Westminster School. His wife, Isabella, died in 1731 and four years afterwards he purchased a house and a copyhold estate at Teddington in Middlesex. At Teddington, Goodchild maintained a &#145;factory&#146;, a warehouse, and a large &#145;Bleachfield for Scotch and Irish Linen&#146;  (Rocque). He employed spinners and weavers throughout a large area of west Middlesex. A justice of the peace for the county Goodchild took an interest in local government and he was a regular attender at the Teddington church vestry. He supported the incumbent, Stephen Hales, in his schemes to rebuild the church and enlarge the churchyard, funds for this purpose being raised by the sale of pews; Goodchild bought one for his family and two for his employees. His son Cecil Wray, who had graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1751, was ordained priest in September 1753 and soon after was appointed curate to Hales at Teddington.<br>
<br>At this time Hales was assisting William Shipley (1715&#150;1803) in his plan to establish a society for the encouragement of arts, manufactures, and commerce, and he persuaded Goodchild to attend the foundation meeting at Rawthmell's Coffee House, Henrietta Street, Covent Garden, on 22 March 1754 [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94594', "Founders of the Society of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce")</script>]. One of only eleven original members, Goodchild became closely involved in the work of the institution, attending ten of the fifteen meetings held up to February 1755, a total exceeded only by Shipley and Husband Messiter. When officers were first chosen on 5 February 1755 he was named as treasurer of the society. The society's income from subscriptions was &pound;360 19<i>s</i>. in 1755 and &pound;632 2<i>s</i>. in 1756. Most of these sums went in rewards to artists and inventors but there were also small administrative expenses and the rent for the society's premises. Goodchild gave his time to all these matters. He advocated the giving of a premium for buff leather, and kept the society informed of the value of Hales's ventilating machines on ships. He proposed Peter Woulfe (1727&#150;1802), chemist and inventor, as a member. When Goodchild died at Teddington in the last few days of December 1756 the society was well prepared for the remarkable growth in its national and international standing that characterized the subsequent decade.<br>
<br>Goodchild's burial took place at St Mary's churchyard, Teddington, Middlesex, on 3 January 1757 and his death was reported to the Society of Arts on 5 January when Shipley took over the office of treasurer until the younger John Goodchild was chosen to succeed to the office. The latter had been granted administration of his father's estate on 11 January 1757, but proved unsuccessful in business and was declared bankrupt in 1759 when the society, having suffered a small loss in his accounts, abolished the office of treasurer.<br>
