<span class="headword">Stone,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1481), <span class="occ">Benedictine monk and chronicler</span>, is known almost solely for the chronicle that he compiled while a monk in the cathedral priory of Christ Church, Canterbury. He was a member of that house for over sixty years, but never achieved higher offices than those of refectorar (1451), sub-sacrist (1457), and third prior (1461). In 1468, no doubt as a reflection of his general seniority, he was placed by the prior at the head of the choir.<br>
<br>Stone's chronicle survives in a single manuscript, now Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS 417. It was edited by W. G. Searle in 1902. At its front is the statement that it is the book of John Stone, who composed it in 1467, in the fiftieth year of his monastic life. This statement is in a different hand from that of the main part of the text, most of which therefore cannot be autograph. The chronicle begins at 1415, and yet Stone only became a monk in December of either 1417 or 1418 (there are apparent discrepancies of date between the main list of Christ Church professions and Stone's own chronicle); for the first two or three decades the text is almost entirely made up of obituary notices of Christ Church monks. Stone must therefore have drawn upon some record now lost&#151;perhaps that used by his brother monk Thomas Cawston, whose own collection of summary obituaries of Christ Church monks is dated 1466  (Canterbury Cathedral, MS Lit. D. 12).<br>
<br>Stone indicates his use of Christ Church registers, chapter ordinances, letters, and a martyrology; he must also have drawn increasingly on his own powers of observation and memory, and presumably on notes of his own, as the chronicle drew closer to the time of its compilation. Stone's focus is always on his own monastic convent, and he usually provides a note on each member of the house at the time of his death, but he gradually widens his scope to include major events in the life of the monastery, such as visits by monarchs. In 1440, for instance, he records that Henry VI came on foot to Canterbury, as a pilgrim, and at the twelfth hour after vespers was received at the door of the church by the prior and convent in white copes. He provides particularly full accounts of the enthronements of successive archbishops, and is also informative in his coverage of funeral services held at Christ Church.<br>
<br>From the 1460s Stone shows a greater tendency to report events outside the priory precincts, whether elsewhere in Canterbury (such as the absence of a boy bishop in the town's grammar school, in December 1464), or in other parts of England (such as the battles of Barnet and Tewkesbury in 1471). He comments that the prior of Christ Church was present at neither the coronation of Edward IV, in 1461, nor that of Elizabeth Woodville, in 1465. His perspective is always that of the claustral monk, devoted to his house and its religious observance, but his touch can be vivid as well as direct. He is tantalizingly brief, however, in his statement that a malign spirit entered the priory's belfry during a storm in the summer of 1458.<br>
<br>The chronicle stops in 1472, after two entries for February. There is an entry in yet another hand for an event in October 1472 (but no mention of the death of Prior William Petham in August that year), and then nothing more. However, Stone lived on for about another eight years, dying about 1480, and certainly by April 1481.<br>
