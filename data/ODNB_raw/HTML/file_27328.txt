<span class="headword">Thomson,  William</span>  (1746&#150;1817), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born at Burnside in the parish of Forteviot, Perthshire, the son of Matthew Thomson, carpenter and farmer, and his wife, the daughter of Mr Miller, the schoolmaster of Avintully, near Dunkeld. He was educated at the parish school, at Perth grammar school, and at St Andrews University, which he entered at the age of fifteen, despite his family's very limited means. There he was made private librarian to the university chancellor, Thomas Hay, earl of Kinnoull, who encouraged him to study for the church and promised him a parish in his patronage. Having completed his theological studies at St Andrews and, later, at Edinburgh University, Thomson was ordained on 20 March 1776 as assistant to James Porteous, minister of Monivaird, Perthshire, but he soon displayed tastes and affinities discordant with his office. He did not always confine himself within the bounds of ascetic puritanism, and the parishioners made urgent complaints about his irascible temper and his taste for sensual and social pleasures. He eventually resigned his post, on 1 October 1778, and settled in London as a man of letters.<br>
<br>At first unsuccessful, for several years Thomson depended mainly on an annual income of &pound;50 granted by the earl of Kinnoull. At length he won notice and regard by his successful continuation of Robert Watson's <span class="italic">History of Philip III of Spain</span> (1783), for which he wrote the fifth and sixth books. On 31 October of the same year he received the honorary degree of LLD from Glasgow University, and he soon had his hands full of work. For the next thirty-five years he wrote on a great variety of subjects, producing pamphlets, memoirs, elaborate biographies, voyages, travels (in Europe, Asia, and Africa under the names of Thomas Newte, Sergeant Donald Macleod, or Andrew Swinton), commentaries on the <span class="roman">Bible</span> scripture (under the name of Harrison), and treatises on national history, such as the <span class="italic">History of Great Britain from the Revolution of 1688 to the Accession of George</span> (1787), or on military tactics (<span class="italic">Memoirs Relative to Military Tactics</span> [1805]). He seems to have avoided verse but he essayed into novels and dramas. Most of these had a decidedly philosophical bent, such as <span class="italic">The Man in the Moon</span> (1783), a satirical novel in the manner of Swift, where a lunar sovereign visits the earth, comments on man's intellectual and artistic achievements, and meets Charles Fox, or <span class="italic">Mammuth, or, Human nature displayed on a grand scale, in a tour with the tinkers into the central parts of Africa</span> (1789), a travel book intended to demonstrate the adaptability and universality of man's intellectual and social faculties. Besides writing under his own name Thomson collaborated with others and he appears to have used many different pseudonyms. From 1790 to 1800 he prepared the historical part of <span class="italic">Dodsley's Annual Register</span>. From 1794 to December 1796 he owned the <span class="italic">English Review</span> and largely furnished its contents with political and literary articles. In a letter to Dr Parr (1 March 1792), much reprinted and circulated, he defended the principles of the French Revolution, but not its methods, and advocated progressive changes. The <span class="italic">English Review</span> was later incorporated into the <span class="italic">Analytical Review</span>. Thomson also wrote for the <span class="italic">European Magazine</span>, the <span class="italic">Political Herald</span> (where, in articles signed Ignotus, he supported Fox's policies and party), <span class="italic">The Oracle</span>, and the <span class="italic">Whitehall Evening Post</span>, for which he wrote a weekly report of parliamentary debates. Thomson was twice married: his first wife was Diana Miltone, a Scot; his second was a minor novelist, of whom no other details are known. There were children of both marriages, two sons and two daughters in all. A man of great and varied ability and very wide attainments, Thomson could always produce respectable and sometimes even excellent results, but he had no extraordinary literary ambition or perseverance. Thomson died at his home at Kensington Gravel Pits, London, on 16 February 1817.<br>
