<span class="headword">Lindsay,  Ludovic</span>, sixteenth earl of Crawford  (<em>d.</em> 1652), <span class="occ">royalist army officer</span>, was the third son of Henry Lindsay, thirteenth earl of Crawford (<i>d</i>. 1620&times;23), and Margaret, sister of Sir James Schaw of Sauchie. Ludovic Lindsay sought a career as a mercenary officer, and is said to have &#145;gained honour abroad in the Swedish, Austrian, and Spanish services&#146;  (G. Wishart, <span class="italic">Memoirs of James, Marquis of Montrose</span>, 1893, 132). He was a colonel in Swedish employment in 1632, and later in the 1630s he levied a regiment of 3000 for the Spanish service through a commission from the Spanish ambassador in Vienna. After two years' service the regiment, then reduced to about 300 men, was disbanded in Burgundy. Lindsay subsequently spent six months in Madrid in an unsuccessful effort to get payment of his arrears. On 4 January 1639 he was in Vienna and, having newly inherited the earldom of Crawford from his elder brother, was intending to return to Britain and seek employment from Charles I. He took his seat in the Scottish parliament on 31 August 1639, but spent most of the bishops' wars of 1639&#150;40 in England, and evidently commanded a unit of Scots who had enlisted to fight for the king.<br>
<br>Crawford was with Charles I in Edinburgh when the king sought a compromise settlement with the covenanters in 1641, being one of a group of ardently royalist but ill disciplined and loud-mouthed nobles and officers whose threats of violence seriously embarrassed the king. They were convinced that the marquess of Hamilton, the king's leading adviser, was betraying his interests, and in September Lord Kerr, when drunk, dispatched Crawford, &#145;his no less furious and drunken second&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie</span>, 1.391), to accuse Hamilton of being a traitor. In October he attained further notoriety for his part in the obscure plot against Hamilton and the earl of Argyll known as &#145;the Incident&#146;. Crawford confessed that he had said of Hamilton &#145;if he wes ane traittor, I wish he hed the reward of ane traittor&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fourth Report</span>, HMC, appx, 167) and other witnesses attested that while it was planned to arrest the two nobles, Crawford favoured their assassination. Apart from a few days under arrest Crawford escaped punishment for his follies, both king and covenanters deeming it inexpedient that the Incident be investigated too closely for fear that evidence revealed might disrupt the settlement being negotiated.<br>
<br>At this point Crawford decided that there was no future for him in Scotland. His title of earl had brought him no lands or other property, and he may have planned to return to the life of a mercenary officer on the continent. Whatever his motivation he agreed to a regrant of his earldom (15 January 1642) on new terms, whereby if he died without leaving a legitimate son to succeed him the title earl of Crawford would pass to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16706/', "John Lindsay, first earl of Lindsay")</script>, a distant kinsman. John Lindsay coveted the title of Crawford as it was the senior title of the Lindsay kin, of which he was the most prosperous and powerful member, and Crawford was willing to give him (perhaps in return for financial help) a chance of gaining it. That Lindsay thought the deal worthwhile strongly suggests that Crawford was unmarried at this point and appeared unlikely to have a son, but in or before October 1643 Crawford married Margaret Graham, daughter of the earl of Airth and Menteith and widow of Alexander Stewart, Lord Garlies. Moreover Crawford remained in Britain, for the English civil war brought him opportunities for employment and a chance to redeem his reputation. He fought for the king at the battle of Edgehill (23 October 1642), and served under Sir Ralph Hopton against Sir William Waller in central southern England in 1643. He contributed to Waller's defeat at Lansdown (5 July), but on 13 December he was surprised by Waller at Alton, near Farnham, and escaped with only a few men, nearly 1000 being captured.<br>
<br>In April 1644 Crawford took part in Montrose's attempt to provoke a royalist rising in Scotland, and with him was forced back into England after the initial capture of Dumfries. He was with Montrose at the siege of Morpeth in May, but was captured in Newcastle when it fell to the Scottish army on 19 October. Crawford was sent to Edinburgh and imprisoned, having already been excommunicated by the church and forfaulted (deprived of his title and property) by the Scottish parliament (26 July). In royalist eyes he remained earl of Crawford until his death, but the covenanters declared that the title had passed to the earl of Lindsay (now Crawford-Lindsay). The sixteenth earl and other royalists were freed after Montrose's victory at Kilsyth on 15 August 1645 had temporarily destroyed the covenanting regime. When Montrose was routed at Philiphaugh on 13 September and forced to flee to the highlands, Crawford took command of his remaining cavalry, and in the months that followed aided his efforts to rebuild a royalist army. On 3 June 1646 he wrote to Charles I of his determination to fight on with Montrose: &#145;I could wish that the litell drops of blood which remains in my bodie unspent might be shede to make your Majestie a glorious and happie prince&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hamilton MSS</span>, 1.110), but in August he, like Montrose, was forced to flee abroad. He reached Paris by way of Ireland, and there on 9 October he laid before Queen Henrietta Maria a plan by Montrose to raise 30,000 men to conquer Scotland, invade England, and free Charles I from imprisonment. The grandiose scheme came to nothing, but Crawford did not give up. In May 1647 he was in Ireland, and converted to Roman Catholicism before leaving to make another attempt to get help to revive the war in Scotland  (<span class="italic">Commentarius Rinuccinianus</span>, ed. S. Kavanagh, 1932&#150;49, 2.753). However, by April 1648 he was in the service of Spain, and landed in Ireland to seek to recruit troops for the Spanish service. He is said subsequently to have commanded an Irish regiment in Spain, and at the end of 1649 a report reached Scotland that he was living in Spain, being &#145;in great honor and credit&#146;, and having a &#145;very great deall of money&#146;  (<span class="italic">Various Collections</span>, 5.250). However, he is said to have left Spain in poverty in 1651&#151;though, mysteriously, also to have had a frigate operating from St Malo which had taken one or two prizes  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1651&#150;2</i>, 3). The following year he led fifty Scottish officers who had served under Montrose in guarding the cardinal de Retz during the Fronde. He died in October or November 1652 in The Hague &#145;of an ague and fever&#146;  (<span class="italic">Nicholas Papers</span>, 319).<br>
<br>Virtually nothing is recorded of Crawford's character or personal life. In seeking to serve Charles I his intemperate antics in 1641 were damaging, but his services in the English civil war, his tenacity in adversity alongside Montrose in 1645&#150;6, and his efforts to renew the war thereafter reveal more solid military virtues. His wife, Margaret, joined him in exile, and was with him in Spain in 1649, when she &#145;also turned Catholicke Romane&#146;  (<span class="italic">Various Collections</span>, 5.250). Their only known child, Henry, was aged twelve in 1657 when he was expelled from the Scots College at Douai since (for reasons unknown) he was deemed illegitimate.<br>
