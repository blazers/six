<span class="headword">Wanley,  Nathaniel</span>  (1632/3&#150;1680), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and poet</span>, was baptized on 27 March 1633 in St Martin's parish, Leicester, second of the five children of Samuel Wanley (1605&#150;1658), mercer and briefly mayor of Leicester, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1610), daughter of Richard Benskin of Wanlip and his wife, Mary. Samuel died suddenly in November 1658, shortly after his appointment as mayor of Leicester. He had earlier apprenticed all four of his sons as mercers, and it fell to Nathaniel to pay off the principal for his own apprenticeship and that of his elder brother, Samuel, a debt that afflicted him &#145;above twenty years after&#146;  (Nichols, 4, pt 2.1048).<br>
<br>During his childhood Wanley attended the sermons of moderate godly preachers such as John Angell, town lecturer at St Martin's from 1628 to 1651. On Angell's death in 1655 Wanley wrote that the preacher had overcome the divisiveness of the times and drawn &#145;crowds from all sides&#146; with his &#145;sweet becoming gravitye&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems</span>, 77&#150;8). Another such figure was John Bryan, vicar of Holy Trinity, Coventry, from 1644 to 1662 and afterwards a gifted trainer of nonconformist ministers. His house in St Martin's was leased to the church for the use of its vicar from about 1648. Wanley was later to describe Bryan, probably his closest friend, as &#145;a Person of such Real Worth, as is as hard almost to express as imitate&#146;  (N. Wanley, <span class="italic">Peace and Rest for the Upright</span>, 1681, 27).<br>
<br>Unlike his brothers, Wanley did not follow the family trade but matriculated at Peterhouse, Cambridge, as a pensioner on 21 December 1649. His entry to the college, like that of John Bryan's four sons, was no doubt assisted by the connection between Bryan and the then master of Peterhouse, Lazarus Seaman. The two men had been contemporaries at Emmanuel in the 1620s, and together attended Francis Higginson's godly seminary at Leicester after graduating. On 27 January 1652 Wanley moved to Trinity College, Cambridge, possibly as a result of internal disputes between Seaman and the Peterhouse fellowship. He graduated BA in 1653 and MA in 1657. On 24 July 1655 he was married by John Bryan to Ellenor Burton (1632&#150;1719), daughter of Humphrey, the long-standing coroner and town clerk of Coventry. Of their five children four survived infancy: Ellen, Nathaniel, Elizabeth, and the future librarian and palaeographer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28664/', "Humfrey Wanley")</script>. In his will Wanley asked to be buried alongside the first-born child, Samuel, who died in 1665.<br>
<br>Wanley's first publication, <span class="italic">Vox Dei</span> (1658), is dedicated to Dorothy Spencer, countess of Sunderland, who in 1657 preferred Wanley to the living of Beby, near Leicester. Most of his extant poetry was written by about 1660 or shortly afterwards. His <span class="italic">Scintillulae sacrae</span>, an accomplished body of about forty devotional lyrics, shows the uncommon influence of Henry Vaughan's <span class="italic">Silex scintillans</span> (1650; 2nd edn 1655) as well as that of Herbert, Donne, and Quarles. Like his poetry, Wanley's extant prose (which includes letters from 1667&#150;74) blends the homiletic with the delightful, often citing morally improving passages from Vaughan, Suckling, or Donne. Wanley's advice on spiritual perseverance in <span class="italic">Vox Dei</span>, for instance, is illustrated by what is clearly a moralized paraphrase of lines 7&#150;10 of Donne's &#145;Loves Alchymie&#146; (46). Also surviving are two narrative poems, <span class="italic">Lazarus</span> and <span class="italic">The Witch of Endor</span> (the latter written in the early 1660s), and an Englishing of Latin verses by John Bryan's friend Thomas Dugard, vicar of Barford in Warwickshire.<br>
<br>Before the Restoration, Wanley seems to have been one of the large number of ministers Richard Baxter called &#145;dis-engaged faithful men&#146;: moderate puritans without particular sect or party  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 148). In <span class="italic">Vox Dei</span> Wanley places Archbishop James Ussher first in a list of recently dead &#145;lights of the church&#146;, following him with such moderate presbyterians as Richard Vines and Thomas Hill (master of Trinity until his death in 1653). Wanley's list strongly suggests that in 1658 his religious views were far closer to those of John Bryan and Richard Baxter (both shortly to dissent) than the Restoration terminology of &#145;conformist&#146; and &#145;dissenter&#146; might suggest.<br>
<br>In March 1661 Wanley petitioned Charles II for the living of Lutterworth, Leicestershire, then held by the elderly poet and royalist Thomas Pestell, &#145;whose desire is it that your petitioner should succeed him&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 29/33/71). Wanley signed the subscription book as curate at Lutterworth in September 1662, but on 20 October of that year became vicar of Holy Trinity, Coventry, after John Bryan found he could not, in conscience, remain within the church. Wanley seems to have conformed without difficulty, despite an enduring sympathy with presbyterians. His petition for the Lutterworth rectory describes him as &#145;a true Sonne of the Church of England both to the Discipline and Doctrine of it&#146;, and he was similarly styled in <span class="italic">An Ingenious Contention</span> (1668), a rhymed broadside debate conducted with the dissenting minister and poet Robert Wilde, in which Wanley does his best to encourage Wilde to conform  (TNA: PRO, SP 29/33/71).<br>
<br>A love of religious harmony, nostalgically expressed in his elegy on John Angell (<i>c</i>.1655), was no doubt nurtured in Wanley by his college tutors, James Clarke (Peterhouse) and John Templer (Trinity), both associates of Cambridge Platonists Henry More and Ralph Cudworth. Liberal and adaptable religious views were far from unusual in those educated during the civil war and Commonwealth. The second wave of latitudinarians, including John Tillotson (<i>b</i>. 1630), Edward Fowler (<i>b</i>. 1632), and Isaac Barrow (<i>b</i>. 1630), belonged to Wanley's generation; coinciding with Wanley's time there, Barrow was a fellow of Trinity from 1649 and Fowler during 1653&#150;5. Wanley's religious temper is nicely characterized by his donation to Coventry grammar school (it is not known when) of a manuscript of <span class="italic">The Imitation of Christ</span>: the choice of gift reflects not only Wanley's antiquarian interests and the enduring popularity of the <span class="italic">Imitation</span>, but also the moral emphasis of the Restoration church to which Wanley became a &#145;true Sonne&#146;.<br>
<br>A great deal of Wanley's time at Coventry went into restoring the fabric of Holy Trinity. As well as replacing the old font and eagle lectern removed during Bryan's incumbency, he organized a campaign of fund-raising and church repairs, intensifying efforts after lightning destroyed the steeple in January 1666. Contributors to further repairs in 1673 included Basil Fielding, earl of Denbigh, whose family history Wanley wrote in the early 1670s (printed by Nichols, 4, pt 1). A love of the ministerial calling and its duties emerges in several of Wanley's poems, including verses from the 1660s written &#145;Upon his forced absence from the church, and sight of others going thither&#146; and an earlier poem, &#145;Sunday&#146;, in which a minister imagines angels &#145;bear[ing] a part&#146; in his congregation's &#145;Harmonie&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems</span>, 50, 25).<br>
<br>Despite such job satisfactions, it is clear from his letters that Wanley found Coventry rather dull, and clear from his publications that he found consolation in omnivorous reading. The fruits of his frustration include a translation from Lipsius, <span class="italic">A Discourse of Constancy</span> (1670; repr., 1672) and his work best known to posterity, <span class="italic">The Wonders of the Little World, or, A General History of Man</span> (1678), an exhaustive and carefully documented compendium of human prodigies, which ran to at least six editions in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. In an agreement with his publisher Bassett, Wanley received thirteen copies of the book: six plain bound, six in marble, and one with a blank leaf bound between each printed one to create space for further entries. He died two years later, aged forty-seven, and was buried in Holy Trinity churchyard on 2 December 1680. In his will he endowed an annual Christmas sermon at Trinity, with a fee of 10 <i>s</i>. charged on a house in Bishop Street. <span class="italic">Peace and Rest for the Upright</span>, his funeral sermon for John Bryan, was published posthumously in Coventry in 1681.<br>
