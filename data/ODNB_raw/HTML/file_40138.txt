<span class="headword">Martin, Sir  Harold Brownlow Morgan</span>  (1918&#150;1988), <span class="occ">air force officer</span>, was born on 27 February 1918 in Edgecliffe, Sydney, Australia, the only son and second of the three children of Joseph Harold Osborne Morgan Martin MD, medical practitioner, and his wife, Colina Elizabeth Dixon. He was educated at Randwick high school and at Lyndfield College. An accomplished horseman, he became a cadet in the Australian light horse. In 1937, intent on world travel, he left Sydney as a crew member on a liner. In 1940, in England, he joined the Royal Air Force volunteer reserve.<br>
<br>During his first Bomber Command tour in 455 squadron (Royal Australian Air Force) and 50 squadron (Royal Air Force), flying Hampden, Manchester, and Lancaster bombers, Martin concluded that the most effective way of penetrating enemy defences at night was to disregard regulations and to fly at low level. By questioning higher policy and refusing to allow regulations to hinder chances of success he was already showing a boldness and independence of mind which was to characterize his entire career. His first DFC came in 1942, after twenty-five sorties.<br>
<br>Invited to join 617 (the &#145;Dambuster&#146; squadron) in March 1943, Martin made a significant contribution to its night low-level training for the actual operation. The squadron flew at night at an altitude of 150 feet all the way to its targets and released its bouncing bombs from 60 feet. Martin's bomb exploded short of the dam. He flew down the dam and over the wall three times. Despite damage to the aircraft from anti-aircraft fire, he and his crew supported the following crews and engaged the enemy's guns. The last two pilots' mines exploded successfully against the dam wall. The M&ouml;hne and Eder dams were breached, and the Sorpe Dam damaged. Martin was appointed to the DSO and this was soon followed with a bar to his DFC for his courage and resolution in a costly attack on the Dortmund and Ems Canal. He became 617's acting commander and rebuilt the squadron before handing it over, well trained, to Leonard Cheshire in 1943. He also convinced Cheshire of the feasibility of low-level night target marking, a prerequisite for accurate bombing.<br>
<br>In February 1944 Martin's action during an attack with &#145;Blockbuster&#146; bombs on a heavily defended viaduct in southern France, for which he received a bar to his DSO, was described by Cheshire as the supreme example of inspired fearless night marking. During his last operational tour in 515 night intruder squadron, Martin again distinguished himself, gaining a second bar to his DFC (1944). He then attended the Haifa Staff College in Israel before returning to flying duties in 242 transport squadron (1946). With his war gratuity he bought a horse. In 1944 he married Wendy Lawrence, widow of Flight Lieutenant P. D. Walker, and daughter of Grenbry Outhwaite, lawyer, and Ida Rentoul, artist, of Melbourne. The marriage was very happy; the couple had two daughters.<br>
<br>In 1947 Martin was awarded the Britannia trophy for a record-breaking Mosquito flight (21 hrs 31 mins.) from London to Cape Town, and the following year he received the AFC for his crucial contribution to the first jet crossing of the Atlantic, which was made by an RAF squadron. While serving in London as a squadron leader (1948&#150;51), he began to take an interest in painting (in which he displayed a natural talent), sculpture, and archaeology, subjects he pursued most of his life. From 1952 to 1955, as a wing commander, he was air attach&eacute; in Israel, a post in which he was a success because of his diplomatic flair and grasp of the political complexities of the Middle East. This posting, extended at the Israelis' request, marked a turning point in his career, and steady progress followed.<br>
<br>A rewarding NATO staff post at Fontainebleau in France (1955&#150;8) was followed by a course at the Joint Services Staff College and postings, first as group captain to signals command, and then to Cyprus, where Martin commanded the important Nicosia base. In 1963 he became an air commodore and was posted to 38 support group, where he enjoyed his contacts with the airborne forces but disagreed profoundly with the infantry over the control of the helicopter force. A course at the Imperial Defence College (1965), promotion to air vice-marshal (1967), and a return to Cyprus as the senior air staff officer prepared him for his last command appointments&#151;air officer commanding 38 group (1967&#150;9), then, as air marshal (1970), air officer commanding-in-chief of the RAF in Germany, and commander of the NATO second Tactical Air Force, with its force of Belgians, Dutch, Germans, and British.<br>
<br>Primarily because of frustration in his fight against service cuts, Martin was unhappy in his last RAF post, as air member for personnel at the Ministry of Defence (1973&#150;4). After his retirement in 1974 he spent three years in Beirut and Athens as Middle East marketing adviser to Hawker Siddeley International, before returning to London as a consultant. He was aide-de-camp to Elizabeth II (1963&#150;6) and was appointed CB (1968) and KCB (1971).<br>
<br>Martin, a vital, alert man of medium height, with powerful, humorous eyes, was universally liked and respected. He was a man of great courage who always fought unselfishly for what he believed was right. In 1985 his lifestyle became restricted when he suffered brain damage after being knocked down by a coach, but he bore his lot with fortitude and patience. He died from cancer at his home, 64 Warwick Gardens, Kensington, London, on 3 November 1988. He was survived by his wife.<br>
