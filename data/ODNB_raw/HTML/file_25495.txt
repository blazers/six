<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sibbald,  James</span>  (1747&#150;1803), <span class="occ">bookseller and journal editor</span>, was born at Whitlaw farm, Roxburghshire, the third of the seven children of John Sibbald (1714&#150;1781), farmer, and Margaret Grieve. After attending the Selkirk grammar school he worked as a farmer, grazing his sheep at the farms of Newtown and Borthwickbrae, while living at Whitlaw and reading in his leisure hours such works as Withering's <span class="italic">Botany</span> and Mair's <span class="italic">Book-Keeping</span>, bought from his bookseller cousin Charles Elliot of Edinburgh. At thirty-two he gave up the land for the book trade and journalism, and became a scholar of Scottish literary antiquities.<br>
<br>Sibbald started up in trade by buying the Edinburgh Circulating Library of Mrs Margaret Yair, which formerly belonged to Allan Ramsay. In preparation, he left his brother John and a friend to sell off the sheep, and went to London in February 1779 with money to buy a large stock of books, over the next seven months lodging with a Miss Moore, milliner, at 178 Bishopsgate Street. He inspected circulating libraries, drawing ideas from Thomas Lowndes's and particularly from John Bell's British Library. Sibbald's rapid and intense introduction to bookselling, and to the relationship of the Edinburgh and London trades, can be traced in the letters of Charles Elliot, which contain a torrent of introductions, commissions, and advice. Copyright was one issue. &#145;Dear Jamie,&#146; Elliot wrote early on, &#145;take great care when in company of great London booksellers and offer no books from me that have first been printed in London. You may not be properly acquainted with their fine ideas of Literary property&#146;  (Elliot to Sibbald, 26 April 1779). Sibbald carried out book exchanges and other business around St Paul's Churchyard with John Rivington, Joseph Johnson, and Carnan and Newbery; in Paternoster Row with Thomas Longman, George Robinson, John Bew, and Richardson and Urquhart; in Fleet Street with George Kearsley and John Murray; and in the Strand with John Nourse, John Knox, Thomas Cadell, James Mathews, and Alexander Donaldson; and he also visited William Fox, Thomas Bell, Charles Dilly, the printer William Strahan, and the stationer William Bloxham. Sibbald acquired from Bloxham a list of English country booksellers, looked after a pamphlet on the American war, <span class="italic">Historical Anecdotes</span> (1779), that Elliot published as &#145;London: printed for J. Bew&#146;, registered this title for Elliot at Stationers' Hall, and completed the first transaction for himself by exchanging George Carr's <span class="italic">Sermons</span> (an Elliot and Cadell publication) for Robinson and Bew books. Asked to send up the best printing ink to Edinburgh, he was warned to go through a friendly bookseller to avoid a curious London practice: &#145;when they learn it is for Scotland they often send their Trash or spoiled kind&#146;  (Elliot to Sibbald, 3 May 1779).<br>
<br>Late in September 1779 Sibbald returned to Scotland on a borrowed horse and worked for some weeks at Elliot's shop in Parliament Square in Edinburgh for a guinea a week, double the wage of Elliot's clerk Thomas Dobson. Meanwhile he wrote his first catalogue for 20,000 volumes in English, French, and Italian, as well as music, then reopened the expanded circulating library a few doors away at 28 Parliament Square in November, at the start of university classes. Burns visited in 1786&#150;7, and the shop was frequented by the young Walter Scott. Scott said he fastened &#145;like a tiger, upon every collection of old songs or romances which chance threw into my way, or which my scrutiny was able to discover on the dusty shelves of James Sibbald's circulating library in the Parliament Square&#146;. He said the library contained<blockquote>many rare and curious works, seldom found is such a collection. Mr. Sibbald himself, a man of rough manners but of some taste and judgment, cultivated music and poetry, and in his shop I had a distant view of some literary characters, Burns among others. (Lockhart, 46)</blockquote>Sibbald contributed to an Edinburgh fad in the early 1780s when he sold the latest coloured mezzotint engravings from London, advertising in the <span class="italic">Caledonian Mercury</span> favourite titles with the public, such as <span class="italic">Kate of Aberdeen</span> (7 August 1782; March&#150;July 1783). Elliot described him as a &#145;perfect judge&#146;, who &#145;from his extensive dealing in prints, has spread such a rage for purchasing, that no gentle house is without its select collection&#146;, Elliot's home included  (Elliot to David Mitchell, G&ouml;teborg, 15 Sept 1783). Public interest is said to have lessened when Sibbald was discovered colouring the prints himself.<br>
<br>Sibbald multiplied his activities when he established both a magazine and a newspaper and managed a paper mill. In 1785 he began the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Magazine, or, Literary Miscellany</span>, a journal of literary sophistication which regularly had an engraved view and a page of music; it appeared monthly and sold for 1<i>s</i>. An agreement was made with John Murray the next year to exchange 100 copies of the magazine for the <span class="italic">English Review</span> and for both booksellers to share the imprints. One of the regular contributors was Lord Hailes, whose attention was first caught by Sibbald's articles, unsigned, on Scottish antiquities. Sibbald was the first reviewer to acclaim the genius of Robert Burns, and his Kilmarnock poems in the October 1786 number: &#145;The author is indeed a striking example of native genius bursting through the obscurity of poverty and the obstructions of laborious life.&#146; Sibbald continued to promote him with extracts over the next two months. In the December issue he reprinted Henry Mackenzie's review in <span class="italic">The Lounger</span> and said, &#145;His fame is now spreading rapidly.&#146; Burns responded with gratitude for the way Sibbald had &#145;befriended an obscure man and young Author in your last three Magazines&#151;I can only say, Sir, I feel the weight of the obligation&#146;  (Burns to Sibbald, Jan 1787). In 1790 Sibbald also started a thrice-weekly newspaper, the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Herald</span>, in which he proposed to have literary intelligence and essays on life and manners as well as public and political news and advertisements. He published Burns's &#145;Tam o' Shanter&#146; on 18 March 1791, a month before the poem appeared in Grose's <span class="italic">Antiquities of Scotland</span>. The <span class="italic">Herald</span> was characterized by its enemy the <span class="italic">Political Review</span> on 20 June 1792 as &#145;a vehicle for ministerial dirt&#146; taken from <span class="italic">The Times</span> and <span class="italic">The Oracle</span> of London, and &#145;dealt out in pailfuls more offensive than before&#146;  (Couper, 2.184).<br>
<br>From 1788 to 1798 Sibbald was managing partner of the Auchendinny paper mill on the North Esk, 8 miles south of Edinburgh. Auchendinny served the Scottish and London trade and gave Sibbald the opportunity of a substantial income; in 1798 his joint cash account with the owner, William Cadell, stood at nearly &pound;1500 (Cadell of Grange papers). While there Sibbald experienced the temper of the author James Bruce of Kinnaird. After Bruce signed a contract with Robinson of London to publish <span class="italic">Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile</span> (in an edition of 2000 copies, for a payment of &pound;6666), Sibbald seized the chance of being associated as the printer. He brought in the printer James Ruthven of Edinburgh as a partner, offered the low price of &pound;495 to print 360 sheets in five volumes quarto, and signed a contract with Bruce between April and May 1789; Auchendinny would also supply the paper. Bruce drew for him a mock title-page whose imprint began &#145;Edinburgh, printed by J. Sibbald, under the author's immediate inspection&#146; but this was a false promise. Sibbald said that while he was ill with a fever in June and July 1789 and away from the project, Bruce induced Ruthven to increase the production to twelve sheets a week instead of nine by substituting his name for Sibbald's on the imprint; this deletion caused Sibbald to be &#145;chagrined a little&#146;  (Bruce <i>v.</i> Sibbald and Ruthven). The relationship, poor during printing, grew worse when Bruce accused Sibbald of sabotage. He said &#145;that Arch rascal Sibbald&#146; had deliberately supplied a batch of yellowed and underweight paper for the book and asked Cadell to dismiss him; Cadell found the charge was unjustified (Cadell of Grange papers). Later, when the imperial paper sent to London for the king's presentation copy was found to be badly soiled, Bruce said it was intentional on Sibbald's part, and in November 1790 sued Sibbald and Ruthven at the court of session for failing to deliver the book in a workmanlike manner, claiming &pound;216 in loss and expenses. After much evidence from both sides the case hinged on a letter from Bruce's clerk, which Sibbald produced, acknowledging arrival of the printed sheets in London in good order, and in 1792 Sibbald and Ruthven were cleared of the charge.<br>
<br>Sibbald gave over the running of the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Magazine</span> to Laurie and Symington in 1791 and ended his editorship in June 1792, passing it on to Dr Robert Anderson. He stopped editing the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Herald</span> by 1796. Sibbald also rented his circulating library to Laurie and Symington from 1790 to 1800, for an annual fee of &pound;200, which dropped to 100 guineas. He continued the bookshop for a few more years&#151;publishing Thomson's <span class="italic">The Seasons</span> (1789), and <span class="italic">The History of Tom Jones</span> (1791)&#151;and took to the court of session to recover debts, suing, among many others, the estate of Adam Smith for &pound;1 12<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. He also won a judgment against Thomas Dobson for &pound;42 worth of books sent to Philadelphia. In February 1796 he sold his house in Mausie Smith's Close in the Canongate, and was referred to as &#145;late bookseller, Edinburgh, now in London&#146;  (register of Sasines, Edinburgh, no. 6404). He had visited London frequently, and this sojourn, which was to last several years, appears to have been relaxed: when a relative sought his whereabouts, he replied &#145;My lodging is in Soho, and my business is so so&#146;  (Chambers, <span class="italic">Scots.</span>, 260). While in London he wrote <span class="italic">The Record of the Public Ministry of Jesus the Christ</span> (printed at Edinburgh in 1798). He returned to Edinburgh by 1800, when he took back his circulating library. His <span class="italic">Chronicle of Scottish Poetry: from the Thirteenth Century to the Union of the Crowns</span> (4 vols.), published on 4 December 1802 and priced &pound;1 4<i>s</i>. in boards, offered the public extracts from the Bannatyne manuscript and followed earlier collections by Allan Ramsay and Lord Hailes. Walter Scott, picking up on a footnote, remarked that &#145;A heavy personage here of the name of Sibbald&#146; had criticized his tardiness in publishing <span class="italic">Sir Tristrem</span>, but advised that the book be bought as the fourth volume &#145;contains some curious remarks on the ancient Scottish music &amp; an uncommonly good glossary&#146;  (Scott to George Ellis, Dec 1802); he praised the glossary publicly in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> of October 1803.<br>
<br>Sibbald, described as &#145;a man of eccentric, but benevolent and amiable character&#146;  (Chambers, <span class="italic">Scots.</span>, 261), was a member of many convivial clubs. In a John Kay caricature of 1785, <span class="italic">Connoisseurs</span>, he is portrayed with a group of friends, looking through a glass at a print of <span class="italic">The Three Graces</span>. The centrality of his circulating library in Edinburgh life is depicted in the 1856 painting by W. Borthwick Johnstone of Scott seeing Burns there; others in the group include James Bruce, while Sibbald is shown fetching a book from a shelf for Lord Monboddo. Sibbald died, unmarried, at his home on Leith Walk on 9 April 1803, and was buried on 12 April in South Leith churchyard, in William Sibbald's tomb.<br>
