<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Philipps,  Wogan</span>, second Baron Milford  (1902&#150;1993), <span class="occ">political activist and artist</span>, was born at Manor House, High Street, Brentwood, Essex, on 25 February 1902, the eldest child in the family of five sons and one daughter of Laurence Richard Philipps, first Baron Milford (1874&#150;1962), businessman and company director, and his wife, Ethel Georgina (1879&#150;1971), only daughter of Benjamin Speke, rector of Dowlish Wake, Somerset. His father came from a remarkable family, being the younger brother of John Wynford Philipps, first Viscount St Davids (1860&#150;1938), Major-General Sir Ivor Philipps (1861&#150;1940), and Owen Cosby Philipps, Baron Kylsant (1863&#150;1937). Laurence Richard Philipps amassed a fortune based on shipping and insurance, and was created baronet in 1919 and Baron Milford in 1939, with the revival of a title which the Philipps of Picton Castle had held in the eighteenth century.<br>
<br>Wogan Philipps was educated at Eton College and studied history at Magdalen College, Oxford, but left before completing his degree. He then joined the family shipping business, Court Line. On 21 November 1928 he married the novelist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39839/', "Rosamond Nina Lehmann (1901&#150;1990)")</script>, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37664/', "Rudolph Chambers Lehmann")</script>, journalist and Liberal MP, and former wife of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40121/', "(Walter) Leslie Runciman, second Viscount Runciman")</script>. Philipps and his wife had two children, Hugo (<i>b</i>. 1929) and Sarah Jane 
    (Sally; <i>b</i>. 1934)
  . Philipps acted as his wife's typist for the novels she wrote during their marriage. Many artistic friends came to stay at their house in Ipsden, Oxfordshire, including Julian Bell, Stephen Spender, Lytton Strachey, and Dora Carrington, as well as Augustus John, with whom Philipps used to go on pub crawls (though he gave these up when he feared they were causing him to hallucinate).<br>
<br>A holiday in Spain with Ralph and Frances Partridge early in 1936 began a fascination with that country and, when the civil war broke out later that year, Philipps was quick to volunteer his services to the Spanish Medical Aid office in London. He bought a van, filled it with supplies, and joined a convoy on its way to the Jarama front. Although he had no medical experience, he helped treat the wounded, and was made sergeant, despite not being a member of the International Brigades. He was wounded by shellfire and sent home to England, but soon returned to Spain, exploiting family connections in the shipping business to undermine the nationalists' blockade and acting as secretary for an organization of British shipowners trading with Spain. When Franco's victory became inescapable, Philipps organized the evacuation to Mexico of nearly 2000 refugees, including many children, on the SS <i>Sinaia</i>.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the Second World War, Philipps was judged medically unfit for service in the merchant navy, and he spent the war years working as an agricultural labourer in Gloucestershire. He took a leading role in building up the National Union of Agricultural Workers in the county, serving on the county committee and representing his branch on the Cheltenham Trades Council. Meanwhile, his first marriage had broken down (his wife living for several years with the poet Cecil Day-Lewis), and ended in 1944 in divorce. On 17 January the same year Philipps married Cristina (1901&#150;1953), daughter of the Marchese Casati, of the Palazzo Barberini, Rome, and former wife of Francis John Clarence Westenra Plantagenet Hastings, sixteenth earl of Huntingdon. Philipps and his second wife, an aristocratic communist, had met during the Spanish Civil War. Philipps's own political sympathies had begun to turn to the left during the general strike in 1926, but were confirmed rapidly by his experiences in Spain, and he joined the Communist Party in 1937. His father (who held office in local Conservative and Unionist associations) responded by disinheriting him.<br>
<br>After the war Philipps bought a 180-acre farm at Colesbourne in the Cotswolds, where he grew cereals and raised pigs, poultry, Jersey cattle, and sheep. He claimed to have been the first person to introduce artificial insemination to Gloucestershire. In 1946 he became the only Communist member on the Cirencester rural district council; the otherwise exclusively tory membership reputedly went to great lengths to ensure that he lost his seat in 1949, albeit by only fourteen votes. He was the prospective parliamentary candidate for the Labour Party in Henley-on-Thames before the Second World War, and stood (unsuccessfully) as the Communist Party's candidate at Cirencester and Tewkesbury in the 1950 general election.<br>
<br>Philipps's second wife, Cristina, died in 1953, and on 20 May the following year he married Tamara Rust, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kravets (1913&#150;2008), daughter of a Russian architect and widow of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40599/', "William Charles Rust")</script>, editor of the <span class="italic">Daily Worker</span>, the communist daily newspaper. In 1958 Philipps's daughter from his first marriage, Sally, died of polio in Jakarta. She was memorialised by her husband, the poet P. J. Kavanagh, in <span class="italic">The Perfect Stranger</span> (1966).<br>
<br>When his father died in December 1962 Philipps succeeded to the title as second Baron Milford. He took his seat in the House of Lords in May 1963 and used the occasion of his maiden speech to argue for the abolition of the second chamber. For three decades he was the only avowed communist to sit in parliament; as Earl Attlee observed, it was a curious irony that the Communist Party should owe its solitary parliamentary voice to the principle of hereditary representation. Milford's politics led him to be ostracized by many of his fellow lords, but he was active in the work of the house, speaking particularly on issues of foreign policy. He campaigned against repressive regimes, visiting Algeria, Chile, and Greece. He was no admirer of the Soviet system; he visited the Soviet Union on two occasions to study its agriculture, but was disappointed by what he saw there.<br>
<br>Milford described himself in his <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> entry as a &#145;farmer and painter&#146;, and although better known for his aristocratic communism, he wanted to be remembered &#145;for leaving a few good paintings to the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Art of Wogan Philipps</span>). He had studied briefly at the Ruskin School of Drawing, Oxford, and also worked with artists of the Euston Road School in London. He held his first solo exhibition in 1931, and throughout the 1930s showed his work frequently with the Artists' International Association and at the Leicester Gallery. He continued to exhibit until the late 1980s, with solo exhibitions at the Woodstock and Pentonville galleries in London, the Regent Gallery, Cheltenham, and the Einaudi Gallery, Milan; he also showed his work at the annual parliamentarians' exhibition at Westminster. His subject matter was often drawn from the landscape of the Cotswolds, interpreted in a modernist idiom.<br>
<br>Following his retirement from farming Milford moved to a flat in Hampstead. He died in London on 30 November 1993, and was survived by his third wife, Tamara, and the son of his first marriage, Hugo, who succeeded him as third Baron Milford. His widow organized a memorial exhibition of his paintings in London in 1995.<br>
