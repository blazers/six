<span class="headword">Dinnie,  Donald</span>  (1837&#150;1916), <span class="occ">athlete</span>, was born on 8 July 1837 at Balnacraig, near Aboyne, Aberdeenshire, the eldest of ten children of Robert Dinnie (1808&#150;1892), a stonemason, and Christine Hay. He left school at fifteen and won his first prize for wrestling one year later in 1853, when he turned professional. During the Victorian period the issue of professionalism was handled in a variety of ways by different sports, and Dinnie was earning money from athletics several years before the matter had been resolved in rugby, cricket, or football. By 1867 he had decided to make athletics his full-time employment. That same year he recorded nine firsts and one second at the inaugural Aboyne highland games. He was the undefeated highland games heavyweight champion from 1856 to 1869 and then again from 1871 to 1876. During his first year as a full-time professional athlete Dinnie's records included throwing the heavy hammer 81 feet 6 inches, throwing the heavy stone 35 feet 5 inches, throwing the light stone 45 feet 7 inches, and clearing 5 feet 1 inch in the high jump. By 1868 he had also advanced the records at the Braemar Royal Highland Gathering to: 92 feet 4 inches for the 16 lb hammer, 84 feet 9 inches for the 22 lb hammer, and 5 feet 4 inches for the high jump. Promoters were prepared to pay him between &pound;25 and &pound;100 to appear at Scottish highland games events.<br>
<br>In 1870 Dinnie was invited by the Caledonia Clubs to tour America, and the New York Caledonian Club paid $130 towards his passage. He acted as a judge at the New York Caledonian games of 1872 where his attendance helped to attract a crowd of 25,000 spectators, and by 1877 he was able to earn as much as $700 a day. At Plainfield, New Jersey, he won the mixed styles wrestling championship of America in 1882. At one San Francisco highland games his winnings totalled &pound;350 plus half of the gate money. Dinnie moved to Australia in 1844 and then on to New Zealand. Still reluctant to perform without payment he earned &pound;85 for defeating the Maori wrestling champion of fifteen consecutive years. In 1888 he toured South Africa, returning home a year later.<br>
<br>As an athlete, Dinnie was an all-rounder, equally proficient at putting the stone, tossing the caber, leaping, jumping, or running. Proud and independent of character, he stood 6 feet 1 inch high, and weighed 15 stone; his chest measured 48 inches, his biceps 15 inches, and his thighs 26&frac12; inches. During his professional career (1853&#150;<i>c</i>.1912) he won more than 11,000 contests: these included 2000 prizes for throwing the hammer, 1800 prizes for putting the stone, more than 2000 prizes for wrestling, 300 prizes for throwing weights, 1400 prizes for tossing the caber, 1800 prizes for jumping, and about 500 prizes for running and hurdles races. Dinnie sincerely believed that the athlete, like the labourer, should be paid for his work, and his estimated cash winnings from athletics, excluding displays from strength promotions and displays, were in excess of &pound;25,000.<br>
<br>Dinnie's first wife died in the 1870s while he was on tour. His son Edwin Dinnie was born in June 1877, and won over a hundred prizes in light and field events. Dinnie married for a second time, in 1885, in Melbourne, where his daughter Eva was born.<br>
<br>Dinnie continued to compete as a professional athlete until well into his seventies. In 1907 he asked the Aboyne highland games committee to arrange two events for veterans of over sixty years. At the age of seventy-five he competed in a health and strength show in London. Best remembered as one of Scotland's chief professional athletes, Dinnie died at his home, 144 Portland Road, Kensington, London, on 2 April 1916. His second wife, Eleanor, survived him. The Donald Dinnie trophy remains one of the most sought-after Scottish athletic awards.<br>
