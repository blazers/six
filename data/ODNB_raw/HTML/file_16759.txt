<span class="headword">Lisle <span class="st"> [L'Isle]</span>,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1569&#150;1637), <span class="occ">translator and Anglo-Saxon scholar</span>, was one of numerous children of Edmond Lisle of Tandridge, Surrey, and Dorothy Rudston, daughter of Thomas Rudston of Cambridgeshire. About 1580 Lisle went to school at Eton College, from where, in 1584, he went on to King's College, Cambridge. He took bachelor's and master's degrees there, and in 1593 is recorded supplicating for incorporation at Oxford. He became a fellow of his Cambridge college, and seems to have stayed in this post until 1608.<br>
<br>While Lisle's most enduring reputation derives from his work on Anglo-Saxon, he worked too on several other languages, and his first translations were from French. In 1595 he published <span class="italic">Babilon: a part of the seconde weeke of Guillaume de Saluste Seigneur du Bartas, with the commentarie, and marginall notes of S. G. S</span>. The translation was dedicated to the lord admiral, Thomas Howard of Effingham. Three years later appeared another translation, <span class="italic">The colonies of Bartas: with the commentarie of S. G. S. in diverse places corrected and enlarged by the translatour</span>. He has also been conjecturally identified as the &#145;W. L.&#146; who wrote, in 1603, the verse pamphlet <span class="italic">Nothing for a New Year's Gift</span>.<br>
<br>In 1608 there took place a &#145;bloody quarrel&#146; at the notoriously rowdy King's College, in which Roger Goad, the vice-chancellor of Cambridge University, was wounded. Goad involved Lord Salisbury, the chancellor of the university, and Lisle wrote submitting to Salisbury's jurisdiction and begging not to be sacked for his offence. It is unclear whether or not any action was taken against him on this occasion, and very little else is known about his life.<br>
<br>During these years, Lisle became a pioneer in the study of Anglo-Saxon. In the preface to his edition of the <span class="italic">Saxon Treatise</span>, he describes his methods in teaching himself this unfamiliar tongue: he studied whatever Old English materials he could find collected by previous antiquaries, as well as other tangentially relevant material such as the Dutch language, and then, having learned &#145;as it were to swimme without bladders&#146;, embarked upon independent studies  (<span class="italic">Saxon Treatise</span>, sig. d1<i>r</i>). Lisle worked in collaboration with other antiquaries such as his kinsman Henry Spelman, and also Robert Cotton, in recovering Old English. His motives were both political and religious, as may be seen by the extended title of his print publication, <span class="italic">Saxon treatise concerning the Old and New Testament: written about the time of King Edgar (700 yeares agoe) by &AElig;lfricus Aebas, thought to be the same that was afterward archbishop of Canterburie, whereby appeares what was the canon of holy scripture here then received, and that the Church of England had it so long agoe in her mother tongue</span> (1623). Lisle edited this work from a manuscript belonging to Cotton, and as the title also shows, he suspected the incorrect identification of &AElig;lfric Grammaticus with &AElig;lfric, archbishop of Canterbury. Appendices contain homilies and epistles of &AElig;lfric. The volume is almost in itself an Anglo-Saxon primer, containing as it does additional material such as the Lord's prayer, the creed, and the ten commandments in Anglo-Saxon with interlinear translation.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Saxon Treatise</span> was Lisle's only work of Anglo-Saxon scholarship to be printed in his lifetime, and it was also reissued in 1638 under the title <span class="italic">Divers Ancient Monuments</span>. However, he contributed much other work to the revival of Anglo-Saxon studies. Letters exchanged with Robert Cotton mention a lexicon prepared by Lisle of Anglo-Saxon vocabulary, which Lisle was seeking to have printed, but this work has not survived. Two manuscripts now in the Bodleian (MS Laud misc. 201, MS Laud misc. 381) represent substantial projects by Lisle. The first of these is entitled, in the manuscript, &#145;The Saxon-English psalter, to preserve the memory of our mother churche and language&#146;. Based on the Eadwine psalter and completed by Lisle in 1630, this is the first modern edition and translation of an Old English psalter. A similar search for national identity informs the other manuscript, a collection of largely <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> material in Old English, designed to illustrate &#145;the Roots &amp; grounds of our mother toong&#146;  (Pulsiano, 183). Lisle also worked on the <span class="italic">Ancrene Wisse</span> and on Anglo-Saxon law.<br>
<br>Lisle appears to have had access to some manuscripts that are now lost, and his work is the sole source for subsequent knowledge of, for instance, &AElig;lfric's homily on <span class="roman">Esther</span>. While his all-round achievements are remarkable, recent scholarship has discovered that he occasionally distorts the texts he transcribes, most notably through deliberate archaizings and silent omissions. He certainly had the facility to compose in Old English if he chose to.<br>
<br>Alongside his Anglo-Saxon career, Lisle continued to produce verse translations from other languages. In 1625 and 1637 appeared more work by him on Du Bartas: in 1628 he printed <span class="italic">Virgil's Eclogues, Translated into English by W. L., Gent.</span>, with the accompanying commentary of Vives. In 1631 Lisle printed <span class="italic">The Faire Aethiopian</span>, a verse translation of Heliodorus dedicated to the king and queen. This was reissued in 1638 under the title, <span class="italic">The Famous Historie of Heliodorus</span>. In addition, Lisle wrote Latin hexameter verses which appeared in the preface to the second edition of his neighbour Michael Dalton's book <span class="italic">The Countrey Justice</span> (1619); a verse inscription on the tomb of William Benson in St Olave's, Southwark; and he has been credited with English verses signed &#145;W. L.&#146;, beginning &#145;When stout Achilles heard of Helens rape&#146;, that appeared prefixed to the 1590 <span class="italic">Faerie Queene</span>. However, this last identification is far from certain.<br>
<br>Lisle died in September 1637 at the family estate at Wilbraham, Cambridge. He was buried in Walmer, Kent, where a monument commemorates him.<br>
