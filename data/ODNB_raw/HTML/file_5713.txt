<span class="headword">Clover,  Joseph</span>  (1725&#150;1811), <span class="occ">veterinary surgeon and farrier</span>, son of a blacksmith, was born in Norwich on 12 August 1725. He benefited from some early schooling and learned his trade working alongside his father. When he was seventeen his father died and Joseph took over the family business, providing support for his mother and three siblings. About 1750 he attracted the notice of Kirvin Wright, an eminent physician, by whom he was encouraged to apply himself to the investigation and treatment of the diseases of horses. By dint of extraordinary application he mastered Latin and French and was able to read the best contemporary authors on farriery and horse medicine, particularly Vegetius and &Eacute;tienne La Fosse. He also became a good mathematician, and was a member of the Bilbean Society of Norwich where &#145;men of original minds and with small incomes [met], for improvement in mathematics, experimental philosophy&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 191), natural history, and botany, under the direction of Peter Bilby.<br>
<br>From 1765 Clover devoted himself entirely to veterinary practice. In this he was assisted by many well-known medical men, especially Benjamin Gooch, the surgeon, who inserted in his <span class="italic">Cases and Practical Remarks in Surgery</span> a letter from Clover which gave his description and drawing of a machine he had invented for the cure of ruptured tendons and fractured legs in horses. As early as 1753 he had discovered the manner in which the larvae of bots are conveyed from the coat of the horse into the stomach and intestines, and he had demonstrated this fact at several meetings of the Bilbean Society.<br>
<br>Gooch, writing in his <span class="italic">Chirurgical Works</span>, gave Clover an excellent testimonial: &#145;Mr Clover's character, by all who know him, is that of having a great superiority of knowledge in his profession, and his moral character is not less excellent&#146;. Clover was tall and with &#145;a strong muscular frame of body&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 192). However, for many years he suffered from giddiness and head pains. He died, aged eighty-five, at Norwich, on 19 February 1811.<br>
