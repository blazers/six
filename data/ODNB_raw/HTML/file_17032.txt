<span class="headword">Lough,  John Graham</span>  (1798&#150;1876), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born on 8 January 1798 in Black Hedley Port, Greenhead, Shotley, Northumberland, the third son of William Lough (1764&#150;1850), a blacksmith and smallholder, and his wife, Barbara Clemitson (1767&#150;1852). John Lough (who later added the middle name Graham, his grandmother's maiden name) is said to have followed the plough in his youth and was apprenticed (<i>c</i>.1815&#150;<i>c</i>.1823) to a stonemason, Jonathan Marshall of Shotley Field. He afterwards gained employment in Newcastle upon Tyne as an ornamental sculptor, and carved decorations on the building of the Literary and Philosophical Society in Westgate Road. In early 1825 Lough went to London&#151;he made the journey on a collier, the captain of which, on their arrival, took him to see the Elgin marbles in the British Museum&#151;and on 15 December 1826 he was admitted to the Royal Academy Schools.<br>
<br>Lough gained unusual early success as a sculptor in London. He became the prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the painter Benjamin Robert Haydon, who organized an exhibition of two of Lough's early works in June 1827 at rooms in Maddox Street. These sculptures, a colossal statue entitled <span class="italic">Milo</span> and <span class="italic">Samson Slaying the Philistines</span>, were hailed by contemporaries as works of remarkable power and originality, based on a study of Phidian sculpture and Michelangelo rather than the standard Graeco-Roman models. Lough received several commissions for these works at this time, and in March 1828 he held a second private exhibition in Regent Street.<br>
<br>In 1832 Lough married Mary North (1791/2&#150;1888), the daughter of a domestic chaplain of the duke of Kent; they had two daughters, Mary Rebecca (<i>b</i>. 1832) and Georgina (<i>b</i>. 1834). In 1834 the family travelled to Italy, where they remained for three years. Little is known of this period, though Lough seems to have kept himself apart from the English community of sculptors in Rome and was beset by financial problems and health worries caused by outbreaks of cholera.<br>
<br>After his return, Lough led a productive career as a sculptor in London, though he perhaps never regained the reputation he had enjoyed in his early years. He was not elected a Royal Academician nor even an associate, though he exhibited some fifty works at the Royal Academy between 1826 and 1863, and he was unsuccessful in major public competitions such as that for the Nelson monument in Trafalgar Square. He did, however, produce some notable public memorials, including those to Thomas Fanshaw Middleton, bishop of Calcutta (1832), for St Paul's Cathedral, and the inventor George Stephenson (1862) for Newcastle upon Tyne. His church monuments included those to the poet Robert Southey (1845) in Crosthwaite, Cumberland, and Bishop William Grant Broughton (1855) in Canterbury Cathedral. He also made a large number of portrait busts.<br>
<br>Lough designed many &#145;ideal&#146; works in marble, an area in which he was fortunate to gain the patronage of certain wealthy noblemen. In particular, Sir Matthew White Ridley, fourth baronet, commissioned a large series of Shakespearian statues (<i>c</i>.1840&#150;<i>c</i>.1871) from the sculptor, as well as a bronze version of the <span class="italic">Milo</span> (1863) and other imaginative pieces. Lough also made ideal works for Charles Hanbury-Tracy of Toddington, Gloucestershire. His work reflected an impulse towards novelty in form and subject matter, and an eclectic mixture of sources&#151;from Roman to high Renaissance, Gothic revival (in his church monuments), and modern pictorialism&#151;which mark him as a &#145;transitional&#146; sculptor, seeking to break the mould of neo-classicism. The results were sometimes boldly original, at other times unconvincing, overambitious, and strangely mannered.<br>
<br>The writer Cecilia Toulmin described Lough as &#145;A handsome man &hellip; with magnificent eyes that lighted up the whole countenance&#146;  (Toulmin, 142), and a painting by an unknown artist portrays the sculptor in his youth as a Romantic, Byronic figure standing before his statue of <span class="italic">Satan</span>  (Lough and Merson, pl. 4). In old age he was, according to his nephew, the biographer and surgeon Stephen Paget, a &#145;dear, simple, philosophical old boy, with a tremendous broad accent&#146;, the son of a Greenhead blacksmith who had married well  (Paget MSS, 10). John Graham Lough died of bronchitis on 8 April 1876 at his home, 42 Harewood Square, London. Soon afterwards his widow presented a large number of the sculptor's models and casts to Elswick Hall, Newcastle upon Tyne, where unfortunately, together with other works given by the Ridley family, they were later destroyed.<br>
