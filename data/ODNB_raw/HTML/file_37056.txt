<span class="headword">Wyon family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1760&#150;1962), <span class="occ">die-engravers and medallists</span>, came to Britain from Germany about the middle of the eighteenth century. By 1705 the family had been established in Cologne, where in the 1730s and 1740s Peter Wyon supplied coin and medal dies to the city's ecclesiastical and civic mints, and in the 1760s Eberhart Wyon, thought to be a younger brother of Peter Wyon, signed several coin dies. The first member of the family to cross to Britain appears to have been a metalworker, Peter George Wyon (1710&#150;1744), third son of George Wyon and Maria Sibylla Hemmerden, who had married in Cologne on 1 January 1705. It is improbable that this individual was the Peter Wyon who was working for the Cologne mints.<br>
<br>Peter George Wyon's son, <a name="cosubject_30168"></a><span class="headword">George Wyon</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1797)<span class="occ"></span>, whom he brought with him to Britain, also became a metalworker, and was apprenticed to George II's goldsmith Hemmings. George's first wife, Sarah, gave birth to a child, Ann, who was baptized in London on 13 March 1763. On 2 February 1766 George married his second wife, Ann Christy; their children Thomas and Peter were born the following year, with George and Mary following in 1771 and 1773 respectively; another son, James, was born later. In 1775 the family moved to Birmingham, where George produced designs and models for Matthew Boulton's Soho Manufactory and for the Birmingham Silver Plate Company, and where he also established the family die-engraving business, which was to remain in existence until the 1930s. All four sons learned to engrave dies, the resurgence of private tokens in the late eighteenth century accounting for a good proportion of their work. When their father died, Thomas and Peter, who had married two sisters, Ann and Elizabeth Avery, in 1790 and 1794 respectively, took over the business, which in 1800 they divided into two, with Thomas moving down to London, to open an operation in the capital.<br>
<br>The earliest medals of <a name="cosubject_30172"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Wyon the elder</span>  (1767&#150;1830)<span class="occ"></span> belong to 1789. Like many other members of the family, he frequently followed designs produced by other artists: for his medal of Stonehenge (1796) he engraved a design by William Blake, and his portrait of Joseph Hanson (1810), the champion of the weavers' cause, was based on a wax model by Peter Rouw. His medals range from a large piece commemorating the centenary of the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> (1807) to five tiny medallets celebrating the final defeat of Napoleon (1815). He continued also to produce tokens, such as that for John Cooper's cotton mill in Staverton, Wiltshire (1811). In 1816 he was appointed chief engraver of his majesty's seals.<br>
<br>Thomas Wyon's eldest son, <a name="cosubject_30171"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Wyon the younger</span>  (1792&#150;1817)<span class="occ"></span>, trained under his father and the gem-engraver Nathaniel Marchant, and at the Royal Academy Schools. Among his earliest medals were those commemorating the duke of Wellington's victories in Portugal (1810) and the appointment of the prince of Wales as regent (1811). He was not yet twenty when on 20 November 1811 he was appointed probationer engraver at the Royal Mint, and on 13 October 1815 he became chief engraver. He executed dies for coins for various colonies, as well as for George III's German territories and the duke of Wellington's army in France. He was involved in the production of dies for the recoinage of 1816, but his promising career was cut short by his premature death from consumption in 1817.<br>
<br>His brother <a name="cosubject_30167"></a><span class="headword">Benjamin Wyon</span>  (1802&#150;1858)<span class="occ"></span> was also a prolific die-engraver, who received training from his father and his elder brother and at the Royal Academy. Following his father's death in 1830, he was appointed to the post of chief engraver of seals, and took over the family firm. His seals include the great seal of William IV (1831). His medal commemorating the opening of the new London Bridge (1831) was the first of a series issued throughout the remainder of the century by the corporation of the City of London, to which the Wyons made a significant contribution. Later medals include a commemoration of the opening of London's new coal exchange (1849), and a prize medal for the Royal Scottish Academy, for which Sir Joseph No&euml;l Paton provided the design (about 1854). He died on 21 November 1858 at his home, 14 Buckland Crescent, St John's Wood, London.<br>
<br>A younger brother, <a name="cosubject_66583"></a><span class="headword">Edward William Wyon</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1811, <em>d.</em> 1885)<span class="occ"></span>, studied at the Royal Academy Schools from 1829, and became a celebrated sculptor, exhibiting at the Royal Academy regularly from 1831 to 1876. Among his commissions were works intended for reproduction by Wedgwood and numerous portrait busts. He executed reliefs for Drapers' Hall, London (1866), and two caryatids for the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge (1874).<br>
<br>Benjamin Wyon married Hannah Olive Shepherd in 1835, and three of their children became die-engravers. <a name="cosubject_30169"></a><span class="headword">Joseph Shepherd Wyon</span>  (1836&#150;1873)<span class="occ"></span> and <a name="cosubject_30166"></a><span class="headword">Alfred Benjamin Wyon</span>  (1837&#150;1884)<span class="occ"></span>, both of whom trained under their father and at the Royal Academy Schools, took over the firm, reconstituting it as J. S. and A. B. Wyon. Determining who was responsible for their medals can be problematical, for, although some are signed individually, others, including some made after Joseph's death, bear the firm's signature; many were exhibited jointly at the Royal Academy. Joseph Shepherd died on 12 August 1873 at Winchester, Hampshire, leaving a widow, Sarah. Alfred Benjamin died on 4 June 1884 at his home, 23 Belsize Road, Hampstead, leaving a widow, Kate. Their younger brother <a name="cosubject_37056"></a><span class="headword">Allan Wyon</span>  (1843&#150;1907)<span class="occ"></span> joined the firm in 1872. The three brothers followed their father successively as chief engraver of seals. Allan Wyon completed and brought to publication his brother Alfred's <span class="italic">The Great Seals of England</span> (1887). He died at his home, 33 Parkhill Road, Hampstead, on 25 January 1907.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_77081"></a><span class="headword">Allan Gairdner Wyon</span>  (1882&#150;1962), son of Allan and his wife, Harriet Gairdner, was primarily a <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, and was also the last member of the family to work as a die-engraver. He trained at the Royal Academy Schools, and worked as assistant to the sculptor William Hamo Thornycroft. His works include the <span class="italic">East Wind</span> for Charles Holden's new headquarters for London Underground at 55 Broadway (1926&#150;9). On his father's death he took his place as head of the die-engraving firm, but under him it ceased to operate, and in 1933 the dies were transferred to John Pinches. He continued to design and model medals, however, into the 1950s. He died in 1962.<br>
<br>Peter Wyon (1767&#150;1822), who had continued to run the Birmingham side of the business after Thomas the elder's departure for London, produced tokens and medals, including a large medal of Boulton after a model by Roux (1809). The Birmingham business ended with his death, by which time his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30173/', "William Wyon (1795&#150;1851)")</script> was established at the Royal Mint in London. Following William's death, the post of modeller and engraver to the Royal Mint was created for his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30170/', "Leonard Charles Wyon (1826&#150;1891)")</script>.<br>
<br>The third brother, George Wyon (<i>b</i>. 1771), also remained in Birmingham, where on 26 August 1798 he married Elizabeth Phillips. Their son James Wyon (1804&#150;1868) worked as assistant to his cousin William Wyon in London, and on the reorganization of the Royal Mint in 1851 became resident engraver. Two of the sons of James and his wife, Mary, Henry Wyon (1834&#150;1856) and George Wyon (1834&#150;1862), also became die-engravers. Another of George and Elizabeth's sons, John George (<i>b</i>. 1806), who remained in the west midlands and married Alice Arkinstall, was the father of Edward Wyon (1837&#150;1906), who worked for the Birmingham mint of Heaton &amp; Sons and, having supervised the construction of the first modern mint in China, at Canton (Guangzhou), in 1887&#150;8, stayed on as head of the operative department.<br>
<br>The fourth brother, James Wyon, set up a die-engraving business in Dublin.<br>
