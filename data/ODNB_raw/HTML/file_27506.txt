<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Tombs, Sir  Henry</span>  (1824&#150;1874), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, son of Major-General John Tombs (1777&#150;1848), Bengal cavalry, and his wife, Mary (1791/2&#150;1876) <i>n&eacute;e</i> Remington, came of a family settled since the fifteenth century at Long Marston, Gloucestershire, and was born at sea on 10 November 1824. He entered the East India Company's military college, Addiscombe, in 1839, and was commissioned second lieutenant, Bengal artillery, on 11 June 1841. He arrived at Calcutta on 18 November 1841 and was posted to the foot artillery at Dum-Dum. In August 1842 he went with a detachment to the upper provinces. On 1 March 1843 he was posted to the 3rd company, 5th battalion of artillery, at Saugor; on 23 November he went to the 6th company, 6th battalion, at Jhansi, and took part in the Gwalior campaign. He arrived with the force called the &#145;left wing&#146; under Major-General Sir John Grey at Badli-ki-sarai on 28 December 1843, and next morning marched to Panniar, where the Marathas were defeated; he was mentioned in dispatches.<br>
<br>On 15 January 1844 Tombs was promoted first lieutenant, and on 1 March he was appointed to the horse artillery at Ludhiana. He served in the First Anglo-Sikh War (1845&#150;6) in the 1st troop, 1st horse artillery brigade. This troop had suffered so severely from fever, prevalent at Ludhiana, that it was at first contemplated that the whole troop be left behind, but on the evening of 13 December 1845 Tombs brought the good news to the barracks that four guns were to march at daybreak next day, leaving the other two and the sick troopers behind. They first marched to Bassian (28 miles), then, on 16 December, to Wadni, where the governor shut the gates and refused supplies until the British forces were got into position, when he submitted. After a short march on 17 December, and a long and tedious one of 21 miles the following day, Mudki was reached, and, while the camp was being formed, the alarm was given and the battle began. Tombs's troop was hotly engaged, and its captain, Dashwood, died of his wounds. At the battle of Ferozeshahr on 21 December, Tombs was with his troop at headquarters, and engaged in the attack on the southern face of the Sikh entrenchment.<br>
<br>In the operations of January 1846, including the action of Badiwal (21 January), and culminating in the battle of Aliwal on 28 January, Tombs was acting aide-de-camp to Sir Harry George Wakelyn Smith, and was mentioned in dispatches. He served in the second Sikh or Punjab campaign as deputy assistant quartermaster-general of the artillery division, and was at the action of Ramnagar on 22 November 1848, at the battle of Chilianwala on 13 January 1849, and at the crowning victory of Gujrat on 21 February. He was mentioned in dispatches and was recommended for a brevet majority as soon as he attained the rank of captain.<br>
<br>Tombs was employed on special duty in 1849 and 1850. On 12 March 1850 he was appointed a member of the special committee of artillery officers at Ambala. On 30 October he was appointed adjutant and quartermaster of the 2nd brigade, horse artillery, and on 13 November adjutant of the Ambala division of artillery. On 30 November 1853 he was transferred to the foot artillery. He was promoted captain in the Bengal artillery on 25 July 1854, and brevet major for his services in the field on 1 August. On 27 November 1855 he returned to the horse artillery.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the Indian mutiny in 1857 Tombs was at Meerut commanding the 2nd troop, 1st horse artillery brigade, and on 27 May moved with the column of Brigadier-General Archdale Wilson to co-operate with a force which the commander-in-chief was bringing down from Ambala. On approaching Ghazi-ud-din-Nagar, on the left of the River Hindan, on the afternoon of 30 May, the heat being very great, the column was attacked by the rebels. The iron bridge spanning the Hindan was held, and Tombs dashed across it with his guns and successfully turned the right flank of the enemy, who were repulsed. Tombs's horse was shot under him during this action, and again in that of the following day, when the village of Ghazi was cleared. He marched with Wilson on 5 June to Baghpat, crossed the Jumna, and joined the Ambala force under Sir Henry Barnard at Panipat on 7 June.<br>
<br>The combined forces marched from Alipur on 8 June, and Tombs, with his troop, was detached to the right with a force under Brigadier-General Hope Grant to cross the Jumna Canal, and so get in rear of the enemy at Badli-ki-sarai. The rebels fought desperately, but the British bayonet carried the day, and the cavalry and horse artillery converted the enemy's retreat into a rout. Tombs had two horses shot under him.<br>
<br>Tombs served all through the siege of Delhi. On 17 June he commanded a column which captured the <i>idgah</i> battery and took a 9-pounder gun. This battery was on the south-west of Paharipur, opposite the curtain between the Lahore gate and Garstin bastion; it was enclosed in a fort, and threatened to enfilade the British position. Tombs had two horses shot under him, and was slightly wounded. Sir Henry Barnard, the same evening at the staff mess, thanked Tombs for his gallantry, and proposed his health. Lord Roberts later wrote:<blockquote>The hero of the day was Harry Tombs &hellip; an unusually handsome man and a thorough soldier &hellip; As a cool, bold leader of men Tombs was unsurpassed &hellip; He was somewhat of a martinet, and was more feared than liked by his men until they realised what a grand leader he was. (Roberts, 96)</blockquote>Tombs also commanded a column in the action of 19 June under Hope Grant.<br>
<br>On 9 July 1857 Tombs went to the aid of Lieutenant James Hills (later Sir James Hills-Johnes) of Tombs's troop, who was attacked by some rebel cavalry while he was posted with two guns on picquet duty at &#145;the mound&#146; to the right of the camp. Tombs ran through with his sword a sowar who was on the point of killing Hills: both Tombs and Hills received the VC.<br>
<br>Tombs commanded the artillery of the force under Brigadier-General John Nicholson at the battle of Najafgarh on 25 August 1857, when the enemy endeavoured to intercept the siege-train coming from Ferozepore, and were defeated. He commanded no. 4 battery, of ten heavy mortars, during the Delhi siege operations in September, and he commanded the horse artillery at the assault on 14 September, when he was wounded. He was promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel on 19 January, and was made a CB, military division, on 22 January 1858 for services at the siege of Delhi.<br>
<br>In March 1858 Tombs, in command of the 2nd troop of the 1st brigade of Bengal horse artillery, joined the artillery division, under Sir Archdale Wilson, of Sir Colin Campbell's army assembled at the Alambagh for the attack on Lucknow. He took part in the siege and capture of the city, and was mentioned in general orders. Tombs commanded his troop in the operations for the subjugation of Rohilkhand with the force under Brigadier-General Walpole. He left Lucknow on 7 April for Malaon, and, after the unsuccessful attack on Ruilja, took part on the 22nd in the action at Aliganj, when the enemy were driven across the river and four guns were captured. On 27 April, Tombs, with this force, joined that of the commander-in-chief and marched on Shahjahanpur, which was found evacuated; on 3 May he was united with the troops commanded by Major-General R. Penny at Miranpur Katra, on 4 May arrived at Faridpur, a day's march from Bareilly, and on 5 May took part in the battle of Bareilly.<br>
<br>On 15 May, Tombs and his troop marched with the commander-in-chief's force to the relief of Shahjahanpur, and took part in the action of 18 May. On 24 May he commanded the artillery in a force under Brigadier-General Jones against Muhamdi, out of which the rebels were driven, and the force returned to Shahjahanpur on 29 May. He took part also in an expedition against Shahabad on the night of 31 May, returning to Shahjahanpur on 4 June, when, the rebels having been driven out of Rohilkhand, the field force to which Tombs was attached was broken up. Tombs was promoted on 20 July 1858 brevet colonel, and was praised by Lord Panmure, the secretary of state for war, in the House of Lords in proposing a vote of thanks to the army.<br>
<br>Tombs was promoted lieutenant-colonel, Royal Artillery, on 29 April 1861, and was appointed to the 2nd brigade. From 16 May 1863 he was appointed a brigadier-general to command the artillery brigade at Gwalior. In 1865 he received a good-service pension. In 1864 he commanded the force which recaptured Dewangiri in Bhutan, for which campaign he was on 14 March 1868 made a KCB. After the Bhutan expedition he returned to his duties as brigadier-general commanding the artillery at Gwalior. He was promoted major-general on 11 March 1867. Tombs married, on 1 March 1869, Georgina Janet, youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26532/', "Admiral Sir James Stirling")</script>; after his death, she married on 19 December 1877 Captain Herbert Stewart. On 30 August 1871 Tombs was appointed to command the Allahabad division of the army, and was transferred to the Oudh division on 24 October 1871. He became a regimental colonel of artillery on 1 August 1872. He was obliged to resign his command on account of ill health, and returned to England on sick leave. He died at Newport, Isle of Wight, on 2 August 1874.<br>
<br>At news of Tombs's death Lord Napier of Magdala issued a general order expressing regret at the loss of so distinguished an officer.<br>
