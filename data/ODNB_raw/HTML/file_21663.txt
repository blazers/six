<span class="headword">Paynter <span class="st"> [Cambourne]</span>,  William</span>  (1637&#150;1716), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was born at Trelissick in the parish of St Erth, Cornwall, and baptized on 7 December 1637, the son of William Paynter or Cambourne, from Antron in Sithney, and Jane, the sixth child of Richard Keigwin of Mousehole. He was thus a kinsman of John Keigwin, the Cornish scholar. He matriculated from Exeter College, Oxford, on 29 March 1656, having been admitted as a poor scholar in February of that year. On 3 July 1657 he was elected to a fellowship of the college. He graduated BA in 1660 and proceeded MA in 1663 (incorporated at Cambridge in 1664), BD in 1674, and DD in 1695.<br>
<br>In 1669, on the grounds that Paynter had been elected to one of the fellowships earmarked for candidates from Devon, Arthur Bury, the college rector and a devout Devonian, suspended Paynter's fellowship, together with those of several other Cornishmen. In spite of this rebuff, in 1685 Paynter gave &pound;100 to Exeter College. The same year he faced scandal when a child was laid at his door in college and was claimed to be his; it was later revealed that a disaffected undergraduate, John Jago, expelled by Paynter for debauchery, had tried to wreak revenge. It was not until 1686, having been appointed to the college living of Wootton, Northamptonshire, that Paynter actually vacated his fellowship.<br>
<br>Paynter married twice. Although the date of his first marriage is uncertain, it was possibly about the time of his appointment to Wootton rectory; his wife was Mary (1657&#150;1695), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6051/', "John Conant")</script> who had been rector of Exeter College during the interregnum, and his wife, Elizabeth. She was the widow of Matthew Poole MD of St Giles', Northampton. When probate was granted on Poole's will, on 15 March 1690, Mary was already married to Paynter. Mary died on 7 May 1695 and was buried at Wootton near her children, William and Elizabeth. On 16 May 1695, at Preston in Northamptonshire, Paynter married Sarah, daughter of Francis Duncombe of Broughton in Buckinghamshire.<br>
<br>On 15 August 1690, on the deprivation of Arthur Bury, Paynter was elected by a depleted fellowship to the rectorship of Exeter College. Bury appealed to the court of the king's bench which granted him management of the college until a definite decision on the legality of Bury's dismissal was made. The decision of the bench divided the Exeter fellowship; both Bury's supporters and his opponents attempted to run the college. The &#145;great Exeter schism&#146; resulted in double elections to fellowships and the disorder was not put right until 1694, when the House of Lords reversed the decision of the king's bench and confirmed Paynter as rector. He held the rectorship until his death, and, in 1698 and 1699, was vice-chancellor of the university.<br>
<br>Paynter retained the rectory of Wootton until his death there on 18 February 1716; he was buried there on 22 February. His will was proved through the court of the university chancellor on 2 April. His second wife, who survived him, died on 22 September 1725, and was buried at Ilsington, Devon. It is not certain whether they had any children but a Mary Paynter, probably their daughter, married Philip Nanson, the vicar of Ilsington, in Exeter Cathedral in 1723.<br>
