<span class="headword">Holker, Sir  John</span>  (1828&#150;1882), <span class="occ">judge and politician</span>, was born in Bury, Lancashire, the son of Samuel Holker, a manufacturer there, and his wife, Sarah, daughter of John Brocklehurst of Clitheroe, Lancashire. He was educated at the Bury grammar school, and, though at first intended for the church, was articled to a solicitor by the name of Eastham of Kirkby Lonsdale, Westmorland. After some years he entered Gray's Inn, where he was called to the bar in 1854, and then became first a bencher and in 1875 treasurer. After a short time in London he joined the northern circuit, and settled in Manchester. For some time, he got little work and was nicknamed &#145;sleepy Jack Holker&#146; by his fellow barristers. According to an obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span> he was a<blockquote>tall, plain, lumbering Lancashire man, who never seemed to labour a case nor to distinguish himself by ingenuity or eloquence, but through whom the justice of his cause appeared to shine as through a somewhat dull but altogether honest medium. (<span class="italic">The Times</span>)</blockquote>On 5 September 1861 he married Janis, daughter of James Wilson of Eccles, Lancashire; they had no children.<br>
<br>After ten years building a miscellaneous practice, Holker finally distinguished himself through his work in a parliamentary committee on the <span class="roman">Stalybridge and Ashton Waterworks Bill</span>, and moved to London in 1864. He became queen's counsel in 1866, and at once took a leading position on his circuit; he was so successful in his first patent case at his first assize as a queen's counsel that patent became the mainstay of his practice.<br>
<br>In 1872 Holker won a by-election as a Conservative at Preston. The election was the first under the <span class="roman">Ballot Act</span> and attracted much attention. At the same time, the Tichborne case, which absorbed many of the best-known leaders at the bar, opened up opportunities for him in London where he was little known until then, and gave him a lot of work. After the death of his first wife, on 13 January 1874 he married Mary Lucia Richardson, daughter of Patrick McHugh of Cheetham Hill, Manchester; they had no children.<br>
<br>At the general elections in 1874 and in 1880 Holker was re-elected for Preston. He was appointed solicitor-general by the prime minister Disraeli and was knighted (1874). On the appointment of Sir Richard Baggallay to the Court of Appeal in November 1875, Holker became attorney-general. His practice became enormous, and his income for two consecutive years was &pound;22,000 a year. Persuasiveness, shrewdness, and tact made him extraordinarily successful in winning verdicts.<br>
<br>In the House of Commons, Holker proved a successful law officer: he opposed Bass's bill to abolish committals for contempt in county courts, vigorously attacked W. E. Gladstone's eastern policy in 1877, introduced the <span class="roman">Criminal Code Bill</span> and <span class="roman">Bankruptcy Bill</span>, and carried the <span class="roman">Summary Procedure Act</span> and <span class="roman">Public Prosecution Act</span> in 1879. It was known that he was anxious to become lord chief baron, but Sir Fitzroy Kelly was unwilling to quit, so Holker returned to private practice on the fall of Lord Beaconsfield's government in 1880. The Liberal prime minister, William Gladstone, who appreciated Holker's close powers of reasoning, appointed him a lord justice of appeal in January 1882, but he sat for only a few months before failing health led him to resign on 19 May. He died on 24 May 1882 at his house, 46 Devonshire Street, Portland Place, London. He had suffered from heart and kidney trouble for some time but died of inflammation of the lungs after a cold. He was buried on 30 May in his mother's grave at Lytham, Lancashire. His widow, a Roman Catholic, became quite a close friend of Gladstone.<br>
