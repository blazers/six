<div class="para">
<span class="headword">O'Brien,  James Francis Xavier</span>  (1828&#150;1905), <span class="occ">Irish nationalist</span>, born in Dungarvan, co. Waterford, Ireland, on 16 October 1828, was the son of Timothy O'Brien (<i>d</i>. 1853), a merchant there, who owned some vessels which traded between England, Ireland, and south Wales. His mother, Catherine, also belonged to an O'Brien family. James Francis Xavier was the sixth of their ten children. When Father Mathew, the total abstinence missionary, visited Dungarvan, O'Brien, then aged eight, took the pledge, which he kept until he was twenty-one. He was educated successively at private schools in Dungarvan and at St John's College, Waterford, where he was a student from autumn 1848 to summer 1849. On leaving he became involved in the secret revolutionary movement directed by James Fintan Lalor and others, which culminated in the abortive attack on the police barracks of Cappoquin in September 1849. A warrant was issued for O'Brien's arrest, but he escaped to Wales in one of his father's vessels.<br>
<br>On his return to Ireland O'Brien engaged, at first at Lismore and then at Clonmel, in the purchase of grain for the export business carried on by his father and family. After his father's death in 1853 he gave up this occupation in order to study medicine. In 1854 he gained a scholarship at the Queen's College, Galway, but left in 1855 to accompany a political friend, John O'Leary, to Paris, where he continued his medical studies. He attended lectures at the &Eacute;cole de M&eacute;decine, and visited the hospitals of La Piti&eacute;, La Charit&eacute;, and H&ocirc;tel Dieu. Among the acquaintances he formed in Paris were those of the artist James MacNeill Whistler and the Young Irelanders John Martin and Kevin Izod O'Doherty. Ill health led him to break off his medical studies. After returning to Ireland in 1856 he sailed for New Orleans, with the intention of seeking a new experience by taking part in William Walker's expedition to Nicaragua. Through the influence of Pierre Soule, then attorney-general for the state of Louisiana, O'Brien joined Walker's staff. He sailed with the expedition to San Juan and up that river to Fort San Carlos, but Walker made terms without fighting. On returning to New Orleans, O'Brien became a bookkeeper there and enjoyed considerable success in business. In 1859 he married Mary Louisa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cullimore (<i>d</i>. 1866), the widow of another emigrant, Patrick O'Brien. They had a son. On the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861 O'Brien signed up as assistant surgeon in a volunteer militia regiment for the defence of New Orleans, but saw no action.<br>
<br>Late in 1862 O'Brien returned to Ireland, and joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB), or Fenian organization, in Cork. He also contributed many letters to the Fenian newspaper the <span class="italic">Irish People</span>. He deemed the rising in 1867 to be premature, but on the night of 3 March 1867 he loyally joined his comrades at the rendezvous on Prayer Hill outside Cork, and led an attack upon the Ballynockan police barracks, which surrendered. The party seized the arms there, and marched on towards Bottle Hill, but scattered on the approach of a body of infantry. O'Brien was arrested near Kilmallock, and taken to Limerick gaol. He was subsequently taken to Cork county gaol, and in May tried for high treason. He was convicted, and was sentenced to be hanged, drawn, and quartered. The sentence was commuted to penal servitude for life. O'Brien was the last person to be sentenced to the barbarous punishment provided by the old law of treason. From Mountjoy prison, Dublin, he was soon taken with some twenty-nine other political prisoners, chained together in gangs on a gunboat, to Holyhead and then Millbank, where he was kept in solitary confinement for fourteen months. Next he was removed to Portland with others, chained in sets of six. In Portland he worked at stone-dressing. He was finally released on 4 March 1869 in the first batch of Fenian prisoners granted amnesty by Gladstone's newly formed cabinet. On visiting Waterford, and subsequently Cork, he received popular ovations.<br>
<br>He found that the leadership of the IRB had been reorganized in 1868 along representative lines under a supreme council. He made a major contribution towards the consolidation of this change by conveying that he knew the still-imprisoned Fenian notables to be opposed to the continuation of the old ascendancy of James Stephens. O'Brien and James O'Connor (another amnestied prisoner) seem to have assumed charge of the revival of the IRB and to have controlled the emergence of a new supreme council in the summer of 1869. O'Brien then or soon afterwards became president of the supreme council. It was he who proposed the significant innovation which saw Fenian resources being directed to having the imprisoned colleague Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa elected MP for Tipperary in November 1869. By 1874, however, O'Brien had left the leadership of the IRB, although he continued to associate with some of his old colleagues, including Charles J. Kickham, a successor of his as president of the supreme council.<br>
<br>Before his arrest O'Brien had worked with Cleary &amp; Co., a wholesale tea and wine business at Cork. He was re-employed on his release, and was soon appointed a traveller for the firm, a post which facilitated his Fenian business. From 1873 he was accountant with the Cork Gas Company. In 1882 he moved to Dublin as senior partner in the tea and wine business of W. H. O'Sullivan. In 1870 he had married Mary Teresa O'Malley, with whom he had three daughters and two sons.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, O'Brien was gradually drawn into the parliamentary home-rule movement under Parnell's leadership. He was nationalist MP for South Mayo from 1885 to 1895 and for Cork City from 1895 until his death. In the schism of 1891 he opposed Parnell. O'Brien's expertise in business and accountancy was turned to good use for party purposes. From 1886 he was <i>de facto</i>, and then formally, a treasurer of the Irish Parliamentary Party. From 1888 (in which year he moved to London with his family) he was treasurer and (from 1890) secretary of the Irish National League of Great Britain. In 1900 he became general secretary of the United Irish League of Great Britain, an office which he held for life. He died at his home, 39 Gauden Road, Clapham, on 28 May 1905, and was buried on 1 June in Glasnevin cemetery, Dublin.<br>
