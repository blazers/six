<span class="headword">Edwards <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Newton]</span>,  Monica Le Doux</span>  (1912&#150;1998), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 8 November 1912 in Belper, Derbyshire, the second daughter and third of the four children of the Revd Harry Newton (<i>d</i>. 1939) and Beryl F. Le Doux, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sargeant (<i>d</i>. 1969?). Her early education was at Beecholm College, Thornes House School, and Wakefield high school.<br>
<br>In 1927 Harry Newton left St Andrew's, Wakefield, for the living of Rye Harbour, Sussex. There, though her sister was sent to school and her two brothers had a tutor, Monica's education ceased. She roamed Rye Harbour, sailed with fishermen, rode shepherds' ponies, and helped at a riding school. After a year of freedom she was sent to St Brandon's School for the daughters of clergy in Bristol. Monica hated the school, but encountered a good English teacher who encouraged her to write.<br>
<br>In 1928 the Rye Harbour lifeboat was lost and Monica walked the shore helping to identify the bodies of the crew as they were washed up. Many of them were her friends. She wrote of this in <span class="italic">Storm Ahead</span> (1953).<br>
<br>One of Monica's friends was William Ferdinand (Bill) Edwards (1903&#150;1990), a part-time fisherman, nearly ten years her senior. They worked on an acrobatic and tumbling routine which they performed between the acts at local theatres and pageants and which was pictured on postcards. Her parents felt she was too young to marry and suggested a separation until she was twenty-one. Monica obeyed, but on 10 November 1933, two days after her twenty-first birthday, she married Bill Edwards and her father officiated. They had two children, a daughter, Shelley, born in 1935, and a son, Sean, born in 1943.<br>
<br>By 1946 Monica, living in Send, near Woking, was hankering for country life. She bought Pitlands Farm, Thursley, Surrey, a near derelict, mainly seventeenth-century farmhouse, at an auction. They renamed it Punch Bowl Farm and Bill Edwards gave up his job as a lorry driver to make the house habitable and farm the land. Monica learned to milk and, finding herself the breadwinner, began to write the first of her thirty-five books.<br>
<br>In 1947 two books for children were published. <span class="italic">Wish for a Pony</span> was the first of the fifteen Rye Harbour / Romney Marsh series which drew on her girlhood experiences. Edwards always regretted that it was her most successful work and, to her indignation, labelled her as a writer of pony books. She always asserted that the ponies were only incidental in her stories of country life. <span class="italic">No Mistaking Corker</span>, the first of the eleven Punchbowl Farm series, was a disappointing second work but after it Monica seemed to find her voice: one book a year in each series followed with reliable regularity.<br>
<br>All her child characters were middle class and Tamzin Grey, the protagonist of the Marsh books, was, like Monica, the daughter of an absent-minded vicar. The sea and boats are central to this series covering five years in the lives of the chief characters&#151;two boys and two girls. Their adventures include shipwreck, smuggling, and the rescue of oiled seabirds and a dolphin. Monica was delighted when she was compared with Arthur Ransome; she much admired his work and acknowledged his influence.<br>
<br>The Punchbowl Farm children are concerned with farming the land and the joys and tragedies of caring for their animals. Yet they also have adventures involving the supernatural (<span class="italic">The Spirit of Punchbowl Farm</span>, 1952), buried treasure (<span class="italic">Frenchman's Secret</span>, 1956), a heath fire (<span class="italic">Fire in the Punchbowl</span>, 1965), and an escaped puma (<span class="italic">The Wild One</span>, 1967).<br>
<br>In 1960 Monica Edwards was voted children's writer of the year, jointly with Captain W. E. Johns, the creator of Biggles. She took her writing seriously and her style improved over the years. She believed that books for children needed strong plots and careful research; she was proud of the fact that she used actual locations and real animals. She was a strong-minded person and the authorial voice is sometimes evident: the reader is told rather than left to discover and, even when death and disaster are involved, emotion is held firmly in check.<br>
<br>Edwards also wrote for adults. These autobiographical books convey her love of the countryside and her passion for wildlife. The first, <span class="italic">The Unsought Farm</span> (1954), described the renovation of the house and the development of her farm. It was followed by <span class="italic">The Cats of Punchbowl Farm</span> (1964) and <span class="italic">The Badgers of Punchbowl Farm</span> (1966). In 1968 Bill Edwards had a horrific tractor accident, chronicled in <span class="italic">The Valley and the Farm</span> (1971). He survived his severe head injuries but during his long spell in hospital it was decided that the farm must be sold. They were able to keep Smallbrook valley and the old orchard on which they built a bungalow, Cowdray Cross. Without the farm, Monica had more time for badger watching, reading, gardening, and travelling abroad. She was also president of the Thursley Horticultural Society. Her last book, <span class="italic">Badger Valley</span> (1976), utilized the meticulous field notes which she kept from many nights watching and photographing badgers with specially designed equipment.<br>
<br>Bill Edwards died in 1990. When Monica's sight began to fail and she could no longer walk in the valley, the badgers, missing her treats of raisins and peanuts, made regular visits to her at the bungalow. Monica Edwards died on 18 January 1998. Her ashes were buried with Bill's in Smallbrook valley, which she left to the Woodland Trust. There is no memorial.<br>
<br>The readership of Monica Edwards's children's books began to fall while she was still writing. She ascribed this to television and a changing world. Collins failed to reissue the books after the mid-1970s. Goodchild republished nine of the titles in the 1980s, but they did not appeal to the new generation of children. However, her erstwhile fans remember the books with great affection, there are many collectors, and secondhand copies are hard to find. The autobiographical books, also out of print since the late 1970s, were reissued in large print in the 1990s. Their picture of rural life in the pre-technology era is historically interesting, but the descriptions of badger watching cannot compete with the intimate photography of television's wildlife programmes.<br>
