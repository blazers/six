<span class="headword">&AElig;thelfrith</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>616), <span class="occ">king of Northumbria</span>, was the son of &AElig;thelric. He succeeded to the throne of Bernicia in 592, and in 604 to the joint Northumbrian kingdom of Deira and Bernicia which he ruled until 616. His first wife was Bebba, who is traditionally said to have given her name to the royal site of Bebbanburh, or Bamburgh. But it was his marriage to his second wife, Acha, princess of Deira, which cemented &AElig;thelfrith's claim to Deira. He is the first historically attested ruler of Northumbria, and, in his relatively long reign, established that kingdom as a major political force in Britain.<br>
<br>&AElig;thelfrith is described by Bede in the early eighth century as a heroic war leader almost in the terms of epic poetry:<blockquote>a very brave king and most eager for glory. He ravaged the Britons more extensively than any other English ruler. &hellip; For no ruler or king had subjected more land to the English race or settled it, having first either exterminated or conquered the natives. (Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 1.34)</blockquote>This land taking and settlement can perhaps be seen reflected in the scattered late sixth-century pagan burial-grounds of co. Durham and Northumberland, and certainly his name was well known in British sources where he was called Flesaur&#151;the Artful. By <i>c</i>.602 &AElig;thelfrith's conquests threatened the Irish immigrants living in Dalriada (modern Argyll) and their formidable king, Aedan, son of Gabran, marched against him with a very strong army. At a place known as Degsastan (plausibly Addinston, Berwickshire), &AElig;thelfrith defeated him, so that Aedan's army was &#145;cut to pieces&#146; and he fled with a handful of survivors  (Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 1.34). After this defeat, according to Bede, the Irish in Britain were discouraged from warring against the English until his day.<br>
<br>Having made safe his northern frontiers, &AElig;thelfrith turned his attention to the Britons of Wales in an attempt to secure territory in the west and to cut off the Welsh from the British peoples in the north. He assembled a great army and attacked the Britons, led by the king of Powys, Selyf Sarffgadau, at Chester, some time between 613 and 616. &AElig;thelfrith, who was a heathen, observed a large group of clerics standing apart from the British army, surrounded by guards, and asked who they were and for what purpose they had gathered there. On hearing that they were monks from the monastery of Bangor Is-coed who had come to pray for the British troops, he ruthlessly said, &#145;If they are praying to their God against us, even if they do not bear arms, they are fighting against us, assailing us as they do with prayers for our defeat&#146;  (Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 2.2). So he ordered them to be attacked first, killing, according to Bede, 1200 of them. He then won the battle, although not without heavy losses.<br>
<br>By that time &AElig;thelfrith was the dominant ruler in north Britain, while south of the Humber the most powerful ruler was R&aelig;dwald, king of the East Angles, at whose court Eadwine, the exiled heir of the Deiran throne, had taken refuge. &AElig;thelfrith sent messengers with large sums of money demanding that Eadwine should be killed, and later, further messengers with larger bribes threatening to make war on R&aelig;dwald if he did not kill or surrender Eadwine. The East Anglian king was almost ready to give in to the demands, but his wife persuaded him that no honourable man would betray his guest for bribes; no doubt R&aelig;dwald also felt that to surrender to &AElig;thelfrith's threats would be to give up his own pre-eminent position in southern England. As soon as the messengers had gone, R&aelig;dwald gathered a large army and marched against &AElig;thelfrith, who did not have time to assemble a comparable force. At a battle by the River Idle, on the border between Mercia and Northumbria, <i>c</i>.616, &AElig;thelfrith was defeated and killed, and the victorious R&aelig;dwald established Eadwine as king of Northumbria.<br>
<br>&AElig;thelfrith's seven sons and many of his young nobles fled into exile among the Dalriadan Irish and the Picts. The northern recension of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> preserves the names of his sons as Eanfrith, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20916/', "Oswald")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20930/', "Oswiu")</script>, Oslac, Oswudu, Oslaf, and Offa. In the longer term, it was &AElig;thelfrith's lineage which prevailed in Northumbria and three of his sons, Eanfrith, Oswald, and Oswiu, succeeded Eadwine, followed by his grandson <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37384/', "Ecgfrith")</script>.<br>
