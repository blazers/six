<span class="headword">Standish,  Myles</span>  (<em>c.</em>1584&#150;1656), <span class="occ">soldier and colonist</span>, was born at Ellanbane, Lezayre parish, on the Isle of Man, the second of three sons born to John Standish and Christian Lace. The strongest clues to his parentage come from his will, in which he refers to certain lands in Lancashire &#145;Surruptuously Detained from mee&#146;. This claim has led past historians to suppose that Standish was from Lancashire; however, it now appears that he was descended from an Ormskirk, Lancashire, branch of the family which had dwelt on the Isle of Man for several generations. If so, his will refers to lands which passed wrongfully to his younger brother William, his older brother John having died young. While the above seems the likeliest construction of his ancestry, genealogists have not established the facts conclusively.<br>
<br>Little is known of Standish's life before his emigration to America. He apparently had some schooling, for at his death his estate included an impressive library, and he served as treasurer for Plymouth Colony for five years. According to a contemporary, he &#145;went over into the Low Countries, and was a soldier there, and came acquainted with the [English separatist] Church at Leiden&#146;  (Morton, 170). Again, the likeliest scenario is that, at about age seventeen, he joined the English forces at Ostend in 1601. Before the truce with Spain in 1609 he may have attained an officer's rank, but nowhere has this been verified. He probably lived in Leiden while serving in the peacetime garrisons of Holland until 1616. There is no evidence that he ever formally joined the English separatists' church either in Holland or in America, so he may have attended the English Reformed church in Leiden, as this congregation included many English and Scottish families and single people.<br>
<br>In 1619 the Leiden separatists decided to establish a colony in Virginia, funded by a London-based company of merchant adventurers. Standish, already &#145;acquainted&#146; with the separatists, joined them as their captain-elect. After several false starts during the summer of 1620 the <i>Mayflower</i> left Plymouth on 6 September 1620, carrying Standish, his wife, Rose (<i>d</i>. 1621), and 100 other passengers on a sixty-six-day voyage across the northern Atlantic [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93695', "Pilgrim Fathers")</script>]. The ship made landfall at Cape Cod on 11 November 1620, and immediately steered south, intending to make Hudson's River (later New York), which was part of the Virginia Company's patent. After attempting the treacherous shoals south of the cape, however, the <i>Mayflower</i> put into the harbour at what is now Provincetown, Massachusetts. Clearly outside their legal patent, some of the passengers, many of whom were not separatists, threatened to go their own way. Fearing anarchy, the colony leaders drafted an agreement, now known as the Mayflower Compact, declaring the colonists a &#145;civil body politic&#146; and binding all signers to obedience thereto. Standish signed the document, as did nearly every adult male. The settlers spent more than a month at Cape Cod, sending out armed parties under Standish's leadership to reconnoitre the area. Ill-advisedly these parties purloined some stores of Indian corn they found, and desecrated several graves. Eventually a party of Nauset Indians retaliated, attacking the English one morning in their encampment. No one was hurt in the ensuing exchange of arrows and bullets, and the Indians withdrew.<br>
<br>Finding Cape Cod inhospitable, another party, including Standish, crossed Cape Cod Bay and, after being nearly lost in a storm, drove their boat onto an island, which proved to be within a harbour &#145;fit for situation&#146;  (Bradford, 72). They selected this site, which they subsequently named New Plymouth, for settlement and brought the <i>Mayflower</i> into the harbour. Poorly prepared for the sharp New England winter, the settlers suffered heavy losses from sickness; half the company died by springtime. Standish's wife, Rose, was among these, but Standish himself seems to have been one of the few not affected by the sickness, and an eyewitness praised his attentive care to the sick and dying. When nearby Indians contacted the settlers in March 1621, he participated in the negotiation of a treaty of alliance with Massasoit, a principal sachem of the Wampanoag people.<br>
<br>The first few years of the settlement saw initially friendly relations with Indians begin to fray. On several occasions the English responded to rumours of Indian hostility with displays of force. Standish led these demonstrations, and it is clear that he was not the best diplomat: on one occasion he threatened to burn an entire Indian village in retaliation for some petty theft. Nevertheless, in more reciprocal situations such as trading or negotiating alliances he was fairly successful, learning the local Indian dialect with proficiency.<br>
<br>Standish's most controversial actions occurred in March 1623. Relations with Massasoit, the settlement's chief supporter, had cooled ominously, especially after the arrival of another, less disciplined group of English at Wessagusset. But when one of the Plymouth colonists nursed the sachem through a dangerous illness, Massasoit told him of a cabal of Massachusett Indians planning to destroy the English at Wessagusset, and next at Plymouth. Reportedly, Massasoit advised making an example of the Massachusett, a task for which Standish needed no prodding. Taking a boat to Wessagusset with only eight men to avoid arousing suspicion, he found the English settlement there in severe disarray, with Indians openly threatening the English, and personally insulting Standish. Luring four of the Indians into a house, he and three of his men fell upon them, killing all except one, whom they subsequently hanged. He then evacuated the settlement, fought a sharp skirmish with enraged Massachusett on the retreat, and returned to Plymouth with the head of one of his victims. The incident all but destroyed relations with the Massachusett, and prompted the church's pastor in Holland to lament, &#145;Oh, how happy a thing it had been, if you had converted some before you had killed any!&#146;  (Bradford, 374&#150;5).<br>
<br>In the summer of 1623 more colonists came to Plymouth, among whom Standish found a second wife, Barbara (<i>d</i>. after 1659), who bore him three sons, John, Alexander, and Charles, by 1627. In the summer of 1625 he sailed to London to negotiate with the merchant backers of the colony, who had not seen a satisfactory return on their investments and were unwilling to keep the colony further supplied. An epidemic of plague had compelled the merchants to seek safety out of the city, however, so Standish returned the following April with only a supply of goods purchased on usurious credit. Another colonist took up the negotiations until, in November 1626, the merchants agreed to sell their interest to the Plymouth colonists for &pound;1800 in nine yearly payments. Eight principal planters, including Standish, became &#145;undertakers&#146; for the colony, agreeing to make the first six payments in exchange for a monopoly of the colony's trade during that time. The colonists were serious about protecting their trade with the Indians, which was their chief profit, and Standish led at least two forays against interlopers. One of these, Thomas Morton, established a trading post at a place he called Merry Mount. Morton and his men alarmed the Plymouth people by selling weapons and liquor to the Massachusett Indians, and by frolicking with Indian women. In 1628 Standish led a band of Plymouth men there, who arrested Morton and broke up his operation. In 1635 he headed his last military expedition against French intruders at Penobscot, in Maine; that effort failed, however. He was named a captain for planned intercolonial expeditions against the Narragansett Indians in 1643, and against the Dutch in 1653, but neither of these efforts went beyond the planning stages.<br>
<br>Standish was active in civil as well as military matters. He served frequently as assistant governor, and from 1644 to 1649 was the colony's treasurer. Together with several other families he founded the town of Duxbury in 1632, but offered to reside in Plymouth during the winters to be nearer the church. After the 1620s his years seem to have been relatively peaceful; he had a substantial dwelling in Duxbury, and his wife bore him at least four more children, Myles, Josias, Charles, and Lora.<br>
<br>Standish has been the subject of considerable romance since Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's epic poem <span class="italic">The Courtship of Myles Standish</span>. Barring Alden family tradition, there is no evidence to support the famous story of the widower Standish's wooing of young Priscilla Mullins (she subsequently married John Alden), nor any for the claim that he was secretly a Catholic. Even the common portrayal of him as a short man is debatable; when his grave was excavated in 1889, the remains indicated a man who had stood 5 feet 7 inches. His reputation for a short temper, however, seems justified; even an admirer conceded that Standish may have lacked &#145;that tenderness of the life of man which is meet&#146;  (Bradford, 375). In his old age Standish &#145;became sick of the stone, or stranguary&#146;  (Morton, 170). He made his will on 7 March 1656, and &#145;after his suffering much dolorous pain&#146;, died on 3 October 1656 at Duxbury, where he was buried.<br>
