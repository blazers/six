<span class="headword">Clark,  Albert Curtis</span>  (1859&#150;1937), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born at Salisbury on 21 February 1859, the eldest son of Albert Charles Clark, writing master at Haileybury College, and his wife, Ellen Curtis. He was educated at Hertford grammar school and later attended lessons with the sixth form at Haileybury, although he was not a member of the college. He was elected to a classical exhibition at Balliol College, Oxford, in November 1877 and went up in January 1878. After a brilliant undergraduate career, during which he gained first classes in classical moderation (1879) and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1881), and won the Ireland (1879) and the Craven (1882) scholarships, Clark was elected (1882) to a classical fellowship at Queen's College, where, first as lecturer (1882&#150;7), and then as tutor (1887&#150;1913), he not only proved himself a teacher and lecturer of exceptional ability, but won a worldwide reputation by the distinction and originality of his work on the text of Cicero's orations.<br>
<br>In 1895 Clark produced a full-scale edition of the <span class="italic">Pro Milone</span> (with English notes), which was followed by four volumes (1900&#150;11) containing the texts of many other speeches. To these must be added his edition of Asconius (1907). These volumes reveal scholarship, learning, and industry of the highest quality, and are notable among early <span class="roman">Oxford Classical Texts</span> for the variety and importance of their new material. Clark made a thorough collation and classification of the manuscripts, and threw new light on their history and value in his <span class="italic">Collations from the Harleian MS. of Cicero 2682</span> (1891), <span class="italic">The Vetus cluniacensis of Poggio</span> (1905), and the <span class="italic">Inventa Italorum</span> (1909). Of these <span class="italic">The Vetus cluniacensis</span> is his <i>chef d'oeuvre</i>, a masterpiece of erudition, detective ability, and constructive power in which he &#145;combined textual and historical evidence in a way that has not been surpassed&#146;  (Reynolds, 96). He made himself an expert palaeographer, and travelled regularly to the libraries of Europe to consult manuscripts.<br>
<br>In 1909 Clark was appointed university reader in Latin, a deserved tribute to the distinction of his work, and when in 1913 the Corpus Christi professorship of Latin fell vacant, his claim to the succession was universally acknowledged. He migrated to Corpus where he became a popular member of the common room. There is an elegant Latin memorial to him in the cloisters. Three minor works of considerable interest belong to the period of his readership: the <span class="italic">Fontes prosae numerosae</span> (1909), a collection of ancient evidences for Latin prose rhythms; <span class="italic">The Cursus in Mediaeval and Vulgar Latin</span> (1910), a fascinating study showing that the rhythms of classical oratory were preserved in medieval Latin, the only difference being that the classical rhythm was based on quantity and the medieval on stress accent; and <span class="italic">Prose Rhythm in English</span> (1913) in which he sought, not altogether successfully, to relate the Latin rhythms to those of English.<br>
<br>The works published by Clark during his tenure of the chair, despite their erudition and ingenuity, are on the whole less convincing. They are largely concerned with the application of stichometry to textual problems presented by the <span class="roman">Greek Testament</span>, a field in which he moved with less security, while his interest in this method had become almost an obsession. In his <span class="italic">Primitive Text of the Gospels and Acts</span> (1914) he employed it to explain the difference between the two main families of manuscripts, contending that the longer text of the <span class="roman">Codex Bezae</span> and its kindred represented the primitive form, and that the shorter version given by the <span class="roman">Codex Sinaiticus</span> and <span class="roman">Codex Vaticanus</span> was due to line omissions. To this scheme Clark returned in the elaborate edition of <span class="italic">The Acts of the Apostles</span> published in 1933; there, however, he laid less emphasis on stichometric principles and held that the shorter version of the <span class="roman">Acts</span> was largely due to deliberate revision. He also sought to show that the <span class="roman">Codex Bezae</span> came not from the West but from Egypt, and that the author of the <span class="roman">Acts</span> was not the author of <span class="roman">St Luke's gospel</span>. Clark was greatly disappointed by the reception of this work, to which he had devoted twenty years. It received favourable reviews from B. H. Streeter, provost of Queen's, in the <span class="italic">Oxford Magazine</span> and <span class="italic">Journal of Theological Studies</span>, but most <span class="roman">New Testament</span> scholars remained silent. Between the publication of these two works Clark returned to his first love in a learned and valuable work, <span class="italic">The Descent of Manuscripts</span> (1918), illustrated in the main from the text of Cicero, but extending its survey to the manuscripts of Plato and Demosthenes. Here again the importance of stichometry is perhaps overstressed.<br>
<br>In 1934 ill health and failing sight led Clark to resign his chair: he retired to London, where he died, unmarried, at St Mary's Nursing Home, Chiswick, on 5 February 1937. He received honorary degrees from the universities of Durham, Dublin, Manchester, and Oxford, and was elected an honorary fellow of his three colleges, Balliol, Queen's, and Corpus Christi and a fellow of the British Academy 1916. At Oxford he served on the hebdomadal council and was a curator of the Bodleian. Outside the university he was one of the earliest supporters of the Classical Association and a long-serving member of the classical journals board. Those who knew him paid tribute to his personal qualities: he could carry his learning lightly, was the best of company, full of humour and of wit, and a perfect raconteur; above all, he was courteous, warm-hearted, and kindly, ready with his help and counsel for all who sought it. As a scholar he won admiration; as a man, affection and regard.<br>
