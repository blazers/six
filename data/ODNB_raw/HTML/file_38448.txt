<span class="headword">Duff,  Adrian  Grant-</span>  (1869&#150;1914), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 29 September 1869, the third son of the Liberal MP who was to become governor of Madras, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33518/', "Sir Mountstuart Elphinstone Grant Duff (1829&#150;1906)")</script>, and his wife, Anna Julia Webster (<i>d</i>. 1915). Having been educated at Wellington College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Grant-Duff was commissioned second lieutenant in the Black Watch on 23 March 1889. He received his lieutenancy on 22 October 1890 and was further promoted to captain on 3 August 1898 following active service as commandant of the base depot during the Tirah expedition in 1897. He also served in the Transvaal during the closing stages of the South African War in 1902 before serving as adjutant to a rifle volunteer battalion. After passing through the Staff College, Camberley, he was appointed to the War Office in February 1905 as staff captain, becoming successively deputy assistant quartermaster-general and general staff officer, grade 2, there in March 1906. On 22 October 1906 he married the Hon. Ursula Lubbock (<i>b</i>. 1885), daughter of first Baron Avebury: they had one son and three daughters.<br>
<br>In October 1910 Grant-Duff, who had been promoted major on 12 December 1907, was appointed assistant military secretary to the committee of imperial defence, working on the &#145;war book&#146;, the catalogue of procedures to be followed by government departments in the event of war. Having received the CB for his services in 1913, Grant-Duff returned to his regiment at Aldershot in October and took command with the rank of lieutenant-colonel on 24 May 1914. Despite his father's political affiliation, Grant-Duff was utterly contemptuous of politicians and especially of the Asquith government, whose muddled handling of the Curragh incident in March 1914 he regarded as an appalling case of dragging the army into politics. Indeed he was deeply conservative and extremely pessimistic as to the future of British society. Nor did he approve of Haldane's army reforms although, unlike many contemporaries, he did not advocate conscription as a solution to the army's perceived manpower difficulties. Regarded as a brilliant and able soldier, Grant-Duff took his battalion to war in August 1914 but was killed in action in the battle of the Aisne in France on 21 September 1914. He was buried in Moulins new communal cemetery, Aisne; his son was also killed in action, with the Black Watch, in the Second World War.<br>
