<span class="headword">Gibbs, Sir  Roland Christopher <span class="st"> [Roly]</span></span>  (1921&#150;2004), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Gratwicke Hall, Barrow Gurney, near Bristol, on 22 June 1921, the younger son and youngest of the four children of Guy Melvil Gibbs (1889&#150;1959), a farmer and stockbroker who had served as a major in the North Somerset yeomanry in the First World War, and his wife, Margaret Olivia (1890&#150;1964), eldest daughter of Henry Percy St John. On his father's side he was related to the barons Aldenham and Hunsdon of Hunsdon, and on his mother's to the viscounts Bolingbroke and St John.<br>
<br>Gibbs went to Eton College in 1934, where he excelled at games, and from where he passed high into the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in 1939. In 1940 he was commissioned into the King's Royal Rifle Corps (60th rifles), moving to Egypt in 1941 with its 2nd (motor) battalion, with which he was to spend the remainder of the Second World War. He first saw action south of Benghazi in early 1942, but it was in June of that year, when commanding a Bren gun carrier platoon, that he first demonstrated clearly that he was a gifted fighting soldier. Although his platoon was attacked by armoured cars, and under heavy shellfire, he showed the greatest coolness in positioning an artillery forward observation officer and recovering a carrier that had been hit, for which he was awarded an immediate MC. Wounded twice in north Africa, he took part in the battles of Alam Halfa and El Alamein. He was promoted major in March 1943, commanding C company until the end of the war, fighting up the east coast of Italy until returning to England in January 1944 to prepare for the landings in Normandy. The battalion landed on D + 1, 7 June, becoming involved immediately in the battle for Caen. In July Gibbs was wounded again, and in August he narrowly avoided being taken prisoner while carrying out a reconnaissance. In February 1945 he was awarded the DSO for inspiring leadership during the battle of the Rhineland. After ending the war in Hamburg he moved with his battalion to Denmark, to arrange the disarming and removal of the German forces occupying that country. During the war Roly Gibbs, as he was invariably known, through his outstanding valour and leadership in continual combat over more than three years, had won universal confidence, because he always seemed to know exactly what to do and then did it. Quietly self-assured, relaxed, and with great personal charm, he had an understated style of command. One of his platoon commanders could not recall ever having received a direct order from him. &#145;If I were in your shoes&#146;, Gibbs would say, &#145;I would go about it like this&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>In 1945 Gibbs began his long association with the Parachute regiment, first as brigade major of the 5th Parachute brigade in Malaya, then volunteering to join the 7th battalion of the Parachute regiment in Palestine, and in 1948 returning to the newly re-formed Sandhurst as an instructor and the Parachute regiment representative. In 1951 he attended the Staff College, Camberley, and in 1957 the Joint Services Staff College, Latimer. From here he had his first and only experience of being a Whitehall staff officer, as a member of an inter-service planning team in the newly formed Ministry of Defence. On 27 October 1955 he married Davina Jean Merry (<i>b</i>. 1934), artist, elder daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Eoin James Henry Merry and his wife, Jean Trefusis, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Crichton, granddaughter of John Henry Crichton, fourth Earl Erne of Crom Castle. They had two sons, Joe (<i>b</i>. 1957) and James (<i>b</i>. 1958), and a daughter, Melissa (<i>b</i>. 1966). They lived at Patney Rectory, near Devizes, which they bought during his service.<br>
<br>Command of the 3rd battalion of the Parachute regiment (1960&#150;62) with the rank of lieutenant-colonel was followed by a year with the British army staff in Washington and promotion to brigadier to command 16th Parachute brigade in 1963. Almost immediately Gibbs and his brigade were posted to Cyprus, to reinforce troops policing the so-called &#145;green line&#146; separating Greeks and Turks. His skilful handling of his brigade, allied with his ability and readiness to negotiate with both sides, impressed his divisional commander, Major-General Michael Carver, as much as had his command of his rifle company in the war. From Cyprus he moved to Aden, as chief of staff to the commander-in-chief, Admiral Sir Michael Le Fanu. There he was deeply involved with the planning and execution of the complications of withdrawal from Aden and simultaneous short-term strengthening of the British presence in the Persian Gulf. He was appointed CBE in 1968 in recognition of his personal abilities and administrative skill. This period proved extremely valuable to him because, after spending 1969 at the Imperial Defence College, he returned to the Gulf as the last commander, British land forces, with the rank of major-general. It was his task to run down the British forces in the Gulf, to organize support for the sultan of Muscat and Oman, who was coming under increasing pressure in the Dhofar from Yemeni rebels, and to reorganize the Trucial Oman scouts into separate armed forces for each of the United Arab Emirates. His quiet but effective handling of affairs in the Gulf was much admired by all who witnessed or benefited from it, heightening his profile in the army and confirming him as a potential chief of the general staff. In 1972 this was marked by his accelerated promotion to lieutenant-general and command of the 1st British corps in Germany, where his apparently effortless qualities of leadership, sense of humour, and understanding and reading of his fellow men quickly earned him the respect and affection of those who had not come across him, or his style, before. He was knighted KCB the same year.<br>
<br>That Gibbs was destined for the top was confirmed by his promotion to general, and his appointment as commander-in-chief, UK land forces, in 1974. Nevertheless it was with reluctance that in 1976 he accepted his appointment as chief of the general staff. He was at heart a commander, happiest when leading or with soldiers rather than languishing behind a desk. Although he was never really at home in Whitehall, the then secretary of state for defence, Fred Mulley, said of him that, if the country had to go to war, Gibbs would be the man he would want to have beside him. However, even his critics had to concede that, while he appeared to wear his responsibilities lightly, when pressed for a decision, his judgements were usually right.<br>
<br>Simultaneously an ADC (general) to the queen from 1976 to 1979, Gibbs was promoted field marshal in July 1979 and retired to Wiltshire. From 1979 to 1991 he was a regional director of Lloyds Bank and a JP, from 1984 to 1990 chairman of the National Rifle Association, and from 1985 to 1990 the 155th constable of the Tower of London. He was appointed lord lieutenant of Wiltshire from 1989 to 1996; during the earlier years his elder brother, Colonel Sir Martin Gibbs (1920&#150;1992), was lord lieutenant of Gloucestershire. He also served as colonel commandant of his old battalion, now renamed the 2nd battalion the Royal Green Jackets (1971&#150;8), and of the Parachute regiment (1972&#150;7). An accomplished horseman and keen shot, he was a talented amateur artist. He died at Patney Rectory on 31 October 2004, of cancer of the prostate and of the sigmoid colon. He was survived by his wife and their three children.<br>
