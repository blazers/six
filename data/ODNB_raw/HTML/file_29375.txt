<span class="headword">Wiglaf</span>  (<em>fl. </em>827&#150;<em>c.</em>840), <span class="occ">king of the Mercians</span>, succeeded to the kingdom in 827, in very difficult circumstances. His predecessors Beornwulf and Ludeca had been killed in battle against the East Angles in 826 and 827; at the same time, King Ecgberht of Wessex had conquered the provinces of Kent, Surrey, Sussex, and Essex, formerly under Mercian control. Mercia's sudden decline seems to have been due to a continuing leadership crisis, which began with the death of King Cenwulf in 821 and was exacerbated by the deposition of Ceolwulf in 823. The origins of Beornwulf, Ludeca, and Wiglaf are obscure; they were probably regional rulers, strong enough to establish themselves on the throne, but not necessarily in a position to command the loyalty of all the Mercian factions. In 829 Ecgberht of Wessex conquered Mercia, deposed Wiglaf, and went on to receive the submission of the Northumbrians; he struck coins at the Mercian mint of London and a king-list indicates that he was briefly regarded as king of Mercia. But the annal for 830 in the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> remarks: &#145;In this year Wiglaf again obtained the kingdom of the Mercians&#146;  (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, text A, s.a. 828, <i>recte</i> 830). There is no real evidence that Wiglaf rebelled against Ecgberht's authority; nor can it be shown that he was a client king of Ecgberht, despite the impression given by the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> (essentially a West Saxon source for the ninth century), that Ecgberht's victories in 829 established him as overlord of all of southern England. This and other evidence does suggest, however, that some kind of political settlement arose between Wiglaf and Ecgberht.<br>
<br>There is no overt indication of West Saxon interference in Mercian affairs in the years immediately after 830 (the invasion of Wales by Ecgberht in that year would have had to have been launched from Mercia, but it may well have taken place before Wiglaf's restoration). Wiglaf had control of Middlesex in 831 and would therefore seem to have regained the vital port of London, but the London mint became moribund early in his reign and no Mercian coinage was produced until the early 840s. Wiglaf disposed of land and issued charters without reference to Ecgberht; the earlier of the two surviving diplomas in his name is dated to &#145;the first year of my second reign&#146;, which shows that Wiglaf was prepared to acknowledge the fact of his temporary deposition. It must remain an open question whether Wiglaf was restored in 830 by his own efforts or by those of Ecgberht; whatever the circumstances, Wiglaf's &#145;second&#146; reign appears to signal the beginning of a change in the relationship between Mercia and Wessex. The keynote is no longer a perennial hostility marked by frequent clashes, but rather a growing accommodation which matured into occasional alliances against the growing viking threat.<br>
<br>Perhaps bolstered by an understanding with Ecgberht, Wiglaf managed to secure his position in Mercia and went on to rule until about 840. The exact date of his death has not been preserved, but it is known that he was buried in a mausoleum at Repton. The eighth-century Mercian ruler &AElig;thelbald (<i>d</i>. 757) had also been interred at Repton; Wiglaf may have been a kinsman or descendant of &AElig;thelbald, but it is also possible that the place of his burial was chosen simply to associate him and his family with earlier greatness. His queen, Cynethryth, may have represented an alliance with another Mercian faction (Offa's queen had the same name), but she is known only from her attestations to Wiglaf's two diplomas. The earlier of these, which dates from 831, is also attested by Wiglaf's son, Wigmund. According to the <span class="italic">Passio sancti Wigstani</span>, which may be based on a ninth-century source, Wiglaf arranged for Wigmund to marry a daughter of King Ceolwulf named &AElig;lffl&aelig;d; they had a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39291/', "Wigstan")</script>, who was later murdered and venerated as a saint at Repton. The <i>passio</i> suggests that Wigmund did indeed become king after Wiglaf's death. There is no independent evidence to support this claim (although it must be admitted that the sources for this period are very poor indeed), and the fact that Wigmund does not attest Wiglaf's diploma of 836 may indicate that he died before his father.<br>
