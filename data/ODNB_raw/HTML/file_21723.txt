<span class="headword">Pearson,  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1764, <em>d.</em> 1836), <span class="occ">physician</span>, the son of Richard Pearson and Ann, possibly <i>n&eacute;e</i> Aris, was born in Birmingham, and baptized at St Philip's, Birmingham, on 9 June 1764. He was educated at Bishop Vesey's School, Sutton Coldfield, Warwickshire, from about the age of seven, and then at Dr Rose's school in Chiswick. His uncle was Thomas Aris (<i>d</i>. 1761), founder of the <span class="italic">Birmingham Gazette</span>. After the death of his parents he became, about 1779, a pupil of Thomas Tomlinson, a Birmingham surgeon and accoucheur; Tomlinson joined the staff of Birmingham General Hospital in January 1780. In 1782 Pearson was awarded the first gold medal of the Royal Humane Society for a dissertation on the clinical signs of death and suspended animation. His elder brother received the medal in London on his behalf; John Coakley Lettsom and John Fothergill were among the judges. Pearson entered the University of Edinburgh in the autumn of 1783 and gained the degree of MD on 24 June 1786. As a student he was president of the Royal Medical Society and of the Natural History Society at the university. His dissertation on scrofula was dedicated to Thomas Smith, a physician at Birmingham General Hospital and also an Edinburgh graduate, with whom he was later to work.<br>
<br>After qualifying Pearson travelled in Germany, Italy, France, and Austria, for two years, in the company of Thomas Knox (1753&#150;1840), later first earl of Ranfurley. After returning to England he became a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, on 22 December 1788. Pearson settled in Birmingham, living in New Street, and in June 1792 he was appointed <i>locum tenens</i> at the hospital in place of William Withering (1741&#150;1799), who was already very ill; the appointment was confirmed on 17 September. Pearson's marriage to Mrs Elizabeth [?] Startin produced a son, Richard (1795&#150;1853), later a cleric, and a daughter, Elizabeth Anne, who in 1834 married William Innes Pocock RN (1783&#150;1836).<br>
<br>Pearson resigned from Birmingham General Hospital on 19 December 1800, as did Thomas Smith, and moved to London, where he lived in Keppel Street, Bloomsbury; however, from 1803 he subscribed &pound;2 2<i>s</i>. a year to the hospital in Birmingham. On 3 February 1803 Pearson was elected FSA and became a member of the Medical Society of London, whose first paper he presented. He had moved to Reading by 1812, after which he lived briefly in Sutton Coldfield before returning in 1815 to Birmingham, where he spent the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Although retired, Pearson soon became involved in the preparations by William Sands Cox in 1825 for founding a medical school in Birmingham, of which Edward Johnstone was also a major supporter. Pearson gave the first introductory lecture, at its opening. He also published on a variety of topics: <span class="italic">Different Kinds of Airs</span> (1795), <span class="italic">Inflammatory Diathesis in Hydrophobia</span> (1789), in which he stressed his views against the contemporary practice of bleeding, and <span class="italic">The Bilious Fever of 1797, 1798 and 1799</span> (1799). In <span class="italic">The Epidemic Catarrhal Fever or Influenza of 1803</span> (1804) he incorporated the opinions of provincial practitioners treating the infection and noted the depression many patients suffered as a sequel to influenza. Pearson's other publications included <span class="italic">Materia medica</span> (1807), and works on salted fish (1812), on plague (1813), and on treatments for dropsy (1835).<br>
<br>Pearson had a considerable interest in natural history and botany and introduced <i>Lichen islandicus</i> to medicine for the alleviation of indigestion; he was an acknowledged authority on pharmacology. He was considered a sociable, convivial person, but some thought him eccentric. He died a widower at Birmingham on 11 January 1836 and was buried, at his own request, in the churchyard of St Paul's, Birmingham. In his will, made on 13 May 1834, as well as family bequests he left mourning rings to former medical school colleagues William Sands Cox and John Ingle; his medical books he gave to Dr John Eccles.<br>
