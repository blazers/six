<span class="headword">Abrams,  Harriett</span>  (<em>c.</em>1758&#150;1821), <span class="occ">singer and composer</span>, was, according to her niece's husband, Thomas Adolphus Trollope, the daughter of a man who came to England &#145;in the suite of some Hanoverian minister, in what capacity I never heard&#146;  (Trollope, 151). She was described by William Thomas Parke as a pupil of Thomas Augustine Arne, but this is not apparent from Arne's reference to her in a letter to David Garrick in September 1775. A soprano, she made her d&eacute;but on 28 October 1775 at Drury Lane Theatre, London, as the Little Gypsy in <span class="italic">May Day</span>, an afterpiece written for her by Garrick with music by Arne. William Hopkins, the company's prompter, noted in his diary:<blockquote>Miss Abrams (a Jew) about 17 Years old. She is very Small a Swarthy Complexion, has a very Sweet Voice &amp; a fine Shake, but not quite power enough yet&#151;both the Piece &amp; the Young Lady were receiv'd with great Applause. (Stein, 155)</blockquote>She sang for five seasons at Drury Lane in musical afterpieces and plays, notably as an Italian Girl in Sheridan's <span class="italic">The Critic</span> on 30 October 1779, and then became a concert singer. From 1781 until the end of the decade Miss Abrams was a leading London soloist, appearing in the Concerts of Antient Music, the Academy of Ancient Music, and concert series organized by Venanzio Rauzzini and Johann Peter Salomon. She sang at Salisbury, Cambridge, Winchester, Oxford, and Birmingham, at the Three Choirs meetings of 1781 and 1782, and in the Handel commemoration concerts at Westminster Abbey of 1784&#150;7 and 1790. Charles Burney, writing of the 1784 Handel performances, praised the sweetness, taste, and expression of her singing and noted that although her voice was not regarded as theatrical she was audible in every part of the abbey.<br>
<br>Harriett's sister, Miss G. Abrams, who took child roles at Drury Lane during Harriett's last two seasons there, was probably the Miss Abrams junior who sang with her sister in concerts in 1781&#150;2. Nothing more is known of her. Jane Abrams (<i>c</i>.1766&#150;1813/14) made her first appearance when she sang at Harriett's benefit concert in 1782, and a third sister, the contralto <a href="#cosubject_75583">Theodosia [<i>see below</i>]</a>, joined Miss Abrams and Miss Abrams junior in the Concerts of Antient Music in 1783. Jane appears to have withdrawn from public performance, while Harriett and Theodosia continued to appear as soloists and became particularly admired as a duo, the Miss Abrams. They sang together in public concerts and increasingly at private entertainments in the houses of the aristocracy. Harriett also organized concerts, including a series at the home of George Venables-Vernon, second Baron Vernon, in winter 1791&#150;2 when the oboist William Thomas Parke was one of the musicians she engaged. After 1791 the sisters' only advertised appearances were in Harriett's annual benefits, at which Joseph Haydn presided at the pianoforte in 1792, 1794, and 1795. Eliza (<i>c</i>.1776&#150;1831), the youngest of the Abrams sisters, played piano concertos in Harriett's 1788 and 1789 benefits and from 1790 also sang in vocal ensembles with her sisters. Two brothers, the violinist William and the cellist Charles, worked as professional musicians and, according to Doane's <span class="italic">Musical Directory</span> (1794), shared a house with their sisters. Flora Abrams, who played the violin at minor venues between 1776 and 1782, may have been a relative.<br>
<br>Harriett Abrams was a successful composer of songs, duets, and trios. She published two sets of Italian and English canzonets, a collection of sixteen Scottish songs harmonized for two and three voices, and, in 1803, a book of twelve songs dedicated &#145;with Her Majesty's most Gracious Permission&#146; to Queen Charlotte. There are also about a dozen separately published songs, several of which quickly appeared in editions in the USA. Her most frequently republished piece was <span class="italic">Crazy Jane</span> (1799), a setting of a poem by Matthew &#145;Monk&#146; Lewis, whose first biographer wrote: &#145;the ballad has been wedded to music by several composers; but the original and most popular melody was by the celebrated Miss Abrams, who introduced and sung it herself at fashionable parties&#146;  (Baron-Wilson, 189).<br>
<br>On 2 June 1791 Harriett was baptized at St George's, Hanover Square, together with Jane, Theodosia, Eliza, and their elder sister Charlotte, who married a few days later. In 1799 John Philip Kemble supped with the unmarried Abrams sisters at their London home, met them at the house of the earl and countess of Mount Edgcumbe, and dined with them at Broadstairs, Kent, in August. After Theodosia's marriage in 1804, the sisters retired to Devon to &#145;enjoy the well earned emoluments of their profession&#146;  (Lysons, 215). When Harriett made her will in 1819, she had &pound;5770 in stocks, the lease of a house in Montague Square, St Marylebone, and a small estate at Englefield Green, near Egham, Surrey. She died at Theodosia's home, The Braddons, South-Hill, Torquay, Devon, on 8 March 1821 and was buried at St Saviour, Tormoham, Devon, on 12 March 1821. According to Mount Edgcumbe, Harriett, Theodosia, and Eliza, &#145;who were unrivalled in their line, and whose united voices formed the very perfection of harmony&#146;  (Edgcumbe, 1824, 142), continued to sing together to the delight of their friends until shortly before Harriett's death.<br>

<a name="cosubject_75583"></a><span class="headword">Theodosia Abrams <span class="st"> [<em>married names </em>Fisher, Garrow]</span></span>  (<em>c.</em>1769&#150;1849), <span class="occ">singer</span>, seems to have made her d&eacute;but in the Concerts of Antient Music in 1783, and she was the youngest of the principal vocal performers listed for the 1784 Handel commemoration concerts. She then appeared in almost every concert and private entertainment in which Harriett performed, singing as a soloist as well as in ensembles. On 6 August 1804, at Plympton St Maurice, Devon, she married the 21-year-old Thomas Fisher (1782&#150;1810), a captain in the North Devon militia, who died in May or June 1810, leaving her with two children, Charles and Harriett. On 17 March 1812, at St Margaret's, Westminster, she married Joseph Garrow (1789&#150;1857), the clever, musical, and artistic son of a Scottish father and Indian mother, who had trained as a lawyer but never practised. Their only child, Theodosia [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27754/', "Trollope, Theodosia")</script>], was born on 28 November 1816. The Garrows lived in Torquay, where Joseph became the friend and correspondent of Walter Savage Landor and where the poet Elizabeth Barrett found him &#145;a sensible intelligent man &amp; an active magistrate&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Elizabeth Barrett Browning</span>, 1.316). On a continental tour with her parents, the younger Theodosia met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27755/', "Thomas Adolphus Trollope")</script>, elder brother of the novelist Anthony Trollope, and they married in April 1848. Tom Trollope remembered his mother-in-law as still vigorous, &#145;a very fierce old lady&#146; with &#145;brilliant and fierce black eyes&#146;  (Trollope, 156). He relates how the composer and pianist John Baptist Cramer had told him admiringly that she had been able to pick out a false note played by a single instrument in a large orchestra. Mount Edgcumbe described Theodosia's voice as the most beautiful contralto he had ever heard, and found it still unimpaired in 1834. Her health declined after the death of her daughter Harriett in Florence on 12 November 1848 and the Garrows returned to England the following June. She died at her home, The Braddons, South-Hill, Torquay, Devon, on 4 November 1849. Her death was attributed on her death certificate to deranged digestion, abscess, and exhaustion. She was buried at St Saviour, Tormoham, Devon, on 8 November 1849.<br>
