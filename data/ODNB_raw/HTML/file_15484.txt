<span class="headword">Kett,  Henry</span>  (1761&#150;1825), <span class="occ">college teacher and writer</span>, was born in the parish of St Peter Mancroft, Norwich, on 12 February 1761, the son of Benjamin Kett, cordwainer and freeman of that city, and his wife, Mary. He was educated at Norwich grammar school, and in March 1777 was admitted to Trinity College, Oxford. In June he was elected to a Blount exhibition and, the following year, to a scholarship. In 1784 he was elected to a fellowship at Trinity, in which he remained for almost forty years. He undertook various college offices, was an able and kindly tutor, and an impressive preacher who made no enemies within the college. He was a well-regarded Bampton lecturer in 1790, select preacher in 1801&#150;2, classical examiner in 1803&#150;4, and senior fellow of Trinity from 1803. Yet he never achieved the college presidency or any position of real distinction in university life. This failure may be attributed to an apparent lack of purpose or ambition; his interests were eclectic and he enjoyed the lighter side of life.<br>
<br>Kett's long face and straight, bony nose made him the victim of incessant teasing. His perceived equine features earned a crude nickname, Horse Kett, and a wide range of jokes, both learned and puerile (&#145;an oat&#146;&#151;that is, a note&#151;through his door), which he unfailingly took in very good part. A famous verse was composed about his poetical aspirations by his Trinity colleague Thomas Warton:<blockquote>
<div>Our Kett not a poet<br>
</div>
<div>Why how can you say so?<br>
</div>
<div>For if he's no Ovid<br>
</div>
<div>I'm sure he's a Naso.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Equally well known was Dighton's caricature of the tall, lean figure published as &#145;A view from Trinity College&#146; in 1807.<br>
<br>Kett's life had several fresh, or false, starts. His first venture was poetry. In 1793 he stood for the professorship of poetry at Oxford, publishing his <span class="italic">Juvenile Poems</span> in support of his case, but he was defeated by James Hurdis by twenty votes. In 1799 he published <span class="italic">History the Interpreter of Prophecy</span>, which had appeared in three editions by 1800. His translations of John Jortin's poems were published in Jortin's <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Works</span>. In 1802 the professorship was again vacant; Kett canvassed but did not stand.<br>
<br>By then Kett was focusing on the theory and practice of education. In 1802 he published <span class="italic">Elements of General Knowledge</span>, a two-volume work based on his own lectures and including moral guidance and detailed bibliographies for the undergraduate and schoolboy. This work was criticized by John Davison in <span class="italic">A Short Account of Certain Notable Discoveries Contained in a Recent Work</span> (1804) but was resolutely defended by its author, who published, as &#145;S Nobody of King's College, Oxford&#146;, <span class="italic">The Biter Bit, or, Discoveries in a Pamphlet of Certain Notable Discoveries</span> (1804); <span class="italic">Elements</span> ran to an eighth edition in 1815. Kett was more daring to tackle the issue of female education, with <span class="italic">Emily: a Moral Tale</span> (1809). Emily's exciting romance packs a wide range of moral teaching, natural history, and general knowledge into a simple narrative and epistolary structure. A second undergraduate text, <span class="italic">Logic Made Easy</span> (1809), was Kett's least successful work. His over-simplification of Aristotle provoked a vicious and personal attack from Edward Copelston, who prefaced <span class="italic">The Examiner Examined, or, Logic Vindicated</span> with a passage from <span class="italic">The Aeneid</span> ending &#145;Equo ne credite, Teucri&#146; (&#145;Do not trust the horse, Trojans&#146;). Crushed, Kett endeavoured to suppress the work.<br>
<br>Kett always had a penchant for the light-hearted. He contributed five papers to Thomas Monro's weekly publication, <span class="italic">Olla Podrida</span> (1788). He published a pleasant travel journal about the Lake District in 1798 and brought out his favourite bons mots as <span class="italic">The Flowers of Wit</span> (1814). He was a regular contributor to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> and wrote two short biographies: one, of William Benwell, appended to <span class="italic">Poems, Odes, Prologues and Epilogues Spoken at Reading School</span> (1804), and the other, a memoir of Henry Headley, which appeared in <span class="italic">Select Beauties of Ancient English Poetry</span> (1810).<br>
<br>A devout Christian, Kett endeavoured to live a godly life. In 1787 he was a major contributor to the fund organized by Samuel Parr for the destitute Dr John Uri, former cataloguer of oriental manuscripts. Kett wrote the preface and notes to <span class="italic">Beauties of Christianity</span> (1813), Shoberl's translation from the French of Chateaubriand. From the second year of his fellowship until 1804 he held the incumbency of Elsfield, Oxfordshire, from Trinity's president, Joseph Chapman. Between 1812 and 1820 he was vicar of Sutton Benger, Wiltshire, and in 1814 Bishop George Tomline appointed him to the sinecure of the perpetual curacy of Hykeham, Lincolnshire.<br>
<br>On Christmas eve 1823, aged sixty-two, Kett married Maria White at Dowdeswell, Gloucestershire, and left Oxford to live at her native Charlton Kings, in the same county. By all accounts his mental state was by now unstable and he was prone to depression; certainly he had withdrawn from active participation in college life for much of the preceding fifteen years. On 30 June 1825&#151;on a visit to Sir J. Gibbons at Stanwell, Middlesex&#151;he drowned while swimming. As late as 1870 Kett's loyal friends were robustly defending his reputation against allegations of suicide. However, the fact that he left instructions in his will that he be buried in the parish where he died but, were he to die in London, that he should be buried in Stanwell, where the vicar was a personal friend, surely suggests more than an accident. On 28 November 1828 his widow married Thomas Nicholl.<br>
<br>Kett, whose obituarist valued his estate at under &pound;25,000, made generous bequests to relatives in Norwich and Somerset; in addition, after Maria's death half his estate was to be divided between the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital, the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, and the Clergy Orphan's School at Regent's Park. He left meticulous instructions regarding the disposal of his manuscripts and copyrights. He had been generous to Trinity College throughout his life, supporting building projects and donating portraits, and on his death he bequeathed &pound;500 to the college's advowson fund, a final touch of irony from the man who had never wanted a college living.<br>
