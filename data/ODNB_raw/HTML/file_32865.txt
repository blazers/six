<span class="headword">Doubleday,  Herbert Arthur</span>  (1867&#150;1941), <span class="occ">publisher and genealogist</span>, was born at Hamburg, Germany, on 23 November 1867, the second son of the five children of William Bennett Doubleday, a woollen factor of London, and his first wife, Agnes Hannah Newman Fenn, of Beccles. Doubleday was educated at Dulwich College and London University, and served with various booksellers and publishers in London. In 1891 he founded the firm of Archibald Constable &amp; Co. with his stepmother's brother of that name, a grandson of Scott's publisher. Among other books they published works by Meredith and Conan Doyle, but their most important single project was the <span class="roman">Victoria History of the Counties of England</span>, conceived, designed, and launched mainly by Doubleday himself. On 30 September 1896 he married Katherine Alice Lucile 
    (Kate; <i>b</i>. 1871, <i>d</i>. after 1941)
  , the daughter of Thomas Lawrence, of Ratby, Leicestershire. They had two daughters. From 1901 to 1903 he was chief editor of the <span class="roman">Victoria History of the Counties of England</span>, and was then succeeded by William Page. Ten volumes of the history appeared under his sole editorship or in collaboration with Page. Doubleday possessed a keen appreciation of the qualities of good paper and type; both the <span class="roman">History</span> and later <span class="italic">The Complete Peerage</span> owed much to his skill and taste.<br>
<br>In 1903 Doubleday left Constable &amp; Co. and for a time lived in Bruges, where he published books in English and French. With Cuthbert Wilkinson he founded in 1908 the St Catherine Press (named after the Porte Ste Catherine in Bruges), a combination of two earlier enterprises, one in Bruges and one in London. The latter firm, Arthur Doubleday &amp; Co., had already produced some notable fine books including a reprint of Evelyn's <span class="italic">Sylva</span>. It was to the St Catherine Press that Vicary Gibbs entrusted his new edition of <span class="italic">The Complete Peerage</span>, and Doubleday designed the layout and chose the Caslon type for it. Almost from the first Doubleday's share was more than that of an ordinary publisher, and in volumes 3 and 4 his assistance was recognized by Gibbs on the title-page. In 1916 he formally became assistant editor and in 1920 editor. After Gibbs gave up control, Doubleday became solely responsible for producing <span class="italic">The Complete Peerage</span>. Under his direction, and with various colleagues, volumes 5 to 10 and volume 13 were issued. The fact that the whole enterprise did not collapse was due entirely to his unflagging energy in simultaneously organizing the work of writing the volumes and raising the funds to produce them. He himself contributed an important appendix, &#145;Earldoms and baronies&#146;, to volume 4, and in 1920 replied in print to a hostile review of this by J. H. Round. Doubleday continued to work on <span class="italic">The Complete Peerage</span> to within a few weeks of his death. His wide view of the scope of the work and his scholarly desire for authoritative reference to original sources make the later volumes (especially in their medieval matter) even more valuable to scholars than the first four volumes, which he always hoped one day to re-edit.<br>
<br>Doubleday was a stocky man of medium height and a games player all his life. Latterly, playing golf once a week was his sole relaxation from editorial work. He had a keen sense of humour and was a kindly and understanding man. He died of cancer at his home, 27 The Terrace, Barnes, Surrey, on 27 March 1941; he was survived by his wife.<br>
