<span class="headword">Taylor,  Theodore Cooke</span>  (1850&#150;1952), <span class="occ">woollen manufacturer and politician</span>, was born at New Hall, Carlinghow, Batley, West Riding of Yorkshire, on 3 August 1850, the eldest son of Joshua Taylor (1821&#150;1879), cloth manufacturer, and his wife, Alice (<i>d</i>. 1860), daughter of Samuel Cooke, carpet manufacturer of Liversedge, West Riding of Yorkshire. He was educated at a preparatory school in Batley and at Batley grammar school. At the age of thirteen he moved to the northern Congregational school at Silcoates near Wakefield, a school for nonconformist ministers and laymen. He left at the age of sixteen and entered the family woollen business, with which he was to be connected until his death eighty-six years later. His grandparents had been clothiers in the Batley district. In 1845 his father had founded a cloth manufacturing firm at Blakeridge, Batley, as the junior partner of two older brothers, John (1816&#150;1884) and Thomas (1818&#150;1891); Joshua Taylor worked at Blakeridge Mill as a cloth finisher. Theodore, on entry to the business, gained experience in all its departments, as was common practice at the time. In 1874 he married Sara Jane, his first cousin and daughter of W. J. P. Ingraham of Philadelphia, USA. She had been born in England and Theodore met and courted her on her visits as a girl to her English relations. They had three children, Evelyn Sarah, Lilian Gertrude, and Laurie.<br>
<br>The heavy woollen district of Yorkshire, within which the Taylors' firm was situated, was benefiting from its success in spinning yarn and weaving cloth using a mixture of new wool and shoddy, wool reclaimed from rags. Strength to the cloth was often provided by the use of cotton yarn as a warp to make &#145;union cloths&#146;. The firm used shoddy from an early date and the subsequent success of the business was built on the competitive advantages this fibre allowed. The rise of the ready-made clothes trade, notably in Leeds, provided business. In 1879 Theodore Taylor took over his father's role in the business, acting partly as designer and partly as salesman, as well as buyer and as blender, the most important function for a firm of its nature. He was joined in the business by his younger brother, Arthur, in 1871, a cousin, John Taylor, in 1872, and another cousin, Thomas Frederick, in 1883. On 26 January 1892 he agreed with the other partners that he should take complete control of the business, which at that time employed 600 people. The firm made an increasing variety of union cloths, at a time when that was the most successful, and profitable, section of the British wool textile industry. By 1900 the workforce had increased to 1000 in three large mills. Control allowed Taylor to start putting into practice an idea which he had long considered and of which he was a great advocate&#151;profit-sharing in industry. He set up a successful scheme whereby workers received payment in shares as a &#145;bonus&#146;, according to their proportion of the pay bill. By 1918, when 1800 were employed, the issue of bonus shares amounted to half the company's capital. By 1952 the proportion was over four-fifths. Taylor maintained control of the business, however, by keeping voting rights firmly in his own hands. It has been estimated that the profit-sharing scheme transferred a total of &pound;3 million to Taylor's employees in shares and bonuses.<br>
<br>Taylor's wife and first daughter died within two days of one another in the influenza epidemic of 1919. The following year, on 16 March, he married Mary Isabella (<i>b</i>. 1873/4), daughter of Colin Alexander McVean, a highland laird of Kilfinichen in the Isle of Mull, Scotland, and Mary Wood, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cowan. With her he moved from his home in Batley to Grassington in the Yorkshire dales. He remained a devout Congregationalist, supporting financially the local Congregational Union and Silcoates School. He was a teetotaller and disapproved of smoking and gambling. He was described as a man of resolute will and deep conviction who &#145;liked neither fools nor knaves&#146;, and was reluctant to compromise. He had a reputation of being somewhat humourless, but to celebrate his hundredth birthday he took his employees to Blackpool, where he was pictured doing the palais glide with mill girls.<br>
<br>In 1889 Taylor started his political career when he was elected, for three years, to the new West Riding county council. In 1900 he was invited by Herbert Gladstone, son of the Liberal leader, to stand for parliament. He successfully fought the constituency of Radcliffe-cum-Farnworth, which he represented for eighteen years. He supported old-age pensions in his maiden speech at the budget debate of April 1901, and worked behind the scenes in the Liberal government supporting the principle of pensions. In spite of the difficulties of his industry, he was a strong advocate of free trade. His major political contribution, however, was in the anti-opium crusade. He opposed the majority report of the opium commission set up in 1893 and successfully moved a private member's ballot opposing the trade. He visited China in 1907 to see its effects at first hand, and continued his campaign to 1917, when the government finally released China from its treaty obligations to admit Indian opium.<br>
<br>Taylor was an inveterate traveller, for pleasure and for business, visiting many of the markets to which his cloth was sent. He toured Europe at the age of seventeen. In his late nineties he made an extensive tour of North America to sell cloth, the last of his twenty-four crossings of the Atlantic. He died at the age of 102, on 19 October 1952, from the after-effects of a heavy cold, at his home, The Moraine, Grassington; he was buried at Batley.<br>
