<span class="headword">Onslow,  (Andr&eacute;) George Louis</span>  (1784&#150;1853), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born on 27 July 1784 at Clermont-Ferrand, Auvergne, France, the son of Edward Onslow (1758&#150;1829), youngest son of the first earl of Onslow, and his wife, Marie Rosalie de Bourdeilles de Brant&ocirc;me (<i>d</i>. 1842), a renowned beauty from a local aristocratic family. There is much conflicting detail concerning Onslow's youth, but the most accurate accounts suggest that he was sent to London while a young boy to be educated under the watchful eye of his paternal grandfather, and there he received piano lessons from N.-J. H&uuml;llmandel and Jan Ladislav Dussek. He was then sent to Germany for two years (1799&#150;1800), where he took piano lessons from H&uuml;llmandel, Dussek, and J. B. Cramer as part of the education which befitted an aristocrat, although he apparently remained unmoved by the great music of his day. On returning to the Auvergne, taking with him the piano he had used in London, which was the first known in that area of France, he became friendly with a group of local musicians. This, according to some sources, prompted him to learn the cello, and thus it was that he became familiar with the chamber works of Haydn, Mozart, and Boccherini.<br>
<br>It was when Onslow was in Paris in 1801 that, according to an autobiographical note, the overture to M&eacute;hul's opera <span class="italic">Stratonice</span> awakened his sensibilities to the profound effect music could have on the emotions. The idea of composition came some while later and led to the writing of his first three string quintets (op. 1) and three quartets (op. 4) in 1807, and their publication in Paris at his own expense, before he had received so much as one formal lesson in composition. F.-J. F&eacute;tis, damning with faint praise, writes that Onslow had no real idea of the labour of composing, but that, as a man of independent means, he had all the leisure necessary to overcome these obstacles. Onslow recognized his shortcomings and sought lessons with Antoine Reicha, who had recently settled in Paris. Some sources say that it was about now that he learned to play the cello in order to become better acquainted with the chamber music of Beethoven, Haydn, and Mozart. In the same year (1808), on 23 June, he married Charlotte Fran&ccedil;oise Delphine de Fontanges, the daughter of a rich Aurillac landowner. They had two daughters and a son.<br>
<br>From this time on Onslow produced a steady series of works for publication. His attempts at opera, the most highly favoured genre at the time, were limited. <span class="italic">L'Alcalde de la vega</span> and <span class="italic">Le colporteur</span> were both produced at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Feydeau, in 1824 and 1827 respectively, and both achieved a <i>succ&egrave;s d'estime</i>. His third and final effort, which appeared ten years later, was <span class="italic">Guise</span>. <span class="italic">Le colporteur</span> also found modest success in Germany under the titles <span class="italic">Der Hausirer</span> and <span class="italic">Der Spion</span>, and was given in an adaptation by Barham Livius as <span class="italic">The Emissary, or, The Revolt of Moscow</span> at Drury Lane, London, on 13 May 1831.<br>
<br>In 1829 Onslow was injured when out boar-hunting while taking a rest to jot down a musical idea. His ear was damaged by a spent ball, leaving him unable to play the cello, and his hearing was impaired for the rest of his life. One of his most famous quintets, the fifteenth, was written as a result of this misfortune, being developed out of the theme he was sketching at the time of the accident: he charted his pain in the minuet (&#145;Dolore&#146;), convalescence in the andante (&#145;Convalescenza&#146;), and recovery in the finale (&#145;Guarigione&#146;). Having maintained his English connections, he was elected the second honorary member of the newly founded Philharmonic Society of London in 1830, Mendelssohn having been the first. His first symphony was performed at the Paris conservatory on 10 April 1831.<br>
<br>In 1842 the death of his father-in-law, the marquis de Fontanges, left Onslow in possession of a large fortune. In the same year, coincidentally or not, he entered the Institut de France, replacing Cherubini in the chair of the Acad&eacute;mie des Beaux-Arts, having gained more votes than, among others, Adam, Auber, and Berlioz. When he visited Paris for the last time in summer 1853 his health had deteriorated. He died suddenly at Clermont-Ferrand on 3 October 1853, after a morning walk.<br>
<br>For about forty years Onslow had produced a succession of works, the international publication of which was awaited eagerly by his appreciative following. By the 1830s Breitkopf and H&auml;rtel were producing collected editions of scores and parts, which, in the case of chamber music, were adaptable to various combinations of instruments and eventually numbered some thirty-four string quintets, thirty-five string quartets, and twenty-six works for other combinations. Onslow was highly regarded as an amateur composer, although some contemporary commentators saw his chamber music as worthy to stand alongside that of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, which accounted for his popularity in England and Germany. Many top French performers of the day also devoted much of their time and talent to playing Onslow's music, among them Pierre Baillot, Chr&eacute;tien Urhan, Th&eacute;ophile Tilmant, and Auguste Franchomme. But by 1880 his music was largely forgotten. He is credited, however, as being a &#145;modest, but legitimate&#146; precursor, influencing several highly regarded French composers of the day, including Saint-Sa&euml;ns, Massenet, Lalo, and Franck, although his music is not French in style. The quartets and quintets, irrespective of any influence they may or may not have had, are of exceptional quality. From the standpoint of the late twentieth century his musical language shows parallels with that of Beethoven, Schubert, and Mendelssohn, along with a semblance to the style of the later Brahms.<br>
