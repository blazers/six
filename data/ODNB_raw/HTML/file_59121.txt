<span class="headword">Grey, Sir  Roger  de</span>  (1918&#150;1995), <span class="occ">artist</span>, was born on 18 April 1918 at Colehatch, Tylers Green, Chipping Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, the second son and youngest of three children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61097/', "Nigel Arthur de Grey (1886&#150;1951)")</script>, naval intelligence officer, and his wife, Florence Emily Frances Gore (1883&#150;1963). Both his parents were of aristocratic descent. His father was deputy director of GCHQ at Bletchley Park during the Second World War. Inspired by tales of his uncle the painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56866/', "Spencer Gore")</script>, Roger in his teens affected flamboyant &#145;aestheticism&#146;. He was bullied at Eton, although he found a mentor in the assistant drawing master Robin (later Sir Robert) Darwin.<br>
<br>De Grey studied at the Chelsea School of Art (1936&#150;9 and 1945&#150;7). During the war he served in the Royal West Kent yeomanry until 1942 and then saw action as a captain in the Royal Armoured Corps. On 2 May 1942 he married the painter Flavia Hatt Irwin (<i>b</i>. 1916), daughter of Clinton Irwin, a retired army officer. They had two sons and a daughter by late 1952. In 1947 de Grey moved to Newcastle upon Tyne to become lecturer in painting at the King Edward VII School of Art at King's College, then part of Durham University (and headed by Darwin). Lawrence Gowing and Victor Pasmore were influential colleagues. Promoted to master of painting in 1951, de Grey followed Darwin to London two years later as senior tutor at the Royal College of Art (RCA).<br>
<br>Agnews Gallery mounted de Grey's first one-man exhibition in 1954. He specialized in contemplative evocations of nature: tightly composed still lifes and landscapes in soft muted colours which revealed a particular appreciation of C&eacute;zanne. Dappled sunlight and blue-green vegetation are characteristic of his work, which belongs to a recognizably British strand of post-impressionism. This was remote from the trend-setting pop art pioneered around 1960 by such RCA students as Peter Blake and David Hockney, but de Grey endeavoured to provide encouragement and defend new art against undiscriminating criticism. In 1973 he left the RCA to become principal of the City and Guilds of London Art School in Kennington, recently separated from the City and Guilds Institute. Retaining the job for the rest of his life, he did much to form the character of the school by having all students taught life drawing, promoting traditional crafts, and starting courses in restoration and conservation.<br>
<br>De Grey was elected an associate of the Royal Academy of Arts in 1962 and a full academician in 1969. His close involvement began when he joined the academy's exhibitions committee (1975) before serving as treasurer from 1976 to 1984. The financial position was at first precarious, but he introduced corporate sponsorship of major exhibitions and saved the loss-making summer exhibition by levying a 15 per cent commission on sales. On 6 December 1984 he became the twenty-first president of the Royal Academy, eager to carry on the modernizing work of Sir Hugh Casson and to return the academy to the mainstream of contemporary art. By abolishing the apprentice status of associate, which some painters and architects reckoned demeaning, he attracted a number of prestigious new academicians&#151;such as Blake, Hockney, R. B. Kitaj, Norman Foster, and Richard Rogers&#151;who may have been wary of the society's past reputation for anti-modernism. De Grey did not deem it the president's task to pontificate about art. He appeared a gentle, approachable man. Quizzical friendliness cloaked any nervousness; his conversation was light and informal. Slender and spry, fond of hamburgers and chewing gum, he usually dressed in pale tweed tones enlivened by brightly coloured woollen tie and socks.<br>
<br>By strengthening the international contacts of the Royal Academy, de Grey enabled it to stage loan exhibitions more ambitious than ever before. There were monographic shows devoted to Monet, Goya, Mantegna, Frans Hals, Poussin, Chagall, Sickert, and Henry Moore, and such synoptic shows as &#145;The Age of Chivalry&#146; (1987) and &#145;The Art of Photography&#146; (1989). The president concerned himself with every detail of presentation and publicity, and hotly insisted on the highest standards. He was also a very successful fund-raiser, hosting breakfasts, luncheons, and dinners in London and the USA. A donation by the American philanthropist Arthur M. Sackler made it possible for the academy to replace the old Diploma Galleries at Burlington House with the Sackler Galleries, which opened in June 1991, the month when de Grey received a knighthood (KCVO). He retired as president in April 1993 at the compulsory age of seventy-five.<br>
<br>Much as he enjoyed being at the centre of things, de Grey had continued to produce about a dozen large works a year. His studio was a converted barn across a field from his country home at 5&#150;6 Camer Street, Meopham, Kent. He made many studies on the theme &#145;interior/exterior&#146;, showing the view from within to without, with the blurring and reflections of window glass. Probably his most distinctive landscapes were painted late in life in south-west France, where he owned a house from 1977.<br>
<br>De Grey died on 14 February 1995 at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London after minor surgery to cure an intestinal infection. His wife survived him. A dedicated painter, administrator, and teacher, he had thrived on juggling all three activities.<br>
