<span class="headword">Shadrach,  Azariah</span>  (1774&#150;1844), <span class="occ">Independent minister and writer</span>, was born on 24 June 1774 at Garndeifo-fach in the parish of Llanfair Nant-y-gof, near Fishguard, Pembrokeshire, the fifth son of Henry and Ann Shadrach, natives of the neighbouring parish of Nevern. When he was seven, the family moved to Burton, Pembrokeshire, but three years later, Shadrach moved to live with an aunt at Moylgrove. Influenced by the Revd John Phillips, he joined the Independents. He had little formal education but he was later employed as a farm servant by the Revd John Richards, a local Independent minister, and was granted access to his employer's books after his day's work. He decided to enter the Independent ministry and began preaching at his master's church, Rhos-y-Caerau. As a probationary minister, he toured both south and north Wales between 1796 and 1798. While in north Wales, he was persuaded by George Lewis of Llanuwchllyn to undertake the duties of schoolmaster at Hirnant, near Llanfyllin, and then at Pennal and Derwen-las, near Machynlleth. In 1802 he went to Trefriw, near Llanrwst, and by the end of the year had been ordained pastor of the Independent church at Llanrwst, at a salary of &pound;5 a year. Here he was largely instrumental in suppressing the wakes or <i>mabsantau</i>, which still flourished in the district. While at Llanrwst, he married Margaret Morris (<i>c</i>.1776&#150;1813), on 16 April 1805, with whom he had four children.<br>
<br>In November 1806 Shadrach moved to Cardiganshire, where he had charge of the churches of Tal-y-bont and Llanbadarn Fawr. He began to preach regularly at Aberystwyth in 1816 and, on 30 May 1819, he established an Independent church in the town. Shadrach gave up his ministerial work at Tal-y-bont and Llanbadarn Fawr and concentrated his efforts on the new church at Aberystwyth. He worked tirelessly to collect funds for the erection of Zion Chapel at Penmaes-glas, Aberystwyth in 1821, travelling widely across England and Wales. The chapel remained the meeting-place of the Independents until 1878 when the cause moved to Baker Street.<br>
<br>Shadrach was the author of no fewer than twenty-seven works, all, with one exception, written in Welsh. Some of them ran into several editions, and it is estimated that 60,000 copies of his various books were sold altogether. They were mostly sketches of sermons he had previously delivered. Owing to his liberal use of allegory he was styled, the &#145;Bunyan of Wales&#146;. Perhaps his best work was <span class="italic">A Looking Glass: neu ddrych y gwrthgiliwr</span> (1807), which was translated into English by Edward S. Byam, under the title <span class="italic">The backslider's mirror: a popular Welsh treatise, translated from the ancient British language</span> (1845).<br>
<br>From 1830 Shadrach's son Eliakim was joint pastor with him at Zion, but he left for Dursley, in Gloucestershire in 1834. In August 1835, Shadrach himself resigned his charge, but he continued to preach for some years. He died on 12 January 1844 at Aberystwyth, and was buried there on 18 January in St Michael's churchyard.<br>
