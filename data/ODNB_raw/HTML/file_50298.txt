<span class="headword">MacLaren,  Archibald</span>  (1819?&#150;1884), <span class="occ">teacher of physical education and author</span>, was born at Alloa, Clackmannanshire, Scotland. The details of his early life are obscure. He was brought up a Presbyterian. At about the age of sixteen he went to Paris and studied fencing, gymnastics, and medicine but became most interested in physical training. He settled in Oxford as a fencing master some time after 1840, and on 2 July 1844 he married Charlotte Wheeler (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1847), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26947/', "David Alphonso Talboys")</script>, the bookseller. He came to know both William Morris and Edward Burne Jones, who as undergraduates visited MacLaren's home in Summertown and shared his wider cultural interests. Burne Jones drew a set of illustrations for MacLaren's <span class="italic">The fairy family: a series of ballads and metrical tales illustrating the fairy mythology of Europe</span>, published in 1857, albeit without those illustrations. In 1858 he erected the &#145;university gymnasium&#146; at the corner of Bear Lane.<br>
<br>In 1860 MacLaren was asked to develop a new system of physical training for the army and in 1861 twelve NCOs were selected to attend a six-month course under him at Oxford. An army training school was established at Aldershot and a gymnasium modelled on that at Oxford was completed there before the end of 1861. To enable MacLaren's methods to be more widely practised Her Majesty's Stationery Office produced <span class="italic">A Military System of Gymnastic Exercises for the Use of Instructors</span> in 1862. A general order had been issued in February 1862 that MacLaren's system, &#145;having been approved by the General Commanding in Chief&#146;, was to be adopted in all suitable military gymnasia. Dumb-bells, bar-bells, climbing ropes, horizontal bars, vaulting horses, and climbing walls, as well as running and free-standing exercises were brought into general use.<br>
<br>MacLaren was a far-sighted teacher. In an article entitled &#145;National systems of bodily exercise&#146; he compared ancient and modern systems of gymnastics. None of them satisfied him. He was particularly critical of the Swedish system which was being introduced to Britain at this time. He thought that it was suitable for invalids only. &#145;Chicken broth may yield ample nutriment to the invalid&#146; he wrote, &#145;but the soldier would make but a poor day's march upon it; you must give <i>him</i> the chicken too&#146;  (<span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span>, 7, 1863, 280). He analysed also the Prussian and French systems of bodily exercise and condemned them in nationalistic terms, although MacLaren's own view of the fundamental aim of gymnastics was not very different from those which he criticized. He believed that by exercises suitably devised and arranged the body could be prepared for any task. In <span class="italic">Training in Theory and Practice</span> (1866) he applied his principles in detail to a single sport, rowing. This he judged to be &#145;an art of considerable intricacy &hellip; involving the possession &hellip; of both muscular and respiratory power, to promote which is the object of all training&#146;  (p. 2).<br>
<br>MacLaren's best-known work was <span class="italic">A System of Physical Education, Theoretical and Practical</span> (1869). In it he wrote &#145;all exercise may be classed under two distinct heads, Recreative and Educational&#146;. This dichotomy within physical education was fundamental to its development in Britain and reappeared in many subsequent government documents and other treatises on education. In ten appendices to the book MacLaren showed how anthropometry should be used in physical education. He had himself carefully taken measurements of his military trainees before, during, and at the end of their course. A second edition of the book was published in 1885.<br>
<br>In 1851 MacLaren married a second time, to Gertrude Isabel Frances Talboys (1833&#150;1896), sister of his deceased first wife. A good classical scholar, in 1864 she founded Summer Fields in Summertown, north Oxford, which became a well-known preparatory school. They had a family of three daughters and two sons, the second of whom, Wallace, produced a revised edition of <span class="italic">A System of Physical Education</span> in 1895. After suffering from diabetes for many years MacLaren died at Summer Fields, on 19 February 1884. He was buried in Summertown churchyard three days later.<br>
