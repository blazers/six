<span class="headword">Maitland,  Samuel Roffey</span>  (1792&#150;1866), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious controversialist</span>, was born on 7 January 1792 at King's Road, Bedford Row, London, the son of Alexander Maitland, a merchant, and his wife, Caroline Busby, who was descended from the seventeenth-century headmaster of Westminster School, Dr Richard Busby. She provided her husband, Alexander, a nonconformist of Scottish descent, with a Gloucestershire estate.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>Maitland was brought up early as a nonconformist, and received his early education in a number of private institutions, where he studied Latin and Greek, and also acquired some rudimentary knowledge of French and chemistry. He later remarked on his deficiency in the field of history when he left school in 1807; fortunately, he was subsequently tutored by the Revd Launcelot Sharpe, a master at the Merchant Taylors' School, whose zest for learning seems to have rubbed off on his pupil: Maitland developed a voracious appetite for reading. He was admitted to St John's College, Cambridge, on 7 October 1809, and at about the same time to the Inner Temple. He seems to have done little to distinguish himself at St John's, and switched over the following year to Trinity College, where he could be in closer proximity to his friend W. H. Mill, who instilled in him an interest in Arabic and Hebrew literature.<br>
<br>In 1811 Maitland left Cambridge altogether, finding that he could not, in good conscience, sign the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>, a requisite for obtaining a degree. He later explained that his problem lay not with the articles themselves, but in his own continuing fellowship within the dissenting tradition, which hardly qualified him as a fully committed Anglican. Shortly after, he accepted the task of cataloguing the library holdings of the late Dr Maxwell Garthshorne, on the understanding that he would retain any duplicate volumes for himself. Around 1815 he found his hopes for being called to the bar stymied by his university deficiencies. This situation he endeavoured to rectify by returning to St John's on 10 October 1815, for an additional three terms. During the Easter term of 1816, his application to study paid dividends in a call to the bar. And then, on 19 November of this very busy year, he was married to Selina Stephenson, whose father, Christopher, was vicar at Olney; they had only one child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17829/', "John Gorham Maitland")</script>.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Maitland's commitment to law was evidently not strong enough to keep him fully occupied; in fact, his penchant for studying and writing on various subjects seems eventually to have absorbed him almost completely. His first publication, <span class="italic">A Dissertation on the Primary Objects of Idolatrous Worship</span>, which came out in 1817, was brief and obscure. The publisher was Josiah Conder, and although no one in their right mind could have expected it to become a best-seller, it did serve to introduce Maitland's rather eccentric interests and style to those members of the learned circles who took the trouble to examine his work. By the time his next publication came out, almost a decade later, Maitland's world had been altered considerably.<h2>
<a name="Ordinationandearlycontroversies"></a>Ordination and early controversies</h2>In addition to a move from London to Taunton, Maitland's spiritual perspectives seem to have undergone a gradual change; accordingly, on 27 June 1821 at Norwich, Maitland was ordained deacon by Bishop Bathurst, becoming curate of St Edmund's there. His stay in Norwich was brief, however, and before long Bishop Ryder of Gloucester ordained him as a priest. Apparently Maitland's father had just moved to Gloucester himself, and so father and son became next-door neighbours.<br>
<br>The next stage in Maitland's career was an appointment on 22 May 1823 as perpetual curate of Christ Church, Gloucester. The church was relatively new, but it could not hold Maitland's attention for long either. After less than five years in his parish he decided to embark on an extended continental trip. His primary motivation appears to have been his keen interest in the status of the Jews, and his desire to observe their culture for himself in Poland and Germany.<br>
<br>After reaching France in April 1828, Maitland travelled on throughout Germany and Prussia as far as Warsaw. A collection of letters written during this time, together with numerous delightful sketches and illustrations, may still be seen at Lambeth Palace Library  (MSS 1943&#150;1945). His facility with languages served him well on his expedition, which lasted until the autumn of 1828. While abroad, Maitland published <span class="italic">A letter to the Rev. Charles Simeon &hellip; on the propriety of adopting some means beside those which are now used for promoting Christianity among the Jews</span> (1828). Here he advocated institutional support for Jews who had converted to Christianity and had thereby been cut off from the means of earning their living. Maitland's suggestions appear to have been well received in Britain, and measures were taken to make his vision a reality; no doubt his decision personally to bear the costs associated with the project for the space of two years was a welcome incentive to many concerned supporters.<br>
<br>Since interest in the fate of the Jews and biblical prophecy had long been linked in the history of the Christian church, it is unsurprising that Maitland had now become deeply engrossed in eschatological issues. As early as 1826 he had published his second work, <span class="italic">An enquiry into the grounds on which the prophetic period of Daniel and St. John, has been supposed to consist of 1260 years</span>. This piece turned out to be a significant contribution to the discussion regarding the interpretation of Daniel's Seventy Weeks, and especially, the so-called &#145;Year-day Theory&#146;, which had attracted many adherents. Maitland aimed to demonstrate the folly of equating the crucial 1260 days in prophecy with calendar years, so that speculation abounded in many prophetic circles as to when the period in question would end and usher in the consummation. In an era of almost unparalleled fascination with apocalyptic questions of this sort, Maitland's work won much attention. Further interest was fuelled by the appearance of the Catholic Apostolic church and the Plymouth Brethren, movements which foreshadowed the increasing popularity of the &#145;futurist&#146; method of prophetic interpretation, as opposed to what would be termed the &#145;historicist&#146; at that time. Clearly, Maitland's stance lent further credibility to the futurist hermeneutic, which would eventually become very popular, especially among evangelicals, though he was careful not to align himself with any particular faction.<br>
<br>Maitland threw himself wholeheartedly into a number of controversies during his lifetime, and any party or individual so unfortunate as to incur his wrath rarely forgot it. His next target was Joseph Milner, who, with assistance from his brother Isaac, had written <span class="italic">The History of the Church of Christ</span> (1794&#150;1809), which cast an approving eye upon such controversial sects as the Waldensians and Albigensians. Irked by the favourable review given to these movements, Maitland published the lengthy <span class="italic">Facts and documents illustrative of the history, doctrine, and rites, of the ancient Albigenses &amp; Waldenses</span> (1832). His views were also aired in his regular contributions to the <span class="italic">British Magazine</span>, then edited by its founder, Hugh James Rose. In Rose, Maitland appeared to have found a soul-mate, as both men flitted for a time on the outskirts of the Oxford Movement, without ever actually throwing in their lot with, or being completely trusted by, its leaders. A number of Maitland's articles were reprinted in 1844 under the title <span class="italic">The Dark Ages</span>, while a second collection, <span class="italic">Essays on Subjects Connected with the Reformation in England</span>, was forthcoming in 1849.<h2>
<a name="LibrarianatLambeth"></a>Librarian at Lambeth</h2>Rose's untimely death in 1838 led to Maitland's assuming control of the <span class="italic">British Magazine</span>. Previously, he had served briefly (in fact, for one issue only) as editor of the <span class="italic">British Critic</span> under the watchful eye of John Henry Newman and his associates. In 1839 Maitland was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, but a greater honour had been bestowed upon him during the previous year. Acting upon the recommendation of Rose, Archbishop Howley had requested his services as Lambeth librarian and manuscript keeper. At the time when the invitation was issued, Maitland was still residing in Gloucester. It is obvious that he accepted the post for reasons other than financial ones: it carried with it an annual salary of only &pound;40, yet Maitland left Gloucester and rented a house in London for &pound;200 per annum. In addition, he brought his books with him, and even hired a clerk to assist him, at his own expense. Later, Maitland's friend William J. Thoms went to great lengths in <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span> to establish that &#145;Dr. Maitland was <i>not</i> stall-fed&#146;  (Thoms, 50). Moreover, he never enjoyed &#145;one bit of Church preferment&#146;  (ibid.), although he was the recipient of a DD degree from the hands of Howley on 1 February 1848.<h2>
<a name="TheActsandMonumentscontroversy"></a>The Acts and Monuments controversy</h2>Maitland is undoubtedly best remembered as the fiercest critic of a new edition of Foxe's <span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>, published in stages, beginning with the second, third, and fourth volumes in 1837. There had not been a complete edition of the <span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span> since the late seventeenth century, although numerous edited forms of Foxe, often under the title of the <span class="italic">Book of Martyrs</span>, had been published. Maitland's attack appears to have been two-pronged: while condemning Foxe for producing an extremely unreliable and slanted work devised to advance the fortunes of the &#145;puritan&#146; faction, and particularly the Marian exiles whom Maitland so abhorred, he also criticized the Seeley and Burnside project itself, which had been announced in rather extravagant terms by the publisher and a group of prominent clergymen. In the pages of the <span class="italic">British Magazine</span> Maitland took exception to the editorial &#145;labours&#146; (for which read &#145;blunders&#146;) of Stephen Reed Cattley, and the introductory material contributed by Canon George Townsend. When Townsend attempted to justify his role in the project, more grist was added to the mill: Maitland dealt with many of the issues involved in the dispute in his <span class="italic">Notes on the contributions of the Rev. George Townsend &hellip; to the new edition of Fox's martyrology</span> (3 parts, 1841&#150;2).<br>
<br>Undoubtedly, Maitland's harsh criticisms embarrassed those involved with the Foxe project, although they did not deter additional editions of Foxe (there were three more issued by 1877). Eventually, Maitland seemed to have tired of the issue and moved on to other publications, which reflect both his eclecticism and his eccentricities, including his <span class="italic">Illustrations and Enquiries Relating to Mesmerism: Part 1</span> (1849) and his <span class="italic">Superstition and Science: an Essay</span> (1855). Another unusual book written much earlier, <span class="italic">Eruvin, or, Miscellaneous essays on subjects connected with the nature, history, and destiny of man</span> (1831), contained essays ranging from such subjects as &#145;The consequences of the fall&#146; (Essay V) to &#145;The millennium&#146; (Essay VII).<h2>
<a name="Laterlifeanddeath"></a>Later life and death</h2>Maitland's fortunes suffered a considerable reversal about 1848, when the new archbishop of Canterbury, John Bird Sumner, appointed his son-in-law, the Revd John Thomas, in Maitland's place as librarian; in addition in the year following, the <span class="italic">British Magazine</span> ceased publication.<br>
<br>Maitland's expulsion from Lambeth was largely undeserved: despite his acrid pen, it appears that he had gone well out of his way to help those engaged in research while at Lambeth. And, despite inferences to the contrary, he never entered fully into the spirit of the Oxford Movement, but like Rose, represented the old high church rather than the newer, more controversial phenomenon. S. C. Orchard pointed to his progressive disenchantment with evangelicalism fairly early in his career. Perhaps Newman's increasing distance from the old high-church position, which became a source of concern for Hugh James Rose  (Nockles, 117), was of equal alarm to Maitland.<br>
<br>Following his experience at Lambeth, this one-time &#145;Evangelical of the Evangelicals&#146;  (Orchard, 165) returned to Gloucester, and though living in retirement, continued to publish on a variety of subjects. He also supported W. J. Thoms at the launching of <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span>. At some point in his life Maitland began to write an autobiography, but he did not succeed in getting his manuscript past 1817. While Cambridge University Library possesses numerous printed works including a copy of <span class="roman">Strype</span> with notations by Maitland, together with two manuscript essays, the autobiography does not appear to be among the resources held there.<br>
<br>Though obviously a man of letters, Maitland evidently acquired some degree of expertise in a wide range of pursuits, such as music (he played several instruments), draughtsmanship, printing, and bookbinding. Having survived both his wife, Selina, and his son, he died on 19 January 1866 at his home, Spa Road, South Hamlet, Gloucester.<br>
