<span class="headword">Harmer, Sir  Sidney Frederic</span>  (1862&#150;1950), <span class="occ">zoologist</span>, was born in Heigham, Norwich, Norfolk, on 9 March 1862, the second son among the five children of Frederic William Harmer, wool merchant and manufacturer, and his wife, Mary Young Lyon. He was educated at Amersham Hall, Reading, and at seventeen won a mathematical scholarship to University College, London, where he studied natural sciences. He subsequently went to King's College, Cambridge, where he had a distinguished career as exhibitioner, scholar, and fellow. He obtained first classes in both parts (1882 and 1883) of the natural sciences tripos.<br>
<br>In 1885 Harmer became university lecturer in advanced invertebrate morphology, and five years later became superintendent of the University Museum of Zoology. As a teacher he was highly respected for his industry, patience, and accuracy in observation, his clarity and precision in recording, and his ability to impart knowledge. Throughout his life he inspired affection by his gentleness, courtesy, and kindness.<br>
<br>In 1891 Harmer married Laura Russell, daughter of Arthur Pearce Howell of the Bengal civil service. They had two sons and two daughters (a son and a daughter predeceased him).<br>
<br>Harmer was appointed keeper of zoology at the British Museum (Natural History) in 1907 and from 1919 to 1927 was its director. His industry was prodigious and he left to the museum a volume of files, indexes, and notebooks filled with accurate and methodically arranged taxonomic work, together with his exceptionally fine library of works on Polyzoa and whales.<br>
<br>At Cambridge Harmer's research centred on the embryology, anatomy, and taxonomy of Polyzoa and <i>Cephalodiscus</i>, for which he was the first of the Cambridge zoologists to use the binocular microscope. He also developed an interest in whales, and worked at the Stazione Zoologica in Naples and the Plymouth laboratory of the Marine Biological Association, with which he was long connected. His first three volumes on <span class="italic">The Polyzoa of the Siboga-Expedition</span> were published in 1915, 1926, and 1934, and the material for the fourth was prepared by 1941. Harmer published numerous influential papers on the Cetacea and enhanced the collections. His equanimity led to good relationships with the trustees of the British Museum (Natural History), and he steered the museum smoothly through a difficult time with tact and judgement.<br>
<br>Harmer had a long connection with the Museums Association, of which he was president in 1904, becoming an honorary member in 1922. For thirty-one years he was a fellow of the Linnean Society, serving on the council in 1921&#150;4 and 1927&#150;32, and being vice-president in 1931&#150;2 and president in 1927&#150;31. In 1934 he received the Linnaean medal. Harmer was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1898, served on the council, and was a vice-president. Other honours included being made a foreign member of the Norwegian and Swedish academies and an honorary member of the Boston Society of Natural History and the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Zoologique de France. He was appointed KBE in 1920.<br>
<br>Harmer travelled extensively, was fond of music, and was a competent pianist. He was a keen cyclist on the high bicycle until quite late in life, and was always an enthusiastic and knowledgeable gardener. Harmer died at his home, 5 Grange Road, Melbourn, Cambridgeshire, on 22 October 1950.<br>
