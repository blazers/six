<span class="headword">Knox,  Alexander Andrew</span>  (1818&#150;1891), <span class="occ">journalist and police magistrate</span>, the second son of George Knox, a landowner in Jamaica, was born in London on 5 February 1818. He was educated at Blundell's School, Tiverton, and went with a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge (BA 1844, MA 1847). He was called to the bar as member of Lincoln's Inn in 1844.<br>
<br>Knox began his journalistic career at the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, but in 1846 he became a writer of leading articles on the staff of <span class="italic">The Times</span>. He continued to write for that paper until 1860, when he accepted Sir George Cornewall Lewis's offer of the office of police magistrate at Worship Street. In 1862 he was transferred to the Marlborough Street court, and remained there until 1878, when a stroke forced him to retire. On three occasions he received the special thanks of the Home Office for his magisterial services.<br>
<br>A noted conversationalist, Knox spent much of his life in the company of intellectuals. In 1842 he travelled in Italy with Shelley, his wife, Mary, and Robert Leslie Ellis, where they met Edward John Trelawny, a friend of Byron and Shelley. Knox was a frequent guest of Dr John Ayrton Paris, at whose house in London he met leading men of science, including Michael Faraday, Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie, and Charles Babbage. Among his other friends were Sir James Brooke, Admiral Sherard Osborn, Alexander William Kinglake, Sir Spencer St John, Thomas Mozley, and Marianne North. Knox published <span class="italic">The New Playground, or, Wanderings in Algeria</span> (1881). Besides his work on <span class="italic">The Times</span> he contributed articles to the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span>, and many other periodicals.<br>
<br>In 1857 Knox married Susan Toten, daughter of James Armstrong, of the Bengal civil service. He died at his home, 125 Victoria Street, London, on 5 October 1891; he was survived by his wife.<br>
