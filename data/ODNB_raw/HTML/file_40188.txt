<span class="headword">Cruger,  Henry</span>  (1739&#150;1827), <span class="occ">merchant and politician</span>, was born in New York city on 22 November 1739, one of four sons of Henry Cruger (<i>d</i>. 1780), merchant and member of the New York assembly and council, and his wife, Elizabeth Harris. The Cruger family belonged to an Atlantic community of traders, centred in Bristol, England, with commercial links in North America and the West Indies. The first of the family to settle in North America was Cruger's grandfather John Cruger, who reached New York in 1698 and, in what was to become the family pattern, combined a successful merchant career with involvement in local politics. His son John (1710&#150;1791), as mayor of New York between 1756 and 1765, is known for having twice averted conflict in the city over imperial issues, and was a delegate to the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span> congress of 1765. Henry Cruger's eldest brother, John Harris Cruger, followed in his father's footsteps, becoming a member of the governor's council in 1773. Two other brothers, Nicholas and Telemon, were in the West India trade; Nicholas had a counting-house in St Croix. Henry Cruger himself was educated at King's College in New York, whence his father removed him in 1757 and sent him to receive commercial training in the counting-house of Henry Cruger &amp; Co. in Bristol.<br>
<br>Cruger married, in December 1765, Hannah (<i>d</i>. 1767), the daughter of Bristol merchant Samuel Peach. Through his father-in-law he gained connections with the local radical movement. He was a member of the Bristol common council from the year following his marriage until 1790 and he was a sheriff of the city in 1766&#150;7. In 1766 he went to London with a delegation of Bristol merchants to urge repeal of the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span>. After 1768 Peach and Cruger were among the leaders of an independent society that petitioned against the Middlesex election and endorsed the radical principle of the right of electors to instruct their members of parliament. Cruger's radical connections earned him a reputation as a &#145;hot Wilkite&#146;, in the words of the prime minister, Lord North  (Underdown, 16), and probably ensured that his candidature for parliament had been informally agreed upon by his political associates by 1772.<br>
<br>Cruger is best known as one of only three mainland American colonists to be elected a member of parliament during the late colonial period. The election of 1774, which was overshadowed by the growing crisis with America, was also one that saw both Cruger and Edmund Burke standing in opposition to the incumbent pro-ministerial members for Bristol. Burke had been viewed by Cruger's radical supporters in 1774 as an appropriate second because it was felt that he could attract moderate votes. Nevertheless Burke and Cruger were unlikely political associates, who had clear differences both of principle and temperament. Although some co-operation took place between their respective committees and among their supporters the two did not stand together. In the event Cruger was returned as head of the poll, with Burke in second place. Cruger's acceptance speech, in which he affirmed his support for the right of electors to instruct their members, prompted Burke's famous response setting forth his traditional views on the duty of MPs to rely on their own judgement.<br>
<br>Cruger took his seat in parliament in the wake of the <span class="roman">Coercive Acts</span> of 1774, which had triggered a renewal of political conflict between Britain and her North American colonies. Cruger's moderate attitude to the American crisis reflects his Anglo-American origins and Atlantic perspective. As a member of parliament he was determined to dispel his image as a radical, writing that &#145;the whole House shall be undeceived if a moderate and modest speech can affect it&#146;  (Van Schaack, <span class="italic">Henry Cruger</span>, 13). His motive was to win the ears of the ministers in order to influence them to take a more conciliatory approach to the burgeoning conflict with the colonies. In his first speech he struck a middle road, warning that coercion would only serve to alienate the affections of the colonists and suggesting that parliament should adopt a constitutional line that would secure colonial liberties while maintaining the supremacy of the British legislature. In subsequent debate he lost his temper defending the colonists from Colonel Grant's charge of cowardice; once hostilities began, however, he wrote that the colonists would be &#145;utterly undone&#146; if they did not make immediate concessions  (Dartmouth MS D (W) 1778.lii.1144). He was disappointed by the terms of Lord North's conciliatory proposal, and by June 1775 he confessed that he had despaired of influencing the ministry to adopt more moderate measures.<br>
<br>Five months later, through the intervention of Sir William Meredith, Lord North met Cruger to consult on the crisis. North was exploring the prospect of a commission to the colonies in order to forestall prolonged war. The Cruger family was influential in the strategically important colony of New York, and the British government had secretly been monitoring Henry Cruger's correspondence with his family since early 1775. The interview of November comprehended Cruger's father, who in 1775 had left New York to join his son in Bristol. Father and son urged that a delegation of pro-American politicians be sent to the colonies to resolve Anglo-American differences, but nothing came of their suggestion. As hostilities escalated Cruger continued to oppose both the war and American independence. He supported Lord Chatham's policies over those of the Rockinghams. In late 1777 he supported Wilkes's motion for repeal of the <span class="roman">Declaratory Act</span>, and the following year he issued handbills reprinting Lord Chatham's speech to the House of Lords of 20 January 1775. It was not until 1780 that he spoke openly in support of American independence as the only means of ending the war.<br>
<br>Cruger failed in his bid for re-election to parliament in 1780, in part because of his persisting rivalry with Edmund Burke. His supporters, however, secured his election as mayor of Bristol in the following year. He stood again as member for Bristol, as a supporter of William Pitt, in 1784, this time successfully. His campaign was assisted by his eldest brother, John Harris Cruger, who by now was living in England as a loyalist exile. Cruger himself was in America during the campaign, attempting to re-establish trade links there; he had experienced difficulties in gathering his American debts in the years before the war and the conflict itself had done irreparable damage to his merchant business. Unable to restore his fortunes, in 1789 he attempted, through Pitt, to obtain an appointment as British consul in the United States.<br>
<br>Cruger's subsequent career reflects the Atlantic character of his connections and outlook, and the ambiguous nature of his loyalties in an era of Anglo-American conflict. His bid for a consular appointment in America having failed, he declared in the following year that he did not intend to stand again as MP for Bristol. In 1790, while still formally a member of parliament, he departed for New York, taking with him his second wife, Elizabeth Blair, who died that same year. There, two years later, he was elected to the New York state senate, despite opposition protests that, as one who had resided in England and taken oaths as a British government official throughout the war, he was not an American citizen. On the American side of his family, however, he could claim an unimpeachable patriot association in the form of his brother Nicholas, who had fought with the American forces during the war and was a friend of George Washington.<br>
<br>Cruger resided in New York city for the remainder of his life. After serving in the senate, he retired from business and lived privately. With his second wife he had had a daughter; in 1799 he married his third wife, Caroline Smith, with whom he had four more children. Samuel Peach Cruger, his only child by his first wife, did not accompany his father to New York; he remained in Bristol and subsequently changed his name to that of his maternal grandfather, Samuel Peach. Henry Cruger died in New York city on 24 April 1827, and was survived by his third wife.<br>
