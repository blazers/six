<span class="headword">Godwin <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Clairmont; <em>n&eacute;e </em>de Vial]</span>,  Mary Jane</span>  (1768&#150;1841), <span class="occ">translator and bookseller</span>, was probably the daughter of Peter de Vial, a merchant of Exeter, who apparently died bankrupt in 1791, and his first wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Tremlett (1740&#150;1774). Her parents also had at least two other daughters and one son. Very little is known about her life until 1801, at which time, under the name Mary Jane Clairmont, she was a neighbour of the philosopher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10898/', "William Godwin (1756&#150;1836)")</script>, whom she married on 21 December of that year. At the time of her marriage to Godwin, Mary Jane Clairmont had two children, and called herself a widow, although it is unlikely that she had previously been married. The children believed their father to be Charles Gaulis (<i>d</i>. 1796), a native of Switzerland who had supposedly changed his name to Clairmont, but while he might have been the father of the elder (Charles), the father of the younger, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5428/', "Clara (Claire) Mary Jane Clairmont (1798&#150;1879)")</script>, has been identified as Sir John Lethbridge, first baronet  (Stafford). Mary Jane and William Godwin were to have one child of their own: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10897/', "William Godwin (1803&#150;1832)")</script>.<br>
<br>While best known to literary history as the stepmother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25311/', "Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley (1797&#150;1851)")</script>, and also of Godwin's adopted daughter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/103421/', "Fanny Godwin (1794&#150;1816)")</script>, Mary Jane Godwin was active in the literary society of her day, translating from French, in which she was fluent, and editing children's books. Her early employers included the publisher Benjamin Tabart, for whom she edited a three-volume <span class="italic">Collection of Popular Stories for the Nursery</span>, but in 1805 she and Godwin opened their own bookshop, which was formally established under the name M. J. Godwin &amp; Co. in 1807. It specialized in children's literature, much of it commissioned by the Godwins, and their publications included such major successes as Charles and Mary Lamb's <span class="italic">Tales from Shakespeare</span> and the first English translation of <span class="italic">The Swiss Family Robinson</span>. William Godwin contributed educational work under the pseudonym Edward Baldwin, but it was Mary Jane Godwin who was responsible for running the business. In addition to her work for the bookshop, she published in 1835 an anonymous guidebook to Herne Bay, near Canterbury, a book which Claire Clairmont thought &#145;remarkably pretty&#146;  (Stocking, 2.344). The Godwins' bookshop was a profitable venture, at least initially, but it never earned enough money to clear the debts which harassed them all their married life, and which led to occasional temporary separations. They eventually lost the bookshop to bankruptcy, and until Godwin received a government pension three years before his death in 1836 their income was precarious.<br>
<br>Money was not the only potential source of trouble in the Godwins' marriage; a number of William Godwin's literary friends disliked Mary Jane Godwin&#151;Charles Lamb was particularly unkind about her&#151;as did her stepdaughter. In 1817 Mary Shelley wrote that &#145;somthing [<i>sic</i>] very analogous to disgust arises whenever I mention her&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley</span>, 1.43); earlier, she had complained that &#145;Mrs. G. &hellip; plagues my father out of his life&#146;  (ibid., 1.3). Yet despite their many financial problems and Mary Jane's unpopularity, the Godwins' marriage and business partnership both seem to have remained solid. According to Claire Clairmont, her mother's &#145;affection and devotion to Godwin were admirable and remained unalterable from the day of their marriage till his death&#146;  (Stocking, 2.618). And Mary Shelley's last references to her stepmother are in fact much less harsh than were her earlier comments. &#145;Poor Mrs. Godwin!&#146; Shelley wrote shortly after Mary Jane's death. &#145;It seemed strange that so restless a spirit could be hushed, &amp; all that remained pent up in a grave. I had done all I could to help her during life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley</span>, 3.20).<br>
<br>Mary Jane Godwin died at her home, 3 Golden Square, London, on 17 June 1841, cared for in her last illness by Claire Clairmont. She was buried in St Pancras churchyard, next to William Godwin and his more famous first wife, Mary Wollstonecraft, but when the remains of Godwin and Wollstonecraft were later moved to the Shelley family vault in Bournemouth as a result of the encroachments of railway developers, Mary Jane Godwin's body was not reinterred.<br>
