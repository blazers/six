<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stark, Dame  Freya Madeline</span>  (1893?&#150;1993), <span class="occ">writer and traveller</span>, was thought to have been born in a studio on rue Denfert Rochereau, Paris, on 31 January 1893, the eldest daughter of Robert Stark (1853&#150;1931), an artist, and his wife, Flora Madeline (1861&#150;1942). Some evidence  (Geniesse, 369, n. 6) suggests she may in fact have been born as much as one year earlier. Her parents were first cousins. She had one sister, Vera Josephine (1895&#150;1926), though an elder child had been born and died in 1891. During her childhood she moved frequently when her father renovated houses in Devon and when they rented summer lodging at Asolo, Italy. From 1903, while her mother settled with the daughters at Dronero, Italy, her father remained in Devon; he emigrated to Canada as a settler in 1911. At Dronero her mother invested in and managed a silk factory owned by Mario di Roascio (<i>d</i>. 1947), who married Vera in 1913. When Freya's hair and eyelids were caught in the machinery in 1905 she was partly scalped, and her injuries required skin grafts and left her disfigured. In the 1930s she had plastic surgery to remove scars, but her childhood left a deeper impression. In later years she often sought the maternal solicitude she had experienced after her accident in periods of bedridden hypochondria, and she befriended many older men as surrogates for her absent father.<br>
<br>Stark was educated at home and, after a correspondence course, studied history at Bedford College, University of London (1911&#150;14). Family friends introduced her to William Paton Ker, a professor of English, who took her mountaineering in the Alps in 1913, triggering her lifelong interest in mountains. During the war she trained at Bologna to become a nurse, and was briefly engaged to Guido Ruata, an Italian doctor, who broke off the engagement to marry an old flame in 1916. On Ker's recommendation she joined George Trevelyan's ambulance unit in Italy as a nurse in 1917. Although she was frequently bedridden after the war, Stark was well enough to be climbing with Ker when he died of a heart attack in 1923. That year she also trekked through Europe with Venetia Buddicom (<i>d</i>. 1969), a railway heiress. The climax of her climbing life came in 1924, when she became the second woman to climb the east face of Monte Rosa. While convalescing from an ulcer she took Arabic lessons to become a governess in the Middle East, and was baptized Presbyterian to facilitate contacts with missionaries. She also studied Arabic briefly at the School of Oriental Studies in London. In 1926 Herbert Young (<i>d</i>. 1941), a friend of her parents, offered to leave his Asolo home to her if she would live there. She dropped a lawsuit against di Roascio that attempted to recover her mother's investment in his business, and with her mother moved to Young's home, which became known as Casa Freia.<br>
<br>In 1927 Stark lived in Lebanon for several months and travelled through Syria with Buddicom. Her father had provided her with some capital, and she visited him twice in Canada before she became his sole heir in 1931. She planned a journey to northern Persia after reading about the region at the British Museum. In 1929 she moved to Baghdad, where she went slumming in Arab clothing and was an outsider among priggish British expatriates. She gained acceptance after adventurous journeys to Lurestan and the Alamut district of Mazandaran, and the War Office made maps from her observations. She worked as a journalist in Baghdad and fell in love with Captain Vyvyan Holt (1896&#150;1960), a diplomat, who rebuffed her affections but advanced her career. He gave her intelligence briefings about the Kurdistan uprising that she published in <span class="italic">The Times</span> (for example, on 20 June 1932).<br>
<br>In 1933 Stark returned to London to receive accolades as a female traveller. She was awarded the Back grant from the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) and was the first woman to receive the Burton medal of the Royal Asiatic Society. Her account of her journeys, <span class="italic">The Valleys of the Assassins</span> (1934), was an immediate success, and known for its elegant prose, lively wit, and observations of people. She made many friends, especially Sir Sydney Cockerell, director of the Fitzwilliam Museum, who became a confidant. In 1935 she went to Hadhramaut, southern Arabia, in search of an ancient trade route. After she became ill the RAF airlifted her to a hospital in Aden, and she had a brief romance with Antonin Besse (<i>d</i>. 1951), a trading magnate. She returned a celebrity, and <span class="italic">The Southern Gates of Arabia</span> (1936), awarded the Mungo Park medal by the Royal Scottish Geographical Society, is often considered a classic of travel writing. Although short and plain in appearance, Stark now had the resources to indulge a taste for <i>haute couture</i> and flamboyant hats. In 1937&#150;8 she returned to Arabia with Gertrude Caton-Thompson, a distinguished archaeologist, for a dig sponsored by the RGS and Lord Wakefield. While others worked diligently Stark mostly stayed in bed, and the partnership ended acrimoniously. Stark returned on her own, riding a camel through the desert.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Stark joined the Ministry of Information as an expert on south Arabia, and worked as a propagandist in Aden, Yemen, and Egypt, where she became friends with General Archibald Wavell. Her main effort at propaganda, which she styled persuasion, was founding the Brotherhood of Freedom, an organization that attempted to build support for democracy and cadres of pro-British sympathizers through clandestine tea parties. In 1941 she returned to Baghdad to try, with little success, to establish the Brotherhood in Iraq. After Wavell invited her to India in 1943 she returned from Delhi to Tehran in a government car that she subsequently sold for her own profit. Despite her waywardness, the Ministry of Information thought well enough of her to arrange for her to lecture on Palestine in the United States in 1943&#150;4 in a fruitless attempt to counter the spreading of anti-British opinion by the Zionist movement. She spoke to women's groups in India in 1945, and returned to Italy at the end of the war to establish English reading rooms in the north of the country. Her politics were high tory; she always believed fervently in empire and remained hostile to nationalist movements, despite her empathy with many of the people she met on her travels.<br>
<br>After the war Stark turned from official propaganda to promoting herself. She published a collection of uplifting essays, <span class="italic">Perseus in the Wind</span> (1948), and the first volume of her autobiography, <span class="italic">Traveller's Prelude</span> (1950), a popular and elegiac account of her early life. She married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57383/', "Stewart Henry Perowne (1901&#150;1989)")</script>, a diplomatic colleague at Aden, Cairo, and Baghdad, on 7 October 1947 at St Margaret's, Westminster. After accompanying him to a posting in Barbados she returned to Asolo in April 1948. They reunited in 1950, when he was appointed to Benghazi, Cyrenaica (Libya), but he retired in 1951 and they separated in 1952. Perowne was a homosexual, and in many ways it was a marriage of convenience for them both. Stark longed to be married but found it difficult to sustain intimate relationships. She continued her autobiography in <span class="italic">Beyond the Euphrates</span> (1951), <span class="italic">The Coast of Incense</span> (1953), and <span class="italic">Dust in the Lion's Paw</span> (1961). Between 1974 and 1982 she published eight volumes of her letters at her own expense. Her public image was always carefully crafted and modulated and was seriously challenged in a biography by Molly Izzard (1993). This was followed in 1999 by Jane Fletcher Geniesse's well-rounded and sympathetic biography of Stark, <span class="italic">Passionate Nomad</span>.<br>
<br>In later life Stark turned away from contemporary concerns to meditate on history and landscape in a series of books based on journeys to sites of classical antiquity. In <span class="italic">Ionia: a Quest</span> (1954) she visited places described by Herodotus in Asia Minor, and later works followed in the footsteps of Alexander the Great and Lucullus. She also published books of her photographs and a history of the Roman imperial wars along the Euphrates. She continued to make demanding journeys, visiting Afghanistan in 1968 and Nepal in 1970. She joined BBC film crews on a raft on the Euphrates in 1977 and on horseback around Annapurna in 1980. She received the founder's medal from the RGS, the Percy Sykes memorial medal from the Royal Central Asiatic Society, and honorary doctorates from Glasgow and Durham universities. She was named CBE in 1953 and dame of the British empire in 1972, was made sister in the order of St John of Jerusalem in 1949 and sister commander in 1981, and was presented with the keys to Asolo on 26 May 1984.<br>
<br>Stark's early works often appear in anthologies of travel writing. Her personality and motivation to travel had been shaped by a complex relationship with her mother, and Stark's wider success as a writer and traveller owed much to an easy sociability learned from her. However, her strong personality polarized acquaintances into those who admired her as a charming eccentric, observant traveller, and prose stylist and others who considered her a vain, imperious mountebank. Late in life she was plagued by ill health, and she was <i>non compos mentis</i> for the last five of her 100 years. She died at Asolo on 9 May 1993. A memorial service was held at St James's, Piccadilly, on 28 September 1993. Despite her significant achievements as a traveller and her less well-known feats as a mountaineer, it is for her evocative and reflective prose that she is remembered.<br>
