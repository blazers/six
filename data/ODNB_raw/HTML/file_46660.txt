<span class="headword">Jones,  John</span>  (1777&#150;1842), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Carmarthen on 15 September 1777, the son of Thomas Jones, an attorney and estate agent, and his wife, Anna Maria, daughter of John Jones, also an attorney. After the death of his father in 1790 he was placed under the guardianship of his kinsman <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29518/', "John Williams (1757&#150;1810)")</script>, a serjeant-at-law. Educated at Eton College (1791&#150;3), and briefly at Christ Church, Oxford (1796&#150;7), he was admitted at Lincoln's Inn in 1798 and called to the bar in 1803 after being a pupil of his guardian. He subsequently developed an extensive practice on the south Wales circuit, being considered the region's leading advocate. Although not a great rhetorician, he was a cogent speaker and had &#145;an unerring judgement of the temper and tastes of a Welsh jury&#146;. One jury, indeed, is said to have announced its verdict thus: &#145;My lord, we are all for John Jones, <i>with costs</i>&#146;. He practised until the abolition of the court of great sessions in 1830, and later became chairman of the Carmarthenshire quarter sessions.<br>
<br>Able advocate though he was, Jones was most famous as a politician. In his youth, he was apparently the &#145;rankest Radical&#146; in Carmarthen  (George Thomas, letter to <span class="italic">The Welshman</span>, 6 May 1842), and a fierce supporter of Charles James Fox. His early political career in Carmarthen took place in association with the whigs, and he was mayor of the town in 1809. On their refusal to support his parliamentary ambitions, however, he defected to the tories, and with their support became member for Pembroke Boroughs (1815&#150;18), Carmarthen Boroughs (1821&#150;32), and Carmarthenshire (1837&#150;42). He was always a relatively poor man and his election expenses were met by subscriptions from his supporters.<br>
<br>In parliament, Jones followed Sir Robert Peel, even supporting Catholic emancipation in 1829. Jones's parliamentary career, however, was most interesting for his attention to local interests. Particularly important was his attempted defence of the court of great sessions, which the whigs in Wales (led by Lord Cawdor, Jones's chief opponent in Carmarthen) were seeking to abolish. Jones, in addition to urging the practical utility of the system, defended it on nationalistic grounds, arguing that the great sessions had been a gift to the nation from Henry VIII and that parliament must respect this. The court was abolished, however, in 1830.<br>
<br>For all his appeal to &#145;nationalism&#146;, Jones was no friend of the Welsh language: although he spoke Welsh himself and was instrumental in founding the Welsh Anglican Church in Carmarthen, he earnestly sought the decline of the Welsh tongue which he believed hindered the material progress of Wales. This was, however, only one instance among many of the paradoxes which were the hallmark of Jones's character. Despite the &#145;populist&#146; style of his political campaigns, for example, he opposed the extension of the franchise in 1832. Hospitable and genial, he nevertheless had a most violent temper, as his antics during the 1831 election revealed. Not only did he assault a fellow lawyer in the street, believing him to be the author of a hostile article in the <span class="italic">Cambrian</span>, but he also brawled with the leader of a rioting election mob, and fought a duel with the Hon. G. F. Greville. This side of his character earned him the nickname &#145;Jack Slack&#146; after the celebrated pugilist. John Jones died unmarried at his seat, Ystrad Lodge, Carmarthenshire, on 10 November 1842. His death robbed the principality of one of its most colourful public figures.<br>
