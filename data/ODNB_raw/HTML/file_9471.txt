<span class="headword">Finlayson,  Thomas</span>  (1809&#150;1872), <span class="occ">minister of the United Presbyterian church</span>, second son in the large family of Thomas Finlayson, a farmer, was born at Coldoch, Blair Drummond, Perthshire, on 22 December 1809. He received an elementary education at the parish school at Kincardine in Menteith, and then studied classics at a school in Doune, Kilmadock, before entering Glasgow University. Here and at the Divinity Hall of the United Secession church he trained as a minister; he was licensed as a preacher of the gospel in April 1835 by the presbytery of Stirling and Falkirk. Part of his period of study was spent in teaching a school at Dumbarton, where he formed a friendship with the Revd Dr Andrew Somerville, later secretary of the foreign mission of the United Presbyterian church. In November 1835 Finlayson was ordained as minister of the Union Street congregation, Greenock, where he founded a missionary society, and in two years persuaded his people to pay off the large debt of &pound;2500 remaining from building the church. His marriage on 7 and 10 August 1836 to Janet Chrystal of Gargunnock, Stirlingshire, brought them six children.<br>
<br>After twelve years at Greenock Finlayson was called to be colleague and successor to the Revd John M'Gilchrist of Rose Street Church, Edinburgh; he was inducted to the ministry there in September 1847. The church was an influential one within the Secession and Finlayson soon became a popular figure in it, remarkable for his practical wisdom and open contempt for hypocrisy. He was elected moderator of the supreme court of his church in 1867, and soon afterwards received a DD from the University of Edinburgh. Finlayson devoted much time to ecclesiastic affairs and was an effective fund-raiser. At Rose Street he successfully encouraged his congregation to clear the &pound;2300 debt on their church. An enthusiastic promoter of the manse fund, he was the chief agent in raising &pound;45,000, which led to the spending of &pound;120,000 in building and improving 200 manses. He was also much involved in the management of the augmentation fund, and initiated and organized a scheme for improving ministers' libraries. As a preacher &#145;he excelled in distinct and powerful exhibition of the truth&#146;  (MacEwen, 20): &#145;his tall, robust frame, his frank open face, [and] the honest ring of his voice&#146; enhanced the impression created by his straightforward and heartfelt sermons  (ibid., 13). Whatever he had to say came fresh from his own independent thought, went straight to the heart of the subject, and made an immediate impression on his hearers.<br>
<br>The early death in 1868 of his eldest son, Thomas, caused Finlayson intense grief, from which he never fully recovered. On 7 October 1872 his congregation celebrated the semi-jubilee (twenty-five years) of his ministry in Edinburgh, presenting him with a gift of &pound;1000. Having gone to Campbeltown to take part in an induction service there, he suffered a heart attack, and was found dead in his bed on 17 October 1872. He was buried in the Grange cemetery, Edinburgh, on 22 October. Two married daughters and one son survived him.<br>
