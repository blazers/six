<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Compton,  Spencer</span>, earl of Wilmington  (<em>c.</em>1674&#150;1743), <span class="occ">prime minister</span>, was the sixth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46937/', "James Compton, third earl of Northampton (1622&#150;1681)")</script>, his third son with his second wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1719), the eldest daughter of Baptist Noel, third Viscount Campden. He was educated at St Paul's School, enrolled at the Middle Temple in 1687, and was admitted a commoner at Trinity College, Oxford, in 1690. Although he failed in an attempt to enter parliament in 1695, he was returned for Eye, Suffolk, at a by-election in June 1698. Among his whig brethren he cut a slightly odd figure, coming from a family of high-church tories (his uncle was Henry Compton, bishop of London), but a violent quarrel with his elder brother George, fourth earl of Northampton, had turned him to the whigs. He was a dull and uninspiring speaker in the Commons and his gifts were limited to a mastery of rule and precedent. By the early years of Queen Anne's reign he had none the less established himself among the more prominent whig politicians, and among his <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/73609', "Kit-Cat Club")</script> confr&egrave;res enjoyed a particular rapport with the young Robert Walpole. In the Commons he chaired the elections and privileges committee from 1705 until 1710, a role usually considered a stepping stone to the speakership.<br>
<br>In 1707 Compton was given office as paymaster of pensions and appointed treasurer to the queen's consort, Prince George. His support for the Marlborough&#150;Godolphin ministry was invariably assiduous, though as a faithful lord treasurer's whig he was least enthusiastic towards the admission of junto whigs to office late in 1708. Difficulties with his electoral patron, Lord Cornwallis, precluded his re-election for Eye in 1710, but, having been one of Henry Sacheverell's severest persecutors at the impeachment trial earlier in the year, he took no steps to secure election elsewhere. The incoming tory ministers nevertheless retained him in his paymaster's office until 1713, though probably out of consideration for his many family connections among the tories.<br>
<br>During this hiatus in his career Compton acquired an estate near Eastbourne in Sussex, and in 1713 he re-entered parliament for the Sussex borough of East Grinstead. At the accession of George I he was said to have been resentful at not receiving immediate recognition from senior whigs in the new ministry, particularly as he had several times been tipped for high office in the preceding reign. After the general election early in 1715, however, during which he was chosen a knight of the shire for Sussex, he became treasurer to the prince of Wales (the future George II), and, on reassembling in March, the Commons unanimously adopted him as speaker. He was sworn of the privy council on 6 July 1716. Despite certain shortcomings, his unflawed knowledge of precedent and the rulings of previous speakers suited Compton particularly well for the role, and he presided over the house with characteristic punctiliousness for the next twelve years. His innate formality and hauteur lent dignity to proceedings, though John Hatsell has suggested that his notions of maintaining order were somewhat lax, and reported an anecdote that Compton would rebuke MPs who called on him to quieten noisy debates and who insisted on a right to be heard with the words, &#145;No sir, you have a right to speak, but the House have a right to judge whether they will hear you&#146;  (Hatsell, 2.108). His successor, the renowned Speaker Onslow, described him as &#145;very able &hellip; in the chair, but [he] had not the powers of speech out of it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Buckinghamshire MSS</span>, 516). At the ministerial split in 1717, to which the prince of Wales's quarrel with his father had in a major way contributed, Compton, as head of the prince's household, joined the Townshend&#150;Walpole group in opposition and thus found himself in the unusual predicament of having to fulfil his duties as speaker while technically in opposition to the king's ministers. Yet he achieved this feat until the reconciliation of 1720 without incurring the least hint of displeasure.<br>
<br>Compton's loyalty to Walpole had been unswerving during the years of the whig schism, but their differing situations were accentuated after the ministerial reconstruction of 1721 which brought Walpole to power. While Walpole could realistically expect to remain at the helm under George I, the prince's appreciation of Compton's efficient management of his household led him often and openly to declare that he had no intention of retaining Walpole when he himself became king and that Compton would replace him. For the time being, Walpole did what he could to keep Compton out of ministerial politics by promoting his re-election to the speaker's chair in 1722; he also pandered to his avaricious instincts by having him appointed paymaster-general, one of the most lucrative offices in the administration. Compton was reputed to have made &pound;100,000 during his tenure of the post between 1722 and 1730. Moreover, in May 1725 he was included in Walpole's newly revived knighthood of the Bath. At the news of George I's death in May 1727 the new king ordered Walpole to take his instructions from Compton. But, on finding himself suddenly encumbered with affairs of state, Compton lost his nerve and needed Walpole's assistance even in the preliminary task of drafting George II's declaration to the privy council. Over the next few days his limited acumen became painfully apparent, and was ultimately confirmed in royal eyes by the ungenerousness of his proposals for Queen Caroline's income compared with those produced by Walpole. At an interview with the king, at which Walpole was also present, Compton reportedly broke down, declaring that the burden of leading the king's administration would be far too great for him. In later years he would gloss over these events by claiming that &#145;affairs abroad were in so bad [a] situation that [he] durst not be premier minister&#146;  (<span class="italic">Egmont Diary</span>, 1.375). Compton thereafter bore an unremitting sense of grievance against Walpole for having inflicted on him so public a humiliation.<br>
<br>The king's continuing regard for Compton ensured the latter's retention in the ministry as paymaster, though by the end of the year Walpole was fully aware that he was involved in the growing &#145;confederacy&#146; of discontented whigs now ranged against him. On 8 January 1728 Compton was created a peer and took the title of Baron Wilmington in the county of Sussex. He was later to claim that Walpole had &#145;forced it upon him&#146; in the belief that Compton &#145;had conceived too strong hopes of being [his] superior ever to serve in the House of Commons quietly under him, and that it might be dangerous, consequently, to suffer him in the chair of the new parliament&#146;  (Hervey, 1.39). Wilmington's slow-burning hatred of Walpole was never extinguished. Over the next few years he was one of several prominent members of the administration who, while outwardly supporting ministerial measures, privately maintained a dialogue with leading opposition whigs and tories. At the time of the parliamentary crisis over the French refortification of Dunkirk early in 1730, in which Walpole's majority in the Commons became seriously endangered, he was widely recognized as head of a coterie of senior whigs poised to take over whenever Walpole should fall from favour. During the subsequent reshuffling of Walpole's ministry in April, Wilmington was appointed lord privy seal, a surprise choice generally assumed to have been the king's, as against the known wishes of his first minister. Thus brought into the &#145;inner&#146; or &#145;effective&#146; cabinet of ministers, Wilmington formally took office on 14 May, and six days later was promoted in the peerage to the earldom of Wilmington. He was made a DCL at Oxford University on 5 August. Towards the end of December he was appointed lord president of the council, a post which placed him in charge of the administrative apparatus of the privy council.<br>
<br>Wilmington was described by Lord Hervey in his <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> as:<blockquote>a plodding, heavy fellow, with a great application, but no talents. &hellip; He was always more concerned for the manner and form in which a thing was to be done than about the propriety or expediency of the thing itself; and as he was to execute rather than project &hellip; so he was much fitter for a clerk to a minister. Whatever was resolved upon he would often know how properly to perform, but seldom how to advise what was proper to be resolved upon. (Hervey, 1.24)</blockquote>In the House of Lords he barely ever spoke but never wavered from the ministerial line. His name was associated with a re-emergence of the old anti-ministerial faction in the summer of 1732, and during the excise crisis of March&#150;April 1733 he and his kinsman the duke of Dorset threatened to resign their posts in protest against the proposed dismissals of other courtiers who opposed the scheme in parliament. Wilmington was won back by Walpole apparently with a renewed promise of the Garter. He received this on 12 June and was installed at St George's, Windsor, on 22 August. He had largely ceased by this stage to enjoy the close confidence of the king, though their continuing friendship kept him in office. At a time when a number of prominent peers had openly committed themselves to opposition, Wilmington's failure to follow suit rendered him odious in the eyes of leading opposition luminaries, one of whom, Lord Chesterfield, wrote in June 1734 that &#145;the President is as contemptible and subservient as ever&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 2.281).<br>
<br>Wilmington's next few years were spent quietly in the performance of his ministerial duties until the beginnings of dissension within the cabinet early in 1739 over policy towards Spain inspired fresh rumours of his intention to resign. Although by the summer of 1740 he and Dorset were regarded as titular leaders of one of three main ministerial factions, he avoided participation in the cabinet quarrels over strategic objectives in the war against Spain and continued at least outwardly to support Walpole. He did not refrain, however, from connivance with several of Walpole's enemies during the election campaign in the spring of 1741. Denying any personal ambition for himself, he once more became explicit in his censure of Walpolian power, and to acquaintances he privately expressed his view that &#145;the true interest of England was to have no chief minister &hellip; that every great office should be immediately dependent on the king and answer for itself&#146;  (<span class="italic">Egmont Diary</span>, 3.250). Behind the scenes he advocated a new broadly constructed ministry that included opposition elements, believing that the king's power would be preserved thereby from future encroachment by particular ministers or factions. He took his part among the cabinet council members who towards the end of January 1742 quietly advised George II of the impossibility of conducting essential supply business in the Commons if Walpole continued in office; on 2 February Wilmington was summoned by the king and appointed in Walpole's place as first lord of the Treasury.<br>
<br>From the first it was understood that Wilmington, now somewhat elderly and ill with the stone, would hand the effective work of managing the Treasury to a new chancellor of the exchequer. Although he was not at all qualified by political ability for this most senior of ministerial positions, his appointment bore all the marks of the calculation and shrewdness of others. The leading ministerialists Lord Hardwicke and the duke of Newcastle (quite possibly with Walpole's own connivance) had carefully manoeuvred William Pulteney, Walpole's chief opponent and his obvious successor, into rejecting the Treasury, all along smoothing the way for Wilmington as their desired choice. As the holder of a senior if largely non-powerful cabinet position, he was sufficiently far removed from Walpole, as well as being acceptable to the king. It was not until Wilmington had taken office, however, that his own &#145;broad bottom&#146; views came into play and caused disturbance. Placing himself at odds with those who had been instrumental in his appointment, he joined the duke of Argyll and his sympathizers in demanding a new ministry that included leading tories in addition to former dissident whigs; but when on 13 February Wilmington found that Carteret had been appointed secretary of state (and effective head of the administration) without any prior consultation with himself, he confronted George II with a threat of resignation, dismayed that the ministry was being reconstructed substantially on its old narrow footing and with so many of Walpole's supporters still dominating the field. As ever, royal persuasion worked its effect on Wilmington and he remained in office. His own stewardship as premier was distinctly lacklustre, and in the time that was left to him he was no more than a ministerial figurehead presiding over a group of ministers among whom Lord Carteret, due to his influence with the king, was the real controlling force.<br>
<br>Wilmington died on 2 July 1743 at his house in St James's Square, London, and was buried at Compton Wynyates, Warwickshire, the resting place of many of his forebears. It had already been planned to replace him at the Treasury with Henry Pelham later in the year. Although he was unmarried, Wilmington was understood to have fathered several illegitimate children, one of whom was the wife of James Glen, for whom in 1739 Wilmington procured the governorship of South Carolina. He left his entire estate, most of it in Sussex, including his seat, Compton Place, Eastbourne, to his nephew James Compton, fifth earl of Northampton.<br>
