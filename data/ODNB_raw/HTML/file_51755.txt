<span class="headword">Nimmo,  Margaret Jane</span>  (1850&#150;1938), <span class="occ">headmistress</span>, was born on 20 October 1850 at 9 Ash Grove, South Hackney, Middlesex, the daughter of David Nimmo, an Independent minister, and his wife, Mary (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Hutton). Until 1865 she was educated at home, but thereafter she took advantage of the new educational opportunities opening up for women. From 1865 to 1869 she attended Bedford College, London, one of the only two colleges then open to women in England, extending her studies both there and in France and Germany between 1869 and 1873. Having taken the University of London general examination for women in 1870, she became in 1875 a teacher at the fledgeling Notting Hill High School for Girls, one of the first Girls' Public Day School Company (GPDSC) schools and almost a training school for future headmistresses. After the University of London amended its charter to allow women to take degrees in 1878, she left Notting Hill and enrolled herself at University College, London, gaining her BA in 1881.<br>
<br>When the Blackheath GPDSC High School for Girls opened in 1880, Miss Nimmo became its second mistress and its first graduate teacher. Here she established high standards in mathematics and classics and taught &#145;interesting and instructive&#146; experimental chemistry despite little support as yet for science. She transplanted the new disciplined ethos of girls' public secondary education when appointed first headmistress of King Edward VI Grammar School for Girls, Birmingham, in 1883. This school was a prime example of the post-1869 extension of educational endowments to girls; it was founded in 1880 at the insistence of the charity commissioners for girls up to the age of seventeen. One half of the scholarships were held by girls who had attended public elementary schools. Paid a professional salary, Miss Nimmo created a working atmosphere in a school which ran like clockwork. She put considerable stress upon information, rote learning, and competition, and developed high academic standards with increasing numbers going on to university, although, until 1910, subjects like science and gymnastics suffered from a lack of facilities.<br>
<br>Remembered for her severe, Savonarola-like features and black, rustling silk gowns, Miss Nimmo was regarded as an all-seeing, authoritative figure. She took great care to keep her girls segregated from boys. A teacher was on one occasion reprimanded for playing tennis without a hat on. Yet Miss Nimmo was also affectionately recalled as sympathetic and always concerned for the welfare of the girls. She oversaw the grammar school's move from Aston to Handsworth in 1911 and amalgamations which, by 1915, increased the pupils under her to about 460, some 300 more than when the school opened in 1883. Although not a radical, Miss Nimmo therefore did much to extend educational opportunities for girls in Birmingham. She retired in 1915 but frequently attended school functions and, in fact, used the speech day of 1920 to lead a successful protest against the local authority taking over the King Edward schools.<br>
<br>Known as a &#145;puritan liberal&#146; who doubted whether a Conservative could be honest, and a determined upholder of free trade, Miss Nimmo suited well the dominant Birmingham nonconformist bourgeoisie. Although not supportive of militant suffragism on her staff, she was said to have mellowed in later years. She retired to Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire, where she died at her niece's house at Hethersett North Park on 7 April 1938; she was buried at Brookwood cemetery.<br>
