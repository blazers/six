<span class="headword">Ashurst,  William Henry</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Edward Search]</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1791?, <em>d.</em> 1855), <span class="occ">lawyer and radical</span>, was born in London, and was probably the William Henry Ashurst baptized on 20 March 1791 at St Luke's, Old Street, the son of Brusel Ashurst and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hook (<span class="italic">IGI</span>; <span class="italic">DNB</span> gives his birth date as 11 Feb 1792, apparently in error). &#145;Consciously educated to the energy and self-dependence which distinguished him throughout his life by the spectacle of the aimless, thriftless existence led by his father&#146;  (Venturi, 81), who, it is implied by the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, believed himself to be the son of the judge William Henry Ashurst (1725&#150;1807), Ashurst became a committed and energetic proponent of a multitude of advanced radical causes. After a formal education &#145;no better &hellip; than could be obtained at a dame school&#146;  (ibid.), he was apprenticed under a solicitor. He gained his articles at a young age, supplementing his income by journalism and copy work engrossing legal documents. It is recorded that he married at the age of nineteen: this was almost certainly to Elizabeth Ann Brown (<i>d</i>. 1854), on 30 October 1810, at St Mary Magdalene, Bermondsey  (<span class="italic">IGI</span>).<br>
<br>Ashurst's earliest radical legal work centred on his opposition to payment of the church rates. He published pamphlets in 1835, 1837, and 1839 during anti-church rate activism in Bungay, Southwark, and Chelmsford respectively, while his orchestration of the famous and protracted Braintree case (1837&#150;53) eventually resulted in the abolition of mandatory church rates.<br>
<br>Although in early life Ashurst had belonged to a freethinking Christian sect, he became attracted to the moral principles of Owenism and forged a close alliance with the leaders of freethought, serving Robert Owen as both patron and legal adviser. Ashurst financed a succession of freethought journals (principally <span class="italic">The Reasoner</span>, for which he wrote as Edward Search, and the <span class="italic">Spirit of the Age</span>) and organizations (the Anti-Persecution Union and the Theological Utilitarians) centred on George Jacob Holyoake: a man to whom Ashurst had offered legal assistance in his 1842 blasphemy trial, in his purchase of the Paternoster Row and Fleet Street House publishing enterprises in the 1850s, and in his campaign against the stamp tax. Indeed Ashurst is credited with suggesting the term &#145;secularist&#146; to Holyoake to describe the non-religious moral and ethical system around which both men based their radicalism. Ashurst also financed the radical weekly <span class="italic">Leader</span> newspaper (founded in 1850), edited by Thornton Leigh Hunt.<br>
<br>Deeply influenced by the writings of Paine and Franklin and the example of the American constitution, Ashurst associated himself with various campaigns against tyranny, oppression, and inequality. Meeting William Lloyd Garrison at the World Anti-slavery Convention in London in 1840 Ashurst made this occasion the forum for his own parallel crusade for the emancipation of women. On these twin platforms of sexual and social emancipation Ashurst contributed frequently to Garrison's <span class="italic">Liberator</span> under the pseudonym Edward Search. Ashurst was a vigorous proponent of reform, regarding the undemocratic Lords and ineffectual Commons alike as &#145;a drag on the onward progress of the Nation&#146;  (Venturi, 85), and in 1832 he displayed a poster on his house front with the slogan &#145;This House pays no taxes until the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> becomes law&#146;. In 1837 he published <span class="italic">The Advance of Democracy</span>, a crystallization of his democratic and republican political philosophy.<br>
<br>Ashurst was an active municipal politician, serving as a common councilman, elected chair of the committee of City lands, and serving for one year as under-sheriff of London; his <span class="italic">Corporation Register</span> (1832) was a manifesto for reform of City government in the light of these experiences. His official attendance at a public execution also engendered his lifelong opposition to capital punishment.<br>
<br>Ashurst's reforming zeal animated his vigorous campaign for the penny post. In 1837, working as unpaid solicitor, Ashurst formed the Mercantile Committee of leading bankers and industrialists to press the case, presenting a mass of statistical evidence before parliament (later published as an exhaustive summary, <span class="italic">Facts and Reasons in Support of Mr Rowland Hill's Plan</span>, 1838): a crucial factor in the victory secured in 1840. Ashurst's legal help and tireless activism in the Association for the Repeal of the Taxes on Knowledge was also central in the successful conclusion of the long radical campaign against the stamp tax.<br>
<br>Ashurst met Mazzini in 1844 at the height of the letter opening affair and, out of the axis of sympathy among metropolitan radicals for the cause of European democracy, the People's International League was born in 1846. Ashurst was a founder member and trustee, and the league's principal recruiter. Following the fall of Mazzini's Roman Republic, Ashurst founded the Society of the Friends of Italy in 1851, which raised &pound;13,000 for the cause of Italian unification and republicanism in five years (Ashurst himself contributed &pound;740).<br>
<br>Ashurst's energetic and diverse radical activity ensured that his Muswell Hill home was for twenty years the epicentre of metropolitan radicalism. Known as the &#145;Muswell Hill brigade&#146;, the attendees at the regular Sunday evening gatherings included the leaders of the campaigns for freethought, emancipation, and European democracy.<br>
<br>Ashurst once remarked that &#145;agitation is for the people that troubling of the water which produces health and vigour&#146;  (Venturi, 89). The multitude of his activities: feminism, anti-slavery, European (especially Italian) nationalism and republicanism, secularism, and administrative reform paint a picture of a uniquely energetic and vigorous man. It was while visiting Garrison and the other abolitionists in America in 1853 that Ashurst's health finally broke down. The death of his wife soon after his return shattered it completely, and Ashurst died at Park House, Wandsworth, Surrey, on 13 October 1855. He was survived by his son, William Henry Ashurst (1819&#150;1879), who was also a solicitor (and later, from 1862 to 1879, solicitor to the Post Office), and his daughters Elizabeth [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/42330/', "Ashurst, Elizabeth Ann")</script>], Caroline [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56461/', "Stansfeld, Caroline")</script>], Matilda [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59172/', "Biggs, Matilda")</script>], and Emilie [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50085/', "Venturi, Emilie")</script>], all of whom were active in the causes espoused by their father.<br>
