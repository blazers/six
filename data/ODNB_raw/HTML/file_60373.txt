<span class="headword">O'Brien,  Leslie Kenneth</span>, Baron O'Brien of Lothbury  (1908&#150;1995), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born on 8 February 1908 in Dulwich, London, the son of Charles John Grimes O'Brien (1878&#150;1949) and his wife, Caroline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Abbott (1879&#150;1969). His father's family came originally from Killaloe in co. Clare, Ireland, but settled in England in the early nineteenth century. O'Brien was educated at Wandsworth School, London, from about 1918 to 1926, and joined the Bank of England as a clerk in 1927. During the next twenty-four years he rose steadily in the bank's hierarchy as his innate abilities were recognized in what was already a hierarchy of merit, at least until the glass ceiling which separated court and the governor from the mundane professionals. Of significance for the future, he served early on as secretary to the governor, Montagu Norman, after the twin crises of the second Labour government's fall in 1931 and the subsequent National Government's abandonment of the gold standard in 1932. While not privy to the highest-level negotiations, O'Brien learned something of crisis atmospheres and the intricacies where high politics and banking interacted to produce harsh burdens for central bankers confronted with politicians playing by very different rules.<br>
<br>After his marriage to Isabelle Gertrude (1908&#150;1987), daughter of Francis Pickett, on 2 April 1932, O'Brien moved to Worcester Park, Surrey, where their only child, Michael, was born. Promotion followed rapidly, giving O'Brien a senior post in the overseas department and a widening acquaintance with European, dominion, and United States central bank officials. During and after the Second World War it was of great value for him not only to know and understand the intricacies of exchange control, but to see the heavy problems of the sterling area and the outstanding sterling balances (which had financed much of Britain's early war effort), through the eyes of Australian, Canadian, or Indian bank governors and, even more important, those of the American federal reserve. Dedicated to the institution all his life, full of insight and innovation, but undramatic and virtually apolitical, O'Brien (who, with his family, settled comfortably in Wimbledon from 1942) appeared to be one of the Bank of England's leading technicians&#151;a quality recognized when he was appointed deputy chief cashier in 1951. With Sir Kenneth Peppiatt, his senior, and then as chief cashier himself after 1954, he matured techniques for using bank rate as an instrument of monetary management for the first time since Britain had left the gold standard twenty years earlier.<br>
<br>From 1954 until 1962 the note issue bore O'Brien's name, and he was fortunate in that the rules which evolved&#151;or were relearnt&#151;appeared to work in the barely inflationary 1950s. O'Brien became an executive director in 1962 and then deputy governor in 1964. For a man with a relatively humble background, the glass ceiling still appeared impervious, as it had done for other professionals in the long era of Norman and his patrician successors, lords Cobbold and Cromer. But whereas Cobbold had set out in tandem with government and dominion central bankers to ensure Britain's post-war financial stability, Cromer's outspokenness and independent-mindedness estranged Harold Wilson, prime minister from 1964. Wilson required a man who would not set the bank's view against the government's when it came to defining the national interest&#151;in this case the uneasy relationship of sterling to the dollar at a time when the Labour government not only had to borrow but was under strong American pressure to support the war in Vietnam in return for any support of sterling.<br>
<br>No one doubted O'Brien's intellectual ability and experience, but few actually knew much about the man or about the lessons he had unobtrusively drawn from experience over the previous thirty crisis-ridden years. Appointed governor in 1966 in a striking display of the meritocratic flavour of the 1960s Wilson government, O'Brien displayed the ability but none of the docility predicted by Treasury officials. He had seen how Norman had shaped the bank to the state's requirements long before nationalization, in preparation for war in the late 1930s, and as a loyal official O'Brien had fully accepted its subordinate position thereafter. But though he deplored both Cromer's methods and his <i>de haut en bas</i> attitude, he shared his predecessor's mistrust of the way that Keynes's prescriptions were already being misused as a permanent cure-all, with the inevitable risk of inflation. Accepting, as he always did, decisions once they had been made, O'Brien robustly argued the bank's case for a stable monetary policy so long as discussions with the chancellor continued.<br>
<br>After the July 1966 crisis and through the devaluation d&eacute;b&acirc;cle in 1967 (against which he struggled hard but without effect) O'Brien addressed four principal policy areas: first how to stabilize sterling, now that it was merely a volatile adjunct to the dollar system; second, how to manage the economy at a time of rapidly rising inflation, created at least partly (in his view) by excessive increases in public spending; third, how to renew the flow of investment to domestic industry; and, finally, how to modernize the City of London's financial institutions before their markets were lost to American banks, and later to Japanese and European contenders. O'Brien was perhaps the first post-war governor with the capacity to answer each of these problems, but the late 1960s were a bad time to argue the virtues of monetary and fiscal prudence.<br>
<br>The sterling balances were indeed stabilized (in the short term), thanks partly to O'Brien's skilful diplomacy at Basel in 1968. With Harold Lever, Wilson's financial emissary, he also helped to avert a second devaluation in March the same year by negotiating with the American authorities. Soon afterwards, and under a new chancellor, Roy Jenkins, the bank's <span class="italic">Quarterly Bulletin</span> was able to take a more explicit line about O'Brien's desire for a permanent but flexible monetary policy, and for a bank rate more influenced by market demand. But the chosen means, &#145;competition and credit control&#146; (CCC), as evolved by O'Brien and his team, were disputed by the Treasury precisely because of this element of market demand from industry, which would have diminished governmental influence. Revived by Anthony Barber in 1971, CCC emerged in a different form at a uniquely unsuitable time. After the reintroduction of bank rate as minimum lending rate (MLR) in the 1972 crisis, it was suspended on Treasury demand.<br>
<br>O'Brien had transferred his admiration for Roy Jenkins to Heath (who confirmed his second term of office in 1970) mainly because he believed that EEC entry would induce Britain's long-delayed industrial transformation; but that did not survive Iain McLeod's premature death, which left Anthony Barber, the new chancellor, in thrall to a prime minister who set aims, notably curbing unemployment, above monetary discipline. O'Brien agreed with Heath that industrial managers had failed to take advantage of the new credit regime, but disagreed with him on how to deal with the malignant combination of high wage-inflation and speculative property lending which in 1973 produced a 25.6 per cent increase in money supply accompanied by a real interest rate of 1.2 per cent. Like Cromer, O'Brien had to confront the prime minister and chancellor to ask them to raise MLR in mid-1972. They refused, fearing the effect on the cost of living and subsequent trade-union wage demands. All O'Brien could do, informally and with Treasury officials' assent, was to manipulate the Treasury bill rate sufficiently to push the rate to 9 per cent in June. The governor's special deposits scheme, which he evolved later in 1972, might have helped to check the boom, but that too was denied him. Finally implemented by his successor Gordon Richardson as the so-called &#145;corset&#146;, it may, paradoxically, have intensified the final post-oil-shock collapse.<br>
<br>O'Brien was no more successful in freeing the retail banks from government controls on lending, in order to compete on a more equal level with the American institutions and the secondary or fringe banks, which enjoyed a laxer supervision by the Board of Trade. His long policy of encouraging industry to seek medium-term loans and consequently to innovate and make structural adjustments rather than to rely on overdraft finance was, like CCC in its latter form, overtaken by the sustained crisis faced by Edward Heath's government in June 1972, when sterling was floated. O'Brien regarded this with extreme distaste, believing that fixed rates were the basis of sound monetary discipline, but he was not called back from holiday to advise, nor was he included in the discussions which preceded Heath's <span class="roman">Industry Act</span> of 1972.<br>
<br>O'Brien's contribution to his fourth policy problem, that of reforming the City's financial institutions, drew strength from work done earlier&#151;from Anthony Crosland's inquiry into banking profits, and from his establishment of the Mergers and Takeover Panel. Committed to the principle of self-regulation, O'Brien made sure that the bank modernized itself and its services with more transparent presentation of its accounts. Among his reforms, the Institutional Investors' Working Party had some effect on the flows and quality of investment. In the bank's domestic aspect O'Brien's skills as a negotiator and broker of opinion accentuated sound existing trends, but the forces of inertia in the City remained almost as powerful at the time of O'Brien's retirement as they had been in 1966.<br>
<br>As governor of the Bank of England, O'Brien became a protagonist in a dual struggle between an increasingly global set of financial realities and the domestic British defence of an eroding, post-war, welfare-state economy; and between the bank community, guarding the currency and the nation's long-term financial stability, and the political parties and elected governments whose top priority remained high employment. In so far as 1969&#150;72 saw a determined government defence of the post-war settlement, O'Brien was denied the influence that Richardson later possessed, once the focus of monetary policy changed. His own marker can be found in a definitive speech, delivered in October 1977 to the Belgian Royal Society, in which he clearly linked central bank independence to effective control of money supply and the curbing of inflation.<br>
<br>Angered by the policies of the Heath government, but too loyal to the state either to protest publicly or resign, O'Brien retired in February 1973 on his sixty-fifth birthday, only half way through his second term of office. He was created Baron O'Brien of Lothbury on his retirement (having been knighted GBE in 1967 and appointed a privy councillor in 1970). In retirement he served as a director of Prudential Assurance, Unilever, the Rank Organization, and various other companies, and he also served on the boards of the National Theatre and the Royal Opera House development appeal. He kept up late in his life an enthusiasm for tennis as well as music and the theatre. His first wife, Isabelle, having died in 1987, he married, on 6 January 1989, Marjorie Violet Taylor, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ball (<i>b</i>. 1923), with whom he moved to Oxted, Surrey. He died at the East Surrey Hospital, Redhill, on 24 November 1995, following a stroke. A lifelong Anglican, his ashes were buried in the graveyard of St Peter's Church, Tandridge, Surrey, on 1 December. He was survived by his second wife, Marjorie, and the son of his first marriage, Michael.<br>
