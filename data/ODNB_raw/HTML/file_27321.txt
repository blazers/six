<span class="headword">Thomson,  Richard</span>  (1794&#150;1865), <span class="occ">antiquary and librarian</span>, was born at 25 Fenchurch Street, London, the second son of a Scotsman. Little else is known of his family; he may have been the person of that name who was baptized at St Botolph without Bishopsgate on 29 June, the son of Joseph and Susan Thomson, but this cannot be confirmed. His father travelled for and became a partner in a firm of seed merchants called Gordon, Thomson, Keen &amp; Co., and variant names  (London directories). A brother, James, was to continue in the family business in Fenchurch Street and also became honorary secretary to the Royal Highland School Society. It must be assumed that Richard was educated privately, and he never attended university. He appears to have enjoyed private means; there is no evidence that he entered any profession before he reached the age of forty. Instead he developed an interest in exploring the antiquities of London, and published a number of valuable historical studies. Heraldry was one of his hobbies, and he assisted enquirers in investigating their pedigrees.<br>
<br>In 1820 Thomson published <span class="italic">Account of processions and ceremonies observed in the coronation of the kings and queens of England, exemplified in that of George III and Queen Charlotte</span> and also <span class="italic">The Book of Life: a Bibliographical Melody</span>, presented to the members of the Roxburghe Club (though he was not, as became customary, a member), followed by a particularly finely printed edition of Izaak Walton's <span class="italic">The Compleat Angler</span> (1823) and <span class="italic">Chronicles of London Bridge</span>, &#145;by an Antiquary&#146; (1827; 2nd edn, 1839), a useful, if not entirely accurate (cf. Gordon Home, <span class="italic">Old London Bridge</span>, 1931) compilation of historical sources (a special enlarged edition, with manuscript continuation, is in the Guildhall Library). He published <span class="italic">Illustrations of the History of Great Britain</span> (1828) in volumes 20 and 21 of <span class="italic">Constable's Miscellany</span> and the anecdotal <span class="italic">Tales of an Antiquary</span> (1828; 2nd edn, 1832), published anonymously in three volumes and dedicated (and sent) to the author of <span class="italic">Waverley</span>, in the apparent hope of a review in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span>. Sir Walter Scott described the book as &#145;one of the chime of bells which I have some hand in setting a ringing&#146;, and believed that its author &#145;really is entitled to the name of an antiquary. But he has too much description in proportion to the action. There is a capital wardrope of properties but the performers do not add up to their character&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal</span>, 448). &#145;The Legend of Killcrop the Changeling&#146; was printed in <span class="italic">Nimmo's Popular Tales</span> of 1866  (pp. 238&#150;53). <span class="italic">Historical Essay on Magna Charta</span> appeared in 1829.<br>
<br>Thomson was a frequenter of the London Institution in Finsbury Circus, where he met and became a lifelong friend of the architect William Tite, its honorary secretary from 1824 until 1869. It was undoubtedly through the latter's influence that on 14 August 1834 Thomson and Edward William Brayley were elected joint librarians of the London Institution, following the retirement of William Maltby and the resignation of William Upcott. The catalogue of that library (then containing about 27,000 volumes), issued in four volumes between 1835 and 1852 and considered a model for its period, was largely compiled by Thomson, who published little else during these years. He did arrange, classify, and illustrate the antiquities found during the excavations for Tite's new building of the Royal Exchange; they were deposited in the museum of the corporation  (W. Tite, <span class="italic">Descriptive Catalogue of the Antiquities Found in the Excavations at the Royal Exchange</span>, 1848, xlv). Thomson contributed poems imitating the great authors to <span class="italic">A Garland for the New Royal Exchange</span> (1845), edited by Tite. He produced, anonymously, <span class="italic">Historical notes for a bibliographical description of mediaeval illuminated manuscripts of hours, offices, &amp;c.</span> (1858), <span class="italic">Lectures on Illuminated Manuscripts and the Materials and Practice of Illuminators</span> (1858), and <span class="italic">An Account of Cranmer's Catechism</span>, printed as a memorial book for his friends and Tite's (1862).<br>
<br>Thomson died at the institution on 2 January 1865, aged seventy and unmarried. During his lifetime he had given the institution anonymously many valuable works and bequeathed it the sum of &pound;500. He was buried at Kensal Green cemetery in the same grave as his brother James, who had predeceased him in 1858.<br>
