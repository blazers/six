<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Binney <span class="st"> [Benny]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (1798&#150;1874), <span class="occ">Congregational minister</span>, was born on 30 April 1798 at Newcastle upon Tyne, presumably the Thomas Benny who was baptized on 3 June 1798 at Wall Knoll Presbyterian Chapel. If so, he was the son of John Benny, who was baptized on 5 September 1759 at Wooler West Presbyterian Chapel in north Northumberland, the son of Edward and Anne Binney. John Benny was an elder in the congregation at Wall Knoll. After attending a local school Thomas Binney spent the years from 1811 to 1818 as an apprentice to a bookseller. Despite working long hours he was able to study Latin and Greek under the tuition of a Presbyterian minister, as well as exercising himself in English composition by writing in imitation of Samuel Johnson and composing poetry in imitation of <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span>. He left the Presbyterian church, became a Congregationalist, and in 1819 entered the Wymondley Academy, Hertfordshire. In 1823 he became minister of the New Meeting, Bedford, but left after twelve months. He received a call from St James's Street Chapel, Newport, Isle of Wight, in August 1824 and was inducted into the pastorate on 29 December 1824. At a church meeting at King's Weigh House, Eastcheap, London, on 14 May 1829 it was resolved to invite him to become minister there at a salary of &pound;600 a year. He accepted and remained there until his retirement.<br>
<br>In 1832 plans to widen the approach to London Bridge made it necessary to demolish the chapel, and a new one to accommodate 1000 people was built in Fish Street Hill at a cost of &pound;16,000. Binney spoke at the stone-laying ceremony, and when the speech was published he added an appendix in which he included the declaration that the established church &#145;is an obstacle to the progress of truth and godliness in the land; that it destroys more souls than it saves; and that, therefore, its end is most devoutly to be wished by every lover of God and man&#146;  (Kaye, 67). It sparked off an animated controversy and brought instant public attention to its author. In later years he admitted that he began life as a high-Independent, but he was soon to prove himself a moderate dissenter. He certainly objected to the state establishment of religion, but he also pleaded for closer co-operation between dissenters and Anglicans, with joint communion services and exchange of pulpits, in <span class="italic">The Ultimate Object of the Evangelical Dissenters</span> (1834), and argued in <span class="italic">Dissent not Schism</span> (1834) that disagreement about church government was a secondary matter and nonconformity should not be construed to mean the renunciation of Christianity. Desire for closer fellowship between churches of his own denomination also led him to support the inauguration in 1832 of the Congregational Union of England and Wales, of which he was chairman in 1848.<br>
<br>King's Weigh House was a church consisting of young city businessmen, members of the middle class, and a few rich people, none perhaps quite as rich as the philanthropist Samuel Morley (1809&#150;1886). People of this kind found Binney's new style of preaching very much to their taste. In dress and demeanour he symbolized the passing of the age of the silver shoe-buckle, the knee-breeches, and the gold-headed cane. He discarded the black preaching gown. His sermons were in the main expository, although he occasionally exploited some topical item of news. They were never more than thirty minutes in his earlier years, but twice that length later. Since his voice was comparatively weak, he adopted a conversational style, eschewing rhetorical flourishes and flights of imagination, preferring to construct a clear, logical argument. He was at his best when demonstrating the relevance of the gospel to everyday life. During his last years, his preaching declined in quality and lost its early intensity. But even that did not diminish his popularity as preacher and lecturer. The founder of the Young Men's Christian Association, Sir George Williams (1821&#150;1905), was a member of the church, and Binney was in regular demand as a lecturer in meetings of the association. His best-known lecture was <span class="italic">Is it Possible to Make the Best of both Worlds?</span> (1853). It sold 31,000 copies in its first year and by 1856 was in its tenth edition. He pioneered the introduction of more formal liturgical elements into dissenting worship. He had bewailed the low standard of congregational singing in his introduction to the <span class="italic">Weigh House Tune Book</span> (1843) and one of his best sermons was <span class="italic">The Service of Song in the House of the Lord</span> (1848). He promoted the interest in liturgy by editing the American C. W. Baird's <span class="italic">Chapter on Liturgies</span> (1856) and adding an appendix, &#145;Are dissenters to have a liturgy?&#146; With these convictions he introduced at his church anthem singing, the chanting of psalms, public confession, and responsive prayers. But surprisingly he consistently opposed the introduction of an organ in his church. Among the numerous hymns that he composed, only &#145;Eternal light, eternal light&#146; is still in use.<br>
<br>Binney was not a learned theologian and objected to the use of technical theological jargon. He rejected the idea that Christ's death was the price paid for human sin as well as the concept of a substitutionary atonement. In fact, his thinking exemplifies the gradual disintegration of the traditional Calvinism of Congregationalists. Yet he was described by his contemporaries as an evangelical and was one of the trustees of the <span class="italic">Evangelical Magazine</span>. He was not a political activist. Although he had strong private political convictions, he stood apart from the various campaigns that characterized dissenting activities in the Victorian era. Apart from the Congregational Union, the one organization that had his enthusiastic support was the Colonial Missionary Society, which was brought into being on 13 May 1836, and of which he was the main founder. This was inspired by the fact that many of the young men in his church were emigrating to Australia.<br>
<br>Binney was twice married. His first wife was Isabella Barbara Nixon, who died in 1843. They had four sons who emigrated to Australia and died there. His second wife was Elizabeth Piper, the daughter of Thomas Piper, one of his deacons. She survived him.<br>
<br>In November 1855 Thomas Toke Lynch (1818&#150;1871) published <span class="italic">Hymns for Heart and Voice: the Rivulet</span>. James Grant (1802&#150;1879), the editor of the <span class="italic">Morning Advertiser</span>, attacked it as a volume containing &#145;not one particle of vital religion or evangelical piety&#146;  (Jones, 250). A furious controversy erupted which all but destroyed the Congregational Union. Binney was appalled and sought to restore peace by suggesting that the union should cease to transact public business and confine itself to spiritual and devotional fellowship. The controversy brought about an attack of the debility that occasionally affected him, and he visited Australia to seek better health. Again he was engaged in controversy when the bishop of Adelaide wrote to him to explain why he could not accede to the request of many prominent Australians, including the governor, to allow him to preach from Anglican pulpits. He also visited Tasmania and addressed its Congregational Union on &#145;The church of the future&#146;.<br>
<br>In his latter years, Binney's health deteriorated. In 1865 he was assisted in the ministry by Llewelyn David Bevan (1842&#150;1918) of New College, London, and in June 1869 he resigned. In the following December he was presented with a cheque for &pound;1333 as a token of appreciation for his services. He continued to preach until 1873 and lectured on homiletics at New College. By the end of 1873 he was suffering acutely from ill health. He died at his home, Doric Lodge, in Upper Clapton, on Tuesday 24 February 1874. His funeral was attended by a huge crowd. The service was held at Stamford Hill Congregational Church and the interment was on 2 March at Abney Park.<br>
<br>Of Binney's eighty-two publications, most were individual sermons and lectures, of which the most significant have been mentioned. Binney was a towering figure in his time and was considered one of the leading representatives of nonconformity, as his honorary doctorates from Aberdeen in 1852 and an American university in 1861 testify, but he can hardly be considered a typical one.<br>
