<span class="headword">Mann <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Gye]</span>, Dame  Ida Caroline</span>  (1893&#150;1983), <span class="occ">ophthalmologist</span>, was born on 6 February 1893 at 67 Fordwych Road, West Hampstead, London, the second child and only daughter of Frederick William Mann (1854?&#150;1935), an official in the Post Office, and Ellen Packham (1851?&#150;1936). Her father's family came originally from Norfolk, her mother's from Cuckfield in Sussex, of which rural connection Mann was always proud. As a child she developed a love of reading and especially of writing poetry which lasted throughout her long life. She was educated at Wycombe House School, Hampstead and then, guided by her ultra-cautious father, she began work at sixteen in the safe but stultifying atmosphere of the Post Office Savings Bank. Soon, however, influenced largely by a chance visit to a hospital open day, she developed a strong desire to study medicine, and eventually was able to enter the London School of Medicine for Women in 1914. Her schooling had been interrupted by many childhood illnesses, but from this point her health became robust and thenceforward she showed a daunting capacity for work. With further periods of training at the Royal Free and St Mary's hospitals, she qualified MB BS in 1920. During the period at St Mary's she assisted Professor J. E. S. Frazer in embryological research; her developmental studies were presented as a dissertation for the DSc (London, 1924), and formed the basis of her notable first textbook, <span class="italic">The Development of the Human Eye</span> (1928), still in print forty years later.<br>
<br>This training in research methods opened up a new world to Mann. She later wrote in <span class="italic">The Chase</span> (1986), her autobiography, that the greatest joy she ever experienced was when seated alone at her microscope: &#145;Just the thrill of knowing I had seen something no one else had ever seen before kept me happy for days&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Chase</span>, ed. Golding, 77). No matter what other duties were laid on her (and she was extraordinarily hard-working in her daily clinical activities), Mann was driven to pursue original knowledge in this way. Her exposure during midwifery training as a medical student to the perils of birth and motherhood convinced her that she herself had no desire for marriage or children, and she thereby gained extra time in which to apply her driving curiosity to exploring the complexities of ocular development. Often this involved overturning long-standing but erroneous beliefs. This latter aspect indeed characterized both halves of Mann's professional career: as well as fighting her way into clinical positions hitherto largely closed to women, she revelled also in sweeping away facile and poorly thought out &#145;conventional wisdom&#146; by finding out the facts and forcing them on the notice of the often reluctant authorities.<br>
<br>After qualifying Mann decided to specialize in ophthalmology, and took her first post under Leslie Paton at St Mary's, becoming FRCS in 1924. She also held several teaching appointments while she progressed up the ladder towards consultant ophthalmologist status, reaching the highest point in 1927 with appointment as senior surgeon on the staff of Moorfields Eye Hospital, London, the first woman ever to do so. At the same time she established a Harley Street practice and consolidated herself as a leading clinical ophthalmologist in London, but still carried on her developmental studies and teaching (including the diploma course in Oxford). In this period up to the Second World War she learned and promoted the then new technique of slit-lamp microscopy of the eye, applying it both to patients and to animals in the London Zoo. She was also instrumental in bringing to London in 1938 Josef Dallos, the Hungarian pioneer of glass contact lenses, just ahead of the Nazi take-over of Hungary, and with him she established the first contact lens centre in the United Kingdom.<br>
<br>With the outbreak of war it became necessary to evacuate Moorfields. At the instigation of Sir Hugh Cairns Mann moved to Oxford in 1941 to undertake the clinical training of medical students diverted from London, and there she was appointed to Margaret Ogilvy's readership in ophthalmology, as well as a personal chair, the first woman ever to hold the title of professor in the University of Oxford, and a professorial fellowship in St Hugh's College. Despite this time-consuming work she still travelled to London to perform surgery, carried out important research on the ocular effects of war gases, and kept up a staggering number of other activities, including the vigorous reorganization of Oxford Eye Hospital. In this period she was the first to use penicillin to treat ocular infection. The Nuffield Laboratory of Ophthalmology was established in Oxford, aided by a donation from Lord Nuffield, to provide Mann with research facilities and room to treat her private patients separately from her clinical commitments in the neighbouring Oxford Eye Hospital. Here she appointed the biochemist Antoinette Pirie (later her successor as reader) as her research assistant. Together they wrote the influential book, <span class="italic">The Science of Seeing</span> (1946), in part to refute Aldous Huxley's &#145;pernicious psychotic book&#146; <span class="italic">The Art of Seeing</span>.<br>
<br>On 30 December 1944 Mann married the pathologist Professor William Ewart Gye (1884&#150;1952), the son of Charles Bullock, an agricultural worker, and his wife, Ellen Elizabeth Prosser. Gye was the director of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund. Mann retained her maiden name to avoid having two Professor Gyes in the same house. They had no children, but she helped and supported her three stepchildren throughout her life, as well as taking responsibility for her brother's children after his and his wife's early deaths.<br>
<br>At the end of the war Mann returned to London as Oxford still resisted the idea of making ophthalmology an academic discipline. But she was unhappy with the changes in medicine following establishment of the National Health Service in 1948, feeling that the old autonomy and the trust between doctor and patient had been compromised. This, together with her husband's poor health, exacerbated by the post-war restrictions on food and fuel in bitter winter weather, decided them to overwinter in warmer conditions, and they sailed for Australia in 1949. Their intention may have been to return, but they had presciently taken their household goods with them, and once settled in Perth they decided to stay. She resigned her Moorfields appointment in 1950 (and was apparently never forgiven by them for doing so).<br>
<br>Once settled, Mann and her husband used their combined experience to establish pure-bred strains of laboratory animals in Australia for research and pathological purposes. After her husband's death in 1952 Mann felt free to undertake, in addition to a private ophthalmic practice, a long series of journeys throughout Australia and Oceania to study ocular health and the incidence of disease in many lands, races, and cultures; in particular she studied the incidence of trachoma in the Aboriginal communities of Western Australia and Northern Territory. While she described many of her adventures in lighter books, including <span class="italic">The Cockney and the Crocodile</span> (1962), under the <i>nom de plume</i> (although her own name) of Caroline Gye, the serious outcome was the classic <span class="italic">Culture, Race, Climate and Eye Disease</span> (1966). Sometimes as a representative of the World Health Organization, or the Australian government, and sometimes just to satisfy her own curiosity, she continued these explorations to a considerable age, and at the same time worked tirelessly for the improvement of ocular health throughout Australia, especially through her own ophthalmic practice and by improvements in medical training. In recognition of Mann's many contributions to research, teaching, and clinical practice, she was appointed CBE (1950) and DBE (1980), as well as receiving honorary degrees, prizes, and medals from many countries.<br>
<br>Mann lived at 56 Hobbs Avenue, Nedlands, Perth, where she died on 18 November 1983. She was cremated at Karrakatta cemetery crematorium in Perth. A distinguished ophthalmologist, Mann was equally well known for her pioneering research work on embryology and development of the eye, and on the influences of genetic and social factors on the incidence and severity of eye disease throughout the world.<br>
