<span class="headword">Freer,  Ada Goodrich</span>  (1857&#150;1931), <span class="occ">folklorist and psychical researcher</span>, was born at Uppingham on 15 May 1857, the daughter of George Freer, a veterinary surgeon, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Adcock. Throughout her life she concealed her origin, giving the impression of coming from Yorkshire with connections to the landed gentry and the Scottish highlands. Under the patronage of F. W. H. Myers she became active in the Society for Psychical Research. She wrote papers on her psychical experience under the pseudonym of Miss X which Myers read to the society (collected in <span class="italic">Essays in Psychical Research</span>, 1899). From 1893 to 1897 she was assistant editor (to W. T. Stead) of <span class="italic">Borderland</span>, again writing as Miss X. In 1894 she was, on Myers's recommendation, given charge of the society's inquiry into second sight in the highlands and islands. On her second visit to the Hebrides, in 1895, she met Father Allan McDonald and gained access to his extensive and important collection of Hebridean folklore. From 1897 she published a substantial part of it under her own name, initially in articles in <span class="italic">Folklore</span>, acknowledging McDonald's help but falsifying the character of her own work (she did not speak Gaelic in 1895 and her knowledge of the language was never more than rudimentary).<br>
<br>Miss Freer became involved in the contentious cases of the Clandon House haunting (1895), the Burton letters (1895&#150;7), and the ghost hunt at Ballechin House, Perthshire (1897). She was severely criticized by J. Callendar Ross in <span class="italic">The Times</span> (8 June 1897) and was subsequently disowned by the society. With Lord Bute, who had paid for the Scottish &#145;second sight&#146; inquiry, she wrote <span class="italic">The Alleged Haunting of B[allechin] House</span> (1899), defending the ghost hunt. She abandoned psychical research and focused on folklore. In December 1901 she went to Jerusalem, where she finished <span class="italic">Outer Isles</span> (1902; her chief work and most substantial plagiarism of McDonald), wrote <span class="italic">Inner Jerusalem</span> (1905), and married an American, the Revd Hans Henry Spoer, in 1905. Her husband believed her to be almost twenty years younger than her age. She subsequently published other works on the Near East, accompanied her husband to Britain in 1909&#150;11, and lived in Cairo from 1911. She moved to Detroit in 1923, to Sycamore, Illinois, in 1926, and to New York in 1927, where her husband was chaplain to the New York Mission Society. She died at St Luke's Hospital, New York, on 24 February 1931 (her death certificate giving her name as Adela Monica Spoer), survived by her husband. Her laudatory obituary in <span class="italic">Folklore</span> (vol. 41, 1931) made no mention of Father McDonald.<br>
