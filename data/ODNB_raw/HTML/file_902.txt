<span class="headword">Murray <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Maese; <em>other married name </em>Aust]</span>,  Sarah</span>  (1744&#150;1811), <span class="occ">travel writer</span>, is of unknown parentage. It has been suggested that she may have been the Sarah Maese who ran a girls' school in Beaufort Square, Bath, in the 1760s and published <span class="italic">The School: being a Series of Letters, between a Young Lady and her Mother</span> in 1766 but there is no conclusive evidence and no record of the school has survived. A letter exists which may link Sarah Maese to the bluestocking Elizabeth Montagu  (Montagu letters) but this link remains unproven. She married her first husband, the Hon. William Murray (1734&#150;1786), a naval officer, brother of the earl of Dunmore, by special licence on 11 August 1783. From 1782 to 1793 she lived at 23 Kensington Square, Kensington, London. She then moved to 19 Kensington Square and while living there, in 1802, she married again. George Aust (<i>d</i>. 1829), her second husband, served as under-secretary of state for foreign affairs from 1790 until 1796 and as secretary and registrar of Chelsea Royal Hospital. She remained at 19 Kensington Square until 1806, when she and George Aust moved to Noel House on the site of Palace Gate; there George had built a new house for which Sarah laid out the grounds.<br>
<br>In May 1796 Sarah Murray began a five-month tour of Scotland with the specific aim of writing a guidebook. Travelling by carriage with a maid and manservant, Murray set out to &#145;see every thing worth seeing&#146;  (Murray, 43). <span class="italic">A companion, and useful guide to the beauties of Scotland, to the lakes of Westmoreland, Cumberland, and Lancashire</span> was published in 1799. As well as giving a full description of Murray's own travels, the book provided specific information about inns, horses, road conditions, prices, equipment, and mileages. Reviews of the book appeared in the <span class="italic">British Critic</span> (October 1799) and the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> (April 1800). It was well received by the critics, who considered its detailed practical information to be of particular interest. They also expressed their admiration for Murray's intrepidness, although the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> commented &#145;that she rather over-rates the difficulties and dangers which it was necessary to encounter, before a perfect view of the country could be obtained&#146;  (p. 404).<br>
<br>Until the 1790s no guidebooks were available to guide the English tourist in his or her own travels around the highlands. Earlier travellers had relied on human guides, often Gaelic-speaking, together with descriptions by those few who had gone before, such as Martin Martin and Thomas Pennant. Murray's <span class="italic">Companion, and Useful Guide to the Beauties of Scotland</span>, although not the first guidebook, was certainly one of the earliest to be published.<br>
<br>Murray depicted herself as a model for &#145;adventurers, who may follow my steps&#146;  (Murray, vii), and her frequent inclusion of advice aimed specifically at women made it evident that she expected both women and men to read and follow her. She demanded considerable physical courage and fitness from her followers sending them up mountains, into boats, and across rickety foot-bridges, and advising them to &#145;creep&#146; to the foot of waterfalls, &#145;skip&#146; from rock to rock in fast-moving rivers, and &#145;scramble&#146; up and down difficult ascents and descents. They were also expected to tolerate the discomfort of bad inns, all for the sake of beauty.<br>
<br>Murray frequently claimed to be a true &#145;lover of nature&#146;  (Murray, 111) whose enthusiasm for the landscape made her oblivious of hazards. The book is replete with descriptions of Murray, a widow of fifty-two at the time of the trip, engaged in adventurous and physically demanding travel.<br>
<br>A second series of journeys resulted in the 1803 publication of <span class="italic">A companion and useful guide to the beauties in the western highlands of Scotland, and in the Hebrides. To which is added, a description of part of the main land of Scotland, and of the Isles of Mull, Ulva, Staffa, I-Columbkill, Tirii, Coll, Eigg, Skye, Raza, and Scalpa</span>. During one of these journeys, in 1801, she became the first woman to ascend one of the Cairngorms, a feat she carried out on horseback. This new volume was reviewed in the <span class="italic">Annual Review</span> (1803), <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> (February 1804), and <span class="italic">British Critic</span> (June 1804). Although the reviews were a little less favourable than the previous set, a second edition of both volumes was published in 1805. In 1810 Murray published a combined and updated edition of the two guidebooks under the name &#145;The Hon. Mrs. Murray Aust&#146;.<br>
<br>Sarah Aust died childless on 5 November 1811 at Noel House and was buried on 11 November 1811 with William Murray, her first husband, in St Mary Abbots Church, Kensington. A marble tablet to her memory was erected within the church by George Aust, her second husband.<br>
