<span class="headword">Arthur,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1708?, <em>d.</em> 1772), <span class="occ">actor and designer of stage machinery</span>, was most probably the son of Thomas and Mary Arthur who was baptized at St Paul's Church, Covent Garden, London, on 23 April 1708. In September 1730 he made an appearance at Southwark fair as a forester in the pantomime <span class="italic">Harlequin's Contrivance</span>, and in the summer of 1737 he joined the theatre company at York, where he appeared in his own ballad opera <span class="italic">The Lucky Discovery, or, The Tanner of York</span>. A quarto edition of Arthur's play was published in York in 1737, and a second edition appeared in London the following year. In the autumn of 1737 the actor joined the company of John Rich at Covent Garden, where he made his d&eacute;but on 17 November as Clodpole in Thomas Betterton's <span class="italic">The Amorous Widow</span>. He went on to play a number of different roles in his first season, including Pate in Richard Brome's <span class="italic">The Northern Lass</span> and Lyrick in George Farquhar's <span class="italic">Love in a Bottle</span>. In 1739 he was engaged by Hippisley and Chapman to appear at Bartholomew fair, where he was billed as Signor Arthurini, a comedian possessing &#145;upwards of 50 Whimsical, Sorrowful, Comical and Diverting Faces&#146;.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1741 Arthur left Covent Garden and joined Charles Fleetwood's company at Drury Lane. Three years later, following the walkout led by David Garrick and Charles Macklin, he returned to Covent Garden. He moved again to Drury Lane at the beginning of the 1747 season, and performed under the joint management of Garrick and James Lacy. Although Arthur remained at Drury Lane for only a single year, his comic performances, most notably as Gripe in Mendez's <span class="italic">The Double Disappointment</span>, gained him favourable reviews.<br>
<br>In September 1748 Arthur returned to Covent Garden, where he remained for ten seasons. During this, his third and longest spell with Rich's company, he developed an enormous repertory of minor comic roles, including Fondlewife in William Congreve's <span class="italic">The Old Bachelor</span> and Dashwell in Edward Ravenscroft's <span class="italic">The London Cuckolds</span>. According to the <span class="italic">Theatrical Review</span>, his comic skills were best displayed in the characters of old men and country fools: &#145;His eyes in particular have an odd cast &hellip; His features are very variable, and there runs thro' his whole countenance and performance a certain ludicrous gravity, that commands laughter irresistibly&#146;  (<span class="italic">Theatrical Review</span>, 1758, 27).<br>
<br>The earliest evidence of Arthur's interest in stage design exists in proposals published by the actor in April 1741 for building &#145;a new and commodious Theatre&#146; at York. Although his plans came to nothing, he quickly developed a reputation as a skilled designer of stage machinery. In the summer of 1741 he became involved with Garrick in a mysterious &#145;Catapult-project&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 1.21). Three years later he was paid &pound;1 1<i>s</i>. for scenery he produced for a performance of John Dryden's <span class="italic">All for Love</span> staged by the duke of Bedford at Woburn Abbey. After his return to Covent Garden in 1744, Arthur's ability to contrive and build elaborate stage machinery was exploited by Rich, who commissioned the actor to create original devices for his pantomimes.<br>
<br>In 1760 Arthur became manager of the Orchard Street Theatre, Bath, under the ownership of the elder John Palmer. While at Bath he pursued his long-standing interest in theatre design, and modelled and built a new theatre at Portsmouth in 1761. On 30 May 1766, together with William Powell and Matthew Clark, he opened a new theatre in King Street, Bristol. The first night, which included a prologue and epilogue written specially for the occasion by Garrick, raised &pound;63 for the benefit of the Bristol Infirmary. Having been forced out of the King Street management at the end of the summer, Arthur concentrated on remodelling the Orchard Street Theatre at Bath. His fascination with grand design helped produce a building &#145;esteemed in fancy, elegance, and construction, inferior to none in Europe&#146;  (Penley, 34). The theatre reopened on 28 March 1767, but faults in the architecture soon became apparent. The large dome, the centrepiece of Arthur's new design, was found to hamper the acoustics, and in 1778 the theatre had to be extensively rebuilt.<br>
<br>Arthur was twice married. Although little is known of his first wife, it seems likely that she was the Mary Arthur who later found employment in the service of the actress Margaret Woffington. A letter from Garrick reveals that this Mrs Arthur was &#145;brought to bed&#146; in July 1741, but there is no evidence that the child survived  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 1.26). Following her death, on 6 August 1768, Arthur's first wife was described as &#145;a Woman of nice Chastity, and possess'd of those amiable wifely Qualities that render Marriage happy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bath Journal</span>, 8 Aug 1768). On 29 October 1768 Arthur married the actress Grace Read, previously a performer at Drury Lane and the Haymarket. Read had acted alongside Arthur at the opening of the King Street Theatre, Bristol, in 1766, and had moved back with him to the Bath company in 1767. In the summer of 1769 the two joined Samuel Foote's company at the Haymarket, where they made a joint appearance in Foote's <span class="italic">The Devil upon Two Sticks</span>.<br>
<br>Arthur died at Bath on 8 April 1772, after which Grace Arthur retired from the stage. The couple are not thought to have had any children.<br>
