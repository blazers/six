<span class="headword">Loveday,  Emily Mary</span>  (<em>b. </em>1799), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic convert</span>, was born on 28 December 1799 and baptized at St Paul's, Hammersmith, Middlesex, on 24 February 1800, the eldest daughter of Douglas Charles Loveday (1786/7&#150;1843) and his wife, Eliza, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sharp (1775/6&#150;1861). Her father was admitted at the Middle Temple in 1812 and was called to the bar in 1830. In 1816, following the restoration of the French monarchy, he bought property in Auteuil, a fashionable town on the outskirts of Paris. A protestant Englishman, he was granted full civil rights as a Frenchman by royal decree on 3 December 1817.<br>
<br>In July 1819 Emily Loveday, then aged nineteen, and her sister Matilda Susan, then eighteen, were placed by their father, who was returning to England, in a Parisian boarding school run by Ernestine Reboul. Douglas also entrusted the school with his niece Mary, the eldest daughter of his brother, the governor of Benares and a major-general in the British army. Two years later, in October 1821, he returned to France to find that his daughters had converted to Catholicism, and on 3 November he removed them from the school; they were followed by his niece after her announcement that she too had entered the Catholic communion. He succeeded in persuading his younger daughter to renounce her new faith, but Emily Loveday resisted his pressure and on 10 November she fled to the Couvent des Enfans Trouv&eacute;s (foundlings), from where she moved to the home of a Mr Jerningham, a British Catholic resident in Paris. Her father discovered her there early in December 1821 and persuaded her to return to his house in Paris. On 14 December, fearing that her father was determined to take her back to England, she fled and sought refuge in the convent of the Sisters of Notre Dame in the rue de S&egrave;vres in Paris, where the gendarmes were called to preserve the peace when her father tried to force his way in.<br>
<br>These events created a brief sensation in both France and England in December 1821, when Douglas Loveday, who had appealed to the French police and to the English ambassador to intervene on his behalf, presented a petition to the French chamber of peers and deputies, dated 28 December 1821 (Emily Loveday's twenty-second birthday), protesting against her conversion and accusing the headmistress of the crime of <i>rapt de s&eacute;duction</i>, or kidnapping by seduction, a charge normally reserved for the circumstances of an amorous elopement. This would usually have been a matter for the law courts, since it centred on a legal custody dispute and the civil rights of a foreign subject in France, but Emily Loveday had reached an age of majority (twenty-one), as defined by France's civil code.<br>
<br>The Loveday affair caused consternation in England, where both pervasive anti-Catholicism and calls for Catholic emancipation were highly contested. Reprinting Douglas Loveday's petition, <span class="italic">The Times</span> described it as providing evidence of &#145;the seduction to Popery of an English gentleman's daughters and niece, by arts of the most horrible kind&#146;  (9 Jan 1822). The allegation that the girls were terrified into conversion by the thirteenth-century legend of the Jew and the miraculous host prompted the radical publisher William Hone to publish, together with Douglas Loveday's petition, a translation of the version of the legend originally drawn up for Louis XIV, to demonstrate the &#145;pious frauds through which the crafty devotees at Paris seduced the female branches of Mr Loveday's family&#146; under the &#145;priest-ridden&#146; Bourbon regime  (<span class="italic">The Miraculous Host</span>, 16&#150;17). Emily Loveday's reply to her father's petition, published in January 1822, in which she insisted that her conversion was inspired by the piety of her school companions and her own reading of the theologian Bossuet, was dismissed as the work of another hand, and &#145;an insult to a parent's feelings by a hired scribbler, at the instigation of a fanatical daughter&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 23 Jan 1822).<br>
<br>In France, where twelve thousand copies of Douglas Loveday's petition were printed in pamphlet form in January 1822, the affair pitted ultra-royalists intent on restoring the authority of the Catholic church and a newly established restoration monarchy against an anti-clerical liberal opposition. While both the right and the left upheld the principle of paternal authority, which was enshrined in Napoleonic law, they found themselves contradicting their most revered principles. Ultra-royalists ironically defended Emily Loveday's individual rights and relinquished the principle when the interests of the Catholic church were at stake. Anti-clerical liberals, on the other hand, abandoned the claim to individual rights and embraced Douglas Loveday's cause.<br>
<br>Ultimately the chamber of deputies dismissed Loveday's claims, as did their counterparts in the chamber of peers, despite protests from liberals like Benjamin Constant. Douglas Loveday's request for the custody of his daughter was denied, and Emily Loveday was allowed to stay in the convent of the Sisters of Notre Dame in Paris.<br>
<br>The commentary on the affair in both England and France revealed the power of national stereotyping that fuelled religious and political debates on both sides of the channel. It also called into question the rights of women in France in the domain of religious expression and conscience following the promulgation of the Napoleonic civil code. While Emily Loveday disappeared from the public record after 1822, her father became the centre of considerable attention in Paris once again, sixteen years later (1838), when the celebrated musician Nicol&ograve; Paganini threatened to sue him for his failure to pay for the piano lessons that Paganini had given to another of Douglas Loveday's daughters, Clara, whose talents some compared to Chopin and Liszt.<br>
