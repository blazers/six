<span class="headword">Vere,  Aubrey (III)  de</span>, count of Gu&icirc;nes and earl of Oxford  (<em>d.</em> 1194), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28203/', "Aubrey (II) de Vere (d. 1141)")</script>, royal chamberlain, and Alice (<i>d</i>. 1163?), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5436/', "Gilbert de Clare")</script>, and sister of Gilbert fitz Gilbert de Clare, earl of Pembroke. Among his eight siblings was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/95042/', "William de Vere")</script>, who became bishop of Hereford in 1186. By the time of his father's death Aubrey (III) was already politically prominent. His career was remarkable for the accumulation of large numbers of estates throughout England. In 1139 he had acquired the comital title by marrying Beatrice, the heir to her grandfather, Manasses, count of Gu&icirc;nes in the Pas-de-Calais (who enjoyed a moiety of the lordship of Folkestone and estates in the honour of Boulogne in Suffolk). He defected to the Empress Matilda in the aftermath of the capture of Stephen at Lincoln in February 1141. In May 1141 Count Aubrey succeeded his father, who had died in a riot in London. It would seem that he was briefly reconciled to the king after Stephen's release in September 1141, for there is a reference to the king's confirmation of the lands he had from his father. In 1141 the empress had offered him for his adherence the earldom of Cambridge, or, if that was not satisfactory, a choice of four other titles: he chose Oxford. She added to these grants the castle of Colchester. At this time Earl Aubrey was closely associated with his brother-in-law, Geoffrey de Mandeville, earl of Essex, and was arrested with him in 1143, having to surrender the castle of Canfield to secure his release. He was a character of some importance in East Anglia during the latter years of Stephen's reign. There seems every reason to believe (in view of the number of appearances in his charters) that Earl Aubrey acted as an auxiliary of Geoffrey de Mandeville, until the latter's death in 1144. If so, he would have spent a period in opposition to the king. But it is equally likely that after Mandeville's death, Earl Aubrey would have returned to neutrality; something that his close family connection with the loyalist Clares would have made easy to accomplish. Between 1144 and 1146 he was divorced from his wife, thus losing his connection with Gu&icirc;nes. When he remarried he was clearly in King Stephen's obedience once more, for the king and queen contributed the manor of Ickleton, Cambridgeshire, to the marriage portion of the new countess, Euphemia, who had died by late 1153, and who was said on later evidence to have been the daughter of William de Cantilupe. The countess on her deathbed made a grant for the late queen's soul and that of her son, which was confirmed by the king.<br>
<br>In 1153 Earl Aubrey was with Stephen's army at the siege of Wallingford, and he attested the treaty of Westminster, which established the succession, in November 1153. With the accession of Henry II in 1154 Earl Aubrey was able to make good his claim to his comital rights in Oxfordshire, where the new king conceded him the third penny of the profits of justice in a charter of January 1156, and also allowed him succession to the chamberlainship of the exchequer which the earl's father had held. The castle of Colchester, however, was not confirmed to him. The earl attested royal charters until 1160, but thereafter disappears from the Plantagenet court for a time. He was active however on the king's behalf during the wars of 1173&#150;4, joining the royalist army which defeated the earl of Leicester's invasion in Suffolk. He attended the king in England several times before Henry II's death in 1189, and was at the first coronation of King Richard in September of that year.<br>
<br>Earl Aubrey's later career was notable for the notorious divorce proceedings he took to rid himself of his third wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62379/', "Agnes of Essex (b. 1151, d. in or after 1206)")</script>, daughter of Henry of Essex, the royal constable, whom he married early in 1163 (when she was twelve) inopportunely just before her father's disgrace and ruin. Earl Aubrey pursued his case to Rome, where it was ultimately settled in Agnes's favour in 1171 or 1172. The earl had in the meantime kept his wife under close guard in one of his castles, refusing her leave to go out even to hear mass and refusing to acknowledge her as countess of Oxford. There does seem to have been a reconciliation between the pair ultimately: Countess Agnes attested several of his later charters and consented to an alienation of a rent from her marriage portion to Colne Priory; also all the earl's four sons were born from his marriage with Agnes (including the youngest, named Henry after his disgraced grandfather). Earl Aubrey died, probably in his late seventies, possibly even his early eighties, on 26 December 1194, and was buried at Colne Priory in Essex, being survived by Countess Agnes. He left four sons: his heir, Earl Aubrey (IV) de Vere, Ralph (who died before his elder brother), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28217/', "Robert de Vere")</script>, who later succeeded to the earldom, and the Henry already mentioned. The chronicle of Lambert of Ardres calls him (perhaps as a pun on his surname) Aubrey Aper (&#145;the Boar&#146;). This is doubtless the source of the de Vere family's livery badge, a boar's head, found on their seals as early as the later thirteenth century. Later tradition calls him Aubrey the Grim from a mistranscription of <i>aper</i> as Asper.<br>
<br>Earl Aubrey's significance in the politics of the anarchy and the early Angevin monarchy is by no means small: his volatility and attachment to the Mandeville earls made Essex unstable in the 1140s and threatened the king's control of London. The remarkable thing is that he was able to achieve so much on so narrow a landed base. The <span class="italic">carta</span> of his honour of Hedingham reveals in 1166 a barony of merely 29<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> and <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> fees held in chief, and his earldom of Oxford brought no assets other than the annual third penny. The answer to this puzzle would seem to be the enormous wealth accumulated by his father as a leading royal justice. Through this, and through political favours, he followed his father's own work in accumulating a great demesne estate in Essex and Suffolk from many sources, the mechanics of which may be partly glimpsed through notes of the lost archive once at Hedingham. This tells of substantial conveyances from at least a dozen individuals, including the duke of Brittany, the earl of Hertford, the bishop of Ely, and the abbot of Bury St Edmunds. Earl Aubrey continued to patronize in lavish style his father's foundation of Colne Priory, and, in addition, confirmed gifts to his father's other foundation of Hatfield Regis. He also made modest grants to the nuns of Hedingham, whose house he perhaps founded.<br>
