<span class="headword">Hill,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1628&#150;1677), <span class="occ">nonconformist minister</span>, was born at Derby and attended Repton School. Before attending Cambridge University, according to Calamy, Hill was &#145;sometime a domestic to the earl&#146; of Chesterfield  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Continuation</span>, 855). He was admitted at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, on 10 September 1645 and matriculated at Easter 1646, before graduating BA in 1650. On leaving the university he became chaplain to the countess of Chesterfield at Tamworth Castle, Warwickshire, and was then preacher at Elvaston, Derbyshire, before moving to Leicestershire. Nothing is known of Hill's marriage, except that it produced a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13307/', "Thomas Hill")</script>, who founded and led an academy for training ministers at Findern in Derbyshire and who died in March 1720.<br>
<br>Refusing the engagement, the oath of loyalty to the Commonwealth in 1649, Thomas Hill acted as minister at Orton on the Hill from June 1651; the parish lay near where four counties met&#151;Leicestershire (in which it was), Derbyshire, Staffordshire, and Warwickshire. On 16 November 1652, at the meeting of the classis of Wirksworth, Derbyshire, he &#145;produced two certificates, one from his neighbouring ministers concerning his ministerial abilities and godly conversation; the other from the parishioners of Orton on the Hill concerning his title there, they certifying their choice of him to be their minister&#146;; these certificates, his &#145;testimony of the grace of God in him, of his inward call&#146; and of &#145;his competent skill in the original tongues&#146; were all approved by the classis  (Cox, 164&#150;5). But only after attending a second meeting on 21 December 1652, at which he preached a sermon and defended a thesis to the satisfaction of the assembled divines, was Hill accepted as fit for the ministry. He was formally ordained by the Wirksworth classis on 15 March 1653. All this, and his refusal to preach before Cromwell, may suggest that Hill was strongly of a presbyterian persuasion.<br>
<br>In 1660 Hill was not ejected from Orton, but the sequestered vicar was restored in that year and it seems that Hill had moved a few miles to a house at Lea Grange. He was presented by the second earl of Chesterfield to the curacy of the nearby parish of Shuttington, Warwickshire. Here he was allowed rectorial tithes belonging to the earl, and although the <span class="roman">Five Mile Act</span> made it impossible for him to take services he was able to engage a sympathetic Worcestershire minister for the work. Thus, &#145;using prudence, he had an opportunity of exercising his ministry where some others were molested&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Abridgement</span>, 2.746). It may also be that Hill's security was improved by his geographical situation. His old vicarage at Orton on the Hill was in the diocese of Lincoln, his living at Shuttington was under the jurisdiction of the bishop of Worcester, and his own residence at Lea Grange was in Staffordshire in the diocese of Lichfield.<br>
<br>Calamy records of Hill that &#145;his stature was something low, his hair black, his countenance graceful, and acceptable&#146;; he valued the works of Richard Baxter especially, because of the &#145;catholic spirit&#146; of universalism to be found in them; on admission to the university Hill was acknowledged to be already better versed in Hebrew &#145;than many or most of the Tutors&#146;; an &#145;expert linguist&#146; in Latin and Greek, he entertained also a lively interest in philosophy, mathematics, and history  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Continuation</span>, 856, 860). It is clear that Hill shared with many of his persuasion a deeply serious and conscientious approach to his calling, preaching three times on Sunday in all weathers. His inflexibility in this seems to have brought upon him the cold which led to his death at the age of about forty-nine. He was buried at Orton on the Hill on 7 March 1677.<br>
