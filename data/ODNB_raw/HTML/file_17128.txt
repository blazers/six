<span class="headword">Lucas,  Henry</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1587, <em>d.</em> 1663), <span class="occ">founder of the Lucasian professorship of mathematics at Cambridge University</span>, the son of Edward Lucas (<i>bap</i>. 1566, <i>d</i>. 1601) of Thriplow, Cambridgeshire, and his wife, Mary Covert, daughter of Sir Nicholas Heron, was baptized at St Giles Cripplegate, London, on 11 November 1587. Lucas was educated at the village school at Thriplow, and according to his will &#145;receaved &hellip; part of my education&#146; at St John's College, Cambridge, although there is no evidence that he matriculated  (Clark, 165). Lucas also states in his will that his patrimony &#145;was snatched from him by unhappy suits in law during his childhood&#146;. Following the death in 1588 of John Flowerdew, his sister's son, Edward Lucas acquired an executorship in respect of the interests of Flowerdew's son Edward. It was alleged that Edward Lucas abused his trust and after his death legal proceedings resulted in an act of parliament in December 1601 rendering Edward Lucas's estate liable for John Flowerdew's legacies as well as his own debts. Henry Lucas was compelled to seek his own fortune, although he and his mother retained some of the Cambridgeshire property.<br>
<br>Lucas was admitted to the Middle Temple on 6 February 1606 but was not called to the bar until 12 May 1648. His first recorded employment was in 1617, when he acted for the earl and countess of Bedford in matters regarding a lease; in 1618, as one of four agents of Lucy, countess of Bedford, he was responsible for the collection of tolls on coal shipped from the Tyne. In May 1629 Lucas was appointed secretary to Dudley Carleton, Viscount Dorchester and secretary of state. This post resulted in Lucas's meeting Henry Butts, vice-chancellor of Cambridge University. Following the death of Dorchester in 1632, Lucas became secretary to Henry Rich, first earl of Holland, chancellor of Cambridge University. As Holland's secretary Lucas was placed in the profitable position of being able to benefit from receiving favours granted from above and petitions presented from below. In his inaugural lecture as the first holder of the Lucasian professorship, Isaac Barrow claimed that &#145;while he [Lucas] managed the affairs of his patron so well, &hellip; he did not look badly to his own; but stored up some fruit into his own barn, from so plentiful a harvest&#146;.<br>
<br>Lucas was admitted MA of St John's College on 4 February 1636. It was also as a result of being Holland's nominee that he was elected one of the university's representatives in parliament on 24 October 1640. As an MP, Lucas was an influential protector of the university's interests. Holland's support wavered between the Commons and the king until 1648 when he rose in arms for Charles I. Holland was defeated at Nonsuch on 7 July and taken prisoner three days later. In the aftermath of the fiasco, twenty-nine of the earl's attendants including one Henry Lucas surrendered to the Hertfordshire militia and were sent to Peterhouse prison. However, this Lucas appears to have been a different person, as other evidence points to Henry Lucas being busy in the Commons at this time: in August he was named to a committee to adjudge scandalous offences under the terms of the ordinance for the form of church government, and in September he was named to committees considering army pay arrears and the preservation of books and manuscripts. In December he was secluded from parliament at Pride's Purge, and until 1652 was engaged in paying Holland's debts.<br>
<br>According to his will, Lucas concentrated during the 1650s on developing a library of &#145;Bookes of diverse subjects&#146;. Lucas frequently inscribed the books with his name, the year of purchase, and the cost, and in some of the more expensive texts he provided elevated comment in Latin. Following the restoration of Charles II in 1660 he was again identified as responsible for Holland's estate.<br>
<br>Lucas died at his residence in Chancery Lane, London, in July 1663 and was buried in the Temple Church on the 21st of that month.<br>
<br>Lucas's most significant legacy was the establishment of the Lucasian professorship of mathematics at Cambridge University. He instructed his executors to &#145;purchase lands to the value of one hundred pounds by the yeare to be imployed and setled as a yearely stipend and sallerie for a professor and reader of the mathematicall sciences&#146;  (Clark, 165). The professorship was founded in 1663 and was endowed with an estate in Bedfordshire; Isaac Barrow was elected the first professor on 20 February 1664.<br>
<br>Lucas also bequeathed to the university library his collection of &#145;812 bookes in folio, 326 books in Quarto, Octavo, and other small volumes and 29 bundles of several pamphletters&#146;  (draft in CUL archives, graced 12 Sept 1664, Grace book H, 335). His gift of books is comparable with the benefactions provided by the better-documented donations of Richard Holdsworth and John Hacket, bishop of Lichfield. The remainder of Lucas's estate, amounting to about &pound;7000, he bequeathed for the establishment of a hospital in Berkshire or Surrey. The foundation, consisting of a chaplain or master, was intended to assist as many poor people as could be looked after; they were to be selected from the poorest inhabitants of the forest division in Berkshire and the bailiwick of Surrey. The hospital was built in 1665 on Luckley Green, Wokingham, Berkshire, with lands in Bedfordshire being purchased for its endowment. In 1666 Lucas's executors established 15 July as the commemoration day of the Lucas Hospital, suggesting that 15 July may have been the date of his death.<br>
