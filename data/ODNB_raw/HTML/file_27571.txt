<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Tostig</span>, earl of Northumbria  (<em>c.</em>1029&#150;1066), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10887/', "Godwine, earl of Wessex (d. 1053)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56555/', "Gytha")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10887/', "Godwine")</script>]. He had two elder brothers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26831/', "Swein")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12360/', "Harold (later King Harold II)")</script>, and at least four younger ones, &AElig;lfgar, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11826/', "Gyrth")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16473/', "Leofwine")</script>, and Wulfnoth. He also had at least two sisters, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8483/', "Edith")</script> and Gunnhild, and perhaps one more. In 1051 Tostig married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54458/', "Judith of Flanders")</script>, daughter of Baudouin (IV), count of Flanders, and his second wife, Eleanor of Normandy, who was first cousin to Edward the Confessor. The marriage seems to have been contracted during the exile of Tostig's father, Earl Godwine, at the court of Count Baudouin (V) in the autumn of 1051. Although the author of the life of King Edward calls Tostig &#145;earl&#146;, it is the sole direct evidence for his status at his wedding. If he had not yet attained this rank, then the marriage contracted was a considerable coup for the Godwine clan. At Easter 1053 Tostig and his brothers Harold and Gyrth carried their father's body into the king's chamber at Winchester after Godwine had collapsed and died.<br>
<br>Before mid-Lent 1055 Tostig had succeeded Siward as earl of Northumbria and his accession may have earned the Godwine family the enmity of &AElig;lfgar of Mercia, who coveted the earldom for himself. The life of King Edward claims that Tostig was held in special affection by Edward the Confessor and his appointment may have owed much to the combined influence of his elder brother Harold and his sister Queen Edith. Tostig is described as a man of courage, endowed with great wisdom and shrewdness of mind. He was favourably compared with his brother Harold, both being distinctly handsome and graceful, similar in strength and bravery. The life of King Edward goes on to add that Tostig was endowed with very great and prudent restraint, although he tended to be rather overzealous in attacking malefactors. He carefully weighed up situations and once he had decided on a course of action he embarked upon it without discussing matters further with his fellows. Occasionally it seemed that he acted without planning and so caught his opponents unawares. He shared with his brother Harold the ability to disguise his true feelings, thus keeping people guessing as to their intentions. For the biographer of King Edward, Tostig and Harold were the twin pillars upon which peace in England rested.<h2>
<a name="Religiousdiplomaticandmilitaryactivity"></a>Religious, diplomatic, and military activity</h2>Tostig and his wife were well known for their alms giving. During the period of Tostig's rule in Northumbria, they forged close links with the community of St Cuthbert at Durham. The <span class="italic">Libellus de exordio atque procursu istius hoc est Dunelmensis ecclesie</span> of Symeon of Durham (written between 1104 and 1107) describes the gifts they made to St Cuthbert, among which was a crucifix and images of the Virgin and of St John the Evangelist executed in gold and silver, together with many other precious ornaments for the church. Symeon also preserves the story of Judith's desire to worship at Cuthbert's shrine. Owing to an injunction against women entering the precincts of the church, Judith sent one of her maidservants to attempt an entry. On crossing the boundary of the churchyard the girl fell ill and died soon afterwards. It was in order to make amends for her temerity that Judith and Tostig made their gifts to the community. The links with Durham seem to have been close and Bishop &AElig;thelwine provided Judith with some of St Oswine's hair. Judith was famed as a patron of the arts and at least four gospel books have been associated with her. In one of these (New York, Pierpont Morgan Library, Morgan MS 709, fol. 16) she is depicted in a line drawing. It does not seem likely that the community of St Cuthbert led the attack upon Tostig in 1065, as under him it had enjoyed the benefits of his strong rule. Durham tradition also preserved the story of the escape from prison of a certain Aldan-hamal whom the earl had incarcerated for robbery. The thief invoked St Cuthbert's aid, escaped his prison, and claimed sanctuary within the cathedral. One of Tostig's officers, Barcwith, was struck down by the saint for daring to violate the sanctuary. Despite this attack on the church, Tostig and his wife are commemorated in the Durham <span class="italic">Liber vitae</span>.<br>
<br>The author of the life of King Edward suggests that Tostig remained faithful to his wife and that their marriage was chaste. In 1061 they led an embassy to Rome which included Ealdred, archbishop-elect of York, who was journeying there for his pallium. On the outward and return journeys Tostig demonstrated his piety by worshipping at each shrine he came across. Pope Nicholas II (<i>r</i>. 1059&#150;61) received Tostig and his companions honourably and invited the earl to attend a synod, presumably that of Easter (15 April) 1061, called to deal with the problem of simony in the church, at which, it is said, Tostig sat immediately next to the pontiff. During the dispute over Ealdred's election to York, it seems that the earl threatened to withhold the Peter's Pence which he had brought with him from England. Tostig's embassy became embroiled in the local struggle between the Tuscan nobility and the papacy when members of his party were attacked on the via Cassia shortly after leaving for home. The earl had sent Judith and most of his retinue on ahead and they were unaware of what had happened to their fellows. The attackers were led by Gerard, count of Galeria, who was later excommunicated by Pope Nicholas II for this act of aggression. During the attack a certain nobleman, Gospatric, enabled his lord, Tostig, to escape by pretending that he was the earl. The name Gospatric was common in the north in this period and this holder of it cannot be identified with certainty, but it is possible that he was either the post-conquest earl of Northumbria or the Gospatric, son of Uhtred, who was slain on Queen Edith's orders in 1064. On their return to Rome, Tostig and his companions were treated with compassion by the pope, who gave them gifts from the treasury of St Peter, whereupon they departed with the apostolic benediction. The party reached England safely in the autumn of 1061.<br>
<br>During Tostig's absence, Malcolm III of Scotland had attacked the north of England, pillaging Holy Island in particular. It has been suggested that Malcolm timed the raid to coincide with Tostig's journey to Rome so that, apart from the military advantage, he might not break his oath of sworn brotherhood with the earl. The life of King Edward suggests that earlier, perhaps in 1058, the Scots had made raids on Tostig's earldom in order to test him. Tostig had responded by wearing the Scots down by cunning schemes rather than by military campaigns, until Malcolm agreed to serve Tostig and King Edward. Malcolm is said to have given Tostig hostages and it may have been at this time that he became the earl's sworn brother. In 1059 Malcolm was conducted to Edward's court by Tostig, the archbishop of York, and the bishop of Durham, and it seems likely that the agreement was made on this occasion. Some time after his return from Rome, in the last week of May 1063, Tostig invaded north Wales, probably from Chester, in support of his brother Harold's campaign launched from Bristol. The success of the campaign probably induced the Welsh to kill their king, Gruffudd ap Llywelyn, and present his head to Harold and Tostig.<h2>
<a name="Victimofrebellion"></a>Victim of rebellion</h2>Tostig seems to have been a trusted minister of the crown and was at Edward's court in 1065, either hunting with the king or possibly completing a task that Edward had entrusted to him, when revolt broke out in his earldom. Tostig had delegated the government of Northumbria north of the River Tyne to his lieutenant, the Yorkshire thegn Copsi, but their regime seems to have provoked a violent rebellion. According to the life of King Edward, some of the Northumbrian nobles who had suffered under Tostig's rule conspired to bring him down late in 1065, after Michaelmas or perhaps in October. The <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> charges Tostig with robbing churches, depriving men of their lands and lives, and acting against the law. As King Edward promised the rebels that he would restore the laws of Cnut to the north, it may be that Tostig had tried to introduce West Saxon law into the region. John of Worcester suggests that the combination of a great tax levied on the Northumbrians and the murder of the Northumbrian nobles Gamel, son of Orm, and Ulf, son of Dolfin, who were linked to the house of Bamburgh, was at the heart of the revolt. The murder of another Northumbrian noble, Gospatric, at the behest of Queen Edith on 28 December 1064 has also been seen as a contributing factor. It is possible that during the Northumbrian revolt against the Normans in 1069&#150;70, the memory of this murder provoked the earl of Northumbria, who was Gospatric's nephew and namesake, to despoil the gilded cross which Tostig and his wife had presented to the community of St Cuthbert.<br>
<br>On 3 October 1065 the rebels, led by Gamelbearn, Dunstan, son of &AElig;thelnoth, and Glonieorn, son of Heardwulf, who may have been intriguing with Earl Eadwine of Mercia and his brother Morcar, broke into Tostig's residence in York and killed those of his soldiers who did not escape. John of Worcester names two of the victims, the housecarls Amund and Reavenswart, and suggests that some 200 men lost their lives. The rebels then nominated Morcar as their earl, invited his brother Eadwine to join them, and marched south. Anyone associated with Tostig's regime was killed and there was much slaughter both in York and in Lincoln. The life of King Edward sees the revolt as heralding the return of the robber bands that had dominated the north before the imposition of order by earls Siward and Tostig. The rebels marched to Northampton, where they were met by Earl Harold, and then as far as Oxford where, on 28 October 1065, they were met by envoys from King Edward. The rebels demanded the exile of Tostig, charging him with being too cruel in the exercise of his authority and with punishing miscreants more out of a desire to confiscate their property than out of a love of justice. They also demanded that the king accept Morcar as earl of Northumbria. According to the biographer of King Edward, Tostig alleged that his brother Harold had conspired with the rebels against him. Tostig made the accusation in the presence of the king but Harold purged himself with a public oath of exculpation. Edward decided to crush the rebellion, in support of his brother-in-law, but was deserted by Earl Harold and the English thegns, who refused to provoke a civil war. Harold conveyed Edward's acceptance of the rebels' terms and agreed that the laws of Cnut would be re-established in Northumbria.<h2>
<a name="Exilereturnanddeath"></a>Exile, return, and death</h2>This was a pragmatic response to the situation but it marked a final fissure between Harold and his brother. The twelfth-century historian Henry of Huntingdon believed that the rift between Harold and Tostig had occurred shortly after their successful invasion of Wales in 1063. Jealous of his brother's higher place in the king's affections, Tostig went to Hereford, where Harold was preparing a banquet to entertain the king, and had Harold's servants dismembered and served up for the royal guest. Tostig was thus forced into exile along with his wife, Judith, and his lieutenant, Copsi. It may be at this date that the shires of Northampton and Huntingdon were detached from the earldom and granted to Siward's son, Waltheof, who had been denied the earldom of Northumbria in 1055 and now again in 1065. The author of the life of King Edward sees the failure of Edward to reinstate Tostig as marking the beginning of his physical decline. Queen Edith also tried to intervene on her brother's behalf, but in vain. Tostig took leave of his mother and crossed the channel, with his wife and infant children and members of his immediate retinue, after 1 November 1065. According to the life of King Edward the exiles were welcomed by Count Baudouin (V) of Flanders a few days before Christmas and given a house and estate in St Omer, together with the revenues of the town as maintenance. Orderic Vitalis, writing in the early twelfth century, believed that during his exile Earl Tostig had visited Duke William of Normandy in an attempt to forge an alliance against Harold. Similarly Snorri Sturluson's <span class="italic">King Harald's Saga</span>, written at the end of the twelfth century, suggests that Tostig had travelled to Denmark and then Norway in order to enlist the aid of kings Swein and Harald in his attack on England. After Tostig's departure, his brother Harold may have formed an alliance with earls Eadwine and Morcar and began to advance his own claims to the English throne. The enmity between the brothers was not ended by Harold's coronation and Tostig was absent from the ceremony.<br>
<br>Shortly after the appearance of Halley's comet on 24 April 1066, Tostig attempted to recover his place by making raids on England. He attacked the Isle of Wight, taking plunder and provisions before moving along the coast to Thanet, where, according to Gaimar, he was met by Copsi. They attacked &#145;Brunemue&#146; before entering the Humber. Driven out of Lindsey by earls Eadwine and Morcar and deserted by his Flemish allies, Tostig made his way to Scotland. He seems to have joined up with King Harald Hardrada of Norway at the mouth of the River Tyne early in September 1066. The two entered the Humber and by way of the Ouse landed at Riccal. On 20 September they defeated the forces of earls Eadwine and Morcar at Gate Fulford but were themselves defeated and killed by King Harold at Stamford Bridge, on the Derwent, on 25 September. Tostig's lieutenant, Copsi, may have been with his master at the battle, but he survived and was later to hold the earldom under William I. After Tostig's death, his widow, Judith, remained in Flanders until late 1070 or early 1071, when she married Welf (IV), duke of Bavaria.<br>
<br>
<span class="roman">Domesday Book</span> records lands held by Earl Tostig and values them at &pound;492, which ranks him among the wealthiest landholders of Edward's reign. This figure is almost certainly an underestimate, as the survey probably failed to record every instance of the transference of Tostig's manors after his exile. In addition, the northern half of his earldom was not surveyed by the Domesday commissioners. Apart from his estates in the earldom of Northumbria, which seems to have included Nottinghamshire, Tostig held land in the south, mainly in Hampshire, the south-west, and the east midland shires, particularly Northamptonshire and Huntingdonshire.<br>
