<span class="headword">Collignon,  Charles</span>  (1725&#150;1785), <span class="occ">anatomist and physician</span>, born in London on 30 January 1725, was the son of Paul Collignon, a minister of the Dutch church in Austin Friars, London, who was a native of Hesse-Cassel, Germany. He died when his son was still young. After attending school in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, Collignon was admitted a pensioner of Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1743, where he graduated MB in 1748 and MD in 1754. While still a student Collignon visited France, London, Edinburgh, and Leiden, before returning to Cambridge in 1750; in 1751 the university granted him a licence to practise. During the same year he married Elizabeth Vandactselver in Colchester. The marriage produced four children; only <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5923/', "Catherine Collignon (bap. 1754, d. 1832)")</script> survived her father. She translated from the French the Abb&eacute; Ladvocat's <span class="italic">Historical and Biographical Dictionary</span>.<br>
<br>Collignon settled in St Sepulchre's parish, Cambridge, and established himself in practice in the town. He began lecturing in the university in 1754 and was &#145;much esteemed by all his pupils&#146;  (Rook, 341). Collignon emphasized the importance of a knowledge of anatomy for physicians, the desirability of a better legal supply of bodies for dissection, and the importance of post-mortems to improve knowledge of disease. It is said that in March 1768 Laurence Sterne's body turned up in Collignon's dissecting room a few days after it had been buried in London. Collignon's <span class="italic">Compendium anatomico-medicum</span> (1756) provided a general introduction to students of anatomy. This was followed in 1763 by <span class="italic">Tyrocinium anatomicum</span> in which he stated that &#145;the first and principle end of the study of the human body should be to awaken in us an aweful sense of the amazing power of the creator&#146;  (Rook, 342). Collignon's next book, <span class="italic">Enquiry into the structure of the human body relative to its supposed influence on the morals of mankind</span>, was a more philosophical work that intended &#145;to remove the objections that have been made against Providence by some, as if he had formed men of such materials as almost necessarily impelled them to illicit actions&#146;  (Rook, 343).<br>
<br>Collignon became a governor of Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, in 1766 and in September that year he was appointed physician, a post he held until his resignation in 1775. A year after his resignation he published <span class="italic">Explanatory Remarks on the Great Utility of Hospitals for the Sick and Poor</span>, which was unusual in that it argued that those suffering from incurable illnesses, epilepsy, and venereal diseases should not be denied admission into hospitals. Collignon's other works were <span class="italic">Medicinia politica, or, Reflections on the art of physic as inseparably connected with the prosperity of the state</span> (1765) and <span class="italic">Moral and Medical Dialogues</span> (1769); according to Rook, the latter are &#145;so pretentiously elaborated that they are almost unreadable&#146;  (Rook, 343). Collignon was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1770.<br>
<br>The Revd Cole, who knew Collignon well, says of him:<blockquote>He is an ingenious, honest man, and if they had picked the three kingdoms for a proper person to represent an anatomical professor, they could not have pitched upon a more proper one, for he is a perfect skeleton himself, absolutely a walking shadow, nothing but skin and bones; indeed, I never saw so meagre a figure, such as one can conceive a figure to be after the flesh and substance is all dried away and wasted, and nothing left to cover the bones but a shrivelled dry leather; such is the figure of our present professor of anatomy, 19 June 1770. (Rook, 339)</blockquote>Collignon died on 1 October 1785 in Cambridge. A collection of his writings, <span class="italic">The Medical Works of Charles Collignon MD</span>, was published the next year.<br>
