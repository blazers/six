<span class="headword">Norton,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Teyoninhokarawen]</span>  (1770&#150;1831?), <span class="occ">leader of the Mohawk Indians</span>, was born on 16 December 1770 at Crail, Fifeshire, the son of John Norton (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1750, <i>d</i>. before 1809), printer and soldier. His father was most likely a Cherokee from North Carolina who had been adopted by a soldier in 1760 and taken to Scotland. There he became a printer and married a Scottish woman from Salen, Christian Anderson.<br>
<br>The younger John Norton probably grew up in the Crail&#150;Salen&#150;Dunfermline area, then moved to Edinburgh about 1781, either to advance his education or to learn the printing trade. In 1784 he joined the 65th foot. His father enlisted in 1786 and both men were posted to Canada. Norton's mother came with them and worked as a servant. In 1787 Norton deserted from Fort Niagara, but received a discharge in 1788, apparently with the help of his mother's employer. His father deserted in 1789. Norton subsequently lived in the aboriginal&#150;white middle ground of the lower Great Lakes region; learned several Native languages; worked as a schoolteacher, trader, and interpreter; and became &#145;at once as perfect an Indian as ran in the woods, having his ears cut &amp; his nose bored&#146;  (<span class="italic">Missouri Gazette</span>, 15 June 1816).<br>
<br>Norton impressed the Mohawk leader Joseph Brant, who adopted him as his &#145;nephew&#146; about 1798. Shortly afterwards he was given the Mohawk chiefly name Teyoninhokarawen. He settled on the Six Nations Iroquois tract on the Grand River in Upper Canada, became a diplomatic and war chief, and had at least two successive marriages to now unknown aboriginal women with whom he had two children. In July 1813 Norton married again, this time to Karighwaycagh or Catherine (<i>c</i>.1797&#150;1827), who probably was a Delaware.<br>
<br>Norton was active in the pro-British party on the politically-divided Grand, and succeeded Brant as its principal leader when the latter died in 1807. Norton favoured good Anglo-Iroquois relations, but wanted to ensure that the Six Nations Mohawks, Oneidas, Tuscaroras, Onondagas, Cayugas, and Senecas enjoyed as much freedom from unwanted European and American influence as possible, in order to make the transition on their own terms, to plough agriculture from traditional horticultural and forest subsistence patterns. His demand for full Native control over Grand River land in particular annoyed colonial officials, who sought to undermine his authority by claiming that he had no aboriginal ancestry (a view that some modern scholars have accepted). The historical record, however, suggests that Norton was half Cherokee; nevertheless Native origins were not necessary for him to have been adopted as a Mohawk.<br>
<br>Frustrated by internal Grand River politics and by the hostility of government officials, Norton journeyed to England in 1804&#150;5 to seek a commission in the army and to represent Iroquois interests at the imperial centre. He failed on both missions. Yet, because of his interest in promoting Christianity and European and American agricultural practices among the tribes, he was befriended by a number of prominent Quakers and evangelical Anglicans, as well as by the duke of Northumberland. During this visit Norton, an Anglican, translated the gospel of <span class="roman">St John</span> into Mohawk for the British and Foreign Bible Society. He returned to Canada in 1805, and then travelled to Tennessee and neighbouring regions in 1809&#150;10 to visit his Cherokee relatives and honour his father's grave.<br>
<br>When the United States declared war on Britain in 1812, most Grand River people chose to remain neutral, while others favoured an alliance with the Americans. Norton's pro-British party had difficulty mustering support because of long-standing problems in crown&#150;Iroquois relations and because many people assumed the Americans would conquer Canada quickly. However, the king's forces won some unexpected early victories, which helped bring most of the Grand River community into the war on the British side. Norton, with considerable support from the army, worked to recruit warriors and maintain the Iroquois&#150;crown alliance. As &#145;captain of the Confederate Indians&#146; he regularly saw action and proved to be an outstanding combat commander. Perhaps his most important contribution to Canadian defence occurred at Queenston Heights in 1812, where his badly outnumbered warriors helped keep the American army pinned down in a precarious position for several hours until the British could deploy their troops to repel the invaders. However, his political and diplomatic aspirations were frustrated because of both the divisions on the Grand and the animosity of civil officials, especially in the Indian department. Consequently, he retired from public life at the end of the war.<br>
<br>In 1815 Norton and his family sailed to England where he sought preferment (being given the local Canadian rank of major). In Britain, he finished a manuscript he had been working on for a number of years, which now is housed at Alnwick Castle. Although intended for publication, it was not published until 1970, as <span class="italic">The Journal of Major John Norton</span>. It describes his journey to the Cherokee country, recounts his adventures in the Anglo-American War, assesses aboriginal&#150;white issues in the period between 1783 and 1815, and presents a history of the Six Nations based on published European and American, and oral Iroquois, sources. It is a rare and extensive aboriginal-centred document, containing detailed ethnographic information presented by a reliable observer.<br>
<br>Norton returned to Canada in 1816 to farm his land. In 1823 he mortally wounded a man in a duel to protect his wife's honour. After the courts fined him &pound;25 for manslaughter, he left Karighwaycagh and travelled to the Cherokee settlements in Arkansas. He is known to have been in Laredo, then in Mexican territory, in 1825, but afterwards he disappeared. A nephew thought he lived until October 1831.<br>
