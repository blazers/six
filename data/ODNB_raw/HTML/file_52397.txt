<span class="headword">Marvin,  Francis Sydney</span>  (1863&#150;1943), <span class="occ">educationist, positivist, and historian</span>, was born at 11 Finsbury Pavement, London, on 6 August 1863, the son of Francis Bentham Marvin (1831&#150;1919), businessman and churchwarden, and his wife, Julia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Chase (1836&#150;1865). He had a sister, Anna Sophia (1865&#150;1957), who became an educationist in Jamaica. In 1876 his father married Anne Paine, with whom he had a further six sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Marvin grew up in London, where he attended Merchant Taylors' School and made the acquaintance of the leaders of English positivism, including Frederic Harrison and J. H. Bridges. At St John's College, Oxford, where he graduated with a first in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1886) and a second in modern history (1887), he continued to explore positivist thinking. Jointly with his tutor Sidney Ball and fellow classics scholar Gilbert Murray he set up an Auguste Comte discussion society. By the end of his time at St John's his original plan to enter the clergy had faded along with his religious beliefs. With hindsight Marvin commented that he turned to educationism as &#145;the nearest bit of social and religious work&#146; he could think of  (Kunitz and Haycraft, 924). In 1890, after teaching for two years at elementary schools in Oxford and in the East End of London, he embarked on a career as a school inspector with the Board of Education. Through his engagement with the question of how education could make a difference to the problems of modern society he also met his future wife, Edith Mary Deverell [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48586/', "Marvin, Edith Mary (1872&#150;1958)")</script>], likewise a school inspector and an advocate of women's suffrage. They wed at Tetsworth parish church on 25 June 1904, after Edith rejected the idea of a positivist ceremony on the grounds that it emphasized the subordinate role of women. The Marvins had three sons, one of them the financial journalist John Deverell Marvin (1906&#150;1983).<br>
<br>Marvin was an active member of the positivist circle in London, writing many of the Greek and Roman lives in Frederic Harrison's <span class="italic">New Calendar of Great Men</span> (1892) and contributing over a hundred articles to the <span class="italic">Positivist Review</span> between 1893 and 1925. One of the key ideas he appropriated from the Comtean legacy was the vision of historical synthesis as a precondition of future societal advance. His first book, <span class="italic">The Living Past</span> (1913), offered a concise &#145;sketch of Western progress&#146; from the Stone Age to the early nineteenth century. The work passed through several editions and had the widest influence among his writings. H. G. Wells later acknowledged it to have inspired the <span class="italic">Outline of History</span> (1918&#150;19), Wells's own effort to deliver the world from nationalist strife by re-educating it in internationalist perspectives. The principal theme that pervaded <span class="italic">The Living Past</span> was that history manifested social virtue. Marvin portrayed the ascent of man as a story of &#145;the unity of mankind&#146; and its fundamental &#145;sociality of reason&#146;, attributing progress not to individual genius but to man's unique powers of co-operation. In a Comtean reading the truest expression of this type of moral behaviour was ultimately science. Marvin's account of Western progress foregrounded scientific activity, presenting it along with all discovery as an essentially fraternal achievement. Much of this resonated with the programme of a new humanism that was being launched at the time by the positivist founding fathers of the modern historiography of science, Charles Singer in the United Kingdom and George Sarton in the United States.<br>
<br>In addition to his work as an inspector of schools and training colleges, Marvin pursued his ideas on internationalism and the improvement of society in a variety of arenas. From 1914 he organized summer schools for teachers, aptly named the Unity History Schools. The series was mooted on the outbreak of the First World War at a settlement of the Society of Friends and continued until 1939, usually convening in England but on occasion also abroad. The schools drew on the expertise of major scholars and public figures. Over the decades they covered a broad range of themes, spanning art, music, science, and civilization, recent developments in European thought, law, race, world peace, and much else. Marvin became an enthusiastic supporter of the League of Nations, whose foundation he celebrated as a first attempt at a new world order. In 1925&#150;6 his campaigning on behalf of the League of Nations Union took him on a lecture tour of India. Out of this grew <span class="italic">India and the West: a Study in Cooperation</span> (1927). Another of his platforms was the Historical Association, which in this period became the leading organization of history teachers. From 1919 Marvin chaired its propaganda committee (later renamed &#145;development committee&#146;), founding and lecturing to branches of the association for nearly a quarter of a century. A commission on history teaching in schools that had been appointed by the president of the Board of Education (the historian H. A. L. Fisher) provided him with further opportunities to bring his mission to bear on teachers and the school inspectorate. The resulting report, <span class="italic">The Teaching of History</span> (1923), explored how history could be used at the grass roots, to ensure that &#145;science boys&#146; received a liberal education and that no pupil would leave secondary school without learning &#145;something of the history of scientific discovery&#146;. Marvin was not scientifically trained. Nevertheless, the editor of the key science periodical <span class="italic">Nature</span> frequently turned to him for reviews. Here too Marvin's zeal as an improver came to the fore as he used these occasions to interrogate the texts under review for their potential to deliver the lessons of co-operativeness.<br>
<br>Marvin retired from his majesty's inspectorate at the rank of staff inspector in 1924. In 1929&#150;30 he held the chair of modern history at the University of Cairo, Egypt. His literary output included the edited volumes of the Unity History Schools; a sequel to <span class="italic">The Living Past</span>, <span class="italic">The Century of Hope</span> (1919), covering the period 1815&#150;1914; with Florence Melian Stawell, <span class="italic">The Making of the Western Mind</span> (1923); <span class="italic">The Nation at School: a Sketch with Comments</span> (1933), on which he collaborated with his son Alfred Noel Marvin; <span class="italic">Auguste Comte, the Founder of Sociology</span> (1937), in the Chapman and Hall <span class="roman">Modern Sociologists</span> series; <span class="italic">The New Vision of Man</span> (1938); and numerous articles in edited volumes and periodicals. He lived latterly in Welwyn Garden City and died of heart failure on 14 November 1943 at The Limes nursing home, Hadley Green, Barnet, Hertfordshire. He was cremated on 19 November at Golders Green crematorium.<br>
