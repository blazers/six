<span class="headword">Bell, Sir  Francis Henry Dillon</span>  (1851&#150;1936), <span class="occ">lawyer and prime minister of New Zealand</span>, was born in Nelson, New Zealand, on 31 March 1851, the eldest of the six sons (he had one sister) of Sir Francis Dillon Bell (1821/2&#150;1898) and his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1892), who was the daughter of a leading Wellington Jewish merchant, Abraham Hort. Bell senior had been winding up the affairs of the New Zealand Company and was to become a significant politician, administrator, and diplomat. He was descended from the Quaker apologist Robert Barclay of Ury, and was therefore related to Edward Gibbon Wakefield and Elizabeth Fry.<br>
<br>After early years in Lower Hutt, young Harry Bell was educated at the Church of England grammar school in Auckland and between 1864 and 1868 at the High School of Otago (later Otago Boys' High School), where he was dux every year and also became head boy. In 1869 he entered St John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1873, bracketed as eighth senior optime in the mathematical tripos. He worked for a solicitor and was then admitted to the chambers of a family friend, John Gorst. He was called to the bar by the Middle Temple in June 1874, after which he went on a court circuit with John Holker. The following year he returned to New Zealand, where his father had arranged that he enter into legal practice in Wellington under the leading lawyer C. B. Izard. The firm was to evolve into one of New Zealand's leading law practices.<br>
<br>On 24 April 1878, in St John's Church in Christchurch, Bell married Caroline (Carrie) Robinson (1853&#150;1935), the third daughter of the wealthy Cheviot Hills run-holder and legislative councillor William (Ready Money) Robinson. Of their four sons and four daughters, three sons died in tragic circumstances. On his father-in-law's death in 1889 Bell became head trustee for the huge Robinson estate. From 1892, &#145;unexpectedly paving the way for a new era in state land settlement&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNZB</span>), he began negotiating to sell Cheviot Hills to the crown.<br>
<br>Bell's legal impact upon the colony was enormous and varied. In his first year of practice he and others initiated New Zealand law reporting with the <span class="italic">Colonial Law Journal</span>, and he later worked on systematizing and expanding such reporting. He served as crown solicitor in Wellington from 1877 to 1890 and again from 1902 to 1910. He quickly became &#145;a leading light in the Wellington bar&#146;  (Millen, 68) and was made a senior partner in 1886. He twice declined a judgeship in the 1880s, and on Sir Robert Stout's appointment as chief justice in 1899 he became the acknowledged leader of the New Zealand bar.<br>
<br>Bell's pronouncements were lucid and intelligible, and one of his specialties lay in law relating to Maori resources. His conduct of significant appeals to the privy council won praise from lords Haldane and Macnaghten, and eventually he became &#145;famous for his winning record&#146; in the council  (Millen, 140). A founder of the Wellington District Law Society (and president, 1888&#150;9), he went on to be a prime mover in establishing the New Zealand Law Society and then to dominate it as president from 1902 to 1918. He was frequently involved in law reform and in the drafting of new statutes, for which he was renowned, and he was among the first batch of king's counsellors appointed within the country in 1907.<br>
<br>Throughout a busy life Bell engaged in many disparate activities. He headed a number of sporting organizations, including New Zealand's rowing and amateur athletic associations, the New Zealand Rugby Union, and Wellington boating, rugby, racing, and cricket organizations, the last for forty-three years. He was variously a member of the Victoria University council, the first president of the Wellesley Club (from 1891), and consul for Denmark, and later he headed public institutions such as the League of Nations Union. More than six decades of active freemasonry included a spell as grand master in 1894&#150;5.<br>
<br>Bell's political career began in municipal affairs. As mayor of Wellington in 1891&#150;3 and again in 1896&#150;7 he presided over significant initiatives, especially the securing of proper drainage and refuse services; between these years he was also twice a member of the harbour board. Abortive attempts to enter parliament in 1890 and 1892 had been followed by his election in 1893 as member of the house of representatives for Wellington City.<br>
<br>A virulent campaign by the populist tabloid <span class="italic">Fair Play</span> to brand Bell as a fake liberal, essentially dedicated to self-interest, led to a libel case that he won only nominally. This was one of several factors which made political life uncongenial, and he stood down in 1896. An enduring legacy of his term was a close friendship with William Massey. When Massey's conservative Reform ministry took office in 1912 Bell was persuaded not only to accept an appointment to the legislative council but also to be its leader&#151;as well as minister for internal affairs and immigration. He was the first New Zealand-born European to sit respectively in both parliamentary chambers.<br>
<br>Bell had agreed to become a legislative councillor in order to help carry out an election promise he had enjoined upon Reform: to make the second chamber elective, in order to prevent any future progressive government &#145;stacking&#146; it with radicals. Ironically, it took so long to get sufficient nominees to ensure the passage of such a measure through the council that it lapsed amid the negotiations surrounding the formation of the wartime coalition (National) government in 1915. As a long-time councillor, however, he ably guided the chamber in its role as a revising body, frequently detecting anomalies and flaws in legislation sent up by the house of representatives.<br>
<br>Bell's dominating intellect and personality enabled him to exercise great influence within the Reform government of 1912&#150;15 (often referred to as the Massey&#150;Bell regime), the subsequent wartime coalition&#151;which retained him in the immigration portfolio and made him attorney-general in 1918&#151;and the post-war Massey government (1918&#150;25). In the last, in which his attorney-general's portfolio was at various times supplemented by eight other responsibilities, the truism of the times was that Bell was &#145;in regard to all important matters of legislation or Cabinet action, the real power behind the throne&#146;  (<span class="italic">Otago Daily Times</span>, 14 March 1936). Massey often sought his advice, and he was acting prime minister in 1921, 1923, and 1925. With the prime minister's decline in health from late 1924 he was virtually the leader of the dominion, and when Massey died he became the first New Zealand-born prime minister&#151;albeit only between 14 and 30 May 1925. He felt that he was too old to hold the office permanently, despite his party's wishes. However, he served in the ministry of his successor, J. G. Coates, until its fall in late 1928.<br>
<br>During the First World War, with the solicitor-general, Sir John Salmond, Bell drafted much intricate special legislation; after the war he oversaw its dismantling. As first commissioner of state forests (1918&#150;22) he was able to indulge his interests in conservation, minimizing native forest destruction and other timber wastage and establishing a regulated system of state forestry, thus becoming known as &#145;the Father of Forestry&#146; in the country  (Stewart, 195). He negotiated the Rotorua Lakes settlement with Te Arawa in 1922, and in the following year he initiated the rationalization of New Zealand land law.<br>
<br>Bell drafted the legislation for New Zealand's assumption of the League of Nations mandate in Western Samoa, and as minister for external affairs (1923&#150;6) he presided over that responsibility. While he was far more enthusiastic over the league than most of his political colleagues, as his country's representative at its third assembly he attacked the right of the (unelected) permanent mandates' commission to criticize New Zealand's actions in Samoa (in this case, on the matter of indentured Chinese labour). His greatest international commitment was to a British empire led firmly by the mother country, and he consistently opposed the drift of the dominions from Britain.<br>
<br>Bell remained an active legislative councillor until his death, but his later years were focused on his legal work and on external affairs&#151;especially on the promotion of imperial unity, but also on global issues such as the creation of the International Court of Justice at The Hague. It was a fittingly statesmanlike ending to a full politico-legal life. Along the way he had been appointed KCMG in 1915, GCMG in 1923, and a privy councillor in 1926. Lady Bell died on 8 September 1935 and Sir Francis himself on 13 March 1936, at their home, Taumaru, in Lowry Bay, Wellington. He was buried in Karori cemetery after a state funeral.<br>
<br>A Labour parliamentarian had in 1921 acknowledged Bell to be &#145;the uncrowned king of New Zealand&#146; as well as &#145;one of the ablest men in the southern hemisphere&#146;  (<span class="italic">Otago Daily Times</span>, 14 March 1936). He was undoubtedly one of the ablest conservative leaders of a country where conservative leadership has generally been in the ascendancy. Along with some other such politicians he was not afraid to propound liberal views. Hence he gained support in the 1890s from such disparate forces as land reformers, prohibitionists, and suffragist women, and courted unpopularity in the First World War by introducing into the conscription legislation a clause to exempt religious objectors. Indeed he would even&#151;when expounding, say, on welfare&#151;call himself a socialist, although a &#145;tory radical&#146; might be a closer description, and <span class="italic">Fair Play</span> and other commentators would not have gone even that far.<br>
<br>During his long and varied career Bell was highly influential in his country. Politically he was content to remain largely behind the scenes, despite a domineering personality which could veer towards bullying in the face of opposition. &#145;It is difficult to find a parallel to so many-sided a man in New Zealand public life&#146; concluded the author of his biography in <span class="italic">DNZB</span>. Although he left his legacy in a number of significant ways, his relative political self-effacement has meant that his name is now little known.<br>
