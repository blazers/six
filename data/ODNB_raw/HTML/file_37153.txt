<span class="headword">Barker,  Jane</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1652, <em>d.</em> 1732), <span class="occ">poet and novelist</span>, was baptized on 17 May 1652 in Blatherwycke, Northamptonshire, the second of three surviving children of Thomas Barker (<i>d</i>. 1681) and Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Connock (<i>d</i>. 1685?). Thomas, whose family origins are uncertain, may have had a court position during the reign of Charles I as a member of the staff of the keeper of the great seal, for the notice of Jane's death in the St Germain parish register indicates he had been &#145;Secretaire du grand sceau d'Angleterre&#146;  (<span class="italic">Galesia Trilogy</span>, ed. Wilson, xviii). From 1662 he leased the manor at Wilsthorp, Lincolnshire (near Stamford), from the earl of Exeter, bequeathing the leasehold to Jane. On her mother's side the Connocks (or Connochs) were an old Cornish gentry family that produced a number of army officers, including Jane's &#145;cosen&#146; Colonel William Connock, named by the Old Pretender to the Jacobite baronetage in 1732. William Connock was a cousin of Richard Lower, the physiologist. Anne appears to have come from an unlanded and possibly Roman Catholic branch of the family.<br>
<br>Jane grew up in Wilsthorp and was largely self-educated, studying Latin and medicine under the tutelage of her brother Edward (1650&#150;1675), an MA of Christ Church, Oxford, and exchanging verse with other amateur poets, including a group of scholars at St John's College, Cambridge. She moved to London some time after her father's death in 1681 and converted to Catholicism probably during the reign of James II. In a verse autobiography which survives in two manuscripts, she characterizes herself as Fidelia, and the political and theological reasons for her conversion are given in a powerful Drydenesque polemic  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). By June 1689 she had followed the Stuart court into exile at St Germain-en-Laye. In 1704 she returned to England to take up management of the Wilsthorp estate; by the 1710s she had the care of two young grandnieces and in 1717 was involved in a legal dispute over their custody with her niece Mary Staton (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Barker). She returned to France in 1727, taking up residence at the Chancellerie in St Germain. She died there in 1732, a spinster, and was buried on 29 March.<br>
<br>Unheralded in her own time, Barker is one of the most significant figures to emerge in the feminist recovery of early modern women writers. Over a writing career spanning nearly half a century she wrote friendship epistles, odes, satires on affairs of state, religious dialogues from a Catholic perspective, poetry on medical themes, a Jacobite heroic romance entitled <span class="italic">Exilius, or, The Banished Roman</span> (1715), and <span class="italic">The Christian Pilgrimage</span> (1718), a translation of a Lenten devotional manual by F&eacute;nelon. Her most important printed work is a trilogy of partly autobiographical prose fictions&#151;<span class="italic">The amours of Bosvil and Galesia</span> (1713), <span class="italic">A Patch-Work Screen for the Ladies</span> (1723), and <span class="italic">The Lining of the Patch Work Screen</span> (1726)&#151;which tell the story of a woman who slips free of the moorings of ordinary female destiny to &#145;espouse&#146; instead &#145;a Book&#146;  (<span class="italic">Galesia Trilogy</span>, ed. Wilson, 15). The trilogy is remarkable for its psychological subtlety, acute analysis of the difficult position of a learned woman, and sympathetic rendering of the female single life. An unauthorized printing of some of her early coterie verse appeared as part 1 of <span class="italic">Poetical Recreations</span> (1688). A corrected version of this verse appears in the three-part Magdalen manuscript, which includes occasional verse written at St Germain as well as a sequence of pro-Stuart verses presented to the future Pretender in 1701, &#145;Poems Refering to the Times&#146; (Magdalen College, Oxford, MS 343), another copy of which is in the British Library (Add. MS 21621). Barker remained committed to the Stuart cause all her life. A 1718 letter in the British Library shows her supplying information about a proposed invasion to the exiled Jacobite leader, the duke of Ormond  (MS Stowe 232, fol. 93). Among the Stuart papers in the Royal Archives at Windsor Castle is a contribution to the Jacobite effort to canonize James II, a letter of 1730 (?) testifying to the healing powers of the blood of &#145;our holy king&#146;  (SP 208/129).<br>
<br>Although Barker is now recognized as one of the most innovative of the early novelists, her significance resides as much in the shape of her career as in the merits of her fictions. As a coterie and then court poet turned market place novelist, she exemplifies the emergence of female literary professionalism, her long and diverse writing life illustrating the shift from an amateur, court-centred manuscript-based literary system to the market-driven culture of print. She is an important Jacobite imaginative writer as well. Her verse-history &#145;Poems Refering to the Times&#146; is a key Jacobite poetic text of the 1690s, while the later novels offer a sustained Catholic&#150;Jacobite response to the declining fortunes of the Stuarts during the early Hanoverian period.<br>
