<span class="headword">Tobin,  George</span>  (1768&#150;1838), <span class="occ">naval officer and artist</span>, born in Salisbury on 13 December 1768, was the second of eight children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53030/', "James Tobin (1736/7&#150;1817)")</script>, a sugar planter and merchant of Nevis in the West Indies and Bristol, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of another Nevis planter, George Webbe; he was an elder brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27485/', "John Tobin")</script> and a younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58446/', "James Webbe Tobin")</script>. After attending King Edward VI School, Southampton, in May 1780 he entered the navy as a captain's servant on the <i>Namur</i>, in which he took part in the battle of the Saintes in April 1782, before transferring to the <i>Bombay Castle</i>. In February 1785 Tobin joined the <i>Thisbe</i> which sailed for Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he completed his time as midshipman in the <i>Assistance</i> and <i>Leander</i>. Being unemployed on his return to Britain in 1787, he sailed as sixth mate on board the East Indiaman <i>Sulivan</i> to Madras and Whampoa (Huangpu) between the autumn of 1788 and June 1790. After rejoining the navy, in the <i>Tremendous</i>, he was made a lieutenant on 22 November 1790.<br>
<br>In April 1791 Tobin was chosen as third lieutenant of the <i>Providence</i> for William Bligh's second breadfruit voyage. When the expedition's official artist withdrew, Tobin became the principal illustrator for the journey to Otaheite (Tahiti) and the West Indies. His journal of that voyage, now in the Mitchell Library, Sydney, shows he was an interested, witty, and tolerant observer of Tahitian life and the accompanying sketches show a scientific interest in natural history and a romantic vision of landscape. Those from his fifteen days on Australian soil at Adventure Bay are among the first European records of Tasmania. Tobin was always generous about Bligh in later years.<br>
<br>On his return to Britain in August 1793 Tobin was happy to learn that Nelson, related through his wife to Tobin's mother, was no longer able to keep open for him a vacancy as third lieutenant of the <i>Agamemnon</i>. It seemed to Tobin, as a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Marjory, duchess of Atholl, better to be appointed, in November 1793, second lieutenant of the frigate <i>Thetis</i> under the command of Captain Alexander Cochrane. In general Tobin recorded the more eventful moments of his career in his sketches and watercolours and this is true of his service in the <i>Thetis</i>, and in Rear-Admiral George Murray's flagship <i>Resolution</i>, in the Halifax squadron between May 1794 and 1798.<br>
<br>In July 1798 Tobin was appointed commander of the cedar sloop <i>Dasher</i>, in which, having returned home and changed his mind about Nelson's fortune, he tried to get himself posted to the Mediterranean with Nelson. However, Tobin spent the next two years harrying French coastal trade off Brittany before being paid off in October 1801. He was promoted captain on 29 April 1802. On 13 June 1804, still on half pay, he married Dorothy (1767/8&#150;1840), daughter of Captain Gordon Skelly RN, and widow of Major William Duff; they had a daughter, (Eliza) Lucy Hope, and a son, George Webbe. In September 1804, at the request of Rear-Admiral Alexander Cochrane, Tobin was appointed captain of the flagship <i>Northumberland</i>, blockading Ferrol and, later, chasing a French fleet to the West Indies where, in September 1805, he was moved into a 38 gun frigate, the <i>Princess Charlotte</i>. On 5 October 1805, by disguising his ship as a merchantman, Tobin captured the French corvette <i>Cyane</i> off Tobago.<br>
<br>Between 1806 and 1810 the <i>Princess Charlotte</i> operated with the Irish squadron, based in Cork, mainly protecting trade to the West. From April 1811 Tobin acted on occasions as senior officer of the squadron harassing French forces off the north coast of Spain in co-operation with guerrillas before his ship, renamed <i>Andromache</i>, joined the Channel Fleet off Ushant in July 1812. The <i>Andromache</i> was present at the fall of San Sebastian in September 1813 and on 23 October captured the Franco-Batavian frigate <i>La Trave</i> off the Saintes. Having previously acted as senior officer off the Gironde, Tobin returned there in December 1813 and successfully led Rear-Admiral Penrose's squadron in the difficult task, requested by Wellington, of forcing an entry into the Gironde.<br>
<br>When the <i>Andromache</i> was paid off in July 1814, Tobin retired to Teignmouth. On 8 December 1815 he was made a CB. Still contributing to the <i>Naval Chronicle</i>, he continued to sketch and paint naval and local scenes with his fellow painters Thomas Luny and Commander Rowland Mainwaring, the latter of whom had married Tobin's stepdaughter Sophia Henrietta Duff. From July 1830 he commanded the royal yacht <i>Prince Regent</i> until it was sold in August 1836. Having been promoted rear-admiral of the White on 10 January 1837, Tobin died in Teignmouth on 10 April 1838 and was buried there in St Michael's Church ten days later.<br>
