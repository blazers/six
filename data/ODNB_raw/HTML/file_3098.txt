<span class="headword">Boyce,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1732, <em>d.</em> 1793), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and writer</span>, was baptized on 11 September 1732 at St Andrew's, Norwich, the son of John Boyce, brewer, and Abigal. He went to school in Norwich and Scarning, before matriculating at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in 1750. He graduated BA in 1754 and MA in 1767. He was ordained deacon on 2 November 1755, served as curate at Cringleford, near Norwich, and was ordained priest on 29 May 1768. From 1780 until his death he was rector of Great Worlingham, Suffolk, and chaplain to the earl of Suffolk.<br>
<br>Boyce is the author of <span class="italic">Harold</span>, an eighty-six page verse tragedy which was published in 1786 in London by the author at his own expense  (BL, 1344n.29). The play, dedicated to Lady Beauchamp, proctor of Longley Park in Norfolk, was never acted and it would appear from the lack of evidence of any reprints that the tragedy was not a success. A handwritten note on the front-sheet of the British Library copy states that Boyce stopped work on it when he became aware that Richard Cumberland's tragedy on the same subject was in rehearsal at Drury Lane and that the author was &#145;conscious of the inferiority of his own abilities&#146;. <span class="italic">Harold</span> has been described as &#145;dull&#146;  (Genest, 6.8) and the noticeable lack of action in the play (there are no battle scenes) supports the opinion that the tragedy is a vehicle for sentimental moralizing rather than dramatic tension.<br>
<br>The note on the front-sheet of <span class="italic">Harold</span> refers to the author as being a writer of elegies as well as a dramatist. A sample of Boyce's elegies appears in <span class="italic">Thomas Boyce, a Specimen of Elegiac Poetry</span> (1773). In the &#145;Advertisement&#146;, the poet states: &#145;These two Poems are selected, merely as being the most correct, from a small number written in the same manner&#146;, and he claims that further publication would be dependent on the &#145;opinion of the Public upon this Specimen&#146; as to &#145;whether the others merit further trouble or attention&#146;. It would appear that the opinion of the &#145;Public&#146; was not favourable as no more elegies were published. The two elegies in the collection are written in heroic couplets and, although technically correct, are conventional and sentimental. &#145;Elegiac I: On the Death of a Young Lady&#146; praises &#145;Chloe&#146;, described as a &#145;milk-white Fawn&#146; who gaily &#145;frisks and frolics round&#146;. &#145;Elegiac II&#146; concerns a lament for &#145;the natural Daughter of a Field Officer who fell in the course of the late War&#146;. Its theme is the seduction of a young innocent country maid by the &#145;arts of a Villain&#146; who quickly abandons her. Boyce died on 4 February 1793.<br>
