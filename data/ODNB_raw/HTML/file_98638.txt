<span class="headword">Corner,  Beryl Dorothy</span>  (1910&#150;2007), <span class="occ">paediatrician</span>, was born at 7 Waterford Road, Westbury-on-Trym, Bristol, on 9 December 1910, the eldest of three children of Edward Graham Corner (1881&#150;1952), a clerk in the port of Bristol authority, and his wife, Cicely Rose, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Menzies (1885&#150;1976). She won a scholarship to Redland High School for Girls, then became a prize-winning medical student at the London School of Medicine for Women at the Royal Free Hospital, where she qualified in 1934 and sailed through her higher medical exams in 1936. It was during her student years that her interest in paediatrics took hold, when she attended ward rounds at Great Ormond Street Hospital and was taught by Robert Hutchison. After house officer posts at the Royal Free and the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital the realistic option for her, as a woman doctor, was to try to obtain a post in general practice or in public health. She was all set to join a general practice in Bristol when a surgeon friend of the family suggested that she apply for a vacant post as resident medical officer at the Bristol Children's Hospital.<br>
<br>Paediatrics was only just beginning to be developed as a speciality separate from adult medicine and, contrary to the view of the professor of medicine at Bristol, Corner became convinced of the need for doctors who specialized in the care of children and were based at the Children's Hospital rather than adult physicians who dropped in to do rounds. Seeking further training in paediatrics she found she could not apply to Great Ormond Street Hospital, which had an official policy of not employing women house physicians. She applied for a post as registrar at the Westminster Children's Hospital only to be told in a letter from Donald Paterson, consultant paediatrician and secretary of the British Paediatric Association, that although she was the outstanding candidate they could not appoint her because she was a woman. Eventually she obtained a post at the Brompton Hospital before returning to Bristol, where she was appointed honorary physician to the outpatients in 1937 and became one of the first full-time paediatricians in the UK, surviving with money from lecturing to nurses and some private practice.<br>
<br>Seeing the need to improve the care of newborn babies Corner ventured onto the maternity wards at Bristol, but was told by the obstetricians that her presence was not welcome. She simply ignored this instruction and set about improving the medical and nursing care of babies, which almost certainly was a major factor in reducing perinatal mortality in Bristol. With the support of the medical officer of health, appointed consultant paediatrician in 1942, and influenced by the work of Julius Hess in the USA and Mary Crosse in Birmingham, she went on to set up the special care baby unit at Southmead Hospital, which opened in 1946, gained an international reputation, and provided the example and stimulus for many other units in the UK. She was a founder member of the Neonatal Society and became an adviser to the World Health Organization in neonatology. Among a wider public she reached worldwide attention for the successful care of the Good sisters (the first quadruplets in the world all to survive a birth by caesarean section) in 1948, and in 2006 gained fame through the BBC 2 programme <span class="italic">Beryl's Babies</span>, about her pioneering work as a paediatrician.<br>
<br>Between 1942 and 1947 Corner was the only paediatrician in the south-west of England. She was an enthusiastic teacher, and as well as lecturing to nurses she started one of the first courses in the UK in paediatric medicine for medical students. She published many research papers and was one of the first to use exchange transfusion to prevent brain injury due to jaundice in premature babies, was innovative in introducing a breast-milk bank, employed outreach neonatal nurses to help with the care of premature babies after discharge from hospital, and wrote a widely read book, <span class="italic">Prematurity</span> (1960).<br>
<br>Corner made a tactical decision to try not to be seen as a campaigning feminist but was very supportive of women doctors who came to her for help with problems of discrimination. She waited until 1954 before she joined the Medical Women's Federation, at which time both she, and perhaps the federation itself, had become a part of the medical establishment. She later became its president. Her achievements and those of other women who were pioneering paediatricians brought into focus the inequity of barring women from the male bastions of medicine, and in 1945 she and four other distinguished women paediatricians were finally allowed to become members of their own professional body, the British Paediatric Association.<br>
<br>Short of stature and given to travelling at speed around Bristol in a large white Mercedes which could at first sight seem driverless until it passed by and her distinctive profile was revealed behind the wheel, Beryl Corner had an unforgettable personality. Sociable and charming with friends and colleagues, loyal and supportive to her extended family, helpful to young paediatricians who showed commitment, she had no hesitation in showing disapproval at work, with her ire typically directed at everyone on a ward-round including the innocent, and there were occasions when her handbag was swung and made contact. None of this was personal and the anger disappeared as quickly as the morning dew. Most of those who worked for her came to regard her with great affection and respect. Among parents there were many who were devoted to her and welcomed her certainty and authority, but there were some, including the mother of the Good sisters, who were upset by what they perceived as a failure to respect their views.<br>
<br>Corner enjoyed conversation, taking centre stage whether in a small group, in a medical meeting, or with parents. She was less comfortable in a purely listening role. She was an accomplished amateur musician, made contributions to the study of medical history, and became &#145;paediatrician&#146; to the Bristol Zoo, where she was an innovator in the care of sick newborn primates. On at least one occasion she admitted a sick primate into an incubator alongside the babies in the neonatal unit. She was a committed Christian and an active member of Christ Church, Clifton. Appointed OBE in 2006, she kept her sharp intellect until her death from a stroke in Southmead Hospital, Bristol, on 4 March 2007. She was unmarried.<br>
