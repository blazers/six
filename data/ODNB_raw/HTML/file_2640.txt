<span class="headword">Gardiner <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Power; <em>other married name </em>Farmer]</span>,  Marguerite <span class="st"> [Margaret]</span></span>, countess of Blessington  (1789&#150;1849), <span class="occ">author</span>, was born on 1 September 1789 at Knockbrit, near Clonmel, co. Tipperary, Ireland, the second daughter and third of the six children of Edmund Power (1767&#150;1837), a small Roman Catholic landowner, and Ellen, daughter of Edmund Sheehy, whose family was excessively proud of its very old Roman Catholic ancestry. As a girl Margaret was chiefly noticeable as the one plain member in a singularly handsome family. Feeling out of place among her boisterous, handsome siblings, Margaret was miserable until Miss Anne Dwyer, a kind-hearted neighbour, a spinster, and friend of her mother's, took pity on her and taught her reading and the love of story-telling. When she was eight, her father moved his family to Clonmel, where he was appointed magistrate, both in Waterford and Tipperary.<br>
<br>In 1804 Margaret, then only fourteen and a half, was proposed to by two officers of the 47th regiment of foot, then stationed at Clonmel. Her parents forced her to marry one of them, Captain Maurice St Leger Farmer (<i>d</i>. 1817) of Poplar Hall and Laurel Grove, co. Kildare, a man who indulged in such ungovernable outbursts of passion as to suggest insanity. They were married in the parish church of Clonmel in the United Church of England and Ireland on 7 March 1804. Three months later Margaret refused to accompany her husband when he was ordered to join his regiment, and she returned to her father's house at Clonmel. Because of a serious argument with his colonel, Captain Farmer soon sold his commission and went to India, ending his relationship with Margaret. He returned from India in 1816 and was killed during a drunken orgy in a fall from a window in the king's bench prison on 21 October 1817.<br>
<br>After she left her husband Margaret stayed for almost three years with her parents, who treated her as an unwanted stranger; in 1807 she moved to Cahir and then in 1809 to Dublin. In that year she formed a close relationship with Captain Thomas Jenkins, an officer in the 11th light dragoons, and began a five-year residence with him in Hampshire. The ugly duckling had by now turned into a swan, whose beauty had become so well known that her portrait was painted by Sir Thomas Lawrence. It was also during this time that she met Charles John Gardiner, second Viscount Mountjoy and first earl of Blessington (1782&#150;1829). With the approval of Jenkins, who received &pound;10,000 from Lord Blessington as a reimbursement for the jewels and clothing that he had purchased for Margaret, and only four months after the death of her first husband, she married Gardiner. He was a widower seven years her senior with four children, two legitimate. The wedding took place at a church in Bryanston Square on 16 February 1818. On her marriage she changed both her birth name and surname: Margaret Farmer became Marguerite, countess of Blessington. Gardiner drew on his annual income of &pound;30,000 from his estates in Ireland and spent lavishly on his bride. After honeymooning in Ireland, the couple settled at a newly leased town mansion at 11 St James's Square. This soon became a centre of social attraction, with its spacious drawing-rooms and splendid furnishings, excellent food and wine, its famous guests, such as Thomas Moore and John Galt, the writers, and William Jerdan, editor of the influential <span class="italic">Literary Gazette</span>, and its beautiful and witty hostess. When Lawrence's portrait of her was shown at the Royal Academy in 1821, P. G. Patmore, father of Coventry Patmore, wrote:<blockquote>I have seen no other so striking instance of the inferiority of art to nature as in this celebrated portrait of Lady Blessington. As the original stood before it, she fairly &#145;killed&#146; the copy, and this no less in the individual details than in the general effect. (Sadleir, 41)</blockquote>The famous classical scholar Dr Samuel Parr was the first to attribute to her the &#145;most gorgeous&#146; appellation  (ibid., 40). In autumn 1821, at one of her soir&eacute;es, Lady Blessington met the twenty-year-old Alfred, Count D'Orsay [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7844/', "D'Orsay, G&#233;d&#233;on Gaspard Alfred de Grimaud")</script>], reputedly the handsomest man of his time, who was later fictionalized in Clyde Fitch's 1902 play <span class="italic">Last of the Dandies</span>. From the date of that meeting until her death Count D'Orsay became closely associated with Lady Blessington.<br>
<br>Early in 1822 Lady Blessington published anonymously her first work, <span class="italic">The Magic Lantern, or, Sketches of Scenes in the Metropolis</span>, four essays about her attendance at an auction, at the Italian opera, a visit to the Egyptian tomb, and a walk in Hyde Park. In that year she also published <span class="italic">Sketches and Fragments</span> and <span class="italic">Journal of a Tour through the Netherlands to Paris in 1821</span>.<br>
<br>On 25 August 1822 the Blessingtons&#151;accompanied by Marguerite's youngest sister, the twenty-one-year-old Mary Anne, and servants&#151;started on a continental tour, meeting D'Orsay in Avignon on 20 November. The Blessingtons settled on 31 March 1823 in Genoa, where they met Lord Byron, whom they saw daily for approximately two months. From their conversations Lady Blessington gathered material for her most famous book, <span class="italic">Journal of Conversations with Lord Byron</span>, which she published in one volume eleven years later, after initially publishing it in instalments in the <span class="italic">New Monthly Magazine</span> from July 1832 to December 1833. The last meeting between Lord Byron and Lady Blessington was on 2 June, at which they exchanged gifts. He gave her an Armenian grammar with his annotations, and she gave him a ring from her finger. Touched by this personal gift, Lord Byron impulsively presented to Lady Blessington a small cameo pin of Napoleon that he treasured; he regretted the gesture, however, and sent a letter the next day requesting its return. The Blessingtons remained in Italy for over another five years, settling for the most part in Naples but spending time in Florence with their friend Walter Savage Landor, whose <span class="italic">Imaginary Conversations</span> Lady Blessington greatly admired. It was there on 1 December 1827 that Count D'Orsay married Lord Blessington's fifteen-year-old daughter Harriet, thus strengthening the tie between the count and Lady Blessington. After moving to Paris towards the end of 1828, the Blessingtons and the D'Orsays took up their residence in the H&ocirc;tel Mar&eacute;chal Ney, where the earl of Blessington died suddenly from a stroke of apoplexy on 25 May 1829, aged forty-six.<br>
<br>In November 1830 Marguerite, along with her sister Mary Anne and Count and Countess D'Orsay, returned to London, subletting the mansion in St James's Square, which would revert to Lord Blessington's family at the expiration of the present lease, and renting a house in Seamore Place, Park Lane. Here she resumed her old social pre-eminence, gathering around her a court of many of the most distinguished literary men of the time, such as Edward Bulwer-Lytton, John Forster, Benjamin Disraeli, Charles Dickens, and the American journalist Nathaniel Parker Willis, whose detailed and extravagant descriptions of Lady Blessington in his <span class="italic">Pencillings by the Way</span> (1835) praised her wit, her beauty, her maturity, and her intelligence. To him she was &#145;one of the most lovely and fascinating women I have ever seen&#146;  (Sadleir, 200). On her husband's death Lady Blessington's income was restricted to her jointure of &pound;2000 a year. Besides living expensively, she had many members of her own family dependent on her. In order to supplement her income she returned to writing, publishing her first three-volume novel, <span class="italic">The Repealers</span> (1833), retitled <span class="italic">Grace Cassidy, or, The Repealers</span> in its second edition (1834), and contributing articles, verse, and fiction to periodicals and magazines. She started to edit <span class="italic">The Book of Beauty</span>, an annual gift-book, for which she continued as editor and contributor until 1849, and in 1841 she started the editorship of another annual, <span class="italic">The Keepsake</span>. Other three-volume novels and non-fiction works followed in quick succession. These included <span class="italic">The Victims of Society</span> (1837), <span class="italic">The Governess</span> (1839), one of the earliest Victorian novels dealing with this much discussed subject, <span class="italic">The Lottery of Life and Other Tales</span> (1842), <span class="italic">The Memoirs of a Femme de chambre</span> (1846), <span class="italic">Lionel Deerhurst, or, Fashionable Life under the Regency</span> (&#145;edited by her&#146;, 1846), and the four-volume <span class="italic">Strathern, or, Life at Home or Abroad</span>. Although only 400 copies of this last mentioned novel were sold, she realized nearly &pound;600 since it had first appeared as a serial in the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>. Lady Blessington's novels fall within the fashionable or &#145;silver-fork&#146; school, whose heyday had passed before she began her writings. Not very imaginative, her novels, however, had occasional realistic details of the mundane and domestic duties and conditions of the 1830s: she had a &#145;good visual sense&#146;  (Jenkins, 170).<br>
<br>Among her non-fiction works the most popular ones were her three-volume <span class="italic">Idler in Italy</span> (1839&#150;40) and the two-volume <span class="italic">Idler in France</span> (1841), books containing reminiscences of her sojourn in those countries, bits of gossip, and clever anecdotes. In 1838 an American publisher in Philadelphia issued a two-volume <span class="italic">The Works of Lady Blessington</span> containing her novels written to that date, her <span class="italic">Conversations with Lord Byron</span>, and items that she had published in the annuals. Her literary legacy lies with her <span class="italic">Conversations with Lord Byron</span>, which has became a major nineteenth-century source for later biographers of Lord Byron, being praised for its grasp of the complex Byron and being valuable for its gossipy record of Byron's opinions of many of his intimates.<br>
<br>In 1836 Lady Blessington's lease at Seamore Place expired, and she moved to Gore House, Kensington, where for the next thirteen years she gathered around her the most distinguished men of intellect. Although her writings earned her between &pound;2000 and &pound;3000 a year, she suffered financial problems. In 1845 the potato disease seriously affected her jointure; after rapidly dwindling, it disappeared in 1848. Her annual expenditure at Gore House exceeded &pound;4000. In April 1849 to escape their creditors she and Count D'Orsay, whose wife had left him in 1831, fled to Paris, he on 1 April and she on 14 April. She rented a small apartment in the rue du Cirque, near the Champs Elys&eacute;es. Not quite two months later, on 4 June 1849, Lady Blessington died aged fifty-nine from an apoplectic seizure, complicated by heart disease. She was buried at Chambourcy, near St Germain-en-Laye, the residence of her long-time friends the duke and duchess de Grammont. D'Orsay erected as a mausoleum a massive granite pyramid containing two stone sarcophagi placed side by side. A little over three years later D'Orsay joined her in the mausoleum at his death on 4 August 1852 at the age of fifty.<br>
