<span class="headword">Ballard,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1586), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest</span>, was the son of William Ballard of Wratting, probably in Cambridgeshire, since he was said to be of the Ely diocese. He was educated at Elmdon, Essex, and Cambridge University. After matriculation at St Catharine's College at Michaelmas 1569 he was admitted to Gonville and Caius College on 18 January 1570 and proceeded BA from King's College in 1574&#150;5. He went to Rheims on 29 November 1579, was ordained priest at Ch&acirc;lons on 4 March 1581, and was sent to England on 29 March.<br>
<br>To protect his identity in England, Ballard used the aliases of Thompson, Turner, and Captain Foscue or Fortescue. At the Red Lion, Holborn, over Christmas 1582 he converted John Hambley. He also visited the Gatehouse prison at this time and befriended <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27950/', "Anthony Tyrrell")</script>, an association which was to lead him to notoriety and execution for involvement in the alleged Babington conspiracy against Elizabeth. Tyrrell escaped from the Gatehouse before 5 January 1582 and was in Ballard's company in several counties until 1584, when they left England for Rome, arriving on 7 September 1584. At Christmas 1584 they crossed together from Rouen to Southampton.<br>
<br>From now the story becomes complex. Catholics who were taken to be in sympathy with Spain were closely pursued by the government. English Catholic priests fell into various categories. The majority eschewed politics and avoided contact with a government which they suspected to be interested only in their extermination. On the continent some, especially the Jesuits, accepted the support of Spain to the point where they actively supported attempts at invasion from 1582 onwards. A small minority abandoned Catholicism and became undercover agents of the government, co-operating actively in the persecution of former brethren. Another group of priests, rather larger, became convinced as the 1580s advanced that any attempt at a forceful answer to their plight was doomed to failure. The only hope for papists was to throw themselves on the mercy of government, proving their loyalty to the regime by informing on their brethren. Ballard and Tyrrell belonged to this group. Theirs was a dangerous game since, while the government was prepared to use them, it was also prepared to destroy them if <i>raison d'&eacute;tat</i> demanded it.<br>
<br>The key man in the story of the 1586 Babington plot was a renegade cleric, Gilbert Gifford. He served Francis Walsingham, who held in his hand all the threads of a conspiracy which was supposed to have been hatched in Rome by Ballard and Tyrrell. They had gone there in 1584 with the express purpose of getting Pope Gregory XIII's approval for a plot to assassinate Elizabeth. Gregory might have been willing, but the Jesuit Alfonso Agazzari, rector of the English College, was not. While political theory since the days of John of Salisbury allowed tyrannicide as a last resort, the Jesuits, including Persons, rejected it as practical politics. In any case, the only &#145;evidence&#146; was a confession made by Tyrrell which he afterwards repudiated as a fabrication: extracted from him no doubt under the threat of torture.<br>
<br>Tyrrell was arrested in London on 4 July 1586 and put in the Counter, Wood Street, where he made the confession implicating Ballard and other Catholics. In May 1586 Ballard went to Paris to contact Charles Paget, the Spanish ambassador, and other friends of Mary, queen of Scots. Hoping, no doubt, to become her regular channel of communication, he brought back with him letters for the queen. He was arrested on his return from France and sent to join Tyrrell in his prison on 4 August 1586. On 15 August he was put in the Tower and severely racked. Only a confession of guilt in a general way was obtained, no doubt for the good reason that he knew nothing himself of anything more specific that he was supposed to have done. The trial of Ballard, Babington, and five more took place on 13 and 14 September 1586. They were all found guilty. Fourteen were executed by hanging, drawing, and quartering at Tyburn; Ballard was the first of the first batch who died more barbarously on 20 September. The queen allegedly insisted on special cruelty, which, proving counter-productive, was mitigated for the second contingent. So ended the life of a man who<blockquote>came in a grey cloak laid on with gold lace, in velvet hose, a cut satin doublet, a fair hat of the newest fashion, the band being set with silver buttons; a man and a boy after him, and his name, Captain Fortescue. (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 1.1150)</blockquote>
