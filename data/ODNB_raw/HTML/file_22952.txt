<span class="headword">Quick,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1636, <em>d.</em> 1706), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was born at Plymouth and baptized at St Andrew's Church, Plymouth, on 19 June 1636, the son of Thomas Quick and his wife, Ann (<i>bap</i>. 1608), who was probably the daughter of John Hunt. He had one brother, Philip, who died at the age of twenty-five. John entered Exeter College, Oxford, as a servitor in 1653, matriculating on 20 July 1654. Both the rector of Exeter College, John Conant, and Quick's tutor, John Saunders, were strong puritans and Quick was undoubtedly influenced by the prevailing climate in the university and the country. He graduated BA in 1657 and began preaching shortly afterwards at Ermington, Devon. He was ordained on 2 February 1659 at Plymouth, having been already presented by the corporation of Exeter on 3 November 1658 to the vicarage of Kingsbridge-with-Churchstow, Devon, for which he undertook to pay &pound;4 yearly to the sequestered vicar Robert Sparke.<br>
<br>Following the Restoration in 1660, Quick was ejected; he then acquired the curacy of Brixton, Devon, but was again ejected when the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> came into force in August 1662. He resumed preaching, however, when no one was appointed in his place, and on Sunday 13 December 1663, while preaching his morning sermon, he was arrested following action by Bishop Seth Ward. As Ward wrote on 19 December:<blockquote>my diocese had not one outed presbyter who dared to preach publicly for these 12 months past (at least wch I have heard of). Till a while since, one Quick, ejected out of Brixton, undertook boldly to preach there. I did what I was obliged to do, and he is now prisoner &hellip; in the Castle of Exon, to wch he was brought this week &hellip; He saith that after his removal, he stayed some months, to see whether any other would supply his place, but at length finding that no man was put in his stead and that the people went off, some to atheism and debauchery, others to Sectarism (for he is a Presbyterian) he resolved to adventure to gather his flock again &hellip; And he had gathered as I am told a flock of 1500 or 2000 upon Sunday last when &hellip; he was taken from the pulpit and brought away. (<span class="italic">Calamy rev.</span>)</blockquote>The justices accepted Quick's counsel's contention that the indictment was flawed and of no legal force, but Quick would not enter into sureties for good behaviour, nor promise to give up preaching. He was sentenced to gaol for three months and a day. Ward then had him prosecuted for preaching to his fellow prisoners, but he was acquitted. At Devon assizes in March 1664 Quick was released and bound in &pound;40 and two sureties to prosecute his traverse; according to Edmund Calamy, though suffering from consumption at the time of his imprisonment he had &#145;perfectly recovered when he came out&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Abridgement</span>, 2.247). At an unknown date Quick married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1708), daughter of Colonel George Cook, of Essex, and Mary Glover, descended from Robert Glover, the Marian martyr; they had at least three daughters.<br>
<br>On 11 April 1672 Quick was licensed to preach in Plymouth but the following year he was imprisoned with other nonconformist preachers there. On release he moved to London and took charge of a congregation in Bridge Street, Covent Garden, but on 16 October 1680 he was appointed pastor of the English church at Middleburg in the Netherlands, where he settled on 5 January 1681. However, he ran into trouble with the Zeeland authorities for his refusal to administer the sacraments according to Dutch forms. On 27 April he announced to the consistory that he intended to accept a position as chaplain to the countess of Donegal, and on 23 May he gave them leave to elect his successor. Quick left Middleburg on 6 July 1681 and was back in London by 22 July. There he gathered a presbyterian congregation in a small meeting-house in Middlesex Court, Smithfield, which abutted the church of St Bartholomew-the-Great, and even afforded a view into it. Quick was fined and imprisoned in 1682, but in 1687 he was one of those who took advantage of James I's declaration of indulgence, and was apparently not further troubled in his ministry at Smithfield. He was certified as a preacher there in 1689.<br>
<br>Quick also maintained contact with the west country for many years. On 10 August 1681 he preached the funeral sermon for Philip Harris of Alston in Devon, and in May 1699 he was present at the Exeter assembly of ministers. His west-country connections may explain his interest in French protestantism, Plymouth being home to an important Huguenot community after 1680; he wrote a substantial two-volume work on French protestantism, <span class="italic">Synodicon in Gallia reformata</span> (1692), and in 1700 made arrangements to publish a three-volume work, &#145;Icones sacrae Anglicanae&#146;, containing accounts of many French and English divines, but was too ill to collect the necessary subscriptions. From about this time onwards &#145;His bodily pains by the stone were frequent for six years, and scarce tolerable for the last three&#146;  (Williams, 34).<br>
<br>John Quick died on 29 April 1706 in London. Funeral sermons were preached by his successor, Thomas Freke, and by Daniel Williams, who recalled that &#145;Though his temper was sudden, he was a very tender relation, exceeding compassionate to the distressed&#146;  (Williams, 36). Quick left money to two French refugee ministers and to the poor of the French church in London, but his most important bequest was the manuscript of &#145;Icones&#146;, now at Dr Williams's Library, Gordon Square, London, a valuable source for west-country nonconformity and used by Calamy for seven of his lives of ejected ministers. Quick was survived by his wife, who died in 1708, and one of his daughters, Elizabeth.<br>
