<span class="headword">Pierrepont,  Robert</span>, first earl of Kingston upon Hull  (1584&#150;1643), <span class="occ">landowner and royalist army officer</span>, was born on 6 August 1584, the son of Sir Henry Pierrepont (1546&#150;1616) of Holme Pierrepont, Nottinghamshire, and his wife, Frances Cavendish, daughter of Sir William Cavendish of Chatsworth. Pierrepont matriculated from Oriel College, Oxford, in 1596 but did not graduate, and was admitted to Gray's Inn in 1600. His marriage in 1601 to Gertrude Talbot (1587/8&#150;1649), the daughter and coheir of Henry Talbot, maintained the Pierrepont family's association with their patron, Gilbert Talbot, seventh earl of Shrewsbury, for his wife was a niece, and Robert himself a nephew, of the earl.<br>
<br>When Pierrepont was elected for Nottinghamshire in 1601 he was just seventeen and his youth underlined that he was Shrewsbury's nominee. As befitted a teenager he played an insignificant part in the proceedings of the Commons. It was not until October 1608 that Robert joined his father as a justice of the peace at a meeting of the Nottinghamshire quarter sessions. Pierrepont attended on average two meetings of quarter sessions each year until his elevation to the peerage, after which he became an occasional attender. He acted with his father as a subsidy commissioner in 1610 and in 1614 was appointed to collect the benevolence in Nottinghamshire. Pierrepont later claimed that a third of the money returned upon the benevolence was due to his efforts but neither this claim nor the amount collected can be established. The privy council considered the work of the Nottinghamshire commissioners so unsatisfactory that they were ordered in November 1614 to appear and explain their performance, but illness prevented Pierrepont from attending. If his appointment as sheriff of Nottinghamshire in November 1615 was a punishment for his performance it was the only penalty he received. Pierrepont was again appointed to raise a benevolence in 1622 and 1626. In Nottinghamshire, as elsewhere, the disappointing response to the latter led the crown to raise a forced loan. Pierrepont again served as a Nottinghamshire commissioner, but its success was largely due to the leadership and determination of the earl of Newcastle.<br>
<br>It was the management and increase of his estates which was Pierrepont's main and constant concern. He inherited properties in the south of Nottinghamshire in the vicinity of the family seat at Holme Pierrepont and in the north-west of the shire and adjoining parts of Derbyshire around their second residence at Hodsock. At first Pierrepont's purchases were in south Nottinghamshire until the acquisition of Fledborough in 1621 in the north-east of the shire opened a new area of interest. He also bought with his son William manors in Derbyshire, Lincolnshire, and Yorkshire. The total cost of his purchases, which can be established from 1610, was &pound;56,171, of which &pound;40,071 was spent on the acquisition of lands in Nottinghamshire. The absence of a sequence of rentals and Pierrepont's accounts means that his income and its use cannot be established in even the broadest terms. From contemporary comments it appears that most of his income was used to purchase land. When Lord Capell visited Pierrepont he was entertained by him &#145;as well as the ill accommodations in his house and his manner of living would admit&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 2.332). His neighbour, later the duke of Newcastle, accepted that because of his many purchases he was not a &#145;monied man&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/55/26). At his death Kingston was the largest landowner in Nottinghamshire.<br>
<br>It was not until 1627 that Pierrepont joined other leading Nottinghamshire families in the purchase of honour. In February Newcastle reported that Pierrepont would not buy a barony as there were so many but would consider a viscountcy. On 29 June 1627 he was created Baron Pierrepont of Holme Pierrepont and Viscount Newark. In the next year Newcastle again acted as the broker and after Pierrepont had expressed his willingness to make a further purchase he was elevated in July 1628 to the earldom of Kingston upon Hull. Though the cost of peerages cannot be established it is clear from Newcastle's correspondence that these were essentially financial transactions.<br>
<br>On 25 April 1628 Pierrepont, as Viscount Newark, took his seat in the House of Lords. He was appointed to only one committee and is not reported to have spoken in debates. His main concern characteristically was to defend his remainder to the estates of the earl of Devonshire. In June 1628 Pierrepont and his wife were included in the list of recusants presented to the Commons. Pierrepont was vulnerable to such accusations: his father, Henry, had helped the Jesuits, he was not well reported of for religion, and an unsuccessful attempt had been made to remove him from the commission of the peace for recusancy. In July 1626 his mother, who had been noted as a recusant, heard divine service in the presence of the archbishop of York and took the statutory oaths. Pierrepont, who presented a certificate to this effect to the Nottingham quarter sessions, was trying to clear his family of these charges and there is no evidence that he had recusant sympathies.<br>
<br>In the 1630s Kingston was heavily fined for illegal enclosures and joined the Nottinghamshire landowners in their preparations to fight any attempt by the crown to extend the boundaries of Sherwood Forest. His letters in these years show that his interests remained his estates and country pursuits, with a constant concern about his health. In 1639 he excused his failure to join the king at York with a plea of ill health, and he was frequently absent from the House of Lords in the years 1640&#150;42. Apart from negotiating with the Nottinghamshire &eacute;lite to secure his son Francis's nomination for East Retford at the Short Parliament, Kingston played an insignificant part in Nottinghamshire politics before the outbreak of the civil war [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/94585/', "Pierrepoint, Francis")</script>]. Lucy Hutchinson claimed that he deliberately divided his sons' support to protect his estates. Unlike their father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22229/', "Henry Pierrepont")</script>, who became a royalist, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22231/', "William Pierrepont")</script>, a parliamentarian, were active in parliament and of sufficient independence to make their own decisions.<br>
<br>Kingston's support and financial aid was actively solicited by both sides. According to Lucy Hutchinson, he turned down an appeal from the parliamentarian committee at Nottingham by declaring &#145;&#147;When &hellip; I take arms with the King against the Parliament, or with the Parliament against the King, let a cannon-bullet divide me between them&#148;&#146;  (Hutchinson, 107): a curse upon himself which she and parliamentarian propagandists were later to report with grim providentialist satisfaction. For in the spring of 1643 Kingston did begin to play an active role for the king: appointed colonel of an infantry regiment at the end of March, in May he was appointed lieutenant-general of the king's forces in Lincolnshire, Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire, Norfolk, and Rutland. In July 1643 his troops captured Gainsborough. When the garrison was surprised by parliamentarian forces, Kingston was captured after a gallant struggle. It was as he was being taken as a prisoner in a pinnace to Hull on 25 July 1643 that cannon-fire from unsuspecting royalists killed him. He was buried in Cuckney, Nottinghamshire.<br>
