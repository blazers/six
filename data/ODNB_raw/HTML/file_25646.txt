<span class="headword">Sinnich,  John</span>  (1603&#150;1666), <span class="occ">theologian</span>, was born in Cork of Roman Catholic parents, Maurice Sinnich and Eleanor Hogan. He was educated at the University of Louvain, where he matriculated as a &#145;pauper&#146; on 20 January 1624. The following year he obtained the highest marks in the examinations in the arts, and he proceeded to the study of theology, obtaining his doctorate on 27 September 1639. In 1637 he had been appointed to the secondary chair in theology, attached to a prebend in the collegiate church of St Peter, Louvain. After obtaining his doctorate he was presented to a second prebend, at the collegiate church of Turnhout, which he relinquished in 1640 for a canonry of the cathedral of Bruges. In 1641 he became president of the greater theological college at Louvain, and in 1642 regent of the faculty of theology. Following the death of Cornelius Jansen (Jansenius) he helped edit the <span class="italic">Augustinus</span> for publication (1640) and followed it with his own <span class="italic">Homologia Augustini Hipponensis</span> (1641), which argued the conformity of Jansen's teaching to that of St Augustine. After the publication of the papal condemnation of <span class="italic">Augustinus</span> in the bull <span class="italic">In eminenti</span> he was one of two emissaries sent to Rome by the Flemish Jansenists to plead, unsuccessfully, the orthodoxy of the work. He returned to Louvain in 1645 and devoted himself to his academic work.<br>
<br>Eleven works, several published pseudonymously, are attributed to Sinnich, a number of which were placed on the Roman index. His best-known work, <span class="italic">Sanctorum patrum &hellip; trias</span> (1648), was used extensively by Pascal, and the French theologian and Jansenist leader Antoine Arnould considered Sinnich the soundest guide on questions of grace after Jansen's death. Sinnich died at Louvain on 8 May 1666, leaving his personal property to the college to found bursaries to maintain students from Ireland at Louvain, Bruges, or Turnhout. He was buried at the collegiate church of St Peter, Louvain.<br>
