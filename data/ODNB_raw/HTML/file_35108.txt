<span class="headword">Morison, Sir  Theodore</span>  (1863&#150;1936), <span class="occ">educationist and writer</span>, was born in Malta on 9 May 1863, the only son of the author <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19271/', "James Augustus Cotter Morison (1832&#150;1888)")</script> and his wife, Frances Adelaide (<i>d</i>. 1878), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28331/', "George Virtue")</script>, the publisher [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28332/', "Virtue, James Sprent")</script>]. Educated at Westminster School (1876&#150;82), he was Westminster scholar at Trinity College, Cambridge (1882&#150;5), where he took a second class in the classical tripos.<br>
<br>Morison went to India in 1886 as tutor to the young maharajas of Chhaturpur and Charkhari. In 1889 he was appointed professor of English at the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College at Aligarh, founded by Sir Saiyid Ahmad Khan to provide a western education for Muslims within the context of Islamic culture and religion. He succeeded Theodore Beck as principal of the college in 1899, the year in which he published <span class="italic">Imperial Rule in India</span>. He regarded Khan as &#145;the most remarkable man [he] had ever met&#146; but himself played an important part in making the Aligarh college a success. During his principalship student numbers almost doubled, discipline improved through the introduction of a proctorial system, and the finances recovered. Known as Soldier Morison on account of his fondness for riding and shooting, he mixed freely with the students and maintained good relations between the Indian managers of the college and their European staff of teachers, though his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1931), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32479/', "Arthur Cohen")</script>, whom he married in 1895, was regarded by the students as rather aloof. Gertrude Bell, who visited them in January 1903, found Morison &#145;an enchanting person&#146; and his wife &#145;a bit of a prig, but I got to like her&#146;  (Bell MSS). Morison encouraged extra-curricular activities, particularly physical exercise, though he maintained his predecessor's policy of discouraging students' involvement in politics. He was a leading supporter of the movement to raise the Aligarh college to the status of a residential, denominational university for Indian Muslims, and at the Muhammadan Educational Conference at Lahore in December 1898 he moved a resolution in favour of creating a Muslim university. Although the movement was delayed by the decision in 1904 of Curzon, the viceroy, to halt the creation of further universities, the college finally achieved university status in 1920.<br>
<br>In 1905 Morison returned to England for family reasons, published his <span class="italic">The Industrial Organisation of an Indian Province</span> in 1906, and was exceptionally appointed to the Council of India that year by his old friend John (later Viscount) Morley, the secretary of state. He held the position until 1916, and was appointed KCIE in 1910 and KCSI in 1917. His unrelenting advocacy of Muslim claims to representation in government matters led Morley in 1909 to understand the pressures which had led Oliver Cromwell to &#145;send his counsellors packing&#146;  (J. Morley, <span class="italic">Recollections</span>, 2 vols., 1917, 2.315). In 1911 Morison produced a third book, <span class="italic">The Economic Transition in India</span>, and in 1913 Lord Crewe appointed him to the royal commission on the Indian public services under the chairmanship of Lord Islington. In 1915, however, he excused himself and despite his age went on active service, becoming attached to the east African expeditionary force at the request of General Smuts and to the Belgian forces in May 1917, in which year he later became senior political officer in charge of the southern area of German East Africa. When the army's educational department was established in 1918 he was put in charge of one of its sub-departments.<br>
<br>After demobilization Morison became principal of Armstrong College, Newcastle upon Tyne, in 1919; from 1924 to 1926 he was vice-chancellor of Durham University. He carried the main burden of reorganizing the college, which had such serious financial difficulties that its closure was contemplated in 1921, although it had then more than half the full-time students of the University of Durham. His exceptional energy and enthusiasm brought about not only the college's survival, but also the creation of among other things a new library and a mining department in his time. His last annual report characteristically referred to the possibilities of development, to further co-operation between the scientific departments and local industries, to the establishment of a department of social science, and to closer association with the local Society of Antiquaries to further Roman studies. His last official act was to press upon the council of the university the need for a hall of residence for male students. He retired a year early on medical advice in 1929, and went to live at Weybridge. His close friend and successor as principal of Armstrong College, the former Indian civil servant Sir William Marris, later paid tribute to his kindness and generosity, though an obituarist in <span class="italic">The Times</span> remarked that he &#145;had no use for extremists and freaks, and did not hesitate to let them know it&#146;  (15 Feb 1936).<br>
<br>Morison's only daughter died in 1928 and his wife in 1931, leaving him with just a son, but he was not one to give way to sorrow or to be inactive for long. In 1933 he became director of the British Institute in Paris, appropriately, for he had spent part of his youth there and had a special affection for the French and for French literature. He was made an officer of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur and of the Belgian order of Leopold, and in 1920 he received the honorary degree of DCL from Durham. He worked hard in Paris but his health was failing; he died at his home there, 4 Cit&eacute; Vaneau, on 14 February 1936 and was cremated in Paris.<br>
