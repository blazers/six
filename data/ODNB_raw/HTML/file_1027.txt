<span class="headword">Bagard,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1544), <span class="occ">civil lawyer and divine</span>, was born in the diocese of Hereford, of unknown parentage. He was a scholar in civil law by March 1515 at Oxford University and was a member of New Inn. He was connected with the diocese of Worcester as early as 1520, having come to the attention of William More, prior of Worcester&#151;Bagard received a small gift of 12<i>d</i>. from More at about this time. He had received the degree of BCL by 29 April 1521 and of DCL by 22 July 1528. He was nominated by Cardinal Thomas Wolsey as one of the first eighteen canons of the newly founded Cardinal College on 19 October 1526; Wolsey chose to call the fellows and scholars of the college &#145;canons&#146; in order to maintain continuity with the suppressed Frideswide Priory. Bagard was still in this position in 1530.<br>
<br>Bagard was admitted to Doctors' Commons on 7 October 1528, having practised as a proctor in the consistory court of Worcester since 1527. He served as vicar-general to Geronimo de' Ghinucci, bishop of Worcester, from 1532, retaining the post until at least 1537. His ecclesiastical career was assisted by the patronage of de' Ghinucci, Edmund Bonner, and, especially, Sir Thomas Cromwell, principal secretary and vicegerent in spirituals. He was ordained by 1519, receiving the penny given to all who were in holy orders on 6 February. He had several benefices: he was rector of the free chapel of Parke, Herefordshire, from 1529 to 1538; vicar of Penbryn, Cardiganshire, in 1535; rector of Duntisbourne Abbots, Gloucestershire, from 1536; rector of Alvechurch, Worcestershire, from 1541; and rector of Rupple, Worcestershire, until 1542. He was rector of the parish church of Bredon, Worcestershire, from 1542 until his death. Bagard became chancellor of the diocese of Worcester through the intercession of the conservative Bonner and of Cromwell in 1532. Bagard seems to have held the position until at least 1535. He was replaced as chancellor by Dr Matthew Parker, who was appointed by the new bishop, Hugh Latimer. This may indicate Bagard's conservative religious views. With his appointment as canon and first prebendary of Worcester on 24 January 1542, he was one of the first to be endowed from the confiscated property of the dissolved priory of Worcester. Therefore, despite the dissolution of the monasteries he continued to prosper.<br>
<br>Whether or not Bagard was on good terms with Latimer may depend on how the latter reacted when the former allowed an inhibition (a disqualification from exercising any function of one's order) to be issued against the bishop in 1533. There may have been tension between them over religion. Bagard was sufficiently concerned about the matter to write to Cromwell, reminding him that he had made this decision only after seeking the vicegerent's counsel and with his express backing. This and other surviving letters indicate Bagard was careful to keep his relationship with Cromwell in good order at all times. Bonner attempted to assist him in this matter as well. However, in 1534 Cromwell suspected Bagard of disloyalty to the cause of the Reformation, prompting the latter to reply to the accusation in a long letter asserting his anxiety to serve Henry VIII. His final years were less active, although he continued to participate in the administration of the diocese. He died in 1544.<br>
