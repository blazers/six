<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mills,  Cyril Bertram</span>  (1902&#150;1991), <span class="occ">circus proprietor</span>, was born on 27 February 1902 at 56 Norfolk Square, London, the elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35027/', "Bertram Wagstaff Mills (1873&#150;1938)")</script>, circus proprietor, and his wife, Ethel Kate, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Notley. Educated at Harrow School and Cambridge, where he studied engineering at master's level, Mills began his professional life by working in the oil industry between 1923 and 1925, a job that took him to Rangoon, where he worked in a mosquito- and snake-infested swamp.<br>
<br>Having previously only dabbled in their father's business, Mills and his brother, Bernard, took on the management of the Bertram Mills circus in 1925. The task was daunting for Mills, who commented that &#145;to accept [this post] meant taking a gamble of going into something for which I had no training and to which I might be totally unsuited&#146;  (Mills, 32). His first challenge was to arrange the transport of Alfred Schneider's seventy lions to the London Olympia from Paris. He also searched for talented artists and often flew his own plane to showground sites on the continent in order to audition them. One obituarist noted that:<blockquote>his arrival [at such places] was signalled round every caravan within minutes and artists changed into their Sunday-best costumes and resolved to attempt the latest death-defying addition to their acts in the hop[e] of catching his eye and winning a contract for Olympia. (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 22 July 1991)</blockquote>Although Bertram Mills's circus tented in virtually every major British town, it was the Christmas show at Olympia which gave the concern its spectacular reputation. Generations of children in Britain, including the royals, saw the Bertram Mills circus perform there. One member of the royal family told Mills during the circus's last show at Olympia that &#145;we <i>had</i> to bring the children to the last performance. We wanted them to be able to say in later years that they had actually seen the Bertram Mills circus&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>In addition to being an engineer cum circus manager, Mills was a secret agent for MI5. Codenamed Mr Grey, he was attached to the War Office during the Second World War. The famous British double agent Juan Pujol (codenamed Garbo), whose autobiography was published in 1984, claimed that he was recruited into MI5 by Mr Grey, who served as his first case officer, directing his activities which changed the course of the war. A press photograph showed the two of them together in 1984 for the first time since 1940. Friends of Mills felt sure they recognized him standing with Garbo. Mills's wartime activities extended to his head offices in Dorset Square, London, which became the headquarters for the Free French forces of the French resistance. Even after the war he continued his work in intelligence. According to Peter Wright's <span class="italic">Spycatcher</span>, he was recruited to carry out surveillance activities on the Russians during the Suez Canal crisis, using his circus business as a cover. As a tenant in a flat sandwiched between a cluster of soviet diplomatic buildings in Kensington Palace Gardens, he intercepted signals between these buildings in London and Moscow. At the same time he operated his circus business from the house. &#145;Every time we needed to deliver staff or equipment to the house&#146;, said Wright, &#145;we used a garishly painted Mills circus van. It was a perfect cover, and the Russians never suspected a thing&#146;  (Wright, 104&#150;5).<br>
<br>Spurred by the post-war boom in the circus business, Mills became both successful and rich. In 1947 he launched the circus as a public company on the London stock exchange. This was the first circus in Britain to go public. Two years later Mills became an underwriting member of Lloyd's. The success of the Bertram Mills circus began to ebb, however, with the advent of television, as well as with Mills's unwillingness to cater to the latest trends; he was said to prefer the traditional sawdust performances to New Age costumes, floats, and showgirls. Declining profits led to the closure of Mills's tenting show in 1964, and, as a consequence, its tents, wagons, and animals were sold. The company was later taken over by Maxwell Joseph, head of the Grand Metropolitan hotel chain, although this arrangement proved unprofitable and ended. The name of the company was transferred in 1978 to the new Brighton Centre, although the heyday of the Bertram Mills circus had clearly ended.<br>
<br>Even in his retirement Mills was the subject of popular interest, and in 1989 he was celebrated on <span class="italic">This is your Life</span>. Suffering from emphysema and a heart condition, he nevertheless made a guest appearance on the same programme in 1990 in order to pay tribute to his last ringmaster, Norman Barrett. He died at his home, 51 Cumberland Terrace, Camden, London, on 20 July 1991, of bronchopneumonia. He was survived by his wife, Mimi, two sons, and two daughters.<br>
