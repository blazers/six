<span class="headword">Wasbrough,  Matthew</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1753, <em>d.</em> 1781), <span class="occ">engineer and inventor of steam engines</span>, born at 3 Narrow Wine Street, Bristol, was baptized on 18 November 1753, the son of Mary and William Wasbrough. William Wasbrough was originally a barber&#150;surgeon and peruke maker, who was in partnership with Roger Rice in a brass-founding and clockmaking business in Narrow Wine Street. Matthew Wasbrough had at least three older brothers. On 23 January 1776 he married Elizabeth Dowell at St Peter's, Bristol.<br>
<br>Taking an early interest in his father's work, Wasbrough constructed a steam engine with which to drive all the lathes and other machines; in order to do this, he had to convert the reciprocating movement of the Newcomen-type beam engine into rotary motion. He achieved this by using a ratchet and pawl mechanism to produce the rotary motion, combined with a flywheel which reduced the otherwise excessive variations in the speed of rotation.<br>
<br>On 10 March 1779 Wasbrough was granted patent no. 1213 for a machine which made use of this mechanism. It was, however, not robust or reliable enough in constant use: it seems that, after he completed an engine to drive a mill owned by James Pickard at Snow Hill in Birmingham, it was found to be unsatisfactory, and a crank was substituted&#151;an idea probably taken from James Watt, and enterprisingly adopted by Wasbrough and Pickard. In the words of John Farey: &#145;The engine then answered so much better than anything which had been tried before that the same principle has been followed ever since&#146;. This was probably the first successful application of the crank to a steam engine in order to produce rotary motion.<br>
<br>A patent granted to Pickard on 23 August 1780 for a &#145;new-invented method of applying steam engines to the turning of wheeles, whereby a rotative motion is performed, and the power of the engine is more immediately and fully applied &hellip; than by the intervention of water&#146; was worded loosely and failed to define the method involved. There was apparently an agreement between Pickard and Wasbrough allowing the latter to use the crank, and the engine builder who was most incensed at the patenting of a device which he maintained had been known for centuries was James Watt. In any case, Wasbrough benefited little from either his invention or his arrangement with Pickard. He had entered into negotiations with the commissioners of his majesty's victualling office for the erection of an engine to drive a corn mill, and manufacture of the parts was well advanced, when for some reason they turned to John Smeaton for an opinion, and he recommended a pumping engine and water-wheel. This disappointment, coming at a time when he was already in a precarious state of health, is said to have accelerated Wasbrough's death from fever on 21 October 1781. He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>A notice of Wasbrough's death in the <span class="italic">Bristol Journal</span> supports the view that had he lived he would have made an even greater mark as an engineer: &#145;The public have to deplore in him the loss of one of the first mechanics in the kingdom, whose early genius brought to perfection that long-wished-for desideratum, the applying the powers of the fire-engine to rotular movements&#146;  (<span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 293).<br>
