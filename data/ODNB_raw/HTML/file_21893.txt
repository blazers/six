<span class="headword">Penruddock,  John</span>  (1619&#150;1655), <span class="occ">royalist conspirator</span>, was the eldest son of Sir John Penruddock (<i>d</i>. 1648) of Compton Chamberlayne, Wiltshire. The Penruddocks had been established as a landed family in Wiltshire since the late sixteenth century and Sir John had served as sheriff of the county in 1635. John Penruddock was educated at Blandford School, Queen's College, Oxford, and Gray's Inn. In 1639 he married Arundel Freke, daughter of John Freke of Ewerne's Courtenay and Melcombe, Dorset. On the outbreak of the civil war the Penruddock family supported Charles I. John Penruddock rose to the rank of colonel and fought for the king until Easter 1645 when he resigned his commission and attempted to compound for his confiscated estates. Two of his younger brothers were killed fighting for the king. On his father's death in 1648 he inherited the family estate, but as a result of his inability to pay his composition fine, the lands remained sequestered for six years before he raised the &pound;1300 required to regain them. He later estimated that he had amassed debts of about &pound;1500 as a direct result of the war.<br>
<br>During the early 1650s Penruddock refused to become reconciled to the new English state and in 1655 he was heavily involved in an abortive rising mounted by the underground royalist organization, the Sealed Knot. The conspirators had intended to stage a series of co-ordinated armed insurrections in a number of locations throughout England, but on 8 March risings near Newcastle upon Tyne, York, and Nottingham were quickly suppressed and another in Cheshire failed to materialize at all. Penruddock and his supporters had originally planned to seize Winchester but they dropped the idea after the town's garrison was reinforced at the last minute. Instead, on the night of 11 March, several hundred cavalry led by Penruddock and Sir Joseph Wagstaffe rendezvoused at Clarendon Park in Wiltshire, and before dawn rode into Salisbury and arrested the sheriff of the county and the judges who were conducting the Wiltshire assizes sessions there. After proclaiming their support for Charles Stuart, they left Salisbury and rode westward through Blandford, Sherborne, and Yeovil in the hope that the royalists of Somerset and Dorset would come in to swell their numbers. Very few, however, joined them and several days later a small force of government troops from the garrison at Exeter commanded by Captain Unton Croke caught up with them at South Molton in north Devon. After a skirmish the royalists were defeated and Penruddock was captured.<br>
<br>In the aftermath of the rising Penruddock was put on trial for treason before a jury of local men at Exeter. According to his own account of his trial he argued that opposing Cromwell could not constitute treason as the protector's power had not been legally sanctioned, and declared to the judge: &#145;The law I am now tried by is no law, but what is cut out by the poynt of a rebellious sword&#146;  (Penruddock, 5). He told the jury: &#145;I observe treason in this age to be an <i>individuum vagum</i>, like the wind in the Gospel, which bloweth where it listeth; for that shall be treason in me today which shall be none in another tomorrow&#146;  (ibid., 6). He also argued that, on his surrender at South Molton, Croke had offered him security for his life and estates. These arguments were dismissed and he was sentenced to death.<br>
<br>At the end of the trial Penruddock expressed his hope that Cromwell would commute his sentence. His wife, Arundel, subsequently campaigned vigorously on his behalf, travelling to London to plead with Cromwell for his life. All her efforts were in vain, however, and he was beheaded at Exeter on 16 May 1655. Shortly afterwards an account of his last days and execution was circulated by his friend Seymour Bowman. This contained what the author claimed was the last correspondence between Penruddock and his wife. Penruddock was said to have written at one point: &#145;though the armies of men have been too hard for me, yet am I now lifting myself under the conduct of my Sovereign and an army of martyrs, that the gates of hell cannot prevail against&#146;  (Ravenhill, 15.3). No original manuscripts of this correspondence exist, and its authenticity must be doubted; none the less, its circulation along with the account of the trial did much to turn Penruddock into a martyr for the royalist cause. His estates were subsequently confiscated, but Cromwell later responded to a petition from his widow and granted a portion of them back to the family. The decision to send out major-generals to govern England in the autumn of 1655 was a direct response to Penruddock's rebellion.<br>
