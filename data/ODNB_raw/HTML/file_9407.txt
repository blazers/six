<span class="headword">Fielding,  Theodore Henry Adolphus</span>  (1781&#150;1851), <span class="occ">watercolour painter, engraver, and author</span>, was the eldest son of the painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9403/', "Nathan Theodore Fielding (1746/7&#150;1819)")</script> and Elizabeth (Betty) Baker or Barker (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1806/7). He was born near Sowerby Bridge, Yorkshire, in 1781, and baptized at nearby Rippondon on 27 February the following year. He probably shared his family's peripatetic existence in Yorkshire, Acton, Durham, and Ambleside and received instruction from his father until the early 1800s. The first exhibit credited to his name at the Royal Academy, a Northumberland view in 1799, is now thought to have been by his father. At other times his exhibited works have been confused with those of his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9406/', "Thales Fielding")</script>, and indeed Graves's list of Royal Academy exhibitors conflated their names.<br>
<br>In 1819 at Manchester Fielding married Mary Anne Walton, daughter of Robert Walton, a painter. Both she and her elder sister painted flowers, birds, and insects, and on 12 February 1821 she was elected a lady member of the Society of Painters in Water Colours. She exhibited there until 1834 and died in the following year. Also in 1821 one of Fielding's first publications, <span class="italic">A Picturesque Tour of the English Lakes</span>, was illustrated with his plates after drawings made by himself and his brother-in-law James Walton &#145;during a two years residence among the Lakes&#146;. Early in 1823 Theodore Fielding went to Paris to work for the print publisher J. F. Ostervald, who had already employed Thales and their youngest brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9404/', "Newton Fielding")</script>. The brothers established an atelier in the place Dauphine, which was maintained for some years at various Parisian addresses, in parallel to their London studio at 26 Newman Street. They established close relations with Bonington and Delacroix, who frequently mentioned the brothers in diaries and letters, and were pivotal figures in the Anglo-French school.<br>
<br>Fielding returned to London at the end of the year to concentrate on teaching and engraving. He had already taken on William Callow as a studio assistant, and in 1825 Callow was apprenticed to him, along with Charles Bentley and John William Edge. His <span class="italic">British Castles: a Compendious History of the Ancient Military Structures of Great Britain</span> appeared in 1825, which may have been a factor in redirecting his career. Towards the end of the following year he was appointed teacher of drawing and perspective at the East India Company's military college at Addiscombe, and moved from Newman Street to Croydon, his home for the rest of his life. He was very popular with the cadets, among whom &#145;there was a tradition that in order to be marked high in his class it was advisable to take lessons from his brother&#146; Newton, who needed the business  (Vibart, 64&#150;5). Fielding's Frenchified manner (a souvenir of his one visit to Paris) earned him the nickname Johnny Bleu.<br>
<br>In Fielding's numerous sets of published prints after his own drawings and those of other artists such as his brother Copley and Bonington, he used stipple and aquatint as well as line engraving. He also published a series of well-regarded books on the theory and practice of painting and engraving beginning with <span class="italic">Synopsis of Practical Perspective, Lineal and Aerial</span> (1829), and continuing with <span class="italic">Index of Colours and Mixed Tints, for the Use of Beginners in Landscape and Figure Painting</span> (1830), <span class="italic">On the Theory of Painting</span> (1835, with enlarged editions in 1836, 1839, and 1842), <span class="italic">The Art of Engraving</span> (1841), <span class="italic">Ackermann's Manual of Colours used in the Different Branches of Water-Colour Painting</span> (1844), and <span class="italic">The knowledge and restoration of old paintings, the modes of judging between copies and originals, and a brief life of the principal masters of the different schools</span> (1847). In <span class="italic">On the Theory of Painting</span>, he took up the cudgels against the alliance of science and fashion which insisted on drawing papers &#145;of an extraordinary degree of whiteness; these may be suspected of having had a superabundance of acid used in the bleaching&#146;  (Mallalieu, <span class="italic">Understanding Watercolours</span>, 41). He quoted an instance of acid turning all the blues in a drawing to reds in a matter of three or four months. Fielding retired on a comfortable pension in 1850, and he died at his house, Duppas Hill, Croydon, of bladder stones and chronic cystitis on 11 July 1851. There are watercolours by him in the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the Eastbourne and Leeds art galleries.<br>
