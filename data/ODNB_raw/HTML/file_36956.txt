<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wilson,  Henry Maitland</span>, first Baron Wilson  (1881&#150;1964), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 5 September 1881, the eldest of the three sons of Captain Arthur Maitland Wilson OBE (1857&#150;1934) of Stowlangtoft Hall, Suffolk, and his wife, (Harriet Maude) Isabella (<i>d</i>. 14 March 1906), eldest daughter of Colonel Sir Nigel Robert Fitzhardinge Kingscote (1830&#150;1908) GCVO, KCB, of Kingscote, Gloucestershire, paymaster to the household of Edward VII. On his mother's side Wilson was descended from Admiral Lord Howe and Lord Raglan, commander in the Crimea. Wilson went to Eton College (1895&#150;8) and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and on 10 March 1900 he was commissioned into the rifle brigade (lieutenant 1901), with which he had family connections: his uncle (later Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Fuller Maitland), became colonel commandant, 2nd battalion. Wilson joined the 2nd battalion in South Africa, after the relief of Ladysmith (28 February 1900), and served with it until the end of the South African War, before moving with the battalion to Cairo in 1902.<br>
<br>Loyalty to his regiment and devotion to Eton were two prominent strands in Wilson's life. When he became a general most officers on his personal staff wore black buttons, and he took an abiding interest in regimental matters, especially when colonel commandant. He was to be president of the Old Etonian Association (1948&#150;9) and chairman of the committee (1950&#150;64). He was also a field sports enthusiast, particularly where horses were concerned, though his physical bulk, which caused him to be known as Jumbo and contributed to his impressive presence, did not make it easy to find him a suitable horse.<br>
<br>Wilson went with the 2nd battalion to India in 1907, was promoted captain in 1908, served with the 3rd battalion in Bordon and Tipperary, and in 1911 was posted adjutant to the Oxford University officer training corps; here he had much to do with the flow of good young officers into the &#145;Green Jackets&#146; (the rifle brigade and 60th rifles) when war broke out in 1914.<br>
<br>Wilson's own service in the First World War, which kept him continuously in France from 1915, was on the staff, almost certainly because he was too good a staff officer to be allowed back to the regimental duty he preferred. He went out as brigade major in the 16th (Irish) division (General Sir James Steele later said he was the best brigade major he ever knew) and was successively GSO2 of 41st division on the Somme and of 19th corps in the third battle of Ypres before going, in October 1917, as GSO1 to the New Zealand division, with which he stayed until the war's end.<br>
<br>Wilson was appointed DSO in 1917, and mentioned in dispatches; he was promoted major on 1 September 1915 and brevet lieutenant-colonel on 1 January 1919; and later that year he went to the Staff College, Camberley, in the hand-picked group which made up the first post-war staff course. Wilson married on 15 December 1914 Hester Mary, youngest daughter of Philip James Digby Wykeham, of Tythrop House, Oxfordshire, and they had a son, Patrick Maitland, born on 14 September 1915, and a daughter.<br>
<br>After time at Sandhurst, Wilson returned to the regiment (the first time for twelve years) as second-in-command of the 2nd battalion at Aldershot; he then spent three years (1930&#150;33) as GSO1 Staff College (in the rank of colonel)&#151;where he reportedly only had time for leading members of the drag hunt&#151;and as chief umpire to the 2nd division under Strickland, when the general officer commanding-in-chief was that professionally exacting officer, General Sir Philip Chetwode. This episode played a significant part in Wilson's professional development and made him more widely known. He commanded the 1st battalion (1927&#150;30) on the north-west frontier, and enjoyed racing, shooting and pigsticking. Wilson had nine months on half pay before taking over the 16th infantry brigade, in January 1934, from Wavell. This was a time of experiment in mechanization and on motorized infantry operating with armour. The concept of the motor battalion&#151;a type of unit in which riflemen were before long to distinguish themselves&#151;was emerging.<br>
<br>Having been promoted major-general on 30 April 1935, at a time when commands were hard to come by, Wilson was again on half pay&#151;this time for nearly two years&#151;until taking over the 2nd division, again from his old friend Wavell, in August 1937.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1939, in the threatening international situation, Wilson was appointed general officer commanding-in-chief, British troops in Egypt, in the rank of lieutenant-general, and left England on 15 June (noting it was Ascot gold cup day) to spend the next eight years, including the Second World War, overseas.<br>
<br>Wilson was already high in the confidence of Anthony Eden, secretary of state for war: they had served together as Green Jackets in the First World War. He was soon to win Churchill's confidence, and never lost it. The operations of the army of the Nile (as it came to be called) under Wilson's command, with Wavell commander-in-chief, Middle East, resulted in spectacular successes in late 1940 and early 1941 in the western desert of Egypt and Libya against numerically superior Italian forces&#151;operations in which motorized infantry working with tanks were prominent. In 1941, after the capture of Tobruk (22 January), while Lieutenant-General Sir Richard O'Connor continued the desert campaign to further successes, Wilson was appointed by Wavell military governor of Cyrenaica. The war cabinet had decided, with grave misgivings on the part of its military advisers, to send an expeditionary force to help Greece against German invasion. The British and imperial forces available were too weak to be of much help. Eden, in Cairo, cabled (21 February 1941) that the expeditionary force required the best available commander and that he, Sir J. G. Dill, chief of the Imperial General Staff, and Wavell all agreed this was Wilson. His quiet authority was certainly useful in a time of high political sensitivity, while his tactical skill was evident in the conduct of the withdrawal, which ended with British evacuation of mainland Greece. Wavell met Wilson in Crete and told him he wanted him to go to Jerusalem and relieve Baghdad. Wilson became general officer commanding British forces in Palestine and Transjordan (1941). The successful relief of Baghdad, under siege by pro-axis Iraqis, was followed by the move of British and imperial forces into Vichy-held Syria and Lebanon, where the use by German aircraft of French airfields had invited a British ultimatum. The inclusion of a Free French contingent in this force was, in spite of the low availability of other troops and political pressure from de Gaulle, almost certainly a mistake. British officers with much experience in the Levant knew that what might be only token resistance from the Vichy side, offered as a matter of professional honour, would almost certainly develop into savage fighting if the Free French came in, which is just what happened. Some tended to blame Wilson (now designated commander-in-chief, allied forces in Syria) for an error of judgement but the decision (against which Wavell had argued) was taken in London.<br>
<br>Tension between Churchill and Wavell was growing and in July 1941 the latter was replaced as commander-in-chief, Middle East, by General Sir Claude Auchinleck, with whom Churchill was going to find it no easier to agree. On 2 July Churchill urged Auchinleck to consider Wilson for command in the western desert. &#145;It is much to be regretted&#146;, Churchill wrote, &#145;that this advice, subsequently repeated, was not taken&#146;. Auchinleck preferred General Sir Alan G. Cunningham, after his success in Abyssinia, but the appointment did nothing to improve British performance in the field and under Cunningham's successor, General N. M. Ritchie, results were even worse and retreat towards the Nile delta continued. Only when Auchinleck did what Churchill had latterly been urging and took command himself did the position stabilize, almost in the delta.<br>
<br>Wilson, who had been appointed general officer commanding-in-chief Ninth Army (1941), with his headquarters in Lebanon, had been brought down to Egypt to command troops in the delta against a possible breakthrough by Rommel. In August 1942 he was ordered personally by Churchill, whom he met for the first time, to take over the new command being set up in Persia and Iraq, on the Russians' southern flank and, with its communications and oil, of growing importance. He was commander-in-chief Persia&#150;Iraq command from 1942 to 1943. From 23 September 1942 he spent eighteen months, based in Baghdad, in complex work which was more political, administrative, and diplomatic than strictly military: work he was well suited to and did well. The transfer of General Alexander from the post of commander-in-chief, Middle East, to that of deputy commander-in-chief to Eisenhower in January 1943, to assume direction of the last stages of the campaign by allied land forces in north Africa, left the position of commander-in-chief, Middle East, vacant. Churchill, again in Cairo, had Wilson moved into the post. Since the highest allied priority in the Mediterranean was the support of Eisenhower's command, Wilson's position was soon to become, in Churchill's hyperbole, that of a general &#145;with responsibilities but no troops&#146;.<br>
<br>On the collapse of Italy later in 1943 Churchill saw an opportunity to establish a dominant position in the eastern Mediterranean before the Germans could prevent it. He cabled Wilson from Washington (9 September 1943): &#145;This is the time to play high. Improvise and dare.&#146; There was little more that Wilson could do, since virtually all resources were earmarked for the central Mediterranean, than launch some ill-supported, and in the end unsuccessful and wasteful, small operations in the Dodecanese on Cos, Leros, and Samos. Roosevelt consistently refused to allow any forces to be diverted from Eisenhower except for the Far East and would hear of nothing that suggested the slightest possibility of delaying &#145;Overlord&#146;, and the second front in north-west Europe. However, there was enthusiastic American support for a landing in southern France (Operation &#145;Anvil&#146;, later renamed &#145;Dragoon&#146;), in which neither Wilson nor the prime minister saw any merit. Wilson would dearly have liked to carry out Churchill's cherished wish to capture Rhodes but Roosevelt was adamant. Churchill submitted to his decision but, as he wrote, &#145;with one of the sharpest pangs I suffered in the war&#146;.<br>
<br>The &#145;bleeding of the Eastern Mediterranean&#146; also brought Churchill into the acutest differences he ever had with Eisenhower, but at the same time it brought him even closer to Wilson, and when Eisenhower was moved from the theatre to take charge of the preparations for &#145;Overlord&#146;, Wilson was from 8 January 1944, on Churchill's suggestion and with Roosevelt's approval, appointed supreme commander in the Mediterranean. There followed the further operations in Italy, under Alexander's command of the land forces, including the Anzio landing with its disappointingly weak command and slow gains, the steady grind northwards, and the continuing difference of emphasis between the allies on the relative importance of a landing in the south of France, firmly opposed by Wilson and seen by Churchill only as an extravagant and unnecessary diversion. Churchill and Wilson, would have much preferred strengthening allied forces in Italy, instead of reducing them, and pressing on up through Austria into Hungary, while exploiting Tito's successes along the Adriatic. Under very strong pressure from the Americans (suspicious of British intentions in the Balkans) the Riviera landings eventually took place, against almost negligible opposition, and were acclaimed a resounding, if scarcely relevant, success.<br>
<br>Trouble in Greece as the Germans withdrew in the autumn of 1944 and the communists attempted to seize power, required British military intervention but Wilson was again on the move. Field Marshal Sir John Dill, head of the joint staff mission in Washington, died there on 4 November 1944. The good personal relations he had established, and above all Dill's firm friendship with General Marshall, had been of the utmost value to the alliance and it was imperative to put in the best available successor. On 21 November Churchill told Wilson, &#145;I can find only one officer with the necessary credentials and qualities, namely, yourself.&#146; Wilson, promoted field marshal in 1944, took up the appointment in January 1945 and held it until it lapsed early in 1947. On 23 April 1947 he left for home. He had to accustom himself to holding a very high-ranking post with no command responsibilities. He was fully occupied as trusted intermediary on military matters between the British prime minister and the president, a position which did not essentially change when Roosevelt was succeeded by Truman. Wilson attended the Yalta and Potsdam conferences and was kept informed on the delicate manoeuvring which led to Hiroshima and Nagasaki. A dedicated professional soldier, Wilson had also a flair for diplomacy which possibly played a more important part in what he achieved than military talent.<br>
<br>An impressive figure, Wilson had an appearance and manner which compelled attention and inspired confidence. He usually spoke little but what he said was to the point. He had &#145;shrewd little steely eyes&#146;, and when he looked at you closely over his half-moon spectacles it could be uncomfortable. He made no pretence to be an intellectual and was rather better in direct confrontation than on paper. His judgement was on the whole sound, though some of his arrangements for operations in the Dodecanese, admittedly at a time of frustration and some confusion, have been criticized. He was loved by some and was held in deep affection and respect by young officers who came close to him. At the same time he occasionally gave perhaps insufficient attention to personal hardship if he considered it necessary to disregard it, possibly from occasional lapses in imagination.<br>
<br>Wilson was made CB (1937), KCB (1940), GBE (1941), and GCB (1944), and received foreign honours. On 12 March 1946 he was made Baron Wilson of Libya and of Stowlangtoft. He chose as supporters to his coat of arms &#145;Dexter, a Rifleman, and Sinister, a Bugler, both of the rifle brigade in full dress proper&#146;.<br>
<br>In the House of Lords, Wilson sat on the cross-benches, as befitted a field marshal, and took part in defence debates. He was active in the Royal United Service Institution, the Mounted Infantry Club, and especially the South African War Veterans' Association. He was colonel commandant of the rifle brigade (1939&#150;51), and constable of the Tower of London (1955&#150;60). As president of the Army Cadet Force Association from 1947, he devoted much time and affectionate attention to army cadets. For some years he lived quietly in the Chilterns and seemed lonely. Wherever he lived, his heart remained in Suffolk.<br>
<br>His last appearance in public was at Eton on St Andrew's day, 1964. On 31 December 1964 he was taken ill and died peacefully at his home, Wheelwrights, Chilton, Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. He was buried with his family at Stowlangtoft, Suffolk, and a memorial service was held in Westminster Abbey.<br>
<br>Wilson's son Patrick succeeded him as second Baron Wilson.<br>
