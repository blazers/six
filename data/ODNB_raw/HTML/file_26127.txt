<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Spencer,  Gervase</span>  (<em>c.</em>1715&#150;1763), <span class="occ">miniature painter</span>, is of unknown parentage. According to Edwards he &#145;was originally a gentleman's servant, but, having a natural turn to the pursuits of art, amused himself with drawing&#146;  (Edwards, 18&#150;19). Spencer apparently suggested that he copy a recently completed miniature of one of his master's family, &#145;a hint [that] was received with much surprise, but he was indulged with permission to make the attempt&#146;  (ibid.). His success meant that he &#145;acquired the encouragement and patronage of those he served, and by their interest, became a fashionable painter of the day&#146;  (ibid.). Spencer's contemporary George Vertue also commented on his training; in July 1749 he noted:<blockquote>Lately I was shewn some watercoloured limnings&#151;womens heads&#151;done by a young man, Mr Spencer, who a few years ago was in the capacity of a footman to Dr W.&#151;and now professes limning with some success, which demonstrates a genius pracizing [<i>sic</i>] by degrees of himself,&#151;and really is in a curious neat manner and masterly. (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 3.51)</blockquote>In the first half of the eighteenth century it was the norm for British miniaturists to be self-taught rather than to undergo formal apprenticeships. Enamel painting, however, demanded a significant outlay in terms of equipment for firing and involved unpredictable procedures. It is not known if Spencer received formal training in enamel. Samuel Finney noted in his memoirs that, when in 1760 he wanted to try enamel painting, there was &#145;only one Artist in that Branch, Mr Spencer &hellip; and he was excellent, though the knowledge he had gained in that Art was almost purely his own&#146;. Finney believed he was emulating Spencer when he chose to &#145;attempt this difficult Art too without a Master&#146;  (Finney, &#145;Autobiographical account&#146;, 287&#150;313).<br>
<br>Spencer established his practice in London, presumably through newspaper advertisements and word of mouth; his earliest miniatures date from about 1745. Only late in his career did the first public exhibiting society open, the Society of Artists; he exhibited in 1761 number 111, <span class="italic">Two Ladies in Enamel</span>, and in 1762 number 106, <span class="italic">Two Miniatures, in Enamel</span>. Graves gives Spencer's dates of exhibition as 1761&#150;74  (Graves, <span class="italic">Artists</span>, 262) and Foskett gives an address for Spencer of 28 Suffolk Street  (Foskett, 527). But the Mr Spencer of 28 Suffolk Street who exhibited in 1774, at the same society, number 242, <span class="italic">An Old Man's Head, Kit-Kat</span>, is clearly another artist. Gervase Spencer's name also appears in <span class="italic">Mortimer's Universal Director</span> (1763), an early trade directory advertising the services of artists and others.<br>
<br>By the 1760s aspiring miniaturists were, in contrast to Spencer's generation, taking lessons with established miniaturists. According to Samuel Redgrave, Henry Spicer (1743&#150;1801) was Spencer's pupil  (Redgrave, <span class="italic">Artists</span>, 408). However, Edwards noted of Spicer, &#145;Although the author was acquainted with this artist, yet he knows not who was his master&#146;  (Edwards, 287&#150;8). Joseph Farington, however, in a note in his diary in 1796 about the Carwardine family, remembered that one of the &#145;3 or 4 daughters &hellip; who afterwards married Mr Butler was some time with Spencer the Miniature Painter who taught her that art and she instructed her brother&#146;  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 2.651&#150;2); this was presumably Penelope Carwardine.<br>
<br>Spencer's standing among his contemporaries is attested to by his fellow miniaturist Samuel Finney. Finney wrote that when he moved to London in 1748/9 to learn more about miniature painting &#145;There were at that time only two Miniature Painters of Eminence in London, Spencer who was excellent&#146;, and another whom Finney despised and identified only as &#145;T&#146;  (Finney, &#145;Autobiographical account&#146;, 267&#150;87). Finney &#145;admired&#146; Spencer and &#145;wished to arrive to his excellence, and be his Rival&#146;  (ibid.). Spencer also knew Sir Joshua Reynolds, whose oil portrait of Spencer painting a miniature was in the sale of Spencer's effects in 1797; its whereabouts are now unknown though Edwards noted that it was &#145;late in the possession of [the] artist, Mr Edridge&#146;  (Edwards, 18&#150;19). Spencer made a brush drawing in grey wash of this portrait (British Museum) and etched it himself, showing the sitter in reverse to the drawing; a number of impressions are in the British Museum, one lettered, presumably by Spencer, &#145;Sr I Reynolds pinx &hellip; se ipse sculp&#146; and subsequently (and clearly not by the etcher) &#145;George [<i>sic</i>] Spencer Miniature Painter&#146;.<br>
<br>It is not known when or whom Spencer married but Edwards noted that when Spencer died he left<blockquote>a daughter, who married a person of the name of Lloyd &hellip; and at his death, Mr. Spencer's remaining collection of neglected miniatures, unfinished performances, together with his painting materials, were sold by auction by Hutchins, Wells, and Fischer [Fisher] in King-street, Covent-garden, in December 1797. (Edwards, 18&#150;19)</blockquote>(A copy of the catalogue is recorded in the cabinet des estampes of the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, Paris.) The sale catalogue also included a now lost portrait, <span class="italic">Mrs. Spencer, by Barwell</span> (presumably Thomas Bardwell). In addition Spencer executed a number of small etchings, including a half-length of a woman in a hood, inscribed &#145;No. 1 Jan 27 1757 London&#146; and identified in later inscriptions as Mrs Spencer (British Museum). According to Edwards, Spencer died on 30 October 1763 &#145;at his house in Great Marlborough-street, where he had resided some years&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Spencer was prolific and is represented in many public and private collections. The quality of the work attributed to him is variable and as he often signed his work it is possible that some of the unsigned works attributed to Spencer are by other artists. Some of Spencer's works indicate that he borrowed poses and costumes from the portraits of the French artist Jean-&Eacute;tienne Liotard (1689&#150;1762), for example, the portrait of Elizabeth Bradshaw at the Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, Connecticut.<br>
