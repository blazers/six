<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ne Win</span>  (1911&#150;2002), <span class="occ">military ruler of Burma</span>, was born Shu Maung on 14 May 1911 in Paungdale, central Burma, the son of Po Kha, a revenue surveyor, and his wife, Mi Le. His father's home was said to be a frequent stop for touring nationalist politicians despite his employment by the British colonial government. Having attended Prome Government High School he read biology at University College, Rangoon (1929&#150;32), but left before taking a degree or undertaking medical training as intended. Joining the conservative faction of the nationalist Do Bama Asiayone (&#145;We Burmese Association&#146;), he worked in the post office in Rangoon during the 1930s.<br>
<br>In 1941 Shu Maung, together with twenty-nine other young nationalists led by Aung San, after military training in Hainan, joined forces with the Japanese to remove the British from Burma. It was during this time that he adopted the name Ne Win (&#145;Brilliant Sun&#146;). Known as the Thirty Comrades, they provided the initial officer corps of the Burma Independence Army. The Burma Independence Army, reorganized as the Burma National Army, turned against the Japanese in March 1945, and together with General William Slim's Fourteenth Army joined in harrying the retreating Japanese until August of that year. Ne Win then joined the British Burma army as a major in December 1945, the Burma National Army having been recognized as the &#145;patriotic Burmese forces&#146; by Admiral Lord Mountbatten. Before Burma regained independence on 4 January 1948, Ne Win led troops against Thakin Soe's faction of the Communist Party of Burma in the oilfields. Soe had previously been Ne Win's political leader during anti-Japanese resistance in the Irrawaddy delta.<br>
<br>Soon after independence the government of Nu faced a multi-pronged civil war fighting both communist and ethnic minority insurgents, mainly Karen and Kachin, as well as former members of the Burma National and British armies. The 4th Burma rifles (which Ne Win commanded) and half of the 5th Burma rifles remained loyal to the government and Ne Win was soon in overall command of this force of 10,000 men. At the height of the civil war, he was not only military commander but also deputy prime minister as well as home minister and defence minister. As it fought against the domestic insurgents, the army had also to contain American-backed Chinese nationalist troops who had entered northern Burma in their flight from the Chinese communist Red Army.<br>
<br>Meanwhile the government of Nu came under increasing pressure and in October 1958, after it lost its anti-communist majority, Nu asked Ne Win to form a non-political caretaker government. During Ne Win's eighteen months as prime minister a border treaty was agreed with communist China, and the hereditary powers of the &#145;feudal&#146; rulers in the Shan States were ended. His government, however, became unpopular among civilian politicians for undermining the power of various warlords who had supported Nu's governments. Ne Win returned power to Nu following elections in 1960 and was hailed as a champion of constitutional democracy.<br>
<br>However, in March 1962 Ne Win ousted Nu and took sole executive, judicial, and legislative powers as chairman of a revolutionary council government. He set out to centralize power and introduced radical, autarkic, socialist economic policies. His military government transmogrified itself into a civilian one-party state led by the Burma Socialist Programme Party under a new constitution in 1974. Ne Win retained his dominant position as chairman of the party even after he stepped down as president in 1981. Though he presided over a strict socialist regime, he was more ideologically driven as a nationalist than as a Marxist. His government was never able to defeat the myriad ethnic insurgent groups which had sprung up in the border areas of the country, and as the economy deteriorated after almost all foreign investments were nationalized and management of the economy fell to his untrained military associates the country stagnated in isolation from global developments. Though he managed to keep his country out of the cold war conflicts which affected other parts of south-east Asia, he presided over a regime which fell badly behind its neighbours in growth and prosperity. By 1987 the economic situation of the country was dire, and following several months of increasingly violent demonstrations against the Burma Socialist Programme Party regime, Ne Win resigned in July 1988, calling for a referendum to return to multi-party democracy. A few months later the army he had shaped seized power again and his influence waned.<br>
<br>Ne Win was married at least four times (some sources suggest five or even seven): first, in the 1930s, to Tin Tin; second, in the 1940s, to Khin May (Kitty) Than (<i>d</i>. 1972), who had a strong influence on him; third, in 1976, to June Rose Bellamy (Yadana Natmai), an Anglo-Burmese; and fourth, to Ni Ni Myint, a professor of history. He had a reputation as a playboy, and enjoyed the Rangoon Turf Club and various golf clubs. His last months were spent effectively under house arrest following a bizarre plot by a son-in-law and three grandsons to install a &#145;Ne Win dynasty&#146;. His death in Yangon (Rangoon) on 5 December 2002 was little marked, though the belief that he was all-powerful and solely responsible for his country's plight survived his passing. He was buried in Ye Way cemetery, Yangon, on 5 December.<br>
