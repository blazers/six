<span class="headword">Ercolani,  Lucian Randolph</span>  (1888&#150;1976), <span class="occ">furniture designer and manufacturer</span>, was born on 8 May 1888 at Sant' Angelo in Vado, in the Marche, Italy, the eldest son of Abdon Ercolani, a picture framer, and his wife, a dressmaker. He was left in the care of his grandmother when his parents moved to Florence for his father's employment, being reunited with them in 1895. Ercolani's father was a protestant evangelist, and sent his son to a Baptist school in Florence; however in 1898 local Salvation Army representatives encouraged the father to migrate to London, from where he was shortly able to send for his wife and family and settle at Walthamstow. After a brief schooling, Ercolani began work as a messenger boy for the Salvation Army. He was encouraged by his father to attend night school, and in 1902 enrolled at Shoreditch Technical Institute where he studied drawing and design, followed by the construction of furniture. About 1906 he transferred to the Salvation Army joinery department, where he remained several years. Ercolani took every opportunity to familiarize himself with furniture of all historical periods, by visiting museums and great houses open to the public. On Sundays he played the trombone in the Salvation Army band but he did not have enough free time for rehearsals, and in 1909 the bandmaster asked him to resign. Ercolani then began attending services at his local Baptist church, where he met his future wife, Eva Mary (1886/7&#150;1971), daughter of George Brett, a retired policeman.<br>
<br>At about this time Ercolani left his course at Shoreditch. He began to earn money as a freelance artist and designer and after leaving the joinery he was hired as a furniture designer by Frederick Parker of High Wycombe, the firm which later became Parker-Knoll. Ercolani began teaching in the evenings and it was as his pupil that he first met Edward Gomme, son of a chairmaker and later famous for his G-plan furniture. The two men became lifelong friends and professional colleagues. On the outbreak of the First World War Ercolani volunteered to enlist in the British army, but before he could be directed into active service he was placed on the reserve list and sent to Gomme's factory, which was already fully engaged on war work, principally on aircraft components and propellors. He and Eva Brett were married on 1 June 1915; they had two sons, Lucian and Barry, and a daughter, Roma.<br>
<br>The opportunity of independence came when a consortium of people connected with the furniture trade invited Ercolani to join them in the construction and operation of a new manufactory in High Wycombe. These were Rich and Peters, twine merchants, and Harding and Ironmonger, merchant bankers; they were willing to put up the money, and when Ercolani, who was to be managing director and in charge of the factory, explained that he could not afford to invest, they gave him shares worth &pound;1000. A site was acquired, the factory built and equipped, and production commenced in a modest way in 1920, trading as Furniture Industries.<br>
<br>After surmounting the inevitable problems associated with running a factory during the depression, Ercolani's backers encouraged him to visit the USA. A month in New York brought him many new insights and a glimpse of different business methods, but the most important inspiration came on his last afternoon when he discovered at the back of the Metropolitan Museum a room full of Shaker furniture which greatly impressed him with its simple practicality and beauty of form.<br>
<br>Ercolani's takeover of the respected, but then loss-making, furniture business of Skull, in 1931, was totally unexpected, the offer and acceptance taking only twenty-five minutes. He sold off the unprofitable Skull properties and expanded the joint business. Much of Ercolani's custom came in the form of large outfitting contracts for government or commercial organizations, rather than from the retail trade. His sons were already involved in the business when the Second World War broke out, but they joined the Royal Air Force, returning with rank and decorations at the end of the war. Ercolani, who had taken British nationality in 1923, turned his factory over to war work, beginning with an order for 6 million tent pegs, and ultimately producing 36 million, made from small and malformed timber rejected as useless for more important products.<br>
<br>Towards the end of the war the Board of Trade was seeking to place a large order for cheap windsor-type chairs. The price offered ruled out the use of expensive beech wood, and demanded some inexpensive process of manufacture. Ercolani met the specification by making the chairs of elm, a wood previously considered unsuitable for furniture because of its long-term liability to warp, a problem which he cured by designing a kiln to dry it more effectively. He was the British Furniture Manufacturers' representative on the &#145;Britain can make it&#146; exhibition, which spurred him to design a suite of sideboard, table, and chairs based on the windsor style. Somewhat to his surprise, these items later appeared at the 1951 Festival of Britain.<br>
<br>From these beginnings Ercolani and his sons developed the successful Ercol range, which became a household name. He was one of the few British furniture manufacturers who succeeded in putting an individual stamp on a mass-market product and, in the face of denials that it was possible, he succeeded in combining machine production with true craftsmanship. Ercolani died at Wycombe General Hospital, High Wycombe, on 9 June 1976.<br>
