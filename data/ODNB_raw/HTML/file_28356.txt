<span class="headword">Vossius,  Isaac</span>  (1618&#150;1689), <span class="occ">philologist and author</span>, was born in the Collegium Theologicum in Leiden, the eighth of the nine children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28355/', "Gerardus Joannes Vossius (1577&#150;1649)")</script>, a professor, and his second wife, Elisabeth Junius (1585&#150;1659), daughter of Franciscus Junius sen. (1545&#150;1602). In May 1631 Gerardus Vossius and his family moved to Amsterdam. Together with his younger brother Gerardus, Isaac was educated at home by his gifted elder brother Dionysius and by private tutors. A talented and precocious student, he was able to assist the poet Joost van den Vondel in 1639 with the latter's translation of Sophocles' <span class="italic">Electra</span>. In November 1632 the French scholar Claude Saumaise (Claudius Salmasius) was invited by the curators of the university to settle in Leiden; five years later, in 1637, he was to take Isaac under his wing. Isaac never studied at the University of Leiden; he confined himself to his philological studies under Saumaise's personal tutelage. Stimulated and aided by his mentor, Isaac in 1639 produced an edition of a Greek text, the <span class="italic">Periplus</span> by the Greek geographer Scylax (fourth century <span class="smallcap">BC</span>), with a Latin translation and notes. Early in 1640 his edition of M. Junianius Justinus appeared with the Leiden Elzeviers.<h2>
<a name="Travels"></a>Travels</h2>In April 1641 Isaac Vossius set off on his <i>peregrinatio</i>. First he went to England, where in London the presence of his uncle Franciscus Junius, librarian of Thomas Howard, earl of Arundel, stood him in good stead. While he was there he also met Patrick Young, librarian of the Royal Library, and James Ussher, archbishop of Armagh and primate of Ireland. After a brief visit to Cambridge, Vossius crossed for France, where he arrived in Dieppe on 14 August 1641. In Rouen he met the jurist Claude Sarrau, <i>parlementaire</i> to the <i>parlement</i> of Paris, and in Paris he presented himself to Hugo Grotius. Vossius was often to be found in the Cabinet Dupuy, where hosts Pierre and Jacques Dupuy daily welcomed scholars from Paris and elsewhere. He must have made the acquaintance of most of the regular visitors there during the three months he spent in Paris in 1641: Ismael Boulliau, the philologist-mathematician, the philosopher Pierre Gassendi, the bibliophile Jean de Cordes, the jurist Jer&ocirc;me Bignon, Henri de Valois, Fran&ccedil;ois Guyet, and Gilles M&eacute;nage. On his travels, apart from associating with other scholars, Vossius spent most of his time in libraries, collating and copying manuscripts of classical texts, preferably Greek <i>inedita</i>. Vossius left Paris for Italy in November 1641. Four months later he arrived in Florence where he began working in the Biblioteca Laurentiana towards the end of February 1642. It was there that he copied Arrian's <span class="italic">Ars tactica</span> partly for the benefit of Saumaise, who had been commissioned by Stadholder Frederick Henry to write his <span class="italic">Militia Romana</span>, a work on military tactics. Later, during a second stay in Florence, Vossius also copied for Saumaise an extensive work on the same subject by Urbicius (both works are in the <span class="roman">Codex Mediceus</span> LV, 4). He furthermore copied an important manuscript containing the authentic text of Ignatius, to which James Ussher in London had directed his attention.<br>
<br>Vossius next visited Naples and its surroundings where he spent about two weeks, finding the city too beautiful to spend much time on study; from there he went to Rome about June 1642, where he worked mostly in the Barberiniana and in the Vaticana. In September 1642 Vossius returned to Florence, and at the end of December he travelled to Venice and to Padua, where he visited Gaspare Scioppio a few times. Although Venice did not have much to offer to a scholar, he stayed there some five weeks, during which time he also relished the famous carnival. He left Venice in March 1643 and barely managed to reach Milan, where he lay seriously ill for some time, as a result of which he was only able to work in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana for a limited time.<br>
<br>Vossius was back in Paris in July 1643. Soon he was staying in the home of Grotius, where he replaced Grotius's secretary Coenraad van Beuningen, who returned to Amsterdam. A year later, in August 1644, much to Grotius's regret, he left Paris to go home again, though not before first picking up a licentiate in law at Orl&eacute;ans in June. He travelled home via Caen in order to make the acquaintance of the learned theologian Samuel Bochart.<br>
<br>From October 1644 until December 1648 Vossius lived in the parental home in Amsterdam. In March 1646 his elder brother Matthaeus, historian to the provinces of Holland and Zeeland, died. Isaac succeeded his brother in this post in the same year and completed part 4 of the latter's <span class="italic">Annales</span>. The title &#145;historian&#146; Vossius came to regard more and more as an honorary title with an attendant allowance. Vossius now had the time to sort out and work up the material he had acquired on his travels. In 1646 he brought out with Blaeu in Amsterdam his edition of the letters of Ignatius as they had been transmitted in the <span class="roman">Codex Mediceus</span> LVII, 7. (He had never delivered the transcript of this manuscript in the Laurentiana to Ussher as Ussher had hoped.) Interest in this new edition was great, as the letters of Ignatius formed an important document, to which both Roman Catholics and Anglicans appealed to vindicate the early Christian nature of episcopacy in the contemporary debate on the presbyterian and episcopal church order. The protestant party tended to believe that the Ignatius epistles had been forged. Vossius convincingly defended the authenticity of the letters edited by him in a private polemic with the French theologian David Blondel. Contemporary and later philologists had much to say against the text of Vossius's edition. Vossius was not an outstanding textual critic: he copied and collated too hastily. When John Pearson later collected material for a new edition of the Ignatius letters he had the text of Vossius's edition&#151;on the latter's own advice&#151;compared once more with that of the <span class="roman">Codex Mediceus</span> LVII, 7, in Florence.<h2>
<a name="Stockholm"></a>Stockholm</h2>In summer 1648, while on a brief tour of the Southern Netherlands, Vossius received an invitation on behalf of Queen Kristina to present himself at the Stockholm court. Should Vossius wish to remain in Stockholm, the queen would consider which duties to confer on him at court, as he was known not to wish to hold any professorship. Vossius arrived in Stockholm on Sunday 21 March 1649; the next morning he was received by Kristina. During his audience with her Isaac addressed her in Latin; she answered him in Dutch.<br>
<br>Kristina and Vossius got on rather well together. Like the queen, Vossius was quick and witty in conversation, something which is borne out by a great many testimonies of people who knew him personally. On 28 May 1649 Kristina signed an order accepting her &#145;beloved, esteemed and highly learned Isaac Vossius&#146; into her service against an annual salary of 2000 riksdaler. With it he became Kristina's Greek tutor, succeeding Johannes Freinshemius.<br>
<br>The queen's library in the palace was continually enriched with war booty. In May 1649 for instance the art collections and books and manuscripts from the Hrad&#269;in in Prague arrived in Stockholm. Kristina also bought private libraries: after Grotius's death (he had died on his way back from Sweden, having been summoned there by Kristina) she bought his library from his widow, Maria van Reigersberch, for 24,000 guilders. In the meantime Vossius's father Gerardus Joannes had died on 17 March 1649. Isaac turned down the offer of succeeding his father at the Athenaeum Illustre in Amsterdam. His father's vast library he sold to Kristina for 20,000 guilders. Gerardus Vossius's library was placed separately in the royal library and remained under his son's supervision. Isaac's own library, too, was brought to Stockholm from Amsterdam. He did not place his library in his own room, but had it put separately in the court library so that the queen, too, might freely consult it. According to Isaac it was a fine library, not lacking in any classical author and counting more than 500 manuscripts. It was not, however, his entire library; he had left a collection of manuscripts at home.<br>
<br>In spite of the many affairs of state demanding her attention, Kristina still managed to reserve time for her studies, but to the disadvantage of her health. In spring 1650 she fell seriously ill, and recovery was slow. This illness put an end forever to the period in which Kristina under Vossius's guidance studied regularly and intensively, a period which lasted roughly from April 1649 to April 1650. But the expansion of her library continued through acquisitions of libraries and transcriptions of <i>inedita</i> of mainly Neoplatonic texts. During his travels Vossius had seen and noted down many <i>inedita</i> in libraries. He knew where to find Neoplatonic texts which had not yet been published and had them copied for her. Vossius also assisted the queen with her reading of these texts. In 1650 a Swedish copyist, Petrus Nicolai Rezander, was sent to Paris to copy Greek <i>inedita</i>. In summer that same year, Vossius himself also travelled to Paris to purchase manuscripts and printed books for the royal library. From Alexandre Petau he bought a proportion of his manuscripts&#151;probably around 2000&#151;for 40,000 livres.<br>
<br>A month after his return to Stockholm in September 1650 Vossius was appointed librarian. Freinshemius was reappointed <i>professor eloquentiae</i> in Uppsala; a year later he requested and was granted honourable discharge and received permission to return to his native Germany. As it was Kristina's wish that the printed books should receive more attention than before, it was decided that Vossius should continue to look after the department of manuscripts, but that somebody else should be in charge of the printed books. For this post Vossius recommended Gabriel Naud&eacute;, whom he had first met in 1643.<br>
<br>The Amsterdam rabbi Menasseh Ben Israel was a friend of the Vossius family. Unlike Isaac's father, who not only had a high personal regard for Menasseh but also esteemed his great learning, Isaac Vossius did not rate him very highly as a scholar: he considered Menasseh's views to be too speculative. In 1650 Menasseh came into contact with Queen Kristina through the diplomat Michel le Blon, who acted as her agent in Amsterdam. Menasseh requested le Blon to send the queen a copy of each of the works he had written. After consultation with royal librarian Isaac Vossius, Menasseh furthermore sent a collection of Hebrew books for the royal library. This collection, which the rabbi had valued at 900 guilders, fell into the wrong hands in Stockholm. Menasseh received not a single response nor any payment from the queen, and being a man of little means got into difficulties as a result. Isaac Vossius eventually paid Menasseh 900 guilders out of his private funds, an amount which he hoped to recover from the queen. In 1655 Menasseh dedicated his <span class="italic">Piedra gloriosa</span> to Vossius, as a token of gratitude for the generosities received from the Vossius family.<br>
<br>Among the foreign scholars whom Isaac Vossius had brought to the queen's attention were Nicolas Heinsius and Claude Saumaise. Both had been invited by the queen to come to Stockholm, but Saumaise greatly resented it that Vossius had recommended his enemy Nicolas Heinsius to the queen. As a result, he and Vossius became embroiled forever. Heinsius entered the queen's service about the beginning of March 1650, but when Saumaise arrived in Stockholm at the end of August, the queen granted him permission to be of service to her elsewhere, in Italy, buying books. Saumaise left Stockholm again for Leiden on about 9 September 1651. Earlier, in October 1649, Ren&eacute; Descartes had arrived in Stockholm by royal invitation, though prompted by the French envoy Pierre Chanut. The queen turned out to have little affinity with the Cartesian philosophy, while the French philosopher for his part had scant appreciation for the Greek which Vossius taught her. Descartes died in Stockholm on 11 February 1650, probably of a form of influenza.<br>
<br>Another arrival from Strasbourg, as Freinshemius before him, was Johannes Boeclerus. He accepted a professorship in Uppsala in May 1649, but soon came into open conflict with his colleagues and students. About July 1650 he took refuge in Stockholm, where in obedience to the queen's wishes he stayed until the beginning of 1652, when he was allowed to return to Strasbourg. From the beginning of September 1650 until that time, Vossius and Boeclerus were thrown together in Stockholm. Boeclerus disliked Vossius; virtually all accusations of theft of books and atheism levelled against Vossius find their origin in the slanders of Boeclerus and his friend Herman Conring, professor in Helmstedt.<h2>
<a name="Amsterdam"></a>Amsterdam</h2>At the end of January 1652 Vossius received permission to go to Amsterdam on leave. While in Holland he came into open conflict with Saumaise, who passed one of Vossius's seasoned letters to him on to Queen Kristina. On 4 May 1652 the unsuspecting Vossius returned from Amsterdam to Stockholm. At the Swedish border near Halmstad, Vossius was denied entrance by a messenger of the queen in retribution for his insulting behaviour towards Saumaise. His exile in Amsterdam lasted until the middle of August 1653, during which time he prepared an edition of Catullus containing text and commentary (this edition appeared in England only in 1684).<br>
<br>In August 1652 Vossius's close friend Coenraad van Beuningen was sent to Sweden by the states general as a special envoy. He was to keep the exiled Vossius informed about the events at the court in Stockholm. Like his friend, van Beuningen was a libertine, but one who opposed atheists. He informed Vossius about the then most offensive form of libertinism, atheism in the true sense of the word, to which Queen Kristina and Bourdelot had abandoned themselves. For Vossius this news was remarkable enough to pass on to Nicolas Heinsius almost verbatim.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Kristina had sent for Gabriel Naud&eacute; from Paris to replace Isaac Vossius. When Naud&eacute; arrived about the middle of September 1652, the library was reasonably ordered and usable. But then the queen had the rooms of the library vacated to afford accommodation to some ladies. All books were heaped together in one large room; the private library of Vossius and that of his father, which until then had been placed separately, became absorbed in the chaos of the large royal library.<br>
<br>Naud&eacute; and Bochart left Stockholm in June 1653. Naud&eacute; died on his way home. Pierre Bourdelot also left Sweden that same month, while Du Fresne alone remained behind at the queen's request. She had imparted to Du Fresne her decision to abdicate, and entrusted him with the task of secretly selecting collections from the royal library and the royal art collection which she wanted to take with her abroad following her abdication. At the same time she recalled Vossius to Stockholm, where he arrived about the middle of September 1653. Kristina allowed him to select a collection of books from the royal library as a first compensation for the loss of his own library and salaries due. This collection arrived in Amsterdam in two shipments, and included the <span class="italic">Codex Argenteus</span>, published by his uncle Franciscus Junius in 1665, as well as Hugo Grotius's <span class="italic">Historia Gotthorum</span>, which Vossius published with Louis Elzevier in 1655. Vossius left Stockholm together with van Beuningen in June 1654, before Kristina's abdication in Uppsala. In Amsterdam he was to await her further orders.<br>
<br>About the middle of August 1654 Kristina, then in Antwerp, sent for Vossius. He brought order to the collection of books which had arrived there packed in sixty large cases. Two catalogues were compiled under his guidance: the first containing the printed books and one category of manuscripts, the second catalogue exclusively manuscripts. They are kept in the Vaticana in one manuscript (Codex Vaticanus Latinus 8171, fols. 1<i>r</i>&#150;171<i>r</i>; fols. 174&#150;404<i>r</i>). This library was transported to Rome, where Kristina eventually settled. She would have been happy to take with her her librarian; Vossius, however, preferred to take his leave of her. This he did in September 1655; they were never to meet in person again thereafter. In 1655 Vossius moved to The Hague, where he lived together with his mother Elisabeth Junius and his uncle Franciscus Junius jun.<br>
<br>Vossius now turned his attention to chronology. As the basis of his scheme he took the chronology of the <span class="roman">Septuagint</span>, the ancient Greek translation of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, which differed in its chronology from the Hebrew original. In 1659 he published <span class="italic">Dissertatio de vera aetate mundi, qua ostenditur natale mundi tempus annis minimum 1440 vulgarem aeram anticipare</span>. A defence of the original Hebrew text and computation was at once undertaken by George Horn, whose treatise elicited <span class="italic">I. Vossii castigationes ad scriptum G. Hornii</span>. Other tracts on the same subject followed, and the views of Vossius were further contested by Bircherod in his <span class="italic">Lumen historiae sacrae veteris</span> (1687), and by John Milner in his <span class="italic">Defence of Ussher Against Cary and Vossius</span>. Vossius returned to the subject in his <span class="italic">De Septuaginta interpretibus eorumque translatione et chronologia dissertationes</span> (1661, appendix 1663; new edition 1665). Hulsius proceeded to vindicate the Hebrew text in his <span class="italic">Authentia S. textus Hebraei</span>, while Schook (followed in 1663 by Schotanus, and much later by Patrick Cockburn) attacked his theory of a local and partial deluge in <span class="italic">Diatriba qua probatur Noachi diluvium toti terrarum orbi incubuisse</span> (1662). The Royal Society, to whom Vossius sent several communications, thought highly of him; he was elected a fellow on 20 April 1664. The society's secretary, Henry Oldenburg, included him &#145;among the most ingenious and famous philosophers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 6.423). Among his more scientific tracts were <span class="italic">De lucis naturae et proprietate</span> (1662), in which he attacked Descartes' ideas on the nature of light, <span class="italic">De motu marium et ventorum liber</span> (1663), and <span class="italic">De Nili et aliorum fluminum origine</span> (1666).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">De motu</span> attracted considerable attention among his contemporaries. With the growing importance of maritime trade and exploration there was considerable speculation about the cause of tides. Vossius rejected the influence of moon, stars, or occult forces, arguing that the sun's heat was the single cause of tides, winds, and ocean currents. He explained that between the tropics the tides followed the sun, and winds blew in the same direction. But the continents formed a barrier to this movement and so the water was deflected north and south, which accounted for the ocean currents. The high tide on the side of the earth opposite the sun was the result of water rushing in to fill the hollow caused by the rise elsewhere. He explained that tides occurred 48 minutes later each day due to the lag following the rise, and that the same afface accounted for the bi-monthly maximum. In <span class="italic">De lucis</span> he relied on the readings of the mercury barometer to assess the likely height of the atmosphere, and he concluded <span class="italic">De motu</span> with a brief argument on its usefulness to predict storms at sea. In <span class="italic">De Nili</span> he attributed the Nile floods to the rains in Ethiopia, a controversial idea at a time when it was believed that there was insufficient rainfall on the continents to account for river flow. Archibald Lovel's translation of <span class="italic">De motu</span> as <span class="italic">A Treatise Concerning the Motion of the Seas and Winds</span> (1677) was intended to make Vossius's text available to a wider seagoing and mercantile community.<br>
<br>In 1666 and 1669 Vossius saw through the press the amusing collection of table talk called <span class="italic">Scaligerana</span>, and the similar collection entitled <span class="italic">Perroniana, sive, Excerpta ex ore Cardinalis Perronii</span>. In the early 1660s Vossius spent a good deal of time in Geneva and Paris, and in 1663 he received from the French king a handsome &#145;gratification&#146;, and a flattering letter alluding to his own and his father's services to learning. It was in Paris that Vossius first met Charles de Saint-&Eacute;vremond, the famous man of society, sceptic, and soldier. Saint-&Eacute;vremond sent enthusiastic reports of their meetings in his correspondence. In 1671 he wrote to Fran&ccedil;ois, mareschal de Cr&eacute;qui: &#145;I know one of the most learned men in Europe, of whom one may learn a thousand things, curious or profound; in whom, nevertheless, you will find a foolish credulity in every thing extraordinary, fabulous, or exceeding belief&#146;  (Katz, 156).<h2>
<a name="London"></a>London</h2>In 1670 the states of Holland finally refused to pay Vossius his salary as historian to the provinces of Holland and Zeeland (he had written nothing on the subject during the previous twenty years in the post). Offended at their lack of understanding, Vossius went to England in 1670 as a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of John Pearson, master of Trinity College, Cambridge, and later bishop of Chester. Their common interest was the vindication of the authenticity of the &#145;Eusebian&#146; epistles of Ignatius, in opposition to the views of Daill&eacute;, Saumaise, and Blondel, and when Pearson's <span class="italic">Vindiciae</span> appeared at Cambridge in 1672, <span class="italic">Isaaci Vossii epistolae duae</span> formed an appendix, together with his <span class="italic">Responsio ad Blondellum</span>. What is perhaps the most original of Vossius's works appeared anonymously at Oxford in 1673, under the title <span class="italic">De poematum cantu et viribus rythmi</span>, dedicated to Lord Arlington. The author retraces the ancient alliance between poetry and music, and insists on a strict adherence to the rules of prosody as opposed to the intuitive method.<br>
<br>Having previously embraced Anglicanism as most congenial to his beliefs (and doubts) Vossius was created DCL at Oxford on 16 September 1670 and was presented by Charles II to a vacant prebend in the royal chapel of Windsor (he was installed on 12 May 1673, in place of Thomas Viner). He was now frequently to be seen about the court. Evelyn met him at the lord chamberlain's at supper with the bishop of Rochester, at the houses of other prelates, and at Monmouth House. But it was not until 1675 and the arrival of the duchess of Mazarin in London that Vossius gained entry to the sort of intellectual centre he had known in Sweden. Saint-&Eacute;vremond visited the duchess at Windsor, St James's, or her house at Chelsea almost every day, and Vossius frequently attended with him. It was frequently observed of him that he knew all the languages of Europe, but did not speak one well, and that he was intimately acquainted with the manners and characters of all ages but his own. His style was held to be too disputatious, and his epithets were thought too erudite for the drawing-room. Mazarin's circle was known for freethinking, and anecdotes about Vossius's own scepticism, such as his habitual reading of Ovid during services, circulated widely. Yet he was by no means free from credulity, and Charles II echoed Saint-&Eacute;vremond's opinion when he remarked that Vossius would believe anything, if only it were not in the <span class="roman">Bible</span>.<br>
<br>Vossius next turned his attention to the highly controversial subject of the sibylline oracles, in <span class="italic">I. Vossii de sibyllinis aliisque quae Christi natalem praecessere oraculis</span> (1679). The oracles were ancient Greek prophetic verses which were thought to have predicted the coming of Christ, and thus provided a link between the biblical and classical worlds. The status of the verses&#151;whether true prophecies or forgeries of Greek or early Christian origin&#151;was much debated, and Vossius's conclusion that they were of ancient Jewish origin met with great hostility. Along with his controversial championing of the <span class="roman">Septuagint</span> over the Hebrew <span class="roman">Bible</span> (the latter was deemed infallible in England, as in other protestant countries), this work consolidated his reputation as a thorough, and in some cases, dangerous sceptic. He was answered first by Reiskius's <span class="italic">Exercitationes</span> (1688), and later by Fontenelle; meanwhile his position on the chronology of the <span class="roman">Septuagint</span> was being challenged by Richard Simon (<span class="italic">R. Simonis opuscula critica adversus I. Vossium</span>, 1685).<br>
<br>In 1685 Vossius published <span class="italic">Variarum observationum liber</span>, which contained a dissertation of interest, &#145;De triremium et liburnicarum constructione&#146;, which Graevius inserted in the twelfth volume of his <span class="italic">Thesaurus antiquitatum Romanorum</span>, a treatise, &#145;De origine et progressu pulveris bellici&#146;, and another opuscule, &#145;De antiquae Romae magnitudine&#146;. Throughout this work Vossius gave free rein to his capricious imagination and to his love of paradox. He passes an extravagant eulogy on the Chinese civilization, and tries to prove that the population of Rome was 14 million, and that its area was twenty times greater than that of Paris and London combined. (He also introduces some flattering remarks about Charles II and on the country of his adoption, but his alleged depreciation of the size of London elicited several replies, notably <span class="italic">London Bigger than Old Rome Demonstrated &hellip; Against Vossius, by De Soulign&eacute;</span>, 1701 and 1710.) Evelyn, who was delighted with their ingenuity, mentions several other short works, notably one &#145;<i>Peritachyploia</i>&#146;, on the subject of tacking in navigation, which was never published; he was also greatly diverted by a note of Vossius on a certain harmony which was produced in the East by the snapping of drivers' whips  (Evelyn to Pepys, 23 September 1685).<br>
<br>Among the labours of Vossius's last years were some annotations on the works of his father, particularly the <span class="italic">Etymologicon</span>. Some corrections by him were included in the 1695 edition of Anacreon, &#145;Variae lectiones ex notulis I. Vossii&#146; appeared in the Lucretius of 1725, and some notes by him were embodied in the edition of Hesychius of Alexandria, published at Leiden in 1746. He also made some notes on Arrian, which were included in the large edition of 1842.<br>
<br>Vossius fell ill during winter 1688&#150;9. According to the story told by Des Maizeaux and Nic&eacute;ron, he obstinately refused to conform to the usages of religion and receive the sacrament until two of his fellow canons urged that if not for the good of his soul he should comply for the honour of the chapter. He died at Windsor on 21 February 1689 and was buried there in St George's Chapel.<br>
<br>According to Wood, Vossius had accumulated &#145;the best private library, as it was then supposed, in the whole world&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3rd edn, 2.323). It included 762 manuscripts which his enemies described as &#145;spoils&#146;. A catalogue of these was drawn up by Paul Colomi&egrave;s; &pound;3000 was offered by the University of Oxford for the library in September 1710, but on 10 October it was sold to Leiden for 36,000 florins. Evelyn bitterly deplored the loss to the country. &#145;Where are our rich men?&#146; he asked. &#145;Will the Nepotismo never be satisfied?&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary and Correspondence</span>, 3.306, 308). Some of Vossius's correspondence, included in the d'Orville collection, was purchased by the Bodleian in 1805. The same library has the &#145;Codex Vossianus&#146;, a Latin psalter of the tenth century, in Anglo-Saxon characters. The British Museum has a Greek <span class="roman">Testament</span> (1620, fol.), with manuscript notes and readings by Vossius. Most of his books were included in the <span class="italic">Index librorum prohibitorum</span>, some of them, it is said, against the advice of Mabillon, the usual referee in such matters between 1680 and 1705. Vossius's correspondence with Heinsius comprises the third volume of the <span class="italic">Sylloges epistolarum</span> of Burmannus (1727), and other letters to the same correspondent are in the British Library (Add. MS 5158).<br>
