<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mellish,  Robert Joseph</span>, Baron Mellish  (1913&#150;1998), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 3 March 1913 at 63 Giffin Street, Deptford, the thirteenth of fourteen children (of whom only six survived) of John Mellish, docker, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Carroll. Close proximity to death in childhood was the trigger for a crusade to improve conditions for families in east London, and one of Mellish's causes in later life was the North-East Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board: &#145;half my brothers and sisters died from scarlet fever and meningitis&#146;  (personal knowledge). His father had taken a prominent part in the dock strikes of 1889 and 1912 and was a founder member of the Labour Party. Mellish himself joined the party at sixteen, two years after he had left St Joseph's Roman Catholic School, Deptford, to work as a clerk in the docks. He was active in the Transport and General Workers' Union, and in 1938 became a full-time official in its docks section. On 15 October in the same year he married Annie Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1912/13), daughter of George Warner, docker; they had five sons.<br>
<br>In 1940 Mellish was enlisted in the dockworkers' battalion of the Royal Engineers and served for much of the war in Burma as part of the &#145;forgotten&#146; Fourteenth Army. He ended the war as captain. One of the reasons for his later good relations with the tories in the House of Commons&#151;despite colourful verbal abuse in east London vernacular&#151;was that the knights of the shires saw him as exactly the genre of Londoner who fitted their idea of the quintessential working-class Labour MP. But another part of the tory acceptance of him was that decorated guards, cavalry, and naval officers such as William Whitelaw, Francis Pym, and Humphrey Atkins, successively his opposite number as tory chief whip, recognized that he and they had fought in the same war, side by side, against the same enemy.<br>
<br>On the unexpected resignation of the minister for food, Sir Ben Smith, in May 1946 and his decision subsequently to leave the House of Commons, Mellish was selected as Labour's standard-bearer in Rotherhithe, a constituency that had shrunk to a 22,000 electorate as a result of the blitz. He won the ensuing by-election, on 19 November 1946, by 7265 votes to 2821 for the Liberal Fred Martell and 1084 for the Conservative Freddy Burden, later MP for Gillingham. He held the seat (expanded in 1950 to Bermondsey) as a fiefdom for the next thirty-six years. His maiden speech, on 16 December 1946, was in support of the government's plans to nationalize transport. After the Labour losses in the general election of 1950 he got his foot on the ladder by being appointed parliamentary private secretary to George Strauss, minister of supply, and then, from January to November 1951, to George Isaacs, minister of pensions. Years later he would say: &#145;What matters is bleeding loyalty, especially when you know that the Minister is wrong!&#146;  (personal knowledge). He was also active in the London Labour Party, a raucous organization of which he became chairman in 1956 at the behest of Herbert Morrison.<br>
<br>In October 1964 Harold Wilson, as incoming prime minister, had the inspiration of teaming up Mellish with the Oxford intellectual Richard Crossman at the Ministry of Housing. Mellish was described as &#145;the best thing that ever happened to Crossman&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). The kind of issue that mattered to him was protection from eviction to deal with the Rachmanism of the time. Both at Housing and later as minister of public building and works, from August 1967, he supported the work of the Building Research Station, to combat dampness and hasten slum clearance. For seven eventful years from April 1969 he was Labour chief whip&#151;first in government, then from 1970 to 1974 in opposition, and again in government. As <span class="italic">The Times</span> obituarist put it, &#145;His appointment proved a master-stroke; his combination of warmth &hellip; and toughness gained the respect of Members throughout the parliamentary party and particularly among left-wingers&#146;. The truth was that the left felt inhibited with having a sustained animosity against a man with impeccable union working-class credentials. On several occasions he asked Wilson to move him to another post but each time he was persuaded to stay. He finally resigned in April 1976, having supported Michael Foot in the leadership contest following Wilson's resignation.<br>
<br>Mellish's final years in the Commons were dogged by controversy and beset with troubles in Bermondsey from hard-left &#145;yuppie&#146; incomers and the Militant Tendency, people who were moons apart from the dockers who had selected him four decades earlier. When Mellish announced in 1981 that he would not stand again for election Peter Tatchell, a leading figure on the hard left, was chosen by the local party as prospective candidate. Labour's National Executive Committee initially refused to endorse Tatchell's candidature but in the following year acquiesced. Mellish&#151;who was already facing disciplinary proceedings for supporting unofficial or independent labour candidates against left-wing official candidates at local elections&#151;resigned from the Labour Party and from the House of Commons, precipitating a by-election which was won by Simon Hughes, for the Liberal and Social Democrat Alliance.<br>
<br>Mellish was deputy chairman of the London Docklands Development Corporation from 1981 to 1985; it was his determination to devote himself full-time to this post that had led to his decision to leave the House of Commons. Following his retirement he was made a life peer, as Baron Mellish of Bermondsey. He sat as an independent, but according to one critic &#145;always voiced Thatcherite views&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>). Nevertheless he was (as he had been throughout his career) an outspoken pro-European. He was a keen supporter of Millwall Football Club, becoming its president. A leading Roman Catholic, he was made a papal knight of the order of St Gregory the Great in 1959. He was a devoted family man. In his last years he suffered from cancer and Parkinson's disease. He died at his home, Rectory House, West Street, Sompting, Sussex, on 9 May 1998; his remains were cremated. He was survived by his wife, Annie, and four of their five sons.<br>
