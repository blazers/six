<span class="headword">Stuart,  John</span>  (1813&#150;1877), <span class="occ">archivist and genealogist</span>, was born in November 1813 at Forgue, Aberdeenshire, where his father had a small farm. He was educated at Aberdeen University, and in 1836 became a member of the Aberdeen Society of Advocates. In 1853 he was appointed one of the official searchers of records in the Register House, Edinburgh, and in 1873 became principal keeper of the register of deeds at &pound;400 p.a. In 1854 he was appointed secretary of the Society of Scottish Antiquaries, and from that time he became the guiding spirit of the association. In 1839, along with Joseph Robertson (1810&#150;1866) and Cosmo Innes, he set on foot the Spalding Club, of which he acted as secretary until the close of its operations in 1870. Of the thirty-eight quarto volumes issued by the club, fourteen were produced under Stuart's editorship. Prominent among these were the two large folios entitled <span class="italic">The Sculptured Stones of Scotland</span>, published in 1856 and 1867, and important in their day. Another of the Spalding volumes was <span class="italic">The Book of Deer</span>, published in 1869, a reproduction by Stuart of a manuscript copy of the gospels which belonged to the abbey of Deer&#151;of great historical and linguistic value, especially with regard to the Celtic history of Scotland. Among the other works which Stuart prepared for publication by the Spalding Club were the three volumes of <span class="italic">Miscellanies</span> published in 1841, 1842, and 1849; <span class="italic">Extracts from the Presbytery Book of Strathbogie, 1631&#150;54</span>, published in 1843; <span class="italic">Extracts from the Council Register of Aberdeen, 1398&#150;1625</span>, two volumes, issued in 1844&#150;9; <span class="italic">Memorialls of the Trubles in Scotland and England from 1624 to 1645</span>, printed in 1850&#150;51; and <span class="italic">Notices of the Spalding Club</span>, prepared in 1871 as a record of its labours. At the final meeting, on 23 December 1870, Stuart was presented by the club with a piece of plate and his portrait, the work of George Reid.<br>
<br>Stuart contributed largely to the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland</span> (of which he was principal secretary), especially on the subject of Scottish crannogs. For the society he edited two volumes of ancient cartularies, entitled <span class="italic">Records of the Isle of May</span> (1868) and <span class="italic">Records of the Monastery of Kinloss</span> (1872).<br>
<br>Of Stuart's researches among old family records there remains the <span class="italic">Registrum de Panmure</span>, in two quarto volumes, printed by the earl of Dalhousie in 1874. At the instance of the historical records commission Stuart examined the charter chests of the Scottish nobility and furnished reports. Among the records at Dunrobin Castle he discovered the original dispensation for the marriage of Bothwell and Lady Jane Gordon. This find gave Stuart the opportunity of discussing, as he did in his volume, <span class="italic">A Lost Chapter in the History of Mary Queen of Scots</span> (1874), the law and practice of Scotland relating to marriage dispensations in Roman Catholic times.<br>
<br>For the Burgh Records Society Stuart edited two volumes of <span class="italic">Extracts from the Burgh Records of Aberdeen, 1625&#150;1747</span>, and he also edited an edition of <span class="italic">Archaeological Essays of the Late Sir J. Y. Simpson</span> (1872). In 1866 the University of Aberdeen conferred on him the degree of LLD. He was elected an honorary member of the Archaeological Institute and of the Society of Antiquaries of Z&uuml;rich and the Assemblea di Storia Patria in Palermo.<br>
<br>Stuart was twice married; no details about his first wife are known. He died at Crescent Villa, Ambleside, on 19 July 1877 and was survived by his second wife, Jane Stewart Ogilvie, and two daughters from his first marriage.<br>
