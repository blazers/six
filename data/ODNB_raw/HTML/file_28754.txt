<span class="headword">Warner, Sir  Edward</span>  (1511&#150;1565), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was the eldest son of Henry Warner (<i>d</i>. 1519), soldier, of Besthorpe, Norfolk, and Mary Blennerhasset. In 1542 Edward married Elizabeth, a daughter of Thomas Brooke, eighth Baron Cobham, and widow of Sir Thomas Wyatt (<i>d</i>. 1542); they had three sons, all of whom died in infancy. After Elizabeth's death Warner married in 1560 Audrey Hobart (<i>d</i>. 1580), daughter and heir of William Hare, of Beeston, Norfolk.<br>
<br>By 1537 Warner held a position in the household of Henry VIII, for which he was awarded tithes in Leicestershire. In 1543 he led six footmen in the army for Flanders and was then sent to Scotland, where he was knighted (18 May 1544) by the earl of Hertford for his service in the burning of Edinburgh. In Scotland he was the captain of 100 men. 1546 saw him brought before the privy council, with Lord Haward, to explain his &#145;indiscreet&#146; talk about the scriptures, although the two were dismissed. Later in 1546 he was involved in an inquiry into the arms of Henry Howard, earl of Surrey, which were held to demonstrate some threat to King Henry. In 1549 he was involved in the defence of Norwich against Ket's rebellion. He was appointed lieutenant of the Tower in October 1552. In April 1553 he was appointed (with others) to audit the king's ordnance. During Henry's and Edward's reigns he received many grants of ecclesiastical lands. In May 1540 he and Lord Cobham were granted the lands of a former Carmelite priory in Norfolk, and in 1549 chantry lands in Norwich and Yorkshire followed. In 1545 and 1547 he was MP for Grantham.<br>
<br>When Mary acceded to the throne, Warner was removed from his position in the Tower. He was hostile to the new regime, and sympathetic to the cause of Lady Jane Grey; indeed he held the Tower for Northumberland during the attempted coup. He was MP for Grantham in Mary's first parliament, where he stood for the protestant religion. When Wyatt's rebellion unfolded, the government monitored his activities; he may have been involved in discussions about the rebellion at an early stage. In January 1554 Simon Renard (Charles V's ambassador in England) gave the chancellor information that Warner intended to surprise the Tower. He was arrested on 25 January 1554 with the marquess of Northampton, and taken to the Tower. On 10 November 1554 he was indicted. However, the privy council allowed his wife to receive his revenues while he was in prison. On 18 January 1555 he was released on a surety of 300 crowns, and on 2 July 1555 granted a pardon. He was subsequently employed by the crown: in early 1558 he was sent on a mission to the Isle of Wight under Sir Thomas Tresham.<br>
<br>In November 1558, after Elizabeth's accession, Warner was reappointed lieutenant of the Tower. In September 1559 he was an assistant to the mourners at the obsequies of Henri II in London. He was MP for Great Grimsby in 1559. In his duties as lieutenant of the Tower he dealt with suspected spies and counterfeiters. Among his most important prisoners were the deprived Marian bishops; Lord Wentworth, late lord deputy of Calais, suspected of treason; and, in 1562, John Kele and James Golbourne. The latter were suspected of selling information about the English court to the king of Sweden. The most important prisoner he had to deal with was Katherine Seymour, countess of Hertford. She had clandestinely married Edward Seymour, a union that Elizabeth viewed with suspicion as an attempt to establish their claim for her throne. Warner was instructed to examine her in August 1561. Other duties included his appointment in November 1561 to survey all lands within 2 miles of London that had been formerly used for archery practice, but were now enclosed. He was to see that these were to be reinstated because archery practice was declining. However, he was dismissed from his post at the Tower, and spent a short time in prison, because he treated his prisoners with too much leniency. In 1563 he was MP for the county of Norfolk, and at the opening of the first session of that parliament he was one of the nobles who held a canopy over Elizabeth in her procession. He was sent to the Low Countries in 1565 to examine the state of English trade. Finally in November of that year he was nominated as a commissioner to examine measures for dealing with piracy. He died in Norfolk on 7 November 1565 and was buried in the church at Little Plumstead in Norfolk, his will ordering that his funeral should be conducted with little pomp. In the church there is a monument and inscription to his memory. In 1566 his brother Robert, his heir, was granted licence to enter upon his lands.<br>
<br>It is clear that Warner was a committed protestant. The first sign of his radicalism was in 1546, and his Calvinism is apparent in the manner of his funeral. Moreover his parliamentary patron in the earlier years was the second earl of Rutland, a committed protestant. It is thus surprising that he escaped any severe punishment in Mary's reign. However, although he was suspected of involvement with Wyatt, this was never proved. He was also a very competent military commander; this may have helped save him in Mary's reign, as Philip did not wish to alienate the nobility and gentry, especially if they could prove useful in a military capacity.<br>
