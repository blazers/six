<span class="headword">Longchamp,  William  de</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1197), <span class="occ">administrator and bishop of Ely</span>, probably born near Argenton, Normandy, was a son of Hugh de Longchamp, who was a servant of Henry II, farmer of the revenues of the honour of Conches, Normandy, at the time of his death (probably in 1187). Hugh held land in Herefordshire, including a knight's fee of Hugh de Lacy's honour, the marriage portion of his wife. Apparently, her father was a tenant of the Lacys. Although William de Longchamp's modest knightly background was typical of the &#145;new men&#146; whom the Angevins were recruiting into their service, chroniclers' complaints against his low birth are unusually harsh, repeating the charge levelled by Hugh de Nonant, bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, that Longchamp was the grandson of a peasant, &#145;who being of servile condition in the district of Beauvais, had for his occupation to guide the plough and whip up the oxen; and who at length to gain his liberty fled to the Norman territory&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chronica &hellip; Hovedene</span>, 3.142; <span class="italic">Gir. Camb. opera</span>, 4.418). He began his career as a clerk of Geoffrey Plantagenet, archdeacon of Rouen and later archbishop of York, then became chancellor of Richard, count of Poitou. When Richard acceded to the English throne in 1189 he named Longchamp royal chancellor, a title that he held until his death. He paid &pound;3000 for the office, and an increase in fees charged for sealing chancery documents may have been intended to provide funds for paying this fine. At the Council of Pipewell (15 September 1189) Richard I elevated four long-time royal servants to bishoprics; among them was Longchamp, who became bishop of Ely, being consecrated on 31 December 1189.<br>
<br>The king's first scheme for government of England during his absence on crusade broke down almost at once with the death in December 1189 of one of the two co-justiciars he had named, William de Mandeville, earl of Essex. Richard I then substituted William de Longchamp to serve alongside Hugh du Puiset, bishop of Durham. A second regency scheme was adopted at a council held at Nonancourt, Normandy, in mid-March 1190. The king named Longchamp chief justiciar of England, with Hugh du Puiset's authority confined to the lands north of the Humber. This, plus the fact of Longchamp's custody of the king's seal as chancellor, made his paramount authority clear.<br>
<br>By late spring 1190 Longchamp had left the king's entourage on the continent and returned to England to take control of the government. His custody of important castles reinforced his authority, and on 5 June Pope Clement III named him papal legate for England, adding to his power and prestige. As legate he presided over ecclesiastical councils at Gloucester on 1 August and at Westminster on 13 October 1190. Richard's new commission to Longchamp, dated 6 June 1190, failed to define the role of Hugh du Puiset, justiciar for the north; and Longchamp chose to bar him from any role in the central government, excluding him from the exchequer and requiring him to surrender castles in his custody. Longchamp acted vigorously as justiciar and chancellor in 1190. He took firm steps to restore order and do justice at York, following the massacre of the Jewish community there. He also organized a general eyre in the summer of 1190; and himself headed the panel of justices sitting at Westminster from Easter term 1190 to Easter term 1191. Again in 1190 Longchamp launched an expedition against Rhys ap Gruffudd, the most powerful prince in south Wales. And he made a concerted effort to raise as much money as possible for the king&#151;for example, setting up a special exchequer to collect the enormous debts owed to Aaron, the Jewish moneylender of Lincoln. Longchamp left his mark on the English chancery. He is probably responsible for the precise dating clauses of Richard I's charters, and for substitution of the &#145;plural of majesty&#146; for the first person singular&#151;innovations doubtless reflecting the chancellor's familiarity with the papal chancery's practice.<br>
<br>Despite Longchamp's ability as an administrator, as a low-born foreigner he lacked the respect of the English baronage. He caused resentment by his financial exactions and the extravagance of his entourage as he moved about the country. His imperious manner and his ignorance of English customs soon aroused their incipient xenophobia, and brought mocking descriptions of his personal appearance and scurrilous attacks on his private life, including accusations of homosexuality. An accusation about his public activity, probably unjust, was that he ignored his associate justiciars; they were actually playing an important part in the administration, as barons of the exchequer, royal justices, and sheriffs. Yet he did seek to insinuate his own men into the government; by autumn 1191 a dozen counties had new sheriffs selected by the chancellor, and among them were two of his brothers. But Longchamp's chief problem in governing the kingdom was the powerful position of the king's brother, John, count of Mortain, whose position, not only as a great magnate but as a likely inheritor of the English crown, presented insurmountable difficulties for the chancellor. John knew how to exploit baronial opposition to Longchamp's authoritarian rule. One source of friction was the succession to the archbishopric of Canterbury, vacant in November 1190. Longchamp had some ambition of securing election for himself, but John wanted a say in the election. A more significant source of conflict was custody of royal castles. Longchamp was determined to keep royal control over key castles within John's domains, and in 1191 he began preparing for combat, importing mercenary soldiers from overseas. Richard I did not deal with complaints against his justiciar until the late spring of 1191, when he sent Walter de Countances, archbishop of Rouen, to England with two letters that directed the chancellor and others to take counsel with him, and implied that the archbishop should have an authority equal to the chancellor's own. Such orders were certain to undermine Longchamp's position, which was likely to be weakened further by the prospect of losing his position as papal legate; for Clement III died on 20 March 1191, and his commissions died with him. By midsummer, however, the new pope, Celestine III, had confirmed him in that office.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Gerard de Camville, who had purchased the shrievalty of Lincolnshire and custody of Lincoln Castle from Richard I, had renounced the chancellor's authority and done homage to John. Longchamp then laid siege to Lincoln Castle, whereupon John occupied Tickhill and Nottingham castles, and commanded Longchamp to lift his siege of Lincoln, saying, &#145;It is not fitting to take their custodies away from law-worthy men of the realm &hellip; and hand them over to foreigners and unknown men&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chronicon Richardi Divisensis</span>, 30&#150;31). Walter de Coutances stepped forward at the end of April to act as mediator, and although both John and the chancellor appeared at the council at the head of large armed forces, the two opponents agreed to name arbitrators to settle the issue. Agreement was reached at a council at Winchester on 28 July 1191. There it was agreed that Gerard de Camville could keep his custody of Lincoln Castle and that John would surrender the castles he had taken. Also John obtained Longchamp's promise of support for his succession if the king died.<br>
<br>Another crisis soon followed, and led to Longchamp's fall from power and his exile from England. Fearful of the implications for his own authority if the king's half-brother, the bastard Geoffrey Plantagenet, archbishop of York, should return to England to take up possession of his see, Longchamp ordered the sheriff of Sussex to prevent Geoffrey from landing at any port under his jurisdiction. The resulting scandal, when Geoffrey's goods were seized by the constable of Dover Castle, and the archbishop himself was forcibly dragged from the church of St Martin's Priory in Dover, where he had taken refuge, gave John an opportunity to discredit Longchamp, and he convened a great council at Marlborough, accusing him of breaking the peace sworn at Winchester. The council summoned Longchamp to come before it at Loddon Bridge, between Reading and Windsor, on 5 October; and after some hesitation the chancellor duly appeared. Walter de Coutances finally revealed the contents of the two royal letters that he had brought from Sicily, and complained that Longchamp had never sought his counsel. The chancellor left the council to return to London, having heard a rumour that Count John was preparing to seize the city by force. He asked the citizens to bar the gates to the count, but they refused to obey and denounced him as a traitor. He then took refuge in the Tower of London, but surrendered after three days. John and the magnates followed him to London, where they reconvened, hearing accusations from Geoffrey of York and from Hugh de Nonant. On 10 October Longchamp came before the council, maintaining that Archbishop Geoffrey had been seized without his knowledge or consent and declaring his readiness to account to the last farthing for his spending of the king's money. When he refused to lay down the duties assigned him by the monarch, the council stripped him of his offices, and required him to hand over hostages for the return of all castles held by his dependants. The great council declared John supreme governor of the kingdom, and granted him custody of all royal castles.<br>
<br>Longchamp surrendered the Tower and Windsor Castle, and went to Dover in preparation for sailing to the continent. He was forbidden to leave England, however, and his efforts to escape in disguise made him a laughing-stock. He was variously described as having been caught fleeing in a monk's habit and in women's clothing, while a letter of Hugh de Nonant vividly depicts the fallen chancellor on Dover beach, dressed as a whore, being assaulted by a fisherman who had understandably assumed that he was encountering a prostitute. Eventually Longchamp sailed to Flanders on 29 October; he continued to Paris and then to Normandy. When he placed his diocese of Ely under an interdict and excommunicated his former colleagues at the exchequer, the archbishop of Rouen responded by seizing his episcopal estates and denouncing him throughout Normandy as an excommunicate. In 1192 Eleanor of Aquitaine persuaded the chancellor to withdraw the excommunication of his associate justiciars, and the archbishop to revoke his excommunication of Longchamp and restore his Ely estates to him. Having sent an agent to Palestine to inform Richard I of his fate, Longchamp returned to England in the spring of 1192, in an attempt to resume his duties as papal legate and to bribe John into supporting his restoration to his offices. John informed the bishops and barons meeting in a great council that the chancellor had promised him &pound;700; they then offered him a larger sum of 2000 marks, and Longchamp had to leave the kingdom. In February 1194 a council at Westminster wrote to the pope protesting against Longchamp's continued legation, and some time after that he lost his commission.<br>
<br>Richard I's capture on the journey from the Holy Land took Longchamp to England once more in the spring of 1193 on the king's order, to attend a council at St Albans where the raising of Richard's ransom was to be discussed. He brought with him a copy of the treaty between the king and the German emperor, and royal commands for a number of the king's English subjects to return with him to Germany as hostages to the emperor. The barons received him badly, and were unwilling to entrust their sons to him. The king's captivity led to other diplomatic missions by Longchamp. He was with Richard at Worms in late June 1193, when the emperor reopened the question of the amount of ransom to be paid. He left for an embassy to Mantes on 9 July to conclude a peace settlement between the English and French kings. Richard's release led to Longchamp's resumption of duties as chancellor, and also to royal favours. He received custody of the honour of Eye, and after a modest gift of 10 marks, was appointed sheriff of Essex and Hertfordshire, a post he held until 1196. Longchamp continued to serve on diplomatic missions; he negotiated the truce of Tilli&egrave;res with Philip Augustus (23 July 1194) and returned to the emperor's court in July and November 1195. He died at Poitiers at the end of January 1197 (probably on the 28th, but perhaps on the 31st), on his way to Rome for negotiations about Richard's quarrel with the archbishop of Rouen over the king's construction of Ch&acirc;teau Gaillard on land of his see, and was buried at the abbey of Le Pin.<br>
<br>William de Longchamp had a number of brothers who followed him to England to seek their fortunes. Stephen, who became a steward in the royal household and accompanied Richard I on crusade, and Osbert and Henry, both of whom acted as sheriffs in the 1190s, followed William into the service of the crown. Robert, a monk, became successively prior of Ely and of St Mary's, York. A nephew and niece made profitable marriages, while his sister Richeut married Matthew de Clere, whom Longchamp appointed constable of Dover Castle. Another sister, Melisend, is also known to have come to England. A man of considerable education and culture, Longchamp was one of a number of Anglo-Norman canonists active in the late twelfth century, composing a treatise <span class="italic">Practica legum et decretorum</span>. His friends included such prominent writers as Nigel of Canterbury, who addressed to him a work warning against the courtier's life, <span class="italic">Contra curiales et officiales clericos</span>, and Peter of Blois, who wrote to Hugh de Nonant to complain of his treatment of the fallen chancellor. Richard Barre, a member of his household, dedicated to him a compendium of passages from the <span class="roman">Old</span> and <span class="roman">New</span> testaments arranged by topics. Described at the height of his power as &#145;Caesar and more than Caesar&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gir. Camb. opera</span>, 4.399), Longchamp suffered resentment and humiliation as a result of the very ability that raised him to greatness. He was probably also the first Norman to be regarded as a &#145;foreigner&#146; by members of the aristocracy in post-conquest England.<br>
