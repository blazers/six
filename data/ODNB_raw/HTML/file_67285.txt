<span class="headword">Dick,  George Williamson Auchinvole</span>  (1914&#150;1997), <span class="occ">pathologist and virologist</span>, was born on 14 August 1914 in Glasgow, the second of three sons of the Revd David Auchinvole Dick (1881&#150;1964) and his wife, Blanche Hay, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Spence (<i>d</i>. 1945). His younger brother, Sir John Alexander Dick (1920&#150;1994), was sheriff principal of Glasgow and Strathkelvin. Educated at the Royal High School, Edinburgh, and at the University of Edinburgh, he graduated MB ChB in 1938 and followed this with BSc (hons. path.) in 1939, being awarded the Buchanan medal.<br>
<br>Initial ideas of a career in obstetrics were changed by the outbreak of the Second World War and service as a Royal Army Medical Corps pathologist in east Africa command. The challenge of infectious diseases and their control appealed to Dick, and at the end of the war he transferred to the colonial medical research service and was seconded to the Rockefeller Foundation Yellow Fever Research Laboratory at Entebbe, Uganda. In 1941 he married Brenda Marian Cook (<i>b</i>. 1916), who joined him at Entebbe, where their first child was born. He spent five productive years there with pioneer American virologists R. M. Taylor, K. C. Smithburn, and others as colleagues. These were exciting times and many new viruses were isolated, mostly by the inoculation of mice. Uganda S and Zika viruses were mosquito borne viruses related to yellow fever virus that caused mild disease in man. Another, Mengo encephalomyelitis virus, proved to be a mouse virus related to poliomyelitis virus which demonstrated its human pathogenicity by infecting Dick, although fortunately the encephalitis was mild and transient.<br>
<br>After his Entebbe period the award of a Rockefeller Foundation Fellowship enabled Dick to visit the Rockefeller Institute, New York, and Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, where he enrolled at the school of hygiene and public health and graduated master of public health in 1949. He also received a gold medal for his MD at the University of Edinburgh in the same year. From 1951 to 1954 he joined the division of bacteriology and virology at the National Institute for Medical Research in Mill Hill, where he published several papers on mouse hepatitis viruses with C. H. Andrewes, J. S. F. Niven, A. W. Gledhill, and F. B. Bang. Colleagues who had the good fortune to be initiated into the mysteries of tropical virology by George Dick during this period were struck by the breadth of his knowledge and his enthusiasm for research.<br>
<br>Dick was now ready to head a department of his own and this he did by becoming professor of microbiology at Queen's University, Belfast, where he remained from 1955 to 1965. His research fields there included poliomyelitis, measles and its variant form, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, whooping cough, and multiple sclerosis. When live attenuated virus vaccine was first introduced for poliomyelitis it was feared that virus reversion to virulence might occur with consequent spread of the disease. Dick, appreciating the advantages of live attenuated vaccines from his knowledge of poliomyelitis and yellow fever, realized that the risk was very small and had no hesitation in giving live polio vaccine to his four-year-old daughter, causing excited press comment at the time. In Africa he had seen smallpox outbreaks and recognized the need for Jennerian vaccination there but at the annual general meeting of the British Medical Association in 1962 he called for the abandonment of infant vaccination against smallpox in the UK on the grounds that there it caused more sickness and deaths than smallpox itself. The Ministry of Health later accepted this view, the point becoming purely academic following the eradication of smallpox virus.<br>
<br>In 1966 Dick transferred to the Middlesex Hospital, becoming Bland-Sutton professor of pathology in the University of London, and director of the Bland-Sutton Institute, a challenging task with a considerable administrative burden, carried with his customary energy. His research interests at this period included Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and Marburg virus infections, and he was called upon to act as an expert witness in court cases. In 1973 he became assistant director of the British Postgraduate Medical Federation and postgraduate dean, south-west Thames regional health authority. His duties were to see that training kept pace with the new advances in current medical science.<br>
<br>Dick also found time in a busy life to publish <span class="italic">Immunisation</span> (1978), later reissued as <span class="italic">Practical Immunisation</span> (1986), <span class="italic">Immunology of Infectious Diseases</span> (1979), and <span class="italic">Health on Holiday and other Travels</span> (1982). From 1973 to 1981 he was also emeritus professor of pathology, honorary lecturer, and honorary consultant at the Institute of Child Health, Great Ormond Street. He also served as an examiner at medical schools in the UK, Dublin, Nairobi, Kampala, Riyadh, and Jiddah. These academic appointments did not prevent him from becoming involved with other organizations such as Amnesty International, whose aims and objectives he shared. He was president of the Institute of Medical and Laboratory Technicians, 1966&#150;76, member of mid-downs health authority, Sussex, 1981&#150;4, and his work on behalf of libraries was recognized by his being made an honorary fellow of the Library Association. Perhaps the recognition that gave him greatest pleasure was to be named outstanding alumnus in public health by Johns Hopkins University in 1986 and hero of public health by its school of hygiene and public health in 1992.<br>
<br>Genial and outgoing in nature, Dick was always very good company. He was a founder fellow of the Royal College of Pathologists, a member of council from 1970 to 1973 and its treasurer from 1973 to 1978. As one of the duties of the treasurer was to buy the wine, he attended and passed the examination in a wine appreciation course, with consequent benefit to the college cellar. A son of the manse and of independent spirit, he set up the Rowhook Medical Society which met at his home in Sussex, where matters of moment in medicine and the control of infectious diseases were debated. His personal contributions to this field were considerable, and not fully appreciated during his lifetime. He died from cancer of the prostate at Midhurst, Sussex, on 3 July 1997, and was cremated. He was survived by his wife, Brenda, four children, Bruce, Alison, Caroline, and John-Mark, and nine grandchildren.<br>
