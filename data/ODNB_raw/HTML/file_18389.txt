<span class="headword">Mavor,  William Fordyce</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseuds. </em>W. F. Martyn, Numa]</span>  (1758&#150;1837), <span class="occ">author and educationist</span>, was born on 1 August 1758 at New Deer, Aberdeenshire, the elder son of John Mavor (1726&#150;1786), farmer, and his wife, Elizabeth Low (1735&#150;1791). His family, which had numbered judges and exchequer officials in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, had, by Mavor's time, &#145;dwindled&#146; to being small farmers, who further risked their fortunes by coming out for the Stuarts in the rising of 1745. He was educated at New Deer and Turriff, and at the age of seventeen set out, with only a competency in Latin, to make his fortune in England. After staying for a time in London with a Jacobite cousin, who had become a prosperous city merchant on his release from the Tower, he obtained a post as assistant master at Thomas Hunter's private school at Burford in Oxfordshire. Here, while apparently giving satisfaction since he remained in Burford for seven years (1775&#150;82), he commenced his writing career.<br>
<br>At nineteen Mavor brought out <span class="italic">Parnassian Springs</span> (1777), a youthful collection of poetry. Two years later he published <span class="italic">Universal Stenography</span> (1779), a system of shorthand which ran to ten editions. Meanwhile he was ghost-writing guides and histories for Harrison, a London publisher. Considered &#145;remarkably handsome&#146;  (Blagdon, 23), he was already making contacts at Oxford&#151;with the Balliol Scots, and the Jacobites and high tories at the King's Arms. He was also preparing to take holy orders, and in October 1781 was made deacon by the bishop of Oxford at Christ Church Cathedral. Plans were already afoot to start a school of his own, and in the following year Mavor opened the Woodstock Academy, where &#145;Youth&#146; were to be &#145;genteely boarded and carefully educated&#146;  (<span class="italic">Jackson's Oxford Journal</span>, January 1782). The school was a success, and on 17 October 1782 Mavor married, at Shipton under Wychwood, Ann Harris (<i>d</i>. 1822), daughter of the host at the Royal Oak, Loughborough corner; they had seven children by 1789.<br>
<br>At the outset Mavor's Woodstock career was largely dependent on patronage from members of the Marlborough family and their friends. He was ordained priest in 1784, and in time curacies became available, notably at Kiddington, where Thomas Warton, the poet laureate, was rector. Presentations followed: the vicarage of Hurley (1789), Tysoe in Warwickshire (1790), and later Bladon-with-Woodstock (1810), along with private chaplaincies to the earl of Dumfries and the earl of Moira. In 1787 Mavor was made an honorary freeman of Woodstock, and two years later he became a member of the city council and master of Woodstock grammar school; he was awarded an honorary LLD by Aberdeen University in the same year.<br>
<br>Mavor was an extraordinarily industrious author and published a spate of guides, grammars, miscellanies, a sequence of admirably abridged tours, travels, and histories, a women's magazine, and a newspaper, the <span class="italic">Oxford University and City Herald</span> (1806), as well as numerous essays on education. A few of his works were published under his pseudonyms, W. F. Martyn and Numa. His ideas on education were liberal; &#145;Dry lectures seldom leave any lasting impression,&#146; he wrote, &#145;but convey the moral you wish to inculcate through an interesting story &hellip; and the effect is seldom lost&#146;  (W. F. Mavor, <span class="italic">A Father's Gift to his Children</span>, 1807, x). In 1787 he brought out <span class="italic">The British Nepos</span>, which consisted of short, lively biographies of famous Englishmen from Alfred to John Howard; it ran to fifteen editions. The following year his eldest son, who was at Charterhouse, fell ill, and to entertain him Mavor wrote <span class="italic">The Lady's and Gentleman's Botanical Pocket Book</span> and <span class="italic">Elements of Natural History</span>, both published in 1799; they were written in a suitably genteel style so as to bring no blush to the youthful cheek. The <span class="italic">Elements</span> went through several editions and was translated into French as <span class="italic">Le buffon des enfants</span>.<br>
<br>In 1801 Mavor published his most famous work, <span class="italic">The English Spelling Book</span>. To appeal to children it had fine woodcuts by Thomas Bewick, and simple and amusing moral stories for them to read. It ran to 500 editions, was translated into French and Hindi, and by 1823, at its 284th edition, had sold over 2 million copies. In 1806 the board of agriculture asked Mavor to write a survey of Berkshire. Undertaken at a time of great agrarian unrest as a result of low wages and high corn prices due to Napoleon's blockade of the English ports, his <span class="italic">General View of the Agriculture of Berkshire</span> (1809) is remarkable as much for its sympathetic attitude to the agricultural poor as for its interest in modern farming methods. As a farmer's son, Mavor was well acquainted with the sufferings of agricultural workers.<br>
<br>Meanwhile civic honours accumulated. In 1808 Mavor was elected mayor of Woodstock, and in 1811 the duke of Marlborough appointed him rector of Woodstock, a position he had long desired. He celebrated his success by having his portrait taken by James Saxon, who had recently painted Sir Walter Scott. His appearance was &#145;intelligent, strongly impressed with lines of thought&#146;, though he had a florid complexion and a figure &#145;somewhat inclined to corpulency&#146;  (Blagdon, 23). This was perhaps unsurprising, for though a &#145;sworn foe to licentiousness&#146;, detesting &#145;every species of slavery&#146;, he also &#145;gloried in liberty&#146; and was &#145;extremely social in his habits&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>In 1822 Ann Mavor died. The marriage had not been happy, and the following year Mavor married Harriet Segrave (1788&#150;1875), and started a second family. In the years that followed he continued as rector, founded the Woodstock Floral and Horticultural Society and a lending library, introduced free vaccination for the poor, planted trees, and in 1834 became mayor of Woodstock for the tenth time. He died at Woodstock rectory on 19 December 1837, active to the last. His library, which was a fine one, was sold in Oxford, and he left &pound;9000 to his wife and daughters. He was buried at Woodstock church where he is celebrated by a commemorative plaque.<br>
