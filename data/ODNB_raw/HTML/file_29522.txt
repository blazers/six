<span class="headword">Williams,  John</span>  (1753&#150;1841), <span class="occ">mining entrepreneur and banker</span>, was born on 23 September 1753 in Lower Cusgarne, Cornwall, the eldest son of Michael Williams (1730&#150;1775) and his wife, Susanna (1732&#150;1814), granddaughter of John Harris of Higher Cusgarne and his wife, Elizabeth, only daughter of John Beauchamp of Trevince, head of an ancient Cornish family. He became a leading figure in a dynasty of businessmen involved in the Cornish mining industry whose success made them one of the wealthiest and most influential families in Cornwall. Their involvement with the industry began with Williams's great-great-grandfather, James Williams (<i>d</i>. 1673) and his brothers Davey and Richard, who came to Cornwall from Shropshire to profit from the developing metal mines; James's grandson John (1685&#150;1761) and John's youngest son Michael Williams followed them.<br>
<br>Williams attended Truro grammar school. Following the death of his father in 1775 he inherited a little more than &pound;1000 and was employed as purser, manager, and bookkeeper of the Wheal Maiden mine. However, as the industry grew apace Williams's involvement in mines increased. By 1779 he was acting as agent to about twenty-two mines, running his operations from the &#145;copper office&#146; at the counting house of Wheal Damsel near St Day. The duties of superintending a large number of mines led Williams to move from his home at Burncoose to Scorrier, at the other end of the parish of Gwennap, where he built Scorrier House. As a staunch Methodist, Williams also had Wheal Rose Chapel built near his new home. On 23 January 1776 at Kenwyn, Cornwall, he married Catherine (1757&#150;1826), daughter of Martin Harvey of Kenwyn. They had five sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>As well as superintending mines, Williams purchased shares in many mines, and he was so successful that he came to control the majority of mines in the Gwennap area. His business interests also diversified. By the end of the century he leased and worked sulphur mines in co. Wicklow, Ireland, and was involved in the tin-smelting industry in Cornwall. In 1806, after purchasing the manor of Calstock in east Cornwall, he developed the manganese industry in that area. In 1810 he became a partner in the Cornish Bank at Truro, and in 1812 he and members of the Fox family of Falmouth contracted with the government to build the breakwater at Plymouth, employing the engineer John Rennie (1761&#150;1821). The success of this project was aided by Williams's knowledge of tides, currents, and the locality. In 1813 members of the Williams and Fox families entered into a partnership with Collan Harvey to develop the harbour at Portreath in Cornwall, which was of strategic importance in the trade of copper ore and coal between Cornwall and south Wales. Williams had long expressed an interest in copper smelting. In 1822 he and his sons formed a partnership with Pascoe St Leger Grenfell and Lewis Fox, originally for the production of copper and the copper-zinc alloy &#145;yellow metal&#146; at Burncoose. In 1823 the partnership took over the Rose Copper Works in the Swansea valley. This firm, after various changes in partners, later became the largest in the industry under the name Williams, Foster &amp; Co. Williams retired from business in 1828, though his three surviving sons maintained the family connection with the mining and smelting industries and related business activities.<br>
<br>Through his direct involvement in the industry Williams established a reputation as a leading authority on mining, such that between 1795 and 1800 he received a visit from the Bourbon princes (later Louis XVIII and Charles X of France). However, he is also well known for his apparent precognition on 2 or 3 May 1812 of the assassination of the chancellor of the exchequer and prime minister, Spencer Perceval, eight or nine days before the event. He dreamt three times the same night that he saw a man shot in the lobby of the House of Commons, whom he was told was Perceval. The dreams left such an impression that the next day he discussed with some friends whether he should go to London to warn Perceval. They dissuaded him, in case he was thought to be a fanatic. However, after the assassination Williams met government officials at the home of John Rennie, and later he wrote an account of the event which was included in the biography of Perceval written by Perceval's grandson, Spencer Walpole.<br>
<br>In 1832, at the age of seventy-nine, and six years after his first wife's death Williams married a Miss Edwards, who was twenty-five, apparently to the disapproval of his family. They lived in Sandhill House on his Calstock estate, where Williams had retired. Williams died at Sandhill on 17 April 1841, survived by his wife. Of his children, John (1777&#150;1849) was a member of the Society of Friends and was elected to fellowships of both the Linnean Society and the Royal Society; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/98421/', "Michael Williams")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51947/', "Williams, John Charles")</script>] was the member of parliament for the western division of Cornwall from 1853 to 1858; and William (1791&#150;1870) was created a baronet in 1866.<br>
