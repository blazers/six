<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Miller,  Max</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Thomas Henry Sargent]</span>  (1894&#150;1963), <span class="occ">comedian</span>, was born on 21 November 1894 at 43 Hereford Street, Brighton, the second of five children of James Sargent, builder's labourer, and his wife, Alice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> West. After a childhood marked by considerable poverty and a much disrupted education he left school at twelve, barely literate. He worked in Brighton as milk roundsman, tailor, and golf caddy and spent a short period in London as a motor mechanic. Inspired by the song-and-dance routines of black-face music-hall act G. H. Elliott, he began singing in local public houses, accompanied by his father on the piano, and joined an amateur concert party in 1913. After volunteering for the army in 1914 he was posted first to India, once again joining a concert party, and then in 1915 to Mesopotamia, where he was temporarily blinded by shellfire. After being discharged in 1918 he returned to Brighton and, as Harry Sargent, turned professional with Jack Sheppard's Concert Party as a light comedian. Here he met (Frances) Kathleen Marsh (<i>b</i>. 1897/8), a contralto and child impersonator, and they married on 17 February 1921: in the same year, and at her suggestion, he assumed the stage name Max Miller. As well as working in revue he increasingly concentrated on stand-up comedy, appearing as a solo music-hall turn and adding the distinctive Cheeky Chappie to his billing matter. Miller's rise was steady rather than dramatic, but a first booking at the London Palladium in 1929 boosted his career significantly and his appearance at the 1931 royal variety performance symbolized his arrival at the top of his profession.<br>
<br>Six feet tall with very blue eyes and a good physique, Miller embellished his natural advantages with an outrageously eye-catching costume consisting of multicoloured plus-fours&#151;most famously he wore red, white, and blue at the 1937 royal variety performance&#151;set off by white shoes and white trilby. He also exuded a boastful self-confidence on stage, exemplified by such catchphrases as &#145;This is clever stuff I am giving you lady&#146;. However, his greatest gifts were his sense of timing, use of silences, winks, and gesture, and above all what <span class="italic">The Times</span> referred to as &#145;his engaging intimacy&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). Often working from very close to the edge of the stage and drawing audiences in through continual asides and direct address, he created a rapport, almost a comic conspiracy, between performer and audience that has rarely been equalled.<br>
<br>By the 1930s, sexual innuendo had become Miller's stock-in-trade. It was delivered both through jokes (supposedly selected from his &#145;white&#146; or &#145;blue&#146; books, according to the level of indelicacy) and short comic songs which he accompanied on the guitar, a feature originally developed during a South African tour in 1932. Many commentators spoke of a sense of danger when Miller performed, an almost tangible testing of boundaries. This was heightened by a certain sexual ambiguity, with audience howls at his stage garb and rather feminine make-up being met with the challenging cry &#145;Well, what if I am?&#146;. His act offended some managements, with the Finsbury Park Empire fining him for a quintessentially &#145;blue book&#146; Millerism concerning &#145;the girl of eighteen who swallowed a pin but didn't feel the prick until she was twenty-one&#146;  (East, 105). However, Miller's popularity and the fact that he was deemed acceptable enough to play royal variety shows in 1931, 1937, and 1950 (his act suitably, although not totally, toned down), suggests that he articulated a strong strain of sexual knowingness within British culture. Although he played throughout Britain and made several foreign tours, he was most frequently seen and most popular in London and the south-east, his speech apparently too fast for some provincial audiences. Despite his Brighton roots (and, initially, accent) he was often seen as the embodiment of &#145;a real Cockney&#146;  (<span class="italic">Performer</span>, 18 Nov 1937), and in this context he perhaps helped construct certain notions of popular metropolitan style and attitude.<br>
<br>Miller continued to play in revue virtually throughout his career, with <span class="italic">Apple Sauce</span> (1940), also featuring Vera Lynn, a particular success. However, his tendency to dominate the stage and a penchant for extended ad libs sometimes limited his effectiveness and tried the patience of fellow actors. He made his screen d&eacute;but with a much praised cameo portrayal of a song-plugger in the 1933 version of J. B. Priestley's <span class="italic">The Good Companions</span>. Although he was to make another thirteen feature films up to 1943, with the exception of <span class="italic">Educated Evans</span> (1936) his output was generally commercially and critically disappointing. He played too much to the camera (his success in the <span class="italic">Good Companions</span> owed something to director Victor Saville's distracting him with a dummy camera) and tended to reproduce his stage persona rather than developing character. Miller was a regular broadcaster on Radio Luxemburg and on the BBC, although his humour was a constant source of worry. He was &#145;faded&#146; and subsequently banned for five years by the BBC in 1944 after fears that he was about to repeat a joke for which he had already been severely chastised.<br>
<br>Miller's career declined gradually from the late 1940s. In the immediate post-war period American comedians dominated the major London variety theatres&#151;Miller deliberately over-ran in the 1950s royal variety performance in protest at the length of time allotted to Jack Benny&#151;and in the 1950s the advent of television, which Miller never mastered, proved virtually terminal to the industry. His 1957 live long-playing recording <span class="italic">Max at the Met</span> showed a man still capable of outstanding performances but in September 1959 he suffered a heart attack; he performed only infrequently from then on&#151;his final stage appearance was at Folkestone in December the following year. Apart from a few recording sessions he spent a rather solitary retirement in Brighton.<br>
<br>A talented golfer, Miller also enjoyed keeping parrots, gardening, and riding. He was not notably popular with his fellow performers. Alongside his dominating personality on stage, he was deemed to be excessively mean, although friends and family claimed that he was quietly generous to various individuals and favourite causes. His wife, Kathleen, was hugely influential in organizing and managing his career (she answered fan mail and even signed his autographs, partly to disguise his poor educational levels) but he felt dominated by her and enjoyed a close relationship with Ann Graham, usually described as his &#145;organizational secretary&#146;, from the 1930s. He died on 7 May 1963 at his home, 25 Burlington Street, Brighton, from complications following influenza, and was cremated at the Downs crematorium, Brighton, on 11 May. Although an increasingly marginal figure at the time of his death, subsequent critical reassessment has secured Miller's reputation as probably the greatest stand-up comedian of his generation.<br>
