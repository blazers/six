<span class="headword">Brookes,  John Henry</span>  (1891&#150;1975), <span class="occ">educational administrator and craftsman</span>, was born in Oliver Street, Kingsley Park, Kingsthorpe, Northampton, on 31 January 1891, the only son of Robert Henry Brookes (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1866) and his wife, Annie Watts, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dykes (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1869). His father worked in the local shoe trade as a foreman boot clicker but later became a technical instructor in Northamptonshire and Leicestershire. Brookes went to Northampton grammar school in 1902 and moved to the Wyggeston Grammar School in Leicester in 1905 when his father took up employment in the area. He attended Leicester School of Art and Crafts between 1909 and 1914, qualifying as an art teacher. Between 1913 and 1916 he attended summer schools of the Guild of Handicrafts at Chipping Campden, learning the art of silversmithing under George Hart, who had a farm nearby. As a conscientious objector during the First World War Brookes had to undertake farmwork and may have done this at Hart's farm. After a spell teaching at the Leicester School of Art and Crafts, Brookes taught at Penistone grammar school in the West Riding of Yorkshire and undertook extramural work for Sheffield University.<br>
<br>On 7 October 1919 Brookes married Helena Victoria Mary, the daughter of Charles Henry Tyack, an innkeeper and market gardener in Harvington, Worcestershire, and returned to the Cotswolds, which he always found a source of artistic inspiration. He worked as a sculptor with Alec Miller in the Guild Workshops at Chipping Campden until 1924, supplementing his income by teaching, and he first went to Oxford about 1922 to teach local stonemasons to carve. Brookes's art training and craft workshop experience encouraged him in 1928 to apply for and secure the post of headmaster of Oxford School of Art. The school shared cramped premises with the city technical school in Church Street, St Ebbe's, but he threw himself into the job, teaching up to three classes an evening and launching a school of architecture in 1929 in a &#145;borrowed&#146; studio. With the co-operation of Oxford University Press he began day release classes for employees in the printing trade. From the first he tried to bridge the artificial division between art and technical education and, although he claimed that he only applied for the job because he knew the place better than anyone else, he was a natural appointment as principal of the newly merged Schools of Technology, Arts and Commerce in 1934. He managed a difficult merger very astutely, paying tribute to the &#145;loyalty, goodwill and unselfishness&#146; of his new team  (Brookes collection, first annual report of the Combined Schools of Technology, Arts and Commerce, 1934&#150;5), and he put his ideas into practice by establishing, in the face of some opposition, a combined department of architecture and building. The University of Oxford recognized his early achievements with an honorary MA in 1935.<br>
<br>The removal of the Oxford municipal secondary school to the new Southfield School in 1935 provided space in Church Street for day release classes and the Junior Technical School. Student enrolments rose from 966 in 1930 to 2334 by 1941&#150;2 and Brookes became a master of improvisation, utilizing no fewer than nineteen buildings scattered around Oxford in 1944. He campaigned ceaselessly for new buildings and the city council compulsorily purchased a site for a new college opposite the former workhouse in Cowley Road in 1936. Accusations of extravagance delayed development and the outbreak of the Second World War put paid to the scheme just as work was about to begin. Emergency engineering workshops were built by 1941 and temporary huts gradually filled the rest of the 2&frac12; acre site. With a predicted student population of 8000 from the city and its surroundings, the inadequacy of the pre-war scheme was evident by 1943 and the city council entered into negotiations for all or part of the Cowley Road Hospital site. Frustrated there in 1947, the city went on to purchase 33 acres of land on Headington Hill from the Morrell estate by 1949.<br>
<br>Oxford city council's subsequent rejection of the scheme for a new technical college on the site in September 1950 was a bitter blow for Brookes but he vowed to fight on and revised plans were at last approved in July 1952. Lord Nuffield laid the foundation stone of the new College of Technology, Art and Commerce in April 1954 and the first students moved into the completed school of engineering in September 1955. Brookes retired the following summer, before all the buildings were finished, but if he regretted the fact he expressed only joy that &#145;those of us who had survived the lean years &hellip; were now allowed to set foot inside the promised land&#146;  (Henry, 20). The Junior Technical School from St Ebbe's was resited next door to the college as Cheney School in 1954 and the rest of Brookes's scattered empire moved to the Headington campus by 1961. The demand for elementary courses then led to the formation of a separate college, the nucleus of the Oxford College of Further Education, in the old Cowley Road buildings. Brookes had helped to make all these developments possible and he was a worthy recipient of the OBE in 1953.<br>
<br>Brookes admitted that a career in administration had forced him to neglect his artistic talents but he was an accomplished silversmith, wood carver, and expert in lettering, and a fine photographer who was president of the Oxford Photographic Society for many years until 1962. Stone carvings that he undertook for Coventry Cathedral while working with Alec Miller were destroyed in the Second World War but a carving above St Alban's Church door in Oxford recalls his skill as a sculptor. He was a master of pen-and-ink drawing, publishing many examples in the <span class="italic">Oxford Times</span> and in books such as <span class="italic">Country Corners</span> (1969) and <span class="italic">Mid-Oxfordshire Churches</span> (1970); these sketches he described not as art but as &#145;reports of things which I love&#146;  (<span class="italic">Oxford Mail</span>, 11 Oct 1992). His creative skills were seen in work as varied as title headings and drawings for the wartime newsletter <span class="italic">Oxford Siren</span>, and in the design for nurses' badges at Littlemore Hospital in 1958.<br>
<br>Small of stature, Brookes was recalled by a colleague, Anthony Hawksley, for &#145;his bright sparkling face &hellip; and his dapper, impeccably-dressed figure&#146;  (Addison, 54). Sir Basil Blackwell delighted in his &#145;simple and cheery sincerity&#146;  (ibid., 71). Others remarked on the unassuming, almost self-effacing manner which disguised his tenacious sense of purpose and an ability to be as firm as a rock when the occasion demanded. When controversial meetings loomed he identified his supporters and worked effectively behind the scenes to prepare the ground. In 1941 he was described as &#145;an ideal chairman&#146;, tactful, helpful, and with a gift for summarizing discussions in a precise and well-structured way  (<span class="italic">Oxford Siren</span>). These talents and his commitment to public service led to his election as chairman of many local societies and he was a leading Rotarian. He was appointed a magistrate in 1946, serving as chairman of the Oxford bench between 1960 and 1963. Always the teacher, he ran a flourishing art class for prisoners in Oxford prison while he was JP.<br>
<br>Rising at 5.30 a.m. and blessed with good health until late in life, Brookes still found time for home and family. His married life with Helena had begun in a condemned rented cottage but the couple were later able to afford a more comfortable Cotswold house. Moving to Oxford with their two children, Joan and Peter, they acquired a newly built detached house in The Slade, Headington, in 1930 and this property, known as the Gate House, remained their home until 1975. Brookes looked after the sizeable garden himself and it was apparently the pride of the neighbourhood.<br>
<br>After a short illness Brookes died in the Churchill Hospital, Headington, Oxford, on 29 September 1975 and was cremated at Oxford crematorium on 3 October. In a commemorative volume published in 1979 Stuart Addison remarked that Brookes's achievement was the enriched lives of thousands of young people. His legacy also lay in the college that went on to become Oxford Polytechnic and then a university in 1992. A competition was held to suggest a fitting name for the new institution, and Olive Gibbs described the eventual choice of Brookes as &#145;little short of inspirational&#146;  (<span class="italic">Oxford Mail</span>, 6 Oct 1992). The name Oxford Brookes University keeps alive the memory of a remarkable man.<br>
