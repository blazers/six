<span class="headword">Doherty,  John</span>  (1797/8&#150;1854), <span class="occ">trade unionist and political radical</span>, was born in Ireland but his exact date of birth is not certain. He came from a labouring family and he himself began work in the local cotton industry at the age of ten. In 1816 he joined the increasing flow of Irish migrants to Britain, and worked as a cotton spinner in Manchester. From the early days he seems to have become involved in trade union activities, and for his part in the Manchester strike of 1818 he was sent to prison for two years in 1819.<br>
<br>At this time Doherty was still a rank-and-file militant, but quickly, as the 1820s moved along, he came to be recognized as the outstanding trade union leader in Lancashire in the textile industry. He always remained a Catholic, with a remarkable capacity for organization, straightforward, provocative oratory, and a markedly shrewd political instinct. His mentor in the early years was William Cobbett, and although in his political radicalism Doherty went beyond Cobbett, the attack upon &#145;Old Corruption&#146; always remained an essential part of his attack upon contemporary society. As with many of his contemporaries in the 1820s, Doherty came to accept a version of &#145;the right of the labourer to the whole produce of his labour&#146;&#151;an analysis of bourgeois society that developed out of the writings of William Thompson (1775&#150;1833) and his contemporaries.<br>
<br>By 1829 Doherty had succeeded in bringing together most of the country's cotton spinners into the Grand General Union of Operative Cotton Spinners, and, although it had disappeared by 1831, it was an important stage in the heightening of class-consciousness among certain groups of working people. In the early months of 1830 he broadened his vision with the establishment of the National Association of United Trades for the Protection of Labour and during the next four years he was at the centre of the many radical and union initiatives that were such a notable feature of the period. He was especially important in the Society for National Regeneration, and he was a major influence in the coming together of Owenism and trade unionism which culminated in the Grand National Consolidated Trades Union of February 1834.<br>
<br>Throughout his radical and union career Doherty produced a considerable number of journals and periodicals. They included <span class="italic">The Conciliator</span>, the <span class="italic">Voice of the People</span>, the <span class="italic">United Trades' Cooperative Journal</span>, the <span class="italic">Poor Man's Advocate</span>, and the <span class="italic">Herald of the Rights of Industry</span>. This last, which was published weekly from early February 1834 until the end of May, has become the best-known of Doherty's publications and is the least personal of all of them. Much of the <span class="italic">Herald</span> was a sustained defence of the campaign for factory reform led by John Fielden, as well as of Fielden's general ideas. None of Doherty's publications lasted very long, but they were an important part of the general ferment of radical ideas in the years leading up to the Chartist movement.<br>
<br>Doherty married an English girl, Laura, a milliner, in 1821, and according to the 1841 census there were four children of the marriage, two sons and two daughters. Doherty had a quick temper, and in 1835 was involved in an incident that became quite well known and was used against him. On the night of 8 July he returned home just before midnight to find that his wife had locked him out. There was a physical confrontation and Doherty was charged at the New Bailey with assault. His wife was induced not to give evidence (she too had been guilty of assault) and Doherty was discharged. The incident continued to surface, much exaggerated, during the next few years.<br>
<br>As a means of livelihood compatible with his politics, Doherty set up as a publisher, bookseller, and printer in Manchester from 1832, and he seems to have remained in this business until his death. His great days were over by the middle of the 1830s, although he was still active, on a much reduced scale, until at least the middle of the next decade. In 1838 he made an important statement of evidence before the select committee on workmen's combinations. He died aged fifty-six, almost forgotten, in New Bridge Street, Cheetham, Manchester, on 15 April 1854.<br>
