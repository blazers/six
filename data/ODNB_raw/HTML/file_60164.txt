<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Garvey,  Marcus Mosiah</span>  (1887&#150;1940), <span class="occ">pan-African nationalist leader</span>, was born on 17 August 1887 in St Ann's Bay, Jamaica, the last of two surviving children of Malcus Mosiah Garvey, stonemason (1838&#150;1920), and Sarah Jane Richards (1847/1852&#150;1908), a farmer and domestic servant. His father was a descendant of the maroons, fugitive Africans from the era of slavery. Marcus (baptized Malcus) received a good elementary education. He became apprenticed to the printer Alfred E. Burrowes in his early teens, later moving to Kingston where by eighteen he was the youngest foreman printer in Jamaica. His activities expanded into journalism, public speaking, trade unionism, and politics. In 1910 he came third in an all Jamaican oratorical contest. In 1908 Garvey led a pioneering printers' strike. He became assistant secretary of the important National Club. In 1910 he travelled to Central and South America, where he mixed work with travel and political activism. He published newspapers in Costa Rica and Panama.<br>
<br>Garvey toured Europe in 1912&#150;14, visiting Scotland, Ireland, France, Italy, Spain, Austria, Hungary, and Germany. He settled in London, speaking regularly at Hyde Park's speakers' corner, labouring on the London docks, frequenting the public galleries of the House of Commons, attending law lectures at Birkbeck College, and working for the <span class="italic">African Times and Orient Review</span>, edited by an Egyptian, Dus&eacute; Mohamed Ali, a leader of London's Muslim community. Garvey's peripatetic lifestyle and slender resources brought him to the verge of destitution, but he was able to avoid repatriation as a pauper and departed for home on 17 June 1914. He arrived in Jamaica on July 8 and started the Universal Negro Improvement and Conservation Association and African Communities (Imperial) League (usually rendered UNIA) days later. The UNIA emerged from Garvey's realization, enhanced by his travels, that African peoples were everywhere in dire straits and in need of organized uplift. Stories relayed to him on board ship by a Jamaican returning home from southern Africa filled him with a sense of urgency. His simultaneous reading of the American educator Booker T. Washington's autobiography, <span class="italic">Up from Slavery</span>, convinced him that self-reliance should be the key to reversing the fortunes of his suffering race.<br>
<br>The fledgeling UNIA articulated both Jamaican and international objectives. The former included the provision of education and jobs and the rehabilitation of fallen women. International objectives included helping to develop Africa and the establishment of a powerful central African nation. The organization immediately became a quasi-literary society with debates, recitations, and oratorical contests. It fed the hungry and visited the sick. It sought employment for the unemployed. Plans to set up an industrial school modelled after Washington's Tuskegee Institute led Garvey into correspondence with Washington and a fund-raising tour of the United States.<br>
<br>Garvey arrived in Harlem, New York, on 23 March 1916. Within a year he had toured the country and returned to Harlem. There he built a following as a street corner orator. He then moved his meetings indoors and by 1918 had made his decision to shift UNIA headquarters to New York. In 1918 Garvey began the <span class="italic">Negro World</span>, by the early 1920s the world's most widely circulated African newspaper. In 1918 the Negro Factories Corporation appeared, to found and run several UNIA businesses. The Black Star Line Steamship Corporation, the most spectacular of UNIA businesses, was launched in 1919. The UNIA acquired its own meeting place, Liberty Hall, on 138th Street, Harlem. Attendance at weekly meetings sometimes ran into the thousands. UNIA auxiliaries included the Black Cross Nurses, the paramilitary Universal African Legions, and the women's military unit, the Universal African Motor Corps. Children were organized into the UNIA Juveniles.<br>
<br>The organization divided the world into districts run by commissioners, with organizers criss-crossing each district. By the early 1920s membership was estimated by Garvey in the millions. There were about 1200 branches in more than forty-one countries. The UNIA attracted not only masses of people, but also many prominent persons. These included the <span class="italic">Negro World</span>'s editors T. Thomas Fortune and John Edward Bruce, two of African America's most distinguished journalists; the landowner Isaiah Morter from British Honduras, who bequeathed the UNIA $100,000; Adelaide Casely-Hayford, the outstanding Sierra Leone educator; several leaders of the African National Congress in South Africa; the top leadership of the Trinidad Workingmen's Association; Gabriel Johnson, mayor of Monrovia, Liberia; <span class="italic">Negro World</span>'s literary editor, William H. Ferris, a graduate of Harvard and Yale; and others.<br>
<br>In the United States the UNIA continued to complement its political work with extensive cultural activity. Garvey's movement is one of the principal originators of the Harlem renaissance of the 1920s, with the <span class="italic">Negro World</span> an important outlet for poetry, literary criticism, book reviews, and the like. Augusta Savage, a major African American sculptor and UNIA member, made a bronze bust of Garvey. In the midst of this activity Garvey was married to Amy Ashwood (1895/1897&#150;1969) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67673/', "Garvey, Amy Ashwood")</script>], lecturer and activist, on 25 December 1919, not long after an attempt on his life. The marriage was short-lived. In 1922 he married Amy Euphemia Jacques (1896&#150;1973), journalist and author. Both women were Jamaicans.<br>
<br>Garvey's movement represented the nationalist wing of the pan-African struggle. He accordingly advocated &#145;race first&#146;, which insisted that Africans must put their racial self-interest first in historical writing, literary criticism, religion, self-reliance, and nationhood, or political self-determination. The culminating point in Garvey's early rush to prominence was his First International Convention of the Negro Peoples of the World, held in August 1920. The opening night's ceremonies in New York hosted 25,000 people from around the African world. The delegates adopted a declaration of rights of the black peoples of the world and a universal Ethiopian anthem, and declared red, black, and green to be the colours of the race.<br>
<br>By 1920 Garvey was probably the world's best-known person of African descent and his UNIA had become the largest pan-African movement ever. Success, however, engendered great hostility. Integrationists such as W. E. B. DuBois of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (who preferred interracial organization to the all-black UNIA) and communists (who preferred class first to race first) worked assiduously for his downfall. The most powerful opposition came from the governments of the United States and Europe. British and French administrations banned the <span class="italic">Negro World</span> in Africa and the Caribbean, imprisoned Garveyites and denied Garvey entry into such places as Bermuda and the Bahamas. They collaborated with Liberia in thwarting Garvey's efforts to relocate his headquarters there. Despite this, some governors and presidents extended to Garvey the courtesies of a head of state on his travels.<br>
<br>The Black Star Line collapsed in 1922 as a result of poor management and under-capitalization. But Garvey's most devastating setback came with his imprisonment in the USA in 1925 on a politically motivated charge of mail fraud. His sentence was commuted by President Calvin Coolidge in 1927, followed by immediate deportation to Jamaica.<br>
<br>It was during the litigation and imprisonment that Amy Jacques Garvey edited her husband's most important work, <span class="italic">The Philosophy and Opinions of Marcus Garvey, or, Africa for the Africans</span>. This was originally published in two separate volumes in 1923 and 1925 but later became available in a single volume. <span class="italic">The Tragedy of White Injustice</span> and <span class="italic">Poetic Meditations of Marcus Garvey</span> appeared in 1927; both were collected, together with Garvey's other poetry, in <span class="italic">The Poetical Works of Marcus Garvey</span>. Garvey's secret course of instruction for his top organizers in 1937 was published only in 1986, as <span class="italic">Message to the People: the Course of African Philosophy</span>.<br>
<br>Garvey arrived back in Jamaica in December 1927 to the most massive welcome accorded anybody in Jamaica's history up to that time. There he published <span class="italic">The Blackman</span> and <span class="italic">New Jamaican</span> newspapers and the <span class="italic">Black Man</span> magazine. He ran an entertainment business, wrote plays, and held international conventions in 1929 and 1934.<br>
<br>The Garveys spent five months in England in 1928. After being turned away by fifty hotels in London they secured lodgings at Castleton Road, West Kensington. From here Garvey established a close relationship with Ladipo Solanke and the West African Students Union (WASU), for whom he rented a hostel in West Kensington. Jomo Kenyatta, later independence ruler of Kenya, was among the hostel's residents. From London the Garveys journeyed to France, Belgium, and Germany. At Geneva, Garvey delivered a petition to the League of Nations.<br>
<br>In 1929 Garvey founded the People's Political Party. He was gaoled by judges in Jamaica at the start of his campaign for the legislative council. They alleged that he compromised the dignity of the judiciary by promising to end unfair judgments motivated by bias. Garvey lost his bid for this council (elections to which were based on undemocratic colonialist arrangements which disfranchised most of his followers). He was, however, elected to the Kingston and St Andrew corporation council from gaol in 1929.<br>
<br>Garvey emigrated to London in 1935 and lived there until his death in 1940. He hoped that a presence in a major world capital would make it easier to revitalize a movement weakened by his absence from the USA. From his office at 2 Beaumont Crescent, West Kensington, he published the <span class="italic">Black Man</span>, visited Canada in 1937 and 1938, and toured the Caribbean in 1937. He again spoke regularly at Hyde Park, where he was heckled by younger Marxist activists like C. L. R. James and George Padmore. Amy Jacques joined him from 1937 to 1938 with their two young sons, Marcus jun. and Julius, both born in Jamaica.<br>
<br>Garvey died of cardiac failure at 53 Talgarth Road, Hammersmith, London, on 10 June 1940 after a series of strokes. Wartime conditions made it impossible to ship his body home so it was placed in a vault in catacomb no. 317, Kensal Green Roman Catholic cemetery, London. Amy Jacques's efforts to repatriate the remains at the war's end were thwarted by Amy Ashwood, who obtained a court injunction. His remains were finally shipped home for burial in Kingston in 1964 for ceremonies making him Jamaica's first national hero.<br>
<br>Though Garvey's name was expurgated from history books for many years, popular interest in him remained strong. Jamaica's Rastafarian religion made him a prophet. With the black power movement in the 1960s came a great upsurge of popular and scholarly interest. Some of those who joined or sympathized with Garvey's movement in their youth were now leaders of independence and civil rights struggles. These included Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana and Elijah Muhammad of the USA. Children of Garveyites, among them Malcolm X and congresswoman Shirley Chisholm, were now leaders of the post-Garvey generation.<br>
<br>In 1956 the Kingston and St Andrew corporation erected a bust of Garvey, and in 1957 independent Ghana named its Black Star Square in his honour. In ensuing years Garvey was celebrated on stamps, currency, plaques, and statues by the Cameroon and Jamaican governments and the Organization of American States. Statues were erected in St Ann's Bay and San Fernando, Trinidad. The London borough of Tottenham dedicated a Marcus Garvey Library in 1987.<br>
<br>The Garvey centenary commemoration of 1987 saw a proliferation of popular and governmental celebrations all over the world, probably unmatched by the acclaim extended to any other pan-African historical figure.<br>
