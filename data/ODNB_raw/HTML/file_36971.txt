<span class="headword">Wilson,  William</span>  (1875&#150;1965), <span class="occ">physicist</span>, was born on 1 March 1875 at Goody Hills, near the village of Mawbray on the Solway coast of Cumberland, the eldest in the family of seven sons and four daughters of W. O. Wilson, a farmer, and his wife, Isabella Ewart. His ancestors for some generations had also been farmers. His education began in the village school of Holme St Cuthbert where he had a master of outstanding ability, John Routledge. Although his reading at that time was mainly in scientific literature, his intention was to take up a career in agriculture. He gained the Longcake scholarship of &pound;40 a year for three years when he was not quite fourteen years of age, and in 1889 went to the Agricultural College at Aspatria, west Cumberland, as a weekly boarder.<br>
<br>Wilson became a free life member of the Highland and Agricultural Society at the age of seventeen and a year later, in 1893, was awarded a studentship at the Royal College of Science in London. Here he studied agriculture and geology, and pursued mathematics privately in the museum library. The most valuable parts of his studies were the lectures on astronomy by J. Norman Lockyer and Alfred Fowler, and those on physics by Arthur R&uuml;cker and William Watson. Unfortunately he did not attend sufficient lectures to qualify for the associateship, having spent the autumn of 1895 ploughing in the Lowenghyll.<br>
<br>Wilson left the Royal College of Science in 1896 without a degree and took teaching posts at a Towcester school, at Beccles College in Suffolk in 1898, and for two terms, at Craven College in Highgate. During this period he determined to study in a German university and, after teaching at the Berlitz Schools of Languages at Elberfeld, Dortmund, M&uuml;nster, Barmen, and Cologne, he matriculated as a student of mathematics in the University of Leipzig in 1902, where he studied under Carl Neumann and Otto Weiner. His earliest research was an experimental study of the photoelectric effect, for which he was awarded the degree of doctor of philosophy <i>summa cum laude</i> in 1906. While at Leipzig, Wilson met his future wife, Rose Blanche Lucy, the daughter of Henry Heathfield of Stoke Canon in Devon. They married in 1909 and later had one son, W. F. H. F. Wilson, who subsequently practised as a solicitor in Hereford.<br>
<br>On his return from Germany in 1906 Wilson was appointed an assistant lecturer in the Wheatstone Laboratory at King's College, London, under Professor H. A. Wilson. William Wilson experimented on the emission of electrons from hot bodies until 1917, but his interests began to move towards the new theoretical developments in relativity and quantum theory. His studies of Hamiltonian mechanics under Carl Neumann had prepared him to appreciate the quantum theory of spectra introduced by Niels Bohr and to put forward a considerable generalization of the quantum conditions. Wilson's famous formula, &int;<i>p<sub>i</sub></i><b>d</b><i>q<sub>i</sub></i> = <i>n<sub>i</sub>h</i> was published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span> in 1915 and 1916. Encouraged by J. W. Nicholson (then professor of mathematics in King's College), he applied this formula to the elliptic orbits of the hydrogen atom. The same results were arrived at shortly afterwards, and independently, by Professor Sommerfeld. In 1922 Wilson generalized his earlier formula by modifying the mechanical momentum <i>p<sub>i</sub></i> by adding the electromagnetic momentum <i>eA<sub>i</sub></i>, where <i>e</i> is the electronic charge and <i>A<sub>i</sub></i> a component of the electromagnetic vector potential. This result is the foundation of the quantum theory of the emission and absorption of radiation.<br>
<br>In 1917 Wilson was awarded the degree of DSc in the University of London. In 1920 he was appointed to a readership in the physics department of King's College and in 1921 to the Hildred Carlile chair of physics at Bedford College, London. His later writings were on the relation between the general theory of relativity and wave mechanics, but his most important contribution to science in this period was a three-volume work, <span class="italic">Theoretical Physics</span> (1931&#150;40), which embodies many original and profound insights. He was elected FRS in 1923. He retired in 1944 and died at home, 60 Aylestone Hill, Hereford, on 14 October 1965.<br>
<br>Wilson was a tall, broad shouldered man with a large brown moustache. He walked and moved with a striking and unusual manner, almost as if he were about to draw and flourish a rapier. His bright and piercing eyes would shine with enthusiasm as he expounded his scientific theories. He ever conveyed an immense vitality and friendliness. He was patient and sympathetic and always ready to find time to elucidate difficulties.<br>
