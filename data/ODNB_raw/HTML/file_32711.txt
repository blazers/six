<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Darbishire,  Helen</span>  (1881&#150;1961), <span class="occ">literary scholar and college head</span>, was born in Oxford on 26 February 1881, the second of the three children of Samuel Dukinfield Darbishire (1846&#150;1892), physician to the Radcliffe Infirmary and coroner to the university, and his wife, Florence Eckersley (<i>d</i>. 1917). Both parents were natives of Manchester, where the Darbishires' home in the mid-nineteenth century was a centre of Liberal and Unitarian society, frequented by such distinguished figures as William and Elizabeth Gaskell and James and Harriet Martineau; Helen's grandfather, the elder Samuel Dukinfield Darbishire (1796&#150;1870), a solicitor, befriended J. A. Froude and employed him as tutor to his daughters in 1849.<br>
<br>Helen Darbishire was at first educated privately with her cousins in Penmaen-mawr in Caernarvonshire, where the family lived from 1889 to 1892, during her father's illness. After his death, she went to the Oxford high school. In 1900 she entered Somerville College, Oxford, as a Pfeiffer scholar, and in 1903 graduated with a first class in the recently instituted honour school of English. One of her teachers was Ernest De Selincourt, the first university lecturer in English, and a cousin by marriage of her mother; he became, as she wrote later, &#145;a lifelong friend &hellip; I owe more to his mind and spirit than can be said&#146;. After working as a visiting lecturer at Royal Holloway College, London University, between 1904 and 1907, she returned to Somerville in 1908 as English tutor, and remained there for thirty-seven years. She became a member of the college council in 1913, a fellow in 1921, and she was university lecturer in 1926&#150;31, principal in 1931&#150;45, and honorary fellow in 1946. She was also the first woman to be chair of the faculty board of English. Her only absence from Oxford of more than a few months was as visiting professor at Wellesley College, Massachusetts, in 1925&#150;6.<br>
<br>As a tutor, Helen Darbishire was quick to recognize and foster any genuine response to literature, however immature; and if her teaching was not always immediately stimulating (some pupils found her remote), it was felt as a slow-growing, durable influence, sustained by the continuing example of her own meticulous scholarship. One of the future directions of her own studies is seen in an early publication, the exemplary edition in 1914 of Wordsworth's <span class="italic">Poems in Two Volumes</span> (1807), which shows her characteristic power of combining close attention to textual matters with sensitive interpretation. She assisted De Selincourt in his work on Wordsworth until his death in 1943, when she took responsibility for the remaining three volumes (1946&#150;9) of the five-volume Clarendon edition of Wordsworth's <span class="italic">Poetical Works</span>. This may be regarded as her greatest achievement.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Helen Darbishire was laying the foundations of her own monumental edition of Milton, with <span class="italic">The Manuscript of Milton's &#145;Paradise Lost&#146;, Book I</span> (1931), which broke new ground by demonstrating, through close study of the handwriting of the manuscript, that Milton used spelling and punctuation to emphasize the meaning and the movement of his verse. After <span class="italic">The Early Lives of Milton</span> (1932), however, publication of work other than articles and reviews was long delayed by her duties as principal&#151;an office unsought, and even unwelcome to her modesty and reserve, but one which was fulfilled loyally and efficiently. Before and during the Second World War she actively assisted displaced foreign scholars. Her tenure of office saw new developments in the college's constitution and additions to its buildings, including the east quadrangle (now named after her) and the college chapel. A selection of her regular addresses was posthumously published in 1962; their keynote was Wordsworth's &#145;We live by admiration, hope, and love&#146;.<br>
<br>In retirement, after completing the Clarendon edition of Wordsworth, Helen Darbishire returned to her work on Milton. Believing that &#145;an editor must take his courage in his hands and exercise his critical judgment&#146;, she set out to offer a text of <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span> &#145;which represents more nearly than any previous printing &hellip; what Milton would have achieved if he had had his sight&#146;  (Willey, 410). Although the new text (published in 1952) received criticism, it has remained a foundation for subsequent editions. The second, less controversial volume of <span class="italic">The Poetical Works of John Milton</span>, containing the rest of his poems, appeared in 1955, and an edition of the complete poems in the <span class="roman">Oxford Standard Authors</span> series was published in 1958.<br>
<br>Helen Darbishire expressed the wisdom accumulated from her extensive work on the editions of Wordsworth and Milton in the 1949 Clark lectures at Trinity College, Cambridge, on Wordsworth (published as <span class="italic">The Poet Wordsworth</span>, 1950), and in the 1951 James Bryce memorial lecture at Somerville, on <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span> (published 1951). Further work on the manuscripts of <span class="italic">The Prelude</span> at the Dove Cottage Museum led to the revision in 1952 of her 1914 edition of <span class="italic">Poems in Two Volumes</span> and in 1959 of De Selincourt's 1926 edition of <span class="italic">The Prelude</span>. Her last publication, in 1958, was a <span class="roman">World's Classics</span> edition of the <span class="italic">Journals</span> of Dorothy Wordsworth, with whom she felt a particular sympathy.<br>
<br>Constantly consulted by Wordsworth scholars and eager amateur inquirers from all parts of the world, Helen Darbishire was generous with the fruits of her own researches and with the resources of the Wordsworth Library at Grasmere. As a trustee of Dove Cottage, and, from the death of De Selincourt in 1943 until her own death, chair of the trustees, she greatly developed its facilities as a centre of study. She received many honours for her scholarship. She was twice awarded the Rose Mary Crawshay prize by the British Academy: in 1932 for her work on Milton, and in 1950 for that on Wordsworth. She was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1947. She received the honorary degree of DLitt from Durham and London, and in 1955 was appointed CBE.<br>
<br>Helen Darbishire was of middle height, fair, with candid blue eyes, and a look of serenity and determination. For the last seven years of her life, Shepherds How, overlooking the Vale of Grasmere, was the &#145;quiet heart's selected home&#146;, which she shared with her friend and &#145;second sister&#146;, Vera Farnell. Age hardly affected her ability to work steadily and unhurriedly, and did not diminish her sense of humour. She died at home, after a short illness, on 11 March 1961.<br>
