<span class="headword">White,  Henry Kirke</span>  (1785&#150;1806), <span class="occ">poet and essayist</span>, was born on 21 March 1785 at a house in Exchange Alley, Nottingham, the third of the six children of John White (<i>b</i>. 1750/51), a butcher, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Neville (<i>b</i>. 1755). John White's occupation was an established one in his family, running back to the beginning of the century. Mary White, who became a teacher in 1798 or 1799 when she opened a girls' school, was the daughter of a framework-knitter who had come from Staffordshire to Nottingham to be apprenticed in the trade in 1728, but the Neville family had been yeoman farmers in Staffordshire from the sixteenth century. At an early age Henry Kirke White was sent to a local school run by a Mrs Garrington, who quickly recognized and nurtured his reading ability and other capacities. From here he went to the Revd John Blanchard's school, reputedly the best in Nottingham. Blanchard further reinforced the view that he was a child of exceptional talent. White's schooling was interrupted by his father's need for assistance in his business, which led to a family dispute finally resolved by his eventual removal to yet another local school. When he was fourteen he found employment in the local textiles trade, working at a stocking-loom for about a year, before he found a place to train in the law, at the offices of Coldham and Enfield, town clerks and attorneys. There he began to learn Latin and Greek, which he worked at in the evenings, and extended his studies to include Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese as well as science. He also joined a local literary society at which he practised his skills in oratory.<br>
<br>White's first literary success is marked by his winning of two prizes in the <span class="italic">Monthly Preceptor</span>, for a translation of Horace in 1800, and an imaginary tour from London to Edinburgh in 1801. Further prizes followed, and thus encouraged White became a regular correspondent for the <span class="italic">Monthly Mirror</span>, through which he became acquainted with Capel Lofft, and the magazine's owner, Thomas Hill. Lofft and Hill were both known for their work in supporting the notion of a specifically English canon of poetry, and their influence can be seen in White's early productions for the <span class="italic">Mirror</span>, under the title of &#145;Remarks on the English poets&#146;. While there is no evidence to suggest that White was unhappy with his employment, a preference for a career in the church was evident by 1802. Such a move required study at one of the universities, and in order to raise some of the necessary funds, White began work on a small volume of poems that was published in 1803 under the title <span class="italic">Clifton Grove, a Sketch in Verse, with other Poems</span>. The volume was dedicated to the duchess of Devonshire, and unluckily described in the dedication as the &#145;trifling effusions of a very youthful muse&#146;, this deference being further reinforced in the preface where White compounded his vulnerability by stating his motive to fund his studies. Such gestures were relatively common at the time, and they invited an equally common response from the critics in the form of ridicule or censure. White was no exception: in the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> of February 1804, his volume was commended for its effort but damned for its evident failure in &#145;the difficult art of writing good poetry&#146;. More cutting for White perhaps was the reviewer's exposure of his impecunity and scholarly ambition which also provided the platform for the assertion that should White ever gain the benefits of study &#145;he will, doubtless, produce better sense and better rhymes&#146;. This volume nevertheless attracted more favourable notice too, most notably from Robert Southey, whose interest in White resulted in some correspondence.<br>
<br>Having failed to make money out of his poetry, White did not give up his plans to enter university. In fact his determination was strengthened by a deepening of his religious conviction, which had been disturbed for a while around 1801 by an interest in deism. By June 1803, however, White had committed himself to the evangelical movement in the Anglican church, and encouraged by his employers and his acquaintance with local clergy, he received an introduction to Charles Simeon, the famous evangelical at King's College, Cambridge. Simeon secured for White a sizarship at St John's, for which he was advised to prepare by studying for a year with the Revd Lorenzo Grainger, curate at Winteringham in Lincolnshire. In 1805 White progressed to Cambridge and competed for a vacant scholarship in his first term. In order to prepare for the examination White read widely and voraciously, neglecting his health in the process, but he was successful, and in his short time at Cambridge, he became a highly regarded scholar. However, White had been ill for some time with consumption, and the punishing regime he set himself for study exacerbated his illness. He died, unmarried, on 19 October 1806 in his rooms at college, and he was buried in All Saints' churchyard, Cambridge.<br>
<br>After his death a large quantity of verse and prose was found among White's papers, and this material was given by his family to Robert Southey, who duly compiled <span class="italic">The Remains of Henry Kirke White &hellip; with an Account of his Life</span> (2 vols., 1807). By 1818 <span class="italic">The Remains</span> was in its tenth edition, including two American editions, and White's reputation as a promising poet who had died tragically young was firmly established. This volume formed the basis of White's reputation in the nineteenth century, and contains a range of poetry, including sonnets, odes, ballads, and descriptive verse, some religious, and some secular. Byron (a contemporary of White at Cambridge, although they never met) included a portrait of him in <span class="italic">English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</span> (1809) as a young genius of great potential, killed in part by his own excessive talent. Later, Keats's friend Richard Woodhouse believed that Kirke White was one of the &#145;lone spirits who could proudly sing/Their youth away, and die&#146; alluded to in Keats's <span class="italic">Sleep and Poetry</span> (1817). Although there is little evidence to show that White had any influence of note on the poets of the time, there is no doubt about the fact that the success of Southey's edition ensured that his poetry was widely read.<br>
<br>The few attempts that have been made in the twentieth century to revive White's reputation have been unsuccessful. White is rarely represented in anthologies or in accounts of Romanticism, despite the considerable merit of his work, and the potential for its recognition as a prime example of provincial writing in the period. Part of the reason for this rests with the still prevalent view that the significance of late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century writing must inhere in its innovative qualities, and thus those writers who are working largely within the polite conventions of the period are not granted the attention so freely given to the Romantics. White's works are characterized by a contemplative mode: his sonnets, odes, and longer descriptive and meditative poems commonly feature the solitary condition and pensive mind, and in this respect they belong to the tradition that runs from Milton through Gray to Wordsworth and Coleridge. What little attention White receives tends to highlight his early promise in the accomplished <span class="italic">Clifton Grove</span>, but his lyrics, sonnets, and odes also repay interest. Most neglected of all is the limited collection of prose pieces, and the series known as <span class="italic">Melancholy Hours</span>.<br>
