<span class="headword">Thomas</span> <span class="st"> [Thomas of Woodstock]</span>, duke of Gloucester  (1355&#150;1397), <span class="occ">prince</span>, was the seventh (but fifth surviving) son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8519/', "Edward III (1312&#150;1377)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22110/', "Philippa of Hainault (1310x15?&#150;1369)")</script>. He was born at Woodstock on 7 January 1355, and on 22 February Edward III celebrated his son's birth with a great feast and a tournament there. At about the same time he was baptized. Thomas Hatfield, bishop of Durham, was one of his godfathers, and raised him from the font: perhaps he was named Thomas in his godfather's honour. Another godfather was Thomas de la Mare, the abbot of St Albans. Thomas was by some way the youngest of Edward's sons: he was almost twenty-five years younger than <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8523/', "Edward, the Black Prince")</script>, and more than twelve years younger than Edward's fifth son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16023/', "Edmund of Langley")</script>. In a sense therefore he belonged to a different generation from his elder brothers, who took a leading part in politics and war during their father's reign. He was closer in age to his nephew Richard II than to Richard's father, the Black Prince, and his political and military career was to be played out mainly in Richard's reign.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandmarriage"></a>Early life and marriage</h2>During his infancy Thomas remained with his mother, who was given an allowance for his maintenance by the king in 1358, though in the first year of his life he had a nurse&#151;possibly a wet-nurse&#151;called Alesia Vang, wife of Marmaduke Vang of Somerset. By 1366 he had his own household, but otherwise little is known of his life until the 1370s. As the king's youngest son he would of course depend on royal patronage for a suitable marriage, and for sufficient income to maintain his estate as he came to manhood. On 3 April 1374 he was granted a group of manors which formed part of the inheritance of Humphrey (IX) de Bohun, earl of Hereford and Essex, who had died in the previous year. The grant stated that he &#145;will take to wife&#146; Eleanor, the elder of Humphrey's two daughters and coheirs, who was born <i>c</i>.1365. Their marriage probably took place in the early summer of 1374: on 1 June <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14843/', "John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster")</script>, issued instructions for the delivery of a goblet and a silver ewer to &#145;the lady of Woodstock on the day of her marriage&#146;  (<span class="italic">John of Gaunt's Register</span>, 2, no. 1431). On 10 June 1376 Thomas was appointed constable of England, an office that had been hereditary in the Bohun family, and on 24 August the king came to Pleshey, the centre of the Bohun lands in Essex, and granted his son an annuity of 1000 marks (&pound;666 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>.) to maintain his estate as constable. The income was to be derived from several Bohun manors, including Pleshey and High Easter, which were placed in Thomas's custody until his wife came of age and could receive livery of her inheritance. Pleshey was to become Thomas's principal residence. The revenue from these manors, however, amounted to no more than &pound;243, and the remaining &pound;423 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. was assigned on the exchequer until the following year, when the custody of the Bohun lordships of Brecon, Hay, Huntington, Caldicot, and Newton in the Welsh marches was granted to him during the minority of the heiresses.<br>
<br>Edward III had evidently decided that the Essex lands of the Bohun family should pass to Thomas, but Eleanor's younger sister, Mary, was entitled to half the inheritance, and was thus an attractive marriage prospect. At Edward's death in 1377, however, Mary was still unmarried, and in May 1380, when the inheritance was formally partitioned and Thomas and Eleanor given livery of her share, Thomas was also granted custody of Mary's purparty. Froissart suggests that Thomas was responsible for bringing Mary up, and that he hoped to persuade her to become a member of the order of Poor Clares so that the whole Bohun inheritance would devolve upon him and Eleanor, but, while Thomas was on campaign in France in 1380, his elder brother John of Gaunt in effect abducted Mary from Pleshey, and married her to his son Henry, earl of Derby (the future <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12951/', "Henry IV")</script>). Henry's marriage to Mary undoubtedly took place in 1380, though how much more of Froissart's story is true cannot be determined with any certainty. Mary and Henry were given livery of her share of the inheritance on 22 December 1384, and Thomas thus had to relinquish control of the estates assigned to her, including Brecon and Hay. Mary's marriage had serious long-term consequences for Thomas. It left him &#145;dependent on Crown grants rather than on inherited resources&#146; for the rest of his life  (Goodman, <span class="italic">Loyal Conspiracy</span>, 90), and may also have provoked a breach with Gaunt which was never fully healed. Furthermore relations between Thomas and Henry of Derby never seem to have been especially close. They disputed the partition of the Bohun inheritance throughout Richard II's reign until Thomas's death, and they were at odds over the issue of Richard's possible deposition at the end of December 1387.<h2>
<a name="Militarycareer"></a>Military career</h2>Thomas played no part in the military expeditions to France in the last years of his father's reign, and apparently he did not identify with either side in the political crisis of 1376. Thomas's lack of military and political experience in his late teenage years is surprising. His elder brother Edmund of Langley had been with his father on the Rheims campaign in 1359&#150;60 when he was only eighteen, and was created earl of Cambridge when he was twenty-one; but there is no evidence that Edward III had an earldom in mind for Thomas in 1376, when he reached the same age. In the political climate of that year, the grant of an earldom to the king's youngest son, with its accompanying endowment in lands or annuities, might have been difficult, but his father's failure to honour him may have contributed to his belief, which was to strengthen in Richard II's reign, that he received less than his due as Edward III's son.<br>
<br>However, his father knighted him at his last Garter ceremony on 23 April 1377 (though he did not receive the order itself until 1380) and, by virtue of his marriage to the heiress of the hereditary constable of England, Thomas successfully claimed the right to carry the sceptre and the dove at the coronation of Richard II on 16 July 1377. On the eve of the coronation he was created earl of Buckingham, with an income of &pound;1000 a year to maintain his estate. This income, however, was not derived from land, but from the revenues of alien priories, which were in the king's hands during the war with France. Thomas thus had a vested interest in the continuation of the war.<br>
<br>War was to be Thomas's principal preoccupation over the next three years. Like his elder brothers he was excluded from the continual councils which had responsibility for administration during Richard II's minority, though he may have had some informal influence over government. During the summer of 1377 a Franco-Castilian fleet was active in the English Channel, and, according to Froissart, Thomas and his brother Edmund prevented the fleet from landing a force at Dover. In November he put to sea with a force of about 3600 sailors and 4000 men-at-arms and archers, but his attempt to engage the Castilian fleet at Sluys ended when his own ships were dispersed by a storm. He had better luck in December, when he pursued the Castilians down the channel and captured eight of their ships off Brest. In April 1378 the duke of Brittany leased Brest to the English, and Thomas was one of the commanders appointed to receive it from the duke.<br>
<br>Thomas's next expedition, the most substantial of his career, was also to Brittany, being intended to bolster the position of the pro-English duke. On 3 May 1380 he engaged to serve for one year with a force of over 5000 men, almost half of whom were members of his own retinue. His army moved overland from Calais and reached Brittany in late September, where he laid siege to Nantes. The duke, however, made peace with Charles VI of France, and Thomas had to lift the siege. After overwintering in Brittany, he returned to England, reaching Falmouth on 3 May 1381. Although the expedition achieved little, no blame could be laid at Thomas's door: as in 1375, the military commanders in the field in Brittany had to abandon their expedition in the face of a political agreement to which they were not party. He had some difficulty in obtaining payment of all the sums due to him from the exchequer for the expedition: even in 1388 the crown was still in debt to him. After his return to England, Froissart suggests that Thomas spent some time on his wife's estates in Wales, though it is also possible that he was at Pleshey during the peasants' revolt, preparing to take military action against the rebels in Essex. On 28 June he took a force to Billericay to disperse the rebels there, and he was subsequently appointed a justice of the peace in Essex and Cambridgeshire to deal judicially with the rebels in those counties. In mid-July he was in Gloucester, suppressing local disturbances there.<br>
<br>Thomas's frustrating military career continued after the revolt. When the truce with Scotland expired in February 1384, Thomas and Gaunt were appointed joint leaders of an expedition to Scotland. The two lords crossed the border at Easter, and did some damage in south-east Scotland, but the expedition ran short of food and returned to England. Walsingham criticized the expedition as one of the most expensive and wasteful for many years. In 1385 Thomas brought a retinue of 400 men-at-arms and 800 archers to the king's campaign in Scotland. The expedition never engaged the enemy in battle, but on 6 August, &#145;at the king's first entry into Scotland&#146;, Richard created Thomas duke of Gloucester, with an annuity of &pound;1000 in addition to his annuity as earl of Buckingham. His title and his annuity were formally confirmed in parliament in November. Apart from &pound;60 from the fee farm of Gloucester, the whole of this new annuity was assigned on the customs of London, Boston, Hull, Lynn, Ipswich, and Yarmouth, but Thomas soon complained that he was unable to receive the full amount from these sources. Although he was now a duke, he still lacked a substantial territorial endowment: he relied for the greater part of his income, estimated at about &pound;2500 a year, on assignments on the customs and the alien priories. His landed estate still amounted to little more than Eleanor's share of the Bohun inheritance, attenuated by her mother's dower.<h2>
<a name="Politicalstrains13851387"></a>Political strains, 1385&#150;1387</h2>The impression of a nation united in arms, and led by its king on the verge of adulthood, which the expedition of 1385 to Scotland provided, only served to disguise for a time the growing tension between the king and some of the nobility, including Thomas. Although Thomas had some grounds for feeling that he had not received the rewards he was entitled to, his brother Edmund, now duke of York, was similarly ill-endowed, and had not been able to make as good a marriage. Edmund's character was, however, in Froissart's words, &#145;soft and peaceable&#146;, but neither term could be applied to Thomas, who seems to have been a much more forceful person, discontented, overbearing, and ambitious, and able to inspire fear as well as respect. To some extent, therefore, Thomas's personality explains his political stance after 1385, but none the less his grievances had substance, and his hostility to those round the king was apparently widely shared, not just by some of his fellow nobles, but also, it seems, by many of the gentry class who were represented among the Commons in parliament.<br>
<br>Some hint of the growing tension between the king and Thomas came at the Salisbury parliament in April 1384, when a Carmelite friar accused Gaunt of treason. There was no truth in the accusation, but, according to Walsingham, Thomas rushed into the king's chamber and threatened to attack or kill anyone&#151;even the king&#151;who suggested that Gaunt was a traitor. The Carmelite friar may have had some connection with Robert de Vere, earl of Oxford, one of the king's leading favourites, who was becoming increasingly unpopular with some of the nobility. De Vere's favour with the king brought him substantial rewards in the form of landed property, and this must have been especially galling to Thomas, whose income still depended heavily on exchequer annuities which he could not always obtain. Furthermore, the centre of the de Vere inheritance in East Anglia was Hedingham Castle, less than 20 miles from Pleshey, and de Vere's rapid rise in the king's favour must have seemed a threat to Thomas's position in Essex.<br>
<br>Thomas's hostility to the king had its roots not just in his concern for his wealth and territorial position, but also in his belief, shared by other nobles such as the earl of Arundel, that the king's wish to negotiate a peace settlement with France was misguided. John of Gaunt, however, was more sympathetic to Richard's foreign policy, and, as long as Gaunt remained in England, Thomas was perhaps unwilling to engage in open opposition to the king. In July 1386, however, Gaunt left for Castile, and Thomas now seems to have assumed the leadership of those who were opposed to the king, and who sought the removal of de Vere and other favourites from the court. When parliament met in October 1386, the Commons were faced with a demand from the chancellor, Michael de la Pole, for an unprecedentedly large grant of tax to pay for the defence of the realm against the French invasion that had been threatening since the summer. The Commons refused to consider a grant of tax until the chancellor was dismissed, but Richard declined to meet parliament and retreated to his palace at Eltham, Kent. Thomas and some of his associates may initially have been planning an attack on de Vere, but they now associated themselves with the Commons' initiative against de la Pole. At the express wish of both Commons and Lords, Thomas and the bishop of Ely, Thomas Arundel, confronted the king at Eltham. According to Henry Knighton they reminded Richard of his duty to attend parliament; they went on to complain about the damage done to the realm by the evil counsellors around the king, and they concluded by pointing out to Richard that a king who allowed himself to be alienated from his people by evil counsellors, and was unwilling to be guided by law and by the wise advice of the Lords, risked deposition. The implicit threat was enough to bring Richard round [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53093/', "Lords appellant")</script>]. He agreed to meet parliament and to dismiss de la Pole, who was subsequently impeached by the Commons, with Thomas acting as one of the judges appointed from among the Lords. Parliament then established a commission of government, of which Thomas was a member, to oversee the government for one year from 19 November.<br>
<br>Thomas's hand can perhaps be seen in the decision of the commission in December 1386 to reject overtures for peace with France, and begin preparations for the renewal of the war. The king, however, had been deeply offended by the establishment of the commission, and in the summer of 1387 he consulted his judges about his rights. They told him that those who had imposed the commission on him against his will should be punished as traitors. This opinion served to raise the political stakes substantially, and in the autumn of 1387 Thomas, together with the earls of Arundel and Warwick, prepared a pre-emptive strike against the king. On 14 November they marched to Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, where in the presence of a group of mediators they formally submitted an appeal (or accusation) of treason against de la Pole, de Vere, and three other associates of the king, Alexander Neville, archbishop of York, Sir Nicholas Brembre, the mayor of London, and Sir Robert Tresilian, chief justice of the king's bench. The mediators agreed to arrange a meeting with the king, and on 17 November the three lords came into the king's presence at Westminster Hall, where they repeated their intention to proceed against de la Pole, de Vere, and the others by way of an appeal. Richard agreed that the appeal should be heard in the parliament which would assemble in February 1388.<h2>
<a name="TheMercilessParliament"></a>The Merciless Parliament</h2>De Vere's response to these events, however, was to raise an army in Cheshire and confront the three lords in the field. Thomas, perhaps supported by Arundel, seems to have suggested deposing Richard immediately, but was restrained by Warwick, who argued that their first concern must be to defeat de Vere. Accordingly they left London to march northwards, and were joined at Huntingdon on 12 December by the earls of Derby and Nottingham. The five lords, known as the lords appellant, routed de Vere's army at Radcot Bridge on 20 December. De Vere escaped, but the appellants marched victorious to London, and with 500 armed men at their backs they confronted Richard in the Tower on 30 December. According to the chronicle of Whalley Abbey, they deposed Richard for three days, but then reinstated him because they could not agree on a successor. This account is given some support from Thomas's confession in 1397 in which he says that the lords agreed to Richard's deposition for two or three days, but then restored him to the throne. The story may well be true: it was widely believed at the time that Thomas had designs on the crown, and he even went to the lengths of denying any such intention at the opening of parliament in February. According to the Whalley chronicler, Derby opposed Thomas's claim, as he had every reason to do. He and his father, John of Gaunt, had a better title to the throne as Richard's nearest male heirs, and it is difficult to see how Thomas could have held on to the crown in face of the superior right of the house of Lancaster.<br>
<br>At the opening of the so-called Merciless Parliament, on 3 February 1388, Thomas and his co-appellants formally presented their appeal of treason against de la Pole, de Vere, and the three other accused. The essence of the charges against them was that they had accroached royal power and had used their influence over the king to persuade him to accept their unwise counsel. All were convicted and all but Neville, who was sentenced to loss of his temporalities, were condemned to death, though de la Pole, Neville, and de Vere had already escaped overseas. Thomas and his colleagues then turned their attention to a group of officials and chamber knights who had enjoyed the king's favour, notably the king's former tutor, Sir Simon Burley. These men were impeached, and most were condemned to death. The death sentence on Burley, however, divided the appellants and aroused opposition elsewhere. Thomas, together with Arundel and Warwick, was determined to have Burley executed, but Derby and Nottingham were inclined to spare him, and so was the duke of York, who had a bitter disagreement with his brother over Burley's fate. The two accused each other of lying, and were only calmed down by the king. The pleas for mercy failed, however; the Commons supported Thomas's insistence that Burley should die, and he was executed on 5 May. The dispute over Burley had exposed the fragile nature of the appellants' coalition, and had made Thomas appear an extremist, albeit one who enjoyed the support of the Commons in parliament. Richard did not forget Thomas's stance over Burley's fate.<br>
<br>Thomas reaped some personal rewards from his political dominance. He and his fellow appellants voted themselves &pound;20,000 to cover their &#145;expenses&#146; in bringing the &#145;traitors&#146; to justice, though the money was paid only gradually over the following years. He sought to strengthen his own territorial position by petitioning to have his annuities secured on lands forfeited by those who had been convicted in the Merciless Parliament, but although the petition was accepted nothing was done about it, and he did not manage to use his period of political dominance to diminish substantially his dependence on exchequer annuities. He did, however, succeed in obtaining &pound;1920 of the sums still owed to him for the Breton expedition of 1380: &pound;635 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. of this was derived from the sale of de Vere's forfeited goods.<br>
<br>The appellants' political ascendancy continued for some months after the end of the Merciless Parliament, but in foreign affairs they were largely unsuccessful. As in the autumn of 1386, Thomas and Arundel sought to implement a more vigorous policy towards France, but Arundel's naval expedition in the summer and autumn achieved little, and a Scottish invasion in August culminated in the defeat of a locally raised English force at Otterburn. After these set-backs Thomas could see some advantage in responding favourably to the peace initiatives instigated by the duke of Burgundy in December 1387, and he accepted Burgundy's proposal for a truce. None the less, the military failures of the summer damaged the appellants' standing in public opinion, and by the beginning of 1389 their influence was waning. Hostility towards Richard's favourites had brought them together in the first place, and once the favourites were removed the essential reason for their coalition disappeared. On 3 May 1389 Richard II formally resumed responsibility for government, and Thomas was removed from the council.<h2>
<a name="FranceandIreland13891397"></a>France and Ireland, 1389&#150;1397</h2>Thomas's political exile did not last long. With Gaunt returning to England in November, Richard had no wish at this stage to risk a confrontation with his former opponents, and Thomas was restored to the council by 10 December 1389. He could not expect, however, to enjoy any real influence with the king, and in 1391 his thoughts turned to a crusade in north-east Europe. His nephew Henry, earl of Derby, had acquitted himself with distinction there in the previous year, and Thomas was perhaps motivated by a desire to emulate his success. Accordingly he assembled an expedition which left England for the Baltic in September 1391, but he was driven back by a storm at the entrance to the Skagerrak, and after trying to seek landfall successively in Denmark, Norway, and Scotland he eventually reached the English coast at Tynemouth: another expedition had ended in failure and frustration, and his debts for the expedition now had to be paid, though the king made him a gift of &pound;500 towards his expenses.<br>
<br>On 29 April 1392 Richard II declared that he intended to appoint Thomas lieutenant in Ireland for five years. Indentures were sealed, and Thomas began to make preparations for his departure. He received a total of &pound;6333 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. in advances from the exchequer, and spent almost &pound;1250 on the purchase of artillery and on wages and rewards for his retinue. However, on 23 July his appointment was cancelled. No reason was given for its cancellation, but it is possible that the king wanted him to join Gaunt in the peace negotiations with France which were about to resume. Thomas may not have been unhappy to have his appointment countermanded, judging by the view he formed of Ireland when he went there with the king in 1394; on the other hand it was one more set-back to a career that had been notable so far for its frustrations. Much of the debt to the crown that he had incurred in preparing for the expedition was eventually remitted.<br>
<br>In 1393 Thomas and Gaunt led the English delegation to a peace conference at Leulinghem, near Calais, which concluded a provisional peace treaty between England and France. Rumours that peace might be agreed contributed to an outbreak of unrest in Cheshire in 1393. Thomas held the office of justice of Chester, and the leaders of the rising believed that Thomas shared responsibility with Gaunt for the progress of the negotiations. There is no evidence, however, that Thomas sympathized with the rebels' fears that peace would put an end to their careers as soldiers: indeed, according to Walsingham he mustered his retinue and was ready if necessary to help his brother put down the rising. On the other hand both Froissart and the French author of the <span class="italic">Chronicque de la tra&iuml;son et mort de Richart Deux roy Dengleterre</span> suggest that Thomas was opposed to a settlement with France. Thomas had discovered during the Merciless Parliament that he stood high in favour with the Commons, and he may have been anxious not to be identified too closely with a peace policy that, as a debate in the parliament of January 1394 showed, was not popular with the Commons. If this is true, then his inclusion as one of the English envoys at the 1393 peace conference may be explicable in terms of his status rather than his opinions: the dukes of Burgundy and Berri represented France, and thus it was necessary for Richard II to send two royal dukes to represent him. Yet there is no other evidence that he was opposed to the general tenor of the negotiations in 1393. Indeed, he may have felt he would have more room for manoeuvre at home if his brother Gaunt was to be duke of a greatly enlarged Aquitaine: Jean de Grailly and Sir Richard Stury, who spoke about Thomas to Froissart during the latter's visit to England in 1395, thought that this was true. Perhaps the evidence would permit the conclusion that Thomas was unenthusiastic about peace with France rather than openly hostile, and went along with the negotiations in which his elder brother took the lead.<br>
<br>The provisional agreement of 1393 between England and France brought an end to the war for the time being, and in 1394 Richard II turned his attention to Ireland. He planned the largest royal expedition there for almost two hundred years, and Thomas was one of the nobles who agreed to accompany the king. The expedition landed at Waterford on 1 October 1394, but Thomas did not stay long in Ireland. Richard sent him back to England as his envoy at the parliament that opened in January 1395, and, according to Froissart, Thomas was unimpressed with the country. He described it as very poor, with a poor and wretched people, and he thought that military action there was futile: Ireland, he said, was a country &#145;neither of conquest nor of profit&#146;, and anything &#145;conquered in one year would be lost the next year&#146;  (<span class="italic">&#338;uvres</span>, 16.5). The king made him a grant of part of the land in Leinster to be vacated by the &Oacute; Broin family, but there is no evidence that Thomas believed the grant was anything more than nominal.<br>
<br>If there is any truth in the story presented by Froissart, relations between Thomas and those around the king seem to have become strained during 1395. When Froissart visited England in that year, he spoke at length to Jean de Grailly about the duke. Grailly described Thomas in terms that were not unflattering but suggested a certain wariness on the part of the court towards him. Grailly said that he had &#145;a most wonderful head&#146;, but that he was proud and arrogant, though well-loved by the commons of England. His part in the execution of Sir Simon Burley had not been forgotten. Grailly also suggested that after the death of Richard II's queen in 1394 Thomas hoped that the king might marry his own daughter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54430/', "Anne of Woodstock, countess of Stafford (c.1382&#150;1438)")</script>, who had been widowed two years earlier, but the king had rejected the idea on the ground that she was too close a kinswoman. Later that year Robert le Mennot (Robert the Hermit) visited England, and spent two days and nights at Pleshey with the duke and his family. He too reported his impressions to Froissart. He had no doubt that Thomas was opposed to attempts to bring the war to an end, and set himself to persuade the duke to change his mind, but even his powerful advocacy of an Anglo-French crusade to save eastern Christendom from the Turks failed to move the duke. According to Froissart, Thomas held the French in contempt and his heart was hardened against peace. Froissart believes that Robert the Hermit probably related his conversation with Thomas to the king, for both Richard and the French seem to have been anxious to find out what Thomas was thinking.<br>
<br>Froissart gives the impression that he was well informed about comings and goings at Pleshey, and about Thomas's opinions. He suggests that Thomas preferred to reside at Pleshey, rather than at court in the company of his two brothers, and he paints a picture of the duke as a jealous, brooding figure, ready to tell anyone who visited him what he thought of the king and those round him. It is likely that Thomas did indeed spend much time at Pleshey in 1395 and the first six months of 1396, though he also had a &#145;hall&#146; in London, which was well equipped with tapestries, furnishings, plate, and other household goods at the time of his forfeiture in 1397. He must have spent some time there as well as at Pleshey. He enjoyed little real power or influence at court, however, and his lack of enthusiasm for peace with France set him apart from his brothers as well as from the king. On the other hand he still enjoyed royal patronage. In 1390 Richard II granted him the reversion of the lordship of Holderness, worth &pound;600 a year, and when the reversion fell in at the death of Queen Anne in 1394 Thomas gained possession and his dependence on exchequer annuities was thus reduced. He was also granted the custody of the inheritance of his late son-in-law, the earl of Stafford, and he was wealthy enough in these years to endow his newly founded college of secular priests at Pleshey with manors from his inheritance.<h2>
<a name="Arrestanddeath"></a>Arrest and death</h2>In the early summer of 1397 Richard II seems to have decided to launch a pre-emptive strike against Thomas and two of his co-appellants in 1387&#150;8, the earls of Arundel and Warwick. At first he hoped to secure them by a trick, inviting them to a banquet in London on 10 July at which they would be arrested. Thomas declined the invitation on the ground that he was too ill to travel from Pleshey: only Warwick turned up, and was arrested after dinner. Arundel was persuaded by his brother the archbishop of Canterbury to surrender himself, but Richard resolved to go to Pleshey in person and arrest Thomas. According to Walsingham he assembled a large force of Londoners, household knights, and a group of nobles. They set out from London under cover of darkness and arrived at Pleshey early in the morning of 10 July. Thomas, who Walsingham says was gravely ill, was woken and came down to meet the king accompanied only by a few priests from his college. The two exchanged courtesies, and Richard then arrested the duke. He was given a short time to bid farewell to his family and household, and then left the castle under armed escort. The earl of Kent and Sir Thomas Percy took him to Calais, where he was imprisoned. The author of the continuation of the <span class="italic">Eulogium historiarum sive temporis</span> gives a harsher account of the exchanges between Thomas and the king: Thomas apparently begged the king to spare his life, but Richard replied that he would have the same mercy he had shown to Burley&#151;a sentiment that has the ring of truth about it.<br>
<br>Richard's motives for arresting Thomas and his fellow appellants have been variously interpreted both by contemporary chroniclers and by modern historians. Some of the former, for instance the French author of the <span class="italic">Tra&iuml;son</span>, maintain that Thomas was involved in a plot against the king. There is no evidence for this, but it may well be true, as Froissart suggests, that Richard felt threatened by his uncle's hostility to the <i>rapprochement</i> with France that followed the twenty-eight-year truce between the two countries in 1396. Thomas had shared the Commons' objections to Richard's proposal in January 1397 for a joint Anglo-French expedition against Milan, and he may, as the author of the <span class="italic">Tra&iuml;son</span> suggests, have felt that the return of Brest to the duke of Brittany in the previous year had been unwise and unnecessary. It is likely that Richard moved against the former appellants for fear that if he did not, they might move against him. If there was any suggestion of a plot, it existed only in Richard's mind.<br>
<br>Richard intended to charge the three former appellants with treason for their &#145;riding against the king&#146; in 1387. When parliament assembled, heavily guarded, at Westminster on 17 September 1397, Thomas, Arundel, and Warwick were formally appealed of treason. Arundel and Warwick both stood trial in parliament: Arundel was condemned to death and executed, while Warwick, though convicted, was reprieved and sentenced to exile in the Isle of Man. When the order was given for Thomas to be brought before parliament, however, the earl of Nottingham, who was earl marshal and captain of Calais, replied that he could not produce him because he was dead: &#145;By order of my most excellent lord the king, I held this duke in my custody in the lord king's prison in the town of Calais; and there, in that same prison, he died&#146;  (<span class="italic">RotP</span>, 3.378).<br>
<br>Both contemporaries and modern historians have accepted that Thomas was murdered in Calais. The evidence that he was seriously ill in 1397 might argue for a death by natural causes, perhaps hastened by the rigours of imprisonment, but such a suggestion flies in the face of what everybody thought at the time, and would require the assumption that the subsequent account of his murder was an invention. Thomas was almost certainly murdered on the instructions of the earl of Nottingham, who in turn must have been acting on orders from the king. In the first parliament of Henry IV's reign one of Nottingham's valets, John Hall, was charged with Thomas's murder, and his confession was read out in parliament. Hall said that Nottingham had told him he had been commanded by the king to murder Thomas; he went to a house in Calais where some of his accomplices produced the duke and took him to a side chamber in the house. Thomas was allowed to confess himself to a chaplain, and he was then told to lie on a bed. A feather bed was placed over him, and he was suffocated. Parliament was told that he had died on 25 or 26 August, but Sir William Rickhill's account of his mission to Calais to procure Thomas's political confession makes it clear that he was still alive on 8 September: he may have been murdered that night.<br>
<br>On 24 September parliament found Thomas guilty of treason, and all his lands and property were forfeited to the crown. On the following day the king ordered that a confession obtained from Thomas by Sir William Rickhill, one of the king's judges, should be read in full parliament. In his confession, made to Rickhill at Calais on 8 September and written in English, Thomas admitted that he was one of those who imposed the commission of 1386 on the king, and &#145;along with others, took upon myself royal powers&#146;  (<span class="italic">RotP</span>, 3.379). He went on to confess that, along with others, he came armed into the king's presence, discussed giving up his homage to the king, and agreed to depose him &#145;for two or three days&#146;  (Given-Wilson, 81), after which he was restored. He concluded by swearing that after he renewed his oath to the king in 1388 he had never been guilty of fresh treasons, and asked the king for mercy and grace. Rickhill then asked him if he had anything else to add to what he had written, and he said that he now remembered that he had told the king &#145;that, if he wished to be a king, he should stop begging to save the life of Simon Burley&#146;  (Given-Wilson, 83).<br>
<br>The events in Calais were no doubt planned in advance by the king, with the co-operation of the earl of Nottingham. Although Richard II had arrested Thomas and prepared a charge of treason against him, he could not have been confident of obtaining a conviction had Thomas been produced to stand trial in parliament. John of Gaunt, as high steward of England, would have presided over his trial, and, whereas Gaunt seems to have had little compunction about passing the death sentence on Arundel, he would probably have been very reluctant to do so on his own brother. Furthermore, Thomas was still popular with the common people, and however effectively Sir John Bussy, the speaker, managed the Commons in parliament, there remained the risk of popular demonstrations in Thomas's favour. Thomas's murder, in the side room of a Calais house, was thus a political necessity for Richard, and his confession gave legitimacy to his conviction for treason.<br>
<br>On 14 October Richard ordered the earl of Nottingham to deliver Thomas's body to Richard Maudeleyn, a royal clerk, who was instructed to hand the body over to Thomas's widow for burial in Westminster Abbey. It was buried in the chapel of St Edmund and St Thomas, well away from the burial places of Thomas's royal kindred; but his widow requested in her will that his body should be moved to the chapel of Edward the Confessor, to lie beside his mother and father, and after her death in October 1399 Henry IV carried out her instructions. Walsingham's account of Thomas's death concludes with a eulogy which perhaps encapsulates the opinion of many who did not share the king's suspicions of him. He was, says Walsingham, &#145;the best of men &hellip; in whom was placed the hope and solace of the whole community&#146;  (<span class="italic">Historia Anglicana</span>, 2.226), and &#145;who always worked for the advantage of the realm and the honour and benefit of the king&#146;  (&#145;Annales Ricardi secundi&#146;, 221).<h2>
<a name="Personalityandpossessions"></a>Personality and possessions</h2>Following Thomas's conviction for treason the exchequer drew up an inventory of his forfeited possessions at Pleshey. The inventory survives, and provides detailed evidence for the duke's tastes and interests. Pleshey must have been a residence of some magnificence. Thomas possessed fifteen tapestries which hung in the great hall and various chambers. Their subjects were mainly scenes from romances such as the stories of Charlemagne and Godfrey de Bouillon, and the battle between Gawain and Lancelot. There were religious subjects, too, such as the nativity of Christ, the presentation and purification of the Virgin Mary, and from the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> the story of Judith and Holofernes. He had sixteen beds with hangings of gold and silk: one was of white satin embroidered in gold with the arms and crest of the duke. His chapel was richly equipped: one cope, valued at &pound;60, was made of cloth of gold, lined with satin, and embroidered with various beasts and birds and the emblem of the Garter; there were also forty-two books in the chapel, including <span class="roman">Bibles</span>, missals, psalters, and antiphoners, a martyrology, and a little book of prayers covered in black and white velvet and embroidered with swans, the badge of the Bohun family. Elsewhere in the castle he had a library of eighty-four books, including a copy of the Wycliffite translation of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> into English, made <i>c</i>.1382. This survives, and is now BL, Egerton MS 617. Possession of a Wycliffite translation of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> need not imply any interest in Wyclif's theology or sympathy with Lollardy: there is no evidence that Thomas's piety was anything other than conventional, and it is significant that the English <span class="roman">Bible</span> was not listed in the inventory among the books in his chapel. Some of the devotional works belonged to his wife, and may have been inherited from her Bohun forebears. Her religious interests perhaps went deeper than those of her husband: in her will she described a crucifix as &#145;her favourite possession&#146; and she left her daughter Joan a book with the psalter and other devotions, &#145;which book&#146;, she said, &#145;I have often used&#146;  (Nichols, 177).<br>
<br>In his &#145;hall&#146; in London, Thomas also had a number of books, but it is difficult to judge how far the books he had in London and at Pleshey genuinely represent his literary taste. In London he had, among other books, one &#145;written in French called <span class="italic">Meistre des Istories</span>&#146;  (<span class="italic">CIM, 1392&#150;1399</span>, no. 372), a book of the &#145;Lives of the church fathers&#146;, the romance of Godfrey de Bouillon, a <span class="roman">Bible</span> in Latin and another in French, and a copy of the <span class="italic">Golden Legend</span>. At Pleshey he had books in English, French, and Latin; books of romances, such as the <span class="italic">Romance de la rose</span>, <span class="italic">Ector de Troye</span>, <span class="italic">Le romance de Lancelot</span>, and <span class="italic">La gest de Fouke filtz Waryn</span>, and devotional works in French such as a book of the miracles of Our Lady. He also had a book of the gospels glossed in English. He had a French translation of Livy, &#145;a little book called the Flour de Histories&#146; (probably <span class="italic">Flores historiarum</span>), and two copies of Trivet's chronicle. He owned a number of law books, including copies of the English statutes and two large books of civil law, and also a copy of Giles of Rome's <span class="italic">De regimine principum</span>, which may have been the copy that Burley forfeited in 1388. The devotional works and the romances, mainly in French, perhaps testify to his real interests, which were probably those of most of his fellow nobles at the end of the fourteenth century. Assuming that he read the books at all, he must have been bilingual in English and French, with English probably as his mother tongue, and he could probably read Latin. He is known to have written a treatise on the office of constable, which he had held since 1376 and evidently took seriously, but it is not listed among his books at Pleshey. This treatise, <span class="italic">The Ordenaunce and Forme of Fightyng within Listes</span>, exists in both an English and an Anglo-Norman version, but the earliest text of the English version exists in a late fifteenth-century manuscript  (BL, Lansdowne MS 285), and it is likely that Thomas's original text was the Anglo-Norman version.<br>
<br>The inventory reveals his taste in books, tapestries, plate, and vestments; but his physical appearance is less easy to establish. There is a miniature portrait of him in the book of benefactors of the abbey of St Albans  (BL, Cotton MS Nero D.vii). It shows him bearded, with the Bohun swan in the background; but the manuscript is late fifteenth-century, and the portrait is probably not a likeness. Nothing but the matrices remain of the monumental brass that was once on his tomb in Westminster Abbey, though there is an engraving of it in Sandford's <span class="italic">Genealogical History of the Kings of England</span> (1677), which shows that it was very elaborate. It had representations not just of Thomas and his wife, but of members of his royal kindred, including his father, Edward III. His pride in his royal birth is well expressed in this memorial. He and his wife had one son, Humphrey, and three daughters, Anne (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1382), Joan, who died unmarried on 16 August 1400, and Isabel (<i>b</i>. 1386), who became a nun in the Minoresses in London and took her vows on 23 April 1402, her sixteenth birthday. Humphrey was born about 1381, and was taken to Ireland by Richard II in 1399. When news of Henry Bolingbroke's landing in England reached Ireland, Richard II had him lodged in Trim Castle in the lordship of Meath. In August 1399 Bolingbroke ordered him to be returned to England, but he died on the way back, possibly in a shipwreck off Anglesey or possibly of plague at Chester. Anne thus became Thomas's sole heir. She married first Thomas, earl of Stafford, who died in 1392, and then in 1398, without royal licence, his brother Edmund, who was killed at the battle of Shrewsbury in 1403. Her third husband was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50242/', "Sir William Bourchier, later count of Eu")</script>. She died on 16 October 1438. Thomas's wife, Eleanor, died on 3 October 1399. Walsingham says that she died of a broken heart after suffering the loss of her husband and her only son: Shakespeare's portrayal of the grief-stricken duchess in act I of <span class="italic">Richard II</span> may not be far from the truth. She was buried in St Edmund's Chapel in Westminster Abbey; her monumental brass, showing her in widow's dress, survives.<br>
