</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sheppard, Sir  John Tresidder</span>  (1881&#150;1968), <span class="occ">classical scholar and college head</span>, was born on 7 November 1881 in Peckham, London, the fourth of the five children (three sons and two daughters) of Alfred Henry Sheppard (<i>d</i>. 1930), a wool broker's clerk of Peckham, London, and his wife, Harriet Winifred, daughter of the Revd James Sears, a Baptist pastor and printer. He was educated at Dulwich College from 1895 to 1900 and was taught Greek there by A. C. Pearson who in 1921 was preferred to his pupil for the regius chair at Cambridge. Among his school friends were P. G. Wodehouse and Alic Halford Smith, later warden of New College, Oxford. When Sheppard was provost of King's he and Smith revived the <i>amicabilis concordia</i> between the two colleges.<br>
<br>After winning a scholarship in 1900 to King's College, Cambridge, Sheppard came under a brilliant scholar, Walter Headlam, and a born teacher, Nathaniel Wedd. But he often said that he owed as much to Oscar Browning, who had to get his Baptist parents' permission to take him to the theatre. He was an Apostle and a prizeman, though his zeal as president of the union condemned him to a second in part two (1904) after a first in part one (1902) of the classical tripos. In 1906 he won a fellowship at King's. The electors ignored a referee who wrote, &#145;Mr S. has an unfortunate lightness of touch. This might be cured by a year in a German seminar&#146;  (Morris, 62). In 1911 he published his book <span class="italic">Greek Tragedy</span>. His best work was his edition of the <span class="italic">Oedipus tyrannus</span> (1920) which won him a Manchester honorary LittD at the age of forty; and <span class="italic">The Pattern of the Iliad</span> (1922) was based on his Manchester lectures on Homer. He held the Brereton readership from 1931 to 1947.<br>
<br>When A. E. Housman went to Cambridge in 1911 he said to Sheppard, &#145;I hear your lectures are very well attended, so I know they must be bad&#146;  (Wilkinson, <span class="italic">JTS: a Memoir</span>, 21). They were in fact remarkable. Never using notes, he would sit on a table swinging his legs, his long underpants showing between his trousers and boots, or perch on a chair at an angle so perilous that disaster threatened. He became the characters in Homer or the tragedies, and made his audience feel they were seeing the drama as well as listening to an interpretation. More than any scholar of his generation (Gilbert Murray apart) he kept Greek literature alive at a time when it had ceased to be a compulsory subject in many schools. A school had only to ask and he would talk to the boys and girls, and dozens of boys went to King's because he had met them in a train or at school. He produced the triennial Greek plays eleven times and was made knight commander of the order of the Redeemer by the Greek government. Peggy Ashcroft acted in his <span class="italic">Electra</span> and Joyce Carey in <span class="italic">Oedipus</span>. He was a mercurial producer and rehearsals were exhausting. &#145;First you are a flame, then you are a lily&#146;, he told the Cassandra of 1921, an Etonian athlete  (Wilkinson, <span class="italic">A Century of King's</span>, 89). In 1950 he was knighted for his services to Greek (he had been appointed MBE in 1919).<br>
<br>Sheppard's other passion was King's. Like Oscar Browning he treated undergraduates as equals and Sheppard developed that tradition&#151;and invented a good many others&#151;steering many benefactions in their direction. He knew every undergraduate and undertook long post-mortems on scholarship as well as tripos examination results. Elected vice-provost in 1929, he was a unanimous choice as provost in 1933; and such was the hold he established over the college that the fellows prolonged his tenure as provost for two years so that he retired in 1954.<br>
<br>Sheppard was an exacting colleague, and college meetings lasted for hours as he reminisced about the past; but it was his way of educating the fellows in the traditions of the college. He had no enthusiasm for the natural sciences, and as little for research. He wanted each branch of the humanities to fertilize the others. As a young don, the friend of J. Maynard Keynes, Bertrand Russell, G. Lytton Strachey, and Lady Ottoline Morrell, he had been an iconoclast, but as he grew older he preferred the company of the innocent to the clever. He was proud to be <i>ex officio</i> senior fellow of Eton and was much moved by the visit of George VI, Queen Elizabeth, and Princess Margaret to the college.<br>
<br>In later years Sheppard visited the four dominions, for each of which he established a graduate studentship; and Melbourne and New Zealand followed St Andrews in conferring honorary degrees. He created an <i>amicabilis concordia</i> with Queen Mary College, London (evacuated to King's during the war), and another with Berkeley College, Yale, where his contemporary at King's, Charles Seymour, was president.<br>
<br>Sheppard was a character. His mane of white hair brought him dignity which he masked with clowning. Shrewd yet na&iuml;ve, tough yet appearing to be tottering on the verge of senility, tirelessly interested in people, helping them by stealth, histrionic in the highest degree, quick to spot the comic and to mock the pompous, the possessor of a gargantuan ego that was directed almost entirely to good ends, he was one of the most remarkable dons of his day. He died unmarried, of a cardiac arrest, at Northumberland House, 237 Ballards Lane, London, on 7 May 1968. His remains were cremated at Golders Green on 19 May 1968; on 10 February 1969 his ashes were placed in a vault of King's College chapel.<br>
