<span class="headword">Cappe,  Newcome</span>  (1733&#150;1800), <span class="occ">Unitarian minister and preacher</span>, was born at Leeds on 21 February 1733. He was the eldest son of Joseph Cappe, minister of Mill Hill Dissenting Chapel in Leeds, and his wife, who was the daughter of Mr Newcome of Waddington, Lincolnshire. From his mother's side of the family he appears to have inherited considerable property. He studied at two of the best dissenting academies&#151;under John Aikin at Kibworth (1748&#150;9) and under Philip Doddridge at Northampton (1749&#150;52)&#151;and under William Leechman at Glasgow University (1752&#150;5).<br>
<br>In 1755 Cappe became co-pastor to the Revd John Hotham at the dissenting chapel in St Saviourgate, York; he was ordained in that city on 26 May 1756 and in the same month became sole minister on Hotham's death. He quickly established himself as one of York's leading citizens, founding a literary club in 1771, taking part in the Yorkshire Association for economical and parliamentary reform in 1779, and helping to distribute material in favour of the repeal of the <span class="roman">Test and Corporation Acts</span> in 1787. His large residence in Upper Ousegate became a centre for the local intelligentsia, particularly those of reforming persuasions. He never sought a permanent move from York for, according to William Wood, who preached Cappe's funeral sermon,<blockquote>he carried an aversion to public life, and a love of studious retirement, to a somewhat blameable excess. With natural and acquired capacities for extensive usefulness, in the course of five-and-forty years he was seldom absent from this city. (Wood, 18)</blockquote>This was partly the result of his domestic circumstances. In October 1759 he married Sarah Turner, the daughter of a Hull merchant. They had six children, but she died of consumption in 1773. His second wife was <a href="#cosubject_49451">Catharine [<i>see below</i>]</a>, daughter of an Anglican clergyman, Jeremiah Harrison, vicar of Catterick; the marriage took place at Barwick in Elmet on 19 February 1788. It is due to her subsequent career as a writer that so much about Cappe himself is known.<br>
<br>Cappe published several biblical commentaries and other religious discourses, together with a number of individual sermons. In 1757 his sermon celebrating the victory of Frederick the Great at Rossbach was well received and rapidly passed through thirteen editions. During the War of American Independence he preached several fast-day sermons which stressed national degeneracy and divine retribution; his tone was distinctly pro-American. Notable among such discourses was his <span class="italic">Sermon Preached on the Thirteenth of December, the Late Day of National Humiliation, etc</span> (1776). His <span class="italic">Discourses on the Providence and Government of God</span>, which was first published in 1795, had reached a third edition by 1818. His theological affinities were unitarian, and he was associated in politics as well as religion with such luminaries of rational dissent as Joseph Priestley and Theophilus Lindsey. Cappe was plagued by poor health and in 1791 suffered a paralytic stroke, followed by others later in the decade. He died at York on 24 December 1800. Two of his sons became medical practitioners; the elder, Joseph Cappe, predeceased his father, and the younger, Robert Cappe, died at sea while travelling to Leghorn in 1802.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_49451"></a><span class="headword">Catharine Cappe</span>  (1744&#150;1821)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 3 June 1744 at Long Preston, in the West Riding of Yorkshire. On her mother's side she was related to the family of Sir Rowland Winn, bt, of Nostel. She survived a severe attack of smallpox at the age of three. She was educated at York for the purpose, in her own words, of &#145;attending the dancing school and learning the sort of ornamental needle-work then in fashion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life</span>, 38). At the age of thirteen she was placed at a boarding-school at York, where there was a French master and where she received an education of a fairly high quality. Her father died on 22 July 1763 and was succeeded as vicar of Catterick by Theophilus Lindsey, with whose family Catharine Harrison became friendly. Lindsey himself was a formative intellectual influence upon her, and his resignation, on theological grounds, from the Church of England in 1773 and his decision to establish a separate Unitarian chapel in London led her from the Anglicanism of her father into rational dissenting circles. Newcome Cappe was a representative of that tradition in York, and after their marriage in 1788 she joined in his literary and theological endeavours, subsequently becoming his memorialist and expositor. They had no children.<br>
<br>After the death of her husband, Catharine Cappe pursued a literary and philanthropic career of her own. She carried out extensive work for charity schools and published on the subject. She edited and republished several of Newcome Cappe's works and prefaced two of them with memoirs of him, in addition to collecting several of his shorter essays into one volume entitled <span class="italic">Discourses Chiefly on Devotional Subjects</span> (1805). Her most important production, however, was her volume of memoirs, first published in 1822, with a third edition in 1826. It presents a valuable account of the experiences and educational opportunities of a woman from a clerical and modestly propertied family in the later eighteenth century and has interesting reflections on the female role. It also contains much helpful biographical information about some of the leading dissenters of the period. Catharine Cappe died suddenly at York on 27 July 1821.<br>
