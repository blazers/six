<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lunsford, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1610, <em>d.</em> in or before 1656), <span class="occ">royalist army officer</span>, was possibly the third of four sons (there were also four daughters) of Thomas Lunsford (<i>d</i>. 1637), of East Hoathly, Sussex, and his wife, Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1642), daughter of Thomas Fludd, treasurer of war in France and the Low Countries under Elizabeth I, and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9776/', "Robert Fludd")</script>, the celebrated Rosicrucian.<br>
<br>The Lunsford family was established in Sussex before the Norman Conquest, but its fortunes seem to have decayed in the early seventeenth century, and by the 1630s its insecurity had helped provoke a feud with a relative, Sir Thomas Pelham, of Halland, whose parkland abutted the Lunsford property. The Lunsfords seem to have poached Pelham's deer, and on 27 June 1632 a Lunsford servant killed one of Pelham's hounds; the family were fined &pound;1750. In August 1633 Lunsford foolishly fired his pistol at Pelham's coach outside East Hoathly church after Sunday morning service; the bullet passed through the coach, lodging in the church door, where it remained for many years. Although no one was seriously hurt the incident was generally regarded as attempted murder, and Lunsford was ostracized by Sussex society and imprisoned in Newgate by privy council warrant on 16 August 1633. Allowed to lodge outside the prison, he contrived in October 1634 to escape, despite a game left leg.<br>
<br>Lunsford entered French service, and in April 1636 he was in Picardy, raising a foot regiment, of which he became colonel. In the mid-1630s Lunsford married Anne Hudson (<i>d</i>. 1638), of Peckham, Surrey; their only child, a son, died in infancy. The Pelham case finally reached Star Chamber in June 1637: Lunsford was fined &pound;8000 and was outlawed for failing to appear to receive judgment. Two years later he returned to England, was pardoned, and had his fine remitted (24 April 1639). He joined the royal army against the Scots, and in 1640 commanded a regiment of trained bands raised in Somerset. Although he complained that &#145;all are forward to disband&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1640</i>, 327) and boasted of having shot a couple of mutineers out of hand, he managed to conduct it from Warwick to Newcastle (June&#150;3 August 1640) and fought bravely at the rout of Newburn (28 August), so retaining a special hold on the king's affections. In 1640 Lunsford married his second wife, Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1649), daughter of Sir Henry Neville, of Billingbear, Berkshire; they had three daughters.<br>
<br>On 22 December 1641 the king, apparently on the recommendation of George Digby, issued an ill-timed warrant appointing Lunsford lieutenant of the Tower of London. Many saw this as a calculated affront to parliament, signalling an impending coup, since the Tower was the key to military control of the capital. The following day the common council of London petitioned the House of Commons against the appointment, depicting Lunsford as an indebted, quarrelsome desperado and a non-attender at church (a charge they later withdrew). On 24 December the Commons voted him unfit to be lieutenant; the same day Lunsford's superior, the earl of Newport, who enjoyed the complete confidence of the anti-court party, was dismissed as constable of the Tower. John Pym declared that Lunsford's appointment was proof that the popish conspiracy was nearing maturity; Londoners feared that Lunsford might use the cannon in the Tower to pound the city to rubble; reports circulated that the City merchants were withdrawing their bullion from the mint within the Tower, to the potential damage of trade; and libels soon appeared that Lunsford was a cannibal, with a penchant for eating children.<br>
<br>Although the king, on the advice of the lord mayor (who suggested that Lunsford's appointment would lead to an apprentice assault on the Tower), replaced Lunsford with Sir John Byron on 26 December, this was clearly a response to popular protest. The following three days saw a wave of demonstrations by the citizenry, who feared the testy, braggart professional soldiers who hung about London, waiting for their pay arrears and pressing for new commands in Ireland. Lunsford led a party of these officers who were prepared to confront the populace and were not averse to shedding blood. On 27 December, after Lunsford had been examined by the Lords, they drove the citizens out of Westminster Hall (though Lunsford had to escape by wading out to a boat in the Thames); clashes at Westminster Abbey on 28 December were followed by the fiercest fighting the following day round Whitehall. Lunsford received compensation for his dismissal in a knighthood on 28 December and, apparently, a pension of &pound;500 per annum.<br>
<br>Lunsford accompanied the king in his attempted arrest of the five members on 4 January 1642, and he was with him when he finally left Whitehall six days later. On 12 January, with a large force, he was reported to be at the noted but ill-defined hurly-burly at Kingston-on-Thames, Surrey, site of the county magazine, which it was widely believed the king aimed to seize <i>en route</i> to capturing Portsmouth. An alarmed House of Commons ordered Lunsford's arrest, and on 13 January he was captured at Billingbear, Berkshire, the home of his father-in-law. Bailed on 2 February, he was at liberty before June. On 1 July he was at York with the king, and on 14 July he had an hour-long private interview with him at Beverley. He was present at the armed demonstration against Hull on 29 July and by 3 August was based at Wells, Somerset.<br>
<br>At Banbury on 8 August Lunsford helped capture parliamentarian ordnance destined for Warwick Castle, and on 14 August he rescued Colonel Hastings near Loughborough from impending imprisonment in Leicester. On 19 August Lunsford received a commission to raise 1000 foot in Yorkshire, and the following day he was appointed governor of Sherborne Castle, Dorset, by the marquess of Hertford, with whom he retired into Glamorgan on 23 September.<br>
<br>After the battle of Edgehill on 23 October 1642 Lunsford was taken prisoner at Kineton, Warwickshire, and incarcerated in Warwick Castle until early May 1644. Arriving on 6 May at Oxford, where he was given command of a regiment, he was one of those chosen to assist Sir Arthur Aston in his government of the city. After relieving Greenland House (8 June) he entered the service of Prince Rupert, and was at Bristol, possibly as lieutenant-governor, in March 1645. By April he had become governor of Monmouth, a post he resigned to his brother <a href="#cosubject_17196">Herbert [<i>see below</i>]</a> before 7 July. After suffering defeat at Stoke Castle, Shropshire, on 9 June 1645 he received a royal commission to consolidate royalist forces in Wales; he escaped an assassination attempt, but on 8 December was captured at the taking of Hereford. Imprisoned in the Tower of London on a charge of treason, he remained there, with his wife, until 1 October 1647, when he was removed to Lord Petre's house in Aldersgate Street.<br>
<br>By 29 June 1648 he had secured his liberty, and in December Lunsford was in Amsterdam, ready to cross to England. He seems to have given up the Stuart cause as hopeless, and on 7 August 1649, having compounded for his delinquency at a sixth (&pound;300), and described as having no personal estate and much indebted, he secured a pass for himself and his family to Virginia. Early in 1650 he was depicted feasting and carousing at Ralph Wormeley's plantation on the York River, and on 24 October he was granted 3423 acres on the south side of the Rappahannock River, known as Portobacco. He was made lieutenant-general of the Virginia militia and a member of the council by the governor, Sir William Berkeley. At some point he married his third wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Henry Wormeley, of Riccall, Yorkshire, and widow of Richard Kempe, secretary of Virginia; they had a daughter. Lunsford probably lived at Richneck, his wife's home; after his death she married Major-General Robert Smith of Middlesex county. Lunsford died in or before 1656 and was buried near Greenspring, Berkeley's residence, where he shared a monument with Richard Kempe and Thomas Ludwell, Kempe's successor as secretary; this was moved to the churchyard at Bruton parish church, Williamsburg, where it remains at the beginning of the twenty-first century.<br>
<br>Red-haired, and of a markedly turbulent temperament, Lunsford clearly had an unsavoury reputation for sadism, brutality, and violence in the early 1640s, and he was depicted by his cousin, Lord Dorset, as &#145;a young outlaw who neither fears God nor man, and who, having given himself over to all lewdness and dissoluteness, only studies to affront justice, [taking] a glory to be esteemed &hellip; a swaggering ruffian&#146;  (Newman, <span class="italic">Royalist Officers</span>, 242). He was typical of the hard men upon whom Charles I increasingly relied, to the annoyance of moderate royalist opinion. His reputation for cannibalism arose because a libeller had written he was fierce enough to eat children; Sir Walter Scott, in <span class="italic">Woodstock</span>, mentions drawings in which he was depicted about to cut an infant into steaks. Yet Clarendon, by no means a sympathetic source, merely characterized Lunsford as a man &#145;of a very small and decayed fortune, and of no good education &hellip; who had been forced to fly the kingdom to avoid the hand of justice for some riotous misdemeanours&#146;. If by 1641 he had acquired &#145;an ill character&#146;, he had also earned himself &#145;the reputation of a man of courage and a good officer of foot&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 1.478). Indeed, Lunsford's characterization has been largely couched in parliament's terms, based on hearsay, insinuation, and the vestiges of an unbridled youth. &#145;Nothing in his wartime career suggests excesses&#146;  (Newman, <span class="italic">Old Service</span>, 145), and Sir John Coke, suffering depredations from royal troops in June 1640, and soliciting Lunsford's help, found him &#145;a brave gentleman and discreet&#146;  (ibid., 144).<br>

<a name="cosubject_17196"></a><span class="headword">Sir Herbert Lunsford</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1610, <em>d.</em> in or after 1667), <span class="occ">royalist army officer</span>, brother (and possibly twin) of Sir Thomas, like him seems to have experienced the wars in the Netherlands and Germany. In 1630 he was fined &pound;10 for failing to take up the honour of knighthood. It was he who ordered one of his servants to kill Pelham's hound in June 1632. In 1640 he was a captain in his brother's regiment, and he was present at Edgehill. He distinguished himself at Rupert's capture of Cirencester, and, having been made governor of Malmesbury, was taken prisoner when it was captured by Sir William Waller (23&#150;5 March 1643). He commanded Patrick Ruthven, earl of Forth's, foot, at the siege of Bristol (July 1643). By March 1644 he was in command of a regiment, and he fought at Cropredy Bridge, Oxfordshire, on 29 June. He was knighted on 6 July 1645, by when he had succeeded his brother Thomas as governor of Monmouth; he surrendered the town to Colonel Morgan in October and went over to France.<br>
<br>On 29 February 1648 Sir Herbert was licensed to transport soldiers into Europe from Erith, Kent, and in 1652 he petitioned the council of state for permission to transfer 3000 Irishmen into the king of Spain's service. In 1658 he was temporarily in command of three regiments, and the following year he was Charles II's emissary to Marshal Turenne. He returned to England some time after the Restoration and in 1667 was in command of a company of foot. He married (probably in the early 1640s) Margaret, daughter of Sir Thomas Engham, of Goodnestone, Kent; they had a son and two daughters. His captain's commission in March 1667 is the last certain reference to him.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_17195"></a><span class="headword">Henry Lunsford</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1611, <em>d.</em> 1643), <span class="occ">royalist army officer</span>, another brother of Sir Thomas, was baptized at Framfield, Sussex, on 29 September 1611. After serving in Europe he was lieutenant-colonel in Thomas's regiment at York in 1640. He raised 240 foot for the regiment in Somerset, and was active in one of the first confrontations in the civil war, when on 4 August 1642 he led a successful ambuscade at Marshall's Elm, Somerset, before the king's formal declaration of hostilities. He fought at the action near Sherborne Castle on 26 August, retired into Wales, and, after being present at Edgehill, succeeded to the colonelcy of his brother's regiment, fighting at Brentford (12 November) and the defence of Reading (April 1643). After commanding Prince Rupert's foot at Chalgrove Field (18 June), he was wounded at the siege of Bristol (26 July) and, carrying on in command, was shot through the heart the following day on Christmas Steps, long afterwards known as Lunsford's stairs. Clarendon refers to him as an officer of &#145;extraordinary sobriety, industry, and courage&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 3.114).<br>
