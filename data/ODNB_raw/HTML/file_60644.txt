<span class="headword">Cushing,  George Frederick</span>  (1923&#150;1996), <span class="occ">Hungarian scholar</span>, was born in Holway Road, Sheringham, Norfolk, on 17 February 1923, the son of George Irvine James Cushing, United Methodist minister, and his wife, Mary Emily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hutchinson. He was educated as a foundation scholar at Nottingham high school, before going in January 1942 to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he was awarded a major scholarship to read classics, but his university studies were interrupted in June 1942 when he joined military intelligence. He served in Egypt, Syria, and the Lebanon, where he acquired fluency in Turkish and a working knowledge of Arabic and Kurdish. In later life he rarely discussed his wartime career, other than to complain of malaria and camels. In 1943 he was sent to learn Hungarian at the School of Slavonic and East European Studies, University of London, but on completion of the course he returned to active service in the Middle East. In 1946 he resumed his studies at Cambridge, before graduating with an upper second in classics in 1947.<br>
<br>In May 1947 Cushing was appointed assistant lecturer in Hungarian language and literature at the School of Slavonic and East European Studies, where he remained for the rest of his academic career. In October 1947 he enrolled as a PhD student at the E&ouml;tv&ouml;s College, Budapest, witnessing at first hand the final stages of the communist takeover of Hungary. His teachers at the college included the eminent Hungarian linguist Dezs&#337; Pais and the literary historian J&aacute;nos Horv&aacute;th. He was expelled from Hungary in 1949 and his notes were confiscated (but he had made duplicates). He returned to the School of Slavonic and East European Studies and completed in 1952 at the University of London his PhD thesis, &#145;Sz&eacute;chenyi, Kossuth and national classicism in Hungarian literature&#146;. He was appointed to a full lectureship in 1950, a readership in 1967, and a personal chair in 1978. He was head of the school's department of east European languages and literature in 1976&#150;9 and 1983&#150;6, and served as acting director of the school in 1979&#150;80. He retired in 1986, after which he was made an emeritus professor.<br>
<br>Cushing's principal contribution to Hungarian literature was as a translator. His translations include Gyula Illy&eacute;s's <span class="italic">People of the Puszta</span> (1967; originally <span class="italic">Puszt&aacute;k n&eacute;pe</span>) and his biography of Pet&#337;fi (1973), a collection of studies by Endre Ady (<span class="italic">The Explosive Country</span>, 1977), a selection of short stories by Zsigmond M&oacute;ricz (<span class="italic">Seven Pennies</span>, 1988), G&eacute;za G&aacute;rdonyi's <span class="italic">Eclipse of the Crescent Moon</span> (1991, originally <span class="italic">Egri csillagok</span>), and Margit Kaffka's <span class="italic">Colours and Years</span> (1999, originally <span class="italic">Szinek &eacute;s &eacute;vek</span>). Cushing's literary translations were marked by a lucidity of style and a precision of vocabulary. His work of translation extended, however, well beyond literature. His long contribution to Doreen Warriner's <span class="italic">Contrasts in Emerging Societies</span> (1965) brought together travelogues, memoirs, political speeches, statistics, and reports on society, education, and the economy in nineteenth-century Hungary. In 1975 he translated and adapted from the Hungarian P&eacute;ter Hajd&uacute;'s <span class="italic">Finno-Ugrian Languages and Peoples</span> (originally <span class="italic">Finnugor n&eacute;pek &eacute;s nyelvek</span>), which cemented a long-held interest in Hungarian linguistics and, in particular, the early history of the Hungarian language.<br>
<br>Cushing published extensively in academic journals on aspects of Hungarian literature and language. These included several contributions to the <span class="italic">Slavonic and East European Review</span>, most notably his &#145;Books and readers in eighteenth-century Hungary&#146; (1969) and &#145;The desiderative in Hungarian&#146; (1963), which analysed one set of suffixes in Hungarian syntax, and in the journal <span class="italic">Folklore</span> a study of the bear in Ob-Ugrian legend (1977). Although for a long time unable to visit Hungary, he was from the 1970s onwards frequently invited to publish and lecture there, surprising audiences with his absolute mastery of the Hungarian language and its idioms. He was awarded several distinctions, including the Pet&#337;fi medal for literature (1973), the Ady medal for literature (1978), and the republic of Hungary's order of merit medium cross (1993).<br>
<br>Cushing was, according to another distinguished Hungarian scholar, Laszlo Peter, &#145;the scholar who in his time did more for Hungarian studies outside Hungary than anyone else&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 29 April 1996). Clubbable and a skilled raconteur, witty and hugely informed, he was also retiring and discreet. True to the family tradition, he remained a strong Methodist throughout his life, and was an elder of Chislehurst Methodist Church, where he also played the organ with considerable accomplishment. He served on a number of committees ranging from Bromley education committee to the Methodist International Committee. He was after his retirement president of the British&#150;Hungarian Fellowship in London. After joining the School of Slavonic and East European Studies he lived mostly in Kent, first in Sevenoaks and then in Chislehurst. He died at St Christopher's Hospice at 51 Lawrie Park Road, Sydenham, on 12 April 1996, of prostate cancer after a long illness. A funeral followed by a service of thanksgiving was held at Chislehurst Methodist Church on 25 April 1996, after which he was cremated. He never married.<br>
