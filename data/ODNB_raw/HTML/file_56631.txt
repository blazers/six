<span class="headword">Cotton,  John</span>  (1802&#150;1849), <span class="occ">pastoralist and ornithologist in Australia</span>, was born at Balham Hill, Surrey, the third son of William Cotton (1759&#150;1816), a prosperous clerk in the London custom house, and his wife, Catherine Savery (<i>d</i>. 1803). An older brother was the art collector William Cotton (1794&#150;1863). Cotton had a good education as a boy, attending Crediton grammar school, then travelling round Britain and later Europe with a tutor, and apparently attended Oxford for a short time, where he studied law without taking a degree.<br>
<br>Cotton became attached to a firm of solicitors in Lincoln's Inn Fields but spent most of his time in art galleries, drawing and studying birds. In 1835 he published privately <span class="italic">The Resident Song Birds of Great Britain</span>, illustrated and hand-coloured by himself, reissued in expanded form with a new title (<span class="italic">The Song Birds of Great Britain</span>) either in late 1835 or early 1836, as the title-page is usually dated. The book reveals considerable artistic and observational talent. In 1841 he became a fellow of the Zoological Society, having before then attended a lecture series by Nicholas Vigors on the quinarian system of classification (based on groups of five) and taken copious notes. Cotton continued to use this distinctive system of animal classification long after it was abandoned in Britain. In the same year his younger brother Edward emigrated to New South Wales and Cotton decided to follow his example, emigrating on 19 January 1843, with his wife, Susannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Edwards (<i>d</i>. 1852), and nine children; their journey is commemorated in his <span class="italic">Journal of a Voyage in the Barque &#145;Parkfield&#146;</span> (1845) which includes several of his poems. He took properties on the Goulburn River, near Port Phillip, eventually amounting to 30,000 acres; the family camped on the site while building a house.<br>
<br>Cotton lived for only six more years, during which time he wrote detailed, illustrated letters to his brother William in Devon, giving some of the most complete descriptions of bush life that have survived. These letters describe not only the hardship of a settler's life but also the natural history and indigenous population of the area. Cotton also remarks on contemporary events and literature, including scientific texts like <span class="italic">Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation</span> in 1846. All his spare time was otherwise dedicated to preparing an account of the birds of Port Phillip. This was never published in his lifetime although the illustrations survive and were issued as <span class="italic">John Cotton's Birds of the Port Phillip District</span> in 1974. Cotton seems to have felt the field was too well trodden by the famous ornithologist John Gould. The specimens he sent to his brother and to the naturalist Robert Hudson (possibly a cousin) were ungraciously received and did not sell. In 1848, however, he contributed a list of local birds to the <span class="italic">Tasmanian Journal of Natural Science</span>. Some of his earliest paintings of birds were collected and published in three volumes after his death by Robert Tyas.<br>
<br>Cotton was well known in Australian natural history circles and maintained a genteel interest in science and art. He experimented with daguerreotypes with Frank Gilbert, his children's tutor. Cotton died on 15 December 1849 on his farm after being ill for a few weeks. His doctor recorded acute rheumatism followed by brain fever as the cause.<br>
