<span class="headword">Atwater,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1521), <span class="occ">bishop of Lincoln</span>, was born probably in 1450 (perhaps ten years earlier), in Somerset. He is connected with Cannington and may have had relatives in Wells. After proceeding to his BA and MA at Oxford by 1476 and to his ordination to the priesthood a year before, he became a fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1477 and subsequently served as bursar. He was elected to a fellowship at Eton in July 1482, a turning point in his career. He began to acquire benefices which included a canonry of Wells in 1498 and of St George's Chapel, Windsor, in 1504. He became dean of Salisbury in 1509 as well as a canon of Lincoln and archdeacon of Huntingdon&#151;all appointments which signalled him for special promotion. They and many other benefices allowed him to pursue scholarly interests and both university and royal service.<br>
<br>While at Eton, he attracted the notice of William Horman who dedicated his <span class="italic">Vulgaria</span>, printed by Pynson in 1519, to him. He returned to Oxford in 1489 and became a DD in 1493. He was a commissary of the university, first for Archbishop John Morton of Canterbury in 1497, and subsequently for Bishop William Smith of Lincoln. He served as chancellor of the university intermittently from 1500 to 1503. He gathered together a library, a few volumes of which survive in Brasenose College; it does not suggest he was a humanist, since he knew no Greek, and these books are those of a committed if unadventurous Oxford theologian. His annotations suggest a love for the subject: thus he contrasts theology with the law which goes bad (<i>vilescerent</i>) on its students. He was known to be a friend of John Gunthorpe and was certainly known to Dean John Colet. More importantly, he was a friend of Thomas Wolsey who probably, with Smith, engineered his move to Henry VII's court: in 1508 he became Dean of the Chapel Royal, and appeared at the court of requests and at significant royal occasions like the funeral of Henry VII and the coronation of Henry VIII.<br>
<br>Atwater's friendship with Wolsey almost certainly accounts for his elevation to the see of Lincoln by papal bulls of 15 September 1514. He belonged to a group of Wolsey's episcopal prot&eacute;g&eacute;s who were known for diligence but who were never powerful enough to pose a threat to the cardinal. When appointed, he was in late middle age, and though he was a hard-working administrator, described by Smith as having academic merit and &#145;industry&#146;, he was not prominent at court and was unknown internationally. Yet he was one of several remarkable bishops at this time who, unusually, exercised their ministry by residing mainly in their dioceses. Atwater did not delegate extensively, and is to be found riding the length and breadth of his diocese visiting the clergy and religious, and presiding over his court of audience, either locally or at his favourite manors of Liddington in Rutland, Buckden in Huntingdonshire, and Wooburn in Buckinghamshire. He was punctilious in calling to account those who were not resident in their benefices, requiring appropriate dispensations to be shown; he pursued (somewhat unsuccessfully) priests who found celibacy beyond them, as well as religious who neglected the rule of their order. His activities predate the criticism of the church by Martin Luther in Germany, but suggest a sympathy for the reform envisioned by Colet, Erasmus, and Thomas More, though there is no evidence of close friendship between them. Recent scholarship has highlighted the importance of those bishops who started to reform their dioceses before the English Reformation. Atwater was among the first of these and one of the least known.<br>
<br>Atwater died at Wooburn in Buckinghamshire on 4 February 1521, and his body was buried in the nave of the cathedral church of Lincoln. The tomb and brass have been destroyed; the record of Atwater's visitations and episcopal activity appropriately survive him.<br>
