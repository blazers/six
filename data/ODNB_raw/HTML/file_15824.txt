<span class="headword">Kynaston,  John</span>  (1728&#150;1783), <span class="occ">author and literary scholar</span>, was born on 5 December 1728 at Chester, son of Humphrey Kynaston, mercer of Chester. On 20 February 1745 he was admitted to Manchester grammar school; he proceeded with an exhibition to Brasenose College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 20 March 1746. He was elected a scholar on 1 August following, and graduated BA on 16 October 1749 and MA in 1752. He was elected fellow on 14 June 1751. In 1752 he left Oxford and moved to Wigan.<br>
<br>In 1761 Kynaston published a Bridgman oration spoken in Brasenose College chapel, <span class="italic">De impietate C. Cornelio Tacito falso objectata</span>. In 1764 he issued <span class="italic">A collection of papers relative to the prosecution now carrying on in the chancellor's court in Oxford, against Mr. Kynaston, by Matthew Maddock, clerk &hellip; for the charge of adultery alleged against the said Matthew Maddock</span>. He was a frequent contributor to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, and in his obituary the editor, John Nichols, wrote that Kynaston's &#145;friendly labours have frequently embellished our Magazine&#146;, and that Nichols's own &#145;literary labours were facilitated by his valuable correspondence&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 627&#150;8). Those friendly and literary labours were some thirty or more letters to that periodical, contributions that establish Kynaston as a scholar and critic, some of whose letters, notably on the plays of Shakespeare, should be better known. He wrote to some considerable extent on <span class="italic">The Tempest</span>, <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, and <span class="italic">Othello</span>, and also on <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>, <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span>, <span class="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</span>, <span class="italic">All's Well that Ends Well</span>, <span class="italic">The Two Gentlemen of Verona</span>, <span class="italic">Titus Andronicus</span>, <span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span>, and <span class="italic">Richard II</span>. In some of his observations he anticipated later scholars and editors, such as Edmond Malone, both in emendations and glosses, and he took courteous issue with a few of Dr Johnson's notes on the plays. He was the first to explain Hamlet's &#145;A little more than kin, and less than kind&#146;, quoting the old play <span class="italic">Gorboduc</span> in illustration. His letters show his familiarity with the Greek and Roman writers, and also with the Elizabethan dramatists, eighteenth-century poets, and French literature. His most extended effort was six letters, dating from January 1772 to November 1773, on &#145;Two curious tesserae theatrales found near Herculanem&#146;. He wrote the Latin inscription on the monument of Dr Peter Francis le Courayer in Westminster Abbey. He also took an active part on behalf of Mary Blandy, the patricide hanged on 6 April 1752. A writer in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> states that Kynaston was much with her &#145;from the time of her conviction till her body was secured from indecent treatment&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 803). He died at Wigan in June 1783.<br>
