<span class="headword">Olson,  Stanley Bernard</span>  (1947&#150;1989), <span class="occ">biographer</span>, was born on 8 June 1947 in Akron, Ohio, the youngest of the three children of Sidney Olson, a printer, and his wife, Miriam Klein. Both parents were children of &eacute;migr&eacute; Jewish families: the Kleins were from Hungary, while Sidney's father, Frank Olshanitsky, left Russia to escape conscription, changing his name to Olson and settling in Akron, where he made a living as a printer. His sons Sidney and Irving started a radio repair business which eventually evolved into the vast Olson electronics company.<br>
<br>Olson was unhappy at school, where his grades were abysmal and his behaviour disruptive; at the age of twelve he was sent to the Culver military academy in Indiana, which he loathed, graduating after five years 149th out of a class of 182. In 1965 he enrolled at Boston University, where he came under the influence of the distinguished Henry James scholar Millicent Bell. It was she who inspired his fascination with Virginia Woolf and Bloomsbury, recommending him as a graduate student at Royal Holloway College, University of London, where he arrived in the autumn of 1968 to write a doctoral thesis on the history of the Hogarth Press, 1917&#150;23. During the course of his research he met Lytton Strachey's biographer Michael Holroyd, as well as surviving members of the Bloomsbury group, and through these contacts he soon established his own circle of friends. Frances Partridge, translator and diarist, the widow of Ralph Partridge, became a particularly close and affectionate mentor.<br>
<br>In 1971 Olson was commissioned to write the life of the poet Elinor Wylie, published in the United States by the Dial Press in 1979. The reviews were respectable, although the book was never issued in paperback or in a British edition. This was followed by the editing of an abridged version of the <span class="italic">Letters and Diaries of Harold Nicolson</span> (Collins, 1980), a project which, largely owing to an uneasy relationship with Nicolson's son Nigel, Olson came to detest. With his next undertaking, however, he was completely in sympathy: a life of the painter John Singer Sargent, with whose flamboyant work, elusive character, and elegant style of living Olson wholeheartedly identified. &#145;I do so adore every aspect of his life. His painting, rather like his life, is all surface and not depth&#146;, he wrote in a letter  (Hatfield, 137). The book was published to considerable acclaim in 1986, by Macmillan in London and St Martin's Press in New York.<br>
<br>Next was to have come a life of Rebecca West&#151;Olson, who had befriended Dame Rebecca in her old age, was named in her will as one of two biographers&#151;but on 18 July 1986 he suffered a severe stroke. Although surviving with great courage for another three and a half years, he remained unable to read and almost speechless, and died of a second stroke at his flat, 1E Montagu Mews North, London, on 9 December 1989. His remains were cremated at Golders Green crematorium on 17 December.<br>
<br>Not least of Stanley Olson's achievements was his re-creation of himself as a Henry James Englishman. Small and thickset, with a large, handsome head and glossy black hair, he transformed himself into a dandy: his beautifully tailored suits were lined in red silk, his shoes in red leather; he wrote on hand-cut, custom-made grey paper. His beloved spaniel, Wuzzo, rode in a carriage-tricycle bought at Harrods, eating off a porcelain bowl manufactured for him in Limoges.<br>
<br>Olson was a generous and affectionate man with a great talent for friendship, although sexual relationships were for him a closed book. Both gourmet and gourmand, he loved to entertain, treating his friends to rich and elaborate meals, often sent in from Claridges or Le Gavroche. (His extravagance was a constant source of complaint from his long-suffering family.) But although a lover of gossip and social life, Olson was essentially a loner, intensely private, often deeply melancholic, contradictions in his character which he felt were treated more kindly by English reserve than by the invasive manners of his compatriots.<br>
