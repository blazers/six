<div class="para">
<span class="headword">King,  Cecil Harmsworth</span>  (1901&#150;1987), <span class="occ">publisher</span>, was born on 20 February 1901 at Poynter's Hall, Totteridge, Hertfordshire, the fourth child in the family of three sons and three daughters of Sir Lucas White King, professor of oriental languages at Dublin University, and formerly of the Indian Civil Service, and his wife, Geraldine, daughter of Alfred Harmsworth, barrister, and sister of the first viscounts Rothermere [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33718/', "Harmsworth, Harold Sidney")</script>] and Northcliffe [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33717/', "Harmsworth, Alfred Charles William")</script>]. Cecil King's boyhood was unhappy. A brother was killed at Ypres, another when the ship taking him to school was torpedoed. &#145;Life has always been difficult for me because this is not my world&#146;, he wrote in his candid autobiography, <span class="italic">Strictly Personal</span>, published in 1969. &#145;Until recently I have hated myself and always wanted to commit suicide&#146;. He remembered his father as &#145;an irascible old gentleman&#146; and his mother as violent and selfish. He hated his school, Winchester College, and liked Oxford because at Christ Church (he gained a second class in modern history in 1922) he could always be alone. There he fell in love with Agnes Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1985), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32544/', "George Albert Cooke")</script>, canon of Christ Church, Oxford, and regius professor of Hebrew, and his wife, Frances Helen (<i>d</i>. 1932), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Anderson. He married her in 1923, and there were three sons and a daughter of the marriage (two sons were to die in his old age). King also adopted his deceased nephew's three children.<br>
<br>After Oxford, King's uncle Viscount Rothermere arranged for him to begin work on two of his newspapers, the <span class="italic">Glasgow Record</span> and <span class="italic">Sunday Mail</span>. While in Glasgow he developed the skin disease psoriasis, which troubled him for the rest of his life and which precluded him from being called up in the Second World War. King then returned to the south and joined the staff of the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> in 1923, in the advertisement department. In 1926 he transferred to the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>, of which he became a director in 1929. In its heyday the <span class="italic">Mirror</span> was not a comfortable habitat for a withdrawn Wykehamist, but when he joined the paper, it was Conservative, middle-class, and failing. With King's support, Guy Bartholomew, editorial director for many years, set about transforming it into an American-style tabloid, seeking a big working-class audience and willing to sympathize with Labour. King kept &#145;Bart's&#146; extravagances at bay.<br>
<br>King was made editorial director of the <span class="italic">Sunday Pictorial</span> in 1937 and wisely appointed the 24-year-old Hugh Cudlipp as editor. He was self-educated, had been brought up in socialist south Wales, was full of passion, and had the journalistic flair that King lacked. After the war, Bartholomew fired Cudlipp, but King ousted Bartholomew in 1951 and brought back Cudlipp as editorial director of Mirror Newspapers. King himself became chairman of the Mirror Group in 1951, a post he held until 1963.<br>
<br>King, Cudlipp, and the papers prospered. King built a vast world publishing empire on this small, rich base. In England, they acquired in 1958 the Amalgamated Press from the Berry family and then took over the Odhams group in order to rationalize the women's magazines. In so doing, they acquired &#145;Labour's own (and only) paper&#146;, the <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span>. The Labour Party's opposition to this was stifled when King promised to maintain the failing <span class="italic">Herald</span> for seven years. Halfway through this term the Trades Union Congress parted with their interest in the <span class="italic">Herald</span> and King changed its title to <span class="italic">The Sun</span>.<br>
<br>King and Cudlipp were now deeply involved in politics. The Mirror Group was almost a wing of the labour movement. King had greater hopes of Harold Wilson than he had had of his predecessor, Hugh Gaitskell, and believed that without the brilliant campaign conducted by Cudlipp, Wilson would not have won his marginal victory in 1964. Although King hoped to be Wilson's <i>&eacute;minence grise</i>, Wilson was unable to take his advice. Consequently when he offered to make King a peer and minister of state, King scornfully rejected the opportunity. As the government got into deeper economic difficulties, King became more hostile to Wilson and encouraged ministers to be disloyal to him.<br>
<br>In 1963 the Mirror Group was renamed the International Printing Corporation (IPC), with King as chairman. In 1965 he became a part-time director of the Bank of England. He was also a part-time member of the National Coal Board (1966&#150;9) and a member of the National Parks Commission (1966&#150;9). King felt that what he believed to be his special gifts as an administrator might be put at the service of the nation when the inevitable catastrophe came. He tried, at the dinner parties he gave in his ninth-floor suite in the <span class="italic">Mirror</span>'s glass building, to persuade other business leaders that there would have to be an emergency government containing men like themselves. King feared there would be hyperinflation and even bloodshed in the streets. Cudlipp and his political executives had a hard time keeping this nonsense out of the paper. They tried in vain to convince King that, though the government deserved criticism, his fears were wildly excessive.<br>
<br>King got Cudlipp to take him to see Earl Mountbatten of Burma in May 1968. He outlined his fears and asked Mountbatten if he would be titular head of an emergency government. Mountbatten had taken care to be accompanied by Sir Solly Zuckerman, the government's scientific adviser, who said at once that this was rank treachery and Mountbatten should have nothing to do with it. Mountbatten agreed with Zuckerman.<br>
<br>Two days later, King published an article in the <span class="italic">Mirror</span> under his own name entitled &#145;Enough is enough&#146;. It read:<blockquote>Mr Wilson and his government have lost all credit and we are now threatened with the greatest financial crisis in history. It is not to be resolved by lies about our reserves but only by a fresh start under a fresh leader.</blockquote>The City was appalled. King had resigned the previous night from his directorship of the Bank of England. The pound had a bad day. The Labour Party's reaction was to give stronger support to Wilson. Three weeks later the directors of IPC unanimously dismissed King.<br>
<br>King had served Fleet Street well as chairman of the Newspaper Publishers Association from 1961 to 1968. He put a stop for a year or two to cheque-book journalism and made the Press Council more credible. In his retirement he wrote articles for <span class="italic">The Times</span>, and produced his autobiography and diaries. The diaries further injured his name because many people felt he had betrayed their confidences.<br>
<br>To lift his low spirits, King required stimulating company and people found him a likeable host at luncheons and dinners. The whole of his professional life was spent in newspapers. He shared his uncle Rothermere's gift for finance but lacked his uncle Northcliffe's genius for popular journalism. King was 6 feet 4 inches tall, a commanding, burly figure with penetrating blue eyes, a quick smile, and, in later life, abundant grey hair.<br>
<br>King retired eventually to Ireland with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75434/', "Dame Ruth Railton (1915&#150;2001)")</script>, musician and founder and musical director of the National Youth Orchestra. They had married on 6 October 1962, after King and his first wife were divorced in the same year. She was the daughter of David Railton, army chaplain and rector of Liverpool. Her lively personality brought him prolonged happiness for the first time. King died on 17 April 1987 at his home, The Pavilion, 23 Greenfield Park, Dublin, where he had lived for the last part of his life.<br>
