</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cornwallis, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1518/19&#150;1604), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was the eldest son of Sir John Cornwallis (<i>c</i>.1491&#150;1544), steward of the household of Prince Edward from 1538 to 1544, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Edward Sulyard of Otes, Essex. He was admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1539. Thomas had married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1581), daughter of Sir John Jerningham of Somerleyton, Suffolk, by 1540 and was knighted at Westminster on 1 December 1548. In the summer of 1549 he joined other East Anglian gentry under the command of William Parr, first marquess of Northampton, to quell the rebellion led by Robert Ket. Cornwallis was taken prisoner when the rebels captured Norwich, but regained his freedom after the earl of Warwick defeated Ket's forces. Perhaps because of that assistance to the government, in 1553 Cecil listed Cornwallis as a supporter of Queen Jane. As sheriff in that year of Norfolk and Suffolk, Cornwallis was swept up in the succession crisis of July 1553. In response to Northumberland's letter, he had dutifully proclaimed Lady Jane at Ipswich, but Thomas Poley's declaration of Mary the same day left him wondering which side to support. According to Wingfield's account he stood at &#145;the crossroad&#146; as he weighed Mary's legitimate claim and local popularity against the armaments and &#145;the wealth of the entire kingdom together with the nobility&#146;  (MacCulloch, <span class="italic"><i>Vita</i></span>, 255&#150;6). Reliable news indicating the possibility of violence and London's dissatisfaction with Northumberland induced Cornwallis to change his mind. He proclaimed Mary and rushed to swear allegiance as she made her way to Framlingham Castle on 12 July. Mary rewarded him with a seat on her council and appointed his wife to her household as a lady of the privy chamber.<br>
<br>Cornwallis represented Gatton, Surrey, in Mary's first parliament, but his increasingly onerous assignments often took him away from the court and council. In October 1553 he was appointed with Sir Robert Bowes to treat with the Scottish commissioners on border matters, and a code of march law was agreed by them at Berwick on 4 December. Cornwallis played a leading part in attempts to defuse Wyatt's rebellion. On 22 January 1554 Mary sent him with Sir Edward Hastings to Dartford to confer with Wyatt, whom they were instructed to tell that she &#145;marvelled&#146; at his &#145;unnatural stire and commotion&#146; for &#145;thimpeachment of the marriage&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 11/2/9). Nothing came of these approaches, and in March Cornwallis served on the commission for Wyatt's trial. In the previous month he was dispatched with Lord William Howard and Sir Edward Hastings to bring the Princess Elizabeth from Ashridge in Hertfordshire to London. They found her &#145;willing and conformable&#146; although she tried to delay the journey on the grounds of her recent illness. When his political allies, the conservative and Catholic members of the council, suggested sending Elizabeth to the Tower, Cornwallis joined the princess's supporters in opposing that plan. As a councillor and MP for Grampound, Cornwall, in Mary's second parliament he joined those who tried to block Gardiner's plan for a speedy Catholic restoration. On 7 May 1554 he was appointed treasurer of Calais under his cousin, Sir Thomas Wentworth, second Lord Wentworth; he remained there until about two months before the town fell into the hands of the French in January 1558. The suspicions of Sir Thomas's complicity with the French which are recorded in the lines:<blockquote>
<div>Who built Brome Hall? Sir Thomas Cornwallis<br>
</div>
<div>How did he build it? By selling of Calais.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>appear to have been unfounded. Wentworth, Cornwallis, and others at Calais had warned the queen of the weakness of the garrison, and urgently requested a larger force.<br>
<br>On 25 December 1557 Cornwallis was made comptroller of the household in the place of Sir Robert Rochester, and in the following month he was elected MP for Suffolk. In her will Mary named him one of her six assistant executors. But at the end of 1558 Elizabeth removed him from his post in the household as well as from the privy council, and he retired to Suffolk. As a Catholic, a trusted servant of Mary, and a client of the duke of Norfolk, he was an object of suspicion after the northern rising in 1569. Cornwallis was arrested with his son-in-law Sir Thomas Kitson, and both men were interrogated about their involvement with Norfolk and their religious practice. After remaining in custody for a year Cornwallis made his submission on 20 June 1570, protesting loyalty to the queen. He agreed to conform to the extent that &#145;Almyghte God wyll gyve me grace to be further persuadyd&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/43/10). Cornwallis exemplified that generation of Catholics who were torn between their loyalty to the crown and their faith. The question of religious preference, loyalty, and preferment split his family as well. His sons William, whose unsuccessful attempts to forge a career at court caused his father considerable concern, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6337/', "Charles Cornwallis")</script>, later ambassador to Spain, conformed, while his wife and daughters remained Catholic. Cornwallis attended church for a time, but while others prayed on their knees, he was reported to have sat reading Catholic devotional works. By 1578 he had returned to recusancy, and he had become involved in what became the long-running dispute over the legitimacy of the secret marriage of his youngest daughter, Mary, a devout Catholic, to the young earl of Bath. His long-standing friendship with Lord Burghley could not solve Mary's problem, but it did protect Cornwallis and his family from the most severe consequences of recusancy.<br>
<br>Cornwallis remained recusant while also continuing to protest his loyalty to the crown. In a letter to Lord Burghley, dated 9 July 1584, transmitting a copy of his letter to the bishop of Norwich justifying his non-attendance at church, he asserted that &#145;no action of his life discovered a disobedient or unquiet thought towards her majesty&#146;, but &#145;much unquietness bredd in myselfe to satisfy Hir Majesty&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/172/17). His name, along with the female members of his family, continued to appear on Suffolk recusant rolls until his death on 24 December 1604 in the eighty-sixth year of his life. Wingfield had described him in 1553 as &#145;a young man of ready eloquence and conspicuous worth&#146;, and a portrait of 1590 depicts a handsome and sensitive man. He was buried on 28 December in the church in Brome, Suffolk, where the inscription on the monument erected to his memory notes his loyalty to the crown. His son William survived him by only seven years and died in 1611 leaving a year-old son, Frederick (1610&#150;1662), later first Baron Cornwallis, and the estates in the hands of Frederick's mother, Jane [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6342/', "Bacon, Jane")</script>].<br>
