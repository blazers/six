<span class="headword">Probert,  William</span>  (1790&#150;1870), <span class="occ">Unitarian minister</span>, was born on 11 August 1790 at Painscastle, Radnorshire, where his parents farmed a small freehold. He was brought up by two bachelor uncles who intended that he take orders in the Church of England, but he became a Wesleyan Methodist, serving as a local preacher in Bolton, Leeds, and Liverpool, and in Staffordshire. In 1814 he married Margaret Carr (1790/91&#150;1866) of Broxton, Cheshire, with whom he had six children.<br>
<br>In 1815, while stationed at Alnwick in Northumberland, through the influence of William Turner (1761&#150;1859), minister at Newcastle, Probert adopted Unitarian views. He was appointed in 1821 to the Unitarian chapel at Walmsley, near Bolton, Lancashire. Probert found the place encumbered with debt and the people disheartened and scattered. He succeeded in gathering around him a loyal congregation, to which he ministered for nearly fifty years; Walmsley Chapel was commonly known in the district as &#145;old Probert's chapel&#146;. He often went on foot to conduct Sunday evening services at other chapels in the neighbourhood.<br>
<br>Probert was a man with a good sense of humour and eccentric habits. He noted that, for reasons of conscience, he had sacrificed the prospect of attending Oxford and proudly avowed that he was self-educated. His knowledge of Hebrew was extensive: he published a favourably noticed grammar (1832), a lexicon (1850), and <span class="italic">The Laws of Hebrew Poetry</span> (1860). But his greatest interest and mastery lay in the Welsh language. He published <span class="italic">The Godolin, being Translations from the Welsh</span> (1820) and <span class="italic">The Ancient Laws of Cambria</span> (1823), and his historical essay on Flintshire castles was awarded a medal at the Denbigh Eisteddfod in 1828. He also wrote a history of Walmsley Chapel, which appeared in the <span class="italic">Christian Reformer</span> in 1834. He died at Dimple, Turton, on 1 April 1870 and was buried on 7 April in the graveyard attached to his chapel.<br>
