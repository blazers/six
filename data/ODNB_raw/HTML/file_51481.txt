<span class="headword">Corvan,  Edward <span class="st"> [Ned]</span></span>  (1830&#150;1865), <span class="occ">entertainer and songwriter</span>, was born in Liverpool of Irish parents, but was brought up from the age of four in Newcastle upon Tyne. Three years after the move his father, Matthew Corvan, a mason, died, and the young Corvan tramped the streets in search of odd jobs to help the family budget. He was eventually apprenticed to a sailmaker but as a stage-struck teenager he forsook his indentures to join the company of Billy Purvis's music-hall, the Victoria Theatre, in the capacities of small-part actor, scenery painter, orchestra violinist and <i>entr'acte</i> singer. He soon began to write his own songs on local topics, setting them in time-honoured fashion to existing traditional or popular tunes. He achieved considerable success with items as disparate as &#145;Jimmy McKenny&#146;, a lament for a fairground and racecourse drummer and conjuror, and &#145;He wad be a Noodle&#146;, a good-humoured but sharp reproach to those who volunteered for the militia.<br>
<br>In 1849 Corvan moved to the newly opened Olympic Music Hall as resident singer and songwriter. In addition he played the violin&#151;his standard was up to Paganini's <span class="italic">Carnaval de Venise</span>&#151;and did impromptu cartoons in chalk on a blackboard. He adopted costume, either male or female, appropriate to his songs, delivered prose monologues between verses, and engaged in impromptu repartee with members of his audiences. In what was probably his best-loved song, &#145;The Toon Improvement Bill, or, Ne Pleyce noo ti Play&#146; (a complaint at the loss of recreational space when Newcastle Central Station was built in 1849) he came on &#145;as a schoolboy in a white pinafore, with leathern belt, and trundling his hoop&#146;. The comment is from an eye-witness, who adds that Corvan had &#145;a bony, muscular frame, surmounted by a head which suggested a certain kind of rough power, and a countenance whose expression betokened infinite good nature and a rare fund of comicality&#146;, and that &#145;his appearance on the stage created quite a <i>furore</i>, altogether eclipsing the other performers&#146;  (Embleton Smith, 522).<br>
<br>Corvan married Isabella (1828&#150;1890), daughter of Robert Arrowsmith, mariner, at Tynemouth on 17 March 1851, when he was not yet twenty-one. His health was not good, and he died from tuberculosis at Haddoch's Court, Newgate Street, Newcastle, on 31 August 1865, aged thirty-five. He was buried in an unmarked grave in St Andrew's cemetery. In his lifetime Corvan had performed all over the Tyneside area. He was celebrated both for the skill of his performances and for the fervour of his advocacy of the cause of working men and women, who were the protagonists of his songs. His subjects included sports such as rowing (a local passion), prize-fighting and horse-racing; the seamen's strikes of 1851 and the Hartley pit disaster of 1862; enforced emigration and adverse economic conditions. The tenor of his songs varied widely, from comic to satirical, from elegiac to indignant. Their language was the Tyneside vernacular, with sometimes irritating adaptations of standard spelling. They appeared as street ballads, singly or in groups of ten or twelve, were often reprinted, but gradually fell out of favour, although one turned up in oral tradition in Aberdeenshire in 1907. The first man on Tyneside to make a full-time profession of writing and singing local songs, Corvan retains a place in scholarly writing on the subject.<br>
