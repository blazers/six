<span class="headword">Collard,  Frederick William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1772, <em>d.</em> 1860), <span class="occ">piano manufacturer</span>, son of William and Thamosin Collard, was baptized at Wiveliscombe, Somerset, on 21 June 1772. At the age of fourteen he went to London and worked for Longman, Lukey, and Broderip, music publishers and piano makers, at 26 Cheapside. In 1799 Longman &amp; Co. fell into commercial difficulties, and a new company, consisting of John Longman, Muzio Clementi, Frederick Augustus Hyde, F. W. Collard, Josiah Banger, and David Davis, took over the business, but on 28 June 1800 Longman and Hyde retired, and the firm henceforth was known as Muzio Clementi &amp; Co. After some time Collard's brother William Frederick became a partner, and on 24 June 1817 Banger left the company. On 24 June 1831 the partnership between F. W. Collard, W. F. Collard, and Clementi expired, and the two brothers continued the business until 24 June 1842, when W. F. Collard retired, and F. W. Collard, then sole proprietor, took into partnership his two nephews, Frederick William Collard jun., and Charles Lukey Collard. After 1832 the pianos which had long borne the name of Clementi began to be called Collard and Collard, and many patents were taken out for improvements in both the action and the frame of the instruments; Clementi's serial numbers were continued in Collard and Collard's square pianos. The firm soon gave up the business of music publishing, and confined themselves to piano making, except that they had also the contract for supplying bugles, fifes, and drums to the regiments of the East India Company until 1858. To the Great Exhibition of 1851 Collard sent a square semi-grand, which was awarded the council medal by the musical jury (the award was not confirmed, owing to some feeling of jealousy), and two small cottage pianos, which subsequently sold well.<br>
<br>The firm suffered twice from large fires; on 20 March 1807 the factory in Tottenham Court Road was burnt to the ground, and on 10 December 1851 a new factory, in Oval Road, Camden Town, was entirely destroyed. F. W. Collard died at his home at 26 Cheapside on 31 January 1860, aged eighty-eight, having lived in the same house since his arrival in London in 1786. <a name="cosubject_5904"></a><span class="headword">William Frederick Collard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1776, <em>d.</em> 1866)<span class="occ"></span>, his brother and partner, was baptized at Wiveliscombe on 25 August 1776, and, in addition to an inventive genius respecting improvements in pianos, also developed a taste for lyric poetry. He married Sarah Dean, the granddaughter of the Essex psalmodist and composer John Arnold Collard. He retired from business in 1842, and died at Folkestone on 11 October 1866.<br>
<br>In 1929 the Chappell Piano Company took over Collard, whose business had already run down, and production stopped in 1971. A fire destroyed all Collard records in 1964.<br>
