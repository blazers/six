<span class="headword">Coote,  Henry Charles</span>  (1815&#150;1885), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6241/', "Charles Coote (bap. 1760, d. 1835)")</script>, historian. He was admitted a proctor in Doctors' Commons in 1840, practised in the probate court for seventeen years, and, when that court was thrown open to the whole legal profession in 1857, became a solicitor. He wrote several books on professional legal subjects, including <span class="italic">Practices of the Ecclesiastical Courts</span> (1846) and <span class="italic">Practice of the High Court of Admiralty</span> (1860). He was best-known as a historian, however, and devoted much of his leisure to the study of early English history, folklore, and foreign literature. He frequently travelled to Italy, and was an accomplished linguist. He was a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, a founder of the Folklore Society, and an industrious contributor to learned periodicals.<br>
<br>Coote's name was chiefly associated with his attempts to prove that the Roman settlers in Britain were not wiped out by the Germanic migrations of the fifth century, and that the laws and customs observed in Anglo-Saxon England were mainly of Roman origin. This theory was first advanced by Coote in articles published in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, and in 1864 the material was expanded into a small volume entitled <span class="italic">A Neglected Fact in English History</span>. Little attention was paid to Coote's researches until 1870, when E. A. Freeman fiercely attacked them in <span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span>. Coote was stimulated to revise his work, and in 1878 he published a larger volume entitled <span class="italic">The Romans in Britain</span>. The importance of Coote's conclusions were acknowledged by Frederic Seebohm in his <span class="italic">English Village Community</span> (1883). Several papers on the same subject were contributed by Coote to the <span class="italic">Transactions of the London and Middlesex Arch&aelig;ological Society</span>. Coote's interpretation of the fall of Roman Britain and the creation of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms was a small counterpoise to the then prevailing whig historiography, itself driven in part by contemporary liberal politics. The notion of continuity of institutions and ideas between the Roman and Germanic eras, though put in an extreme and over-simplified form by Coote, became one of the key concerns of research in the field in the later twentieth century.<br>
<br>Coote's last published work was a paper in the January 1885 issue of the <span class="italic">Folklore Quarterly Journal</span>, to which he was a very frequent contributor. Stricken with paralysis about 1882, he owed his partial recovery to the devoted nursing of his wife, Fanny Coote, but then died suddenly at his home, 13 Westgate Terrace, Redcliffe Square, West Brompton, London, on 4 January 1885. He was buried at Kensal Green on 10 January.<br>
