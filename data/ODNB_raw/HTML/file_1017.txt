<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Baddeley <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Snow]</span>,  Sophia</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1744, <em>d.</em> 1786), <span class="occ">actress and singer</span>, was baptized on 12 October 1744 at St Mary-at-Lambeth, the daughter of Valentine Snow (<i>d</i>. 1770) and his wife, Mary, and not in the parish of St Margaret, Westminster, in 1745, as stated in <span class="italic">The Memoirs of Mrs Sophia Baddeley</span> (1787). Valentine Snow was London's leading trumpeter, for whom Handel wrote virtuoso parts in his oratorios, including &#145;The trumpet shall sound&#146; in <span class="italic">Messiah</span>. Sophia was taught music by her father, but finding his lessons &#145;a task of labour&#146;  (Steele, 1.3) she eloped with the actor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1016/', "Robert Baddeley (1733&#150;1794)")</script>. They married with Valentine Snow as a witness on 24 January 1764, and that September she made her d&eacute;but at Drury Lane as Ophelia. Despite her beauty, her career developed slowly, and in January 1766 the prompter Hopkins found her performance of Ophelia &#145;very bad, all but the singing&#146;  (Stone, 2.1147). However, Thomas Snagg, who acted with her at Manchester in summer 1765, remembered her as the best and most beautiful Ophelia he ever saw, and David Garrick later described her in the role as an &#145;inspired idiot&#146;  (Wilson, 11). Following singing lessons from Thomas and Michael Arne and coaching from the actor Charles Holland she drew audiences to the theatre with her portrayal of tender heroines in comedies and musical pieces: &#145;One admired her person, another her voice, and a third her acting&#146;  (<span class="italic">Theatrical Biography</span>, 24). When she played Fanny in a command performance of <span class="italic">The Clandestine Marriage</span>, by George Colman and David Garrick, the royal family so admired her that they commissioned a portrait of her in the role from Johan Zoffany. She sang at Vauxhall and Ranelagh gardens and at Stratford upon Avon in September 1769 for Garrick's Shakespeare jubilee celebrations. There Boswell admired &#145;that beautiful insinuating creature&#146;  (Brady and Pottle, 299) as she sang &#145;Sweet Willy O!&#146;, a song in Shakespeare's praise which she was to make extraordinarily popular in London.<br>
<br>After about three years of marriage Sophia Baddeley became the mistress of a rich merchant and then of the actor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13515/', "Charles Holland (1733&#150;1769)")</script>&#151;both affairs reputedly being condoned by her husband. Holland died of smallpox on 7 December 1769, and she was so distraught that she did not appear on stage for nearly a fortnight. George Garrick, Drury Lane's treasurer, agreed to pay her salary directly to her rather than to her husband, which led to a bloodless duel between the two men in March 1770. A legal separation was arranged, after which the Baddeleys spoke to each other only when in character on stage together. Dissolute aristocrats and wealthy men flocked around Mrs Baddeley, and success turned her head. She left Drury Lane at the beginning of the 1771&#150;2 season after David Garrick refused her demands for special privileges and an increase of &pound;3 a week and lived in great style under the protection of various lovers, of whom the chief appear to have been Captain John Hanger and Peniston Lamb, first Viscount Melbourne. When the Pantheon opened in 1772 the management attempted to exclude women of ill repute, but her aristocratic admirers insisted on her admission. She was generous, affectionate, and wildly extravagant. Her debts forced her to return to Drury Lane in 1774 and to act in Ireland and Liverpool in the summers of 1778 and 1779.<br>
<br>Mrs Baddeley made her last appearance at Drury Lane on 1 December 1780 in the title role of Arne's opera <span class="italic">Artaxerxes</span>. She continued to take lovers, progressively lower in the social scale, while her career and health degenerated. In winter and spring 1781&#150;2 she sang at De Loutherbourg's scenic light-and-sound show, <span class="italic">Eidophusikon</span>, and wrote begging letters for help in supporting her young children, including a five-year-old son. To escape her creditors she fled from London and acted in Dublin (December 1782&#150;January 1783) and then in Edinburgh. In May and June 1783 she appeared with Tate Wilkinson's company in York and Leeds, but at her York benefit she was &#145;so stupidly intoxicated with Laudanum, that it was with great difficulty she finished the performance&#146;  (Wilkinson, 2.151&#150;2). She performed at Edinburgh in summer 1783 and from January 1785, but by April she was unable to continue. In her final illness she was kept from starvation by contributions from fellow performers and the Drury Lane Fund. She died at her lodgings in Shakespeare Square, Edinburgh, on 1 July 1786.<br>
<br>The following year saw the publication of <span class="italic">The Memoirs of Mrs Sophia Baddeley by Mrs Elizabeth Steele</span>. Steele (1741&#150;1787), who was a school friend of Baddeley, had set up an establishment with the actress in 1769, the year in which her husband Hugh John Steele (<i>d</i>. 1789), was confined to the king's bench prison for debt. The relationship between Elizabeth Steele and Sophia Baddeley seems to have been one of mutual support and exploitation. Steele claimed that she did not see Baddeley after 1780, but Tate Wilkinson recalled that &#145;a <i>Mrs. Stell</i>&#146; was with her at York in 1783 and implied that she was sponging on Baddeley  (Wilkinson, 2.152). The <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> were published &#145;for the Author&#146; by John Trusler's Literary Press on or shortly before 2 June 1787, but Steele claimed that Trusler had not paid her the money due to her and advertised a self-published edition on 5 July. This led to an acrimonious dispute with Trusler over publication rights. Towards the end of October 1787 Steele was being sought on a charge of forging an acceptance to a bill of exchange, a capital offence, with a ten guinea reward offered. She died in wretched circumstances on 14 November at an inn in Bishopsgate Street, where she had been living under an assumed name. How far Steele was the actual writer of the <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> is difficult to ascertain, but contemporary reviewers assumed that her role had been to provide material to Alexander Bicknell, who had acted as ghost writer for the <span class="italic">Apology for the Life of George Anne Bellamy</span> (1785). More recently, William Jackson has been suggested as Steele's collaborator.<br>
