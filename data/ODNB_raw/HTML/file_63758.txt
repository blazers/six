<span class="headword">Lynch,  John</span>  (1697&#150;1760), <span class="occ">dean of Canterbury and pluralist</span>, was born on 5 December 1697 at Staple-next-Wingham, Kent, one of two surviving sons of John Lynch (<i>d</i>. 1733) and his wife, Sarah, daughter of Francis Head esquire of Rochester. His father, whose family had been settled at Staple for many generations, was a colonel of militia and deputy lieutenant who served as high sheriff for Kent in 1714. After education at King's School, Canterbury, under Mr Smith, Lynch matriculated at St John's College, Cambridge, on 24 June 1714, where he proceeded BA in 1718, MA in 1721, and DD in 1728. Following ordination in December 1721, he quickly attracted the patronage of William Wake, the archbishop of Canterbury, by whom in 1723 he was appointed prebend of the fourth stall in Canterbury Cathedral and rector of All Hallows, Bread Street, London, which he exchanged for All Hallows-the-Great in 1730. The rectory of Sundridge, Kent, was added in 1725. Further preferment followed his marriage to the archbishop's youngest daughter, Mary, in 1728: the mastership of St Cross Hospital, Winchester, and, in 1731, the valuable rectories of Ickham and Bishopsbourne, and the sinecure rectory of Aynesford. At this point Lynch relinquished Sundridge and his London living. On 18 January 1734 he was installed as dean of Canterbury, succeeding Elias Sydall, and in 1735 he became treasurer of Salisbury. During this time he resided principally at Lambeth Palace, attending to the affairs of his father-in-law, the archbishop. After Wake's death in January 1737, Lynch divided his time between the deanery at Canterbury and his family home at Staple, 8 miles away.<br>
<br>Lynch's accumulation of preferment attracted critical notice, even in an age accustomed to such practices. His conduct inspired at least one satirical print, <span class="italic">An Ass Loaded with Preferments</span> (BM 2269; Stephens, vol. 3, pt 1), published in February 1737, and by this time it was generally believed that his &#145;taking advantage of his father-in-law, the Archbishop of Canterbury's weak condition, and presenting himself to all that falls in the Archbishop's gift &hellip; was &hellip; very scandalous&#146;  (<span class="italic">Egmont Diary</span>, 2.263). This charge was forcefully repeated in <span class="italic">The Life of Dean L&#151;nch</span>, an anonymous work of 1748, which alleged that ambition alone had caused Lynch to marry a wife who was &#145;exceeding plain in Person and much deformed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 8) and that his selfishness had led him to neglect his brothers and aged father, and driven a younger sister to despair. The same work also charged Lynch with rapacious behaviour towards the tenantry on the cathedral estates, maintaining that &#145;Yeomen and Farmers he rated as his Dogs&#146;  (ibid., 29).<br>
<br>The accuracy of these claims may be doubted. Lynch and his wife (who outlived him by several years) had a large family: five daughters and two sons, one of whom, Sir William Lynch, served King George III as envoy to the court of Turin. Friends pointed out that some of his appointments, notably the mastership of the hospitals of St Nicholas, Harbledown, and St John, Canterbury, brought no emoluments and much trouble, and that, elsewhere, his generosity was commensurate with his wealth. He was said to have expended above &pound;3000 of his own money on repairs to his prebendal houses and deanery, and to have been a liberal and hospitable supporter of a wide range of public charities. The high reputation of the King's School at this time was also credited, in part, to his interest and encouragement. As a clergyman he was respected. In 1747 he was nominated prolocutor of the lower house of convocation, and he was considered a good preacher, although no remarkable qualities are evident in his only published sermon, delivered before the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in 1735. In 1757 Lynch suffered a paralytic stroke and was granted a royal dispensation, excusing him from all duty. He made a partial recovery, and continued to entertain at the deanery, but his faculties began to leave him some months before his death, which took place at Canterbury on 25 May 1760. He was buried in the church at Staple.<br>
