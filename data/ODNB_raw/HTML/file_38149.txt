<span class="headword">Wood,  Nicholas</span>  (1795&#150;1865), <span class="occ">civil and mining engineer</span>, was born at the farm of Daniel at Sourmires in the parish of Ryton, co. Durham, on 24 April 1795, the son of Nicholas Wood, tenant farmer. He was of a delicate constitution in early life, and lived with his uncle at Hallgarth, near Winlaton. As a pupil at the village school in Crawcrook, his abilities were so marked as to attract the attention of his father's landlord, Sir Thomas Liddell (later first Baron Ravensworth). It was to Liddell's collieries in Killingworth, Northumberland, that Wood was sent in April 1811 to learn the business of a viewer or colliery manager.<br>
<br>George Stephenson was also at Killingworth at that time. He was fourteen years older than Wood, and the two were soon drawn into a lasting friendship by their common interests and ambitions. It was a tribute to Stephenson's opinion of him that his son Robert was apprenticed to Wood from 1819 to 1821 at Killingworth. Wood assisted Stephenson in the development of his safety lamp, which was first tested in 1815. He was closely associated with Stephenson in his experiments with steam locomotives, and in 1821 accompanied him to Darlington, where they met Edward Pease and discussed the projected Stockton&#150;Darlington railway line.<br>
<br>As a result of his experience and observations Wood was able to publish in 1825 <span class="italic">A Practical Treatise on Rail-Roads, and Interior Communication in General</span>, a classic work of early railway literature, in which he discussed the various types of &#145;motive power&#146; then in use: self-acting planes, fixed steam-engine planes, horses, and locomotive steam engines. The work appeared in three subsequent editions, in 1831, 1832, and 1838, considerably enlarged and brought up to date. In 1827 Wood's reputation in railway matters was such that he was invited to give evidence before committees of both houses of parliament on the <span class="roman">Liverpool and Manchester Railway Bill</span>. In 1829 he was one of the three judges for the Rainhill locomotive trials on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, won by the Stephensons' <i>Rocket</i>. In 1845 he joined the &#145;battle of the gauges&#146;, taking sides with the Stephensons and the &#145;narrow-gauge&#146; lobby.<br>
<br>Wood's knowledge of coalmining and the geology of the north of England coalfields was such that his assistance was frequently called upon by mine owners and speculators, and he acquired interests in a number of mines in the area. Until 1844 he lived at Killingworth, but he then moved to Hetton Hall, co. Durham, and assumed the management of the collieries belonging to the Hetton Coal Company, in which he was a partner. He took a prominent part in official investigations of the coal industry, most notably with regard to safety. He reported to the select committee on accidents in 1835 that using men instead of children would, in many cases, mean that collieries could not be worked at a profit. He contributed to improvements in underground haulage technology, and was involved in the discussions leading to the <span class="roman">Mines Inspection Act</span> of 1851. In 1855 he examined all the candidates for the new mining inspectorate.<br>
<br>Wood was elected the first president of the North of England Institute of Mining Engineers (to which he subsequently read many papers) on its formation at Newcastle in 1852. He became a member of the institutions of Civil Engineers (1829) and Mechanical Engineers (1858), and a fellow of the Geological Society (1843) and the Royal Society (1864). Critical of the Royal School of Mines and its failure to link theory with mining practice, he attempted to establish a college of his own in the north-east in the 1850s, &#145;for the improvement and teaching of mining science, especially as applicable to coal mines&#146;  (C. Knight, <span class="italic">The English Cyclopaedia</span>, 1856). This unfortunately failed because of lack of financial support. Wood's most prominent characteristics were plain, practical good sense, perseverance in his pursuits, thoroughness in his investigations, and an equanimity of temper. Wood married Maria Forster, daughter of Collingwood Forster Lindsay of Alnwick, clerk to the magistrates of Northumberland. He and his wife had four sons and three daughters; but Wood was a widower some years before his own death on 19 December 1865 at 49 Sussex Gardens, Hyde Park, London. He was buried in the churchyard at Hetton.<br>
