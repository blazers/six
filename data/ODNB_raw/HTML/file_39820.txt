<span class="headword">Roberts,  Colin Henderson</span>  (1909&#150;1990), <span class="occ">classical scholar and publisher</span>, was born on 8 June 1909 in Queen Elizabeth Walk, Stoke Newington, London, the second son and second of five children (four sons and one daughter) of Robert Lewis Roberts, the head of a family building firm founded in the previous generation, and his wife, Muriel Grace Henderson. The family had strong literary and clerical connections. Colin's elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56782/', "Brian Richard Roberts (1906&#150;1988)")</script>, had a distinguished career in journalism, and was editor of the <span class="italic">Sunday Telegraph</span> (1961&#150;76); like Colin, he ended his days as an honorary fellow of St John's College, Oxford. Colin followed Brian to Merchant Taylors' School and to St John's. At school he distinguished himself as a scholar (and sometimes on the stage, notably as Cassandra in Aeschylus's <span class="italic">Agamemnon</span>), and his university career followed its expected course, with first classes in both classical honour moderations and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1931), and a Craven fellowship (1932&#150;4). His classics tutors, J. U. Powell and F. W. Hall, had both been interested in the discoveries of papyrology and in the history of the book in ancient times. This was the subject to which Roberts devoted himself. He took part in excavations in Egypt (Karanis) under the auspices of the University of Michigan in 1932&#150;3 and 1933&#150;4; he studied also with W. Schubart in Berlin; and in 1935&#150;6 published important biblical papyri from the John Rylands Library. During all this period he was first a junior, then a senior research fellow of St John's.<br>
<br>The Second World War interrupted his studies, and, like many scholars of that time, Roberts spent five years in intelligence work in London and at Bletchley. He returned to St John's in 1946 as fellow and tutor in classics. In 1947 he married Alison Muriel, daughter of Reginald Haynes Barrow, classical scholar and inspector of schools. They had one daughter.<br>
<br>Also in 1947 Roberts became a fellow of the British Academy, and he played an active part in the academy's affairs, serving as foreign secretary (1960&#150;69), until 1979, when its failure to expel Anthony Blunt led him, with others, to resign his fellowship. In 1948 he became reader in documentary papyrology at Oxford, and in 1951&#150;2 he spent a year at the Institute of Advanced Study at Princeton. His research in these years centred on the publication of the Antinoopolis papyri; but in 1955 he published a long essay, &#145;The codex&#146;  (<span class="italic">PBA</span>, 40, 1955), which gave a pioneering account of the most important development in book production before the invention of printing, namely the replacement of the papyrus roll by &#145;a collection of sheets, folded or fastened together at the back or spine, and usually protected by covers&#146;, in other words the book as we know it. With his close friend T. C. Skeat, he revised and enlarged this essay in 1983.<br>
<br>Having rejected an opportunity to become professor of Greek at Edinburgh, in 1954 he gave up, as it seemed, his scholarly career to succeed A. L. P. Norrington as secretary to the delegates of the Oxford University Press (he had been a delegate since 1946). He thus had charge of a great publishing house for twenty years, in a time of much change and some difficulty. It was natural that he should have felt most deeply involved in the great enterprises in classical studies and theology which were a special excellence of the press: the completion of <span class="italic">A Patristic Greek Lexicon</span> by G. W. H. Lampe, the continuation of E. A. Lowe's <span class="italic">Codices Latini antiquiores</span>, the <span class="italic">Oxford Latin Dictionary</span> under Peter Glare, and above all the <span class="italic">New English Bible</span>. But his remarkable capacity for detail and rapid analysis enabled him to exercise his great administrative ability over a wide range of the press's affairs, although they may have also led him to be less interested in systematic delegation than circumstances came to require. In the latter years of his tenure, the organization of the press became seriously inappropriate to the increased scale of its operations. It comprised two separate businesses, one in Oxford, which undertook the learned publishing, and the other in London, which had responsibility for all distribution and marketing and for overseas operations other than those in New York. As the financial situation deteriorated, radical reform became necessary. Roberts was energetically engaged in his later years with the planning, which was to involve the transfer of the whole business to the Oxford site.<br>
<br>On his retirement in 1974, Roberts once again became a senior research fellow of St John's, proposing to the college to work on &#145;Manuscript, society, and belief in early Christian Egypt&#146;. The book, given as the British Academy Schweich lectures, appeared in 1979. It demonstrates in its close argument Roberts's command of verbal scholarship, his historical insight (he viewed scholarship as a means to the understanding of the past, not as an end in itself), and his profound concern, grounded in his own spirituality, with the Christian tradition. After a time, he and his wife retired to Hursey House, Broadwindsor, in west Dorset, where they enjoyed country life, animals, the village, and the church. As a lay reader (1982&#150;5), he acquired a reputation for the excellence of his sermons.<br>
<br>Roberts was a notably handsome young man&#151;to a famous refugee scholar in the 1930s he seemed the very type of Oxford youth&#151;and he retained his slim and elegant physique until a car accident not long before he died left him bent and shrunken. He was a man whose gentle manners, immaculate courtesy, and great kindness (especially to the disadvantaged or insecure) sometimes concealed, but could never diminish, the sharpness of vision, strong sense of duty, and tireless energy with which he pursued his aims, whether in scholarship or in the wide world. He was appointed CBE in 1973. Roberts died in Broadwindsor on 11 February 1990.<br>
