<span class="headword">Temple,  William Johnson</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1739, <em>d.</em> 1796), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and essayist</span>, was baptized on 20 December 1739 in Berwick upon Tweed, the eldest of the five children of William Temple (1710&#150;1774), collector of customs for Berwick upon Tweed, merchant, and mayor of Berwick (1749&#150;50 and 1753&#150;4), and his wife, Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1747), younger daughter of Alexander Johnston, merchant, of Newcastle upon Tyne. She brought to the marriage, along with other property, the farmed estate of Allerdean, some 4 miles south-west of Berwick, which Temple inherited.<br>
<br>About 1751 Temple seems to have begun attending the free grammar school established by the Berwick corporation. He left Berwick in autumn 1755 for the University of Edinburgh, where he struck up the lifelong friendship with his fellow student James Boswell which is his main claim to fame. He next went to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, on 22 May 1758. As early as 2 May 1759 he was admitted to the Middle Temple and took his name off the books at Trinity Hall on 20 November 1761. He seems to have spent the next eighteen months mainly in London. His father had become bankrupt by the end of 1762 and Temple had drawn on his own (Johnston) funds to give the creditors 5<i>s</i>. in the pound. Now considerably impoverished, when he was readmitted to Trinity Hall as a fellow-commoner on 22 June 1763 he had the church rather than the bar in mind. At Cambridge he made the acquaintance of Thomas Gray and a circle of the poet's young admirers.<br>
<br>On 28 June 1765 Temple graduated LLB. He was ordained priest on 21 September 1766 and on the following day was instituted to the rectory of Mamhead, about 10 miles from Exeter, on the presentation of his cousin once removed Wilmot Vaughan, fourth Viscount Lisburne. On 6 August 1767 Temple married Anne Stow (<i>bap</i>. 1741, <i>d</i>. 1793), youngest daughter of William Stow (1692?&#150;1753), like Temple's father twice mayor of Berwick, and his first wife, Anne Blake, sister of Sir Francis Blake FRS of Twisell Castle, some 9 miles south-west of Berwick. The Temples had eight children, of whom one, Francis (1770&#150;1863), ended up as an admiral, and another, Octavius (1784&#150;1834), became lieutenant-governor of Sierra Leone.<br>
<br>When the Temples settled at Mamhead in October 1767, the living was worth only &pound;80 a year. There were quarrels with the Lisburnes, as well as marital friction and money troubles, all of which made Temple so depressed that he seemed suicidal to Norton Nicholls in 1771. Nevertheless, Temple read the proofs of Boswell's <span class="italic">Account of Corsica</span> in 1767, visited Edinburgh in 1770 and 1773, when he met some of the literati, and received visits from Boswell at Mamhead in 1769 and 1775. In 1774 his 100-page <span class="italic">Essay on the Clergy</span> was published, which highlighted the social role of the clergy, defining a clergyman as &#145;a private and public teacher of religion and virtue&#146;  (p. 18), which drew from David Hume, who had seen the book in proof, the insulting counter-definition of &#145;a person appropriated to teach hypocrisy &amp; inculcate vice&#146;  (Temple to Boswell, 15 Feb 1774, <span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 1.340). In 1775 he made a new friend, the poet and dramatist Edward Jerningham, and began a rather tepid correspondence with him which lasted until 1793.<br>
<br>In Boswell's opinion, Temple excelled in writing &#145;characters&#146; of men and books, such as the well-known portrait of Gray, which first appeared in Temple's letter to Boswell of 3 September 1771, a month after Gray's death. Boswell sent it to the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span> where it was published anonymously and without authority in March 1772 (41.140) before being incorporated by William Mason with slight alterations in his life of Gray (1775) and then used by Johnson in his account of Gray in the <span class="italic">Lives of the Poets</span> (1779&#150;81). The character of Gray seems to have been typical of the remarks on authors which Temple wrote down in his &#145;green book&#146;, unfortunately lost, which impressed Boswell so much that it induced Temple to plan a volume of letters on literary and moral subjects addressed to Boswell. The work never materialized. A much longer and later sketch cuts a hero down to size&#151;<span class="italic">The character of Dr Johnson, with illustrations from Mrs Piozzi, Sir John Hawkins, and Mr Boswell</span>, published anonymously by Dilly in 1792. Though Temple asserts that Johnson's learning and talents have been overrated by his partial admirers, he cannot avoid praising the &#145;piety and good sense&#146; of the <span class="italic">Rambler</span> essays, and the &#145;noble&#146; dictionary.<br>
<br>On 9 September 1776 Temple was collated to the vicarage of St Gluvias near Penryn in Cornwall, a living worth over &pound;300 a year, but in the long run this advancement did little to curb his inveterate complaining about his lot. In 1779 he published anonymously <span class="italic">Moral and Historical Memoirs</span>, a 424-page book of eleven essays, staunchly whig and critical of absolute monarchy, but in the years that followed he was never able to complete the several works on Italian and church history he had planned. In the early 1780s he did much to further in Cornwall the movement for more equal representation in parliament, corresponding with the Yorkshire reformer Christopher Wyvill on the matter, and in the early 1790s he took the lead in founding the Cornwall County Library. He travelled to London in May 1790 with his daughter Nancy, paying a strained visit to Boswell and his daughter Veronica, and in August&#150;September 1792 Boswell, Veronica, and her younger sister Euphemia visited the Temples in Cornwall. In 1789 Temple had welcomed the storming of the Bastille, but in December 1790 he was converted to the anti-French position after reading Burke's <span class="italic">Reflections on the Revolution in France</span>. By the end of 1791 even parliamentary reform was suspect, and by 1794 France had become for him a country whose &#145;inhabitors ought to be wiped from the face of the Earth&#146;  (Temple to Boswell, 6 Dec 1791 and 30 Jan 1794, MSS Yale C2915, C2954).<br>
<br>During a visit of nearly two months to St Gluvias in 1794 Norton Nicholls secured Temple's consent to the marriage of his daughter Nancy to the Revd Charles Powlett, which Temple had previously opposed. Despite earlier friction, father and daughter spent three apparently enjoyable months in Suffolk as Nicholls's guests in 1795. Temple died at St Gluvias on 13 August 1796 of a severe abdominal complaint similar to that which had carried off his wife in 1793, whose age then is given as forty-six in the St Gluvias burial register and on the family gravestone in the churchyard, where Temple too was buried. Though both believed this, the evidence points to her having died aged fifty-two  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 1.132, n. 4). Temple bequeathed all his property, including the estate of Allerdean when sold, to be divided equally among his children, apart from a legacy of &pound;20 a year to his widowed sister Sarah Forster. Nancy was to be given &pound;1000 of her share at the time of her marriage.<br>
<br>Boswell's role in his correspondence with Temple became known in 1856, when the majority (97) of his surviving letters to Temple were published. But it was not until the twentieth century that the letters from Temple to Boswell were discovered, 338 in all. Temple told Boswell as much about his family, professional, and financial troubles as Boswell told him about his own, and was equally frank about his sexual needs and difficulties, as when, after his wife's death, he revealed his attraction to Susan Frood, the vicarage housekeeper, and the unsavoury attempts of Charles Powlett and Nancy to destroy Susan's reputation  (Temple to Boswell, various letters June 1793 to 3 Nov 1794, MSS Yale University).<br>
<br>In the religious sphere his letters show Temple deserting his Socinian and almost sceptical stance of 1763 for the orthodoxy of his middle and later years, while in the political dialogue he moved from his initial whig republicanism to the conviction that &#145;our own present Government&#146; was &#145;the wisest and best that mankind in any age or any country in the world were ever blessed with&#146;  (Temple to Boswell, 11 Dec 1792, MS Yale C2930). The correspondence as a whole provides<blockquote>an extraordinarily vivid and comprehensive picture of literary, professional, domestic, and intellectual life over a period of almost forty years. That period saw its share of differences and debates, long separations and less than successful reunions, grief, disappointment and disillusion; but what survived, indeed triumphed over, every vicissitude, is finally a friendship that held firm against all the tests time sent its way. (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 1.lix)</blockquote>
