<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hodson,  William Stephen Raikes</span>  (1821&#150;1858), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company</span>, was born on 19 March 1821 at Maisemore Court, near Gloucester, third son of the Revd George Hodson, chaplain to the bishop of Gloucester and later archdeacon of Stafford and canon of Lichfield, and his wife, Mary, daughter of John Stephen, a master of chancery. Hodson was educated at home, and from 1834 to 1840 at Rugby School, where he was head of his house. According to his former fag, &#145;Hodson was never really an Arnold man&#146;  (Cork, 11). He entered Trinity College, Cambridge in 1840, gaining his BA in 1844.<br>
<br>Hodson began his military career in Guernsey with a militia commission, but in 1845 entered the East India Company's service. He landed at Calcutta on 13 September 1845, went to Agra, and joined the 2nd Bengal grenadiers, then part of the governor-general's escort. He served in the First Anglo-Sikh War, at the battles of Mudki, Ferozeshahr, and Sobraon. He formed a poor opinion of the Bengal sepoy but was to develop a remarkable empathy with the Sikhs. He was soon after transferred to the 1st Bengal European fusiliers. In 1847 he was appointed adjutant of the corps of guides, and with them he gained the experience and displayed the powers which afterwards made him an outstanding leader of irregular cavalry and exceptional intelligence officer. For his services he received the thanks of the governor-general. When in 1849 the Punjab was annexed, he was transferred to the civil department as assistant commissioner, and was stationed for some time at Amritsar. After a spell in the hills establishing a school at Sanawar, Kasauli, for the children of British private soldiers, for which task he had been specially selected by Henry Lawrence, Hodson accompanied Lawrence on an expedition to Kashmir, newly taken from the Sikhs.<br>
<br>On 5 January 1852 at Calcutta, Hodson married Susan, widow of John Mitford of Exbury, Hampshire; their daughter, Olivia, was born in 1853 but died in infancy. Susan died in 1884. By the first week in March 1852 Hodson had resumed his duties at Kasauli as assistant commissioner; in September 1852 he was delighted to be given command of the guides. It was his success in dealing with incursions along the north-west frontier that brought Hodson to such prominent notice.<br>
<br>Hodson's career to this time had been successful; but his rapid rise, apparent arrogance, and outspoken criticism of others had made him enemies. There was confusion in the regimental accounts, and charges of dishonesty as well as of harsh treatment of his Indian soldiers were brought against him. An inquiry was held by a special military court, which ended its sittings in January 1855. Its report was unfavourable, and he was removed from command. Hodson appealed, and a second inquiry, under Major Reynell Taylor, after a long investigation, reported on 13 February 1856 exonerating Hodson. The second report was only sent in May 1857 to Sir Henry Daly, commandant of the guides, with a minute from Lord Canning expressing dissatisfaction and directing explanations. Daly was soon afterwards wounded, and Hodson, who temporarily took over command, obtained the report, which was found in his trunk after his death. Hodson also allegedly embezzled the funds of the Lawrence Asylum at Kasauli and the pay of another officer. Sir George Lawrence, Lord Lawrence, and apparently Lord Canning believed him guilty of embezzlement.<br>
<br>Hodson had rejoined the 1st fusiliers at Dagshai, practically beginning his military career again, but gaining the favourable attention of the commander-in-chief, General Anson. On 10 May 1857 occurred the outbreak of mutiny at Meerut, followed by the massacre of Delhi. Hodson rose to the opportunity, and, after going with the 1st fusiliers to Ambala and then to Karnal, the commander-in-chief ordered him to raise and command a new regiment of irregular horse, which became known as Hodson's Horse. He was also put in charge of the intelligence department, and operated a network of spies among the mutineers. In June 1857 he was at Delhi, and there met his old corps of guides, who received him with great enthusiasm. Hodson was one of the junior officers who unsuccessfully urged an early assault on the city. He killed an Indian officer, Bisharat Ali, allegedly because he owed Ali money. Delhi was captured on 20 September 1857, and on the following day Hodson obtained, with some difficulty, General Archdale Wilson's permission to capture the king of Delhi, Bahadur Shah. He went with only fifty of his own men to Humayun's tomb, where the king had taken refuge. The king surrendered and Hodson brought him to the commander-in-chief, in spite of the thousands following them, any one of whom could have shot Hodson. This seizure of the king was considered to be perhaps the most striking blow the rebellion had received.<br>
<br>Next day, 22 September, with a hundred picked men, Hodson again went to Humayun's tomb, where the three <i>shahzadahs</i>, princes of Delhi, had taken refuge. Hodson demanded their surrender; they came out and were sent away towards the city under a guard, travelling in <i>tufhs</i> (covered bullock carts). The tomb was crowded with thousands of the servants and hangers-on of the palace and city. Hodson demanded instant surrender of their arms. Despite the paucity of his force, they obeyed, and, after leaving the arms with a guard, he followed after the prisoners. A large mob had collected, and were threatening the guard. After appealing to the crowd, saying that these were the butchers who had murdered helpless women and children, Hodson took a carbine from one of his men and shot the princes. He afterwards wrote that he had destroyed &#145;the villains who ordered the massacre of our women and children, and stood by and witnessed the foul barbarity&#146;  (Hodson, 297). The critical situation in India, the belief that the princes had been involved in the massacre of Europeans at Delhi, and the need for immediate action for his and his soldiers' safety gained for Hodson's action the approval of most Europeans then in India, but he was criticized, then and long after.<br>
<br>After the fall of Delhi, Hodson's Horse went towards Cawnpore with a convoy of supplies for the commander-in-chief's army, and had much hard fighting. One of Hodson's most brilliant exploits was his ride from Mainpuri to the commander-in-chief's camp at Miran-ki-sarai to open communications between the two forces: he rode 94 miles on one horse in a day, through a country swarming with enemies.<br>
<br>On 6 March Hodson was before Lucknow. On 11 March he went as a volunteer with his friend Brigadier Napier, who was directing an attack on the begum's palace in the <i>kaisarbagh</i>. British soldiers were clearing the buildings of rebels. Though warned to await the arrival of gunpowder bags, impulsively Hodson alone entered a room in which were rebels, and was shot through the liver. He died next day, 12 March 1858, at Banks' House, and was buried at La Martini&egrave;re College, Lucknow, on the same day. Sir Colin Campbell and others praised his military brilliance and his bravery. Yet, apparently indicative of his reputation, it was soon said that he died while looting. This was untrue, though he may have intended looting. While looting&#151;by British, Sikhs, and Gurkhas, officers and other ranks&#151;was widespread, Hodson was allegedly &#145;the most notorious looter in the whole army&#146;  (Hibbert, 361). General Pelham Burn, Sir Henry Daly, and Sir Henry Norman all alleged his looting. That loot was not officially found among his possessions after his death and that his wife left under &pound;400 in 1884 were hardly conclusive evidence of his innocence. The case against him was apparently strong, if unproven. Long after his death the controversy over his moral character, including his alleged looting, continued, with accusers, notably R. Bosworth Smith in his <span class="italic">Life of Lord Lawrence</span> (1885 edn), and defenders, notably Hodson's brother, the Revd G. H. Hodson, in his <span class="italic">Hodson of Hodson's Horse</span> (1883 and later editions), presenting Hodson as an English Christian hero.<br>
<br>Hodson was described as &#145;A tallish man with yellow hair, a pale, smooth face, heavy moustache, and large, restless, rather unforgiving eyes&#146;  (Hibbert, 289). His favoured weapon was a hog-spear. Apparently more the barbarian warrior than the Arnoldian ideal of the Victorian gentleman, he was an exceptional soldier, horseman, swordsman, and leader of Indian irregular cavalry. Lord Roberts called him &#145;a brilliant soldier&#146;  (Roberts, 137). He was brave, hard, reckless, impatient, and impulsive, and he enjoyed battle. He despised most other officers, including many of his seniors. He was also ruthless, and may have been unscrupulous and dishonest.<br>
