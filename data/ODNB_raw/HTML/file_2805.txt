<span class="headword">Bolton, Sir  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1648), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was the son of John Bolton of Fenton, Staffordshire. Having attended the Inner Temple in London, he practised for a time as a barrister in England. It is possible that he married his first wife, Frances, daughter of Richard Walter of Stafford, with whom he had one son and several daughters, before he left for Ireland with the object, it has been alleged, of avoiding the results of a censure passed on him by the court of Star Chamber. At the close of 1604 he obtained employment as temporary recorder of Dublin. In the following year he was appointed recorder of that city&#151;&#145;during good behaviour&#146;&#151;at an annual salary of &pound;25. As counsel in the famous case of tanistry, Bolton defended the ancient Gaelic custom of partible inheritance, a key obstacle to the legal assimilation of Ulster into the English imperium in Ireland. He was dispatched in 1608 to London as law agent to the municipality of Dublin in connection with suits relating to its customs and privileges. Sir Arthur Chichester, lord deputy of Ireland, in a letter dated 15 October 1608, commended Bolton to the earl of Salisbury.<br>
<br>Bolton was admitted to the Society of King's Inns, Dublin, in 1610. Through government influence he was elected on 27 April 1613, in opposition to the Roman Catholic candidate, one of the representatives of the city of Dublin in the parliament of which Sir John Davies became the speaker. He resigned the recordership of Dublin in the same year. He received a knighthood on 4 July 1618 from Sir Oliver St John, lord deputy of Ireland. Under privy seal dated Westminster 31 December 1618, and patent of the 10th of the following February, Bolton was appointed solicitor-general for Ireland. In 1621 he published at Dublin, in a folio volume, a selection of statutes passed in parliaments held in Ireland, dedicated to his benefactor, Sir Oliver St John, who had encouraged him to undertake it.<br>
<br>Bolton became attorney-general to the court of wards at Dublin in 1622, and was appointed chief baron of the exchequer in Ireland by privy seals dated 13 April and 29 May, and patent dated 29 June 1625. To his printed volume of the statutes an addition containing those of the tenth and eleventh years of Charles I was published in 1635. Bolton published in 1638, at Dublin, a folio volume entitled <span class="italic">A Justice of the Peace for Ireland</span>, setting out the duties of JPs out of session and detailing the form of their proceedings during sessions. By this time he was closely associated with Richard Boyle, earl of Cork. However, he aligned himself with Wentworth and played a leading role in the lord deputy's commission for defective titles. By privy seal dated at Westminster 6 December 1639, and a patent given at Dublin on 15 January 1640, Bolton was appointed to the chancellorship of Ireland, in place of Sir Adam Loftus, with a moiety of the profits derivable from chancery writs, together with &pound;500 per annum, during his tenure of office. As chancellor he presided in the parliament which began at Dublin in March 1640. On 11 February 1641 the House of Lords acquitted him from a charge of having endeavoured to prevent the continuance of the existing parliament. With a letter dated 18 February Bolton transmitted to the committee of the house attending the king in England a schedule of grievances of Ireland voted by the lords at Dublin on the same day. He was regarded as a chief adviser of Strafford in his attempts to introduce arbitrary government. On 27 February 1641 a committee was appointed by the House of Commons in Ireland to draw up charges against the chancellor, Bolton, and against Bramhall, bishop of Derry, Sir Gerard Lowther, chief justice of the common pleas, and Sir George Radcliffe, to impeach them of high treason. The chancellor, as chairman of the house, had to receive the articles against himself. The wrath of his accusers was heightened when he suggested that Poynings' Law restricted the Irish parliament's powers of impeachment. On 1 March 1641 the house ordered that the lord chancellor should enter into recognizances to appear when the articles should be exhibited. After some further debate the peers left it to the lords justices to do as they saw fit, as there were no precedents. They further declared &#145;the sense of the house that the lord chancellor was not fit to execute that place, nor to sit at the council board, and that they desired a new speaker&#146;. Sir William Ryves, justice of the king's bench, appointed by letters patent speaker of the House of Lords in Ireland, during pleasure, in the absence of the chancellor, took office on 11 May 1641. In the following July the lords justices communicated to the House of Commons the king's desire that they should forbear proceeding further with the impeachment. The ensuing struggle to continue with the prosecution was of great constitutional significance, giving rise to the debates from whence transpired Darcy's &#145;Argument&#146; in assertion of Irish independence under English law.<br>
<br>Bolton, as member of the privy council at Dublin, signed the dispatch of 25 October 1641 announcing to the earl of Leicester, the lord lieutenant, then in England, the start of hostile movements in Ireland. He took part in the preparation of an elaborate statement, transmitted to the House of Lords in London in November 1641, in relation to the English administrative system in Ireland. By a resolution of 21 June 1642, that no members should sit or vote until they had taken the oath of supremacy, the House of Commons excluded the Roman Catholic representatives, among whom were those who had been most active in the proceedings against Bolton and his associates. On the same day Bolton and Lowther petitioned the house, and it was unanimously resolved to proceed no further upon the articles of accusation against them. On the following day Bolton was restored by the Lords to his place as chancellor, and on 2 August 1642 resumed his position in their house.<br>
<br>Bolton was actively engaged in negotiations connected with the cessation of hostilities between England and the Irish in 1643. In 1643&#150;4 he was a principal counsellor of the lord lieutenant, Ormond, in negotiating with the Irish confederation concerning peace. His name appears first among those of the privy council who signed the proclamation issued at Dublin on 30 July 1646 announcing the conclusion of a treaty of peace between Charles I and his Roman Catholic subjects in Ireland. In writings condemnatory of the terms of that peace Bolton was represented as more devoted to the parliament of England than to the king, and much opposed to concessions to the Roman Catholics of Ireland. A contemporary answer to some of the allegations against Bolton is extant in an unpublished manuscript in the British Library. Bolton signed the instructions on 26 September 1646 to those who were commissioned to treat with the English parliament for succours after the peace had been rejected by the Irish. He joined in the statement on the condition of Ireland of 19 February 1647 submitted by Ormond to Charles I, and preserved in the twentieth volume of the Carte papers in the Bodleian Library.<br>
<br>Bolton died in November 1648. His second wife, whom he married at an unknown date, was Margaret (<i>d</i>. in or after 1663), daughter of Sir Patrick Barnewall. In 1661 the peers at Dublin ordered that the books of their house for 1640 and 1641 should be expunged &#145;where they contained anything that did intrench upon the honor of the late Earl of Strafford, the late Bishop [Bramhall] of Derry, the lord chancellor Bolton, and several others&#146;. In the archives at Kilkenny Castle is a petition in which Lady Bolton, widow of Sir Richard Bolton, applied in 1663 to the duke of Ormond, then viceroy, for the arrears due to her late husband. Bolton's son Edward succeeded him as solicitor-general in Ireland in 1622, and as chief baron in 1640. On the death of Charles I, Edward Bolton was by Charles II reappointed chief baron. He was removed from that office by the parliamentarian government, which, however, employed him in 1651 as commissioner for the administration of justice in Ireland.<br>
