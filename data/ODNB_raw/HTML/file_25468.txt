<span class="headword">Shortland,  Willoughby</span>  (1804&#150;1869), <span class="occ">naval officer and colonial administrator</span>, born at Plymouth, Devon, on 30 September 1804, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25467/', "Captain Thomas George Shortland")</script>, of Courtlands, near Lympstone, Devon, and his wife, Elizabeth, the daughter of Peter Tonkin of Plymouth. His younger brothers were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25464/', "Edward Shortland")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25466/', "Peter Frederick Shortland")</script>. He was educated at the Royal Naval College, Portsmouth (1818&#150;20), having entered the service on 9 January 1818. He was gazetted a lieutenant on 18 August 1828 and served on the Jamaica station. On 21 March 1831 he took the command of the <i>Skipjack</i>, a schooner of five guns, and remained with her in the West Indies until he was invalided home in June 1833. In 1839 he accompanied Captain William Hobson, the first governor-designate of New Zealand, to that colony via New South Wales, where Hobson appointed him chief magistrate and superintendent of police for New Zealand.<br>
<br>In 1841 Shortland married Isabella Kate Johnston, the daughter of Robert A. Fitzgerald, of Geraldine, co. Limerick, Ireland, and in May 1841 he was appointed colonial secretary. He proceeded to Port Nicholson, Wellington, and in dissolving the settlers' council there he aroused resentment among the New Zealand Company settlers. After the death of Captain Hobson on 10 September 1842, Shortland administered the government of New Zealand until his dismissal by the newly arrived Captain Robert FitzRoy on 31 December 1843. During Shortland's temporary government he was widely slated for financial and tactical imprudence. Following the fatal encounter between Maori and settlers at Wairau on 17 June 1843, in his dispatches to the home government he expressed his disapproval of the conduct of the settlers, to which he attributed the massacre. This action made him unpopular, and, when a report of his nomination as governor of New Zealand was circulated, a petition was sent from Auckland praying that he might not be appointed.<br>
<br>Still in favour with the Colonial Office, however, Shortland was in 1845 appointed president of Nevis in the Leeward Islands, and from 10 January 1854 until 1856 served as governor of Tobago. In July 1864 he retired from the navy with the rank of commander. He returned to England and resided on his property, Courtlands, Charleton, Kingsbridge, Devon, until his death there on 7 October 1869.<br>
