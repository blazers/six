<span class="headword">Crofts,  Ernest</span>  (1847&#150;1911), <span class="occ">history painter</span>, was born in Leeds, Yorkshire, on 15 September 1847. He was the second son of John Crofts JP, a manufacturer, and his wife, Ellen Wordsworth. Crofts attended Rugby School and was also schooled in Berlin. Having decided to become a professional artist he remained in Germany, studying in D&uuml;sseldorf under Professor H&uuml;nten, who was himself a pupil of the history and military painter Horace Vernet. It was also in D&uuml;sseldorf that Crofts met his future wife, Elizabeth W&uuml;sthofen, whom he married in 1872. They had one daughter. After returning to London, Crofts studied under another painter of military scenes, Alfred Borron Clay. Given such tutelage, it is hardly surprising that by the time Ernest Crofts ended his studies he, too, had come to specialize in military and historical subjects. In this field he found financial success, if not universal artistic acclaim.<br>
<br>The paintings of Ernest Crofts can be grouped into three main subject areas, the first of which is English civil war scenes. These include <span class="italic">Cromwell at the Sign of the Blue Boar</span> (1883; Dudley Museum and Art Gallery), <span class="italic">The Funeral of Charles I</span> (Bristol Art Gallery), and <span class="italic">Cromwell after the Battle of Marston Moor</span> (Towneley Hall Art Gallery, Burnley). His second area of interest was the Napoleonic era; his paintings in this category include <span class="italic">On the Evening of the Battle of Waterloo</span> (Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool). His third theme comprised military, political, and civic scenes, both historical and contemporary, such as <span class="italic">King Edward VII Distributing South African War Medals</span> and <span class="italic">The Funeral of Queen Victoria</span> (1903), and Crofts's largest work, <span class="italic">Queen Elizabeth Opening the First Royal Exchange</span> (Royal Exchange, London).<br>
<br>Crofts was a fine draughtsman, and his paintings reveal his keen interest in the most minute accuracy of costume detail. Yet his work was neither dry nor academic. Indeed his particular talent lay in the way that he imbued his imagined historical scenes with dramatic intensity: they are feasts of action-packed theatre, and proved tremendously popular. The numerous internet sites that sell reproductions of his paintings testify to his continued popularity among military enthusiasts.<br>
<br>Crofts exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy from 1874, his first painting accepted there being <span class="italic">A Retreat: Episode in the Franco-German War</span>. He followed this with numerous submissions on his favoured themes, such as <span class="italic">Napoleon and the Old Guard at Waterloo</span>, exhibited in 1895. Crofts was elected an associate member of the Royal Academy in 1878 and a full academician in 1896. His diploma work was entitled <span class="italic">To the Rescue</span>. Succeeding Phillip Hermogenes Calderon, who died in 1898, Crofts was appointed keeper and trustee of the Royal Academy; he is included in Sir Hubert von Herkomer's large portrait group of the Royal Academy council of 1908 (Tate collection). Crofts was also elected a fellow of the Society of British Artists on 1 March 1900. In later life such administrative duties took up much of his time and his paintings perhaps suffered as a result. They lacked the colour and vitality of his earlier work.<br>
<br>Crofts died in London, on 19 March 1911, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery; his wife survived him. Exactly nine months later Christies salesrooms in London held a sale of the contents of his studio.<br>
