<div class="para">
<span class="headword">O'Connor,  Thomas Power</span>  (1848&#150;1929), <span class="occ">journalist and politician</span>, was born at Athlone on 5 October 1848, the eldest son of Thomas O'Connor, a shopkeeper, and his wife, Theresa Power. He was educated at the College of the Immaculate Conception, Athlone, and in 1863 he entered Queen's College, Galway, where he took his BA degree in 1866 (he was awarded an MA by the college in 1873). After an attempt to enter the civil service, in 1867 he began as a reporter on the staff of <span class="italic">Saunders's Newsletter</span>, a Conservative Dublin daily paper. In 1870 he went to London, and at the outbreak of the Franco&#150;Prussian War his command of French and German led to his appointment as a sub-editor on the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>. Here he remained only briefly, moving on to the London office of the <span class="italic">New York Herald</span>, only to be dismissed after eighteen months. He became a freelance journalist, working in the press gallery of the House of Commons. The hardships of these years were said to have made him an extreme radical, and he took part in debates in working men's clubs, becoming vice-president of the Lambeth Radical Association in 1880.<br>
<br>During 1876 O'Connor's first book, a life of Disraeli, appeared anonymously in serial numbers. It was so unsparing an attack on the prime minister that it attracted considerable notice; when it was published under his name in 1879, its success provided a spur to his entry into politics. Initially O'Connor wanted to stand as a British radical but he was persuaded by Parnell to stand as a home-rule candidate for the borough of Galway, which he won in 1880. He became one of the most voluble and pertinacious speakers among the Parnellites who opposed the Liberal government. In 1885 he stood for the Scotland division of Liverpool, and wrote an address from the Irish party to the nationalist voters in Great Britain, urging them to defeat the Liberals by supporting the Conservative candidates; at the general election of 1886, when Gladstone had adopted home rule, he wrote another address to the same electors, exhorting them in even more moving terms to vote Liberal.<br>
<br>Throughout his long life O'Connor combined journalism with politics and was better known, perhaps, as a journalist than as a politician. John Morley, editor of the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> from 1880, engaged him to write a nightly sketch of the proceedings in parliament, and thought him unrivalled in depicting the personalities of the party fight of that day, and its dramatic episodes. In 1888 O'Connor founded the <span class="italic">Star</span>, an evening journal noted both for its radicalism and for its inauguration of the &#145;new&#146; journalism. Differences arose between him and the proprietor, and O'Connor was bought out reportedly for &pound;15,000, subject to the condition that he should not start another evening paper in London for three years. In 1891 he brought out the <span class="italic">Sunday Sun</span>, subsequently called the <span class="italic">Weekly Sun</span>. In 1893, when he was able to start another evening paper, he founded the <span class="italic">Sun</span>, but it was less successful. His next venture, in 1902, <span class="italic">T. P.'s Weekly</span> (he was known familiarly as T. P.), a penny literary paper, was extremely popular. He started other weekly papers, such as <span class="italic">M.A.P.</span> (<span class="roman">Mainly about People</span>) and <span class="italic">P.T.O.</span> (<span class="roman">Please Turn Over</span>), both devoted chiefly to gossip, and experimented with a monthly called <span class="italic">T.P.'s Magazine</span>. Of his books the more important are <span class="italic">The Parnell Movement</span> (1886) and <span class="italic">Memoirs of an Old Parliamentarian</span> (1929).<br>
<br>As a journalist O'Connor was not a publicist, writing few leading articles of weight and influence on public affairs. He was content rather to be an observer of life and its chronicler in an easy style, full of reminiscences and anecdotes. Nor as a parliamentarian did he ever aspire to leadership. As the voice of the Irish in Britain, his role was as mediator and ambassador for the cause of Irish nationalism. President of the Irish National League of Great Britain from 1883 to 1918, he played an important role in making links between Ireland and the Irish in Britain. He promoted Irish home rule policies in France, and raised funds for the Irish Parliamentary Party in America.<br>
<br>In 1917 O'Connor became the first president of the British Board of Film Censors, nominated by the film trade, but independent of trade control or influence. O'Connor's signature on the censors' certificate that preceded the presentation of every film thus became familiar to millions. He was successful in ensuring that disputes between the Home Office, local authorities, and the board were eased, and the board's decisions were accepted as final. He was made a member of the privy council in 1924 by the first Labour government. He was also for many years &#145;father&#146; of the House of Commons by right of the longest unbroken period of service. O'Connor loved the Commons for its history, its customs, and its sociabilities, and wrote innumerable articles about its more prominent members, their fortunes and fates.<br>
<br>O'Connor married, in 1885, Elizabeth Howard, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Paschal, the daughter of a judge of the supreme court in Arkansas, USA; they had no children, and she died in 1931 (her son from her first marriage, Francis Howard, was the father of Brian Howard, the dilettante). O'Connor died on 18 November 1929, and was buried in the Roman Catholic cemetery, Kensal Green.<br>
