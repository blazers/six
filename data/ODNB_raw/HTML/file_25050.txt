<span class="headword">Selby,  Prideaux John</span>  (1788&#150;1867), <span class="occ">naturalist</span>, was born in Bondgate Street, Alnwick, Northumberland, on 23 July 1788, the eldest son of George Selby (<i>d</i>. 1804) of Beal and Twizell House, Northumberland, and Margaret, the second daughter of John Cook, a captain in the mercantile marine. The Selby family settled at Beal in 1588 and took a prominent part in the life of Northumberland and the borders.<br>
<br>Selby showed a great interest in ornithology from an early age and made his own notes and careful, coloured drawings of the birds in his district. He attended Durham grammar school, and was prepared, by private tuition, for University College, Oxford. He matriculated on 3 May 1806, but left after a few terms. He went to live at Twizell House, near Belford, Northumberland, in 1809. The following year, on 17 December, at Morpeth, he married Lewis Tabitha (1782&#150;1859), the third daughter of Bertram and Tabitha Mitford of Mitford Manor; they had three daughters.<br>
<br>Selby took an active part in the social and political life of Northumberland. He served as a magistrate, as deputy lieutenant in 1817, and in 1823 as high sheriff for his county. He unsuccessfully contested Berwick at the general election, as a reformer, in 1812. However, his main interests were ornithology, forestry, and entomology. He was a skilful fisherman and an excellent shot. Selby's major work, <span class="italic">Illustrations of British Ornithology</span>, was published in nineteen parts between 1821 and 1833. It contained some 222 plates etched by Selby (mostly after his own drawings) with the assistance of his brother-in-law Admiral Robert Mitford. In 1819 Mitford was taught to etch by Thomas Bewick in Newcastle; he then taught Selby at Twizell House. Two volumes of text appeared, <span class="italic">Land Birds</span> in 1825 (revised in 1833) and <span class="italic">Water Birds</span> in 1833. The specimens on which the figures were based were nearly all collected and set up by Selby, aided by his butler, Richard Moffitt.<br>
<br>From 1825 until 1841 Selby assisted his friend Sir William Jardine (1800&#150;1874) with the descriptions, drawings, and etchings for their joint publication, <span class="italic">Illustrations of Ornithology</span> (1836&#150;43). During this period, in 1835 and 1836 respectively, he also wrote the volumes <span class="italic">Pigeons</span> and <span class="italic">Parrots</span> for Jardine's <span class="roman">Naturalist's Library</span>. Together, in conjunction with George Johnston, Selby and Jardine founded the <span class="italic">Magazine of Zoology and Botany</span> in 1836, which was widened in scope in 1838 when the name was changed to <span class="italic">Annals of Natural History</span>. Selby remained an editor until his death, contributing notes and articles up to 1841. He joined the Berwickshire Naturalists' Club soon after it was founded in 1831 and served as its president in 1834 and again in 1844. Between 1832 and 1859 he contributed many papers to the <span class="italic">History of the Berwickshire Naturalists' Club</span>. Further papers were published in other journals between 1823 and 1838.<br>
<br>In 1833 Selby joined a numerous party of students, led by Robert Graham and Robert Kaye Greville, on a tour through Sutherland. The following year he encouraged Jardine and his brother John, Greville, and James Wilson of Edinburgh to go to Sutherland in order to make a more extensive study of the fauna and flora of this largely unknown region. Selby kept detailed records of the fishes, insects, birds, and mammals seen on the tour, and painted some of the fishes in oils.<br>
<br>Selby also made contributions to entomology from the mid-1830s. He promoted the use of trees and straw bee skeps brushed over with sugar solutions in order to attract insects for collection. Selby collected lepidoptera, coleoptera, and hymenoptera&#151;the last group then little studied.<br>
<br>Selby exhibited several paintings at the Royal Scottish Academy, of which he was elected an honorary member in 1827. He became a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1826 and intermittently attended meetings of the British Association for the Advancement of Science from 1833 onwards. In 1839 the University of Durham conferred on him the honorary degree of master of arts.<br>
<br>Selby's knowledge of botany and particularly of arboriculture was extensive. His practical experience in planting up hundreds of acres of ground at Twizell House with many varieties of trees, often recently imported, resulted in his being asked by Van Voorst to write a treatise on the subject, published as <span class="italic">A History of British Forest Trees Indigenous and Introduced</span> (1841&#150;2).<br>
<br>Selby died at Twizell House on 27 March 1867, and was buried in Bamburgh churchyard. His family regularly attended St Aidan's Church, where there is a memorial window to Selby and his wife, donated by Frances Margaret Antrobus. Selby's collection of coleoptera, hymenoptera, aculeata, and lepidoptera was presented to the University of Cambridge. His collections of 1400 foreign bird skins, including several type specimens, and eggs, were also presented to the university. His collection of British birds was purchased by A. H. Browne of Callaly Castle, but has not survived.<br>
