<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thackray,  John Philip <span class="st"> [Jake]</span></span>  (1938&#150;2002), <span class="occ">singer and songwriter</span>, was born on 27 February 1938 at the maternity hospital, Leeds, Yorkshire, the son of Ernest Thackray, police constable, and his wife, Ivy May, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Armitage, both of 2 Park View Terrace, Rawdon, Leeds. Educated at a Jesuit school, St Michael's College, Dolgellau, where he contemplated joining the priesthood, he then attended Durham University where he studied modern languages and trained as a teacher. He taught in France for four years, and it was there that he absorbed the chanson genre of popular music, and in particular the songs of Georges Brassens, which provided the paradigm for his own future work. Much later he persuaded Brassens to perform a concert at the university theatre in Cardiff. &#145;I did the first half,&#146; he said, &#145;and it was the pinnacle of everything I ever achieved to be on the stage with him that night&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>).<br>
<br>Returning to teach in Leeds, Thackray began writing songs both for the classroom and for performance in local folk clubs. An appearance on an early morning farming programme on local radio led to regular features on the BBC's <span class="italic">Northcountryman</span> radio programme, and his first television appearance in 1966, in <span class="italic">The Good Old Days</span>, broadcast from the City Palace of Varieties in Leeds. In 1967 he signed to EMI's Columbia record label and recorded his first album, <span class="italic">The Last Will and Testament of Jake Thackray</span>. On 3 August 1968 he married Sheila Marian Clarke-Irons, a 21-year-old student, and daughter of Peter William Clarke-Irons, manager of a petrol station. They had three sons, Bill, Sam, and Tom.<br>
<br>By the late 1960s Thackray was appearing regularly on national television, with residencies on BBC late night satirical programmes <span class="italic">The Braden Beat</span>, <span class="italic">The David Frost Show</span>, and <span class="italic">That's Life</span>. These shows required a topical song a week. &#145;It wasn't pressure, it was work,&#146; Thackray said later, &#145;and it taught me how to write quickly to a deadline. Some of the songs were duff&#151;absolutely bloody duff&#151;and I blush to think about having sung them&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>). None the less, he made over 1000 television appearances; he also continued to combine his teaching and songwriting careers until the early 1970s.<br>
<br>In 1969 Thackray released his second album, <span class="italic">Jake's Progress</span>, which again received widespread critical acclaim, and steady if unspectacular sales. He appeared at the London Palladium, and in 1971 in a concert at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, recorded and released as <span class="italic">Live Performance!</span> But he was becoming disenchanted with the entertainment industry, and uncertain of the validity of his work. Backstage at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, he had to be persuaded to appear by Norman Newell, who had signed him to EMI. He toured extensively abroad, and continued to work in clubs and theatres throughout the 1970s, producing <span class="italic">On Again! On Again!</span> in 1977, <span class="italic">Jake Thackray and Songs</span> in 1981, a live recording of a BBC2 concert, and a book of his lyrics. However, increasingly he felt that &#145;People come to see me because I'm on the telly. They would go and see Michael Fish the weatherman if he went on tour&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>). His disillusionment was exacerbated by changes in the entertainment industry and society in general; his literate wit was at odds with both punk and the Thatcher years, which also affected the image of Yorkshire that had provided the sense of identity in much of his work. Folk music audiences lost interest in contemporary song, and to many his bawdy humour appeared rooted in a sexist misogyny.<br>
<br>In the 1980s Thackray retired with his family to Monmouth in south Wales. &#145;I'd never liked the stage much,&#146; he later said, &#145;and I was turning into a performing man, a real bloody Archie Rice, so I cancelled gigs and pulled out&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). The family established a closely guarded privacy that henceforth characterized Thackray's relationship with the rest of the world. He wrote a humorous column for the <span class="italic">Yorkshire Post</span>, but generally acquired the reputation of a recluse, with stories circulating of ill-health, excessive use of alcohol, and a complete loss of faith in his work. He separated from his wife, and in 2000 was declared bankrupt.<br>
<br>Although popularized through television, and covered by a variety of other artists from the Barron Knights performing the comic &#145;Sister Josephine&#146; to Petula Clark duetting &#145;La-di-dah&#146; with the poet Rod McKuen, Thackray's songs showed a thoroughgoing disregard for current popular music conventions of chart success. At the time of his death his work was beginning to be appreciated again for its particular attributes and manifold achievements. As a performer he presented a distinct persona, with his lugubrious expression, sardonic delivery, and nylon-strung guitar. As a writer he represented the continuation of the genre of English popular, urban song into the television age, combining elements of both the music hall and folk traditions. His writing was remarkable for its sheer wit and verbal agility, and the juxtaposition of an absurd imagination with a delight in the detail of everyday life, expressed in a musical language that translated the resources of the French chanson into English. Describing his work, he said:<blockquote>I can see that I am in the English tradition if you like, with songwriters like Flanders and Swann and Noel Coward, who are wordy, funny writers. The main difference is in my tunes, which are based on French music. I've been called &#145;The Yorkshire Noel Coward&#146;, but that only reflects the poverty of journalists. They do it because my songs have lots of words in them and I have a clipped, abrupt delivery. (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>)</blockquote>Thackray died of heart failure at his home, 75 Carbonne Close, Monmouth, on 24 December 2002. He was survived by his wife, Sheila, and their three sons.<br>
