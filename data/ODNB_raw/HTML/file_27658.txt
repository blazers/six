<span class="headword">Traheron,  Bartholomew</span>  (<em>c.</em>1510&#150;1558?), <span class="occ">protestant writer and reformer</span>, is of uncertain origins, although he is thought to have been of Cornish stock. The chronology of his university career suggests that he was born about 1510. He was possibly the son of George Traheron, a Herefordshire JP in 1523 who died soon after that year. Bartholomew was then brought up by Richard Tracy of Gloucestershire (son of the famous protestant William Tracy, whose will was commented upon by both William Tyndale and John Frith) under whose tutelage he almost certainly came into contact with evangelical ideas in his early life. He studied at Oxford, possibly at Exeter College or Hart Hall, and was persecuted there by John London, warden of New College. After Oxford he moved to Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1533. It was at some point after this that he travelled abroad, especially in Italy and Germany, and kept company with John Butler, Nicholas Eliot, and Nicholas Partridge. He met Heinrich Bullinger at Z&uuml;rich in September 1537, and from there went to Strasbourg in 1538, where he published a treatise exhorting his brother Thomas to convert to the reformed faith.<br>
<br>By March 1539 at the latest, Traheron had entered the service of Thomas Cromwell, but he withdrew from political life after the latter's fall in 1540. Some time about 1542 he married the daughter of a man who &#145;followed godly doctrine&#146;; she was so poor that her husband was rumoured to have been forced to take up school teaching  (Robinson, <span class="italic">Original Letters</span>, 626). In 1543 he published a translation of an Italian book on surgery, entitled <span class="italic">The most excelent worckes of chirurgery made and set forth by maister John Vigon, head chirurgien of our tyme in Italy, translated into Englishe by Barth. Traheron, whereunto is added an exposition of straunge termes and unknowen symples, belongynge unto the arte</span>  (<span class="italic">ESTC</span>, no. 24720). Shortly before fleeing once again to the continent in 1546, he was granted three rectories in St Asaph diocese on the recommendation of Lord Chancellor Wriothesley. While he was abroad Traheron stayed in Geneva, where he met Calvin and developed the distinctive views on predestination which were shortly to win him some notoriety. With the accession of Edward VI in 1547 he was summoned back to England and from 22 April 1547 to 1 December 1549 was writer to the great seal and examiner of letters patent. He was elected MP for Barnstaple in 1547, and during the first session of the new parliament campaigned vigorously for the reform of doctrine. In the second session, which began in November 1548, he made a name for himself as one who argued for an unambiguously sacramentarian policy in the reformation of the eucharist. From 14 December 1549 to 22 October 1553 he was keeper of the king's library with a salary of 20 marks, while in February 1550 he was appointed a tutor to the young Henry Brandon, second duke of Suffolk.<br>
<br>At about this time Traheron engaged in a vigorous dispute with John Hooper over the nature of predestination, where his Genevan background set him in opposition to Hooper's eclectic approach which drew on the work of Bullinger and Melanchthon. Their struggle was a conflict between former exiles and reflected differences which existed between various continental protestants. Traheron argued strongly for a double-predestinarian approach, while Hooper tended more towards the synergistic position of Melanchthon, even borrowing significant passages from Melanchthon's writings in order to strengthen his arguments. Traheron is almost certainly one of the unnamed Calvinists whom Hooper excoriates in the preface to the second edition of his <span class="italic">A Declaration of the Ten Holy Commandments</span>. The debate provoked John ab Ulmis to write to Bullinger on 30 April 1550, marvelling at how far the two men disagreed over predestination. Later that same year, on 31 December, ab Ulmis again wrote to Bullinger about the rough treatment which Traheron thought he was receiving at Hooper's hands.<br>
<br>After Suffolk died on 14 July 1551 Traheron moved once more to the country for a life of quiet scholarship. He contributed to the volume of epigrams published on the death of Bucer in 1551. In September of that year, however, William Cecil proposed that he be made dean of Chichester, and he was nominated to this position on 29 September, though it was not until 8 January 1552 that he was finally elected. In the meantime, on 11 November 1551, he was nominated to the committee for the reform of church law. The chapter at Chichester apparently resented the intrusion of a layman and was consistently obstructive during his tenure. As a result he resigned about the end of 1552 to take up a canonry at Windsor which had been arranged for him in September by the council. He proved himself to be something of a nuisance in this position as well, and this, together with a tendency towards outspokenness which made him few friends in high places, helped ensure that he was not elected to the second parliament of the reign, which began on 1 March 1553. At this point, moreover, he seems once again to have become embroiled in a debate over predestination, writing to Bullinger to canvas Z&uuml;rich opinion on the issue in order to provide himself with ammunition against a Melanchthonian party (possibly Hooper once again) which was gaining influence. Bullinger's reply was far too equivocal on key issues for Traheron, who made his position clear in a further letter indicating the Calvinistic bent of his thinking:<blockquote>I cannot altogether think as you do. For you so state that God permits certain things, that you seem to take away from him the power of acting. We say that God permits many things, when he does not renew men by his Spirit, but gives them up to the dominion of their own lusts. And though God does not himself create in us evil desires, which are born with us; we maintain nevertheless that he determines the place, time, and mode, so that nothing can happen otherwise than as he has before determined it should happen. (Robinson, <span class="italic">Original Letters</span>, 326)</blockquote>On Mary's accession, Traheron, like many other protestants, resigned his appointments and went into exile on the continent. He was a firm supporter of Richard Cox during the latter's brief conflict with John Knox and William Whittingham over the use of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> in the English church at Frankfurt am Main. Here he was one of the signatories to the famous letter which Cox wrote to Calvin on 20 September 1555 which justified the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> and the treatment of Knox, claiming in classic <i>post hoc</i>&#150;<i>propter hoc</i> style that the Scotsman's <span class="italic">Admonition to England</span> was so vitriolic as to require his removal:<blockquote>We can assure you, that that insane pamphlet of Knox's added much oil to the flame of persecution in England. For before the pamphlet was published, not one of our brethren had suffered death; and we are sure that you know how many excellent men perished in the flames as soon as it came out. (Robinson, <span class="italic">Original Letters</span>, 762)</blockquote>After Knox's expulsion Traheron appears to have briefly held a theological lectureship in the congregation at Frankfurt before leaving for Wesel, where he published expositions of part of <span class="roman">John's gospel</span> and of the book of <span class="roman">Revelation</span>, as well as engaging in a small amount of anti-Catholic polemicizing. His treatise <span class="italic">A Warning to England to Repente, by the Terrible Exemple of Calice, Given the 7 of March 1558</span>, indicates that he was still alive at that date, but he is not recorded thereafter, and probably died at Wesel during that year. He certainly never returned to England.<br>
