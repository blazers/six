<span class="headword">Stanbridge,  John</span>  (1463&#150;1510), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and grammarian</span>, was born in the summer of 1463, and admitted as a scholar of Winchester College in 1475 from Adderbury, Oxfordshire. Later references suggest that his home address changed first to Bodicote near Adderbury, and then to Heyford, Northamptonshire. He became a scholar of New College, Oxford, in 1480, and a fellow two years later, graduating BA in 1484&#150;5 and MA after about a further three years. At Easter 1486 he left New College to become usher, or assistant master, of the new grammar school at Magdalen College, Oxford, founded by William Waynflete in 1481. The headmaster of this school, John Anwykyll, is the first English schoolmaster known to have taught humanist Latin and to have published a textbook of it. Anwykyll died about Christmas 1487, and Stanbridge was promoted to his place at the following Easter, with an annual salary of &pound;12 12<i>s</i>. In the spring of 1491 he was ordained priest, and left the school at some point between the following Christmas and Michaelmas 1493.<br>
<br>Little is known of Stanbridge's career during the next eight years. From October 1493 until February 1494 he was vicar of Bledington, Gloucestershire, which suggests a connection with Winchcombe Abbey, the patrons of the living. It is possible that he spent the rest of the 1490s at Lichfield, where the bishop, William Smith, had just refounded the cathedral grammar school in the hospital of St John. The grammarian Robert Whittington, who claimed to be Stanbridge's pupil, was a Lichfield man. Stanbridge certainly enjoyed the patronage of Smith from 1501 onwards. In that year Smith, now bishop of Lincoln, appointed him as master of the hospital of St John at Banbury, Oxfordshire, evidently to open a free grammar school there. The innovation was successful, and the school became well known for its teaching in the early sixteenth century. Smith also made Stanbridge rector of Winwick, Northamptonshire, in 1508, and canon of Lincoln Cathedral, with the prebend of St Botolph, in 1509. This provided Stanbridge with an income of some &pound;25 a year, a respectable sum in comparison with the &pound;10 salaries of most schoolmasters, until his death in the summer of 1510. Two of his printed books, Cicero's <span class="italic">Epistolae familiares</span> and Plutarch's <span class="italic">Lives</span>, survive at Magdalen College.<br>
<br>Stanbridge became well known as the author and editor of a series of school textbooks which appeared in print during his time at Banbury. They include, in the order of the earliest surviving editions, an <span class="italic">Accidence</span> (<i>c</i>.1505), <span class="italic">Parvulorum institutio</span> (<i>c</i>.1507), <span class="italic">Gradus comparationum</span> together with <span class="italic">Sum es fui</span> (<i>c</i>.1509), <span class="italic">Vulgaria</span> (<i>c</i>.1509), and <span class="italic">Vocabula</span> (1510). The <span class="italic">Accidence</span>, <span class="italic">Vocabula</span>, and <span class="italic">Vulgaria</span> are all attributed directly to Stanbridge in the earliest surviving editions, while the other two works are described as &#145;from the Stanbridgian collection&#146; or &#145;edition&#146;. In fact, none of Stanbridge's works was wholly original in form. The <span class="italic">Accidence</span>, <span class="italic">Gradus comparationum</span>, <span class="italic">Parvulorum institutio</span>, and <span class="italic">Sum es fui</span> were all based on existing English tracts on Latin grammar and syntax, which went back to the time of John Leylond in the early fifteenth century. Stanbridge's contribution was to revise the treatment of Latin according to humanist standards. The <span class="italic">Vocabula</span> and <span class="italic">Vulgaria</span> also follow traditional lines, although the material of the latter was largely Stanbridge's own. The works were a success, for several reasons. They were short, and could be built up into sets that covered basic grammar and syntax. They combined familiar formats with up-to-date humanist principles, and appeared when English printers were better able to market books effectively throughout England. They were all frequently published up to the 1530s, until they and other school books were superseded by the issue of an authorized royal grammar in 1540. The <span class="italic">Vocabula</span> and <span class="italic">Vulgaria</span> even enjoyed a further period of popularity in Scotland during the mid-seventeenth century.<br>
<br>Stanbridge had a namesake Thomas Stanbridge, who also pursued a career as a schoolmaster. He graduated BA from Oxford in 1510 and MA in 1518, and taught first at Banbury School, probably as usher, in 1511, and later at Magdalen College School, Oxford, where he was appointed headmaster at Michaelmas 1517, apparently holding the post until his death in 1523 or 1524. Thomas is sometimes presumed to be John's brother, but his career implies that he was born about 1490 and suggests that he is more likely to have been a nephew.<br>
