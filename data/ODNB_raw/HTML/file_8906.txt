<span class="headword">&AElig;thelthryth</span> <span class="st"> [St &AElig;thelthryth, Etheldreda, Audrey]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 679), <span class="occ">queen in Northumbria, consort of King Ecgfrith, and abbess of Ely</span>, was the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39123/', "Anna, king of the East Angles (d. 654?)")</script>. Her immediate kindred was dominated by women in religion, later venerated as saints, including three sisters, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25150/', "Seaxburh")</script>, &AElig;thelburh, and Wihtburh, a half-sister, S&aelig;thryth, and two nieces, Eormenhild and Eorcongota. Two of these were abbesses and one was a nun at the important Frankish monastery of Faremoutiers-en-Brie, a connection that was to prove significant for &AElig;thelthryth's own reputation as a saint.<h2>
<a name="VirginQueen"></a>Virgin Queen</h2>According to a local twelfth-century source, the <span class="italic">Liber Eliensis</span>, &AElig;thelthryth was born in Exning, in west Suffolk. In 652, probably while still very young, she married Tondberht, ealdorman or prince of the Middle Anglian province of the South Gyrwe. The <span class="italic">Liber Eliensis</span>, following a lost text, alleged that Tondberht thereupon gave her the Isle of Ely as dower (<i>dos</i>), a statement which conflicts with the evidence of &AElig;thelthryth's near contemporary, Bede, who believed that the great estate (<i>regio</i>) of Ely, assessed at 600 hides, had come to her from the East Angles. There are some indications that Bede was right. If, as an early source suggests, the whole of Tondberht's own territory of the South Gyrwe was assessed at only 600 hides, he can scarcely have offered land of exactly that value as dower. &AElig;thelthryth's probable birth on a royal estate nearby and the continuing association of Ely itself with Anna's kin also suggest that the area was East Anglian royal land. Whether, however, that land was bestowed upon &AElig;thelthryth at her first marriage, or granted to her later after the collapse of her second must remain uncertain.<br>
<br>Tondberht died after three years of wedlock, his wife, it seems, still a virgin. &AElig;thelthryth continued a widow for a further five years before marrying <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37384/', "Ecgfrith (645/6&#150;685)")</script>, son of King Oswiu of Northumbria, in 660. It is unclear how far she herself had any say in this second union. If, however, she was as devoted to her virgin status as contemporaries came to believe, she is unlikely actively to have sought it out. More probably, recent upheavals in local Middle Anglian politics provided the immediate stimulus. Oswiu's expulsion from Mercia in 658, after three years of direct rule, seems to have left the kingdom's eastern border, including the province of the South Gyrwe, increasingly under the influence of &AElig;thelthryth's paternal uncle, the East Anglian king. He may well have had diplomatic reasons for putting pressure upon his niece to contract the union with Ecgfrith. The East Anglian royal house already had strong dynastic links with that of Northumbria, through the marriage of another of &AElig;thelthryth's paternal uncles with the Deiran princess Hereswith. Hereswith, the mother of Aldwulf, soon (<i>c</i>.664) to succeed his uncle as king of the East Angles, was the cousin of Oswiu's queen, Eanfl&aelig;d, and sister of Hild, by the late 650s abbess of Whitby and an influential figure in Northumbria.<br>
<br>&AElig;thelthryth's relationship with her new husband, who in 660 was about fifteen&#151;somewhat younger than she&#151;was not very successful. By 670, when Ecgfrith succeeded his father as king of Northumbria, he and his wife had fallen under the influence of the kingdom's forceful and ambitious bishop, Wilfrid, whom Ecgfrith may well have known since the late 650s. Wilfrid, who obtained his see in controversial circumstances in 668, was then at the height of his career. As he himself told Bede, despite all Ecgfrith's blandishments, he used his influence with the queen at that time to strengthen her resolve to remain a virgin. Thereafter events developed rapidly. About 672, after twelve years as Ecgfrith's wife, &AElig;thelthryth was consecrated a nun by Wilfrid and entered the ill-fated monastery of Coldingham, where her husband's aunt &AElig;bbe was abbess. A year later she left Northumbria to found a monastery on her great estate at Ely. By 678, Ecgfrith had divorced her and Iurminburg had replaced her as his consort. Before that date, while already a nun and still queen, she had taken the momentous step of giving to Wilfrid the large estate on which he founded his great new monastery of Hexham.<br>
<br>Little is known of &AElig;thelthryth's household while she was in Northumbria. In her early years, it was presided over by the East Anglian Owine, who came north with her in 660, but later became a monk at Ceadda's monastery of Lastingham and by 672 was a member of the bishop's community at Lichfield. Of her other dependants, only the Northumbrian thegn Imma is known; he had entered the service of Ecgfrith's brother &AElig;lfwine before 679, but seems to have retained links with &AElig;thelthryth's kindred. Captured and enslaved in London after &AElig;lfwine's death at the battle of Trent in 679, he successfully appealed to the queen's nephew, King Hlothere of Kent, to ransom him.<h2>
<a name="Abbessandsaint"></a>Abbess and saint</h2>&AElig;thelthryth ruled her new foundation at Ely for some seven years before dying of plague on 23 June 679. Bede described her way of life there in terms intended to indicate that she strictly espoused monastic values, as promoted by Pope Gregory the Great. &AElig;thelthryth, he claimed, wore only woollen garments, seldom bathed except before the greater feasts, ate generally once a day, and was assiduous in the office and in prayer. Her monastic humility was apparent in the simple arrangements she decreed for her burial: she was to be interred in a wooden coffin amid her departed nuns. Some alleged that she showed powers of prophecy before her death.<br>
<br>&AElig;thelthryth was clearly a remarkable woman, with sufficient force of character to preserve her virginity through two marriages, to abandon the second of these despite her royal husband's opposition, and to set up, apparently on her own initiative, a successful dynastic community, which she handed on to her sister Seaxburh. The crucial factor in the establishment of her reputation, however, was a major posthumous miracle: at the translation organized by Abbess Seaxburh to seal her sister's status as a saint sixteen years after her death, in 695, her body was found incorrupt. At this carefully orchestrated ceremony, attended by Bishop Wilfrid, a tent was erected over the grave in the outdoor cemetery of the nuns, and &AElig;thelthryth's body, still fresh and undecayed, was lifted from its resting place, washed, and clothed in new robes. It was then brought within the abbatial church and placed in a marble sarcophagus, almost certainly situated next to the principal altar, the position it still occupied in the late tenth century. The occasion was marked by further wonders and was clearly shaped by similar translations of &AElig;thelthryth's and Seaxburh's relatives at Faremoutiers-en-Brie, which had also been marked by the great sign of incorruption.<br>
<br>Incorruption had featured in one of Ambrose's translations in late fourth-century Milan and in several such ceremonies in sixth-century Gaul. In England, while Oswald's arm preserved at Bamburgh was already held to be imperishable, &AElig;thelthryth's was the first instance of an entire body (her example was to be followed shortly by that of Cuthbert in 698). The impact of the miracle on the clerical &eacute;lite was immense. Both Bede and Wilfrid's biographer Stephen of Ripon expressly mention it as incontrovertible evidence that &AElig;thelthryth had died a virgin. The impression made upon Bede in particular is evidenced by his poem in praise of &AElig;thelthryth's virginity, published in the <span class="italic">Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum</span>; by her commemoration, together with Cuthbert, in the world chronicle which he attached to his great treatise on time published in 725; and by the fact that, uniquely among English saints, she received a full historical notice in his martyrology.<h2>
<a name="Thepreconquestcult"></a>The pre-conquest cult</h2>&AElig;thelthryth's cult was fostered in eighth-century Ely, where in addition to the imperishable body, the original grave clothes and coffin also worked wonders. The monastery seems to have been drawn firmly into the orbit of Mercia by the end of the seventh century, when Seaxburh's daughter, Eormenhild, who had married the Mercian king Wulfhere, in widowhood succeeded her mother at Ely. It was probably during this period that &AElig;thelthryth's cult was first promoted in the ancient province of Lindsey, where the <span class="italic">Liber Eliensis</span> associates it with the foundation of two churches and where indeed there are two churches with early dedications to the saint. Possibly Eormenhild's daughter, Werburh (<i>d</i>. 709), who in later tradition is said to have been given charge of Mercian monasteries by her uncle King &AElig;thelred and who is strongly associated with both Ely and with monastic foundations in Lindsey, may have fostered the cult in the area.<br>
<br>&AElig;thelthryth features in Alcuin's late eighth-century poem on York and in the ninth-century Old English martyrology, although neither account adds anything to that of Bede. At Ely, her community apparently enjoyed some form of continuous existence for about two centuries after its foundation. According to a narrative compiled in the later tenth century by one of its former members, the priest &AElig;lfhelm, it still comprised a mixed community of priests and nuns when the Danes attacked and dispersed it in the late ninth century. Despite the reported violence, the Danish attack made little impact on the cult. Members of the community seem soon to have returned to Ely, and the shrine itself evidently survived the Danes' attempts to loot it. By the 940s a community of married priests was again actively promoting &AElig;thelthryth.<br>
<br>Bishop &AElig;thelwold of Winchester's refoundation of Ely <i>c</i>.970 involved a fresh sponsorship of &AElig;thelthryth's cult, part of his enlisting of the seventh-century church, as idealized by Bede, in the service of reform. The existing guardians, excoriated for their unchastity, were replaced by Benedictine monks, who recorded the saint's recent miracles, above all her punishment of their polluted predecessors. Under &AElig;thelwold's guidance they gave due honour to &AElig;thelthryth's shrine beside the high altar, placing next to it the newly translated remains of the saint's sister Seaxburh and niece Eormenhild, together with those of another sister, Wihtburh, forcibly removed from Dereham in Norfolk. Images of all four saints stood on either side of the high altar. These activities publicized the cult very effectively. St &AElig;thelthryth was widely commemorated in later Anglo-Saxon calendars not only on the day of her deposition (23 June) but also&#151;especially in communities in East Anglia or under the influence of Winchester&#151;on the day of her translation (17 October). About 1000 &AElig;lfric included an account of her, derived wholly from Bede, in his lives of the saints.<h2>
<a name="Postconquestdevelopments"></a>Post-conquest developments</h2>The continuing vitality of her cult is demonstrated by the role assigned to &AElig;thelthryth in the English revolt against the Normans of 1070&#150;71, in which her community was heavily involved. She was viewed as the special patron and protectress of the rebels, who swore an oath of loyalty on her relics. Despite these affiliations, the Norman abbots continued to promote St &AElig;thelthryth, and the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries saw the production of a considerable amount of new material relating to the cult. Goscelin of Canterbury allegedly produced a text termed a <i>prosa</i>, no longer identifiable, and new miracles were recorded. In 1106 the relics of St &AElig;thelthryth, together with those of Sts Seaxburh, Wihtburh, and Eormenhild were translated to new shrines in the reconstructed choir of the abbey church, &AElig;thelthryth being placed in the position of honour east of the high altar. New lives in prose and verse, including fresh miracles, were produced thereafter, in the time of the first bishop, Hervey (1109&#150;31).<br>
<br>St &AElig;thelthryth's cult, from the thirteenth century magnificently accommodated in Bishop Northwold's extension of the choir, continued to be promoted at Ely throughout the middle ages. The fair held there in association with her feast day (23 June) was a major event at which ribbons that had touched the shrine were in great demand; the quality of the items sold there was, however, such that it gave rise to the adjective &#145;tawdry&#146;, derived from St Audrey, the name by which the saint was then known. Besides Ely, some dozen medieval churches were dedicated to the saint. By the later middle ages her relics were widely distributed among English churches, including Glastonbury, St Albans, Salisbury, Thetford, and Waltham. Durham claimed to possess a stole she had given to St Wilfrid and in 1536 an East Anglian religious foundation allegedly held various personal items including a wimple and a comb. The shrine itself, in the cathedral monastery, was destroyed at the dissolution, but since the late nineteenth century the cult has been promoted at St Etheldreda's, Ely Place, the former chapel of the London palace of the bishops of Ely, returned to Catholic worship in 1874.<br>
