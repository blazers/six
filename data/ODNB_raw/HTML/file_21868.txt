<span class="headword">Pennefather,  William</span>  (1816&#150;1873), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, the youngest of the eight children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21867/', "Richard Pennefather (1772&#150;1859)")</script>, baron of the Irish court of exchequer, and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bennett, was born in Merrion Square, Dublin, on 5 February 1816; one of his elder brothers was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21866/', "Richard Pennefather")</script>. He was educated first at a preparatory school in Dublin; then at Westbury College, near Bristol, where he was known as &#145;the saintly boy&#146;; and finally, from 1832, he was privately tutored by the Revd William Stephens at Levens, near Kendal, Westmorland. He went to Trinity College, Dublin, in 1834, but suffered from consumption and did not graduate BA until 1840; he was drawn into the life of the evangelical community in the city. Ordained deacon in 1841 and priest in the following year, Pennefather was licensed to the curacy of Ballymacugh, co. Cavan, and then became incumbent of Mellifont, near Drogheda, in 1844. A keen supporter of Irish Church Missions, he was active during 1846 and 1847 in famine relief activities. On 16 September 1847 he married <a href="#cosubject_21863">Catherine King [<i>see below</i>]</a>, eldest daughter of Rear-Admiral the Hon. James William King, youngest son of the second earl of Kingston, and his wife, Caroline Cleaver.<br>
<br>In 1848 Pennefather became perpetual curate of Holy Trinity, Walton, Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, a recently created parochial district in the town. His successful ministry there led to his transfer, in 1852, to the perpetual curacy of Christ Church, Barnet, Hertfordshire. A few years later an extra aisle and gallery were added to his church. Pennefather and his wife, themselves childless, began the care of orphans in 1855. Annually from 1856 (except in 1857), he also organized a conference of Christian workers, concentrating on the themes of home and foreign missions, holiness, and the premillennial second advent. In 1860 he began the training of women workers as overseas missionaries, many of whom were to serve with the Church Missionary Society and Church of England Zenana Missionary Society.<br>
<br>In 1864 Pennefather left Barnet for the incumbency of St Jude's, Mildmay Park, Islington, in north London. His annual gathering, for which a purpose-built hall seating 3000 people was opened in 1870, became the Mildmay Conference. The training home evolved into an institution for deaconesses, primarily preparing women for work as uniformed domestic missionaries or, from 1866, as nurses. The strain of co-ordinating this growing evangelical empire led to a complete breakdown of Pennefather's health, which had always been delicate, early in 1873, and he died from apoplexy on 30 April 1873 at his home, Melford Lodge, Muswell Hill, Middlesex. He was buried at Ridge, near Barnet.<br>
<br>Dignified in bearing and courteous in manner, Pennefather impressed contemporaries by the depth of his devotional life and the warmth of his human sympathy. In his love of poetry he nurtured some skill as a hymn writer. Several of his compositions were published, though the only one which remained widely sung was &#145;Jesus, stand among us&#146;. Pennefather's insistence that converted Christians of all denominations should co-operate is eloquently expressed in <span class="italic">The Church of the First-Born</span> (1865). He invited the American evangelist Dwight L. Moody to Britain, but died before the opening of his preaching tour. Pennefather's stress on holiness, like his inauguration of the Mildmay Conference, prepared the way for the Keswick Convention, which first took place two years after his death.<br>
<br>His wife, <a name="cosubject_21863"></a><span class="headword">Catherine Pennefather</span>  (1817/18&#150;1893), <span class="occ">home mission worker</span>, born in Fulham, Middlesex, was active in parochial work throughout her married life. From 1858 she was president of the Association of Female Workers, connected first with Barnet and then with Mildmay. She relaunched her work among orphans in 1872 and, following her husband's death, she presided over the further development of the Mildmay institutions. By her own death at 68 Mildmay Park, Islington, on 12 January 1893 these included twenty missions in London staffed by some eighty deaconesses; a mission to the Jews (started in 1876); a medical mission at Bethnal Green (from 1877); and a cottage hospital (established in 1883). Catherine Pennefather edited the Mildmay monthly journal, <span class="italic">Service for the King</span>, and published several small volumes of verse and <span class="roman">Bible</span> class notes, including <span class="italic">Follow thou me</span> (2 vols., 1881).<br>
