<span class="headword">Gower,  Laurence Cecil Bartlett <span class="st"> [Jim]</span></span>  (1913&#150;1997), <span class="occ">jurist</span>, was born on 29 December 1913 at 22 Disraeli Road, Forest Gate, Essex, the elder child and only son of Henry Laurence Gower, businessman, and his wife, Daisy Ethel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lee. Jim Gower (as he was known throughout his life) was educated at Lindisfarne College and University College, London, from where he graduated with first-class honours in law in 1933. After taking the LLM in 1934, and serving articles with the five-partner Bedford Row firm of Smiles &amp; Co., he was admitted a solicitor in 1937. On 7 September 1939 he married Helen Margaret Shepperson (Peggy) Birch (1910/11&#150;1999), secondary school teacher, the daughter of George Francis Birch, corn merchant. They had three children, Jenny, James, and Richard. Gower served in the army throughout the Second World War (latterly in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps), and played a significant part in the planning of the allied landings in France in June 1944. He ended the war as a lieutenant-colonel (having joined the army as a private).<br>
<br>In 1948 Gower was invited to accept the Sir Ernest Cassel chair of commercial law at the London School of Economics. His fourteen-year tenure of this prestigious post was exceptionally distinguished. In particular, the publication of his <span class="italic">Principles of Modern Company Law</span> in 1954 demonstrated that subjects at the time often regarded as so dominated by the concerns of legal practice as to be unsuitable for academic study could in reality be properly understood only if put into historical and economic context. Gower's own experience and continued involvement in both legal practice and academic life made him well aware of the deficiencies in English legal education; and the reform proposals he made in his inaugural lecture set the terms for debate over the next quarter of a century. In 1962 he saw the possibility of putting his ideas into practice. He resigned the Cassel chair, was appointed adviser on legal education to the Nigerian government and dean of the faculty of law in Lagos, and threw himself energetically into the task of providing Nigeria and other Anglophone African territories with their own systems of legal education putting appropriate emphasis on the skills needed for routine legal practice. But in 1965, as Nigeria moved towards civil war, Gower took a stand on an issue of principle in the university and, in an atmosphere of inter-tribal tension, was summarily sacked from his office as dean.<br>
<br>At this time, the <span class="roman">Law Commissions Act</span> of 1965, giving effect to the Labour Party's pledge to establish a body charged with the systematic development and reform of English law, was going through the United Kingdom parliament; and Gower's experience as a practising solicitor and teacher of law, coupled with his radical (but realistic) approach to the legal system, made him exceptionally well qualified for appointment as one of the five founding law commissioners, who took up office in June 1965.<br>
<br>Gower had had experience (not only in his solicitor's practice but also in the poor man's lawyer clinic, which he and his lifelong friend Arnold Goodman organized in deprived areas of London) of the hardship to which English divorce law gave rise. In 1952 he had given outspoken evidence about the reality of bogus hotel adultery and simulated desertion divorces to the royal commission on marriage and divorce, which had not endeared him to the conservatively minded. But as a law commissioner he was able to suppress his naturally somewhat rebellious and irreverent personality, and his diplomatic skills enabled him to take the lead in successfully negotiating the compromise which became the basis of the <span class="roman">Divorce Reform Act</span> of 1969: the sole ground for divorce was to be that the marriage had irretrievably broken down, although such breakdown was to be inferred from facts akin to the traditional matrimonial offences or from the fact that the parties had lived apart for five years (or two years if they agreed to the divorce). Gower also took the lead in formulating many other proposals made by the Law Commission and in due course enacted, ranging from reform of the law of nullity of marriage to abolition of outdated forms of action, such as breach of promise of marriage, restitution of conjugal rights, and the husband's right to claim damages against the person with whom the wife had committed adultery.<br>
<br>From the many opportunities available to him at the end of his term as a law commissioner, in 1971 Gower accepted the offer of appointment as vice-chancellor of Southampton University. He and his wife, Peggy&#151;who for nearly sixty years shared and unfailingly supported him in all his activities&#151;threw themselves vigorously into the life of the university. Gower was a skilled fund-raiser, and a highly effective administrator (not least in promoting the interests of the university's newly opened medical school); but perhaps the Gowers' greatest achievement was in building up an atmosphere of trust and shared enthusiasm with the student body and academic and administrative staff.<br>
<br>Gower retired from the vice-chancellorship in 1979, but his intellectual (and physical) energy remained undiminished. He had been appointed a trustee of the British Museum in 1968 and continued to give the museum not only sagacious advice about financial and legal issues but also enthusiastic support to extending its wider educational role. He remained a much sought-after lecturer.<br>
<br>By 1981 a number of scandals in the futures, investment, and banking industries had demonstrated the inadequacy of the legislative framework intended to protect investors from fraud; and in that year Gower was appointed by Margaret Thatcher's administration to consider the statutory protection required by private and business investors, and the need for statutory control of dealers and investment consultants and managers. Gower carried out an intensive programme of consultation and research. This not only helped to establish a larger measure of agreement than would previously have been thought possible, but also created a powerful momentum for legislation. If he had had the power to decide policy he would no doubt have recommended the creation of a securities and exchange commission on the United States model (of which he had over the years acquired a profound knowledge). But he recognized that personal conviction had to yield to practical politics, and he drew back from making such a recommendation. The <span class="roman">Financial Services Act</span> of 1986 owed much to his report. His work on investor protection was a fitting climax to a distinguished career as teacher, scholar, and law reformer. His standing is evidenced by the award of eight honorary degrees from universities both in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in the Commonwealth, his election as a fellow of the British Academy in 1965, and his appointment as one of the first queen's counsel <i>honoris causa</i> in 1991.<br>
<br>A man of tall, spare, and angular build, Gower had enormous physical as well as intellectual energy, and his capacities remained undimmed until the last year of his life. He died on Christmas day 1997 in a nursing home at 31 Eton Avenue, Camden, London. He was survived by his wife and their three children.<br>
