<span class="headword">Martyn <span class="st"> [Martin]</span>,  Henry</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1665, <em>d.</em> 1721), <span class="occ">essayist and economist</span>, was baptized on 28 November 1665 at Aldbourne, Wiltshire, the eldest son of Edward Martyn of Upham, in that parish, and his wife, Elizabeth. His brother Edward Martyn (<i>b</i>. 1666), went on to become professor of rhetoric at Gresham College from 1692 to 1720; a younger brother, Richard Martyn, became a linen draper. After schooling at Eton College, he himself matriculated from Pembroke College, Oxford, on 13 March 1684, and graduated BA in 1687 and MA (from Oriel) in 1690. He went on to study at the Middle Temple, but due to ill health never practised as a lawyer, though he held the position of steward of the court that dealt with civil cases in Southwark. He married Sarah Bendall on 31 December 1698.<br>
<br>Martyn wrote on trade and economics to advance whig political and financial interests. He is now known to have been the author of <span class="italic">Considerations upon the East India Trade</span> (1701), a pamphlet whose free trade arguments for the importance of low-cost Indian goods were probably intended to be directed against the tory East India Company. Although reprinted in 1720 as <span class="italic">The Advantages of East-India Trade to England</span>, the pamphlet's advocacy of labour-saving machinery and division of labour was too radical and dangerous to be taken up by contemporaries. Its critique of protectionism impressed later writers, however, including T. B. Macaulay and J. R. McCulloch, and it was cited by Marx in <span class="italic">Das Kapital</span>. Martyn's authorship was conjectured by McCulloch, and considered at length by the Indian economist Parakunnel Joseph Thomas, who rejected earlier attributions to Dudley North and indicated that the balance of evidence favoured Martyn  (Thomas, 171&#150;3). This conclusion was subsequently confirmed by correspondence between the publisher Awnsham Churchill and John Locke and by Locke's own library catalogue, which named Martyn as author  (MacLeod, 223&#150;4).<br>
<br>Later, Martyn adopted a more conventional, protectionist line as one of the leading lights in the movement to set up <span class="italic">The British Merchant, or, Commerce Preserved</span>, a paper designed to focus opposition to a proposed trade treaty with France being negotiated at the Utrecht peace talks in 1713&#150;14. The paper was thus in opposition to Defoe's <span class="italic">Mercator</span>. According to another of the founders, Charles King, Martyn's work was instrumental in making a success of the paper and ensuring the rejection of the treaty. In recognition of his services the whig administration appointed him inspector-general of imports and exports, in which capacity he wrote various papers dealing with the financial affairs of the country. He prepared for the Board of Trade in 1717 or 1718 a report, <span class="italic">Observations upon the Account of Exports and Imports for 17 Years Ending at Christmas 1714</span>. He has also been identified as the author of the memorandum <span class="italic">An Essay Towards Finding the Ballance of Our Whole Trade Annually from Christmas 1698 to Christmas 1719</span>, refuting the contention of Archibald Hutcheson's <span class="italic">The Present State of Public Debts and Funds</span> (1718) that there was an adverse balance of payments.<br>
<br>Martyn wrote for <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> during 1711/12 and <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>. He was almost certainly the Philarithmus of <span class="italic">Spectator</span> number 180, and has been linked to articles in other issues of the paper including numbers 143 (Cottilus), 200, and 232. In issue number 555 Richard Steele praises Martyn highly, and acknowledges his indebtedness to his work, listing him alongside&#151;indeed, ahead of&#151;Alexander Pope, John Hughes, Henry Carey, Thomas Tickell, Thomas Parnell, and Laurence Eusden. He died at Blackheath on 25 March 1721.<br>
<br>Henry Martyn's only son, <a name="cosubject_18174"></a><span class="headword">Bendal <span class="st"> [Bendall]</span> Martyn</span>  (1700&#150;1761), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born in London on 8 January 1700. Bendal attended Eton College, then King's College, Cambridge, where he was admitted as a scholar on 3 February 1719. He graduated BA in 1722, and was made a fellow of the college. He was also registered at the Middle Temple on 14 April 1721. Between 1736 and his death he held the post of secretary to the excise, and in 1740 he inherited a good estate from an aunt. He died on 20 December 1761 at Highgate. He was reputedly an excellent musician, and in 1763 fourteen trio sonatas, written by him, were published.<br>
