<span class="headword">Spofforth,  Reginald</span>  (1768<span class="mult">x</span>70&#150;1827), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born in Southwell, Nottinghamshire, the son of a currier. His uncle, Thomas Spofforth, was organist of Southwell Minster and gave him his first musical tuition. Encouraged by Sir Richard Kaye, a prebendary of Southwell who was also dean of Lincoln, he went to Lincoln and became deputy organist at the cathedral. He then moved to London and studied composition with Benjamin Cooke and the piano with Daniel Steibelt. His first success as a composer came in 1793, when he won two prizes offered by the Noblemen's and Gentlemen's Catch Club for the glees &#145;See! smiling from the rosy east&#146; and &#145;Where are those hours?&#146;.<br>
<br>Although his earliest publications were of solo songs, Spofforth's importance as a composer is based on the numerous glees (about seventy-five in number) that he published from 1796, many of which also appeared in anthologies. One of them, &#145;Hail! smiling morn&#146; (no. 6 of <span class="italic">Six Glees</span>, 1818), was the most popular item in the entire repertory of glees. Spofforth composed many songs and duets and left three books of nursery-rhyme settings, but no instrumental or sacred music.<br>
<br>Spofforth was chorus master at Covent Garden for a time, and wrote various songs and glees for productions there, but turned down an invitation to succeed William Shield as musical director in 1797. He also served as organist at Fitzroy Chapel and later at Eltham parish church, and was active as a teacher. Some of his unpublished works were issued after his death as <span class="italic">A Collection of Glees</span> (1830), with a memoir by his former pupil William Hawes. Spofforth died in Kensington on 8 September 1827, and was buried in the parish church there. A tablet to his memory was erected in Brompton cemetery.<br>
<br>A younger brother, Samuel Spofforth (1780&#150;1864), composed some sacred music and was organist of Peterborough Cathedral and, from 1807, of Lichfield Cathedral.<br>
