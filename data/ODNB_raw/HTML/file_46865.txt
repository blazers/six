<span class="headword">Dawson, Sir  (Arthur) Trevor</span>, first baronet  (1866&#150;1931), <span class="occ">armaments manufacturer</span>, was born on 1 May 1866 at Dalkeith House, Richmond, Surrey, son of Hugh Dawson (1836&#150;1884), landowner and barrister, and his wife, formerly Mary Ann Chaffer. Trevor Dawson (as he was always known) became a naval cadet in 1879 and was educated at the Royal Academy, Gosport, and on the training ship <i>Britannia</i>. He became a midshipman of the channel squadron in 1881 and subsequently trained at the Royal Naval colleges at Portsmouth and Greenwich, the Royal Artillery College at Woolwich, and the torpedo school on HMS <i>Vernon</i>. He was gazetted lieutenant in 1887 (serving on a cruiser in the Mediterranean) and appointed in 1892 as experimental officer at Woolwich arsenal. In that year, he married Louise (1870&#150;1935), daughter of John Miller Grant. They had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Dawson's service career ended in 1896, when he was recruited as ordnance superintendent of the private armaments manufacturers Vickers. In 1898 he was elected to the company's board. He soon familiarized himself with every aspect of its business, and mastered the daily running of each department. Tall, athletic, and dominant, he worked with ferocious energy; the pace and intensity of his life would have broken most men. Appointed managing director of Vickers in 1906, he was involved in general administration, commercial negotiations, production, and design as well as liaison with the Admiralty, Foreign Office, War Office, and overseas buyers. He had expert knowledge of naval shipbuilding, land and sea guns of all sizes and types, explosives, mines, and other weaponry. The management of Vickers' submarine business after 1902 was a success particularly associated with him. Only two areas of the company were not stamped with his influence: the steelworks (managed by members of the Vickers family) and finance, controlled by Sir Vincent Caillard (1856&#150;1930).<br>
<br>From 1900 Dawson was chairman of Chilworth Gunpowder, a British company set up under the Anglo-German pooling agreement of the explosives trade. He was a director of many of Vickers' overseas companies, such as Canadian-Vickers, Vickers-Terni in Italy, and the Placencias arsenal in Spain. He had numerous associated directorships, notably of Wolseley Motors and of William Beardmore &amp; Co. (both until 1926).<br>
<br>Dawson's knowledge of service needs and contacts with officials were invaluable. His name was restored to the navy list in 1902, by which date he was an important individual in British war preparations. He testified to several government enquiries, sat on departmental committees, was a frequent visitor to the service ministries, and undertook confidential intelligence work. On one occasion he collected evidence for the Admiralty on German naval shipbuilding by skating round the ice-bound dockyards at Kiel to see the ships under construction. He travelled extensively on business and was an adept in all the arcane influences of the international arms trade. Oakeley Arnold-Forster, then secretary of state for war, described him in 1904 as &#145;this clever but somewhat slippery gentleman&#146;  (diary, BL, Add. MS 50342). He was inveterate and ingenious in his efforts to maintain orders. At the height of the Anglo-American naval rivalry Dawson sent Walter Long, first lord of the Admiralty, data &#145;very secretly obtained from absolutely reliable sources&#146; on US government orders for armour plate, intended to strengthen Long's case in cabinet for large naval spending  (T. Dawson to W. Long, 1 Nov 1920, Wilts. &amp; Swindon HC, Long MS 716/1).<br>
<br>Dawson was at the centre of the munitions crisis of 1914&#150;18. &#145;This Is A Big War! so send Sir Trevor Dawson &hellip; [to] New York with carte blanche&#146;, Lord Fisher urged Winston Churchill on 2 March 1915. &#145;You want a &#147;pusher&#148; like Dawson who will go everywhere and buy everything!&#146;  (Gilbert, 608). Dawson had the trust of many officials and politicians, and tried to serve the national interest as he perceived it; but the expansion of Vickers' armaments output was so great and conditions so disrupted that misjudgments were inevitable. There were many accusations of overpricing. As Christopher Addison, minister of munitions, noted of a meeting in 1916, &#145;Trevor Dawson metaphorically shrouded himself in the Union Jack and almost wept as I expostulated that these great patriotic firms were charging too much&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., Addison diary, 8 Feb 1916).<br>
<br>Dawson was a decisive force in Vickers during the company's financial and managerial crisis in 1920&#150;26, and remained a director until his death. Nevertheless the appointment of the ordnance specialist Sir George Buckham to the Vickers board after the war, followed after 1925 by the rise on the naval side of Dawson's prot&eacute;g&eacute; Charles Craven and the appointment of Sir J. F. Noel Birch (1865&#150;1939) to take charge of land armaments in 1928, were signs of Dawson's declining powers at Vickers. Several incidents contributed to this decline. In 1915&#150;16 he was involved with the Canadian speculator Grant Morden MP in launching the British Cellulose and Chemical Manufacturing Company. After unscrupulous &#145;bulling&#146;, the company's 6<i>d</i>. shares of 1916 were worth &pound;14 10<i>s</i>. in 1918. This profiteering became notorious as the &#145;dope scandal&#146; investigated by the select committee on national expenditure in 1918 and by an official enquiry chaired by Lord Sumner in 1919. Dawson's standing was further injured by litigation in 1920 between Admiral Sir Percy Scott and Vickers, caused by Dawson's careless dealings with Scott over royalty payments on his patented naval gun-sights. At one stage the judge, Lord Coleridge, interrupted Dawson's evidence to comment, &#145;that will not do: I was not born yesterday&#146;, and after judgment was given in the admiral's favour, Dawson offered to resign from the Vickers board. His interests continued to seem suspect: the colonial secretary Leo Amery recorded in 1924, &#145;Trevor Dawson came to see me about oil in Mosul&#151;evidently in connexion with Inverforth's most shady and unpatriotic negotiations with the Turks&#146;  (Barnes and Nicholson, 391).<br>
<br>Dawson was a forceful proponent of airships from the inception of Vickers' airship building programme in 1908. He wrote a paper on the subject for <span class="italic">Engineering</span> (22 October 1920), a letter in <span class="italic">The Times</span> (11 July 1921), and an article in <span class="italic">Brassey's Naval Annual, 1921&#150;22</span>. In 1924 he persuaded Vickers to collaborate with Dennistoun Burney's companies in constructing the R100 airship. It was a technical success during flights in 1929&#150;30, but as the British government contributed only &pound;350,000 towards building costs of &pound;460,000 and a base charge of &pound;110,000, Vickers lost &pound;220,000. Dawson was an expansive, ebullient man, and his rumbustiousness, which had so well suited the Edwardian arms race and wartime production crisis, was a liability in the conditions of disarmament and worldwide arms surpluses prevailing in the 1920s.<br>
<br>Dawson received medals from the Royal Society of Arts and the Junior Institution of Engineers (of which he was president in 1912&#150;13). He was prime warden of the Fishmongers' Company in 1920&#150;21 and held decorations from Spain and Japan. He was a strong imperialist. For twenty years he was a knight (latterly knight-president) of the Round Table Club, which fostered inter-imperial trade and held banquets for visiting dominion leaders in London. In 1916 he formed a pressure group called the London Imperialists, intended to secure the election of business-minded MPs for London constituencies; it was later reorganized and expanded as the British Commonwealth Union, on whose executive committee he sat in 1918&#150;25.<br>
<br>Knighted on 9 November 1909, Dawson was listed to receive a barony in the new year's honours of 1917, but his name was deleted at the last moment (possibly because of the political unpopularity of the big armaments companies). He was consoled with a baronetcy on 5 February 1920. Dawson died very abruptly, of heart failure, on 19 May 1931, at his country home, Edgewarebury House, Elstree, Hertfordshire, and was buried on 21 May in Elstree churchyard.<br>
