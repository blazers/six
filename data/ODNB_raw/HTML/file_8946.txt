<span class="headword">Evans,  Christmas</span>  (1766&#150;1838), <span class="occ">Baptist minister</span>, was born on 25 December 1766, at Esgair Wen, a thatched cottage in the parish of Llandysul, Cardiganshire, the son of Samuel Evans, shoemaker, and his wife, Joanna Lewis. They had three children, a daughter and two sons; Christmas was their second child. His father died in 1775, when Evans was only nine years old, and left the family in a state of complete destitution. The next four years Evans spent with James Lewis, his mother's brother, at Bwlchog in the parish of Llanfihangel-ar-arth in Carmarthenshire. He left him to become a farm servant, working at various places, including Castellhywel, the home of David Davis (1745&#150;1827), the learned Arian minister of the Arminian congregation at Llwynrhydowen. In 1783 Evans underwent conversion during a revival there and became a member of the church. He was given a basic education by Davis in his school, learning to read Welsh, and acquiring some knowledge of English.<br>
<br>Evans began to preach at cottage meetings, but as the strict rules of the Presbyterians required an academic education for their ministers, he gravitated towards the Baptists, who had no such limitations, in order to enter the ministry. In 1788 he was baptized in the River Duar at Llanybydder in Carmarthenshire by Timothy Thomas (1754&#150;1840), and joined his Baptist congregation at Aberdyar. Earlier, he had lost one eye in an accident but according to the Baptist minister Robert Hall (1764&#150;1831) his surviving eye was one &#145;that could light an army through a wilderness on a dark night&#146;  (W. Morgan, 25).<br>
<br>In 1776 the Baptists had launched their mission to north Wales. At the assembly held at Maes-y-Berllan, Brecknockshire, on 8&#150;11 June 1789, representatives from the new churches in north Wales pleaded for ministerial help. Christmas Evans volunteered his services and had a successful preaching tour in Anglesey and Caernarvonshire. In August 1789 he was ordained at Salem, Ty'ndonnen, in the parish of Botwnnog to serve the Baptists of Ll&#375;n. On 23 October 1789, at Bryncroes parish church, he married Catherine Jones, a member of his congregation. They had no children.<br>
<br>During the autumn of 1789 Evans experienced a transformation of spirit due to a profound realization of the wonder of God's grace, and the discovery of the significance of the Welsh revivalist tradition. At once his preaching became more vivacious and dramatic, marking the incursion of the Methodist spirit into the Baptist pulpit. On Christmas day 1791 he moved to Anglesey to act as minister to all the Baptist churches in the island. He lived at Llangefni, where the leading chapel, Cil-dwrm, was situated. Between 1795 and 1798 the minister of Ramoth, Merioneth, John Richard Jones (1765&#150;1822), sought to persuade his fellow Baptists of the validity of the anti-evangelical teachings of Robert Sandeman (1718&#150;1771) and Archibald McClean (1733&#150;1812), and in 1798 initiated a split among the churches. For a time Christmas Evans was attracted to these views, but as he later confessed, Sandemanian opinions drove away his &#145;spirit of prayer for the salvation of sinners&#146;. He resumed his orthodoxy, and became the central figure in a great Baptist movement in Anglesey. Although for many years his salary was only &pound;17 a year, he ruled over the Anglesey Baptists with a rod of iron; he built new chapels, and made at least two long and laborious preaching journeys every year all over Wales to collect money to pay off the chapel debts, which often weighed heavily upon him. These tours boosted his reputation, as crowds flocked to hear his sermons. Evans alternated humour and pathos effectively, and his startling power of declamation exercised extraordinary influence over his auditors.<br>
<br>On 22 October 1823 Catherine Evans died; in the same year Evans suffered much ill health. His wounded eye often troubled him, and he was periodically threatened with blindness. At last the Baptist churches of Anglesey threw off the yoke of Evans's ministry, aiming to become independent churches: his position as a sort of Baptist bishop was no longer tenable. He bitterly resented their choosing ministers without reference to him, and a lawsuit about a chapel debt added to his difficulties. In 1826 he gladly accepted the ministry of Tonyfelin Chapel in Caerphilly in Glamorgan.<br>
<br>Evans ministered very effectively at Caerphilly for two years. On 23 April 1828 at Eglwysilan parish church, he married as his second wife Mary Jones, who had been his maid at Llangefni. They had no children. But difficulties with his flock again arose, causing him to move to Cardiff in September 1828; but the constitution of that church was so democratic that his autocratic ways again created problems, and in 1832 he made his final change to Caernarfon. Despite the dissensions of the thirty church members, the drunkenness of some, and the pressure of a debt of &pound;800, he was not unhappy.<br>
<br>While on a journey to collect money towards the chapel debt in south Wales, Evans was suddenly taken ill, and died on 19 July 1838 in the house of the Revd Daniel Davies in Oxford Street, Swansea, attended by his wife. On 23 July he was buried with great honour in the burial-ground of the Bethesda Welsh Baptist Chapel at Swansea.<br>
<br>Christmas Evans was a complex character. He was generous to a fault, an untiring worker, perfectly sincere, and a man of deep spirituality. And yet he was impulsive and wayward. He could be dictatorial in his pastoral work and could not suffer criticism with equanimity. Apart from his sermons, published in Welsh, his only other publications were some Welsh hymns and tracts. But there is no doubting his extraordinary influence as a preacher: huge crowds gathered to hear him and his converts were legion. His vivid imagination transformed biblical stories and parables into gripping dramas. Although he sought by hard reading to overcome the limitations of his lack of education, he never acquired the equipment to make a sophisticated contribution to theology. Nevertheless he had a significant place in the growing influence of evangelicalism in nineteenth-century Wales.<br>
