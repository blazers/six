<span class="headword">Pickard,  Benjamin</span>  (1842&#150;1904), <span class="occ">trade unionist and politician</span>, was born on 28 February 1842 at Kippax, Yorkshire, the son of Thomas and Elizabeth Pickard. He was educated locally until the age of twelve, left school to join his father in the pit, and went on to work at other jobs at the collieries belonging to Messrs Locke &amp; Co.<br>
<br>Pickard was active in the trade union movement at an early age, first at regional, then at national and international levels. He joined the Kippax lodge of the West Yorkshire Miners' Association, becoming lodge secretary at the age of sixteen. He went on to become assistant secretary of the association in 1873, and three years later he was appointed general secretary. He took a leading role in the 1881 amalgamation of the West Yorkshire Miners' Association and the South Yorkshire Miners' Association into the Yorkshire Miners' Association. As first general secretary of the new organization, he saw it grow into the third largest trade union in the coal industry, and one of the largest in the country.<br>
<br>Pickard was even more successful at the national level. In 1877 he became vice-president under Alexander Macdonald (1821&#150;1881) of the Miners' National Union, and went on to take a leading part, with Thomas Ashton (1841&#150;1919) of Lancashire, in the establishment of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain (MFGB). As founder president, he saw this organization too grow enormously. By 1893, the federation's 200,000 members represented nearly a third of the mining workforce (and about a seventh of all British trade unionists); seven years later the federation numbered among its members nearly half of all miners (and a sixth of all trade unionists) in the country. Pickard led the MFGB in the 1893 lock-out, the largest industrial dispute that the country had ever seen. Whether the dispute is judged a success or a failure, it marked the coming of age of the Miners' Federation and a decisive turning point in the history of British industrial relations.<br>
<br>Internationally, Pickard was active in the formation of the International Federation of Mineworkers in 1890, and he attended congresses in Austria, Belgium, France, and Germany. He was active in other ways too, his interest in arbitration leading to his participation in a peace deputation to the president of the United States, Grover Cleveland, in 1897.<br>
<br>Pickard was also active politically as an &#145;ardent liberal&#146; in the labour interest. He became a member of the Wakefield school board in 1881 and eight years later he was elected an alderman of the West Riding county council (he was re-elected twice more). In 1885 he was elected to parliament to represent Normanton, a constituency in which over 60 per cent of the electorate were miners, and which he held until his death in 1904. Although it has been claimed that &#145;Pickard was not a success as an MP&#146;  (<span class="italic">DLB</span>), he led the lengthy campaign for a statutory eight-hour day for underground workers which finally proved successful four years after his death.<br>
<br>Pickard seemed both to many contemporaries and to many later commentators to epitomize, in his personality and policies, the essence of late nineteenth-century &#145;Lib&#150;Lab&#146; coalmining trade union leadership. A Wesleyan local preacher and supporter of the Lord's Rest Day Association, he was for most of his life a non-smoker and teetotaller. Stubborn, aloof, and rather distant, his ruthlessness and single-mindedness earned him the sobriquet &#145;the Iron Man&#146;. In 1864 Pickard married Hannah Elizabeth Freeman of Kippax, who predeceased him in 1901. They had four sons and four daughters. Pickard died of heart failure at 2 St Stephen's Mansions, Church Street, Westminster, London, on 3 February 1904 and was buried in Barnsley cemetery on 6 February. He left an estate worth &pound;2019 net (having received gifts of &pound;750 from the miners after the 1893 dispute and &pound;500 from his fellow Liberal MPs in 1897).<br>
