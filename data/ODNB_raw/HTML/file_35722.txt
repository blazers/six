<span class="headword">Reitz,  Deneys</span>  (1882&#150;1944), <span class="occ">soldier and politician in South Africa</span>, was born at Bloemfontein, Orange Free State, on 2 April 1882, the third of the five sons of Francis William Reitz (1844&#150;1934), and his first wife, Blanca Thesen (1854&#150;1887), a member of a Norwegian family that had settled in Knysna, Cape Colony. Reitz's was an old and cultured family: his grandfather was sent from Cape Town to school in Edinburgh, and according to family tradition once dined with Sir Walter Scott. His father, who was educated in Edinburgh and made lively Afrikaans renderings of Burns, served as chief justice and later president of the Orange Free State; in 1898 he became secretary of state to President Kruger and in that capacity presented the ultimatum which precipitated the South African War. After the union he became first president of the senate, retiring in 1918; his sister Frances Hester Reitz married W. P. Schreiner. At home Deneys Reitz grew to be familiar with the English classics; he saw many leading figures in South African public life, and at twelve years of age joined his father on a tour in Europe. He early learned to ride and shoot, and attended Grey College, Bloemfontein, but his formal education ended when at the age of seventeen he joined the Boer forces in the South African War.<br>
<br>After serving in the fighting round Ladysmith, Reitz ranged widely for two years, especially with J. C. Smuts through Cape Colony. He later gave a full account, with characteristic charm and generosity, of &#145;the hairbreadth escapes, the dare-devilry&#146; (to use the words of Smuts) in his book <span class="italic">Commando</span> (1929), which is an invaluable document on the history of the war from the Boer side. After <span class="italic">Commando</span> he wrote two further autobiographical volumes, <span class="italic">Trekking on</span> (1933) and <span class="italic">No Outspan</span> (1943), which were also marked successes.<br>
<br>After the treaty of Vereeniging (1902) Reitz stood by his father in refusing the oath of allegiance and went into exile. Three years in Madagascar brought him hard work, little pay, and much fever, but during this time he produced the first draft of <span class="italic">Commando</span>. In 1905 Mrs Smuts persuaded him to return and he arrived ill and penniless, but life in the Smuts family restored him to health, and he was able to begin law practice at Heilbron, Orange River Colony, in 1908. Reitz became politically active when he joined the South African Party of Louis Botha and Smuts with its policy of reconciliation between Afrikaans- and English-speaking South Africans, and of full autonomy for South Africa within the British empire. In 1914, in support of Botha and Smuts, he helped suppress the rising which broke out. He then served with Botha in South-West Africa against the Germans. In 1915 Reitz was the South African Party's candidate in Heilbron in the general election. After an emotional and violent campaign, he was soundly defeated by the candidate of the National Party, the political platform of Afrikaner nationalism. He promptly joined the South African forces in east Africa under Smuts. In 1917 this seasoned former enemy of Britain enlisted in the British army and went as a major to the western front where he was twice wounded and in the closing stages of the war was colonel commanding the 1st (Royal Scots) Fusiliers.<br>
<br>On his return to South Africa Reitz entered politics as Smuts's prot&eacute;g&eacute;. He was elected to parliament for the constituency of Bloemfontein South in 1920, but lost his seat in the general election of 1921. Within a few months he returned to parliament as the representative of Port Elizabeth (Central). Reitz had one guiding political faith, unswerving loyalty to Smuts. Like Smuts, he firmly believed in the sincerity of British friendship towards South Africa and in the possibilities of building a nation of Afrikaners and English speakers within the empire. He rejected the Afrikaner nationalism of the National Party as race-worshipping &#145;voodooism&#146;. As a politician he was a doughty campaigner on election platforms where he was a hard hitter who neither asked nor expected any quarter. In the general election of 1929 he left his safe seat to contest Barberton, a seat held by the National Party. Despite the South African Party's crushing defeat in the election, he captured the constituency. He was, however, a poor parliamentary speaker who rarely bothered to prepare his speeches. Although he occasionally excelled in the cut and thrust of debate he was bored by parliamentary life.<br>
<br>In April 1921 Reitz became the minister of lands. He was an ardent conservationist who as minister prepared the way for the inauguration of the Kruger National Park, of which he became a devoted trustee. Out of office between 1924 and 1933, he joined a legal firm in Johannesburg which provided him with the opportunity to practise some journalism and to travel widely in Africa. In the coalition (&#145;fusion&#146;) government of 1933 he was re-appointed minister of lands in General J. B. M. Hertzog's cabinet. He subsequently became minister of agriculture in 1935, of mines in 1938, and of native affairs in 1939. Although paternalistic, he was a pragmatic and enlightened minister of native affairs. He recognized that Africans had major and legitimate grievances and during the Second World War saw the Atlantic charter as a basis for reform. This led to accusations that he was too liberal. After the collapse of &#145;fusion&#146; in 1939 Reitz became in addition deputy prime minister. Although enterprising, especially with regard to advancing irrigation schemes during his tenure as minister of lands, he was not an outstanding minister. He had a cavalier attitude towards ministerial tasks and despised the drudgery of desk work. But the post did provide him with the opportunity to travel widely. In 1920 Reitz had married Leila Agnes Buissinn&eacute; (1887&#150;1959), daughter of Dr Claude Wright, of Wynberg, near Cape Town. His wife was a history lecturer at the University of Cape Town, and was the first woman in South Africa to be elected an MP. They had two sons, who both served in the South African forces during the Second World War.<br>
<br>In 1943, troubled by ill health and exhaustion, Reitz was appointed high commissioner in London, South Africa's most important diplomatic posting. Although socially successful and popular, his bad health, wanderlust, and lack of interest in his duties meant that he was not an effective high commissioner. After suffering a stroke he died in the Charing Cross Hospital, London, on 19 October 1944. He was cremated on 25 October.<br>
<br>Although he was incurably indolent, Reitz's physical and moral courage, his forthrightness, tolerance, humour, and talent as a raconteur made him a notable personality and an endearing and popular one. It was sheer force of personality that carried him through a turbulent political career. Reitz's life was a triumph of character.<br>
