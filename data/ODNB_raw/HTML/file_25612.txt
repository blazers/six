<span class="headword">Sinclair,  Catherine</span>  (1800&#150;1864), <span class="occ">novelist and children's writer</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 17 April 1800. She was the fourth daughter and seventh of the thirteen children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25627/', "Sir John Sinclair, first baronet (1754&#150;1835)")</script>, of Ulbster, first president of the board of agriculture, and his second wife, Lady Diana MacDonald (1769&#150;1845), daughter of Alexander, first Lord MacDonald of Sleat. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25617/', "Sir George Sinclair, second baronet (1790&#150;1868)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25629/', "Archdeacon John Sinclair (1797&#150;1875)")</script>, and the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25636/', "Revd William Sinclair (1804&#150;1878)")</script> were her brothers. She also had two half-sisters from her father's first marriage. She and her sisters were all very tall, and jokes circulated about Sir John Sinclair's 6-and-30 feet of daughters: the pavement outside their house was known as the &#145;Giants' Causeway&#146;. S. C. Hall states that she was badly scarred with smallpox. She was educated at home, and, from the age of fourteen, acted as secretary to her father, who maintained an extensive correspondence with agriculturists and politicians in Europe and America. It is said that she wrote from his dictation for five or six hours daily for many years. The family were members of the Scottish Episcopal church, and an evangelical protestantism is promoted throughout Sinclair's fiction. Her sister Julia (<i>d</i>. 1868), with whom Sinclair lived in the later part of her life, married in 1824, as his second wife, the fourth earl of Glasgow (1765&#150;1843), and had a son and a daughter, for whom Sinclair's first book, <span class="italic">Charlie Seymour, or, The Good Aunt and the Bad Aunt</span> (1832), was written. She had earlier published in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span> (25, February 1829, 189&#150;92), one of the horror stories in which the magazine specialized: &#145;The Murder Hole: an ancient Legend&#146;, which is about a murderous innkeeper, based on a rural legend. After her father's death Sinclair's rate of production increased. She began with a novel of fashionable life, of the then popular &#145;silver fork&#146; school, <span class="italic">Modern Accomplishments</span> (1836), which was followed by a sequel, <span class="italic">Modern Society</span> (1837). <span class="italic">Hill and Valley, or, Hours in England and Wales</span> (1838) was the first of a series of travel books. But her best book and most enduring success was <span class="italic">Holiday House: a Series of Tales</span> (1839). Harry and Laura, perhaps based on her nephew and niece, live with their kind grandmother and uncle, and a severe nurse. They are always getting into trouble, unlike their saintly brother Frank, who goes away to sea, returning to die nobly in the last chapter, effecting the conversion of his unregenerate brother and sister. In a preface Sinclair states that Frank's death was based on that of her brother James (<i>d</i>. 1826), and that she wanted to describe &#145;noisy, frolicsome, mischievous children&#146; rather than the paragons of contemporary children's fiction. The book combines an improving religious message with the entertaining account of Harry and Laura's misdeeds, and was both innovative and popular. <span class="italic">Sir Edward Graham, or, The Railway Speculators</span> (1849) is a novel for adults, with many of the same characters, in which Harry and Laura both find romance and marriage. Sinclair's other adult fiction, also of markedly evangelical tone, includes the perhaps semi-autobiographical <span class="italic">Jane Bouverie</span> (1846), and <span class="italic">Beatrice</span> (1852), which came out in the aftermath of the &#145;papal aggression&#146; crisis, and has a fiercely anti-Catholic message. She also published tracts and devotional works. A late success was the series of picture letters for children published between 1861 and 1864, in which words and hieroglyphic pictures are appealingly mingled. Sinclair devoted herself to charitable works of a practical as well as religious kind. She founded a mission school at Water of Leith, a volunteer corps, and a Sinclair Cooking Depot in Edinburgh, to provide good cheap food for the poor. She also set up public benches and drinking-fountains in that city. She died at Kensington vicarage, London, the home of her brother John, on 6 August 1864, and was buried in the graveyard of St John's Episcopal Church, Edinburgh, ten days later. After her death a meeting was held in Edinburgh to erect a memorial by public subscription, which still stands on the corner of Albyn Place and North Charlotte Street.<br>
