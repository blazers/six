<span class="headword">Alex,  (Edward) Ephraim</span>  (1800&#150;1882), <span class="occ">founder of the Jewish Board of Guardians</span>, was born on 12 December 1800 in St Katherine in the City of London. He was the eldest surviving son of Solomon Alex, dentist, of 11 Finsbury Place, Finsbury, and 21 Jewry Street, Aldgate, who was born abroad; his mother's name was probably Rachel. On 15 March 1840 Alex married Catherine, widow of Barron Jones and the daughter of Aaron Jones. They had no children and Catherine died on 16 June 1858. Alex practised as a dental surgeon at Bridge Street, Blackfriars, from 1829, and then at 35 Lower Brook Street, Westminster.<br>
<br>At the beginning of the nineteenth century the charitable system for poor Jews of German and Polish descent operated under a system which had been established in 1753 to meet the needs of a community of 8000, but by 1858 this had grown to 40,000. Alex was overseer of the Great Synagogue, London, and it was due to his efforts that the Jewish Board of Guardians was founded. On 12 January 1858 the committee of the Great Synagogue, largely at Alex's insistence, resolved that a board of guardians be appointed to relieve the strange and foreign poor. Delegates from the three main German congregations agreed on 15 July 1858 to recommend to their synagogues the establishment of a board of guardians. In early 1859 Alex sent out for private circulation an eight-page pamphlet on the subject, and on 22 February 1859 called the attention of his vestry to the state of the foreign poor. At the preliminary meeting of the board of guardians, on 25 February 1859, Alex was requested to act as temporary chairman. Finally, on 16 March 1859, the first meeting of the board was held at the Great Synagogue chambers and Alex was unanimously elected president for twelve months. He remained president for ten years, and retired only because of failing health. In April 1866, at a special meeting of the board at which the lord mayor of London and the chief rabbi were present, a public address of thanks was given to him for his services, and in June 1869 the board resolved that he be elected a life member and his name be recorded in all proceedings as founder and first president. His portrait, which had been painted by Professor Hart, was purchased by voluntary subscribers and hung in the offices of the board of guardians. In May 1869 Alex was elected a member of the Society of Arts.<br>
<br>After suffering from cancer of the bladder for nine months, but still an active member of the board, Alex died on 13 November 1882 at his home, 5 Chichester Street, Harrow Road. On his death a resolution of sympathy was passed by the Jewish Board of Guardians to his sisters. In a letter to the <span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span> dated 17 November 1882, Lionel Cohen, president of the Jewish Board of Guardians, described the gentleness of disposition and suavity of manner, which, combined with firmness of purpose, enabled Alex to surmount difficulties. Laurie Magnus's <span class="italic">The Jewish Welfare Board and the Men who Made it, 1859&#150;1909</span> (1909) mentioned Alex's qualities of address, tact, and enthusiasm, which were invaluable to the long negotiations out of which this board had sprung. V. D. Lipman's <span class="italic">A Century of Social Service, 1859&#150;1959: the Jewish Board of Guardians</span> (1959) noted Alex's tactical skill in seizing an opportunity, which was responsible for the board's foundation.<br>
<br>Alex's funeral took place at Willesden Jewish cemetery on 17 November 1882. His memorial stone, erected by his colleagues as a tribute of respect and esteem, was consecrated on Sunday 11 March 1883 by his friend the Revd A. L. Green, who died suddenly the same day. In 1963 the Jewish Board of Guardians became the Jewish Welfare Board, and in 1990 merged with the Jewish Blind Society to become Jewish Care, Anglo-Jewry's largest social services organization.<br>
