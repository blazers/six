<span class="headword">Busby,  Charles Augustin</span>  (1786&#150;1834), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 27 June 1786 in Poland Street, London, one month before the wedding of his parents, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4158/', "Dr Thomas Busby (1754&#150;1838)")</script>, musician and author, and Priscilla Angier (<i>bap</i>. 1760, <i>d</i>. before 1838), daughter of Charles Angier of Earls Court; Augustus has invariably yet erroneously been given as his middle name. Educated at home with six younger brothers and sisters, he exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1801, entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1803, and won the gold medal four years later. Two volumes of designs by Busby followed in 1808: <span class="italic">A Series of Designs for Villas and Country Houses</span> and <span class="italic">A Collection of Designs for Modern Embellishments</span>. Bingham called the latter &#145;one of the prettiest pattern books produced during the Regency&#146;  (Bingham, 32), and they brought the young unknown several commissions, but open competition found him his first significant contract: the Commercial Coffee Rooms, Corn Street, Bristol (1809; exh. RA, 1810). On 3 July 1811, as the building neared completion, he married Louisa Mary Williams, with whom he had two children.<br>
<br>Attracted by the intellectual rigour of the Greek revival, Busby also possessed a lifelong fascination for everything mechanical; he patented a hydraulic system to save water in canals (1813) and worked up designs for cast-iron roofs, and always described himself as an &#145;architect and engineer&#146;. Following his apprenticeship to Daniel Alexander, Busby received a commission to create a Gothic castle at Gwrych, Denbighshire (exh. RA, 1814), which he hoped would launch a successful country house practice. In 1816&#150;17, however, the castle was taken from him and one of his iron roofs may have collapsed; the allegation comes from a later hostile source, and cannot be substantiated. Within months he was in America, where, based in New York, he experimented with the propulsion of steamboats and studied prison design. Yet he apparently received only one commission in America: the Bolingbroke Theatre, Petersburg, Virginia (1817&#150;18), and was obliged to return to Britain to a lowly clerkship under Francis Goodwin (1784&#150;1835), whose office was then flush with projects for the commissioners for new churches. Part-way through a shabby scheme to secure additional contracts by circumventing commission regulations the venal pair fell out. Without delay, Busby secured his own commissioners' jobs in Leeds and Oldham (1821; exh. RA, 1822), only to see the plans rejected on the advice of Nash and Smirke, because the iron roofs were seen to be weak and insecure. Again Busby quit London, this time at the invitation of Thomas Read Kemp.<br>
<br>Kemp provided Busby with high-profile work in Brighton and brokered a partnership with a talented local architect, <a name="cosubject_64995"></a><span class="headword">Amon Henry Wilds</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1790, <em>d.</em> 1857), not, as was long thought, with his father, Amon Wilds (1762&#150;1833), carpenter and then builder. He was baptized at All Saints', Lewes, Sussex, on 4 November 1790, the son of Amon Wilds and his wife, Sarah Dunn (1764&#150;1822); the date of 1784 universally given for Wilds's birth is presumably incorrect. In Brighton the Wildses had built for Kemp a chapel (Holy Trinity, Ship Street, 1817) and possibly a residence, The Temple (1819), while for the Unitarians they created a majestic Doric temple in New Road (1820). In 1823 Kemp commissioned the younger Wilds and Busby to create a homonymous speculative development. From Kemp Town they continued sometimes together, often individually, to establish such an ascendancy that Regency Brighton, judged in the 1830s &#145;alone to be equalled at St Petersburg&#146;  (Dale, 10), was essentially their creation. While lack of surviving documentary evidence has made it difficult to distinguish the works of Busby in Brighton from those of Wilds (almost invariably, their drawings are signed &#145;Wilds &amp; Busby&#146;), the inclusion of Egyptian details, ammonite Ionic capitals, and bold scallop shells recessed over windows, and later, Italianate designs, characterize the work of Wilds. Individual works by Busby include the chapels of St Margaret (1824; dem. 1959) and St George (1824&#150;5), and Portland Place (1824&#150;8; plans exh. RA, 1830). After only twenty-five months the partnership between Busby and Wilds was dissolved amid considerable acrimony in June 1825, with Busby claiming many buildings as his own. By contrast, Wilds was in partnership with his father from <i>c</i>.1806 to 1823.<br>
<br>Kemp Town (plans exh. RA, 1825) is an exceptional piece of urban planning: a self-sufficient community of 250 socially graded houses with amenities arranged (had all been built) in three squares, a crescent, and fourteen terraces. The enterprise was grandiose and comparable with Nash's Regent's Park. The span of Lewes Crescent is 200 feet wider than the Royal Crescent, Bath. Architecturally, as well as financially, however, Kemp Town was not a success. The architects were allowed no part in the building, while lengthy delays compromised their design. Mediocre fa&ccedil;ades failed to discipline the provocative width of Lewes Crescent and unify the whole. Kemp Town underwhelms. On a similar scale, Busby repeated this vision in Brunswick Town, Hove (plans exh. RA, 1825). Designed in 1824, it is said to have been Busby's own brainchild and, in contrast to the lack of organization in Kemp Town, Brunswick surged ahead under Busby as architect, builder, and manager. Until at least the devising of the ground-plan, however, Wilds was still a full partner; he withdrew the very day the building agreement was signed in November 1824. Whereas Brunswick Terrace and the upper half of Brunswick Square surely bear the incisive flourish of Busby's talent, the mannered fa&ccedil;ades lower down the square and the intemperate group numbered 1&#150;6 Brunswick Terrace are too vulgar to be his.<br>
<br>Busby was active in local politics, and served on the Hove vestry and the Brunswick commission. In 1831 he became high commissioner of Hove and helped prepare the local petition in favour of the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>; his Brighton votes in 1832 show him a radical whig. He was also a keen astronomer, and was often seen off the beach in the small paddle-steamer he designed and built. Inventive to the end, he intended the Brunswick houses to have running hot and cold water, and gained Faraday's approval for a steam-driven central heating system (patented 1832). During the later 1820s Busby overstretched himself. Arrested for debt in 1829 and sued in 1832, his nemesis came in February 1833, when he was declared bankrupt, owing &pound;12,644. Through the generosity of friends the debts were soon paid, but Busby was a broken man. He died intestate in his house at 1 Stanhope Place, Hove, on 18 September 1834 and was buried seven days later in St Andrew's churchyard, Hove.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Amon Henry Wilds continued in practice in Brighton, with substantial activity in Gravesend, Kent, in the 1830s. The Brighton houses he built for himself reveal flamboyant &agrave; la mode tastes: the Gothic House, Western Terrace (<i>c</i>.1822&#150;5), was followed by a foray into the oriental style with the Western Pavilion (<i>c</i>.1828). The unexecuted design of a pyramid for his extension to St Nicholas's churchyard (1840&#150;41) and the cast-iron Victoria fountain (1845) demonstrate his delight in the picturesque. At the same time, his use of coade stone, his patented method of cleaning chimneys without climbing boys (1843), and his scheme for a floating Brighton breakwater (<i>c</i>.1843) point to a progressive, utilitarian mind. Wilds's most important works were his sequences of linked villas: Hanover Crescent (1822&#150;7), Montpelier Crescent (1843&#150;7), and Park Crescent (1849&#150;55) in Brighton, and Park Crescent, Worthing (1825&#150;9; exh. RA, 1830). His recreation was archery, and briefly he involved himself in local government, serving in 1845&#150;8 as a Brighton commissioner. He died on 13 July 1857 at his home, Old Shoreham Cottage, Old Shoreham, Sussex.<br>
<br>Rapidly forgotten, much of the Brighton work of Wilds and Busby was under threat of demolition from the 1930s. The researches of Anthony Dale, and the pioneering conservation work of the Regency Society he co-founded, helped to restore their reputations locally, and an exhibition at the RIBA in 1991 reintroduced Busby to a wider public, though perhaps at the expense of allowing him to overshadow Amon Henry Wilds.<br>
