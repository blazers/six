<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Chapman,  Robert William</span>  (1881&#150;1960), <span class="occ">literary scholar and publisher</span>, was born at Eskbank, near Dalkeith, Midlothian, on 5 October 1881, the youngest of the six children of the Revd Edward Whitaker Chapman and his wife, Hannah Margaret Cannon of a Yorkshire family. His father was the Episcopalian vicar of Birnam, Dunkeld, Perthshire, from 1871 to 1877 and secretary and treasurer of the Representative Church Council of the Scottish Episcopal Church, Edinburgh. Upon her husband's death in 1884, Hannah Chapman settled near Dundee. Chapman attended the high school at Dundee, then went with a bursary to St Andrews, where he obtained first class honours in classics. With the Guthrie and Adam de Brome scholarships he proceeded to Oriel College, Oxford, where he won the Gaisford prize for Greek prose (1903) and was awarded a first class in classical moderations (1904) and in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1906).<br>
<br>In 1906 Chapman was appointed assistant secretary to the secretary to the delegates of the Clarendon Press, Charles Cannan. On 22 April 1913 he married Katharine Marion (1887/8&#150;1978), daughter of Arthur Wharton Metcalfe, a Somerset engineer. After obtaining a first class in the honour school of English language and literature (1910) she had moved from Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, to Somerville College as assistant English tutor. They had three sons and one daughter. On the outbreak of the First World War he was given a commission in the Royal Garrison Artillery and served in Salonika. After he returned to Oxford he succeeded to the secretaryship in January 1920, after Cannan's death. He followed Cannan's <span class="italic">Catalogue of the Oxford University Press</span> (1916) with the complementary <span class="italic">Account of the Oxford University Press, 1468&#150;1921</span> (1922; 2nd edn, 1926) in which he described the more important books published by the press, some in progress, in which he had a share, especially the <span class="roman">Oxford English Texts</span> and the first edition of the <span class="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</span> (1928) and its supplement (1933), to which he freely contributed. His early interest in lexicography, which was also shown in his contributions to the revised edition of Liddell and Scott's <span class="italic">Greek-English Lexicon</span> (1940; rev. edn, 1996), remained throughout his life.<br>
<br>When on active service Chapman wrote a series of essays, collected as <span class="italic">Portrait of a Scholar</span> (1920), among them &#145;The textual criticism of English classics&#146;, which contains the injunction &#145;To restore, and maintain in its integrity the text of our great writers is a pious duty&#146;; this duty he observed throughout his scholarly life and he demanded its observance by others in editions promoted or controlled by him. The English authors he loved and studied most were Jane Austen and Samuel Johnson and his reputation rests on his editions of their works. As early as 1912 he had planned with Katharine Marion Metcalfe an edition of Jane Austen's novels and this was completed by himself, with her assistance, in five volumes in 1923. This edition was judiciously annotated and accompanied by numerous appendixes of great importance. It was followed by six volumes of juvenilia and minor works and two editions of letters, <span class="italic">The Five Letters of Jane Austen to her Niece</span> (1924) and <span class="italic">Jane Austen's Letters to her Sister Cassandra and Others</span> (2 vols., 1932). Chapman completed his work on Jane Austen with his edition of J. E. Austen-Leigh's <span class="italic">Memoir</span> (1926), <span class="italic">Jane Austen: Facts and Problems</span>, the Clark lectures given in 1948 at Trinity College, Cambridge, and <span class="italic">Jane Austen: a Critical Bibliography</span> (1953; corrected edn, 1955).<br>
<br>Very early in his career Chapman laid the foundations of his belief that Samuel Johnson was one of the first writers of modern times and one of the greatest of Englishmen. He read and studied in Macedonia Boswell's <span class="italic">Life of Johnson</span> and began there an edition of Boswell's <span class="italic">Tour to the Hebrides</span> and Johnson's <span class="italic">Journey to the Western Islands</span> which were published together in 1924 in an edition in which the texts were, for the first time, established by scholarly collation and emendation. Chapman had already come to the conclusion that Boswell's <span class="italic">Life</span> and Johnson's <span class="italic">Letters</span> were in need of radical revision; the great edition of Boswell's <span class="italic">Life</span> and <span class="italic">Tour to the Hebrides</span> (1887) was found on examination to be textually inaccurate and factually inadequate. Lawrence Fitzroy Powell was commissioned to undertake the revision: Chapman, in addition to reading the proofs, assisted materially by editing Boswell's <span class="italic">Note Book, 1776&#150;77</span> (1925), <span class="italic">Johnson and Boswell Revised by themselves and Others</span> (1928), and <span class="italic">Papers Written by Dr. Johnson and Dr. Dodd, 1777</span> (1926). Chapman himself undertook the new edition of the letters, making diligent and successful efforts to obtain new letters. His prime aim was to furnish an accurate text and therefore he made a close study of Johnson's difficult handwriting. The resultant edition, <span class="italic">The Letters of Samuel Johnson with Mrs. Thrale's Genuine Letters to Him</span>, was fully indexed and published in three volumes in 1952 and is Chapman's greatest contribution to Johnsonian scholarship. In <span class="italic">Johnson, Boswell and Mrs. Piozzi: a Suppressed Passage Restored</span> (1929) Chapman exposed Piozzi's editorial malpractices. He also produced in 1927 an edition of <span class="italic">Rasselas</span>.<br>
<br>Chapman was well aware of the need for a systematic study of the canon of Johnson's writings. The pioneer <span class="italic">Bibliography</span> by W. P. Courtney, seen through the press by D. Nichol Smith in 1915, was reissued with the support of Chapman in 1925; it added and described numerous facsimiles, but made no addition to the canon. This was done when twenty-two pieces were delineated in <span class="italic">Johnsonian bibliography: a supplement to Courtney</span> by Chapman with the collaboration of Allen T. Hazen and published by the Oxford Bibliographical Society (vol. 5, 1940). Chapman was an ardent bibliographer. He wrote one important book, <span class="italic">Cancels</span> (1930), and many articles on bibliography and kindred subjects such as typography, binding, and the book trade, and contributed to its terminology. He freely shared his knowledge with R. B. McKerrow, whose <span class="italic">Introduction to Bibliography</span>, a standard manual, was published by the Clarendon Press in 1927.<br>
<br>Chapman was taken seriously ill in 1942 and compelled to resign the secretaryship of the press. He retired to Barton near Oxford and devoted himself mainly to the completion of his edition of Johnson's letters. An essayist and reviewer of rare distinction, he had an innate feeling for language and always wrote with gracious learning and wit. As a reviewer he was generally kindly but could be severe when occasion required. His style can be observed in <span class="italic">Johnsonian and other Essays and Reviews</span> (1953), written over the years 1921&#150;49. The reprint of the <span class="roman">Oxford Standard Authors</span> edition of Boswell's <span class="italic">Life of Johnson</span> (1953) was not edited by him, but he added very greatly to its value and importance by supplying translations of the numerous Latin and Greek quotations. The last work to be edited by him was an anthology, <span class="italic">Selections from Samuel Johnson</span> (1955).<br>
<br>In person Chapman was tall and lean, with a distinct stoop when walking, and he was a tireless walker. He never rode a horse, drove a car, or rode a motorcycle, but was seldom parted from his bicycle clips; his bicycle was famous and he indicated to other road users with unmistakable elaboration the way he intended to go. He never used a typewriter or wrote with a fountain pen. He wrote rapidly: what he wrote was not always legible, even to his secretaries, his close friends, or the printer; on one occasion at least it caused serious error. But if his writing was sometimes a torment, his voice was always a joy. He deplored slovenly speech; his own was clear, with every syllable distinctly and naturally uttered; it bore no trace of his northern origin. In addition to a small but notable collection of books, he collected silver spoons, and, as a minor hobby, abbreviations. He had in 1910 collaborated with his friend George Gordon in collecting examples of modern jargon which were pilloried in the <span class="italic">Oxford Magazine</span>. His tracts for the Society of Pure English, <span class="italic">Names, Designations and Appellations</span> (1936) and <span class="italic">Adjectives from Proper Names</span> (1939), could only have been compiled from hundreds of examples collected over a period of years. He was aided by a very good memory.<br>
<br>The honorary degree of DLitt was conferred on Chapman by Oxford in 1928 for his part in the production of the <span class="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</span> and St Andrews made him an honorary LLD in 1933; he was elected a fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1931, and FBA in 1949, and was appointed CBE in 1955. Chapman died at Cowley Road Hospital, Oxford, on 20 April 1960.<br>
