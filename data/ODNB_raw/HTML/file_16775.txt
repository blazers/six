<span class="headword">Litlyngton <span class="st"> [Litlington]</span>,  Nicholas</span>  (<em>b. </em>before 1315, <em>d.</em> 1386), <span class="occ">abbot of Westminster</span>, claimed to be a member of the Despenser family, a claim corroborated by his familiarity with Bishop Henry Despenser of Norwich (<i>d</i>. 1406), who ate three times at his table in the period October 1371 &#150; July 1372, and with Sir Edward Despenser (<i>d</i>. 1375), for whom he was attorney during the latter's absence in France in 1373&#150;4, and from whom he received a legacy of a gilt hanaper in 1375. His parents, for whom he founded anniversaries at Hurley Priory and Great Malvern Priory, were named Hugh and Joan. They cannot now be further identified, but their marriage can probably be inferred from the fact that Litlyngton used the Despenser arms without any mark of illegitimacy. The toponym by which he was known in the monastery may derive from Littleton, or Litlyngton, Middlesex, where the abbey purchased land, as part of Billets manor, during his abbacy.<br>
<br>Litlyngton entered the monastery in or, quite possibly, before 1333. Aristocratic recruits were rare at Westminster, but high birth did not speed his progress through the monastic <i>cursus honorum</i>. Although he had already served the monastery in external affairs at important junctures, he was twice passed over for the priorship in 1349, and became prior only when the office again fell vacant in 1350. The convent was perhaps wary of the pride of family that would inspire Litlyngton, when abbot, to place his monogram&#151;the initials N. L., surmounted by a coronet&#151;on sets of plate given by him to the refectory and misericord, and to acquiesce in, if he did not initiate, the use of this device and the Despenser arms on bosses in the cloister, on tiles on the refectory floor, and in other strategic places.<br>
<br>Yet Litlyngton was no blinkered snob in monk's clothing, but a competent and energetic man of business who, after he became abbot in 1362, completed the rehabilitation of the monastery begun by his predecessor, Simon Langham, following the crushing blow delivered to its numbers and income by the black death of 1348&#150;9. Langham, who became successively bishop of Ely and archbishop of Canterbury, maintained a stream of benefactions to the abbey until his death in 1376, and enabled Litlyngton, who enjoyed his confidence and was an executor of his will, to spend on a large scale. The rebuilding of the cloister, long in hand, was completed; work on the nave of the abbey church resumed after the lapse of a century; and new quarters, including a new infirmary, provided for some major departments. Litlyngton himself contributed to these works on a relatively generous scale. What the prior and convent long remembered, however, was his failure to pay them for lead from the old nave which was used to roof the abbot's new house in the precinct; this was built in the 1370s. Even so, he spent about &pound;450 on this house from abbatial funds and also paid for the new house which he had built earlier, in the 1360s, at Denham, Buckinghamshire. If the new buildings served to glorify the abbot, they also raised the morale of his monks and probably assisted the recruitment of novices. The total number of monks climbed into the mid-forties&#151;a remarkable achievement, since the number before the black death had probably not exceeded fifty. The missal, now known as the Litlyngton missal, that he gave to the high altar, and in which his monogram and arms are frequently displayed, was produced in the monastery in 1383/4 at a total cost to Litlyngton of &pound;34 4<i>s</i>. 7<i>d</i>. The scribe, Thomas Preston, subsequently entered the community as a monk. The illumination was the work of two artists, now unknown.<br>
<br>Litlyngton itinerated less extensively than most of his predecessors. He normally attended parliament if it met at Westminster, and when he did so was named as a trier of petitions. In October 1378, however, in the tense aftermath of the murder of Robert Hawley in Westminster Abbey, he attended parliament at Gloucester, to answer the council's charge that in admitting Hawley, a debtor and alleged traitor, to sanctuary he had obstructed royal justice. Outwitting his opponents, Litlyngton took the initiative in addressing the Commons in defence of the abbey's liberties before they heard John Wyclif, who had been summoned by the council to speak against them. Writing about fifty years later, John Flete praises Litlyngton's zeal for the interests of the monastery both in this controversy, and in the long-running dispute with the dean and canons of St Stephen's Chapel, Westminster, over jurisdiction in the Palace of Westminster. In the late summer of 1386 the threat of a French invasion enabled Litlyngton to demonstrate a different kind of patriotism, and he and two other senior monks equipped themselves for service against the French, should they invade. The hauberks, cuirass, and other items of military equipment found among his chattels at his death, and given by his executors to his successor, William Colchester, were presumably purchased on this occasion. However, the bows and arrows mentioned in the same list had probably been used on hunting parties, for Litlyngton kept hounds.<br>
<br>Unusual, perhaps, in his martial zeal, Litlyngton was in many other respects the epitome of the successful Benedictine prelate in late medieval England: unembarrassed by wealth and a largely secularized mode of life, a good man of business, a great builder, and courageous in defence of monastic privilege. He died at La Neyte, his house in present-day Pimlico, on 29 November 1386 and was buried on 17 December in the chapel of St Blaise in the abbey church.<br>
