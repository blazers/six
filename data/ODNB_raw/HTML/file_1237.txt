<span class="headword">Ballard,  John Archibald</span>  (1829&#150;1880), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Portbury, Somerset, on 20 June 1829, the son of George and Eliza Ballard of Portbury. He was educated at the East India Company's military college, Addiscombe, near Croydon, 1847&#150;8, and in 1850 was commissioned into the Bengal Engineers. In the spring of 1854 he went on sick leave.<br>
<br>Attracted by news from the Danubian provinces, Ballard travelled to Bulgaria. At Omar Pasha's camp at Shumla, Omar invested him with the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the Turkish army, and deputed him to Silistria as a member of the council of war in that fortress, then besieged by the Russians. Before Ballard's arrival, on 13 June, two other British officers, Captain Butler of the Ceylon Rifles and Lieutenant Nasmyth of the Bombay artillery, had been aiding the garrison, but Butler had been killed and Nasmyth was called away to Omar's camp a few days after Ballard's arrival. During the remainder of the siege, which was raised by the Russians on 23 June, Ballard was the only British officer in the fortress, and it was mainly owing to his exertions, and his influence over the garrison, that the defence was successfully maintained.<br>
<br>At the attack and capture of the Russian position at Giurgevo, Ballard commanded the skirmishers and kept back the enemy until the Turks could entrench themselves. He received the thanks of the British government and, from the Turkish government, a gold medal and a sword of honour.<br>
<br>After serving with the Turkish troops at Eupatoria and in the expedition to Kerch, Ballard commanded a brigade in Omar Pasha's Transcaucasian campaign for the relief of Kars. At the battle of the Inguri River, Ballard and his brigade were for several hours hotly engaged with the Russians, and he was again notable for his coolness under fire. He was also concerned for the well-being of his troops.<br>
<br>Ballard returned to India in 1856, still a subaltern of engineers, but with the CB and order of the Mejidiye. He served as assistant quartermaster-general in the Persian campaign, and afterwards in the Indian mutiny with the Rajputana field force, taking part in the pursuit and rout of Tantia Topi's forces. His promotion was singularly rapid, advancing in 1858 from lieutenant to lieutenant-colonel. He was subsequently mint-master at Bombay. Having attained the rank of lieutenant-general, he retired in 1879. He received an Edinburgh honorary LLD in 1868. He married a daughter of Robert Scott-Moncrieff of Fossaway, Perth; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50221/', "Admiral George Alexander Ballard (1862&#150;1948)")</script> was their son. Ballard died suddenly on 2 April 1880 near Livadia, in Greece, when visiting the pass of Thermopylae.<br>
