<span class="headword">Nissen,  Peter Norman</span>  (1871&#150;1930), <span class="occ">mining engineer and inventor of the Nissen hut</span>, was born on 6 August 1871 in New York, the second of the three children of Georg Hermann Nissen (1832&#150;1913), a Norwegian mining engineer, and his wife, Annie Lavinia (1842&#150;<i>c</i>.1930), daughter of Elisha Fitch of Nova Scotia. His education at Trinity College, Trinity, North Carolina (1887&#150;8 and 1890&#150;91), and at Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario (1896&#150;7), both of which he left without taking a degree, was interrupted by long periods working at goldmines in the USA and Canada where crushed ore was fed to stamp mills for finer crushing. Georg Nissen suggested improvements in which heavier stamps would be used and each stamp would have its own mortar, unlike the conventional mill where five stamps crushed ore in one mortar. Peter Nissen, having failed to sell the Nissen stamp mill in the United States, redesigned it and introduced it to the Witwatersrand of Transvaal. The Nissen stamp mill proved its superiority over the conventional mill during the period June to September 1911 in Johannesburg. Sales continued until 1926 when it was superseded by the tube mill.<br>
<br>In 1915 Nissen was in France as a temporary lieutenant in the Royal Engineers. In reply to a pressing need for behind the lines accommodation he submitted a design for a semicircular hut similar in principle to the indoor ice hockey sheds of Ontario. For the remainder of the First World War he was settled at Hesdin, in the Pas-de-Calais, where he organized the production of Nissen huts from components made in England which were then shipped to France and Belgium. About 100,000 of the smaller bow huts were assembled, each housing twenty-four men; also 10,000 of the larger hospital huts, each accommodating twenty-four patients. Nissen was awarded the DSO and the order of St Sava of Serbia. He left the British army with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. Immediately after the war he established Nissen Buildings Ltd, which produced Nissen hut type buildings for industry and housing on a site at Rye House, Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire. A Nissen house in Yeovil, Somerset, was listed by the Department of the Environment as an important example of a cost-cutting design for cheap housing. Nissen was thus a pioneer of the mass production of prefabricated huts and houses.<br>
<br>Naturalized as a British subject in 1921, Nissen moved to Deepdale, Westerham Hill, Westerham, Kent, in 1922. On 2 January 1900 he had married Louisa Mair Richmond (1873&#150;1923); they had one daughter. He married Lauretta Maitland (1882&#150;1954) on 4 May 1924; there were two sons. Nissen died of pneumonia at his home on 2 March 1930 and was buried three days later at St Mary the Virgin, Westerham.<br>
