<span class="headword">White,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1813), <span class="occ">astrologer</span>, was the author of <span class="italic">The Beauties of Occult Science Investigated, or, The Celestial Intelligencer</span> (1810), published in London and Bath, where he may have lived. Little else is known of his life. One of the relatively rare textbooks of astrology published in this period, <span class="italic">The Beauties</span> was reprinted in 1811. <span class="italic">A Set of Astronomical Tables</span> for 1780&#150;83 also appeared, in 1811. The title of White's main work assumes that judicial astrology is the essence of occult science. Although strongly criticized by one of the few other astrologers then in print, John Worsdale, it was a reasonably comprehensive introduction to that subject which, together with an ephemeris, would have enabled its practice. It shows signs of the continuing ascendancy of natural philosophy, defining astrology as &#145;the effects derived from the amazing powers of mutual attraction of the different parts and masses (great or small) of matter&#146;  (White, 9).<br>
<br>White is chiefly remembered, however, for his end. In 1813 he was living and working as an astrologer in the Isle of Wight. He was approached by a police informer posing as a client, who asked for and received a reading of his nativity, and paid with marked money. White was then arrested and charged under the <span class="roman">Vagrancy Act</span> for &#145;pretending and professing to tell Fortunes&#146;. He was convicted, and his books and papers seized. He died in 1813 after three months in Winchester gaol. This use of the act against non-vagrant astrologers alarmed many of them. It seems to have set a precedent, and such prosecutions continued sporadically until 1917; the clause was quietly repealed after examination by parliamentary committee in 1989.<br>
