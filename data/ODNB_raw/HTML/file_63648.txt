<span class="headword">Raffalovich,  Marc-Andr&eacute;</span>  (1864&#150;1934), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born in Paris on 11 September 1864, the third child of Hermann Raffalovich (<i>d</i>. 1893), a prosperous banker, and his wife, Marie (<i>d</i>. 1921). His parents were Jews who migrated from Odessa to Paris in 1863: his mother was a cultivated hostess who presided over a salon at 19 avenue Hoche. Andr&eacute; Raffalovich, as he was usually known, had an elder brother, Arthur, who became a diplomat and economist in France; their sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55178/', "Sophie O'Brien")</script>, married William O'Brien, the Irish nationalist politician. After Raffalovich turned eighteen, in 1882, his parents sent him to London with the intention that he should prepare for entrance to an English university. Instead he lived the life of a precocious and privileged amateur. During the 1880s, with the hope of establishing a literary salon at his home in South Audley Street, he sought out Stevenson, Pater, Swinburne, Browning, and Meredith. Later, in the 1890s, he was a tactful and generous benefactor to Aubrey Beardsley in his final illness; his association with Oscar Wilde was, however, mistrustful and mutually ambivalent. In January 1891 he was naturalized as a British subject.<br>
<br>Raffalovich published five volumes of poetry: <span class="italic">Cyril and Lionel</span> (1884), <span class="italic">Tuberose and Meadowsweet</span> (1885), <span class="italic">In Fancy Dress</span> (1886), <span class="italic">It is Thyself</span> (1889), and <span class="italic">The Thread and the Path</span> (1895). He also wrote two novels, <span class="italic">A Willing Exile</span> (1890) and <span class="italic">Self Seekers</span> (1897). After composing two early dramatic sketches, <span class="italic">Roses of Shadow</span> and <span class="italic">Black Sheep</span>, performed in 1893 and 1894, he collaborated with his lover, J. H. Gray, in writing <span class="italic">The Blackmailers</span>, which (despite the discretion with which it alluded to male homosexuality) had only one matin&eacute;e performance at the Prince of Wales's Theatre in 1895. These works were neither distinctive nor futile, but Raffalovich's most significant literary efforts were the articles on sexual inversion which he contributed in the mid-1890s to <span class="italic">Archives d'Anthropologie Criminelle</span> and two cognate monographs. After the Wilde trials Raffalovich published <span class="italic">L'affaire Oscar Wilde</span> (1895) and <span class="italic">Uranisme et unisexualit&eacute;</span> (1896). Both works were written in French and published in Paris: they would have been condemned, if not criminally prosecuted, in Britain. His discussions of male homosexuality were conscientious and well intended, but despite his good insights and wish for fair treatment of a reviled minority they contain pejorative phrases and oppressive sentiments. Whether these passages reflected Raffalovich's beliefs, or were forced on him by prevalent notions of respectability, is unclear.<br>
<br>Around 1893 Raffalovich began a loving, lifelong relationship with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/60499/', "John Henry Gray (1866&#150;1934)")</script>. It was by Gray's influence that in 1896 Raffalovich was received into the Catholic church by the Jesuit fathers of Mayfair, and assumed the saint's name of Sebastian: he was thereafter known as Andr&eacute;-Sebastian, or Andr&eacute;-Sebastien, Raffalovich. After Gray's resignation from the Foreign Office library in 1898 Raffalovich paid for him to study for the priesthood in Rome. When, in 1907, Gray was subsequently appointed to the parish of St Peter, Morningside, Raffalovich moved to Edinburgh to be near him. Their companionate relationship, with its deep mutual devotion and dependence, endured for the rest of their lives. Raffalovich helped to finance the building of several Catholic churches and chapels, notably St Peter's. Apart from a few pseudonymous contributions to the Dominican monthly <span class="italic">Blackfriars</span>, Raffalovich stopped writing. He preferred to devote himself to good works and to cultivate his gift for friendship. His Edinburgh household was known to a small, fortunate circle for its pleasant hospitability and literate conversation.<br>
<br>Raffalovich died in his sleep on 14 February 1934 at his home, 9 Whitehouse Terrace, Edinburgh, and was buried in Mount Vernon cemetery, Edinburgh (where Canon Gray was buried four months later).<br>
