<span class="headword">Balleny,  John</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1770, <em>d.</em> in or after 1842), <span class="occ">merchant navy officer and Antarctic discoverer</span>, was born <i>c</i>.1770 but nothing is known about his early life and education. He may have been a Londoner, brought up in the Newcastle coal trade. From 1798, when he was living in the parish of St George-in-the-East, London, he is occasionally recorded in the coasting, home, and foreign trades as master of various vessels.<br>
<br>In 1838 Messrs C., H., and G. Enderby, of London, managing owners for a joint venture, sent the schooner <i>Eliza Scott</i> and the cutter <i>Sabrina</i> on a commercial voyage of discovery, hoping to find new lands and sealing grounds. At the last moment Balleny was brought out of retirement and appointed master of the <i>Eliza Scott</i>, which was not a good sea boat. Some scientific instruments were lent by the hydrographer John Washington for the making of barometrical observations. Balleny sailed from the Thames on 14 July 1838, sighted Amsterdam Island, and reached Chalky Bay, New Zealand, on 3 December. At Campbell Island on 7 January 1839 he met John Biscoe, who was on a similar search for land in the Antarctic.<br>
<br>At 11.30 a.m. on 9 February 1839, north of the Ross Sea, Balleny sighted land in lat. 66&#150;7&deg; S, long. 162&#150;3&deg; E. This was a group of five islands, which he called the Balleny Islands. Captain Freeman of the <i>Sabrina</i> landed briefly, but there was no suitable place for a party to land and explore further. The striking point was Balleny's accuracy in navigation, for after days of dead reckoning, his latitude and longitude were in error by no more than 5 miles, despite difficulties of navigation in those waters: this suggests that he was an experienced sailor.<br>
<br>Sailing westwards, on 2 March 1839, in lat. 64&deg;58' S, long. 121&deg;08'&#150;122&deg;44 E, Balleny charted &#145;Sabrina Land&#146;, which does not in fact exist. He may have seen the continental ice cap, raised by mirage. The <i>Sabrina</i> was lost on 24 or 25 March 1839 but Balleny returned to Britain on 18 September, just as Captain James Clark Ross was leaving for Antarctic exploration. Balleny gave Ross a copy of his chart and extracts from his logbook. When Ross reached that area, he charted the islands as a separate group, the Russell Islands. Balleny's barometrical observations had had to be abandoned after difficulties with instruments. Neither was the voyage a commercial success. Profits from the sealskins he brought back covered no more than a fraction of the expedition's cost, although it seems likely that Charles Enderby, a keen geographer and the main organizer of the venture, never envisaged that it would bring commercial gain. However, its geographical results were notable. A report of Balleny's voyage was made to the Royal Geographical Society by Charles Enderby in 1839 and published in the society's journal in the same year.<br>
<br>In 1840&#150;41 Balleny was master of the new barque <i>Taglioni</i> on its voyage to Calcutta, and in 1842 to Australia. He seems to have died about this date, for there is no further record of him.<br>
