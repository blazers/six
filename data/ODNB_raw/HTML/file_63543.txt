<span class="headword">Gent, Sir  (Gerard) Edward James</span>  (1895&#150;1948), <span class="occ">civil servant and colonial governor</span>, was born at 8 Crescent Road, Kingston upon Thames, on 28 October 1895, the fourth and youngest son (there were also two daughters) of John Gent (1844&#150;1927), barrister and later county court judge, and his wife, Harriet Frankland, daughter of Edward Randall, of Loders, Dorset. Gerard (he preferred his second name, Edward, on being knighted in 1946) attended Gate House School in Surbiton before proceeding in 1909 to King's School, Canterbury, where he was an outstanding all-rounder. He captained rugby and cricket, was cadet officer in the officers' training corps, and in 1914 won the Ford studentship at Trinity College, Oxford, but deferred entry on account of the outbreak of the First World War. All four Gent brothers fought in the war and one, Thomas, died in action. Gent himself enlisted with the Duke of Cornwall's light infantry on 5 August 1914 and served in Flanders and briefly in Italy. He was wounded twice, gassed once, mentioned in dispatches twice, decorated for valour (winning the MC and DSO), and commanded a regular battalion by the time he was demobilized in 1919.<br>
<br>On his return to civilian life Gent initially took up his place at Oxford but left after a year to enter the Colonial Office as an assistant principal. Once established in the civil service, he married Guendolen Mary Wyeth at St Paul's, Kingston Hill, on 5 April 1923. The daughter of James Napoleon Wyeth, she was also aged twenty-seven at the time of their marriage. They settled in Esher where they brought up a family of two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Gent's contemporaries in the Colonial Office included Gerald Creasy, Charles Jefferies, and Thomas Lloyd. During the next twenty years they rose more or less together, participating in an administrative revolution that reached a climax in the 1940s. Gent contributed to these changes as secretary to major committees and conferences: the Stevenson committee on the restriction of world rubber prices (1922); Leo Amery's Colonial Office conference (1927); the committee on Colonial Office organization chaired by Sir Samuel Wilson, the permanent under-secretary (1927&#150;8); and Sir Warren Fisher's review of the colonial service, which reformed the appointments process (1929&#150;30). He also served as private secretary to the parliamentary under-secretary, W. G. Ormsby-Gore, in 1924&#150;6. He spent much of the 1930s in the Far Eastern (later Eastern) department and was its head from 1939 to 1942. He was seconded to the first Indian round table conference (November 1930&#150;January 1931) and accompanied Sir Samuel Wilson on a tour of Malaya, Ceylon, and Hong Kong (October 1932&#150;February 1933). As he encountered, albeit at arm's length, political agitation, economic depression, and communal tension in Asian dependencies, he grew impatient with hidebound attitudes and archaic regimes, and, notwithstanding his retiring disposition, pressed for progressive and, above all, efficient policies. His appetite for work and incisive approach to colonial issues brought recognition and ensured advancement. He was appointed OBE in 1935 and CMG in 1941, and was promoted to principal (1927), assistant secretary (1939), and assistant under-secretary (1942).<br>
<br>As assistant under-secretary, Gent held one of the most demanding positions within the Colonial Office. He was responsible for several departments and was preoccupied with military defeat and post-war reconstruction in the Far East. The fall of Singapore had increased Ceylon's value as a naval base and source of raw materials; it also heightened the demands of local politicians. The island's wartime importance worked to the nationalists' advantage and Gent played a key role in deliberations leading to the Soulbury commission (1944&#150;5), which recommended self-government short of dominion status. As regards the future of the lost lands of south-east Asia, Gent resisted subservience to &#145;the supposed American policy of preventing the restoration of British sovereignty&#146;  (Stockwell, <span class="italic">British Documents</span>, doc. 3), and advised his secretary of state to prepare for the re-establishment of British rule on lines that would forward economic rehabilitation, nation-building, and regional co-ordination. In 1943&#150;5 crown colony government was designed for North Borneo and Sarawak (in place of the chartered company and the Brooke regimes) and a scheme was devised for the union of Malaya in which the autonomy of the sultans would be curtailed and citizenship opened to non-Malays. Although Sir Arthur Richards had at one time been identified for the governorship of the Malayan Union, in November 1945 the secretary of state informed Attlee that Gent was &#145;the best available candidate&#146; because he had been &#145;responsible for all the planning for our re-entry into the Far Eastern Colonies&#146;  (TNA:PRO, CO 850/206/8). He was fifty and it was his first overseas appointment. He was knighted KCMG in 1946.<br>
<br>The post-war British military administration in Malaya gave way to colonial rule on 1 April 1946, but the Malay rulers boycotted Gent's installation. In addition, Dato Onn bin Jaafar mobilized an unprecedented mass movement in opposition to the new constitution. While Malays regarded it as an attack on their birthright, non-Malays were slow to welcome its inclusive provisions. Notwithstanding his commitment to the Malayan Union, Gent immediately accepted the need to compromise. Months of arduous negotiations resulted in the Federation of Malaya, inaugurated on 1 February 1948 with Gent as high commissioner. Although the climbdown did Gent's reputation little harm in London, his authority never recovered in Malaya, where Malays remained suspicious of him and Europeans resented his Whitehall manner and liberal imperialism. No sooner had the Malayan Union crisis been resolved than labour unrest and rural violence, fomented by the Chinese-dominated Malayan Communist Party, came to a head. An increasingly isolated figure, Gent appeared to dither, and his decision to declare a state of emergency in mid-June 1948 came too late to save his career. On the advice of Malcolm MacDonald (commissioner-general in south-east Asia) he was recalled, but, as his aircraft approached Northolt on 4 July, it collided with another. All thirty-nine people on board the two aircraft were killed.<br>
<br>Had he lived, Gent would have put his case before the secretary of state. As it was, a gifted and gallant public servant became the scapegoat for British set-backs in a Malaya turned upside down by the war. Gent's widow maintained links with Malaya, serving as a governor of Malaya Hall (the students' base in London) and attending the independence celebrations in 1957. Their elder son, Mark, joined Guthries and was chairman of its Malaysian subsidiary in the 1970s.<br>
