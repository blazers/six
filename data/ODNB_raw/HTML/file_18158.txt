<span class="headword">Marshall,  William</span>  (1807&#150;1880), <span class="occ">minister of the United Presbyterian church</span>, was born in the hamlet of Meadowmore, Perthshire, early in 1807. He was educated at the village school at Tullybelton and at a superior school in Perth, where he attended a single session. In 1820 he went on to Glasgow University for two years, spending a further two years at Edinburgh University. He entered the Divinity Hall of the United Secession church in Glasgow in 1824, where he studied under Professor John Dick. In 1829 he was licensed, and in December of the following year was ordained to the church at Coupar Angus in Perthshire, where he was to remain for almost fifty years.<br>
<br>Marshall took a prominent role in the &#145;voluntary&#146; controversy, a national debate sparked off by a sermon by Andrew Marshall in 1829 which argued the case against ecclesiastical establishments. He edited a monthly magazine, <span class="italic">The Dissenter</span>, in 1833 and also became secretary of the Voluntary Church Association. He was the public champion of other causes in concert with his colleague, Dr David King, particularly in anti-slavery agitation and opposition to the corn laws. His views were so outspoken that <span class="italic">The Times</span> called attention to one speech in 1842 on the latter topic, suggesting that the lord advocate might prosecute him for sedition.<br>
<br>Marshall was a keen supporter of the union between the Relief and United Secession churches, which came about in 1847. He was also well-disposed towards the abortive union negotiations between the United Presbyterian and Free churches. In 1865 he was moderator of the United Presbyterian synod and in that same year was honoured with the degree of DD from both the University of New York and the Presbyterian College of Hamilton, Canada. In 1872 he was presented with &pound;1500 collected by his friends. By this time he was ailing, and a colleague was appointed to assist with the church while Marshall devoted more time to writings of a local historical nature. He did, however, consent to preach at Dysart, and it was while he was on this visit that he was taken ill. He died at the United Presbyterian manse there on 23 August 1880, and was buried at Coupar Angus.<br>
<br>Much may be deduced about a man's character on the basis of the charges from which he is defended. In his funeral sermon Dr David Young rejected the view that Marshall had been sour, narrow, bigoted, or tending to contention for contention's sake. He contrasted this view with the enlightened causes, such as anti-slavery, missions, and church union, which Marshall had espoused. However, his praise was highly qualified, and even the denomination's own historian acknowledged that &#145;for much of the awe he inspired as a debater he owed more to the roughness of the weapon than either to the strength or the skill of the arm that wielded it&#146;  (Small, 2.569).<br>
