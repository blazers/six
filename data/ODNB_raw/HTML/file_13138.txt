<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Heton,  Martin</span>  (1554&#150;1609), <span class="occ">bishop of Ely</span>, was born in the London parish of St Dionis Backchurch and baptized there on 10 March 1554, the youngest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68277/', "George Heton (b. c.1515, d. in or after 1598)")</script>, merchant, and his second wife, Joan (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Bowes, formerly Roocke). That his mother was buried there ten days later lends credence to the statement on his memorial inscription in Ely Cathedral, composed by his chancellor William Gager, that, dying in childbirth, she had dedicated him to the service of God and the protestant cause (&#145;Deo &amp; ecclesiae reformatae&#146;). In other respects, however, Gager's inscription has proved misleading, above all in twice misstating the bishop's age, giving it as thirty-six in 1589 and fifty-seven at his death. All former accounts have therefore assumed that he was born in 1552.<br>
<br>Educated at Westminster School, Heton matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1571. He graduated BA on 17 December 1574 and proceeded MA on 2 May 1578, meanwhile winning a reputation as an able and subtle disputant in philosophy and afterwards in theology. Granted letters patent in 1580 for the next vacant stall in Christ Church, he was instituted canon of the seventh prebend on 2 December 1582. He proceeded BD on 6 July 1584, was nominated vice-chancellor of Oxford on 16 July 1588, and in February 1589, not yet thirty-five years old, succeeded Laurence Humphrey as dean of Winchester. Instituted by Bishop Thomas Cooper on the crown's presentation, Heton owed his promotion to Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex, who at his majority in 1588 began an assiduous courtship of the London godly community and their families.<br>
<br>Heton commenced DD on 6 July 1589, and when Elizabeth visited Oxford in 1592 he was one of those who preached before her at Christ Church. Present at convocation on 16 March 1593, he was one of the deans of the formerly monastic cathedral chapters who petitioned for confirmation of their grants. In August 1596 Essex perhaps considered urging Heton's claims as dean of Westminster if Gabriel Goodman were to be elevated to the bench of bishops.<br>
<br>After the death on 20 September following of William Day, bishop of Winchester, fifteen Hampshire gentlemen petitioned Essex to support Heton's candidacy as his successor. Respectfully thanking Essex for securing him the deanery, they praised his preaching, his hospitality and the &#145;wise direction&#146; of his life. No predecessor's &#145;severity&#146; had been as effective in promoting religion  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 14.11). In the event Essex supported Thomas Bilson, the successful candidate, and it must be doubted whether Elizabeth would have considered conferring so senior a bishopric on a man of only forty-two.<br>
<br>On 3 February 1600, however, Heton was consecrated bishop of Ely, vacant since the death of Richard Cox in 1581. The promotion had been recently refused by Lancelot Andrewes, who declined to alienate episcopal estates as the price of his elevation. Sir John Harington, a courtier who was in a position to know, believed that Heton was &#145;compelled in a sort to take the bishoprick on these terms&#146;  (Harington, 2.111), but Thomas Fuller later observed that &#145;his memory groaneth under the suspicion of simoniacal compliance&#146;  (Fuller, <span class="italic">Worthies</span>, 2.199).<br>
<br>The truth is more complex. Whilst the lord treasurer, Lord Buckhurst, fully admitted to Robert Cecil that he drove a hard bargain, the negotiations were carried through under the terms of the <span class="roman">Act of Exchange</span> (1559), by which the crown was obliged, during the vacancy of any see, to compensate it with &#145;spiritualities&#146; (impropriate rectories) of equivalent value if it elected to withhold any temporal possessions from the next incumbent. Although Cecil finally achieved his objective by the simpler method of granting Heton all Ely's ancient estates on the understanding that once in office he would convey to the crown those which it wanted&#151;hence Fuller's reference to &#145;simoniacal compliance&#146;&#151;the agreed exchanges did in fact take place and the official valuation of the see remained at &pound;2124 18<i>s</i>. 5<i>d</i>., the figure at which it had been assessed in the <i>valor ecclesiasticus</i> of 1535.<br>
<br>Thus the treasury evidently did not believe that the arrangement would lead to the impoverishment of the diocese, and Buckhurst further agreed to Heton's stipulation that he would enter into bonds to pay first-fruits only on condition that Buckhurst secured him a royal warrant of exoneration. This Heton duly received on 16 May 1600. Elizabeth's stated reasons for waiving her right to more than &pound;1900 in taxes was her usual one: that the new bishop would be &#145;better able to keep good hospitality and serve God and the queen&#146;  (TNA: PRO, E337/12, no. 117). Since Lancelot Andrewes finally accepted the see after Heton's death it would also seem to follow that by 1609 he recognized that Ely's financial resources had not been seriously impaired by the exchanges of ten years earlier.<br>
<br>A successful and popular bishop, Heton was esteemed &#145;inferior to few of his rank for learning and other good parts belonging to a prelate&#146;  (Harington, 2.111). His hospitality, as at Winchester, earned him the reputation of being &#145;the best housekeeper within man's remembrance&#146;  (Fuller, <span class="italic">Worthies</span>, 2.199)&#151;further evidence, perhaps, that the government's original demands on the see had been realistic rather than outrageous. He engaged conscientiously in every aspect of episcopal government and also appeared annually as a judge at assize. He formally visited his diocese in 1601, 1604, and 1607, conducting proceedings himself and preaching regularly. His own generous hospitality was willingly returned. On progress in 1607 he and his retinue dined in the houses of local clergy, his hosts being excused their visitation procuration fees in lieu.<br>
<br>As a disciplinarian Heton evidently showed great tact. He heard sensitive cases in private rather than in consistory, and was sparing in his use of the penalties available to him under canon law. After 1604, when James I reintroduced subscription to Archbishop Whitgift's articles as his badge of inclusion within the established church, Heton seems to have handled the situation with skill: he was obliged to deprive none of his clergy for nonconformity.<br>
<br>James admired Heton, now grown stout, for his eloquence in the pulpit. Whilst &#145;fat men were wont to make lean sermons, his were not lean, but larded with much good learning&#146;  (Harington, 2.111). Although he published none, the sermon preached at Whitehall on 10 April 1603 on the text &#145;Come unto me all ye that labour&#146; is preserved in summary in John Manningham's diary. Heton never lost touch with his roots within the London godly community. One of the (in the event, unneeded) sureties for his episcopal first-fruits was the future Sir Thomas Smith (<i>d</i>. 1625), who became governor of the East India Company, and he contributed &pound;40 towards the purchase of books for Sir Thomas Bodley's newly established library in Oxford. The fathers of both Smith and Bodley had been close associates of his own father and of his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13139/', "Thomas Heton")</script>.<br>
<br>Heton died at Mildenhall, Suffolk, where he had retired for health reasons, on 14 July 1609. His brief and curious will, made four days earlier, contains no formal or religious preamble and no bequests. His funeral was to be conducted &#145;without any pomp or show&#146;. He requested a &#145;convenient tomb&#146;, either in Ely Cathedral or in Downham parish church. That expense discharged, his goods were to be sold and the profits divided into five equal parts, two going to his wife, Alice, and the other three to be equally divided between his daughters Anne and Elizabeth. Alice was named sole executrix, no overseers being appointed  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/115, fol. 225<i>v</i>). Since she was not granted probate until 26 April 1610 it is possible that the document was not accepted until it had been established that no more formal last will and testament existed.<br>
<br>Heton was buried in the south aisle of the presbytery of Ely Cathedral. His life-size alabaster effigy wears a rich cope embroidered with figures of the apostles. As well as William Gager's Latin epitaph there are verses by his nephew George, BD of Cambridge, the son of his brother Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1606), whom in 1600 he had appointed bailiff of the Isle of Ely. Heton's daughter Anne married Sir Robert Filmer (<i>d</i>. 1653) and Elizabeth Sir Edward Fish of Bedfordshire.<br>
