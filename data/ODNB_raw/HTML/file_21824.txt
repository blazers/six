<span class="headword">Pemble,  William</span>  (1591/2&#150;1623), <span class="occ">theologian and author</span>, was born in Kent, possibly at Egerton. The son of a poor clergyman, he studied with John Barker at Mayfield, Sussex, before matriculating at Magdalen College, Oxford, on 18 June 1610, aged eighteen. A student of Richard Capel, who also taught some of John Dod's former pupils, he graduated BA on 3 March 1614 and proceeded MA on 9 June 1618. After receiving his bachelor's degree he became reader and tutor at Magdalen Hall, and, after his ordination, divinity reader. Although he criticized Henry Ainsworth for excessive reliance on the <span class="roman">Talmud</span>, he played an important role in encouraging Hebrew studies. Among the Hebraists he tutored were John Tombes and Edward Leigh, and possibly William Pincke and Thomas Coleman.<br>
<br>All of Pemble's works were published posthumously, mostly through the efforts of Capel. In <span class="italic">Vindiciae fidei</span> (1625), a series of lectures delivered at Magdalen Hall, he expounded the doctrine of justification by Christ's imputed righteousness through the infusion of grace into the souls of the elect. In another series of lectures, <span class="italic">Vindiciae gratiae</span> (1627), he warned against excessive reliance on humane texts in the study of sacred subjects, espoused a supralapsarian view of predestination, contended that justification precedes faith, and averred that sanctifying grace operates without any assistance from its recipients because of their corrupt nature. Capel and George Walker published this book as a refutation of Arminianism. In <span class="italic">Tractatus de providentia Dei</span> (1631) Pemble explained providence as God's action in preserving, governing, and disposing everything, including their intermediate as well as ultimate ends. He called for the frequent observance of the Lord's supper in <span class="italic">An Introduction to the Worthy Receiving the Sacrament</span> (1628), yet warned that participation by the unreformed, the ignorant, and the superstitious was sinful.<br>
<br>Pemble's expository works included <span class="italic">Salomons Recantation and Repentance</span> (1627), a commentary on <span class="roman">Ecclesiastes</span>; <span class="italic">A Short and Sweet Exposition upon the First Nine Chapters of Zachary</span> (1629); and <span class="italic">The Period of the Persian Monarchie</span> (1631), an explanation of enigmatic passages in <span class="roman">Ezra</span>, <span class="roman">Nehemiah</span>, and <span class="roman">Daniel</span>, much of it derived from John Rainolds. He also borrowed extensively from William Gouge for his exposition of <span class="roman">John</span> 5 (1631). With an epistle by John Tombes, a collection of Pemble's pulpit oratory was published in 1628 as <span class="italic">Five Godly, and Profitable Sermons</span> on the subject of the slavery of sin (<span class="roman">John</span> 8: 34), the mischief of ignorance (<span class="roman">Hosea</span> 4: 6), the root of apostasy (<span class="roman">Hebrews</span> 3: 12&#150;13), the benefit of serving God (<span class="roman">Exodus</span> 34: 23&#150;4), and Christian love (<span class="roman">Song of Solomon</span> 2: 16). In <span class="italic">A Fruitfull Sermon</span> on <span class="roman">1 Corinthians</span> 15: 19&#150;20 (1629) he exhorted his audience to suffer for Christ, even to the point of martyrdom if necessary.<br>
<br>Among Pemble's philosophical works is <span class="italic">De formarum origine</span> (1629), which explored the origin of life and the soul, and reflected his interest in Aristotle and knowledge of Hebrew and Greek. He dedicated this work to the Calvinist Accepted Frewen, the future vice-chancellor of Oxford and archbishop of York. As his treatise <span class="italic">De sensibus internis</span> (1629) evinces, his reading extended from classical writings by Aristotle, Plutarch, and Aulus Gellius to the sixteenth-century Italian Aristotelian Jacobus Zabarella. In <span class="italic">A Summe of Morall Philosophy</span> (1630) he examined a wide variety of topics, ranging from ethics, passion, and pleasure to despair, fortitude, and the heroic spirit.<br>
<br>Pemble's <span class="italic">A Briefe Introduction to Geography</span> (1630) was a popular short textbook, which reached a fifth edition in 1675. He relied heavily on Ptolemy and was probably influenced by Bartholomew Keckerman's <span class="italic">System of Geography</span> (1611) or <span class="italic">Compendious System of All Mathematics</span> (1617). Pemble distinguished between topography, which described a small amount of land; chorography, which was concerned with a county or province; and geography, which was global or universal in scope, and which he explained through such traditional means as circles, horizons, and zones. He found the views of Copernicus improbable and irrational, not because they contradicted scriptural teachings but because they were contrary to experience, and in this limited respect he shared some affinity with the new scientists, yet he contributed nothing substantive to the study of geography or philosophy. However, his favourite student, Tombes, tutored John Wilkins, a prominent advocate of the new science.<br>
<br>As his health began to fail, Pemble retired to the house of Capel, who was now rector of Eastington, Gloucestershire. Here he died of a fever&#151;according to Anthony Wood on 14 April 1623, although his will is marked 26 April in the probate register. He was buried in Eastington church's graveyard. Most of his estate went to his siblings Abel, Henry, and Mary Pemble; Abel, of Egerton, Kent, was granted probate on 12 June. Pemble's work attracted attention long after his death, helping to influence Richard Baxter against Arminianism and shape the high-Calvinist tenets of the eighteenth-century Baptists John Gill and John Brine. Baxter and Thomas Blake each cited Pemble in their dispute over the covenants and the role of scripture as an instrument of the Spirit. The Swiss minister Johann Zollikofer (1633&#150;1692) published some of Pemble's work, and Humphrey Chambers thought Pemble and William Ames should not be criticized by name in print. In <span class="italic">The Divine Purity Defended</span> (1657) Thomas Pierce accused Pemble of antinomianism, but John Tombes cited him approvingly in his <span class="italic">Animadversions</span> (1676) against George Bull, and Thomas Danson, in <span class="italic">De causa Dei</span> (1678), accused John Howe of deviating from the true theological tenets of Pemble, Theodore Beza, and William Perkins.<br>
