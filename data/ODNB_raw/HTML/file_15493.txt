<span class="headword">Keugh,  Mathew</span>  (<em>c.</em>1744&#150;1798), <span class="occ">army officer and Irish nationalist</span>, was born in co. Wexford. A loyalist acquaintance, Charles Jackson, claimed that Keugh was a drummer in the 33rd regiment during the American war. More certain is that Keugh rose from the ranks and was gazetted as an ensign in the 60th regiment on 31 October 1763. He was promoted lieutenant in the 45th foot on 14 July 1769 and transferred to the 27th Inniskilling regiment on 14 March 1772. He retired on the half pay of a captain-lieutenant in 1774 and returned to George's Street, Wexford, where his upstanding reputation and protestantism led to his appointment as a commissioner of the peace. He later disappointed conservative associates by supporting campaigns to reform the Irish parliament and for Catholic emancipation. Little is known of his marriage other than that it was childless and that his wife had been widowed. She was Beauchamp Bagenal Harvey's first cousin and the aunt of Sir Jonah Barrington's wife.<br>
<br>Keugh was closely associated with socially prominent republicans such as Harvey and John Henry Colclough, who engaged in political agitation as early as 1791&#150;2. His support of the whig viceroy, Earl Fitzwilliam, probably led to the revocation of his civil commission in 1796 although the authorities were clearly unaware of the strength of his radical convictions. Documents recovered from Keugh's house in June 1798 indicate his knowledge of Wexford's paramilitary leadership from late 1797. Although he was probably not a formally appointed officer, the United Irishmen prized members with military experience and it is very likely that Keugh's advice was sought by leading activists. He dined with high-ranking conspirators at Harvey's home in April 1798 and was one of the guests whose conversation aroused Jonah Barrington's suspicions. His outwardly passive conduct, however, enabled him to evade arrest with the advent of the rising and, crucially, he was not named in the confession extracted from Anthony Perry of Inch on 26 May.<br>
<br>While many of his associates languished in gaol that evening, Keugh busied himself fortifying the county town against a possible rebel attack. Such activity may explain Mrs Brownrigg's claim that Keugh was later denounced, wrongly, as an Orangeman. His stature among United Irishmen was revealed on 30 May when the insurgents arrived and appointed him &#145;governor&#146; of Wexford town. Keugh, assisted by William Kearney, chaired the eight-man committee which administered the &#145;Wexford republic&#146; and provided logistic support to rebel forces in the field. His moderation reassured nervous neutrals and he responded as best he could to the appeals of imprisoned loyalists for protection. Only four prisoners were put to death in the town between 4 and 20 June, although matters were frequently chaotic. Keugh was technically superseded by Harvey about 7 June when the former commander-in-chief of the New Ross army was made &#145;president&#146; of the Wexford-based council. Keugh in fact remained the military commander in Wexford town and took steps to bolster its harbour and land defences. Several contemporaries refuted allegations that Keugh concurred in the mass execution of loyalist captives on 20 June. His authority had evidently waned at this critical period to the point that he was incapable of imposing restraint on the extremists attached to Captain Thomas Dixon.<br>
<br>Preserving lives was foremost in Keugh's mind on 21 June when, after consulting with his colleagues in his home, he decided to place the town in the care of Lord Kingsborough until its surrender had been negotiated. Captain McManus of the Antrim militia and Edward Hay were sent to contact Lieutenant-General Gerard Lake at Enniscorthy, who spurned the &#145;insolent&#146; proposals on the 22nd. The issue was forced later that day when Major-General John Moore's column recaptured the undefended town. Keugh was one of the few insurgents not to have fled and apparently hoped that Kingsborough and others would intercede on his behalf.<br>
<br>Keugh was court-martialled with eight others on 24 June and made a strong speech in which he denied complicity in atrocities. This plea and Kingsborough's support were insufficient to prevent capital conviction. Barrington sought a reprieve from Under-Secretary Edward Cooke in Dublin Castle and was told that Lake did not wish to diminish the exemplary function of the proceedings. Keugh was sent to the makeshift gallows on Wexford Bridge as planned at 11 a.m. on 25 June, where his call for a protestant clergyman elicited the sympathy of General Moore. He was attended by the Revd John Elgee, rector of Wexford. Keugh's head was removed to be spiked on the court house and his mutilated body thrown into the river as a mark of dishonour.<br>
