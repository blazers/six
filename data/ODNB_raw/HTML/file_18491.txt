<span class="headword">Mechi,  John Joseph</span>  (1802&#150;1880), <span class="occ">agriculturist</span>, was born on 22 May 1802 in London, the third son in the family of four sons and two daughters of Giacomo Mechi, of Bologna, and of Elizabeth, daughter of J. Beyer of Poland Street, London. He passed much of his childhood in Kensington, where his father is said to have held a position at the palace, taking holidays in the countryside of Essex and Suffolk, and he finished his education in France. He entered the City at sixteen, as a clerk in a house in Walbrook in the Newfoundland trade. He married first, in 1823, Fanny Frost, who died in 1845. Second, in 1846, he married Charlotte (1816&#150;1896), daughter of Francis Ward of Chillesford, Suffolk, with whom he had four daughters and one son.<br>
<br>In 1827 Mechi was able to set up on his own account as a retail cutler in small premises at 130 Leadenhall Street; he moved to no. 4 in 1830. In that year he regularized his position by being admitted to the Loriners' Company (of which he was master in 1860&#150;63), and by becoming a freeman in the City of London (he had to petition the court of common council because his father was not naturalized). His business prospered between 1830 and 1840; &#145;he set and ground razors with more than ordinary skill&#146;  (<span class="italic">City Press</span>, 29 Dec 1880) and supplied scientific instruments, pencils, and quill-cutting penknives. &#145;Mechi's magic razor strop&#146; was heavily advertised and may have been based on a purchased patent. His own two patents, of 1840, were both concerned with lighting improvements&#151;to illuminate shop window fronts and to modify oil and gas lamps so that the heat and the combustion vapours were carried off, thus improving room ventilation.<br>
<br>From 1840 Mechi turned his attention to farming and after an intensive study of the earlier English farming writers he resolved to practise, and especially to publicize, improvements in agriculture. Accordingly in 1841 he purchased, for &pound;3400, Tiptree Hall Farm, said to be of 130&#150;170 acres at Tiptree Heath, an area of poor clay soil in Essex. Mechi established a model farm with a large capital input for drainage and irrigation; the farm also had a 6 hp fixed steam-engine to provide power for driving barn machinery and for pumping water and liquid manure. The essence of his practice was to use the manure from sheep, pigs, and bullocks, expensively stall-fed on bought concentrates, to fertilize crops of wheat, pulses, and sown grasses. He held annual gatherings in July to which &#145;he invited men of talent and skill to witness the combined results of capital and science&#146;  (<span class="italic">ILN</span>, 11 April 1857), and he encouraged visitors, who came from all over the world and who recorded their comments in the visitors' book, kept from 1846 to 1878. The farm was the scene of the reaping machine trials of the 1851 Great Exhibition and of the 1855 trial of Robert Romaine's steam cultivator. After the trial of Cyrus McCormick's reaper at Tiptree in August 1851, Mechi reported his &#145;conviction that all our reaping will soon be done by horse or steam machines&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 12 Aug 1851).<br>
<br>Above all Mechi used the spoken and written word to spread his views on scientific farming, with talks (many subsequently published) to farmers' clubs and agricultural societies, with letters to the agricultural press, and with his best-selling publications, notably the three main versions of <span class="italic">How to Farm Profitably</span> (1859, 1872, and 1878); included in these were the Tiptree Hall Farm balance sheets. Among the improvements he advocated were deep cultivation, farm steam power, and the use of town sewage. Although many were impressed by Mechi's achievements, others criticized his intensive husbandry for requiring a massive capital input beyond the reach of ordinary farmers.<br>
<br>Gradually Mechi's enterprises ceased to prosper. He had operated his business as a cutler with Charles Bazin (1859&#150;69) and had moved to 112 Regent Street, London, but sales of the &#145;magic razor strop&#146; and penknives declined. Certainly since 1840 Mechi had ceased to direct his creative energy into the City concerns which helped to underpin his farm financially. Nevertheless he was elected sheriff of London and Middlesex in 1856&#150;7 (receiving a grant of arms in 1856), and alderman of the ward of Lime Street in the City in 1858. However, he resigned this post in 1866 to avoid the expensive prospect of becoming lord mayor, after heavy losses in companies that he had founded. The Unity Joint Stock Bank, of which he was a governor, failed in 1866, and the Unity Fire and General Life insurance companies were torn apart by internal dissension. Mechi was a juror in the department of art and science at the Great Exhibition of 1851 and also in the Paris Universal Exhibition of 1855. He was a member of the council of the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester, from 1845, and of its committee of management from 1847, and he was regarded as the founder of the Royal Agricultural Benevolent Institution in 1860. Mechi was elected a member of the Farmers' Club, London in 1846, was a prominent speaker at meetings, and served as chairman 1877&#150;8.<br>
<br>The decline of all Mechi's enterprises continued inexorably, that of Tiptree Farm being accelerated by the bad seasons of the 1870s which culminated in the disastrous year of 1879. Mechi became ill with diabetes and was forced to place his affairs into liquidation on 14 December 1880. He died of phrenitis and gastritis at Tiptree Hall on 26 December 1880 and was buried in Tiptree Heath church on 1 January 1881.<br>
<br>Mechi's early farming success had coincided with the &#145;golden age&#146; of English agriculture but it was doubtful whether his intensive method of mixed farming was appropriate to the heavy Essex clays or even to the more general run of English soils. His more lasting reputation must remain that of an enthusiastic publicist of scientific agriculture in an era of high farming.<br>
