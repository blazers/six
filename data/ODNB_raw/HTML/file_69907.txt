<span class="headword">Atkinson,  Mabel</span>  (1876&#150;1958), <span class="occ">feminist and socialist</span>, was born on 22 May 1876 at Ridley Mill, Broomley, near Stocksfield, in rural Northumberland. She was the daughter of John Boland Atkinson, inspector of mines, and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Elliott (<i>b</i>. 1853), feminist and militant suffragette; she had four brothers and one sister. Her parents were, as she later said, progressive and sympathetic on female education and employment. As a young woman, however, she chafed against restrictive middle-class Victorian behaviour and dress; she considered the bicycle &#145;the first great emancipation&#146; for women  (Palmer). She was one of the first women undergraduates at Glasgow University, where she arrived in 1894, two years after women students had been admitted to the university, to be taught in separate classes from the men but with common examinations; she remembered it as a &#145;delightful experience of freedom&#146;  (ibid.). She graduated in 1900 (MA, first-class honours) with the medal for the most distinguished arts graduate of the year. She then pursued research at Glasgow and the London School of Economics before studying for a year at Bryn Mawr College, Pennsylvania. That research, published as <span class="italic">Local Government in Scotland</span> (1904), was the first survey of the subject and a characteristically opinionated argument for reform.<br>
<br>In 1904 Atkinson returned to the north-east of England as a lecturer in philosophy and classics at Armstrong College, Durham. In 1908 she moved to London to be a Workers' Educational Association (WEA) tutor, a commitment to broadening education that was lifelong; she also lectured in economics at King's College for Women (part of London University) until 1915 and published an economics textbook with fellow lecturer Margaret McKillop in 1911. She wrote for the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>, on the gold standard, trade unionism, feminism, and&#151;a persistent personal and political theme&#151;the problem of celibacy for single, professional women, but left the paper over its position on women's suffrage.<br>
<br>Atkinson joined the Fabian Society as an undergraduate in 1897 and became president of the Glasgow University group. Alongside the suffrage movement the Fabian Society was the main channel for her fierce political energy&#151;as a member, from 1906, of its local government group, where she led a study of local organization of labour; as a lecturer; as a founder member of the Fabian Society Women's Group in 1908; and as a reforming member of the Fabian executive from 1909 to 1919. She was vice-chair of the Federated Council of Women's Suffrage Societies and a frequent&#151;if initially shaky&#151;suffrage speaker; she was proud of taking part in every demonstration, as was her mother. She attempted to stand in the London county council election of 1910 but was not selected because she refused to denounce the suffrage agitation. Atkinson proposed the Fabian summer school and was education secretary, responsible for the general plan of events and the lecture programme. She participated enthusiastically in gymnastics on the lawn and, we can assume, in the &#145;unchaperoned flirtation&#146; and &#145;surprisingly open&#146; conversation commented on by Beatrice Webb  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 3.98).<br>
<br>Atkinson's Fabian tract (no. 175), <span class="italic">The Economic Foundations of the Women's Movement</span>, published in June 1914, was a main outcome of the women's group's in-depth inquiry into how women's economic independence, particularly as mothers, could be achieved under socialism. An argument for maternal endowments (the forerunner of family allowances, for which Eleanor Rathbone would soon launch a campaign), it addresses &#145;a second generation of advanced women&#146; facing &#145;a new set of problems&#146;  (p. 17), women who have economic independence &#145;so keenly appreciated and won by such fierce struggles&#146;, but only &#145;on condition of compulsory celibacy and &hellip; childlessness&#146;. Because of marriage bans in most professional employment it was a &#145;forced alternative&#146; that Atkinson herself faced  (p. 18).<br>
<br>Margaret Cole described Atkinson at this time as &#145;truculent&#146; and &#145;something of a stormy element in Edwardian Fabianism&#146;  (Cole, 349). During the First World War she lectured on peace, signally failing to impress Virginia Woolf, attending her first Fabian event. She chaired the Fabian committee on the need for a supra-national authority, which contributed to the development of the League of Nations. She produced a densely argued study of infant mortality, <span class="italic">Life-Saving in War-Time</span>, for the Infant Welfare Propaganda Committee (1916); it is noteworthy for its practical sense of the social and economic circumstances of urban working-class mothers.<br>
<br>On 2 July 1914 in Kensington, Atkinson made, in Cole's words, &#145;an unfortunate marriage&#146; to an Australian journalist, Andrew Robert Barratt Palmer (1886&#150;1948). When war broke out he joined up; in 1920 she followed him to Sydney but left and moved to Durban, South Africa, in early 1921. Then began a second career, under her married name, teaching economics and economic history at Natal Technical College, Durban (later Natal University College), and as director of the local WEA, and she soon gained a reputation for &#145;strong-mindedness and irritating persistence&#146;  (Vietzen, &#145;Beyond school&#146;, 53). In 1929 she joined the senate of the University of South Africa (she would knit when meetings became boring). She continued to write on economics and education and threw herself into local progressive causes, including the League of Nations study circle and the National Council of Women; she engaged with race relations and black trade union politics, becoming research secretary of the Joint Council of Europeans and Natives in Durban; she had a particular interest in Natal's Indian population. When Winifred Holtby visited South Africa in 1926 Palmer made clear to her &#145;the gravity of economic and racial antagonisms&#146;  (Brittain, 235); with Holtby she canvassed for support for the Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union from British trade unions and Labour politicians, which led to the London Group on African Affairs.<br>
<br>On formal retirement in 1936 Atkinson began a third career, for which she became well known in South Africa, working, as the university authorities observed, with her customary vigour to establish higher education for black, Asian, and other non-white students, initially unpaid and holding classes in her sitting room. Many of the students were teachers studying part-time so that classes were usually held at weekends with students coming long distances with considerable difficulty to attend. When a segregated section of the University of Natal for non-European education was set up in 1945 she became its director, justifying segregation as a first step, on the model of her own student days. Her approach was, unsurprisingly, shaped by her European liberal and colonialist frame of reference, and that segregationist compromise, and some interventions, came to be seen as highly problematic but she is remembered with gratitude by students. Non-European enrolment increased from 19 in 1936 to 351 in 1955, when, aged eighty and with failing eyesight, she again retired.<br>
<br>It had been work that Atkinson undertook with &#145;a generous heart&#146;  (Marks, 6), &#145;pertinacity, idealism and practical sense&#146;  (ibid., 7) in the view of Dr Edgar Brookes, principal of Adams College, the African high school and college. Dr Sylvia Vietzen describes her as &#145;single-minded, shrewd, astringent on occasions, unremitting in work and formidable in intellectual power&#146;  (Vietzen, &#145;Mabel Palmer&#146;, 98). She was often, and remains, controversial. In later years her girth and thick glasses, plus green eye-shade, evoked some comment. She published her last book, <span class="italic">The History of the Indians in Natal</span>, in 1957. She was awarded a DPhil (<i>honoris causa</i>) by the University of South Africa in 1947 and was made an honorary member of the Fabian Society in 1958. She died at her home, 24 Clair Avenue, Manor Gardens, Durban on 16 November 1958 and was buried in Stellawood cemetery, Durban.<br>
