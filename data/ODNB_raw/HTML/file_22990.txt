<span class="headword">Ratcliffe, Sir  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1485), <span class="occ">royal councillor</span>, was a younger son of Thomas Ratcliffe, esquire, of the Isle of Derwentwater (Cumberland), and his wife, Margaret, a daughter of Sir Thomas Parr of Kendal. By 1475 Ratcliffe was in the service of Richard, duke of Gloucester, perhaps through the Parr connection&#151;one of his Parr uncles, Thomas, died in the duke's service at Barnet in 1471. Ratcliffe was active on the duke's behalf in co. Durham, and was his constable of Barnard Castle. He was a member of the ducal council by 1477. He served under the duke on the Scottish campaigns of 1480&#150;2, and was knighted by him beside Berwick in 1481 and advanced to banneret in Scotland the following year.<br>
<br>Ratcliffe was one of Gloucester's trusted associates in the events leading up to his seizure of the throne in June 1483. Ratcliffe carried the duke's letters of 10 June requesting military help from the city of York against the queen's affinity, and was present when the northern forces mustered at Pontefract a fortnight later, apparently presiding over the execution of Rivers, Vaughan, and Grey, before accompanying the army south. Richard III made him a knight of his body and he was chosen a knight of the Garter early in the reign. In September 1484 he received a major grant of land (valued at 1000 marks) in the south-west, much of it once held by the Courtenay earls of Devon. He does not, however, appear to have taken on a significant role in the region, his interests remaining primarily northern. In the first year of the reign the prior of Durham commented on &#145;the great rule that he beareth under the king's grace in our country&#146;  (Pollard, 358). Ratcliffe succeeded his uncle, William Parr, as sheriff of Westmorland in August 1484. He was much involved in the negotiations for a truce with Scotland, and on the death of Humphrey, Lord Dacre, in May 1485, succeeded him as the king's deputy lieutenant on the west march. Ratcliffe was one of the king's closest councillors, and after the death of Queen Anne spoke out against the possibility of Richard's marrying his niece, Elizabeth of York, on the grounds that it would alienate the king's northern supporters. His influence over the king is shown by William Collingbourne's famous couplet:<blockquote>
<div>The Cat, the Rat and Lovell our dog<br>
</div>
<div>Rule all England under the Hog.<br>
</div> (Horrox, 222)</blockquote>It was also recognized by William Wainfleet, the bishop of Winchester, who made Ratcliffe constable of his castle of Taunton in March 1484.<br>
<br>Ratcliffe fought for Richard III at the battle of Bosworth on 22 August 1485 and was probably, as the Crowland continuator states, killed there. But there was evidently some initial confusion about his fate. The royal proclamation issued immediately after the battle named him among the dead, but the next day Henry VII ordered him to be arrested and brought before him. The government apparently still believed him to be at large on 24 September, when he headed the list of those excluded from pardon, but by then his family knew him to be dead, and already on 20 September the bishop of Dromore had been commissioned to veil his widow. Ratcliffe was attainted in Henry VII's first parliament.<br>
<br>Ratcliffe married Agnes (erroneously called Alice in the commission to veil her), daughter of Henry, Lord Scrope of Bolton, whose first husband, Christopher Boynton of Sedbury in Gilling, near Richmond in the North Riding of Yorkshire, had died in 1479. Agnes was dead by July 1509 when her eldest son from her first marriage, Henry Boynton, received a pardon as her executor. She had two children with Ratcliffe: a daughter, Isabel, who married Roger Lumley, and a son, Richard, who married Margaret Wilberfoss. Richard secured the reversal of his father's attainder in 1495, when he argued that as his father had been a younger son, with two older brothers still living, both of whom had several children, there was nothing to forfeit other than the grants made by Richard III, which had in any case been resumed.<br>
