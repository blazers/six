<span class="headword">Reading,  William</span>  (1674&#150;1744), <span class="occ">librarian</span>, was born on 17 September 1674 at Swin in the parish of Wombourne, Staffordshire, the son of William and Joan Redding. He describes his father as &#145;a refiner of iron&#146;. He was educated at Halesowen School by Josiah Read and Robert Durant. He matriculated from University College, Oxford, on 1 June 1693, graduated BA in 1697, and proceeded MA from St Mary Hall on 28 June 1703. He was ordained deacon on 19 September 1697 and priest, by Henry Compton, bishop of London, on 21 December 1707.<br>
<br>Reading's appointment as library keeper at Sion College, London Wall, on 15 November 1708, upon the recommendation of Bishop Compton, may well have been connected with the conferment of legal deposit status on the library, as this was currently being discussed by parliament, and became law under the <span class="roman">Act for the Encouragement of Learning</span> on 10 April 1710. The act, as the other libraries of deposit discovered, was not wholly effective in securing deposit by the Stationers of the kind of book that the libraries required. Reading's librarianship, however, saw a substantial increase in the stock and use of the library. In addition to deposited books, there were large gifts or bequests of books from Bishop Compton (1707 and 1713&#150;14), Mrs Eleanor James (1711), Edward Waple (1712), and Francis Bugg (1717?). Having brought the vellum book of benefactors up to date, Reading submitted to the college court a proposal for settling the library and putting it in good order (5 September 1720). He was able to extend the shelving of the library, so that it could be arranged in a classified order with space for accessions, and to remove the chains from the books. These improvements are apparent in the <span class="italic">Bibliothecae cleri Londinensis in Collegio Sionensi catalogus</span>, a volume in folio which Reading brought out in 1724. The first part, printed by John Watts, the best printer of his day, is in classified shelf order, with detailed entries which include the printer's name and the name of the benefactor (when this was known to the cataloguer). The second part is an index by author and subject, and the third a history of the library (in English). Modelled on the 1693 catalogue of Charles Maurice Le Tellier's collection, Reading's elaborate catalogue was highly valued for its classifications at a time when very few English libraries boasted published catalogues.<br>
<br>Reading had married by 1714, when his eldest son, Thomas Granger Reading, was born to his wife, Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1730). The births of six children are recorded in the registers of St Alfege's Church. The family lived in a house adjoining the college, and his wife and later his eldest son assisted Reading in the library. Catherine Reading died in 1730 and was buried in the church on 28 August.<br>
<br>Reading held lectureships in several London churches, including St Alfege, St Michael, Crooked Lane, and Christchurch, Newgate Street; in the dedications to Archbishop William Wake of his volumes of sermons he nevertheless displayed some disappointment at the lack of preferment in the church. The office of clerk or register of the college, and that of librarian, had been split at the time of his appointment; they were reunited in 1724, and the additional burden that fell upon Reading is clear from the minutes of the college court.<br>
<br>In addition to the achievement of the 1724 catalogue, Reading published an edition of the ecclesiastical historians&#151;Eusebius, Socrates, Sozomen, and others&#151;in three volumes at Cambridge in 1720. Three volumes of sermons were published in his lifetime, and they were collected as <span class="italic">One Hundred and Sixteen Sermons</span> in 1755.<br>
<br>Reading continued to write the minutes of the court until 17 April 1744. He died on 10 December 1744. In his will he left bequests of &pound;20 apiece to his younger children, and &pound;30 to the eldest child, Thomas. He asked to be buried in the porch of St Alfege's Church near the grave of his wife, Catherine. Thomas Reading evidently hoped to succeed his father as librarian, but an improvement in the finances of the college enabled the court to appoint William Brakenridge as principal librarian, while Thomas Reading was continued as assistant register or clerk. He did, however, remain in the house his father had occupied.<br>
<br>William Reading left at his death a reputation for his plain and honest manner of life and preaching, according to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (1st ser., 14, 1744, 676). The catalogue of 1724 also shows how ably he had built upon the library's status as one of deposit, augmented by important benefactions, to become one of London's richest and most accessible resources for scholarship.<br>
