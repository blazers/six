<span class="headword">Ross,  Alan Strode Campbell</span>  (1907&#150;1980), <span class="occ">linguist</span>, was born on 1 February 1907, at 1 Woodlands, St Mary's, Brecon (where he spent his childhood), the elder son of Archibald Campbell Carne Ross (1873&#150;1937), a land agent with other business interests, and his wife, Millicent Strode (1874&#150;1971), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cobham. His paternal grandfather, Charles Campbell Ross, entered the family bank in Penzance, became mayor of Penzance, and was returned member of parliament for St Ives in a by-election on 13 April 1881. He met financial disaster: everything, including his house, was sold, and he became secretary of the Whitechapel Art Gallery.<br>
<br>A. S. C. Ross was educated at Malvern College and Christ College, Brecon, and went on in 1925 to Balliol College, Oxford. Having done conspicuously well at school in physics and been awarded a scholarship on the science side, he intended to devote himself to astronomy. At first he read mathematics, but he was placed in the second class in the first public examination in a subject in which, as he thought with great clarity, those who have distinguished careers get firsts. He switched to English language and literature, that being the Oxford honour school which in the 1920s enabled him to study the widest range of philological subjects centred on English and related languages. He had little taste for the study of literature, though he was very widely read in writings from those of the Anglo-Saxons onwards, with a special interest in nineteenth- and twentieth-century fiction. Having achieved first-class honours in 1929 he at once obtained a post as lecturer in the English department of the University of Leeds, where he stayed until the Second World War. On 11 July 1933 Ross married Elizabeth Stefanyja Olszewska (1907&#150;1973), daughter of Maciej Bronislaw Wac&#322;aw Olszewski and Ada Ethel Briggs of Warsaw. She, herself a sensitive and learned scholar, especially of Old Icelandic and Middle English literatures, taught for several Oxford colleges. They had one son, Alan Wac&#322;aw Padmint Ross.<br>
<br>The 1930s saw great developments in linguistics, and Ross's interests, founded on an excellent grasp of philology, especially of the Germanic languages centred on Old and Middle English and tracing Germanic phonology to Indo-European, were widened to include these new developments. He did not confine himself to Indo-European languages, of which he was acquainted with many, but had some knowledge of Finno-Ugrian languages and was always interested in non-European languages. He studied them mainly via grammars and dictionaries, and, though he gladly talked to speakers of many languages, he did not master modern foreign languages to express himself in them idiomatically and without accent. He read widely in them and used them mainly for comparative linguistic purposes. His important publications of this time included <span class="italic">The Dream of the Rood</span> (1934), which he edited with B. Dickins, and which was the standard edition of this Anglo-Saxon poem for many years. He drew on his mathematical as well as his linguistic interests in <span class="italic">The Numeral Signs of the Mohenjo-Daro Script</span> (1938).<br>
<br>Like other linguists and mathematicians, Ross spent the Second World War at the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, Buckinghamshire. In 1946 he was appointed to the department of English at Birmingham, and was soon appointed to a personal professorship in English language (1948&#150;51). From 1951 to his retirement in 1974 he held the chair of linguistics created for him at Birmingham.<br>
<br>The fundamental work of the Prague Linguistic Circle was eagerly assimilated by Ross from his time at Oxford onwards. In the thirties he had travelled widely in Europe, partly to study languages, and often to meet linguists and philologists, among them Karl Luick in Vienna. Ross's own most original work was on Old English. He was well aware of modern linguistic concepts: he wrote on the phoneme, advancing a mathematical definition. His work on the language of the Old English (Northumbrian) gloss to the Lindisfarne gospels and other northern texts (<span class="italic">Studies in the Accidence of the Lindisfarne Gospels</span>, 1937) was based on the work of the great grammarians and especially phonologists of English, Luick, Eduard Sievers, and, specifically for Northumbrian, of Uno Lindel&ouml;f of Helsinki. He was inclined to trace linguistic features back to earlier, often pre-Germanic stages, rather than regarding them as having arisen within Old English at a time of rapid linguistic change in Northumbria. Some of his philological and linguistic interests are reflected in the coverage of the journal he edited, <span class="italic">English and Germanic Studies</span>, renamed <span class="italic">English Philological Studies</span> (1947&#150;68). His own contributions in many journals range widely, and include statistical approaches to linguistic problems; he founded a series called <span class="roman">Aldrediana</span> in which he (and others) advanced much of the detailed scholarship on Aldred, the scribe of the glosses to the Lindisfarne gospels and the Durham ritual. Fascinated by the lexical and phonological complexity of words, he wrote on &#145;ginger&#146; and on the names of numerals. His greatest achievement is his organizing the facsimile edition of the Lindisfarne gospels (1956, 1960), on which he had first published while at Leeds. This was followed by a facsimile edition of the Durham ritual (1969).<br>
<br>Ross enjoyed, however, many less bookish approaches to his subjects of interest: to prove a point in a geographical description of Scandinavia written about <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 900 in the Old English <span class="italic">Orosius</span>, he organized an expedition to demonstrate the facts. In the 1950s he taught, as a visiting professor, at Kingston, Jamaica, and developed an interest in Jamaican English. A little later he learnt Tahitian in Paris by conversing with native speakers, and used that knowledge in a book (with A. W. Moverley), <span class="italic">The Pitcairnese Language</span> (1964).<br>
<br>National fame came to Ross when he published a sociolinguistic study of present-day English, &#145;Linguistic class-indicators in present-day English&#146;  (<span class="italic">Neuphilologische Mitteilungen</span>, 55, 1954, 20&#150;56), popularized in various publications, most notably with Nancy Mitford in <span class="italic">Noblesse Oblige: an Enquiry into the Identifiable Characteristics of the English Aristocracy</span> (1956). In all of these he attempted to distinguish upper-class linguistic usage, &#145;U&#146;, from that of the other classes, &#145;non-U&#146;. The foundations for that work had been laid as an undergraduate amusement at Oxford. He knew that the linguistic study of social class &#145;marches with anthropology&#146;, yet his assertion that in English &#145;it is solely by its language that the upper class is marked off from the others&#146; led him to some circularity: his own usage was always pivotal to what he regarded as U. He granted, however, that such class-distinguishers were not for all time, but changed from generation to generation. His listings are comprehensive, and though his analysis may be the result of impression rather than of establishing a corpus sufficient for his scientific purpose, no other of Ross's writings so well show his wit, a quality that made him delightfully amusing company.<br>
<br>Alan S. C. Ross died of cancer on 23 September 1980 in St Barnabas's Hospice, Columbia Drive, Worthing, Sussex. He was buried in the Lodge Hill cemetery, Selly Oak, Birmingham, probably on 30 September.<br>
