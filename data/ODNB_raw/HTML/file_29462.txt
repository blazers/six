<span class="headword">William</span> <span class="st"> [St William of Norwich]</span>  (1132/3&#150;1144), <span class="occ">supposed victim of ritual murder</span>, known as the &#145;saint and martyr of Norwich&#146;, was supposedly the first victim of ritual murder by Jews to occur in England, and indeed in Europe. The accusation levelled against the Jews, the so-called &#145;blood libel&#146;, grew out of a popular superstition that they preyed on children, especially at the time of passover. The curious and highly questionable tale of William's supposed murder at the hands of Norwich Jews was, even in its own time, doubted by citizens and ecclesiastics alike, yet it survived, to become the source and model for popular myths, miracle stories, and further blood libel accusations aimed at the Jews. Two other cases involving the blood libel in England also resulted in the alleged victims being acclaimed as martyrs and saints: at Bury St Edmunds in 1181 a young boy named Robert was said to have been tortured and crucified by the Jews, and miracles were subsequently associated with his body, and there was also the case of Little St Hugh of Lincoln in 1255.<br>
<br>The earliest account of William's life, supposed murder, and sanctification is that of Thomas of Monmouth. Thomas became a monk of the cathedral priory of Norwich shortly before 1150, and played a significant part in the development of the cult associated with the dead boy, through his authorship of the life, and through his becoming sacristan of William's shrine. Thomas began his life and miracles of St William of Norwich at almost the same time that he took up residence as a monk in Norwich, and completed it in 1172&#150;3, some time after the events surrounding William's strange demise had occurred, and after the cult of the dead boy had had time to take root.<br>
<br>William was said to have been born on 2 February in either 1132 or 1133, in the village of Haveringland, 8 miles north-west of Norwich, and was the son of Wenstan, a prosperous farmer, and Elviva, daughter of a married priest. His mother was widowed by the time that William was twelve. He appears to have been given some basic education by his mother, before being apprenticed at the age of eight to Wulward, a Norwich skinner, with whom William lived during the term of his apprenticeship. Apparently Wulward's trade brought him into frequent contact with the Jewish community of Norwich, and so young William may also have had dealings with Wulward's Jewish clients, and made friends with Jewish children. William's uncle, Godwin Sturt, who may have held a benefice in Norwich, disliked the relationship that he witnessed between his nephew and the Norwich Jews, and forbade William to have anything to do with them.<br>
<br>The recorded story of William's disappearance and death begins at this point. Shortly after Godwin forbade William to have any contact with Jews, an unknown man, describing himself as the head cook in the kitchens of William, archdeacon of Norwich, came to call at William's mother's house on the Monday before Easter (20 March) 1144. The stranger explained that he wanted to offer the young William a place in service as a kitchen boy, under his direction. Elviva was sceptical about the offer, but when the man offered her money as proof of his sincerity, she was convinced, and gave her permission for her son to leave Wulward and to move on to service in the archdeacon's kitchens. After her approval of William's new indenture, it is recorded that the boy, accompanied by the unnamed stranger, stopped at Godwin's house in Norwich, and told William's aunt Liviva (Godwin's wife and Elviva's sister) about his new place of employment. Apparently Liviva became suspicious, and after the pair left, sent her daughter to follow them and find out where they were going. Thomas of Monmouth reports that the two were last seen entering a Jew's house in Norwich, and that William was found dead three days later, wearing only a coat and shoes.<br>
<br>William's body was buried without ceremony on Easter Monday (27 March), though subsequent legend records that his uncle Godwin and brother Robert identified his body on Easter Tuesday. Two days later, Godwin came before the bishops and clergy of Norwich, and charged the Jewish community of Norwich with the murder of his nephew, committed in connection with a ritual sacrifice. He then exhorted the clergy of Norwich to punish the Jews for the deed, even urging the elimination of the Jewish community in Norwich itself. William's body was removed from its original burial place in Thorpe Wood, and successively moved from tomb to tomb within the chapter house in Norwich, before its final enshrinement in 1154 on the north side of the rood screen. Here, an altar built over his tomb became a place of pilgrimage.<br>
<br>The detailed story of William's alleged ritual murder at the hands of Jews may have come to Thomas of Monmouth, years later, from a man named Theobald, a converted Jew of Cambridge. Theobald is quoted in Thomas's account as asserting that, at the time of William's supposed murder, he was &#145;at Cambridge, a Jew among Jews [<i>cum judeis judeus</i>], and the commission of the crime was no secret to me&#146;  (Monmouth, 94). Because of the enormous falsity of the accusation, scholars have often wondered whether Theobald was real, or merely a literary construct  (Jacobs, &#145;St William of Norwich&#146;, 752), devised by Thomas of Monmouth &#145;as a proof of the truth and credibility of the matter &hellip; which we have heard from Theobald, who was once a Jew, and afterwards a monk&#146;  (Monmouth, 94). Bishop Everard of Norwich seems to have disbelieved the accusation that William was murdered by the Jews from the outset, immediately after the body had been found and buried, and the citizens, secular clergy, and monks of Norwich could not agree whether the accusation was true or not. Moreover, the secular authority, namely the sheriff of Norfolk, was adamantly opposed to the wild accusations made against the Jews, forbade them to respond to a summons to the diocesan synod, and even took them into Norwich Castle for protection against an angry mob.<br>
<br>In spite of the lack of real evidence, the story was preserved, augmented, and used as a case for the sanctification of the dead William as a martyr, largely through the efforts of William Turbe, the prior of Norwich Cathedral, who had believed from the first that the Jews of Norwich had murdered the boy. He worked actively to persuade others of his belief that the story was true, and came into a better position to promote the cult of the boy martyr when he was elected bishop in 1146. Many of the miracles ascribed to the cult are described in the <span class="italic">Life</span>, and though interest declined after 1151, there were still a number of pilgrims coming regularly to William's shrine when Thomas of Monmouth was writing. Later, however, the cult enjoyed little success, and from the late thirteenth century offerings rarely amounted to more than &pound;1 per annum.<br>
<br>The graphic ritual details of William's &#145;murder&#146; in Thomas of Monmouth's account, constructed well after the event, are all drawn from one highly unreliable source, namely Theobald of Cambridge, who was neither present in Norwich, nor a witness when William's body was discovered. Theobald told Thomas that the incident was no secret among Jews, though he offered no proof of this, other than his claim to have been a Jew before his conversion to Christianity. All of the other reported &#145;evidence&#146; in the inquiry into William's death is hearsay, and the details of events between the boy's disappearance and the discovery of his dead body, hung on a tree near Norwich, were undoubtedly invented to discredit the Jews. Among those whom Thomas of Monmouth interviewed about William's disappearance and death was a Christian woman, who acted as servant to the Jewish man who owned the house where William was allegedly taken, and who described seeing the boy tied to a post inside the house. Whether these accounts of William's death, and of the wounds inflicted upon his body, are derived from Theobald's accusations is not certain, though they are similar to Theobald's reported description of a mock crucifixion ritual&#151;that is, a fictitious passover rite, and as such a complete invention. Thomas of Monmouth claims that he was shown two nail holes in the very post that the maid described, and that these corresponded with the wounds on young William's corpse (which, however, Thomas did not himself see). Thomas then describes, no less circumstantially, and, presumably, no more reliably, how the Jews left the body in the house until Good Friday, when they sneaked out of Norwich with the corpse and hung it upon a tree in Mousehold Wood, where it was discovered, clothed only in jacket and shoes, and with a gag in the mouth, on Easter evening, and how many of the citizens of Norwich came to see it.<br>
<br>At the time of William's death it was already a common superstition that Jews stole children, in order to crucify them as a mockery of the death of Christ. However, this blood libel accusation was only one way in which a child's mysterious death could be used for particular advantage: the ritual murder claim could be used to extort money from Jews, or by clergy (such as Godwin) who desired that relations between Jews and Gentiles should be kept to a bare minimum, or less. Or, as has been suggested by several historians, including the editors of Thomas of Monmouth's account, perhaps people guilty of committing crimes could divert suspicion from themselves by blaming the Jews. In telling the tale of William of Norwich, was Theobald (if he existed at all) really making a confession of guilt when he related this story of non-existent Jewish ritual practices? Was it &#145;beyond the bounds of possibility that he did the deed himself?&#146;  (Stokes, 126)<br>
