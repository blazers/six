<span class="headword">Harris,  (David) Kenneth</span>  (1919&#150;2005), <span class="occ">journalist and broadcaster</span>, was born at Aberaman, Glamorgan, on 11 November 1919, the only son and elder child of David Harris, a market gardener, and his wife, Kathleen. He was educated at Trowbridge boys' high school, Wiltshire, and Wadham College, Oxford. His studies were interrupted by the Second World War, and from 1940 to 1945 he served in the Royal Artillery. He returned to Oxford on demobilization in 1945 and two years later, after graduating with a second-class degree in modern history, took part in the first post-war Oxford Union debating tour of the United States, along with Tony Benn and Sir Edward Boyle. Debating became an important theme in his life. He founded the Observer Mace debating tournaments in 1953 and was chairman of the English Speaking Union's overseas debating committee from 1960 to 1995. When he died, a spokesman for the union said, &#145;Kenneth's importance in developing competitive debate in this country cannot be overstated&#146;  (www.britishdebate.com).<br>
<br>In 1948 Harris joined the <span class="italic">Sheffield Telegraph</span> and on 16 April 1949 he married Doris Winsmore Young-Smith (<i>d</i>. 1970), a 37-year-old war widow, and daughter of Aubrey Lawrence Fullerton. There were no children of the marriage. In 1950 Harris moved on to <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, where David Astor had recently become editor of the family-owned newspaper. It was typical of Astor's inspired risk-taking that he should appoint the thirty-year-old Harris to the important post of Washington correspondent, largely on the strength of the book, <span class="italic">Travelling Tongues</span> (1949), he had written about the Oxford undergraduate debating tour. He remained on <span class="italic">The Observer</span> for thirty-two years, working on the Pendennis diary column and then as the newspaper's labour correspondent. Always assiduous at cultivating social and political contacts, he gained the trust of senior figures in the Labour Party and the trade-union movement, especially Sam Watson, the Durham miners' leader, for whom he wrote some speeches. He also succeeded where many had failed in gaining the confidence of Clement Attlee, the post-war Labour prime minister, who agreed to confide his political memories to Harris's tape-recorder. These meetings culminated, many years later, in the only official Attlee biography (1982), Harris's most successful book. He also produced books about David Owen (1987), Margaret Thatcher (1988), and Elizabeth II (1994), and several collections of his journalism.<br>
<br>Harris was mainly known for his in-depth interviews, both in the newspaper and on television. Some of his journalist colleagues regarded him as over-deferential in his approach to his subjects, who were allowed to read and correct his written interviews. Astor, however, believed that Harris's courteous but well-researched method paid dividends in winning over public figures who were otherwise distrustful of the media. He persuaded a number of celebrities, from President Nixon to Sir Gordon Richards, the jockey, to confide personal secrets they had never made public before. On television he conducted a famous interview with Indira Gandhi, later the Indian prime minister, in which he provoked her to defend the principle of nepotism. He secured the first interview with Alexei Kosygin when he became Soviet premier, a scoop deemed so important that it was broadcast on both the BBC and ITV. Harris also secured the final interview with the duke of Windsor in 1972, weeks before his death. Astor believed the BBC should have made him the heir to Richard Dimbleby.<br>
<br>Harris was an elegant, well-groomed man with an actor's voice and a suave, faintly old-fashioned style that some of his colleagues regarded as pompous; hence his office nickname, the Bishop. By the end of 1976 he was enjoying a comfortable, but not notably demanding, schedule&#151;doing two big interviews a year for <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, organizing the newspaper's debating competitions, covering the party political conferences for the BBC, working in a leisurely fashion on his books, lunching at his club, the Athenaeum, enjoying the gaming tables at night (one of his casino companions, an elderly widow, left him a painting by &Eacute;douard Vuillard in her will)&#151;when his life was changed by a chance meeting over dinner at Rules restaurant in Covent Garden with a visiting American friend, Douglass Cater, a former White House correspondent and presidential aide turned academic. At that meeting Cater asked Harris about <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, which was on the point of being taken over by Rupert Murdoch. He suggested calling his boss at the Aspen Institute, a think-tank funded largely by Atlantic Richfield, the giant Californian oil company. A series of telephone calls followed over the weekend between Robert O. Anderson, the chairman of Atlantic Richfield (and the biggest private landowner in the United States), and Lord Goodman, chairman of the Observer Trust. As a result the American oil company bought Britain's oldest Sunday newspaper for one pound and took over its mounting debts.<br>
<br>Harris (who was made a director of The Observer Ltd in 1978) was regarded as a saviour by the paper's staff and quickly established a close personal relationship with Anderson, introducing him to the elevated contacts he had developed throughout his career. They launched an annual dinner, first at Lincoln's Inn and later at Claridge's, to celebrate the &#145;rescue&#146; of <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, where the speakers included Harold Macmillan and Henry Kissinger and the guest-list read like an extract from <span class="italic">Who's Who</span>. Harris and Cater, who was given an office at <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, started issuing memoranda on editorial policy, which were resented by the senior staff. Conor Cruise O'Brien, the Irish writer, diplomat, and politician, was drafted in as editor-in-chief to act as a buffer between &#145;Cater-Harris&#146; (as the two were known) and the journalists. In his memoirs O'Brien described Harris as &#145;a poisonous presence in my professional life&#146;  (O'Brien, 366), and at the time wrote a withering column about sycophants (&#145;lickspittles&#146;) in history, which was seen as a thinly veiled attack on him.<br>
<br>A crisis arose in 1981 when Anderson let it be known that he wanted Harris to represent him as deputy chairman of the newspaper. The <span class="italic">Observer</span> board, including Goodman, Astor, and O'Brien, rejected this proposal. Anderson's response was to sell the newspaper, immediately after the board meeting, to Lonrho, which owned it for the next twelve years. So Harris had the rare distinction for a working journalist of not only saving <span class="italic">The Observer</span> from Rupert Murdoch's clutches but also being the reason why it was sold on to Tiny Rowland. In 1981 Lonrho appointed him chairman of one of its subsidiaries, George Outram &amp; Co., later Caledonian Newspaper Publishing, publishers of the Glasgow <span class="italic">Herald</span> and <span class="italic">Evening Times</span>; he held this post until 1992, when he was appointed CBE. He retired as a director of The Observer Ltd in 1993.<br>
<br>Harris was a keen and knowledgeable follower of horse-racing, an interest he pursued in his retirement. He listed his other recreations as walking, fishing, and reading. His first wife having died in 1970, on 13 February 1988 he married Jocelyn (Jo) Rymer, a 45-year-old secretary, divorcee, and daughter of Frederick Smithson Wilkinson, farmer; she had two daughters from a previous marriage. Having lived latterly in Mill Lane, Donington, Lincolnshire, he died of cerebrovascular disease and prostate cancer at Gosberton House Care Home, Westhorpe Road, Gosberton, Lincolnshire, on 24 June 2005. He was survived by his wife, Jo, and his two stepdaughters.<br>
