<span class="headword">Lyfing <span class="st"> [Living]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> 1046), <span class="occ">abbot of Tavistock and bishop of Worcester</span>, was an ambitious monk who prospered in the disturbed political conditions between the death of &AElig;thelred II in 1016 and the accession of Edward the Confessor in 1042. He was a member of an ecclesiastical dynasty, a monk of Glastonbury or Winchester, abbot of Tavistock before 1027, and was probably a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Earl Godwine, a favourite of King Cnut. In 1027 he accompanied the king on his visit to Rome, and, after his return with Cnut's admonitory letter to the English church, was appointed to succeed Eadnoth, bishop of Crediton, who had died on the journey. At about the same time, he followed his uncle, Brihtwold, as bishop of Cornwall, a union of dioceses which was to last until 1877. After Cnut's death Lyfing backed Harold I in 1035&#150;6 and in 1038 or 1039 was rewarded with the rich bishopric of Worcester. But his supposed implication in the murder of Edward the Confessor's younger brother, Alfred, in 1036 caused the next king, Harthacnut, temporarily to deprive him of Worcester (1040&#150;1). However, Lyfing's support of Edward in 1041&#150;2 left him in peaceful possession of the three dioceses.<br>
<br>Clearly a &#145;vicar of Bray&#146; figure, Lyfing received no favourable notices from either contemporaries or later historians. William of Malmesbury, writing in the different climate of the 1120s, thought him, &#145;shamefully ambitious, an invincible, it is said, perverter [<i>tyrannus</i>] of the ecclesiastical laws, who valued nothing unless it entirely served his purpose&#146;  (<span class="italic">De gestis pontificum</span>, 2.94). But, to be fair, the churches of Crediton and, particularly, Cornwall were poorly endowed; and Worcester, coveted by similarly indigent York, provided an important royal counsellor with a suitable income. The pluralism was also part of a general centralizing tendency of the time. Lyfing seems to have made proper provision for Worcester's spiritual needs by employing Ealdred, abbot of Tavistock and his successor in that see, as his suffragan. One book owned by Lyfing, the Lanalet [St Germans] pontifical, may have been copied for Tavistock, of which he was a great benefactor. And it may be that he left his successor in the West-Saxon dioceses, the important reformer, Leofric, with foundations on which to build. Lyfing died between 20 and 25 March 1046 and was buried in Tavistock Abbey.<br>
