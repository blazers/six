<span class="headword">Corbet,  John</span>  (1603&#150;1641), <span class="occ">religious polemicist and Church of Scotland and Church of Ireland minister</span>, was probably born in the Gorbals, Glasgow, the son of William Corbet, a portioner of the city. He graduated MA from Glasgow University in 1623, and as &#145;a Person of Good learning&#146; was subsequently employed as a schoolmaster at Renfrew  (<span class="italic">Fasti Scot.</span>, 3.331). He was ordained as minister of Bonhill, Dunbartonshire, in 1637 but his tenure was destined to be both brief and racked with controversy. As a supporter of episcopacy he refused to acknowledge the authority of the general assembly of 1638 and aroused the suspicion and animosity of the solidly presbyterian synod of Dumbarton. After vacillating, in an attempt to retain his position, he finally refused to subscribe to the assembly's declaration against the bishops and fled to Ireland, leaving behind him his heavily pregnant wife and four young children to follow later. In his absence he was deposed from the ministry on 16 April 1639.<br>
<br>Once settled in Dublin, Corbet found powerful patrons in the form of John Bramhall, bishop of Derry, and Thomas Wentworth, earl of Strafford. Indeed, it was to this latter figure that he dedicated his pamphlet <span class="italic">The Ungirding of the Scottish Armour</span> (1639). This work was intended as a direct, and highly critical, response to the Revd Alexander Henderson's <span class="italic">Instructions for Defensive Arms</span> (1639). Rejecting both the legality of rebellion against &#145;great King Charles&#146; and the validity of the national covenant, it attacked &#145;the Flood of our Scottish Disorders and Uproares&#146;, while thoroughly vindicating the role of the episcopate  (Corbet, iv, vii).<br>
<br>Having thus endeared himself to the authorities in Ireland, Corbet appeared to be the ideal candidate to fill the recently vacated, and highly lucrative, post of dean of Raphoe, Donegal. However, this sinecure fell within the gift of Archibald Adair, bishop of Killala, who objected strongly to the scathing language that had been employed in Corbet's anti-Scottish diatribe. As Gilbert Burnet recounted it this resulted in a stormy interview between the two men in which Adair bitterly mocked and reviled his junior, pointing out that in Scottish dialect a Corbet, or Corby, signified a raven and that &#145;it was an ill bird that defiled its own nest&#146;  (Burnet, 109), although John Vesey told it slightly differently. Storming back to Dublin &#145;full of wrath&#146; Corbet lodged a complaint with Bishop John Bramhall against Adair's language and conduct, which was instrumental in having the latter removed by the high commission from his see (Burnet, 109&#150;12; Reid, 1.262; Vesey, xxiv).<br>
<br>The following year saw the publication of Corbet's <span class="italic">The Epistle Congratulatorie of Lysimachus Nicanor of the Society of Jesu, to the Covenanters in Scotland</span> (1640). In this bitter and &#145;very smart Book&#146;  (Burnet, 109) Corbet upbraided the covenanters and used the character of a fictional Jesuit to express satisfaction at the troubles in Scotland, and on sixteen separate counts, to draw close parallels between the pretended doctrines of the presbyterians and the Society of Jesus. Having been rewarded in 1640 with the ministry of the parishes of Killabin and Ballintubride, in Queen's county, Corbet appears to have been caught unawares by the suddenness and ferocity of the outbreak of the Irish rebellion of October 1641. His house was sacked by the insurgents and, though he sought refuge in the arms of his wife, he was cut to pieces by the blows of two Gaelic swineherds; his wife seems to have survived.<br>
