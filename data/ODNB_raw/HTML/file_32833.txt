<span class="headword">Dimock,  Nathaniel</span>  (1825&#150;1909), <span class="occ">liturgical scholar and theologian</span>, was born on 8 July 1825 at Stonehouse, Gloucestershire, son of John Dimock of Bridge-end, Stonehouse, and his wife, Emma Rook, daughter of Dr James Parkinson of Hoxton. He was educated at two private schools before matriculating at Oxford in 1843. He graduated BA from St John's College in 1847, proceeding MA in 1850. He was ordained deacon by Dr Edward Stanley, the bishop of Norwich, on behalf of the archbishop of Canterbury in 1848, and ordained priest by Archbishop Sumner in 1850. He married on 31 March 1853 Georgiana, daughter of John Alfred Wigan of Clare House, Kent, and sister of Sir Frederick Wigan, bt. She died three months after the marriage on 14 July 1853. Dimock was curate of East Malling, Kent, from 1848 to 1872. He was then vicar of Womenswold, Kent, from 1872 to 1876, and vicar of St Paul's, Maidstone, from 1876 to 1887. Owing to ill health he went abroad and became English chaplain at Sanremo from 1887 to 1888.<br>
<br>Dimock was a fine liturgical scholar. He approached questions from an evangelical standpoint, responding creatively and with great learning to the ferment of new thinking on sacramental questions occasioned by the Oxford Movement, in particular in its second, ritualistic phase. Evangelicals like Dimock argued against the ritualist teaching on the priestly office, on the real presence of the body and blood of Christ, and on the sacrifice of the mass. Dimock also sought to prove that this teaching was without warrant from most of the church fathers or from Anglican divines, including those of the Jacobean and Caroline period, whom high-church clerics particularly esteemed. In <span class="italic">The Christian Doctrine of Sacerdotium</span> (1897) Dimock maintained that there was a true priesthood within the Church of England, but that it was located not within its ministers but entirely in Christ and in his finished work. In his books <span class="italic">On Eucharistic Worship in the English Church</span> (1876) and <span class="italic">Papers on the Doctrine of the English Church Concerning the Eucharistic Presence</span> (2 vols., mem. edn 1911) he argued that the &#145;real presence&#146; was not local but spiritual, like the presence of the Lord in baptism. He maintained that Christ was present in the worthy recipient of communion only, and claimed an Anglican pedigree for this reformed, rather than Lutheran, view in Lancelot Andrewes, Jeremy Taylor, William Wake, and Daniel Waterland. Dimock followed on from William Goode, a mid-nineteenth-century evangelical theologian, and ultimately from Cranmer, developing the objection that the dogma of the real presence has deleterious consequences on the doctrine of the incarnation, denying the full humanity of Christ through the presence of a non-natural body on many altars following the ascension. Other important books by Dimock include <span class="italic">The Doctrine of the Death of Christ</span> (1890), <span class="italic">Missarum sacrificia</span> (1890), <span class="italic">Dangerous Deceits</span> (1895), <span class="italic">Vox liturgiae Anglicanae</span> (1897), and <span class="italic">Light from History on Christian Ritual</span> (1900). Dimock's greatest weakness was stylistic: his prose can be turgid, but his argument is clear and his sources exhaustively cited.<br>
<br>Dimock retired in 1888 and lived at Eastbourne. He passed a quiet life, uninvolved in public debate and controversy, until in 1900 he was invited to take part in Bishop Mandell Creighton's Fulham round-table conference on the holy communion and ritual. Dimock substantially influenced many of the conference's conclusions. From 1896 he lived at Redhill, and died there on 3 March 1909 at his home, Hemstede, Station Road. He was buried at Reigate cemetery on 8 March.<br>
<br>Dimock was recognized for his liturgical scholarship by those of other churchmanships, such as the high-church bishop of Edinburgh, John Dowden, who respected his work on the eucharist. From his own evangelical party Bishop Handley Moule of Durham acknowledged Dimock's standing, stating that &#145;in him the grace of God combined in perfect harmony a noble force and range of mental power, an unshaken fidelity to conscience and Revelation, and a spirit beautiful with humility, peace and love&#146;  (N. Dimock, <span class="italic">On Eucharistic Worship in the English Church</span>, mem. edn 1911, x).<br>
