<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bliss,  Philip</span>  (1787&#150;1857), <span class="occ">antiquary and book collector</span>, was the elder son of Philip Bliss (<i>d</i>. 1803), rector of Dodington and Frampton Cotterell, near Chipping Sodbury, Gloucestershire, where Bliss was born on 21 December 1787. His mother was Anne, daughter of Thomas Michell, of Corsham, Wiltshire. Bliss was educated at the free grammar school at Chipping Sodbury, then at Merchant Taylors' School, London, from 1797 until 1806, when he went as a scholar to St John's College, Oxford, matriculating thence as a student of civil law. He became a fellow of St John's in 1809, and took the degrees of BCL in 1815 and DCL in 1820. He was ordained deacon in 1817 and priest in 1818; he briefly held a curacy at Newington, Oxfordshire, and in 1830 was made rector of Avening, Gloucestershire, but took little active interest in the parish. On 22 July 1823 he married Sophia, second daughter of Robert Barker Bell, formerly fellow of New College, and thereafter resided at 38 St Giles', Oxford; their son and daughter both died in childhood.<br>
<br>An antiquary and book collector from boyhood, Bliss was bibliographically precocious, writing for Sir Egerton Brydges' <span class="italic">Censura literaria</span> from 1805, and for other organs, including the <span class="italic">Oxford University and City Herald</span> from 1808 (he became a part proprietor of this newspaper in 1835); he also published historical reprints as small tracts in limited editions. In 1808 he became an assistant at the Bodleian Library, where he worked on the catalogue of the Rawlinson and Gough collections. His major publications started soon afterwards with an edition of John Earle's <span class="italic">Microcosmography</span> (1811), which carried a useful appendix listing English character books, a category strongly represented in Bliss's own library.<br>
<br>From 1809, following a proposal negotiated for him by Thomas Park with the London bookseller Joseph Harding, Bliss was engaged in editorial work on Anthony Wood's <span class="italic">Athenae Oxonienses</span>, published in four volumes (including the <span class="italic">Fasti</span>) between 1813 and 1820. A new edition was started by the Ecclesiastical History Society in 1848 but proceeded no further than a first volume containing the <span class="italic">Life of Wood</span>. Bliss's interleaved copy of the 1813 edition, with materials for the continuation, was bequeathed to the Bodleian (Bodl. Oxf., MSS top. Oxon. d. 8&#150;13).<br>
<br>In 1813 appeared <span class="italic">Letters Written by Eminent Persons in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries, and Lives of Eminent Men by John Aubrey &hellip; from &hellip; the Bodleian</span>, notable for Bliss's editorial contribution of the first substantial (though inaccurate) publication of Aubrey's <span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>. <span class="italic">Reliquiae Hearnianae</span>, a selection from Thomas Hearne's voluminous diaries, was announced in a prospectus put out in 1816; 576 pages were printed in 1821&#150;2, but work was broken off, presumably when Bliss's new administrative duties intervened, and publication was resumed only in 1857. Even then only 50 large-paper and 150 ordinary copies were published; another issue with additional matter followed in 1869. The proof sheets of the <span class="italic">Reliquiae</span>, as well as Bliss's own copy, are in the Bodleian.<br>
<br>In 1822 he was appointed, on second application, to the staff of the British Museum, but later that year was brought back to Oxford by his friend Bulkeley Bandinel to be the junior sub-librarian at the Bodleian. He held the post until 1828. (He had previously, in 1818&#150;20, attempted unsuccessfully to obtain the librarianship of the Advocates' Library in Edinburgh.) Oxford proved ideally congenial for him, but his contribution was more to the university's administration than to its library.<br>
<br>From December 1824 until April 1853 (when he retired in advance of the <span class="roman">University Reform Act</span> of 1854 on a pension of &pound;200) he was registrar of the university, and in 1826 (having eight years before failed to secure the appointment) he was elected unopposed to be keeper of the archives, a post in which his penchant for accumulation seems to have impeded administrative efficiency. He resigned his Bodleian sub-librarianship at the end of 1828 and held numerous offices in the university, notably that of principal of St Mary Hall, 1848&#150;57, in succession to Bishop Hampden. His prominence and diligence in university business and his polished manners made him the embodiment of the traditions of <i>ancien r&eacute;gime</i> Oxford. He died at the principal's lodgings of St Mary Hall on 18 November 1857 and was buried in St Giles's churchyard on the 21st. His wife survived him.<br>
<br>Bliss assembled a substantial library, much of it related to his biographical and bibliographical researches and thus strong in books with Oxford connections, sixteenth- and seventeenth-century English poets, and works by &#145;royal and noble authors&#146; (of which an earlier collection of his had been sold in London on 11 January 1811). His books bear the discreet ownership mark of a &#145;P&#146; written before the printed signature &#145;B&#146;, with a two-digit year of purchase following. His library was sold by Sotheby and Wilkinson in two main groups beginning 28 June and 9 August 1858, which with supplementary sales produced a total of &pound;5672 14<i>s</i>.; the Bodleian acquired 745 volumes of local importance. Bliss left instructions that his general correspondence should be offered to the British Museum, which purchased it from his widow in January 1858: it is now Add. MSS 34567&#150;34582.<br>
