<span class="headword">Ennals,  David Hedley</span>, Baron Ennals  (1922&#150;1995), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Walden, Mellish Road, Walsall, Staffordshire, on 19 August 1922, the second of the three sons of Arthur Ford Ennals, master draper and subsequently funeral director, and his wife, Jessie Edith, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Taylor. He was brought up in a devoutly Baptist family and all three brothers were to fill significant public roles: all were concerned with the plight of the less privileged, and each had a strong interest in international affairs. Like his two brothers, Ennals was educated at Queen Mary's Grammar School, Walsall. He left having gained an English Speaking Union scholarship to the Loomis Institute in Connecticut, USA. On his return he worked as a journalist for the <span class="italic">Wolverhampton Express and Star</span> until he was old enough to enlist with the Staffordshire regiment. In the invasion of Normandy he served in the Reconnaissance Corps. He was wounded, captured, and held in a German prison hospital, reaching home in 1946 after a long period when he was missing, presumed dead. While recovering from his injuries, especially to his right arm which never fully recovered, he worked as a regional officer for the United Nations Association.<br>
<br>In 1947 Ennals became secretary of the Council for Education in World Citizenship. He stood as a Liberal candidate for Richmond but failed to get elected in 1950 and 1951. On 10 June 1950 he married Eleanor Maud Caddick (<i>b</i>. 1924/5), secretary, daughter of Reginald Victor Caddick, company director; there were three sons and a daughter of the marriage. In 1952 Ennals became secretary of the United Nations Association (1952&#150;7). In this post he showed great energy and raised its profile at a time when there were few competing internationally focused pressure groups. It was his work there that helped him gain his next position, as secretary to the international department of the Labour Party's head office at Transport House, in 1957. This was almost a one-man band, so limited were the party's resources at that time. It was also a period when the great debate about nuclear disarmament nearly tore the party asunder. Labour was in opposition throughout this period, so Ennals was its main source of professional advice on British foreign policy. He managed to chart a difficult path between the entrenched party groups. He wrote the chapters in the briefing book for Labour candidates before the 1964 general election, <span class="italic">Twelve Wasted Years</span> (1963). It was characteristic that he devoted a whole chapter in the brief space allotted to international affairs to the United Nations. &#145;It has thus been the Party's policy constantly to urge an &#147;increase in the authority of the United Nations&#148;&#151;not as an end in itself but as a step toward eventual world government&#146;  (<span class="italic">Twelve Wasted Years</span>, 369). This probably captured Ennals's central, driving utopian dream.<br>
<br>Ennals became Labour MP for Dover in October 1964, a victory that reflected a prodigious amount of constituency work. Both his own majority and that of Labour nationally were tiny. In March 1966 the Labour prime minister, Harold Wilson, won a much larger majority. Ennals was one of the few new MPs to be given a junior ministerial post in the new government, being made parliamentary under-secretary of state for the army (1966&#150;7). He was well fitted for this post. He was then moved to a similar position in the Home Office (1967&#150;8), where he was deputy to James Callaghan and had to take responsibility for the <span class="roman">Commonwealth Immigrants Act</span> (1968) limiting the entry of east African Asians. It caused Ennals considerable personal and family discomfort. His younger brother, Martin, fought the measure. His next post was that of minister of state (1968&#150;70) at the new Department of Health and Social Security. The secretary of state, Richard Crossman, saw Ennals as extremely hard working and loyal. Then came the June 1970 election, Labour's defeat, and the loss of Ennals's own seat. He went back to a campaigning job, this time as campaigning director of the National Association for Mental Health (later renamed MIND).<br>
<br>In February 1974 Ennals was elected Labour MP for Norwich North. He returned to his old interests as minister of state at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (1974&#150;6). There he dealt with a wide range of issues and showed himself assured and informed. This was the nearest he was to get to what must have been his ultimate ambition&#151;to be foreign secretary. He had risen steadily and was now just one rung below that coveted position. It was not to be. Wilson resigned as prime minister in April 1976 and James Callaghan took his place. Ennals had supported Callaghan in his leadership bid but he was not rewarded with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Instead he went to the Department of Health and Social Security, as secretary of state (1976&#150;9). This was the peak of his career but it was also a painful and difficult period. The economic crisis, and the International Monetary Fund visit and its aftermath, left the Labour government with little choice but to constrain severely public spending. Ennals was a surprise replacement for Barbara Castle, who had carried through some major reforms&#151;to pensions, to the National Health Service, and to the benefits system, introducing a cash benefit for all children paid to the mother (child benefit). This was at a period when the government was seeking to impose strict limits on wage increases. The chancellor (Denis Healey) and the prime minister became convinced that the loss of child tax allowances and the reduction in take-home pay this involved would fatally undermine the pay policy. They had been told as much by trade union leaders, they claimed. The cabinet decided to limit drastically the new child benefit scheme. Ennals's first major announcement as secretary of state was the backtracking on this major reform, which was the pride of Barbara Castle. She put on one of her most devastating performances in the House of Commons, attacking his announcement as &#145;an abandonment of one of this Party's major reforms&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5C</span>, 912, 1975&#150;6, 287). The contents of the cabinet discussion were leaked and published in <span class="italic">New Society</span>. This provoked a furious row within the Labour Party, with Barbara Castle leading the attack, and with the opposition able to quote freely from attacks by the Child Poverty Action Group. Ennals also conspicuously failed to implement Castle's policy restricting the number of private pay beds in the National Health Service. Meanwhile, the limits on public-sector pay were increasingly opposed by health service unions. Ennals personally intervened to try to stop ambulance workers ceasing even to meet emergency calls. An agreement was reached with union leaders, but it was rejected by local branches. He himself was ill during much of this period. In March 1979, before he was to meet the unions again, he was taken into Westminster Hospital with leg thrombosis. He was refused tea, mail, and other services by the ancillary workers' union. Only a few weeks later the Labour Party lost the general election called as a result of the no-confidence vote largely prompted by the &#145;winter of discontent&#146;. It was a sad end to such a promising and idealistic ministerial career. Just before leaving office, however, Ennals did appoint the Black committee, whose report on health inequalities was to become a landmark.<br>
<br>Ennals's first marriage ended in divorce in 1977, and on 4 July the same year he married (Katherine) Gene Tranoy (<i>b</i>. 1926/7), a divorced schoolteacher, and daughter of Walter Eugene Wilkins, consultant surgeon. Following the 1979 general election Ennals remained on the back-benches. He lost his seat in the June 1983 election, whereupon he was made a life peer, as Baron Ennals of Norwich. He was for many years his party's health spokesman in the House of Lords, and was a prominent supporter of a wide range of liberal causes. He was chairman of the Gandhi Foundation (1984&#150;95) and of the Children's Medical Charity (1984&#150;95), and president of the Tibet Society (1988&#150;95) and of MIND (1989&#150;95). He died of pancreatic cancer at his home, the Garden Flat, 6 Glenloch Road, Belsize Park, London, on 17 June 1995. He was survived by his second wife and the four children of his first marriage. Phuoc Ky Ennals, a Vietnamese orphan whom Ennals had informally adopted in 1975, predeceased him in 1993, as a result of an accident on an army firing range.<br>
<br>Ennals's elder brother, <a name="cosubject_74782"></a><span class="headword">John Arthur Ford Ennals</span>  (1918&#150;1988), <span class="occ">human rights activist</span>, was born in Walsall on 21 July 1918. He was educated at Queen Mary's Grammar School, Walsall, and St John's College, Cambridge, graduating in history and psychology; he was president of the British Universities League of Nations Society in 1938&#150;9. In 1939&#150;40 he was a lecturer for the British Council in Romania and Yugoslavia, and subsequently was a war correspondent in the Balkans. In 1941 he joined the Foreign Office, serving in Madrid and London, and then from 1943 to 1945 he served with British forces in Egypt, Italy, and Yugoslavia. He was secretary-general of the World Federation of United Nations Associations from 1946 to 1956 (honorary president from 1977), tutor in international relations at Ruskin College, Oxford, from 1956 to 1966, director-general of the United Nations Association from 1966 to 1970 (vice-president from 1978), chairman of the Anti-Apartheid Movement from 1968 to 1976 (following his brother David, who was chairman from 1960 to 1964), and director of the United Kingdom Immigrants Advisory Service from 1970 to 1983. He unsuccessfully contested Walsall South for the Labour Party in 1955 and 1959, and the European parliament constituency of Thames Valley in 1979; for many years he was a parish councillor for Kidlington, Oxfordshire, and then for Hedgerley, Buckinghamshire. He died on 14 September 1988.<br>
<br>Ennals's younger brother, <a name="cosubject_49633"></a><span class="headword">Martin Francis Antony Ennals</span>  (1927&#150;1991), <span class="occ">human rights activist</span>, was born in Walsall on 27 July 1927. He was educated at Queen Mary's Grammar School, Walsall, and the London School of Economics, graduating in international relations. He then worked briefly for the National Union of Students as assistant secretary. On 11 May 1951 he married Jacqueline Betty Morris (<i>b</i>. 1927/8), shorthand typist, daughter of David Morris, schoolteacher; there were one son and one daughter of the marriage. Later in the year he took up a post with UNESCO in Paris, where he was president of the staff association. He returned to England in 1960 to become general secretary of the National Council for Civil Liberties (later renamed Liberty). From 1966 to 1968 he was information officer for the National Committee for Commonwealth Immigrants, in which post he came into direct conflict with the government of which his brother David was a member. He was then secretary-general of Amnesty International from 1968 to 1980, overseeing a period of rapid growth during which the staff of the secretariat grew from nine to 150 and its annual budget from &pound;20,000 to more than &pound;1.6 million. Characteristically, when Amnesty received the Nobel peace prize in 1977, he insisted that a released &#145;prisoner of conscience&#146; should actually accept the award. After leaving Amnesty he was head of the Greater London council's police committee support unit, from 1982 to 1985, but in the latter year he reverted to his interest in international human rights issues by becoming secretary-general of International Alert. He remained with this organization until 1991, when he became Ariel F. Sallows professor of human rights at the University of Saskatchewan, Canada. He died of lung cancer in Saskatoon, Canada, on 5 October 1991, survived by his wife, from whom he was separated, and his two children.<br>
