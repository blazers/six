<span class="headword">Sherring,  Matthew Atmore</span>  (1826&#150;1880), <span class="occ">missionary in India</span>, was born in Halstead, Essex, on 26 September 1826, eldest of the four sons of John Sherring, manufacturer and deacon of the Old Independent Meeting. Initially articled to a surgeon in Colchester, Sherring went on to London University, attending both Coward College (Congregationalist) and University College; he graduated BA in 1848, LLB in 1849, and MA in 1850. A youthful resolve to offer himself to Christ's service was strengthened by the early deaths of two brothers and his father, and he was ordained by the London Missionary Society (LMS) at King's Weigh House Chapel on 7 December 1852. Afterwards he sailed for India to take charge of the LMS mission at Benares. On 5 March 1856 he married Margaret, daughter of Robert Cotton Mather, his colleague at Mirzapur, and eight months later he took charge at Mirzapur while Mather returned to Britain on furlough. Mirzapur remained relatively quiet during the 1857 rebellion and by the time the fighting was over Sherring had put together an account, entitled <span class="italic">The Indian Church during the Great Rebellion</span>, which his father-in-law published in London in 1859. On Mather's return in February 1861 Sherring and his wife went back to their duties at Benares.<br>
<br>Sherring had no illusions about the uphill task facing missionaries in Benares, the most sacred of Hindu cities. His reports home pleaded for understanding of the peculiar difficulties of evangelization in Benares and promoted &#145;indirect&#146; results, meaning his well-publicized debates with Hindu pandits and his work in fostering the popular mission school. He was fascinated by Hindu society and wrote several books which, though denouncing Hinduism, were novel in both insight and detail; they included <span class="italic">The Sacred City of the Hindus</span> (1868) and his <i>magnum opus</i>, the three-volume <span class="italic">Hindu Tribes and Castes</span> (1872&#150;81). Predictably enough, Sherring viewed India's pre-British past as stagnant non-history&#151;an absence of progress which he blamed on the inhibiting nature of caste&#151;but he was nevertheless a sufficiently dispassionate observer for cautious historians to be able still to make use of his books.<br>
<br>Sherring's more conventional publications included: <span class="italic">The History of Protestant Missions in India</span> (1875) and <span class="italic">The Life and Labours of the Rev. William Smith</span> (1879). He had two lengthy trips home in 1866&#150;9 and 1876&#150;8 but was unable to arrest a decline in health. He died of cholera at Benares on 10 August 1880 and was buried there on the same day. He was survived by his widow, who was widely recognized as an equal partner in his evangelical and academic work, and their five children.<br>
