<span class="headword">Dowding <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Albino; <em>other married name </em>Whiting]</span>,  Muriel</span>, Lady Dowding  (1908&#150;1993), <span class="occ">animal rights campaigner</span>, was born on 22 March 1908 at 74 Castellain Mansions, Paddington, the elder of the two daughters of John Angelo (Jack) Albino, goldsmith, and his wife, Hilda Gertrude, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Barnes. After attending St Thomas's School for the sons of gentlemen, in Porchester Terrace&#151;she was the only girl on the roll&#151;she attended Walthamstow Hall, in Sevenoaks, and then the Convent of the Holy Child in Sussex. Although her father had been a Catholic she was influenced by her mother's spiritualist and theosophical views from her teenage years. Interested in astrology and spiritualism, she became a member of the theosophist lodge in Tunbridge Wells&#151;and subsequently its lecture secretary for many years&#151;and, later, a member of the White Eagle lodge run by the spiritualist Grace Cooke. She married her first husband, Jack Maxwell (Max) Whiting, businessman, on 24 August 1935 and their only child, David Maxwell, was born in September 1938. During the Second World War her husband served as a bomber pilot in the RAF, and went missing in action over Norway in May 1944. She contacted <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32884/', "Air Chief Marshal Hugh Caswall Tremenheere Dowding, later first Baron Dowding (1882&#150;1970)")</script>, for information about the circumstances of her husband's mission. Her meeting with Dowding, also a keen spiritualist, led both to their marriage at Caxton Hall on 25 September 1951 and to joint public campaigns on behalf of animals.<br>
<br>Both Dowdings were active anti-vivisectionists. Hugh used his position in the House of Lords to speak against animal experimentation and against the cruel ways in which animals were poisoned in the wild; indeed most of his speeches in the Lords were on animal welfare. Although Muriel was at first reluctant to speak in public she soon became a member of the committee of the Animal Defence and Anti-Vivisection Society, founded by Louise Lind af Hageby, and a council member. She then for many years chaired the National Anti-Vivisection Society (NAVS), and in that role, and later as president of the NAVS, she led demonstrations, presented petitions to parliament, represented the organization at international conferences, and helped to increase the public profile of the anti-vivisectionist cause. Her writing for the NAVS drew attention to the part played by women such as Anna Kingsford and Frances Power Cobbe in earlier campaigns. In 1967 she attempted unsuccessfully to re-unite the NAVS and the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV), the two leading anti-vivisectionist bodies in Britain. The BUAV had broken away in 1898 over disagreements about the best tactics for ending animal experimentation.<br>
<br>In the late 1950s Muriel Dowding, with like-minded friends, founded Beauty without Cruelty, originally to campaign against existing cruel practices in the fashion and cosmetics industry. She helped to publicize the ingredients of cosmetics, in particular the use of whale oil in lipsticks and civet in scent, and the testing of cosmetics and shampoos on animals; she also compiled lists of brands free from cruelty. Beauty without Cruelty held its first official meeting in autumn 1959. Imitating the practice of animal rights campaigners such as Louise Lind af Hageby, Muriel Dowding organized alternative fashion shows in London, New York, and Amsterdam, demonstrating synthetic and cruelty-free alternatives to furs. The Beauty without Cruelty fashion and cosmetic business followed, and boutique premises were obtained in the 1960s. The organization attracted much publicity, helped by the participation of 1960s fashion model and pro-animal activist Celia Hammond.<br>
<br>Hugh Dowding acted as president of Beauty without Cruelty and as patron of the International Association against Painful Experiments. Three years after his death, in February 1970, the Lord Dowding Fund for Humane Research, to promote practical alternatives to animal experiments, was established by the NAVS, as was the annual world day for laboratory animals, on his birthday, 24 April.<br>
<br>Muriel Dowding continued her campaigning work after her husband's death, promoting the fund and speaking at a number of public events. As a participant in a televised debate in November 1970 she declared: &#145;If we can put a man on the moon, surely we are clever enough if we put our minds to it to evolve the alternatives to using animals&#146;  (<span class="italic">Animals' Defender</span>, Jan&#150;Feb 1971, 68&#150;73). In the early 1970s she was described as an indefatigable person who devoted &#145;abounding time and energy to the pursuit of compassion for all living things&#146;  (ibid., editorial). Having for many years taken stray animals into her own home, in 1977 she established the Lychgate Animal Sanctuary in Coldwaltham, Sussex. In November 1979 she received the Richard Martin award of the RSPCA, the society's highest recognition for outstanding service to animal welfare for those not associated with the organization. She continued her high-profile work for the NAVS until incapacitated by a stroke in the 1980s. She died, of heart failure and a brain haemorrhage, at The Pines, Furze Hill, Hove, Sussex, on 20 November 1993. She was survived by the son of her first marriage.<br>
<br>While much of the work of promoting Beauty without Cruelty was undertaken after Hugh Dowding's death the activity of both husband and wife was commemorated on Muriel's death. As a NAVS obituary stated somewhat optimistically, &#145;Both Lord and Lady Dowding were vegetarians and pioneers of a humane movement that we now take for granted&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Campaigner</span>).<br>
