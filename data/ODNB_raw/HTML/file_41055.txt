<span class="headword">Cox,  John Charles</span>  (1843&#150;1919), <span class="occ">antiquary and ecclesiologist</span>, was born on 29 March 1843 at Parwich, Derbyshire, the sixth of the seven children of Revd Edward Cox (1802&#150;1869) and Anna Horsfall (1803/4&#150;1888). He had two brothers and four sisters. In 1843 his father was vicar of Parwich and in 1849 the family moved to Luccombe, Somerset, where his father was initially curate, then rector from 1856. John attended Repton School briefly in 1858, and continued his education at Somersetshire College, Bath. He entered Queen's College, Oxford, in 1862, but left without graduating in 1864&#150;5. In December 1865 he was admitted as a partner in the Wingerworth Coal Company, Derbyshire, through his uncle, Henry Cox. On 23 October 1867 he married a distant cousin, Marian Smith (<i>b</i>. 1840). They had seven sons and three daughters born between 1868 and 1885, and lived at Chevin House, Hazelwood, near Belper, Derbyshire, until 1879.<br>
<br>Cox remained a partner in the coal company until 1885 and also benefited sufficiently from a generous marriage settlement to be financially independent; he was described in the 1871 census as a county magistrate, landowner, and colliery proprietor. Between 1868 and 1875 he aroused controversy as a magistrate giving public support to a number of radical causes. He wrote several political pamphlets at this time, the first being <span class="italic">On the Established Church of Ireland</span> (1868). He was one of the founder members of the Land Tenure Reform Association in 1869. His chairmanship of two riotous meetings in Derby in 1871 and 1873 to which he had invited Sir Charles Dilke led to the lord chancellor's being petitioned (unsuccessfully) to remove him as a JP. He was president of the National Reform Union between at least 1873 and 1874. He stood as a parliamentary candidate for the National Education League at the Bath by-election on 28 June 1873, but withdrew before the poll. He also stood for Dewsbury as a radical Liberal at the general election of February 1874, when he secured 47 per cent of the votes; a local song, <span class="italic">The Death of J. C. Cox</span> (1874), commemorated his failure. Much of his energy at this time was devoted towards helping agricultural labourers. He was the most active member of the consultative committee of middle-class supporters of the National Agricultural Labourers' Union, founded in 1872, and developed a close friendship with Joseph Arch, president of the union. With his brother Henry Fisher Cox, he wrote a series of articles for <span class="italic">The Examiner</span> on &#145;The rise of the farm labourer&#146; (1872&#150;3), and the two brothers financed Arch's newspaper, the <span class="italic">English Labourer</span>, first published in June 1875. His involvement as a JP with the union was raised in the House of Commons on 25 March 1873, and he was summoned before the Farringdon magistrates on 15 April 1873 for obstruction when chairing one of its meetings.<br>
<br>Despite his early enthusiasm for disestablishment, Cox considered himself a churchman. After attending Lichfield College in 1879, he was ordained deacon in the Church of England in 1880 and priest in 1881. He was appointed curate of Christ Church, Lichfield, in 1880, and of Enville, Staffordshire, in 1883. He became rector of Barton-le-Street, Yorkshire, in 1886 and then of Holdenby, Northamptonshire (1893&#150;1900). Some of his sermons were published, but he was best known in this period for his writings as a local historian, particularly of Derbyshire. His most substantial work was his earliest, &#145;Notes on the churches of Derbyshire&#146;, based on articles published anonymously in the <span class="italic">Derbyshire Times</span> in 1871&#150;3, but enlarged to four volumes between 1875 and 1879. Cox was a fellow of the Royal Historical Society by 1873; he was awarded the Lambeth degree of doctor of laws in 1885 for his work on the records of the dean and chapter of Lichfield, and was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1887. He wrote more than thirty articles for the journal of the Derbyshire Archaeological Society, and was its editor from 1885 to 1891. He also edited two national journals, <span class="italic">The Reliquary</span> (1887&#150;1909) and <span class="italic">The Antiquary</span> (1888&#150;94). While in Yorkshire he helped found and was first president of the East Riding Antiquarian Society. In 1899, as chairman of the Brixworth Board of Guardians, he gave a paper in favour of old-age pensions&#151;recalling his long interest in social issues&#151;to the Annual Poor Law Conference.<br>
<br>In 1900 Cox moved to Sydenham, Kent, and concentrated on writing. His later works established him as the leading authority on the English medieval parish church, and he was highly regarded for the breadth of his knowledge and the thoroughness of his historical research. A lucid writer in the nineteenth-century discursive tradition, Cox was so prodigious in his output that some of his works are rightly criticized for lacking accuracy and finish. The British Library catalogue contains about eighty references under his name. He contributed to numerous magazines, newspapers, and local and national archaeological journals. He was on the advisory council for the <span class="roman">Victoria History of the Counties of England</span> and compiled the sections on religious houses, ecclesiastical history, and forestry in thirteen volumes (1903&#150;8). He edited for Methuen the series of the <span class="roman">Antiquary's Books</span> (1904&#150;11) and also wrote several of them, notably <span class="italic">Parish Registers of England</span> (1909). He was the author of nine of Methuen's <span class="roman">Little Guides</span> to English counties (1903&#150;16), and five of the <span class="roman">County Churches</span> series published by George Allen (1910&#150;13). Cox's <span class="italic">How to Write a History of a Parish</span> (1879) was one of his most popular works, and reached five editions by 1909. His <span class="italic">English Parish Church</span> (1914) was the recognized handbook on the subject for many years.<br>
<br>Cox loved ancient ritual and the medieval church, and was indignant about the iconoclasm of the Reformation. He caused a considerable stir when he was received into the Roman Catholic Church on 25 April 1917 in the church of St Benedict, Stratton on the Fosse, Somerset, by the Revd Ethelbert Horne, OSB, of Downside Abbey. He suffered a cerebral haemorrhage at his home, 13 Longton Avenue, Sydenham, in November 1918, and died in the Brooklyn Nursing Home, Beckenham, on 23 February 1919. He was buried from the church of Our Lady and St Philip Neri, Sydenham, at Elmers End cemetery, Beckenham, on 28 February 1919.<br>
