<span class="headword">Buckley <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Fisher]</span>,  Arabella Burton</span>  (1840&#150;1929), <span class="occ">popularizer of science and writer</span>, was born on 24 October 1840 in Brighton, the daughter of John Wall Buckley, vicar of St Mary's, Paddington Green, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1889), daughter of Thomas Burton; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32158/', "Henry Burton Buckley, first Baron Wrenbury (1845&#150;1935)")</script>, was her brother. Little is known of her education and early life. An authoritative popularizer of science, and from 1864 to 1875 secretary to Sir Charles Lyell (for whose entry in the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> she wrote the expert's addendum), she was personally familiar with the leading scientists and scientific theories of her day. She lectured on natural science from 1876 until 1888, was editor of Mary Somerville's <span class="italic">Connexion of the Physical Sciences</span> (1877) and Heinrich Leutemann's <span class="italic">Animals from Life</span> (1887), and produced a set of botanical tables for the use of junior students (1876). In her own first book, <span class="italic">A Short History of Natural Science</span> (1876), she recalled that she &#145;often felt very forcibly how many important facts and generalizations of science, which are of great value &hellip; in giving a true estimate of life and its conditions, [were] totally unknown to the majority of otherwise well-educated persons&#146;  (pp. vii&#150;viii). Her <span class="italic">Short History</span> was intended &#145;to supply that modest amount of scientific information which everyone ought to possess, while, at the same time &hellip; form a useful groundwork for those who wish afterwards to study any special branch of science&#146;  (p. viii) and as such was praised by Charles Darwin. On 6 March 1884 she married Thomas Fisher MD (1819/20&#150;1895), a widower twenty years her senior.<br>
<br>Although Arabella Buckley also wrote a <span class="italic">History of England for Beginners</span> (1887), traditional history never gave full scope to her distinctive penchant for narrative, which was better exercised in her books retelling the story of evolution. Grounded in evolutionary theory and in all aspects of the new geology, she re-created this knowledge in two popular books whose narratives are highly imaginative, <span class="italic">Life and her Children</span> (1881) and <span class="italic">Winners in Life's Race</span> (1883). In them Buckley presented seven divisions of life: <span class="italic">Life and her Children</span> covers the first six, from the amoebas to the insects, and <span class="italic">Winners in Life's Race</span> is entirely devoted to the seventh, the &#145;great backboned family&#146;.<br>
<br>Buckley was one of a small number of nineteenth-century Darwinians who realized the deficiencies in Darwin's thinking with regard to the development of moral qualities in the animal kingdom, set out in his discussion of &#145;social instincts&#146; in <span class="italic">The Descent of Man</span> (1871). Darwin had observed the competitive advantage species can gain from a well-developed social instinct but had difficulty in explaining its evolution, particularly with respect to parental affections for their offspring. Far from being daunted by this aspect of evolution, Buckley made parents' care for their offspring central to her books on evolution and continued Darwin's observations with far greater emphasis on mutuality. For her the <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> for evolution was not just the preservation of life, but the development of altruism as well.<br>
<br>Buckley's work is concurrent with Karl Kessler's &#145;On the law of mutual aid&#146; (1880), the lecture which stimulated Peter Kropotkin to re-examine Darwin. Kessler died in 1881, the year that saw the publication of Buckley's <span class="italic">Life and her Children</span>; it then took Kropotkin ten years to challenge Thomas Henry Huxley over the importance of mutual aid in the pages of <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span>, and another ten to formulate his classic <span class="italic">Mutual Aid: a Factor in Evolution</span> (1902). Meanwhile, Buckley's last book, <span class="italic">Moral Teachings of Science</span> (1891), was devoted to this idea and written to unite science and philosophy&#151;to study morality from &#145;within outward&#146; and &#145;without inward&#146;  (p. 4). For Buckley, &#145;these [were] not really two, but only different methods of arriving at one result, namely, the knowledge of laws by which we and all the rest of nature are governed&#146;  (p. 5).<br>
<br>Buckley was deeply aware of the nature of science writing and realized that science, though based in fact or experiment, was transmitted as a literary construction. Two other books, <span class="italic">The Fairy-Land of Science</span> (1879, reissued in a number of late nineteenth-century editions) and its sequel, <span class="italic">Through Magic Glasses</span> (1890), demonstrate her skill at telling the stories of science. In <span class="italic">Fairy-Land</span> Buckley generated interest in her scientific subjects by borrowing the language of fairy stories and wizardry to reinforce her ultimate belief that the wonders of science not only paralleled but surpassed the wonders of fairyland. In its sequel, <span class="italic">Through Magic Glasses</span>, she focused more closely on what childlike eyes can see, calling on the help of the telescope, stereoscope, photographic camera, and microscope, and a fictional guide, a magician into whose chamber the reader immediately enters and through whose eyes the world is viewed. Her last work showed the same concern with vision and the visible and was written for Cassell's series <span class="roman">Eyes and No Eyes</span> (1901&#150;24). Buckley died of influenza at her home, 3 Boburg Terrace, Sidmouth, Devon, on 9 February 1929.<br>
