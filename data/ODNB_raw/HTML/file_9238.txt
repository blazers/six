<span class="headword">Fearn,  John</span>  (1768&#150;1837), <span class="occ">philosopher</span>, was born of Scottish descent and of parents not only of excellent virtues, but descended &#145;sufficiently well&#146;. He was a &#145;self-taught metaphysician&#146;, a fact that was to count against him in his later philosophical conflicts. In early life Fearn spent two years as a midshipman on HMS <i>Royal George</i> until the conclusion of the American War of Independence in 1783, and voyaged in the Pacific, where he saw the &#145;savage life&#146;, a field in which he believed a philosopher could gain some very valuable instruction. He also claimed to have discovered some small islands. During this period he held a number of posts in &#145;interior regions&#146; and led a comparatively idle life, with hunting as his main occupation. His only companion was a copy of John Locke's <span class="italic">Essay on Human Understanding</span>, from which he claimed his natural inclination for reflection was strengthened, although he was to deny being either a disciple or a follower of Locke.<br>
<br>Fearn married his first wife, Aeueasiua (<i>d</i>. 1807?), daughter of Colonel Mackay of Brighouse, in Edinburgh on 31 May 1806. The couple had one daughter, Aeueasiua Mackay Fearn, baptized on 22 October 1807. Fearn's second marriage, on 20 October 1808 to Harriet, daughter of Philip William Thomas, a Quaker stockbroker of Highbury Grove, soon collapsed and the couple separated, as Harriet's affections were engaged elsewhere; she later gave birth to an illegitimate daughter, whom Fearn refused to acknowledge as his child. The family feud that followed led to a campaign of vilification against the philosopher, which included &#145;street-blackguardism&#146; by his father-in-law. While these events were regarded by Fearn as a &#145;striking example of the structure of mind&#146;  (<span class="roman">will</span>, TNA: PRO, PROB 11/1887, fols. 275&#150;279<i>v</i>), they were not accepted in a wholly philosophical light and may well have been the cause of Fearn's frequent and prolonged bouts of ill health and somewhat irascible temper.<br>
<br>Having relinquished the improvement of his fortune, and being sufficiently wealthy to devote himself to philosophical disputes, Fearn found himself opposed to many elements of the Scottish school and to materialism in particular, which he claimed inevitably led to atheistic beliefs, but he was no transcendentalist and stated that his writings were based upon induction as a labourer in the science of pneumatology. In his religion he was conventional and saw visible proof of God's existence in the world, although in his will he claimed, as a good philosopher, to have tested the precepts of the &#145;Divine mission and mediation of Christ Jesus&#146; sufficiently to sustain a belief in the afterlife, in which he hoped to have some small office.<br>
<br>Fearn was the author of some twelve books, of which the most notable were <span class="italic">First Lines of the Human Mind</span> (1820), <span class="italic">Anti-Tooke, or, An analysis of the principles and structure of language exemplified in the English tongue</span> (2 vols., 1827), and <span class="italic">A Rationale of the Laws of Cerebral Vision</span> (1830). He regarded himself, and was regarded, as something of an outsider in the philosophical world. He believed that his ideas were undervalued mainly owing to his lack of an academic background and that his country had been to him an &#145;unfeeling stepmother&#146;. He held to the view that a natural maturity of understanding was best obtained before the mind had been tampered with by schemes of philosophy, whether ancient or modern. Emphasizing the value to the philosopher of the solitary life, he refused to submit to the &#145;bonds&#146; of patronage, although he was encouraged in his speculations by Dr Samuel Parr. Fearn discussed most of the important questions of metaphysics, to no great end, either in his own apprehension or in any philosophical recognition by his contemporaries. In later life rejection by the philosophical and scientific community led him to rail against the prevailing &#145;philosophical despotism&#146; of the age.<br>
<br>Believing that the philosopher wielding the &#145;weapon of truth &hellip; will give him[self] dignity&#146;  (Barker, 1.630), Fearn came into conflict with a number of contemporaries in print, most notably Dugald Stewart on vision, Sir David Brewster on optics, Horne Tooke on matters of linguistics, and Lady Mary Shepherd on perception. While Fearn gradually revised his views throughout his life he believed the fields of philosophy, theology, and linguistics were connected and that the second was only possible on the basis of the first, while the third was to be used to bring attention to the problem of the external world in the first two. Influenced by English empiricism, and particularly Locke, in addition to the Scottish philosophy he so much decried, Fearn critically examined the views of Berkeley, Hume, Thomas Reid, and Dugald Stewart. Proudly belonging to no &#145;philosophical sect&#146;, he claimed his speculations were &#145;the result of the most solitary, considered and uncommunicated course of thinking, that was ever followed&#146;  (<span class="italic">An Appeal to Philosophers by Name on the Demonstration of Vision in the Brain and Against the Attack by Sir David Brewster on the Rationale of Cerebral Vision</span>, 1837). All of Fearn's work dealt in some way with the problem of perception which was based upon his laws of vision. The latter led him into a conflict of priority with the Scottish philosopher Dugald Stewart when Fearn claimed that Stewart had held different principles of vision until he had read Fearn's <span class="italic">Essay on Consciousness</span> (1812), an unsolicited copy of which he had sent to Stewart. Some years later Stewart had apparently changed his mind on the matter and began to maintain the principles of Fearn, but he refused to acknowledge Fearn's priority. Fearn attempted to solicit the support of Dr Samuel Parr and Charles Babbage  (J. Fearn to Charles Babbage, 6 Oct 1832, BL, Add. MS 37187, fol. 161) in this matter and while some commentators did concede originality to Fearn, it was denied by others. The consequences of his failed marriage, as well as his lack of recognition by his peers, cast a blight on Fearn's later life. He died on 3 December 1837 of a &#145;decay of nature&#146; at his home, 32 Sloane Street, Chelsea, London.<br>
