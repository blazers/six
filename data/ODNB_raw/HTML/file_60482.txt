<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Smith,  Brian  Abel-</span>  (1926&#150;1996), <span class="occ">economist and social policy analyst</span>, was born on 6 November 1926 at 24 Kensington Court Gardens, London, the younger son of Brigadier-General Lionel Abel Abel-Smith (1870&#150;1946), officer in the Royal Artillery, and his wife, Genevieve Lilac, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Walsh, daughter of Robert Walsh, of Armagh. Through his kinsman Sir Henry Abel-Smith, who was married to Queen Mary's niece Lady May Cambridge, he was distantly related to the royal family. Friends wickedly introduced him as twenty-seventh in line to the crown. Along with his erect bearing and extraordinarily acute command of the skills of diplomacy, that connection seemed to make his embrace of socialism all the more impressive and influential.<br>
<br>Abel-Smith was educated at Haileybury College from 1940 to 1945, before entering the army as a private. He was commissioned in the Oxford and Buckinghamshire light infantry in 1946 and was aide-de-camp to the military governor of the British zone in Austria during 1947&#150;8. He then entered Clare College, Cambridge, where he studied economics from 1948 to 1951. He remained at Cambridge for a further two years to study the cost of the National Health Service (NHS); he was awarded his doctorate in 1955. He served his research apprenticeship from 1953 to 1955 at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, and at the London School of Economics (LSE) with Professor Richard Titmuss, collecting evidence about the cost of the NHS for the Guillebaud committee. His academic career at the LSE took him from assistant lecturer in 1955 to lecturer in 1957, reader in social administration in 1961, and full professor in 1965. He retired in 1991. In 1968&#150;70 he became senior adviser to the secretary of state for social services, Dick Crossman, was reappointed to a similar post in 1974&#150;8 by Barbara Castle and then David Ennals, and in 1978&#150;9 was the special adviser to the secretary of state for the environment, Peter Shore. During 1960&#150;73 he served on government committees dealing with both health and social security, played a key practical role on the boards of regional and teaching hospital management committees, such as St Thomas's Hospital, and from 1956 until his death was consultant and expert adviser to the World Health Organization (WHO) in its work in many countries.<br>
<br>Some great people are insufficiently appreciated in their lifetime&#151;and among them are those who avoid the limelight quite deliberately. Abel-Smith matched sheer brilliance and assurance with genuine modesty. His contributions to international health and health services, social policy, government administration, and politics read like the considerable careers of four separate people, equally intriguing and displaying enviable versatility.<br>
<br>First, health: it was the NHS that earned Abel-Smith's particular devotion. More than anyone he explained the reasons for its existence&#151;and how it had to be adapted to new circumstances. His early books, <span class="italic">The Cost of the Health Service in England and Wales</span>, with Richard Titmuss (1956), <span class="italic">A History of the Nursing Profession</span> (1960), <span class="italic">Paying for Health Services</span> (1963), and <span class="italic">The Hospitals, 1800&#150;1948</span> (1964), established a formidable case for a comprehensive public service and remained among the best books on the subject that any student could read. His contribution to better health services was sustained for another thirty years. Twenty-five of his 37 books, and 98 of his 166 published articles and papers were on health. Influential examples from his middle and later years were: <span class="italic">An International Study of Health Expenditure</span> (1967), <span class="italic">Value for Money in Health Services</span> (1976), <span class="italic">National Health Service: the First 30 Years</span> (1978), <span class="italic">The Organisation, Financing and Cost of Health Care in the European Community</span> (1979), <span class="italic">Planning the Finances of the Health Sector</span> (1984), and <span class="italic">An Introduction to Health: Policy, Planning and Financing</span> (1994).<br>
<br>Abel-Smith's work for the Guillebaud committee marked the start of the unrivalled lifelong contribution he made to improvements in health care. Set up by the Conservative government in 1952, this committee, chaired by Claude Guillebaud, an economist who had been Iain MacLeod's tutor at Cambridge, was asked to investigate what at the time was believed to be the uncontrolled rising cost imposed on the exchequer by the NHS and whether this could be avoided while maintaining an adequate service. Abel-Smith showed that, far from rising, the cost of the NHS was in fact falling as a share of gross national product. If the same share of national resources had been devoted to the NHS in 1953 as in its first full year of 1949, expenditure would have been &pound;67 million, or one-sixth higher. The committee confessed themselves unable to make a case for new or higher charges. Instead they recommended increases in expenditure, including capital investment to improve the service. &#145;In large measure&#146;, as one authority testified, &#145;Guillebaud spiked the Treasury guns&#146;  (Timmins, 207).<br>
<br>Abel-Smith's investigation has been described as &#145;a minor classic of modern social analysis&#146;  (Webster, 207). It provided the basis for his subsequent book with Richard Titmuss (also drawn from Abel-Smith's doctorate), <span class="italic">The Cost of the National Health Service in England and Wales</span> (1951). His work on health became vigorously cross-national and, through the WHO, he visited a stream of poor countries&#151;starting with Mauritius in the 1950s and ending with Indonesia in 1995. This was matched during the same period by his repeated visits around Europe. He influenced overseas developments in health care even more than in his own country. After his death the Mauritius government issued a set of commemorative stamps to mark his contribution to the establishment of the country's health service.<br>
<br>Second, Abel-Smith's contribution to social policy: as an economist he also developed a parallel interest in anti-poverty policies, starting when writing his doctorate on health at Cambridge University. This shaped his contribution to social policy. He began to write extensively, sometimes with Peter Townsend, on poverty, pensions, and social security. They collaborated in writing together as well as independently for eighteen years on these three themes. Their book <span class="italic">The Poor and the Poorest</span> (1965) has been highlighted as marking &#145;the rediscovery of poverty&#146; in the UK after people had come to believe that the introduction of post-war welfare measures had resolved pre-war poverty and many other long-standing social problems. The book was based on a new method of constructing a poverty line to track the value of government policies. The method was to specify and assemble the weekly rates of social assistance to which families of different size and composition were entitled as an implicit measure of what the state actually defined as the income required to meet their needs, and then compare these with their actual income (and expenditure). By that standard poverty had increased in the 1950s. The extent of poverty was also shown to be larger than that described by Seebohm Rowntree, in his third book on the subject, <span class="italic">Poverty and the Welfare State</span> (1951). Rowntree's conclusions were found to be over-optimistic and his data less reliable than in his previous investigations of the subject. Abel-Smith and Townsend's <span class="italic">The Poor and the Poorest</span> was not just a report drawn from official sources about trends in poverty. It was credited with influencing Labour government thinking in the 1960s and 1970s on social policies generally.<br>
<br>Abel-Smith had that rare ability of combining penetrating mastery of Keynesian (and later monetarist or neo-liberal) theory with detailed understanding of how the welfare state works in administrative practice. He embodied all the strengths of what was taught about the welfare state at the London School of Economics. His early contribution, &#145;Whose welfare state?&#146;, to a book called <span class="italic">Conviction</span> (1958) had as much of an impact in later years as it did when it was published.<br>
<br>Abel-Smith's wider command of social policy included legal institutions. His capacity for penetrating, indeed adventurous, analysis led to one of the most original contributions to the role of law of the twentieth century. His book with Robert Stevens, <span class="italic">Lawyers and the Courts</span> (1967), was a sociological study of the English legal system from 1750 to 1965 which showed its social origins and mode of control and helped to make an unanswerable case for root-and-branch modernization. The sequel, <span class="italic">In Search of Justice</span> (1968), demonstrated the failings of the legal system as a social service and, had the book attracted the attention it deserved, might have led to some of the changes still required in the early twenty-first century.<br>
<br>Abel-Smith's third contribution, to government, was less well known than his contributions to academic social science, but none the less intriguing. Cabinet ministers grew to depend on his total discretion and, unusually for an academic, he earned glowing tributes from career civil servants. His top advisory appointments to successive cabinet ministers&#151;Dick Crossman, Barbara Castle, David Ennals, and Peter Shore&#151;provided glittering opportunities to influence legislation, but also had costs for his academic research career. He was also too much of a socialist to accept a life peerage. Barbara Castle paid high tribute to his experience and skill. He was &#145;the most outstanding&#146; of the specialists on whom she could draw; and possessed &#145;an unparalleled mastery of the details of social policy&#146;  (Castle, <span class="italic">Fighting All the Way</span>, 461).<br>
<br>Finally, in the political domain, as government adviser he concealed his regret at not entering a career in politics. He gave the Fabian Society a modern social influence and served it for many years as treasurer and vice-president. For thirty-one years, except when he was a senior adviser to government, and until they were both elected vice-presidents, he and Townsend were elected annually to the executive committee of the Fabian Society. He wrote influential pamphlets on social security and health and, with Peter Townsend in 1955, on the future of pensions: <span class="italic">New Pensions for the Old</span>. This was picked up by Dick Crossman, who persuaded Hugh Gaitskell and later Harold Wilson to invite Abel-Smith and Townsend, with Richard Titmuss&#151;a trio described by the then Conservative minister of pensions as the Labour Party's &#145;skiffle group&#146;&#151;to prepare a new detailed plan for national superannuation, published and endorsed at the party's annual conference in 1957. This was the basis of the bill that fell during its parliamentary committee stages when the election was called in 1970 and of the bill eventually passed in 1975. In 1970 Crossman described Abel-Smith as &#145;my closest personal friend &hellip; without [whom] I could have done very little in the past two years&#146;  (Crossman, 921). Although Titmuss had the policy judgement and Townsend had some of the necessary sociological knowledge of family living conditions, it was Abel-Smith who had the economic skill and dexterity to make this a visionary as well as a politically appealing plan for the late twentieth century.<br>
<br>Abel-Smith had been picked out by Hugh Dalton, a former chancellor of the exchequer, as someone with a potentially glittering political future, especially in the Treasury. Nevertheless he refused to apply for safe seats, more because of the risk of public humiliation if he was discovered to be homosexual than anything else. In the less censorious climate of the 1990s and 2000s his political gifts would have been regarded as nationally precious. When he was working for Barbara Castle she happened to appoint Jack Straw as political adviser. &#145;Let me be clear&#146;, she said to Straw, &#145;I have appointed Brian for his brilliance. I have appointed you for your low cunning.&#146; At the end of her cabinet career she wrote that &#145;Brian's steady, informed and perceptive help is a tower of strength&#146;  (<span class="italic">Castle Diaries</span>, 721).<br>
<br>As a socialist Abel-Smith appreciated the importance not just of creating public institutions but of standing by them through thick and thin in a practical capacity. He played a big part in the foundation of the Child Poverty Action Group. In the early 1960s he and Townsend, with others, had been giving early warnings about the extent of poverty among different groups, and they anticipated some of the findings of <span class="italic">The Poor and the Poorest</span> in articles and pamphlets in 1962 and 1963. An apparent lack of response from the new Labour government in 1964 and early 1965 led to meetings between social workers and academics who were having everyday experiences interviewing and trying to help people in poverty. The decision to set up a campaigning group and to use the publication of <span class="italic">The Poor and the Poorest</span> in December 1965 as a rallying message was taken. It was a build-up fomented by the two authors, working with others, including Tony Lynes and Harriet Wilson, during the critical months from February 1965 to the end of that year. Abel-Smith gave a speech to the Society of Friends at Toynbee Hall in March which crystallized intentions. Another practical role for Abel-Smith was as governor of St Thomas's Hospital for many years. He helped to shape the policies and management of this internationally famous teaching hospital. Most importantly he supported the cause of social policy at the London School of Economics, and played a key part administratively for more than three decades. By the end of the century the department of social policy had been ranked as the leading department in the country on the subject.<br>
<br>Affordable but adequate welfare, detailed planning on behalf of the underdog, universal public services&#151;these were Abel-Smith's cardinal values, reflected in one of his last published essays, published in <span class="italic">LSE on Social Science: a Centenary Anthology</span> (1996). Even more than Titmuss, he saved the National Health Service in its early days from savage spending cuts; it was his resolute defence of the advantages of making health a truly public service that saved the NHS from being weakened irretrievably. He was also the powerful figure, within government administration, behind a list of measures on pensions, disability allowances, and community care, as well as health services, which did much to make Britain a more settled and less divided country in the 1960s and 1970s than it later became.<br>
<br>Abel-Smith's wit could be discomfiting, and could be applied with devastating, but also fundamentally constructive, effects. One evening in the 1960s he unravelled the reputation of Nightingale nurses with a group of them. They were never the same again. He revered Florence Nightingale but showed that some of her ideas had been applied dogmatically or misinterpreted both in her lifetime and later; and had led to a stiff and autocratic regime. To improve standards and obtain public support Florence Nightingale had &#145;popularised nursing as an occupation for ladies&#146;  (Abel-Smith, <span class="italic">A History of the Nursing Profession</span>, 1960, 241). She created upper-class missionaries who had to prove they were chaste, so that parents of other young ladies would encourage their daughters to become nurses. However, these ladies subsequently sought status and power for women like themselves instead of spreading the advantages of adequate basic one-year training, which Nightingale wanted to establish for women generally. They pulled up the ladder. They became medical mercenaries and imposed a socially distant and inflexible regime for patients in the mass.<br>
<br>Deeply radical people have an ability to analyse individuals like Florence Nightingale, who are almost mythical figures, and turn them into recognizable human beings. Along with Barbara Wootton, Abel-Smith was a relatively neglected creative genius of post-war social policy in Britain. Perhaps this was because he was both a distinguished social scientist and a politician <i>manqu&eacute;</i>, perhaps because he was unreservedly loyal to Titmuss and to the department at the LSE leading the analysis of the maturing welfare state.<br>
<br>Abel-Smith created a wonderful garden in his home in Kent with John Sarbutt, and was a fine cook, as well as skier and raconteur. He died of carcinoma of the pancreas at his home in London, 10 Denbigh Street, Westminster, on 4 April 1996.<br>
