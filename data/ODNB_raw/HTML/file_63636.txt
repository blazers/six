<span class="headword">Alexander,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1742?, <em>d.</em> 1788?), <span class="occ">physician and author</span>, was probably the son of William Alexander and Elizabeth Allanson of Halifax who was baptized at Halifax on 6 January 1742; much about his life remains obscure. In the 1760s he attended medical classes at the University of Edinburgh including those of William Cullen in chemistry and James Russell in natural philosophy. By then he had already seen service with the Surrey militia, and he appears to have practised in Edinburgh for some years before taking his MD in 1769. On 26 January 1765 he was admitted to the Medical Society of Edinburgh and on 28 December 1766 he married Eliza Thomson in the college kirk, Edinburgh. By 1768 he had moved to London, where in that year he published his <span class="italic">Experimental Essays</span>, in which he described experiments he had conducted in Edinburgh and London, in a &#145;free and liberal spirit of enquiry&#146; in opposition to &#145;blind deference to rules&#146;  (W. Alexander, <span class="italic">Experimental Essays</span>, 1768, vi&#150;vii). His <span class="italic">Experimental Enquiry concerning the causes which have generally been said to produce putrid diseases</span> (1771) details experiments conducted with &#145;the stinking water of the North Loch&#146; and from other marshes and locations around Edinburgh, and in London  (W. Alexander, <span class="italic">An Experimental Enquiry</span>, 1771, 65&#150;73). On 16 October 1771 he married for a second time, at Haughton-le-Skerne, co. Durham; his second wife was the widowed Elizabeth Bendlowes.<br>
<br>The tone of Alexander's medical writing is of an impatience with inherited wisdom, an urgent preoccupation with experiment, and an insistence on investigation. His range of interests, in natural history, in medical science, and in travel literature, placed him at the heart of new approaches to the &#145;natural history of man&#146; pioneered by Claude Buffon. His best-known work, the <span class="italic">History of Women</span> (1779), draws upon these interests but also deserves to take a place among Enlightenment histories of civil society. Though Alexander clearly knew and was influenced by Montesquieu and the <i>encyclop&eacute;distes</i>, it was to contemporary Scottish historians such as John Millar, Lord Kames, and Gilbert Stuart that he owed his greatest debts. Like them, he attempted to place the history of women and gender roles firmly within the history of civil society, though he also perpetuated their disagreements and inconsistencies. The <span class="italic">History</span> is long, rambling, and inconsistent, and omits any scholarly references. In it, Alexander drew widely and indiscriminately upon biblical history, theological studies, classical and medieval histories, and travel literature to construct narratives of women's employment, marriage, child-rearing patterns, customs and ceremonies, and the status and public power of women. He explored the relative influences of nature, or biology, and education, or environment, in shaping the manners of women; the potential for the moral corruption of nations in the absence of female chastity; the relationship between the progress of &#145;civilization&#146; and the condition of women; and the distinctive characteristics of both &#145;northern&#146; and British women. On the whole Alexander was inclined to give little weight to the influence of Christianity in the improvement of the condition of women, and there is an anti-Catholic and anti-clerical tinge to much of his discussion. The work received broadly favourable reviews, although the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> criticized his treatment of the women of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> judged it frivolous, inelegant, and obscene, entirely inappropriate for female readers. Alexander appears to have made some amendments to meet these comments in the third edition of 1782. The work was sufficiently successful to be translated into German in 1780&#150;81, and into French in 1791.<br>
<br>Very little is known of Alexander's last years. He was admitted as a non-resident fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh on 3 November 1783, when his address was given as London. Obituaries vary on his date of death; it is not clear whether he can be identified with the Dr Alexander who kept an academy in Hampstead and died in Margate on 9 September 1788.<br>
