<span class="headword">Dillwyn,  Lewis Weston</span>  (1778&#150;1855), <span class="occ">naturalist and porcelain manufacturer</span>, was born on 21 August 1778 at St Thomas's Square, Hackney, the son of William Dillwyn (1743?&#150;1824), merchant, of Higham Lodge, Walthamstow, and his wife, Sarah, daughter of Lewis Weston of Highall, Essex. He was descended from a Welsh Quaker family who had emigrated to Pennsylvania at the end of the seventeenth century. His father, who was born and lived much of his life in America, was a prominent campaigner against slavery. He received his early education at a Friends' school at Tottenham, where he became acquainted with his lifelong friend, Joseph Woods (1776&#150;1864), with whom he was sent to Folkestone on account of his then weak health. In 1798 he went to Dover and there began his study of plants. He became a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1800 and subsequently reported to it on his observations.<br>
<br>In 1802 Dillwyn's father bought the Cambrian pottery at Swansea, placing him at its head, and in 1803 he moved there from Walthamstow. He began publishing his principal botanical work, the <span class="italic">Natural History of British Confervae</span> in 1802, and in 1805 he and Dawson Turner published the <span class="italic">Botanist's Guide through England and Wales</span>. His interest in natural history was turned to good account in business, and his porcelain became celebrated for the true and spirited paintings on it of butterflies, flowers, birds, and shells, besides the beauty of the material itself. It attained its greatest renown about 1814, after which its production was abandoned for ordinary earthenware, the staple product of the works.<br>
<br>In 1807 Dillwyn married Mary Adams (1776&#150;1865), the natural daughter of John Llewelyn of Penlle'r-gaer, Llangyfelach, Glamorgan; she retained her mother's surname. They had three sons and three daughters. Their son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45563/', "John Dillwyn Llewelyn (1810&#150;1882)")</script> was a photographer and experimental scientist, who worked with Sir Charles Wheatstone on the experiments on the submarine electric telegraph made in Swansea Bay in 1844. Their son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47114/', "Lewis Llewelyn Dillwyn MP (1814&#150;1892)")</script> was a prominent Welsh Liberal. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37358/', "Amy Dillwyn")</script>, successful businesswoman and colourful feminist, was one of their grandchildren. Although Dillwyn obliged to leave the Society of Friends for marrying a non-Quaker, his younger son was seen as continuing in the tradition of Quaker political radicalism.<br>
<br>Dillwyn was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1804. In 1809 he toured Killarney, Ireland. He kept a diary of his observations on natural history there. In the same year he completed his <span class="italic">British Confervae</span>. Eight years later in 1817, he brought out <span class="italic">A Descriptive Catalogue of British Shells</span>. He was a good friend of Sir Joseph Banks, whose library he used to prepare his book on shells. In 1823 his <span class="italic">Index to the Historia conchyliorum of Lister</span> was printed at the Oxford Clarendon Press at the cost of the university, which on this occasion offered him the honorary degree of DCL, which he declined. In 1823 and 1824 he sent Sir Humphrey Davy, president of the Royal Society, his observations on fossil shells and his ideas about the &#145;relative periods at which the different families of testaceous animals appear to have been created&#146;  (Royal Society Archives, PT 17. 12). These were subsequently published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>.<br>
<br>Dillwyn was returned in 1832 to the first parliament to sit after the <span class="roman">Reform Act</span> as member for Glamorgan, of which he had been a magistrate for some years, and high sheriff in 1818. He supported the whigs and was not sympathetic to calls for further constitutional reform. The freedom of the borough of Swansea was presented to him in 1834, and from 1835 to 1840 he served as alderman and mayor. He gave up parliamentary duties in 1837.<br>
<br>As a prominent local manufacturer and MP Dillwyn supported local causes, donating some of the profits from his <span class="italic">Contributions towards a History of Swansea</span> (1840) to Swansea Infirmary. He cordially welcomed the British Association to Swansea in 1848, was one of the vice-presidents of that meeting, and produced for the occasion his <span class="italic">Flora and Fauna of Swansea</span>. This was his last literary production; his health gradually declined, and for some years before his death he withdrew from outside pursuits. He died at his home, Sketty Hall, Glamorgan, on 31 August 1855.<br>
