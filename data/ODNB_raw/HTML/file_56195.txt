<span class="headword">Houlding,  John</span>  (1833?&#150;1902), <span class="occ">brewer and football club sponsor</span>, was born in Tenterden Street, off Scotland Road, Liverpool, probably in 1833, the year his father, Thomas Houlding, established himself there as a cow keeper and dairyman. His parents came from Lancashire farming stock.<br>
<br>Educated at the Church of England school in Bond Street, Houlding spent a year at Liverpool College before taking a job as office boy in a firm of shipbrokers, although only eleven and a half years old. Over the next two years he made good progress, but his father's cows were stricken by cattle disease and when only three remained John had to give up his job to look after them while his father took better-paid work in a brewery. Houlding later worked as a porter at the Liverpool Exchange until his father helped him obtain a position as labourer and drayman at a brewer's in Soho Street delivering beer to public houses for &pound;1 a week. This lasted for about four years when the brewer employed by the firm left and John Houlding was appointed in his place in January 1856. A rent-free house went with the job, and marriage soon followed, on 20 July of the same year, together with a pay increase of 5<i>s</i>. a week. His wife was Jane Lowe, a farmer's daughter, with whom he had a son and a daughter. He joined the St Anne's Building Society and at the end of the year had saved his first &pound;12. In 1864 Houlding had saved his first &pound;100 and bought a public house followed by a second in 1869. By this time he had taken over the administration of the brewery and become its manager on a salary of &pound;200 a year. By 1870 Houlding had accumulated capital to the extent of &pound;900 and in 1871 he went into business on his own buying a piece of land in Tynemouth Street, Breck Road, and converting it into a brewery. He only had one employee at first but good profits were made from the start.<br>
<br>Houlding lived and worked in Everton, a rapidly growing working-class suburb containing an occasionally combustible mixture of Liverpool-born and English, Irish, and Welsh immigrants and it was Everton which supported his public career. This began in 1872 when he was appointed chairman of the Everton branch of the Conservative Association. The following year he was elected the representative for Everton on the west Derby board of guardians of which he was later chairman in 1878 and 1887. He joined the Everton burial board in 1876 and was chairman from 1880 for twenty years. Houlding won the Everton and Kirkdale ward in the city council elections of 1884, was elected alderman in 1895, became a JP in 1897 and lord mayor of Liverpool in 1897&#150;8. He was the first president of what became the Mersey Quay and Railway Carters' Union, a freemason, Orangeman, churchman, and philanthropist being among the initiators of the annual dinner for the aged poor.<br>
<br>Houlding was interested in sport, playing cricket and swimming in his younger days, and it was as the benefactor of the Everton Football Club that he became best known. He became the club's president in 1882 and managed the move to a ground in Anfield Road which the football club rented from him. Football became very popular in the 1880s as both a recreative and a spectator sport and therefore important as a market for brewers. The club agreed that as their income rose so would Houlding's rent, but the membership later felt that he was making too much money out of it. His role in the drink trade also upset some of them. Houlding found his vision for the commercial development of the club challenged by groups within the membership who differed from him ideologically, politically, and socially. In 1892 he gave the club notice to quit the Anfield Road ground and Everton moved to the other side of Stanley Park and built a new stadium in Goodison Road. Undaunted, Houlding created a new club from scratch and called it Liverpool. Not only did it obtain a place in the second division of the Football League but it won the championship without losing a match in 1893&#150;4. His shrewdest move was to persuade Tom Watson to transfer from Sunderland and become club secretary with full responsibility for the playing side, an early example of what would later be called a football manager. Liverpool won the first of their Division One championships in 1900&#150;01 under Houlding's chairmanship.<br>
<br>Houlding was a popular figure, particularly in Everton, and was often referred to as &#145;King John&#146;, a nickname affectionate rather than critical. Contemporaries attributed his success to a combination of hard work, determination, a powerful physique, and intelligence. A Liverpool newspaper judged that his popularity was due &#145;to his intimate acquaintance through experience of the condition and requirement of the working classes, absence of any pride of position and a daily readiness to help in any undertaking from a school room concert to a Parliamentary deputation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Liverpool Review</span>, 26 May 1888). Houlding was a &#145;parochial patriot&#146;  (Waller, 63), who may have lost the chance to stand for parliament because important local Conservatives thought him insufficiently polished. In later years he became a good French scholar and travelled widely on the continent. He died in France at the Pension Thomson, Cimiez, Nice, on 17 March 1902. He was buried next to his wife in Everton cemetery, Fazakerley, on 21 March 1902, when large crowds turned out to see the cort&egrave;ge pass.<br>
