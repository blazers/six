<span class="headword">Martyn,  Thomas</span>  (1735&#150;1825), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born at Cambridge on 23 September 1735, the eldest surviving child of three sons and five daughters born to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18235/', "John Martyn (1699&#150;1768)")</script>, professor of botany at the University of Cambridge, and his first wife, Eulalia (1703&#150;1749), daughter of John King DD, rector of Chelsea. He was raised at his grandfather's house in Church Lane, Chelsea, and later recalled his visits during this time to the aged Sir Hans Sloane, bearing copies of his father's publications. From the age of five and a half until he was seventeen Martyn was educated under the Revd Rothery at Paradise Row, Chelsea, from where he entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge, as a pensioner in 1752. At Cambridge, Martyn studied classics under Richard Hurd; he gained two scholarships and an exhibition, but was held back by his dislike of mathematics and graduated fifth senior optime in 1756.<br>
<br>Martyn was always a keen student of botany, but although brought up by his father on the works of John Ray, he absorbed the works of Linnaeus on their first appearance, and was a convert and early proponent of Linnaean views. As fellowships at Emmanuel were temporarily suspended, Martyn was elected fellow at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, and ordained deacon in 1758, when he also proceeded MA, and priest in the following year. From 1760 to 1774 he acted as tutor of his college.<br>
<br>Following his father's resignation in 1762 Martyn was elected university professor of botany, a post he held for sixty-three years, though he only lectured until 1796, botany not being a very popular subject. When Dr Richard Walker gave the site of the Austin friary for a botanical garden, Martyn became the first reader in botany under this endowment. In 1763 he gave his first course of lectures, based on the Linnaean system which was now gaining public and academic recognition. In the same year he published his first work, <span class="italic">Plantae Cantabrigienses</span>, and spent the long vacation in the Netherlands, Flanders, and Paris. In 1766 he graduated BD, and in 1770 he stood in when the garden's curator Charles Miller went to the East Indies.<br>
<br>In 1773 Martyn and his fellow tutor John Lettice, having bought the Italian original of <span class="italic">The Antiquities of Herculanaeum</span> for &pound;50 and laboured for five years on a translation, began publication; they issued only the first part, with fifty plates, before being stopped by objections from the Neapolitan court. Martyn resigned his fellowship to marry, on 9 December 1773, Martha Elliston (<i>d</i>. 1829), sister of Dr William Elliston, master of Sidney Sussex College. They had one child, John King Martyn. Martyn was presented by the bishop to the sequestration of Foxton and went to live at Triplow, near Cambridge, where he took pupils until 1776. At the beginning of 1774 his pupil John Borlase Warren presented him to the rectory of Ludgershall, Buckinghamshire, and in 1776 to the vicarage of Little Marlow, which became his headquarters until 1784.<br>
<br>In 1778 Martyn accompanied his pupil and ward, Edward Hartopp, of Little Dalby Hall, Leicestershire, for a two years' tour on the continent, taking with him his wife and infant son. After settling for some time at Vandoeuvres, near Geneva, they went as far south as Naples, and returned to England by Venice, Tyrol, Cologne, and Brussels. Martyn kept a journal, part of which he afterwards published, and made a large collection of minerals to illustrate lectures on general natural history, with which he now found it expedient to supplement those on botany.<br>
<br>In 1784 Martyn went to London for his son's education, and, having purchased the Charlotte Street Chapel, Pimlico, from Dr Dodd, resigned the rectory of Ludgershall, in which he was succeeded by his half-brother, Claudius. At this time he produced his most popular work, <span class="italic">Letters on the Elements of Botany</span> (8 edns), a translation and continuation of the original work by Jean-Jacques Rousseau. He also began his most considerable undertaking, his edition of Philip Miller's <span class="italic">Gardener's Dictionary</span>, a new work on the Linnaean system, which he undertook in 1785 for White and Rivington for 1000 guineas, expecting to complete it in eleven years. It was not, however, published as a whole until 1807. He was elected FRS in 1786, and fellow of the Linnean Society in 1788, and afterwards acted as vice-president of the latter society.<br>
<br>Martyn contributed twenty letters to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> in 1783&#150;1800, principally on natural history, especially botany. In 1784 he entered into a polite exchange of seven letters on trees with Thomas Holt White in that periodical, in which he continued to espouse the Linnaean system of botanical nomenclature. In 1791, at the request of Sir J. B. Warren, he became secretary to the Society for the Improvement of Naval Architecture, which lasted until 1796. In 1793, after thirty years' work, his professorship at Cambridge was made a royal one, and he was given a pension of &pound;100 per annum.<br>
<br>In 1798 Martyn moved to Pertenhall rectory, Bedfordshire, the home of his cousin, the Revd John King, who in 1800 resigned the living to the professor's son and only child, John King Martyn, fellow and mathematical lecturer of Sidney Sussex College, who in turn, in 1804, resigned it to his father. Martyn passed the remainder of his life in Pertenhall. He continued to preach until he was eighty-two, when his biographer, George Cornelius Gorham, became his curate. Martyn died at Pertenhall on 3 June 1825, and was buried in the chancel of his church, where a marble slab was placed to his memory.<br>
