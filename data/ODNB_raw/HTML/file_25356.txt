<span class="headword">Sheraton,  Thomas</span>  (1751&#150;1806), <span class="occ">furniture designer and author</span>, was a native of Stockton-on-Tees, co. Durham. His father, also named Thomas Sheraton (<i>b</i>. 1725/6, <i>bur</i>. 1792), was a schoolmaster from whom he must have received an education, although he later described himself as a &#145;mechanic, and one who never received the advantages of a <i>collegial</i> or <i>academical</i> education&#146;  (T. Sheraton, <span class="italic">A Scriptural Illustration of the Doctrine of Regeneration</span>, 1782). Nevertheless, he must have obtained a good training in cabinet-making, perhaps from one of the cabinet-makers in the town, and in draughtsmanship possibly from the local shipbuilding traditions with which his future wife's family were connected.<br>
<br>Sheraton's early years remain obscure. It seems unlikely that he ever set up a cabinet-making business of his own, probably because he lacked capital. He was described as having been &#145;for many years a journeyman cabinet maker&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>), and he himself wrote in his <span class="italic">Cabinet Dictionary</span> (1803): &#145;Having possessed a strong attachment and inclination for carving in my youth, I was necessarily induced to make attempts in this art, and was employed in the country occasionally in it&#146;  (Sheraton, <span class="italic">Cabinet Dictionary</span>, 136). His more profound interests lay elsewhere for by 1782, if not several years earlier, he had become a devout Baptist. In that year he published a tract entitled <span class="italic">A Scriptural Illustration of the Doctrine of Regeneration</span>, to which was added <span class="italic">A Letter on the Subject of Baptism Written to a Gentlewoman at her Request</span>, which expressed &#145;the sentiments of my heart&#146;. On 8 February 1779 he married Margaret Mitchinson of Norton, co. Durham, with whom he is said to have had two children. He may also have found work as a draughtsman and drawing-master: two views of Stockton High Street, engraved &#145;after T Sheraton&#146;, were published by a local bookseller in 1785 and 1795.<br>
<br>About 1790 Sheraton moved to London and was recorded at 4 Hart Street in 1791, 41 Davies Street in 1793, and 106 Wardour Street in 1795. His motives for moving south are unclear, but in 1791 his masterpiece, <span class="italic">The Cabinet Maker and Upholsterer's Drawing-Book</span>, began to be published by subscription in fortnightly sections (forty-two in all), priced 1<i>s</i>. A slightly larger second edition appeared in 1794 and a third with some small amendments in 1802. A German version was translated by G. T. Wenzel and published in Leipzig. It was intended for practising members of the trade, and addressed &#145;to Cabinet-Makers and Upholsterers in General&#146;. The 717 subscribers were almost entirely established furniture makers, in contrast to those of Thomas Chippendale's <span class="italic">Gentleman and Cabinet Maker's Director</span> (1754, 1755, and 1762) which had included members of aristocracy and gentry. Sheraton's intention (inspired perhaps by his nonconformist background) was to improve the work of uneducated artisans by teaching them proportion and perspective drawing, since previous manuals had been deficient in this. He firmly believed in the immutable laws of &#145;Geometry and real Science&#146; and wished to show how these could be applied to the ephemeral nature of taste particularly in furniture design. In his own words his intention was to make the <span class="italic">Drawing Book</span> &#145;as permanently useful as I could and to unite with usefulness the taste of the times&#146;  (Sheraton, <span class="italic">Drawing Book</span>, 1802 edn, 355).<br>
<br>Thus the first two parts were given over to geometry, perspective, and the orders of architecture, all deliberately calculated to the needs of furniture making. Parts three and four, on the other hand, described and illustrated &#145;a great variety of Original Designs&#146; and ornamental details for fashionable middle-class furniture. The overall style was an elegant neo-classicism with a Francophile bias, in some cases reminiscent of the prince of Wales's architect, Henry Holland. Indeed, the 120 engravings (many of which were accompanied by interesting technical instructions) included views of the prince's Chinese drawing room at Carlton House. How far Sheraton was an innovator or merely following fashionable taste has been debated. He himself described how he had tried to collect ideas from the best sources  (Sheraton, <span class="italic">Drawing Book</span>, 1802 edn, 353), and he was scrupulous in naming those from whom he had taken novel forms, as well as crediting himself where appropriate. In general his designs reflected the fashionable (but not aristocratic) taste of his time and the effect of his publication was to disseminate forms and ornament widely so that they remained in production (albeit often somewhat coarsened) for the next twenty-five years.<br>
<br>About 1799 Sheraton returned to co. Durham, where he became a Baptist minister in the following year. By 1802 he had returned to London and was residing at 8 Broad Street. In 1803 he published his second furniture book, <span class="italic">The Cabinet Dictionary</span>, containing 134 engraved designs and a lengthy text. By this date avant-garde taste had moved towards the more massive and archaeologically correct vocabulary of classicism advocated by C. H. Tatham, but not yet popularized. Sheraton included ornamental features of this type in the dictionary, but married somewhat awkwardly to more conventional forms. The strength of the dictionary lay more in its detailed descriptions of the production, use, and function of different types of furniture and of the interiors for which they were intended. Its weakness was the author's verbosity and tendency to stray into irrelevant areas.<br>
<br>During his first London period Sheraton's elegant trade card had described him as a teacher of &#145;Perspective, Architecture and Ornaments&#146; who &#145;makes Designs for Cabinet-makers and sells all kinds of Drawing Books etc&#146;. Despite this claim, only one manuscript design by Sheraton has survived: a pen and wash drawing for an ornate looking-glass dating from about 1790 (V&amp;A). His only documented and extant commission is the piano ordered by Don Manuel de Godoy in 1796 for presentation to Queen Maria Louisa of Spain and made by Broadwood (now at the Heritage Foundation, Deerfield, Massachusetts).<br>
<br>Sheraton continued to work as a draughtsman after his return to London in 1802, no doubt combining this with his duties as a Baptist minister. But he did not prosper. A glimpse of him is provided by the future publisher Adam Black, then seeking his fortune in London, and who worked for Sheraton briefly in 1804:<blockquote>He lived in an obscure street, his house half shop, half dwelling-house, and looked himself like a worn-out Methodist minister, with threadbare black coat &hellip; My host seemed a good man, with some talent. He had been a cabinetmaker, was now author and publisher, teacher of drawing, and, I believe, occasional preacher. I was with him for about a week, engaged in most wretched work, writing a few articles, and trying to put his shop in order, working among dirt and bugs, for which I was remunerated with half a guinea. Miserable as the pay was, I was half ashamed to take it from the poor man. (Fastnedge, 22&#150;3)</blockquote>Adam Black wondered &#145;how a man with such abilities and resources is in such a state? I believe his abilities and resources are his ruin, in this respect, for by attempting to do everything he does nothing&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>The work to which Black was asked to contribute was Sheraton's last and most ambitious project, <span class="italic">The Cabinet-Maker, Upholsterer, and General Artists' Encyclopaedia</span>. It was to be published in 125 parts by subscription; in the event only thirty sections, from A to C, appeared before the author's death in 1806. The entries were rambling and eccentric, suggesting a loss of mental faculties. The plates, despite being poorly produced, showed stylish furniture in the new early Regency taste. One thousand copies were sold, Sheraton having travelled to Ireland to solicit customers. He died at his home, 8 Broad Street, London, on 22 October 1806 &#145;of a phrenitis&#146;, leaving his wife, Margaret, and their two children &#145;in distressed circumstances&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>), and was buried on 27 October at St James's, Piccadilly, London. In 1812 eighty-four of Sheraton's plates, compiled from all his publications, were reissued by J. Taylor as a single folio volume entitled <span class="italic">Designs for Household Furniture by the Late Thomas Sheraton</span>.<br>
<br>Sheraton's influence on furniture design was widespread and lasted for at least a generation, not only with successful firms in Britain such as Gillows, but in America and Europe. His plea for an understanding of geometry, proportion, and perspective by aspiring artisans was eventually implemented by the curricula of the government schools of design which became established after the parliamentary enquiry of 1835. During the late Victorian period Sheraton's name became synonymous with the elegant furniture of the 1790s. A facsimile reprint of the <span class="italic">Drawing Book</span> published in 1895 helped to promote a revival of the beautifully proportioned and finely executed furniture he had advocated.<br>
