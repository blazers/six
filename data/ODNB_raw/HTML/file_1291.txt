<span class="headword">Bankhead,  John</span>  (1738&#150;1833), <span class="occ">minister of the Presbyterian General Synod of Ulster</span>, was born into a family that is thought to have come from Bank Head, Edinburghshire, and settled near Clough, co. Antrim. He is believed to have been educated at Glasgow University but his name is not in any college register. He was licensed by Ballymena presbytery before 29 June 1762 and called on 13 February 1763 to Ballycarry congregation, co. Antrim, which had been vacant since the death of James Cobham, on 22 February 1759. On 26 July 1763 Bankhead subscribed the confession of faith according to the following cautious formula: &#145;I believe the Westminster Confession to contain a system of the Christian doctrines, which doctrines I subscribe as the confession of my faith&#146;  (Witherow, <span class="italic">Memorials, 1731&#150;1800</span>, 136). He was ordained minister on 16 August 1763 and remained all his life at Ballycarry, where the disadvantage of a salary of &pound;45 was offset by the income from a grazing farm and the pleasure of his close friendship with the Edmonstone family of Redhall. He declined the call (and promise of a higher salary) from the richer congregation of Comber, co. Down, in July 1774. He married, first, Jane Martin, and following her death he married, in February 1812, Mary Magill, who survived him. He was father to twenty-two children.<br>
<br>In 1800 Bankhead served as moderator of synod. In 1786, however, he had published a catechism that hinted at his unease with doctrinally orthodox forms, for though the questions are those of the orthodox Westminster shorter catechism the answers are simply scriptural passages, printed without comment. In the second edition, published in 1825, some of the Westminster questions are omitted and others are altered. His assistant, William Glendy (1781/2&#150;1853), who had been ordained on 30 July 1812, broke with orthodoxy and joined the Remonstrant Synod of Ulster in 1829, taking the Ballycarry congregation with him. Bankhead remained on the roll of the general synod, and so his denominational affiliation in his last years is unclear.<br>
<br>A convivial man and an excellent mimic, Bankhead was gently satirized in a poem by the Revd William Heron of Ballyclare, &#145;The Ulster Synod&#146; (1817):<blockquote>
<div>In jovial mixture, and in dose enough<br>
</div>
<div>Scattering bright wit, sound sense, and Dublin snuff<br>
</div>
<div>To make you sneeze, or learn, or loudly laugh.<br>
</div> (Witherow, <span class="italic">Memorials, 1731&#150;1800</span>, 138)</blockquote>He died at Ballycarry on 5 July 1833, aged ninety-five and six weeks short of his seventieth year as minister at Ballycarry. He was buried in the churchyard of Templepatrick. Of the nineteen of his children who survived into adulthood John and Charles (<i>d</i>. 1859) became physicians, James (<i>d</i>. 1824) was minister of Dromore, co. Down, and William (<i>d</i>. 1881) served as Unitarian minister at Brighton and Diss, Norfolk, before leaving the ministry.<br>
