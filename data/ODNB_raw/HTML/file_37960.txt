<span class="headword">Simms,  Robert</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1761, <em>d.</em> 1843), <span class="occ">businessman and Irish nationalist</span>, was baptized in Belfast on 20 March 1761, the fifth child in the family of five sons and two daughters of Robert Simms, merchant and tanner, and his wife, Elizabeth Stevenson of Belfast. With his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37961/', "William Simms")</script> he owned a tan yard in North Street, Belfast (until 1794), a flour mill in Crumlin (until 1798), and a paper mill in Ballyclare (from 1798). He subscribed to Belfast's New White Linen Hall in 1782&#151;a gesture marking him out as one of that group of successful and civic-minded merchants for which Belfast was then noted. On 8 August 1786 he married Mary Gilliland (<i>d</i>. 1832) of Colin, near Belfast. They had four daughters and a son.<br>
<br>The Simms family were members of the Third Presbyterian Congregation in Rosemary Street, and as such not opposed to subscription to the Westminster confession of faith. Already a supporter of political reform in the 1780s, in October 1791 Simms was one of the thirteen founders of the Society of United Irishmen and a proprietor of its newspaper, the <span class="italic">Northern Star</span>. From the outset he was the society's key leader in the north. In May 1794 he and his brother were tried for, and acquitted of, publishing a seditious address in the <span class="italic">Northern Star</span>. By May 1797, when the paper was finally suppressed, they were its sole remaining proprietors.<br>
<br>After 1795&#151;when the United Irish Society went underground as an armed, revolutionary movement&#151;Simms remained prominent. He was one of fewer than a dozen leaders conversant with the society's policy of seeking French military help, and in 1796 he was appointed to the movement's first national executive committee. He was arrested and detained in Newgate prison in Dublin from February to June 1797. In late 1797 he was elected adjutant-general for co. Antrim, and preparations began for a rising. When it erupted prematurely in Leinster the following May he refused to lead another in Ulster before the expected French help arrived, and resigned his command. Five days later the Ulster rising went ahead under new leaders and was savagely suppressed. Simms maintained his silence on the reason for his withdrawal, and in 1842 he refused to give an interview to R. R. Madden, then writing his history of the United Irishmen. This is why we know so little about Robert Simms, though most contemporaries thought him too moral a man to have acted dishonourably. He was nevertheless arrested in 1798 and transferred in 1799 to Fort George in Scotland. He was released back to Belfast in December 1801. Although the government continued to suspect him he seems not to have taken any further part in rebellious activities and tried to dissuade his old friend Thomas Russell from organizing another rising in 1803.<br>
<br>Simms was on the committee for the Belfast Harpers' Festival of 1792 and maintained an interest in Irish traditional music throughout his life. He was secretary to the Belfast Society for Promoting Knowledge (the future Linen Hall Library) from 1794 to 1796 and assistant secretary to the Royal Belfast Academical Institution from 1812 to 1843. His personal character is difficult to fathom but he had a capacity for deep and long-lasting friendships. Affectionately nicknamed &#145;the Tanner&#146; in the journals of Theobald Wolfe Tone, he appears as a person of wisdom and integrity. He died in Belfast, at Franklin Place, on 23 June 1843.<br>
