<span class="headword">Robson,  John Henry Matthews</span>  (1870&#150;1945), <span class="occ">colonial administrator and journalist</span>, was born in Sydney Road, Guildford, Surrey, on 8 May 1870, the eldest son of John Henry Robson, then chaplain at the Surrey County Hospital, and his wife, Martha Esther, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Adcock. He was educated privately and (from 1884 to 1886) at Christ's College, Finchley. Like many young Englishmen of his period he took the opportunities of a career abroad, beginning with an apprenticeship on a tea estate in Ceylon, but within months he moved on to become an administrator in the protected Malay state of Selangor.<br>
<br>Despite a promising start (1889&#150;96) as a colonial official, Robson's inclination and talent led him to a career in journalism, and later business. As a district officer he had written articles for a Singapore newspaper (partially reprinted in <span class="italic">People in a Native State</span>, 1894) and was a regular contributor to the <span class="italic">Selangor Journal</span>, a fortnightly magazine. In 1896 he left the government service to found the <span class="italic">Malay Mail</span>, based in Selangor, the first daily newspaper published in the Federated Malay States, acting as its editor, reporter, and business manager until the early twentieth century, when it was well established. (It continued to flourish a century later.) Thereafter he was its part-proprietor and a &#145;hands on&#146; managing director and occasional contributor, but it employed journalists from the UK as editor and as staff reporters. When he founded the <span class="italic">Malay Mail</span> Robson had borrowed the necessary funds from Loke Yew, a prominent Chinese businessman and public figure. Relieved of the day-to-day production of his newspaper, Robson managed the extensive urban properties of Loke Yew, and in his memoirs, <span class="italic">Records and Recollections, 1889&#150;1934</span> (1934), gave a sympathetic character study of one of the most influential&#151;and richest&#151;Malayan Chinese of his time.<br>
<br>The legislative council of the Federated Malay States, established in 1909, began with Robson as one of its four appointed unofficial members (1909&#150;12). He pressed, with success, for the establishment of a London information agency to advertise the opportunities of investment in Malaya. A second and longer term (1921&#150;7) earned him appointment as a CBE. This second period saw a bitter controversy between Sir Laurence Guillemard (high commissioner) and George Maxwell (chief secretary) over the former's decentralization scheme for returning federal powers to the Malay states' governments. As senior unofficial member Robson often spoke for the commercial community and supported Maxwell, but he later gave a fair assessment of Guillemard in his memoirs.<br>
<br>As a public figure and newspaper columnist Robson championed other causes. He was a member (in 1905&#150;6) of the municipal authority of Kuala Lumpur and supported&#151;though without success&#151;farsighted but expensive plans for urban improvement. Again he recognized that his opponent, the resident, had a duty to be financially prudent. As a member of the legislative council he helped Raja Chulan, the only unofficial spokesman of the Malay community on the council, in preparing his speeches advocating measures to improve the condition of the Malays, overwhelmed at that time by commercially dominant immigrant Asian communities. Throughout his career Robson was one of the leading advocates of good race relations between Malaya's disparate peoples (including the Europeans), though he took a perhaps rose-tinted retrospective view of a situation that had deteriorated since the 1890s. He showed a shrewd and realistic grasp of essential facts, yet found a way through controversies without making enemies. He had many friends, and was a good listener as well as an articulate spokesman.<br>
<br>Despite his prominence in public life Robson was a private man and his memoirs were noticeably reticent about his domestic life. When he arrived, in the 1890s, European men greatly outnumbered women in their small community and often found Asian partners, especially Malay widows or divorcees (<i>janda</i>) whose prospects of remarriage within their own community were poor. Of the attitude of polite European society to these unions Robson wrote that &#145;the voice of Mrs Grundy [is] heard but little of and cared for less&#146;  (Butcher, 196). But discretion was necessary. There are indications that Robson had such a partner, who bore him a daughter and a son. By 1920, however, the relationship had run its course, and European society was more censorious. In 1921 Robson married Theodora Syers (<i>c</i>.1860&#150;1937), the widow (since 1897) of Harry Syers, a friend of his early days who had become the Federated Malay States' commissioner of police. When she died in 1937 an obituary (probably by Robson) described her as &#145;a kindly, charitable, thoughtful and gracious personality&#146;  (<span class="italic">Malaya</span>, July 1937). Robson himself did not end his life, and half a century in Malaya, on a happy note. Internment in Singapore in February 1942 broke his heart as well as his health; he died, as the ordeal was near its end, on 20 July 1945, in Changi internment camp, &#145;after ailing for the last three years&#146;  (Lewis, 261). His career illustrated the opportunities for achieving success and influence in colonial society without holding the actual reins of power.<br>
