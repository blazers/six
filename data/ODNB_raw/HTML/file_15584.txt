<span class="headword">King,  Peter John Locke</span>  (1811&#150;1885), <span class="occ">politician</span>, second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15583/', "Peter King, seventh Baron King (1775&#150;1833)")</script>, and brother of William King-Noel, first earl of Lovelace, was born at Ockham, Surrey, on 25 January 1811. He was educated at Harrow School and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA 1831, and MA 1833.<br>
<br>In 1837 King unsuccessfully contested East Surrey, but he was elected for the same constituency on 11 August 1847, and retained his seat until the conservative reaction at the general election in February 1874. He supported an alteration in the law of primogeniture for many sessions, various of his speeches being published as pamphlets. On 11 August 1854 his <span class="roman">Real Estate Charges Act</span> was passed, according to which mortgaged estates descend with and bear their own burdens; it became known as <span class="roman">Locke King's Act</span>. In the session of 1856 he was successful in obtaining the repeal of 120 sleeping statutes which were liable to be put into force from time to time. He also waged war against the statute law commission, and more than once denounced it as a job. His letters to <span class="italic">The Times</span> on chancery reform were reprinted in <span class="italic">A Bleak House Narrative of Real Life</span> (1856). King introduced a bill for abolishing the property qualification of members, which passed the House of Lords on 28 June 1858, and in eight successive sessions he brought forward a <span class="roman">County Franchise Bill</span>, on one occasion, 20 February 1851, defeating and causing the resignation of the Russell ministry. He succeeded in carrying through the House of Commons a bill for extending the &pound;10 franchise to the county constituencies, so as to include every adult male who came within the conditions of the borough suffrage. He was also well known for his advocacy of the ballot and of the abolition of church rates, and for his strenuous opposition to the principle and practice alike of endowments for religious purposes. He was distinguished by the legislative effectiveness of his moderate radicalism.<br>
<br>King married, on 22 March 1836, Louisa Elizabeth (<i>c</i>.1813&#150;1884), daughter of William Henry Hoare of Mitcham Grove, Surrey, with whom he had four sons and five daughters. King died at his home, Brooklands, Weybridge, on 12 November 1885. His only surviving son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66280/', "Hugh Fortescue Locke King")</script>, was founder of the Brooklands motor racing track.<br>
