<span class="headword">King,  James</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1750, <em>d.</em> 1784), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was baptized on 13 July 1750, at Clitheroe, Lancashire, the second son of James King (1714&#150;1795), curate of Clitheroe (afterwards dean of Raphoe), and his wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Walker (1713&#150;1794). Walker King, bishop of Rochester, was his younger brother. At an early age he entered Clitheroe grammar school where he remained until he was twelve years old; and on 19 November 1762 he entered the navy under the patronage of his kinsman, Captain William Norton, brother of the first Lord Grantley, serving under him in the <i>Assistance</i>. He afterwards served in the <i>Guernsey</i> (Captain James Chads) under Commodore Hugh Palliser on the Newfoundland station.<br>
<br>King was promoted lieutenant on 10 January 1771, and appointed to the <i>Cambridge</i> followed by several other ships before being placed on half pay in May 1773. He was then granted leave to go abroad and spent some time in Paris, devoting himself principally to scientific study; on his return he settled at Oxford with his brother Walker, then a fellow of Corpus Christi College, where James may have studied. Here he made the acquaintance of Thomas Hornsby who in 1776 recommended him as a competent astronomer to accompany James Cook's third voyage. He was accordingly appointed to the <i>Resolution</i> as second-lieutenant. At the time of Cook's death at Hawaii (14 February 1779) King was on shore in charge of the observatory. He had with him only a few men, but was reinforced by some of a boat's crew who had been rowing off the mouth of the bay before the disturbance with the Hawaiians began. This brought the number of the party up to twenty-four, and fortifying themselves in a neighbouring <i>heiau</i>, or open-air temple, they succeeded in repelling the attack of the Hawaiians until they were relieved, two hours later, by the ships' boats. On the death of Captain Charles Clerke (22 August 1779) King succeeded to the command of the <i>Discovery</i>, and on arriving in England he was advanced to post rank (3 October 1780).<br>
<br>In 1781 King was appointed to the frigate <i>Crocodile</i>, attached to the Channel Fleet, and towards the end of the year he was moved to the <i>Resistance</i> (40 guns), in which he went out to the West Indies in charge of a convoy of 500 merchant ships; these he succeeded in conducting safely to their destination, but the intense anxiety of the duty is said to have turned his hair grey. King's constitution was never strong, and he came back to England with his health impaired. It was under this disadvantage, while living with his brother Thomas, rector of St Mary Magdalene, Woodstock, near Oxford, that he assisted in preparing Cook's journal of the third voyage for the press, and wrote the narrative of the final part of the voyage, which formed the third volume. King's astronomical observations, together with those of Cook and William Bayly, were published by order of the commissioners of longitude in 1782; for this work he was elected FRS. In January 1780 he was granted the degree of LLD by diploma at Trinity College, Dublin, possibly in recognition of a gift of &#145;curiosities&#146; gathered during Cook's third voyage. In 1783 the state of his health compelled him to go to Nice, where he died, unmarried, of tuberculosis on 16 November 1784. He was buried at Nice, but there is a memorial tablet to him and his parents in St Mary Magdalene Church, Woodstock. The narrative of Cook's third voyage was issued in 1784.<br>
