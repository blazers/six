<span class="headword">O'Bryen,  Dennis</span>  (1755&#150;1832), <span class="occ">playwright and political pamphleteer</span>, was born in Ireland. He became a surgeon but relinquished the profession and settled in London. The work that first brought him notoriety was the ironical <span class="italic">Defence of the earl of Shelburne from the reproaches of his numerous enemies, in a letter to Sir George Saville, bart., to which is added a postscript addressed to the earl of Stair</span> (1782; 2nd edn, 1783). Contrary to O'Bryen's title, the work was in fact a mock-defence and it provoked replies from William Petty, first marquess of Lansdowne. On 5 July 1783 O'Bryen's comedy <span class="italic">A Friend in Need is a Friend Indeed</span> was performed at the Haymarket and thereafter eight times at the theatre. The play, which in some respects resembles Oliver Goldsmith's <span class="italic">Good-Natured Man</span>, received some unfavourable reviews and was never printed but it did give rise to a newspaper controversy between the author and the theatre manager George Colman the elder, who wrote the epilogue. During the early 1780s O'Bryen published two papers called <span class="italic">The Reasoner</span> which subsequently appeared in several compilations, the first being attributed by the compiler to Lord Erskine, the second to Sheridan. Other works by O'Bryen include: <span class="italic">A gleam of comfort to this distracted empire, demonstrating the fairness and reasonableness of national confidence in the present ministry</span>&#151;meaning the ministry of Pitt (1784); <span class="italic">A View of the Commercial Treaty with France</span> (1786); <span class="italic">Lines Written at Twickenham</span> (1788), followed in the same year by the anonymously published <span class="italic">The prospect before us, being a series of papers upon the great question which now agitates the public mind</span>, which was reproduced under the title <span class="italic">The Regency Question</span> with a new preface, in consequence of the return of the king's insanity in 1810. In 1796 he published <span class="italic">Utrum horum? The Government or the Country?</span> which rapidly passed through three editions.<br>
<br>O'Bryen's political writings reflect his activism as a supporter of the Fox administration and his key role as Fox's &#145;public relations adviser&#146;  (Reid). On 11 February 1790 O'Bryen and others arranged a meeting to assuage the breach between Burke and Sheridan; the outcome was that it was agreed not to discuss the subject of the French Revolution in the House of Commons. It appears that in 1799 O'Bryen and Sheridan may have had dealings with Arthur O'Connor who was involved in a conspiracy to overthrow English rule in Ireland. It has been suggested that during O'Connor's trial O'Bryen and Sheridan instigated a fracas in the courtroom with the intention of aiding O'Connor's escape. The ensuing m&ecirc;l&eacute;e did not achieve this objective and in April 1799 O'Bryen and others stood trial on the charge of inciting a riot. The event was described by the attorney-general as &#145;one of the most heinous &hellip; in the history of our Law&#146;: O'Bryen was found not guilty but his fellow accused both received sentences  (O'Toole).<br>
<br>O'Bryen was an intimate of Sheridan although he took issue with his suitability to follow Fox as MP for Westminster and succeeded in winning &#145;Mr. Fox from his purpose&#146; at the end of June 1802  (Fox to O'Bryen, BL, Add. MS 47566, fol. 67). On the change of ministry in 1806 he succeeded to the lucrative sinecure of deputy paymaster-general and he was appointed to the patent office of marshal of the Admiralty at the Cape of Good Hope, worth, it was said &pound;4000 per annum. During the same year O'Bryen secured a &pound;400 loan for Sheridan and in 1816 wrote in emotive terms to the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> calling for assistance for Sheridan. O'Bryen died at Margate on 13 August 1832 having resided at 21 Craven Street, Strand, London. His manuscripts and correspondence were sold after his death at auction by Mr Evans.<br>
