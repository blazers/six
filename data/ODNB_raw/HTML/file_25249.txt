<span class="headword">Shaw, Sir  Frederick</span>, third baronet  (1799&#150;1876), <span class="occ">politician</span>, born at Bushy Park, co. Dublin, on 11 December 1799, was the second son of Sir Robert Shaw (1774&#150;1849), and his first wife, Maria (<i>d</i>. 1831), daughter and heir of Abraham Wilkinson of Bushy Park. The father, a Dublin banker, sat in the Irish parliament (1798&#150;1800) for Bannow borough, co. Wexford; after voting against the union he was for twenty-two years (1804&#150;26) member for Dublin city in the Westminster parliament. He also served as lord mayor of Dublin, and was created a baronet in 1821.<br>
<br>Shaw entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1816, but shortly afterwards moved to Brasenose College, Oxford, where he graduated BA in 1819. In 1822 he was called to the Irish bar and quickly attained a considerable practice. In 1826 he was appointed recorder of Dundalk, an office that he vacated two years later on his nomination to the recordership of Dublin. Shaw married, on 16 March 1819, Thomasine Emily (<i>d</i>. 1859), sixth daughter of the Hon. George Jocelyn, and granddaughter of Robert, first earl of Roden; they had five sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>His father's influence, combined with his own abilities, soon led to Shaw's selection as one of the tory candidates for the representation of Dublin. In 1830 he successfully contested the city, defeating Henry Grattan's son. At the general election of 1831 he was unsuccessful, but was awarded the seat on petition, and held it for the brief remainder of the unreformed parliament. Each of his elections for the unreformed constituency of Dublin cost him &pound;10,000. After the <span class="roman">Reform Act</span>, O'Connell had hopes that Shaw might be persuaded to stand as a conservative repealer, but was soon disabused of this notion. At the election of 1832, Shaw was returned with Serjeant Lefroy for the University of Dublin; he was subsequently re-elected four times for the same constituency.<br>
<br>In the House of Commons Shaw rapidly acquired a reputation. He possessed debating talents of a high order, and became the recognized leader of the Irish Conservatives. He was regarded as the most capable opponent of O'Connell, though he did not take the extreme tory view of any question, and had been a supporter of Catholic emancipation before that measure was passed. His moderation was unrepresentative of the Irish tory rank and file, and distanced him from the Lords' leaders Roden and Enniskillen. His most considerable parliamentary achievement was in the debate on the charges brought by O'Connell against Sir William Cusack Smith, an Irish judge. O'Connell had on 13 February 1834 carried by a majority of ninety-three a motion for the appointment of a select committee to inquire into the conduct of Baron Smith in introducing political topics in his judicial charges. A week later a motion to rescind this resolution was carried, notwithstanding ministerial opposition, as a result mainly of Shaw's eloquent defence of the accused judge.<br>
<br>When Peel formed his government in 1834, Shaw declined on professional grounds all preferment beyond a seat in the Irish privy council. During this short administration he was, however, the chief adviser of Lord Haddington's Irish government, which was called by opponents the &#145;Shaw viceroyalty&#146;. On the return of the whigs to office, Shaw became one of Peel's most active colleagues in opposition. He took an active but not extreme part in the opposition to Lord John Russell's <span class="roman">Irish Municipal Corporations Bill</span> of 1835, and proposed a successful amendment to the 1838 <span class="roman">Tithe Bill</span>. He favoured an extensive poor-relief measure. Although he had entered parliament as a representative of Conservative and protestant principles, Shaw's opinion and conduct had by 1847 become too liberal for some of his old supporters, particularly after he followed Peel in voting for repeal of the corn laws in 1846. At the elections of 1847 he retained his seat for the university only after a very severe contest with Sir Joseph Napier, later Irish lord chancellor.<br>
<br>In 1848 poor health obliged Shaw to resign his seat and retire from political life. On the death, unmarried, of his elder brother, Robert, on 19 February 1869, he succeeded to the baronetcy. Early in 1876 he resigned his office of recorder of Dublin, receiving an address from the bar. He had been made a bencher of the King's Inns in 1835. He died on 30 June 1876 at his home, Terenure Manor (formerly known as Kimmage House), Crumlin, co. Dublin, and was buried at Mount Jerome cemetery.<br>
