</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Compton,  Henry</span>  (1631/2&#150;1713), <span class="occ">bishop of London</span>, was born at Compton Wynyates, Warwickshire, the sixth and youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6035/', "Spencer Compton, second earl of Northampton (1601&#150;1643)")</script>, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1654), daughter of Sir Francis Beaumont of Coleorton, Leicestershire.<h2>
<a name="Youthandeducation"></a>Youth and education</h2>Compton's father and brothers were active royalists when civil war came, and the ten-year-old Henry was present in the royalist camp at Edgehill, where his father and brothers were involved in the fighting. His father was killed refusing to surrender at the battle of Hopton Heath on 19 March 1643 and thereafter there is considerable uncertainty about Compton's whereabouts. The family seat was garrisoned by parliamentarians in June 1644 and his mother was forced to compound for the family's estates. Compton later boasted that he had drawn his sword in defence of the constitution but whether this was in the context of the first civil war or subsequently is not clear. He is known to have attended Uppingham grammar school for a while.<br>
<br>On 9 February 1652 Compton was granted a licence to travel abroad and may have done so. But within less than two years he had returned, for on 12 December 1654 he matriculated at Queen's College, Oxford, as a nobleman. Cromwellian Oxford may not have been congenial to him, for he left without taking a degree and seems to have gone on his travels again, visiting France and Italy. According to one source he enlisted under the duke of York (the future James II) in Flanders in this period. A number of things make this unlikely. Compton never subsequently seems to have had a good relationship with York, which is odd if they had been former comrades in arms. Beyond this there is a conversation reported between them, possibly dating from 1686, from which Compton's claim to have drawn his sword for the constitution comes. If this related to service in the 1640s, Compton would hardly have needed to remind his commanding officer of the 1650s of that fact. The whole conversation actually suggests that Compton's military experience came as news to York, who remarked that he spoke more like a colonel than a bishop.<h2>
<a name="Militaryandecclesiasticalcareers"></a>Military and ecclesiastical careers</h2>When the Restoration dawned a military career did indeed seem more likely than an ecclesiastical one for the young Compton. By 16 February 1661 he was commissioned as a cornet in the troop of the Royal Horse Guards, of which two of his brothers were captain and lieutenant. He rose to the rank of lieutenant himself in November. He found time to be admitted as an MA at Cambridge in this year but the next year, in August 1662, he was sent to Tangier in a military capacity. However, in 1663 he left the army for good and on 25 February 1664 was granted a pass to travel to France. In July he wrote to Archbishop Sheldon, asking to have his pass extended to stay on the continent as &#145;it may conduce to confirm my health&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 47, fol. 184).<br>
<br>At thirty-two Compton was something of a rootless cavalier (this is certainly what he looks like in an early portrait of him as a young man). His education, as Burnet later remarked, lacked &#145;exactness&#146;: indeed, it had been highly spasmodic  (<span class="italic">Burnet's History</span>, 2.99). Yet he had travelled widely, gaining a cosmopolitan outlook and an awareness of the wider European scene. His direct observation of the Roman Catholic church abroad seems to have fuelled the strongly anti-Catholic tendency which was so evident in his later career.<br>
<br>Compton finally returned to England in the spring of 1666 and at once came under the influence of John Fell, then dean of Christ Church, Oxford. It was he who persuaded Compton to enter Christ Church as a canon commoner, being incorporated MA on 7 July 1666. Fell also persuaded Compton to be ordained, which took place in the summer of 1666. He was immediately in line for significant ecclesiastical preferment, with a reversion on the next vacant canonry at Christ Church. In 1667 the king made him master of St Cross Hospital at Winchester, to which Bishop George Morley instituted him on 18 November. He came into the canonry at Christ Church even before he had acquired suitable Oxford degrees, receiving his warrant on 29 April 1669 and the degrees BD and DD in May and June respectively. He was then made subdean of Christ Church. Despite his lack of academic background Compton seems to have taken to his new role with relative ease. He made a brief oration at the opening of the Sheldonian Theatre in July 1669, which was well received. In December 1670, when the young prince of Orange&#151;the future William III&#151;visited Oxford, Compton was assigned the task of guiding him through the Church of England liturgy at morning prayer in Christ Church: an episode not without a certain piquancy in the light of their future relationship. Contemporaries were agreed that Compton was not a good preacher but, according to one of his earliest biographers, he moderated well in divinity disputations at this time.<br>
<br>The only shadow over an otherwise promising ecclesiastical career was cast by Compton's financial difficulties, which were already severe by 1670. The profits from St Cross were disappointing and the living at Llandinam in Montgomeryshire in Wales, to which he had been appointed in 1666, does not seem to have made much difference. He owed money to Sir Joseph Williamson, who also acted on behalf of his other creditors. Other livings were added: Cottenham in Cambridgeshire, to which Archbishop Sheldon nominated him in April 1671, and Witney in Oxfordshire, to which Bishop Morley presented him in November 1674. Compton seems to have regarded these livings simply as financial assets but they failed to solve his money problems. A combination of aristocratic excess and genuine generosity meant that his finances were never to be in a healthy condition, even after he became a bishop.<h2>
<a name="BishopofOxford"></a>Bishop of Oxford</h2>Compton's elevation to the episcopate as bishop of Oxford in succession to Nathaniel Crewe, which was finalized in November 1674, seems to have been entirely due to the earl of Danby's influence. Compton must have caught the eye of the king's new lord treasurer as just the sort of well-born Anglican royalist upon whose support he intended to build his regime. And Compton would not let him down. He was consecrated in the chapel at Lambeth Palace by Archbishop Sheldon and four diocesan bishops from the province of Canterbury on 6 December 1674. His new see was not lucrative: Compton himself estimated its value at just over &pound;343. He was allowed to retain his position at St Cross, his Christ Church canonry, and the living at Witney <i>in commendam</i>, in recognition of this, given his still shaky financial situation. In July 1675 he was appointed to the court post of dean of the chapels royal, which gave him some influence over the education of the young princesses Mary and Anne. Further promotion came in December 1675 when he was appointed bishop of London, a post he would hold until his death. Danby's patronage obtained for him the further honour of elevation to the privy council the following January, even before he had done homage for his appointment to London.<h2>
<a name="BishopofLondon"></a>Bishop of London</h2>Compton very soon showed himself to be a highly effective bishop at both the political and the pastoral level. He immediately began to use his place at court and on the council to lobby against the influence of Roman Catholics there, making sure the princesses were prepared for confirmation in the Church of England, in the face of the duke of York's opposition. Charles II tolerated Compton's zeal as harmless and because &#145;it helped to lay the jealousies of the church party&#146;  (<span class="italic">Burnet's History</span>, 2.100). Compton had a significant role in the great church party project of 1676: the ecclesiastical census, known to contemporaries as the <span class="roman">Bishops' Book</span> but which has come to be known as the <span class="roman">Compton Census</span>. It was designed to demonstrate once and for all to a sceptical king that nonconformists were too few to be worth wooing politically and so strengthen Danby's Anglican royalist regime. Incumbents and churchwardens were to be asked to estimate the relative strengths of conformists, Roman Catholics, and protestant dissenters in their parishes. Sheldon wrote to Compton on 17 January 1676 to set the process in motion in the province of Canterbury; just four days later Compton forwarded the instructions to the relevant diocesans. From the resultant figures from the parishes he estimated that the proportion of conformists to nonconformists throughout the country was twenty-three to one. Compton supported and to some extent supplanted the ailing Archbishop Sheldon in his political role. Compton came to act as organizer of the bishops in the Lords, reminding Sheldon in January 1677 of the need to warn bishops to send in their proxies in good time if they could not attend in person.<br>
<br>When Sheldon died later that year Compton was strongly tipped to be his successor, although Compton himself purported to support Archbishop Richard Sterne of York for the job, perhaps hoping to be <i>his</i> successor at Canterbury before very long. That Compton was not appointed to Canterbury may be attributed to a number of factors: Danby's lack of enthusiasm (despite professions to the contrary), Charles II's indifference to him, and the duke of York's already passionate hostility. York had even opposed Compton's elevation to London, doubtless already aware of his protestant credentials, and Compton in post had fulfilled York's worst fears, with his interference in his daughters' religious education and his crusade against influential Roman Catholics at court. But 1677 was not an entirely disappointing year for Compton. On 4 November he had the joy of helping the prince of Orange through another piece of Church of England liturgy when he presided at his wedding to the young Princess Mary, a great boost to the protestant cause both at home and abroad.<br>
<br>However, Compton was much more than merely a court prelate tied up with high politics. He was also a remarkably conscientious diocesan bishop. He conducted visitations of his diocese in person throughout his tenure, going in person to the parishes concerned. From January 1678 he developed the idea of conferences for the clergy throughout his diocese, where pastoral and practical issues could be discussed. These took place not only at the urban core of the diocese but in the outlying rural areas as well, convened by rural deans, with reports of proceedings and lists of absentees returned to Compton personally.<br>
<br>But Compton's political involvement made him vulnerable to the growing instability of the times. When the Popish Plot scare broke out in the autumn of 1678 Compton had a prominent role in investigating the alleged conspiracy. He was an energetic member of the privy council committee charged with looking into it. He ordered that English Roman Catholics who attended mass at ambassadors' houses be arrested. In early November he even backed the earl of Shaftesbury's motion in the Lords that the duke of York be removed from the court and council. Not surprisingly this lost Compton favour at court but it did not protect him from rumours that he was a closet papist himself. Danby's fall from power was a grievous blow to Compton, considering how closely he had previously been associated with him.<br>
<br>Perhaps aware of his own political isolation, Compton softened his line towards the duke of York over the course of the exclusion crisis (1679&#150;81). In October 1680 he voted for York to stay in England, and in November he joined the other bishops present in voting down the <span class="roman">Exclusion Bill</span> in the Lords. In the same month he brought some words spoken against the duke of York and in favour of the duke of Monmouth to the attention of the privy council. By February 1681 he was firmly back in favour and was appointed to the commission for ecclesiastical promotions, designed to control church patronage and keep it in loyal hands. But Compton's position within the tory reaction, which characterized the years down to 1685, has been the subject of some controversy both at the time and since. In 1682 and 1683 he was criticized for his supposed friendliness and liberality towards nonconformists by some hardline Anglicans. He could certainly <i>sound</i> friendly towards individual dissenters, such as Richard Baxter in the 1670s, but his friendliness does not seem to have extended to taking action in their favour. He could hardly be described as liberal about nonconformity in the early 1680s. In March 1683 he wrote to every incumbent in his diocese complaining that churchwardens had been remiss in their presentations especially about absentees from holy communion, and the parish registers of Hillingdon testify to 300 communicants over the following Easter period: &#145;alarmed to their duty by an order from Henry Lord Bishop of London&#146;  (J. S. Burn, <span class="italic">The History of Parish Registers</span>, 2nd edn, 1862, 186). And the &#145;shameful disuse of public baptism&#146; was one of the main topics that Compton prescribed for one of his clergy conferences at this time  (Sykes, 26).<br>
<br>Where a generous and flexible attitude did show through was in Compton's approach to continental protestants, especially those who were experiencing persecution. He had solicited the opinions of certain European protestant divines about their differences with the Church of England, and in 1677 translated a work of Andr&eacute; Lortie as <span class="italic">A Treatise of the Holy Communion</span>. Compton was the natural choice to spearhead fund-raising and other practical initiatives on behalf of protestant refugees in July 1681 and he worked tirelessly on their behalf, sometimes having to battle against a distinct lack of enthusiasm among his episcopal colleagues. He even found himself compelled to mediate in the internal disputes of the exiled French churches resident within his own diocese. His commitment to international protestantism was very clear. But as the new reign loomed in 1685, Compton's commitment to tory principles was equally clear. He drew up a loyal address to the new king, James II, and sent a copy of it to his rural deans so that the clergy of London diocese might speak with one voice. He presented it in person along with the clergy of the capital within one week of the accession, although it took a while for the outlying archdeaconries to catch up with their copies. It spoke pointedly of &#145;our religion established by law dearer to us than our lives&#146;  (Carpenter, 79). In the general election Compton mobilized rural deans on behalf of loyal candidates and at the coronation in April he attended personally upon the queen.<h2>
<a name="OppositiontoJamesIIandtherevolution"></a>Opposition to James II and the revolution</h2>However, it did not take long for the old feud between Compton and James to resurface. The <i>casus belli</i> for the new round of conflict was James's employment of Roman Catholic officers in the army, contrary to the <span class="roman">Test Act</span> of 1673. In the second session of parliament on 18 November, Compton made a long, calm, and deferential speech which nevertheless criticized the king's flouting of the law as endangering the whole constitution. He claimed to speak for his episcopal colleagues, a claim endorsed when those bishops who were present in the Lords stood up in solidarity with him when he had finished. As a result of his boldness Compton was removed from his posts as dean of the chapels royal, clerk of the closet, and member of the privy council.<br>
<br>Compton was soon openly opposing other aspects of royal policy, notably the plans to curtail anti-Catholic preaching, either by suppressing afternoon lectures or by issuing instructions to preachers. James did not follow through the first of these options but he most emphatically pursued the latter and it was from this that his next confrontation with Compton arose. John Sharp, dean of Norwich and rector of St Giles-in-the-Fields, London, indulged in some anti-Catholic remarks in his preaching. James responded on 17 June 1686 by ordering Compton to suspend him. Compton demurred on the ground that Sharp could not be suspended without first being heard (although he had privately persuaded Sharp to desist from preaching for the present). As a result Compton was summoned before the recently created ecclesiastical commission on 9 August and was granted until 31 August to prepare his case. His counsel maintained that Compton had obeyed the king as far as he legally could. Nevertheless the verdict for his suspension was delivered on 6 September by an admittedly divided commission. The harsher sentence of deprivation was not imposed, so Compton's episcopal revenues remained untouched, though more perhaps out of a fear of a challenge at common law than from any clemency on the part of the commissioners.<br>
<br>Compton at once became a protestant martyr. Princess Mary wrote to him expressing her sympathy and his treatment was said to be widely resented. He continued to guide his clergy from behind the scenes, dividing his time between London and the country, indulging his favourite pastime of gardening. His episcopal duties were taken over by three of his colleagues.<br>
<br>Only with James II's showdown with the seven bishops over the reading of the declaration of indulgence in churches in 1688 did Compton again become prominent in public life. He approved their petition and indeed, with typical impetuosity, may well have been responsible for having it published, which raised the stakes on all sides. Compton visited the seven in the Tower of London and may well have been present at their trial.<br>
<br>In his next political action, however, Compton went way beyond what his episcopal colleagues could have contemplated in signing the invitation to William of Orange to intervene militarily in England. In this he joined his former mentor, Danby, who had recruited him to the conspiracy. Rash and impetuous though this undoubtedly was, it was not the bolt from the blue that it might at first appear. Compton had remained in touch with the court at The Hague, initially with his former prot&eacute;g&eacute;e Princess Mary but latterly with William directly. They shared concern at the developing situation in England: it was through Compton that William expressed his concern for the seven bishops. According to Danby, it was his treatment at the hands of the ecclesiastical commission in 1686 that led him to reconsider his commitment to the traditional doctrine of passive obedience.<br>
<br>William was not perhaps as circumspect as he might have been in covering Compton's tracks: he mentioned the action taken against Compton by the ecclesiastical commission in his declaration of reasons for intervening in England. He also mentioned an invitation from lords spiritual and temporal (in fact, Compton was the only spiritual one to have signed the invitation). Not surprisingly James became suspicious and invited Compton to a private meeting on 31 October. Compton was out of London at the time. When the two did meet soon afterwards he gave the king a deceptive answer implying that he was innocent: &#145;I am quite confident that there is not one of my brethren who is not as guiltless as myself in this matter&#146;  (Macaulay, 1.562). In this he was not necessarily motivated solely by personal cowardice (others might have been implicated) and even if he had been, a certain lack of courage in the face of the potential penalty for treason in seventeenth-century England is hardly so reprehensible. Compton successfully stiffened his fellow bishops in resisting James's repeated calls for an abhorrence of William's invasion, though they could hardly have guessed the reason for his resolve. He had ignored both the lifting of his suspension by the ecclesiastical commission at the end of September and the abolition of the commission itself on 5 October, neither resuming his episcopal duties nor offering any thanks. He bided his time. Those who had signed the invitation to William had pledged themselves to join him as soon as possible after he landed. Perhaps by agreement with his fellow conspirators, Compton remained in London, keeping a low profile, offering protection to Princess Anne, should she wish to escape. She took up the offer and was escorted out of London by the fully armed bishop and others, reaching Castle Ashby, the earl of Northampton's seat, on 28 November, going thence to Nottingham and then to Oxford, where Princess Anne was reunited with her husband, Prince George, on 15 December.<br>
<br>Compton's bearing arms in the context of the revolution became notorious but requires careful scrutiny. In the context of governmental breakdown and military disintegration it was perhaps prudent to have some weapons about his person. Where Compton appears to have overstepped the mark was in continuing to bear arms and indeed in revelling in military command after he had joined up with forces quite capable of protecting the princess without his assistance. He even rode into the tory centre of Oxford in martial style, which was to fly in the face of Anglican scruples about involvement in armed resistance to the lawfully constituted government and to store up for himself charges of hypocrisy when he returned to the traditional position of passive obedience in due course. He further compounded his insensitivity to Anglican scruples by convening a meeting in Princess Anne's presence at which those present were invited to enter into an association to take revenge should the prince of Orange be harmed by Roman Catholics. Many tory peers and gentry present refused to sign.<br>
<br>Compton was closely identified with William and Mary in the ensuing constitutional struggle. On 21 December he presented a congratulatory address from his clergy to William and before the end of the year celebrated holy communion for him. Early in January 1689 he controversially instructed his clergy to omit prayers for the prince of Wales, James II's son, born the previous June, whom many supporters of the revolution believed to be an impostor. He was isolated from the overwhelming majority of his fellow bishops, who favoured a regency. And not surprisingly it was Compton who preached the sermon following the offer of the crown to William and Mary. Next day he was made a privy councillor and dean of the chapels royal again. He was also to be groom of the stole. On 20 February he led the London clergy in procession to offer a congratulatory address to the new sovereigns, whose coronation he was to preside at in April. He was a keen supporter of the regime and its emphasis on moral reformation. William's letter of 1689 to him ordering the clergy to read the statutes against vice was published and itself became part of the regime's propaganda campaign.<h2>
<a name="ThereignofWilliamandMary"></a>The reign of William and Mary</h2>After the spring of 1689 Compton seems hard to place politically. This reflects in part the complexity of the post-revolution political scene but also the fact that he was increasingly motivated by a personal agenda. He appeared to support comprehension for nonconformists within the Church of England, conscientiously presiding over all eighteen sessions of the special commission in October, but was then involved in getting Dr William Jane, a prot&eacute;g&eacute;, made prolocutor of the lower house of convocation, which further reduced comprehension's already slim chances of being accepted. Jane was a hardline opponent of comprehension, who had even queried the legality of the comprehension commission. The alternative and pro-comprehension candidate was John Tillotson, the front runner for the archiepiscopate of Canterbury in preference to Compton, pending William Sancroft's removal for failing to take the oaths to William and Mary. In 1690 Compton was said to have &#145;influence over most of the Whig party&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1690&#150;91</i>, 210), while on the contrary Gilbert Burnet saw him as a consistent tory. Queen Mary was soon complaining of Compton and other high-churchmen conspiring with her sister Anne against her at court; while Thomas Comber, dean of Durham, hoped that Compton might get the lesser prize of the archbishopric of York and so help engage the tory clergy of the northern province to the revolutionary government.<br>
<br>Compton made no attempt to hide his disappointment at being passed over for Canterbury. He attended neither Tillotson's consecration nor his admission to the privy council in 1691 and was still reluctant to be involved in court business at the end of that year. It appears that neither of the new sovereigns wanted him as archbishop, William motivated perhaps by an uncomfortable awareness of his debt to Compton in the revolution, perhaps also by personal dislike. When Canterbury fell vacant again in 1694&#150;5 Compton's expectations were not as great, and any disappointment was less obvious. He remained politically loyal to the regime, although increasingly alienated from its ecclesiastical preferences and priorities.<br>
<br>Whatever his disappointments Compton continued to work conscientiously as a diocesan and in support of the charitable causes to which he was committed. The clergy conferences and visitations continued. He even managed to conduct a visitation of St Paul's between 1696 and 1698, giving the cathedral new statutes which laid down the basic pattern of worship there for the next century. He also took seriously his spiritual oversight of the American colonies, which he exercised as bishop of London, supporting Thomas Bray in his work there as his commissary in 1699&#150;1700. Compton also backed Bray's brainchild of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, which was founded in 1701.<h2>
<a name="ThereignofAnne"></a>The reign of Anne</h2>Compton's political fortunes revived considerably when William was succeeded by Anne, with whom he had enjoyed such a close relationship over the years. He was appointed lord high almoner in 1702 and gained some influence over church appointments. In 1708 he gave pastoral support to the queen on the death of Prince George (he had presided at their wedding twenty-five years before). He clearly supported the high-church and tory programme in this period: the revival of convocation, the clamp-down on occasional conformity, the rallying cry that the church was in danger. Both Francis Atterbury and Dr Sacheverell were prot&eacute;g&eacute;s. And in 1710 he presented an address to the queen congratulating her on her change of ministry from whigs to tories.<br>
<br>Whigs delighted to exhume evidence of inconsistency and hypocrisy in the light of his later political stance. But it is possible to exaggerate the shift in Compton's views over the years. The impression given by some accounts of the period written then and since of an almost radical bishop becoming reactionary in old age is misleading. His views on most subjects throughout his career were the conventional ones for a churchman of the period. It was the intensity of his anti-Catholicism, compounded by a personal feud with James II, which marked him out from his episcopal colleagues in the 1680s and drove him to actions that they could not countenance. But Danby's right-hand man on the episcopal bench in the 1670s was hardly an incongruous opponent of occasional conformity in the 1700s. The religious complexion of the regime was a critical factor for Compton. Impetuous man that he was, it was not surprising that he should conspire against a Catholic regime at one stage in his career and advocate obedience to a protestant one at another. Burnet was right to detect a certain consistency in his loyalties over a considerable period, although paradoxically it was Burnet who bowled him out publicly for eliding his active role in the revolution, when discussing the rights and wrongs of passive obedience in the Lords in 1705.<br>
<br>After years of good health Compton deteriorated physically, suffering from gout and stones. In 1711 he was seriously ill. In the following year he had a fall, but recovered enough to undertake another taxing visitation. But his health declined again and he died calmly, aged eighty-one, at his episcopal residence at Fulham on 7 July 1713. At his own request he was buried without pomp in the churchyard and with the simplest of memorials within the parish church at Fulham on 15 July. This was typical of the man: he had a real humility which even an opponent like Burnet could recognize. The truth was too that there was little money left for anything grander, even had he wanted it. He had written a begging letter to the earl of Oxford as recently as October 1712, being as ever strapped for cash. Neither the proceeds of the see of London nor the &pound;1000 salary which Compton latterly enjoyed as a commissioner of trade and plantations could offset the effects of his lack of financial management and his impetuous generosity. He had no wife and children to support; no doubt his financial difficulties would have been even greater if he had. At death, little remained apart from his magnificent library, which was split between St Paul's and Colchester corporation.<br>
<br>It is possible, with Burnet, to see Compton as a weak man influenced by others. And yet there can be little doubt that he was one of the most effective diocesan bishops in this period. In many ways a shy and private man, there is seldom displayed an insight into his inner thoughts. Several works were published under his name, sometimes without his consent (such as <span class="italic">Episcopalia</span>, a collection of letters to his clergy, in 1686). But they seldom shed much light on his personal life, being largely of an official nature, with few clues as to his deeper motivations. The works of others which he translated betray his absorption with anti-Catholicism (such as Gregorio Leti's <span class="italic">Life of Donna Olimpia Maldachini</span> from the Italian in 1666 and Fulgentio Micanzio's <span class="italic">Jesuits' Intrigues</span> from the French in 1669).<br>
<br>The surviving portraits in later life are not much more help, although they convey the impression of a man of effectiveness and drive in the public realm, with clear facial features and directness of expression. Botany was a great interest, and he planted his gardens at Fulham with &#145;a greater variety of curious exotic plants and trees than had at that time been collected in any garden in England&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), most obtained from his correspondents in North America. He never married, despite occasional gossip that he would. His household became a sort of surrogate family to him and he inspired great loyalty among his chaplains. Compton was hospitable and his personal generosity to individuals was prodigious.<br>
<br>Compton's legacy in many areas of church and state was significant. Such were the variety and multiplicity of his involvements that his lasting influence defies neat summary. But places as far apart as St Paul's Cathedral and the American colonies were in his debt. His conscientious rule left the diocese of London in a much better spiritual state than it had been when he took over. Indeed, he presided over something of a religious revival there, which had far-reaching consequences in following decades. He struggled to maintain the international contacts of the Church of England at a time when it was in danger of turning inwards and forgetting the wider world and the broader protestant cause. Finally, however mixed the feelings of his contemporaries, Compton's active role in bringing about the revolution was long remembered and celebrated&#151;an example of a certain reckless courage which has not always characterized the political stances of the Church of England's senior bishops.<br>
