<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Craxton,  (Thomas) Harold Hunt</span>  (1885&#150;1971), <span class="occ">pianist and teacher</span>, was born on 30 April 1885 at 6 Dorchester Place, Marylebone, London, the first son of Thomas Robert Craxton (1858&#150;1908), a surveyor's assistant, and his wife, Sarah Jane Hunt (1852&#150;1905). The Craxtons originated in Northamptonshire. Before marriage Sarah Jane Hunt had been headmistress of a girls' school, and she sang in a forerunner of the Royal Choral Society. By Harold's first birthday the family had moved to Devizes, Wiltshire, where his father set up as a publican. At the age of seven Harold passed the first grade of the Trinity College of Music examinations, entering the room nervously because he thought that two dummy knights guarding the entrance were the examiners.<br>
<br>Thomas Robert Craxton's business proved unsuccessful. The family moved to the poorer part of the town while the father sought work in London; there were now five boys to support. By 1898 they were reunited in London, and a Miss Collins of Trinity received &#145;&pound;1. 8s 0d for 12 pianoforte and theory lessons for Master Harold Craxton (plus 2s 6d for Beringer's Technical Studies)&#146;  (private information). &#145;Master Craxton's First Grand Evening Concert&#146; took place at Hammersmith town hall on 23 January 1901. The <span class="italic">West London Observer</span> reported that he was &#145;the possessor of exceptional qualities&#146;. From 1902 he worked in light-music ensembles. His early training thus took place far from the great musical centres, and not until 1907 did he enter the Tobias Matthay School, studying with Cuthbert Whitemore and Matthay himself.<br>
<br>From 1909 to 1911 Craxton was accompanist to Emma Albani. The year 1911 also saw the publication of his first compositions. Extensive tours on both sides of the Atlantic with Dame Clara Butt and her husband, Kennerley Rumford, made him the most celebrated accompanist in the United Kingdom. Dame Clara performed several of his compositions and also smoothed the way for his marriage on 12 December 1914, initially opposed by her parents, to the violinist Essie May Faulkner (1890&#150;1977), daughter of Charles W. Faulkner, an art publisher. In 1919 Craxton became professor of piano at the Royal Academy of Music; thereafter his career was London-based.<br>
<br>Craxton also undertook performances as a soloist; but although as an accompanist he covered an enormous range of music, this and his work as a teacher left him little time to enlarge his solo repertory. He had a great love of early English music&#151;invariably beginning recitals with a group of such pieces&#151;and was reported to have found a rare magic in them. Chopin, Schumann, Brahms, and Debussy were also especially dear to him, and he was proud of his collaboration with Sir Donald Tovey in the Associated Board edition of the Beethoven piano sonatas (1931). He no longer performed publicly after 1954. However, Craxton's work as accompanist was preserved on several recordings; his largest project was a recording of the Delius cello sonata with Beatrice Harrison (1926). In addition, his recordings of lieder with Elena Gerhardt (1924&#150;7), and also of Purcell songs with Astra Desmond in the 1940s, were innovative in their day. He recorded many lighter pieces with the violinist Jacques Thibaud.<br>
<br>Yet however significant Craxton was as a pianist, it is as a teacher that he will be remembered. He jocularly remarked, &#145;the right Bach at the right time for the pupil or trouble always happens&#146;  (autobiography); and the secret of his whole approach can be divined from this phrase. He was acutely aware that each pupil had a completely different set of needs, which he diagnosed with exceptional capacity. Craxton had absorbed from Matthay fundamental ideas such as economy of movement, a relaxed wrist, and a strong first joint, and the pupil who did not possess these by nature did exercises until he or she obtained them. Craxton knew that standards in England were fairly amateurish, and if attitudes towards the technical side of musical studies had improved by the time he retired, no small credit was due to him. Very often his method consisted simply in selecting the right piece of music at the right time. A pupil might realize only long afterwards why a particular piece had been chosen. The final analysis is of almost underhand teaching, outwardly benign and democratic, which none the less stemmed from a clear idea of where each pupil had to go, and got him there. On his retirement from the Royal Academy of Music in 1960 Craxton was awarded the OBE.<br>
<br>A collateral aspect was the legendary Craxton hospitality. Blessed with a large house post-war in Kidderpore Avenue, Hampstead, and with a still larger pre-war one in Grove End Road, St John's Wood, Craxton virtually adopted some students, the dinner table was always crowded, and the upstairs rooms were permanently full of pails of soaking students' socks. Presiding over the household was Essie, the &#145;universal mother&#146; to family and students alike, and even to her husband, whom she escorted to the Royal Academy of Music in the battered Rolls-Royce he was unable to drive himself. After retirement he still received students privately and always showed interest in their careers. The novelist Elizabeth Jane Howard, who was taught by him, has given a memorable description of Craxton in 1936:<blockquote>His appearance was unusual and fascinating. He wore his hair much longer than other people. He had a broad and noble brow, large, pale blue eyes whose blandness often concealed an acute sense of humour and a degree of perception that I was unused to; a long nose, a long, indented upper lip below which curled a delicately sardonic mouth, a purposeful chin and large elegant ears. (Howard)</blockquote>Craxton was modest about his compositions, yet showed a genuine melodic gift, and the four unpublished Shakespeare settings (1944) achieve the lucidity upon which he insisted in his playing and teaching. The mixture of old and new in such very free transcriptions of early English pieces as &#145;The Plaint of Love&#146; and &#145;Siciliano and Rigadon&#146; (1935) has its own fascination. His editions of old English keyboard compositions brought the music to a wider public.<br>
<br>Harold Craxton died on 30 March 1971 in New End Hospital, Hampstead. He was cremated at Golders Green crematorium. A memorial concert was held at Fairfield Hall, Croydon, on 17 September 1971, and several years later his ashes were scattered on Hindhead golf course. His wife survived him. Of their six children only <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67633/', "Janet Craxton (1929&#150;1981)")</script>, an oboist, became a professional musician; Antony (1918&#150;1999), for long a distinguished BBC producer, brought classical music to the television; and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/101581/', "John Leith Craxton (1922&#150;2009)")</script> became a noted painter.<br>
