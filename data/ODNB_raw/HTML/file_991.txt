<span class="headword">Bacon, Sir  Francis</span>  (<em>c.</em>1587&#150;1657), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the eldest of five sons and a daughter of John Bacon (<i>d</i>. 1618), of King's Lynn, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Henry Paynell of Belaugh, Norfolk. He was a great-grandson of Thomas Bacon of Hessett in Suffolk. Although Hessett passed from Bury St Edmunds Abbey to the immediate ancestors of Lord Keeper Bacon, no firm links between his family and the Bacons of Hessett have been made, and their heraldry is distinct.<br>
<br>Bacon commenced his legal studies at Barnard's Inn, moved to Gray's Inn in February 1607, and was called to the bar in 1615. His first practice may have been either in chancery or in the provinces. About 1621 he married Elizabeth (1595&#150;1651), daughter of William Robinson of Norwich; their eldest daughter, Barbara, was baptized at St Gregory's Church there in October 1622. The Bacons were firmly settled in the parish, paying towards the repair of the font and east window of the church, and their six sons and two daughters, all born in the 1620s, were eventually buried there, the last in 1710.<br>
<br>In 1634 Bacon was autumn reader at Gray's Inn; two years later the king granted him the office of drawing licences and pardons of alienations to the great seal for life, and in 1640 he was admitted serjeant-at-law. He became steward of Norwich in 1639 and recorder in 1642, the year he was appointed to the king's bench and knighted in October by the king at Bridgnorth. Parliament accepted his appointment, and, when demanding that the king dismiss several judges in February 1643, conceded &#145;that Mr Justice Bacon may be continued&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 6.231). While Charles was at Oxford, Bacon was one of &#145;the sworn judges still at Westminster, of which there were three in number&#146;. He presided alone in the king's bench, as his &#145;brothers&#146; Reeve and Trevor did in the common pleas and exchequer  (ibid., 7.317).<br>
<br>In 1645 Bacon was the only judge at the trial of Lord Macguire on the charge of high treason for his share in the Irish rising and massacre of 1641. Macguire had demanded to be tried by a jury of Irish peers, but &#145;Bacon delivered his judgment that a baron of Ireland was triable by a jury in this kingdom&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 4.665), and this judgment was formally approved of by both houses. When the prosecution desired &#145;speedy progress, this being a public case&#146;, Bacon said that &#145;a public case must have public justice on both sides. We must do that which the law doth allow&#146;  (ibid., 668). Bacon's impartiality was further shown when he committed James Symbal and others to prison &#145;for speaking of words against the king in time of war&#146;  (Whitelocke, 269). After the king's execution, new commissions were issued to the judges, requiring them to take the oath in the name of the people instead of in that of the king, and Bacon had the courage to resign. Five of his colleagues, after some hesitation, agreed to hold office, &#145;provided that by act of the commons the fundamental laws be not abolished&#146;  (ibid., 378).<br>
<br>Bacon retired to Norwich, where he soon lost his wife; she was buried at St Gregory's on 9 October 1651, aged fifty-six. He died on 22 August 1657, and was buried in the same place three days later. Their eldest son, Francis, commissioned a magnificent monument in the south-east chapel of St Thomas there. It has been wrongly stated that this Francis became reader in Gray's Inn in 1662, but in fact the Ipswich MP Francis Bacon (1600&#150;1663) held that appointment.<br>
