<span class="headword">Pelham, Sir  Nicholas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1560), <span class="occ">landowner and member of parliament</span>, was the eldest son of Sir William Pelham (<i>d</i>. 1538/9) of Laughton, Sussex, and his first wife, Mary, daughter of Sir Richard Carew of Beddington. His maternal uncle Sir Nicholas Carew, after whom he was presumably named, was master of the horse to Henry VIII. Carew's attainder for treason in March 1539, accused of implication in the Courtenay conspiracy, cast a shadow over Pelham's succession as head of the family, though the damage done to his immediate prospects may have been offset by his links through his stepmother, Mary Sandys, to her father, the first Baron Sandys, who was lord chamberlain until December 1540. An illicit hunting party in the spring of 1541 at his recently enlarged family home at Laughton involved the killing of one of his gamekeepers by a servant of his near-contemporary and neighbour from Herstmonceux, Thomas Fiennes, ninth Lord Dacre of the South, for which Dacre was executed in June 1541. Pelham's marriage, by 1537, to Anne Sackville, the daughter of a rising Sussex gentleman, strengthened his family's ancient links with the Howard dukes of Norfolk and the Fitzalan earls of Arundel: with Anne he had eight surviving children. He pushed ahead with his father's scheme to drain Laughton marsh, and like his father invested in sheep. He also consolidated his estates in and around his home. Perhaps by inclination he eschewed attendance at court, answering only occasional summonses to major state occasions, for instance the reception of the admiral of France in 1546.<br>
<br>Named to the Sussex bench in 1544, Pelham became active in county administration, and he also distinguished himself in the region's defence against the French, in 1545 organizing the militia to repulse a landing between Newhaven and Brighton. He was twice returned to parliament, in 1547 for the borough of Arundel and in 1558 for the shire. Following the arrest of the duke of Somerset in the autumn of 1549 he was pricked sheriff of Surrey and Sussex, and on 17 November he was made a knight. The timing of these honours suggests that he had not rallied to Somerset against the earl of Warwick during the recent <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i>. His political allegiance may not have been fixed, however, for two years later he was briefly imprisoned with Somerset and Arundel for plotting against Warwick, by now duke of Northumberland. While captive in the Tower, and evidently despairing of his life, he made a brief will in his own hand. Of his part in the succession crisis in 1553 nothing is known beyond his receipt of a letter dated 14 July from leading figures in Kent denouncing Lady Jane Grey's claim to the throne. Under Mary, Pelham's career continued apace, although his protestantism presumably made him an increasingly uncomfortable supporter of the regime. Early in 1554 his brother William supported Sir Thomas Wyatt in his rising against Queen Mary's plans to marry Philip of Spain, and his eldest son, John, fled abroad in 1556, travelling to Padua and Geneva. Pelham's refusal to provide men for the army in 1558 may have been a protest against the new regulations for musters, since after a spell in the Fleet prison he agreed to supply warhorses instead.<br>
<br>Pelham lived for almost two years after the accession of Elizabeth. On 6 February 1560 he made his second will, in which he expressed his confidence that he would be &#145;received amonge his [Christ's] electe&#146;&#151;a phrase which suggests Calvinist leanings  (Manning, 264). He survived another eight months before he died on 15 September; he was buried in St Michael's Church, Lewes, where his funerary monument immortalizes his military prowess in 1545. His half-brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21786/', "Sir Edmund Pelham (d. 1606)")</script> was a lawyer who became chief baron of the Irish exchequer. Pelham's descendants remained a power in Sussex until in the eighteenth century their influence in the county became paramount under Thomas Pelham-Holles, duke of Newcastle.<br>
