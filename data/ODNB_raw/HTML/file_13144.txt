<span class="headword">Hewett, Sir  Prescott Gardner</span>, first baronet  (1812&#150;1891), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, son of William N. W. Hewett of Bilham Hall, near Doncaster, was born on 3 July 1812. Hewett was educated in Paris, where he studied painting, though subsequently he abandoned the idea of following art as a profession, turning his attention to medicine instead. While in Paris, Hewett also studied anatomy at the &Eacute;cole de M&eacute;decine and became thoroughly grounded in the principles and practice of French surgery. After his return to England he was admitted a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, on 15 July 1836, and he worked for a while as demonstrator of anatomy at the school of anatomy in Little Windmill Street, London. His excellent dissections attracted the attention of Sir Benjamin Brodie, who soon offered Hewett the post of demonstrator of anatomy at St George's Hospital, when Hewett was on the point of accepting a commission in the service of the East India Company. Hewett accepted the post at St George's, where his half-brother Cornwallis Hewett, Downing professor of physic at Cambridge, had served as physician from 1825 to 1833. Hewett became curator of the museum at St George's Hospital towards the end of 1840. He was appointed lecturer on anatomy in 1845, and on 4 February 1848 he was elected assistant surgeon to the hospital; he became full surgeon on 21 June 1861 and consulting surgeon on 12 February 1875. On 13 September 1849 Hewett married Sarah Cowell (<i>d</i>. 1874), eldest daughter of the Revd Joseph Cowell of Todmorden, Lancashire; they had one son, Harry Hammerton Hewett (1853&#150;1891), who survived him only a few weeks, and two daughters.<br>
<br>At the Royal College of Surgeons of England, Hewett was elected a fellow on 11 December 1843. He was Arris and Gale professor of human anatomy and physiology (1854&#150;9), a member of the council (1867&#150;83), chairman of the board of examiners in midwifery (1875), vice-president (1874 and 1875), and president (1876). In 1863 Hewett was elected president of the Pathological Society of London, and in 1873 he was elected president of the Clinical Society. On 4 June 1874 he was chosen a fellow of the Royal Society.<br>
<br>Hewett was appointed surgeon-extraordinary to the queen in 1867, serjeant-surgeon-extraordinary in 1877, and serjeant-surgeon in 1884. He also held the appointment from 1875 of surgeon to the prince of Wales. He was made a baronet on 6 August 1883. He then retired to Horsham, Sussex, where he devoted much of his time to watercolour painting and to country pursuits, though he still paid occasional visits to London for professional purposes. His collection of watercolour drawings was presented to the nation, and was exhibited at the South Kensington Museum in 1891. Hewett exhibited sixteen landscape watercolours at the Old Watercolour Society and four landscapes at the Grosvenor Gallery, London. His watercolour of Newquay Bay, Cornwall, was acquired by the Tate Gallery. Hewett died on 19 June 1891 at his home, Chestnut Lodge, Horsham.<br>
<br>Contemporaries admired Hewett for both his teaching and surgical abilities. He first became known in professional circles, as one of the most able anatomists, skilful organizers, and best lecturers in London; the general public came to consider him an accomplished surgeon. He also published numerous papers on hernia, aneurysm, injuries of the head, and pyaemia, in the journals of the various societies to which he belonged. The results of his most valuable work on the injuries and surgical diseases of the head are embodied in his article, &#145;Injuries of the head&#146;, in T. Holmes's <span class="italic">System of Surgery</span> (4 vols., 1860&#150;64).<br>
