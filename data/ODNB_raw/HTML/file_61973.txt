<span class="headword">John ap John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1625&#150;1697), <span class="occ">Quaker leader</span>, possibly the son of John ap John, was born at Pen-y-cefn in Coed Cristionydd township, Ruabon, Denbighshire. Upon his marriage in 1663 to Catherine Edwards (<i>d</i>. 1695), the widow of David ab Edward, John ap John moved to Plas Efa, Trefor, near Llangollen. A yeoman farmer, he also held other freehold properties at Trefor and Rhuddallt.<br>
<br>It is possible that John ap John was educated at a school at Wrexham and may well have been influenced by the puritan preacher Walter Cradock, who was the curate of the parish in 1635. Puritan influence on him was reinforced during the civil war, and it is likely that he was a chaplain to the parliamentary garrison stationed near Beaumaris during the late 1640s. John was also a member of Morgan Llwyd's congregationalists at Wrexham. In 1653 Llwyd sent John and another member of the congregation to Swarthmoor Hall in Furness, Lancashire, to meet George Fox and investigate the Quaker movement. As a result of this meeting John and his companion were convinced of the Quaker message. After this event John ap John became a notable Quaker preacher throughout Wales, whose ministry was &#145;very effectuall to the Convincemt. of Many&#146;  (Penney, 323).<br>
<br>After he established his first Quaker congregation at Pen-y-cefn, John ap John proceeded in 1654 to preach throughout south Wales and the borders. As a consequence of this missionary work he was imprisoned in Cardiff and Usk in Monmouthshire during his first year of missionary work. In their accounts of the persecution suffered by Welsh Friends, members recorded that in 1655 at Usk in Monmouthshire John ap John was the first Friend to be imprisoned for disturbing a minister in the county. He was nevertheless eventually released with the assistance of the Quaker magistrate Walter Jenkins. At Swansea in October 1655 John ap John, after disputing with Morris Bidwell, the Independent minister of St Mary's Church, was seized by the collar and confined to &#145;a close dark prison&#146; before being brought before the magistrates who were intent on having &#145;him whipt, that the Devil might come out of him&#146;  (Besse, 1.735). On 8 October 1655 a mittimus was sent to the keeper of the common gaol at Cardiff stating that &#145;John ap John of Denbighshire hath misbehaved himself contrary to the Laws&#146;  (ibid., 1.736). He was kept in this prison for at least three months.<br>
<br>During June and July 1657 John ap John accompanied George Fox on his missionary tour around Wales. He was, however, arrested and briefly imprisoned at Tenby, and at &#145;a great market town&#146;  (Norris and Penney, 8), presumably referring to Carmarthen. The two men also visited Dolgellau, Caernarfon, and Beaumaris in north Wales, where John carried the main burden of preaching and bore the brunt of official hostility and popular abuse. It has been conjectured that the imprisonment of John ap John stemmed less from the &#145;desire on the part of the magistrates to imprison vindictively, than to imprison and send away for the purpose of preserving the peace&#146;  (ibid.). Like many other Friends John ap John was in 1658 threatened with physical force when he refused to pay tithes. He was again detained in Swansea in 1658 and imprisoned for twenty weeks in Cardiff for preaching against Evan Griffith, the minister of Oxwich in Gower, who pulled John's hair while he was also &#145;struck and pulled by the nose&#146;  (Great Book of Sufferings, 2, fol. 3) by Morris Bidwell. John was also briefly imprisoned in 1660, along with several other Welsh Friends, in Cardiff after conducting a Quaker meeting. In 1663, 1668, and again in 1670 he was fined by the magistrates at Wrexham and Ruthin for holding Quaker meetings. In spite of these hardships John ap John remained committed to the Society of Friends and secured notable conversions, including William Bevan, a prosperous Swansea merchant, the Lloyd family of Dolobran, and Richard Davies, a felt maker from Cloddiau Cochion near Welshpool. In 1668 John ap John again travelled as itinerant preacher when Fox returned to Wales and he similarly accompanied Richard Davies and John Burnyeat, another Quaker missionary, in their travels throughout Wales in 1669 and 1675. Davies wrote in his <span class="italic">Journal</span> that &#145;We declared the word of the Lord both in Welsh and English. My Friend John ap John was very sound and intelligible in the Welsh language&#146;  (<span class="italic">Account of the Convincement</span>, 165).<br>
<br>In August 1673 John ap John reflected upon his life as a Quaker missionary and wrote &#145;I have received much and done but little&#146;  (Norris and Penney, 6), yet from 1667 he was instrumental in establishing further meetings throughout Wales. He helped to develop the organizational apparatus of Welsh monthly, quarterly, and yearly meetings which enabled the society to survive and prosper, especially in times of persecution or when many Friends in the country sought refuge in America. On 15 September 1681 John ap John and Thomas Wynne, the Quaker barber&#150;surgeon of Caerwys, purchased 5000 acres in Pennsylvania for an initial sum of &pound;100 with the intention of assisting Friends who were prepared to emigrate. He was, therefore, &#145;the father of the &#147;Welsh Tract&#148; in Pennsylvania&#146; who first spoke to William Penn about buying some of his land in America. John may have been in Penn's confidence and, having early notice of the royal grant, suggested to the Welsh to secure the best lands  (Bebb, 188). In 1683 John published <span class="italic">Tystiolaeth o gariad ac ewyllys da</span>&#151;a translation of John Songhurst's <span class="italic">Testimony of Love and Good will</span> (1680) and a call to Friends to be loyal to truth and the light. He also attended many of the Welsh yearly meetings and held the 1693 yearly meeting at his own home.<br>
<br>On 9 February 1695 Catherine, his wife, died at Rhuddallt and was buried at Trefor. Before his death John ap John went to live with his daughter Phoebe, the wife of John Mellor of Whitehough Manor, Ipstones parish, Staffordshire, where he died on 16 November 1697. He was later buried nearby at Basford.<br>
