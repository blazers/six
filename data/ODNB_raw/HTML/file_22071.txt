<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fitzmaurice,  Henry  Petty-</span>, third marquess of Lansdowne  (1780&#150;1863), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 2 July 1780 at Lansdowne House, Berkeley Square, London, the second surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22070/', "William Petty, second earl of Shelburne (1737&#150;1805)")</script> (first marquess of Lansdowne from 1784), and the first with his second wife, Lady Louisa Fitzpatrick (1755&#150;1789), daughter of John, first earl of Upper Ossory. His father was prime minister in 1782&#150;3 and he was brought up from his earliest years with a political career in mind. Educated from at least 1793 to 1796 at Westminster School under the supervision of one of the masters, Peter Debary, he was sent with him at the suggestion of his father's friend Jeremy Bentham to study, like many other British noblemen, under Dugald Stewart at Edinburgh University from 1796 to 1798. In 1798 he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, until he could travel abroad.<h2>
<a name="Travelandearlypoliticalcareer"></a>Travel and early political career</h2>Having graduated MA in 1801, Petty left for the continent with Bentham's prot&eacute;g&eacute; &Eacute;tienne Dumont. Apart from visiting Switzerland, he spent much time in Paris, where he was introduced to Lafayette, and also first met his hero Charles James Fox. While still abroad he was returned by his father as MP for Calne on 7 July 1802. Among others to recognize his potential was Pitt, who on his return to power in May 1804 offered him a post, but Petty was already firmly committed to the whig cause. In June 1805 he was elected to the Commons' committee to prepare the articles of impeachment against Pitt's ally Melville. When parliament reassembled on 21 January 1806 the whigs chose him to read in the Commons the amendment they had prepared to the loyal address but in view of the prime minister's mortal illness waived a vote. Even before Pitt's death on 23 January 1806, Fox backed his desire to stand for Pitt's Cambridge University seat. On 24 January Petty resigned his seat at Calne, and won the university seat on 7 February in a famous tripartite contest with his future colleagues Althorp and Palmerston; in the general election of October&#150;November 1806 he was returned unopposed.<br>
<br>On 5 February 1806 Petty had taken the seals as chancellor of the exchequer in Grenville's ministry and been sworn to the privy council. His first budget on 28 March 1806 raised property tax by 50 per cent and continued the whig campaign for economy in public expenditure and against official corruption. In the reshuffle occasioned by Fox's death on 13 September 1806, Grenville briefly considered making him home secretary. On 29 January 1807 Petty introduced a new financial plan to sustain expenditure on the war, embodied in his second budget of 4 March 1807. This, which involved the redemption of public loans over fourteen years, was thought fundamentally unsound and was abandoned by the next government. Petty was a strong supporter of the ministry's moves to improve the position of Catholics in the army, which led to its dismissal by George III on 24 March 1807. Petty was himself defeated at Cambridge over the Catholic question, on 8 May 1807, and was brought in instead for Camelford by the duke of Bedford on 11 May. On Grey's succession to his father's earldom in November 1807, he was happy not to press his claims against those of George Ponsonby to the leadership of the opposition in the lower house, though he was, in the opinion of his first cousin Lord Holland, &#145;the best hope of the Whig Party in the Commons&#146;  (Holland, <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Whig Party</span>, 44). It was also clear that he was unlikely to remain there long. His father had died in 1805, leaving him extensive lands in co. Kerry and an income which contemporaries put at &pound;5000 a year. The death, on 15 November 1809, of his half-brother, the second marquess, who led an eccentric life and had been in poor health, removed him to the Lords, where he took his seat on 23 January 1810. On 30 March 1808, at her father's seat, Melbury, Petty had married Lady Louisa Emma Fox-Strangways (1785&#150;1851), daughter of Henry Thomas, second earl of Ilchester. They had three children: William Thomas, Earl Wycombe, and from 1818, earl of Kerry (<i>b</i>. 24 March 1811, <i>d</i>. 21 August 1836); Louisa (<i>b</i>. 21 Jan 1813), who married the Hon. James Kenneth Howard on 10 February 1845; and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22072/', "Henry Thomas Petty-Fitzmaurice")</script> (<i>b</i>. 5 Jan 1816), from 1836 earl of Shelburne, who was summoned to the Lords as Baron Wycombe in 1856 and succeeded his father as fourth marquess.<br>
<br>Following what proved to be the king's final descent into madness at the end of 1810, Lansdowne, as he now was, and Holland were among the leaders of the unsuccessful whig opposition to the 1811 act which temporarily restricted the powers of the regent. But the whigs were to receive no thanks from the prince of Wales. On Wellesley's resignation as foreign secretary early in 1812, George urged the whigs to form a coalition ministry with Perceval, knowing they would not accept. Grenville and Grey consulted Lansdowne and others and, at Lansdowne's urging, rested their refusal solely on the government's and their incompatible views on Ireland and the Catholic question. After Perceval's assassination on 11 May, the prince commissioned Wellesley to form a ministry, but Lansdowne and the other whigs returned the same answer as to the previous overture, and Liverpool was confirmed in office. In May 1813 Lansdowne actively supported Grattan's abortive bill for the removal of Roman Catholic civil disabilities. The long years of whig opposition were spent by Lansdowne in championing causes which were to remain dear to him throughout his career: the ending of the slave trade and the removal of discriminatory legislation against Catholics, dissenters, and Jews. He was also particularly interested in financial questions, foreign affairs, and law reform. On succeeding his cousin as fourth earl of Kerry in 1818, he added the family's original surname of Fitzmaurice to his own.<h2>
<a name="Returntooffice18271841"></a>Return to office, 1827&#150;1841</h2>By 1826 Canning, who felt isolated in Liverpool's cabinet, was sounding out Lansdowne about a possible coalition between his supporters and the whigs. They had much in common: for example, on 15 March 1824 Lansdowne had moved for the immediate recognition of the new South American states, one of Canning's most cherished objectives as foreign secretary. Canning's appointment as prime minister on 10 April 1827, following Liverpool's stroke and the subsequent resignation of the diehard tory ministers, should have led to a political realignment, but George IV's opposition to the pro-Catholic bias of the new ministry proved a stumbling-block. Meanwhile the whig party split, with Grey and &#145;the malignants&#146; going into opposition; Lansdowne leading a section of the whigs onto the government benches, while a third group, under Althorp, adopted a neutral stance. Lansdowne and his followers refused to take full office until the king's opposition to installing pro-Catholics in the Irish government could be overcome, and he initially joined the government without portfolio on 20 May. He eventually became home secretary, the post always intended for him, on 16 July. By then Canning was mortally ill and it fell to Lansdowne to convey the news of his death on 8 August to the king at Windsor. George was not prepared to countenance the idea of a whig prime minister and sent instead for Frederick Robinson, Viscount Goderich, a Canningite. Lansdowne agreed to continue in office, but events soon showed both Goderich's incapacity and the exposed position in which this left his allies. On discovering that the politically objectionable Herries was to be chancellor of the exchequer, Lansdowne threatened to resign but the king, playing on his patriotism, persuaded him to stay. Lansdowne spent the remainder of the year in vain attempts to strengthen his position by securing the admission of Holland to the cabinet, but at the start of 1828 Goderich's ramshackle administration finally collapsed. The episode damaged Lansdowne's political standing for at least a decade and, more importantly, seems to have shaken his own confidence in his ability to lead the party.<br>
<br>When the whigs returned to power in November 1830 Grey offered to stand aside if Lansdowne wished to be prime minister, but doubtless did so in the sure knowledge that the offer would be refused. The recurrence and rejection of similar offers were to characterize the second half of Lansdowne's political life. After it had first been proffered to Holland, Lansdowne also turned down the post of foreign secretary and settled for that of lord president of the council on 22 November. He was, however, one of Grey's closest advisers and one of the government's chief contacts with the tory &#145;waverers&#146;, led by Harrowby and Wharncliffe, in its attempt to secure the passage of the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> through the Lords in late 1831 and 1832. Like Grey, Melbourne, and Palmerston, he was at first opposed to any large-scale creation of sympathetic peers, though he came to think that some might be necessary. In the event William IV's promise to create peers proved sufficient to secure the passage of the bill. Lansdowne was, as he was to remain, a very moderate reformer who wished to remove obvious abuses and anomalies, but also to ensure that the landed interest remained well represented in the Commons and to maintain the authority of the House of Lords.<br>
<br>When Melbourne was sent for by the king on Grey's resignation in July 1834, he sought and received an assurance from Lansdowne that he did not wish to head the new government. Lansdowne continued as lord president until Melbourne's ministry was dismissed by the king on 14 November 1834. On Peel's resignation in April 1835, Grey advised William IV to send for Melbourne and Lansdowne, and after both had rebuffed the king's suggestion of a coalition government, Melbourne resumed the premiership, and, on 18 April 1835, Lansdowne his former office, which he held until the government's resignation on 31 August 1841. He was installed as a knight of the Garter on 5 February 1836. He had been a member of Grey's commission of inquiry into the Church of England in 1832&#150;4 and was reappointed by Melbourne on 6 June 1835. When the permanent ecclesiastical commission was established in 1836, he was an <i>ex officio</i> member as president of the council. State grants for education had been initiated in 1833 and the whigs were eager to use them to extend educational provision. On 10 April 1839 an order in council appointed a committee of the privy council to supervise these funds and Lansdowne, as lord president, named James Kay-Shuttleworth its first secretary. The established church strongly opposed government interference and was deeply suspicious that the privy council was being used to avoid parliamentary scrutiny. In a justly celebrated reply on 5 July to motions by the archbishop of Canterbury in the Lords against the committee and its policy, Lansdowne defended the scheme, arguing that the quantity and quality of education in Britain was less than in any other major European state except Spain and Russia, and that the diffusion of &#145;sound, moral, and religious instruction&#146; was the only way to make the uneducated &#145;useful, respectable, and orderly members of society&#146;. In the uninstructed children now growing out of infancy, he warned the peers, &#145;your Lordships may see the rising Chartists of the next age&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 48, 1839, 1263). A settlement was eventually reached at a conference at Lansdowne House between Lansdowne, Russell, the archbishop of Canterbury, and the bishops of London and Salisbury, at which most of the church's objections were met, and which was ratified as the so-called <span class="roman">Concordat</span> of 1840.<h2>
<a name="Oppositionandgovernment18421852"></a>Opposition and government, 1842&#150;1852</h2>After Melbourne's stroke on 23 October 1842, Lansdowne effectively became the whig leader in the Lords. In the mid-1840s Peel's second ministry began to falter under his determination to repeal the corn laws. Lansdowne had been educated in the free trade traditions of the Scottish economists and the Benthamites. On 28 February 1812 he had attacked the protectionist orders in council as injurious to the manufacturing and commercial interests of the country, and, when on 26 May 1820 he moved in the Lords for a select committee to inquire into the means of extending and improving the country's foreign trade in order to relieve distress in the manufacturing districts, he had observed:<blockquote>No axiom was more true than this&#151;that it was by growing what the territory of a country could grow most cheaply, and by receiving from other countries what it could not produce except at too great an expense, that the greatest degree of happiness was to be communicated to the greatest extent of population. (<span class="italic">Hansard 2</span>, 1, 1820, 549)</blockquote>However, he was no doctrinaire theorist and although he thought the onus was on those who wished to restrict free trade to prove their case, he acknowledged there were occasions when this could be justified. Thus, when the whigs adopted a free trade budget before they went out of office in 1841, Lansdowne was among those who had reservations. During the unsuccessful whig attempt to form a government in December 1845, he persuaded Russell to make the repeal of the corn laws more acceptable to the landed interest by offering &pound;1 million compensation without increased taxation. As a major Irish landowner he particularly feared the effect that unrestrained free trade would have on that country, and personally favoured a fixed duty on corn. Palmerston, meanwhile, was advocating a coalition of whigs and protectionists. In alarm, Russell asked Lansdowne to summon a meeting of all whig peers at Lansdowne House on 23 May 1846. At it Russell told them he would not lead a government supporting a fixed duty and, to maintain party unity, Lansdowne urged the peers to follow his lead, and put aside their own preferences to support Peel's total repeal of the corn laws.<br>
<br>Following the fall of Peel in June 1846, Lansdowne played an important role in the formation of Russell's ministry, and was one of those who argued that the more sympathetic members of Peel's cabinet should be invited to stay in office. His advocacy of a coalition with the Peelites was to continue throughout the life of the government. He himself once more became lord president of the council on 6 July, and leader of the House of Lords. Lansdowne's position was to be an unenviable one, not least because during the next five years he was forced frequently to defend Palmerston's indiscretions in a house with an inbuilt tory majority, leading him to complain that Stanley was the real leader of the Lords. To remedy this Russell proposed the introduction of life peerages to be conferred on Liberals. Lansdowne was not opposed to this in principle, as was shown by his position during the Parke case in 1856, but thought a controversy would be more trouble than it was worth, and favoured merely some hereditary Liberal additions or the calling up of Scottish or Irish peers.<br>
<br>In 1851 Russell decided to resign after the defeat in the Commons on 20 February of his plans for parliamentary reform. The queen refused to accept his resignation until she had seen Lansdowne, who was summoned from Bowood to London on 22 February for an audience at which he supported Russell's decision. However, Stanley failed to form a government, nor did a coalition of Peelites and whigs prove viable. On 28 February the former ministers met at Lansdowne House to determine their next move, and Russell suggested the queen seek the advice of Lansdowne after the meeting. He was unable to suggest anything, though &#145;offered to do whatever might be most conducive to the Queen's comfort&#151;stay out of office, or come into office&#151;as might be thought the most useful&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Queen Victoria</span>, 2.309). In fact, the old government carried on until 21 February 1852. Lansdowne was rightly seen as a restraining influence on Russell's enthusiasm for parliamentary reform. He, for his part, told Greville &#145;that if any strong measure was to be contemplated by the Cabinet, I should immediately walk out of it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Greville Memoirs</span>, 6.423).<h2>
<a name="Theelderstatesman18521863"></a>The elder statesman, 1852&#150;1863</h2>During the ministerial crisis of 1851 Lansdowne, who was now in his seventies, had made clear his desire to stand down from his offices. When he announced the government's resignation to the Lords on 23 February 1852, he also signalled his own effective retirement from public life: &#145;I think the time has arrived when I may reasonably dispense with a constant, or &hellip; compulsory attendance upon the proceedings of this House&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 119, 1852, 883). By this time he had been widowed: Lady Lansdowne died on 3 April 1851. A subscription was raised for a bust of Lansdowne by Marochetti, but he was not to escape so easily. The Liberals in opposition were divided and, among others, Palmerston pressed for him to take the lead in any new Liberal government. Lansdowne rebuffed the suggestion, loyally supporting Russell&#151;even the latter's assurance that he would serve under him made him no more willing to shoulder the burden of office. On 17 December Derby's government was defeated on the budget and resigned. The queen sent for Aberdeen and for Lansdowne, who was ill with gout and could not travel to Osborne. Before leaving to see the queen on 19 December Aberdeen visited him at Lansdowne House and the two statesmen tried to persuade each other to take office. In fact, the queen thought Lansdowne too old and ill to be prime minister, as well as suspecting that the Peelites would not serve under him. In spite of his show of reluctance, Aberdeen was in any case determined to be prime minister and Lansdowne's indisposition and genuine disinclination rendered the matter a foregone conclusion. The chief difficulty in forming the ministry lay in conciliating Russell, and Lansdowne played a leading role in persuading him to serve as foreign secretary. He himself agreed to be a member of the cabinet without portfolio.<br>
<br>When Aberdeen's ministry fell on 30 January 1855, after the defection of Russell and its defeat on the conduct of the Crimean War, many whigs expected the queen to send for Lansdowne and still hoped he would lead a new government. In the event, she sent for Derby. After his failure to form a government she consulted Lansdowne. The problem on the Liberal side was that neither Russell nor Palmerston would serve under each other. As both had expressed a willingness to serve under Lansdowne the queen urged him to form a government, but he protested his age and health meant that such a ministry might only last a few months, and advised her to send for Russell. Privately, he was convinced that Russell could not form a government and, since it would have had to rely on radical support, would not have served with him had he done so. Events vindicated his judgement and Palmerston succeeded where Russell had failed. Such was Lansdowne's prestige that Palmerston hoped that he would be the &#145;Organ of the Government&#146; in the Lords and, while other ministers performed the ordinary duties of leader of the house, that he would be &#145;the directing chief, who would give a character and tone to the body&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Queen Victoria</span>, 3.102). Lansdowne insisted that Granville be leader in the Lords but signified his approval of the ministry by once again serving in the cabinet without portfolio until Palmerston's resignation on 21 February 1858.<br>
<br>Aside from his other interests Lansdowne was an active connoisseur of the arts. His father's debts and his brother's eccentricities had caused the family collections to be scattered. When he inherited Bowood, it was nearly derelict. Lansdowne refurbished it and employed C. R. Cockerell to build the chapel in 1821. He bought back his father's collection of ancient marbles from his brother's widow, and commissioned Robert Smirke to complete the construction of a sculpture gallery to house them at Lansdowne House. He also assembled a large collection of paintings (including many by Reynolds), watercolours, and drawings. He became a trustee of the British Museum in 1827, of the National Gallery in 1834, and of the National Portrait Gallery in 1856. He was appointed to the royal commission for promoting the fine arts in 1841.<br>
<br>Lansdowne's longevity&#151;<span class="italic">The Times</span>'s obituary (2 February 1863) observed &#145;His Life is the history of the Whigs during the present century&#146;&#151;coupled with his birth, ability, and amiability assured him an outstanding place in the public life and affections of the country. All remarked on his mildness of temper, while his benevolence is typified by the support he afforded to the Irish poet Thomas Moore over several decades. Though his devotion to the whig party was never in doubt, he was by nature conciliatory and always ready to work with and meet the concerns of political opponents. Over the years this exasperated his more enthusiastic colleagues. In the 1830s Brougham dubbed him &#145;Mother Elizabeth&#146; and in the late 1840s the younger Grey stigmatized Lansdowne and his associates in the party as &#145;old women&#146;. However, his experience and reputation for fair-mindedness enabled him, in the years after Wellington's death, to fill the duke's role as leading constitutional adviser to the crown. In September 1857 Palmerston conveyed the queen's offer of a dukedom, and it was widely regretted that modesty and an unwillingness to exchange &#145;that name which has now been mine for so many years, &amp; with which my publick character such as it is has become identified&#146;  (BL, Bowood MSS, Lans. 3/42/72) led him to decline the honour. Following his death many tributes, including a much quoted poem in <span class="italic">Punch</span> (14 February 1863), attributed to Tom Taylor, described him, after the wise old warrior in the <span class="italic">Iliad</span>, as the Nestor of his age . In the Lords on 5 February 1863, Russell commented that &#145;while he dearly loved the Constitution, he was a friend to every improvement, every well-considered advance that could be made in our institutions&#146; and commended his politics as &#145;alike favourable to liberty and order&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 169, 1863, 51).<br>
<br>On 21 January 1863 Lansdowne, who, though still active, had grown increasingly deaf and frail, fell on the terrace at Bowood and cut his head. His strength slowly failed and he died on 31 January at Bowood, where he was buried on 7 February.<br>
