<span class="headword">Scott,  Francis George</span>  (1880&#150;1958), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born on 25 January 1880 at 6 Oliver Crescent, Hawick, Roxburghshire, the second son and youngest of three children of George Scott (<i>d</i>. 1907), supplier of loom parts, and his second wife, Janet Greenwood (<i>d</i>. 1897). The boy was proud to share a birthday with Robert Burns. Educated at Hawick Academy and Brand's Teviot Grove Academy, Hawick, he took piano lessons until he began composing at fifteen, when his parents halted them, lest music should distract him from schoolwork.<br>
<br>In 1897 Scott went to read English at Edinburgh University and train as a teacher at Moray House college of education. He gave up his degree course in the second year, however, disliking the constraints of academic life. He taught English at schools in Hawick and Falkirk before Langholm Academy engaged him in 1903. Meanwhile he studied externally for a music degree from Durham University (1902&#150;9).<br>
<br>Scott transferred to Dunoon grammar school in 1912, and there fell in love with a colleague named Burges Gray (<i>d</i>. 1967), who gave birth to their daughter, Francine, in Paris in 1914. They married at Fraserburgh on 4 September 1915 and rented a flat in the Langside area of Glasgow, where Scott worked at a succession of schools: Kelvinhaugh (1914&#150;15), Kennedy Street (1915&#150;19), and Townhead (1919&#150;25). The couple had three more children, Lilias, George, and Malcolm, by 1927.<br>
<br>Marriage and fatherhood coincided with the musical metamorphosis of F. G. Scott. He had been writing songs in late Romantic style; a few featured in a concert at Greenock in 1912. When a listener said that they were as good as Richard Strauss's lieder, Scott recognized his unoriginality and determined to evolve a fresh musical idiom&#151;not only for himself but for Scotland. Calvinism, poverty, and the absence of a royal court had historically stunted any native tradition of art music. He hoped to fill this gap in the national culture by deriving a distinctively Scottish style from folk-song, Scots poetry and speech rhythm, and pibroch (the ancient bagpipe music of the Gaels). His wife, a trained mezzo-soprano, made him aware of the subtleties of vocal writing. All his most important works are short solo songs with piano accompaniment, of which he composed over 200 and published 125 (largely at his own expense).<br>
<br>The earlier of the five volumes of Scott's <span class="italic">Scottish Lyrics Set to Music</span> (1922&#150;39) provided new melodies for verses by Burns; they could not displace in public affection the genuine folk-tunes already associated with the words, though some literary figures praised their sensitivity. Scott mixed very little with other musicians but enjoyed discussing his work with the poet Edwin Muir and the French lecturer Denis Saurat. In public he came across as a formidable Edwardian schoolmaster, with watch-chain, bow tie, and a booming voice. Piercing blue eyes stared out from beneath a beetle-brow, whose height was enhanced by the brushing-back of his thick grey hair. The nose was sharp, the mouth tight-lipped, and he could be as fierce as he looked. But his private character had a mischievous streak, and friends could not tell whether his solemn exterior was the residue of a Presbyterian upbringing or something of a pose: a backdrop of &#145;respectability&#146; to show off his iconoclastic opinions to more startling effect. Intellectual argument delighted &#145;FG&#146;, who sometimes defended outrageous views until he burst out laughing. The explosive vigour of the man was in contrast to the frequent delicacy of his music.<br>
<br>Scott learned in 1923 that the poet known as Hugh MacDiarmid was actually Christopher Murray Grieve, once his star pupil at Langholm. Their reunion gave rise to a creative partnership which aimed at saving Scotland from torpid Anglicized provincialism. By re-establishing Scots as a literary language and starting a ferment of poetry and music, they sought to initiate a &#145;Scottish Renaissance&#146;. With his twenty-two MacDiarmid settings, Scott confounded those who might have dismissed him as a mere purveyor of pastiche folk-song. Here was music both recognizably Scottish and thoroughly contemporary, capturing the mood and meaning of the poems in ways which seemed strikingly expressive and spontaneous. The songs ranged from the dramatic and eerie to the lyrical or comic. Chief among them are &#145;Country Life&#146; (1923), &#145;Crowdieknowe&#146; (1924), &#145;The Eemis Stane&#146; (1924), &#145;Moonstruck&#146; (1929), and &#145;Milkwort and Bog-Cotton&#146; (1932).<br>
<br>Echoes of B&eacute;la Bart&oacute;k and Arnold Schoenberg in his harmonies testify to the fact that Scott was never a chauvinist. He scorned most British composers, admittedly, but saw Scottishness as his contribution to international music. In 1921 the French composer Jean Jules Roger-Ducasse had offered him free tuition in Paris; Scott felt unable to leave Glasgow. There was always tension between his absorption in art and his desire for a stable family life and steady income. In 1925 he became music lecturer at Jordanhill training college for teachers and moved to a terraced house in Munro Road, Glasgow.<br>
<br>Scott and Grieve drifted apart in the 1930s, as the poet became more political. FG was also a left-wing Scottish nationalist, yet he saw separatist agitation as premature. He tried his hand at orchestral pieces (clumsily perhaps) and obtained lyrics for new songs from William Soutar and the poems of the fifteenth-century bard Dunbar.<br>
<br>Scott's music was heard by only an infinitesimal public even in Scotland, as he made no concession to commercialism. Grieve and Kaikhosru Sorabji declared him the equal of Hugo Wolf or Gabriel Faur&eacute;; others disparaged him as the house composer of a cranky clique. Arguably, the enthusiasm of Scottish nationalists for his work narrowed its appeal. After 1945 performances did multiply, thanks in part to the Scottish Arts Council and the Saltire Society, which aided the publication of <span class="italic">Thirty-Five Scottish Lyrics and other Poems</span> (1949). Scott, who retired in 1946, was senile by 1957, when Glasgow University awarded him a doctorate. He died at his home, 44 Munro Road, Glasgow, on 6 November 1958 and was buried in Wellogate cemetery, Hawick.<br>
<br>The songs of F. G. Scott subsequently found favour with Scottish recitalists, though the Scots language still scared off English singers. A musical miniaturist of exceptional individuality, he remained much admired by a few and all but unknown to the rest.<br>
