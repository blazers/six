<span class="headword">Pole, Sir  Geoffrey</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1558), <span class="occ">alleged conspirator</span>, was the youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75344/', "Sir Richard Pole (1458/9&#150;1504)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22451/', "Pole, Margaret")</script>] and his wife, Margaret Plantagenet (1473&#150;1541) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22451/', "Pole, Margaret")</script>], daughter of George, duke of Clarence, and later countess of Salisbury. Little is known of him before his wife, Constance (<i>d</i>. in or after 1570), inherited the manor of Lordington, Sussex, from her father, Sir Edmund Pakenham, in 1528 and his own knighting, after 3 November 1529. Lordington became Pole's residence; he and his wife had five sons and five daughters. In 1530 and 1531 he appeared in property disputes, the first arising from his forcible expulsion of a tenant on Christmas eve 1529, the second a Star Chamber case in which he featured as an encloser. He was also then a JP for Hampshire and Sussex, and remained so intermittently until 1538. He sat for Wilton in the parliament of 1529 by his mother's nomination and probably remained a member throughout the Reformation Parliament&#151;George Crofts later testified that Pole had often expressed dislike of its proceedings. He was a client of Thomas Cromwell by 1533, when he served at Anne Boleyn's coronation on 1 June and was paid &pound;40 on Cromwell's orders. Later that month he dined with the now bastardized Princess Mary, in whose service he may have been, and then or shortly afterwards began to frequent Eustace Chapuys, the imperial ambassador, begging him to inform Charles V how easy the conquest of England would be, and asking to go to Spain. Instead Chapuys used Geoffrey as a conduit to his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22456/', "Reginald Pole")</script> in Italy. Pole was also in the confidence of the French ambassador, who told him of attempts to defend Reginald. John Stokesley, bishop of London, was among his confidants and patrons, and Pole had a manuscript of Sir Thomas More's <span class="italic">History of Richard III</span>. In short, Geoffrey had a much higher profile in the opposition to Henry VIII's policies than his mother or his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22448/', "Henry Pole, Lord Montagu")</script>.<br>
<br>In October 1536 Geoffrey Pole was indicted for riot, at about the same time that he was ordered to serve against the Pilgrimage of Grace with twenty men. In January 1537 he learned of Reginald's promotion as cardinal, although unlike his mother and elder brother he was not asked to try to dissuade him from accepting. This was probably because Henry VIII, to whom Pole was now in debt, had already banned him from court; he had certainly done so by April that year. Pole sought Cromwell's mediation, but in October he was flatly refused admission to court. Still trusting in Cromwell, in early 1538 Pole may have gone to him fearing the construction put upon his support of the influential Catholic polemicist John Helyar, who was in exile, through his dependant Hugh Holland, a former pirate. Cromwell promised to take care of him, but did so by committing Geoffrey to the Tower on 29 August 1538. By coincidence, at almost exactly the same time Geoffrey's name came up in the examination near Exeter of one Gulphinus Abevan, who claimed to have been in service with Reginald Pole and to have moved to Geoffrey's. Although this testimony is probably fantasy, Abevan knew enough about the Poles to play on the bad feeling between Geoffrey and his brother Henry; this had a great deal to do with the family's downfall at Geoffrey's hands. His correspondence with his brother Reginald was also held against Geoffrey.<br>
<br>Pole further suffered as a result of his bad relations with his fellow JPs, notably Sir William Goring and John Gunter. Goring turned up evidence of Pole's patronage of Helyar, and Gunter arrested a woman who claimed that Pole meant to send men to Reginald (although the tale originally came from one of Gunter's own servants). Thomas Theobald from Padua reported just what the government feared most: Sir Geoffrey's arrest was expected to cause Reginald Pole to write more against the king. On 26 October Pole's interrogations began. The first set of questions concerned his correspondence with Reginald and his relations with Helyar. These (and most other surviving sets of interrogatories) may never have been used, since Pole confessed only to approving Reginald's actions and having talked to others, including his brother Henry, about reversing religious policy in England. Almost immediately afterwards Pole made the first of two attempts at suicide. He signed his second confession on 2 November &#145;Your humble slave, Geffrey Pole&#146;, in a state of collapse.<br>
<br>The evidence continued to mount against Pole. Elizabeth Darrell testified that he had said of Peter Mewtas, sent to assassinate Reginald, &#145;By God's blood, and if he had slain him I would have thrust my dagger [in] him [althou]gh he had [been] at the king's heels&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 1/138, fol. 160<i>r</i>). The most serious charge quickly became Pole's burning of correspondence on Henry Pole's orders. On 11 November Holland offered the most damaging evidence. In addition to Pole's support for Helyar, he stressed Pole's wish to go overseas, and incidentally revealed his strained relations with his brothers, both of whom tried to make him cease his dangerous actions. As Geoffrey's interrogation progressed, he revealed more and more information about Henry Pole. Geoffrey claimed that his brother had smuggled him to the Calais interview between Henry VIII and Fran&ccedil;ois I in 1532 and used him to tell Queen Catherine afterwards that nothing had been done about the Boleyn marriage. No doubt motivated by word from his wife (imprisoned with him) that his brother thought him insane, Pole also gave his interrogators the names of two of Henry Pole's servants who produced much damning material, while his former dependant John Collins, then in Henry's service, revealed almost as much hurtful information as Geoffrey did.<br>
<br>In his final examination Geoffrey testified that Henry Pole had wished him to continue to serve Mary rather than the king, whom he had never loved. Pole also claimed that Crofts had encouraged him to leave England, giving him twenty nobles, but then changed his mind after a vision of the Virgin Mary telling him this would ruin his family. It also began to emerge that Pole had tried to suppress evidence against himself. Crofts, brought into the net, testified that Pole had expressed ambiguous reservations about serving against the Pilgrimage, confirmed Geoffrey's story of his own involvement in the former's plans to flee, and added that he had asked Henry Pole to pay Geoffrey's debts in order to remove a motive for flight, which Henry had done. The preliminary version of Pole's indictment singled out his links with Holland and Crofts (who were both executed) and his distaste for service against the Pilgrims. His formal indictment resembled his brother's, with the added charge about the Pilgrimage. Unlike his brother, Geoffrey pleaded guilty. He was pardoned on 2 January 1539, having once more tried to kill himself. A later story claimed that his wife had begged for his life, and then cured his madness with masses. His testimony made him the star witness in the government's propaganda against the Exeter or Courtenay conspiracy, especially in Richard Morison's <span class="italic">An Invective Ayenste &hellip; Treason</span> (1539), although Morison could not resist insulting Pole's limited intelligence and &#145;frenzy&#146;.<br>
<br>Pole's reward was Cromwell's intercession in a property case at about the same time that the rest of his family was being attainted, and the minister seems also to have assigned Pole a pension. Moreover Cromwell protected Pole in early 1540 when he wounded his fellow JP Gunter in revenge for Gunter's revelations during his imprisonment. Sir William Fitzwilliam, Cromwell's agent in Chichester, worried that imprisoning Pole for assault in early 1540 would &#145;reduce him into his phrenzy or some other inconvenience&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 15, no. 681). The privy council refused to concur and had Pole committed to the Fleet, but he received a pardon just four days later, albeit along with another banishment from court. A year later Pole attacked his parish priest, but he escaped trouble by delating the priest for treason. In May 1544 he and (perhaps significantly) his wife were granted some of his mother's property, which they immediately alienated to Sir Thomas Moyle, and in December 1545 he was licensed to export 1000 dickers of leather.<br>
<br>Some time in 1548 Pole fled from England, perhaps because he had hatched a conspiracy with Anthony Fortescue, marshal of the army in Ireland. Before his flight he quitclaimed Lordington to Edmund Ford, a fellow Sussex landowner and Catholic. Pole claimed to have gone to his brother Reginald, from whom he received a pension, and spent much of his time in Li&egrave;ge. He unsuccessfully approached three English ambassadors for permission to return in 1550. In the following year rumours were being spread on the continent about his seditious activities in England, and at the end of 1552 Pole wrote to the duke of Northumberland asking for a safe conduct home, perhaps hoping that his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22443/', "Arthur Pole")</script>, released from prison and in Northumberland's service, would intercede for him; but he was exempted from the general pardon issued in March 1553.<br>
<br>In September 1553 Geoffrey Pole finally returned home, allegedly on a mission from Reginald, though this is unlikely since the cardinal had officially sent two other much more reliable agents at the same time. Edward Courtenay, son of the marquess of Exeter whom Geoffrey had brought down in 1538, threatened to kill him, and the council had Geoffrey guarded. This episode helped to fuel imperial resistance to Reginald's returning to England. A year later, however, Pole was pardoned and granted an annuity of &pound;50, as well as the keepership of Slindon Park. On 5 April 1555 his brother gave him a dispensation for a portable altar at Lordington. Pole was somehow mixed up in the Dudley conspiracy of 1555&#150;6, but seems to have suffered no consequences. William Peto attended him on his deathbed in early November 1558, and Cardinal Pole tried to provide for his nine children, although he left them nothing in his will and refused to pervert justice by favouring an action brought by a suitor for one of Geoffrey's daughters who had offered to marry her without a dowry. Pole was buried in the church of Stoughton near Chichester. Twelve years later his widow asked in her will to be buried alongside him. Two of their sons, Arthur and Geoffrey, became involved with Sir Anthony Fortescue in a bizarre astrologically inspired conspiracy against Elizabeth in 1562. Arrested and condemned, they were held in the Tower until their deaths, about 1570.<br>
