<span class="headword">Bland,  John</span>  (1702&#150;1749), <span class="occ">writing master and accountant</span>, was born in Crutched Friars, London, on 17 August 1702, the son of a clerk in the custom house. He spent four years at Westminster School, where, according to William Massey, &#145;he principally formed his hand&#146;  (Massey, 2.26). After leaving this school in 1714 he was apprenticed to Charles Snell, the writing master at Sir John Johnson's Free Writing School in Foster Lane. It appears that Bland did not complete his full indenture with Snell; in 1717 he followed his father into the custom house, where he too worked as a clerk until 1726. In this profession he must have become familiar with all the standard forms of commercial documentation, such as bills of lading and invoices, that would eventually form the basis of his output as a writing master.<br>
<br>Bland's career as a penman did not begin until 1726, when he took up the post of writing master at Mr Watt's academy in Little Tower Street, where he taught for the next thirteen years. During that period he published his <span class="italic">Essay in Writing Exemplified in Forms of Business</span> (1730), which won him the reputation for specializing in utilitarian writing styles designed to facilitate communication in &#145;trade, and mercantile affairs&#146;  (Massey, 2.27). In 1739 he left Watt's establishment to set up his own academy in Bishopsgate Street, where he taught writing and accounts to youths destined for a mercantile career. He seems to have published only one copybook by himself; however, several examples of his calligraphy were included in compilations engraved by George Bickham, such as <span class="italic">Penmanship in its Utmost Beauty and Extent</span> (1731).<br>
<br>Bland died on 21 January 1749 at Cornhill, and was buried in St Martin's Outwich, Threadneedle Street. From Massey's account of his funeral we can surmise that Bland was a well-liked man: despite the frequent acrimony and competition between writing masters, Bland was carried to his grave by a number of his profession, as well as two of the teachers who worked at his academy.<br>
