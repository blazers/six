<span class="headword">Kell,  Reginald Clifford</span>  (1906&#150;1981), <span class="occ">clarinettist</span>, was born on 8 June 1906 at 164 Bishopthorpe Road, York, the eldest in the family of two sons and one daughter of Frederick Kell, a theatre music director, and his wife, Edith Porter. As a child he studied the violin, but after leaving school at fourteen he taught himself the clarinet, and joined his father's band. Within a year of taking up the clarinet he was playing in the orchestra at the Opera House, Harrogate, for the silent films, and in 1929 he won an open scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music to study with Haydn Draper, and moved to London. While still a student he played in the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra from 1930 to 1931, and on leaving the Royal Academy in 1932 he was invited by Sir Thomas Beecham to take the position of principal clarinettist in his newly formed London Philharmonic Orchestra, chosen because his tone was similar to that of the principal oboist, Leon Goossens. At the same time he was principal clarinettist of the Covent Garden Opera House orchestra, from 1932 to 1936, and from 1935 to 1939 he taught at the Royal Academy; he was made FRAM in 1941. On 23 August 1936 he married Diana Gabrielle (<i>b</i>. 1915/16), daughter of the composer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40560/', "Joseph Holbrooke (1878&#150;1958)")</script> and sister of Gwydion Brooke, principal bassoonist in the London Philharmonic Orchestra. They had one son.<br>
<br>Kell left the London Philharmonic Orchestra in 1936 after a financial disagreement with Beecham, and for the next twelve years continued to pursue a busy orchestral career. From 1936 to 1939 he was principal clarinettist of the London Symphony Orchestra, finding time also to adjudicate at the international festival of woodwind playing in Vienna in 1938, played in the Toscanini International Orchestra at the Lucerne festival in 1939, and then joined the BBC Salon Orchestra, formed in 1939 to broadcast high-quality light music during the war. The Salon Orchestra was based in Bristol until 1941, when it moved to Evesham, and before it was disbanded in July 1942 Walter Legge, recording manager of EMI, recorded several works with some of the leading players, including Kell; his first recordings of the Mozart and Brahms clarinet trios date from 1941. Kell was principal clarinettist of the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra from 1942 to 1945. When Walter Legge founded the Philharmonia Orchestra in 1945, he appointed Kell principal clarinettist, and at the orchestra's first public concert, in the Kingsway Hall on 27 October 1945, Kell played the Mozart clarinet concerto in an all-Mozart programme conducted by Beecham. He also became principal clarinettist of Beecham's new orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, in 1946, while remaining at the Philharmonia until 1948.<br>
<br>After touring the United States with the Busch Quartet in November 1948, Kell decided to give up orchestral playing in order to pursue a solo and chamber music career, and emigrated to the United States, where his style of playing became very popular. As well as performing in the United States and Canada, he was a professor at the Aspen Music School in Colorado from 1951 to 1957. He spent 1958 to 1959 in England, teaching at the Royal Academy, where his pupils included Harrison Birtwistle and Alan Hacker, and gave his last solo performance in 1959 at the Bath Festival, playing the Mozart clarinet concerto conducted by Yehudi Menuhin. He then took up an administrative appointment as a director of the band instrument division of the musical instrument distributors Boosey and Hawkes in New York, from 1959 to 1966.<br>
<br>Kell made many fine recordings; one of his most famous was that of the Brahms clarinet quintet, with the Busch Quartet, recorded in 1937, and his recording of Schubert's &#145;Der Hirt auf dem Felsen&#146; with Elizabeth Schumann in 1936 was a landmark. Other recordings included the first complete version of Schumann's <span class="italic">Phantasiest&uuml;cke</span>. In 1939 he recorded one of the two clarinet quintets composed by his father-in-law, Joseph Holbrooke. He had a very sweet and expressive tone, influenced by the oboe playing of Leon Goossens, and used a lot of vibrato, in contrast to the firm, clear tone of his contemporary Frederick Thurston, the other leading British clarinettist of his generation, although there were some who found his use of vibrato and his free use of rhythm excessive. <span class="italic">17 Staccato Studies</span> (1958) and a clarinet tutor, the <span class="italic">Kell Method</span> (1968), were published in New York.<br>
<br>In 1971 Kell returned to live in England, and in his retirement took up watercolour painting, but in 1975 he moved back to America. In 1978 he exhibited a one-man show during the Aspen music festival. He died on 5 August 1981 in Frankport, Kentucky, USA. He was survived by his wife.<br>
