<span class="headword">Plowden,  Francis Peter</span>  (1749&#150;1829), <span class="occ">lawyer and historian</span>, the eighth son of William Ignatius Plowden, of Plowden, Shropshire, and Frances Dormer, daughter of Charles, Baron Dormer, was born at Plowden on 28 June 1749. His brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22388/', "Charles Plowden")</script>, later became rector of Stonyhurst College. Francis received his education in the college of the English Jesuits at St Omer, France. He entered the noviciate of the Society of Jesus at Watten, near St Omer, on 7 September 1766, and was master of the college at Bruges from 1771 to 1773. At the time of the papal bull suppressing the Society of Jesus, Plowden had not taken holy orders. He therefore found himself released from his first or simple vows of religion, and returned to a secular life in 1773. He entered the Middle Temple, and for some years practised with success as a conveyancer. On 5 July 1793 he received an honorary DCL from Oxford University in consequence of the publication of his <span class="italic">Jura Anglorum: the Rights of Englishmen</span>.<br>
<br>With the lifting of the restrictions preventing Roman Catholics from pleading, Plowden was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1796. He would have acquired considerable practice in the chancery courts had he not been held back by a misunderstanding with the lord chancellor. He became eminent, however, as a legal and political writer, and published several pamphlets against William Pitt the younger. His <span class="italic">Historical Review of the State of Ireland</span> (1803) was apparently written under the patronage of the government, although he attacked the ministry in a preliminary preface. In 1813 a prosecution was instituted against him at the Lifford assizes by a Mr Hart, who was connected with the government, for a libel contained in his <span class="italic">History of Ireland</span> (1811). A verdict was returned for the plaintiff, with &pound;5000 damages. To avoid payment of this sum, Plowden fled to France and settled in Paris, where he was appointed a professor in the Scots College.<br>
<br>Plowden was married to Dorothea (<i>d</i>. 1827), daughter of Griffith Philipps of Cwmgwili (MP for Carmarthen, 1751&#150;61, 1768&#150;74). Dorothea was the author of <span class="italic">Virginia</span> (1800), a comic opera which was performed at Drury Lane, and condemned the first night. Of their children, a son, Captain Plowden, aide-de-camp to General Churchill, was killed in a duel in Jamaica, and Anna Maria (<i>d</i>. 1822) was the third wife of Archibald Cochrane, ninth earl of Dundonald. Plowden was a man of acknowledged talent, and a staunch whig in politics, but in his worldly affairs he was somewhat improvident. In addition to his histories of Ireland he was the author of numerous other works on British history and constitutional law. He died at his residence in the rue Vaugirard on 4 January 1829.<br>
