<span class="headword">Towry,  George Henry</span>  (1767&#150;1809), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, born on 4 March 1767, one of a family which for several generations had served in or been connected with the navy, was the son of George Philipps Towry, for many years a commissioner of victualling. His grandfather Henry John Philipps Towry (<i>d</i>. 1762), a naval captain, was the nephew of Captain John Towry (<i>d</i>. 1757), sometime commissioner of the navy at Port Mahon, and took the name of Towry on succeeding to his uncle's property in 1760. George Henry Towry was for some time at Eton College while his name was on the books of various ships. In June 1782 he joined the <i>Alexander</i> as captain's servant with Lord Longford, and was present at the relief of Gibraltar under Lord Howe and the encounter with the allied fleet off Cape Spartel. He afterwards served in the <i>Carnatic</i> with Captain Molloy, in the yacht <i>Royal Charlotte</i> with Captain William Cornwallis, and in the <i>Europa</i>. From October 1784 to March 1786 he was in the <i>Hebe</i> with Captain Edward Thornbrough, in which ship Prince William Henry (later William IV) was a lieutenant, and from March 1786 to December 1787 was in the <i>Pegasus</i>, with Prince William as captain. On 6 February 1788 Towry passed his examination and on 23 October 1790 was promoted lieutenant. Early in 1793, at Lord Hood's request, he was appointed to the <i>Victory</i>, in which he went to the Mediterranean, where on 14 September 1793 he was made commander. On 18 June 1794 he was posted to the frigate <i>Dido</i> (28 guns).<br>
<br>On 24 June 1795, with the <i>Lowestoft</i> (32 guns), on her way from Minorca to look into Toulon, the <i>Dido</i> met two French frigates, the <i>Minerve</i> (40 guns) and the <i>Art&eacute;mise</i> (36 guns), both of them larger, heavier, and more heavily armed than the British ships; the <i>Minerve</i> alone was superior in broadside weight of shot to the <i>Dido</i> and <i>Lowestoft</i> together. Seeing this great apparent superiority, the French ships sailed towards the British, the <i>Minerve</i> leading. The <i>Dido</i> led the British ships and brought the <i>Minerve</i> to close action. The <i>Minerve</i>, being twice the weight of the <i>Dido</i>, attempted to run her down, but the <i>Dido</i>, swerving at the critical moment, received the blow obliquely and caught the <i>Minerve's</i> bowsprit in her mizen rigging. The heavy swell broke off the <i>Minerve</i>'s bowsprit and the <i>Dido</i>'s mizenmast, and the two ships lay by to clear away the wreck, when the <i>Lowestoft</i>, coming to the <i>Dido</i>'s support, completely dismasted the <i>Minerve</i>. On this the <i>Art&eacute;mise</i>, which had been firing distant broadsides at the British ships, fled. Towry, seeing that the <i>Minerve</i> could not escape, signalled the <i>Lowestoft</i> to chase, but recalled her an hour and a half later, seeing that pursuit was hopeless. When the <i>Lowestoft</i> again closed with the <i>Minerve</i>, and the <i>Dido</i>, having repaired her damages, came up, the Frenchman surrendered. The British success was due largely to the misconduct of the <i>Art&eacute;mise</i>'s captain, but the capture of such a ship as the <i>Minerve</i> was a brilliant achievement and was praised by Nelson, who wrote to his wife: &#145;Thank God the superiority of the British navy remains, and I hope ever will: I feel quite delighted at the event&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dispatches and Letters</span>, 2.48).<br>
<br>The <i>Minerve</i> was brought into the service and Towry was appointed to command her, but in April 1796 he was moved by Sir John Jervis (afterwards the earl of St Vincent) to the <i>Diadem</i> (64 guns). During the year he was detached in the <i>Diadem</i> under the orders of Commodore Nelson, who for part of the time hoisted his broad pennant on board her, notably at the evacuation of Corsica in October  (<span class="italic">Dispatches and Letters</span>, 2.300&#150;02). Off Cape St Vincent on 14 February 1797 the <i>Diadem</i>, still commanded by Towry, closed the line, but had no very prominent part in the battle. Towards the end of the year she was sent to England. In December 1798 Towry was appointed to command the frigate <i>Uranie</i> (38 guns), in which, and afterwards in the <i>Cambrian</i>, he continued until the peace. In July 1803 he was appointed to the <i>Tribune</i>, which he commanded in the channel during the early months of the winter. Under the severity of the work his health gave way, and in January 1804 he was obliged to take sick leave. From May 1804 to June 1806 he commanded the yacht <i>Royal Charlotte</i>, and was afterwards one of the commissioners for the transport service. He married in 1802 a Miss or Mrs Chamberlayne (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1806); of their children a son and a daughter survived. Towry died in his father's house in Somerset Place, London, on 9 April 1809, and was buried on 17 April at St Marylebone.<br>
