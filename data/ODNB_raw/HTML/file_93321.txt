<span class="headword">Unsworth,  Geoffrey Gilyard</span>  (1914&#150;1978), <span class="occ">cinematographer</span>, was born at 186 Bolton Road, Atherton, near Leigh, Lancashire, on 26 May 1914, the son of Benjamin Hartley Unsworth (1886&#150;1957), blouse factory manager, and his wife, Edith Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Shephard (1888&#150;1971). He entered the film industry in 1932 as an apprentice camera assistant at the Lime Grove studios of the Gaumont-British Picture Corporation. He moved up through the ranks, from slate boy and focus puller to camera operator, working on films directed by Alfred Hitchcock and Victor Saville and on the MGM&#150;British production <span class="italic">A Yank at Oxford</span> (1938). In 1937 he joined the Technicolor Corporation, operating for Georges P&eacute;rinal on Alexander Korda's <span class="italic">The Drum</span> (1938) and <span class="italic">The Four Feathers</span> (1939), and on Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's <span class="italic">The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp</span> (1943) and, for Jack Cardiff, <span class="italic">A Matter of Life and Death</span> (1946). He married on 20 August 1938 Norah (<i>b</i>. 1912), daughter of Thomas Lang, electrical engineer.<br>
<br>Between 1941 and 1945 Unsworth did his first work as director of photography on a series of short documentaries for the British Council, as well as two commercials for Persil washing powder, all of which were filmed in Technicolor. Among the shorts was <span class="italic">Make Fruitful the Land</span> (1945), directed by Ken Annakin, with whom Unsworth would go on to work extensively in commercial features. Annakin described his cinematographer as &#145;an artist in judging only by the eye, the balance of daylight and artificial lights&#146;  (Annakin, 21).<br>
<br>Unsworth's first feature as director of photography was <span class="italic">The Laughing Lady</span> (1946), a musical vehicle for Anne Ziegler and Webster Booth. The same year he joined the Rank Organisation, where he was to remain for the next thirteen years. His early work included Gainsborough's first two colour productions, <span class="italic">The Man Within</span> (1946) and <span class="italic">Jassy</span> (1947), the former noted for its unusually subdued visual palette and the latter for its touches of expressionism. He contributed exterior location work to another costume melodrama, <span class="italic">Blanche Fury</span> (1948), and was one of three cameramen on Ealing's <span class="italic">Scott of the Antarctic</span> (1948), in his case filming second-unit material in Norway and Switzerland while Osmond Borradaile shot in Antarctica itself and the director of photography Jack Cardiff tried to match their contrasting footage with his studio work. This was a challenge that Unsworth himself often faced when reconstructing overseas locations on sound stages and in front of process screens. Another Ealing production, <span class="italic">Where No Vultures Fly</span> (1951), had the luxury of being shot mostly in Africa, but for Rank's <span class="italic">Simba</span> (1955) Unsworth had the impossible task of matching close-ups of his stars against back-projected backdrops with long shots of their doubles in Kenya. Similarly, while <span class="italic">The Purple Plain</span> (1954) included generous location shooting in Burma, for both <span class="italic">The Planter's Wife</span> (1952) and <span class="italic">A Town Like Alice</span> (1956) Malaya was a mock-up of Pinewood sets and home counties countryside. Nevertheless, this experience served as useful preparation for some of Unsworth's later, more technically complex projects.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1950s Unsworth alternated relatively big-budget Technicolor pictures such as the Walt Disney live-action swashbucklers <span class="italic">The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men</span> (1952, second unit only) and <span class="italic">The Sword and the Rose</span> (1953)&#151;both among the seven features he photographed for Ken Annakin&#151;with smaller-scale films in black and white. Among his more notable monochrome assignments were Robert Hamer's <span class="italic">The Spider and the Fly</span> (1949), Ralph Thomas's <span class="italic">The Clouded Yellow</span> (1950), Cy Endfield's <span class="italic">Hell Drivers</span> (1957), and four for Roy Baker, including <span class="italic">Passage Home</span> (1955), <span class="italic">Tiger in the Smoke</span> (1956), and <span class="italic">A Night to Remember</span> (1958). The first and last of these three contain impressive scenes of a storm at sea and the sinking of the <i>Titanic</i>, respectively, while <span class="italic">Tiger in the Smoke</span> has a strikingly atmospheric first half set in a London fog; all were created largely in the studio with the assistance of Unsworth's camerawork. He also embraced the new screen technologies of the era: <span class="italic">Hell Drivers</span>, Annakin's <span class="italic">Value for Money</span> (1955), and Brian Desmond Hurst's <span class="italic">Dangerous Exile</span> (1957) were all filmed in high-definition VistaVision, and with J. Lee Thompson's spectacular imperial adventure <span class="italic">North West Frontier</span> (1959) Unsworth encountered CinemaScope for the first time, using it to advantage with the (for once, genuine) Indian locations.<br>
<br>After this he departed Rank to work on a freelance basis, often photographing American-produced films shot in British studios or in foreign locales with British crews. They included <span class="italic">The World of Suzie Wong</span> (1960), <span class="italic">The 300 Spartans</span> (1962), and <span class="italic">Genghis Khan</span> (1965). For <span class="italic">Becket</span> (1964) Unsworth met the challenge of lighting the largest interior set ever built in Europe (a reconstruction of Canterbury Cathedral at Shepperton Studios), an achievement marked by the career milestone of his first British Film Academy award, for best colour cinematography. His second was for Stanley Kubrick's blockbuster <span class="italic">2001: a Space Odyssey</span> (1968), on which he participated in developing the front projection special-effects technique. This award was shared with his former assistant John Alcott, who took over after Unsworth left the production six months into a two-year shooting schedule, having found working with Kubrick frustrating.<br>
<br>Unsworth also worked on more intimate, but equally demanding, projects adapting stage performances to the cinema, including Anthony Asquith's <span class="italic">An Evening with the Royal Ballet</span> (1963), the National Theatre production of <span class="italic">Othello</span> (1965) with Laurence Olivier, and Olivier's own production of <span class="italic">Three Sisters</span> (1970) for the American Film Theatre. He also adapted his classical approach, still seen in the likes of <span class="italic">Cromwell</span> (1970), to incorporate the fashionable stylistic tricks of younger film-makers with a background in television, such as the zoom-lens aesthetics of <span class="italic">The Reckoning</span> (1969), <span class="italic">Goodbye Gemini</span> (1970), and <span class="italic">Say Hello to Yesterday</span> (1970). Unsworth's generation of cinematographers understood the professional need for flexibility and generally favoured self-effacement. But in the 1970s he found a signature style which remained with him for most of his later assignments. First fully developed in the musical <span class="italic">Half a Sixpence</span> (1967), it involved the use of fog filters, back lighting, and diffusion to create a soft, hazy appearance, with bright whites and haloed light sources, which particularly suited period subjects and gave a romantic glow to films of all kinds. This style reached its apotheosis in <span class="italic">Cabaret</span> (1972)&#151;another British Film Academy award recipient (jointly, with his work on <span class="italic">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</span>, 1972), and for which he was also awarded an Oscar. His distinctive style subsequently appeared in <span class="italic">Zardoz</span> (1974), <span class="italic">The Abdication</span> (1974), <span class="italic">Murder on the Orient Express</span> (1974), <span class="italic">The Return of the Pink Panther</span> (1975), <span class="italic">Lucky Lady</span> (1975), <span class="italic">A Bridge Too Far</span> (1977), and <span class="italic">Superman</span> (1978). Peter MacDonald, his camera operator for twenty years, described Unsworth as an intuitive impressionist: &#145;he liked muted colours and a muted feel to a scene. He would be happier when the sun was in than when it was out, because he could have that lovely overall light, rather than the brilliant sunlight that leaves heavy shadows everywhere&#146;  (MacDonald, 66). He was also particularly renowned for his skill and care in lighting his leading ladies. He was made an OBE in 1976.<br>
<br>Having completed <span class="italic">Superman</span> and part of what would become <span class="italic">Superman II</span> (1980), Unsworth began filming <span class="italic">Tess</span> (1979) for Roman Polanski on location in rural Brittany, France. On 29 October 1978 Unsworth died suddenly in Paris of a heart attack. At the time of his death he was married to his second wife, the film continuity supervisor Maggie Unsworth, and was the father of three children. He was replaced on <span class="italic">Tess</span> by Ghislain Cloquet and the resulting &#145;collaboration&#146;, like <span class="italic">2001</span> a remarkable stylistic unity, won for Unsworth a second Oscar and a fourth British Academy award (his third had been for the massive war epic <span class="italic">A Bridge Too Far</span>). The latter was not awarded until 1982, following <span class="italic">Tess</span>'s belated British release. The last four pictures on which Unsworth had worked were all released posthumously, and two of them&#151;<span class="italic">Superman</span> and <span class="italic">The First Great Train Robbery</span> (1978)&#151;were dedicated to his memory.<br>
