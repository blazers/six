<span class="headword">Strode, Sir  William</span>  (1562&#150;1637), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 5 March 1562, the only child of Richard Strode (1528&#150;1581), landowner, of Newnham, near Plymouth, Devon, and his wife, Frances Cromwell (<i>d</i>. 1563), daughter of Gregory, second Baron Cromwell. He was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1580, and avoided the penalties of wardship by marrying, on 15 July 1581, less than a month before his father's death, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1619), daughter of Thomas Southcote, landowner and tinner, of Bovey Tracey, Devon.<br>
<br>Strode was a JP for his county from the early 1590s and served as sheriff in 1593&#150;4. His ancestors had regularly sat for Plympton, the borough neighbouring the family seat of Newnham, since 1437, but in 1597 he became the first of the family to represent the county. He left no mark on this parliament, but he was knighted in 1598 and became surveyor of crown lands in Devon upon his father-in-law's resignation. He commanded the local stannary regiment during the threatened Spanish invasions.<br>
<br>Strode continued to sit in the next seven parliaments. In 1604 he complained that the king had been misinformed about proceedings in the House of Commons. No friend to the ecclesiastical hierarchy and a strong Calvinist, who in his home county actively supported the ministry of the militant rector of Modbury, Samuel Hieron, and later maintained weekly lecturers, Strode was named to most committees of puritan intent. On supply, he habitually favoured parsimony, not refusal, and in the interests of free speech preferred debate in committee, with the speaker out of the chair. Although he showed little inclination to comply with the government over purveyance, wardship, and union with Scotland, he was actively helpful with several private bills promoted on behalf of the earl of Salisbury, the king's chief minister. Bishop Cotton of Exeter complained that &#145;Sir William Strode's canvass against the ecclesiastical commission in Devon&#146; gained strength from the &#145;favourable respect&#146; in which he was held by the earl  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 18.297). In 1610 he initially supported the great contract to put government finance on a sounder footing and reduce unparliamentary taxation. His &#145;diligent attendance and good service to the House&#146; were noted in the <span class="italic">Commons' Journal</span>  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 1547&#150;1628, 350).<br>
<br>As recorder of Plymouth, Strode represented the borough in 1614, showing increased concern over commercial matters, especially the attempt of the Londoners to monopolize trade with France and Spain, and the imposition of customs duties by the crown. Predictably he was outraged by the speech of Bishop Richard Neile (once Salisbury's chaplain) describing the spirit of the lower house as undutiful and seditious. Plymouth corporation voted Strode &pound;20 for his services in parliament and &#145;for assisting the town in withstanding the patent for packing and salting of fish&#146;  (Worth, 152), but he was replaced as recorder before the next election by a lawyer.<br>
<br>Sitting again for his family borough in 1621, Strode set out his position on taxation: &#145;I would help the King, and yet look to the country&#146;, which was suffering a severe depression  (Notestein, Relf, and Simpson, 2.90). He admonished his fellow landlords to abate rents during the depression and to forbear from imposing taxes that chiefly hit the poor. He took a strong line against monopolies among other barriers to freedom of trade. Although an investor in the Virginia Company, however, he advocated a total ban on tobacco imports. He was troubled by the increase in petty crime in Devon, and introduced a bill to reduce those offenders unable to pay fines to slavery for eight years, at the end of which he hoped they would have acquired such skills and habits of industry as would enable them to earn an honest living.<br>
<br>Strode had been without a patron at court since Salisbury's death in 1612, but by 1624, when he again represented his county in parliament, he had become a client of the duke of Buckingham. He expressed satisfaction with the duke's rambling account of his conduct in Madrid, &#145;If any man can take exception, reason to take consideration; but now no reason &hellip; to stay it&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 1547&#150;1628, 721). He supported the absurdly inadequate estimates of the cost of war, and was even prepared to defer the presentation of grievances. In 1625 Bishop John Williams described him as &#145;never out of my lord duke's chamber and bosom&#146;  (J. Hacket, <span class="italic">Scrinia reserata</span>, 1695, pt 2, 18), and in 1626 he acted as teller against his patron's impeachment. This was the last parliament in which he sat, and for the election of 1628 he gave his interest at Plympton to another of the duke's clients, Sir James Bagg. Meanwhile, at home in Devon during these years of war Strode, living near Plymouth with the problems of disorder and martial law raised by the presence of mutinous and ill-paid troops, had been active as a magistrate and deputy lieutenant.<br>
<br>Lady Strode was buried on 24 February 1619, leaving a grown-up family of three sons and seven daughters. The eldest son, Sir Richard, married a sister of Sir Walter Erle and later became a Baptist; the second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26675/', "William Strode (bap. 1594, d. 1645)")</script>, achieved prominence as one of Sir John Eliot's allies in the session of 1629 and as one of the five members in 1642. The daughters all married into prominent Devon families, two of them marrying baronets and four of them knights; the eldest daughter, Mary, married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5381/', "Sir George Chudleigh")</script>, a neighbour to the Strodes who shared Sir William's puritanism, and Elizabeth married a son of the diarist Walter Yonge. On 31 March 1624 Strode married his second wife, Dennes, daughter of Stephen Vosper of Liskeard, Cornwall. She died childless, and was buried on 16 September 1635.<br>
<br>Under the personal rule of Charles I, Strode continued to be consulted over local matters. In 1632, now aged seventy, he was unsuccessful in his attempt to resign from the county bench and deputy lieutenancy. In January 1634 his brother justices reported that although his &#145;extreme sickness&#146; had prevented him from attending their meetings, yet he had been &#145;very careful and forward&#146; in implementing the <span class="roman">Book of Orders</span> in his division  (Wolffe, 67). His last public action was a protest against ship money. He died on 27 June 1637 and was buried alongside his two &#145;most loving and religious wives&#146; at St Mary's Church, Plympton, the following day  (will). An epitaph composed by his son William speaks of his religion, integrity, public justice, generous hospitality, and upright and successful management of his affairs.<br>
