<span class="headword">Ferguson,  James</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1705), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the third son of William Ferguson of Badifurrow, Aberdeenshire, who represented Inverurie in the first Scottish parliament after the Restoration, remembered for its demonstrative loyalty as the &#145;drunken parliament&#146;. James's elder brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9325/', "Robert Ferguson (d. 1714)")</script>, &#145;the Plotter&#146;. Nothing is known of Ferguson's early life.<br>
<br>Ferguson appears to have entered one of the three Scottish regiments of the Anglo-Dutch brigade in the service of the Dutch republic, probably as a gentleman volunteer, some time during the reign of Charles II; he is either synonymous with, or closely related to, the James Ferguson recorded as a general clerk to the Dutch council of state in 1663. His first commission, that of quartermaster in Colonel Macdonald's battalion of the brigade, was dated 12 June 1677; he subsequently rose to the rank of ensign in September 1678, and lieutenant in February 1682. His battalion was one of those brought over to England in 1685 at the time of Monmouth's rebellion in which his brother Robert played a prominent role. He obtained a captain's commission in 1687 and in the following year sailed with Charles Gerard, first earl of Macclesfield, &#145;and several gentlemen of quality&#146; who landed with William of Orange at Torbay  (<span class="italic">Dartmouth MSS</span>, 1.180). His regiment, Balfour's (later Lauder's), was one of those first landed, and soon after dispatched from London to Leith under General Hugh Mackay of Scourie. The battle at Killicrankie, where he is said to have been taken prisoner, left Ferguson a regimental major, and in March 1690 he was dispatched by Mackay at the head of 600 men to reduce the Western Isles, a service he accomplished satisfactorily with the aid of the Glasgow authorities and the co-operation of Captain Pottinger of the <i>Dartmouth</i> frigate. Mackay described him as &#145;a resolute, well-affected officer&#146;, in whose discretion and diligence he had full reliance  (Ferguson, <span class="italic">Scots Brigade</span>, 2.15&#150;16).<br>
<br>In 1692 Ferguson was back in the Low Countries and was present with his regiment (now Lauder's) at the battle of Steenkerke. A few days later, on 1 August 1692, he was appointed lieutenant-colonel of Monro's regiment, which at that time was in Dutch pay. Ferguson led the regiment at the battle of Landen and at the siege of Namur. On 25 August 1693 he was appointed to the colonelcy, which he held until his death. Owing to the reductions of the English brigade in Flanders after the treaty of Ryswick in 1697 the regiment was retained in the Netherlands, along with the Scottish regiments of Lord Strathnaver (John Sutherland, formerly Gordon, later sixteenth earl of Sutherland) and James Hamilton. In December 1700 Ferguson's regiment was finally transferred to the British service and was brought to Scotland. Ferguson had meanwhile married Helen, daughter of James Drummond of Cultmalindie, Perthshire, with whom he had a son and daughter but was left a widower. He had also acquired the estates of Balmakelly and Kirtonhill, on the Kincardineshire bank of the North Esk.<br>
<br>Ferguson went with his regiment to the Netherlands under Marlborough in 1702. In 1703 he was in command of the garrison at Bois-le-Duc ('s-Hertogenbosch) with the rank of brigadier-general, but experienced problems with the acceptance of his orders by the English commander of Fort St Andrew. Throughout 1703 he had to fight to keep his garrison complete. One of the garrison's regiments was diverted to the defence of Bergen-op-Zoom in December, which prompted Ferguson to complain of the &#145;unkindness&#146; of his overall commander, John Cutts, first Baron Cutts of Gowran  (<span class="italic">Frankland-Russell-Astley MSS</span>, 147). He was soon satisfied upon receiving private instructions from Cutts not to allow any British troops to depart from his garrison. A regiment from his garrison was, however, ordered to Bergen-op-Zoom in January 1704. In the campaign of 1704 he commanded a brigade which led the attack on the heights of Schellenberg, and at Blenheim shared with Rowe's brigade the protracted fighting round the strongest part of the enemy's position. About Christmas the same year Ferguson married his second wife, Hester Elizabeth, daughter of Abraham Hibelet, pastor of the Walloon church at Bois-le-Duc. In the campaign of 1705 he had a brigade at the forcing of the enemy's lines in Brabant, and afterwards commanded, with the rank of major-general, at Bois-le-Duc, where he died very suddenly&#151;legend has it by poisoning&#151;on 22 October. He was buried in the chancel of St Jan's Kerk, Bois-le-Duc, where a small tablet was set to his memory.<br>
<br>According to one account Ferguson &#145;served in four reigns, still maintaining the character of a brave, valiant, and prudent officer, until his fame raising envy in the breast of the then commanding officer, he was cut off by very sinister means&#146;  (Snyder, 1.46). Contemporary writers are discreetly silent on this ugly story, but all agree in regretting his loss as a brave and experienced officer. At the time of his death he had just returned from The Hague, where Marlborough had promised &#145;to declare him major-general so soon as he got to London, but left him here this winter to command in chief all the British troops as well horse and foot on this side&#146;  (Ferguson, <span class="italic">Scots Brigade</span>, 1.513&#150;14 n. 1). His value to William of Orange, and Marlborough, in Flanders can be gauged by the statement of one of his officers that<blockquote>he was by much the best officer we had in all the British troops. He was brave, knew the service; had great and long experience &hellip; and the Duke was so sensible of this that when he had anything difficult or of importance to do he constantly employed him, even out of his turn. (<span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 4.265)</blockquote>Ferguson's second wife survived him and married Captain Hendrik Chombach. With her Ferguson had a daughter, who in 1730 married M. Gerard Vink, advocate, Bois-le-Duc. Ferguson's son, James, succeeded him and died in 1777, having sold the estates of Balmakelly and Kirtonhill in order to buy those of Kinmundy and Coynach, Aberdeenshire. In 1888 the representative of the family, James Ferguson of Kinmundy FRS, published a short biography of James Ferguson based on family sources and including a portrait, which forms part of his <span class="italic">Two Scottish Soldiers</span> (Aberdeen, 1888).<br>
