<span class="headword">Chisholm,  Hugh</span>  (1866&#150;1924), <span class="occ">journalist and editor of the Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>, was born at 21 Harewood Square, London, on 22 February 1866. His father, Henry Williams Chisholm (1809&#150;1901), became a senior civil servant, chief clerk of the exchequer, and author of <span class="italic">The Great Account of Annual Public Income and Expenditure from 1688 to 1869</span>, published as a <span class="roman">Parliamentary Return</span> in three volumes&#151;a ten-year labour for which he was granted &pound;1200. Hugh Chisholm's mother was Anna Louisa Bell (<i>c</i>.1824&#150;1900), the daughter of a London wine merchant.<br>
<br>Brought up in modest circumstances, Chisholm was educated at Felsted School (1878&#150;85), where he was head boy for three years. He won a scholarship to Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he took a double first in classics (1886 and 1888). He was called to the bar (Middle Temple) in 1892, but for financial reasons had already drifted into politico-literary journalism, becoming assistant editor and later (1897) editor of the deeply Conservative <span class="italic">St James's Gazette</span>. He was a vociferous Disraeli-style imperialist and tariff reformer, and an enemy of Gladstone's policies. &#145;<span class="italic">The St James's Gazette</span> had always seen in Gladstone a national danger. The danger had been none the less real because it was now removed,&#146; he wrote about his journal's controversial stance during the period of national mourning on Gladstone's death in 1898. &#145;Why gloss over the past?&#146;  (Courtney, <span class="italic">Oxford Portrait Gallery</span>, 111).<br>
<br>On 29 July 1893, the fine-featured, debonair, and strong-minded Chisholm, who stood over 6 feet tall, married a musically gifted Irish woman, Eliza Beatrix (1861&#150;1947), daughter of Henry Harrison, a co. Down landowner. In 1900, after seven years of marriage, Eliza gave birth to the first of three sons. The year also saw a dramatic change in Chisholm's professional life, for <span class="italic">The Times</span> had become co-publisher of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>, and Chisholm was made co-editor, with Sir Donald Mackenzie Wallace and President Hadley of Yale University, of the tenth edition, updating the ninth edition by a further ten volumes, to make thirty-five volumes in all. Published in 1902&#150;3, the tenth edition did extremely well commercially, thanks to its crusading patron, the American bookseller, advertiser, and businessman H. E. Hooper, who had purchased all rights to the <span class="roman">EB</span>, as it was generally known, from A. &amp; C. Black in 1897. As a result, in 1903 Hooper asked Chisholm to edit a completely new edition, to be known as <span class="italic">The Times Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>. Chisholm, Conservative imperialist, journalist, and club stalwart (he joined the Athenaeum and eventually became vice-chairman), rose to the occasion and over the next seven years prepared one of the three greatest monuments to Victorian and Edwardian cultural entrepreneurship (James Murray's <span class="italic">New English Dictionary on Historical Principles</span> (later called the <span class="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</span>) and Leslie Stephen's <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> being the other two). His achievement can only be understood in terms of the transatlantic chemistry and partnership between Chisholm and Hooper. Horace E. Hooper was an idealist, with a determination to make the scholarship of a great modern encyclopaedia affordable and accessible to a general readership&#151;&#145;democratising the means of self-education&#146; as Chisholm put it  (Courtney, <span class="italic">Recollected in Tranquillity</span>, 232). Chisholm was seized by the intellectual challenge which this entailed at the start of a new century and brought to bear his formidable contacts in literary, historical, museum, university, and scientific circles.<br>
<br>Chisholm divided the new encyclopaedia into comprehensive treatises within which were shorter articles: 40,000 entries compared to 17,000 in the tenth edition. The 29 new volumes totalled 44 million words, written by 1507 contributors, among whom were 168 fellows of the Royal Society, 53 presidents or secretaries of learned societies, 47 members of the British Museum staff, and 47 staff members of laboratories and observatories. Contributors ranged from Edmund Gosse to Bertrand Russell and Ernest Rutherford.<br>
<br>Though innovative in his approach to imparting knowledge, Chisholm could neither type nor dictate, but wrote all his own letters, by hand. His real work lay in the orchestration of his scheme for a modern encyclopaedia that would be more than the sum of its parts: &#145;on uniform lines&#146;, he declared in his editorial preface, &#145;as a single organism&#146;  (<span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>, 11th edn, 1.ix). In particular, he kept the project going throughout the disastrous period in 1909 when Lord Northcliffe, new owner of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, took affront at &#145;yellow journalism&#146; accusations made in the law courts, and withdrew from his publishing agreement with Hooper. Cambridge University Press, impressed by the proofs of Chisholm's work, gladly took <span class="italic">The Times</span>'s place in 1910.<br>
<br>The eleventh edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> was finally published under CUP's imprimatur in 1911. The edition had no entry under psychoanalysis, did not mention Freud, was poor on Fabian socialism and communism, and used only thirty-five women contributors. Theoretically a feminist (his sister Grace, a brilliant mathematician, was awarded a PhD <i>multa cum laude</i>), Chisholm was in reality uncomfortable with women, a prude, and profoundly na&iuml;ve in matters of sex. &#145;We might have something newer than what Adam did for Eve when he was left alone with her in the Garden of Eden&#146; complained one of his medical sub-editors in a famous quip  (Courtney, <span class="italic">Recollected in Tranquillity</span>, 227). Nevertheless the <span class="roman">EB</span>'s eleventh edition is commonly regarded as the greatest encyclopaedic achievement in the English language of the twentieth century, and the credit was Chisholm's. To this day it remains a primary reference work of the state of knowledge in the English-speaking world on the eve of the First World War.<br>
<br>So great was Chisholm's standing in 1911 that Northcliffe offered him the editorship of <span class="italic">The Times</span>. Northcliffe did not then honour the offer, however, and for two years Chisholm edited the <span class="italic">Britannica Yearbook</span> in Holborn, until returning to Printing House Square and <span class="italic">The Times</span> as leader writer and day editor in 1913. During the First World War he was city (financial) editor and helped raise prodigious sums for government war bonds, but fell out with Northcliffe over labour issues&#151;penning the conservative leader which in 1919 finally brought Geoffrey Dawson's dismissal as editor.<br>
<br>Chisholm had been happiest working with Hooper, for an increasingly American audience, and in 1920 Chisholm severed his <span class="italic">Times</span> connection to edit three further, supplementary volumes of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>, in order to update the eleventh edition. This edition, known as the twelfth edition, covered the First World War in detail. It was published in 1922.<br>
<br>Chisholm was a keen freemason, a devotee of billiards and bridge, a man of independent mind and first-class intellect. He was Hooper's ideal as an editor, an English journalist&#150;scholar with a sincere interest in America, backed by a staff of young university graduates, and with an unrivalled network of famous and distinguished contributors. When Hooper died in 1922, however, the inspiration behind the <span class="roman">EB</span> died also. Chisholm died at 3 Courtfield Gardens, Kensington, London, two years later on 29 September 1924 as the result of a gangrenous appendectomy.<br>
