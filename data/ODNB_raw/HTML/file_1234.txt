<span class="headword">Ballard,  Edward George</span>  (1791&#150;1860), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 29 April 1791 in Salisbury, Wiltshire, the only child of Edward Ballard, an alderman of Salisbury, and Elizabeth, daughter of George Fowles Benson, also of Salisbury; his parents were married on 18 August 1788. Because of early ill health his education was much neglected, though he was schooled a little in Salisbury, and in Pimlico when his parents moved to London. He obtained employment in the Stamp Office in 1809 and, upon resigning this appointment, entered the Excise Office, which he also left of his own accord in 1817 to apply himself vigorously to study. In 1817 he became a contributor to Wooller's <span class="italic">Reasoner</span>. In 1818 he married Mary Ann Shadgett, and wrote several criticisms and verses for the <span class="italic">Weekly Review</span>, then edited by his brother-in-law, William Shadgett. He also received a reader's ticket for the British Library in 1818, which he frequented. In 1820 his wife died, leaving him a widower with a son and a daughter. He contributed to the <span class="italic">Literary Chronicle</span> and the <span class="italic">Imperial Magazine</span> under the signature E. G. B., and to the <span class="italic">Literary Magnet</span> and the <span class="italic">World of Fashion</span> under the sign of &#915;. In 1825 he published a volume entitled <span class="italic">A New Series of Original Poems</span>, and in 1829 another entitled <span class="italic">Microscopic Amusements</span>. He was exceedingly fond of research. Robert Benson, his cousin, and Henry Hatcher received considerable help from him in writing their <span class="italic">History of Salisbury</span> (1843), which formed part of Richard Colt Hoare's <span class="italic">Wiltshire</span>. He helped John Gough Nichols in the works undertaken for the Camden Society. For many years he was a member of the Russell Institute and later the Islington Literary and Scientific Association. In 1848 he brought out some parts of a continuation of John Strype's <span class="italic">Ecclesiastical Memorials</span> in a publication called <span class="italic">The Surplice</span>, but this paper and Ballard's scheme soon came to an end. He also occasionally contributed to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> and <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span>. Ballard died at Compton Terrace, Islington, London, on 14 February 1860. He was survived by his son, Edward Ballard MD, author of several medical works, and a daughter. He was buried in Brookwood cemetery, Woking, Surrey, on 18 February 1860.<br>
