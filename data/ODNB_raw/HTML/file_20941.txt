<span class="headword">Ottley,  William Young</span>  (1771&#150;1836), <span class="occ">writer on art and collector</span>, was born near Thatcham, Berkshire, on 6 August 1771, the son of a plantation owner, Richard Ottley. He was educated at a school near Richmond, Yorkshire, where he was a pupil of George Cuitt the elder before going on to Winchester College. He entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1787, studying briefly under John Brown (1749&#150;1787), whose studio contents he purchased the same year. Brown's estate included 219 drawings, which formed the basis of Ottley's collection of old master drawings, prints, and paintings. Ottley added to his collection during a ten-year period of study and travel in Italy (1791&#150;9), taking advantage, after the French invasion of 1796, of the desire of many prominent collectors to sell their family treasures before they were looted. He acquired pictures from the Aldobrandini, Colonna, Borghese, and Corsini families, for example Botticelli's <span class="italic">Mystic Nativity</span> (1500?) and Raphael's <span class="italic">Dream of Scipio</span> (<i>c</i>.1504; &#145;Vision of a Knight&#146;) both now in the National Gallery, London. The bulk of his collection of Italian old master drawings was sold in 1823 to Sir Thomas Lawrence for &pound;8000. Among the highlights, which formed the core of Lawrence's magnificent drawings collection, were splendid groups of drawings by Michelangelo and Raphael assembled by and later stolen from the French painter Jean-Baptiste Wicar (1762&#150;1834), superintendent of official French depredations. Ottley bought the stolen drawings from the Florentine painter Antonio Fedi (to whom they had been given by the thieves, a father and son Pampaloni), but the precise timing of their acquisition and Ottley's possible role in the theft remain open to suspicion  (Scheller). Although Lawrence's collection was later largely dispersed (a cause of national regret), most of the drawings by Michelangelo and Raphael were acquired by national subscription for the University of Oxford and are now in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford.<br>
<br>On his return to London in 1799 Ottley established himself as a writer, connoisseur, and <i>marchand-amateur</i>. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and, as a leading arbiter of taste, he advised others on the purchase of works of art. He married some time before 1802. His well-known art publications began with <span class="italic">The Italian School of Design</span> (1808), a series of facsimile prints engraved (often by himself) after drawings in his own collection. The second and third parts of this ambitious project&#151;intended to provide &#145;a chronological sequence of the designs of the most eminent artists of Italy&#146;  (unpaginated &#145;Advertisement&#146; to <span class="italic">The Italian School of Design</span>)&#151;were published in 1813 and 1823 (when the whole work was issued in one volume). In 1816 he published <span class="italic">An Inquiry into the Origin and Early History of Engraving on Copper and Wood</span> (2 vols.), the companion to which, <span class="italic">An Inquiry into the Invention of Printing</span>, was published posthumously in 1863. In 1826&#150;8 he published two volumes of facsimile engravings after rare incunabula and early prints. His projected monumental dictionary of engravers, the <span class="italic">Notices of Engravers and their Works</span>, was abandoned after the publication in 1831 of the first volume (covering <span class="roman">A&#150;Baldung</span>). Among the collectors he advised was Granville Leveson-Gower, first marquess of Stafford, most of whose picture gallery he had recorded in four folio volumes of engravings (1818). Two other works devoted mainly to paintings appeared in 1826: <span class="italic">A Descriptive Catalogue of the Pictures in the National Gallery</span>, commissioned by Lawrence, and <span class="italic">A series of plates engraved after the paintings and sculptures of the most eminent masters of the early Florentine school</span>, which prompted a reassessment of thirteenth- to fifteenth-century Italian painting.<br>
<br>In 1833 Ottley became keeper of prints and drawings at the British Museum, a post that he accepted apparently for financial reasons, since the act abolishing slavery had reduced his income from the family's West Indies plantation. Although one of the best connoisseurs of his day, he was already in poor health and died in London on 26 May 1836 without having made much of a mark on the collection. He began a new catalogue, but his time at the museum was clouded by rows with the director and trustees about his working conditions. His own remarkable art collection was the subject of a number of private sales and public auctions in London, for which he did much of the research for the catalogues when alive.<br>
