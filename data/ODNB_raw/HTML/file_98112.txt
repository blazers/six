<span class="headword">Dobell, Sir  Charles MacPherson</span>  (1869&#150;1954), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born in Quebec City, Canada, on 22 June 1869, the second of three sons (he also had two sisters) of Richard Reid Dobell (1837&#150;1902) of Beauvoir Manor, Sillery, Quebec City, and his wife, Elizabeth Frances MacPherson. His father, born in Liverpool, had emigrated in 1857 to Canada, where he established a prosperous lumber business, moved into Canadian politics, and was elected as a Liberal member in the Canadian House of Commons.<br>
<br>Charles Dobell was brought up in luxurious surroundings at Beauvoir, attending Canon Iffland's private school and Quebec high school before leaving for England, where he went to Charterhouse School. He then returned to Canada as an officer cadet at the Royal Military College, Kingston, Ontario, graduating in 1890, after which he was gazetted into the Royal Welch Fusiliers. On 3 March 1908, in London, he married Elizabeth Annie Holme (Elsye), widow of Captain Frederick L. Campbell RN and daughter of Major William Meyrick Bankes; they had a daughter.<br>
<br>Dobell served his military apprenticeship in Britain's colonial wars, serving as a lieutenant in the Hazara expedition in 1891 (medal with clasp); in Crete in 1897&#150;8 (brevet major); in South Africa from 1899 to 1900, where he commanded a battalion of the Royal Welch Fusiliers on mounted operations (DSO, dispatches, and queen's medal with clasps); in China during the Boxer rebellion in 1900 (medal); and in the northern Nigeria expedition of 1906 (dispatches twice, brevet lieutenant-colonel, medal and clasp).<br>
<br>Special nomination to and graduation from the Staff College in 1904 augmented Dobell's campaigning experience and, after the Nigeria expedition, he went to the War Office as GSO (grade 3) and then GSO (grade 2) in the military operations directorate. Having been appointed aide-de-camp to the king in 1910, he left the War Office in 1911 to command the Bedfordshire regiment in May 1912 with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, before becoming full colonel the following year. With this promotion he was appointed in 1913 inspector-general of the West African Frontier Force.<br>
<br>When war broke out in August 1914 Dobell, by now a brigadier-general, was responsible for conquering the German colonies of Togoland and Cameroon. At home on leave at the start of the war he told the subcommittee of the committee of imperial defence that Lome (the capital) and Kamina (the base of the main wireless station) in Togoland were the only worthwhile objectives. Dobell felt that Lome, a mile over the border from the British Gold Coast, should be the initial objective&#151;and even this would require naval support. Events on the ground outpaced Dobell's cautious approach to operations, with the British Gold Coast regiment mobilizing ahead of schedule, and local British commanders taking matters into their own hands, pushing into Togoland and forcing its surrender by the end of August.<br>
<br>On 25 September 1914 Dobell, back in Africa, arrived off Cameroon in charge of an Anglo-French force of some 13,000, largely locally recruited, soldiers, the majority of whom were French. The port city, Duala, fell without a shot fired on 27 September, German forces retreating inland. Meanwhile other British and French-led troops advanced across the borders from Nigeria and French Equatorial Africa. This was not a war of large battles, and the major enemies were disease, poor communications, and rough terrain. Short of men, in March 1915 Dobell reported that he had only two battalions fit for service, so London signalled him to sit on the defensive. Although in overall command, he had great difficulty controlling his disparate force, divided as it was between France and Britain (and Belgium), four governor-generals, six independent commanders-in-chief, and eight column commanders. The war dragged on into 1916, ending only when the last German forces retreated after a protracted and difficult campaign to neutral Spanish-run Muni. In recognition of his services in Africa in 1914&#150;16 he was made CMG (1915) and KCB (1916) and promoted major-general.<br>
<br>In June 1916 Dobell was sent to serve under General Sir Archibald Murray, in charge of Britain's advance from Egypt across the Sinai into Ottoman-held Palestine. Murray put Dobell in charge of the Egyptian expeditionary force's eastern force, which he commanded as a lieutenant-general in 1916&#150;17, being twice mentioned in dispatches. Dobell's mission was to extend the British lines across to the border of Palestine by the town of Gaza. This was at first a war of logistics, the gradual British advance dependent on a railway and water pipeline built by Egyptian forced labour along the Mediterranean coast of the Sinai. By early 1917 his men were ready to attack into Palestine. While the campaign historian described him as &#145;sanguine and energetic&#146;, and &#145;always anxious to engage his enemy&#146;  (Wavell, <span class="italic">Palestine Campaigns</span>, 71), his first major battle, at Gaza in March&#150;April 1917, resulted in two comprehensive defeats, in which both he and Murray, and the command structure that they created, failed. In a classic piece of official understatement the British official history of the war commented on the first battle: &#145;Few actions of the late war have been the subject of greater differences of opinion than the first battle of Gaza&#146;  (MacMunn and Falls, 1.315). At the first battle in March 1917 British and imperial mounted troops surrounded Gaza town&#151;weakly held at this time by the Ottomans&#151;but were then pulled out in a panic because of a communications and command breakdown that cannot be blamed on such extraneous factors as the presence of fog. If the first battle was a wasted muddle, the second battle in April 1917 was senseless slaughter as the British infantry with inadequate artillery support attacked Ottoman positions head on and were shot to pieces. It is not clear whether all of this was Dobell's or Murray's fault&#151;the latter was in supreme command&#151;but after the second battle of Gaza Murray replaced Dobell with Sir Philip Chetwode as commander of eastern force. Shortly thereafter, in June 1917, the war cabinet in London sent out Sir Edmund Allenby to replace Murray.<br>
<br>In August 1917 Dobell went to India to command the 2nd (Rawalpindi) division, staying until 1920, during which time he served in the Third Anglo-Afghan War of 1919 (dispatches twice, medal). He was commander-in-chief of the northern army India in 1920, retiring with the honorary rank of lieutenant-general in 1923.<br>
<br>In 1926 Dobell became colonel of his old regiment, the Royal Welch Fusiliers, an honorary position that he held until 1938. He became a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in 1947. He died at his home, 18 Kingston House, Prince's Gate, London, on 17 October 1954. A career marked by successes and honours, and characterized by his &#145;indomitable courage&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 28 Oct 1954), was marred by defeat in the Gaza battles. While he was not alone in struggling with the challenges thrown up by modern warfare after 1914, the reverses at Gaza in the spring of 1917 were, arguably, avoidable and undoubtedly prolonged the Palestine campaign.<br>
