<span class="headword">Conington,  John</span>  (1825&#150;1869), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born at Boston, Lincolnshire, on 10 August 1825, the eldest son of the Revd Richard Conington and his wife, Jane, daughter of F. Thirkhill. In 1836 he was sent to Beverley grammar school and two years later to Rugby School, where his housemaster was G. E. L. Cotton and the headmaster was Thomas Arnold.<br>
<br>Conington was a precocious child, who was able to recite 1000 lines of Virgil to his father before the age of eight, and his near-sightedness and preference for the company of adults made him unhappy in what his biographer describes as the &#145;primaeval roughness&#146; of Rugby. In his later years there he won the praise of Arnold and was, for a time, head of his house.<br>
<br>On 30 June 1843 Conington matriculated at University College, Oxford, but almost immediately obtained a demyship at Magdalen. He went up in October 1843 and became the pupil of the Revd William Linwood of Christ Church. In the Hilary term of 1844 he won the two most prestigious undergraduate classical prizes: the Hertford and the Ireland scholarships. His main interests lay in ancient literature and language, but although he did not find the study of ancient history or philosophy particularly stimulating he nevertheless obtained a first class in <i>literae humaniores</i> in December 1846. He had by then returned to University College (with a scholarship in March 1846), having decided against taking holy orders and realizing that he would be unlikely to obtain a lay fellowship at Magdalen. He won the Chancellor's prizes for Latin verse (1847), for an English essay (1848), and for a Latin essay (1849). In February 1848 he was elected to a fellowship at University College, and in the same year, at the age of only twenty-three, produced an edition of Aeschylus's <span class="italic">Agamemnon</span> which gained Fraenkel's approbation a century later for its &#145;fine interpretations and &hellip; instinctive grasp of certain delicate shades of poetry which is characteristic of [his] later work&#146;  (Fraenkel, 1.51). His much praised conjecture in line 717 does not appear in this edition, but in <span class="italic">Terminalia</span> (1851).<br>
<br>Since virtually all academic preferment in Oxford was still restricted to those in holy orders, Conington decided to read for the bar. He had been prominent in the union as an undergraduate, becoming secretary in 1845, president in 1846, and librarian in 1847. He obtained the Eldon law scholarship in 1849, but, disliking London and the study of law, he returned to Oxford after six months. In the union some had seen him as a political radical and his biographer describes him as showing &#145;a warm sympathy with the spirit of free enquiry in theology&#146;  (Smith, xxxiii). Not everyone agreed about his radicalism. &#145;Conington&#146;, someone is reported to have exclaimed, &#145;write about the working classes! They are only a large generalisation from his scout&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Conington was interested in the continental revolutions of 1848, and became prominent in the movement for university reform which resulted in a royal commission and the act of 1854. He was a member of a liberal group which included Goldwin Smith (his original collaborator in editing Virgil whose appointment as secretary to the commission caused him to abandon the project), H. J. S. Smith, A. P. Stanley, Benjamin Jowett, and H. H. Vaughan. In 1849&#150;50 he wrote a series of articles on university reform for the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, and produced several pamphlets at Oxford. He advocated many of the changes which were brought about by the act of 1854, especially the opening of fellowships to competition, the restriction of the number of fellowships limited to clergymen, and the establishment of professorships.<br>
<br>Conington was himself the first holder of the Corpus professorship of Latin, to which he was elected in 1854. (He had been an unsuccessful candidate for the chair of Greek at Edinburgh in 1852.) In the long vacation of 1854 he appears to have suffered some sort of spiritual crisis in which, according to his biographer, H. J. S. Smith, &#145;for some weeks he was agitated and unstrung by [an] overwhelming consciousness of the immediate presence of the terrors of the unseen world&#146;. The result was &#145;the fixed determination to make the obligations of religion &hellip; the sole governing principle of his life&#146;  (Smith, xxxiii).<br>
<br>Mark Pattison, in a famously acid passage in his <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, writes of Conington's being &#145;&#147;converted&#148; &hellip; by the terrors of hell. He attended chapel assiduously, refused to read anything but religious books on Sunday &hellip; or to dine out on that day &hellip; he began to broach Conservative sentiments, as well in politics as in University affairs, and very soon ranged himself with the followers of Dr Pusey&#146;  (Pattison, 249). Pattison's venom may have infected some other accounts; this change of political and theological stance is mentioned but not given such prominence in the writings of Conington's friends such as his pupil and successor but one in the Corpus chair, Henry Nettleship, and H. J. S. Smith.<br>
<br>Conington was perhaps a somewhat surprising choice as first holder of the Corpus chair. At the time of his election he had not published any edition of a Latin work, and a contemporary noted with surprise his limited grasp of German. He showed little interest in the recent advances made in classical scholarship on the continent or in the developing study of ancient history, and his understanding of the importance of earlier English classical scholars (such as Richard Bentley) was limited. Apart from a handful of reviews and essays and the important editions of Virgil and Persius, his chief publications were translations, readings from which often formed the basis of his public lectures. Within Latin literature his interest was limited to a very few authors, and he showed little interest in the history or practice of textual criticism, as is shown by his excessively conservative attitude to the text of Virgil.<br>
<br>Conington's translations have not stood the test of time, and include some strange choices of medium: he turned the <span class="italic">Aeneid</span> into ballad form (1866), a continuation of P. S. Worsley's Homer into Spenserian stanzas (1868), and Horace's <span class="italic">Satires</span> and <span class="italic">Epistles</span> into heroic couplets (1869). Nevertheless, Conington's critics were unfair in judging his production of translations as mere laziness: a genuine interest in attending to &#145;each word, not merely to the general force of an expression, but to the various constituents which make up the effect produced by it on a thoroughly intelligent reader&#146;  (<span class="italic">Miscellaneous Writings</span>, 1.220) is the most important characteristic which informs his translations, essays, reviews, and editions.<br>
<br>Conington is best remembered for the commentary on Virgil which he began in 1852 and continued to revise throughout his life. The last of its three volumes was partly written by Nettleship, who later revised the first two volumes and added useful essays. Other revisions were undertaken by F. Haverfield. It is the fullest commentary on the whole of Virgil in English, and remains very valuable (especially on the <span class="italic">Aeneid</span>) for its clear explanatory notes and citations of parallel passages. Conington's edition of Aeschylus's <span class="italic">Choephoroe</span> (1857) drew warm praise from Fraenkel (52) for the &#145;quiet and noble language&#146; of its notes; more important was his edition and translation of Persius, which was completed by Nettleship and published in 1872. This contains detailed notes on the subject matter and remained the standard English work on the poet for over a century.<br>
<br>Despite his cadaverous appearance&#151;he was known as the &#145;sick vulture&#146;, and Tuckwell (104) recalls his &#145;extraordinary visage with its green-cheese hue, gleaming spectacles [and] quivering, protrusive lips&#146;&#151;Conington was a noted conversationalist, an assiduous letter-writer, and an important influence on the small groups of undergraduates whom he cultivated, who included T. H. Green, Nettleship, and J. A. Symonds. Although he had no interest in scenery, he took a daily walk during term (giving favoured undergraduates a regular day on which to accompany him) and led a reading party each summer. Many of his former pupils expressed deep gratitude for his friendship, but Nettleship noted &#145;his intense craving for human sympathy as an impulse which materially injured his mental development, and diverted his powers from objects more worthy of them&#146;  (Nettleship, 1.xxii). In later life he spent the vacations looking after his aged mother in Boston, his father having died in 1861, and his brothers in 1863 and 1868. Conington died at Boston, Lincolnshire, on 23 October 1869 after a short illness caused by a malignant pustule on the lip, and was buried three days later at Fishtoft, Lincolnshire. The Conington prize for a classical dissertation was founded in his memory in 1871.<br>
