<span class="headword">Juggins <span class="st"> [Jugins]</span>,  Richard</span>  (1843&#150;1895), <span class="occ">trade unionist</span>, was born on 16 July 1843 at New Street, Darlaston, Staffordshire, the son of a miner, Samuel Jugins, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Emery. His father was killed in an accident at work when Richard was only eleven. His only education was at Sunday school and night school. He started work as a nut and bolt maker at the age of seven and followed this occupation for the next twenty years. In November 1870 he played a leading part in forming the Nut and Bolt Makers' Association and was elected its part-time secretary. Fourteen months later, in January 1872, he was dismissed from his job for organizing a strike and became full-time secretary of the union. Under his leadership the union grew steadily and expanded far beyond its Black Country heartland. By 1877 it had 2000 members in 31 branches as far apart as Glasgow, Cwmbr&acirc;n, and Wolverton.<br>
<br>The other Black Country metal-using trades remained largely unorganized: constant downward pressure on employment volumes and wage levels generated by intense competition in product markets meant that most attempts at association were foredoomed to failure. In a bid to bolster such unions as existed and to foster new ones Juggins formed the Midland Counties Trades Federation in May 1886. He was appointed its secretary and combined this position with that of union secretary. Initially, only his own association and two others joined the federation, but by the time of its fourth annual meeting 66 unions with 10,000 members were affiliated. This success was due very largely to Juggins's dedicated work and in 1889 the executive council of the federation voted him a salary of &pound;52 per annum. In the following year the members presented him with a purse of 100 gold sovereigns, a clock, and an illuminated address in appreciation of his efforts.<br>
<br>The spread of organization, and hence discipline, among workers encouraged Juggins to initiate discussions with employers about establishing conciliation machinery in some industries: hitherto even minor disputes had often led to strikes or lock-outs, sometimes accompanied by violence. His first success came, appropriately, in the nut and bolt industry. In February 1889 the employers agreed to participate with the union in the south Staffordshire nut and bolt wages board. This set the pattern for other industries and within a few years there was a sprinkling of such boards across the Black Country.<br>
<br>In March 1889 Juggins gave evidence to the select committee of the House of Lords on the sweating system and three years later he was called before the royal commission on labour. He also represented the Nut and Bolt Makers' Association and the Midland Counties Trades Federation at the annual conference of the Trades Union Congress many times and attended some meetings of the International Labour Congress.<br>
<br>Juggins was among those trade union leaders who believed that industrial organization should be supported by direct labour representation in parliament and from 1886 he was a member of the TUC's labour electoral committee for the Birmingham area. In 1891 the executive council of the Midland Federation resolved that Juggins himself &#145;be recommended to the electors of Dudley as the labour candidate&#146; at the next general election  (<span class="italic">Dudley Herald</span>, 30 May 1891), but this came to nothing. There was opposition from within the federation and from Dudley Liberal Association so the proposal was dropped.<br>
<br>Juggins did, however, make an important contribution to public life in his local community. He served on the Walsall board of guardians, the Darlaston urban district council and the Darlaston school board, as well as being a member of the local court of the Ancient Order of Foresters and a Methodist lay preacher.<br>
<br>Juggins died at his home, 60 New Street, Darlaston, on 5 March 1895 and was buried at James Bridge cemetery, Darlaston, on 11 March 1895. He was married twice. His second wife survived him, together with five sons and two daughters, apparently from both marriages. In November 1896 a marble headstone was erected over his grave, paid for by contributions from members of the Nut and Bolt Makers' Association and the Midland Counties Trades Federation.<br>
