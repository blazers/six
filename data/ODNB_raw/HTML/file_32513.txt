<span class="headword">Colvile, Sir  Henry Edward</span>  (1852&#150;1907), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born at Kirkby Mallory, Leicestershire, on 10 July 1852, was the only son of Colonel Charles Robert Colvile (1815&#150;1886) of Lullington Hall, near Burton upon Trent, Liberal-Conservative (later Liberal) MP for South Derbyshire 1841&#150;9 and 1865&#150;8, and his wife, the Hon. Katharine Sarah Georgina, eldest daughter of Captain John Russell RN, and Sophia, Baroness de Clifford. His mother's father was grandson of John Russell, fourth duke of Bedford. Educated at Eton College, he entered the army as lieutenant in the Grenadier Guards on 1 October 1870, and was promoted captain on 15 March 1872. From 1876 to 1880 he was regimental instructor of musketry, and from 1880 to 1883 aide-de-camp to the Hon. Leicester Smyth, the general commanding at the Cape of Good Hope.<br>
<br>In 1884 Colvile served in the intelligence department in the Sudan. He was at the battles of al-Teb and Tamai, and was mentioned in dispatches. Later in 1884 he served on the Gordon relief expedition, with the intelligence department, and was at the action of Abu Klea in January 1885. He was made CB on 25 August 1885. From 1885 to 1888 he was on the staff in Egypt, partly with the frontier field force, and was at the battle of Giniss on 30 December 1885.<br>
<br>Repeatedly mentioned in dispatches, Colvile achieved a reputation as one of the army's best intelligence officers, and was promoted lieutenant-colonel in November 1882 and colonel in January 1886. In 1892 he drew up plans for a military expedition to Abeokuta, capital of Egba, west Africa, whose authorities had been interrupting important trade routes to Lagos; war was averted by the signing of a trade treaty. In 1893 he was sent to the Uganda protectorate as acting commissioner, and in 1894 he commanded the successful expedition against Kabarega, king of Bunyoro. He was awarded the brilliant star of Zanzibar, second class, and was made CMG in January 1895. Forced to retire from Uganda by ill health, he came home; in July 1895 he was promoted to KCMG, and in March 1898 he became major-general.<br>
<br>After briefly commanding a brigade at Gibraltar, Colvile in 1899 commanded the guards brigade in the South African War. He was with Methuen's force attempting to relieve Kimberley (besieged since 15 October 1899), and took part in the successful actions at Belmont (23 November) and Modder River (28 November), and the defeat of Magersfontein (10&#150;11 December). When the South African field force was reorganized under Lord Roberts (in 1900) Colvile commanded the new 9th division, and marched with the main army to attack General Cronje's force. Colvile's and General Kelly-Kenny's division hemmed in Cronje at Paardeberg after desperate fighting (18 February). Colvile took part with Roberts in the occupation of Bloemfontein (13 March), after engagements at Poplar Grove (7 March) and Driefontein (10 March).<br>
<br>While at Bloemfontein Colvile became entangled in events which ruined his military career. He failed in his attempt to relieve General Broadwood's column after it had been ambushed by General C. R. De Wet at Sannah's Post (30&#150;31 March 1900), and his failure was unfairly assigned by Roberts to a reprehensible lack of vigour. Roberts had been slow in ordering Colvile to try to rescue Broadwood. A further disaster befell Colvile later. Roberts, on his advance from Bloemfontein to Pretoria in May, left Colvile, still nominally in command of the division, on the line of communication, with orders to press on to Heilbron. At the end of May, Colonel Spragge, in command of 500 men of the 13th battalion imperial yeomanry, which had been directed to join Colvile's division, allowed his force to be surrounded outside Lindley by General P. D. De Wet's force, which was not much larger. Appeals for help reached Colvile, who disregarded them, and arrived at Heilbron, after severe fighting, according to his orders, on 29 May. Spragge's force was captured by the Boers, with heavy casualties, on 31 May. Colvile's position was difficult: he had been led to believe that his presence at Heilbron by a certain date was essential to Robert's plans, but he had also received an appeal for help from a part of the force assigned to him.<br>
<br>After the Lindley disaster the 9th division was broken up; Colvile was sent home and reverted to the command of a brigade at Gibraltar. But when Roberts became commander-in-chief in November 1900 he insisted that Colvile be recalled. Colvile returned to England, and on landing at Dover on 31 December stated his case to a Reuter's reporter. On 19 January 1901 he was placed on retired pay as a lieutenant-general. He stated his defence and complained of his treatment by Roberts in <span class="italic">The Work of the Ninth Division</span> (1901). Colvile published several other books on his experiences as a soldier and traveller, and, for the War Office, <span class="italic">The History of the Soudan Campaign</span> (1889).<br>
<br>Colvile's first marriage was on 6 August 1878, to Alice Rose (<i>d</i>. 1882), eldest daughter of Robert Daly and granddaughter of John Daly, second Baron Dunsandle; they had one daughter, who died in 1882. In 1886 he married Z&eacute;lie Isabelle, daughter of Pierre Richaud de Pr&eacute;ville of Ch&acirc;teau des Mondrans, Basses Pyr&eacute;n&eacute;es, France. They had one son, and Z&eacute;lie survived her husband.<br>
<br>Colvile settled at Bagshot. On 24 November 1907, while riding a motorcycle, he collided at Frimley with a car driven by Colonel Sir H. Rawlinson, and died almost immediately of his injuries at Brompton Sanatorium. He was buried at Lullington, near Burton upon Trent, where his ancestral estates lay.<br>
