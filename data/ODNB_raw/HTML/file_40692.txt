<span class="headword">Fairlie,  Henry Jones</span>  (1924&#150;1990), <span class="occ">political journalist and author</span>, was born on 13 January 1924 in Crouch End, London, the second son and fifth child in the family of three sons and four daughters of James Fairlie, journalist, and his wife, Marguerita Vernon. He was educated at Highgate School and Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he read modern history, obtaining second-class honours in 1945, and becoming secretary of the union in the Trinity term of 1945. A weak heart disqualified him from any form of military service, both during the Second World War and after it, but an interest in liberal politics led to his being appointed a lobby correspondent for the <span class="italic">Manchester Evening News</span> at the remarkably early age of twenty-one. He progressed from there to <span class="italic">The Observer</span> in 1948, and then in 1950 to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, where he wrote political leaders.<br>
<br>Anonymity, however, did not suit Fairlie, and in 1954 he accepted an invitation to join the staff of <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>. Building there on the foundations laid by his former colleague, Hugh Massingham of <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, he perfected the journalistic art form of the modern political column. Irreverent, witty, and seldom anything but well informed, Fairlie's weekly columns (appearing first under the pseudonym of Trimmer and later under his own byline) became required reading for politicians of all parties. This achievement was all the more notable as the time he spent at <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> was relatively short, barely two years in duration. But it was during this period that Fairlie made perhaps his most lasting contribution to the vocabulary of British politics, putting into circulation the term &#145;the establishment&#146; to describe those who, while often unelected, controlled the power points of British public life.<br>
<br>In some ways, it was an uncharacteristic notion for Fairlie to have propagated&#151;the phrase had, in fact, first been given its modern usage by A. J. P. Taylor&#151;since by the mid-1950s his own political stance had become that of a romantic, if radical, tory. It was this which gave him his curious affinity with Harold Macmillan, to whom, especially after he started writing for the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, he enjoyed regular access. Fairlie, however, was often wayward in his political judgements, and it was typical of this flaw in his journalistic make-up that he should have predicted in the <span class="italic">Mail</span> that Labour under Hugh Gaitskell would defeat Macmillan in the 1959 general election. The <span class="italic">Mail</span>, after the tories had won a majority of 100, soon dispensed with his services. Thereafter he found an impecunious refuge in the columns of <span class="italic">Time and Tide</span>, where (as in <span class="italic">Encounter</span>) some of his more penetrating longer articles appeared in the early 1960s. He also enjoyed a brief Indian summer in another mass-circulation paper, the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, with some notable news scoops in the turbulent political year of 1963. Well before this, however, his personal difficulties had tended to overshadow his professional success, as marked in television and radio as it had originally been in the press. Always hospitable and, when in funds, generous to a fault, Fairlie exercised only the loosest control over the management of his own life. Pursued by debt, hounded by libel writs, and regularly the subject of bankruptcy proceedings (leading on one occasion to his imprisonment in Brixton), he eventually left Britain for the United States in 1965, never to return to his native land.<br>
<br>In America, Fairlie built up a fresh, if equally controversial, journalistic reputation. Moving now steadily to the left, he early on attacked the power of money in American politics, as symbolized by the Kennedys. His assault on the funding of the Kennedy Library in Boston&#151;originally published in the <span class="italic">Sunday Telegraph</span>&#151;briefly became a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i> in American newspapers, making him for a time something of a pariah in a Kennedy-nostalgic Washington. But even when denied his customary access to the power structure, Fairlie could feel that his own fame was secure. His first, and best, book, <span class="italic">The Life of Politics</span> (published in 1968 but largely written before he left Britain), drew on all his experience of Westminster and remains one of the most vivid defences of the parliamentary system. His subsequent two books&#151;<span class="italic">The Kennedy Promise</span> (1973) and <span class="italic">The Spoiled Child of the Western World</span> (1976)&#151;concentrated on critical American themes but were respectfully received on both sides of the Atlantic.<br>
<br>Boyish in looks and capable, when sober, of being captivating in conversation, Fairlie exerted a powerful charm, particularly upon women. He was married in 1949 to Lisette Todd, daughter of Arthur Todd Phillips, architect. They had a son and two daughters. Fairlie's bohemian streak never allowed him to accept the normal constraints of matrimony (although never divorced, he and his wife separated in 1967). The tales of his various <i>affaires</i> were legendary but were usually related, even by his romantic victims, with affection mingled with exasperated amusement.<br>
<br>Fairlie's last years were spent working for the <span class="italic">New Republic</span> in Washington, in whose offices he was eventually afforded the unusual facility of a bedroom in which to sleep. It was a striking testimony of the regard in which he was held by all those who shared his consuming interest in &#145;the life of politics&#146;. He died in a Washington hospital on 25 February 1990, of heart failure.<br>
