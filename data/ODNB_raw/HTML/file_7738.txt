<span class="headword">Dodd,  James William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1740&#150;1796), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born in London, reportedly the son of a hairdresser. A successful appearance in a school play turned him towards the theatre, and at the age of sixteen he became a strolling player. His first part was said to be Roderigo in <span class="italic">Othello</span>, at Sheffield. There is firm evidence of his being a member of the Norwich Company of Comedians early in 1759, when he was already married and living in Bury St Edmunds, one of the towns on the company's circuit. He and his wife, Martha (<i>d</i>. 1769), also in the company, had four children before 1765.<br>
<br>In Norfolk, Dodd played a wide range of parts, from George Barnwell to Hamlet, and was also a singer and dancer. Tate Wilkinson, who appeared there in 1763, described him as &#145;the reigning favourite&#146; of Norwich  (Wilkinson, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 3.114). But it was in comedy that he came to excel. He began to specialize when in 1764 he and his wife moved to the Bath theatre and came under the influence of John Arthur. A year later Garrick recruited them both for Drury Lane.<br>
<br>Garrick needed an urgent replacement for William O'Brien, whose secret marriage to Lady Susan Strangways had forced him to quit the stage, but with his usual caution he first sought opinions from various talent scouts. The letter from his friend John Hoadly is a model of what such a report should be  (Thomas, 255). In spite of his distaste for &#145;Strolers&#146;, Garrick engaged them. Dodd was to remain at Drury Lane for over thirty years. His forte was the fop, in the tradition created by Cibber and Vanbrugh; he was &#145;the prince of pink heels, and the soul of empty eminence&#146;  (Jenkins, 81) and he chiefly excelled in those roles where the fop is sinister as well as comic.<blockquote>
<div>The insect tribe Dodd paints with nicest art<br>
</div>
<div>And gives a double edge to satire's dart.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">The Drama: a Poem</span>, 1775)</blockquote>After Sheridan had succeeded Garrick at Drury Lane, Dodd created a number of important roles for him: Sir Benjamin Backbite in <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span> (1777), Lord Foppingham in <span class="italic">A Trip to Scarborough</span> (1777), and Dangle in <span class="italic">The Critic</span> (1778). He also played many other types of part in his long and successful career. In the 1780s he was regularly the Drury Lane Caliban; he played Richard III, once; and he was one of a notable trio of witches in <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>. Charles Lamb praised his Sir Andrew Aguecheek especially: &#145;Dodd was <i>it</i>, as it came out of nature's hands &hellip; In expressing slowness of apprehension the actor surpassed all others&#146;  (Lamb, 159).<br>
<br>In the long summer closures of the patent theatres, London actors worked in the provinces and occasionally undertook provincial managements. In his second year at Drury Lane, Dodd helped to open the new theatre in Bristol. He appeared there again in 1767, with his wife, and in 1768, without her. In 1769 he lost the favour of Bristol audiences through his notorious association with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39764/', "Mary Bulkley (1747/8?&#150;1792)")</script>, of Covent Garden, who was also spending the summer in Bristol. His marriage had long been stormy, and in that year Martha, after a quarrel, took an engagement at Richmond rather than in Bristol. Dodd's angry attempts to retrieve her cost him two nights in gaol. Martha died in September of that year, and Dodd found it wiser to stay away from Bristol for a year or two.<br>
<br>In summer 1772 Dodd returned to Bristol as manager, succeeding Tom King. While recruiting his company in London he tried to seduce the young Elizabeth Simpson (later Inchbald), who was seeking a first engagement, but she threw hot water over him and escaped. The season itself went badly. Dodd changed the playbills too late and too often, while the local actresses complained of his public rudeness and resented the best parts' going to Londoners. He never tried management again.<br>
<br>In summer 1774 Dodd went on tour with Mary Bulkley to York (where a quarrel with John Moody disturbed Garrick when he heard of it) and to Dublin, where their season ended disastrously through public disapproval of their behaviour. Dodd was stranded in Ireland and had to be rescued by Garrick, and Bulkley returned temporarily to her husband. The couple had a far more successful season in York four years later, by which time they had set up house together. But after a year or two the relationship collapsed again.<br>
<br>Physically, Dodd was very small, with &#145;a white, calf-like stupid face&#146;  (Thomas, 255), on which he could register all the comic emotions. He was sprightly when young, but grew slow and portly. He was respected by audiences and by colleagues who acknowledged his professional skill, but he never challenged King as the principal Drury Lane comedian. In his last season, 1795&#150;6, he was criticized for a poor Roderigo; his Mercutio was too fat, too old, and too slow; and he was made a scapegoat for the fiasco of <span class="italic">The Iron Chest</span>, a play by George Colman the younger with music by Stephen Storace. Colman himself attached greater blame to the leading player, John Philip Kemble, but Dodd bore the brunt of audience hostility. He retired at the end of the season, and during his last summer would take the air in Gray's Inn garden, where Lamb once met him. He died at his home, 8 Southampton Row, Bloomsbury, on 17 September 1796. He left an extensive library, which was auctioned by Sothebys in 2435 lots over nine days. He was survived by his son the Revd James Dodd (<i>d</i>. 1818), fellow of King's College, Cambridge, rector of North Runcton, and for many years an usher at Westminster School.<br>
