<span class="headword">Marshall <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Edwards]</span>,  Sybil Mary</span>  (1913&#150;2005), <span class="occ">educationist and author</span>, was born on 26 November 1913 at Lotting Fen, Ramsey, Huntingdonshire, the daughter of William Henry Edwards, farmer, and his wife, Kate Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Papworth. She grew up in the black fens of Huntingdonshire in Lotting Fen, a village three feet below sea level, without electricity or running water, in one of the poorest parts of the country. She was educated at Ramsey Heights elementary school (1919&#150;23) and Ramsey grammar school (1924&#150;32). She left at the height of the agricultural depression to become an unqualified, uncertificated teacher, first at South Woodham Ferrers, Essex (1933&#150;6), then in Huntingdon (1936&#150;9). On 27 August 1939 she married Francis Charles (Frank) Marshall, a 26-year-old local farmer then serving in the RAF. A son (<i>b</i>. 1940) died in childbirth, but the following year she gave birth to a daughter, Prue. In 1942 she became headteacher of Kingston county primary school, Cambridgeshire, a one-room, single-teacher school containing some twenty-six pupils aged between four and eleven. In 1948&#150;9 she attended Exhall Grange Emergency Training College, Coventry, before returning to Kingston county primary school, now as a qualified teacher. There she developed what she called her &#145;symphonic method&#146;, whereby subjects were integrated rather than being taught separately&#151;so that lessons, for instance, on the Romans might combine elements of literature, art, music, and home economics, as well as history. Meanwhile Frank Marshall found it difficult to keep up with such a brilliant wife, and eventually left her for another woman. They divorced in 1948.<br>
<br>When Kingston county primary school was closed by the government in 1960 Sybil Marshall won a bursary to New Hall, Cambridge, to read English as a mature student. (She had already, while still a teacher, attended a Cambridge University extramural class in English at Bassingbourn Village College.) She completed her degree in two years, graduating in 1962. She was immediately appointed a lecturer in primary education at Sheffield University under Boris Ford, who had heard her speak on the arts in education at a residential course for primary school teachers. While at Sheffield she published <span class="italic">An Experiment in Education</span> (1963), a highly influential account of her teaching methods at Kingston, which became known as &#145;the teacher's bible&#146;, and which clearly influenced the &#145;child-centred&#146; approach of the Plowden report, &#145;Children and their primary schools&#146;, of 1967. Also while at Sheffield, in 1963 she met a dapper little man, Ewart Oakeshott (1916&#150;2002), an accomplished commercial artist and an international authority on arms and armour, with whom she formed a close and loving relationship. They married in 1995 after the death of his first wife.<br>
<br>In 1967 Sybil Marshall had followed Boris Ford to the University of Sussex, where she was reader in primary education until her retirement in 1976. Among her publications on education during this period was <span class="italic">Adventure in Creative Education</span> (1968), a hilarious account of headteachers learning the Sybil Marshall method in a disused Rotherham warehouse. She was also educational adviser to the successful Granada Television series for children <span class="italic">Picture Box</span>, from 1965 to 1978. A short, round, jolly woman with a strong fenland accent, she was much loved by those who trained under her, or who worked with her.<br>
<br>In 1967 Sybil Marshall had published an engaging account of her fenland upbringing, and of local history and folklore, <span class="italic">Fenland Chronicle</span>. In retirement this was followed by <span class="italic">Everyman's Book of English Folk Tales</span> (1981), for which she won the Angel prize for literature in 1982, and <span class="italic">Once upon a Village</span> (1979), <span class="italic">The Silver New Nothing</span> (1987), and <span class="italic">A Pride of Tigers</span> (1992), containing further stories of fenland life. She published her first novel, <span class="italic">A Nest of Magpies</span>, in 1993. This and its sequels, <span class="italic">Sharp through the Hawthorn</span> (1994), <span class="italic">Strip the Willow</span> (1996), <span class="italic">A Late Lark Singing</span> (1997), and <span class="italic">Ring the Bell Backwards</span> (1999), was thinly disguised autobiography, the characters Fran and William being based on Sybil and Ewart Oakeshott (the latter providing the illustrations). She also published a collection of short stories, <span class="italic">The Chequer Board</span> (1995). She died of cerebrovascular disease on 29 August 2005 at her home, 40 St Mary's Street, Ely, and was survived by her daughter, Prue Atmore, a headmistress.<br>
