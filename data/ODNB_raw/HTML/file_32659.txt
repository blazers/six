<span class="headword">Cullen,  William</span>  (1867&#150;1948), <span class="occ">chemist and metallurgist</span>, was born at Shettleston, Glasgow, on 18 May 1867, the son of William Cullen and his wife, Margaret Johnston, of Uddingston, Glasgow. He came from a family engaged in the woollen industry and was educated in Glasgow at Hutchesons' Boys' Grammar School and, from 1883, at Anderson's College. There he studied chemistry under William Dittmar and remained as his assistant (1885&#150;90). Later he took a course in metallurgy and mining at the School of Mines in Freiburg, Germany.<br>
<br>In 1890 Cullen joined the Nobel Explosives Company Ltd, Glasgow, a connection which was maintained throughout his active life. For a time he worked with Kynochs, a rival explosives firm, and spent over two years as technical adviser at its Arklow factory. He returned to Nobels in 1900 and was appointed manager at the firm's Modderfontein factory, which in 1902 became the British South African Explosives Company. The factory was then the largest explosives works in the world and Cullen became its general manager in 1901 and later a director, an office he retained until 1924. Cullen was twice married: first, in 1897, to Jean Crichton Maclachlan (<i>d</i>. 1945), with whom he had three sons and one daughter; second, in 1946, to Agnes Campbell Macmillan, who survived him.<br>
<br>Technically, Cullen's work was mainly concerned with the development of smokeless powders and the design of plant for the convenient manipulation of the plastic mixtures which become the explosive. In 1915 he returned to Britain, where he made his home in London and joined the department of explosives supply of the Ministry of Munitions, where he worked with K. B. Quinan until 1919 on the design and layout of new explosives factories, needed during the First World War. Thereafter Cullen was active in consulting work, mainly connected with explosives and gold mining. He was a director of several public companies, and was involved in the work of various scientific societies.<br>
<br>Cullen arrived in the Transvaal during the South African War, and he played a modest part in the settlement of the South African provinces into the Union and empire. He liked to think of himself as a pioneer in the Rhodes tradition, and was extremely proud of his lifelong friendship with J. C. Smuts, whom he greatly admired. He knew every public personage in South Africa over many years. In the Witwatersrand mining conditions were bad and silicosis was a scourge, and he worked to promote good health conditions underground. He had a strong interest in education, and his efforts helped to bring about the foundation of the University of the Witwatersrand, from which he received the honorary degree of LLD in 1924. He was active in the newly formed scientific societies of South Africa and was president for 1905&#150;6 of the Chemical, Metallurgical and Mining Society, and secretary of the South African Association for the Advancement of Science. He was the first chairman of the South African Red Cross Society, which he helped to found and of which his first wife became head in Britain. She was made OBE for her services. He also served in the Johannesburg mounted rifles of which he was for two years second in command, and for eight years he commanded the regiment of Imperial light horse; he reached the rank of colonel, and was at one time invited to command all the mounted troops in the Transvaal.<br>
<br>Cullen belonged to the Institution of Mining and Metallurgy (president, 1929&#150;30), the Royal Institute of Chemistry, the Institution of Chemical Engineers (president, 1937&#150;9), and the Society of Chemical Industry (president, 1941&#150;3, and later an honorary member). He contributed papers to the publications of these societies. For some years he was honorary treasurer of the Universities Bureau of the British Empire, and a member of the advisory council on mineral resources and chairman of the consultative committee on base metals, both at the Imperial Institute. He wrote many papers and gave many addresses on empire matters. His lasting interest in education took varied forms: for many years, up to a few months before his death, he was a member of Surrey education committee and particularly concerned himself with further education. He was president of the Science Masters' Association in 1944.<br>
<br>For many years Cullen suffered from severe depression caused by an internal malady. When it was finally diagnosed and cured, he felt that he could at last live a normal life. He was, despite his illness, a man of buoyant disposition who could be relied upon for guidance, encouragement, and friendship. He died in the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, on 14 August 1948.<br>
