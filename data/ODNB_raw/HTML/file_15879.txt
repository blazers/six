<span class="headword">Laguerre,  Louis</span>  (1663&#150;1721), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born in France at Versailles, the son of the keeper of the royal menagerie there, a Catalan. Louis XIV is said to have been his godfather. Intending to join the priesthood, Laguerre was educated at the Jesuits' college in Paris, but his first career aim was thwarted by a speech impediment and, having a talent for drawing, he then studied at the Acad&eacute;mie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture. In 1682 he won third prize in the prix de Rome for a painting entitled <span class="italic">Cain batit la ville d'H&eacute;noch</span>, and another third prize the following year, for his sculpture <span class="italic">Invention des forges &hellip; par Tubal-Cain</span>. According to George Vertue he also spent a short time in the studio of Charles le Brun, and then, about 1684, moved to England, where he first worked as an assistant to the Italian decorative painter Antonio Verrio.<br>
<br>From about 1688 when he was employed at Thoresby, Nottinghamshire, Laguerre seems to have been working as a master decorator in his own right. His first major independent commission was for William Cavendish, first duke of Devonshire, at Chatsworth, Derbyshire, where between 1689 and 1697 he painted at least six interiors, including the hall and chapel, with mythological and religious subjects. Thereafter he was much in demand for decorative schemes in the baroque manner. He was employed by William III at Hampton Court Palace, where his work included a series of roundels illustrating the labours of Hercules on the exterior of Fountain Court. In 1698 he painted the ballroom at Burghley House, Cambridgeshire, with scenes from the story of Anthony and Cleopatra. Other documented commissions include several interiors at Canons, Middlesex, for James Brydges, first duke of Chandos, staircases at Buckingham House and Marlborough House, London, and at Petworth House, Sussex, and the saloon at Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire. An early eighteenth-century painted scheme illustrating episodes from the <span class="italic">Aeneid</span>, uncovered in the staircase hall at Frogmore House, Berkshire, in 1984, has also been attributed to Laguerre.<br>
<br>Laguerre was a director of Sir Godfrey Kneller's Academy of Painting, founded in 1711. His chief rival after the death of Verrio in 1707 was a fellow director of the academy, James Thornhill. In 1715 Laguerre was awarded the commission to paint the interior of the dome of St Paul's Cathedral, but &#145;by some political contrivance&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 2.125) he was replaced by Thornhill shortly after starting work. The following year Thornhill became governor of the academy, an appointment that Laguerre might have been expected to win. Although best-known as a decorative painter of interiors on a large scale, Laguerre also painted easel pictures, including portraits, and made designs for engravings and tapestry. His restoration of <span class="italic">The Triumph of Caesar</span> by Andrea Mantegna, at Hampton Court Palace, was praised by his contemporaries.<br>
<br>In interiors Laguerre normally painted in oil on plaster, a technique commonly used by decorative painters in England from the mid-seventeenth century, in an attempt to prevent damage caused by damp. Typically the overall format for Laguerre's interior decorative schemes takes the form of mythological scenes set in fictive &#145;pavilions&#146; on side walls, with columns framing the figures, and ceilings, crowded with more figures, illusionistically treated so as to appear to be open to the sky. In this Laguerre's work is similar to that of Verrio, but his manner is more sedate, and his use of colour generally more sober. Alexander Pope's reference to<blockquote>
<div class="indent">painted Ceilings &hellip;<br>
</div>
<div>Where sprawl the Saints of <i>Verrio</i> or <i>Laguerre</i>
<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Epistle to the Right Honourable Richard, Earl of Burlington</span>, 1731)</blockquote>memorably both links the two painters, and was written when their critical fortunes were beginning to decline. The reputations of both artists, perhaps unreasonably high in their lifetimes, have since sunk very low, probably equally unjustly, since much of their work in domestic interiors has been restored and overpainted, often many times, inhibiting assessment of its original quality.Laguerre was first married to Eleanor, daughter of Jean Tijou, the ironworker. His second wife, Sarah, survived him. His two sons <a name="cosubject_15879"></a><span class="headword">John Laguerre</span>  (<em>c.</em>1700&#150;1748)<span class="occ"></span> and Louis (<i>bap</i>. 5 Jan 1717) were also painters, though John, the elder, became better known as a stage singer, performing as a baritone in John Rich's company at Lincoln's Inn Fields from 1721 to 1740; he married the dancer and actress Mary Rogier (<i>d</i>. 1739) in 1724, and until her death they always worked together. He also sang in Handel's operas, including the first public performance of <span class="italic">Acis and Galatea</span> in March 1731, as Corydon. After his wife's death his theatrical career declined; he was imprisoned for debt in 1741, but was allowed to sing at his benefit performance on 23 April that year. He made a series of drawings, <span class="italic">Hob in the Well</span>, based on the opera <span class="italic">Flora</span> by William Bates in which Laguerre played Hob, engraved by Charles Dubose, which were popular. His portrait of the impostor Mary Tofts was engraved by John Faber. From 1746 Rich employed him as a scene painter. He died in impoverished circumstances on 28 March 1748.<br>
<br>Louis Laguerre also had two daughters, Sarah (<i>bap</i>. 26 April 1719) and Anne (<i>bap</i>. 28 Aug 1720), who, like their brother Louis, were baptized at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, where their mother's name was recorded as Sarah. He died suddenly of apoplexy on 20 April 1721, at Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre, London, where his son John was performing in <span class="italic">The Island Princess</span> as part of his first benefit. He was buried in the churchyard of St Martin-in-the-Fields.<br>
