<span class="headword">Travers <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Schlegelmilch]</span>,  Susan Mary Gillian</span>  (1909&#150;2003), <span class="occ">foreign legionnaire</span>, was born on 23 September 1909 at 35 Courtfield Gardens, Kensington, London, the younger child and only daughter of Captain Francis Eaton Travers (1863&#150;1953), naval officer, and his wife, Eleanor Catherine (Norah), younger daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel John Robertson Turnbull, of the 1st (Royal) Dragoons. Francis Travers had &#145;almost certainly&#146; married for money, and the marriage was unhappy  (Travers, 23). During the First World War, while he was away on war service, his wife and children lived with his wife's mother at her Torquay house. Susan Travers, by her own account unloved by her parents and brother and a loner, was educated by governesses, at a school in Babbacombe, Devon, and from 1918 to 1921 at St Mary's School, Wantage, Oxfordshire, an Anglican convent boarding school that she largely disliked, though she excelled at sport.<br>
<br>In 1921 Travers's family emigrated to Cannes, where she attended a private day school, the &Eacute;cole Cours F&eacute;nelon. At sixteen, she later wrote, &#145;Most of all, I wanted to be wicked. A wicked lady, flirting with danger and scandal&#146;  (Travers, 38). Aged sixteen and seventeen she attended Miss Penrose's finishing school in Florence. Aged seventeen, on a school visit to Rome, she was seduced by a middle-aged hotel manager. She decided, she later wrote, that &#145;men would become my salvation &hellip; my ticket to travel and wealth and happiness&#146;  (ibid., 47). Attractive, chic, slim, gamine, dark-haired and blue-eyed, with an allowance from her aunt, from 1929 to 1939 she was a rootless, hedonistic socialite, travelling in Europe, playing quasi-professional tennis, skiing, drinking, smoking, dancing, and&#151;&#145;une fille facile&#146;  (ibid., 49)&#151;experiencing transient affairs. She later wrote &#145;I'd been unable to say no to a man for fear of his rejection &hellip; none of the men I fell in love with ever asked me to marry them&#151;probably because I went to bed with them&#146;  (ibid., 52, 48&#150;9). Her parents returned to England but she continued on the continent and was in France, staying with a rich American divorcee at the latter's ch&acirc;teau near Poitiers, when the Second World War began.<br>
<br>In 1939 Travers volunteered for the Croix Rouge and, to qualify as an ambulance driver, completed three months' nursing training at a Poitiers hospital. In spring 1940 she went with a French ambulance unit to Finland, where she nursed convalescent Finnish soldiers. Following the fall of France she returned from Finland to England, arriving in July 1940. After failing to obtain other war service, in July 1940 she volunteered as a nurse at the Free French headquarters in London and was accepted, with the rank of sergeant. At the end of August she sailed with the Free French and British force bound for Dakar, Senegal. After the failure there in September, and nursing in Brazzaville, in 1941 she went with Free French forces to Eritrea. There she chauffeured a medical officer and, according to her autobiography, enjoyed an affair with a handsome married White Russian prince and officer in the Foreign Legion, Dmitry Amilakvari (1906&#150;1942). In May 1941 she went with the Free French via Egypt to Palestine. She was promoted <i>adjudant</i> (warrant officer), and continued chauffeuring. She served in the successful Syria campaign against the Vichy French, enduring strafing, bombing, hardship, and exhaustion. In Syria in June 1941 she became driver to Colonel (later General) Marie-Pierre Koenig (1898&#150;1970), with whom, according to her autobiography, she started a secret affair.<br>
<br>In February 1942 Koenig's brigade group was sent to Bir Hakeim in the barren wilderness of Cyrenaica, south of Tobruk: a pivotal position at the southern end of the Gazala line, where they endured heat, cold, sandstorms, flies, water shortage, and bombing by Stukas. In early May Italian and German tank and other forces attacked and were repulsed. Travers and the female nurses were ordered out but she soon returned, the only woman there. When at the end of the month Rommel launched his new offensive (26 May to 17 June) the Free French at Bir Hakeim fought heroically: surrounded, outnumbered, and their 75 mm guns outranged by German 105 mm guns. Their ammunition and water almost exhausted, on the night of 10&#150;11 June they broke out. Travers drove Koenig and Amilakvari and, under fire, they escaped back to the British lines, as did some 2700 of the garrison. According to the official French account and her autobiography, Travers drove Koenig out on the night of 10 June, but it has been alleged that they left the previous night, before the garrison. Bir Hakeim was militarily a defeat, yet it was symbolically and psychologically a triumph for the Free French. Travers wrote of the breakout, &#145;The love and respect I engendered amongst the Legion for that day and night of madness was to support and bolster me throughout the rest of the war and beyond&#146;  (Travers, 237). She was awarded the Croix de Guerre. However, according to her autobiography, Koenig, his career ascendant and his wife suspicious&#151;Italian radio broadcast that he had taken his mistress with him&#151;jilted her, and she considered suicide. In 1943 she served in Tunisia and, she later claimed, briefly resumed her affair with Koenig. In 1944 she served in Italy and in 1944&#150;5 in France, driving trucks and ambulances. In October 1944 she was promoted <i>adjudant-chef</i> (warrant officer first class). By the end of the war, she later wrote, &#145;I'd become the person I'd always wanted to be&#146;  (ibid., 294) and she feared the armistice &#145;meant an end to my great adventure&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>In June 1945, apparently through the influence of officer friends, Travers joined the Foreign Legion&#151;&#145;my adopted family, the people with whom I felt most at home&#146;  (Travers, 296)&#151;the first woman to do so, as an <i>adjudant-chef</i> in logistics. She served in Tunisia, then from 1946 to 1948 in Indo-China. In April 1947, four months pregnant and after &#145;my first genuine marriage proposal in thirty-seven years&#146;  (ibid., 313), she married, at Hoc-Mon, Nicholas Schlegelmilch, an Alsatian NCO in the Foreign Legion, four years younger than her; they had two sons. She resigned from the legion following her marriage. In 1949 Schlegelmilch was sent back to Indo-China, where he was seriously ill. He was mentally changed and their marriage was no longer close. He left the legion in 1950 and died in 1995. Travers was awarded the M&eacute;daille Militaire in 1956&#151;presented by Koenig, then minister of defence&#151;and the L&eacute;gion d'honneur in 1996. When married she rewrote and &#145;sanitized&#146; her secret war memoirs, written before her marriage, and burned the originals. In 1998&#150;9 with Wendy Holden she wrote her autobiography, published in 2000 as <span class="italic">Tomorrow to be Brave</span>: vivid but not entirely reliable. She died on 18 December 2003 in France.<br>
