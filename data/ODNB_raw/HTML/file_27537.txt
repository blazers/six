<span class="headword">Tonna <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Browne]</span>,  Charlotte Elizabeth</span>  (1790&#150;1846), <span class="occ">writer and social reformer</span>, was born on 1 October 1790 in Norwich, the daughter of Michael Browne, who was the rector of St Giles's Church and minor canon of Norwich Cathedral. Her father was also a staunch tory, and this family background, in addition to the paranoid political atmosphere of the Napoleonic era, probably caused her hostility to Roman Catholicism and her political Conservatism. She also lost her hearing at the age of ten and as a result became fascinated with imaginative literature, especially Shakespeare. Later in life she came to see this fascination as sinful because it served no useful, religious purpose, but her early reading in drama, poetry, and fiction provided excellent preparation for her future writing career.<br>
<br>Charlotte Elizabeth married an army officer, Captain George Phelan (<i>d</i>. 1837), and eventually accompanied him to his estate in Ireland. She developed a sincere affection for the Irish people but at the same time grew increasingly severe and evangelical in her religious convictions. She began publishing religious tracts through the Dublin Tract Society, using the name Charlotte Elizabeth. In 1824 she separated from her abusive husband and returned to England; she lived at first with her brother, Captain John Browne, at Clifton, where she met the evangelical writer Hannah More. She continued to write tracts such as <span class="italic">Conformity: a Tale</span> (1841) and <span class="italic">Falsehood and Truth</span> (1841) for children and the lower classes, and didactic fiction on subjects that interested her. Her stay in Ireland had only intensified her antipathy towards the Catholic church, since she saw it as the means by which the Irish people were enslaved in ignorance and superstition, a view she professed in her novel <span class="italic">Derry</span> (1833). In contrast, her attitude towards Judaism was more complex. In her novel <span class="italic">Judah's Lion</span> (1843) she argued that the Jews could fulfil their religion only by recognizing Jesus Christ, but she also recognized them as recipients of God's covenant. There is some evidence to suggest, however, that she eventually abandoned this conversionist attitude towards Judaism and devoted her efforts towards fighting antisemitism. In July 1844, for example, she presented a petition, signed by many of her influential friends (such as Lord Shaftesbury), to Tsar Nicholas I on behalf of his &#145;oppressed and burdened Jewish subjects&#146;  (Rubinstein, 14).<br>
<br>After Phelan's death Charlotte Elizabeth on 5 February 1841 married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27538/', "Lewis Hippolytus Joseph Tonna (1812&#150;1857)")</script>, a religious writer twenty years younger than herself, who encouraged her literary efforts. She was prolific as a writer and editor, publishing continuously and editing the <span class="italic">Christian Lady's Magazine</span> from 1834 to 1846, <span class="italic">The Protestant Annual</span> in 1840, and the <span class="italic">Protestant Magazine</span> from 1841 to 1846.<br>
<br>During the 1840s Tonna became convinced that industrialism threatened the physical and spiritual welfare of the poor, and she attacked the factory system in <span class="italic">Helen Fleetwood</span> (serialized 1839&#150;40), <span class="italic">The Wrongs of Woman</span> (serialized 1843&#150;4), and the anonymous, non-fictional <span class="italic">Perils of the Nation</span> (1842). Tonna died of breast cancer at Ramsgate on 12 July 1846, leaving a legacy of many literary works and active involvement with social causes, much of which is documented in her <span class="italic">Personal Recollections</span> (1841). Some of these causes, like her anti-Catholicism, are offensive to modern readers, but Tonna was also indefatigable in her support of the poor and oppressed. She wrote poetry and one novel, <span class="italic">The System</span> (1827), exposing the evils of slavery, but found an even more passionate voice in support of factory reform. Tonna's best works, <span class="italic">Helen Fleetwood</span> and <span class="italic">The Wrongs of Woman</span>, contain moving portrayals of physical and emotional suffering that are used to evoke audience sympathy. Tonna's contributions to social reform literature and her use of the <span class="italic">Christian Lady's Magazine</span> as a forum to influence politics through her female readers mark her as a significant nineteenth-century figure, especially for other women social reform writers, such as Harriet Beecher Stowe (who wrote the introduction for her collected works in 1844) and Elizabeth Gaskell. The rise of more formalist standards in literary criticism caused Tonna to fade quickly from literary history, however, and her work was almost entirely ignored until the women's movement created new interest in women's literature.<br>
