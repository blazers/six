<span class="headword">Munro,  James</span>  (1832&#150;1908), <span class="occ">politician and temperance advocate in Australia</span>, was born on 7 January 1832 at Glen Dubh in the parish of Eddrachillis, Sutherland, the second son of Donald Munro, a tenant farmer, and his wife, Georgina, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mackey. He left Armadale village school in 1848 to be apprenticed to Constable's printing works in Edinburgh. Here he soon joined the total abstinence movement. On 28 November 1853 he married Jane, the daughter of Donald Macdonald, a fellow printer, and in 1858 they migrated to Victoria with their three children.<br>
<br>After working as a printer, from the mid-1860s Munro emerged in the three main areas of his public life&#151;property investments, the abstinence movement, and politics. In 1865 he established the Victorian Permanent Property Investment and Building Society, of which he was secretary for seventeen years. He acquired interests in the Melbourne Woollen Mill Company and the Victoria Permanent Fire Insurance Company. In 1882 he established the Federal Banking Company and the associated Federal Building Society, which became his main means to extensive land dealing, speculation, and manipulation during the Melbourne land boom.<br>
<br>Munro won respect for his puritanical Presbyterianism and charitable activities. He was on the board of management of the Toorak Presbyterian Church (1878&#150;92), a board member of the Alfred Hospital (1876&#150;85), and a vice-president of the Caledonian Society of Melbourne. Sabbatarian and total abstinence advocacy preoccupied him, and he was prominent in the order of Rechabites, the Melbourne Total Abstinence Society (president, 1878&#150;92), the Permissive Bill Association, and its successor, the Victorian Alliance for the Suppression of Liquor Traffic (president, 1881&#150;92). He was also president of the two international temperance conferences held in Melbourne. He was a major shareholder in the grandiose temperance coffee palaces in Melbourne (Federal, Grand, and Victoria) and in Geelong and Broken Hill, which all soon ran into financial difficulties.<br>
<br>Having entered local politics, in 1872&#150;3 Munro was shire president of Gardiner shire. He stood unsuccessfully for parliament in 1869 but held various seats over twelve years between 1874 and 1890. As a supporter of protective tariffs, railway building, land reform, and votes for women (which be hoped would help the temperance campaign), he was associated with various shades of liberals, though he was in cabinet for only three months. One of his main parliamentary achievements was pressing for the 1880 International Exhibition.<br>
<br>In the late 1880s Munro reached the brief peak of his public life. He was one of the principal land boomers and acquired large leaseholds throughout the north of Australia. Having borrowed heavily to finance his investments, he appeared as a man of great wealth, living in a mansion in suburban Armadale. In 1887 he established the Real Estate Mortgage and Deposit Bank, and in 1890 he visited Britain to raise more capital for his speculations. His criticism of the Gillies&#150;Deakin coalition government's financial management led to his leadership of the more liberal parliamentary opposition. In October 1890 Munro carried a no-confidence motion and on 5 November he formed his own government, though he was hardly the man to implement financial reform.<br>
<br>The fragility of the boom, government finances, and his own financial empire now began to fracture. Munro struggled through 1891 to salvage his fortune and the government, but on 16 February 1892 he resigned and took refuge as Victorian agent-general in London. His escape was short-lived and he returned to witness the collapse of the Federal Bank in January 1893 and to file for bankruptcy in the following month, his failures contrasting with his moral pretensions.<br>
<br>After living on the charity of his family, Munro started a small suburban estate agency and auction room, and twice more stood unsuccessfully for parliament. He was widowed in 1904 and died at his daughter's residence in Caulfield, Melbourne, on 25 February 1908, survived by four of his five sons and his three daughters. He was buried at St Kilda on 27 February.<br>
