<span class="headword">Tayler,  William</span>  (1808&#150;1892), <span class="occ">East India Company servant</span>, youngest of the seventeen children of Archdale Wilson Tayler of Boreham Wood, Elstree, Hertfordshire, and his wife, Frances Eliza, sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11951/', "Charles Henry Hall")</script>, was born at Boreham Wood on 31 March 1808. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27012/', "John Frederick Tayler")</script> was his elder brother. William was educated at Charterhouse School and in early 1829 had just spent a term at Christ Church, Oxford, when he was unexpectedly offered a writership in the Bengal civil service.<br>
<br>Tayler arrived in Bengal in October 1829 and in June 1830 was appointed assistant to the commissioner of Cuttack. On 17 July 1830, in Calcutta, he married Charlotte Brydges, daughter of John Palmer, a merchant. Of their seven children, two daughters died in infancy. Tayler held various posts in Bengal, including that of postmaster-general, before becoming in 1855 commissioner of Patna. He was competent in Hindustani and Persian; like many district officers, he prided himself on knowing the country and her people and, furthermore, knowing them better than his superiors did. He was a keen amateur dramatist and skilful caricaturist, but while his witty portraits of Anglo-Indian notables won him some influential friends in Calcutta, the light-hearted nature of his artistic pursuits earned for him a reputation as a somewhat flighty, unserious officer. Moreover, in spite of his pen's readiness to deflate other people's vanities, he was himself remarkably thin-skinned and saw behind every hitch in his career cabals of intriguers and pompous, incompetent superiors.<br>
<br>Some months before the uprising of 1857 Tayler warned the Bengal government that there were signs of disaffection among the people of Bihar, in particular the Muslims. In response the lieutenant-governor, Frederick Halliday, suggested that this was partly Tayler's own fault and singled out for criticism his over-enthusiastic collection of &#145;voluntary&#146; subscriptions from local gentry for an industrial school he wanted to establish. It was a slight Tayler never forgave. In May 1857, when the Indian mutiny did finally break out up-country, Tayler, having long feared such a calamity, was quick to implement defensive measures in his own division, so quick in fact that the authorities in Calcutta worried that he was goading Bihar's still relatively peaceable population into rebellion. On 19 June he invited the leading Indians of Patna to his house, ostensibly for friendly discussions, and then arrested three of them, all prominent Muslim divines, whom he was convinced were plotting against the British. Halliday was appalled at such an act of bad faith. On 25 July the sepoys at Dinapore mutinied and laid siege to the station of Arrah. This was exactly what Tayler had feared most, and on 31 July, giving up Arrah and indeed all of the Bihar countryside as a hopeless case, he ordered the civil officers of his division to abandon their posts and fall back on Dinapore. To the authorities in Calcutta this smacked of panic, and on 4 August Halliday suspended Tayler from the commissionership.<br>
<br>Tayler's reading of the military situation had been determined by his unshakeable conviction that the Muslims of Bihar had masterminded a province-wide rebellion; he had expected therefore only to be able to hold the city of Patna, if indeed he could hold that. In part, of course, he was unlucky. Had Arrah fallen, as it could so easily have done, his insistence on defending Patna would have been deemed far-sighted. But in a war in which accounts of desperate last stands and acts of derring-do were instantly becoming part of imperial legend, his Cassandra-like defeatism was doomed to be seen as cowardice.<br>
<br>Tayler was aghast at his suspension and, convinced that he was a victim of Halliday's malice and envy, embarked upon an appeal process which was so vitriolic and intemperate that it inexorably led to his exit from the civil service. In 1858 he was appointed judge of Mymensingh, but in January of the following year was again suspended, on the grounds of his &#145;insufferably offensive conduct&#146;, and resigned the service in March. He appealed for redress to every secretary of state in succession from 1857 to 1888 and in 1888 also managed to have his case heard before the House of Commons. In spite of the fact that he had many influential supporters, among them two prominent historians of the uprising&#151;J. W. Kaye and Colonel G. B. Malleson&#151;and Sir Henry Havelock and <span class="italic">The Times</span>, his appeals were all rejected outright, not least because of his refusal to modify his intensely personal criticism of Halliday.<br>
<br>For eight years after his resignation Tayler practised successfully as an advocate in Calcutta before returning to London in 1867. In addition to numerous pamphlets connected with his case, he published in 1881&#150;2 a two-volume autobiography, <span class="italic">Thirty-Eight Years in India</span>, profusely illustrated with his own sketches. He died at his home, 19 Markwick Terrace, St Leonards, Sussex, on 5 March 1892; he was survived by his wife. Both of their sons, Skipwith Henry Churchill and Henry Vansittart, had careers in the Indian Civil Service.<br>
