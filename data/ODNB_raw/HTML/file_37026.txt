<span class="headword">Workman,  Herbert Brook</span>  (1862&#150;1951), <span class="occ">Methodist minister and college head</span>, was born in Peckham, London, on 2 November 1862, son of John Sansom Workman, a Welseyan Methodist minister, and his wife, Mary Brook. Educated at Kingswood School, Bath, of which his younger brother, W. P. Workman, was later headmaster (1889&#150;1918), he took a London BA (1884) and MA (1885) from Owens College, Manchester, and prepared at Didsbury College for the Methodist ministry. He married in 1891 Ethel Mary, daughter of Alban Gardner Buller, solicitor, of Birmingham; they had two sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Workman had a notable spell of fifteen years as a circuit minister before serving as principal of Westminster Training College in 1903&#150;30. After the long regime of the redoubtable J. H. Rigg the college needed a new, tough broom. Workman brought to the task not only his own growing reputation as a scholar, with a flair for picking colleagues and pupils of coming eminence, but great gifts of shrewdness and administrative prescience. He raised the college to a new eminence, and his concentration on training teachers at Westminster and at the sister college of Southlands stood his church in valuable stead at a time of crisis in its educational policy when numbers of Methodist day schools were closing. From 1919 until his retirement in 1940 he held the important office of secretary of the Methodist education committee. The most notable of his achievements was the consolidation of a ring of Methodist residential schools, to which, through his efforts, there were notable additions. He was a member of the senate of the University of London, which awarded him the degree of DLitt (1907).<br>
<br>Workman was the first distinguished church historian to come from the Methodist church, and perhaps the first protestant and nonconformist scholar to show sensitive sympathy with the medieval church. It is true that his first historical writings, begun as a circuit minister, treated the elements of dissent within medieval Christendom. The small volumes <span class="italic">The Church of the West in the Middle Ages</span> (2 vols., 1898&#150;1900) and <span class="italic">The Dawn of the Reformation</span> (2 vols., 1901&#150;2) have long been superseded, but are remarkable for the care and accuracy with which their author had studied a great range of authorities and sought the truth among the primary documents. These studies found their climax in the sympathetic portrayal of John Hus, to which his <span class="italic">Letters of John Hus</span> (1904) formed a useful epilogue. There followed studies in the early church, <span class="italic">Persecution in the Early Church</span> (1906) and <span class="italic">The Evolution of the Monastic Ideal</span> (1913), which showed his flair for colourful and interesting narrative material. His <span class="italic">Christian Thought to the Reformation</span> (1911) is in contrast disappointing and not very perceptive. His great work, however, was his massive study <span class="italic">John Wyclif</span> (2 vols., 1926). Workman was preparing a further volume to cover the history of later Lollardy at the time of his death. Probably his best single writing was his classic essay, published as <span class="italic">The Place of Methodism in the Catholic Church</span> (1921), originally written for the <span class="italic">New History of Methodism</span> (2 vols., 1909), of which he was one of the editors. There his evangelical convictions and his wide catholic sympathies enabled him to set the evangelical revival against the long perspective of the Christian past. The worth of his studies was recognized by the University of Aberdeen, which awarded him the degree of DD in 1914. Workman died at his home, 29 Vineyard Hill Road, Wimbledon, on 26 August 1951. He was survived by his wife.<br>
