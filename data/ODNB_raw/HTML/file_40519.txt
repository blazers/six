</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Jellicoe, Sir  Geoffrey Alan</span>  (1900&#150;1996), <span class="occ">landscape architect</span>, was born on 8 October 1900 at 70 Wynnstay Gardens, Chelsea, London, the younger son of George Edward Jellicoe, publisher's manager, and later publisher, and his wife, Florence Waterson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Waylett. His parents separated when he was about fourteen and he lived alone with his mother, his teenage older brother having been swept into fighting in the First World War. He attended Cheltenham College as an exhibitioner, seeing as little of his father as possible, and money was scarce. His mother was an artist who had been trained at the Slade School; later in life she went on to create a series of free style embroidery pictures.<br>
<br>From January 1919 until 1923 Jellicoe attended the Architectural Association School of Architecture in Bloomsbury, London. He then travelled with Jock Shepherd, a fellow student, in Italy, where they collected material for their classic book, <span class="italic">Italian Gardens of the Renaissance</span> (1925). The book was illustrated by Shepherd's exquisite plans and cross-sections, based on Jellicoe's survey drawings: &#145;We suddenly realised we were into an extraordinary field of discovery, because as the drawing began to appear on paper, one realised the beauty of the actual plan and how it related to the site&#146;  (Harvey, <span class="italic">Reflections</span>, 4). So started Jellicoe's lifelong and stimulating journey of discovery of landscape design, a field in which he was pre-eminent throughout his long and active life. In 1930 he was a Bernard Webb scholar at the British School in Rome.<br>
<br>Soon after their return from Italy Jellicoe and Shepherd set up in practice together, but in 1931 Jellicoe started his own practice at 40 Bloomsbury Square, London, feeling the need to break free from Shepherd's dominance as a designer. He continued to write: he had published <span class="italic">Gardens and Design</span> (1927) with Shepherd, and (as sole author) he published <span class="italic">Baroque Gardens of Austria</span> in 1932. He also taught at the Architectural Association (1929&#150;34). He soon had interesting design opportunities. He built the international style Cheddar Gorge Caveman Restaurant (1934), the roof of which was a glass floored pool. He created several landscapes for private clients, often co-operating with Russell Page as planting designer; one of these was the Royal Lodge, Windsor, for the duke and duchess of York. An important work was extensive new formal gardens at Ditchley Park (1935&#150;9) for Ronald and Nancy Tree, clients who, followed by their son Michael, remained patrons for fifty years. As well as several faithful clients there were other strands of continuity in Jellicoe's richly varied career. He always lived by Highgate Hill in London, and his office was always in Bloomsbury.<br>
<br>On 11 July 1936 Jellicoe married Ursula Pares [<a name="cosubject_66956"></a><span class="headword">Ursula <span class="st"> [Susan]</span> Jellicoe</span>  (1907&#150;1986)], who had joined the office as secretary, drawn by her interest in the arts. They enjoyed a happy and fruitful fifty-year marriage and professional co-operation, in which Susan gradually built up a distinct oeuvre of her own. She had secretarial qualifications, was fluent in Russian, French, German, and Italian, and had been working as personal secretary to the managing director of the Anglo-Continental Bank. She must have seemed surprisingly high-powered to have wanted to become secretary to so small a practice, even one run by someone so lively. Susan was born on 30 June 1907 at 18 Gambier Terrace, Liverpool, one of the six children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35378/', "Professor Sir Bernard Pares (1867&#150;1949)")</script>, historian and co-founder of the School of Slavonic and East European Studies at London University, and his wife, Margaret Ellis (Daisy), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dixon (1879&#150;1964). Her early childhood was in Liverpool, then on the Wirral. From 1920 to 1925 she attended St Paul's Girls' School while living with her mother and grandparents in Belsize Park (her parents having separated in 1919). She was a graceful, artistic child, a beautiful classical dancer, and loved singing and music throughout her life. During the Second World War she worked in the Ministry of Information and distinguished herself by revealing analysis of aerial photography. From their marriage until 1984 the Jellicoes lived in a narrow Georgian house with a long garden at 19 Grove Terrace, Parliament Hill Fields. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>Jellicoe did much to promote the profession of landscape architecture. In 1929 he was a founder member of the Institute of Landscape Architects (later, to his delight, broadened into the Landscape Institute). From 1939 to 1949 he was the institute's president, keeping it alive through the arduous years of war. He edited the institute's <span class="italic">Journal</span> from 1941 to 1945. He was busy during the war on emergency housing and other mainly architectural work, including immediate restoration of areas wrecked by bombs. He recorded &#145;That whenever a bomb fell &hellip; I thought this means another thousand or two in one's pocket! This was so horrible that &hellip; that was why one financed landscape during the war&#146; by passing on all money from this source to the Institute of Landscape Architects  (Harvey, <span class="italic">Reflections</span>, 10). This was typical of his strong sense of honour, integrity, and generosity, which left him at the end of his long and successful life with few accumulated resources other than a collection of pictures and numerous admiring friends and colleagues. During the same period he was also principal of the Architectural Association School (1939&#150;42), a task he found exhausting and unrewarding. In 1948 he chaired an international conference for landscape architects in London and Cambridge, at the conclusion of which representatives from sixteen countries founded the International Federation of Landscape Architects, later a worldwide organization. Jellicoe was elected first president (1948&#150;54) and was thereafter honorary president for life.<br>
<br>Jellicoe continued to run a practice until 1973, from about 1954 in partnership with the architect Francis Coleridge. Much of the work of the practice was architectural, and the design of buildings was certainly the primary source of income. For the period 1943&#150;73 Michael Spens ascribed eighty-three works to Jellicoe, of which eighteen were abortive designs and five were in Northern Rhodesia (1947&#150;52). Several of his landscape works during this period were seminal in character, expressive of ideas which only later became widely accepted. Hope cement works in the Peak District (1943) was a fifty-year plan for the development and restoration of an industrial site and quarry. A rooftop caf&eacute; and water garden were created at Harvey's department store in Guildford (1956&#150;7). At Hemel Hempstead linear water gardens gave delight to those moving into the shopping centre from town car parks (1959). Waste spoil was shaped into curvaceous hills at Park Royal (1959) and Harwell (1960). A plan for the centre of Gloucester included building height restrictions to safeguard views of the cathedral tower (1961).<br>
<br>During the same period Jellicoe started to collect contemporary pictures, first influenced by Frederick Gibberd, with whom he travelled each year to study important landscapes. He served on the Royal Fine Arts Commission (1954&#150;68) and greatly enjoyed his period as a trustee of the Tate Gallery (1967&#150;74). This led to warm friendships with Henry Moore and Ben Nicholson, whose work he greatly admired.<br>
<br>For many years Jellicoe was interested in the subconscious in landscape design, an idea he explored more deeply in creating the Kennedy Memorial at Runnymede (1964). &#145;It gave me my first serious opportunity to put a subconscious idea into a work, so that it is more important and more lasting than the purely visual impression the eye receives&#146;  (Harvey, <span class="italic">Reflections</span>, 17). Everything seen is underlain by an allegorical unseen meaning; the granite setts represent the multitude of pilgrims on their way upwards, the woodlands the cycle of life, the slightly curved memorial stone appears to float above the ground. The place is indeed peaceful and inspiring. Jellicoe's three volumes of <span class="italic">Studies in Landscape Design</span> (1960, 1966, and 1970) explored connections between artworks, landscapes, and hidden ideas, connections later summarized in his Guelph lectures (1983). His designs too developed in controlled and sophisticated use of more abstract forms combined with traditional, exemplified by the central pool at Wisley (1971&#150;2), and the exquisite Shute gardens for Michael and Lady Anne Tree (1970&#150;80).<br>
<br>In 1973 &#145;the partnership ceased, I closed the office and one retired to one's home where one thought one would probably lead a quiet old age. <span class="italic">The Landscape of Man</span> was the last major work one ever hoped to do and that was published in 1975&#146;, Jellicoe later recalled  (Harvey, <span class="italic">Reflections</span>, 23&#150;4). <span class="italic">The Landscape of Man</span> proved a seminal work. Geoffrey and Susan Jellicoe wrote this great book together, starting in 1957, Susan taking many of its photographs. It was an exploration of examples of man's shaping of the environment worldwide throughout time, opening with the words: &#145;The world is moving into a phase when landscape design may well be recognised as the most comprehensive of the arts&#146;.<br>
<br>Susan Jellicoe had by this time established herself as an important figure in the world of landscape architecture. She was elected honorary associate of the Landscape Institute in 1968. She possessed a remarkable aptitude in quickly mastering and then excelling in any subject of interest to her. She had become a fine plantsman, and prepared planting schemes for many of her husband's landscapes. She was also an excellent black and white landscape photographer, her photographs appearing in several books in which she collaborated. These included <span class="italic">Modern Private Gardens</span> (1968) and <span class="italic">The Use of Water in Landscape Architecture</span> (1971), both with her husband; three books with Lady Marjory Allen, including <span class="italic">Town Gardens to Live in</span> (1977); and <span class="italic">The Gardens of Mughal India</span> (1972), with text by Sylvia Crowe and Sheila Haywood. She was an active member of the Garden History Society. She was editor of the magazine <span class="italic">Landscape Design</span> for twenty years, and also chairman of the Landscape Institute's journal committee, which was responsible for this magazine. She edited the <span class="italic">Observer</span>'s gardening panel from 1961 to 1965. In 1985 she was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Sheffield and was invested at home a few days before her death. She was a gifted cook and the Jellicoes frequently entertained visitors of all ages at 19 Grove Terrace. She died at the Arkley Nursing Home, Wood Street, Barnet, Hertfordshire, on 1 August 1986, of Parkinson's disease, and was cremated on 10 August at Golders Green, London.<br>
<br>From the age of eighty Jellicoe's creativity enjoyed a final passionate flowering, continuing even during Susan's last years, when he nursed her devotedly. They had moved in 1984 to a small modern flat with a wonderful view over Hampstead Heath, at 14 High Point, Highgate, designed in 1936 by Lubetkin and Tecton. He seemed to be happier working on his own without the pressures involved in managing an office. With an ever-smiling round face and bouncy demeanour he would brief younger colleagues on how to carry out his designs on site. Previously an uninspiring draughtsman, he started to produce large exquisite drawings in stipple and irregular ink line, enlivened with patches of colour; he would spend his morning over a drawing board in a tiny room in the flat. He was elected a Royal Academician in 1991 and held an exhibition there in 1994. &#145;I have a perfectly clear philosophy now in one's old age, that one can do good through one's work, which means that through this I should like everybody to experience life at a much deeper level than that of the visible world&#146;  (Harvey, <span class="italic">Reflections</span>, 29). He read widely and was greatly interested in Jung's theories about the subconscious. &#145;Like the portrait painter, the landscape designer needs to be a psychologist first and a technician afterwards. He needs to dig into the subconscious&#146;  (Parkin and Fieldhouse, 7&#150;11).<br>
<br>Jellicoe's gardens at Sutton Place, Guildford (1980&#150;86), for Stanley Seeger included a romantic lake, walled gardens on both sides of the house, a characteristic long walk leading to a &#145;Magritte Walk&#146;, with strange optical scale effects, and a beautifully placed sculpted wall by Ben Nicholson. The whole was an inspiration. He designed landscape town plans for Modena and Brescia in Italy, the botanical and historical Moody Gardens for Galveston, Texas, and the Atlanta Historical Gardens in Georgia. Irrepressibly he produced numerous large detailed drawings in his own hand for these projects. Though in his last few years he became unable to leave home, he entertained visitors with a flood of ideas. At his well-attended ninetieth birthday party he delivered an inspiring and forward-looking speech in response to citations by others about the past. He subsequently set about founding the Landscape Foundation to promote new ideas in landscape design.<br>
<br>Jellicoe was honoured by Landscape Architects' gold medals worldwide, American (1981), British (1985), and Australian (1990). He received the Royal Horticultural Society's Victoria medal of honour in 1995. In 1961 he was appointed CBE and in 1979 knighted. He worked on cheerfully until a year before his death, on 17 July 1996, at the Check House Nursing Home, Beer Street, Seaton, Devon, of heart failure. He was cremated on 25 July at Golders Green, London. In Kathryn Moore's words, he left &#145;a distinctive body of work, showing the development of his ideas across a turbulent century. He also leaves us with an enduring impression of energy, passion and enthusiasm&#146;  (Harvey, <span class="italic">LDT Monograph</span>, 151).<br>
