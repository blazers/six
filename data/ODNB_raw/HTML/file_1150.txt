<span class="headword">Balcanquhall,  Walter</span>  (1548/9&#150;1616), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, was associated with the place name of Balcanquhal in the parish of Strathmiglo, Fife. Although Archbishop Patrick Adamson of St Andrews accused him in 1584 of &#145;small educatioun in learning&#146;  (Calderwood, 4.84), Balcanquhall was educated at St Andrews University, where he matriculated at St Leonard's College in 1566 and graduated in 1569. By 1570 he had entered the ministry of the reformed church in the subordinate capacity of exhorter at Auchtertool in Fife. Thereafter he served as minister in 1571 at Bothans and Barro in Lothian before moving to Edinburgh. On Whit Sunday 1574 he entered St Giles's as minister in Edinburgh, and along with his colleagues James Lawson and John Durie became an enthusiastic supporter of the presbyterian cause within the church.<br>
<br>With the downfall of the earl of Morton in 1578 and the growing ascendancy of Esm&eacute; Stewart, amid heightened fears of a popish plot and of French influence at court, Balcanquhall was summoned before the privy council in December 1580 to answer for his sermon condemning the influx of Roman Catholics to Edinburgh and French courtiers who &#145;polluted&#146; the king's ear. He attended Morton before his execution on 2 June 1581 and offended the king by criticizing Stewart's activities, for which he was called before the privy council in 1581. He then declined the council's jurisdiction in matters spiritual, arguing that the general assembly was the appropriate body &#145;to whom the judgement of his doctrine sould apperteane&#146;  (Calderwood, 3.584). The assembly, for its part, found nothing in his sermon &#145;that conteinit either errour, slander or just offence, bot solid, good and true doctrine&#146;  (Thomson, <span class="italic">Acts</span>, 2.543). Balcanquhall also opposed the crown's appointment of Robert Montgomery, minister of Stirling, to the archbishopric of Glasgow, and in 1582, despite threats of violence, he intimated from the pulpit of Edinburgh Montgomery's excommunication for accepting the archbishopric in defiance of the general assembly's wishes.<br>
<br>On 15 May 1584 James Stewart, earl of Arran, became chancellor at the head of an anti-presbyterian regime. Balcanquhall was outspoken in his condemnation of the &#145;black acts&#146;, issued that month, which asserted the king's supremacy over the church, reaffirmed the role of bishops, proscribed presbyteries, and prohibited meetings of other church courts without the king's express consent. At that point, too, he used the pulpit of Edinburgh &#145;to sound mightelie in the praise&#146; of Andrew Melville, who had escaped prosecution for opposing the &#145;black acts&#146; by fleeing to England  (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Diary of &hellip; Melvill</span>, 145). He also preached against &#145;godlesse start-ups&#146;  (Calderwood, 4.20), and before long he and Lawson were obliged to seek safety in England. From Berwick they wrote to their congregation of Edinburgh in June 1584 condemning Arran's hostility to the church:<blockquote>Ye see the whole discipline violentlie plucked out of the hands of them to whome Christ Jesus has committed the spirituall government, and givin into the hands of them who have their calling in the world of men, and not of God; Assembleis discharged and excommunicatioun made null by them who have no power to bind and loose. (Calderwood, 4.74)</blockquote>Balcanquhall was married to Margaret Marjoribanks, daughter of an Edinburgh merchant. During his absence in England his wife, who had remained in Edinburgh together with Lawson's wife, conducted a spirited defence of the presbyterian exiles and launched a scathing attack on Adamson as archbishop.<br>
<br>Having arrived in London by 23 June, with other presbyterian exiles, Balcanquhall had meetings with Sir Francis Walsingham and &#145;talked with the godly and zealous brethren&#146; there  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1584&#150;5</i>, no. 195). He also attended Lawson's funeral in London in October 1584 and was a witness to his testament. While in London he preached several sermons until prevented from doing so again. In January 1585 he was summoned before Bishop John Aylmer of London, who explained that a command for the exiled Scots ministers to cease preaching had been issued on the privy council's initiative. With the fall of Arran's government in November 1585, however, following the palace revolution effected by the leaders of the Ruthven raid, now returned from exile, Balcanquhall journeyed home in the company of Andrew Melville and resumed his ministry in Edinburgh. He preached before the king in St Giles's in January 1586, claiming that ministers had as great authority as bishops, but James rebuked him, undertaking to &#145;prove there sould be bishops and spirituall magistrats endued with authoritie over the ministrie&#146;  (Calderwood, 4.491). Balcanquhall was appointed to attend the coronation of Queen Anne in 1590, but in 1591 he irritated the king by defending Knox's reputation, and in 1592 James was again offended by one of his sermons. Balcanquhall continued to preach against Arran, who was received at court in 1592, by recounting &#145;what mischeefe he had done before&#146; and how Lennox had been &#145;the cheefe worker of his bringing in&#146;  (Calderwood, 5.187). After the riot in Edinburgh in December 1596 Balcanquhall was denounced for not compearing before the privy council, but he escaped imprisonment by fleeing to Yorkshire and in a joint letter with Robert Bruce maintained his innocence.<br>
<br>With the division of Edinburgh into separate parishes, in 1598 Balcanquhall was appointed minister of Trinity Church for the north-east quarter of the burgh. In 1600 he again incurred the king's wrath for declining to acknowledge James's version of the Gowrie conspiracy and was ordered to be translated from Edinburgh; however, he re-entered his ministry there on the king's birthday (19 June 1601). In 1606 he protested at the harsh treatment accorded those convicted of treason for holding a general assembly at Aberdeen in defiance of the king's wishes. He also condemned the assembly's decision in 1610 to acquiesce in the king's revival of episcopacy. By 19 July 1616 Balcanquhall had ceased preaching, and he died on 4 August following, in his sixty-eighth year. He was buried the following day. He had three sons: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1151/', "Walter Balcanquhall")</script>, dean first of Rochester and then of Durham; Robert, minister of Tranent; and Samuel; and six daughters: Katherine, Rachel, Sarah, Margaret, Libra, and Anna.<br>
