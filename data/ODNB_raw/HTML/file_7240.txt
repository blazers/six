<span class="headword">Davies <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Banks]</span>,  James</span>  (1820&#150;1883), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born in Kington, Herefordshire, on 20 May 1820, the second son of Richard Banks and his wife, Esther, niece of James Davies of Moor Court, Herefordshire. Educated at Repton School, he matriculated as James Banks at St Mary Hall, Oxford, in 1841, but migrated to Lincoln College, where he held a scholarship, graduating BA in 1844 (taking third-class honours in classics) and MA in 1846. In 1847 he married Frances Helen, daughter of Abraham Henry Young. From 1847 to 1852 he was incumbent of Christ Church, Forest of Dean, and was headmaster of Ludlow grammar school from 1852 until 1857; he was also diocesan inspector of schools.<br>
<br>In 1858 Banks changed his name to Davies by royal licence on succeeding to his uncle's property at Moor Court, where he resided, combining the functions of squire, clergyman, and banker, becoming a partner in his brother's bank. He erected a church in his own grounds for the convenience of his neighbours, for whom the parish church was too remote. He was made a prebendary of Hereford in 1875. His time, however, was principally devoted to literature, especially the pursuits of classical scholarship.<br>
<br>For many years Davies wrote the majority of the classical articles in the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>, and he was the author of a lengthy essay entitled &#145;Epigrams&#146; in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> for January 1865. In 1860 he published a metrical translation of the <span class="italic">Fables</span> of Babrius, from the text of his friend Sir George Cornewall Lewis. This version included the apocryphal second part, the spuriousness of which was not then generally recognized. He produced several editions and translations of classical authors, including prose versions of Hesiod, Theognis, and Callimachus for <span class="roman">Bohn's Classical Library</span>, and in 1873 and 1876 wrote volumes on Hesiod and Theognis, and on Catullus, Tibullus, and Propertius, for Collins's series <span class="roman">Ancient Classics for English Readers</span>. A volume of original verse entitled <span class="italic">Nugae</span> was published in 1854. Davies also wrote on architecture, archaeology, topography, and horticulture. He revised several of <span class="roman">Murray's Guides</span> for the press, and contributed many articles to <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span>, the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span>, and the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>. He died after a prolonged decline of health at Moor Court, Herefordshire, on 11 March 1883.<br>
