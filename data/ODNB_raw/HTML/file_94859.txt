<span class="headword">Cudlipp,  Reginald William <span class="st"> [Reg]</span></span>  (1910&#150;2005), <span class="occ">journalist and promoter of Anglo-Japanese relations</span>, was born on 11 December 1910 at 118 Lisvane Street, Cardiff, the second of three sons and second of four children of William Christopher Cudlipp, commercial traveller for a provision merchant, and his wife, Bessie Amelia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kinsman. The sons&#151;<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32658/', "Percy Cudlipp (1905&#150;1962)")</script>, Reginald, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69790/', "Hubert (Hugh) Cudlipp (1913&#150;1998)")</script>&#151;were unique in that, for a brief period in 1953, they all had editorial control of London-based national newspapers.<br>
<br>The three boys were educated in Cardiff, at Gladstone elementary school and Howard Gardens secondary school, which they all left in their early teens to become apprentice journalists. Reginald occupied a lowly position on the <span class="italic">Penarth News</span>, a small weekly paper serving the seaside resort just south of Cardiff, which later gave Hugh his first job. Reginald had been assiduous in acquiring the basic skills of shorthand and typing and, while still a teenager, was hired as a reporter and sub-editor by the <span class="italic">Western Mail</span>, the national newspaper of Wales. He stayed in Cardiff until 1938, when he moved to London to work as a sub-editor on the <span class="italic">News of the World</span>. When the Second World War broke out in 1939 he joined the Royal Artillery and was posted to Gibraltar, where he edited a monthly magazine for servicemen, <span class="italic">The Rock</span>. Towards the end of the war he was made a captain and sent to Calcutta as associate editor of a similar publication, in which capacity he witnessed the surrender of the Japanese in Singapore in September 1945. The same year he married Rachel Joyce Braham. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>On demobilization Cudlipp returned to London and in 1946 rejoined the <span class="italic">News of the World</span>, which sent him to New York as its United States correspondent. In 1948 he returned to London as features editor, rising to deputy editor two years later, and inheriting the editorial chair in 1953 when his predecessor, Arthur Waters, died in office. He was the last of the brothers to achieve this status: Percy was by then editor of the <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span> and Hugh editor-in-chief of the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span> and <span class="italic">Sunday Pictorial</span>. When Reginald won his promotion the three met for a celebratory dinner&#151;but Percy was dismissed by the <span class="italic">Herald</span> ten days later.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">News of the World</span>'s circulation was then above 8 million&#151;more than any other British newspaper has achieved before or since. It was notable for its thorough reporting of divorces and court cases involving sexual offences. &#145;We'd have one page for the dirtiest cases of the week,&#146; Cudlipp recalled in 2002, &#145;although they wouldn't raise an eyebrow these days&#146;  (Hagerty, 27). Yet he was probably not the most suitable editor for that kind of newspaper. A tall, lean man of studious demeanour, he was known by his colleagues as the Bishop. By 1959 the <span class="italic">News of the World</span>'s circulation had fallen to just over 6 million and he was replaced by his deputy, Stafford Somerfield, a portly <i>bon vivant</i>.<br>
<br>Unemployed at forty-nine, Cudlipp took some time to find a new career path; and when he did it was a surprising one for a former editor of a mass-market newspaper. In 1961 he became director of the Anglo-Japanese Economic Institute and editor of its quarterly journal, <span class="italic">Japan</span>. The institute's primary mission was to foster trading links between Britain and the nation that had emerged from wartime defeat to develop the most powerful economy in the Far East. Cudlipp also became enthused by the possibilities of co-operation between Japan and developing countries, especially those in Africa. He took on his role with energy and became deeply attached to Japan. In a booklet in 1973 he wrote: &#145;I always tell diehard sceptics who prefer to think of Japan in terms of sweated labour and shoddy products that they really ought to go there some time&#146;  (R. W. Cudlipp, <span class="italic">Japan: Some of the Problems of the Seventies</span>, 1973, 6). In the numerous articles and pamphlets that he wrote for the institute he adoped a schoolmasterly tone, urging British exporters to redouble their efforts to break into this expanding market, however great a challenge it represented. His commitment made a powerful impression on the Japanese and in 1982 he was awarded their equivalent of a knighthood when admitted to the order of the Sacred Treasure.<br>
<br>Cudlipp regarded himself as a journalist first and foremost, and when he stepped down from the institute in 1986, at the age of seventy-five, he was proud to declare that he had served sixty years in the profession. He spent an active retirement with his wife in Arundel, Sussex, writing and lecturing well into his eighties on Japan and its relations with the rest of the world. He died from prostate cancer at St Richard's Hospital, Chichester, on 21 January 2005, and was survived by his wife.<br>
