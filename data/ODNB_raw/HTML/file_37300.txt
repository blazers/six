<span class="headword">Colbeck,  William</span>  (1871&#150;1930), <span class="occ">Antarctic explorer</span>, was born at 8 Myton Place, Hull, on 8 August 1871, the second son and second child in the family of three sons and three daughters of Christopher Colbeck, baker, and his wife, Martha Ann Haggitt. He followed a seagoing career against his father's wishes, apparently influenced by the maritime traditions of his mother's family, and after attending Hull grammar school was apprenticed from 1886 to 1890 aboard the square-rigger <i>Loch Torridon</i>, sailing between Britain and Calcutta. He passed his master's ticket in 1894 with the aid of private tuition from Zebedee Scaping, headmaster of the Hull Trinity House Navigation School.<br>
<br>In 1894 Colbeck joined the Wilson Line in Hull as second mate of the SS <i>Draco</i> and three years later a chance meeting with the Norwegian explorer Borchgrevink, a passenger in his vessel, the <i>Montebello</i>, led to Colbeck joining the <i>Southern Cross</i> expedition (1898&#150;1900) as magnetic observer, following an intensive course of instruction at Kew observatory. The party was the first to winter in Antarctica. With Ole Larsen, a Finn, Colbeck reached the furthest south (78&deg; 50') thus far achieved and made the first accurate map of the Ross ice shelf. These explorations convinced him of the best route to the south pole, later followed by Roald Amundsen, who in 1912 after his triumph sent Colbeck a letter of thanks. Friction between the Royal Geographical Society and Borchgrevink prevented their efforts from receiving due recognition, though Colbeck received the Murchison grant from the society. However, he impressed Sir Clements Markham, who selected him to command the SY <i>Morning</i> (formerly the Norwegian whaler <i>Morgen</i>), sent in 1902 to the relief of the <i>Discovery</i> expedition of Robert Falcon Scott. The crew consisted of Wilson Line men and hand-picked officers, including E. R. G. R. Evans as second mate.<br>
<br>In December 1902 new land was discovered which Colbeck called Scott Island and its prominent feature, a stone column, Haggitt's Pillar, was given his mother's maiden name. <i>Discovery</i> was found, ice-bound, on Christmas day. Unable to penetrate this obstacle Colbeck left 14 tons of provisions and 20 tons of coal for the marooned expedition. Leaving Hobart in December 1903 the <i>Morning</i> (now transferred to the command of the Admiralty) and <i>Terra Nova</i> reached <i>Discovery</i> early the next year and she was blasted free from the enclosing ice. Outstripped by the <i>Discovery</i>, the <i>Morning</i> reached Plymouth too late for the welcome celebrations but arriving back in Hull on 9 October Colbeck and ten of his crew were mobbed at Paragon station. In appreciation of his efforts he received a magnificent loving cup from the Royal Geographical Society, engraved with the course of the <i>Morning</i>, and was also given the Back grant. Scott named Cape Colbeck and Colbeck Bay after him. Colbeck remained as master in the Wilson Line until 1912, when he was appointed marine superintendent in the London office. He received the Polar medal in 1914 and in 1926 was a founder member of the Honourable Company of Master Mariners.<br>
<br>On 7 December 1904 Colbeck married Edith, daughter of John Robinson, a cotton manufacturer. They had four sons, the eldest of whom, Captain W. R. Colbeck RNR, was surveyor with the British, Australian, and New Zealand Antarctic research expedition of 1929&#150;31, for which he received the Polar medal; Sir Douglas Mawson named the Colbeck archipelago after him. Colbeck died at his home, 51 Inchmery Road, Catford, London, on 18 October 1930, his exertions in the Antarctic having taken a considerable toll. He was buried at Hither Green, Lewisham.<br>
