<span class="headword">Wilson <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Wilson]</span>,  Rachel</span>  (1720&#150;1775), <span class="occ">Quaker minister</span>, was born in Highgate, Kendal, in Westmorland on 8 April 1720. In a family of girls she was the second child of John Wilson (1692&#150;1752), a tanner, and his wife, Deborah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wilson (1687&#150;1754), the daughter of a tanner of Stramongate, also in Kendal. By about 1739, when Rachel was eighteen, she was already acknowledged as a minister. On 18 February 1740 she married, in the Friends' meeting-house, Kendal, a fellow Quaker Isaac Wilson (1715&#150;1785), who was a shearman dyer in that town. They lived at 21 Stramongate, Kendal, and had seven daughters and three sons. Despite the demands of her household and a large family Rachel not only shared the ministry in Kendal and district but also travelled widely in the British Isles. A little journal, written in her &#145;scrawly hand and with extraordinarily phonetic spelling&#146;  (Somervell, 30), gives the bare details of a long journey she made in 1744&#150;5. Accompanied by her young friend Jane Rowlandson she visited many towns throughout England and Wales. After about nine months the two women returned home suddenly, possibly on hearing of an expected march southward by Charles Edward Stuart, the Jacobite Young Pretender. At all events, when his officers were passing through Kendal they were quartered at Isaac and Rachel's house.<br>
<br>It was probably in 1765 that Rachel held several public meetings in Bristol, one of which was attended by George Whitefield, who was much impressed. The next morning they met and conversed, and parted on terms of mutual respect. Rachel is best known, however, for a visit she made to American Friends. Having set sail in August 1768 the ship cast anchor in Delaware Bay on 14 October. Travelling almost entirely on horseback Rachel covered nearly 2000 miles through imperfectly cleared districts in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Virginia, North and South Carolina, New York, and New England. Her simple narrative vividly conveys the toil and occasional peril encountered in passing through dense forests, in fording deep rivers, and in many other hardships. When she arrived in Philadelphia in 1768 she was, according to a contemporary, &#145;a remarkably interesting and eloquent speaker &hellip; much admired by people of all classes&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Friend</span>). Among others she met Deborah Franklin, the wife of Benjamin Franklin, and the Franklin children.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1769 Rachel attended Philadelphia's yearly meeting. On rising to speak about herself she suddenly felt compelled to address words of encouragement to the prominent Quaker John Woolman, who was then deeply concerned about his impending departure for the West Indies. She also gave the elders solid advice; she compared them to &#145;the golden snuffers under the law&#146;, which helped the light to burn &#145;clearer and brighter&#146;, although &#145;some were so fond of snuffing, that they &hellip; wasted the life of the Candle, and had sometimes put it out&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bulletin of the Friends' Historical Society of Philadelphia</span>). On 20 May 1769 fifty-one students of Princeton University wrote to Rachel asking her to preach to them; the ensuing meeting was so crowded that many had to stand. She also visited Rhode Island and helped to settle a long-standing dispute which had brought discredit to the Society of Friends. Moses Brown (1738&#150;1836), the Quaker benefactor of Brown University, paid warm tribute to &#145;her wise and discreet management and influence&#146;  (Somervell, 62).<br>
<br>Rachel Wilson arrived back in England on 10 December 1769. In 1772 Woolman visited Rachel's family in Kendal during her absence, but he wrote to her on 30 August of that year. In 1774 her health began to fail although she could still attend a number of meetings. On 4 February 1775, while on a visit to London, she was taken seriously ill at the house of Richard Chester in Stoke Newington. She died there on 18 March. On 23 March a meeting was held in Devonshire House, after which she was buried at Bunhill Fields, London.<br>
