<span class="headword">Clitheroe <span class="st"> [Cliderhou]</span>,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1334), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, came of a family originating at Clitheroe, Lancashire. He held the nearby manor of Bailey, and had licence in 1330 to alienate it to the abbot and convent of Cockersand, for the provision of two chaplains to celebrate divine service daily, in the chapel of St John the Baptist at Bailey, for the souls of Robert and his parents, who are identified by Whitaker as Jordan de Cliderhou and his wife, Cicely. At his trial in the autumn of 1323 it was stated that Clitheroe had been a clerk of the king's chancery for thirty years. This strengthens the case for his identification with the Robert Cliderhou summoned as one of sixteen clerks of the council to the parliament which was called to meet at Lincoln in July 1312, but which actually met at Westminster in August. The trial also identified him as an escheator north of the Trent; he was appointed on 19 February 1315 and was succeeded by Robert Sapy on 27 September 1316. He was also probably the Robert Cliderhou empowered to examine and correct the assessment of the fifteenth in the city of York in September 1316. The name Robert Cliderhou occurs as that of a judicial commissioner of assize or oyer and terminer in various counties between 1310 and 1331, and a Robert Cliderhou was joint keeper of the bishopric of Worcester from 21 October 1313 to 17 February 1314, but it is not certain that these are all references to the same person.<br>
<br>Clitheroe was instituted as rector of Wigan on 22 September 1303; his death caused a new presentation to be made on 15 June 1334. The court of king's bench sat at Wigan in October and November 1323, in the aftermath of the rebellion of Thomas, earl of Lancaster. Jurors found Clitheroe guilty of sending, at his own expense, two well-mounted men-at-arms (one of them his son Adam) and four footmen, armed with swords, knives, and bows and arrows, to aid Lancaster against the king, and also of preaching publicly in his church at Wigan in support of the earl, calling his enterprise lawful and the king's unlawful, and promising to absolve from their sins those willing to go to the earl's aid, charges which he denied. He was committed to prison, and subsequently bailed, and he paid a fine of &pound;200. Later, in an undated petition attributed to Edward III's reign, he sought redress of grievances arising from these circumstances, but was told that nothing could be done because he had voluntarily agreed to the fine. The episode is a rare illustration of political intervention from the pulpit, and seems to need explanation, since even after his rebellion, Clitheroe continued in royal employment and protection, being still described as king's clerk, for example, in October 1330. One suggestion for the cause of Clitheroe's discontent is that in 1322 he was smarting over accusations made in 1320 that he had committed extensive peculation during his period as escheator.<br>
