<span class="headword">White,  Francis Buchanan White</span>  (1842&#150;1894), <span class="occ">botanist and entomologist</span>, was born at Perth on 20 March 1842, the eldest son of Francis Isaiah White, a well-known Perth physician active in the botanical societies of Edinburgh and London, and his wife, Lilias Anne Bartlet Buchanan. Francis Buchanan White (as he was known) was educated in Perth, first at the school attached to St Ninian's episcopal cathedral and later by a private tutor. He is said to have attended St Ninian's Cathedral as his church throughout his life, despite being a &#145;thorough-going evolutionist&#146; believing &#145;that, after all, evolution is but creation under a new name&#146;  (Coates).<br>
<br>In 1860 White entered the University of Edinburgh, whence he graduated MD in 1864, his thesis on the relations, analogies, and similitudes of insects and plants giving an indication of his early interest in botany. During his residence as a student in Edinburgh he met Margaret Juliet Corrie, daughter of Thomas Corrie (<i>d</i>. 1859), an Edinburgh banker. By the time of her marriage to White on 2 February 1866, both of Margaret's parents were dead, and she had received a substantial legacy. As a result, the couple spent nearly a year in Europe on their honeymoon, before returning to settle in Perth in December 1866. Free from the constraints of professional work, and possessed of &#145;a considerable competency&#146;  (Carrington), Buchanan White proceeded to devote his time entirely to the study of natural science. Although based at their home in Perth (Annat Lodge, purchased for the couple by White's father), almost every year the Whites spent several months in some other part of Scotland, the natural history of which White wished to study.<br>
<br>Throughout his life White was devoted to the study of the Lepidoptera, his contributions to the <span class="italic">Entomologist's Weekly Intelligencer</span> beginning as early as 1857. From 1869 onwards he also made a special study of the Hemiptera, acquiring specimens from all parts of the world. In botany he devoted much attention to local distribution, and to &#145;critical&#146; groups, such as the willows; it was his desire for extreme accuracy which delayed the publication of his <span class="italic">Flora of Perthshire</span> until after his death.<br>
<br>In 1867 White was the moving spirit in founding the Perthshire Society of Natural Science, of which he was the first president, from 1867 to 1872; until his death in 1894 White was always one of the society's officers&#151;president, secretary, or editor. His communications to the society, many of which appeared in its <span class="italic">Proceedings and Transactions</span>, number over a hundred, and the society's museum was developed along the lines expounded in his presidential addresses. In 1871 he induced the society to establish the <span class="italic">Scottish Naturalist</span>, a journal which soon achieved an independent existence. White himself edited it from 1871 until 1882.<br>
<br>White, who had great powers of endurance as a mountaineer and was very fond of alpine plants, also initiated the Perthshire Mountain Club as an offshoot from the Society of Natural Science, and in 1874 he was one of the founders of the Cryptogamic Society of Scotland, of which he acted as secretary. He was one of the first to recognize the need for co-operation among local natural history societies, and, acting on this conviction, he brought about the East of Scotland Union of Naturalists' Societies, over which he presided at its first meeting, which was held at Dundee in 1884. One of White's most distinguished achievements was his pioneer description in 1872 of the natural divisions of Scotland, the &#145;faunal areas&#146;, later taken up by Harvie-Brown in his well-known series of <span class="roman">Scottish Vertebrate Faunas</span> (1887&#150;1906) and which have remained the basis for all really critical work on Scottish natural history ever since.<br>
<br>White's wider writings included articles on cockroaches, earwigs, ants, bees, locusts, and grasshoppers in <span class="italic">Science for All</span> (vols. 3&#150;5), the &#145;Report on pelagic Hemiptera&#146; collected by HMS <i>Challenger</i>  (<span class="italic">Reports</span> of the <i>Challenger</i> expedition, vol. 7, 1883) and a revision of the British willows in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Linnean Society</span> for 1890. His separate publications were <span class="italic">Fauna Perthensis-Lepidoptera</span> (1871), a small quarto monograph intended as the first of a series, but not continued, and <span class="italic">The Flora of Perthshire</span> (1898), edited after his death by his friend Professor Trail. White joined the Entomological Society of London in 1868 and the Linnean Society in 1873, and was a member of several other scientific societies both at home and abroad.<br>
<br>White died at Annat Lodge on 3 December 1894, survived by his wife, two sons and seven daughters. His various obituaries used words such as amiable, genial, entertaining, patient, gentle, courteous, modest, and retiring, but according to at least one writer he was capable of &#145;bitter sarcasm&#146; when roused. &#145;His stalwart figure in his accustomed grey kilt, was one of great power and endurance, little short of perfect physical training enabling one to keep pace with him in those long mountain rambles&#146;  (Carrington). In all he was very much an outdoor man, who attended and led over a hundred field outings organized by the Perthshire Society; he was also skip of Scone and Perth Curling Club. He was buried in Wellshill cemetery, Perth. A bronze mural memorial to him was erected in Perth Museum and a stained-glass window in his honour was installed in St Ninian's Cathedral. In 1994, the centenary of his death, a two-day international conference was held in Perth Museum to commemorate the achievements of one of Scotland's foremost pioneer naturalists. White's greatest memorial, however, lies in his establishment of the national journal, the much-loved and highly respected <span class="italic">Scottish Naturalist</span>, which is still thriving some 130 years later.<br>
