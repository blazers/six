<span class="headword">Whitaker,  Edward William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1752, <em>d.</em> 1818), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and charity administrator</span>, was baptized on 26 January 1752 at St Martin Outwich, London, the son of William Whitaker of London and of Sandgates, Chertsey, Surrey, serjeant-at-law, and his wife, Isabella Rebecca North. He spent some of his early life in the household of a dissenter; nevertheless he matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 2 April 1773 as a gentleman commoner, and graduated BA on 4 February 1777.<br>
<br>Following ordination Whitaker's main income originated from his livings. He was instituted to the rectory of St John the Baptist, Clerkenwell, in 1778 and afterwards held the rectory of St Mildred, Bread Street, in the City of London. From 1783 he was rector of St Mary de Castro and All Saints', Canterbury, a living which he held until his death. On 11 May of the following year he married Mary Morgan at St George's, Hanover Square, London, and their first child, Edward John, was born in 1786. Between 1786 and 1787 Whitaker taught at the King's School, Canterbury, and for many years the family lived at Thorpe, near Egham, Surrey, where Whitaker kept a school. Other energies went into charitable good works. In the early years of the nineteenth century he established a charity to provide an &#145;Asylum for Male and Female Outcasts&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 76/1.424), later renamed the Refuge for the Destitute. The institution began by providing out-relief, and then &#145;a place of refuge for persons discharged from prisons, or the hulks, unfortunate and deserted females, and others, who from loss of character, or extreme indigence&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Short Account</span>, 2) could not support themselves. A building on Cuper's Bridge, Lambeth, was acquired and the first two inmates admitted on 12 November 1806. A pamphlet, probably published in 1807, named Prince Frederick, duke of York, as president, with Whitaker as joint treasurer, and stated that of 275 applicants 119 had been admitted, 67 relieved out of house, and 89 rejected, and 64 were at present in the refuge.<br>
<br>Whitaker was also a productive and varied author. He joined in the polemical warfare against Joseph Priestley's Unitarianism with his <span class="italic">Four dialogues on the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, taught throughout the scriptures, and on other points which have of late been subjects of &hellip; discussion</span> (1786) and followed it with <span class="italic">A letter to the Reverend Dr Priestley, on his appeal to the ecclesiastical writers of the first centuries</span>, which contained trinitarian references drawn from the apostles and the fathers. The <span class="italic">Sermons on Education</span> (1788) were prompted by his intention of taking pupils; they insisted that each boy must receive a thorough grounding in the principles of Christianity. Whitaker had an incurable interest in prophetic literature. His <span class="italic">A general and connected view of the prophecies relating to the times of the gentiles, delivered by our blessed saviour, the prophet David, and the apostles Paul and John; with a brief account of their accomplishment to the present age</span> (1795) offers proof of real learning. It was, Whitaker unblushingly admitted, inspired by reading Edward Gibbon on the predictions of the book of <span class="roman">Revelation</span>. <span class="italic">The Manual of Prophecy</span> (1808) was a collection of &#145;predictions relating to that restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all His holy Prophets since the world began&#146;  (p. 3). Whitaker was always strongly anti-Romanist, insisting against other commentators that the Antichrist appeared exclusively in papal guise. His most substantial book was <span class="italic">An Abridgement of Universal History</span> (1817), in four volumes; the author proceeded on the basis that &#145;the moral government of the world is sufficiently evinced by the facts of history&#146;  (p. v) and included a remarkable amount of non-European material. Whitaker died, at Bread Street Hill, London, on 14 October 1818.<br>
