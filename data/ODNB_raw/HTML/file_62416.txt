<span class="headword">Berkenhead,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1648, <em>d.</em> 1701), <span class="occ">Jacobite spy</span>, was apparently born at Northwich in Cheshire and baptized there in Witton Chapel on 3 April 1648. His parents were Randolph Berkenhead, the earl of Derby's bailiff in Northwich, and his wife, Elizabeth Harcourt, one of the Harcourts of Wincham, near Northwich. His uncle was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2455/', "Sir John Birkenhead")</script>. The family were royalists and prospered after the Restoration. In February 1676 Berkenhead was given a job in the customs, first as a landwaiter at Southampton and then, in February 1688, as surveyor at Dover. While at Southampton he married, about 1678, Frances Harwood. They had four children, only one of whom, Elizabeth, survived into adulthood. Frances herself is reported as having been dead &#145;some years&#146; by 1696  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; Ailesbury</span>, 2.396).<br>
<br>After the revolution of 1688 Berkenhead, though protestant, remained loyal to James II and used his position at Dover to help the first Jacobites cross secretly to France. He was caught and dismissed in May 1690 but the earl of Ailesbury then gave him the more important task of handling Jacobite correspondence with St Germain and establishing a route by which Jacobite messages and travellers could pass safely between London and the continent. A farm on Romney Marsh in Kent, tenanted by James Hunt, was the main staging post on the route. From the end of 1692 Berkenhead was continually ranging over the English section of the route, conveying letters and escorting important Jacobite travellers. From about the same time he also worked for the French as a naval spy, receiving his instructions direct from navy minister Pontchartrain.<br>
<br>Three or four times a year Berkenhead visited St Germain, either on escort or courier duty or for consultations with his superiors at the exiled court. He met James, the deposed king, and his queen, Mary of Modena, on many occasions and was well known to Lord Melfort and his secretary David Nairne. When William III's Queen Mary died in December 1694 it was Berkenhead who conveyed the news to St Germain. Having served as captain of a troop of the Southampton trained band, Berkenhead was usually called Captain Berkenhead. He also had several aliases. The earliest was South, corresponding to Melfort's North. Afterwards he used East, West, Baker, and Fish, and latterly, from mid-1695 on, Steel. For his services St Germain paid him an annual salary of &pound;100 plus expenses.<br>
<br>Over the winter of 1695&#150;6 when a combined English Jacobite rising and French invasion was being planned, Berkenhead's charges included Sir George Barclay, whom James II had commissioned to raise the Jacobites, and the duke of Berwick, James II's illegitimate son, who came over to encourage the rebels. Barclay was also plotting to assassinate William III. During the crackdown following the discovery of this plot Berkenhead was arrested and imprisoned in Newgate in April 1696. He escaped at the end of August after inviting the keeper to supper and drugging his wine. Having made his way via the Romney Marsh farm to France, he returned with French sailors the next day, Saturday 30 October, and kidnapped Farmer Hunt, who had turned anti-Jacobite informer.<br>
<br>In France James rewarded the now-exiled Berkenhead by appointing him his clerk of the kitchen in February 1697. In April 1701 Berkenhead was accompanying James and Mary to the spa town of Bourbon-Lancy when he was taken ill at Montargis. Having been put to bed in the royal castle, he converted to Roman Catholicism and died shortly after, on 14 April 1701 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>; he was buried in the chapel of the town cemetery the following day.<br>
