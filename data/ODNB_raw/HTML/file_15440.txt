<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Keppel,  Frederick</span>  (1729&#150;1777), <span class="occ">bishop of Exeter</span>, was born on 30 January 1729, the fourth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15443/', "William Anne Keppel, second earl of Albemarle (1702&#150;1754)")</script>, and his wife, Anne (1703&#150;1789), daughter of Charles Lennox, first duke of Richmond. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15441/', "George Keppel, third earl of Albemarle")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15439/', "Augustus Keppel, Viscount Keppel")</script>, were his brothers. He was educated at Westminster School and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated BA in 1752, MA in 1754, and DD by diploma on 19 October 1762. One of fifteen children, Keppel sought a career in the church rather than following his brothers into the armed forces and was ordained in February 1753. He married, on 13 September 1758, Laura (1734&#150;1813), eldest natural daughter of Sir Edward Walpole, who in 1784 left her Lacy House, Isleworth, and most of his fortune. The marriage produced one son and three daughters.<br>
<br>Though regarded as an able preacher, Keppel's rise in the church probably owed more to the royal connections of his eldest brother, the third earl of Albemarle, who was a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the duke of Cumberland and a favourite of George II. Keppel's career shows that the support of the duke of Newcastle was not always necessary to success in the mid-eighteenth-century church. He was a chaplain-in-ordinary to both George II and George III, and was appointed by the former to a canonry at Windsor (19 April 1754), despite Newcastle's objection that he was too young. Through his wife Keppel also had close connections to the Walpoles and the Waldegraves.<br>
<br>Keppel's father-in-law, Sir Edward Walpole, wrote to William Pitt the elder in August 1761, asking whether it was &#145;agreeable to him to make Mr. Keppel a bishop at this juncture&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of William Pitt</span>, 2.134&#150;5), and although this application was unsuccessful he was consecrated bishop of Exeter on 8 November 1762. Though it was rumoured that the preferment was bestowed upon him on account of Albemarle's capture of Havana, Horace Walpole, his uncle by marriage, maintained that the see was promised to him the day before the news came. He also held <i>in commendam</i> the archdeaconry of Exeter and a prebendal stall in that cathedral, and obtained the promise of translation to the more lucrative bishopric of Salisbury on the next vacancy. In 1765 he relinquished this promise for the deanery of Windsor, to which he was appointed, with the registrarship of the Order of the Garter. Augustus Hervey commented, &#145;all things are crowded into three or four people's pockets&#146;  (Smith, 3.91).<br>
<br>Despite his pluralism, Keppel was an attentive diocesan who gained a reputation for generosity. In 1764 he confirmed almost 24,000 on his first visitation tour. He spent large sums of money improving the episcopal palace at Exeter and in relieving the needs of the poorer clergy in his diocese. Polwhele praised his distribution of patronage, and the philologist Jonathan Toup was among those he promoted.<br>
<br>Keppel was an active member of the House of Lords, especially through 1770, generally following the lead of his brothers, who were allied with the Rockingham whigs from 1765. Keppel thus spent most of his parliamentary career in opposition. Though he seldom spoke, he subscribed to five protests between 1767 and 1775, and often voted against the ministry. In March 1776 he preached a sermon before George III advocating peace with America, and on his deathbed he &#145;thanked God that he had not given one vote for shedding American blood&#146;  (<span class="italic">Last Journals of Horace Walpole</span>, 2.86). He died at the deanery, Windsor, on 27 December 1777 of &#145;dropsy of the stomach&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Chronicle</span>) and was buried on 2 January 1778 in St George's Chapel, Windsor. Keppel published little: a set of verses as part of his university's collection of poems on the death of the prince of Wales in 1751 and two sermons. Historiographically, however, he made a major contribution to the study of his era by copying and editing the manuscript memoir of the second Earl Waldegrave, which was entrusted to him by his sister-in-law. It was subsequently published in 1821.<br>
