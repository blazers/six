<span class="headword">Rainbow,  Bernarr Joseph George</span>  (1914&#150;1998), <span class="occ">historian of music education</span>, was born on 2 October 1914 at 83 Silverthorne Road, Battersea, London, the only child of Ephraim James Rainbow (1888&#150;1983) and his wife, Nellie Neal (1889&#150;1965). His father was a cabinet-maker at Buckingham Palace and later curator of pictures at Hampton Court, so Rainbow grew up with a strong awareness of tradition through historic places and people. His father also was a keen amateur musician who played the cornet in brass bands and the trumpet in orchestras.<br>
<br>After the family moved to Clapham, Rainbow became a church chorister and was intrigued by watching the organist play; he also loved to explore London with his mother. Another move took him to Rutlish School, Merton, and while still there he became organist and choirmaster at St James's Church; he later held similar posts at St Mary's, East Molesey, and St Andrew's, Wimbledon. He also gave piano recitals, admired for their maturity, and was active in local theatre. He formed the Merton Players' Guild, wrote a morality play for the group, and also directed and painted scenery.<br>
<br>In 1932 the family moved to Hampton Court. Rainbow was subsequently a part-time student at Trinity College of Music, while earning a living as a civil servant in the map branch of the Land Registry. The war interrupted his studies; he served with the army in north Africa and Italy.<br>
<br>On 9 August 1941 Rainbow married Olive Grace Still (1915&#150;1996), a secretary, at the church of St Mary the Virgin, Merton; he composed the music for the service himself. In April 1944 he was discharged from the army on medical grounds after four years' service. In the following September he became organist of the parish church of All Saints, High Wycombe, and a few months later he was appointed senior music master at the Royal Grammar School there.<br>
<br>Rainbow made a considerable impact at High Wycombe by putting on concerts at the parish church and starting a week-long annual festival in 1946. In 1950 Benjamin Britten, who had started his own Aldeburgh Festival in 1948, encouraged him by writing the preface to the programme book. Rainbow's pupils won awards, and representatives from thirty local choirs joined in Handel's <span class="italic">Messiah</span>. Rainbow conducted the High Wycombe String Orchestra and was the soloist in his own piano concerto, which has not survived. In 1951 his parish church choir was chosen to sing evensong in the festival church on the new South Bank site in London.<br>
<br>At this stage Rainbow began to be concerned about the low quality of music teaching in schools nationally. So in 1952 he took the post of director of music at the College of St Mark and St John, Chelsea, the Church of England training college for teachers. He was interested in new initiatives in music education, and put together a team of lecturers who would &#145;revolutionise the country's music education&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>), encouraging children's improvisations and compositions. When the college moved to Plymouth in 1972, Rainbow decided to remain in London and became head of music at Gypsy Hill College (later Kingston University); he retired from there in 1978.<br>
<br>It was at Chelsea that Rainbow increasingly became a scholar and researcher. He had already acquired several music diplomas, but went on to gain three postgraduate degrees at the University of Leicester. His earlier publications, such as <span class="italic">Music in the Classroom</span> (1956) and the <span class="italic">Handbook for Music Teachers</span> (1964), were practical aids for teachers, but his most influential books were historical. His discovery of papers about John Pyke Hullah, a nineteenth-century predecessor at the College of St Mark and St John, aroused his interest in the social history of music education between 1800 and 1860 and led to <span class="italic">The Land without Music</span> (1967), in which he gave the lie to the German description of Britain. <span class="italic">The Choral Revival in the Anglican Church, 1839&#150;1872</span> (1970) explored the movement to improve standards in church music, and gained Rainbow his doctorate from the University of Leicester. <span class="italic">Music in Educational Thought and Practice</span> (1989) was his most substantial book, covering his subject from the ancient Greeks to the mid-1980s. Rainbow also edited some twenty-five separate primers from originals in various languages as <span class="roman">Classic Texts in Music Education</span>, a series which promised to be a major landmark.<br>
<br>In 1978 Rainbow established the Curwen Institute to promote the work of John Curwen, the proponent of tonic sol-fa (whose brief biography Rainbow published in 1980). In the last two years of his life he became founder president of the Campaign for the Defence of the Traditional Cathedral Choir (opposing the introduction of girls into cathedral choirs) and established the Bernarr Rainbow award for school music teachers, subsequently supported by the Bernarr Rainbow Trust. His distinguished record was acknowledged when he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in 1994 and made an honorary fellow of Trinity College of Music in the following year. The history of music education was brought alive by the detailed research that Rainbow undertook in order to communicate both his vivid awareness of the past and his concern for the present. He had no children, and died from cancer on 17 March 1998 at the Princess Alice Hospice, Esher, Surrey, two years after his wife's death. He was cremated at Mortlake on 25 March.<br>
