<span class="headword">Jeune <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Stewart-Mackenzie <em>other married name </em>Stanley]</span>,  (Susan Elizabeth) Mary</span>, Lady St Helier  (1845&#150;1931), <span class="occ">hostess</span>, was born in Munich, Bavaria, on 18 May 1845, the eldest of the three children of Keith William Stewart-Mackenzie (1818&#150;1881) of Seaforth, army officer, and his first wife, Hannah Charlotte Hope-Vere (<i>d</i>. 1868). Her family was connected to the earls of Galloway and Hopetoun, the marquess of Ely, and the duke of Wellington; her grandmother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26521/', "Mary Elizabeth Frederica Stewart-Mackenzie")</script> was the chief of the Clan Mackenzie. Her younger sister Julia Charlotte Sophia (1846&#150;1937) was married successively to the ninth marquess of Tweeddale, the financier Sir John Rose, first baronet, and the politician Sir William Eden Evans-Gordon. She was brought up quietly in a house near Brahan Castle (her grandmother's home) in the highlands, where the austerity of the Free Church of Scotland to which her family belonged was mitigated by the persistence of local beliefs in the supernatural and by the regular arrival of visitors to her aunt, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50780/', "Louisa Baring, Lady Ashburton")</script>, and her grandmother, to whom Mary became &#145;more or less a companion-secretary&#146;  (St Helier, <span class="italic">Memories of fifty years</span>, 22) at the age of fifteen. Hospitality was extended widely, to visitors as disparate as W. E. Gladstone, Robert Browning, J. T. Delane of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, Landseer, and the explorer Joseph Wolff.<br>
<br>Mary Stewart-Mackenzie was presented at court in June 1864 and enjoyed the social life of a d&eacute;butante until she married, on 15 August 1871, Lieutenant-Colonel the Hon. John Constantine Stanley (1837&#150;1878), second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26267/', "Edward John Stanley, second Baron Stanley of Alderley")</script>. Stanley had been educated at Harrow School, served in the Crimea, as ADC to Lord Canning while he was governor-general of India, and then in Canada. The Stanleys of Alderley were a famously contentious family, and Mary and John Stanley added political disagreement (they were Conservatives) to the domestic mix. They had two daughters, Madeline, (<i>b</i>. 1876) and Osma Mary Dorothy (<i>b</i>. 1877), but Stanley, whose health had been ruined in India, died on 23 April 1878. It was perhaps under the influence of her formidable mother-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26271/', "Henrietta Maria Stanley, Lady Stanley of Alderley")</script>, that Mary Stanley took her first steps in organized philanthropy, by becoming honorary secretary of the Princess Helena College and serving on the ladies' committee for the relief of sick and wounded Turkish soldiers during the Russo-Turkish war of 1877&#150;8. It was also during these years of marriage and widowhood that she began to develop her extensive social network, entertaining in London at 39 Wimpole Street and later at Putney. Prominent among her political guests at this time were the Conservative &#145;Fourth Party&#146;, led by Lord Randolph Churchill; it was at her table that Churchill claimed he &#145;Forgot Goschen&#146; when resigning as chancellor of the exchequer in 1886. But her guests were not all political: in an intimation of things to come, Oscar Wilde was a regular visitor for a time, recruiting her as an author for his magazine, <span class="italic">The Woman's World</span>, and using her connections to garner support for the project.<br>
<br>After three years of widowhood, on 17 August 1881 Mary Stanley married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34188/', "Francis Henry Jeune (1843&#150;1905)")</script>, at that time a rising barrister; their son, Christian, was born the following year. Having settled at 79 Harley Street (with a country house, Arlington Manor, near Newbury), she rapidly became one of the more important London hostesses. &#145;Society&#146; had been largely restricted to the aristocratic &eacute;lite; Mrs Jeune (Lady Jeune from 1891) was instrumental in widening its scope to include persons of talent, whatever their social background: not only aristocrats, politicians, and philanthropists but also artists, actors, and literary men and women were to be found at her dining table. The young Winston Churchill cultivated Lady Jeune, who helped persuade the military authorities to allow him to go to the war in the Sudan in 1898; the novelist Thomas Hardy became a close family friend and made Lady Jeune's house his London base; Arthur Conan Doyle considered her lunch parties to be &#145;quite one of the outstanding institutions of London&#146;  (Conan Doyle, <span class="italic">Memories and Adventures</span>, 232&#150;3); Ida B. Wells, the African&#150;American civil rights activist&#151;in Britain on an anti-lynching campaign&#151;called on her at Arlington Manor, and encouraged her to hold a drawing-room meeting on the subject. Although a committed Conservative (and member of the Primrose League), she entertained across party lines, except during the difficult years of the home rule crisis, when &#145;it would have been quite impossible to have asked any leading man of the Liberal party to meet anyone except his own political friends&#146;  (St Helier, <span class="italic">Memories of Fifty Years</span>, 254). Lady Jeune's passion for &#145;lion-hunting&#146; (as the collection of celebrity scalps was known) was such that an apocryphal story did the rounds: a cannibal, about to cook a European traveller, recognized his potential meal as a former fellow guest of Lady Jeune's and offered him hospitality instead.<br>
<br>Mary Jeune did not confine herself to entertaining, however. Her interest in social problems led her to seek practical solutions, from the provision of boots and seaside holidays, to her contribution to the commission on the housing of the poor in the notorious &#145;Old Nichol&#146; area on the border of Bethnal Green and Shoreditch. Drawn in by the controversy over W. T. Stead's articles in the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> entitled &#145;Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon&#146;, she began to write regularly&#151;and under her own name&#151;for the periodical press. Her contributions to such periodicals as the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span>, the <span class="italic">National Review</span>, and the <span class="italic">North American Review</span> concentrated on the two fields she knew best: the changing <i>mores</i> of aristocratic society in London and interventions in debates on the welfare of women and children. On both topics she expressed qualified conservative views: &#145;Society&#146; was going to the dogs, but she admitted the many conveniences and advances of modern life; the children of the poor needed to be provided with meals and holidays in the countryside, but attempts to prevent their exploitation in theatres were misguided; and upper-class women should embrace their position as wives, mothers, and daughters without seeking the unnecessary excitements of careers or political power&#151;although she admitted the capacity of middle-class women to engage in careers.<br>
<br>This was, of course, all deeply ironic, given that Mary Jeune had been personally responsible for introducing many of the &#145;new people&#146; into society, and that she was taking full advantage of her public voice. She was not a signatory to the 1889 anti-suffrage petition in the <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span>, despite the support of many of her closest friends and relations; instead, she was involved in the counter-petition raised by a committee headed by Millicent Fawcett. Her views on the suffrage question were, however, moderate: although she acknowledged that &#145;logically, perhaps, the refusal to give them the Parliamentary franchise is indefensible&#146;, she doubted whether &#145;the majority of women in this country are very anxious to acquire it&#146;  (St Helier, <span class="italic">Memories of Fifty Years</span>, 342). Many of her articles were collected and published as <span class="italic">Lesser Questions</span> in 1894.<br>
<br>Lady Jeune's only son, an officer in the Grenadier Guards, died from enteric fever in India in August 1904. Sir Francis Jeune resigned his judicial offices in January 1905 and the following month was raised to the peerage as Baron St Helier, only to die within a matter of weeks. Lady St Helier, as she now became, sold Arlington Manor, and built a new house (The Poplars) at Cold Ash near Newbury, and declared her intention of moving to Shoreditch; if she did so, the experiment was short-lived, for she was soon receiving guests again at her new home at 52 Portland Place. It was here that she welcomed Edith Wharton, who found her &#145;a born &#147;entertainer&#148; according to the traditional London idea, which regarded &hellip; the act of fighting one's way through a struggling crowd of celebrities as the finest expression of social intercourse&#146;  (Wharton, <span class="italic">Backward Glance</span>, 213&#150;16); here, too, she introduced Winston Churchill to his future wife, her great-niece, Clementine Hozier, and hosted their wedding reception. In 1909 she published her <span class="italic">Memories of Fifty Years</span>.<br>
<br>In later life Lady St Helier's political and philanthropic interests found new outlets in official life: in 1910 she was appointed an alderman on the London county council, and co-opted onto the education committee. She served continuously until 1927, taking a particular interest in questions of housing and the promotion of garden suburbs. The St Helier estate in Morden, Surrey, was named after her. She was appointed DBE in 1925.<br>
<br>Lady St Helier died at 52 Portland Place, London, on 25 January 1931, and was buried with her second husband at Chieveley, Berkshire. A woman of her prominence inevitably had her detractors (Winston Churchill thought that his mother disliked her; Oscar Wilde's <i>alter ego</i>, Esm&eacute; Amarinth, makes a waspish remark about her in <span class="italic">The Green Carnation</span>), but they were outnumbered by her admirers. For, despite her passion for &#145;lion-hunting&#146;, her potential critics were disarmed by her personal charm, her &#145;vigorous personality&#146; and &#145;generous and independent character&#146;  (Wharton, <span class="italic">Backward Glance</span>, 214).<br>
