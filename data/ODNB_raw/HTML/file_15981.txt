<span class="headword">Landsborough <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>McLandsborough]</span>,  David</span>  (1779&#150;1854), <span class="occ">Free Church of Scotland minister and naturalist</span>, was born on 11 August 1779 in Dalry, Glenkens, Kirkcudbrightshire, the only son and eldest of four children of John McLandsborough and Isabel Hugan. He was educated at the parish school and Dumfries Academy, before entering Edinburgh University in 1798. Although reading divinity, he also attended lectures in botany, anatomy, chemistry, and surgery. At university, he dropped &#145;Mc&#146; from his surname, proclaiming it &#145;long enough&#146; without  (Rutherford, 1980, 4). Through his musical skills he became known to metaphysician Thomas Brown and to the landscape-painter John Thompson (1778&#150;1840), the latter of whom instilled in Landsborough a taste for painting. From Edinburgh Landsborough became tutor to Sir John Hay of King's Meadows, Tweedside, and then to the family of Lord Glenlee, of Barskimming, Ayrshire. He was licensed to the ministry of the Church of Scotland in 1808, and in September 1811 was ordained minister to the parish of Stevenston, Ayrshire. In addition to his clerical duties and his daily readings in Latin, Greek, Hebrew, French, or Italian, he soon began studies of the natural history of his parish and nearby Arran. It is possible that his field studies on the Ayrshire coast were encouraged by an Edinburgh meeting with John Fleming (author of <span class="italic">A History of British Animals</span>), who had requested some &#145;new&#146; crabs. In this period, Landsborough also began cultivating the Stevenston manse garden, which he walled higher for greater shelter.<br>
<br>In 1817 Landsborough married Margaret (1797/8&#150;1834), daughter of James McLeish of Port Glasgow; the couple later had four sons and three daughters, including the explorer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15982/', "William Landsborough (1825&#150;1886)")</script>. Over the years his wife's health deteriorated, and she died in November 1834, aged thirty-six. It was a blow &#145;he never fully overcame, he laid his flute aside till his seventies and remembered the day every year&#146;  (Rutherford, 1980).<br>
<br>Landsborough's studies in Arran led to a first publication, <span class="italic">Arran, a Poem in Six Cantos</span> (1828); it was republished in 1847 with field-work accounts. He made collections of flowering plants but these were soon extended to embrace algae, lichens, fungi, and mosses. He contributed much material and many botanical records to works such as W. H. Harvey's <span class="italic">Phycologia Britannica</span>. His discovery of new or previously unreported marine animals (many since reassessed taxonomically) associated him with both John Fleming and George Johnston (1797&#150;1855), although he may never have met the latter in person. For many years, Landsborough recorded the daily weather, migration movements, and flowering periods; he studied also land Mollusca and fossil plants of the Ayrshire coalfield. He published at least seven papers before 1843 in different journals, covering topics such as zoophyte phosphorescence, birds, dredging, the Mollusca of Whiting Bay, and geological deposits at Stevenston and Largs. His garden flourished with exotic plants rare for Scotland. In 1837 he produced the Stevenston parish account (48 pages), which was judged one of the best contributions to the <span class="italic">New [Second] Statistical Account [of Scotland]</span> and led to his assisting other ministers with the natural history sections and acquiring the sobriquet &#145;the Ayrshire Naturalist&#146;  (Rutherford, 1980).<br>
<br>In the Scottish church Disruption of spring 1843 Landsborough joined the Free Kirk, becoming minister at Saltcoats and losing his previous church, manse, and beloved garden. These changes reduced his income from &pound;350 to &pound;150 per year, and limited his natural history studies. Between about 1847 and 1853, under his direction, his daughters made and sold about 400 varying sets of algae, with varying content, labels, title-pages, and geographical origin. Entitled <span class="italic">Treasures of the Deep, or, Specimens of Scottish Sea-Weeds</span>, they are often referred to as the &#145;Ayrshire Albums&#146;. Sold at bazaars and privately for discharge of the manse debts and unkeep and to support churches and schools, they retailed when bound at 15<i>s</i>. per album; most were probably formed of between thirty-eight and sixty-three specimens. These funds were augmented by income from lectures which Landsborough gave throughout Britain, and by annual collections in church. Creation of albums and time spent lecturing represented considerable effort by the Landsborough family; both the Saltcoats Free Kirk and other churches benefited considerably.<br>
<br>By the early 1840s, the Landsborough family was actively exploring Arran and its rich shores; Landsborough also dredged in the Firth of Clyde with James Smith of Jordanhill. His experiences led to a series of papers in the <span class="italic">Christian Treasury</span> during 1845; these were included in his enlarged and revised <span class="italic">Arran; a Poem; and Excursions to Arran</span> in 1847. This book sold well, resulting in a further (1851 [1852]) edition which suffered chaotic reorganization through removal of the 1828 poem and Landsborough's overprovision of replacement text. In his preface to the 1847 edition Landsborough described the late 1840s as &#145;the very busiest period of my professional life&#146;. He was invited by Lovell Reeve to write a <span class="italic">Popular History of British Seaweeds</span>: the work was well received, achieving three editions (1849; 1851; 1857), and as a result Landsborough was commissioned to prepare a <span class="italic">Popular History of British Zoophytes or Corallines</span> (1852). He was elected associate of the Linnean Society in 1849, and in the following year was instrumental in establishing the Ayrshire Naturalists' Club, of which he was the first president.<br>
<br>Comparatively well-travelled, Landsborough visited most parts of Scotland and Ireland on religious duties, as well as spending four months on supply ministry in Gibraltar in 1842. In 1852, in his seventies, he visited Gibraltar and Tangier, returning via the Balearic Islands, Italy, and France. During a cholera epidemic in Ayrshire in 1854 Landsborough was involved in comforting the sick and dying and himself contracted the disease; he died after a very brief illness at Saltcoats, on 12 September 1854, and was buried in a plague pit in the churchyard of Stevenston High Kirk, Ardrossan. The Ayrshire Naturalists' Club effectively died with him.<br>
