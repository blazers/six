</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Behrens, Sir  Jacob</span>  (1806&#150;1889), <span class="occ">textile merchant</span>, was born on 20 November 1806, one of the sons of Nathan Behrens (<i>d</i>. 1842), a Jewish merchant, and Clara Hahn, daughter of a Hamburg silk merchant, at Pyrmont, in the small German principality of Waldeck between Hanover and Westphalia. The Behrens family had for generations traded as textile merchants. At the end of the Napoleonic wars the family moved to Hamburg. Jacob was educated by a family tutor, a theological student of the Reformed church, aided by an &eacute;migr&eacute; Jesuit abb&eacute; who provided instruction in the French language, and by a shipwrecked Scottish sailor who taught English. A competent teacher of mathematics was also employed. It is recorded that Jacob was fluent in several languages.<br>
<br>Jacob joined his father's firm in Hamburg, assisting with the merchanting activity of the family, and taking control of the declining business in 1826. He travelled widely. His first crossing to England was in 1832, on board a paddle steamer from Hamburg to Hull. He returned in 1833 in order to attempt to persuade Thomas Clapham, a Leeds merchant with whom he traded, to adopt a different finish to the goods being supplied, and to pack them in small bales. He failed, and a visit the following year showed little more success. In 1834 he settled in Leeds, renting a small warehouse, and thus establishing his own firm of Jacob Behrens. This enabled him to finish cloth himself according to the requirements of his German market. In due course Behrens began to sell directly to Germany on his own account and not via the Hamburg business. The Leeds firm expanded rapidly, and two younger brothers, Louis and Rudolf, joined him in 1837, Louis acting as the business's traveller in Germany.<br>
<br>Jacob Behrens helped to pioneer the transition of merchanting from Leeds to Bradford, which was to become the dominant mercantile centre for the wool textile industry. The move brought him closer to his main suppliers and set him further on the path to a major position in the textile merchanting field. In 1840 Louis set up a branch of the business in Manchester to trade in cotton goods. He was soon joined by another brother, Edward. Their father, Nathan, died in 1842, shaken by a disastrous fire at his Hamburg premises, though the firm's stocks escaped its ravages. Subsequently, the firm set up branches in Manchester, London, Glasgow, Calcutta, and Shanghai.<br>
<br>In 1844 Jacob Behrens married Dorothea Hohenemser (<i>d</i>. 1884), daughter of a wealthy Jewish family from the south-west of Germany. They had five daughters, Wilhelmina, Clara, Julia, Louisa, and Rosa Emily, and four sons, Gustav (1846&#150;1936), Charles (1848&#150;1925), Fred (1849&#150;1933), and Harry (1854&#150;1921). His brother Rudolf retired from the business in 1864, and Edward died in 1866. In 1870 Louis and his four sons started their own business. The following year Gustav entered into partnership with Jacob, followed in due course by the other three sons. Gustav remained a partner for sixty-five years, becoming a director of the Midland Railway for forty-five years and helping to establish the Hall&eacute; Concert Society in Manchester.<br>
<br>By the time of his marriage Jacob Behrens was firmly established in the Bradford trade and making his mark as an important member of the large local merchant community. He gained a reputation as a hardworking but cautious businessman, researching the trade and becoming extremely knowledgeable about its operation. That knowledge developed through the rest of his life, and he was often called upon for advice and information. He represented Bradford in negotiations about commercial conditions and foreign tariffs, and he provided regular commercial advice to the government. He helped to form the very influential Bradford chamber of commerce, serving as its vice-president for seven years, and its president for six. He was chairman of its important tariff committee for nearly forty years. In 1860 he advised the government about the commercial treaty with France, and became involved in negotiations for its creation. At various times in the later nineteenth century he helped to provide statistical information on the industry. He was reputed to be an avid reader of the government blue books. He was one of the founders of the Association of Chambers of Commerce, and it was pressure from him that helped in the formation of the commercial department of the Foreign Office in 1872. In 1882 he was knighted for his services to commerce.<br>
<br>Behrens's business specialized in the export of textiles to Germany. He traded with Belgium, the Netherlands, and Italy, and took the opportunity to trade with Japan when that market began to open up from the 1850s. His goods also found their way into China. He was a strong believer in the virtues of free trade. It was said that, initially, he found it difficult to be accepted in Bradford society. But it is clear that he gradually gained a great deal of respect. He gave much time to local issues and was a strong supporter of local charities. He campaigned for the improvement of postal services. He took a particular interest in the Bradford Eye and Ear Hospital.<br>
<br>Sir Jacob Behrens died at the Imperial Hotel, Torquay, on 22 April 1889, five years after his wife, and following a long period of failing health; he was buried at Undercliff cemetery, Bradford, on 26 April. The tribute to him from Bradford chamber of commerce remarked: &#145;He seemed to exist only to be of service to his fellow man.&#146; The local newspaper, the <span class="italic">Bradford Observer</span> (23 April 1889), recognized him as a &#145;warm-hearted philanthropist&#146; with &#145;an unreserved devotion to the commercial interests of the town&#146; and &#145;an unswerving fidelity in the principles of free trade&#146;.<br>
