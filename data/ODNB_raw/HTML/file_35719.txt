</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Reid,  Robert Threshie</span>, Earl Loreburn  (1846&#150;1923), <span class="occ">lord chancellor</span>, was born on 3 April 1846 on the island of Corfu, the second son of Sir James John Reid (1805&#150;1876), of Mouswald Place, Dumfries, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Robert Threshie, of Barnbarroch, Kirkcudbrightshire. His maternal forebears came from Norfolk. Both his father and grandfather were lawyers. Sir James had been appointed chief justice of the Ionian Islands, then a British protectorate, by Lord Grey of the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>; and Reid spent an exotic boyhood on Corfu, returning with his family to Dumfries when his father's term of office expired. He was educated at Cheltenham College, where he proved an outstanding scholar and athlete, becoming head of the school and excelling at cricket, football, and racquets. After winning a demyship at Magdalen College, Oxford, he decided to try for a scholarship at Balliol; and although the president of Magdalen refused his characteristically bold request for permission to make the attempt without forfeiting his demyship, he won the Balliol scholarship anyway. Intellectual and athletic prowess made him the classic Balliol all-rounder. He won his blue for racquets, played cricket for the university, and was reckoned a wicket-keeper of national calibre. &#145;You will get a Third, Mr Reid&#146;, the redoubtable Benjamin Jowett, master of Balliol, warned of these sporting predilections  (<span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span>, 33); but by dint of all-out effort Reid confounded the prediction, gaining first-class honours in both classical moderations and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1868) and carrying off the leading classical scholarship, the Ireland.<h2>
<a name="Thebarandpolitics"></a>The bar and politics</h2>Failing, however, much to his disappointment, to win a fellowship, Reid decided on a legal career. He was called to the bar of the Inner Temple in 1871 and joined the Oxford circuit. The same year he married Emily Douglas, daughter of Captain Arthur Fleming, of the 1st dragoon guards. His rise at the bar was rapid. He reputedly earned several hundred pounds in his first year. For a time he &#145;devilled&#146; for Henry James (later Lord James of Hereford), a former pupil at Cheltenham, but soon established his independence. His strong points were common sense, mastery of facts, and ready grasp of issues. Especially able in commercial suits, &#145;he could unravel complicated details in a partnership and track a fraud through all its windings&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 1 Dec 1923). A stout, bluff, good-natured man, addicted to his cup of tea and his clay pipe, with a strong physique and a large head (which critics called &#145;swelled&#146;), determined in his opinions, yet kindly and soft-spoken, he was well liked for his frank, open demeanour, his informality, and his sportsmanship. In an age when first names were less frequently used than later, he was widely known as &#145;Bob&#146; Reid.<br>
<br>Reid was an admirer of W. E. Gladstone and entertained political ambitions. Through the further influence of Sir Henry James, he stood as Liberal candidate for Hereford in the general election of 1880, and was elected to parliament as the borough's second Liberal member. In 1882 he took silk, only eleven years after call and at the then exceptionally early age of thirty-six. He appeared frequently before the House of Lords and the judicial committee of the privy council; but his performance as a &#145;leader&#146;, though competent, was felt to fall below his early promise, his political pursuits having outstripped his interest in law. When Hereford became a single-member constituency in 1885, Reid sought another seat. He was narrowly defeated at Dunbartonshire, but secured election as a Gladstonian Liberal in June 1886 as member for Dumfries burghs, which he represented for nineteen years until he became lord chancellor in 1905.<br>
<br>Reid made no special mark in the House of Commons, but was much in demand across the country as a popular and attractive speech maker. A lucky chain of events propelled him suddenly from the back benches to high office. In the summer of 1894 the solicitor-general, Sir John Rigby, was made attorney-general, and Reid became a candidate for the vacancy. His main rival was Haldane, strongly supported by Asquith; but Haldane, like Rigby, was a Chancery lawyer, and it was felt that &#145;it would not do to have him as well as Rigby for Law Officers&#146;  (Brooks, 132). With some reluctance, the prime minister, Lord Rosebery, appointed Reid as solicitor-general; he was knighted in the same year. In October 1894, when Rigby was raised to the Court of Appeal, Sir Robert Reid, as he then was, became attorney-general. His tenure lasted only a few months, however, for when the Unionists returned to power the following July, he was out of office for a decade.<br>
<br>During these years in opposition, Reid's practice declined; but the Unionist government thought sufficiently highly of his judgement and character to invite him to act as arbitrator in the boundary dispute between Venezuela and British Guiana in 1899, for which he received the GCMG, and in the Alaska boundary dispute in 1903. A &#145;Little Englander&#146; (though he repudiated the expression), like the Liberal leader, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, he denounced both the government's policy towards the Boers and its imperialist supporters prominent in his own party. During the South African War he continued to speak out for the Boers &#145;with characteristic disregard of his professional and political interests&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 1 Dec 1923). After the war he helped Campbell-Bannerman to draw up the settlement which restored self-government to Transvaal and Orange River Colony.<h2>
<a name="Lordchancellor"></a>Lord chancellor</h2>Even before the Liberals returned to power, there was much intriguing for the office of lord chancellor. As in 1894, Haldane, once more a contender, canvassed the prime minister, again with Asquith's support; but Campbell-Bannerman preferred Reid on both personal and political grounds, and appointed him to the woolsack in December 1905. He took the title of Baron Loreburn of Dumfries (from &#145;lower-burn&#146;, a district of Dumfries, and the city's ancient motto and rallying cry). When Campbell-Bannerman died in 1908, Loreburn's was one of several names proposed to succeed him instead of Asquith. Widowed in January 1904 after a long and happy marriage, in 1907 Loreburn married a close friend of his late wife, Violet Elizabeth, elder daughter of William Frederick Hicks-Beach, of Witcombe Park, Gloucestershire, and niece of the well-known Conservative statesman, Michael Hicks Beach, first earl of St Aldwyn. There were no children of either marriage.<br>
<br>Loreburn was a vigorous, reforming lord chancellor. He established the office of public trustee, a long-awaited measure designed to obviate the defalcations of unscrupulous solicitors. His most important achievement was the establishment in 1907 of the court of criminal appeal, another reform long overdue, which he carried through despite much opposition from his fellow lawyers. He was constantly importuned by Liberal MPs to nominate large numbers of their supporters as justices of the peace after a glut of Unionist appointments by Lord Halsbury. Resolved to appoint on grounds of fitness alone, he indignantly resisted these efforts by what he called &#145;the caucus&#146; of his party, including the chief whip, as he wrote to George Whiteley on 10 December 1906, &#145;to force upon me what I regard as a prostitution of my office, and &hellip; I will resign the Great Seal sooner than do it&#146;  (Heuston, 156). He would gladly redress the political balance, he declared, but on conscientiously investigating the names submitted to him rather than approving them on the nod, as had been customary, he found many which he felt bound to reject. &#145;I should be a coward&#146;, he wrote to Arthur Ponsonby on 22 November 1906, &#145;if I made what I think unsuitable appointments to appease the clamour of MPs&#146;  (Heuston, 154). Chastened by his own experience, in 1910 he introduced the present system of local advisory committees responsible to the lord chancellor for recommending candidates for the magistracy. His impartiality and discernment were likewise apparent in his nominations to the county court and High Court. He showed the same staunch independence of mind in his refusal &#145;to hawk justice&#146;, as he put it  (Fitzroy, 335), by bowing to political pressures, which, again, had certainly influenced the process hitherto. As he observed with pride on raising J. C. Bigham to the presidency of the Admiralty, Probate, and Divorce Division in 1909, &#145;there were no damned politics about the appointment&#146;  (Mersey, 227). To a candidate disappointed of judicial office who pleaded his political services, Loreburn explained loftily that politics did not come into it; to which the infuriated aspirant retorted that but for politics Loreburn himself would have risen no higher than a county court bench  (Ashley, 224&#150;5). His High Court nominees included such luminaries as Parker, Eve, Bankes, Avory, Horridge, Lush, Scrutton, and Hamilton (later Lord Sumner).<br>
<br>As speaker of the House of Lords, it fell to Loreburn to introduce a succession of radical and controversial measures against strenuous opposition from the hereditary Unionist peers with their huge entrenched majority. Legislation ranged from an act for the taxation of Scottish land values in 1908 to the <span class="roman">Trade Union Act</span> of 1913, which, reversing the decisions in the Taff Vale and Osborne cases, empowered trade unions to levy a political fund and to sponsor members of parliament. Loreburn led the house at a period of inter-party strife and constitutional crisis unprecedented in modern times and which intensified when the peers rejected the &#145;People's Budget&#146; in 1909. Emotions ran particularly high during the debates on the <span class="roman">Parliament Act</span> of 1911, which drastically reduced the power of the Lords to delay legislation. Yet unexpectedly, Loreburn established and maintained a marked ascendancy in the upper house, winning respect and even affection for the honesty, straightforwardness, and patience which accompanied and set off his absolute determination. His dignity and pluck and the patent sincerity of his belief in the reforms which he advocated appealed to his opponents' sporting instincts; so did his good humour, as when he offered to go tiger shooting with one of the leading &#145;die-hards&#146;, Lord Willoughby de Broke. &#145;If he was a strong partisan&#146; the latter recalled, &#145;no one thought the worse of him for that&#146;  (Broke, 259). He also impressed George V, at whose insistence he was raised to an earldom in the coronation honours of 1911 after only five years in office; and he was one of four named councillors of state during the king's absence in India.<br>
<br>As a law lord, Loreburn set high standards of courtesy. He listened to counsel instead of arguing with them: &#145;an appeal became again a hearing and not a debate&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 1 Dec 1923); and when he did interrupt, it was only for clarification and invariably sweetened by an apology. He was an expeditious and practical judge rather than a great jurist, his first concern being, unusually, for the litigant rather than the law. A leading case on punitive damages, for example, <i>Addis v. Gramophone Company Ltd</i> (1909), he saw primarily in human terms as &#145;a most unfortunate litigation, in which the costs must far exceed any sum there may be at stake&#146;. &#145;A little common sense&#146;, he observed, &#145;would have settled all these differences in a few minutes.&#146; He deprecated &#145;long rambling judgments loaded with irrelevant learning&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 1 Dec 1923), and his own rulings, while clear and concise, were often brief to a point. His primary aim in disposing of a case was to do justice between the parties, without enlarging on the legal principles involved. As lord chancellor, this exposed him to justified criticism. In R. V. Heuston's view &#145;he was not interested in law and his perfunctory judgments are of no interest to the jurist&#146;  (Simpson, 445); and it is true that he seldom broke new ground unless his particular interest was aroused, when he could produce a judgment that was workmanlike if not particularly inspiring. In <i>Hulton &amp; Co. v. Jones</i> (1910), where the defendant newspaper had never heard of the plaintiff, one Artemus Jones, believing that it had merely satirized a fictitious character, Loreburn ruled that once the libel was proved, it was no defence that it was unintentional. In the <i>Tamplin Steamship Company</i> case (1916) he explained the principle of frustration of contract as founded on an implied term, absolving the parties under certain untoward circumstances from their future obligations. He took a measured view of the force of precedent. While agreeing that &#145;great importance is to be attached to old authorities, on the strength of which many transactions may have been adjusted and rights determined&#146;, he also insisted that &#145;when they are plainly wrong&#146;, it was &#145;the duty of this House to overrule them&#146;  (<i>West Ham Union v. Edmonton Union</i>, 1908).<br>
<br>The ardours of office, the long hours and manifold duties, the diverse political pressures on Loreburn at a time of acute political tensions, were compounded by his growing unease at the government's conduct of foreign affairs since the death of Campbell-Bannerman&#151;an issue on which he contemplated resigning. He was never an easy colleague in cabinet. Under Rosebery he &#145;had shown a good deal of discontent&#146;  (Brooks, 133), and even under his friend Campbell-Bannerman, Lloyd George noted, &#145;he grumbles the first half of the time and sulks the second half&#146;  (J. Wilson, 501). He was also much exercised by his public opposition to the <span class="roman">Women's Suffrage Bill</span> (1912), which, liberal though he was, he felt to be a &#145;constitutional outrage&#146;  (Vincent, 270). The accumulated strains told on his health: in 1911 he complained in the House of Lords that they &#145;may prove too much for the strength of anybody&#146;. It was noticed that he was tired, depressed, and eager to leave office. In June 1912 he fell seriously ill with heart trouble and was obliged to resign very suddenly.<h2>
<a name="Elderstatesmanandradical"></a>Elder statesman and radical</h2>Loreburn retired to Kingsdown House, near Deal in Kent, making various subsequent interventions in public life, notably on the <span class="roman">Irish Home Rule Bill</span> of 1912. Though hitherto considered &#145;the best friend of Irish nationalism in the Cabinet&#146;  (Vincent, 270), a supporter since Gladstone's day of &#145;Home rule all round&#146;, and vehemently opposed to excluding Ulster from home rule, he feared, not without reason, that the current political crisis might erupt in civil war. In September 1913 he published a letter in <span class="italic">The Times</span> proposing all-party constitutional talks, to include discussion of special provisions for Ulster. This volte-face, presented &#145;with a typical elder statesman's show of non-partisan wisdom&#146;  (Jenkins, 287) from &#145;an always disgruntled ex-colleague&#146;  (David, 147), annoyed and embarrassed the government; but the king welcomed it, and it prompted his attempt to ease the crisis at the Buckingham Palace conference in 1914.<br>
<br>Loreburn was a self-proclaimed radical, a follower of Bright, Cobden, and Gladstone, who strove to revive traditional Liberal and pacifist values. In advance of the Hague Peace Conference of 1907 he urged the cabinet to champion immunity from prize law of goods at sea, publishing his ideas in a book entitled <span class="italic">Capture at Sea</span> (1905, reprinted 1913). These efforts were scorned by the Admiralty and the Foreign Office. Lord Hardinge complained of &#145;the peace at any price section of the Cabinet headed by the Lord Chancellor&#146;  (Monger, 255), who, with all the radical's distrust of France, urged rapprochement with Germany and deplored the government's policy of aligning Great Britain with France and Russia. During the Agadir crisis (1911), fearing imminent war with Germany and conscious of his isolation and impotence in the cabinet, Loreburn enlisted C. P. Scott of the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> to campaign for British non-intervention. Out of office in the crisis of 1914, he again urged a policy of non-intervention; and while he came to accept that Germany's violation of Belgian neutrality made British involvement inevitable, he never ceased to deplore the secret military conversations between Britain and France which had taken place since 1906, originally without his knowledge, and which he always held to be the underlying cause of the war. He bitterly and somewhat unfairly condemned his former colleagues, &#145;the Old Gang, who have sold and deceived us&#146;  (Heuston, 180)&#151;Sir Edward Grey, Asquith, and Haldane&#151;for what he saw as &#145;a course of systematic suppression of the truth&#146;  (Heuston, 174). He reputedly attended a meeting in 1915 to bring down the Asquith government. But for his pacifism, Lloyd George would have restored him to the woolsack. He never gave up hope of compromise peace with Germany, however. In 1916 he warmly welcomed Lord Lansdowne's &#145;peace letter&#146; in the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> and endorsed it with one of his own in the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>. In 1919 he published <span class="italic">How the War Came</span>, a careful but polemical analysis of British foreign policy before 1914. He abominated the treaty of Versailles and the post-war military repression in Ireland. He approved the peace policy of the Labour Party and even voted for a Labour candidate at an election.<br>
<br>Loreburn was justly admired for his independence of character and expression, his moral courage, and fidelity to his Liberal principles. Indifferent to the grandeur of office, he did not stand on ceremony or talk down. On his appointment to the woolsack, a friend, Adolphus Liddell, noted &#145;the irony of fate that he of all men should be driven into a peerage with all its pomps and vanities! &hellip; but Reid accepts it all with dignity, which silences one's tongue inclined to mock&#146;  (Heuston, 144). His convictions, in politics and in life, went deep, and he stuck to them. In 1915 he rallied the law lords against an amendment of the <span class="roman">Defence of the Realm Act</span> of 1914 which would have made civilians liable to trial by court martial. In 1918, when he gave up sitting as a judge in order to finish his book on the war, he remitted one half of the pension to which he was entitled. Politicians, his fellow Liberals more than his Conservative opponents, were irritated by what they saw as his &#145;aggressive honesty&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 1 Dec 1923). He once referred to the hereditary whig peers as &#145;liars, sir and thieves&#146;  (Dangerfield, 69), and he fell out with Lord Rosebery by ascribing his resignation as Liberal leader to drink  (Vincent, 499). His irascibility, exacerbated by strain and growing alienation from his colleagues, turned in later years to melancholy, embittered by disillusionment at the war and a sense of personal and political betrayal. A visitor in 1915 found that he was &#145;very depressed, and does not passionately love his old colleagues&#146;  (Sandhurst, 305). &#145;My whole life&#146;, he complained in 1919, &#145;has been a long struggle with men and measures alien to all I value.&#146;  (Heuston, 180) He found consolation in translating verse, classical and modern.<br>
<br>In general Loreburn was fair-minded, magnanimous, and kindly. To Haldane, his old rival and successor on the woolsack, he wrote: &#145;the only thing that makes life worth having is, to my mind, a friendly feeling among men. I think with Sophocles that this alone imparts value to any man's life&#146;  (Heuston, 167). His love of games gave him pleasure long after he ceased to be an active sportsman. In 1907 he served as president of the Marylebone Cricket Club. In the same year he received an honorary DCL from the University of Oxford, and in 1912 he was appointed visitor of Balliol College, of which he had been an honorary fellow since 1908. In 1913 he was appointed as chairman of the royal commission on railways. He was a bencher of the Inner Temple, standing counsel to Oxford University from 1899 to 1907, and a freeman of Dumfries and Annan. He was a member of Brooks's and the National Liberal Club. His health declined and he died at Kingsdown House on 30 November 1923. He was cremated at Golders Green and his ashes were interred at the churchyard at Mouswald, in the grave of his first wife. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
