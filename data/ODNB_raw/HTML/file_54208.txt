<span class="headword">Fulkherd,  Quentin</span> <span class="st"> [Quintin Folkhard]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1407&#150;1410), <span class="occ">alleged Lollard heretic</span>, is identified only in two English safe conducts from 1407, as &#145;Quintin Folkhard of Scotland&#146;, and in a batch of his letters dated 1410 and entitled <span class="italic">Nova Scocie</span>, which are preserved in a Prague manuscript [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11898/', "Haldenston, James")</script>]; these describe him as an esquire. The safe conducts possibly imply that he was an emissary between the English and Scottish courts, for reference is made to his returning to Henry IV's presence from Scotland. If he visited the English court in this period, he may have encountered some of the evangelical (and allegedly Lollard) knights who were then active in English public life and who could have influenced him, but this is only conjecture. It may not, however, be merely coincidental that the letters were sent in a year in which contacts are recorded between Sir John Oldcastle (<i>d</i>. 1417), the leader of the English Lollard rising of 1414, and the Bohemian reformers. The letters, written in Latin and containing scriptural and patristic quotations, show that Fulkherd was a man of some education, although there is no evidence for his attending any university. One letter was addressed to the bishop of Glasgow, so Fulkherd might have come from that diocese. The letters were written to the whole community of Christendom, the bishop of Glasgow and the Scottish clergy, the secular lords of the country, and Fulkherd's parish priest. Their general tone is more anti-clerical than heretical, and suggests that Fulkherd's principal concern was to encourage moral reform in the church. His only potentially heretical demand is that the scriptures and the articles of faith should be preached to the people in the vernacular, something which the preamble to the letters says he had actually done. He does not express any view on transubstantiation, the most significant Lollard theological deviation, and acknowledges ecclesiastical jurisdiction over heresy&#151;in the second letter he writes that he would accept the church's correction if they could disprove his charges against the clergy. After 1410 Fulkherd disappears from the records and, although there is evidence of measures against heresy in Scotland in the following decade, the suggestion that he was the anonymous Lollard burnt at Glasgow in 1422 remains unproven.<br>
