<span class="headword">Pulteney,  Daniel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1682, <em>d.</em> 1731), <span class="occ">politician</span>, the son of John Pulteney (<i>d</i>. 1726), commissioner of customs and MP, and his wife, Lucy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Colville, was baptized on 26 September 1682 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London. His grandfather Sir William Pulteney represented Westminster for many parliaments, and his first cousin was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22889/', "William Pulteney, later earl of Bath")</script>. He was educated at Westminster School and matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 15 July 1699 but left without a degree. In 1700 he contributed a series of Latin verses to the university collection commemorating the death of the young duke of Gloucester. Between 1704 and 1706 he toured the Dutch republic and the German states, and was then appointed envoy-extraordinary to Denmark, a position he held until 1715. From 1717 until 1720 he served as a commissioner of trade in France, and produced notably informative reports for the Board of Trade in England. Pulteney married, on 1 December 1717, Margaret (1699&#150;1763), daughter and coheir of Benjamin Tichbourne, and sister-in-law of Charles Spencer, third earl of Sunderland. The earl was a leading opponent of Robert Walpole, and proved a significant influence on the development of Pulteney's political views.<br>
<br>On 23 March 1721 Pulteney was elected MP for the Cornish borough of Tregony, and in October was appointed a lord of the Admiralty. At a by-election the following month he was returned in the interest of his cousin William Pulteney as a member for Hedon, near Hull. In the following year he exchanged this seat for that of Preston borough, where he remained for the rest of his political career. Sunderland's death on 19 April 1722 came as a severe blow to Pulteney who now, according to Arthur Onslow, intensified his criticism of Walpole &#145;who had been the chief opponent of his friend and patron&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons</span>). At first covertly, and then openly after relinquishing his government office, Pulteney became a leading figure in the emerging country whig opposition to the Walpole ministry. According to Onslow it was Daniel who did most to encourage William Pulteney to oppose the administration.<br>
<br>On the death of his father in 1726 Pulteney inherited a considerable fortune and the clerkship to the council in Ireland under a reversion granted by Queen Anne. From this date he had no further need of patronage and was unimpeded in his opposition to Walpole, against whose ministry he made his first recorded speech on 9 February 1726. Other strategies included his provision of financial support, along with his cousin and Lord Bolingbroke, for <span class="italic">The Craftsman</span> journal, to which Pulteney was also an occasional contributor. Ultimately his failure to bring down the ministry had a deep impact; in Onslow's view &#145;he fell at last a martyr &hellip; for his not succeeding preyed upon his spirits&#146;. Otherwise he was a &#145;very worthy man, very knowing and laborious in business, especially in foreign affairs, of strong but not lively parts, a clear and weighty speaker&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons</span>).<br>
<br>Pulteney's private life was also blighted by the early deaths of six of the couple's children, two of whom were commemorated in odes by Ambrose Phillips. Only one daughter, Frances (1728&#150;1782), reached maturity; she later married William Johnstone [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56208/', "Pulteney, Sir William, fifth baronet")</script>], politician and property developer. In 1767 Frances inherited the Pulteney estate belonging to her great-grandfather Sir William Pulteney and the considerable wealth accrued by her father's cousin William, and she and her husband adopted the Pulteney surname. Daniel Pulteney died on 7 September 1731 and was buried at St James's, Westminster, on 14 September 1731. His remains were moved on 17 May 1732 to the east end of the south cloister at Westminster Abbey, where a fine monument by James Leoni, lauding his independent spirit, was erected.<br>
