<span class="headword">Arnold,  Cornelius</span>  (<em>b. </em>1714, <em>d.</em> in or after 1758?), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 13 March 1714 and educated in London at Merchant Taylors' School from 1724 to 1728. Nothing is known of his parentage, and little of his later career. The one fact alleged by Baker in <span class="italic">Biographia dramatica</span> (1782 edn, 2.7), that Arnold had been an usher at his old school, is untrue. In his later years he served as beadle to the Worshipful Company of Distillers. The list of over 250 subscribers to the collected edition of his works, <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span> (1757), includes the lord mayor of London and more than a dozen aldermen, suggesting that Arnold's milieu was the City and its livery companies. The names of Francis Hayman, David Garrick, and others indicate acquaintance with the theatre. One fifth of all subscribers were clergymen.<br>
<br>The earliest datable item in this collection of &#145;trifling Productions &hellip; of my leisure Hours&#146;, a short piece on the battle of Fontenoy (1745), suggests that Arnold came relatively late to poetry. It also gives expression to a recurring theme in Arnold's verse: strong patriotism manifested in hostility towards France. Shortly after the earthquake which struck London on 8 February 1750 he composed a poem in blank verse on the sufferings of the poor, <span class="italic">Distress: a Poetical Essay</span> ([1750?]; second edn, published by the author, 1751). The <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, however, found it &#145;but an indifferent performance&#146; (6, 1752, 156). His next publication, <span class="italic">Commerce: a Poem</span> (1751), is replete with fulsome compliments to Frederick, prince of Wales; a footnote in <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span> explains that the prince approved the poem, but died on the day its author was to have been introduced to him. Arnold's next poem, <span class="italic">The Mirror: a Poetical Essay, in the Manner of Spenser</span>, was dedicated to Garrick, again with unfortunate timing, for it was published on 15 November 1755, in the middle of riots provoked by the appearance of &#145;French&#146; dancers at Drury Lane. Imitating the stanza and the archaisms of Spenser's <span class="italic">Faerie Queene</span>, it describes how Death invades a lord mayor's feast, and carries off a number of well-known figures, including Garrick and William Murray, soon to become Lord Mansfield. There is much satire on contemporary (that is, French) fashions in female dress. Arnold's oriental tragedy, &#145;Osman&#146;, was never performed, but occupies the first half of <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span>. The entire volume is dedicated to Lord Blakeney, patron of the Laudable Order of Antigallicans, recently returned from his heroic defence of Minorca. The second edition of this collection, promised for the ensuing winter (sig. a2), never appeared, and it has been assumed that Arnold died about this time. However, the 26-line poem &#145;On the asylum for orphans and deserted girls. By Mr. Arnold&#146;, which appeared in the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span> in June 1758 (27.307), shows compassion towards distress and promotes anti-Gallic patriotism in a manner which suggests that it came from Arnold's pen and, therefore, that he died not earlier than 1758.<br>
