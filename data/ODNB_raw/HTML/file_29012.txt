<span class="headword">Wells,  Edward</span>  (1667&#150;1727), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and educationist</span>, was the eldest child of Edward Wells (<i>d</i>. 1677), vicar of Corsham, Wiltshire, and his wife, Elizabeth. He was admitted into Westminster School, London, in 1680, and was thence elected to a scholarship at Christ Church, Oxford, from where he matriculated on 16 December 1686. Wells was tutored by Thomas Burton, later canon of Gloucester, and held two exhibitionerships (in 1691&#150;2 and 1699). He graduated BA on 10 July 1690 and was elected a praelector in the same year. He proceeded MA on 1 June 1693. From 1691 to 1702, Wells was a tutor at Christ Church, and among his pupils was Thomas Bennet, who later presented Wells to the living at Cotesbach, Leicestershire, into which he was inducted on 2 January 1702. He accumulated the degrees of BD and DD on 5 April 1704, the year in which his studentship at Christ Church became void. In March 1716 he was inducted to the rectory of Bletchley, Buckinghamshire, on the presentation of Browne Willis, another former pupil. He took the opportunity in sermons there &#145;to mark out by slander his benefactor, the very man who by mistake, in an uncommon manner, gave him the stand and opportunity of his behaviour&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 6.187).<br>
<br>Wells published copiously from 1698 until his death, and his output can be divided into five main categories: two religious and three educational. As a divine, Wells achieved some notoriety for his polemical high-church tracts. Thus Wells attacked Presbyterianism in his <span class="italic">Letter from Minister of the Church of England to a Dissenting Parishioner</span> (1706; four subsequent editions and several replies), which was followed up by a similar <span class="italic">Letter</span> to a Presbyterian minister (1706; three subsequent editions and several replies) and a tract on <span class="italic">The Invalidity of Presbyterian Ordination</span> (1707). He also attacked the Anglican divine Samuel Clarke in his <span class="italic">Remarks</span> (1713) and the exchange which followed, Clarke's scepticism over Christ's status in Trinitarian doctrine rousing his ire (Wells had already written an <span class="italic">Essay</span> on the Trinity and Christ's divinity in 1712). In the realm of church politics, Wells also wrote <span class="italic">Forty-Six Propositions</span> (1717), asserting the legality of the Hanoverian succession and supporting the removal of the nonjurors from their parishes. Second, Wells published several more eirenic religious works later in life in the form of catechismal and pastoral tracts: most popular was his <span class="italic">Letter Concerning the Sin of Taking Christ's Name in Vain</span> (1710; nine further editions). He also wrote <span class="italic">Of Children's Capacities to Receive Religious Instructions</span> (1717) and three works for such a juvenile audience: a catechism, <span class="italic">The Common Christian Rightly and Plainly Instructed</span> (1707); and a pair of instructional manuals of devotion, a <span class="italic">Help for the More Easy Understanding of the Holy Scripture</span> (1724) and a <span class="italic">Help for the Right Understanding of the Several Divine Laws and Covenants</span> (1729).<br>
<br>Wells's publications as an educationist dovetail neatly with his catechismal and pastoral writings, but also make occasional forays into religious polemics. First, he published a series of mathematical works, including the <span class="italic">Elementa arithmeticae</span> (1698), which was followed by a series of interconnected works: the <span class="italic">Young Gentleman's Astronomy, Chronology and Dialling</span> (1712), <span class="italic">Young Gentleman's Arithmetick and Geometry</span> (1713), <span class="italic">Young Gentleman's Course of Mathematicks</span> (1714), and <span class="italic">Young Gentleman's Trigonometry, Mechanicks and Opticks</span> (1714). These volumes treated, <i>inter alia</i>, the mathematical element of geography (the use of globes, determination of latitude and longitude, and so on), but Wells also, and secondly, published a series of descriptive geographies, largely cribbed from other sources, but widely recommended at schools and universities in the period. His <span class="italic">Treatise of Antient and Present Geography</span> (1701; and four further editions) was a popular gazetteer intended for students reading classics, while his <span class="italic">Historical Geography of the New Testament</span> (1708) and the companion <span class="italic">Historical Geography of the Old Testament</span> (1711&#150;12) plagiarized travellers to the Near East and biblical scholars to give a description of the Holy Land, but also attacked Roman Catholicism and Presbyterianism in passing. Connected with his geographical books, and thirdly, Wells published translations and editions of classical and Christian texts: he contributed geographical notes to editions of Xenophon's <span class="italic">Hellenica</span> (1690) and of Eusebius's <span class="italic">History of the Church</span> (1709), and translated Dionysius the Guide's <span class="italic">Periegetes</span> (1704) from Greek into Latin, adding a series of notes in the light of sixteen centuries of subsequent geographical discoveries.<br>
<br>Wells's writings are more voluminous than distinguished. While uncharitable in tone, Thomas Hearne's assessment of Wells's <i>&#339;uvre</i> is substantially accurate:<blockquote>[he] writ &amp; scribbled many books, on purpose to scrape up money &hellip; The truth is, he was a man of great industry, but the books he hath writ &amp; published, as they are very many, so they are inaccurate, &amp; contain very little that is curious. (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 9.330)</blockquote>Wells never married; he died at Cotesbach on 11 July 1727, and was buried on 15 July there.<br>
