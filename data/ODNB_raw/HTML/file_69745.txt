<span class="headword">Bacon,  Francis</span>  (1600&#150;1663), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 30 January 1600, the fifth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/989/', "Edward Bacon (1548/9&#150;1618)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/998/', "Bacon, Sir Nathaniel (1546?&#150;1622)")</script>] of Shrubland Hall, Barham, Suffolk, and his wife, Helen (1564&#150;1646), daughter and heir of Thomas Little of Bray, Berkshire. Always somewhat in the shadow of his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1000/', "Nathaniel Bacon (bap. 1593, d. 1660)")</script>, seven years his senior, Francis at least went up to a different Cambridge college, Queens', in 1617 as a fellow-commoner, but in the next year followed Nathaniel at Gray's Inn and was called to the bar eight years later. The brothers jointly presented their famous uncle Francis's works to the library of the inn in 1635, and Cave Beck dedicated his <span class="italic">Universal Character</span> to them jointly in 1657.<br>
<br>On 30 April 1633 Bacon married Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1660), daughter of Sir Thomas Wingfield of Letheringham, whose sister was married to William Bloyse, merchant of Ipswich, then newly established at Grundisburgh where the wedding took place. Bacon and Bloyse were lifelong colleagues; indeed Bacon bought Bloyse's house in St Nicholas's parish, Ipswich, about 1650.<br>
<br>The staunchly protestant Bacons of Shrubland were early supporters of the parliamentary cause. In a letter of April 1640 to John Winthrop, governor of Massachusetts, Bacon regrets having bought an estate from him, for &#145;if a good change come not by the Parliament I shall wish my money in my purse again and both it and myself with you&#146;  (<span class="italic">Winthrop Papers</span>, 4.228). Public life in Ipswich began for him when he was made town counsel and his brother recorder on the same day in 1642; next he became a Suffolk commissioner for assessment, for the sequestration of delinquents, and the levying of money for the war effort in 1643. Then came membership and the rotating chairmanship of the committee for the associated counties, and the hearing of evidence against scandalous ministers. When there were misgivings about the New Model Army in the seven counties, Bacon was a moderating influence.<br>
<br>In 1646 Bacon was first elected to parliament for Ipswich (Nathaniel representing Cambridge University), and was soon given committee responsibilities. In late 1647 he was one of those working for a peaceful settlement with the king. Secluded from the house at Pride's Purge, he was readmitted in June 1649, but did not sit with the Rump, returning to attend to Suffolk and Ipswich business. When in June 1652 the town invited the celebrated presbyterian preacher Stephen Marshall to take on its preachership, Bacon's entertainment helped secure his assent.<br>
<br>Nathaniel and Francis represented the town jointly from 1654 to 1660, William Bloyse sitting for the county, and Francis was a master of requests in 1656&#150;9. Perhaps because his enthusiasm for the Commonwealth waned after Oliver Cromwell's death, he was listed as a possible member of a royalist uprising in Suffolk in 1658. Nothing came of this and in May 1660 it was the Bacons and the town clerk who were sent to Whitehall with gifts for the restored monarch; but in the 1660 Convention Francis, still pro-presbyterian, was given a manager, William Ellys.<br>
<br>Katherine Bacon bore her husband six sons and two daughters between 1634 and 1646, four of the sons dying young. She died at their Kensington house on 23 October 1660 and was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields two days later. Bacon, already an ancient and bencher of his inn, was made a reader in 1662. He spent his last month at Grundisburgh where William Bloyse recorded his death on 23 September 1663; taken to London, his remains were interred next to his wife's on the 27th. He left property in Norfolk, Suffolk, and Staffordshire, and had shipping interests which possibly included trade with Danzig; his will provided mainly for his children Francis, Nathaniel, and Katherine.<br>
