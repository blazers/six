<span class="headword">Oley,  Barnabas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1602, <em>d.</em> 1686), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Kirkthorpe, Yorkshire, and was baptized on 27 December 1602 in the parish church at Wakefield, the son of Francis Oley (<i>d</i>. 1643?), clergyman, and his wife, Mary Watterhouse. From 1602 to 1619 his father was vicar of Penistone, in the same county, and in 1607 Oley entered Wakefield grammar school. In 1617 he was admitted to Clare College, Cambridge, probably as Cave's exhibitioner from his school, and he graduated BA in 1621. Having been elected a probationer fellow of the foundation of Lady Clare at the college on 28 November 1623, he proceeded MA in 1625 and was elected a senior fellow in 1627. Among his students was Peter Gunning, later bishop of Ely.<br>
<br>In 1633 Oley was appointed to the college living of Great Gransden, Huntingdonshire, which he held for the rest of his life, but continuing the duties of his fellowship for several years he continued to live in Cambridge. In 1634&#150;5 he served as taxor, or price regulator, for the university, and in 1635&#150;6 as proctor. The first steps for the rebuilding of Clare College, which was begun on 19 May 1638, although not finished until 1715, were taken under his diligent and careful direction; he was called by Thomas Fuller its &#145;Master of the fabrick&#146;  (T. Fuller, <span class="italic">The History of the University of Cambridge</span>, 1655, 38).<br>
<br>In the summer of 1642 Oley was an evidently zealous loyalist, and it was to him, according to standard royalist accounts, that the university entrusted the task of taking its plate to the king to be converted into money for his use. Oley, it was said, brought it safely to Charles's headquarters &#145;at Nottingham&#146; in August  (Varley, 80). He was also said to have lent a considerable sum of money on the communion plate of Clare College, which was of solid gold and very valuable. This he later restored to the college on repayment of part of his loan in 1660; there is a college tradition that its three other very old pieces of plate were also preserved by his care. There are, however, flaws in this version of events: there was no &#145;university plate&#146; as such; the king was not at this date at Nottingham; Oley was not, as described, &#145;president&#146; of Clare; only relatively insignificant amounts of plate and money from a handful of colleges are recorded as having reached Charles at Oxford. If Oley acted as an agent then he did so secretly the night before Oliver Cromwell and Valentine Walton successfully blocked a major convoy of plate, and took with him only a fraction of what the royalists received&#151;perhaps, indeed, plate from Clare. On 8 April 1644 Oley was ejected from his fellowship by the earl of Manchester on the grounds of non-residence in Cambridge and failure to appear before the commission of visitors. He was also plundered of his personal and landed property, and although not sequestered, was forced to leave Great Gransden, where his curate, Nathaniel Jury, deputized for him.<br>
<br>In the later 1640s Oley led a wandering and impoverished life. In 1643 and 1646 he was in Oxford. During the sieges of Pontefract in 1644 and 1645 he preached to the royalist garrison defending the castle. By 1647 he had been sequestered from the impropriate rectory of Warmfield, Yorkshire, which his father had resigned in 1643. Having helped Sir Marmaduke Langdale to escape in 1648 from prison and a death sentence, the following year Oley had to compound for delinquency in assisting the forces against parliament, and was fined &pound;30. A further &pound;50 was added in 1652, in lieu of which he was required to settle &pound;5 a year on the minister of Warmfield. For some time he had lived at Heath, near Wakefield, but in 1652 and 1653 he stayed &#145;in the north privately, near the place of Lady Savil's demolished habitation&#146;  (J. E. B. Mayor, <span class="italic">Cambridge in the Seventeenth Century, pt 1: Nicholas Ferrar</span>, 1855, 303&#150;4).<br>
<br>By the 1650s Oley had both the leisure and the resources to prepare manuscripts for publication. In 1652 he edited <span class="italic">Herbert's Remains, or, Sundry Pieces of that Sweet Singer of the Temple, Mr George Herbert</span>, containing <span class="italic">A Priest to the Temple, or, The Country Parson</span> and <span class="italic">Jacula prudentum</span>. Prefixed was an unsigned &#145;prefatory View of the Life and Vertues of the Author, and Excellencies of this Book&#146;, which was written by Oley. The second edition was to appear in 1671 as <span class="italic">A Priest to the Temple, or, The Country Parson</span>, with a new preface, signed Barnabas Oley. Both prefaces, often polemical in tone, reflect his commitment to a Laudian ideal of the Church of England. The manuscript of &#145;The Country Parson&#146; was the property of Oley's friend Edmund Duncon: in the 1671 preface Oley corrects Isaac Walton's story that Arthur Woodnoth gave it to him. Walton in turn drew on Oley's prefaces for parts of his own life of Herbert.<br>
<br>Between 1653 and 1657 Oley edited three volumes of the works of Thomas Jackson, the late president of Corpus Christi College, Oxford. In the prefatory epistles he extolled Jackson's merits and begged for the return of borrowed manuscripts of his works. In the third volume, dedicated to Gilbert Sheldon, Oley explained that &#145;God, by convincing me of disabilitie, hath taken away all hopes and desires of publishing any work of mine own&#146;. Devoting himself to the works of others, he was probably also the historian who collected, but never published, information on Nicholas Ferrar.<br>
<br>In 1659 Oley returned to Great Gransden, where Sir John Hewett of Waresley in Huntingdonshire gave him some furniture, and on 9 July 1660 he was restored to his fellowship by order of the same earl of Manchester. Through the &#145;voluntary mediation&#146; of Gilbert Sheldon, now bishop of London, he was presented on 3 August 1660 to the third prebendal stall of Worcester Cathedral. Now financially secure, he was able to leave his fellowship in 1663 and to be generous. In 1664 he was the leading benefactor of the brick school house at Gransden, which he endowed with &pound;20 a year. He built brick houses for six poor people on his own freehold land, leasing them for one thousand years to the churchwardens for the time being at a peppercorn rent, and he erected a vicarage. To King's College, Cambridge, he gave &pound;100 for putting up canopies and pillars for stalls in the chapel. Having given a pulpit to Gransden church in the first months of his incumbency in 1633, in 1681 he provided wainscot seats for the chancel.<br>
<br>When Oley's edition of Jackson's works was reissued in 1673, again with a dedication to Sheldon, much was made in the preface of the feebleness of the editor's memory &#145;by the suddain ingruence of a Lethargy or Apoplexy&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Collection of the Works of &hellip; T. Jackson</span>). None the less, in 1678, despite his age, Oley was first choice of the fellows at Clare to replace Theophilus Dillingham as master, although he was not elected because he could not be contacted in time. On 8 November 1679 Oley was collated on the nomination of Bishop Gunning, his old pupil, to the archdeaconry of Ely, but the following year he resigned this preferment because of doubts of his ability to discharge its duties. However, he retained the stall at Worcester until his death, being then &#145;the senior Prebendary of venerable Memory&#146;  (G. Hickes, <span class="italic">Seventeen Sermons of the Reverend and Learned Dr William Hopkins</span>, 1708, xiii). He established a weekly celebration of the eucharist in the cathedral.<br>
<br>Oley died at Great Gransden on 20 February 1686, and in accordance with his will was buried there on the night of 22 February. The will, dated between 23 May 1684 and 18 October 1685, was considered noteworthy for its generosity to church causes. One feature was its provision of books for poor parishes: records of borrowing by parishioners exist into the eighteenth century. To the dean and chapter of Worcester Oley gave &pound;200 for buttresses for the choir and the chapel at the east end of the cathedral; to Clare College he left 100 marks (&pound;67) for building a library, and &pound;10 to the descendants of John Westley, the builder of the college. The junior fellows of King's College received &pound;50 for the construction of a walkway for their recreation. A charity was set up in his name, with assets in Warmfield, Kirkthorpe, and Great Gransden, overseen by the fellows of Clare College and still operating with limited resources in the late twentieth century.<br>
