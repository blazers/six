<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Owen,  John</span>  (1616&#150;1683), <span class="occ">theologian and Independent minister</span>, was born at Stadham (Stadhampton), Oxfordshire, the second son of Henry Owen, vicar of Stadham, and grandson of Griffith Owen of Talhenbont, Llanegryn, Merioneth. His mother was probably Hester Owen, who married the minister John Hartcliffe following Henry's death. Owen described his father as &#145;a non-conformist all his daies&#146;  (J. Owen, <span class="italic">A Review of the True Nature of Schisme</span>, 1657, 38).<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareeruntil1651"></a>Education and early career until 1651</h2>With his older brother William, Owen entered the grammar school of Edward Sylvester in Oxford about 1626, and in 1628 became a student at Queen's College, Oxford, whence he matriculated on 4 November 1631. At Queen's he was tutored in logic and philosophy by Thomas Barlow, the future bishop of Lincoln, and in music by Thomas Wilson. After graduating BA on 11 June 1632 he proceeded MA on 27 April 1635, and shortly thereafter was ordained deacon by John Bancroft, bishop of Oxford.<br>
<br>Owen left Oxford in 1637 to become chaplain to Sir William Dormer of Ascott, near Wing, Buckinghamshire, and shortly thereafter accepted a similar position with John Lord Lovelace of Hurley, Berkshire. When civil war erupted in 1642 Lovelace supported the royalists, but Owen moved to London, where a sermon on <span class="roman">Matthew</span> 8: 26 by an unidentified preacher at St Mary Aldermanbury had a profound impact on him.<br>
<br>On 2 March 1643 the committee on printing in the House of Commons ordered the publication of Owen's first book, <span class="italic">Theomachia &hellip; or, A Display of Arminianism</span> (1643), which was dedicated to the committee on religion in the House of Lords. In this work he refuted the Arminians by examining the doctrines of predestination, original sin, irresistible grace, and the extent of the atonement, as well as attacking the &#145;idol&#146; of free will. Offered the living of the parish church at Shepway, Kent, by Sir Edward Scott, Owen declined, preferring to accept the sequestrated rectory of Fordham, Essex, from parliament in July 1643. Shortly thereafter he married Mary Rooke (<i>d</i>. 1676), possibly the daughter of William Rooke, a Coggeshall clothier. Their first child, John, was baptized on 20 December 1644; ten other children followed, of whom all but one died in infancy or childhood.<br>
<br>By 1644 Owen had adopted presbyterian views, as the preface to his second book, <span class="italic">The Duty of Pastors and People</span> (1644), indicates. Although chary of congregational polity, he had ministered to his flock in their homes as well as in the parish church since 1643. The importance he attached to nurturing his congregants is reflected in <span class="italic">The Principles of the Doctrine of Christ</span> (1645), which contains a short catechism for children and a longer one for adults that expounds on the answers in the brief version. Nominated by Sir Peter Wentworth, MP for Tamworth, and by Scott's stepson, Thomas Westrow, MP for Hythe, Owen preached a fast sermon on <span class="roman">Acts</span> 16: 9 to the Commons on 29 April 1646. Published as <span class="italic">A Vision of Unchangeable Free Mercy</span> (1646), it included a section entitled &#145;A short defensative&#146; about polity and toleration in which he advocated liberty for the godly to gather as congregations of visible saints, with the right to celebrate communion at least monthly. He envisioned such congregations as existing alongside parish churches governed according to presbyterian polity; his ecclesiology was thus in transition, a result of his having read John Cotton's <span class="italic">The Keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven</span> (1644). Owen's evolving views on polity may explain why the patron of Fordham, Sir John Lucas, opted not to present him to the living following the death of the sequestrated incumbent, John Alsop. On 18 August 1646 the House of Lords ordered that Owen be inducted as vicar of Coggeshall, Essex, on the recommendation of Robert Rich, earl of Warwick; he had been ministering there since May. He not only served the parish church but founded a gathered congregation. His embrace of congregational polity was complete by 1648, as reflected in his exposition of it in <span class="italic">Eshcol: a Cluster of the Fruit of Canaan</span> (1648). He argued that separating from false, unwarranted ways of worship was required by the precept to avoid the sins of others&#151;a position he defended in a meeting of ministers at Colchester on 31 March 1648.<br>
<br>Troubled by the spread of Arminianism, including its espousal by Thomas Moore, a Lincolnshire sectary, in <span class="italic">The universality of Gods free-grace</span> (1646), Owen wrote a major rebuttal, <span class="italic">Salus electorum, sanguis Jesu</span> (1648), dedicated to Warwick. In this erudite attack on the doctrine of universal atonement he expounded the necessity of Christ's satisfaction in redeeming the elect. His insistence that faith was procured by Christ's death and was irresistibly bestowed on the elect prompted various ministers to suspect him of antinomianism, including the belief that justification preceded faith. Richard Baxter responded in a lengthy appendix to <span class="italic">Aphorismes of Justification</span> (1649), insisting that faith was not the only condition for justification, and John Horne criticized Owen in <span class="italic">Thura aneogmene</span> (1650). Owen replied to Baxter in <span class="italic">Of the Death of Christ</span> (1650), accusing his protagonist of misrepresenting his views; <span class="italic">Salus electorum</span>, he averred, had been written to accommodate &#145;vulgar capacities&#146; rather than adhere to scholastic precision  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 10.435). Moreover, he insisted that he did not embrace the antinomian doctrine that justification preceded believing.<br>
<br>In summer 1648 Owen accepted an invitation to minister to the parliamentary troops besieging Colchester, on which occasion he met Henry Ireton and other senior army officers. Following Colchester's surrender he preached two sermons on <span class="roman">Habakkuk</span> 3: 1&#150;9, one at Colchester and the other at Romford. Published as <span class="italic">Eben-ezer: a Memoriall</span> (1648), they held out the promise that God always had instruments to destroy his enemies and deliver his church from oppression. Owen came to view the execution of Charles I as an example of such judgment, and in his sermon to the Commons on the day after the regicide he stressed that subjects, because of &#145;their retained sovereignty&#146;, were accountable for their sovereign's misrule and were therefore empowered to impose restraints. The destruction of a king was justified if he commanded &#145;unrighteous things&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 8.136). Published as <span class="italic">A Sermon Preached &hellip; January 31</span> (1649) it included an epistle to the Commons affirming Owen's belief in the imminent establishment of the millennium, although he never suggested precise dates. Appended to the sermon was a brief for toleration, though he acknowledged the state's right to punish heretics and schismatics who disrupted the peace or employed violence to thwart the gospel's progress. He preached before the Commons again on 19 April, reiterating his apocalyptic message that &#145;in these latter days, as antichristian tyranny draws to its period&#146; Christ would &#145;shake and translate the political heights, governments, and strength of the nations&#146; in preparation for the inauguration of his kingdom  (ibid., 8.260); this sermon was published as <span class="italic">Ouranon ourania</span> (1649). Again he preached before the Commons, this time on 7 June, a service of thanksgiving to mark the Levellers' defeat at Burford. Dismissing them as poor creatures who had &#145;dashed themselves against the rock&#146; he spoke of the imminent Irish expedition, which he saw in the context of Christ's battle &#145;with all the world&#146; for their abuse of the divine ordinances  (ibid., 9.215). Entitled <span class="italic">Human Power Defeated</span> this sermon was published posthumously in 1721. On 8 June the Commons asked the committee for Oxford to consider appointing Owen head of a college.<br>
<br>After hearing Owen preach to the Commons, Oliver Cromwell met him at Thomas Fairfax's house and sought his services as chaplain for the Irish expeditionary force; the house approved the appointment on 2 July 1649 and provided a stipend of &pound;100 p.a. He went to Ireland in August, but was not at the siege of Drogheda, having remained in Dublin to preach, and to examine the statutes of Trinity College for possible revision. On 8 March 1650, by which time he had left Ireland, the council of state made him a trustee to administer the property of the archbishop, dean, and chapter of Dublin for the support of Trinity College.<br>
<br>Owen preached to the Rump Parliament on 28 February 1650, a day of humiliation. Published as <span class="italic">The Stedfastness of Promises</span> (1650) the sermon exhorted MPs to stand firm in the face of the hydra of Catholics, prelatists, and Scottish covenanters that threatened the gospel, the propagation of which in Ireland must be supported. On 8 March the council appointed him to preach to it every Sunday afternoon during the coming year, in return for which he received lodgings at Whitehall and a stipend. Two months later the council sought his assistance to advise a committee about the appointment of ministers for regiments lacking them. On 28 June he left for Scotland with Cromwell's forces, preaching <i>en route</i> at Newcastle and Berwick. In the latter sermon, preached in part on 21 July, completed at Edinburgh in November, and published as <span class="italic">The Branch of the Lord</span> (1650), he expounded the qualities of the gospel church. By late August he had returned to London, but in the aftermath of the battle of Dunbar the council, heeding Cromwell's request, ordered him back to Scotland. While there he helped persuade Alexander Jaffray, provost of Aberdeen, that the Scots had erred in supporting the Stuarts.<h2>
<a name="TheOxfordyears16511658"></a>The Oxford years, 1651&#150;1658</h2>Following his return to London early in 1651 Owen was appointed dean of Christ Church, Oxford, on 18 March. The previous incumbent, Edward Reynolds, had refused to take the engagement, and Joseph Caryl, who had accompanied Owen to Scotland as a chaplain, declined the post. However, Caryl succeeded Owen as a preacher to the council of state on 23 June. Within two years the new dean was complaining that his academic duties intruded on his studies and professing that he had forgotten &#145;the portion of polite learning&#146; that he once had  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 10.492&#150;3). In addition to his responsibilities at Oxford he was asked in July 1651 to review the statutes of Trinity College, Dublin. At the service of thanksgiving on 24 October 1651 for Cromwell's victory at Worcester, Owen exhorted the Rump to consider &#145;the constant <i>appearing of God</i> against every party that, under any colour or pretence whatever, have lifted up themselves for the reinforcement of things as in former days&#146;  (ibid., 8.336). The theme of this sermon, published as <span class="italic">The Advantage of the Kingdome of Christ</span> (1651), was God's shaking of worldly realms. Four days later parliament ordered Owen and Thomas Goodwin to preach at Oxford, and for the next five years they alternately delivered sermons from the pulpit of St Mary's. On 6 February 1652 Owen preached the funeral sermon for Henry Ireton in Westminster Abbey, likening him to Daniel in his wisdom, love for his people, and righteous administration; dedicated to Henry Cromwell the sermon was published as <span class="italic">The Labouring Saints Dismission to Rest</span> (1652).<br>
<br>On 10 February 1652 Owen and other ministers submitted a petition to parliament condemning the Racovian catechism and calling for the more effective propagation of the gospel. The Rump responded by appointing two committees, one of which, with Owen as a member, examined the catechism, laying the foundation for its condemnation and burning. In consultation with select ministers, including Owen, the other committee produced a report whose expanded version was published in March as <span class="italic">The Humble Proposals</span>, with Owen's name heading the list of authors. It called for a university trained clergy, the introduction of examiners and ejectors to remove unfit ministers, the retention of tithing, and the suppression of astrology. Owen and his fellow Independents wanted to add sixteen doctrinal principles that no one could legally attack in print or sermons, and these were appended to an edition of the proposals published in December (but dated 1653). The Rump had made modest progress in dealing with the proposals when Cromwell dismissed it in April 1653.<br>
<br>In the meantime Owen's responsibilities continued to expand. On 29 July 1652 he and eight other ministers were asked to advise Charles Fleetwood and his colleagues about the provision of clergy for Ireland; on 15 June Cromwell named him to Oxford's board of visitors; and on 26 September he became vice-chancellor of the university following Cromwell's nomination. When Cromwell put the chancellorship in commission on 16 October, Owen served as first commissioner. He was also appointed by the council of state to the committee responsible for licensing translations of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. With eleven other Independent ministers he wrote a letter to parliament, printed in Henry Whitfield's <span class="italic">Strengthe out of Weaknesse</span> (1652), endorsing missionary activity among North American Indians. Once more he was invited to preach to parliament, this time on 13 October 1652, a day of humiliation. Published as <span class="italic">Christs Kingdom and the Magistrate's Power</span> (1652) his sermon reflected his concern about the need to expedite the propagation of the gospel and the role of magistrates in this endeavour. In the same year he published <span class="italic">The Primer</span>, complete with a short catechism, <span class="roman">Bible</span> passages, and prayers; printed with parliamentary authorization it may have been intended as an official alternative to the old <span class="italic">Primer and Catechisme</span>.<br>
<br>Owen reportedly proposed names for the nominated assembly, and he and Walter Cradock preached to it on 25 August 1653. On 2 September he supported Oxford's petition to the assembly to maintain the universities and support godly ministers. His name was on a list of ministers the assembly formulated to eject and settle clergy throughout the country, but nothing came of this. When Cromwell convened a conference of prominent presbyterian, Independent, and Baptist ministers in late October to promote unity Owen participated. There is no evidence that he was troubled by the dissolution of the nominated assembly on 12 December. Eleven days later he was created doctor of divinity; his diploma noted that he was &#145;in disputando strenuus &amp; acutus&#146; (&#145;rigorous and sharp in discussion&#146;; Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>: <span class="italic">Fasti</span>, 2.179), some indication of which is suggested in his 1653 treatise, <span class="italic">Diatriba de divina justitia</span>. The need for this work grew out of public disputations at Oxford in which Owen, castigating the Socinians, asserted that God's justice made the punishment of sin essential; without Christ's atonement, by which Owen meant the rendering of satisfaction for sin, God could not forgive sinners. When his espousal of this doctrine in Oxford disputations prompted criticism from &#145;many very respectable theologians&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 10.486), he defended his views in <span class="italic">Diatriba</span>, which included a refutation of the tenets of William Twisse, Samuel Rutherford, and the Socinian Johannes Crellius. Owen was in turn attacked by Thomas Gilbert in <span class="italic">Vindiciae supremi Dei dominii</span> (1655) and briefly by Baxter in <span class="italic">The Unreasonableness of Infidelity</span> (1655).<br>
<br>By 1654 Owen had completed a lengthy polemical work, <span class="italic">The Doctrine of the Saints' Perseverance</span> (1654), which he had begun in 1651 in response to John Goodwin's <span class="italic">Apolutrosis apolutroseos</span> (1651). On 7 January 1652 Robert Abbott, minister of St Augustine's, London, reported to Baxter that he had told Owen &#145;it was expected he should doe something to satisfy the Church&#146; about Goodwin's work, and Owen replied that he had already begun a critique  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Richard Baxter</span> 1.73). The result was a prodigious defence of the doctrine of &#145;the certain, infallible continuance of the love and favour of God unto the end towards his, those whom he hath once freely accepted in Jesus Christ&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 11.120). He grounded this doctrine on God's immutable nature, the absolute purpose of God in saving the elect, the covenant of grace, and God's faithfulness in keeping his promises. In the lengthy preface Owen attacked Henry Hammond's argument, in <span class="italic">Dissertationes quatuor</span> (1651), for the authenticity of the seven Ignatian epistles, which provided evidence for the early development of episcopacy. Hammond had directed his disquisition against the Huguenot David Blondel and various English puritans, and Owen came to their defence in his preface, only to be refuted by Hammond in <span class="italic">An Answer to the Animadversions</span> (1654).<br>
<br>In addition to engaging in scholarly debate Owen was active on other fronts. In the aftermath of the failed nominated assembly, on 9 January 1654 he, Thomas Goodwin, Philip Nye, and Sidrach Simpson sent a letter to the Independent churches denouncing the Fifth Monarchists because their views &#145;cut the sinews of all Magistracy&#146; and endangered England's peace  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Carte 81, 16<i>r</i>&#150;17<i>v</i>). This did not dissuade the Fifth Monarchist John Tillinghast from quoting Owen in an epistle dedicatory to Cromwell in <span class="italic">Generation Work</span> (1654). Owen and Goodwin were among a group of ministers that met with Cromwell on 28 February, probably to discuss a religious settlement. Several days later the council asked Owen to refute <span class="italic">A Twofold Catechism</span> (1654) by the Socinian John Biddle, which led to the publication of <span class="italic">Vindiciae evangelicae</span> (1655), another expansive tome, the focus of which was an exposition of the atonement and justification by imputed grace, with commentary as well on the covenant between God the father and his son. In Owen's judgement Biddle's theology was &#145;a composure of rotten posts and dead men's bones&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 12.84), but he also lashed out against the &#145;middle way&#146; championed by Mo&iuml;se Amyraut. In an appendix to <span class="italic">Vindiciae evangelicae</span> Owen responded to the critique of his treatise <span class="italic">Of the Death of Christ</span> by Baxter in <span class="italic">Rich: Baxter's Confession of his Faith</span> (1655), and the latter thereupon replied to Owen in <span class="italic">Certain Disputations of Right to Sacraments</span> (1657).<br>
<br>Owen advised Cromwell on the establishment of the commission for the approbation of public preachers in March 1654, and on the 20th was named a trier. On 28 August he and his brother William were appointed assistants to the Oxford commission for the ejection of ignorant and scandalous clergy and schoolmasters. Judging from his intervention with the Berkshire commission on behalf of Edward Pococke, who had been accused of reading the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> in his parsonage at Childrey, he probably undertook these duties in a spirit of moderation. This is also suggested by his connivance at John Fell's use of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> in services in the Oxford home of Dr Thomas Willis, although he opposed the awarding of an MA degree to Robert South in 1657 because the latter insisted on using the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> in Christ Church. Owen was elected to represent the university in the first protectoral parliament, but as a minister he was disqualified by the <span class="roman">Clerical Disabilities Act</span> of 1642; Anthony Wood's assertion that he renounced his ordination in an attempt to claim his seat is implausible. Although he could not sit in parliament he advised a parliamentary committee on the fundamentals of religion&#151;in practice, the limits of orthodoxy. The resulting document, <span class="italic">The Principles of Faith</span>, derived from the proposals of 1652, was, according to Baxter, largely the work of Owen, &#145;the great doer of all that worded the Articles&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1, pt 2, 198). He was also a signatory of a letter from ministers and university professors to evangelical churches on the continent endorsing John Durie's efforts to organize an evangelical protestant alliance. When Cromwell wanted to forward his religious agenda he consulted with Owen, Stephen Marshall, and three others on 31 October 1654. Owen's loyalty to the regime was manifest in March 1655 when he raised a troop to defend the university during the Penruddock uprising, and he offered to form another in Berkshire. In December he sat on a committee that discussed Menasseh ben Israel's proposal to readmit Jews to England, and the same month Major-General James Berry suggested to the secretary of state, John Thurloe, that Owen could propose means to supply ministers for Anglesey.<br>
<br>Early in 1656 Owen experienced assorted tribulations, including a raging fever that claimed the lives of two of his sons and made others in his household ill. Rumours circulated in April that he was troubled by John Wilkins's marriage to Cromwell's sister, fearing this would undermine his influence with the lord protector. Moreover his stipend was two years in arrears, prompting the council to decree in August that he should be paid the &pound;200 he was owed and &pound;100 p.a. out of undervalued delinquents' estates. During the spring he had been apprehended at Whitehall Gate, probably because of a private debt, though he was quickly released and the men responsible for his arrest were themselves apprehended.<br>
<br>As vice-chancellor Owen endeavoured to reform Oxford, in part by making traditional academic dress optional, but convocation rejected his plan in April 1656. He dressed in fashionable clothing, had long hair, and wore Spanish leather boots and a cocked hat. Although he enjoyed some support among Oxford visitors they refused to reduce convocation's powers, nor was he able to reform the traditional festivities and ceremonies at the end of the academic year. Unlike his friend John Wilkins he displayed little interest in curricular reform, especially the new science, although Ralph Josselin heard reports that Owen had attempted to suppress the study of philosophy and had &#145;become a great scorne&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Ralph Josselin</span>, 374). While John Locke was at Christ Church from 1656 to 1660 he was influenced by Owen. During his Oxford years Owen may have ministered to a gathered congregation, but there is no evidence to support George Vernon's later accusation that one met in Christ Church.<br>
<br>In addition to his academic duties Owen continued to serve the Cromwellian regime. With Caryl and Peter Sterry he advised the council in June 1656 on which books and manuscripts in the library of the late James Ussher should be purchased by the state, and on 17 September he preached at the opening of parliament (<span class="italic">God's Work in Founding Zion</span>, 1656). He returned to preach a fast sermon on 30 October, published as <span class="italic">God's Presence with a People</span> (1656). Meanwhile, on 16 October he was appointed to a committee to advise the council on augmenting clerical stipends. He was with Cromwell when George Fox met him to discuss the suffering of Quakers, and in the aftermath of James Nayler's symbolic re-enactment of Jesus' entry into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday Sir John Reynolds wanted Owen, Caryl, or Nye to converse with Nayler in the hope that &#145;some good may be wrought upon him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Thomas Burton</span>, 1.79&#150;80). Owen encountered Quakers at St Mary's, where they justified wearing their hats during prayer because he declined to remove his own while reciting the Lord's prayer. In 1657 he advised Cromwell how to reconcile the Scottish resolutioners and the remonstrants, who had the support of the English presbyterians and Independents respectively.<br>
<br>Amid these activities Owen continued to write. A devotional work on sanctification, <span class="italic">Of the Mortification of Sinne in Believers</span> (1656), reached a third edition in 1668. In <span class="italic">Vindiciae evangelicae</span> he had found an affinity between the teachings of Hugo Grotius and the Socinians, whereupon Hammond had come to Grotius's defence, most recently in <span class="italic">A Second Defence of &hellip; Hugo Grotius</span> (1655). To this Owen responded in <span class="italic">A Review of the Annotations of Hugo Grotius</span> (1656). In the following year he prepared some meditations for the press that had been composed about 1650; published as <span class="italic">Of Communion with God</span> (1657) they explored the believer's fellowship with each member of the Trinity. He remained firmly opposed to Arminianism; his letter endorsing George Kendall's attack on Arminian tenets in <span class="italic">Fur praedestinatus</span> (1651) was printed in Kendall's <span class="italic">Fur pro tribunali</span> (1657). Owen incited another controversy when he published <span class="italic">Of Schisme</span> (1657), in which he argued that protestants were not guilty of schism for leaving the Catholic church, nor were Independents who organized gathered congregations in accord with Christ's command, opting &#145;to reform themselves, by reducing the practice of worship to its original institution&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 13.199). To this work Daniel Cawdrey retorted in <span class="italic">Independencie a Great Schism</span> (1657), accusing Owen and his colleagues of opening the door to all heresies and blasphemies by insisting on toleration for themselves; &#145;Causeless Separation from a true Church&#146;, he insisted, &#145;is Schism&#146;  (p. 64). At the urging of the Independent minister John Beverley, Owen replied in <span class="italic">A Review of the True Nature of Schisme</span> (1657 [1658]), in which he acknowledged the influence of Cotton's <span class="italic">Keyes</span> on him. When Cawdrey continued his attack in <span class="italic">Independency Further Proved to be a Schism</span> (1658) Owen responded to his criticism of Cotton in <span class="italic">A Defence of Mr John Cotton</span> (1658). Giles Firmin joined the fray with a critique of Owen in <span class="italic">Of Schism</span> (1658).<br>
<br>The offer of the crown to Cromwell on 23 February 1657 troubled Owen and may explain his angry departure from London in early March. Yet on the 19th of that month the journalist Marchamont Nedham jokingly told Cromwell &#145;that <i>vox populi</i> said Mr. Nye should be Archbishop of Canterbury, and Dr. Owen of York&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1656&#150;7</i>, 318). Siding with the military officers opposed to monarchy Owen acceded to the request of colonels Thomas Pride and John Desborough to draft a petition to Cromwell in May urging him to reject the crown. Although a proposal for Owen to preach a fast sermon to the Commons on 27 February 1657 had sparked a two-hour debate, his supporters, led by Colonel John Jones and Dennis Bond, persuaded parliament to settle the estate of Donadea and other lands in co. Kildare on him to provide his stipend of &pound;100 p.a., hitherto paid by the exchequer.<br>
<br>After Cromwell resigned the chancellorship of Oxford in July 1657 and was replaced by his son Richard, Owen suggested his own replacement as vice-chancellor; John Conant, rector of Exeter College, succeeded him on 9 October. Shortly before this Owen and Goodwin had ceased their afternoon lectures at St Mary's, although Owen remained dean of Christ Church. Cognizant of his concern about the plight of persecuted protestants, on 4 November the council appointed him to a committee dealing with those in Piedmont, Poland, and Bohemia. A correspondent of Joseph Williamson reported in December that he was giving &#145;opposition&#146; lectures at St Peter's-in-the-East, Oxford, but these were almost certainly not critical of the Cromwellian regime, judging from the innocuous content of his book <span class="italic">Of Temptation</span> (1658), the substance of which had been delivered from an Oxford pulpit. He followed this work with a substantive defence of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> as the word of God, <span class="italic">Of the Divine Originall</span> (1659), completed in September. Appended to this were <span class="italic">Pro sacris scripturis</span>, which denounced the Quaker belief in continuing revelation, and <span class="italic">A Vindication of the Purity and Integrity of the Hebrew and Greek Texts</span>, which criticized Brian Walton's edition of the <span class="italic">Biblia polyglotta</span> on the grounds that its inclusion of variant readings would strengthen the Catholic claim that the <span class="roman">Vulgate</span> was the only authoritative text. He also contended that the vowel points in the Hebrew text were as old as the letters and thus part of inspired scripture. Both appendices provoked replies: Walton defended himself in <span class="italic">The Considerator Considered</span> (1659), and Samuel Fisher denounced Owen (and others) in <span class="italic">Rusticus ad academicos</span> (1660).<h2>
<a name="Theexperienceofdefeat16581663"></a>The experience of defeat, 1658&#150;1663</h2>Owen was not with Cromwell at the latter's death in September 1658, though he attended the state funeral. Shortly thereafter he played a major role at the Savoy conference, helping to draft <span class="italic">A Declaration of the Faith and Order</span>, which was presented to Richard Cromwell on 14 October. In Baxter's judgement Owen and Nye prevented old wounds from healing by insisting on more fundamentals in the declaration than he deemed necessary. Owen's ties to the military were again evident when parliament designated 4 February 1659 a day of humiliation and debated the order in which four ministers&#151;Owen and the presbyterians Reynolds, Thomas Manton, and Edmund Calamy&#151;would preach; John Lambert wanted Owen to be first, whereas the civilian republican Arthur Hesilrige thought he should be last; a compromise let him preach third. In his sermon <span class="italic">The Glory and Interest of Nations</span> (1659) he registered no objection to unbelievers serving as magistrates, but he expected little good from them. By mid-March he had gathered a congregation whose members included such prominent officers as Fleetwood, Desborough, William Sydenham, James Berry, William Goffe, and possibly Lambert, and they would soon be meeting in Wallingford House. It was there that the grandees, with Owen participating, decided to force Cromwell to dissolve parliament on 22 April. Arriving late Manton thought he heard Owen call for Cromwell's removal, yet as late as 3 May Owen supported the retention of a titular protector.<br>
<br>In the face of growing support for the Rump Parliament's recall Owen urged the grandees to summon it, and he produced a list (obtained from Edmund Ludlow) of about 160 MPs who had served at Westminster since Pride's Purge. On 8 May, one day after the Rump was reconvened, he preached to its members. As the situation deteriorated following the Rump's demand for Cromwell's resignation on 24 May Owen tried to rally Independent churches, but the key congregation at Yarmouth refused to become involved. When Sir George Booth and his royalist supporters rebelled, the council on 15 August ordered Owen to raise a troop of horse to defend Oxford University. The unsettled times prompted leading Independents, including Owen, and presbyterians to engage in discussions in September aimed at unity, but they had little success. On 24 September the council commissioned him and Thankful Owen to preach at Whitehall on Sundays until 1 December. There was presumably a moment of levity in September when Owen was duped by a London merchant claiming to be an Eastern Orthodox patriarch, but the Baptist John Tombes was in earnest the following month when he sought the assistance of Owen and others to prevent toleration for Catholics; whether Owen saw him is unknown.<br>
<br>In late October copies of George Monck's <span class="italic">Declaration of the Officers of the Army in Scotland</span> reached Owen and his colleagues. Alarmed by Monck's threat to intervene militarily to restore the Rump, which had been ousted anew by the army on the 13th, Owen (whose name heads the list) and eighteen others wrote to Monck on the 31st, announcing the dispatch of a delegation to convey their concerns. When Monck replied, insisting on the restoration of parliamentary government, Owen wrote on 19 November, warning that a civil war between the armies would destroy the good old cause and &#145;the sober godly in both Nations&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 106&#150;8). In a letter to Owen, William Greenhill, and William Hooke dated 23 November, Monck professed hope for a peaceful resolution. Six days later he wrote to Owen insisting that England must be liberated from military rule and pressing him to urge Fleetwood to restore the Rump. On 13 December Owen and thirteen others wrote to Monck arguing that the crucial issue was not whether parliament should convene but the threat to their lives if their cause should be overthrown. Despair set in when Owen, Desborough, and Sydenham learned on the 22nd that the troops dispatched to besiege Portsmouth had changed sides. As Monck's forces began their slow march toward London, Owen and Nye were reportedly attempting to raise &pound;100,000 to support troops committed to toleration for protestants. As Baxter assessed the events of 1659, in a passage excised from his published autobiography by its editor, he bitterly condemned Owen for doing the &#145;mainework&#146; in toppling Cromwell; Owen's &#145;parts, &amp; confidence, &amp; busybodiness, &amp; interest in those men did give him the opportunity to do his exploits&#146;  (Nuttall, <span class="italic">Journal of Ecclesiastical History</span>, 6.78).<br>
<br>On 13 March 1660 parliament deprived Owen of the deanery of Christ Church and restored Reynolds. About this time Owen moved his family to Stadham, where he lived quietly, notwithstanding attempts to implicate him in spurious conspiracies in April and November. The efforts of the earl of Clarendon and Roger Boyle, Lord Broghill, to persuade him to conform were unsuccessful. In the crackdown on suspected dissidents following Thomas Venner's Fifth Monarchist rebellion in January 1661, troops seized six or seven cases of pistols from his house, where he was hosting two former Oxford colleagues, Thankful Owen and Francis Johnson. Much of his time was now devoted to writing. In <span class="italic">Theologoumena pantodapa</span>, published at Oxford in 1661 and reprinted at Bremen (1684) and Franeker (1700), he surveyed the history of theology throughout biblical times and argued that it was most accurately expounded by Calvinists. His views on set prayers, particularly the implications for the Lord's prayer, had been criticized by Thomas Long in <span class="italic">An Exercitation Concerning the &hellip; Lords Prayer</span> (1658) and Meric Casaubon in <span class="italic">A Vindication of the Lord's Prayer</span> (1660), and Owen took up this and related issues in <span class="italic">A Discourse Concerning Liturgies</span> (1662). Composed while deliberations for the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> were underway this work repudiated liturgies as neither apostolic nor in accord with the practice of Christian churches during the first three centuries <span class="smallcap">AD</span>. In 1662 he also rebutted the work of the Franciscan John Vincent Canes, whose <span class="italic">Fiat lux</span> (1661) proclaimed the benefits of Catholicism as a faith of truth and moderation in contrast to the destructive zeal of protestant sects. Owen's anonymously published critique, <span class="italic">Animadversions on &hellip; Fiat lux</span> (1662), condemned key Catholic beliefs and practices while denouncing Canes as a modern day Celsus, the Platonist critic of apostolic Christianity. Canes replied in <span class="italic">An Epistle</span> (1663), prompting Owen to compose <span class="italic">A vindication of the &#145;Animadversions&#146;</span> (1664), a more detailed critique of Catholicism in which he charged the Catholic church with idolatry, apostasy, heresy, and schism. Canes defended himself in <span class="italic">Diaphanta</span> (1665; reprinted in <span class="italic">Three Letters</span>, 1671), which Owen ignored.<h2>
<a name="Thequestfortoleration16631669"></a>The quest for toleration, 1663&#150;1669</h2>After the ejection of nonconforming ministers in August 1662 Owen hoped &#145;that God who hath now hid his face, will repent him of the evill&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 130). By 1663 he had settled in London near Moorgate, although he continued to spend time at his Stadham home. He met often with Thomas Goodwin and Henry Jessey, and was probably involved with the declaration submitted to the king on 27 February 1663 calling for liberty of conscience and affirming the theology embodied in the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>, though differing on certain matters of discipline and polity. The delegation that presented the paper to Charles also denounced the recent Tong plot and Fifth Monarchist principles. In August and October 1663 Owen was invited to become the minister of the congregational church in Boston, Massachusetts; he considered the offer, and as late as June 1666 the people of Boston thought that he might accept, though ultimately he resolved to stay in England.<br>
<br>Owen enjoyed limited protection, thanks to such friends as Philip, Lord Wharton, Arthur Annesley, earl of Anglesey, and reportedly Aubrey de Vere, earl of Oxford. With other Independent ministers he participated in a lecture at the house of the alderman Henry Ashurst. He went to Oxford in January 1664 in the hope of persuading Thomas Gilbert to become president of Harvard College, and the following month he thought he was near death because of a severe &#145;fluxe&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., Rawlinson MS, 53). Although he was indicted at Oxford on 27 February 1665 for holding conventicles at Stadham he was not incarcerated. He persuaded Barlow, now provost of Queen's College, Oxford, to seek assurances from Clarendon that he would henceforth be exempt from such prosecution, but they were not forthcoming. From 1664 onwards Owen's wife and children lived primarily at Stoke Newington, where his daughter Judith died in May 1664 and his son Matthew in April 1665. Their hosts were Charles Fleetwood and his new wife, Mary, widow of Sir Edward Hartopp. Here Owen gathered a small congregation that included various former Cromwellian military officers&#151;Fleetwood, Desborough, Berry, Lieutenant-Colonel Jeffrey Ellaston, and Captain Griffith Lloyd&#151;as well as Bridget Bendish, daughter of Henry Ireton and granddaughter of Cromwell; William Steele, former lord chancellor of Ireland; Samuel Lee, former dean of Wadham College, Oxford; Sir John Hartopp; and Anglesey's wife and daughter. Owen's circle of friends also came to embrace the fifth or sixth Baron Willoughby of Parham, Sir Trevor Roper, Sir William Morice, and Richard Hampden. Owen and his wife were occasional guests of the Whartons at Woburn, and they stayed for a time at Theobalds, Hertfordshire, with Sir Edward Abney's wife (Caryl's daughter) and preached in their London house.<br>
<br>Owen played a major role in the debate over freedom of conscience that began in 1667 in anticipation of the expiry of the <span class="roman">Conventicle Act</span>. Published anonymously Owen's powerfully argued tract, <span class="italic">Indulgence and Toleration Considered</span> (1667), proclaimed that &#145;God hath not Warranted or Authorized any man to <i>inforce</i> [people] to <i>Act contrary to their Light</i>, and that perswasion of his Mind and Will which he hath given them in their own Consciences&#146;  (p. 17). Physical compulsion in religion was not practised by the apostolic church, inculcated hypocritical compliance, was abhorrent to the English, and historically failed to extirpate the views that it was designed to eradicate. Owen's companion tract, <span class="italic">A Peace-Offering</span> (1667), also published anonymously, complained bitterly that conformists were ignoring the doctrinal orthodoxy of dissenters and instead insisting on &#145;a Precise and Determinate Judgement and Practise in things of very <i>Little</i> Concernment&#146;  (p. 13). Dissenters, he asserted, had no desire to impose civil or ecclesiastical polity on the nation, and the indulgence they sought was not conducive to sedition as their opponents alleged. He was in turn attacked by Richard Perrinchief in <span class="italic">Indulgence not Justified</span> (1668).<br>
<br>The tracts by Owen along with others by John Humfrey and John Corbet set the stage for the king and parliament to consider indulgence and comprehension in 1668. Wilkins, now bishop of Chester, prepared proposals for comprehension that eventually led to a bill written by Sir Matthew Hale, whereas Owen drafted a bill that would provide liberty of worship for dissenters whose theology was orthodox. Owen's draft included provisions for the registration of ministers and their congregants, the exclusion of nonconformists from public office, and the payment of &#145;public dues&#146; to parishes. Supporters of Gilbert Sheldon, archbishop of Canterbury, defeated both measures. With justification Baxter blamed the prelates for the defeat of comprehension, but Manton held Owen responsible for having advocated a different proposal. Accompanied by the presbyterian Samuel Annesley, Owen thereupon called on Manton to defend the benefits of indulgence.<br>
<br>In the meantime Baxter was encouraged by Owen's new catechism, <span class="italic">A Brief Instruction</span> (1667). Its defence of congregational polity elicited a critique by Benjamin Camfield, <span class="italic">A Serious Examination</span> (1668), but Baxter found reason for hope in Owen's perceived rejection of two congregational principles, namely, that the entire gathered church as a society has the authority to admit or excommunicate members, and that the congregation bestows this power at ordination to church officers. Overestimating Owen's flexibility Baxter drafted a statement of religious fundamentals (later published as part two of <span class="italic">Church Concord</span>, 1691) and asked Owen to evaluate it. The latter found it too lengthy, preferring that it be limited to key points relevant to the union of presbyterians and Independents. Owen thought that Baxter was not firm enough in rejecting Socinianism, and he also disapproved of Baxter's stress on the magistrate's authority to repress errors and heresy. Fifteen months after discussions between the two men had begun, an exasperated Baxter requested the return of his papers, and Owen complied, remarking only that &#145;I am still a well-wisher to those Mathematicks&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, pt 3, 69). Although nothing came of these proceedings the reputation of the two men was probably never higher during the Restoration era, for Barlow observed in January 1669 that Owen had kissed the king's hand, adding that he had heard reports that Owen or Baxter would receive the next vacant bishopric. This would have pleased Barlow, who thought that such an appointment might ensure the continuance of episcopacy and the church's patrimony, although he acknowledged that some people would have preferred the termination of episcopacy rather than the elevation of either man to a bishopric.<h2>
<a name="Abeaconofnonconformity16681678"></a>A beacon of nonconformity, 1668&#150;1678</h2>Owen continued to write at a prodigious pace. <span class="italic">The Nature &hellip; of Indwelling Sin</span> (1668), <span class="italic">A Practical Exposition upon Psalm CXXX</span> (1668), and <span class="italic">A Brief Declaration &hellip; of the Doctrine of the Trinity</span> (1669) were intended for godly readers, whereas his massive study of <span class="roman">Hebrews</span>, published in four folio volumes between 1668 and 1684, was composed primarily for biblical scholars and ministers; this is especially evident in the first volume, which explores questions of authorship and language. (<span class="italic">A Brief Declaration</span> elicited a response from the Quaker George Whitehead, <span class="italic">The Divinity of Christ</span>, 1669.) Other works reflected Owen's interest in polemics. Chief among these at this point in his career was <span class="italic">Truth and Innocence Vindicated</span> (1669), composed after Baxter had declined his request to answer the attack on nonconformists by Samuel Parker in <span class="italic">A Discourse of Ecclesiastical Politie</span> (1669). Castigating Parker's profuse use of abusive language as an unacceptable means of debate Owen rebutted his core charge that nonconformists were subversives. Baxter praised Owen's reply, adding that this work enhanced his stature among dissenters, but Parker ridiculed Owen's use of Latin phrases as &#145;superannuated Pedantry&#146; and dismissed his book as &#145;nothing but Cavil and vulgar Talk&#146;  (S. Parker, <span class="italic">A Defence and Continuation</span>, 1671, A3<i>r</i>, 3). When Owen defended Sunday as the Christian sabbath in <span class="italic">Exercitations Concerning &hellip; a Day of Sacred Rest</span> (1671), he was attacked by the sabbatarian William Saller in <span class="italic">An Examination of a Late Book</span> (1671). In a lengthy preface to Theophilus Gale's <span class="italic">The True Idea of Jansenisme</span> (1669), Owen asserted that Augustine's doctrine of grace had been taught by some Catholics in every age of church history. Another brief work, <span class="italic">The State of the Kingdom</span> (perhaps published only posthumously) was part of an unsuccessful endeavour by nonconformists to prevent passage of a new <span class="roman">Conventicle Act</span> in March 1670.<br>
<br>Despite the heavy writing schedule Owen performed numerous ministerial functions. Beginning in 1669 he participated in a combination lectureship at Hackney with presbyterians and other Independents, and he also preached at White's Alley, Moorfields. With eleven others he and Goodwin wrote to the governor of Massachusetts on 25 March 1669 protesting against recent legislation against Baptists, arguing that they should be free as long as they refrained from disturbing the peace. Owen's influence extended well beyond London, for in May 1669 he and George Griffith sought to resolve a dispute involving elders in the Independent church at Hitchin, Hertfordshire, and two years later he participated in the ordination of Matthew Meade at Stepney and recommended Thomas Hardcastle for the pastorship of the open membership congregation at Broadmead, Bristol. When the ministers and magistrates of Massachusetts sought advice on raising money and recruiting students and a president for Harvard College they wrote to Owen and others in August 1671, and he and his colleagues responded in February. The presbyterian Henry Oasland remarked to Baxter about this time that Owen &#145;hugely riseth in the esteeme &hellip; of this Country&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Richard Baxter</span> 2.86), but he also had his critics, such as the conformist George Vernon, author of a vitriolic attack, <span class="italic">A Letter to a Friend</span> (1670). To Vernon, Owen was the former darling of Cromwell, a purveyor of falsehood and uncharitableness, and &#145;a Trumpet to sound an Alarum to Sedition and Rebellion&#146;  (p. 14). Owen briefly responded in <span class="italic">Reflections on a Slanderous Libel</span> (1670), and a friend anonymously came to his defence in <span class="italic">An Expostulatory Letter</span> (1671).<br>
<br>When the new <span class="roman">Conventicle Act</span> came into effect in May 1670 Owen resolved to continue his meetings and suffer the consequences, but he also reiterated the case for religious freedom for nonconformists in <span class="italic">An Account of the Grounds and Reasons</span> (1670?), a broadside, and protested against their unjust treatment in <span class="italic">The Present Distresses</span> (1671?) and <span class="italic">A Word of Advice</span> (1671?). Charles II consulted him about a possible declaration of indulgence in August and September 1671, and following its proclamation he and three other congregationalists thanked the king on 28 March 1672. Although Owen apparently did not obtain a licence for himself he assisted others to procure them. The leathersellers gave him permission to use their hall if it were licensed, but there is no record that a licence was issued. Following Caryl's death in 1673 his congregation merged with that of Owen, who ministered to them at Leadenhall Street, where he was assisted by Isaac Loeffs (1673&#150;82), Robert Ferguson (1674&#150;<i>c</i>.1679), and David Clarkson (1682&#150;3; sole pastor, 1683&#150;6). Against the background of the indulgence Owen published an eirenic work, <span class="italic">A Discourse Concerning Evangelical Love</span> (1672), recognizing the Church of England as a genuine body of Christ, but insisting anew that separation from it was not schism.<br>
<br>Although Owen did not shun polemics they were beginning to take their toll. About 1672 he complained to John Eliot that he had &#145;a dry and barren spirit&#146; and that &#145;there is scarce any one alive in the world who hath more <i>reproaches</i> cast upon him than I have&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 154). This may explain why, in 1673, he reneged on a promise to write an epistle to John Bunyan's <span class="italic">Differences in Judgment about Water-Baptism</span>. As the Parker controversy raged he read the proofs of Andrew Marvell's <span class="italic">The Rehearsal Transpros'd</span>, but he was satirized and denounced as a dangerous rebel by Parker's defender, Richard Leigh, in <span class="italic">The Transproser Rehears'd</span> (1673). When the latitudinarian William Sherlock criticized Owen's older work, <span class="italic">Of Communion with God</span>, in <span class="italic">A Discourse Concerning &hellip; Jesus Christ</span> (1673), the latter responded in <span class="italic">A Vindication of some Passages</span> (1674), attributing Sherlock's errors to ignorance or prejudice; Sherlock countered in <span class="italic">A Defence and Continuation</span> (1675), castigating Owen as an antinomian. Owen was also criticized by the Wiltshire rector Thomas Hotchkis, who commended his zeal but accused him of dishonouring the Church of England while abetting Catholicism (<span class="italic">A Discourse Concerning the Imputation</span>, 1675).<br>
<br>To some extent Owen must have been frustrated by the perceived need to engage in polemic, for his fundamental interests lay elsewhere. In 1674 he published the first of what would eventually be a massive five-volume work on the Holy Spirit. In <span class="italic">Pneumatologia</span> he ex`lored the nature of the Holy Spirit as part of the triune deity, its dispensations in the <span class="roman">Old</span> and <span class="roman">New Testaments</span>, and its regenerative work. The second volume, <span class="italic">The Reason of Faith</span> (1677), explained the basis for believing that the <span class="roman">Bible</span> was God's word, and the third, <span class="italic">Synesis pneumatike</span> (1678), discussed God's mind as revealed in scripture. <span class="italic">A Discourse of the Work of the Holy Spirit</span> (1682) explored its role in prayer, and the final volume, <span class="italic">Two Discourses</span> (1693), expounded the Holy Spirit as comforter and source of spiritual gifts. <span class="italic">Pneumatologia</span> elicited a critique from William Clagett, a royal chaplain, in <span class="italic">A Discourse Concerning the Operations</span> (1678), but Humfrey came to Owen's defence in <span class="italic">Peaceable Disquisitions</span> (1678). Chiding Owen's critics, including Parker, for their contemptuous treatment of him, Humfrey complained that an entire generation of men was ready to attack almost anything Owen wrote, hoping to &#145;render that worthy person quite useless to the Church&#146;  (p. 1).<br>
<br>If this was the goal of Owen's critics they failed. During summer and autumn 1674 he advised congregational churches in Lancashire, Cheshire, and Yorkshire about whether to admit Oliver Heywood's presbyterian church to their association. About this time he began participating in the morning exercises against popery in Southwark (several of these sermons were published), and he was also involved in the merchants' lectures at Pinners' Hall. While convalescing at Tunbridge Wells, Kent, in 1674, he explained his position on toleration to James, duke of York, and shortly thereafter had an audience in London with the king, who gave him a thousand guineas to aid suffering dissenters. Although an informer reported in February 1676 that his meeting was dangerous he was left alone, probably because he now enjoyed the support of the duke of Buckingham as well as Anglesey and Wharton. According to John Asty, Owen's early biographer, he was later arrested by two informers and discharged by Sir Edmund Godfrey. In June 1677 he obtained an order from Heneage, Lord Finch, the chancellor, directing Bishop Barlow to release Bunyan from Bedford gaol, and the same year he reputedly recommended that Bunyan publish <span class="italic">The Pilgrim's Progress</span> with his own printer, Nathaniel Ponder.<br>
<br>Following the death of Owen's wife in 1676 he married (by licence dated 21 June 1677) Dorothy, the wealthy widow of Thomas D'Oyley of Chiselhampton, Oxfordshire, and daughter of a Mr Michel of Kingston Russell, Dorset. They lived at Kensington and later at Ealing.<br>
<br>Owen was described by Hooke as &#145;valetudinarious and crazy, often down&#146; in early August 1677  (<span class="italic">Mather Papers</span>, 8.584). His depressed mood may have been triggered by his dismay at the perceived spread of Arminianism and Socinianism, a concern that led him to write <span class="italic">The Nature of Apostasy</span> (1676). With its exposition of imputed grace <span class="italic">The Doctrine of Justification</span> (1677) was a natural sequel. Doctrinal concerns also prompted him to compose <span class="italic">Christologia</span> (1677), a treatise on the person of Christ, including the hypostatical union of the divine and human in one person.<h2>
<a name="Intheshadowofpersecution16781683"></a>In the shadow of persecution, 1678&#150;1683</h2>As reflected in some of his unpublished sermons (DWL, MS L6/3, 4), the spectre of persecution disturbed Owen by early 1678, when informers were again watching his meetings. During late spring or early summer 1679 he worked with Baxter and four other ministers to organize petitions calling for a new parliament. Against the background of the alleged Popish Plot he wrote <span class="italic">The Church of Rome No Safe Guide</span> (1679), arguing that Catholicism destroyed Christianity's simplicity, glory, and power. This was a time, he told his congregation in December 1679, of great trials and dangers, a belief shared by the ministers with whom he associated. In these circumstances it seemed propitious to call for unity among protestants, but in such a manner, as he asserted in <span class="italic">Some Considerations about Union</span> (1680), that outward compulsion would not be employed. Disturbed by Edward Stillingfleet's <span class="italic">The Mischief of Separation</span> (1680), which accused nonconformists of schism, he countered in <span class="italic">A Brief Vindication</span> (1680) that unity of faith and obedience bound conformists and dissenters. This sparked replies from Stillingfleet, <span class="italic">The Unreasonableness of Separation</span> (1681), and S. R., <span class="italic">An Impartial Vindication</span> (1680). Owen responded to the former in <span class="italic">An Enquiry</span> (1681), clearly angered by Stillingfleet's contention that nonconformists promoted the Catholic threat. Owen was in turn answered by William Sherlock in <span class="italic">A Discourse about Church-Unity</span> (1681) and William Saywell in <span class="italic">Evangelical and Catholick Unity</span> (1682).<br>
<br>Meanwhile, in July 1680 the secretary of state, Jenkins, had summoned Owen, Baxter, and four other ministers to request their support in return for a declaration against Catholicism. That autumn Owen and others reviewed a proposal drafted by London merchants and revised by Bristol clergy for an accord between presbyterians and congregationalists. It may have provided the inspiration for Owen's exposition of ecclesiastical polity in <span class="italic">The True Nature of a Gospel Church</span> (1689), completed shortly thereafter. In a sermon preached in December 1680 while the second Exclusion Parliament was in session, <span class="italic">Seasonable Words for English Protestants</span> (1690), he denounced those who impeded the work of godly ministers as well as Church of England clergy who tried to monopolize the ministry. Subpoenaed for violating the <span class="roman">Five-Mile Act</span> and recusancy in November 1681 Owen and twenty-one other ministers faced anticipated fines of &pound;9680. As the plight of dissenters worsened he may have been aware that the earl of Shaftesbury and his confidants had considered using force to compel Charles to bar James's succession after the House of Lords rejected an exclusion bill in November 1680. In <span class="italic">An Humble Testimony</span> (1681) he worried that some men were proposing desperate means to resolve the crisis, for &#145;the Conflict of their <i>Counsels</i> and <i>Designs</i> encreaseth our Danger, and is like to prove our Ruine&#146;  (A3<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>The threat of persecution did not stop Owen from preaching. His unpublished sermons from this period reflect his sense of divine judgment on the nation, but exhort the godly to &#145;wait quietly and patiently for what will bee the End of Gods Judgments&#146;  (DWL, MS L6/3, 10 Feb 1682). Informers reported that he did not mention the king in his prayers, but not until November 1682 was he again prosecuted, this time for having violated the <span class="roman">Corporation</span> and Elizabethan <span class="roman">Conventicle Acts</span>. The threat of Catholicism coupled with persecution led Owen to espouse a doctrine of active resistance in 1682. Like Calvin he endorsed the right to take up arms to defend religion as long as the leaders of resistance &#145;had a legal Right and Power to protect themselves and their subjects&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief and Impartial Account</span>, 1682, 12). On 19 April 1683 a grand jury presented him for preaching to conventicles. Following the disclosure of the Rye House plot, he was arrested, examined at Whitehall on 27 June, and released. Although the government lacked sufficient evidence to prosecute him he apparently was aware that the duke of Monmouth and his associates had been planning an uprising to force Charles to exclude James from the succession, for Monmouth confessed to the king that Owen, Matthew Meade, and George Griffith knew about the conspiracy. This was confirmed by the Scottish conspirator William Carstares and the plotter Richard Goodenough. Moreover, the rebels' paymaster, Francis Charlton, had met Ferguson, who was associated with both the Monmouth cabal and the Rye House plotters, at Owen's house. Although Owen was not prosecuted for his alleged knowledge of the Monmouth conspiracy, on 21 July the Oxford convocation ordered that his January 1649 sermon be burned.<br>
<br>Owen continued to write during his final years. <span class="italic">Phronema tou pneumatos</span> (1681) captured the essence of nonconformist spiritual experience, <span class="italic">A Letter Concerning &hellip; Excommunications</span> (1683) denounced the use of excommunication as a tool to enforce conformity, and <span class="italic">Meditations and Discourses on the Glory of Christ</span> (1684), the testimony of a dying man, reflected on Christ as mediator. Of his last works the most controversial was <span class="italic">An Answer unto Two Questions</span> (1720), which included twelve arguments against the participation of dissenters in the worship of the established church. Framed in consultation with four other congregationalists the arguments circulated in manuscript, provoking an attack by Baxter in <span class="italic">Catholick Communion Defended</span> (1684). Owen was by then dead, but he was defended by the anonymous authors of <span class="italic">A Vindication of &hellip; John Owen</span> (1684) and <span class="italic">Bellarminus junior enervatus</span> (1684), to which Baxter replied in <span class="italic">Catholick Communion doubly Defended</span> (1684).<br>
<br>Owen's health was failing in January 1683, when he was diagnosed as having a kidney stone too large to expel. With death imminent he wrote to Fleetwood on 22 August, observing that he was &#145;leaving the Ship of the Church in a Storme&#146;  (DWL, MS L6/1, no. 11). Following his death at his home in Ealing on 24 August 1683 he was buried in Bunhill Fields on 4 September, with numerous nobles and gentry in attendance. He had no surviving children or grandchildren. In his will, dated 23 March 1683, he bequeathed funds to his sometime assistants Clarkson (who preached his funeral sermon), Ferguson, and Loeffs, and to his fellow congregationalist John Collins. He owned property at Stadham and Souldern, Oxfordshire, and Eaton, Berkshire. Auctioned on 26 May 1684 (<span class="italic">Bibliotheca Oweniana</span>, 1684), his library of nearly 2800 items included Latin and Greek manuscripts, the patristics, church history, poetry, geography, and philology as well as a rich collection of theological and pious works.<h2>
<a name="Reputation"></a>Reputation</h2>As early as the 1650s Owen had a substantial reputation as reflected not only by his sermons to parliament, his close association with Cromwell, and his vice-chancellorship, but also by the dedication to him of books by Lewis du Moulin (<span class="italic">Oratio auspicalis</span>, 1652) and the mathematician John Wallis (<span class="italic">Johanni Wallisii &hellip; elenchus geometriae Hobbianae</span>, 1655). During his career he contributed numerous epistles of his own to the works of other authors. On a visit to England in 1656 the Swiss protestant Johann Zollikofer befriended him. Although Anthony Wood thought Owen &#145;spent most of his time in continual agitation to carry on the cause, to promote his own interest, and gain the applause of the people&#146;, he acknowledged that Owen was regarded as the head of the Independents in 1658  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4.113, 633). He was also the butt of satire: it was possibly Thomas Ireland who in 1654 likened Owen as an orator to &#145;an <i>Ass</i> mumbling a thistle&#146;  (T. Ireland, <span class="italic">Momus elencticus</span>, 1654, 2), and about 1660 an anonymous satirist claimed that he could &#145;scarce visit a Tavern, or Country Alehouse, but forth comes some of the Learned Works of <i>John Owen</i> &hellip; as if [he] were cut out to entertain all sorts of Guests&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 117). A survey of nonconformists about 1672 depicted him as still a leading Independent, and Roger Williams addressed the epistle of <span class="italic">George Fox Digg'd Out</span> (1676) to Owen and Baxter. Among his admirers the Newcastle congregationalist Ambrose Barnes referred to him as England's Calvin, and the presbyterian John Humfrey lauded him as a scholar and gentleman. By the 1680s his works were read by students at Charles Morton's nonconformist academy, and the wealthy merchant Samuel Moyer entrusted Owen and Collins with money to distribute to the indigent. Some of his critics likewise testified to his stature; the secretary of state, Jenkins, deemed him &#145;the Bell-weather of Independents&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/341, p. 158), Saywell described him as &#145;the great Advocate for the Independents&#146;  (<span class="italic">Evangelical and Catholick Unity</span>, 1682, A3<i>v</i>), John Fell, bishop of Oxford, thought he was a remarkable man, and one of Jenkins's correspondents referred to &#145;the late famous Dr Owen&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 29/437/65). In the 1690s opponents of the antinomians such as Daniel Williams and William Lorimer referred more often for support to Owen than Baxter.<br>
<br>The verdict of modern readers has been mixed. While acknowledging Owen's intellect Samuel Taylor Coleridge thought that his treatment of Baxter during their abortive exploration of presbyterian&#150;congregationalist unity reflected &#145;a very chilling want of open-heartedness&#146; as well as resentment of Baxter  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.347). In 1946 Geoffrey Nuttall thought that Owen had perhaps received excessive attention, and his style has justifiably been described as ponderous and comprehensive. Yet he was indisputably the leading proponent of high Calvinism in England in the late seventeenth century.<br>
