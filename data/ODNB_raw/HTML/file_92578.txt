<span class="headword">Donaldson <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Warwick]</span>, Dame  (Dorothy) Mary</span>, Lady Donaldson of Lymington  (1921&#150;2003), <span class="occ">mayor of London</span>, was born on 29 August 1921 at The Square, Wickham, near Fareham, Hampshire, the oldest child and only daughter in the family of four children of Reginald George Gale Warwick (<i>d</i>. 1956), who kept an agricultural merchants' shop, and his wife, Dorothy Alice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bennett, a teacher, who was the first woman to be elected to her local council. She was educated at Portsmouth high school before leaving at sixteen to spend a year in France, learning French in Paris and teaching English at a teachers' training college in Chartres. On her return to England in 1939 she began to train as an orthopaedic nurse at the Wingfield Morris Orthopaedic Hospital in Oxford. Her training continued after 1941 at the Middlesex Hospital in London. She qualified as a state registered nurse in 1946. On 6 October 1945 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/96005/', "John Francis Donaldson (1920&#150;2005)")</script>, son of Malcolm Donaldson, a gynaecologist. A captain in the Royal Signals at the time of their marriage, he was called to the bar in 1946, and became a High Court judge in 1966. Knighted the same year, and created Baron Donaldson of Lymington in 1988, he was master of the rolls from 1982 to 1992. Settling in Croydon, she devoted the early years of her marriage to bringing up her children, one son and two daughters, but she was already active in the community as founder and chairman of the Upper Norwood Townswomen's Guild, and a member of the management committee of Croydon General Hospital.<br>
<br>When the Donaldsons moved to the Middle Temple in the City of London in 1959 she became a nursing superintendent in the City branch of the British Red Cross Society, and in 1960, nominated by Lord Denning, became a JP for Inner London, sitting on the south Westminster bench at Bow Street and Marlborough Street magistrates' courts. She was interested in serving in local government, but disliked party politics, and in 1966 decided to stand for election to her local authority, the court of common council of the corporation of London, all of whose members stand as independents. Although there had never been a woman member, there was no rule barring women, and in a by-election in which she campaigned with the slogan &#145;What is Farringdon Without Mary&#146;, she was elected councillor for the ward of Farringdon Without, with the largest vote ever recorded, in a three-cornered contest that included another woman. At the time she had no ambition to become lord mayor but it soon became apparent that she was an excellent committee chairman, good at getting things done, and after serving on eleven council committees, representing the City on the inner London education authority, serving as governor of several London schools, including the City of London School for Girls, and as governor of hospitals such as the London Hospital and Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, she was invited to stand for election to the court of aldermen. When she was elected alderman for Coleman Street ward in 1975, she in effect agreed to begin training to be lord mayor. She was elected sheriff in 1981, and with her fellow sheriff took it in turns to be on duty all day at the central criminal court and to accompany the lord mayor in all his official duties. She had expected to become lord mayor in 1989, but following the resignations of several ahead of her in the queue, in 1983 she was elected as the first woman lord mayor. She was made a GBE shortly afterwards. She refused to be called &#145;lady mayor of London&#146;, and certainly not &#145;lady mayoress&#146;, insisting that she had been elected to the office which carried the title of &#145;lord mayor&#146;. Likewise, she was always &#145;chairman&#146;, and not &#145;chair&#146;. She maintained she was no feminist, distancing herself from those she referred to as &#145;women's libbers&#146;, but she did believe in equal opportunities.<br>
<br>As lord mayor, Donaldson took as her theme &#145;It's people that matter&#146;, and threw herself energetically into her year in the Mansion House. The lord mayor was not only the leading citizen of the City of London and spokesman for the City's financial and business community, and as such had to attend daily official lunches, receptions, and dinners, but also acted as host for the nation, welcoming any visiting head of state with a banquet: she entertained President Mitterrand of France and the emir of Bahrain. In addition she travelled abroad promoting the City of London and British exports, including visits to Japan and North America. She respected the ceremonies and traditions of the City, and her only concession was to forgo the traditional knee breeches in favour of black silk dresses and velvet suits.<br>
<br>As a former nurse and later a cancer sufferer herself&#151;she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1974 and underwent two mastectomies&#151;Donaldson was closely involved with cancer charities. Having already served as chairman of the Women's National Cancer Control Campaign from 1967 to 1969, which set up the first cervical screening caravan, and vice-president of the British Cancer Council in 1970, in 1984 she was invited by Vicky Clement-Jones to join the steering committee that set up the British Association of Cancer United Patients (BACUP), a cancer information service for patients and their families, launched in 1985. She was its president from 1985 to 1993, and during these years was willing to talk publicly about her experience of breast cancer, in order to raise awareness and encourage women to seek early diagnosis.<br>
<br>Perhaps the most important thing that Donaldson did was to serve as chairman of the voluntary (later interim) licensing authority for human in vitro fertilization and embryology, set up by the Medical Research Council and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists on the lines recommended by the Warnock report in 1984. The birth of the first &#145;test-tube baby&#146; in 1978 had shown that in vitro fertilization (IVF) could overcome infertility, but this had caused much public concern about where the new techniques might lead. The committee chaired by Dame Mary Warnock recommended that IVF should continue to be available subject to licensing and inspection, and that research on embryos should be allowed up to fourteen days from fertilization. Nevertheless the opponents of IVF were well organized, and although Enoch Powell's 1985 <span class="roman">Protection of the Unborn Child Bill</span> to ban all research on test tube embryos was talked out at the committee stage, it was felt that there should be a body responsible for licensing and monitoring IVF clinics until government legislation had been passed. Donaldson said the Powell bill showed &#145;profound ignorance &hellip; and a lack of humanity&#146;, and called for a bill based on fact  (cuttings file, priv. coll.). Although such legislation was expected within two years, the <span class="roman">Human Fertilization and Embryology Bill</span> was not passed until 1990, and in 1991 the interim licensing authority was replaced by a statutory body.<br>
<br>In the 1990s, although still active in London as a member of the Press Complaints Commission from 1991 to 1996 and first chairman of the Banking Ombudsman Council from 1985 to 1994, Donaldson and her husband, who stepped down from being master of the rolls in 1992, spent more time at their home in Lymington, Hampshire. Theirs was a close and very successful marriage, and an equal partnership: when they took up sailing, a passion for many years, they soon decided there would have to be two captains and no crew. A woman of tremendous energy, with a warm personality and good sense of humour, in retirement Donaldson was a member of the committee of the League of Friends of Lymington Hospital and a patron of Oakhaven Hospice, Lymington. She died at the latter on 4 October 2003, of a brain tumour, and was buried five days later. She was survived by her husband and their three children.<br>
