<span class="headword">Haberkorn,  Johann Christoph</span>  (<em>c.</em>1720&#150;1776), <span class="occ">printer</span>, was probably born in northern Germany. About his family origins and upbringing nothing is known, but by the summer of 1746 he was certainly in London, marrying Sarah Burscoe in St George's, Mayfair, on 7 September of that year. By early 1749 Haberkorn had set up as an independent printer with his partner Johann Nicodemus Gussen and had begun paying rates on a property of the north side of Gerrard Street, Soho.<br>
<br>One of the earliest productions of the Gerrard Street press was a duodecimo edition of Luther's <span class="roman">New Testament</span> published early in 1751, but certainly in the press during 1750. This was announced in an advertisement printed in the <span class="italic">Daily Advertiser</span> shortly before Christmas 1750. It would be printed &#145;mit neuen Buchstaben und auf fein Papier&#146; (&#145;with new type and on fine paper&#146;; <span class="italic">Daily Advertiser</span>, 22 Dec 1750, 4). In the preface to the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, Haberkorn and Gussen describe their motive in setting up a German press in London as &#145;entirely in order to print good, improving works that would promote true Christianity&#146;  (p. 4). Certainly most of their early productions are octavo sermons or devotional works by Friedrich Michael Ziegenhagen, preacher at the German court chapel in St James's. In their preface Haberkorn and Gussen also mention various target groups for the sale of this material, including German-speaking schoolchildren, German professionals and tradesmen who had moved to London, charitable persons who would be disposed to buy a number of copies to distribute among the indigent German poor, and German-speaking protestants in the North American colonies.<br>
<br>In the same month as they were announcing the completion of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> Haberkorn and Gussen were arrested:<blockquote>on a charge of having printed at Gerrard Street, St. Ann's Parish, Soho, for James Marmaduke, bookseller in St. Martin's Lane, five hundred copies of a book entitled <span class="italic">Morning and night prayers with the litanies and prayers recommended to be said in Catholic families</span>.</blockquote>They appear, however, to have recovered quickly from this setback  (Mosher, June 1978). Haberkorn's partner is no longer mentioned after 1753, by which time Haberkorn had himself become a widower. On 17 November 1753 he married &#145;Ann Weston, spinster, a minor&#146;, at St George's, Hanover Square, London. Haberkorn now acquired a family: John George Haberkorn was baptized on 1 September 1754 at St Anne's, Soho, and a daughter, Mary Haberkorn, followed him on 5 January 1756  (Chapman, 50).<br>
<br>Having established himself as a specialist for printing with Fraktur types in German with the capability of printing in English books, Haberkorn now quickly expanded into other areas of the market. He appears to have made something of a speciality of programme books, for example, in both French and Italian. In the mid-1750s Haberkorn began to diversify his business further, taking him in quite unexpected directions. In 1754 he was responsible for the letterpress in Thomas Chippendale's <span class="italic">The Gentleman and Cabinet-Maker's Director</span>, one of the most celebrated productions of its kind in this period. The publication, which includes 160 plates, may have influenced other authors in the field to seek Haberkorn's services. Prominent among them was William Chambers, whose <span class="italic">Designs of Chinese Buildings, Furniture, Dresses and Utensils</span> of 1757 (sold by the author &#145;next door to Tom's Coffee House, Russel-street, Covent-Garden&#146;) was the first of a number of his works printed by Haberkorn. As with the Chippendale, Haberkorn's name is omitted from this first edition, but the printer's ornaments are undoubtedly his, and he is named as the printer on the French version that appeared in the same year.<br>
<br>It is known that Haberkorn had lost his second wife by 1758 because, as her executor, he had entered into what was clearly a bitter legal dispute with his mother-in-law by November of that year. He had left Gerrard Street by December 1759, moving to nearby Grafton Street, about half-way down on the south side. When the &#145;new&#146; John Haberkorn of Grafton Street re-emerges in 1761, the list of the publications printed by him reads very differently from that of ten years earlier: of the titles so far identified, not a single one is in German. In 1762 Haberkorn embarked on probably his most ambitious project to date: the first volume of James &#145;Athenian&#146; Stuart's and Nicholas Revett's <span class="italic">Antiquities of Athens</span>, one of the most significant English architectural publications of the period. The engravings are found not only as separate plates but also well integrated with the letterpress. It is remarkable that standard bibliographies of British architectural writers omit any mention of Haberkorn's contribution to the project, although it surely establishes him among the most innovative and sophisticated printers of the period. Haberkorn was clearly pleased with the solution for the title-page for <span class="italic">The Antiquities of Athens</span> because a similar &#145;archaic&#146; or &#145;architectural&#146; quality can be found on the title-page of another large work he printed in 1762: an edition of Boccaccio's <span class="italic">Decamerone</span> printed for John Nourse.<br>
<br>Mortimer's <span class="italic">Universal Director</span> of 1763 lists &#145;Habberkorne, John. Grafton-street, Soho&#146; firmly among the leading tradesmen of London  (Maxted, 15). In the same year he took his first recorded apprentice, John Jones, indentured for &pound;10. After 1763, however, no further grand illustrated works are associated with Haberkorn's name; most of the titles known to have been printed by him during the next two years are again devotional works in German. It must be assumed his business was failing by this time; he had certainly stopped paying the rates on the Grafton Street property by May 1766. Not unusually, the chancery case against his in-laws was still in progress in the following year and a document dated 19 June 1767 shows that Haberkorn was by then living in the parish of St George, Southwark, although his name continues to appear in imprints with the Grafton Street address during that year. If the details are unclear, it seems certain that the business was effectively handed over to the German printer and bookseller Carl Heydinger during 1767. Apparently abandoning the chancery case and leaving his children in London, Haberkorn returned to Germany, probably in late 1767 or 1768.<br>
<br>Haberkorn went to Altona, now a part of Hamburg but at that time a separate entity and a dependency of the Danish crown. In 1771 he was married for the third time; his new wife was Gesine Metta Spieringk or Spiering. On 15 May 1772 he was arrested again, for reprinting a pamphlet regarded as favourable to Caroline, queen of Denmark, George III's sister, now disgraced after the fall and execution of her lover Count Struensee. After three years' imprisonment Haberkorn received a pardon on 16 March 1775, but survived only a further eighteen months, dying, probably in Altona, on 8 August 1776.<br>
<br>Haberkorn was an innovative entrepreneur prepared to take risks in response to a rapidly developing market. Unexpectedly, he turns out to have been associated with some of the most ambitious titles printed in London during the century. His printing shop could handle a range of languages, undertaking major projects and producing presswork of the highest quality. His role in Anglo-German cultural exchange during the mid-eighteenth century was clearly significant.<br>
