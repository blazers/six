<span class="headword">Bateson,  Gregory</span>  (1904&#150;1980), <span class="occ">anthropologist and communications theorist</span>, was born on 9 May 1904 at Grantchester, Cambridgeshire, the youngest of three sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30641/', "William Bateson (1861&#150;1926)")</script>, zoologist and geneticist, and his wife, (Caroline) Beatrice (1870?&#150;1941), daughter of Arthur Durham and his wife, Mary Ellis; his parents were both English. Bateson attended Warden House (1913&#150;17) and Charterhouse (1917&#150;21) schools, and then Cambridge University (BA, 1926; MA, 1930).<br>
<br>Bateson's father, also a Cambridge man, was renowned for championing the work of Gregor Mendel on genetic mutation, at a time when work on the evolution of species focused in narrowly Darwinian terms on natural selection. Gregory Bateson became equally innovative (and idiosyncratic) in rediscovering for anthropology an aesthetic holism which he associated with the poet William Blake. In efforts to elucidate a pervading unity underlying all the world's phenomena, he made incisive contributions to communication theory, family therapy, dolphin studies, and ecology&#151;and was recognized in these fields sometimes with more alacrity and respect than in his &#145;native&#146; discipline and land. Only a non-specialist, interdisciplinary anthropology, he contended, could expect to treat the vast intricacies of social milieux.<br>
<br>Bateson studied anthropology at Cambridge with A. C. Haddon (having switched from part one of the natural sciences tripos). He first undertook fieldwork in New Britain, among the Baining and Sulka, and New Guinea, among the Iatmul (1927&#150;30); there he met Margaret Mead, also fieldworking, with her then husband Reo Fortune. Bateson's fieldwork resulted in an unconventional ethnography, <span class="italic">Naven: a survey of problems suggested by the composite picture of the culture of a New Guinea tribe drawn from three points of view</span> (1936; 2nd edn 1958). <span class="italic">Naven</span> concerned cultural style and form, village formation, initiation, and gender relations; it was also a disquisition on the perspectivalism or context which underlies scientists' supposedly objective inductions. In language somewhat reminiscent of the work of Ruth Benedict, Bateson spoke of the &#145;ethos&#146; (emotional tone) and &#145;eidos&#146; (intellectual patterning) of Iatmul culture. He distinguished between &#145;centripetal&#146; and &#145;peripheral&#146; mechanisms of social organization. The first was based on a complementarity of members' behaviour, different and yet compatible; and the second was based on a symmetricality&#151;the same and hence equivalent. He described how &#145;schismogenesis&#146; (&#145;complementary&#146; or &#145;symmetrical&#146;) could occur if the cumulative reactions of people or groups to one another's behaviour was not counteracted. &#145;Schismogenesis&#146; was his own term, which he used to define &#145;the origin of differentiation between groups and cultures caused by the reciprocal exaggeration of behaviour patterns and responses that may result in the destruction of the social balance&#146;  (<span class="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</span>).<br>
<br>The exponential curve of schismogenesis, and that of its opposite, mutual love, Bateson extrapolated, pertained not just to the Iatmul but universally, and is evidenced in class war, the arms race, megalomania, and true love. Indeed, the universality of feedback mechanisms, of circular or &#145;recursive&#146; causal systems, in both biology and society, was advocated by Bateson throughout his life. In advance of Habermas, Giddens, or Bourdieu, he emphasized how (in the words of his biographer, Peter Harries-Jones, <span class="italic">A Recursive Vision</span>, Toronto, 1995, 3) informations &#145;continually enter into, become entangled with, and then re-enter the universe they describe&#146;. So analysis must acknowledge the cumulative effects of interaction between entities and at the same time recognize the importance of homeostatic or steady-state systems. Preaching this at the famous Macy conferences of 1946&#150;8, together with Norbert Wiener, Bateson became one of the founders of the new science of cybernetics.<br>
<br>Bateson married Margaret Mead (1901&#150;1978), on 13 March 1936, and set out with her for an ethnographic field trip to Bali (1936&#150;8). Researching into posture, gesture, painting, childhood relationships, play, and the &#145;schizophrenia&#146; of trance, Bateson took some 25,000 photographs, some of which appeared in their joint publication, <span class="italic">Balinese Character: A Photographic Analysis</span> (1942). Bateson and Mead separated in 1948 and were divorced two years later; their daughter, Mary Catherine Bateson, wrote an insightful narrative of their lives together, <span class="italic">With a Daughter's Eye</span> (1984). Bateson had by then also exchanged St John's College, Cambridge, for the New School for Social Research, New York (1946), and then Harvard University (1947); soon he moved to the Langley Porter Clinic, University of California medical school, in San Francisco.<br>
<br>At Langley Porter (1948&#150;9) Bateson worked with psychiatrist Jurgen Ruesch and produced <span class="italic">Communication: the Social Matrix of Psychiatry</span> (1951), a book which developed Norbert Wiener's insight that &#145;information&#146; was synonymous with &#145;negative entropy&#146; or order. In other words, patterns of social interaction&#151;the habitual communication of information&#151;lie beneath life in society: its structure and order, its sense of value and propriety, and its aesthetics and cosmology. The what and the how of reiterative communication provided the vital context within which &#145;behaviour&#146; came to be learned. Indeed, learning to learn (&#145;deutero-learning&#146;) was a matter of coming to know oneself in a habitual context.<br>
<br>In 1950 Bateson married Elizabeth Sumner; they had a son, John, in 1951 and subsequently divorced. He then married Lois Cammack in 1961 and they had a daughter, Nora, in 1969. From 1949 to 1963 Bateson headed a research team at Veterans Administration Hospital, Palo Alto, California, further exploring communicative practices among dogs, otters, monkeys, and wolves, and among human alcoholics; also the place that paradox seemed to assume in the communication of play, humour, and jokes. Between 1954 and 1959 this came together in a psychotherapeutic project on schizophrenic communication which Bateson directed. Schizophrenics, it was surmised, display abnormal communicative behaviour which derives from their experiencing a repetitive pattern of paradoxical injunctions at some stage in their lives (the &#145;double-bind&#146; theory).<br>
<br>From Palo Alto, Bateson moved to be associate director of the Communications Institute at St Thomas, in the Virgin Islands (1963&#150;4), followed by an associate directorship at the Oceanic Institute, Waimanalo, Hawaii (1965&#150;72). Over nine years he worked with John Lilly on various projects exploring dolphin communication. This culminated in perhaps his most influential work, <span class="italic">Steps to an ecology of mind: collected essays in anthropology, psychiatry, evolution and epistemology</span> (1972). In this series of papers spanning his career Bateson worked to disclose the patterns connecting different points of view in an ecological field. All living organisms contributed to the patterning within an ecosystem and to its regeneration, he argued. Indeed, organism-plus-environment made a single recursive system of ongoing life, with parts and whole continuously modifying one another.<br>
<br>In 1976 Bateson was appointed to the board of regents of the University of California, a mark of the estimation in which he was now held within the American academy; but he resigned three years later in protest over the &#145;evil&#146; of nuclear weapons. His final work, <span class="italic">Mind and Nature: a Necessary Unity</span> (1979), was a Blakean reflection on the patterns&#151;complex and beautiful&#151;which connect human consciousness to much of the natural world. He died of cancer on 4 July 1980 at the Zen Center, San Francisco, California, and was cremated three days later at Marin county; his ashes were scattered at Esalen Institute cliffs, San Francisco.<br>
<br>It was said of Bateson by the celebrated psychiatrist, R. D. Laing (echoing a comment of Erving Goffman's), that he possessed &#145;the most distinctive perceptual capacities of anyone I've met&#146;  (R. Evans, <span class="italic">R. D. Laing</span>, New York, 1976, 75). Claude L&eacute;vi-Strauss, meanwhile, lauded his culture theory and Konrad Lorenz his theoretical ethology. In combining insights into culture and character formation, into the logic and paradoxes of perception and learning, into the recursive effects of messages in communicative circuits, and into the mathematics of progression and stability, Bateson was a most distinctive anthropologist. He anticipated some innovative trends in late twentieth-century anthropology, such as exploration of the culturally viable relations between &#145;nature&#146; and &#145;culture&#146;, of environmentalism, and the application of anthropology to the study of natural science. His diverse writings will continue to be mined for stimulating ideas.<br>
