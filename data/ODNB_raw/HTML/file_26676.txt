<span class="headword">Strode,  William</span>  (1601?&#150;1645), <span class="occ">poet and playwright</span>, was baptized at Shaugh Prior, near Plymouth, Devon, on 11 January 1603, probably aged one (a brother was baptized three months later, a sister in 1599); he was the son of Philip Strode (<i>d</i>. 1605), fourth son of Sir William Strode of Newnham, near Plymouth, and Wilmot (<i>d</i>. after 1620), daughter of William Houghton of Houghton Towers, Lancashire. Left fatherless at an early age, he owed his education at home, and later as a king's scholar at Westminster School, to relatives who had been impressed by his scholastic aptitude. Although his mother quickly remarried, Strode's middle-aged first cousin at Newnham, another Sir William Strode (father of the poet's namesake, the parliamentarian), probably took responsibility for him. In 1617 Strode entered Christ Church, Oxford, where he soon made his mark as a poet, contributing Latin verses to university publications from 1619 onwards. Having graduated BA in 1621 he remained at Christ Church, and was awarded MA in 1624 and BD in 1631; on 6 July 1638 he proceeded DD.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1620s Strode's English poems&#151;lyrics, elegies, and occasional pieces both serious and comic&#151;circulated widely in the university and beyond. The charming &#145;I saw faire Cloris walke alone&#146; is his best known piece. Answer-poems, parodies, ballads, and songs form a noticeable part of his corpus; &#145;A Devonshire Song&#146; uses dialect for comic effect; several elegies were written for memorial monuments. His light-hearted colloquial pieces explain his friendship with Richard Corbett, poet and dean of Christ Church, though other poems, including his best elegies, show him as less boisterous and more devout.<br>
<br>His ordination as deacon is unrecorded but he was priested in December 1628 and acquired a reputation as a &#145;most florid&#146; preacher  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, new edn, 1817, 3.151). Of his three extant sermons only <span class="italic">On Death and the Resurrection</span> (1644) is now genuinely moving; these topics often inspired Strode's best work. During Corbett's tenure of the see of Oxford (1628&#150;32) Strode became his chaplain. In 1629 he was made proctor; the same year his eloquence earned him the post of public orator, thus bringing him into contact with Laud, then chancellor of the university. Pressure of work or an altered social scene may explain subsequent changes in Strode's writing habits; the output of his English poems decreased and, while many earlier poems appear in manuscript collections (in some considerable numbers) and printed miscellanies, later ones, except &#145;The Townes New Teacher&#146; (a vigorous attack on Puritan preachers), hardly circulated at all.<br>
<br>Corbett's translation to Norwich brought Strode no benefits, although they remained friends. Advancement came through the king who, in 1635, perhaps at Laud's instigation, annexed to the post of public orator the next Christ Church canonry to fall vacant. The royal visit to Oxford in 1636 offered further opportunities; not only did Strode deliver the welcoming speech but his <span class="italic">Floating Island</span> was one of three plays performed on this occasion. Probably Laud, organizing the visit, commissioned Strode to mould public opinion; the play is political satire, allegorically attacking Burton, Bastwick, and Prynne, whom Laud arraigned in the Star Chamber shortly afterwards. The plot, later seen as prophetic, turned on rebellion and restoration. Unfortunately Strode was no playwright. Music by Henry Lawes and scenery by Inigo Jones could not redeem the piece; one spectator called it fitter for scholars than a court, another thought it the worst he had ever seen except for one at Cambridge; women in the audience found it misogynist. Unsurprisingly no rewards followed, but Henry Burton, fulminating from his London pulpit against Strode's &#145;scurrilous Enterlude&#146;, held it responsible for increasing plague &#145;and very bad weather withall&#146;  (H. Burton, <span class="italic">For God and the King</span>, 1636, 49&#150;50).<br>
<br>The Christ Church canonry, however, became Strode's on 1 July 1638. Now free to marry, he chose the daughter of a prebendary of Canterbury connected to two bishops. Mary Simpson (<i>d</i>. 1648) was seventeen or eighteen, Strode in his forties, when they married on 17 July 1642. A daughter, Jane, was born fourteen months later. His income augmented by several livings, Strode could have expected a comfortable life, had not public events intervened.<br>
<br>In February 1641, as subdean, Strode had headed the college's list of subscribers to the protestation; the following July he regretfully acknowledged Laud's resignation of the chancellorship. Soon afterwards his wife's connection Bishop Skinner was imprisoned. Strode himself was summoned before a parliamentary committee to account for the fulsome style of earlier official letters to Laud, but not charged. When war broke out his Devon family, with whom he had maintained good relations, was heavily involved on the parliament side. He himself remained at Oxford, apparently arranging his poems for publication, a project interrupted by his death on 10 March 1645; the fact that he died intestate suggests that the event was sudden and unexpected. He was buried in Christ Church Cathedral on 13 March; his grave is unmarked. His widow died on 6 February 1648.<br>
<br>A mild, reasonable, humorous man, by inclination charitable and tolerant, Strode found such attitudes increasingly difficult to maintain as the Puritan threat grew. Posthumous publication of <span class="italic">The Floating Island</span> (1655) and <span class="italic">A Sermon at a Visitation</span> (1660) shows him remembered and valued as a royalist propagandist. In troubled times and without the aid of print he was soon forgotten as a poet, contemporary reputation notwithstanding. Bertram Dobell's edition of his poetical works (1907) received little notice; but Strode's lyric gift is genuine, if minor, and his personality attractive. A fuller edition of his works (based on the holograph in Corpus Christi College, Oxford, MS 325) was produced in 1966  (Forey), and in recent years the growing interest in manuscript verse of the early seventeenth century has led to increased and deserved attention for this rewarding poet.<br>
