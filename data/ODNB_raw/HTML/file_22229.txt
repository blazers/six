<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pierrepont,  Henry</span>, marquess of Dorchester  (1607&#150;1680), <span class="occ">royalist nobleman</span>, was born in March 1607, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22230/', "Robert Pierrepont, first earl of Kingston upon Hull (1584&#150;1643)")</script>, and his wife, Gertrude Talbot (1587/8&#150;1649). He entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge, with his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22231/', "William Pierrepont")</script> at Easter 1624; another brother was the politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/94585/', "Francis Pierrepoint")</script>. In November 1627, after a majority of the Company of Nottingham decided that the Pierreponts were one of two noble families whose &#145;frendshipp and favour&#146; they wished to secure, Henry was nominated and eventually elected to represent the town. There is no record of Pierrepont's speaking or being appointed to a committee in the parliament of 1628. By 1630 he was married for the first time, to Cecilia (1613&#150;1639), daughter of Paul, first Viscount Bayning, with whom he had two daughters. After his father was created an earl on 25 July 1628 he was styled Viscount Newark but in January 1641 was called and referred to in the House of Lords as Baron Pierrepont of Holme Pierrepont (the family seat in Nottinghamshire). Pierrepont became an active member of the house and was appointed to numerous committees. On 21 May 1641 he defended the right of the bishops to sit in parliament and argued that they must participate in the making of laws they had to obey. A second speech of 24 May claimed it was lawful and convenient for the bishops to &#145;intermeddle&#146; in temporal affairs. During an increasingly heated debate on 14 December 1641 about a breach of privilege his complaint that it was not honourable for the Lords to be in such a tumult was construed as offensive to so great a high court and he was ordered to withdraw and committed to the custody of the gentleman usher. After he asked the pardon of the house on 16 December the suspension was lifted. He was one of only four lords to protest at the decision of the house to order the lord mayor of London to call a common council whenever instructed by the committee of safety. On 4 February 1642 he was given a month's leave of absence but on the twenty-fifth of the month he was among the lords asked by Charles to return to the upper house. Leave of absence was granted to him on 2 April and by 15 June he was with Charles at York, where he signed the declaration that the king did not intend to make war on parliament.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1642 Pierrepont became the leading member of the Nottinghamshire commission of array. After an address by Charles to the knights and gentry of the shire Pierrepont, who had already subscribed to the costs of raising and maintaining horse troops, led a similar appeal in Nottinghamshire. At a muster of the Nottinghamshire militia on 13 July he explained the reasons for the king's issue of a commission of array, his speech being subsequently published. On 3 August his attempt to take possession of the shire militia's gunpowder, which was kept in Nottingham, was defeated but the town prudently made a contribution from its store. The next month he was listed among those royalists against whom parliament took a particular exception. He was a member of the king's council of war in December 1642 and of the upper house of the royalist Oxford parliament. He was one of the peers who signed the letter warning the covenanters that it was a small minority of the peerage who invited them to England. In 1645 he was a commissioner for the king at the treaty of Uxbridge. In recognition of his support for the king the University of Oxford conferred on him an honorary MA degree in November 1642. Charles rewarded him in March 1645 by creating him marquess of Dorchester and a privy councillor. His request in September 1646 to compound on the terms of the Oxford articles surprised many royalists but can be explained by his serious financial difficulties. On the death of his father in 1643 he had inherited a substantial estate, mainly in Nottinghamshire, but sequestration had deprived him of most of his rental income. He claimed to have debts of &pound;15,000 without interest, which included &pound;5000 to his brother William, the parliamentarian MP for Much Wenlock, who had an interest in the estate as immediate remainder. It was William who rescued his brother and the estate when he realized Dorchester was unable to pay his composition fine of &pound;7467. In March 1647 William asked for and was granted the fine in compensation for his own losses in the war. Whether or not Dorchester had paid his creditors by 1662 cannot be established but he was in possession of estates in Nottinghamshire which he certified produced an annual revenue of &pound;8000.<br>
<br>From an early age Dorchester had been an enthusiastic bibliophile; he also established a botanical garden with an estimated 2600 species, and had a chemical laboratory. The catalogue of his library of 2101 titles, which was left to and remains with the Royal College of Physicians of London, establishes the breadth of his interests. Approximately a third of his books can be placed in the categories of law and medicine which, after the civil war, became his consuming studies. He was admitted to Gray's Inn in June 1651 and called to the bar in the following year. The decision of a peer to practise law amazed Sir Edward Nicholas, who commented: &#145;I see abundance of wealth doth not satisfy all men's minds&#146;  (<span class="italic">Nicholas Papers</span>, 1.307). The marquess's study of physic resulted in more adverse comment but was appreciated, as were his donations, by the College of Physicians, which in 1658 made Dorchester its first honorary fellow. He was admitted to the Royal Society in 1663 and later in the year appointed to its council but played no part in its proceedings.<br>
<br>After the Restoration, Dorchester was appointed a privy councillor in August 1660 and remained a member until 1673. An active member of the Lords, where his legal knowledge on the committee for petitions was particularly valuable, he was in 1662 and 1676 a commissioner to execute the office of earl marshal. In 1666 he became recorder of Nottingham. The combative side of his character, which first appeared publicly in 1633 and eventually led to a pardon for assault on Philip Kinder, reappeared in 1666 during a conference between the two houses. After the duke of Buckingham, in a scramble for a comfortable seat, had rudely removed Dorchester's elbow the exchanges descended into insults and a scuffle in which the marquess, in retaliation for the loss of his periwig, pulled the duke's hair. The peers were sent to the Tower and later brought to the Lords as delinquents but were restored to their places after they had expressed contrition for their behaviour.<br>
<br>Dorchester vigorously defended the interests of his family and their relations. In 1639 his opposition to Lord Grandison's marriage to his sister-in-law Mary Banning led to a duel but no serious injury to the combatants. His dispute with John Manners, Lord Roos (later ninth earl and first duke of Rutland), who had married Anne, his daughter and coheir, brought unwelcome publicity. When Anne returned to her husband after a separation she was found to be pregnant and was accused by Roos, who kept her a virtual prisoner, of adultery. Dorchester, who believed his daughter to be innocent of these charges, exchanged written insults and eventually challenged Roos to a duel. He used his influence at court to have her case heard by the king in privy council in 1662. Though it was decided the charge of adultery could not be proved a separation was recommended, but no settlement was agreed. When in April 1663 Anne was again pregnant Dorchester had to accept this evidence of her promiscuity and a divorce ensued. In September 1652 Dorchester had married his second wife, Catherine Stanley, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26274/', "James Stanley, seventh earl of Derby")</script>, but with no surviving male heirs the marquessate became extinct at Dorchester's death, on 8 December 1680 at Charterhouse Yard, London. Dorchester was buried at Holme Pierrepont.<br>
