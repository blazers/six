<span class="headword">Felton,  Henry</span>  (1679&#150;1740), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 3 February 1679 in the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, the eldest son of John Felton and his wife, Mary. He attended Cheney's School in Buckinghamshire, Westminster School under Dr Richard Busby, and Charterhouse in London, before matriculating at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, on 31 March 1696. Felton graduated BA in 1699 and proceeded MA in 1702. He later received the BD (1709) and DD (1712) from Queen's College, Oxford. Felton was married about 1710, and he and his wife, Susanna, had four sons and two daughters. John (<i>b</i>. 1712) and his brother William (<i>b</i>. 1713) followed their father to St Edmund Hall.<br>
<br>Felton was ordained deacon by William Lloyd, bishop of Worcester, on 6 December 1702, and ordained priest on 11 June 1704 by Henry Compton, bishop of London. He apparently preached before various congregations in London until his appointment in 1708 to serve the English church in Amsterdam. On his return to England in 1709 he became the domestic chaplain to the duke of Rutland; he went on to serve three successive dukes. Through the patronage of the duke of Rutland he was appointed to the rectory of Whitewell, Derbyshire, in 1711. The duke later presented Felton to the rectory of Barwick in Elmet, Yorkshire, a living he held from 1736 to 1740. In 1722 he was made principal of St Edmund Hall, Oxford; he served in that post for the rest of his life. In October 1739 Felton was struck by an illness that lingered on and caused him to suffer through a period of confinement; he recovered enough to deliver a final sermon at Barwick on Christmas day 1739, but soon afterwards fell ill again; he died on 1 March 1740 at Barwick, and was interred in the chancel of the church there. William Felton, in a biographical sketch of his father, records that as death approached he prepared himself for it and &#145;behaved, under his long and painful sickness with a resignation and piety becoming a Christian, and agreeable to his character as a minister of <i>Jesus Christ</i>&#146;  (Felton, preface to <span class="italic">Sermons on the Creation</span>, vii).<br>
<br>Felton's <span class="italic">Dissertation on Reading the Classics, and Forming a Just Style</span>, first published in 1709 (5th edn, 1753), served, according to Joseph Levine, as a &#145;plea for the traditional classical education, freed from some of its more pedantic characteristics&#146;  (Levine, 55). Written to instruct a young nobleman, John Roos, later the third duke of Rutland, in the affairs of society, the book showed that Felton valued the Latin writers above the Greek. Commenting on the proper method of studying the classics, modern English writers, grammar, history, and divinity, he sought to deflect criticism of the book's style by noting that he had not written this book for the &#145;grave and learned&#146;, but to instruct a &#145;young nobleman of sprightly parts, and a lively imagination&#146;  (Felton, <span class="italic">Dissertation</span>, ix&#150;x).<br>
<br>William Felton described his father's presence in the pulpit as &#145;grave and harmonious&#146;. He also describes him as a &#145;zealous defender of the truth of Christianity and of its sound doctrines&#146;  (Felton, preface to <span class="italic">Sermons on the Creation</span>, xi&#150;xii). He was a friend of the theologically orthodox whig clergyman Daniel Waterland, and was considered a whig of the school of Edmund Gibson, bishop of London. This theme is found expressed in his Lady Moyer lectures, preached at St Paul's in 1728&#150;9, which were published under the title <span class="italic">The Christian Faith Asserted Against Deists, Arians, and Socinians in Eight Sermons</span> (1732). William Felton published posthumously <span class="italic">Sermons on the Creation, Fall, and Redemption of Man</span> (1748), which contained sermons composed by his father about 1730 and preached at Whitewell, and later preached in 1736 at Barwick. Felton had originally planned to ask Daniel Waterland to revise the sermons before they were published, but he died before this could happen.<br>
<br>Besides defending the orthodoxy of the English church Felton defended the protestant settlement in the state. Some of his more politically orientated sermons condemned Francis Atterbury and offended the tories  (Ward, 140). In a sermon commemorating the death of Charles I, and preached before the House of Commons on 30 January 1734, Felton contrasted two parties, the &#145;Puritan Gaulonites&#146;, who refused to give any honour to Charles, and the &#145;Tory Herodians&#146;, who gave too much honour to the late king. He placed Christ and himself between these two extremes. Though honouring the virtues in the king, he praises the &#145;Happy <i>Constitution</i> in <i>Church</i> and <i>State</i>, as it was wonderfully restored; and afterwards <i>as wonderfully preserved</i>, is <i>now</i> in all human appearance most firmly settled and assured to us by the <i>Protestant Succession</i>&#146;  (Felton, <span class="italic">The Herodian and the Gaulonite</span>, 28&#150;9).<br>
