<span class="headword">Barber,  Samuel</span>  (1737/8&#150;1811), <span class="occ">minister of the Presbyterian General Synod of Ulster</span>, was the younger son of John Barber, a farmer near Killead, co. Antrim, and his wife, Sarah. He matriculated from the University of Glasgow in 1757 and graduated MA two years later. Having completed his &#145;trials&#146; with the presbytery of Templepatrick he was ordained at Rathfriland, co. Down, on 3 May 1763, where he ministered for the rest of his life. He subscribed to the Westminster confession of faith, though he was an advanced Arian in his theology. In 1771 he married Elizabeth (<i>c</i>.1743&#150;1833), daughter of the Revd Alexander Kennedy of Mourne; they had seven children.<br>
<br>Like many other Presbyterian clergymen Barber played a prominent role in the volunteer movement that spread throughout Ireland during the American War of Independence. He was a founder of the Rathfriland Volunteers (14 April 1779) and was soon chosen as captain of the company (24 June 1779). At the end of 1780 Lord Glerawly, a local nobleman, resigned, demanding the return of the weapons that he had originally supplied to the company. Barber organized a subscription list, and with the help of donations from volunteer companies in Belfast, Lisburn, and Newry the Rathfriland corps was rearmed. This episode is indicative of the social tensions that emerged in Ulster during these years as the &#145;independent interest&#146; sought to challenge the electoral dominance of the larger landowners. In the County Down election of 1783 Barber supported the independent candidate, Robert Stewart, later Lord Londonderry, against Lord Kilwarlin, son of the earl of Hillsborough. It was reported that some years earlier Kilwarlin had refused to contribute to the rebuilding of the Rathfriland meeting-house, replying that he would sooner give money to pull it down. Accusations were exchanged between the two men until, on 24 August 1783, Kilwarlin appeared at Barber's meeting-house and launched a personal attack on the minister before his congregation.<br>
<br>Barber's credentials as a parliamentary reformer were established by his election as a delegate to the volunteer conventions held at Dungannon in 1782, 1783, and 1793. More unusually he was also an early advocate of Catholic relief. In October 1779 he preached a sermon to two volunteer companies, calling for protestant unity against the threat of invasion but praising the &#145;present generation&#146; of Roman Catholics for behaving &#145;peaceably and quietly, though as a religious society they have been subjected to penal laws too shocking to enumerate&#146;  (S. Barber, <span class="italic">A Sermon Delivered &hellip; to the Castlewellan Rangers, and Rathfriland Volunteers</span>, 1779, 9). During the tithe controversy of 1787, which had been sparked off by the publication of <span class="italic">The Present State of the Church of Ireland</span> by Richard Woodward, bishop of Cloyne, Barber wrote two pamphlets condemning the principle of church establishments, the tithe system, and the penal laws against Roman Catholics. In 1791 he preached a sermon as moderator to the General Synod of Ulster on <span class="roman">Revelation</span> 18: 20. He took this opportunity to reiterate his belief in religious equality, now reinforced by a strong tinge of millenarianism. The reign of Antichrist, which Barber associated with the alliance of church and state, was traced back to the Council of Nicaea, and the French Revolution taken as an omen of its demise.<br>
<br>The nature of Barber's connection with the United Irish movement is not clear, though he certainly sympathized with its aims. In July 1792 he accompanied Wolfe Tone and Samuel Neilson on a mission to suppress sectarian disturbances between the Peep o'Day Boys (protestants) and The Defenders (Catholics) in the Rathfriland area. Both the informer Nicholas Mageean and the United Irishman Charles Hamilton Teeling state that Barber was involved in the preparations for the rising of 1798. He was arrested and imprisoned for several months during the summer of 1797. Following the outbreak of the rising he was convicted by court martial, on a charge of having uttered seditious words, and imprisoned a second time, from July 1798 to January 1799, though he maintained his innocence.<br>
<br>Barber died in Rathfriland on 5 September 1811, in his seventy-fourth year. He was said to be well over 6 feet tall.<br>
