<span class="headword">Archer,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1639), <span class="occ">separatist minister and writer</span>, was the son of Francis Archer (1561&#150;1636), whose family had been settled for centuries at Epping, Essex, and of his wife (<i>d</i>. 1643), whose name is unknown. He is probably the John Archer who graduated MA from Magdalene College, Cambridge, in 1626. In September 1627 he was licensed to preach anywhere in London, and became a lecturer at St Antholin's and at All Hallows, Lombard Street. Samuel Hartlib, seeking relief in England for distressed protestants abroad, named him in 1630 as a leading well-wisher. Archer was soon in trouble over his puritan scruples. In December 1630 he was silenced by Bishop William Laud of London for not catechizing according to the form laid down in the prayer book, and for refusing to bow at the name of Jesus. The sentence was lifted after he submitted in January 1631, but by March Laud had found further evidence against him. The feoffees for impropriations came to his rescue by offering him the vicarage of All Saints', Hertford (where the millenarian Christopher Feake was later to serve). He was instituted there on 3 May 1631 and served for several years.<br>
<br>Archer suffered from very poor health in this period. According to his fellow minister Thomas Edwards, a friend despite their differences, he was consumptive and often close to death, and rarely able to preach. He was also deeply unhappy with the religious climate of Laudian England, and in 1637 decided to settle abroad. He moved to the Netherlands with his wife (whom he had married at an unknown date, and who survived him) and mother, landing on 27 July, and became pastor to a group of about a hundred mostly prosperous English religious refugees at &#145;Viana&#146; (probably Vianen, in Utrecht). In 1638 they moved to Arnhem, where the Archers' only child (a son) was born, and the magistrates allowed the group to hold regular services in the choir of the Broeren Kirk, sharing it with a congregation of French Huguenot refugees. Enjoying a comfortable life and better health than in England, Archer was able to preach regularly until his premature death at Arnhem in 1639. Thomas Goodwin and Philip Nye, who also served the congregation for a time, considered him and a fellow exile &#145;as precious men as this earth beares any&#146;  (Goodwin and others, 22).<br>
<br>Archer's treatise <span class="italic">The Personall Reigne of Christ upon Earth</span> was published in London late in 1641 or early in 1642, and predicted that the millennium was close at hand. It prophesied the calling of the Jews in 1650 or 1656, the fall of Rome in 1666, and the coming of Christ about 1700. Having set up his kingdom Christ would withdraw to heaven, returning at the end of the thousand years. The book appeared at a time of great political and religious excitement and caused a considerable stir. It went quickly through several impressions, and did much to foster the spread of millenarian ideas in England. Archer urged readers to leave matters in God's hands, but he also predicted the imminent overthrow of earthly kings; the revolutionary implications were obvious to many contemporaries, including a few years later the Fifth Monarchists. In 1645 the bookseller Benjamin Allen published some of Archer's other writings. <span class="italic">Comfort for Beleevers</span>, a pastoral treatise never intended for the press, provoked a storm by declaring that God was in part the author of the sins of the godly. Archer had intended this to reassure church members troubled by their human frailties, but the Westminster assembly was outraged by its antinomian implications and sent deputations to parliament in July 1645 to denounce it as heretical and blasphemous. The Lords and Commons both ordered the book to be burned by the public hangman and all remaining copies to be seized; Robert Baillie, one of the Scottish delegates in London, published a fierce condemnation of Archer's &#145;blasphemies&#146;. <span class="italic">Instructions about Right Beleeving</span>, a collection of sermons, was uncontroversial.<br>
