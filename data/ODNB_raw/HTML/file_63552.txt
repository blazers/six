<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bengal,  nawabs of</span>  (<em>act. </em>1756&#150;1793), <span class="occ">rulers in India</span>, were formally the <i>subahdars</i>, or governors, of a Mughal province. In reality they were rulers of what since the early eighteenth century had been an effectively autonomous Bengal. That autonomy was to be lost to the British during their lifetimes.<br>
<br>Estimates of the date of birth of <a name="cosubject_63553"></a><span class="headword">Siraj ud-Daula</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1757)<span class="occ"></span> vary from 1729 to 1738. He was the son of Zain al-Din Ahmad Khan (<i>d</i>. 1748) and of his wife, Amina Begam (<i>d</i>. 1760), daughter of Alivardi Khan, nawab of Bengal since 1740, who in 1752 or 1753 had declared Siraj ud-Daula to be his heir. On Alivardi's death on 10 April 1756 Siraj ud-Daula succeeded to a territory, including Bihar as well as the historic area of Bengal, which had been brought by his predecessors under a relatively centralized administration, owing only a nominal allegiance to the Mughal emperors, the formal source of the nawabs' authority. Bengal was a prosperous province, yielding a high return in taxation and with a vigorous commerce. By 1756 its external trade by sea was largely in the hands of European merchants operating out of privileged coastal enclaves. The East India Company and its servants were the dominant European merchants and the British town of Calcutta was the major foreign enclave.<br>
<br>Within a few months of his accession Siraj ud-Daula decided to bring pressure on the British at Calcutta. He evidently wished to curb the immunities which they enjoyed and to force them to make a fiscal contribution commensurate with their wealth. The British prevaricated, and the nawab forced the issue with an attack on the city, which he captured in June 1756. A number of British prisoners subsequently perished in the dungeon called the &#145;black hole&#146;, an episode for which the nawab seems to have been in no way responsible.<br>
<br>The victory at Calcutta was to be a short-lived one. British troops and warships were dispatched from Madras under the command of Robert Clive to recover the settlement, which they duly did in February 1757. This reverse left Siraj ud-Daula vulnerable to a coalition of enemies within Bengal, who began to intrigue against him. The opposition which nawabs of Bengal habitually faced at the beginning of their reigns seems to have been exacerbated by fear and dislike for a headstrong, violent young ruler, whose &#145;quarrel and enmity with all the people, whether high or low, nobles or lords, exceeded all limits&#146;  (<span class="italic">Tarikh-i-Bangala</span>, 131). The plotters were aided and abetted by the British army. Most of the nawab's commanders deserted him on the field of Plassey on 23 June 1757, leaving the victory to Clive. Siraj ud-Daula fled, but was killed by his enemies on 2 July. He left a widow, Lutfunessa, and a young daughter. He had a fine <i>imambara</i>, or hall, for celebrating Muharram built at his capital at Murshidabad.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_63554"></a><span class="headword">Mir Jafar Ali Khan</span>  (<em>c.</em>1691&#150;1765)<span class="occ"></span>, the leading conspirator against Siraj ud-Daula, succeeded him. Symbolically for the future, he was placed on his throne by Robert Clive. Son of an Arab, Sayid Ahmad Najafi, he was a recent immigrant into Bengal, of good birth but &#145;an almost uneducated soldier&#146;  (Khan, 8). He had married Shah Kanum (<i>d</i>. 1766), half-sister of the nawab Alivardi Khan, whom he served as military commander, and had two other wives, Babbu Begam (<i>d</i>. 1808) and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69060/', "Munni Begam (1723?&#150;1813)")</script>.<br>
<br>In return for British help in the plot that brought him the throne, Mir Jafar was obliged to cede some territory around Calcutta, to confirm and strengthen British commercial privileges, and to make huge public and private payments as rewards and indemnities to his British allies. In other respects, he evidently assumed that he would rule his dominions as his predecessors had done. This was not to be. Although Clive had a personal regard for him, his authority was quickly eroded. Parts of his revenues were claimed by the British to clear his debts to them, the British army took over the defence of Bengal against incursions from northern India, and a British resident posted to the nawab's capital at Murshidabad actively intervened in court politics.<br>
<br>Relations between the nawab and his British protectors broke down completely. He resented their interference and they regarded him as incompetent to govern, a view shared by Indian contemporaries, one of whom reported that he talked of matters of state &#145;with the incoherence and insensibility of a man loitering his time in a tippling shop&#146;  (<span class="italic">S&euml;ir mutaqherin</span>, 2.272). In October 1760 <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28103/', "Henry Vansittart")</script>, the British governor who had replaced Clive, insisted that Mir Jafar must cede territory to the East India Company and hand over his government to a minister of their choice. Mir Jafar preferred to give up his throne and went to live in Calcutta.<br>
<br>The man chosen by the British to be the effective minister became the new nawab. He was called <a name="cosubject_63555"></a><span class="headword">Mir Kasim Ali Khan</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1777)<span class="occ"></span>, probably the son of Mir Razi Khan and son-in-law of Mir Jafar through his marriage to his daughter Fatima Begam. Mir Kasim had already proved himself to be an effective administrator before his succession. His strategy as nawab seems to have been to accept the domination of the British in the coastal regions of lower Bengal, including the outright cession of territory to them, but to try to restrict their interference elsewhere and to be ruler in the fullest sense over the rest of Bengal and Bihar. To reduce British influence, he moved his capital to Monghyr in Bihar. There he enforced his own will on the administration, dismissing most of those who had held office under his predecessors, greatly enhancing the revenue that remained under his control, and reforming his army.<br>
<br>Mir Kasim's hopes of an effective independence from the British were to prove vain. Supporters of Clive who were still in India were never reconciled to his promotion and worked against him. Trade was, however, the issue on which relations with the British broke down. With the crippling of the nawabs' power after Plassey, private British merchants from Calcutta and their Indian partners and subordinates extended their trade throughout Bengal. This was a serious challenge to the nawabs' authority, since British merchants refused to pay their duties or to accept the jurisdiction of local officials and intruded into trades reserved for the government. Vansittart was willing to reach a settlement with the nawab, but his council overruled him. Local conflicts about trade and jurisdiction developed into a full-scale war in 1763. As British troops moved against him, Mir Kasim withdrew into northern India, killing numbers of British personnel and Indian notables who had fallen into his hands, acts of revenge which left him with a reputation for brutality. Mir Kasim was given support by the wazir of Oudh and by the Mughal emperor, but their combined army was defeated by the British at the battle of Buxar on 23 October 1764. The last challenge to British control of Bengal had been beaten off, and Mir Kasim was to spend the rest of his life in exile until his death from dropsy at Delhi on 7 June 1777.<br>
<br>When the British formally declared war on Mir Kasim on 7 July 1763, they proclaimed that Mir Jafar was again nawab of Bengal. The office had lost most of its credit and was to become of even less account on Mir Jafar's death from leprosy at Murshidabad on 5 February 1765, when he was succeeded by his eldest surviving son, Najm ud-Daula. The succession was formally confirmed by the East India Company, who took on themselves the appointment of the ministers to manage the government for the young nawab. On 12 August 1765, by a direct grant from the Mughal emperor, the company took over the major part of the nawabs' functions. The company became <i>diwans</i>, or administrators, of the finances of Bengal. The revenues of the province now belonged to them. The nawabs were to be guaranteed a fixed tribute and were to retain the remainder of their functions, the <i>nizamat</i>, or responsibility for defence and criminal justice.<br>
<br>Najm ud-Daula reigned for little more than a year. On his death on 8 May 1766 another young son of Mir Jafar, Saif ud-Daula, succeeded, again for a short period. He died on 10 March 1770, to be succeeded by the even younger <a name="cosubject_71219"></a><span class="headword">Mubarak ud-Daula</span>  (1757/8&#150;1793)<span class="occ"></span>, aged eleven or twelve, the son of Mir Jafar by Babbu Begam.<br>
<br>Mubarak ud-Daula's reign was to last for more than twenty years, during which the office of nawab lost all its significance. The nawabs had long since been deprived of their military functions with the disbanding of their army; when Warren Hastings became governor of Bengal in 1772, he began to regulate their judicial responsibilities and he greatly reduced the nawab's tribute. In 1791 the company's courts took over complete responsibility for the criminal law from the nawab. Mubarak ud-Daula lived out his life in his palace at Murshidabad, until 1787 under the close supervision of a British resident. In addition to his principal wife, Fais-un-Nisa, he had a number of other wives, with whom he had twelve sons and thirteen daughters. Like his predecessors, Mubarak ud-Daula was a generous patron of religious festivals, Hindu as well as Muslim. He died in Murshidabad on 6 September 1793, heavily in debt.<br>
