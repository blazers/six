<span class="headword">Thomas,  David</span>  (1794&#150;1882), <span class="occ">iron manufacturer</span>, was born at Tyllwyd farm, Cadoxton, Glamorgan, on 3 November 1794, the only son of David Thomas and his wife, Jane, farmers. His father, the son of a dissenter, held the office of churchwarden in the established church, and served as overseer of the poor for sixteen years. A precocious lad, David Thomas received the best education available in the district, attending schools at Allt-wen, near Pontardawe, and Neath. Farming held no interest for him and, aged seventeen, he entered employment at the Neath Abbey ironworks, one of the largest manufacturers of mining machinery and Cornish pumping engines. Here he acquired technical training in the machine shops and foundry. In 1817 Richard Parsons, owner of the Ynyscedwyn ironworks at Ystradgynlais, hired him as general superintendent of the company's furnaces and iron mines, a position he held for the next twenty-two years. George Crane acquired control of Ynyscedwyn in 1820 and supported Thomas's experiments with anthracite to smelt iron.<br>
<br>Crane's business acumen and Thomas's technical expertise created a dynamic combination. Ynyscedwyn sat on Wales's anthracite basin, and yet was hauling bituminous coal to the works from a distance of fourteen miles. If anthracite could be used successfully costs would be significantly reduced. Experiments in 1826 and 1832 failed, but Thomas finally succeeded in smelting iron after adopting the hot-blast method patented in 1828 by James Neilson of Glasgow. According to an account by Edward D. Roberts, who had a long association with Crane and Thomas, &#145;the origin of the successful application of the hot-blast in making iron with anthracite&#146; occurred in Crane's library. Using the bellows to heat coals in the fireplace, Thomas observed that &#145;if we only had Neilson's hot-blast here, the anthracite would burn like pine&#146;  (<span class="italic">Red Dragon</span>, 1883). Both immediately recognized that this was an idea worth exploring. Thomas returned from his visit to Neilson in Scotland with a licence to experiment with the technology and a skilled mechanic to construct the hot-blast ovens that would heat the air to be forced into the furnace. By spring 1837 the new hot-blast proved successful in increasing the temperature sufficiently to ignite anthracite coal. Thereafter that was the only fuel used at Ynyscedwyn until it ceased operation in 1877. This technical breakthrough required the ironmaster not only to adapt the hot-blast and blowing machine to anthracite, but also to experiment with the optimum size and shape of the furnace and mixture of the raw materials.<br>
<br>Experiments with anthracite iron also were under way in Pennsylvania, where the major deposits of anthracite coal in the United States were located. Entrepreneurs were busy trying to discover the secret of anthracite-smelted iron, none more so than managers of the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company (LCNC). One of company's agents, Solomon W. Roberts, was inspecting rails at the Dowlais ironworks in Merthyr Tudful when he learned of Thomas's successful experiment. Roberts visited Ynyscedwyn, and then sent an enthusiastic report to his uncle Josiah White, an official with the LCNC. Erskine Hazard, a member of the LCNC board of managers who was travelling to England on business, was assigned to visit Ynyscedwyn to discuss transferring the technology to Pennsylvania. Crane recommended that Hazard employ David Thomas as ironmaster, and in December 1838 Thomas signed a lucrative agreement with LCNC to supervise the company's construction of a new hot-blast anthracite furnace at a location on the Lehigh River that became Catasauqua. Although reluctant to leave his ageing mother, his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hopkins (1794&#150;1888), who spoke only Welsh, overcame his resistance by arguing that their three sons, Samuel, John, and David, would have a better future in America. George Crane stood to profit since the patent was in his name, and he actively encouraged Thomas to accept the offer.<br>
<br>The Thomas family boarded the clipper <i>Roscius</i> at Liverpool in May 1839 for the three-week voyage to New York. Thomas contracted a fever during the passage and was quarantined in a New York hospital for his first month in America. Once he recovered the family travelled on to Pennsylvania and on 9 July reached Allentown, where they resided for the next four months while their house was built near the new ironworks site. Thomas laid out the works and directed the construction of the furnace following the same plans used at Ynyscedwyn with hot-blast ovens separate from the furnace, and a waterwheel to drive the blast machinery. There were many obstacles to be overcome, but finally the anthracite furnace went into blast in July 1840. Four additional furnaces were built at Catasauqua by 1850 making the now renamed Lehigh Crane Iron Company the most impressive furnace group in America. The Catasauqua works is closely identified with the beginning of the industrial revolution in America, and was exceeded only by the complex that Thomas created in 1855 at Hokendauqua, about a mile from Catasauqua, for the Thomas Iron Company. The company was organized in 1854 by local capitalists and named in honour of David Thomas. Thomas was a major investor in the company, but his son Samuel Thomas (1828&#150;1906) served as its superintendent.<br>
<br>While he is best known as an iron-furnace innovator Thomas's talents were far-reaching. He developed the first anthracite furnace to use heat from the furnace to heat the steam boilers, worked out how to use steam engines to drive the blowing machinery instead of the waterwheel, found a way to use gases escaping the furnace stack to develop a new refining method similar to what became the puddling furnace, and also developed a mechanical system to replace animal power for handling raw materials. The practices and innovations developed by David Thomas spread throughout the nineteenth-century American iron industry, diffused by ironmasters who came to Catasauqua to learn from Thomas and use his famous technical library, and then moved on to manage new works opening elsewhere in industrializing America. William R. (Captain Bill) Jones, Andrew Carnegie's legendary superintendent of the Edgar Thomson works in Pittsburgh, is perhaps the most famous of many. Giles Edwards (1824&#150;1892), another influential ironmaster who was trained by David Thomas, also born in Glamorgan, played an instrumental role in establishing the iron industry first in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and then in Birmingham, Alabama, the &#145;Pittsburgh of the South&#146;.<br>
<br>David Thomas returned to Wales only once, in 1866. By then he had branched out into numerous other businesses, but his reputation as an ironmaster was pre-eminent throughout his lifetime. His national influence was recognized when, aged eighty, he was elected president of the Ironmasters' Convention meeting in Philadelphia. At Catasauqua he held civic office when the town was incorporated in 1853, and founded the Presbyterian church there. He died at his home in Catasauqua on 20 June 1882. At his funeral 900 furnace workers from the Thomas Iron Company led a procession of sixty-four carriages conveying the Lehigh Valley &eacute;lite. He was buried at the Fairview cemetery, West Catasauqua. David Thomas was not an inventor, but rather a great technological innovator who smelted the first commercially successful anthracite iron. Through him the British industrial knowledge and experience that would spark America's emergence as an industrial power was transferred to the United States.<br>
