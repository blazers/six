<span class="headword">Terriss,  Ellaline</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>(Mary) Ellaline Lewin; <em>married name </em>(Mary) Ellaline Hicks, Lady Hicks]</span>  (1871&#150;1971), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born (Mary) Ellaline Lewin on 13 April 1871 at the Ship Hotel, Stanley, Falkland Islands, the eldest of the three children of William Charles James Lewin [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27144/', "Terriss, William (1847&#150;1897)")</script>], actor, and his wife, Isabel Lewis 
    (Amy Fellowes; <i>d</i>. 1898)
  . She was among the most successful musical comedy actresses of the late Victorian and Edwardian periods. She was educated privately. As a girl she had no ambition to go on the stage although she made a single appearance in a pantomime at the Alexandra Theatre, Liverpool, on 1 January 1887 when she &#145;danced a hornpipe with much success&#146;  (Broadbent, 319&#150;20). Her career began in earnest when, having played Mary Herbert in Alfred Calmour's one-act play <span class="italic">Cupid's Messenger</span> at home as a treat for her father, she was summoned by telegram by Herbert Beerbohm Tree to take the part at the Haymarket Theatre, London, on 14 February 1888.<br>
<br>This led to a three-year engagement with Charles Wyndham at London's Criterion Theatre. Terriss then moved to the Princess's Theatre, London, appearing first as Arrah Meelish in Dion Boucicault's <span class="italic">Arrah-na-pogue</span> on 29 August 1891. She went on to play leading parts at the Court Theatre where, <i>inter alia</i>, she appeared in a one-act musical duologue, <span class="italic">His Last Chance</span>, with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33854/', "(Edward) Seymour Hicks (1871&#150;1949)")</script>. After a brief courtship they were married on 3 October 1893; their solitary wedding breakfast was Irish stew and burgundy. Their partnership&#151;described as &#145;one of the happiest, both private and professional, the theatre has known&#146;  (<span class="italic">Richmond Times</span>, 3) despite Hicks's perennial lack of thrift&#151;was commemorated by an exhibition at the British Theatre Museum in 1971.<br>
<br>Terriss was the heroine of Oscar Barrett's Christmas pantomime <span class="italic">Cinderella</span> at the Lyceum Theatre, London, in 1894, which transferred to Abbey's Theatre, New York. On her return she appeared as the original Thora in W. S. Gilbert's <span class="italic">His Excellency</span> at the Lyric Theatre in October 1894.<br>
<br>At the Gaiety Theatre, London, in 1895, Terriss played Bessie Brent in the trend-setting <span class="italic">Shop Girl</span>, by H. J. W. Dam and Ivan Caryll &#145;the very first musical comedy&#146;  (Macqueen-Pope, 318), followed in May by J. T. Tanner's <span class="italic">My Girl</span> and Dora Wemyss in the <span class="italic">Circus Girl</span> by J. T. Tanner and W. Paling. Terriss's greatest successes were here, until 1898, and at other London theatres, the Vaudeville (1900&#150;05) and the newly built Aldwych and Hicks (later Globe) theatres (1905&#150;10) in leading parts in musical plays. Many of these were scripted by Hicks, including the <span class="italic">Runaway Girl</span> (1898), the <span class="italic">Cherry Girl</span> (1903), the <span class="italic">Catch of the Season</span> (1904), the <span class="italic">Beauty of Bath</span> (1906), the <span class="italic">Gay Gordons</span> (1907), and the <span class="italic">Dashing Little Duke</span> (1909); the best loved among them, and one of her own favourites, was <span class="italic">Bluebell in Fairyland</span> (1901), in which she sang the &#145;Honeysuckle and the Bee&#146;. This was revived in 1905 for the opening of the Aldwych and was brought back to the Prince's Theatre in 1916. Among her other roles she was also acclaimed as Phoebe Throssell in J. M. Barrie's <span class="italic">Quality Street</span> at the Vaudeville (1902).<br>
<br>However, life was darkened for a time in 1897 when Terriss's first child died shortly after his birth, her father was stabbed to death by a deranged actor outside the Adelphi Theatre, London, and her mother died shortly afterwards. She and Hicks adopted an Irish girl, Mabel, at about this time. Their own daughter, Betty, was born in 1904.<br>
<br>The couple lost money in the building of three London theatres: the Aldwych, the Hicks, and the Queen's. From 1911 they toured theatres and music halls in Britain and abroad, although Ellaline returned to the London stage for some dozen productions, finally playing Mrs Thornton in Hicks's <span class="italic">Miracle Man</span> at the Victoria Palace in May 1935. She also made recordings of her most popular songs, and appeared in films including <span class="italic">Blighty</span> (1926), <span class="italic">Land of Hope and Glory</span> (1926), <span class="italic">Atlantic Glamour</span>, <span class="italic">A Man of Mayfair</span>, and <span class="italic">The Iron Duke</span> (1934). She and Hicks were among the first performers to go to France in 1914 to entertain the troops. In 1940 they went to the Middle East with the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA).<br>
<br>In later years Terriss took up painting and was tutored in South Africa, where she and Hicks spent much of the Second World War, by the marine artist George Pilkington, and an exhibition of her work was held at Foyle's Art Gallery, London, in February 1959. Her husband, who was knighted in 1935, died on 6 April 1949.<br>
<br>Terriss was &#145;an actress of great freshness and sweetness&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 17) and was regarded as a &#145;perfect type of English beauty&#146; with a &#145;Dresden shepherdess air of delicacy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>) but was known also for her warmth and kindness. She wrote two volumes of autobiography, <span class="italic">Ellaline Terriss by Herself and with Others</span> (1928) and <span class="italic">Just a Little Bit of String</span> (1955). Ellaline Terriss died at the Holy Family Nursing Home, Hampstead, London, on 16 June 1971 following a hip fracture.<br>
