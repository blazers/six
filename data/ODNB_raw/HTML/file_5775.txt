<span class="headword">Cockburn,  Patrick</span>  (1678&#150;1749), <span class="occ">Scottish Episcopal clergyman</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5774/', "John Cockburn (1652&#150;1729)")</script>, Church of Scotland minister, and his wife Anna (<i>d</i>. 1695), daughter of Alexander Garden, a leading cleric of the diocese of Aberdeen. Patrick was born at Udny, Aberdeenshire, during his father's incumbency of the parish. After the revolution in 1689 his father went abroad, though not apparently as a nonjuror as he prayed for King William and Queen Anne during his time as chaplain to the British congregations at Rotterdam and Amsterdam. It is not known whether Patrick accompanied his father, or where he was educated, but he was in Holland in 1705, for on 17 August of that year he received an MA from Edinburgh University and was described as being currently <i>in Batavia agens</i>. Early in 1708 he married the dramatist and philosopher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5768/', "Catharine Trotter (1674?&#150;1749)")</script>, daughter of David Trotter and Sarah Ballenden. He is said to have shortly afterwards obtained the perpetual curacy of Nayland, Suffolk, but he was probably only a temporary curate-in-charge from June 1708. The sole reference to him in the Nayland registers is the entry of the baptism on 13 April 1712 of &#145;Mary, daughter of Patrick Cockburn, curate, and Catharine his wife&#146;.<br>
<br>From Nayland Cockburn moved to London, where he was curate at St Dunstan-in-the-West, Fleet Street. Soon afterwards he had to give up his appointment owing to his refusal to take the oath of abjuration of the former Stuart royal line in 1714. For a time he made a scanty living by teaching Latin at a school in Chancery Lane, London. However, by 29 November 1726 he had reversed his former nonjuring position and, having taken the oath, was appointed at that date as the qualified, or Hanoverian, minister of St Paul's Episcopal Chapel, Aberdeen, which was built in 1722. Soon afterwards he was preferred to the parish of Long Horsley, Northumberland, but did not live there until 1737.<br>
<br>While in Aberdeen Cockburn published a number of apologetic works upholding the legitimacy of the Hanoverian regime, including a sermon, <span class="italic">On the Duty and Benefit of Praying for our Governors</span> (1728), and a pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Lawfulness and Duty of Praying for our Present King and Governor</span> (1735). These were probably engendered by a controversy with the predominantly nonjuring Scottish Episcopalians. Cockburn had a family connection to the eighteenth-century Scottish Episcopalian mystical tradition, which was influenced by French quietism through the works of Henry Scougall and George Garden. Garden was Cockburn's uncle, and Scougall his father's first cousin. Probably as a result of this connection he produced his edition of Scougall's <span class="italic">Life of God in the Soul of Man</span> (1726). The addition of Scougall's &#145;Nine Discourses&#146; and Garden's funeral sermon for Scougall made this work an important contribution to Scougall's biography. Compelled to move to Long Horsley in 1737, Cockburn resigned his Aberdeen incumbency on 1 June 1739. He died on 4 January 1749 and was buried three days later at Long Horsley parish church cemetery. He was survived by his wife who, shocked by his death, died on 11 May of the same year.<br>
