<div class="para">
<span class="headword">MacInnes,  Colin</span>  (1914&#150;1976), <span class="occ">novelist and essayist</span>, was the second child and younger son (a daughter died in infancy) of the novelist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36466/', "Angela Margaret Thirkell (1890&#150;1961)")</script> and her first husband, James Campbell McInnes (1874&#150;1945), the baritone lieder singer. He was born at 20 The Grove, The Boltons, London, on 20 August 1914, changing the spelling of his name to MacInnes when he became a professional writer. Through descent from a Wesleyan minister, the Revd George Browne Macdonald (1805&#150;1868), his maternal great-grandfather was the painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4051/', "Sir Edward Burne-Jones (1833&#150;1898)")</script>, and Rudyard Kipling and Stanley Baldwin were his grandmother's cousins. Often mistakenly thought to be Australian, for he was brought up in Melbourne, on his mother's side he was entirely British.<br>
<br>When MacInnes was only three his parents divorced, and in 1918 his mother married George Thirkell, an Australian engineer. In 1919 he and his elder brother, Graham, sailed with their mother and stepfather to Australia. The boys adopted the name Thirkell and were enrolled in the Scotch College at Melbourne. When MacInnes was fourteen his mother's second marriage collapsed, and she departed for England with Lance, her son with George Thirkell, leaving her two eldest boys to finish their schooling in Australia.<br>
<br>MacInnes freely admitted that he never loved his mother, nor she him, and that there was no human contact whatsoever with his stepfather. Yet despite these privations MacInnes always claimed to have enjoyed a happy childhood, relishing Australia, his school and schoolfriends, and the holidays spent on sheep stations and fruit farms in the Australian bush.<br>
<br>In 1931 MacInnes paid visits to France and Germany and, declining the opportunity to attend university in Australia, he remained on the continent, taking a job in Belgium with the Imperial Continental Gas Company, an incongruous choice of occupation which nevertheless he endured for five years. Having had no contact with his father since he was an infant, in 1934 he again met up with James McInnes, and both Colin and his elder brother reverted to their original surname, Colin later adapting the spelling to MacInnes.<br>
<br>Eventually determined on a career as an artist, in 1937 MacInnes became a student at the Chelsea Polytechnic, transferring the following year to the Euston Road School of Drawing and Painting. His studies were disrupted, however, by the outbreak of the Second World War. In 1940 he joined the Wiltshire regiment, being posted a year later to the intelligence corps, with whom he spent two years in Gibraltar before being employed in Germany with the rank of sergeant interrogating spies and Nazi sympathizers. By the end of the war he had decided his future lay as a writer rather than a painter; in an attempt to combine both interests, in 1947 he joined <span class="italic">The Observer</span> as art critic, employment that was abruptly terminated after only six months.<br>
<br>MacInnes had a mercurial temperament. He functioned best alone, and he wisely got down to work on his first novel, <span class="italic">To the Victors the Spoils</span>, a semi-autobiographical account of his work in the intelligence corps. Published in 1950, it was nominated Book of the Month by the <span class="italic">Daily Graphic</span>. His second novel, <span class="italic">June in her Spring</span>, published two years later, remained his own favourite among his novels but was largely ignored when it came out, for it dealt to some extent with homosexuality, in 1952 still a taboo subject.<br>
<br>In searching for his own authentic voice MacInnes was doubly handicapped: he strongly disliked his mother as a person and despised her as a novelist. The feeling was mutual, and although Angela Thirkell died a wealthy woman she cut MacInnes out of her will. He found her work &#145;able in execution&#146; but in content &#145;totally revolting&#146;, and was aghast whenever referred to as Angela Thirkell's son. He once admitted that he found her death a liberation, and that some of the themes he had chosen to write about recommended themselves precisely because they were ones that would disgust her.<br>
<br>Those themes were the very stuff of MacInnes's contemporary London: drugs, prostitution, race riots, and the teenage revolution, all of which feature in the trilogy of London novels for which he is best remembered, <span class="italic">City of Spades</span> (1957), <span class="italic">Absolute Beginners</span> (1959), and <span class="italic">Mr Love and Justice</span> (1960). In the events about which he wrote, MacInnes more or less took an active part. In 1955 he was arrested in an East End gambling club, and subsequently acquitted on a drugs charge; three years later, having failed to pay any income tax for several years, he was declared bankrupt; by 1961 he was a self-proclaimed &#145;anarchist sympathizer&#146;; and in 1966 he was recognized as propagandist for the British Black Power leader Michael X. On a British Council tour of Africa in 1971 his behaviour was so outrageous that the tour had to be abandoned.<br>
<br>MacInnes contributed to a wide variety of periodicals, including <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, <span class="italic">New Society</span>, <span class="italic">Encounter</span>, the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>, <span class="italic">Queen</span>, and <span class="italic">Gay News</span>, for whom he wrote perceptively and at length about Arthur Rimbaud. MacInnes was almost entirely self-educated, and in his essays he adopted a light and entertaining style that belied considerable erudition. Some of his aphorisms rivalled those of Oscar Wilde: &#145;If chastity were not considered a virtue it would be quite attractive&#146;; &#145;Only the rich can afford to be mean&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1969 MacInnes published the first of two historical novels, <span class="italic">Westward to Laughter</span>, a satire on R. L. Stevenson's <span class="italic">Treasure Island</span>. A second historical novel, <span class="italic">Three Years to Play</span>, appeared the following year, but although written with verve and authenticity neither of these books achieved the popular success of the three &#145;London novels&#146;. These remain important source material for MacInnes's own times, and were rediscovered by a young readership in the mid-1980s, resulting in the generally ill-received film adaptation of <span class="italic">Absolute Beginners</span> (1986). In 1973 he published an extended essay on bisexuality, <span class="italic">Loving them both</span>, and in 1974 his last novel, <span class="italic">Out of the Garden</span>, a questionable impression of England in decline. In 1976 cancer of the oesophagus was diagnosed, and very shortly before he died MacInnes wrote an unsentimental article for <span class="italic">New Society</span> about his decision to undergo surgery. Only sixty-one, he died on 22 April 1976 at his home, 74 Marine Parade, Hythe, Kent, of a massive haemorrhage, and was buried at sea off Folkestone a week later. He was predominantly homosexual and never married.<br>
