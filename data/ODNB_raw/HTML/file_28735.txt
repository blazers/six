<span class="headword">Warenne,  John  de</span>, seventh earl of Surrey <span class="st"> [earl of Surrey and Sussex, Earl Warenne]</span>  (1286&#150;1347), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the son of William (V) de Warenne (<i>d</i>. 1286) and his wife, Joan (<i>d</i>. 1293), daughter of Robert de Vere, earl of Oxford (<i>d</i>. 1296), and the grandson and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28734/', "John de Warenne, earl of Surrey and Sussex (1231&#150;1304)")</script>.<h2>
<a name="Inheritanceandmarriage"></a>Inheritance and marriage</h2>Born on 30 June 1286, John was less than a year old when his father died, and only seven when his mother, Joan, died in 1293. At the time of Joan's marriage to William de Warenne, it had been arranged that if William and Joan died leaving a minor, the custody of land and heir would fall to Joan's parents, Robert de Vere and his wife, Alice. Robert died in 1296, and it is not known where John de Warenne spent his childhood. He emerges from obscurity after his grandfather died in 1304. Through his grandfather Warenne inherited the earldom of Surrey and Sussex, as well as lands and manors in Sussex, Surrey, Lincolnshire, Yorkshire, Wiltshire, and Norfolk. Since Warenne was still a minor, his grandfather's lands were taken into royal custody and held on his behalf until he came of age, which would have been in 1307. In February 1305 Edward I sent Warenne to attend a tournament at Guildford, part of his family estate, and provided considerable funds for his upkeep. Though the Warenne property remained in the hands of royal custodians, John de Warenne lived on the estate, and for that summer Edward commanded him to provide him with forty salted and dried deer, packed in barrels.<br>
<br>The parliament that met at Westminster in May 1306 marked Warenne's coming of age. On 7 April, just before parliament opened, Edward granted him his grandfather's lands, even though Warenne was not yet twenty-one, and had not performed homage. It is also likely that Warenne obtained the custody of his first cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1206/', "Edward Balliol")</script>, son of John de Balliol, sometime king of Scots, and of Isabella, daughter of John's grandfather and so John's aunt. Edward had been entrusted to John de Warenne senior in November 1299, and remained with the younger John until King Edward ordered him to deliver the boy back into royal custody in 1310. On 15 May 1306, while parliament was in session, the king brought Warenne to the royal chamber at Westminster and offered him the marriage of his granddaughter, Joan, daughter of Henri, count of Bar, and his daughter Eleanor. Warenne readily accepted, though the girl was less than half his age. Joan had arrived in England on 13 April and was escorted to Westminster with great pomp. A week after their betrothal Edward conducted a magnificent ceremony for the knighting of his eldest son, at which nearly 300 men were also knighted, including John de Warenne. The celebrations also involved the marriages of a number of barons and nobles. Warenne and Joan were married on 25 May, and about the same time <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9529/', "Edmund Fitzalan")</script>, who had been a ward in the custody of the elder John de Warenne, was married to the younger John's sister, Alice. John and Edmund would be closely linked over the next few years.<h2>
<a name="EarlyrelationswithEdwardII"></a>Early relations with Edward II</h2>A new phase of Warenne's career began with the death of Edward I on 7 July 1307. He was among those earls who witnessed Edward II's charter granting the earldom of Cornwall to Piers Gaveston on 6 August. On 26 August Warenne was summoned to parliament for the first time and was summoned continually thereafter. Early in 1308 he travelled with the king to France for Edward's marriage and performance of homage to the king of France. He was also summoned to attend Edward's coronation on 25 February.<br>
<br>Despite appearances of unity among the king and barons, relations were deteriorating rapidly, ushering in a lengthy period of political turmoil. John de Warenne's loyalties changed several times during the course of this conflict. However close he may have been to Edward at the very beginning of his reign, he soon opposed Gaveston. He fought, along with the earls of Arundel and Hereford, against Gaveston and his followers in a tournament at Wallingford in December 1307. Though the earls bested the favourite's side, Gaveston was declared the winner. Warenne was so annoyed that he showed Gaveston no favour thereafter. In January 1308, while he was with the king in France, he was one of the four earls who were party to an agreement at Boulogne that sought to ensure the redress of wrongs against the crown and oppressions against the people. This agreement is regarded as the first formal step in opposition to Gaveston. This opposition coalesced at the parliament in April when the nobility, including Warenne and Arundel, demanded that the king's favourite be exiled. At some point in these years Warenne became a retainer of Thomas, earl of Lancaster, the most powerful nobleman in England, and the staunchest opponent of Gaveston and Edward II. Warenne agreed to serve Lancaster with eighty men-at-arms and another earl. Perhaps this relationship had been sealed by the time of the tournament at Dunstable in late March and early April 1309, which Warenne attended in Lancaster's company along with Arundel, who may have been the other earl specified in the agreement. In June Edward forbade Lancaster, Warenne, Arundel, and three other earls to participate in any tournaments or adventures.<br>
<br>Shortly afterwards, however, Gaveston returned from exile, and Warenne moved over to the king. The earl of Lincoln, Henry de Lacy, was instrumental in persuading Warenne to accept Gaveston's return, and according to one chronicler Warenne became the latter's friend and helper. Warenne was with Edward and Gaveston in October at York, when all the other earls refused to attend a secret parliament that Edward summoned. In February 1310 Edward appointed him to help keep the peace in London during a parliament that other nobles would only attend in arms because of their fears about Gaveston. So close was he to Edward that he was the only earl besides the earl of Oxford who was not an ordainer in the following year. In response to a summons in August 1310 to fight against the Scots, Warenne travelled north with Edward, but he and Gloucester were the only earls willing to serve with Edward in Gaveston's company. In February 1311 the two earls rode through the forest of Selkirk, and received the foresters and others there into the king's peace. Warenne remained in Scotland through the spring and summer with a force of knights and men-at-arms. Warenne thus maintained his ties to Edward and Gaveston throughout 1310 and 1311.<br>
<br>Edward generously repaid Warenne's steadfastness. He granted favours to individuals at Warenne's request and a number of gifts to Warenne himself, including life grants of two Northamptonshire manors. In June 1310, moreover, Warenne received a life grant of the castle, forest, and honour of High Peak for an annual rent of just over 437 marks. The rent was to be paid in two instalments, but in 1310 Edward remitted the bulk of the rent, and the following year remitted payment for life. Although the honour and lands were subsequently resumed on several occasions, Warenne always recovered them.<br>
<br>The murder of Gaveston in 1312 strained Warenne's relationship with the king. Archbishop Winchelsey persuaded Warenne to join in the pursuit of Gaveston, who had returned to England unauthorized after parliament banished him from the realm in 1311. With the earl of Pembroke, Warenne besieged Gaveston in Scarborough Castle, forcing him to surrender on 19 May. The earls of Warwick and Lancaster captured Gaveston as Pembroke was escorting him to London, and he was summarily executed on 19 June. Gaveston's slaying enraged Edward and divided the baronage. Pembroke and Warenne stayed loyal to Edward. In August the king appointed Warenne keeper of the peace in Sussex. The following year, in both January and September, Edward issued orders forbidding Warenne to participate in tournaments, the latter involving Lancaster, Arundel, and three other earls. Then in June 1314, along with Lancaster, Arundel, and others, Warenne declined to participate in the ill-fated campaign in Scotland that ended at Bannockburn.<h2>
<a name="Maritaldifficulties"></a>Marital difficulties</h2>Warenne may have wavered in support of Edward at this point because his domestic difficulties put an intense strain on all of his relationships. By 1313 it was clear that Warenne's marriage had proved unhappy and childless. The earliest official indication of problems came in 1309, when Edward gave the earl permission to make whomsoever he pleased his heir, as long as he did not disinherit any children he might have with Joan. Then, in the spring of 1313, Edward dispatched his yeoman William Aune to take Joan from Warenne's castle of Conisbrough and bring her to the king, and by June she was living in the Tower of London, supported by the king. Warenne was now living with his mistress, Maud Nereford, and as a result was threatened with excommunication in May. Though Edward initially stepped in to prevent it, the bishop of Chichester finally issued the sentence. There ensued a lengthy legal battle involving Warenne, the church, the king, and some of the nobility. Warenne wanted to dissolve his marriage to Joan so that he could marry Maud and make their two boys his legitimate heirs. He claimed that he had been pressured into marrying Joan against his will, and that they were within the prohibited degrees of kinship. Maud brought her own suit claiming that he had first contracted to marry her. Further disapproval of their relations was registered by a church council as well as by a council of nobles, who included Thomas of Lancaster. The case dragged on for another two years, as Warenne sought to find a friendly ecclesiastical forum, but he could not get satisfaction. In 1316 he promised to pay Joan &pound;200 a year while the suit was in progress. In addition, he bound himself to provide Joan with lands worth 740 marks once their marriage was dissolved.<br>
<br>As the likelihood that Warenne would obtain an annulment faded, he set out on a different course. In a series of transactions in the summer of 1316, he surrendered the bulk of his family lands to the king, who then regranted them to Warenne for life. The regrants also specified that some of his lands would descend after his death first to John, son of Maud Nereford, then to his brother Thomas if this John died without heirs, and finally to the heirs general of Warenne if both sons died without heirs. Warenne stipulated that after his death, two of his more valuable properties, Stanford and Grantham, were to revert to the king, a clear benefit to the crown for engineering Warenne's settlement. In this manner, Warenne provided a legacy for his children but at great cost to the family patrimony. He did not give up hope for a dissolution of his marriage, and seems to have enlisted the assistance of the earl of Pembroke in presenting a petition to the pope seeking an annulment. In the meantime, in August 1316, Joan had departed England for France.<h2>
<a name="SupporterofEdwardII"></a>Supporter of Edward II</h2>Warenne soon incurred even greater costs. He steadfastly stuck to his support for Edward throughout the political crises of the middle years of Edward's reign. In February 1317 Edward summoned a small group of noblemen, including Warenne, to a colloquium at Clarendon. The topic was not specified, but they may have discussed the problems in Scotland as well as an attack on Lancaster. Warenne hesitated to carry out a direct assault, but on 9 May abducted Alice de Lacy, Lancaster's wife, from Canford Castle and took her to his own castle of Reigate. He did so, it was claimed, not for purposes of adultery but in order to humiliate Lancaster. Warenne may have acted in retaliation for Lancaster's opposition to his plan to dissolve his marriage, or for their long-standing political rivalry, or at the behest of Edward and the courtiers. Whatever the reason, Warenne soon discovered that he had bitten off more than he could chew. Lancaster was enraged, and in October and November launched a series of raids on those of Warenne's lands in Yorkshire that bordered his own estates. Edward tried to halt the fighting, but Lancaster persisted. He even ejected Maud Nereford from her property. In 1318 Edward, Lancaster, and other nobles tried to patch up their quarrels through a series of negotiations that culminated in the treaty of Leake on 9 August. Lancaster's war with Warenne, however, was regarded as a private matter and was specifically excluded from the negotiations, and in June 1318 Lancaster attacked Warenne's lordship of Bromfield and Yale in north Wales. Warenne was forced to come to terms with Lancaster on his own, and appears to have been coerced into a punishing settlement. He agreed to a disadvantageous exchange of lands, in which he gave up the Yorkshire and Welsh portions of his estate as well as lands in Norfolk for his life, in return for lands in Somerset, Dorset, and Wiltshire. In addition, he acknowledged that he owed Lancaster &pound;50,000, though none of it was ever collected.<br>
<br>Not surprisingly, Warenne adhered to the king through most of the troubles that ensued over the next few years, though his loyalty sometimes wavered. He was ordered to attend a muster in 1319 at Newcastle and went to Scotland, but the campaign achieved little. In 1321 the barons, led by the lords of the Welsh marches, once again united in opposition to royal favourites, this time the Despensers, father and son. The baronial coalition pressured Warenne, Arundel, and Pembroke into joining them to banish the Despensers at a parliament in August. Edward later pardoned Warenne for his actions against the Despensers between March and August. In October, however, Edward took the offensive, beginning with the siege of Leeds Castle in Kent, at which Warenne was present. He also marched west with Edward's army pursuing the marchers early in 1322. Warenne, Arundel, Pembroke, and Richmond were appointed to negotiate with Roger Mortimer of Wigmore on 17 January, an action that resulted in Mortimer's capture. Edward then turned northward to attack Lancaster. In March a council of magnates, including Warenne and Arundel, declared the rebels to be traitors and commissioned Warenne and Edmund, earl of Kent, to arrest Lancaster. Once Lancaster had been captured, Edward named Warenne as one of the judges at the trial that condemned him to death. Afterwards Warenne sat in the parliament at York that revoked the ordinances of 1311, participated in the campaign in Scotland that summer, and was in Scotland again in February 1323.<br>
<br>In 1325 Warenne was named captain of the expedition to Aquitaine. Abroad for a year, he returned in 1326 and was appointed as a captain of the array in the north in May and again in July. That May, Edward restored some of the lands that Lancaster had coerced from him. Yet, despite his support of Edward II, Warenne surrendered one of his manors to the elder Despenser to save himself from destruction. Time was now running out for the Despensers and Edward. Warenne adroitly shifted his allegiance to Queen Isabella after she landed in England in September 1326, and thereby avoided the fate of his brother-in-law, Edmund Fitzalan, who was executed in the fury that accompanied the downfall of Edward II. Warenne, in fact, was a member of the delegation that approached Edward in captivity in January 1327 and implored him to abdicate. He attended Edward III's coronation, and was a member of the regency council named to counsel and oversee the young king.<br>
<br>Warenne's domestic troubles seem to have subsided temporarily in these years. It was said that when he returned from Aquitaine in 1326, his wife, Joan, accompanied him, and in February 1327 he received protection to travel abroad with her. She had spent much of her time with Queen Isabella, and was in France with her and the young Prince Edward before their invasion. Furthermore, the upheaval in landholding that attended the rebellions in 1322 and 1326 led to the revision of the terms of Warenne's property settlement, in which he abandoned his effort to make his sons with Maud Nereford his heirs. Instead they entered the order of the hospital of St John of Jerusalem. Warenne's brother-in-law, Edmund Fitzalan, supported this change in his plans. Edward III settled some lands on Joan for her life in recognition of her service to his mother, Isabella, and granted her some of the goods forfeited by Fitzalan. Warenne finally recovered possession of his Yorkshire castles and lands from Henry of Lancaster in 1328, in return for a payment of 2000 marks.<h2>
<a name="Elderstatesman"></a>Elder statesman</h2>Warenne had survived personal and political turmoil and remained an important figure at the royal court. Although chroniclers condemned the fickleness of the barons throughout Edward II's reign, Warenne's career shows why most nobles were uncertain in their loyalties and unwilling to cling unwaveringly to a particular position. The rampant factionalism that beset the court and country made steadfastness dangerous and trimming a rational act. Warenne never became a political figure as imposing as Lancaster, but he was consistently at the centre of political action.<br>
<br>For Edward III, Warenne proved to be a faithful servant in a variety of capacities. Edward named him an overseer of the keepers of the peace in Oxfordshire in 1327, and between 1327 and 1332 appointed him to several judicial commissions. In the spring of 1327 Edward summoned him to perform military service in Scotland, and appointed him to negotiate with the Scots in November. Like most of the baronage Warenne was actively engaged in the Scottish wars for the next few years. He thus served in Scotland in 1330, and in 1333 was present at the siege of Berwick and battle of Halidon Hill. When rumours of unrest in the Welsh marches reached the king that year, he ordered Warenne and others to take steps to keep order. For the campaign of 1334&#150;5 in Scotland, Warenne sent a sizeable contingent but did not personally attend, though he was present at Newcastle on 12 June 1334 when his cousin Edward Balliol granted much of Scotland south of Forth to Edward III. He was with Balliol in the campaign of 1335. In 1336 he was named one of the defenders of the realm while the king was in Scotland. Warenne served Edward in the next few years by sitting on commissions, laying before the people of Surrey the decisions of the council (1337), and overseeing the array in some southern counties (1338). In 1339 he was acting sheriff of Surrey and Sussex. When Edward went overseas in 1338, and again in 1340, he named his eldest son, Edward, and Warenne as keepers of the realm in his absence. In 1345 Warenne was one of the councillors appointed to advise the regent, Edward's second son, Lionel.<br>
<br>Edward III rewarded Warenne amply for his service, especially at Halidon Hill. In 1333 he pardoned all debts owed by Warenne or his ancestors, and granted that his executors would have free administration of his goods after he died. In addition, Warenne's cousin and former ward, Edward Balliol, granted Warenne the earldom of Strathearn after Earl Malise had forfeited it. Thereafter, Warenne styled himself earl of Surrey and Sussex and earl of Strathearn. Edward III also promised to provide Warenne with 2000 marks out of the proceeds of wardships and escheats.<br>
<br>Perhaps as a result of his experiences under Edward II, Warenne managed to steer his way through the political undercurrents of the early years of Edward III's reign without getting deeply involved in the intrigue. He witnessed royal charters fairly consistently until his death, and played a role in government as a royal councillor. In 1330 the king granted him a manor and more than &pound;230 in rents out of the properties forfeited by the earl of Kent, in return for his agreement to remain with the king. This agreement might indicate that he had the blessing of Roger Mortimer, who then controlled the government, but he was unscathed by Mortimer's fall later in the year. In the financial and political crisis of 1340 he stood up in parliament to challenge the presence of royal officials, on the grounds that it was the peers of the realm who should give him aid and counsel. The only other possible indication of political resistance came in 1342, when Edward summoned Warenne to his campaign in Brittany. Warenne did not participate. Whether this was out of rebelliousness, or age&#151;Warenne was now fifty-six&#151;cannot be determined, but there were no repercussions. The same year he was excused from attending a tournament at Dunstable because of age and infirmity.<h2>
<a name="Lastyearsanddeath"></a>Last years and death</h2>Warenne's political steadfastness did not spill over into his private life, and domestic problems again haunted the last years of his life. Joan was in his company and regarded as his wife in 1331 and 1337, but went overseas in 1337 with her entire household. By this time Warenne may have been thinking once again of having his marriage dissolved. The bishop of Winchester wrote to him in 1344 charging him to hold Joan in marital affection, and to honour the dispensation that had been granted for his marriage. Joan went abroad yet again the following year, and the king acted at that time to guarantee her right to her lands in the face of any attempt by Warenne to regain them for himself. By 1345 Warenne was confessing that he had had an affair with Joan's aunt <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/60121/', "Mary of Woodstock (1278&#150;c.1332)")</script>, daughter of Edward I, before he married Joan. Whatever the truth of the claim, it did not result in a dissolution of his marriage to Joan. What probably drove him to these lengths was the prospect of another marriage. Despite his age, he was living with another mistress, Isabella Holland, the daughter of Sir Robert Holland, long Thomas of Lancaster's leading retainer, and subsequently notorious for betraying his lord in 1322; in his will Warenne refers to Isabel as &#145;my companion&#146;. He undertook a series of land transactions designed to undo his previous settlements and to make provision for Isabella and any potential heirs he might have with her. Initially the king acquiesced, until <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9534/', "Richard (II) Fitzalan, earl of Arundel")</script>, son of Warenne's brother-in-law Edmund Fitzalan, and thus Warenne's nephew, pointed out that the settlement would disinherit him since he was the heir general to Warenne's lands. The king agreed and nullified the new settlements. How disappointed Warenne might have been cannot be gauged, but in his will, dated 24 June 1347, just before his death, he left various gifts to Isabella and to various of his bastard children, and nothing to Joan. Despite his personal behaviour, Warenne demonstrated a reasonable degree of piety. He endowed a chantry, gave lands to monastic houses, entered the confraternity of Durham Priory, and possessed a <span class="roman">Bible</span> in French.<br>
<br>Warenne was becoming quite feeble, and in July 1346 Edward excused him from attending parliament or performing other services because of his frailty. He died without a legitimate heir between 28 and 30 June 1347 at his castle of Conisbrough, and was subsequently buried in Lewes Priory church. He was sixty-one. Joan was abroad when he died and lived for another fourteen years. Warenne left behind several illegitimate children, including at least three boys and three girls. His heir was Richard (II) Fitzalan, who obtained Warenne's estate but did not adopt the title of earl of Surrey until Joan died in 1361.<br>
<br>John de Warenne did not leave behind an impressive political or personal legacy. He was directly involved in most of the important political activity that occurred in England during his lifetime, but he was never a leader. Though he did not seem to act on high moral or political principles, he did display important chivalric qualities such as steadfastness, loyalty, and prowess. Yet his desire to provide for the descent of his lands, and his failure to sustain his marriage, undermined his actions and cost him dearly.<br>
