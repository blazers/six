<span class="headword">Burkitt,  Francis Crawford</span>  (1864&#150;1935), <span class="occ">biblical scholar</span>, was born in London on 3 September 1864, the only child of Crawford Burkitt and his wife, Fanny Elizabeth Coward. Burkitt's grandfather had migrated to London from Sudbury in Suffolk, and founded the business which his father carried on so successfully that the son had no need to make a living for himself. This grandfather married a sister of the philanthropist William Crawford, whose unworldliness and reforming spirit were seen again in some measure in his great-nephew.<br>
<br>Burkitt was sent to a day school near his home. In 1878 he went to Harrow School, on the modern side, and in 1883 entered Trinity College, Cambridge, of which he was elected a scholar in 1885. He graduated as a wrangler in part one of the mathematical tripos of 1886, but he turned at once from mathematics to the theological tripos. This involved a course of scientific study of the <span class="roman">Old</span> and the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> and the early history of Christian thought and institutions, which gave him a good foundation for his later work in the domain of the beginnings of Christianity. He won several university prizes, the second Tyrwhitt scholarship (1889), and in 1888 was placed in the first class in part two of the tripos.<br>
<br>Burkitt married Amy Persis, daughter of William Parry, rector of Fitz, Shropshire, and granddaughter of Sir Edward Barnes, also in 1888. They settled down in Cambridge and had one son, the archaeologist Miles Burkitt. It was not until 1903 that he held any academic office&#151;a university lecturership in palaeography previously held by James Rendel Harris&#151;and it was not until after the promulgation of the university statutes of 1926 that he was elected a fellow of Trinity, although he had been Norrisian professor of divinity (combined with the Hulsean professorship in 1934) since 1905. So he had his whole time at his own disposal and he set to work to study other oriental languages, Syriac in particular. It was as a Syriac scholar that he first became widely known, especially in connection with the textual criticism of the gospels. He was the first to recognize the importance of the Syriac palimpsest of the four gospels in the convent of St Catherine on Mount Sinai and was one of the party that transcribed it in 1893. The two-volume edition of the old Syriac gospels which he published in 1904 with the title <span class="italic">Evangelion da-Mepharreshe: the Curetonian version of the four gospels, with the readings of the Sinai palimpsest and the early Syriac patristic evidence edited, collected and arranged</span> has proved indispensable to students of the Syriac versions of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>.<br>
<br>Burkitt also contributed to <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> scholarship. His article &#145;Text and versions&#146; in the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Biblica</span> (1903) was a masterly survey. He lived through the years when the new literary and historical criticism of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> was fighting its way, and was active in expounding its main results. But it was in the critical study of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> that his own chief contributions were made. In this sphere Burkitt was, for English students at least, one of the pioneers, especially by his book <span class="italic">The Gospel History and its Transmission</span> (1906), but scarcely less so by his acceptance of the teaching of Johannes Weiss as to the meaning of &#145;the kingdom of God&#146; in the message of Jesus. Burkitt made himself at once the champion in England of the &#145;eschatological&#146;, &#145;apocalyptic&#146;, interpretation of the aims and teaching of Jesus. It was mainly at his instigation also that Albert Schweitzer's great book <span class="italic">Von Reimarus zu Wrede</span> (1906) was translated by William Montgomery and was made known to English readers under the title <span class="italic">The Quest of the Historical Jesus</span> (1910).<br>
<br>In addition Burkitt took a lead in showing the inadequacy of the liberal protestant ideas of the nineteenth century as regards Jesus and his gospel, and recalled students to the fact that Jesus shared the apocalyptic conceptions current among some religious Jews in his time and to acknowledging that his teaching never envisaged a future for human society such as was later realized. Burkitt's mastery of the conditions of the transition from the reformed religion of Israel to the Jewish-Christian conditions of the first century <span class="smallcap">AD</span> was shown in his Schweich lectures for 1913, <span class="italic">Jewish and Christian Apocalypses</span> (1914).<br>
<br>In common with other students Burkitt held that the Christ of the Catholic creeds and institutions was the product of epigenesis, in the course of which the historical figure had been transformed. But he was convinced that really scientific criticism applied to the gospels revealed a historical person with a <i>substratum</i> of his actual doings and sayings adequate to account for the origin and the later developments of the Christian church. So he found the new school of &#145;form criticism&#146; unacceptable as leaving one of the greatest of historical phenomena&#151;the rise of Christianity&#151;in the air, without foundation in events and happenings in actual human experience (<span class="italic">Jesus Christ: an Historical Outline</span>, 1932).<br>
<br>Burkitt made valuable contributions also to Franciscan studies (notably in his essay, &#145;The study of the sources of the life of St Francis&#146;, in the volume <span class="italic">St Francis of Assisi</span> edited by Walter Seton in 1926), and to the history and significance of Christian worship in <span class="italic">Eucharist and Sacrifice</span> (1921) and in volume 3 (1930) of <span class="italic">The Christian Religion: its Origin and Progress</span>, edited by J. F. Bethune-Baker, as well as in numerous articles on special points. His books on Manicheism and gnosticism, <span class="italic">The Religion of the Manichees</span> (1925) and <span class="italic">Church and Gnosis</span> (1932), were fresh and original surveys of well-worn themes.<br>
<br>A list of Burkitt's published writings (books, pamphlets, and articles in various magazines) occupies ten pages of small print in the <span class="italic">Journal of Theological Studies</span> for October 1935. Such a list shows the wide range of Burkitt's learning. All his writings bore the mark of a mind of unusual acumen as well as equipment. Burkitt received honorary degrees from the universities of Edinburgh and Dublin (1907), St Andrews and Breslau (1911), Oxford (1927), and Durham (1934). He was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1905.<br>
<br>Burkitt's was a vivid and attractive personality, full of interests other than those of the mere scholar&#151;an eager fisherman and occasional gardener, a skilled pianist and musician (with Bach as his standard of perfection), a player of patience and other such games, and a rapid solver of the crossword puzzles in <span class="italic">The Times</span>. In addition, he was a practising member of the Church of England of the modernist school, and regularly read the lessons at a liberal evangelical church near his home.<br>
<br>Burkitt remained alert and active in retirement, but died suddenly at his home in Cambridge, 1 West Road, on 11 May 1935.<br>
