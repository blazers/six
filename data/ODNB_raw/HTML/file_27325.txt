<span class="headword">Thomson,  Thomas</span>  (1773&#150;1852), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born on 12 April 1773 at Crieff, Perthshire, the seventh child and youngest son of John Thomson, a retired woolman, and his wife, Elizabeth Ewan. He was educated at home by his mother and his brother James, at Crieff parish school, and from 1786 to 1788 at the borough school of Stirling. In 1788 he won a bursary to the University of St Andrews where he studied classics, mathematics, and natural philosophy. From 1791 to 1795 he was a private tutor at Blackshields, near Edinburgh, which enabled him to attend a variety of classes at the university there from 1791. In 1794 he began to study medicine, graduating MD in 1799, but he was inspired by Joseph Black's lectures of 1795&#150;6 to devote his life principally to chemistry. From 1796 to 1800 he replaced his brother James as assistant editor of the <span class="italic">Supplement to the Third Edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>, to which he contributed the articles &#145;Chemistry&#146;, &#145;Mineralogy&#146;, and &#145;Vegetable, animal and dyeing substances&#146;; these formed the basis of his <span class="italic">System of Chemistry</span> (1802; 6th edn, 1820).<br>
<br>From 1800 to 1811 Thomson was a private teacher of chemistry in Edinburgh where by 1807 he had instituted a pioneering practical laboratory class. In 1802 and 1803 he collaborated with his brother James and his friend James Mill, the editor, in planning, and for a short time in contributing to, a postal periodical, the <span class="italic">Literary Journal</span>. In 1805 he acted as a well paid consultant to the Scottish Excise Board, invented the instrument known as Allan's &#145;saccharometer&#146;, and was elected fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He was a pugnacious opponent of Hutton's geology and helped to found the Wernerian Natural History Society of Edinburgh in 1808. He became FRS in 1811 and launched himself as a historian with his unofficial <span class="italic">History of the Royal Society</span> (1812). That year he visited Sweden, and in the next published an account of his travels, paying special attention to mineralogy and geology. From 1811 he resided in London, where he and James Mill lived rent-free in Jeremy Bentham's town house. In 1813 Thomson founded his own scientific journal, <span class="italic">Annals of Philosophy</span>, which he edited until 1821. With attractive features such as annual reports on the progress of science, it rapidly overtook its proprietary competitors. In 1816 Thomson married Agnes (<i>d</i>. 1834), daughter of R. Colquhoun, a distiller near Stirling. They had three children, the elder son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27326/', "Thomas Thomson (1817&#150;1878)")</script>, becoming well known as an Indian botanist and explorer and the daughter, Margaret Agnes, marrying Thomson's nephew, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27322/', "Robert Dundas Thomson")</script>.<br>
<br>The last phase of the entrepreneurial career of this Scottish man of parts began in 1817 when Thomson was unanimously appointed lecturer in chemistry at the University of Glasgow. Within seven months he was made regius professor through the influence of James Graham, third duke of Montrose and chancellor of the university. As professor, Thomson worked hard to re-establish Glasgow's distinguished chemical tradition and to improve its growing medical school. Particularly during the 1830s he led the unsuccessful political attempts made by the regius professors to elevate their status and increase their rights in the university. Tired by unremitting effort, in 1841 he relinquished the supervision of his laboratory and part of his teaching to his nephew, R. D. Thomson, whom he had groomed as his successor and assisted as editor of <span class="italic">Records of General Science</span>, 1835&#150;6. From 1846 to 1852 all Thomson's duties were discharged by his nephew who, however, failed to succeed his uncle.<br>
<br>A self-taught practical chemist, Thomson secured his reputation through his <span class="italic">System</span>, which went through six editions in eighteen years and appeared in French, German, and American versions. As the first systematic textbook of a non-elementary kind to break the French monopoly of such works, it stressed the contributions made by British chemists to the so-called new chemistry created in the late eighteenth century. Unusually for British treatises of the time, Thomson's digest was based on a wide range of original and recent papers as well as on standard compilations. Thomson's style was usually clear, often succinct, and occasionally trenchant. He was well known for the warm and effective support which he accorded to the chemical atomic theory of John Dalton, whom he first met in Manchester in 1804. In the third edition of his <span class="italic">System</span> (1807) he began a thirty-year stint as Dalton's bulldog when he made the first detailed public announcement of the theory and extended it from gases to include acids, bases, and salts. Early in 1808 Thomson was the first to publish an experimental illustration of Dalton's law of multiple proportions some months before the appearance of the latter's <span class="italic">New System of Chemical Philosophy</span> (1808). After 1808 Thomson used the successive editions of his <span class="italic">System</span> and his own <span class="italic">Annals</span> to promote chemical atomism and to countervail the scepticism with which Wollaston and Humphry Davy received it. In 1815 he espoused a second and related chemical cause when he published in his journal William Prout's anonymous paper on the specific gravities of gases. From this time Thomson's research had three connected aims: to put Dalton's atomic theory on a wider and firmer experimental basis; to provide incontestable experimental evidence for Prout's hypothesis that the atomic weights of all elements were multiples of that of hydrogen; and to extend his own work on the composition and formulae of salts to include those of all known minerals.<br>
<br>During his early years at Glasgow, Thomson and his laboratory students devoted themselves to the first two projects. Their results were eventually revealed in 1825 in his <span class="italic">An Attempt to Establish the First Principles of Chemistry by Experiment</span>. The analyses recorded had not been carried out with sufficient care to justify the claim of high accuracy made for them by Thomson, and the work was very severely criticized, especially by the Swedish chemist Berzelius, himself an analyst of extraordinary skill, who went so far as to accuse the author of having done &#145;much of the experimental part at the writing table&#146;  (J. Berzelius, <span class="italic">Jahresbericht</span>, 6, 1827, 77). Even so, Thomson's atomic weights were widely accepted in Britain and the USA for ten years from 1825. In 1836 he completed his research programme with his uncontroversial <span class="italic">Outlines of Mineralogy, Geology, and Mineral Analysis</span>, in which minerals were arranged on the basis of experimentally determined chemical composition and not of physical properties.<br>
<br>The outstanding pedagogic feature of Thomson's professorship was his emphasis on the laboratory teaching of practical chemistry. In autumn 1818 he extracted from the university a laboratory, and thus became the first teacher of practical chemistry in a British university. Some of his pupils subsequently worked in the Glasgow chemical industry, others formed a small research school. His pupils were prominent in the chemistry section of the British Association in the 1830s and in the founding of the Chemical Society of London in 1841. By the mid-1830s his new laboratory, opened in 1831 at a cost of about &pound;5000, had become a nursery from which ambitious chemists migrated to complete their training elsewhere.<br>
<br>Thomson became the patriarch of Glasgow science. His <span class="italic">History of Chemistry</span> (2 vols., 1830, 1831), unique and authoritative for the period after 1760, presented chemistry as a noble, rational, autonomous, and useful science. From 1834 until his death he was the president and chief ornament of the Philosophical Society of Glasgow, which he changed from a moribund affair dominated by artisans into a nationally important society led by Glasgow's learned professionals. Though he was sometimes arrogant and perpetually sardonic, the short and muscular Thomson, well known though not unassailed as teacher, researcher, writer, editor, and historian, was happy to end his career as Glasgow's senior scientific host and figure. A widower since 1834, he died on 2 July 1852 at Kilmun, near Dunoon, and was buried in Glasgow later that month.<br>
