<span class="headword">Bowes,  Marmaduke</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1585), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic martyr</span>, is of unknown parentage. He was a substantial Yorkshire yeoman of Angram Grange, near Appleton, in Cleveland. He experienced great personal conflict on religious issues, but refused to declare himself a Catholic, although he sympathized strongly with the Catholic cause. According to the recollections of Grace, wife of Sir Ralph Babthorpe of Babthorpe, Yorkshire, Bowes was married, and &#145;kept a schoolmaster to teach his children&#146;  (Morris, 244). There are several accounts of how Bowes came to be arrested. In one, this tutor, himself a Catholic, was arrested, and subsequently apostatized. The tutor then reported to the queen's council of the north at York that Bowes was known to entertain Catholic priests. Bowes was summoned to answer this complaint, and was ordered to appear at the August assizes of 1585, where he was indicted, condemned, and hanged. In another version, Bowes heard that his friend Hugh Taylor, a Catholic priest who had stayed with him in the past, had been arrested; when Bowes appeared at the York assizes to try to free Taylor, the layman was immediately apprehended, tried, and condemned. His execution took place so quickly that when he was hanged he was still wearing the boots and spurs in which he had ridden to York. What is certain is that Bowes was executed at the same time as Taylor, on 26 November 1585, the first person to be punished under the 1585 statute against harbouring priests. A contemporary report says &#145;he died very willingly and professed his faith [was openly converted to Catholicism], with great repentance that he had lived in schism&#146;  (Morris, 244). He was beatified on 22 November 1987.<br>
