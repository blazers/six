<span class="headword">Waldhere <span class="st"> [Wealdhere]</span></span>  (<em>fl. </em>694&#150;704/5), <span class="occ">bishop of the East Saxons</span>, often (later) called bishop of London, must have been appointed between 688, when Bishop Earconwald, named as an adviser in the law code of Ine (688&#150;726), was still in office, and 694. In that year, Bede relates, Waldhere gave the religious habit to Sebbi, king of the East Saxons, who brought to him a large sum of money for the poor and, later in the same year, asked that Waldhere be one of only three people present at his deathbed.<br>
<br>Surviving extracts from later copies of apparently genuine charters show that grantors to Waldhere included &AElig;thelred, king of the Mercians (675&#150;704) and Offa, who was among the kings of the East Saxons at some time after Sebbi. Some doubt hangs over another of these grants, authorized by Cenred, king of the Mercians, and dated 701&#151;Cenred did not succeed until 704. The only grant to Waldhere for which there is a full text, made in 704 by Sw&aelig;fred, king of the East Saxons, and one P&aelig;ogthath, is known only from a document whose artificial hand, of uncertain date, raises doubts about its authenticity.<br>
<br>In 704 or 705 Waldhere wrote a letter to Berhtwald, archbishop of Canterbury, which is both the earliest letter on parchment to survive in the original anywhere in Europe and the earliest closely datable example of the script known as insular minuscule. The tie which originally closed it, indicated by a gap between two words in the address on the dorse, was no guarantee that no one would open it. When Waldhere explained to Berhtwald that he was communicating in writing to preserve confidentiality, he must have expected that his messenger would be unable to read the letter&#151;an indication, perhaps, of the exclusivity of Latin at the time. The same desire for secrecy meant that he could not have employed a scribe: the letter is therefore in Waldhere's own hand. The bishop could write well, the high standard of his Latin probably owing much to the influence of continental figures like Berhtwald's predecessor, Archbishop Theodore (<i>d</i>. 690).<br>
<br>The letter sought Berhtwald's advice on a critical problem for Waldhere: he had been called upon to help resolve apparently long-running disputes between the king of the West Saxons (Ine, not named here) and the rulers of the East Saxons (also not named, probably Sigeheard and Sw&aelig;fred); but a synod in the previous year had forbidden the bishops to communicate with the West Saxons while the latter failed to carry out Berhtwald's decree on the consecration of bishops. While the letter implies that the West Saxons had been the aggressors, it is significant that both parties were trying to settle their disputes by negotiation. Although the precise points at issue between the East and West Saxon rulers are obscure, this evidence for negotiation between them corrects the emphasis of other sources which devote themselves entirely to the East Saxons' relations with the powerful Mercian kings. The letter reveals the high status of bishops in secular politics and their role as acceptable mediators: both parties had agreed to assemble at a meeting at Brentford on 15 October and had promised to observe the conditions of the pact agreed between Waldhere and the bishop of the West Saxons.<br>
<br>But most striking is Waldhere's deference to his metropolitan, Berhtwald, whom he addressed as &#145;ruling the government of all Britain&#146; (<i>totius Brettaniae gubernacula regenti</i>; Birch, no. 115, p. 169; <span class="italic">English Historical Documents</span>, 1.729), a valuable confirmation of the pre-eminence which the see at Canterbury had attained by this time. Waldhere had not attended a meeting called by Cenred of Mercia about the reconciliation of a certain &AElig;lfthryth because he had not known the archbishop's views on the matter. He told Berhtwald that he wished to &#145;remain ever of the same opinion as you&#146;. Waldhere was clearly anxious to abide by the decree of the archbishop on the consecration of West Saxon bishops&#151;probably a reference to the division of the West Saxon diocese. Since the letter envisages only one West Saxon bishop, the enactment of this division in 705 following the death of Bishop H&aelig;dde provides its <i>terminus ante quem</i>. It is also the last reference to Waldhere. The probably genuine witness list to an otherwise spurious charter indicates that his successor, Ingwald, was in place by 716.<br>
