<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Paton,  Alexander Allan</span>  (1874&#150;1934), <span class="occ">cotton merchant and broker</span>, was the only son of the five children of Alexander Allan Paton (1837&#150;1904) and his wife, Marie, the daughter of John Crowshaw of New York. His father was a successful Scottish-American cotton merchant who had emigrated to the United States about 1860 and during the American Civil War worked for the United States mail railroad, initially as a conductor. After the war he became general freight agent of the Memphis and Louisville railroad, but then in 1868 established a cotton marketing firm with branches in St Louis, Memphis, New Orleans, and Liverpool. R. G. Dun's Memphis agent reported in 1875 that Paton &#145;st[an]ds well with the Trade and Banks. Does an extensive business and is a shrewd and ever pushing man.&#146;<br>
<br>These firms did well, and by the early 1880s they were worth in America somewhere between $150,000 and $200,000. The Liverpool branch was managed by Paton's elder brother, Andrew Brown Paton (1833&#150;1913), who, after private school and London University, had been a Congregational minister, but had retired from the ministry in 1869 on account of ill health. In 1889 Alexander Paton senior returned to Liverpool and established his own firm of Paton, Maclaren &amp; Co. He managed the Liverpool branch, while George S. Maclaren took care of the Memphis branch. By 1900 this firm had become one of the largest cotton importers in Liverpool. A. B. Paton's firm also grew. After he retired in 1902, Andrew Vaughan Paton, A. A. Paton's nephew, succeeded, and in 1917 became president of the Liverpool cotton exchange. Alexander Paton junior therefore grew up in a rising Liverpool cotton marketing family.<br>
<br>When his father returned to England in 1889, Alexander Paton entered the Leys School, Cambridge. He joined his father's new Liverpool firm in 1892, and became a partner in 1898. In 1899, having learned the trade, he was sent out to manage the firm's purchasing operations in Memphis. He returned to Liverpool in 1903 and took over the business with a capital of about &pound;20,000 from his father, who died in 1904. Barings' Liverpool branch reported: &#145;There is every reason to suppose the &hellip; firm will continue to be well and prudently conducted.&#146; The firm indeed did well and in 1911 had branches in Liverpool and Memphis and also in Dallas, Hillsboro, and Sulphur Springs, Texas. Barings provided Paton Maclaren with credits. The firm purchased cotton in the southern USA, hedged it in New York, shipped it to Liverpool, and sold to a circle of Lancashire mills.<br>
<br>Paton quickly rose in the Liverpool cotton trade. He was a director of the Liverpool Cotton Association from 1907 to 1910 and was on the council of the British Cotton Growing Association. When the First World War broke out in August 1914, the Bank of Liverpool appointed him as one of two cotton directors to help restore confidence. The war ended normal peace-time operations, but Paton was able to use his commercial experience well. From 1915 to 1918 he worked in the contraband department of the ministry of blockade in the British embassy in Washington. In 1917 he advised the Balfour mission to the United States on the blockade. He declined an offer of an OBE for his work in 1918. He was at the Versailles peace conference in 1919 as adviser &#145;in charge of the Establishment at the Hotel Majestic&#146;, for which he was made a CB in 1920.<br>
<br>Paton re-entered the cotton trade after the war, but there is little information about the firm's activities. Generally Liverpool firms never recovered their pre-war position. Instead American firms such as Anderson Clayton dominated the trade, establishing buying agencies in the southern states and selling direct to continental European spinners. In Britain, however, the cotton trade was so large and varied that the Liverpool cotton exchange and Liverpool brokers remained vital intermediaries. Paton became vice-president of the cotton exchange in 1925 and president in 1926. He was also a member of the New York cotton exchange. He found additional new interests especially in the important financial institutions in Liverpool that had originally been created to service the cotton and other trades.<br>
<br>Paton continued to serve as director of the Bank of Liverpool and was deputy chairman from 1922 to 1929 and chairman from 1929 to 1934. While he was deputy chairman, the bank merged with Martins. When he became chairman he opened a new head office and reformed the bank's management. He also served on a bevy of insurance companies. He joined the board of the Royal Insurance Company in 1910 and became deputy chairman in 1924 and chairman in 1930. He was also chairman of the Liverpool and London and Globe, and a director of the Thames and Mersey, the Legal, and the British Foreign and Marine Insurance companies.<br>
<br>The cotton trade at that time provided many of the civic leaders in Liverpool. The elder Patons were strong believers in practical social reform. A. A. Paton senior served as a Liberal on the council, A. B. Paton was a generous philanthropist, and another brother, Dr John Brown Paton, was first principal of Nottingham Congregational college. The younger Paton also served as a Liberal on the Liverpool council, representing Sefton Park in 1911. On the council his main interests were as treasurer of the Unemployed Fund and president of the labour inquiry sub-committee which investigated unemployment. After the war he became an important supporter of the voluntary hospitals in Liverpool. He was president of the Royal Southern Hospital and on the board of the Liverpool Hospital for Consumption. He proposed that the Liverpool hospitals should merge to gain economies of scale. Then, as in America, high fees paid by the wealthy could subsidize services for the poor.<br>
<br>Paton never married, but found many other interests. Aside from public service he played cricket and golf and was a member of the Royal Clyde Yacht Club. In 1928 he purchased <i>Lulworth</i>, a fast racing cutter in which he was once able to defeat Sir Thomas Lipton's <i>Shamrock V</i> at Cowes. Paton died at his home, The Rocklands, Thornton Hough, Bebington, in the Wirral, on 27 June 1934, aged sixty, still holding many offices. All the managers of Martins Bank and the leaders of the insurance companies, the hospitals, and the cotton trade attended his funeral in Liverpool on 30 June. Paton was a quiet but effective man. Contemporary comments reveal that, despite a reserved and sardonic exterior, he privately earned affection for many generous acts. His estate in Britain passed largely to his sisters and their descendants. He also left assets in America.<br>
