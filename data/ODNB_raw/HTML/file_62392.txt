<span class="headword">Toynbee,  Jocelyn Mary Catherine</span>  (1897&#150;1985), <span class="occ">archaeologist and art historian</span>, was born at 12 Upper Westbourne Terrace, Paddington, London, on 3 March 1897, the daughter of Harry Valpy Toynbee (1861&#150;1941), secretary of the Charity Organization Society, and his wife Sarah Edith, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Marshall (1859&#150;1939). She was educated at Winchester High School for Girls and at Newnham College, Cambridge, where she was awarded firsts in both parts of the classical tripos (1919 and 1920). Her family was noted for its scholarly talents and its social concerns; her mother, who had been a student at Newnham and had taken a first in the Cambridge historical tripos, was a particularly important influence upon her. These family traits were continued in her own generation by her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31769/', "Arnold Joseph Toynbee")</script> and her sister Margaret, as well as by herself.<br>
<br>After briefly teaching classics at Cheltenham Ladies' College, at twenty-four Toynbee was appointed tutor in classics at St Hugh's College, Oxford, a post she held from 1921 to 1924, when she resigned along with the other tutors in protest against the dismissal of Cecilia Ady by the principal Eleanor Jourdain. She then became lecturer in classics at Reading University. Her election in 1927 as fellow and director of studies in classics at Newnham and appointment in 1931 as lecturer in classics at Cambridge provided her with a secure post and an ideal base for developing her own research interests. She held these posts until 1951.<br>
<br>Toynbee played a notably supportive role at Newnham. She was a devoted and sympathetic tutor of undergraduates. At first meeting she might appear austere and a little forbidding, but her charm and obvious humanity were quick to emerge. She helped many of her pupils to find posts after graduation. She was also a helpful and careful supervisor of research students, though at no stage did they constitute a school. Her lectures were distinguished by her great powers of exposition as well as by her wide and deep knowledge of her subject. She was not an active excavator or field worker, but she was an accomplished interpreter of archaeological evidence. Her particular forte was Roman art, encouraged by early contacts with Eug&eacute;nie Strong, though this was as broadly based as it could be, including architecture, coinage, dress, and even hair-styles. In the mid-twentieth century she was the leading British scholar in Roman artistic studies and one of the recognized authorities in this field in the world.<br>
<br>Toynbee's particular interest was the culture of the Roman empire and the continuity of Greek artistic traditions within it. Her major publications began with <span class="italic">The Hadrianic School: a Chapter in the History of Greek Art</span> (1934), based on the dissertation for which she was awarded an Oxford DPhil in 1930, and <span class="italic">Roman Medallions</span> (1944). They were greatly augmented after her election to the Laurence chair of classical archaeology at Cambridge in 1951. Her long career as a college tutor and lecturer who could cover a wide academic range in both classics and the archaeology of the classical world and her world reputation as a scholar and expositor made her the obvious choice for the appointment. Over the following eleven years a series of major works appeared, ranging from Rome to Roman Britain. With J. B. Ward Perkins she published <span class="italic">The Shrine of St Peter and the Vatican Excavations</span> in 1956. As a convert to Roman Catholicism and a devoted Catholic thereafter, this was a project with peculiar significance for her. Her mastery of Roman sculpture and its subtle resonances was brilliantly displayed in <span class="italic">The Flavian Reliefs from the Palazzo della Cancelleria in Rome</span> (1957).<br>
<br>These monographs were accompanied by many papers on individual discoveries from north Africa to the temple of Mithras in London and the moving early Christian mosaic in the villa at Hinton St Mary in Dorset. Toynbee's interest in the art of Roman Britain revealed a wide appreciation of provincial and Celtic art as well as work in the Graeco-Roman tradition. At the time of her retirement from the Laurence chair, in 1962, she was involved with a major exhibition of Romano-British art at the then Guildhall Museum in London, for which she wrote the catalogue <span class="italic">Art in Roman Britain</span> (1962). This was shortly followed by <span class="italic">Art in Britain under the Romans</span> (1964). Her retirement to Oxford, where she joined her sister Margaret, opened another productive phase. <span class="italic">Death and Burial in the Roman World</span> (1971) covered an immense sweep from Etruscan Italy to the Ostrogothic kingdom. <span class="italic">Animals in Roman Life and Art</span> (1973) is a delightfully characteristic work which reminded her former Cambridge pupils of lectures in earlier decades. <span class="italic">Roman Historical Portraits</span> (1977) was more severely technical and lacked the humane insights of her earlier studies.<br>
<br>At the heart of Jocelyn Toynbee's life and work was her devotion to learning, especially classical learning. Given the scholarly nature of her family, this is understandable. For her, scholarship was an essential and unquestionable part of life. She was genuinely distressed by the thought that schools might not provide instruction in Latin. Administration was not a field in which she felt at home, but she met its inevitable demands with dutiful attention. Her wise counsel was deployed at Newnham and in the learned societies to which she belonged. She was a determined fighter for the causes she espoused, but she won many to her side by her total absence of rancour. Long after her formal retirement she was still advising research students and other young scholars, despite increasing deafness. Until shortly before her death she was still eager to hear of new discoveries and reinterpretations.<br>
<br>Toynbee was a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries (1943), which awarded her the Frend medal for her contributions to the archaeology of the Christian church, a fellow and medallist of the Royal Numismatic Society, and a fellow of the British Academy (1952). She also received honorary doctorates from the universities of Newcastle (1967) and Liverpool (1968). She died, unmarried, at 4 Marston Ferry Road, Oxford, on 31 December 1985.<br>
