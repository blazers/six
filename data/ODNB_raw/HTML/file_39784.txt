<span class="headword">Lambton,  George</span>  (1860&#150;1945), <span class="occ">racehorse trainer and writer</span>, was born on 23 November 1860 at Fenton, Northumberland, the fifth son of George Frederick D'Arcy Lambton, second earl of Durham (1828&#150;1879), and his wife, Lady Beatrix Francis Hamilton (<i>d</i>. 1871). Educated privately before proceeding to Eton in 1873, Lambton was a keen huntsman from the start, &#145;blooded&#146; at the age of seven. After only three years at Eton he moved to a tutor in Dorset before going up to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1879. The university was not, however, to his taste and, following the death of his father after his first term there, he left for a crammer at Storrington where he prepared to enter the army. It was later said of Lambton's education that he &#145;found Eton rather too near Ascot and Cambridge rather too near Newmarket&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>), and he left the crammer after a short time also, having decided to make racing his career.<br>
<br>Lambton began as an amateur rider, although as a younger son he was not rich and, unlike most of his colleagues, depended on betting to live. His family was steeped in racing and at the time that he rode his first winner, Pompeia, at Nottingham in October 1880, six of his brothers had thoroughbreds in training. He enjoyed a successful racing career, winning the Grand Steeplechase de Paris on Parsang, before a heavy fall at Sandown Park in 1892 forced his retirement. During his convalescence he wrote sporting articles for <span class="italic">St Stephen's Review</span>.<br>
<br>Lambton now turned to training and with the help of William Brett, Baron Esher, set up at St Mary's Yard at Newmarket, Suffolk. It was an unusual step for the son of an earl to take, for training was still seen as very much a plebeian concern. But where other &#145;training grooms&#146;, as they were once called, were referred to by their surnames in press reports, the Honourable George, as he was known to the racing fraternity, was always <i>Mister</i> Lambton. He cared little about what society thought, and his indifference and example helped change the status of his chosen profession. But his connections served him well and after some success for Esher, principally with the influential mare Hetty Sorel, he became in 1893 private trainer to Frederick Stanley, sixteenth earl of Derby.<br>
<br>By 1894 Derby had built Bedford Lodge stables for Lambton and had purchased a number of yearlings, including the 1896 Royal Oaks winner, Canterbury Pilgrim, at the sale of the stock of Caroline Agnes, duchess of Montrose. Moving to Derby's newly built Stanley House stables at Newmarket in 1903, he enjoyed considerable success, becoming champion trainer in 1906, when he won his second Oaks with Keystone II. On the death of Derby in 1908 Lambton continued to work for his successor, the seventeenth earl, and between 1908 and 1926 Stanley House sent out eight classic winners and won the trainers' championship twice.<br>
<br>On 7 December 1908 Lambton, known for his dapper dress and handsome appearance, married Cecily Margaret (1882&#150;1972), the daughter of Sir John Horner of Mells. They had four children: John; Edward, who succeeded his father as a trainer; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/99417/', "Ann Katharine Swynford Lambton")</script>, whose middle name commemorated one of her father's St Leger winners; and Sybil, who similarly recalled the 1917 One Thousand Guineas winner, Diadem. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/99417/', "Ann Lambton")</script> later became a renowned scholar of Persian history and the Persian language. Cecily Lambton was herself extremely knowledgeable about horses and a constant support to her husband throughout their long and happy marriage.<br>
<br>In 1926 old age encouraged Lambton to surrender his training responsibilities in favour of managing Derby's horses, but in 1930 financial pressures forced the earl to dismiss his trainer, Frank Butters, and Lambton combined the roles of trainer and manager until 1933. In that year he enjoyed probably his greatest success, winning the Derby and the St Leger with the magnificent Hyperion. It therefore came as a particular shock when in November Derby wrote informing him that he would not be required as trainer for the following year. Lambton's ill health was undoubtedly a factor in Derby's thinking and he offered a generous pension to his trainer, whom he expected would now retire. In fact Lambton was determined to continue, and hoped to provide a platform for his son Edward, and he felt that his prospects had been harmed by Derby's actions. It was particularly sad that one of the great partnerships in English racing should thus end acrimoniously.<br>
<br>Lambton next purchased the Kremlin House stables and trained the horses of his nephew the fifth earl of Durham, and after an indifferent start began winning again, securing his last classic, the Irish One Thousand Guineas, with Major Dermot McCalmont's Lapel in 1938. During the war he made an influential appeal for the continuation of racing, on the same grounds that he had defended it during the First World War, arguing that a prolonged break would destroy the industry and that the public in any case wanted racing to continue. He won the Lincolnshire handicap in 1941 and sent out his last winner, Golden Cloud, at Windsor early in June 1945. He was too ill, though, to see it win, and died at his home, Mesnil Warren, in Newmarket on 23 July 1945. He was deeply mourned by the racing community and not least by Derby, with whom there had been a rapprochement in later years.<br>
<br>As well as enjoying success as a trainer Lambton was also the first to demonstrate to a sceptical Jockey Club the potential influence of doping in racing. The practice of using cocaine as a dope had been brought to Britain by American trainers and jockeys in the late 1890s, and by 1900 it had become &#145;a serious menace&#146;  (Lambton, 254), threatening to undermine the whole bloodstock business. In 1903 its influence was so harmful that Lambton decided to act, informing one of the Jockey Club stewards of his intent. He doped five of his more mediocre charges, what he called the &#145;biggest rogues in training&#146;  (ibid., 255), and watched four of them win and one come second; he was careful not to bet on any of these races. The stewards, having seen reluctant and incompetent animals transformed into unstoppable athletes, banned doping, which in 1904 became a criminal offence. He was not solely acting to protect the business interests of the racing community but was concerned equally for the welfare of the animals involved and his love of horses and respect for them is conveyed strongly in his 1924 memoir <span class="italic">Men and Horses I have Known</span>, from which he emerges as a genial and opinionated professional. Discursive and entertaining, it is a record of every celebrity of the turf during the heyday of English racing and it remains, like its author, one of the most popular of its kind in the sport.<br>
