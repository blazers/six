<span class="headword">Robert the Lotharingian</span> <span class="st"> [Robert  de Losinga]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1095), <span class="occ">bishop of Hereford</span>, was an active and scholarly post-conquest prelate.<h2>
<a name="Backgroundandearlycareer"></a>Background and early career</h2>Robert was by origin a Lotharingian, probably from Li&egrave;ge or the surrounding area. Although his name is often given as Robert de Losinga, on the assumption that he was associated with Herbert de Losinga, bishop of Norwich, the most reliable early source which gives him a cognomen, William of Malmesbury's <span class="italic">Gesta pontificum</span>, terms him &#145;Lotharingus&#146; (&#145;the Lotharingian&#146;); while in the Hereford Cathedral obit book, itself mid-thirteenth-century but copying older material, he occurs as &#145;Roberti Lothogaringi&#146;. Supporting evidence of his origins comes in the obit book of the cathedral of Li&egrave;ge, in Lower Lotharingia, where, under 26 June, is recorded &#145;Commemoratio fratris nostri domini Roberti episcopi de Herdeffordh&#146;, which suggests, by its use of the phrase <i>frater noster</i> (&#145;our brother&#146;), that Robert had probably been a canon of Li&egrave;ge Cathedral. If so, he would have been educated at Li&egrave;ge Cathedral school, one of the few places in northern Europe in the period specializing in mathematics, one of Robert's main interests. His date of birth is unknown, but since he became bishop in 1079 it is unlikely to have been after 1049. He had a brother called Gerard, who became a member of Hereford Cathedral chapter.<br>
<br>Robert's education would have opened prospects in England, where, until the twelfth century, the standard of education for secular clerics, as opposed to monks, was low. It can be debated whether he arrived in England before or after the conquest. On the one hand, most of the Lotharingian clerics who came to England in the eleventh century are to be found there by the death of Edward the Confessor, who, out of all the eleventh-century English kings, seems most to have encouraged their influx. He required learned secular clerics to serve him at court as monks were educated but vowed to stability. A priest called Robert occurs in Edward's time, witnessing charters of 1050 and slightly later, and also occurring as witness in a forgery for Westminster, supposedly of 1065; he may perhaps be identifiable with the Robert who became bishop, or, alternatively, with the Robert who occurs as monk of Stow in <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span>. However, if we accept an early arrival for Robert the Lotharingian, the gap in references to him between the 1050s and 1079 is hard to explain, and it is rather more likely that he was invited to England by William the Conqueror, who is known to have invited Walcher, bishop of Durham (1071&#150;80), another cleric from Li&egrave;ge.<br>
<br>Also unclear is how Robert supported himself before his consecration. It is known, however, that at least by the 1080s he had close relations with the bishop of Exeter (perhaps the Lotharingian-educated Leofric, 1046&#150;72), who gave him the church of Bampton in Oxfordshire which he was holding in 1086. However, this could be explained as a gift to a highly thought-of fellow bishop seeking a resting place on journeys between Hereford and London, paralleled by the grant to Robert by Maurice, bishop of London (1086&#150;1107), of a prebend of St Paul's. One piece of patronage which might, however, be older is the gift of one hide, held in 1066 by one of Harold's priests but in 1086 by Robert, on the manor of Writtle in Essex. William I would have taken over the manor in 1066 and would probably have dispossessed Harold's priest immediately. Another source of support for Robert before his consecration appears to have been Wulfstan, bishop of Worcester, who ordained him priest, and who became a close friend.<h2>
<a name="BishopofHerefordandscholar"></a>Bishop of Hereford and scholar</h2>In 1079 Robert was appointed bishop of Hereford in succession to Walter, a fellow Lotharingian; he was consecrated at Canterbury on 29 December. Although evidence suggests that Robert attended court infrequently, the absence of references is deceptive. For example, no source records that he attended the great meeting at Gloucester at Christmas 1085, but he almost certainly was there, for he took a great interest in the <span class="roman">Domesday</span> survey, a description of which he entered into his only surviving literary work, a commentary on the method of dating the incarnation adopted by Marianus Scottus, the chronicler. Furthermore, his mathematical abilities could hardly have been overlooked by William I; indeed, it has been plausibly suggested that Robert was one of the <span class="roman">Domesday</span> commissioners, possibly for the south-eastern circuit, though there is no decisive evidence to prove it. Robert's particular value to William I and William II probably lay in his knowledge of how to use the abacus. Although the abacus had been brought to England earlier, knowledge of it was still so rare in the eleventh century that he won a reputation for his skill and Geoffrey, prior of Winchester, wrote an epitaph for him referring to it.<br>
<br>The most significant surviving outcome of Robert's interest in computation is his short commentary on the chronological treatise by Marianus Scottus which formed the preface to the latter's universal chronicle. Marianus's chronicle, composed before 1082 in Mainz, adopted Abbo of Fleury's theory that Christ's nativity had occurred twenty-two years earlier than the dating proposed by Dionysius Exiguus (<i>fl</i>. 525), according to a re-examination of the astronomical data in the gospels. The method chosen by Marianus was termed <i>anni secundum evangelium</i> (&#145;years according to the gospel&#146;). Robert appears to have been responsible for having Marianus's work brought to England, where, perhaps under his supervision, a short entry on <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span> was added under the year corresponding to 1086 in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> dating in one of the earliest English manuscripts  (BL, Cotton MS Nero C.v); he was also probably instrumental in introducing Marianus's work to Worcester, where it was to be used by John of Worcester as one of the main sources for his chronicle (completed in 1140). No copy of Marianus was preserved at Hereford, but Robert's interest in history is suggested by the existence of brief historical works, an extract from Isidore's chronicle and Eutropius's <span class="italic">Breviarium ab urbe condita</span>, in a manuscript probably made at Hereford in Robert's time  (Hereford Cathedral, MS O.ii.9), and lists of popes, patriarchs and emperors, and other figures in another, probably contemporary, Hereford manuscript  (Hereford Cathedral, MS O.ii.7). Robert's commentary on Marianus, however, is exclusively about computation, and its only claim to originality lies in a few corrections to Marianus's chronology. It survives in eight manuscripts and was known to William of Malmesbury and John of Worcester.<h2>
<a name="PatronageandreorganizationatHereford"></a>Patronage and reorganization at Hereford</h2>Robert imported other ideas from the Holy Roman empire as well. At Hereford he had built a square two-storey episcopal chapel on a central plan, with the upper chapel forming a gallery, around an octagonal well. William of Malmesbury (who mistakenly records this building as the cathedral) likened it to the imperial chapel at Aachen, though a closer parallel can be found in, for example, the chapel of St Martin and St Emmeram built at Speyer Cathedral <i>c</i>.1080&#150;90. The choice of patron saints for Robert's chapel, St Catherine and St Mary Magdalen, also reflects spiritual fashions in Lotharingia, where awareness of eastern Mediterranean cults was stronger than in England in the eleventh century. Although the plan of the chapel shows German influence, the masonry is typical of the Anglo-Norman school. Robert also appears to have commissioned a two-storey chapel at his manor house at Bampton, and he rewarded his mason with a small tenancy on an episcopal manor in Herefordshire.<br>
<br>The chapel at Hereford was staffed by four chaplains, who also formed part of the cathedral community and who were provided with separate holdings on the estates of the church of Hereford, as were the rest of the cathedral community, described in <span class="roman">Domesday</span> as &#145;clerks&#146; and as &#145;bishop's clerks&#146;. About half these holdings survived as later prebendal endowments. The number of cathedral clergy in Robert's time, calculated from the <span class="roman">Domesday</span> returns, was very close to the <i>numerus clausus</i> (&#145;set limit&#146;) of the thirteenth century, and almost certainly it was Robert who established the cathedral chapter of Hereford in the form it was to take for the rest of the middle ages. He almost certainly appointed the first known archdeacon of Hereford and probably also the first dean, his brother Gerard.<br>
<br>Control of the estates of the church of Hereford remained in the bishop's hands; Robert, while recognizing the rights of the community to a share in them, did not make a formal division of lands between himself and his chapter, and the main heading of the <span class="roman">Domesday</span> entry, &#145;Lands of the church of Hereford&#146;, was probably deliberately chosen to underline the unity of the church. Subinfeudation was carefully limited; very few of the tenants were important enough to be named in <span class="roman">Domesday</span>, and most of the knights' holdings are small subsections of manors, usually no more than a hide apiece. One of Robert's subtenants, however, was powerful: this was Roger de Lacy, for whom Robert issued a charter granting his fee after the death of his father. Robert's grant carefully specified that he was to hold it for one life only, and the form of charter used, a chirograph imitating late Anglo-Saxon episcopal leases, was doubtless chosen to underline this, though in practice the Lacy family could not be dislodged. The hand in which the charter is written is a continental book-hand, probably Lotharingian.<h2>
<a name="RelationswithWulfstanofWorcesteranddeath"></a>Relations with Wulfstan of Worcester, and death</h2>According to William of Malmesbury, Robert would take refuge from legal business in the household of his friend Wulfstan, bishop of Worcester. His links with the diocese of Worcester were close enough for him to be chosen to lay the first stone of the new church of St Peter's Abbey, Gloucester, on 29 June 1089, and he also attended the translation of the relics of St Oswald of Worcester into Wulfstan's new cathedral there, on 8 October, possibly in 1089 when the choir of the new building was advanced enough for the monks to move in. In 1094 Wulfstan made his confession to Robert and asked to be scourged by him. In January 1095 Robert, then at the royal court at Cricklade, had a vision in which Wulfstan informed him of his death; Robert presided over the funeral. Just before this (according to William of Malmesbury's <span class="italic">Gesta pontificum</span>) or thirty days after the death (according to John of Worcester), Robert had another vision of Wulfstan, who this time announced to his friend that he too had not much longer to live and ordered him to amend his ways. In March 1095 Robert attended the Council of Rockingham, where he promised William Rufus that he would not recognize Anselm as archbishop; but after Whitsun he met Anselm and did penance for this. He died on 26 June 1095 and was buried in Hereford Cathedral.<br>
