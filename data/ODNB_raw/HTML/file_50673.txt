<span class="headword">Fettiplace <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Poole; <em>other married name </em>Rogers]</span>,  Elinor</span>, Lady Fettiplace  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1570, <em>d.</em> in or after 1647), <span class="occ">writer on household management</span>, probably born at Pauntley, Gloucestershire, was the eldest daughter of Sir Henry Poole (<i>d</i>. 1616) of Sapperton in Gloucestershire, and his wife, Anne, daughter of Sir William Wroughton of Broad Hinton in Wiltshire. She married Richard Fettiplace (1564&#150;1615) of Appleton in Berkshire in 1589. Lady Fettiplace is chiefly remembered for her household book, dated on the flyleaf 1604, which is among the earliest surviving manuscripts of its kind. It is a collection of recipes, remedies, and housekeeping tips, produced at a time when women were not normally taught to read or write, remarkable for its clear, coherent, vigorous, and intricately detailed account of Jacobean country-house life.<br>
<br>The book, like its author, stood at a turning point between old and new orders in England: the Fettiplaces were an ancient Norman family hoping to revive failing fortunes by an alliance with the dynamic and innovative modern world of the Pooles. Elinor's grandfather had been a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Protector Somerset, and her father was one of a key group of courtiers, including Robert Cecil, many of whom stayed in the magnificent Renaissance mansion at Sapperton designed to rival the house built by Poole's brother-in-law Sir John Thynne at Longleat. One of Elinor's contributors was her cousin, Gresham Thynne. Another was Gresham's step-uncle Sir Walter Ralegh, who supplied two versions of a costly narcotic, &#145;Tobacca water&#146;. Other receipts came from a network of west country friends, relations, and neighbours, such as Shakespeare's son-in-law, the surgeon John Hall.<br>
<br>Lady Fettiplace inherited a tradition of lavish hospitality, catering in the relatively modest twelfth-century manor at Appleton for a &#145;family&#146; of twenty or thirty members (servants, retainers, and dependants as well as her own two sons and three daughters). She could expect to feed two or three times as many people at great seasonal feasts in the winter months on the produce of her dairy, garden, orchards, and fields, all of which had to be gathered, processed, and stored in still room, kitchen, and cellar throughout the rest of the year. Apart from a few imported luxury items (gold leaf and crushed pearls, for instance, in a princely &#145;Spanish marmalad&#146;), the household was self-sufficient. Lady Fettiplace produced her own ink, soap, toothpaste, cosmetics, flea powder, rat poison, and weedkiller. She described how to bleach linen, perfume gloves, and launder delicate gold or coloured silks. Her house served as surgery and dispensary for the surrounding countryside: bubonic plague was a constant threat&#151;&#145;if this Drink be taken before the markes appeare, it helpeth by the grace of god&#146; she noted at the foot of a bitter herbal &#145;medicine of King Henry the eighth for the plague or pestilence&#146;  (Spurling, 17). She included thirty-six ways of dressing wounds, nearly four dozen remedies for failing eyesight, two dozen plasters or potions to relieve stomach trouble, sixteen cough mixtures, eleven cures for a bad back, and seven for insomnia.<br>
<br>Lady Fettiplace's cookery recipes looked forward rather than back to the medieval past: she used no saffron or other artificial colourings; her sauces were thickened with egg yolks rather than breadcrumbs; Arab ingredients such as rosewater, dried fruit, and spices were used sparingly. For the most part her food was simple and fresh-tasting, subtly flavoured, delicate and decorative but not over-rich, a repertoire reflecting the same taste for clarity, lightness, and elegance as the architecture of Longleat or Sapperton. Dishes like her mutton with claret wine and Seville orange juice in the gravy, poached trout, spinach tart, her sweet creams, custards and cheesecakes, belong to a European tradition which nearly four centuries later was still running strong in English or French bourgeois cooking. Her recipe for meringues (&#145;white bisket bread&#146;) predated by at least fifty years the earliest published reference in France. Preserving fruit (then only recently made possible by the first sugar refineries) was her passion.<br>
<br>At some point after the death of Sir Richard Fettiplace in 1615, Lady Fettiplace married a citizen of Gloucester called Edward Rogers (<i>d</i>. 1623). Her second husband was probably from the Rogers family of Dowdeswell, who were part of the Pooles' local circuit of Gloucestershire squires. Lady Fettiplace lived on until about 1647, in which year she left her book to her niece Anne, daughter of her brother, Sir Henry Poole the younger of Sapperton: &#145;Thes bock I geve to my deare nees and goddutar M<sup>rs</sup> Anne Hornar desyring her to kepe it for my sake: 1647&#146;  (Spurling, 35).<br>
<br>Lady Fettiplace had connections with leading figures of her day from Ralegh and Cecil to Francis Bacon, and her book gives a rare glimpse of their expansive, enquiring, empirical spirit at work in a domestic context.<br>
