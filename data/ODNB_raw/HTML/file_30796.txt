<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bates,  Herbert Ernest</span>  (1905&#150;1974), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 16 May 1905 at 51 Grove Road, Rushden, Northamptonshire, the eldest of the three children (two sons and a daughter) of Albert Ernest Bates (1879&#150;1949) and his wife, Lucy Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lucas (1878&#150;1972). He came from a family of shoemakers; his maternal grandfather's craftsmanship was renowned, and his parents also followed the trade. As he was to write later, he:<blockquote>grew up in an atmosphere of intense respectability &hellip; My parents were never a farthing in debt; great was the pride they took, as my grandparents did, in paying their way &hellip; My father pursued his passion for nature and the countryside, and incidentally fostered my own.</blockquote>Rushden, which became Evensford in his fiction, was to carry much imaginative weight, and a love of nature was to become, next to writing, the absorption of his own life. After his death it was written that &#145;as he wrote he gardened and as he gardened he wrote&#146;.<br>
<br>From a local school Bates failed his public-school entrance examination but won a free place at Kettering grammar school, where he stayed until he was just over sixteen. Here he was inspired to be a writer by his English master, Edmund Kirby, to whom he later dedicated two books. He achieved a third class in the joint Oxford and Cambridge university certificate but was dissuaded from a university education by his father. This decision influenced his later literary output as a &#145;self-made&#146; writer of character, rather than of ideas  (Baldwin, 44). He was thenceforth always outside literary circles and untouched by modernism.<br>
<br>At sixteen Bates became a reporter for the Wellingborough branch of the Northampton <span class="italic">Chronicle</span>, and then a warehouse clerk for a leather merchant in Rushden. It was here that he began to write in earnest. Although he rejected his parents' Methodism and indeed all organized religious beliefs in his early twenties, he had poetry on a religious theme published in <span class="italic">The Kettering Reminder</span>, and indeed he first saw himself as a poet. His early verse is imbued with a Romantic sensibility typical of Georgian poetry. This exposure led to a weekly column written under the name Boy Blue called &#145;At the Sign of the Rainbow&#146; which lasted for four months. During this time he was reading Chekhov, Maupassant, Flaubert, and Turgenev, and writing his first novel, <span class="italic">The Two Sisters</span> (1926), which after being rejected nine times was accepted by Edward Garnett at Jonathan Cape, who mistook Bates, writing as H. E. Bates, for a woman. This novel was experimental in its narrative of &#145;emotion states punctuated by moments of crisis&#146;  (Baldwin, 65). Garnett came to act as his chief reader and literary adviser, and Bates was to continue under his tutelage until Garnett's death in 1937. Bates was later to pay his own touching and memorable tribute in his <span class="italic">Edward Garnett: a Personal Portrait</span>, published in 1950. For some twenty years, and for about as many books, Cape was to be Bates's publisher. His sales, however, claimed Cape, never earned fully the advances he paid against them.<br>
<br>Bates followed his first success to London and worked briefly, at Garnett's instigation, in the children's department of John and Edward Bumpus, booksellers. His book <span class="italic">The Seekers</span>, a children's fantasy, was promoted by the Bumpus brothers in their Christmas catalogue. This job was his last formal employment. From now on he devoted himself entirely to writing. Short stories, the work for which he will be remembered and revered, were appearing in the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span> and the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>. During these early years Bates lacked confidence and struggled for inspiration. A collection of short stories, <span class="italic">Day's End</span>, was published in 1928; and in 1929, more traditional than <span class="italic">Two Sisters</span>, came <span class="italic">Catherine Foster</span>, the plot of which is borrowed from <span class="italic">Madame Bovary</span>. Only with <span class="italic">Charlotte's Row</span> (1931) did Bates begin to find his own voice, drawing on his father's past and his Northamptonshire upbringing.<br>
<br>On 18 July 1931 Bates married Marjorie Helen (1909&#150;2004), known as Madge, the daughter of a soldier, Herbert Henry Cox, whom he had met in Rushden. Madge provided Bates with the security he craved as a writer. They settled in Little Chart, Ashford, Kent, which was to provide much inspiration for books on gardening. They had two sons and two daughters. One son, Richard, was later to make for himself a distinguished career in television and was to adapt for that medium many of his father's most successful novels and short stories.<br>
<br>Bates displayed a new confidence in his work in the 1930s, such as <span class="italic">The Fallow Land</span> (1932), a tale of rural life. Marriage acted as a stabilizing force, and Bates began to solidify his position within the tradition of rural fiction with <span class="italic">The Poacher</span> (1935), and proved an unsentimental and yet lyrical chronicler of the country. Occasionally relegating character to scene, he was at his best when the mood of character and nature were symbolically fused. His stories about Uncle Silas (1940), a Rabelaisian nonagenarian peasant farmer, based on his uncle Joseph Betts, were very popular. Bates also published nature essays in <span class="italic">Through the Woods</span> (1936) and <span class="italic">Down the River</span> (1937), both of which expressed early environmentalist opinions. <span class="italic">Spella Ho</span> (1938) was the industrial counterpart to the rural novels. Finances were tight, so Bates also wrote a regular column, &#145;Country life&#146;, for <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, and reviews for the <span class="italic">New Clarion</span> and <span class="italic">John O'London's Weekly</span>. His collection of short stories <span class="italic">The Woman who had Imagination</span> (1934) brought him critical acclaim, and with the further collection, <span class="italic">Cut and Come Again</span> (1935), Bates was firmly established as one of the most gifted short-story writers. The latter volume remains his greatest achievement in the genre. He wrote about technique in <span class="italic">The Modern English Short Story: a Critical Survey</span> (1950).<br>
<br>The Second World War was for Bates the turning point of his career. During 1941 he was recruited, without precedent, to the Royal Air Force as a morale-boosting short-story writer&#151;officially a flight lieutenant to public relations, Air Ministry. He was granted unusual freedom of movement at Oakington near Cambridge and a year later had become squadron leader and, under the pseudonym Flying Officer X, author of <span class="italic">The Greatest People in the World</span> (1942). These stories immortalized air force pilots. The eventual publishing success was enormous and Cape at last had a financially rewarding H. E. Bates in his list. But after a wrangle with Cape over royalties (Cape maintained that as a civil servant Bates should receive very little), Bates transferred allegiance to Michael Joseph, who remained his publishers for the rest of his life. His first book for them was <span class="italic">Fair Stood the Wind for France</span> (1945), hailed as a masterpiece in America, but lacking the depth of his other work.<br>
<br>In addition to the Flying Officer X stories, Bates's output during the war was prolific, including <span class="italic">The Bride Comes to Evensford</span> (1943). Under the impetus of war and the sudden flowering of popular success Bates was now to write a long series of best-sellers. Chosen by book clubs, reissued by Penguin, translated throughout the world, made often into films, titles still famous after a generation came from him in extraordinary succession. <span class="italic">The Purple Plain</span> (1947), <span class="italic">The Jacaranda Tree</span> (1952), and <span class="italic">The Scarlet Sword</span> (1950) derived from his travels in India and Burma with the Royal Air Force. He returned again to Northamptonshire for <span class="italic">The Sleepless Moon</span> (1956) and <span class="italic">Love for Lydia</span> (1952), a historical novel and perhaps his most accomplished. In <span class="italic">The Face of England</span> (1953) he showed concern for the direction of change in Britain after the devastation of war, and he revised <span class="italic">O More than Happy Countryman</span> (1943) and <span class="italic">In the Heart of the Country</span> (1942) as <span class="italic">The Country Heart</span> (1949), setting out his love for rural England.<br>
<br>Bates scaled the heights of popularity and success with <span class="italic">The Darling Buds of May</span> (1958), which began an earthy series of rusticity for which he may be best remembered. <span class="italic">Darling Buds</span> was Bates's response to what he called the &#145;bony, steely, wiry, unbending time&#146; of the welfare state years, and to the critics who had &#145;ignored or slighted&#146; his work  (Baldwin, 198). The critics despised the carnivalesque Larkin family, but in his autobiography Bates rose in their defence: &#145;the books are as English as puns, steak and kidney pudding and Canterbury Tales of Chaucer&#146;. The novels were filmed as an enormously popular television series in 1991.<br>
<br>Great affluence came to Bates late in life, but illness and overwork gradually took their toll. There was a sense that final, popular, works such as <span class="italic">A Moment in Time</span> (1964) and <span class="italic">A Crown of Wild Myrtle</span> (1962) were artistically weak; and <span class="italic">The Wedding Party</span> (1965) was &#145;one of the least happy of his collections of stories&#146;  (Baldwin, 214). In February 1966 he suffered two heart attacks and a bout of pneumonia. He continued to write, producing the experimental <span class="italic">The Distant Horns of Summer</span> (1967) and <span class="italic">The White Admiral</span> (1968), the best of his children's books, which dramatized warfare among wasps, moths, and bees in Flying Officer X style. He also produced three volumes of memoirs, two books on gardening, and a handful of magazine articles. He was made CBE in 1973. After being admitted to the Kent and Canterbury Hospital in January 1974, Bates died on 28 January of kidney failure and related complications. He was cremated in a private ceremony. His poetry was finally collected in <span class="italic">Give them their Life</span> in 1990.<br>
<br>Critics place Bates's reputation as lying firmly with his short story collections. Descending from both the Romantic and the naturalistic literary traditions, Bates fused these sensibilities in an original and commanding way. Remaining detached from moral, philosophical, political, and religious preoccupations of the twentieth century, Bates was always more concerned with individuals rather than with movements, with established techniques rather than with experiment. Often neglected, Bates contributed to a vital tradition in twentieth-century literature.<br>
