<span class="headword">Lloyd,  William</span>  (1636/7&#150;1710), <span class="occ">bishop of Norwich and nonjuror</span>, was born at Bala, Merioneth, the son of Edward Lloyd (<i>d</i>. 1685?), rector of Llangower, Merioneth. He was educated at Ruthin School for two years under Mr Chaloner, and was admitted to St John's College, Cambridge, on 23 February 1655, aged eighteen, graduating BA in 1659 and proceeding MA in 1662.<br>
<br>John Evelyn, attending his parish church at Deptford, Kent, in August 1662, heard Lloyd preach a sermon and in August 1663 described him as &#145;our curate&#146;  (Evelyn, 3.361). Lloyd then spent some time ministering to the English factory at Lisbon, for in June 1670 the king asked that Lloyd, a &#145;chaplain in ordinary&#146;, be created DD by royal mandate, &#145;although wanting two years of his full standing, he having taken great pains&#146; in Lisbon and being set to return to Portugal  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1670</i>, 292). This was duly granted and in July he was described by Evelyn as &#145;preacher at Gray's Inn&#146;. In December 1670 Evelyn described him as &#145;chaplain to his Majesty&#146;  (Evelyn, 3.552, 565).<br>
<br>On 4 May 1672 Lloyd was collated a prebendary of St Paul's, and in February 1673 Evelyn described him as &#145;my Lord Treasurer's chaplain&#146;  (Evelyn, 4.3), a reference to Thomas Clifford, Lord Clifford. In March Henry Coventry, secretary of state, intimated that &#145;Dr. Lloyd of Battersea&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1675</i>, 472) would succeed to the vacant bishopric of Llandaff, and he was duly confirmed as such on 18 April 1675, the last Welsh-speaker to hold the diocese for two hundred years. In April a warrant was issued for Lloyd to hold his prebend in St Paul's and the rectory of St Andrew's, Llandaff, <i>in commendam</i>, but a successor was collated to his prebend in March 1676. As a bishop Lloyd proved to be a rigorous supporter of the Restoration church settlement, in both church and secular affairs. In 1676 he was instrumental in securing the dismissal from the Monmouthshire bench of a justice who was also a recusant. He was also tough on refractory clergy and diocesan officials, at one point imposing a sentence of greater excommunication on the principal registrar of the consistory court. By this date Lloyd had married his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1708), for matriculation records at Cambridge in 1691 suggest that their son John was born in this period.<br>
<br>Lloyd was translated to the bishopric of Peterborough, being elected on 10 April 1679, and enthroned on 12 July. He was resident for at least part of the year at Acton, Middlesex, for two of his children were baptized there, a son, Edward, on 20 April 1680, and a daughter, Hannah, on 25 July 1682. In the House of Lords, Lloyd was a supporter of the court, voting on 23 November 1680 against moves for a joint committee with the Commons to debate the safety of the kingdom. Moreover Lloyd proved to be an energetic diocesan: in the four years 1679&#150;83 he confirmed 7864 people and ordained 47 priests and deacons. He also suppressed conventicles with the aid of the local JPs, and threatened to present those not receiving the sacrament, thereby boosting the number of communicants.<br>
<br>Lloyd was translated to Norwich, being elected on 11 June 1685, and enthroned (by proxy) on 23 July 1685. Lloyd was loyal to James II's government, attempting to persuade those dismissed from the commission of the peace to co-operate with the regime early in 1688. Nevertheless his firm commitment to the Church of England was such that only absence from London prevented Lloyd joining the seven bishops in their petition to James II to withdraw the declaration of indulgence. Upon his arrival in London he signed the petition and helped to organize their legal defence, even paying &pound;5 towards their legal costs.<br>
<br>Lloyd was one of the peers who petitioned James II in mid-November 1688 to allow parliament to meet. He opposed the revolution of 1688, voting in the Convention Parliament on 29 January 1689 for a regency. In February he brought the problems of loyalists into sharp relief with his acknowledgement that he was willing to pray for the royal family in general, but could not do so if he had to name King William and Queen Mary. Consequently he refused the oaths to the new monarchs, stopped attending the house of Lords, and in August 1689 was suspended from his diocese. As the date for the deprivation of those bishops who would not take the oaths drew nearer he remained close to Sancroft, no doubt endorsing the archbishop's refusal to make a move towards the government. He was deprived on 1 February 1690, although no successor was appointed for over a year. Lloyd was clearly popular with his clergy, even those taking the oaths, for in Norwich diocese they petitioned for the removal of penalties from the nonjuring bishops [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/47712', "Nonjuring bishops")</script>]. Following the naval defeat at Beachy Head in June 1690, and consequent fears of invasion, on 4 August a mob attacked Lloyd's house in Old Street, London, forcing him to take his family into the Temple to find refuge.<br>
<br>On 9 February 1692 Archbishop Sancroft signed a commission bestowing upon Lloyd full primatical authority. Thus, when Sancroft died in November 1693 Lloyd was his acknowledged successor. This proved to be important when there were disagreements over whether the nonjurors should perpetuate the split with the official church of England by consecrating their own bishops. Lloyd took part in the consecration of two new bishops (George Hickes and Thomas Wagstaffe) on 24 February 1694. In July 1695 he signed a letter supporting John Kettlewell's scheme for the relief of the suffering nonjuring clergy. In 1700 he opposed Bishop Thomas Ken's initiative to Archbishop Thomas Tenison to end the split in the church, writing that he was in favour of peace, &#145;but without quitting my principles for I'm persuaded that the principles for which I suffer are just and true, being founded upon the authority of the scriptures and the practice of the church&#146;  (Yould, 370). In 1703, when Bishop Ken decided to resign his diocese of Bath and Wells to George Hooper, who had been appointed to the see following the death of Richard Kidder, Lloyd chastised Ken for acting on his own, and angry letters were exchanged between the two men.<br>
<br>Lloyd remained intransigent in his opposition to a reunification of the church once the deprived bishops had died or, in Ken's case, resigned their sees. Lloyd's wife was buried at Hammersmith on 19 June 1708. Lloyd died on 1 January 1710 after a fall and was buried at Hammersmith four days later. As the last of the deprived bishops, apart from Ken, his death allowed some prominent nonjurors, such as Henry Dodwell, Robert Nelson, and Francis Brokesby, to rejoin the national church. Lloyd's daughter, Hannah, survived him and was the recipient of some insurance money.<br>
