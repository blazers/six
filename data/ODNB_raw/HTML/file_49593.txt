<span class="headword">Brown, Sir  Raymond Frederick</span>  (1920&#150;1991), <span class="occ">industrialist</span>, was born on 19 July 1920 at 4 Nettleton Road, Greenwich, London, the son of Frederick Brown, then working as a dock labourer but later a small shopkeeper, and his wife, Susie Evelyn, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hutchins. After leaving Morden Terrace London county council school at the age of fourteen he joined Broadcast and Relay Services (later Rediffusion) as an engineering apprentice, continuing his education at evening classes at South East London Technical College and Morley College. He spent the war years on secondment from Rediffusion installing radio navigation beacons for the RAF, and after the war he helped to install mobile transmitters in Germany to enable the British army of the Rhine to receive broadcasts from the British Forces Broadcasting Service. He married Eva Constance Hugh (<i>b</i>. 1921/2), daughter of Henry Hugh Jennings, engineer gauge maker, on 13 September 1942; they had one daughter but were divorced in 1949. On 19 June 1953 he married Carol Jacqueline Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1931/2), daughter of Henry Robert James Spinks, company director. They had two sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Brown worked as sales manager in the communications division of Plessey Ltd from 1949 to 1950 when he left to found Racal Ltd jointly with Wing Commander (George) Calder (Jock) Cunningham: the name Racal&#151;pronounced &#145;Ray-call&#146;&#151;came from a combination of RAY-mond and CAL-der. Based in north London, it began as a consultancy for the planning of radio communications systems but in 1951 they formed Racal Electronics Ltd as a private company, to manufacture radio equipment for the major communications companies. The company moved from its original small factory in Isleworth to larger premises built to its requirements in Bracknell New Town, Berkshire, in 1954, and continued to expand in the field of radio communications, concentrating on high frequency equipment. Racal was the first British company to sell proprietary radio communications equipment, rather than entering into contracts with customers to supply to their individual specifications. Among its most successful products in the early years were the RA 17 high frequency radio receiver, first manufactured in 1957, and the Harness B intercommunication units for tanks and military vehicles. Cunningham died in 1958 but the company continued to grow, with the volume of business quadrupling between 1957 and 1962. In 1961, when it was floated as a public company with Brown as chairman and managing director, Racal had a workforce of 825, with 50 per cent of its sales to British government departments, while international customers included NATO, SHAPE, and governments throughout the world. When Brown left the company in 1966, 62 per cent of its orders were for exports. Since 1956 he had spent some six months in every year selling Racal products abroad, negotiating licensing agreements for the overseas manufacture of equipment designed by Racal, and acquiring licences for it to make equipment developed elsewhere. Several overseas subsidiary companies were formed, starting with Racal (Australia) Pty Ltd in 1961. An installation section of the company was developed, which undertook major projects abroad.<br>
<br>Brown was appointed head of the new department of defence sales at the Ministry of Defence in 1966 and spent three years there working to increase Britain's share of the world market in defence equipment. He was knighted in 1969 and appointed adviser on commercial policy and exports to the Department of Health and Social Security, where he remained until 1972. He subsequently served as an adviser to the National Economic Development Office. He joined Muirhead, another leading electronics company, as chief executive and managing director in 1970, holding these positions until 1982, when he was elected chairman. He was one of the first to realize the possibilities of the facsimile machine, and was responsible for its development at Muirhead. When he left in 1985 he became an executive director of STC (formerly Standard Telephones and Cables Ltd). He retired in 1990.<br>
<br>A horse lover and keen polo player, Brown not only kept horses and a string of polo ponies, but was also chairman of Racecourse Technical Services from 1970 to 1984. At his country estate in Witley, near Godalming, Surrey, he had a prize-winning herd of Hereford cattle, and he enjoyed golf and shooting. He had a warm and exuberant personality, and was enthusiastic about anything that he did. He held no strong political views, and was happy to serve under any political party: it was coincidental that most of his government work was done while the Labour government was in power. He devoted much time to charitable causes, including the Ronald Raven Chair of Clinical Oncology Trust, and muscular dystrophy. He died of cancer at his home, Witley Park House, Surrey, on 3 September 1991 and was buried in the churchyard at Witley on 11 September. He was survived by his second wife and their three children, his daughter by his first marriage having predeceased him. A memorial service was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 2 November 1991.<br>
