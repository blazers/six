<span class="headword">Bosan,  Bartholomew</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1400), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was a native of Lucca in Italy who had established a business in London by the early 1370s. He makes numerous appearances in the city records during the following three decades, mostly as a mainpernor, guarantor, and litigant, and often alongside fellow Italians. Accused at different times of involvement in both usury and forgery, on one occasion he was imprisoned as the result of an action by his fellow Lucchese Francis Vincheguerre. It was with another Lucchese, Thomas Serland, that in 1371 he traded to Bruges, a common centre for commercial activity by Italian merchants living in London at this time. The pattern thus established would appear to have continued, for customs accounts from twenty years later show Bosan frequently receiving consignments from ships captained by north European masters, and the mixture of Italian goods and local European manufactures carried by these ships suggests strongly that they had in their turn come from Bruges. He imported a wide variety of items, mostly Flemish and Brabant linen thread together with the luxury fabrics for which his native city was well known&#151;rakemas, satins, silk baldachins, Cyprus gold brocades, velvets, taffetas, kerchiefs, and sarsenet&#151;as well as raw silks and small amounts of drugs and spices such as wormseed, rhubarb, and pepper. At his death he owed the wardens of the Mercers' Company &pound;10, perhaps in unpaid quarterage, and was subsequently described as having been a citizen and mercer of London.<br>
<br>Bosan's imports, while finding a natural outlet in sales to London mercers, would have guaranteed him an entr&eacute;e to aristocratic and clerical households in London. Lucchese fabrics were very popular at Edward III's court, where they were used for royal wedding garments and as gifts to retiring ambassadors, as well as at funerals and obits and for donations to religious houses. Bosan may well have been the Bett Lumbard who supplied eleven lengths of cloth of gold each costing &pound;6 and four lengths of silk worth &pound;2 each that were presented to Waleran de Luxembourg, count of St Pol, and his company when they left England in 1389, having come to swear to the truce between England and France. He sold Cyprus gold baldachins, coloured baldachins, different coloured silk velvets, and satins to the future Henry IV's wardrobe in London during 1391/2; he supplied Henry again in 1397/8, this time with rakemas and silk baldachins. His exports consisted largely of worsted and undyed cloth, tin and tin wares, and old wines. He appears as a debtor to the value of &pound;5 18<i>s</i>. in the account book of Gilbert Maghfeld (<i>d</i>. 1397), perhaps in connection with a payment owing for customs, as the book contains rough jottings for particulars of customs accounts, and Maghfeld was collector for petty custom and tunnage and poundage in London in 1390.<br>
<br>Bosan was granted letters of denization in 1391 for &pound;50, on condition that he neither belonged to any company of alien merchants nor took advantage of his new nationality by lending his name to cover the passage of alien merchandise through customs. By 1400, when he surrendered letters patent which had granted him the proceeds from property which had belonged to John Export in the parish of St Mary Aldermary, he held the position of king's esquire. In the same year he was named in a grant to Elizabeth, dowager duchess of Norfolk, of the goods and debts due to the king from her late husband, Thomas (I) Mowbray. Although it was said in 1403 that he had fallen sick and made a will at Newark, while accompanying the king on his return from Scotland in 1400, the only surviving record associated with Bosan's death is an enrolment of letters of administration, by which his goods were committed to Peter Burton and William Sowthous in September 1400. However, an action for &pound;200 brought by the mercer Thomas Aleyn in 1403, against Bosan's widow, Joan, and the two administrators, named Joan as his executor along with John Duffeld, John Corne, John Bilte, and John Taillour. Joan had strong English connections. In 1428 the mercer John Shadworth bequeathed property in the parish of St Bartholomew-the-Less to the order of Minoresses outside Aldgate, on condition that they should offer prayers for his own soul and for the souls of Bosan, his wife, Joan, and their daughter Philippa, and in addition the Minoresses were particularly instructed to observe Joan's obit. It is possible that Joan was a blood relative of Shadworth, or perhaps she married him after Bosan's death, bringing their daughter Philippa into Shadworth's household.<br>
