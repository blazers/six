<span class="headword">Rattenbury <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Wolfe]</span>,  Alma Victoria</span>  (1897/8&#150;1935), <span class="occ">accused murderer</span>, was born probably in Prince Rupert, British Columbia, Canada, the daughter of a goldmining prospector named Wolfe (who subsequently disappeared) and his wife, Elizabeth, reputedly a relative of W. G. Grace. After her mother's remarriage Alma took her stepfather's surname of Clarke. She was educated in Kamloops and Toronto. From an early age she showed musical talent and reputedly was a soloist with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra at the age of seventeen. Later she composed sentimental ballads under the name of Lozanne.<br>
<br>In 1914 Alma married Calendon Robert Radclyffe Dolling (1890?&#150;1916), nephew of the earl of Caledon, an Anglo-Irishman. On the outbreak of the First World World he enlisted in the Royal Welch Fusiliers and she worked in the War Office. After his death in action she joined the Scottish Women's Hospital attached to the French Red Cross as a stretcher-bearer, during which time she was twice wounded and awarded the Croix de Guerre with star and palm. In peacetime she met Captain Thomas Compton Pakenham (1893&#150;1957), a kinsman of the earl of Longford. In 1920 Alma was cited as a co-respondent in Pakenham's divorce and she married him in 1921. After separating from Pakenham and returning to Canada, Alma earned her living by giving music lessons and writing sentimental songs.<br>
<br>In Canada, Alma met Francis Mawson Rattenbury (1867&#150;1935), who had established a successful architectural practice in Victoria and whose marriage was moribund. In 1925 Alma divorced Pakenham and was cited as co-respondent in Rattenbury's divorce. They married later that year, but the scandal of the divorce forced them to leave Victoria. A child, John, was born in 1928 and shortly afterwards they settled in Bournemouth at the Villa Madeira, 5 Manor Road. The marriage was happy but celibate after the birth of John. Alma, whose songs were sung by Richard Tauber and Frank Titterton as well as being broadcast by celebrated bandleaders such as Ambrose, was in 1932 diagnosed with tuberculosis. Her moods became volatile, and her habits more intemperate.<br>
<br>In 1934 Rattenbury engaged as a chauffeur and handyman George Percy Stoner (<i>b</i>. 1916). Stoner and Alma soon became lovers, with Rattenbury acting as a <i>mari complaisant</i>. After his seduction, Stoner changed from being an unassuming youth to a self-asserting character. On 24 March 1935 the Rattenburys mooted a visit to Bridport. Stoner, when he heard of this proposal, became agitated lest conjugal relations be resumed. At 1.30 a.m. on 25 March the police were summoned to Villa Madeira; Rattenbury had been taken to Strathallen Nursing Home with head injuries, and foul play was suspected. They found Alma highly excited, incoherent, and intoxicated. She repeatedly declared that she had attacked her husband with a mallet.<br>
<br>Alma found herself in prison with no clear recollection of what had happened. She did not remember signing or reaffirming her confession but refused to reject it. In her infatuation with Stoner she assumed responsibility for what had happened. After Rattenbury's death on 28 March Stoner was arrested and admitted hitting Rattenbury with his mallet. On 29 March he and Alma were charged in the Bournemouth police court. The director of public prosecutions decided to proceed with the case against both the accused, each being a self-confessed murderer. He did not charge them with conspiracy, as there was no evidence of collusion. Each was to be charged individually with murder but in the same indictment, so that they were tried together. Alma was cajoled by Daphne Kingham, Pakenham's sister, into withdrawing her confession because it would haunt her two sons for all their lives. Mrs Kingham threatened that if Alma would not protect her children, she must not expect anyone to care for them if she was convicted. A few days before the trial Mrs Kingham brought Christopher Pakenham to see his mother and this broke Alma's resistance.<br>
<br>The joint trial, which opened on 27 May at the central criminal court before Sir Travers Humphreys, was the criminal sensation of the year. Alma was offered up to &pound;3500 for her story, then a considerable sum, which she refused. Following a clear direction from the judge, the jury were out for less than an hour before acquitting Alma but convicting Stoner (31 May). Mrs Kingham took Alma away but the press besieged the flat. Her doctor took her to a nursing home pursued by journalists. Alma was physically and mentally ill. Her grief, misery, and shame for her children and Stoner were indescribable. On 4 June she bought a kitchen knife, took a train to Bournemouth, and on the Avon riverbank near Christchurch she drove the knife into her breast six times, three times penetrating her heart. She left scraps of paper, none containing a confession, the last of which said &#145;If I only thought it would help Stoner I would stay but it has been pointed out too vividly that I cannot help him&#151;and that is my death sentence&#146;  (Napley, 211). When Stoner learned of her death, he wept.<br>
<br>Alma Rattenbury was buried on 8 June 1935 at St Peter's Church, Bournemouth. The conduct at her funeral was disgraceful: flowers were taken from her grave as souvenirs. At first flowers were also taken from the garden of Villa Madeira but others subsequently forced an entry and stole various objects, including children's toys, letters, and photographs. After hearing of Alma's death, Stoner made a statement to the effect that he was not guilty. His appeal was turned down but a petition was launched and Stoner was reprieved. He served seven years before being released to serve in the army during the Second World War. Several television dramas have since been based on the story and Terence Rattigan's <span class="italic">Cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</span> (1977) was based on the Stoner&#150;Rattenbury murder trial.<br>
