<span class="headword">Sperling,  John</span>  (1793&#150;1877), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Tottenham, Middlesex, on 4 November 1793, the son of Henry Piper Sperling of Park Place, Henley-on-Thames, and afterwards of Norbury Park, Surrey, and his wife, Sarah Ann (<i>d</i>. 28 May 1850), daughter of Henry Grace of Tottenham. Sperling attended the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and spent some time in the Ordnance Survey before being commissioned second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 14 December 1811. He joined at Chatham in March 1812 and was promoted lieutenant on 1 July 1812.<br>
<br>At the end of 1813, when the Dutch rebelled against French occupation, a British expeditionary force under Sir Thomas Graham was sent to their aid. Sperling was one of the engineer officers under Lieutenant-Colonel Carmichael Smyth who accompanied the expedition, which landed at Williamstadt on 18 December 1813. Sperling distinguished himself in the ensuing operations, and most particularly, in the unsuccessful attempt to storm Bergen-op-Zoom with four columns on 8 March 1814. Headed by Sperling the first column effected an entrance by surprise at the Watergate and seized the guard, the French officer surrendering his sword to Sperling, who kept it as a trophy. The party then swept the ramparts for some way, but not being supported by the main body of their own, and encountering a large force of the enemy, it was obliged to fall back after the death of its two commanders, Carleton and Gore. In the course of this operation it came across the second column, and together they made a stand for the night. At dawn next day it should have been possible to take Bergen-op-Zoom, but instead of support came the order to retire. Sperling was specially commended by the master-general of the Board of Ordnance for his &#145;gallantry and ability&#146; shown while attached to the advanced party of stormers.<br>
<br>On 23 March 1814 Sperling was appointed adjutant and quartermaster of the Royal Sappers and Miners and joined the headquarters staff. On 11 April 1814 the news arrived of the entry of the allies into Paris and of the change of government, which ended hostilities. During May Sperling was employed in taking possession of the fortresses assigned for British occupation, and in June he was sent to London to report on the border fortifications to the Board of Ordnance. In August he made a survey and plan of Li&egrave;ge citadel for Lord Lynedoch, who was about to hand over command to the prince of Orange.<br>
<br>Sperling's duties were greatly increased after news was received of Napoleon's escape from Elba. He inspected many defence works and Wellington, who inspected the border fortresses, was well satisfied with Sperling's preparations. After accompanying Colonel Carmichael Smyth on an inspection of the fortifications Sperling made a sketch of a defensive position at Hal against a French advance; it was laid before Wellington on 17 May and received his approval.<br>
<br>Napoleon crossed the frontier into the Southern Netherlands on 15 June 1815. Sperling joined Carmichael Smyth on 17 June as the British fell back from Quatre Bras. They remained close to Wellington during the early part of the battle of Waterloo, but later became separated from him, although they remained on the battlefield throughout. From time to time they were forced to take refuge in one of the infantry squares. They returned to Brussels after the battle, moving with the headquarters to Le Cateau on 24 June, and later towards Paris. Sperling reconnoitred the Seine on 2 July to find a suitable bridging site and recommended one at Argenteuil, which was later selected. He entered Paris with the headquarters staff on 7 July and remained there until 27 January 1816, when Wellington moved his headquarters to Cambrai.<br>
<br>Sperling returned home in November 1818. He retired on permanent half pay on 24 January 1824, and resided at Great Doods, near Reigate, Surrey. Later he lived in a house which he built for himself at 16 Kensington Palace Gardens, London, where he died on 14 February 1877. On 12 March 1819 he married Harriet Hanson; they had one son, John (1825&#150;1894).<br>
