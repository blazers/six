</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Psalmanazar,  George</span>  (1679&#150;1763), <span class="occ">impostor and author</span>, was born in southern France under a name that is now unknown and to parents whose names, like that of his place of birth, he does not mention in his <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> (published posthumously in 1764), the only source of information about his early life. For an important and lengthy period of his life he claimed to be a native of Formosa (Taiwan), but his confessional <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> make it clear that he was born of Roman Catholic parents in southern France. This is affirmed in the advertisement to the first edition of the <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> in the testimony of an acquaintance of twenty years: &#145;He was a Frenchman. His pronunciation had a spice of the Gascoin accent, and in that provincial dialect, he was so masterly, that none but those born in the country could equal, none though born there could excel him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, i&#150;ii). The little Psalmanazar says about his background in the <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> indicates that his was a family of slender means, and that his &#145;father was of an ancient, but decayed family, and had been obliged to leave my mother before I was five years old, and to live near five hundred miles from her&#146; in Germany  (ibid., 71). Psalmanazar left his mother's house to visit his father at the age of sixteen, but the visit was brief, and there is no indication that he ever saw either of his parents in later life.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>By his own account, Psalmanazar's &#145;more than common readiness at learning&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 73) in childhood gained him admiration and special treatment from teachers. At six he went to a &#145;free-school taught by two Franciscan monks&#146;  (ibid.), where he immediately started Latin. He then attended a Jesuit college, where he proceeded through the forms to &#145;Humanity&#146;, rhetoric, and philosophy. In the <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> Psalmanazar makes much of his precocity, especially in learning languages, and of the over-indulgent treatment he received from his teachers. After the Jesuit college, he went on to study philosophy and theology in a Dominican university in a nearby town, &#145;too young quite, in all appearance, to herd among the rest of the students, some of whom were twice my age, and none by many years so young as I&#146;  (ibid., 98). Finally, disenchanted with the Dominican teachers' Thomism and with his studies in general, he left his university and went to nearby Avignon as a tutor. By this time, aged about sixteen, he was fluent in Latin and knew a good deal of philosophy and theology. Because of one teacher's special interest, he was also knowledgeable about military fortification, but otherwise his education was not very broad.<br>
<br>In his first professional appointment, Psalmanazar was undone by his attractiveness to his superiors. The mother of his tutees, he says, made sexual overtures to him, and when he did not respond he was dismissed. In poverty in Avignon, he explained his ragged appearance and soothed his pride by pretending he was &#145;a sufferer for religion for too great attachment to the church&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 113). Finally out of funds, he resolved to return home, and as a &#145;means of facilitating [his] long journey&#146; he obtained a certificate signifying that he was a &#145;student in theology, of Irish extract&#146;, a religious exile on a pilgrimage to Rome  (ibid., 117). He stole a cloak and staff for the purpose and set off first to his mother and then to his estranged father.<h2>
<a name="BecomingFormosan"></a>Becoming Formosan</h2>Finding his father's circumstances very uninviting and the neighbouring towns and universities inaccessible, Psalmanazar decided to return home but was persuaded by his father to tour northern Germany and the Netherlands first. In order to gain alms on this journey, Psalmanazar decided to make his identity more exotic, and posed as a Japanese convert to Christianity. To facilitate the project, he revised the certificate that he had had drawn up to prove that he was Irish, and devised an alphabet and many words of a language that he thought might be taken for Japanese. Aware that Hebrew was written from right to left, he imagined that other &#145;oriental&#146; languages would follow that pattern. He invented twenty letters with shapes, names, and pronunciations that resemble some Greek and Hebrew letters. By his own account, he also added &#145;many other particulars equally difficult, such as a considerable piece of a new language and grammar, a new division of the year into twenty months, a new religion, &amp;c. and all out of my own head&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 137).<br>
<br>Destitute and scabrous after travelling, Psalmanazar enlisted in a military regiment camped near Bonn. Taking to swearing and profligacy, he pretended then to be an &#145;unconverted or heathenish&#146; Japanese  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 162). He soon joined another regiment (under the duke of Mecklenburg) in Cologne, and this time used the name of Salmanazar  (ibid., 169), which he took from the name of a biblical king of Assyria and captor of the Israelites, Shalmaneser (<span class="roman">2 Kings</span> 17). Later he began spelling the name with an initial P to make it more exotic, and he began claiming he was from the island of Formosa, a place he described as politically and culturally dependent upon Japan.<br>
<br>Changing regiments once again, Psalmanazar enlisted at Sluys, Holland, and there met the British chaplain Alexander Innes, who saw in him an opportunity for his own advancement. First, Innes revealed the fraud. &#145;His stratagem&#146;, wrote Psalmanazar:<blockquote>was to make me translate a passage of Cicero de natura deorum, of some length, into my (pretended) Formosan language, and give it to him in writing; and this I easily did &hellip; But, after he had made me construe it, and desired me to write another version of it on another paper, his proposal, and the manner of his exacting it, threw me into such visible confusion, having had so little time to excogitate the first, and less to commit it to memory, that there were not above one half of the words in the second that were in the first. (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 184&#150;5)</blockquote>To his great shame in later life, Psalmanazar then allowed Innes to baptize him in the Church of England with the name of George Lauder, the governor of the regiment. For this deed Innes received commendation from the bishop of London, Henry Compton, and Psalmanazar received an invitation to come to England with the hope that he would teach Formosan at Oxford to Christian missionaries  (ibid., 192).<br>
<br>Psalmanazar earned fame in England within a year of his arrival when he published <span class="italic">An Historical and Geographical Description of Formosa</span> (1704). He dedicated the work to Henry Compton, to whom he had earlier given drafts of &#145;Formosan&#146; material: a translation of the Lord's prayer, a table of the alphabet, and drawings of the dress of the Formosans. The history, which Psalmanazar wrote in Latin over several months, was concurrently translated into English. (Judging from the French translation of 1705, R. M. Swiderski suggests that Psalmanazar may have written originally in French.) The fulsome dedication to Compton, the description of his conversion, and his high praise of the Church of England as a &#145;true Apostolical Church&#146; helped Psalmanazar earn a loyal following. However, his fanciful account of Formosa, which occupies little more than half of the book's 327 pages, raised doubts about his veracity in several quarters at the same time as it excited many readers. Among his entertaining but suspicious claims were that Formosa was Japanese rather than Chinese; that the state religion, founded by an avatar named Psalmanaazaar, required the annual sacrifice of 18,000 boys under the age of nine; and that the production of children was facilitated by the encouragement of polygamy, although adultery was absolutely forbidden.<br>
<br>Although Psalmanazar took a few descriptions out of Bernhardus Varenius's <span class="italic">Descriptio regni Japoniae et Siam</span> (1649), his work is mostly pure fiction. In his <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> he claimed to have borrowed more than he had done from Varenius and also from the fabulous account of Formosa by George Candidius in his <span class="italic">Collection of Voyages and Travels</span> (1704). Despite the paper-thinness of its research, Psalmanazar's book was an instant success, and Henry Compton sent him to Christ Church, Oxford, where he remained in residence for three months. There he wrote an expanded and more daring second edition, which included sensational new claims about cannibalism and the subordination of Formosan women. In fact the two topics are sometimes conflated, as when Psalmanazar describes men devouring sinful women or discarded wives. It appears from some of the letters from Richard Gwinnet to Elizabeth Thomas (1731) that Psalmanazar claimed to have eaten human flesh himself  (Foley, appendix C).<br>
<br>At Oxford Psalmanazar was fortunate to have as his tutor the sympathetic (or gullible) Samuel Reynolds (father of the painter Joshua Reynolds and principal addressee in Psalmanazar's extant correspondence). The admiration of Reynolds notwithstanding, much of the learned community knew of Psalmanazar's fraud even before his book was published, as evidenced in the correspondence of John Locke, Anthony Collins, and Thomas Hearne, as well as in Samuel Parker's journal <span class="italic">History of the Works of the Learned</span>. On 2 February 1704 Psalmanazar was invited to attend a meeting of the Royal Society along with Father Jean de Fontenay, a French Jesuit who had spent time in China. According to Psalmanazar's account in his <span class="italic">Description</span>, he defeated Fontenay's arguments that Formosa was Chinese rather than Japanese. Psalmanazar did not mention until the second edition (1705) the probing enquiry by Edmond Halley about the duration of twilight in Formosa, which revealed the fraud, according to a note on the flyleaf of a second edition of the <span class="italic">Description</span> in the British Library  (Foley, 19). Further notes in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Society</span> show that fellows were convinced of the fraud by 13 June 1705, when they received letters concerning Formosa from a traveller there  (ibid., 20). But the society made no pronouncement against Psalmanazar, and to the extent that its opposition was known it helped Psalmanazar to portray himself as a defender of revealed religion hounded by the rationalistic freethinkers of the Royal Society. In a lengthy review of his <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> confirmed that he profited from the Royal Society's opposition  (p. 447).<br>
<br>Psalmanazar received 10 guineas for the first and 12 guineas for the second edition of the <span class="italic">Description</span>, &#145;besides such presents as were made me by the generous few to whom I presented them&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 220&#150;21). With the support of these &#145;few&#146;, in 1706 and again in 1707 Psalmanazar published defences of himself that emphasize his allegiance to revealed religion. About 1710 he made a final attempt to defend himself in print with the publication of two more pamphlets. Nevertheless, credulity was growing thin. By 16 March 1711 Psalmanazar's fraud was well enough known for <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> to make a joke at his expense by printing a false advertisement, claiming that<blockquote>
<i>On the first of April will be performed at the playhouse in the</i> Hay-market <i>an Opera call'd</i> The Cruelty of Atreus. N. B. <i>The scene wherein</i> Thyestes <i>eats his own children, is to be performed by the famous</i> <i>Mr. Psalmanazar</i><i>, lately arrived from</i> Formosa: <i>The whole Supper being set to Kettle-drums</i>. (<span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, ed. D. Bond, 5 vols., 1965, 1.65)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Finaldeceptionandlatercareer"></a>Final deception and later career</h2>After five or six years in England, Psalmanazar made his last public attempt to capitalize on his feigned origins: he conspired with a man named Pattenden to promote a kind of lacquer called white Formosan work. The project failed, and until 1715 Psalmanazar lived on the small income he earned as a tutor. In that year he became clerk to a regiment of dragoons fighting against the Jacobites, and after the defeat of the rising he stayed for a time in Lancashire, where he advised the newly established Manchester College Library on the expenditure of its gift funds for books.<br>
<br>Back in London about 1717, Psalmanazar began painting ladies' fans for a living, until friends took up a subscription for him to study divinity. Feeling guilty about this generosity, however, he earned an income as a translator.<blockquote>It was then I began to perceive, with no small joy, how God blessed my endeavours in proportion to my diligence and honesty &hellip; From translating of other people's works, I came at length to print some of my own, and &hellip; bless the Divine mercy, for the wonderful and undeserved success I have since met with. (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 249)</blockquote>For the rest of his life Psalmanazar was a pious and productive member of Grub Street. The principal works to which he made significant contributions are Samuel Palmer's <span class="italic">The General History of Printing</span> (1732), which he took over after the death of the first author; Emanuel Bowen's <span class="italic">A Complete System of Geography</span> (2 vols., 1744), to which he contributed articles on thirty countries including a confessional piece on Formosa; and <span class="italic">An Universal History from the Earliest Account of Time</span> (8 vols., 1736&#150;50). To this last, immense folio work and its twenty-volume octavo second edition (1747&#150;54) Psalmanazar contributed articles on at least twelve vast subjects, including a history of the Jews to the present, as well as on ancient Greece, the ancient Spaniards, the Gauls, and the Germans. The quality of Psalmanazar's known work is less impressive than the indomitable energy and considerable linguistic skill he displayed to complete it.<h2>
<a name="Confession"></a>Confession</h2>Soon after becoming a writer, Psalmanazar resolved to overcome his vanity and confess his impostures. Several books of practical divinity were important to his salvation, he said, but the decisive experience was his reading of William Law's <span class="italic">A Serious Call to a Devout and Holy Life</span> (1728), which was also read at this time, and with similar effect, by the future lexicographer Samuel Johnson. Later Johnson identified Psalmanazar's devotion as one of the reasons why he &#145;sought after&#146; him &#145;the most&#146; of any of his London acquaintance  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 3.314). According to Sir John Hawkins, Johnson:<blockquote>was very well acquainted with Psalmanaazar, the pretended Formosan, and said, he had never seen the close of the life of any one that he wished so much his own to resemble, as that of him, for its purity and devotion &hellip; asked whether he ever contradicted Psalmanaazar;&#151;&#145;I should as soon&#146;, said he, &#145;have thought of contradicting a bishop&#146;; so high did he hold his character in the latter part of his life. When he was asked whether he had ever mentioned Formosa before him, he said, he was afraid to mention even China. (<span class="italic">Johnsonian Miscellanies</span>, ed. G. B. Hill, 2 vols., 1897, reprinted 1970, 2.12&#150;13)</blockquote>In 1753 Psalmanazar published anonymously his <span class="italic">Essays on the Following Subjects</span>, which purport to offer a defence of revealed religion from the attacks of Viscount Bolingbroke, Anthony Collins, and especially David Hume, whose essay on miracles had recently been published. For the most part, Psalmanazar relies here on the old argument of Lactantius and others that human ignorance disqualifies man from passing judgement on the miracles of revelation. However, his engagement with the details of his opponents' thinking is minimal.<br>
<br>In 1752 Psalmanazar wrote to Thomas Birch of his failing health. In the same year he also made his will and named his executor and residuary legatee as Sarah Rewalling, &#145;my pious and worthy friend &hellip; of this parish of St. Luke, in Middlesex&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 3&#150;4). She is named as the publisher of the <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, but nothing further is known of her or of their relationship. In the preface to his <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> Psalmanazar provided &#145;some account of that vast quantity of laudanum I have been known to take for above these forty years&#146; to which he attributed his good health  (ibid., 57). Although &#145;quite sound in mind&#146;, Psalmanazar described himself as &#145;weak in my body&#146; when he ratified his will on 1 January 1762  (ibid., 9). He died on 3 May 1763 at Ironmonger Row, St Luke's parish, London. Then, according to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, aged eighty-four, Psalmanazar was &#145;known for many ingenious performances in different parts of literature&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 33.257). His will was printed in several magazines, and also in his <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>. Perhaps most striking in this document are his directions for a humble burial &#145;without any kind of coffin &hellip; but only a shell of lowest value, and without lid or other covering which may hinder the natural earth from covering it all around&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 4).<br>
<br>The obvious cultural milieu in which to place Psalmanazar is the impostors and forgers of the eighteenth century, including William Lauder, Thomas Chatterton, James MacPherson, and Richard Savage. In these and many other cases of forgery and assumed identity in the period, the impostor imagined he had access to hidden information and that he himself was in touch with a deeper or older, often more &#145;natural&#146;, tradition of knowledge than that accepted by the current establishment. The flourishing of such forgers at this time may have been a response to the increased professionalization of knowledge during the period. Psalmanazar's quarrel with the Royal Society, his defence of revelation in religion, and his immersion in ancient Hebrew may be all regarded as a rebellion against modern forms of knowledge. Psalmanazar's work, despite its fabrication, also has a place in the history of ethnography. Unlike his fellow impostors, Psalmanazar outlived his impersonation by several decades and became an admired penitent and an industrious, if not brilliant, contributor to the productions of Grub Street.<br>
