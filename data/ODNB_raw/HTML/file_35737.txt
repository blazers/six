<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Richardson, Sir  Albert Edward</span>  (1880&#150;1964), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 19 May 1880 at 33D Middleton Road, Hackney, London, the eldest of the three children of Albert Edmund Richardson, printer, and his wife, Mary Ann, daughter of Thomas Richardson (not related), of Highgate. He was educated at the Boys British School, Highgate, where he already showed pleasure in buildings and a talent for drawing. In 1895 he was articled to an architect named Thomas Page, in Gray's Inn Road, and he subsequently served in the offices of Evelyn Hellicar (1898&#150;1902), Leonard Stokes (1902&#150;3), and Frank T. Verity (1903&#150;6). On 31 May 1904 he married Elizabeth (1882/3&#150;1958), daughter of John Byers, a warehouseman from Newry, co. Down; they had one daughter. As Verity's leading assistant he designed &#145;mansion flats&#146; in Cleveland Row, St James's, and in Bayswater Road (both 1906), the middle section of 169&#150;201 Regent Street (1908&#150;9), and the fa&ccedil;ade of the Regent Street Polytechnic; the latter was executed after he had severed his connection with Verity and set up in practice with another of Verity's assistants, Charles Lovett Gill. The contemporary French influence seen in the work for Verity is reflected again in the early works of the partnership, notably flats in Berkeley Street (nos. 10 and 19) executed between 1910 and 1916. A developing taste for an earlier and more distinguished type of neo-classicism is shown in the New Theatre (now the Opera House), Manchester, built in association with Horace Farquharson in 1911&#150;13. The most substantial commission, however, obtained by the partnership before the First World War was Moorgate Hall, Finsbury Pavement, London (1913&#150;17), a thoughtful solution to the problem of combining office fenestration with shop windows. This led to a series of similar commissions which formed the backbone of the practice for twenty-five years.<br>
<br>With the exigencies of practice, Richardson combined an enthusiastic devotion to the architecture of the past, especially the then neglected history of English domestic classicism from the seventeenth century to the nineteenth. With the encouragement of Harry Batsford he wrote, in collaboration with C. Lovett Gill, his first book, <span class="italic">London Houses from 1660 to 1820</span> (1911), a pioneering appreciation of the simple elegance of Georgian streets and squares. This was followed by <span class="italic">Monumental Classic Architecture in Great Britain and Ireland in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries</span> (1914), a superbly illustrated folio work demonstrating the progress of the classical tradition from the Palladian movement to the mid-Victorian period. This offered a new perspective of stylistic continuity and became a landmark in British architectural historiography.<br>
<br>Between 1916 and 1918 Richardson served as a lieutenant in the Royal Flying Corps, working at the school of military aeronautics at Reading. In 1919 his combination of practical experience and historical learning made him eligible for the chair of architecture at the Bartlett school of architecture, University College, London, where he succeeded F. M. Simpson. This chair he held for twenty-seven years, before retiring as professor emeritus in 1946. At University College he effectively exploited his personal qualities as a teacher. Not by temperament an academic, nor indeed a scholar of the more disciplined kind, his history lectures were rhetorical improvisations made wonderfully vivid by a rare talent for impromptu graphic demonstration. In the studios the same ready pencil, accompanied by an enthusiastic flow of talk and the random play of ideas, endeared him to a whole generation of students. Richardson's personal interests and distaste for modern art and architecture ensured that classical and Renaissance architecture was studied at the Bartlett School virtually to the exclusion of anything else. Yet even this was tolerated by his students as an aspect of his ebullient eccentricity, as were his perpetual haste and the general waspishness which increased as he grew older.<br>
<br>Meanwhile the practice of Richardson and Gill developed remuneratively through the 1920s and 1930s with offices in the City, flats in the West End, and a few churches and country houses. In the City, 47&#150;57 Gresham Street (1924) show a departure from classical compromise towards direct statement and this became more manifest in the premises built for Sir Arthur Sanderson &amp; Sons in Wells Street (1930&#150;32), which was awarded the London architecture medal at the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1932. But although Richardson was sympathetic to the modern tendency towards simplification, he rejected contemptuously the intellectual premises of the continental Modern Movement as expounded in the teaching of Walter Gropius and the publications of Le Corbusier. <span class="italic">The Art of Architecture</span> (1938), which he wrote in collaboration with his colleague H. O. Corfiato, was an attempt to defend traditional architectural principles, but its influence was negligible and in the late 1930s Richardson found himself increasingly alienated from the younger generation of architects.<br>
<br>During the Second World War the Bartlett School was transferred to Cambridge, where Richardson spent happy years in a privileged environment which appealed to his sense of tradition. In the post-war world he emerged as a stalwart reactionary, a lively castigator of bureaucracy, and a champion of the preservationist movements then gathering strength. Elected ARA in 1936, he became a full academician in 1944 and president of the Royal Academy ten years later. In this high office he was at once recognized as an agreeably controversial public figure who could be relied upon to say something original, paradoxical, and quite possibly irresponsible, on any subject to which his attention was directed. As a member of the Royal Fine Arts Commission from 1939 to 1956 his insights were often valuable and his criticism unsparing. In 1947 he was awarded the gold medal for architecture of the Royal Institute of British Architects and in 1956 he was appointed KCVO. He was also an FSA, an honorary member of the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours, an honorary MA of Cambridge, an honorary LittD of Dublin, and an honorary fellow of St Catharine's College, Cambridge.<br>
<br>The partnership with Gill having terminated in 1939, Richardson found, in 1945, a new partner in his son-in-law, Eric Alfred Scholefield Houfe, and together they produced an admirable sequence of designs during this final phase of his career. Their works included in and around London the Chancery Lane safe deposit (1945&#150;9), the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> building, Cannon Street (1955&#150;8), the AEI building, Grosvenor Place (1958), and the chapel and library, St Mary's College, Twickenham (1961). Restoration and alteration work featured prominently during this period and included the repair of war-damaged buildings such as Merchant Taylors' Hall (1953), Trinity House, Tower Hill (with an important extension, 1956), and the churches of St Alfege, Greenwich (1959), and St James, Piccadilly (1947&#150;54). In 1950 Richardson and Houfe also undertook alterations to Woburn Abbey, Bedfordshire, and in 1954 they restored the assembly rooms in Bath. Written work of this period includes his notice of the architect Sir (Thomas) Edwin Cooper for the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>.<br>
<br>In appearance Richardson was of medium height, inclining to stoutness in middle age; his face was somewhat fleshy with dark hair brushed back, an aquiline nose, and fine grey eyes, heavy-lidded. In deportment and gesture he had something of the air of an old-fashioned actor. Richardson died on 3 February 1964 at Avenue House, Ampthill, a beautiful late eighteenth-century house which he had acquired in 1919 and where he brought together a remarkable collection of furniture and works of art, including architectural drawings. He was buried in the churchyard at Millbrook, Bedfordshire.<br>
