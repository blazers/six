<span class="headword">Webster,  Thomas</span>  (1800&#150;1886), <span class="occ">genre painter</span>, was born on 20 March 1800 in Ranelagh Street, Pimlico, London, the son of a member of George III's household. In his youth he was trained as a chorister at St George's Chapel, Windsor, and at the Chapel Royal, St James's, London, but he preferred art to music and entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1821, where he won a gold medal in 1825. In the course of a long and successful career he exhibited eighty-three works at the Royal Academy (1823&#150;79), thirty-nine at the British Institution (1824&#150;44), and eight at the Society of British Artists (1825&#150;34). He was elected an ARA in 1840 and an RA in 1846. He also contributed illustrations to the Etching Club's <span class="italic">Deserted Village</span> (1841), <span class="italic">Songs of Shakespeare</span> (1843), and <span class="italic">Etch'd Thoughts</span> (1844). His genre paintings were very popular and reached a wide general public in the form of steel-engravings.<br>
<br>Although his earliest exhibited paintings were portraits, such as <span class="italic">Mr Robinson and Family</span> (exh. RA, 1823), Webster soon received acclaim for a scene of playful children, <span class="italic">Rebels Shooting a Prisoner</span> (exh. Society of British Artists, 1827). The following year he continued the amusing narrative with <span class="italic">Rebels Defeated</span> (exh. Society of British Artists, 1828). Such pendants became an especially popular feature of his career, as seen, for example, in <span class="italic">Going into School</span> and <span class="italic">Coming out of School</span> (both exh. RA, 1836), <span class="italic">Going to the Fair</span> and <span class="italic">Returning from the Fair</span> (both exh. British Institution, 1838; Victoria and Albert Museum, London), and <span class="italic">The Frown</span> and <span class="italic">The Joke, or, &#145;The Smile&#146;</span> (both exh. RA, 1841; Guildhall Art Gallery, London). The latter were especially popular &#145;before and after&#146; scenes which depicted a row of rustic schoolboys exchanging miserable expressions for giggling demeanours in companion paintings. Webster's production was characterized by such anecdotal childhood scenes, which were skilfully composed, highly detailed, and informed with a keen observation of human nature. Popular literature was often the inspiration. Lines from Oliver Goldsmith's <span class="italic">Deserted Village</span> accompanied <span class="italic">The Frown</span> and <span class="italic">The Joke</span>; other works made reference to Charles Dickens, Charles Lamb, Shakespeare, William Shenstone, or Wordsworth. Indeed, a small painting for Dickens illustrating a school scene in his <span class="italic">Nicholas Nickleby</span>, entitled <span class="italic">The Interior Economy of Dotheboys Hall</span> (exh. 1848; Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts), earned Webster the nickname &#145;Do-the-Boys&#146; Webster. One of his most famous paintings, <span class="italic">A Village Choir</span> (exh. RA, 1847; Victoria and Albert Museum, London), was exhibited with a lengthy quotation from Washington Irving's <span class="italic">The Sketch Book</span> (1820): it depicted an array of rustic villagers of different classes, genders, and ages gathered together in a church choir, singing and playing assorted musical instruments with great gusto and earnestness. It was just this kind of reassuring image of tranquil and contented country life, unruffled by class or economic divisions, which pleased the Victorian public by ignoring the real transformations overtaking the newly industrialized and increasingly urban society. Even contemporaries recognized the fictive nature of Webster's idyllic scenes: a writer in the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> in 1855 described <span class="italic">Good Night</span> (exh. RA, 1846; City of Bristol Museum and Art Gallery) as:<blockquote>a subject representing the interior of a rural cottage, occupied by the family of an honest yeoman, one of the class &hellip; among the extinct races, a victim to the Moloch of wealth; but we cannot stop to lament his decay,&#151;besides, we should get political, and perhaps angry, which would be out of place and unseemly here. (<span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, 295)</blockquote>Webster's works were not &#145;unseemly&#146;, as Richard Muther explained:<blockquote>Webster's rustics, children, and schoolmasters are the citizens of an ideal planet &hellip; [where] all of the agricultural labourers were quite content with their lot. No one ever quarreled with his landlord, or sat in a public-house and let his family starve. (Muther, 2.88)</blockquote>Although the children were occasionally unruly, they displayed only true British pluck, the vital spirit necessary for building the British empire. As the <span class="italic">Art Union</span> declared in 1839 with regard to the boys in Webster's <span class="italic">Football</span> (exh. RA, 1839), their &#145;spirit of rivalry&#146; would later be brought to bear on &#145;more important purposes in after life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Art Union</span>, 69&#150;70).<br>
<br>William Mulready's earlier paintings of pugnacious boys had garnered similar comments and served as models for Webster's works. For years (1833&#150;56) the two artists lived near each other in London in the suburban area of Kensington and Bayswater: Webster on The Mall, Kensington Gravel Pits, and Mulready just a short distance away. This semi-rural neighbourhood provided a suitable setting for their paintings. Both looked back to Dutch and Flemish seventeenth-century examples by David Teniers, Jan Steen, and Adriaen van Ostade&#151;though their work was cleansed of what was perceived as the earlier artists' often vulgar foreign tone. Indeed, it was the sense that Webster's subjects were &#145;indigenous to the English soil&#146;  (<span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, 1855, 293) which ensured their immense popularity. His paintings were purchased by a new breed of middle-class collector (Elhanan Bicknell, John Chapman, Joseph Gillott, John Sheepshanks, Robert Vernon, and William Wells, among others) who brought a nationalistic fervour to their patronage of contemporary British art.<br>
<br>In 1857 Webster moved to the village of Cranbrook, Kent, and became the informal leader of the Cranbrook colony, a group of younger artists who shared his interest in scenes of rural life and childhood. Although he sent fewer paintings to the London exhibitions in later years (he became an honorary retired RA in 1876), their subjects and style remained virtually unchanged. His long and satisfactory life was nicely summed up in the lines attached to his late self-portrait (exh. RA, 1878): &#145;As the sweet afterglow lights up the western skies, so is my evening bright with fond memories&#146;. His first wife, Betsy, died on 27 January 1859 at the age of fifty-nine; another spouse, Ellen, survived him. Thomas Webster died on 23 September 1886 at Cranbrook; a memorial to him by the sculptor Hamo Thornycroft was erected in St Dunstan's Church in Cranbrook. The largest collection of his works is in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.<br>
