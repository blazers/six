<span class="headword">McAll,  Robert Stephens</span>  (1792&#150;1838), <span class="occ">Congregational minister</span>, the eldest son of the Revd Robert McAll and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lea, was born at Plymouth on 4 August 1792 and received his earliest education in Gloucester and Cornwall. He was sent at the age of thirteen to the Congregational academy at Axminster, then to Hordle's academy at Harwich, and finally to Hoxton Academy in 1809. Here his liveliness, independence of spirit, and &#145;over-due propensity to disputation&#146; led to his expulsion. He lived for eighteen months with Dr W. B. Collyer, and then studied medicine at Edinburgh University. His undergraduate career was outstanding and in his second year he was offered, but declined, the office of president of the Royal Medical Society. In 1814 he was appointed chaplain of the Undenominational Sunday School at Macclesfield, Cheshire, and in 1823 St George's Chapel, Sutton, Macclesfield, was built for him. He stayed there until 1827, when he accepted the pastorate of Mosley Street Independent Chapel, Manchester. McAll's preaching was of a florid, prolix nature, but gripped his hearers; sometimes his addresses lasted for nearly two hours. Contemporaries were fascinated by him: to Dr Raffles he was &#145;wonderful&#146;, to Robert Hall &#145;miraculous&#146;, and to Dr Collyer &#145;a seraphic spirit&#146;. Aberdeen conferred on him an LLD. In Manchester he was a prominent force within the powerful evangelical leadership of the town. He served on the committee of the Naval and Military Bible Society, the Manchester Female Penitentiary, and the Manchester branch of the Anti-Slavery Society. He produced a number of printed sermons and poems, as well as <span class="italic">Discourses on Special Occasions</span>, published in 1840 with a memoir by Dr Ralph Wardlaw. Another collection, with a preface by &#145;T. H.&#146;, appeared in 1843. McAll died on 27 July 1838 at Swinton and was buried in Rochdale Road cemetery, Manchester. His only daughter predeceased him; his son, Dr R. W. McAll (1821&#150;1893), promoted in 1872 the Independent Protestant Mission in Paris.<br>
