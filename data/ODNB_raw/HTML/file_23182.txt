<span class="headword">Rawle,  Samuel</span>  (1775/6&#150;1860), <span class="occ">engraver and draughtsman</span>, was the son of George Rawle; his family came from Dunster in Somerset. By the age of seventeen he was apprenticed to Thomas Bonnors, an engraver of Gloucester, and in January 1796 was working in the London branch of his business, which was run by John Bonnors. A number of his plates appeared in the <span class="italic">European Magazine</span> and <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, and in 1801 his first landscape painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy; it was followed by another in 1806. He married Mary Purkess (1776&#150;1860) on 28 April 1801 in St Pancras Old Church, and by 1815 they had had at least six children, who were listed by age in a return made to the Artists' Annuity Fund on 22 December 1836.<br>
<br>Rawle began a long association with important topographical works, producing illustrations on copper for such publications as E. W. Brayley's <span class="italic">Beauties of England</span> (1801&#150;17), J. C. Murphy's <span class="italic">Arabian Antiquities of Spain</span> (1816), and James Hakewill's <span class="italic">Picturesque Tour of Italy</span> (1818&#150;20); he also did two plates for T. D. Whittaker's <span class="italic">A History of Richmondshire</span> (1823) and others for J. P. Neale's <span class="italic">Views of the Seats of Noblemen</span> (1818&#150;24). At this time he was living at 3 Tottenham Street, Tottenham Court Road, London. His best work was the five plates on steel engraved between May 1828 and November 1829 for William Brockedon's <span class="italic">Illustrations of the Passes of the Alps</span> and three plates for William Westall's <span class="italic">Great Britain Illustrated</span> (1830). The engravings in this latter work were under the direction of Edward Finden, for whom he undertook other work such as etching and finishing plates, receiving small payments.<br>
<br>Rawle also worked for Mr Parker on plates for William Pinnock's <span class="italic">Geography</span> (<i>c</i>.1830) and engraved for some of John Britton's works. His engravings were precise and well finished, but he seems to have had difficulty in adapting to steel, and it is possible that he later worked more as an architectural draughtsman to provide an income. Credits did not always appear on his engravings, and hence his contributions tend to be overlooked and are revealed only through other evidence, such as two notebooks, together with three letters, preserved in the St Bride Printing Library in London. These also show a son, who may be G. Rawle, apprenticed to his father, doing much of the preparatory work on plates. Samuel Rawle is known to have engraved several portraits, including those of Robert Burns, Sebastian Cabot (1824), and William Shakespeare. He probably retired about 1841, and is described in his will as a gentleman, although his death certificate proclaims him a landscape engraver. He died on 1 November 1860, after a prolonged bout of bronchitis, at his home, 19 Leverton Street, Kentish Town, London. His wife predeceased him by a few days, so his meagre property went to his other executor, George Dobr&eacute;e.<br>
