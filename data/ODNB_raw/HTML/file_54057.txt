<span class="headword">Scholderer,  (Julius) Victor</span>  (1880&#150;1971), <span class="occ">bibliographer</span>, was born in Clarendon Road, Putney, London, on 9 October 1880, the only child of German &eacute;migr&eacute;s Otto Scholderer (1834&#150;1902) and his wife, Luise Steurwaldt. His father, a distinguished painter of the Frankfurt school, first left Germany for Paris, and then as a result of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 moved to London. Both parents became naturalized British citizens, but never really settled down happily to life in Britain; they returned to Germany in 1899.<br>
<br>Educated at St Paul's School and Trinity College, Oxford, Victor Scholderer entered the service of the British Museum Library in June 1904, filling the gap caused by the premature death the previous autumn of R. G. C. Proctor (1868&#150;1903). Thereafter he gave his undivided attention to the library for the next sixty-six years, and some of his best work was completed after his official retirement in 1945. Armed with a formidable knowledge of Latin and Greek literature, bilingual in English and German, and with an excellent command of French already perfected during a year's residence in Paris in his student days, he was ideally equipped to face his life's work. This was the bibliographical study of early printed books, particularly those of the fifteenth century, of which the British Museum had already the best collection in the world and the British Library now has about 10,500 editions. Scholderer quickly developed an acute eye for early typefaces, and worked for many years on the specialized catalogue of the British Museum's incunabula (known as <span class="roman">BMC</span>), which is still incomplete. From parts 2 and 3 (Germany), through parts 4&#150;7 (Italy), to the massive part 8 (France), Scholderer was responsible for more of this immensely exacting work than any other individual member of staff. He could inspire awe, even fear, in his colleagues, but was never unjust or unfair, and, as far as anyone else was aware, was hardly (if ever) guilty of an error in his work. He never wrote a full-scale book, but one of the best results of his career was a steady stream of articles, mostly short, all exquisitely written, and not without the occasional touch of wry humour. Each solved some problem, outlining in as few words as possible the career of some early printer or humanist scholar, and paving the way for further research. After his official retirement he gave more of his attention to the museum's collections of Italian and German books of the sixteenth century, and was largely responsible for the publication of the invaluable short-title catalogues of these books, Italian in 1958 and German in 1962, each of which for the first time presented the scholarly world with comprehensive indexes of the printers and booksellers.<br>
<br>In 1927 Scholderer designed a Greek type (New Hellenic), of which he was very proud. The first book printed with it was the <span class="italic">Prometheus Bound</span> of Aeschylus, prepared by Scholderer himself in 1930, and the type was used by <span class="italic">The Times</span>. In the same year, 1930, Scholderer gave the Sandars lectures in bibliography at Cambridge. Entitled &#145;The invention of printing: facts and theories&#146;, they remained unpublished, but he returned to the same theme in later lectures, such as that read before the Bibliographical Society in London in March 1940 and published in <span class="italic">The Library</span> in 1941. Then he wrote a short booklet, necessarily technical but very readable, on Johann Gutenberg, which the British Museum published in 1963 and later reprinted. In 1948 he gave the annual Italian lecture of the British Academy, under the title &#145;Printers and readers in Italy in the fifteenth century&#146;, published in 1949. During the Second World War he supervised the evacuation of the museum's incunabula from London to Wales, and lived with them, and worked on them, in Aberystwyth for the duration of the war.<br>
<br>In the 1950s Scholderer felt obliged to enter the controversy raging over the so-called Constance missal, a book not to be found in any British library. A copy had recently been acquired by the Pierpont Morgan Library of New York, and Scholderer was never in agreement with the keeper of printed books of that library, Curt F. B&uuml;hler, as to a very early date for the missal. He believed it to have been printed between about 1465 and 1473, probably at Basel, and his conclusions were apparently justified by the later researches of another American scholar, Allan H. Stevenson, an expert on paper studies of the fifteenth century. Nevertheless, it was characteristic of Scholderer that he always held B&uuml;hler in the highest regard as a fellow incunabulist and also as a personal friend. He was on friendly terms with all the leading bibliographical scholars of continental Europe. Perhaps not enough honours came his way, but he was an honorary doctor of the universities of Durham and Wales, president and gold medallist of the Bibliographical Society of London, fellow of the British Academy, and honorary fellow of the Pierpont Morgan Library (although he never visited America), and in 1961 he was appointed CBE.<br>
<br>Victor Scholderer married Frida Marie, daughter of Otto Semler of Berlin, on 8 May 1913; there were no children. After her death in 1950 he was a lonely widower in a dingy London flat; but he loved cats, poetry, the music of Beethoven, and above all writing another poem or yet another short article or book review in his incomparable style, still tinged with a slight Teutonic formality at times, but never less than stimulating, briefly even amusing, and eminently instructive. The bibliography of his vast output of published writings appeared three times: in <span class="italic">The Library</span> in 1955, in the selection of his <span class="italic">Fifty Essays</span> (1966), and in the imposing Festschrift presented to him for his ninetieth birthday in 1970. Even at the third attempt, the bibliography was still not quite complete. The poems which he published at his own expense in two slim volumes (<span class="italic">The Avenue, and other Verses</span>, 1959, and <span class="italic">Women of Troy</span>, 1965) are sensitive, tender, introspective, and difficult to understand. One of his greatest loves in literature was Goethe, on whose exhibition in the King's Library at the British Museum in 1949 he wrote a poem in German. Scholderer died on 11 September 1971 at Aberystwyth, which he had come to love during his wartime sojourn there. His body was cremated, possibly at Shrewsbury.<br>
