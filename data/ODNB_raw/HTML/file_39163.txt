<span class="headword">Raper,  James Hayes</span>  (1820&#150;1897), <span class="occ">temperance reformer</span>, was born on 6 October 1820 at Carlisle, the last of the twelve children of George Raper (<i>d</i>. 1820), a stonemason, and his wife, Jane (1780&#150;1860), the daughter of Edgar Thomas Pattinson. George Raper was killed before James's birth, and the boy was brought up by his mother and maternal grandmother, who were committed Wesleyans. He received some schooling, but the details of it are unknown.<br>
<br>On leaving school Raper worked for one of his brothers, a builder and sculptor, and then for a short period in a draper's shop, before being apprenticed at the locomotive engine works at New Shildon. In 1836 he attended a temperance meeting addressed by Thomas Whittaker (1813&#150;1899), and the following year he signed a pledge of total abstinence. A Sunday school teacher, he went on to help organize the New Shildon Juvenile Temperance Society.<br>
<br>Finding engineering uncongenial, Raper decided to become a schoolteacher, and after completing his apprenticeship he moved to London, where he qualified at the Borough Road Training College of the British and Foreign School Society. In 1843 he became headmaster of the Fletcher Street Wesleyan schools, Bolton. On 24 December 1844 he married a colleague, Mrs Hannah Kenny (1809&#150;1867), the daughter of John Hunter of Bacup. Together they helped form a branch of the Peace Society in Bolton. Raper was also active in the Bolton Temperance Society and was involved with the Anti-Corn Law movement. In 1846 he was elected a member of the mechanics' institute committee. He took a leading part in the Wesleyan reform agitation in Bolton in 1848, chairing a meeting to discuss changing the connexion's rules to allow lay representatives to take part in the annual conferences. This led to his expulsion by the quarterly district meeting; he subsequently resigned from the Fletcher Street School and with his wife started a private school at nearby Lark Hill.<br>
<br>Raper became involved with the prohibitionist United Kingdom Alliance at its foundation in 1853, and in 1860 he was appointed its first full-time parliamentary agent, a Manchester-based position which involved lobbying of MPs and paid a salary of &pound;500 per annum. That year he assisted Wilfrid Lawson, MP for Carlisle, to draft the <span class="roman">Permissive Bill</span> (providing for a local veto on licensing drink outlets), which the alliance aimed to have enacted as a first step towards total prohibition. A popular orator, Raper spoke widely on the temperance question and represented the alliance at major conventions. In 1873 he visited Sweden to study the licensing system there, and in 1875 he toured Canada and the United States to investigate the working of prohibition, which he deemed a political success. In 1878 he stood as a Liberal candidate in a parliamentary by-election in Peterborough, but failed to win the seat. In the same year he resigned his position as parliamentary agent and joined the executive of the alliance; he continued lobbying MPs and speaking at temperance meetings.<br>
<br>Raper's first wife died on 4 March 1867. On 22 November 1879 he married Amelia Eliza Tisdall of Tunbridge Wells, the third daughter of Edmund Tisdall, a dyer, of Kensington. The couple settled permanently in London at 33 Pembroke Square, Kensington, where Raper died from complications of influenza on 19 May 1897. A funeral service was held at Brompton cemetery on 24 May, and various memorial services followed over the next few days. Raper was survived by his wife; he had no children.<br>
<br>Raper was one of the most popular orators of the temperance movement. He was very knowledgeable on the drink question and a respected and effective lobbyist. In December 1897 a memorial fund was set up to finance an annual lecture on temperance known as the Lees&#150;Raper lectureship. (The temperance reformer F. R. Lees had also died in May of that year.) During his life Raper had also been involved with a range of other social and political reform causes, including anti-slavery, anti-smoking, vegetarianism, peace, free trade, parliamentary reform, purity, and sabbatarianism.<br>
