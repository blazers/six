<span class="headword">Ferrers,  Henry</span>  (1550&#150;1633), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, came of a family descended from the thirteenth-century earls of Derby through the lords of the barony of Ferrers of Groby. His father, <a name="cosubject_9359"></a><span class="headword">Edward Ferrers</span>  (1524<span class="mult">x</span>7&#150;1564)<span class="occ"></span>, was the only son of Henry Ferrers (<i>d</i>. 1526) and Katherine, the daughter and coheir of Sir John Hampden of Hampden, Buckinghamshire. Edward's grandfather Edward Ferrers (<i>d</i>. 1535) had acquired the manor of Baddesley Clinton, Warwickshire, through marriage to Constance (<i>d</i>. 1551), younger daughter and coheir of Nicholas Brome, and established it as the family seat. Edward succeeded to his grandfather's estate as a child and his wardship was acquired by Elizabeth, the widow of Sir Thomas Englefield and daughter of Sir Robert Throckmorton; he had probably come of age by 1545. The royal marriage of Katherine Parr, a kinswoman to the Throckmortons, led Edward Ferrers into court circles, and he attended the funerals of both Edward VI and Mary as a gentleman pensioner. In 1548 he married Bridget (<i>d</i>. 1582), the daughter of William Windsor, second Baron Windsor; they had six sons and three daughters. Ferrers represented Warwick in Mary's first parliament, but otherwise played little part in public affairs. The last years of his life were dogged by financial troubles, and by the time of his death his estates were in the control of his brother-in-law Edward, third Baron Windsor. He died at the latter's home, Hewell Grange, and was buried at Tardebigge church on 10 August 1564. Anthony Wood records a man of his name as a playwright, thereby perpetuating the error of Richard Puttenham and Francis Meres in attributing to Edward Ferrers the works of the Hertfordshire poet and MP George Ferrers.<br>
<br>Henry Ferrers, who was born on 26 January 1550, was still a minor when his father died; his mother subsequently married Andrew Ognall, who acquired his stepson's wardship. Ferrers was sent to Hart Hall, Oxford, and in 1572 entered the Middle Temple. In 1582 he married Jane White, granddaughter of Sir Thomas White of South Warnborough, Hampshire. Three children&#151;Joan (who died in infancy), Edward, and Mary&#151;were born before Jane's death in 1586. Like other lawyers with antiquarian interests Ferrers seems to have used his expertise in preparing legal cases rather than practising as an advocate. A notebook in the Bodleian Library (MS Rawlinson B. 470) shows him consulting the records of James Strangeman and Francis Thynne on behalf of his kinsman Edward Neville during a lawsuit over the barony of Abergavenny. For several years he divided his time between his Warwickshire estates and London before acquiring a house in Westminster in 1589 and letting Baddesley Clinton. This may represent both a retrenchment of expenses and an attempt to pursue a legal and parliamentary career in the capital. He may well have been the Henry Ferrers who represented Cirencester in 1593, as legally minded antiquaries were recognized as useful members of the house. In 1597 he was elected for Callington, Cornwall, through the influence of its mayor, the antiquary Richard Carew of Antony. Ferrers appears to have been prevented from taking his seat by an outlawry for debt, although this did not prevent his being pricked soon afterwards as sheriff of Rutland, where he retained some property until 1601. He retained the house in Westminster until 1604, when he assigned the lease to Thomas Percy, thus becoming indirectly linked to the Gunpowder Plot. Although never convicted as a recusant, his diary (BL, Add. MS 4102) indicates his conservatism in religion and he was close to Catholic circles, as witnessed by the leasing of Baddesley Clinton to Anne Vaux and her sister in the 1590s.<br>
<br>Like many of his fellow antiquaries Henry Ferrers seems to have first developed an interest in his own pedigree, which expanded to include the genealogy of his kinsmen and neighbours and the history of the neighbourhood of his family seat. In London he made contact with many of the principal antiquaries of the day, such as Carew, William Camden, John Stow, and Richard St George. He provided Camden with material on Warwickshire for the <span class="italic">Britannia</span> and was acknowledged in the work as:<blockquote>a man both for parentage and for knowledge of antiquity, very commendable and my special friend; who hath at all times courteously shewed me the right way when I was out, and from his candle, as it were, hath lighted mine. (<span class="italic">Britannia</span>, ed. Gibson, 506)</blockquote>He was thus closely associated with the circle of the Elizabethan Society of Antiquaries, although there is no evidence that he was ever accepted as a member. He amassed a considerable collection of antiquarian material, of which only a fraction survives. His notes indicate that he contemplated writing histories of the kings of England and of the earls of Warwick, while fellow antiquaries such as Sampson Erdeswick undoubtedly encouraged him to write a history of Warwickshire, but there is no surviving evidence of any sustained attempt at authorship.<br>
<br>The impression gained from his papers is that Henry Ferrers was a collector rather than a synthesizer. He remained an authority on Warwickshire history throughout his life, and in 1617 he was included in the list of proposed members of Edmund Bolton's Academy Royal. Before his death at his manor house at Kingswood, Warwickshire, on 10 October 1633, his kinsman Sir Simon Archer had begun researching the history of the county. Archer was subsequently allowed to make full use of Ferrers's collections by the latter's son and grandson, as is shown by their prominence in the footnotes of William Dugdale's <span class="italic">Antiquities of Warwickshire</span> (1656). Much of the anecdotal material in that work is also attributed to Ferrers, which may represent the oral transmission of tradition from the older antiquary to Dugdale through Archer. Although critical of Ferrers's accuracy in his correspondence with Archer, Dugdale acknowledged in his works &#145;his eminent knowledge in Antiquities&#146;  (Dugdale, 711). Ferrers was buried at Baddesley Clinton.<br>
