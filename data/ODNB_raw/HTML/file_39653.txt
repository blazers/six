<span class="headword">Steele,  Robert</span>  (1791&#150;1879), <span class="occ">shipbuilder</span>, was the son of <a name="cosubject_40787"></a><span class="headword">Robert Steele</span>  (1745&#150;1830) and Elizabeth Scott (1750&#150;1800). The elder Robert Steele was the son of James Steele (1709&#150;1786), shipbuilder, and his wife, Anne Laurie (1720&#150;1795). James Steele had a small shipyard at Saltcoats, Ayrshire, specializing in fishing vessels and coasters, and it was here that his son learnt his craft as an apprentice <span class="occ">shipwright</span>. When his father died in 1786, Robert took charge of the firm, and he remained in Saltcoats for another decade. While there he married Elizabeth Scott and they had at least four children.<br>
<br>In 1796 the family moved to Greenock, where Robert went into partnership with John Carswell, who had an established shipyard in the town. The move may have been prompted by the recent start of the Napoleonic wars, which created a strong demand for all types of shipping and maintained ocean freight rates at a high level for an extended period. Steele and Carswell's first vessel was the brig <i>Clyde</i> (145 tons), launched in April 1797.<br>
<br>The firm's yard was located west of the town, on the shores of the Bay of Quick; but it had several drawbacks. The gently shelving coast there made it necessary to have exceptionally long launching ways. It also meant that the fitting-out dock had to be built well out into the Clyde, resulting in regular storm damage. Nevertheless the firm prospered. About thirty-five vessels were launched from the site during the twenty-year duration of the partnership, including the <i>Bengal</i>, the first East Indiaman built at Greenock.<br>
<br>The partnership between Steele and Carswell was dissolved in 1815 and a new company was formed&#151;Robert Steele &amp; Co.&#151;a partnership between the elder Robert and his two sons, James and Robert. Robert Steele &amp; Co. seems to have built its first steamship in 1821. So quickly did it become involved in this new field of endeavour that in 1826 it launched the <i>United Kingdom</i>, so far the largest wooden paddle-steamship in the world. Robert Steele retired soon after, and he died in 1830 in Greenock, where he was buried. During his time at Greenock he had supervised the construction of more than fifty vessels, including six steamers, one of them the world's biggest.<br>
<br>Born on 4 December 1791 and baptized at Ardrossan, Ayrshire, the younger Robert Steele now took charge of the firm (his brother James, the other partner, having died in 1826). Steele had married in 1818 Margaret Eliza Reed (1791&#150;1855) and they had at least four children. Unlike his father, Robert Steele took a close interest in public affairs in Greenock. He was a town councillor, a magistrate, and a justice of the peace, as well as a leading churchman and freemason. He had a strong interest in harbour and dock improvement, and was the promoter of a scheme to build Victoria harbour. However, these outside interests do not seem to have hindered his shipbuilding activities, as he was able to maintain the high standards set by his father.<br>
<br>During the 1840s the firm became known for producing high-quality, wooden-hulled paddle steamers. One of these vessels, the 650 ton <i>Unicorn</i>, was bought by Samuel Cunard and became the first ship to make the Atlantic crossing under his flag. Steele's connection with Cunard was further strengthened by an order to build the hull of the <i>Columbia</i>, one of four steamers built to fulfil a lucrative government mail contract awarded to Cunard in 1839. The work on the <i>Columbia</i> must have been satisfactory, as the firm then worked on all but four of the first thirteen Cunard steamers&#151;vessels that established the reputation for reliability and safety that was to be the foundation of Cunard's subsequent success.<br>
<br>The rapid pace of change in ship design meant, however, that Steele's prominence in the first generation of steamship construction was short-lived. Within a few years of being launched, wooden-hulled paddle steamships were made redundant by faster and more durable iron-hulled vessels. These new ships were in turn soon replaced by vessels using screw propellers rather than paddle wheels. Yet even when Steele's steamers were superseded, their construction was such that they continued to give many years of useful service, sometimes serving purely as sailing ships on the long Far Eastern routes.<br>
<br>Robert Steele proved equal to the challenge posed by the new technology, and in 1854 he opened a larger yard at Cartsdyke West, Greenock to produce iron-hulled screw steamers. Orders were slow at first, and for a time the yard had to rely on fitting-out and maintenance work, but the firm persisted in seeking larger orders and was rewarded with a new era of prosperity. In 1857 it was commissioned to build a 1500 ton passenger liner for the Glasgow firm of Handyside and Henderson, followed two years later by the contract for a 2000 ton screw steamer called the <i>Canadian</i>, for the Allan Line of Glasgow and Montreal.<br>
<br>A large part of the firm's success throughout its history seems to have been a steadfast commitment to quality in design, materials, and workmanship. Clyde-built vessels generally, and Steele-built ones in particular, were made to last. The success of the firm also owed something to a network of contacts built up by Robert Steele and maintained by his sons with the owners and managers of shipping lines and other larger shipbuilders, to whom the company sometimes acted as sub-contractor; but rapid change in steamship design continued to take place, making it increasingly difficult for established yards to keep up with each new wave of advances. When steel replaced iron in hull construction, technological change had once again overtaken the company.<br>
<br>Fortunately, Steeles had continued to accept orders for commercial sailing ships, yachts, and barges. Between 1864 and 1869, for instance, the firm built forty-five sailing ships, but not one steam-powered vessel. What allowed this return to sail was the expansion of the long Australian and Far East trade routes, where wind power could still compete with steam.<br>
<br>Among Steele's finest achievements during these years were about twenty clippers made for the tea trade with China; the first was the <i>Kate Carne</i>, launched in 1855. Built like racing yachts, many of these beautiful vessels, such as the <i>Serica</i>, the <i>Falcon</i>, the <i>Ariel</i>, the <i>Taeping</i>, and the <i>Sir Lancelot</i>, became famous when they won the China Tea race year after year. No expense was spared to help land the first tea of the season at London, and the superior design and construction of the Steele-built tea clippers saw them become the standard by which others were judged.<br>
<br>However, the design and building of steamships continued to the point where such vessels could compete with sailing ships on these routes also. Steeles continued to build wind-powered ships, notably large passenger vessels for the Australian run, and many immigrants first saw the shores of their new homeland from the deck of a Steele-built vessel.<br>
<br>Steeles, and the town of Greenock generally, had cause to regret the coming of steam. The town's prominence owed much to its location near the mouth of the Clyde, the funnel through which most of industrial Scotland's trade flowed. But, with the introduction of steam power and extensive harbour and river improvements along the upper Clyde during the nineteenth century, Greenock lost much of this advantage. Large steamers could now continue much further upriver by themselves, thus removing the need to call at Greenock.<br>
<br>Steeles soon became a casualty of these changing times and circumstances. Robert Steele died at 11 Margaret Street, Greenock, on 4 July 1879, and, though his son Robert (1821&#150;1890) took charge of the firm, a downturn in the general economic climate in the early 1880s, combined with some unsuccessful investments by Robert Steele in other areas, helped to bring about the firm's closure in 1883. In November of that year the yard was sold to Scott &amp; Co. of Greenock for &pound;40,000.<br>
<br>During its existence Robert Steele &amp; Co. built thirty-four vessels at the Bay of Quick and 273 at the Cartsburn yard (formerly called Cartsdyke West). Among these were nearly one hundred steamers, including eleven for Cunard and ten for the Allan Line. Between 1816 and 1882 total output was about 197,000 tons.<br>
