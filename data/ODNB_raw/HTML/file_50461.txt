<span class="headword">Allsopp,  Henry</span>, first Baron Hindlip  (1811&#150;1887), <span class="occ">brewer</span>, was born on 19 February 1811 at Burton upon Trent, the third but only surviving son of Samuel Allsopp of Burton upon Trent and his wife, Frances, only daughter and heir of Charles Fowler of Shrewsbury.<br>
<br>The firm of Samuel Allsopp &amp; Sons had claims to be the oldest brewery in Burton: Samuel Allsopp's uncle and great-uncle (both named Benjamin Wilson) were the most prominent exporters of Burton ales to the Baltic from the 1740s to the 1800s. Like M. T. Bass, Allsopps were early entrants to the Indian trade and the firm was the first to brew India pale ale (IPA) in Burton in 1822. The firm flourished both in the Indian export trade and the English domestic market in the 1830s and 1840s. Virtually no records survive for the firm before its incorporation in 1887 and it is difficult to trace its growth. Although it always appears to have followed in the wake of its great rival, Bass, Allsopps was by any reckoning a spectacularly successful Victorian firm before the mid-1880s, acknowledged as the world's third biggest brewery in the 1870s. Henry Allsopp was the key figure in its development after he took over the direction of the firm from his father in 1838.<br>
<br>Relying on the burgeoning demand for premium Burton pale ales and constructing a network of agencies, stores, and bottling contracts, Allsopp saw production increase from a few thousand barrels a year in 1830 to a peak of 700,000 barrels in the mid-1870s. The firm's beers were sold in forty-four countries abroad, and the new brewery built in the late 1850s was <i>the</i> model British brewery of the third quarter of the nineteenth century, combining the most up-to-date machinery with convenience of layout. With its &#145;enormous dimensions, handsome elevations&#146;, Alfred Barnard ranked it in 1889 &#145;equal to any in the Kingdom&#146;  (Weir and others, 133). The firm was also in the van of employing brewing scientists.<br>
<br>In February 1887 Allsopps was floated on the stock market and was sold by the family to the new company for &pound;3.3 million. Following the wildly successful incorporation of Guinness as a public company in October 1886, the investing public's demand for brewery shares was insatiable, and the flotation seemed as triumphant as that of Guinness. There was said to be fighting in the street for prospectuses, and the chairman reported applications from 37,000 individuals for &pound;105 million worth of capital, an over-subscription of some thirtyfold. The reality, as commentators in the know pointed out, was very different. Although profits over the previous five years had increased&#151;owing solely to the lowest brewing material prices within memory&#151;sales had declined by almost one-third of their 1875 peak. With Henry Allsopp's advancing years, the firm was losing its lead, especially exposed by its decision not to acquire a large tied-house estate. Goodwill in the new company balance sheet was inflated to a crazy eight times average net profits. The prospect of an 8 per cent dividend on ordinary shares was held out; in fact the company never paid more than 7 per cent in the next twenty-eight years, and in no fewer than twenty of them distributed no dividend at all. Henry Allsopp, an old and honourable man, was immensely hurt by accusations in the financial press that his family had sold to a gullible public a vastly overpriced pup on a false prospectus. Within six weeks of the flotation he was dead.<br>
<br>Oddly, given his wealth and his firm's prominence in the industry, Henry Allsopp cut a much smaller figure than M. T. Bass both in Burton and the national trade. Seemingly much less conscious of publicity, he nevertheless served as Conservative MP for East Worcestershire from 1874 to 1880. Moreover, although generous to brewing trade charities, he was a more modest benefactor to his home town than his rivals, the Bass family. The principals of the two firms might meet from time to time to discuss prices, gravities, discounts, and loans to publicans, but in general a historic, deep-seated rivalry existed between the two firms. When, like many a member of the Victorian new, super rich, the Allsopps claimed ancient descent (from a knight in Richard II's reign), the news caused mirth at Bass.<br>
<br>In May 1880 Henry Allsopp was created a baronet; in February 1886 he was elevated to a barony, the first fully signed-up member of the &#145;beerage&#146;. He became a modest large landowner, in 1873 owning 1158 acres at Hindlip Hall, Worcestershire. On 21 August 1839 he married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1906), second daughter of William Tongue of Comberford Hall, Staffordshire; they had six sons (two of whom were MPs at the time of their father's death) and two daughters. Lord Hindlip died on 2 April 1887 at Hindlip Hall, Worcestershire. None of his sons inherited his entrepreneurial abilities; although three remained on the board of the new company after 1887, the company came to have the reputation of being the worst managed big brewery in Britain before 1914.<br>
