<span class="headword">Knight,  Elizabeth</span>  (1869&#150;1933), <span class="occ">doctor and campaigner for women's suffrage</span>, was born on 31 August 1869 at Hive House, Northfleet, Kent, the third child and only daughter of John Messer Knight (1813/14&#150;1880), a cement manufacturer, and his wife, Hannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lucas. The family was Quaker; the firm of Knight, Bevan, and Sturge was eventually amalgamated with others in Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers Ltd. Elizabeth Knight was educated at Kensington high school and at Newnham College, Cambridge (1888&#150;91), where she read classics but did not take a degree. She trained at the London School of Medicine for Women, qualifying in 1904, and then practised as a general practitioner in London until her death, with a brief interlude in 1912&#150;13 when she returned to Cambridge to study for the diploma in public health.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Knight joined the Women's Freedom League, one of the main societies campaigning for women's suffrage, and in 1908 was imprisoned after attempting to interview the prime minister, H. H. Asquith, at 10 Downing Street. She turned her prison experience to good use by writing a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Social and Sanitary Conditions of Prison Life</span>. She was a stalwart of the tax resistance campaign, by which women refused to pay taxes while unrepresented in parliament, was prosecuted on several occasions, and received two further prison sentences. Elizabeth Knight was a wealthy woman, having inherited a share of her father's estate, and a generous benefactor to the suffrage cause. By 1913 she was treasurer of the Women's Freedom League, holding this position until her death, and during her lifetime she subsidized the league's paper, <span class="italic">The Vote</span>. During the First World War Elizabeth Knight actively opposed the 40D regulation, which involved the compulsory examination of women suspected of having transmitted venereal disease to a member of the armed forces. In 1920 she helped to found the Minerva Club, which was open to men and women in sympathy with progressive thought and which attracted members from all branches of the erstwhile militant suffrage movement. A very long lease on its premises in Bloomsbury, on the west side of Brunswick Square, was paid for by Dr Knight, who also furnished the club and supported it financially during her lifetime. In the years before women achieved full enfranchisement in 1928, she ran the press and publicity campaign for the equal political rights campaign. Elizabeth Knight never married, but adopted a daughter, Elsie Glover Knight. She died at 13 Victoria Road, Brighton, on 29 October 1933, after being injured there in a road accident.<br>
