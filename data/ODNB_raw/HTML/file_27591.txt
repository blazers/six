<span class="headword">Towerson,  Gabriel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1576, <em>d.</em> 1623), <span class="occ">naval officer and agent for the East India Company</span>, was baptized on 27 February 1576 in the parish church of St Michael Cornhill, London, the tenth of twelve children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27593/', "William Towerson (d. 1584)")</script>, member of the Skinners' Company and common councilman of London. His father led three pioneering voyages to equatorial west Africa in the years 1555&#150;8 and was subsequently a prominent member of the Muscovy, Eastland, and Spanish companies, and a principal promoter of the Fenton expedition of 1582. Towerson's mother, William's second wife, was Parnell (<i>d</i>. 1615), a younger daughter of Nicholas Wilford (<i>d</i>. 1551), gentleman, merchant tailor, and member of parliament for London. Her eldest brother, and William Towerson's close associate, was Thomas Wilford, esquire, of Wandsworth, Surrey, common councilman, 1561&#150;99, and City chamberlain, 1591&#150;1603. The marriage, in 1565, produced four daughters and four sons. Gabriel outlived all but two of his siblings and his half-brothers and sisters: William the younger (1563&#150;1630), the commander of a privateer in 1587 and later a City alderman, member of parliament, and director of the Spanish Company, 1604, and the East India Company, 1619; and Robert (<i>b</i>. 1580), the youngest child, who in 1621 sought employment with the East India Company.<br>
<br>Towerson's early life is obscure. About 1580 his father moved the family to St Gabriel Fenchurch, London, where his mother lived as a widow until her death. Under the terms of William Towerson's will Parnell was to have the custody and bringing up of his children, with the benefit of their portions until each reached the age of majority. For Gabriel, this date was February 1597. His equal share of the estate would have been substantial, but was in large measure delayed until his mother's decease. Parnell Towerson exercised her widow's right to engage in commerce and register apprentices up to at least 1614, and all her sons sought out their freedoms by patrimony in the Skinners', Spanish, and other companies, although specific information for Gabriel has not come to light. William the younger was a founding member of the East India Company in 1600. Gabriel Towerson sailed to the East on the first company voyage; he is mentioned in the last will of John Badby, William Towerson's apprenticed factor, composed at Sumatra on 6 July 1602, and at Bantam in the wills of other factors, composed on 30 January and 12 April 1604. He was, therefore, one of the first resident factors, and remained at Bantam until he returned to England in November 1609 aboard the <i>Red Dragon</i>. In 1611 Towerson sailed from London as captain of the <i>Hector</i>, and resumed his work at Bantam, returning home in the <i>Hector</i> in September 1613 in company with Nicholas Downton. In January 1614 he was accused of private trading, but the penalty was remitted upon his payment of freight charges. Later in the year, with his account not yet cleared, Towerson was none the less admitted to the freedom, in reward for his long service. By 1617 he was in India, and active in the Red Sea ports, where he provoked the ire of Sir Thomas Roe, the English ambassador. He apparently married and maintained an Armenian wife at Agra, but returned to England alone in 1618.<br>
<br>On 24 January 1620 Towerson was ordered to proceed to the East as a principal factor. Lengthy delays ensued. During the voyage out the experienced captain was placed in command of the <i>Lesser James</i>, after quarrels between the master, John Wood, and the pilot, John Davis, proved to be irreconcilable. The situation in the Indies was perilous. On 29 June 1621 the council at Jakarta had observed &#145;the Dutch &hellip; never will performe annie thing on the Agreement [with the English], further then to serve their own purposes&#146;  (BL OIOC, G/40/1, p. 81). Meanwhile the junior factors refused to continue at their posts beyond the expiration of their apprenticeships, and the factories and vessels were convulsed with infighting and personal recriminations. The letter sent home from Jakarta on 6 November 1621 by Towerson and the council despaired of peaceful co-existence with the Dutch, a sentiment repeated in every dispatch over ensuing months. On 11 January 1622 the council at Jakarta dispatched Towerson to Amboyna &#145;for a linguist and an accomptaunt&#146; to replace the departing George Muschamp. This communication concluded ominously: &#145;The dutch growne a most evell and bloudy nation &amp; murthering all they take, and take all they meete friende and foes&#146;  (BL OIOC, G/40/1, p. 104).<br>
<br>The English narrative of events at Amboyna in February of 1623 is straightforward. On 15 February Towerson and his colleagues were arrested by Dutch authorities on suspicion of plotting to seize the castle of Amboyna. Confessions were extracted under torture. The English commander and nine countrymen, one Portuguese, and nine Japanese were executed on 27 February, all except Towerson being buried in a common grave. The East India Company departed the Moluccas, leaving the spice trade to their rivals. Survivors claimed English innocence and Dutch perfidy and this cry was reported at the court of directors and at Whitehall, with calls for reparations. Amboyna was long a byword in the British Isles for Dutch dishonesty and cruelty. John Dryden played upon these sentiments with his propaganda drama, <span class="italic">Amboyna</span>, of 1673; the play reflected the context of the Third Anglo-Dutch War, rather than the events of 1623, but Gabriel Towerson was immortalized as a devout, honest protestant. All those executed died intestate; when the administration of Towerson's estate was secured by his brother William in November 1624 the deceased was described as unmarried. The fate of his wife is unknown, although in the following January it was noted that the company would pay to send Towerson's son to the Indies.<br>
