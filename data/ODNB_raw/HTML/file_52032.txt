<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Gwyer,  Barbara Elizabeth</span>  (1881&#150;1974), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was born at 11 Dorchester Place, Marylebone, London, on 1 January 1881, the only daughter of John Edward Gwyer, secretary to the Provident Clerks' Life Assurance Association, and his wife, Edith, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Linford. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33619/', "Sir Maurice Linford Gwyer")</script>, the lawyer and civil servant, was her brother. She was educated at the Grove School, Highgate, Middlesex. From 1900 to 1904 she was a scholar at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, where she gained seconds in classical moderations (1902) and in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1904). She later graduated BA and MA in 1920, when Oxford degrees were finally opened to women. After completing her studies she spent two years doing secretarial work, after which, from 1906, she was educational organizer for the West Riding county council educational department.<br>
<br>In her two subsequent positions Barbara Gwyer was responsible for women students in their university accommodation, overseeing their pastoral care and physical needs, and ensuring that their place of residence was comfortable and appropriate to the <i>mores</i> of the period. Between 1910 and 1916 she was vice-warden of Ashburne Hall, University of Manchester, which had opened in 1900. In 1917 she was appointed warden of University Hall, Leeds, where she worked until 1924. The position of warden was an attractive one for a woman of Barbara Gwyer's level of education:<blockquote>After 1900, many of the new generation of university-educated women saw the wardenship of university hostels and halls of residence as a valuable career opening, offering scope for their talents, qualifications and experience. (Dyhouse, 108)</blockquote>Barbara Gwyer's appointment as principal of St Hugh's College, Oxford (founded in 1886), came at the end of a stormy period for the college following the notorious &#145;row&#146; between Eleanor Jourdain, principal of the college (1915&#150;24), and a group of women tutors. In the wake of an inquiry by the university chancellor in 1924 which found for the St Hugh's tutors, Miss Jourdain died suddenly of a heart attack, leaving a college in turmoil and in need of sound guidance and leadership. &#145;At this moment Barbara Gwyer took over and to her the college undoubtedly owes its subsequent recovery&#146;  (Thornton, 10). Her &#145;quiet and healing influence which would allow confidence and trust to grow again&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 19 Feb 1974) was universally praised. Dedicated and devout, she led the college with firm direction. Women had only recently been admitted to full membership of the university and she was aware of the need for tact. Her long tenure as principal&#151;twenty-two years&#151;helped to lay a firm foundation for the successful future of women's higher education in Oxford. She held the college together during the Second World War, a challenging task in that it was then housed in seven separate sites. In wartime she also represented Oxford University on the southern region tribunal for conscientious objectors.<br>
<br>Barbara Gwyer's capable leadership was appreciated by Elizabeth Wordsworth, founder of St Hugh's and herself a former principal of Lady Margaret Hall. An existing friendship between the two women was deepened during the early years of Barbara Gwyer's principalship, and Miss Wordsworth welcomed the strengthening of a connection with St Hugh's which had been strained under Miss Gwyer's predecessors. Barbara Gwyer eschewed glamour and sophistication, preferring simplicity and dignity. Known to her students as &#145;the Gwyer&#146;, &#145;she had a magnificent Episcopal presence&#146;  (Pitt) and a strong individuality and determination which refused to be swayed by the opinions of others. Her Christian beliefs were deeply held and she described a college as being &#145;called into being by God &hellip; a society in which each member exists in unescapable [<i>sic</i>] responsibility to his fellows&#146;  (Gwyer, &#145;Elizabeth Wordsworth&#146;, 95). She was also imbued with a unique sense of humour which was appreciated by her students.<br>
<br>Upon her retirement in 1946 Barbara Gwyer was made an honorary fellow of St Hugh's College. Looking back on her career, she described herself as &#145;the last of the amateur Principals&#146;  (Gwyer, &#145;Report of gaudy&#146;, 11). During a lengthy retirement, living in Stokenchurch, Buckinghamshire, she was, variously, a member of Buckinghamshire education committee, chairman of council, St Margaret's House Settlement, Bethnal Green, east London, and a founder of the Institute of Christian Education. Barbara Castle commented in her diary on her return to St Hugh's as an honorary fellow for a dinner in February 1970: &#145;there was the Gwyer, a frail, gentle figure in a wheelchair&#151;aeons away from the ogre I had known when she was principal&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diaries 1964&#150;70</span>, 766). She died at her home, New Patch, New Road, Stokenchurch, on 16 February 1974.<br>
