<div class="para">
<span class="headword">McLean,  (John David) Ruari McDowall Hardie</span>  (1917&#150;2006), <span class="occ">typographer and author</span>, was born on 10 June 1917 at Herouncroft, Minnigaff, Newton Stewart, Kirkcudbrightshire, the only child of John Thomson McLean, a customs and excise officer, whose own father had been a shoemaker from Stranraer, and his wife, Isabella Mary (Isabel), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ireland, a publisher's editor and primary school teacher. A childhood spent in Oxford, where his father had been posted, was a happy one. His parents had artistic and literary leanings and sent him to the Dragon School and Eastbourne College. After failing to gain a classical scholarship to Oxford and unsure of his future, at the suggestion of a family friend, Basil Blackwell, he entered the Shakespeare Head Press to learn printing. At the Shakespeare Head he was guided by the distinguished book designer Bernard Newdigate, who helped him to obtain work experience in a German printing firm. After attending Edinburgh School of Printing he undertook further training at <span class="italic">The Studio</span> and Percy Lund Humphries, a forward-looking Bradford printing firm, where he discovered his lifelong influence, Jan Tschichold, whose book <span class="italic">Die neue Typographie</span> (1928) trumpeted a revolutionary style of asymmetric design. For the rest of his life McLean retained a receptiveness to modern influences.<br>
<br>Despite pacifist leanings, at the outbreak of the Second World War McLean volunteered for the Royal Navy, serving first in submarines as a liaison officer on the Free French submarine <i>Rubis</i> (which, he was delighted to find, carried few torpedoes because of the space required for 900 litres of red wine), and then as a naval intelligence officer, becoming a member of COPP (combined operations pilotage parties) conducting dangerous reconnaissance surveys of Japanese-held beaches in the Far East. He was awarded the Croix de Guerre in 1942 and the DSC in 1943. Much later he wrote a memoir of his wartime career, <span class="italic">Half Seas Under</span> (2001). On 24 January 1945 he married Antonia Maxwell Carlisle (1919&#150;1995), a 25-year-old history teacher (and daughter of Henry George Carlisle, medical practitioner), with whom he had two sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>In 1946 McLean, who had been in touch with Allen Lane before the war when he was sharing a flat with Edward Young, designer of the Penguin emblem, became responsible for the design of the lively <span class="roman">Puffin Picture Books</span> series, which introduced him to many artists who became his friends. He was one of the small band after the war making typography a new profession. In 1947 Tschichold, now embracing a classical approach, had been brought in to advise on design. McLean was able to cement his friendship with him and was later to translate his writings and write two books about him, <span class="italic">Jan Tschichold, Typographer</span> (1975) and <span class="italic">Jan Tschichold: a Life in Typography</span> (1997).<br>
<br>McLean left Penguin in 1949, and, besides teaching for a period at the Royal College of Art, became involved in the planning and design of the children's magazine <span class="italic">The Eagle</span>, the brainchild of the clergyman Marcus Morris, whose parish magazine for Colnbrook, near the Penguin headquarters, McLean had initially redesigned. In 1951 he joined George Rainbird to found Rainbird, McLean, a pioneering firm devising &#145;package&#146; books, where McLean's skill designing complex illustrated books with Rainbird's business acumen produced, notably, the <span class="roman">About Britain</span> guides, edited by Geoffrey Grigson, and reproductions of flower and bird books. Always helpful to others, he gave work to Rowley Atterbury, whose printing firm the Westerham Press grew to become the major printer of illustrated books in the country. These books were widely copied and changed the face of illustrated book publications. Through the influence of Robert Harling, who had published and written a series of influential journals including <span class="italic">Typography</span> and <span class="italic">Alphabet and Image</span>, McLean founded his own periodical, <span class="italic">Motif</span>. Its lively and original thirteen issues, published between 1958 and 1967, added modern sculpture and painting to its typographical content.<br>
<br>McLean maintained that to survive a book typographer needs to write. Books soon poured from his pen: <span class="italic">Modern Book Design</span> (1951, updated 1958) was followed by the pioneering <span class="italic">Victorian Book Design and Colour Printing</span> (1963), <span class="italic">Victorian Publishers' Bookbindings in Cloth and Leather</span> (1973), and <span class="italic">Victorian Publishers' Bookbindings in Paper</span> (1983). His influential <span class="italic">Thames and Hudson Manual of Typography</span> (1980) was widely translated and much reprinted. From the early 1960s he enjoyed being an assessor of graphic design at art schools all over the country. He gave the Sandars lectures in bibliography at Cambridge in 1983. He also wrote monographs on the contemporary illustrators Joan Hassall, Edward Bawden, and Nicolas Bentley, as well as on the pioneering Victorian publishers and printers Joseph Cundall and Benjamin Fawcett. He amassed a huge collection of magazines, besides his collection of Victorian coloured books, useful when writing the first book on the subject in 1969, a practitioner's manual, <span class="italic">Magazine Design</span>. The appeal of the balance of illustration and type to McLean probably originated in a childhood spent in bed with recurring tonsillitis, when he preferred reading magazines to books.<br>
<br>Leaving Rainbird in 1958, McLean had formed Ruari McLean Associates in partnership with Fianach Jardine, daughter of the England cricket captain Douglas Jardine, setting up an office with their corgi, Slocum, in Villiers Street, London. Besides being consultant to the new <span class="italic">Observer</span> magazine and the <span class="italic">New Scientist</span>, he became honorary adviser to the Stationery Office in 1966, for which he was appointed CBE in 1973.<br>
<br>Also in 1973 McLean and his wife moved to Dollar, Clackmannanshire. The <span class="italic">Concise Scots Dictionary</span> and Lorimer's <span class="italic">New Testament in Scots</span> were two of the many books he designed there. Eight years later, at the time he was appointed a trustee of the National Library of Scotland, they moved to a row of fishermen's cottages at Carsaig on the Isle of Mull. A large Scandinavian log cabin was constructed to accommodate his 10,000 volumes, some of which were later housed in the University of Toronto. There he wrote his autobiography, <span class="italic">True to Type</span> (2000), &#145;anecdotal, engaging, laddish and sometimes a bit chaotic&#146;, as James Fergusson aptly put it  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 8 April 2006). Courageous, a lover of humour, fine wine, and the company of beautiful women, McLean had above all the capacity to enjoy life to the full. In his autobiography are reproduced his witty line drawings. He delighted his friends with his skilfully drawn Christmas cards, and his godchildren with rebuses. He could have been a cartoonist, as evidenced by his illustrations for <span class="italic">McLean's Silly Diving Signals</span>, published by the Scottish Sub-Aqua Club in 1990. Following the death of his wife, Antonia, in 1995 he moved to Tillicoultry, near Dollar. He died at the Royal Infirmary, Stirling, on 27 March 2006, of bronchopneumonia and acute kidney failure due to rhabdomyolysis. He was survived by his three children.<br>
