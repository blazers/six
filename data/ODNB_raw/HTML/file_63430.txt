<span class="headword">Hay,  Alexander</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1639), <span class="occ">army officer in the Swedish service</span>, was born in Scotland of unknown parents. Although there are references to Hay's arriving in Sweden in 1600, nothing more is known of him there until 1632. There was also a Lieutenant Alexander Hay serving in the kingdom of Denmark&#150;Norway before this time, who achieved the rank of captain and was paid off in 1628. This date coincides with Danish&#150;Norwegian withdrawal from the Thirty Years' War, so it is probable that Hay then entered into Swedish service, as this was a common path for many other Scots in Danish service. Robert Monro mentions one Saunders Hay who became captain for Annan's company and initially remained in Scotland before entering Swedish service. This would fit with Hay's first listing on Swedish military muster rolls in 1632, serving as a major in Patrick Ruthven's regiment. The following year, while serving in Francis Ruthven's recruited regiment, he gained promotion to lieutenant-colonel. He also acted as the chief of a squadron of dragoons. At some point before 1631 Hay married Dorotea Plessen, and they had at least two sons.<br>
<br>Hay was stationed at Memel, a Polish town which had been taken by the Swedish king Gustav II Adolf in 1628 and subsequently handed over to Sweden for six years. While in the service of the governor there, Hay became involved in the Polish authorities' complaints against a certain Captain Thomas Hume who had plundered some Jews in 1633. Hay himself offered to compensate the Jews, but as Hume was already in gaol and could not repay Hay, he turned to Colonel Ruthven for help. Ruthven took great offence at this and made Hay's life so unpleasant that he wanted to leave the regiment. At this time a Polish nobleman, Crispin Kerstenstein, corresponded with Hay, and suggested that he enter Polish service. Hay then approached the Swedish authorities and requested the termination of his commission because of his problems with Colonel Ruthven. However, when the Swedish General Herman Wrangel heard of this Hay was summoned for an interview. Hay explained that he would have served in Polish forces on campaign only against the Russians, never against the Swedish crown, and that this only came about because of Colonel Ruthven's intolerable attitude towards him. General Wrangel did not believe Hay and had him incarcerated pending further investigation, and informed the Swedish chancellor, Axel Oxenstierna, of the matter. Shortly after this Hay was released from prison to attend his young son's funeral in Memel. At the end of November General Wrangel had Hay brought before a military tribunal to answer charges of corresponding with the enemy. The tribunal decided in favour of Hay for two reasons. The relations had been initiated by the enemy, relieving Hay of some of the charges, and Hay had been disadvantaged by his lack of fluency in German, which meant he was liable to have misunderstood the initial proposition. He was therefore not subject to &#145;the usual&#146; punishment (the latter was not specified) and his verdict would be decided by Oxenstierna. Hay was also in the process of obtaining a copy of his response to the Pole, which he believed had been wrongly worded by his scribe.<br>
<br>There does not appear to be any further mention of Hay after this in Swedish sources so it must be presumed that the issue was settled. Hay died in 1639. There is a further reference to Alexander Hay in Denmark in 1643 where his wife and his brother were involved in litigation over his inheritance. This implies that his wife was Danish and had returned to Denmark after her husband's death. Hay's surviving son, Henrik, was born in Stockholm in 1631 and was ennobled in 1689.<br>
