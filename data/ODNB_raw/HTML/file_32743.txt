<span class="headword">Davies,  William John Abbott</span>  (1890&#150;1967), <span class="occ">rugby player</span>, was born on 21 June 1890 in Pembroke, the eldest of the four children and the only son of William George Davies, a shopkeeper, of Pembroke, and his wife, Florence Meyrick. Davies, who was known by the nickname Dave, was educated at Pembroke Dock grammar school, the Royal Naval College, Keyham, and the Royal Naval College, Greenwich. He was a Pembroke dockyard apprentice in 1905 and went to Greenwich College in 1910. He proved himself to be a gifted athlete and games player at Greenwich, but he did not take up rugby football seriously until he was nearly twenty years old. As a boy, he played more soccer than rugby, and he was about to play a game of hockey when he was pressed into service to play a game of rugby instead. His playing career quickly developed with the United Services Club, Portsmouth, and, within three years, he was capped for England as a fly-half.<br>
<br>Davies played a full international season for England in 1913, when he won five caps, before the outbreak of the First World War, in which he served in the Grand Fleet, first in the <i>Iron Duke</i>, and then in the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>. After the war he returned to Admiralty work in Portsmouth as assistant constructor and was appointed OBE in 1919. He resumed playing rugby football for the United Services Club, Portsmouth, and began his club and international half-back partnership with C. A. Kershaw. The two played together for England for four seasons after the First World War, and were so successful that England never lost a match when they were in the team. Indeed, when Davies retired from regular first-class rugby at the end of the 1922&#150;3 season, he had never appeared in a losing England team in the international championship, even though he had won twenty-two caps over a period of eleven years spanning the war. England's only defeat in that time in a match in which Davies played was against South Africa in 1913.<br>
<br>Wavell Wakefield of Kendal, one of England's greatest rugby forwards, who played half his distinguished international career in the same team as Davies, said of him:<blockquote>As &#145;Dave&#146; was born in Wales, I am pretty sure he was qualified to play for Wales, even though I believe his parents came originally from the West Country. However, he chose to play for England instead, and that was a happy decision for us, because no international team can function properly without a sound partnership at half-back, and Kershaw and Davies were wonderfully effective. &hellip; &#145;Dave&#146; was always immaculate. He was always calm, and always appeared to be in control of the situation. He never had a hair out of place, his boots shone, and his playing kit was impeccable. It was an enduring ambition of his opponents, particularly the forwards, to disturb that calm by dumping him unceremoniously on his backside in the mud, but I cannot remember that they ever succeeded! Some of Kershaw's passes were pretty erratic, but &#145;Dave&#146; had such a fantastic pair of hands that he picked them up without any fuss. He was perfectly happy to do so, because the length of &#145;K's&#146; pass enabled him to stand so far away from the forwards that he had great flexibility of operation. &#145;Dave&#146; had the ability to wait for his chance, too, and by doing so, he often lulled the opposition into a false sense of security. He usually made only one break in each half, but when he did so, it was decisive. He and Kershaw were both in the Navy and they were firmly established as the best half-backs in England when I won my first cap in 1920. I have often thought since how much easier it made the game for the rest of us.</blockquote>In 1923 Davies married Margaret Bleecker, daughter of Major Ernest Glanville Waymouth, of the Royal Artillery. They had a son and a daughter, both of whom became medical doctors. Davies's widow, who in 1979 was still living only 2 miles from the Rugby Football Union's ground at Twickenham, recalled that her husband used to practise with C. A. Kershaw almost every day when they were playing for the United Services at Portsmouth. &#145;What they did may have looked easy, but it was born of long and hard practice&#146;, she said. Davies captained the Royal Navy and Hampshire and he became an England selector for three years when he retired. In the year of his retirement (1923) he played in the centenary match at Rugby School, exactly 100 years after William Webb Ellis had supposedly first picked up the ball and run with it, &#145;thus originating the distinctive feature of the Rugby game&#146;. This assertion is open to some doubt, but few would dispute that Davies was one of the best fly-halves who played for England.<br>
<br>When his playing days were over, Davies continued his work at the Admiralty. He was attached to the staff of the commander-in-chief of the Mediterranean Fleet at Malta between 1935 and 1938, and in 1939 was appointed by the Admiralty as chief constructor. He was assistant director of warship production in 1942, superintendent of warship production on the Clyde in 1946, and director of merchant shipbuilding and repairs between 1949 and 1950.<br>
<br>Davies was president of the civil service football club between 1937 and 1966. In 1951 he became a liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Shipwrights. He wrote two books on rugby football: <span class="italic">Rugby Football</span> (1923) and <span class="italic">How to Play Rugby Football</span> (1933). He died at home at 109 Cambridge Road, Teddington, Middlesex, on 26 April 1967.<br>
