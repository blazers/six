<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Skippon,  Philip</span>, appointed Lord Skippon under the protectorate  (<em>d.</em> 1660), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer and politician</span>, was the son of Luke Skippon (<i>d</i>. 1638), a minor gentleman of West Lexham, Norfolk, and his wife, Anne. The Skippons had been in Norfolk since the thirteenth century, but Philip at a young age took military service on the continent. He married Maria Comes (<i>d</i>. 1656) of Frankenthal, Lower Palatinate, on 14 May 1622, and they had eight children, three of whom died in infancy. Since he was married at Frankenthal he was evidently serving in the Palatinate before that date, under Sir Horace Vere. Skippon was wounded during the siege of Breda in 1625, and again at its recapture by the prince of Orange in October 1637. It was at Breda that he first gained his reputation for courage on the battlefield, reportedly with thirty English soldiers driving off 200 Spaniards &#145;at push of pike&#146;  (Walker, 52). He served also under Lord Vere at the sieges of Bois le Duc and Maastricht in 1629.<br>
<br>Having attained the rank of captain in the Dutch service, Skippon returned to England, and went to live at Foulsham, where he had inherited a house and property from an uncle, William Skippon, who died in 1634. In 1639, however, the king recommended him to the Honourable Artillery Company of London for election as their captain. According to Clarendon his experience in the Netherlands had made him disaffected to the Church of England and the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, and for this reason he was &#145;much caressed and trusted&#146; by the king's enemies in England  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 1.509). After Charles's attempted arrest of the five members in January 1642 the House of Commons requested a guard from the City, and the common council appointed Skippon to take command of the City-trained bands, and raise a guard for parliament's defence. He was appointed at the rank of sergeant-major-general, and voted a salary of &pound;300 p.a., having been made a freeman of the City only four days prior to his appointment. By 20 January the Commons had also given him responsibility for the trained bands of Westminster, Southwark, and the suburbs. During the tense month that followed the House of Commons ordered him to send out mounted scouts and patrol-boats to gather intelligence, to blockade the Tower, and to attempt to seize it by surprise. In the latter case the removal of Sir John Byron put an end to the supposed danger. On 4 February 1642 parliament praised Skippon for his &#145;diligence, faithfulness, and sufficiency&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 2.412). In a letter of 13 May the king commanded Skippon to attend him at York. But the two houses denounced the order as &#145;against the law of the land, the liberty of the subject&#146;, and &#145;the privilege of parliament,&#146; and ordered him to continue serving them  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 2.575).<h2>
<a name="Thefirstcivilwar"></a>The first civil war</h2>When the king's forces threatened London after the battle of Edgehill, Skippon was at the head of the trained bands that marched to Turnham Green to defend the metropolis. As he passed before the ranks of his soldiers he spoke words that echoed his own military motto (<i>ora et pugna</i>): &#145;Come my boys, my brave boys, let us pray heartily and fight heartily; I will run the same fortunes and hazards with you; remember the cause is for God, and for the defence of yourselves, your wives and children: come, my honest brave boys, pray heartily and fight heartily, and God will bless us&#146;  (B. Whitelocke, <span class="italic">Memorials of the English Affairs</span>, 4 vols., 1853, 190&#150;1).<br>
<br>The commander-in-chief of the parliamentarian forces, the earl of Essex, quickly discerned Skippon's worth, and on 17 November 1642 snatched him away from the London common council to make him sergeant-major-general of the infantry in his army. In April 1643 Skippon took part in the siege of Reading, in August and September he accompanied Essex on his march to relieve Gloucester, and in September he performed notable service at the first battle of Newbury. The following month he occupied Newport Pagnell for parliament, and in December he took Grafton House in Northamptonshire. In the late summer of 1644 Essex allowed himself and his army to be drawn into a trap in Cornwall. While the earl escaped by sea from Lostwithiel, it was left to Skippon to arrange the best terms he could. He convoked a council of war, and urged his field officers to imitate the horse by endeavouring to cut their way through the enemy's ranks. This time, however, Skippon's persuasive oratory failed him and he was obliged to surrender.<br>
<br>At the second battle of Newbury (27 October 1644) Skippon had his revenge. According to his own account he, Colonel Barclay, and Lord Roberts saw the hottest action, repulsing three violent charges of Prince Rupert's horse. Had night not fallen, opined Skippon, the parliamentarian army would probably have &#145;utterly defeated their whole army&#146;  (Rushworth, 5.723). Yet two weeks later the king returned to relieve Donnington Castle under the noses of the combined armies of Essex, Manchester, and Waller. Obloquy was poured upon the parliamentarian commanders for this episode, and Skippon received his share. In his defence he noted that Essex's whole army had shrivelled to fewer than 2000 men, and that they had had no assistance from Manchester's horse under the command of Oliver Cromwell.<br>
<br>Skippon's disgrace was only temporary, for with the foundation of the New Model Army in early 1645 he was named sergeant-major-general of the infantry under Sir Thomas Fairfax. The delicate task of condensing the remaining foot from Essex's army into three regiments was entrusted to him. In an &#145;excellent, pious, and pithy hortatory speech to all his souldiers&#146;, he pledged, &#145;as I have been with you hitherto, so upon all occasion of service to my God and country, I shall by the help of God, be willing to live and die with you&#146; (J. Vicars, <span class="italic">Magnalia Dei Anglicana, or, England's Parliamentary-Chronicle</span>, 1646, 132; Rushworth, 6.17). His success at this assignment set an example to the others, so that in a short time the balance of Essex's army was merged into the New Model. Skippon took the field with Fairfax in May 1645, and was sent to overrun Borstall House in Buckinghamshire, but he was repulsed with loss.<br>
<br>It was at Naseby that Skippon's work in training the New Model infantry was triumphantly vindicated. Marshalling the parliamentarian foot, he positioned himself on the left centre. In the wake of Prince Rupert's successful charge against the cavalry on the left wing the parliamentarian soldiers of the foot found themselves sorely pressed. The royalist foot under Lord Astley rolled them back until they fell behind the reserves. The reserves, however, remained steady against the onslaught, not only repelling the king's forces but putting them to flight. In the midst of this intense struggle Skippon was dangerously wounded by a shot in the side. Fairfax asked him to leave the field, &#145;but the old man answered, he would not stir so long as a man would stand&#146;, and stayed until the fighting was over  (Rushworth, 6.43). He was lucky to escape with his life. Parliament rushed surgeons and apothecaries to treat him, and then brought him to London for many months of convalescent care, at a cost of several hundred pounds.<br>
<br>Skippon saw no further action during the first civil war, but was rewarded for his contribution at Naseby with the governorship of Bristol. He rejoined Fairfax at the siege of Oxford where, in May 1646 he undertook the construction and management of the forts and entrenchments for the parliamentarian besiegers. Although he had transferred to the New Model Army, Skippon remained on good terms with the earl of Essex and preserved his reputation as a political moderate. When Essex died in September 1646 Skippon had the high honour of acting as an armour bearer at his funeral.<br>
<br>In December 1646 the Scots army was preparing to vacate Newcastle and return to its own country. Fairfax recommended, and parliament agreed, that Skippon should be the new governor of Newcastle. He was given command of the convoy of thirty-six carts that hauled the first instalment &pound;200,000 to pay off the Scots and receive the king from them. For his skill in handling this sensitive transaction Skippon won kudos from the parliamentarian commissioners who were with him.<h2>
<a name="Politicsandthearmy"></a>Politics and the army</h2>On 29 March 1647 the House of Commons summoned him to resume his duties with the field army, and a week later the presbyterian majority led by Holles and Stapleton pressed him to accept the command of the projected expedition to Ireland. He wrote back, &#145;I am so sensible of my own exceeding indisposedness of mind, inability of body, and distractedness of estate and family, that I ingenuously confess myself most unfit, and unable to undertake or undergo such an employment&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 9.139). But the presbyterians pressed it on him as his patriotic duty, and in the end he yielded to them.<br>
<br>On the same day Skippon took his seat in the House of Commons as member for Barnstaple. Three troopers representing eight New Model cavalry regiments who had petitioned against disbandment and the Irish expedition at once approached him to support their cause. On 30 April 1647 he laid a copy of the soldiers' <span class="italic">Apologie</span> before the house. The party of Holles and Stapleton now gave him his most difficult assignment to date: to travel to army headquarters at Saffron Walden with Cromwell, Ireton, and Fleetwood, damp down the flames of discontent, and restore peace within the ranks. Skippon did his best to please his parliamentarian masters. For all his powers of diplomacy, however, he could wring no more from his fellow officers than a commitment to consult their regiments. On 16 May Skippon and the other parliamentarian commissioners gathered at Saffron Walden to hear the results of this consultation. There was sharp conflict between the minority who favoured obedience to parliament, and the majority who advocated defiance. In vain Skippon tried to mediate the &#145;clashings and jarrings&#146;, which he found &#145;a very great pressure to my spiritt&#146;, and to encourage enlistment for Ireland  (C. H. Firth, ed., <span class="italic">The Clarke Papers</span>, CS, 1, 1891, 1.58). Warned by the commissioners that the army was near mutiny, the parliamentarian presbyterians tried to sweeten their offer by repealing the declaration of dislike of 30 March, passing an act indemnifying the soldiers against civil prosecution for crimes committed while in arms, and promising to pay more of their arrears. But these appeasing measures came too late. The army drove out its presbyterian officers, banded together in a solemn engagement not to disband until its grievances were met, and erected a general council to oversee its political affairs. When Skippon and the other commissioners met the army at Thriplow Heath on 10 June to announce parliament's latest concessions they were greeted with cries of &#145;justice, justice&#146;  (Rushworth, 6.556). The response in London to army militancy was an attempted counter-revolution. To further their project of overthrowing the New Model Army the allies of Holles and Stapleton in the City offered Skippon the command of the trained bands. He opted, however, to remain with his comrades in the revolutionary army. This marked the beginning of the politically radical phase of his career. His new alignment was signified by his marching with Sir Thomas Fairfax and the other higher officers at the head of the New Model when they entered London on 6 August.<h2>
<a name="ControllingLondon"></a>Controlling London</h2>Political duelling between the army and the City dragged on inconclusively until the outbreak of the second civil war, when both City fathers and citizens made their sympathy for a royalist peace settlement increasingly clear. Although they had previously requested that Skippon be placed in charge of all the forces in London and the environs, by the end of May 1648 they were petitioning for his ouster in favour of the covertly royalist sheriff Richard Browne. Parliament, however, resisted these importunities, and Skippon remained the linchpin of their control over the metropolis. The centrality of his role was underlined by his appointment, in the same month, to the Derby House committee. This committee, now purged of Scots and presbyterians, devised and executed parliament's military strategy in the second civil war. Skippon's seat on the committee furnished him with the power he needed to take charge of the metropolis during the eight months that culminated in the king's trial and execution. Most of the policies affecting London seem to have emanated from him, and he always appears to have got his own way. Free from the supervision of the City militia committee, he was accountable to parliament and the Derby House committee alone. During the summer he searched out and impounded the horses, arms, and men being recruited by royalist agents. He also directed an intelligence effort to uncover the places where men and <i>mat&eacute;riel</i> were being hidden. Even more important was his recruitment of a thousand horse to keep the City secure, and a further 1500 Londoners, chiefly from the suburbs, to assist Fairfax at the siege of Colchester. His military and political effectiveness was such that the common council of London was moved to petition parliament against him. The core of their complaint was that he was raising servants and apprentices &#145;in a clandestine way at unseasonable times in the night &hellip; tending to the raising of tumults, dividing and breaking of the trained bands and auxiliary forces of this City&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Humble Petition of the Lord Major, Aldermen, and Commons of the City of London &hellip; to the Right Honorable the Lords and Commons in Parliament Assembled</span>, 24 July 1648, 1&#150;2).<br>
<br>While the Lords backed the City, the Commons refused to revoke Skippon's authority. In the midst of this political struggle Skippon discovered a hitherto unsuspected talent and relish for political manoeuvre. Besides mobilizing the Derby House committee, he delivered major speeches in the House of Commons and the London common council. He now discarded the mantle of moderation to reveal an unswerving adherent of the revolution. At the end of June, for example, he addressed the corporation of London, deploring the royalism of the citizenry and calling for recruits to the parliamentarian cause. A few days later in the House of Commons he denounced the City's &#145;malignant&#146; petition for a personal treaty with the king  (<span class="italic">Mercurius Pragmaticus</span>, 4&#150;11 July 1648, sig. P2a.). In November he again addressed the Commons, this speech being on the theme of the soldiers' unpopularity in the streets of London, and the continuing danger from malignants. The following month he promoted the ordinance barring all signers of the petition for a personal treaty with the king from voting in the common council elections. At that same time the men of his own foot regiment in the New Model were billeted in St Paul's Cathedral. They kept themselves warm by tearing down &#145;the carved timber, scaffolds and other materialls&#146; and making great fires on the cathedral floor  (CLRO, repertories of the court of Aldermen, vol. 59, fols. 322&#150;323). More than anyone else it was Skippon who kept a deeply unhappy City in parliament's grip from the outbreak of the second civil war to the time of the king's trial.<h2>
<a name="Religionandwealth"></a>Religion and wealth</h2>Skippon's radicalism, however, had its limits. Appointed to the high court of justice to try the king, he declined to attend any of its meetings; nor did he put his name to the warrant for Charles's execution. During the Commonwealth and protectorate he continued to hold high office despite his initial refusal to swear the engagement. When Cromwell led the invasion of Scotland in the summer of 1650 Skippon was appointed commander-in-chief of all the forces in and about London. He was also elected to the first, second, third, and fifth councils of state under the Commonwealth. He was not appointed to the council created by the army officers after the expulsion of the Rump; nor was he chosen for Barebone's Parliament in 1653, though a group of gathered churches in Norfolk had nominated him. Yet he was a member of each of the two councils appointed by Cromwell. The protector also commissioned him to command the forces in London in February 1655 to suppress the apprehended rising of the royalists. During the reign of the major-generals (1655&#150;6) Skippon was major-general for the London area. In the parliaments of 1654 and 1656 he represented Lyme, but said little in debate. His one significant intervention came in December 1656 when he repeatedly expressed indignation at the blasphemies of James Naylor. &#145;The growth of these things&#146;, he declared, &#145;is more dangerous than the most intestine or foreign enemies. I have often been troubled in my thoughts to think of this toleration&#146;. Again, &#145;if this be liberty, God deliver me from such liberty&#146;; and finally, &#145;I was always of opinion in the Long Parliament, the more liberty the greater mischief&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Thomas Burton</span>, 1.24&#150;5, 50, 218).<br>
<br>Religion was indeed a matter close to Skippon's heart at all times. Judging by his published writings, his regimental flag, his will, and his recorded utterances, he adhered to an uncomplicated, non-sectarian brand of puritanism. He sank substantial sums of his own money into the publication of three books, each several hundred pages long, of pious reflection and devotion. They largely consisted of long strings of biblical quotations linked by commentary. Among his favoured themes were the importance of prayer and sabbath observance, and his conviction that &#145;the scriptures are the infallible truth of God&#146;  (<span class="italic">Christian Centurian's Observations</span>, 1643, 223). He counselled his fellow soldiers not to be intimidated by, but to wear proudly, the labels puritan and roundhead. The emotional power of puritanism for Skippon is reflected in the words he addressed to his troops in early 1644: &#145;I am almost strucken into a sownd [swoon] for joy, and indeed you have so won my heart &hellip; that I &hellip; am willing to spend my dearest blood, in this just cause, and amongst you all&#146;. In response, &#145;the souldiers with loud acclamations cried out that they would lose their lives with him&#146;  (<span class="italic">A most Joyfull Declaration</span>). Bearing witness to his confident providentialism was the flag he designed for his regiment. Beneath the image of a cloud from which an arm extends brandishing an unsheathed sword, it proclaims, &#145;Pray and fight. Jehovah helps us and help us he will&#146; (<i>Ora et pugna. Iuvat et iuvabit Iehovah</i>; BL, Sloane MS 5247, fol. 31<i>v</i>). No sectarian, Skippon supported the Cromwellian church settlement of the 1650s. He was a good friend of the Independent divine Philip Nye, who preached at the wedding of his youngest daughter Susanna in 1655. In the will that he dictated at the end of his life he affirmed his belief in the &#145;unconceivable essence of the trin-une deitie&#146;, original sin, the resurrection of his own body after death, and eternal happiness  (TNA: PRO, wills, PROB 11/300, fol. 257).<br>
<br>Yet piety for Skippon was no bar to self-enrichment. Parliament at various times awarded him &pound;500, &pound;1000, and &pound;200 towards his arrears and expenses. In addition he acquired confiscated land in every category: crown, church, and royalist. In Norfolk he bought bishops' lands, including the bishop of Norwich's palace, valued at over &pound;2500; in Norfolk and Kent he obtained dean and chapter land for &pound;356; while in Cornwall he purchased the crown manor of Bonalva for &pound;719. When the so-called delinquent or royalist estates came onto the market in 1651 Skippon purchased the manors of Bletchley, Whaddon, Eaton, and Winslow in Buckinghamshire, but then sold them off in small parcels to the tenants.<h2>
<a name="Lastyears"></a>Last years</h2>Lord protector Cromwell showed his high respect for Skippon by naming him to the reinstituted House of Lords in 1657. When the protector died Skippon was one of the signatories to the proclamation of Richard as his successor. The following year the restored Rump Parliament reappointed Skippon major-general of the London militia (27 July 1659), and commander-in-chief of all the forces within the weekly bills of mortality (2 August 1659). As the end of his life approached, however, he played no part in the events leading up to the Restoration. His death occurred some time after 26 June 1660, and his will was proved on 25 October of that year. He left his properties in Acton and other parts of Middlesex and Buckinghamshire to Dame Katherine, whom he commended as &#145;a most Christian like, tender and carefull wife and nurse unto mee &hellip;&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/300, fol. 259). This was Katherine Philips, whom he had married after the death of his first wife on 24 January 1656: their marriage settlement was dated 22 August 1657. His Norfolk properties he bequeathed to his son and heir, Philip, and an unspecified sum in cash was granted as a marriage portion to his daughter Mary. He also left generous annuities and cash bequests with a capital value in excess of &pound;156 to the poor in various parishes in Buckinghamshire, Middlesex, and Norfolk. For a largely self-educated man his library was impressive: it included the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and a <span class="roman">Bible</span> concordance, Josephus's <span class="italic">History of the Jews</span>, the works of Joseph Hall (2 vols.), Samuel Purchas's <span class="italic">Purchas his Pilgrimes</span> (5 vols.), Speed's and Holinshed's chronicles, Plutarch's lives, &#145;the Turkish historie&#146;, and Henry Hexham's &#145;two greate vollumes of the mapps of the whole world&#146;  (ibid., fols. 261<i>v</i>, 262<i>v</i>).<br>
