<span class="headword">Magee,  William Kirkpatrick</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>John Eglinton]</span>  (1868&#150;1961), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 16 January 1868 at 41 Eccles Street in north Dublin, the second of three sons and two daughters of the Revd Hamilton Magee (1824&#150;1902) and his wife, Emily Clare, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kirkpatrick (<i>d</i>. 1870). His father, a native of Belfast, after preaching to the famine-stricken peasants in Connaught, was sent by the synod of the Presbyterian church in 1852 to superintend the &#145;Irish mission&#146; for the conversion of Catholics in Dublin. His wife was the daughter of William Kirkpatrick, the senior Presbyterian minister in the city, so W. K. Magee was descended from protestant clergymen on both sides of the family.<br>
<br>At school in Harcourt Street, Magee sat next to W. B. Yeats, cribbed Euclid from him, and was able to compensate the poet by affording him a glance of his own correct translation of Demosthenes. Yeats introduced his schoolfellows to a book that was to lead Magee and his brothers to a half-way house between their father's evangelical protestantism and outright agnosticism: A. P. Sinnett's <span class="italic">Esoteric Buddhism</span>: &#145;I read it, and I believed!&#146; Magee recalled  (J. Eglinton, <span class="italic">Irish Literary Portraits</span>, 1935, 43). Thereafter he became a disciple, if a wayward one, of &#145;AE&#146; (George Russell) in the Dublin Theosophical Society. In 1887 Magee entered Trinity College, Dublin, where he won the vice-chancellor's prizes for verse in 1889 and 1890, and for prose in 1892 and 1893, prizes judged by Professor Edward Dowden (1843&#150;1913). Magee spent some time picking up German in G&ouml;ttingen, with his theosophist friend and fellow poet Charles Weekes. After some years of unemployment, and employment as a schoolteacher in Drogheda, Magee was helped to a post at the National Library of Ireland by Dowden, one of its trustees. Magee's early ambition to be a poet soon faltered in the face of Yeats's success. Their friend Charles Weekes set up a press to bring out the first books of AE and John Eglinton, an Anglophile's pen-name taken from the name of the street on which Magee's parents lived in Kingstown. Magee's <span class="italic">Two Essays on the Remnant</span> (1894) readjusted his father's notions in the light of Wordsworth, Emerson, and Dowden: the &#145;Chosen People&#146; or remnant, became not Jews or Ulster Presbyterians, but young Magee's &#145;brethren in unemployment&#146;, the last genteel Romantics who would withdraw to the suburban woods rather than accept the professions on offer in the city, with its Darwinian struggle for survival  (<span class="italic">Two Essays</span>, 4).<br>
<br>In autumn 1898 Magee parted company with Yeats and Irish cultural nationalism in a newspaper controversy over the Irish Literary Theatre (republished as <span class="italic">Ideals in Ireland</span> in 1901). Ancient Irish myths, Irish folklore, or literature in the Irish language could never for Magee be the proper basis for a great literature, but they could turn out to be a dangerous basis for a political separatist movement, one that would extirpate the conditions that gave life to such as him. In <span class="italic">Pebbles from a Brook</span> (1901), he began to project as the ideal &#145;the Modern Irishman&#146;, by which he meant the university-educated, agnostic-protestant, Anglo-Irish citizen of Europe and a sublimated British empire. Nations he hoped would soon pass away, and leave only individuals behind.<br>
<br>In February 1900 Magee met George Moore, who described him as:<blockquote>a thin small man with dark red hair growing stiffly over a small skull &hellip; the face somewhat shrivelled and thickly freckled. A gnarled, solitary life, I said, lived out in all the discomforts inherent in a bachelor's lodging, a sort of lonely thorn-tree. (Moore, <span class="italic">Ave</span>, 124)</blockquote>(The bachelor lodging was an old coach inn at 5 Cadogan Road where the Tolka flows into Dublin Bay.) At this time, his work at the National Library brought him into contact with the others who would distinguish Irish literature in the period&#151;Oliver St John Gogarty, John M. Synge, and James Joyce. The publication of <span class="italic">Ulysses</span> (especially chapter nine) twenty years later was sharply to recall to the librarian conversations he had had with the young University College graduate about the Shakespeare&#150;Bacon controversy; Magee was then surprised at &#145;the half-kindly and painstaking exactness&#146; with which Joyce &#145;mitigates his cruelty&#146; about &#145;John sturdy Eglinton&#146; &#145;ugling Eglinton&#146; &#145;Steadfast John&#146; and &#145;<i>Eglintonus Chronolologos</i>&#146;  (Joyce, <span class="italic">Ulysses</span>, 193&#150;5). In early 1904 Magee had rejected for publication a first draft of <span class="italic">Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</span> in <span class="italic">Dana</span>, a monthly he co-edited with the socialist Fred Ryan from 1904 to 1905.<br>
<br>The stated aim of <span class="italic">Dana</span> was to open up for discussion ethnic and political issues that had been buried under &#145;an artificial and sentimental unity&#146; by the cultural nationalists. Moore hoped <span class="italic">Dana</span> would be simply &#145;an anti-clerical journal&#146;; &#145;Fleet Street atheism&#146; was Yeats's dismissal; &#145;an amusing disguise of the proselytizing spirit&#146;, Joyce suspected (<span class="italic">Letters &hellip; to Ed. Dujardin</span>, 49; J. Eglinton, <span class="italic">Irish Literary Portraits</span>, 1935, 135). Magee published a selection of his own contributions to <span class="italic">Dana</span> in <span class="italic">Bards and Saints</span> (1906), including &#145;The de-Davisation of Irish literature&#146;, an argument that the writer should not aim consciously to express, much less exalt, nationality  (J. Eglinton, <span class="italic">Bards and Saints</span>, 1906, 39&#150;43). He also needled the Gaelic League by saying, truly enough, &#145;The &#147;Irish&#148; language is indeed a title of courtesy: the ancient language of the Celt is no longer the language of Irish nationality. And in fact it never was&#146;  (ibid., 13). The real problem with Gaelic literature, he judged (suavely begging the question), was that the Catholic Irish had rejected Bishop Bedell's 1685 translation of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> into Gaelic, and thus missed out on that fructifying effect the King James version had had on English literature. Instead, the Irish had to put up with eighteenth-century bards, idlers and bullies for the most part, who wrote only self-serving songs of praise to their hosts.<br>
<br>On his holidays from the National Library, Magee often travelled to Wales and the Lake District, or to Paris, Germany, and Greece (he was fluent in French and German, and well trained in Greek and Latin). In 1913 Magee was considered in place of, or in tandem with W. B. Yeats, for the chair of Edward Dowden at Trinity College; the post went, however, to a more appropriate and ultimately unimportant scholar. Always retentive of his own ideas, Magee became still more costive from 1910 to 1921, although he published <span class="italic">Anglo-Irish Essays</span> in 1917, to remind &#145;Irish Ireland&#146; that the protestant descendant of the English settlers &#145;is still there&#146;, though now as a tolerant, melancholy, sceptical &#145;good European&#146;  (J. Eglinton, <span class="italic">Anglo-Irish Essays</span>, 1917, 3&#150;4). Irish resistance to conscription during the First World War he found &#145;extraordinary and disconcerting&#146; but, looking over the wreckage of O'Connell Street after the Easter 1916 rising, he was forced to acknowledge that the &#145;old Catholic population&#146; now held the title deeds to Irish nationality  (Eglinton, <span class="italic">An Englishman Talks It Out</span>, 3&#150;4). From 1919 to 1920, living a tram journey outside wartorn Dublin at 1 Lakelands Park, Terenure, he continued to make a protestant case for inclusive and European conceptions of citizenship in the <span class="italic">Irish Statesman</span> (edited by George Russell).<br>
<br>In March 1921 Magee began to contribute the &#145;Dublin letter&#146; to the American <span class="italic">Dial</span> (T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound wrote the London and Paris letters). Along with Ernest Boyd's <span class="italic">Ireland's Literary Renaissance</span> (1916), the <span class="italic">Dial</span> letters of Magee (1921&#150;9) make up the first serious critical assessment of twentieth-century Irish writers. His commentary on the &#145;Irish Renascence&#146; insisted on the necessity of biographical and ethnic knowledge to an understanding of literature. Indeed, for Magee in contradistinction to the formalism of Eliot, &#145;the vitality of a literary work is in proportion to the interest it excites in the author&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dial</span>, August 1926, 91). To gain time to write, and weary of answering inquiries from library patrons, Magee took advantage of the Anglo-Irish treaty (1921) by which the British offered early pensions to those civil servants not wishing to continue employment under the free state. On 31 January 1921 he &#145;stepped into freedom &#147;with a sigh&#148;&#146;  (J. Eglinton, <span class="italic">Confidential, or, Take It or Leave It</span>, 1951, 6).<br>
<br>Magee's departure from the library may also have had something to do with a great change he had made in his personal life. After her conversion to protestantism, he had married an assistant at the library, Marie Louise O'Leary, on 6 April 1920. The two stayed on into the civil war until &#145;the ancient archives of Dublin&#146; in the Four Courts were blown up in June 1922&#151;an event he compared with the publication of <span class="italic">Ulysses</span> as &#145;conflagrations of pious illusions of provincial and Catholic Ireland&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dial</span>, August 1923, 180; October 1923, 435). The couple moved in late 1923 to a house by the sea in Prestatyn, north Wales, where they had a boy, their only child; and south to Bournemouth in 1929, where Magee remained until his death, brooding over the literary evidence of the turbulence that drove him from Ireland.<br>
<br>In the 1920s, Magee continued an extensive correspondence with George Moore who from 1911 sought advice from Magee on the proofs of all his books. The much admired correctness of Moore's late style owes a good deal to the former Trinity College prizeman. In recompense, Moore found literary projects for Magee: a two-volume edition of Landor, a translation of Homer into the style of Moore's <span class="italic">Brook Kerith</span>, both unpublished. A few of Moore's proposals, however, did pay off, such as Magee's translation of <span class="italic">George Moore's Letters to Ed. Dujardin</span> (1929) and the selection of <span class="italic">Dial</span> essays published as <span class="italic">Irish Literary Portraits</span> (1935). Magee habitually professed a reluctance to write or, having written, to publish. Moore pictured Magee as the years went by sinking deeper and deeper into his armchair, while he rearranged and dusted his favourite ideas, &#145;conscious of their familiar presences&#146; but undesirous of writing them out, and out of politeness hiding his contempt for the literary activities of his friends  (Moore, <span class="italic">Vale</span>, 177).<br>
<br>In 1929 Magee shied away from Moore's pleas to become his literary executor, much less his biographer; he also turned down an offer to ghost-write a biography of Synge with Synge's uncle. Magee did, however, accept the commission from Macmillan for <span class="italic">A Memoir of AE: George William Russell</span> (1937), less a documentary biography than a personal estimate of his old friend, whose poetry, politics, and mystical philosophy, Magee confessed, awoke in him more doubt than admiration. Indeed, the value of Magee as a critic is not just in his vividly etched memories of men he knew, or in the insight he offers into the sectarian energies of Irish literature, but in an intelligence heightened by <i>ressentiment</i>. One who confessed himself a failure in the preface to his privately issued booklet of poems (1951) uses world standards to assess the successes of his friends: Yeats did not write out of his &#145;best self&#146;, and was &#145;more eidolon than man&#146;; the general impression left by Moore's late fiction was &#145;one of monotony&#146;; Joyce's <span class="italic">Portrait</span> was &#145;pompous and self-conscious&#146; in style&#151;&#145;he is a man of one book&#146;, <span class="italic">Ulysses</span>; and the whole work of the &#145;so-called Irish Literary Renaissance&#146; is &#145;non-canonical&#146; (that is, it should not be admitted to the British canon) (J. Eglinton, <span class="italic">Irish Literary Portraits</span>, 46, 97, 142, 149; J. Eglinton, <span class="italic">Dial</span>, May 1921, 332).<br>
<br>Yet Magee could be profound as well as severe in his appreciation, and he never allowed a badly constructed sentence to leave his desk. Even without a coherent body of convictions, or a talent for invention, Magee wrote periodical essays that count as literature. After 1950 his hand became very shaky as a result of an accident in which he was knocked down by a bicycle, fracturing his wrist. Notwithstanding, up to 1956, the ageing exile continued to send off from Bournemouth his occasional 5-guinea articles to the <span class="italic">Dublin Magazine</span>, all composed in his &#145;gaunt, gnarled, masculine prose&#146;, and many of them sympathetic second thoughts about the work of friends that he had more strictly judged on earlier occasions  (G. Moore, &#145;An Irish essayist&#146;, <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, 4 Nov 1917, 3). The conscience, in the case of Magee, was a highly developed faculty. In 1952 he was awarded an honorary degree by Trinity College. He died of cancer on 9 May 1961 at 36 St Catherine's Road, Southbourne, Bournemouth, a writer of the Irish literary revival who lived to tell its story.<br>
