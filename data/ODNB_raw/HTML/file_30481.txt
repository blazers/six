<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Asquith,  Cyril</span>, Baron Asquith of Bishopstone  (1890&#150;1954), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at Eton House in what used to be John Street, Hampstead, on 5 February 1890. He was the fourth son and the youngest of the five children of the future prime minister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30483/', "Herbert Henry Asquith, later first earl of Oxford and Asquith (1852&#150;1928)")</script>, and his first wife, Helen Melland (<i>c</i>.1855&#150;1891), daughter of a distinguished Manchester physician. The daughter became (Lady) Violet Bonham Carter in 1915 and was created a life peer in 1964 [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31961/', "Carter, (Helen) Violet Bonham")</script>]. Their mother's death in 1891 may have contributed to the shyness which affected Cys, as he was always known to his friends, throughout his life.<br>
<br>From Summer Fields, Oxford, Asquith went as a scholar to Winchester College, where he was a noted football player. Like his father and his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/41100/', "Raymond Asquith")</script> he became a foundation scholar at Balliol College, Oxford, where he obtained a first class in both classical moderations (1911) and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1913). He also won the Hertford, Craven, and Ireland scholarships. He then became an Eldon scholar and was elected a fellow of Magdalen College in 1913. His reserve kept him from taking the same active part in college and university affairs as had his brothers Raymond and Herbert, who had both been presidents of the Oxford Union.<br>
<br>When the First World War began Asquith volunteered in the Queen's Westminster rifles, later being promoted captain. From 1916 to 1918 he was employed in the Ministry of Munitions. On 12 February 1918 he married Anne Stephanie (<i>d</i>. 1964), daughter of Sir Adrian Donald Wilde Pollock, chamberlain of the City of London; they had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>In 1920 Asquith was called to the bar by the Inner Temple and became a pupil in the chambers of W. A. Jowitt, a choice of considerable significance later in Asquith's career. His practice was in the common law courts, but it was not a particularly successful one. From 1925 to 1938 Asquith had time to be assistant reader in common law to the Council of Legal Education. Nevertheless in 1936 he took silk and in 1937 he was made recorder of Salisbury.<br>
<br>In 1938 Asquith was appointed a judge of the King's Bench Division (with the customary knighthood) by the lord chancellor, Lord Maugham. The appointment caused some considerable surprise at the bar, for his practice had been a small one. The lord chief justice, Lord Hewart, in particular, felt that he had not been appropriately consulted regarding the appointment, and he had little regard for Asquith's talents. It is said that for this reason Hewart assigned Asquith to try a number of serious criminal cases at the Old Bailey, where an error would have had an unfortunate effect on Asquith's reputation. It was, however, in the trial of criminal cases that Asquith proved particularly successful, because his skill in explaining the law when charging a jury was of special value. There was some complaint that he was too generous in sentencing the guilty, but this did not bother him.<br>
<br>Fortune smiled again when Asquith's former head of chambers became lord chancellor in the Labour government of 1945&#150;51. In February 1946 Asquith was appointed a lord justice of appeal by Clement Attlee on Jowitt's recommendation, and was made a privy councillor. Jowitt was not unaware of the dangers of the appointment. Writing to Attlee, the prime minister, Jowitt said he regarded Asquith as having &#145;the finest mind &hellip; on the other hand, he has shown a complete neglect of any sense of public duty. His conduct with regard to sittings is so bad that I am deeply concerned about it&#146;. He was using the equal pay committee as an excuse for not working:<blockquote>If he were to be appointed a member of the Court of Appeal, he would be one of a team, and under the tutelage of the Master of the Rolls he might be made to do some work &hellip; I recognise that his promotion would be regarded by the Bench and Bar as a reward for singularly unmeritorious services. On the other hand, I still believe he has the best brain of any of the King's Bench judges &hellip; I should be thankful to get rid of him from the King's Bench Division, as would many, many of the senior judges. (26 Jan 1946, Stevens, <span class="italic">Independence</span>, 83)</blockquote>What is now called the Peter Principle was very much in evidence.At the same time, once in the Court of Appeal Asquith's knowledge of the law, coupled with his literary interests, gave a certain distinction to his judgments which were otherwise conventional, if not conservative. Perhaps the most frequently quoted judgments are <i>Victoria Laundry (Windsor) Ltd v. Newman Industries Ltd</i> (1949), in which he restated the law concerning the measure of damages on breach of contract; <i>Thurogood v. Van Den Berghs &amp; Jurgens</i> (1951), on the measure of damages in tort; and <i>Candler v. Crane, Christmas &amp; Co.</i> (1951), in which he responded to Lord Denning's remark that &#145;there were the timorous souls who were fearful of allowing a new cause of action&#146; by saying &#145;If this relegates me to the company of timorous souls, I must face that consequence with such fortitude as I can command&#146;.<br>
<br>Certainly Asquith's contributions were of a conservative bent; and he showed little gratitude to Jowitt for his scarcely justified promotion. In April 1946 Asquith wrote to Jowitt from the straitened environment of Brooks's to complain about his salary. &#145;The only way in which Queen's Bench Division judges have been able to balance their budgets during the War has been by going circuit&#146;. (The judges received a tax-free allowance of &pound;7 10<i>s</i>. daily on circuit.) Asquith complained: &#145;I've lived from hand to mouth during the War&#146;  (3 April 1946, Stevens, <span class="italic">Independence</span>, 120). He had sold his King's Bench robes but could not afford to buy Court of Appeal ones. He suggested that instead of &pound;5000 p.a. the appropriate salary for a judge should be &pound;70,000. Jowitt was unmoved.<br>
<br>In April 1951 Asquith became a lord of appeal in ordinary, with a life peerage, again on Jowitt's recommendation. It was remarked that &#145;the higher he went the better he became&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>); but equally the sentiment might be used for suggesting that success at the bar is not a <i>sine qua non</i> for success in the appeal courts, particularly if one has the right contacts. As a law lord he served for only three years before he died, but during that time he gave a number of judgments. In <i>Bank of New South Wales v. Laing</i> (1954) he delivered the decision of the judicial committee of the privy council on a difficult procedural point concerning the onus of proof in an <i>indebitatus assumpsit</i> count. His two dissenting judgments in the House of Lords, <i>King v. King</i> (1953) and <i>Stapley v. Gypsum Mines Ltd</i> (1953), illustrate the clarity of his style.<br>
<br>Certainly Asquith understood the workings of the judicial process. He put it elegantly in <i>Chapman v. Chapman</i> (1954):<blockquote>Nor, speaking more generally, does English jurisprudence start from a broad principle and decide cases in accordance with its logical implications. It starts with a clean slate, scored over, in course of time, with ad hoc decisions. General rules are arrived at inductively, from the collation and comparison of these decisions: the rules do not pre-exist them.</blockquote>At the same time, perhaps because of his nature and his natural conservatism, he had virtually no impact in the Lords. His decisions suggested that he had little sympathy with injured workmen (such as <i>Parvin v. Merton Mach. Co.</i>, 1952) and legislatively he advocated capital and corporal punishment. It was an undistinguished period in the House of Lords as a final court of appeal; Asquith did nothing to ameliorate it.<br>
<br>The most remarkable moment in Asquith's life came in October 1951 when Winston Churchill offered him the lord chancellorship. He refused it and Asquith himself never referred to it again. The offer was unexpected, since Asquith had no political experience which would have aided him in presiding in the House of Lords as a legislative body. Perhaps Churchill's choice was influenced in part by the fact that Asquith was the son of the prime minister under whom he had first served in the cabinet; it may also have been due in part to the fact that they were fellow members of The Other Club, where they often met at dinner, and where Churchill had been attracted by Asquith. Asquith's critics assumed that his reluctance sprang, at least in part, from the opprobrium he might encounter in the light of his undistinguished&#151;although extraordinarily lucky&#151;career at the bar and on the bench. His friends insisted he was far too high-minded to accept a post which he felt he was not strong enough physically to perform adequately. In a letter to his son-in-law John Stephenson, Asquith insisted that Churchill &#145;mustn't be saddled with a lame duck on the Woolsack&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Churchill then turned to another law lord, whom he had never met, Gavin Simonds, and made him lord chancellor.<br>
<br>Apart from his judicial career Asquith held a number of appointments. He was a member of the lord chancellor's Law Revision Committee, he was the High Court judge attached to the General Claims Tribunal (1939), and he was chairman for six months in 1940 of the advisory committee on aliens. He was chairman of the commission on higher education in the colonies, 1943&#150;4, and chairman of the royal commission on equal pay for equal work, 1944&#150;6.<br>
<br>Asquith must have been one of the major contributors to <span class="italic">The Times</span> in the number of letters he wrote to it and in the unsigned leaders. They varied from extreme seriousness to the humorous. Most of the leaders concerned possible reforms in the law and dealt with such subjects as the cost of litigation, the legal machine, and the law relating to married women.<br>
<br>Asquith's publications included <span class="italic">Trade Union Law for Laymen</span> (1927), which achieved a popular success; <span class="italic">Versions from &#145;A Shropshire Lad&#146;</span> (1930), a translation into Latin of poems by A. E. Housman which was less popular but received the approval of his former Balliol tutor, Cyril Bailey; and in 1932 with J. A. Spender the life of his father. About half the first volume, which deals with his father's early and family life, was written by Asquith, and a smaller part of the second volume; they would probably have been more successful if he had written the whole of them.<br>
<br>Asquith's conversation and his writings have been described as showing &#145;the same deliberation, dry humour and careful choice of words that marked his father's style&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Cyril Asquith was himself an illustration of his father's famous remark concerning &#145;the effortless superiority of Balliol men&#146;. Like his father he was elected an honorary fellow of the college. He died in London on 24 August 1954.<br>
