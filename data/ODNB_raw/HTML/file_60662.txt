<span class="headword">Devas <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Macnamara; <em>other married name </em>Shephard]</span>,  Nicolette</span>  (1911&#150;1987), <span class="occ">author and artist</span>, was born on 1 February 1911 in London. She was the eldest of the four children of Francis Macnamara (1884&#150;1946), an Irish eccentric, poet, and landowner, of Ennistymon House, co. Clare, and his wife, Mary Yvonne Majolier (1886&#150;1973), who was of French and Anglo-Irish extraction. Her youngest sister became <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55871/', "Caitlin Thomas (1913&#150;1994)")</script> upon her marriage to Dylan Thomas (1914&#150;1953). When Nicolette was five Macnamara, committed to his freethinking ideas, deserted his family, who then for several years moved as refugees from one household to another. But primarily the lives of the Macnamaras became united with the large and unorthodox household of the painter Augustus John and his mistress Dorelia McNeil. In 1917 they were sharing the same house as the John family, Alderney Manor in Dorset. Then followed years of wandering from one place to another, and for a few years with grandmother Majolier in France. In 1923 Yvonne Majolier bought the family a home of their own, New Inn House at Blashford on the borders of the New Forest, only 7 miles from where the John family settled at Fryern Court near Fordingbridge in Hampshire. Later Nicolette was to give an account of her extraordinary childhood in her classic biography, <span class="italic">Two Flamboyant Fathers</span> (1966). This highly unconventional upbringing meant that she had almost no formal education and could not read until she was twelve. However, she learned other things: an appreciation of painting and a great love of the outdoor world, which led to an intimate knowledge of natural history. She had a particular interest in and love of birds, an interest which was to develop throughout her life. For a short time she attended schools in France, first the <i>lyc&eacute;e</i> in Cannes, then in Paris, where she began her art training.<br>
<br>At the age of sixteen Nicolette went to the Slade School of Fine Art, where she studied under Henry Tonks but refused to conform to his stringent ideas on art. She became part of a group of students which included William Coldstream, Rodrigo Moynihan, Elinor Bellingham-Smith, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51316/', "Rupert Norman Shephard (1909&#150;1992)")</script>, who was later to become her second husband. At the Slade she met, and married on 25 June 1931, the portrait painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40912/', "(Thomas) Anthony Devas (1911&#150;1958)")</script>. She was now on the way to making a successful career as a painter herself, exhibiting her work at the New English Art Club, the Royal Academy, and the London Group, and at a one-woman show at the Storran Gallery. But the outbreak of war in 1939, and her family of three children, made the pursuit of her career increasingly difficult. She also found it almost impossible for two artists to work happily under the same roof, so it was a sensible decision to turn her creative energies to writing. She published four successful novels, <span class="italic">Bonfire</span> (1958), <span class="italic">Nightwatch</span> (1961), <span class="italic">Black Eggs</span> (1970), and <span class="italic">Pegeen Crybaby</span> (1986; illustrated by Shephard), and also a life of her mother's family, <span class="italic">Susanna's Nightingales</span> (1978). <span class="italic">Bonfire</span> was read for the publishers by C. Day Lewis, who wrote, &#145;The untidiest, worst spelt manuscript I have ever read. <span class="smallcap">PUBLISH</span>&#146;. It was also reviewed in the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> by John Betjeman, who called it &#145;a refreshing and bold experiment&#146;.<br>
<br>Throughout her life Nicolette Devas never lost her love of nature, and ornithology became a major interest and study. For some years she worked in the Natural History Museum sorting birds' eggs and studying British and exotic birds in their cases. She became friends with the ornithologist James Fisher, and painted pictures of birds in the London Zoo.<br>
<br>Anthony Devas died in 1958; seven years later, on 24 April 1965, Nicolette Devas married the artist Rupert Shephard, her friend from her Slade days. He was a widower, and the two families (Rupert Shephard also had three children) joined up in a large house at 68 Limerston Street in Chelsea. This house became a centre for the meeting of artists and writers. Nicolette Devas had a great gift for friendship and conversation, and all her life she was an exceptionally beautiful and attractive woman, and was always ready to help and encourage any friend who might be going through a difficult time. She was an active member of the International Association of Poets, Playwrights, Editors, Essayists, and Novelists (PEN) and for many years she served on the executive committee, and travelled abroad to many international PEN conferences.<br>
<br>Nicolette Devas's last years were clouded by Alzheimer's disease. She died in London on 10 May 1987. A memorial service was held for her on 18 May at Chelsea Old Church, London, and she was buried on the 19th at the church of St Mary and All Saints at Ellingham, near Ringwood in Hampshire. Shortly after her death a very successful one-woman show of her work was held at the gallery of Sally Hunter Fine Art (July 1987).<br>
