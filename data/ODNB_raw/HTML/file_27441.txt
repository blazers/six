<span class="headword">Tierney, Sir  Matthew John</span>, first baronet  (1776&#150;1845), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born on 24 November 1776 at Ballyscandland, co. Limerick, the eldest son of John Tierney and his wife, Mary, daughter of James Gleeson of Rathkinnon, co. Limerick. Tierney's early education is unknown, but he received his medical training at Guy's and St Thomas's hospitals in London. He then briefly practised as a surgeon to the South Gloucester regiment of militia. In 1799 he matriculated at the Edinburgh University medical school, but graduated MD from Glasgow University in 1802 with a thesis on vaccination. Tierney set up in practice again, this time in Brighton. In 1806 he became a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians. Two years later, on 8 October 1808, he married Harriet Mary, daughter of Henry Jones of Bloomsbury Square. The couple had no children.<br>
<br>From this rather lowly beginning Tierney rose through patronage to become a royal physician. Early in his career he became acquainted with the earl of Berkeley, to whom he owed his appointment to the militia. Either through the influence of the earl, his own skill, or by chance (all are suggested by his biographers) Tierney was introduced to the prince of Wales's household at Brighton, and he steadily climbed up the hierarchy of royal appointments. In 1809 he was appointed physician-extraordinary to the prince of Wales, in 1816 he became physician-in-ordinary to the prince regent, and he continued to hold the post on the prince's accession to the throne. He held the same appointment under William IV. Tierney was valued for his medical skills. When the prince regent was struck down with a fever before his father's funeral, Tierney famously contradicted the advice of all the other royal practitioners and recommended bleeding&#151;a therapy which proved successful. In recognition of his royal service Tierney was created a baronet on 3 October 1818 and a knight commander of the Royal Guelphic Order of Hanover on 7 May 1831. On 5 June 1834 he was awarded a second patent of baronetcy with the remainder passing to his younger brother, Edward Tierney. In keeping with his new standing Tierney became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in July 1836.<br>
<br>Tierney was an early and lifelong supporter of vaccination. Through his connections with the earl of Berkeley he met Edward Jenner in 1798&#151;the year in which Jenner published his discovery of vaccination&#151;and became a convert to the new practice. While at Edinburgh University he persuaded James Gregory, one of his lecturers, of the merits of the procedure and was subsequently invited to vaccinate his son. Tierney drew up plans for the Royal Sussex Jennerian Institution, a charity to offer free vaccination to the poor in the principal towns of the county, and he wrote a pamphlet celebrating its launch. This was reprinted in <span class="italic">Observations on Variola vaccina or Cow-Pock</span> (1845), a brief account of his early experience of vaccination. Tierney died at his home on the Pavilion Parade, Brighton, on 28 October 1845, of an attack of gout.<br>
