<span class="headword">&AElig;thelberht</span> <span class="st"> [St &AElig;thelberht, Ethelbert]</span>  (779/80&#150;794), <span class="occ">king of the East Angles</span>, was the son of King &AElig;thelred of the East Angles and was executed in 794 by order of King Offa of Mercia, as a result of which he came to be regarded as a royal martyr. His cult, which probably started life as a focus for resistance to Offa's oppressive rule, flourished in medieval England: sixteen churches were dedicated to him, including Hereford Cathedral, and for a time Hereford was second only to Canterbury as a magnet for English pilgrims. His feast day was 20 March. Beyond this little can be said for certain about one of the more obscure of Anglo-Saxon kings. The only pre-conquest reference to &AElig;thelberht is found in the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span>, whose compiler records that &#145;Offa, king of the Mercians, had &AElig;thelberht beheaded&#146;  (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, s.a. 792). However, the paucity of pre-conquest source material is offset by a relative glut of post-conquest information, which affords the opportunity to reconstruct some kind of context for the assassination.<br>
<br>Three separate lives of St &AElig;thelberht were written in the twelfth century by authors with connections to Hereford Cathedral (including Gerald of Wales and Osbert de Clare); and in the thirteenth century the story was told by the St Albans monks Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris. It would seem that &AElig;thelberht was the son of King &AElig;thelred and his wife, Queen Leofruna. The history of Offa's dealings with the East Anglian kings before 794 is extremely hazy, but the fact that coins bearing his name were minted in East Anglia in the early 790s suggests that he exercised some sort of overlordship in that region in the time of &AElig;thelred and &AElig;thelberht. They may have been native East Angles whose position as sub-kings was imposed upon them after military defeat by the Mercians, or they may have been Mercian appointees, perhaps even with Mercian royal blood: Matthew Paris and Gerald of Wales both claimed that &AElig;thelberht ruled the East Angles because he was Offa's kinsman.<br>
<br>The post-conquest sources are agreed that &AElig;thelberht succeeded his father as a young man. In the Hereford version of events he was fourteen years old when he came to the throne, which, given that he seems to have been murdered soon afterwards, gives a date of 779 or 780 for his birth. The compiler of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> does not explain why Offa felt the need to dispose of the young &AElig;thelberht, but it was presumably because he was perceived as some kind of threat. The St Albans view that Offa was blameless and that the crime was perpetrated by his evil consort, Cynethryth (or Cwenthryth), can be written off as special pleading by monastic authors who were not only prejudiced against women, especially those in positions of power, but also eager to clear the name of their founder and benefactor, Offa, who had established and endowed St Albans Abbey in 793. Nevertheless Cynethryth may have had <i>some</i> involvement in the affair. The Hereford lives make her co-conspirator with Offa, which is by no means unlikely, as there is evidence that she was an important political figure in her own right, upon whom Offa relied for counsel. There are signs that &AElig;thelberht stood in some way for East Anglian independence from Mercia, for he began to issue coins bearing his own name, a luxury which Offa allowed to none of his dependent kings. It is feasible, therefore, that his execution represents an attempt by Offa to stop an incipient rebellion in its tracks by depriving the East Angles of their figurehead, who died heirless. Alternatively, if Mercian royal blood flowed in &AElig;thelberht's veins, then this would have weighed heavily against him, for Offa was eager to secure the uncontested succession of his son Ecgfrith as king of Mercia, and, as his contemporary Alcuin observed, he pursued a ruthless policy of eliminating possible rivals, chief among whom would have been a sub-king with Mercian royal blood.<br>
<br>The sources differ widely on the method of &AElig;thelberht's assassination. In Matthew Paris's version he sits on a booby-trapped chair which falls down into a pit, where he is smothered with drapes and then beheaded; while Gerald of Wales describes how he was ambushed and decapitated by an assassin named Gwinbert, who delivered his head to Offa. The fact that &AElig;thelberht lost his head in all versions of the story strengthens the possibility that he was perceived by Offa as an obstacle to Ecgfrith's succession, since decapitation was the traditional punishment in literature and in fact for usurpers or would-be usurpers. There is also consensus among the post-conquest sources that the occasion of &AElig;thelberht's murder was a visit to Offa's court to receive the hand of his daughter, who is named by various authors as &AElig;lfthryth, &AElig;lfrida, Etheldritha, and &AElig;lffl&aelig;da. Thus it would seem that Offa used his daughter as bait with which to draw &AElig;thelberht out of East Anglia so that he could be disposed of more easily. The Hereford branch of the tradition maintained that when &AElig;thelberht came to visit him Offa was holding court near Hereford, at the royal estate of Sutton, and there is the same implication in the pages of the St Albans writers, who agree that the martyr's relics were conveyed to Hereford Cathedral after his murder, where they worked various miracles in later times.<br>
