<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dilke <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Strong; <em>other married name </em>Pattison]</span>,  Emilia Francis</span>, Lady Dilke  (1840&#150;1904), <span class="occ">art historian and trade unionist</span>, was born on 2 September 1840 in Ilfracombe, Devon, the fourth of the six children of Henry Strong (1794&#150;1876) and his wife, Emily Weedon (<i>d</i>. 1879?). Little is known of her mother, who was from Oxford, but her paternal family, of which she wrote proudly in &#145;Samuel Strong and the Georgian loyalists&#146; (1899), were American colonists, and her father was a retired Indian army officer and amateur artist, who became manager of the London and County Bank in Oxford in 1841. The young Francis Strong (who preferred to go by her second, masculine name) was educated at home in Iffley by Miss Bowdich, who gave her an excellent grounding in languages, including French, German, Latin, and Greek. She grew up in a household in which cultural pursuits were highly valued, and her father was active in local art circles at a time when Oxford was an important centre of intellectual and artistic life. In her youth, through her family's friendship with Henry and Sarah Acland and Thomas and Martha Combe, she came into contact with leading figures in the Victorian art world, such as John Ruskin, John Everett Millais, and William Holman Hunt (who proposed to her in 1859, but was rejected).<br>
<br>It was Ruskin who, having seen some of her drawings, encouraged Francis Strong to go to London in 1858 and study at the Government School of Design in South Kensington, where she became a regular attendant in March 1859 and was a student for two years. As a public institution which offered training in art, design, and industrial application to an inclusive body of students, and raised consciousness about the relations between art, government, political and economic institutions, and the public sphere, the South Kensington school had a formative influence on her later scholarship as an art historian. She was a good student, with a special interest in anatomical drawing. As a woman, she was denied access to formal life-drawing classes at South Kensington, but in 1859, defying convention, she took private tuition from William Mulready in drawing from the nude. Like a number of other female artists of the day, she protested against the exclusion of women from what was considered to be the most prestigious area of art education. She later withdrew an offer to found a scholarship for female art students at the Royal Academy Schools when the authorities refused to concede to her condition that the women's education include drawing from the nude.<br>
<br>After completing her art education, Strong returned to Oxford, where she became engaged to the 48-year-old scholar <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21585/', "Mark Pattison (1813&#150;1884)")</script>, rector of Lincoln College, in June 1861, and married him at Iffley church on 10 September 1861. Despite her intellectual marginalization as a woman in Oxford, Francis Pattison entered upon a life of serious scholarship, focusing upon the study of French cultural history and art. At the same time she cut a striking figure socially, developing an artistic and intellectual circle more in keeping with the salons of seventeenth-century France&#151;upon which she was establishing herself as an authority&#151;than with the stuffy masculine culture of Oxford college life. According to contemporary accounts, and on the evidence of the early portrait of Mrs Pattison painted by her friend Pauline, Lady Trevelyan, in 1864, her dress and general demeanour were particularly stylish and picturesque. The Pattisons' marriage was famously unhappy, allegedly the model for the <i>m&eacute;salliances</i> of Dorothea Brooke and Edward Casaubon in George Eliot's <span class="italic">Middlemarch</span> (1871&#150;2) and of Belinda and Professor Forth in Rhoda Broughton's <span class="italic">Belinda</span> (1883), and a possible source for Robert Browning's poem &#145;Bad Dreams&#146; in <span class="italic">Asolando</span> (1889). Its miseries, and her own ill health, led Pattison to spend increasing periods of time in France, where she was able to pursue her research interests with greater resources and more independence.<br>
<br>Pattison began writing reviews, articles, and notes on art for the periodical press from the mid-1860s, and became the salaried art editor of <span class="italic">The Academy</span> from 1873 to 1883. It was in this context that she began to carve out her own scholarly and critical principles, differentiating her approach to art equally from the moral aesthetic of her former mentor, Ruskin, and the ahistorical impressionism of Walter Pater. She offered a critique of the former in her article &#145;Art and morality&#146; (<span class="italic">Westminster Review</span>, 35, January 1869) and in her signed review of his <span class="italic">Lectures on Art</span> and <span class="italic">Catalogue of Examples</span> (<span class="italic">The Academy</span>, 1870), and reviewed the latter's <span class="italic">Studies in the History of the Renaissance</span> in the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span> in April 1873. Throughout her marriage to Mark Pattison, when not following the widespread convention of journalistic anonymity, she published under the signature E. F. S. Pattison. Her second husband attributed her insertion of the initial &#145;S.&#146;, standing for her family name Strong, to &#145;her wish for some recognition of the independent existence of the woman, and in some resistance to the old English doctrine of complete merger in the husband&#146;  (Dilke, 19).<br>
<br>It was under this name that Pattison published her first book, <span class="italic">The Renaissance of Art in France</span> (1879), in which the hallmarks of her scholarship are already evident: her meticulous archival research into primary and unpublished sources; her interest in the institutional organization of the arts, and in the political, economic, and social conditions under which they were produced; and her deep conviction of the profound connectedness of the works of decoration, furniture, painting, engraving, sculpture, and architecture of a period. This was followed in 1882 by a short biography of Sir Frederic Leighton, in the Dumas series <span class="roman">Illustrated Biographies of Modern Artists</span>, and in 1884 by another major study, <span class="italic">Claude Lorrain: sa vie et ses &#339;uvres</span>, published in French.<br>
<br>At the same time as she was building a formidable reputation as a historian and critic of art, Pattison was active in a quite different field. Her commitment to social reform, and in particular to improving the working conditions of women, led to her involvement, from its inception, in the Women's Trade Union League, founded as the Women's Protective and Provident League by Emma Smith Paterson in 1874. In 1886, on Paterson's death, she herself became president until her death, when she was mourned in the league's journal as &#145;one &hellip; fitted, as few human beings &hellip; to fill the post of leader in a crusade against the tyranny of social tradition and the callousness of social indifference&#146;  (<span class="italic">Women's Trade Union Review</span>, Jan 1905, 1). In 1878 she was elected to membership of the Radical Club, one of only five women; there she presented a paper entitled &#145;The conditions which should determine the wages of female labour&#146;  (Dilke, 54). The management and expansion of women's trade unions, and in particular her championing of the cause of unskilled workers in dangerous trades, became lifelong concerns.<br>
<br>In the 1870s Francis Pattison renewed her friendship with the liberal politician and periodical proprietor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32824/', "Sir Charles Wentworth Dilke, second baronet (1843&#150;1911)")</script>, whom she had first met in 1858 as a fellow student at South Kensington. They shared interests in radical politics and in France and its art, and from mid-1875 they were in close correspondence. Their marriage, which took place in Chelsea on 3 October 1885, a year after Mark Pattison's death, although initially shadowed by the scandal surrounding the naming of Charles Dilke as co-respondent in a divorce case, appears to have been happy. Thenceforward she was known by and published under the name Emilia Dilke. Portraits of her from this period&#151;as Francis Strong Pattison in 1882 by Charles Camino, and as Emilia Dilke in 1887 by Hubert von Herkomer&#151;depict a poised and elegant woman with a forthright gaze. At the same time she extended her activities for the women's trade union movement, speaking at public meetings across the country, regularly attending and addressing the annual Trades Union Congress as part of her promotion of male&#150;female working-class co-operation, and writing for the league's papers and the general press. She also published a further series of important studies of French art. In <span class="italic">Art in the Modern State</span> (1888), on seventeenth-century French art, and in her encyclopaedic four-volume study of eighteenth-century French art (1899&#150;1902) she sought &#145;to trace the action of those social laws under the pressure of which the arts take shape&#146;  (<span class="italic">French Engravers and Draughtsmen of the Eighteenth Century</span> 1902, v), drawing attention to the political determinants of art and the economics of production and of the modern art market. In these volumes she is concerned with the role of women in the arts as both producers and subjects, drawing parallels between the social and institutional constraints upon earlier and contemporary female artists. She also published two volumes of allegorical stories, <span class="italic">The Shrine of Death and Other Stories</span> (1886) and <span class="italic">The Shrine of Love and Other Stories</span> (1891), and a collection entitled <span class="italic">The Book of the Spiritual Life</span> was published posthumously in 1905.<br>
<br>Dilke died following a brief illness on 24 October 1904 at her Surrey house, Pyrford Rough near Woking. Her remains were cremated at Golders Green after a funeral service at Holy Trinity Church, Sloane Square, London. She had no children. Despite recurring ill health, she had been a woman of prodigious energy which she had directed into a number of channels in the belief that<blockquote>Ordinary life widens the horizon for men. Women are walled in behind social conventions. If they climb over, they lose more than they gain. It is therefore necessary to accept the situation as nature and society have made it, and to try to create for one's self a position from which on peut dominer ce qu'on ne peut pas franchir. (Dilke, 55)</blockquote>
