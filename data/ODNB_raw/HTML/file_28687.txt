<span class="headword">Ward,  James <span class="st"> [Jem]</span></span>  (1800&#150;1884), <span class="occ">pugilist and artist</span>, was born near Ratcliffe Highway (now the Highway), London, the eldest son of a butcher, later a ballast-heaver, stated as being either Nathaniel or Nicholas Ward. His date of birth has been variously given as 14, 25, or 26 December 1800. From an early age he displayed talent as a boxer and he later recalled his first fight as being against George Robinson when seven months short of sixteen years of age  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 11 Nov 1881). He soon became a leading light in a sparring club at Bromley New Town to which all budding East End of London aspirants to &#145;milling&#146; fame repaired. At the time he was pursuing the occupation of coal-whipper, &#145;unloading sea-borne coals in the Pool [of London]&#146;, hence his cognomen of the Black Diamond  (<span class="italic">Morning Advertiser</span>, 4 April 1884). His formal introduction to the Fives Court, St Martin's Street, then the haunt of the fancy, took place on 22 January 1822 and, in sparring with Joe Spencer, he showed great promise.<br>
<br>Ward's first appearance in the field was at Moulsey Hurst, Surrey, on 12 June of the same year, when he beat Dick Acton in six rounds. On 10 September following he easily overcame Young Burke of Woolwich and next met Bill Abbott on 22 October. To please his backer, Ward allowed his opponent to win but, having confessed his duplicity, all bets were declared off. On 4 February 1823, at Wimbledon Common, he defeated Ned Baldwin, known as Whiteheaded Bob, in twenty rounds lasting nineteen minutes. During a sparring tour of the provinces he was involved in a further act of dishonesty. At the conclusion of Bath races on 4 July he beat Rickens, a native of the city, who was tricked into the match, being unaware of Ward's true identity. Ward then travelled to Southampton, where, on 20 August, after the races, he comfortably defeated the much inferior Johnson. Back in London he was matched to fight Josh Hudson for &pound;100 a side at Moulsey Hurst on 11 November 1823 but was forced to concede to his resolute opponent. At Colnbrook, near Slough, on 21 June 1824, he conquered the Birmingham Youth, Phil Sampson, in fifty minutes. The two met again at Perry Lodge, 4 miles from Stony Stratford, on 28 December 1824. From the first Sampson never had much chance of victory and was vanquished in twenty-seven rounds.<br>
<br>Ward was now at the height of his fame and, disputing Tom Cannon's self-elected right to the title of champion of England, accepted the latter's open challenge for &pound;1000  (<span class="italic">Pierce Egan's Life in London</span>, 20 Feb 1825). The encounter took place near Warwick on 19 July 1825 in the presence of an immense number of persons of varying character and class. Cannon fell insensible in the tenth round, his bustling style not being suited to the excessive heat of the day. Ward was proclaimed the winner and on 22 July, at the Fives Court, was presented with a belt bearing the inscription &#145;British Champion&#146;. He remained without a match until 2 January 1827, when he fought Peter Crawley at Royston Heath, near Cambridge, and was beaten in a manly battle occupying eleven rounds. Crawley retired two days later and Ward immediately laid claim to the title. His next encounter was with Jack Carter, on 27 May 1828, at Shepperton Range, Middlesex. Youth and science triumphed over age and Carter was defeated in thirty-two minutes.<br>
<br>On 10 March 1829 Ward was due to meet the Irishman Simon Byrne for the championship at Leicester but at the last minute declined to enter the ring. His conduct was greatly condemned, his backers and friends abandoned him, and the Fair Play Club refused to allow him to fight under their jurisdiction. For two years he stayed inactive before meeting Byrne on 12 July 1831 at Willeycott, near Stratford upon Avon. The contest, for &pound;200 a side, lasted one hour and seventeen minutes and, with the defeat of the Irishman, Ward's final battle for the championship of England ended. On the following Thursday he was presented with a second champion's belt at Reuben Marten's Tennis and Fives Court, Peter Street, Soho. When the stake money was given up the next day, Ward offered to make a match with any man in England for a sum from &pound;100 to &pound;500, but the challenge was not accepted.<br>
<br>In a letter to the editor of <span class="italic">Bell's Life in London</span>, written on 24 January 1832 (printed on 29 January), Ward stated that he was retiring from the ring and had commenced trading as a publican at The Belt, Whitechapel, Liverpool. On 8 September 1831 he had married Eliza, daughter of former pugilist George Cooper; their only child, Eleanor, was born on 1 September 1832. A pupil of the composer and conductor Sir Julius Benedict, Eleanor Ward subsequently earned public acclaim as an accomplished pianist. Ward himself later carried on business at The Star inn and then the York Hotel, both in Williamson Square, before moving to London in 1853. There he was host of various hostelries including The Rose, 96 Jermyn Street; the Three Tuns (renamed the Champion Stores), 429 Oxford Street; the King's Arms, Whitechapel Road; The George, Ratcliffe Highway; the Sir John Falstaff, Brydges Street (now Catherine Street); and the Harlequin tavern, 69 Drury Lane.<br>
<br>In conjunction with his profession as a publican, Ward also became an artist, creating numerous landscapes and other pieces of unquestionable merit. His paintings were displayed at more than one of the Liverpool exhibitions and earned praise from the press of the time. Perhaps his best-known work was <span class="italic">The Sayers and Heenan Fight</span>, a very large picture containing 270 portraits, produced in 1860. He was also a talented musician, playing the violin, flute, flageolet, piano, and guitar, besides being a competent pigeon-shooter and quoits player. His manners were mild and unassuming, and in his fighting prime he was described by a friend as &#145;a man only in the ring, a child out of it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Weekly Dispatch</span>, 4 July 1824). This may account for his occasionally being led astray during his pugilistic career, something that he greatly regretted in later life.<br>
<br>Ward's interest in painting and music did little to encourage his success as a sporting publican and, at length, after several failures in business, he retired to the Licensed Victuallers' Asylum in the Old Kent Road. There, well past his eightieth birthday, he could still be found actively producing saleable landscapes in both watercolour and oils. He died at the asylum on 2 April 1884 and was buried six days later at Nunhead cemetery in the same grave where already reposed his wife and grandson.<br>
<br>Nicholas Ward (1813&#150;1850), younger brother of James, also aspired to fistic glory but, despite being a scientific boxer, did not have the commitment required to become a first-rate pugilist. Although he followed in the title-winning footsteps of his more illustrious sibling, his ring performances were generally uninspired. Nicholas Ward's championship victory over Ben Caunt on 2 February 1841 was entirely due to the latter's impetuosity, and three months later, having yielded submissively to the same fighter, he ended his &#145;milling&#146; career.<br>
