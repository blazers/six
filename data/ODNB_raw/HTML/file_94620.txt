<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Rue <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Laurence]</span>, Dame  (Elsie) Rosemary</span>  (1928&#150;2004), <span class="occ">medical practitioner and medical administrator</span>, was born on 14 June 1928 at The Cottage, Heronway, Hutton, Essex, the daughter of Harry Laurence (<i>d</i>. 1978), accountant, and his wife, Daisy Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sully (<i>d</i>. 1976). Her parents moved to Sydenham, south London, where she first attended school. During the blitz she was evacuated to Totnes, Devon. At the age of eleven she contracted tuberculous peritonitis and underwent major surgery. She spent a year convalescing, mostly in bed, and at that time decided to pursue a career in medicine. Despite missing a year of schooling, in 1945, at the age of seventeen, she was accepted at the Royal Free Hospital medical school, which at the time was an all-women hospital. On 7 January 1950 she married Roger Harry Edward Rue, a 26-year-old medical student in Oxford and a returned serviceman who had been an RAF pilot instructor during the Second World War. He was the son of Harry Robert Rue, automobile engineer. When she went to see the dean at the Royal Free to tell her that her name would be changing to Rue, she was told that she couldn't possibly stay at the Royal Free as no students were allowed to be married. Infuriated by this attitude, she rang around some other medical schools, including the Oxford University medical school, which accepted her at once. She moved to Oxford and qualified in 1951, taking the London exams.<br>
<br>Rue then wanted to spend a year in hospital medicine but none of the United Oxford Hospitals took married women. Eventually she did get a job at the Cowley Road Hospital, a long-stay hospital in Oxford, by not mentioning her marriage. The work was very interesting and challenging, as there was a wealth of clinical work, much of it in what later became geriatric medicine. By this time she had a baby, Randal (<i>b</i>. 1952)&#151;followed later by another son, Rolf (<i>b</i>. 1955)&#151;who presented many logistic problems of feeding and care. She managed her work and her baby efficiently, especially with the help of a Ceylonese doctor with whom she shared the resident quarters. However, when the senior doctors found out that not only was she married but had a child as well, she was sacked on the spot. In 1952, without a job, she was taken on by Dr Firth, whom she had met at a psychiatry course, in a general practice post in Temple Cowley, an industrial suburb of Oxford, where most people working at the huge Morris Motors factories lived. There she was exposed to different medical problems, especially allergies in the motor workers as a result of handling toxic paints and chemicals. In 1954 she was struck down with poliomyelitis; indeed she was the last person in Oxford to get polio. She was left virtually paralysed in one leg and could hardly manage to walk when she recovered, even with crutches and callipers and several surgical interventions. This remained a major disability for the rest of her life, but one that, at least to the outsider, she seemed to ignore completely.<br>
<br>In 1955 Rue was separated from her husband (they eventually divorced in 1960) and moved to live with her parents in Hertfordshire. After a brief spell of teaching biology and chemistry at a girls' school because her disability made it difficult for her to work as a GP, she joined a general practitioner, Martin Doyle, who had had one leg amputated for sarcoma, in Sarratt, Hertfordshire. Together they ran the practice and he was delighted to tell one and all that their practice had two good legs between them. After Doyle died Rue was appointed as assistant county medical officer for Hertfordshire in 1958, which started her new career in the administrative side of public health and medicine. In 1965 she became the assistant senior medical officer for the Oxford region, a relatively small but vibrant area. In 1971 she was promoted to senior administrative medical officer for the Oxford regional health board and in 1973 became regional medical officer for the Oxford regional health authority, a post she held until her retirement in 1988 (for the last four years acting also as regional general manager).<br>
<br>In the 1960s and 1970s money was becoming available for new hospitals and Rue made sure that she had access to it, especially for the new city that was being built at Milton Keynes on a greenfield site. She built a completely new hospital for Milton Keynes, new hospitals in Swindon (the Princess Margaret Hospital) and Reading, and finally the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford itself. As regional medical officer, and later also regional general manager, she was enormously proud of the National Health Service, for she had witnessed its start as a medical student. But also she was enormously supportive of the University of Oxford medical school, and provided substantial funds for a number of chairs and readerships there. Indeed during the 1970s the regius professor, Sir Richard Doll, and Rue formed a formidable pair, and her role in the creation of the modern medical school in Oxford was a significant one. In 1980&#150;82 she was seconded for two years as professor of community health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, a further tribute to her status in medicine in the United Kingdom.<br>
<br>Another project, for which Rue was perhaps best known, was a scheme for getting married medical women back into medicine. She was, understandably, very conscious of the difficulties that women had in progressing in medicine. She had noted that in Oxford many women doctors who had moved with their husbands or taken time out to have a family could not get jobs, or felt inexperienced, although highly qualified. She provided funding for various units within the United Oxford Hospitals to take on these women doctors for part-time training, and all were subsequently absorbed into the health service as consultants and associate specialists. This scheme spread around the country and innumerable women doctors, known widely as Rosemary Rue's babies, attributed their success in their medical careers to this extraordinary woman.<br>
<br>Rue was appointed CBE in 1977 and DBE in 1989, both richly deserved honours. She received many other awards, including the Jenner medal and a fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons by election, and honorary fellowships of Green College, Oxford, and the Royal College of Psychiatry. She was president of the Medical Women's Federation (1982&#150;3), the faculty of community medicine of the Royal College of Physicians (1986&#150;9), and of the British Medical Association (1990&#150;91). She was not a prolific writer but wrote papers on women in medicine and on ward design, for example. She had soon realized that it was inefficient to redesign every new hospital when so much was in common, and her first contribution in this area was the development of the &#145;Oxford method&#146; of providing standard fittings at the end of each bed, followed by standard corridor space and room size such that new hospitals could be put together in modules like Lego. This scheme was exported and used quite widely in the Middle East.<br>
<br>Rosemary Rue always seemed extremely relaxed and was always courteous and kind, despite the enormous pressures that she must have been under in her post as regional medical officer and regional general manager. She was well known for arranging appointments with some of the professors around 6.30 p.m. in the evening to discuss budgets for the coming year over a glass or two of sherry. Most went away satisfied, although few got all that they had asked for. In retirement she kept busy, for instance serving as chairman of the Margaret Pyke Trust, and vice-president of the Alzheimer's Society. She was devoted to her two sons, a feeling that was reciprocated. One of the sons was a pilot and quite often on a Sunday they would fly to France for lunch, coming back in the evening, an outing she always loved. An extraordinarily talented and courageous woman, she was diagnosed towards the end of her life with colorectal cancer, but characteristically in the weeks leading up to her death she had many of her old friends and colleagues to dinner to say goodbye, and strangely enough they were delightful and cheerful occasions. She died on Christmas eve 2004 at her home, 2 Wheatley Road, Stanton St John, Oxfordshire, and was survived by her two sons.<br>
