<span class="headword">Cooke,  Thomas</span>  (1703&#150;1756), <span class="occ">translator and writer</span>, was born on 16 December 1703, at Braintree, Essex, the son of John Cooke (<i>d</i>. in or after 1728), an innkeeper, and his wife, Rebeckah. His father, according to Pope, was a Muggletonian. Cooke was educated at Felsted School, where he excelled in classics. While quite young he was introduced to Thomas Herbert, eighth earl of Pembroke, who employed him and encouraged him in his classical studies. In 1722 Cooke went to London to earn his living by his pen, contributing articles to the daily papers, and attaching himself to the whigs. He came to know Thomas Tickell, Ambrose Philips, Leonard Welsted, Richard Steele, and John Dennis. Dennis was the subject of a letter (24 January 1734) from Cooke to John Baker of St John's College, Cambridge, published some fifty years later in the <span class="italic">European Magazine</span> (February 1786, 91&#150;2). In it Cooke gave an account of Dennis's acute poverty and the gifts of money from several prominent people, including the earl of Pembroke and Horace Walpole. Appended to the letter is a transcription of a Latin document detailing Dennis's birth, paternity, education, death, and burial. John Nichols, signing himself M. Green, one of his known pseudonyms, reprinted most of Cooke's letter which formed part of the Baker collection in the Harley MSS in the British Library (7031) in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (1st ser., 65, February 1795, 105&#150;6).<br>
<br>Cooke's earliest publications were a poem on the death of the duke of Marlborough (1722), a translation of the poems of Moschus and Bion, and <span class="italic">Albion, or, The Court of Neptune, a Masque</span> (1724). In 1725 he issued anonymously a poem entitled <span class="italic">The Battle of the Poets</span>, attacking Pope, Swift, and their friends, and eulogizing the writers of his own school. He continued the campaign by publishing in the <span class="italic">Daily Journal</span> (6 April 1728) notes on Pope's version of the Thersites episode in the second book of the <span class="italic">Iliad</span>, proving to his own satisfaction that Pope was no Greek scholar. Pope resolved to pillory Cooke in the <span class="italic">Dunciad</span>, but news of his intention reached Cooke, and he, taking alarm, wrote two letters to Pope (11 August and 16 September 1728), repudiating his connection with the offensive publications. With the second letter he forwarded a copy of his newly issued translation of Hesiod. In letters to Lord Oxford, Pope showed some sign of accepting Cooke's denial, but when the <span class="italic">Dunciad</span> appeared at the close of the year, Cooke occupied a place in it (B ii. 138), and was held up to ridicule in the notes. By way of reply Cooke reissued his <span class="italic">Battle of the Poets</span> and his letters on the Thersites episode, with new and caustic prefaces, in 1729. The volume was entitled <span class="italic">Tales, Epistles, Odes, Fables, &amp;c.</span>, and contained several other of Cooke's published poems, some translations from the classics, &#145;proposals for perfecting the English language&#146;, and an essay on grammar. Pope was here described as &#145;a person who with but a small share of learning and moderate natural endowments has by concurring and uncommon accidents acquired as great a reputation as the most learned and exalted genius could ever hope&#146;. In 1731 Cooke collected a number of the letters on the political and literary controversies of the day he had contributed, under the pseudonym of Atticus, to the <span class="italic">London Journal</span> in 1729 and 1730, and dedicated the book to Horace Walpole. Letter 5 is on &#145;the controversy betwixt the poets and Mr. Pope&#146;. Pope renewed his attack on Cooke in his <span class="italic">Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot</span>, 1.146 (1735).<br>
<br>Cooke tried his hand at every kind of literary work. In 1726 he published <span class="italic">The Bath, or, The Knights of the Bath</span>, a poem suggested by the revival of that order, to which was added the now very rare <span class="italic">Scandalous chronicle, or, A ballad of characters, written for the use of the poets, and proper to be sung at their next sessions</span>; <span class="italic">Philander and Cydippe</span>, a poem; and an edition of Marvell's works, with a memoir. Subsequently he issued separately a long series of odes, with dedications addressed to Lord Chesterfield and other persons of influence. William Oldys says that Cooke compiled <span class="italic">Seymour's Survey of London</span> in 1734. In this same year he wrote a short <span class="italic">Life of King Edward III of England</span>. And about this time he contributed to the <span class="italic">Weekly Oracle</span>, numbers 54 and 56 on the Phalaris controversy being by him. Four years later he wrote the preface to the poem by Samuel Wesley the younger entitled <span class="italic">The Battle of the Sexes</span>. Another edition of Cooke's collected poems appeared in 1742.<br>
<br>Cooke achieved a wider and deserved reputation by his translations from the classics. In 1728 he translated Hesiod, the first translation in English; his early patron, the earl of Pembroke, and Lewis Theobald contributed notes. Each of the two volumes bears the dedication to a notable personage, and the practice of seeking and acquiring a dedicatee continued for all his subsequent writings. He was thereafter known as Hesiod Cooke. The edition was reissued in a number of early anthologies. An edition of Terence, with an English translation (3 vols.), followed in 1734, and a translation of Cicero's <span class="italic">De natura deorum</span>, with elaborate critical apparatus, in 1737. In 1741 Cooke produced an edition of Virgil with English notes and a Latin paraphrase, and in 1754 appeared the first and only volume&#151;a translation of the <span class="italic">Amphitruo</span>&#151;of the long-promised edition of Plautus. Samuel Johnson said that Cooke was soliciting subscriptions for this book for twenty years, and that the proceeds of his canvass formed his main source of income. Cooke, according to Sir Joseph Mawbey, said that Johnson was &#145;half a madman, half a scholar, three parts a Roman Catholick, and a compleat Jacobite&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 61, 1791, 1184).<br>
<br>Cooke was extremely successful in obtaining subscribers to his projected edition of Plautus's plays, according to Isaac Reed, editor of the <span class="italic">European Magazine</span> (December 1791, 406&#150;7). When the first, and only, volume of the Plautus was published in 1746, there were 713 subscribers. Eighteen years earlier, in 1728, Cooke managed to get only 174 subscribers to his translation of Hesiod. In the intervening years he had sharpened his techniques. Reed, in the <span class="italic">European Magazine</span> piece cited above, reprinted two letters from Cooke to prospective subscribers in which his methods are clearly seen.<br>
<br>Cooke also wrote for the stage. In 1728 he helped his friend John Mottley with <span class="italic">Penelope, a Dramatic Opera</span>. The <span class="italic">Triumphs of Love and Honour</span>, with a prologue by Sir Robert Henly, then a student of the Inner Temple, was acted at Drury Lane on 18 August 1731, and was published in the same year with an essay &#145;on the stage, and on the advantages which arise to a nation from the encouragement of the arts&#146;. The essay, with long criticisms of Shakespeare's <span class="italic">King Lear</span> and Addison's <span class="italic">Rosamond</span>, was also issued separately. <span class="italic">The Eunuch, or, The Darby Captain</span>, a musical farce adapted from Terence, was performed at Drury Lane on 17 May 1737, with Charles Macklin in the part of Captain Brag. In 1739 Cooke published a tragedy called <span class="italic">The Mournful Nuptials</span>, together with &#145;some considerations on satire and on the present state of our public entertainments&#146;. It was acted under the title of <span class="italic">Love the Cause and Cure of Grief, or, The Innocent Murderer</span> at Drury Lane on 19 December 1743. His most successful effort was <span class="italic">The Battle of the Poets, or, The Contention for the Laureat</span> (1730), a new act introduced into Fielding's <span class="italic">Tom Thumb</span>, acted six times and republished in 1744, with a prologue by Sir Robert Henly, according to Sir Joseph Mawbey. Mawbey also stated that he had offered Garrick a manuscript play by Cooke entitled &#145;Germanicus&#146;, but Garrick declined it. Cooke subsequently wrote songs for Vauxhall, and dialogue and songs for John Rich's production of Theobald's very popular <span class="italic">Harlequin, a Sorcerer</span>. About 1742 Cooke took part in Colley Cibber's theatrical quarrel, and issued, under the pseudonym Scriblerus Quartus, <span class="italic">The Bays Miscellany, or, Colley Triumphant</span>, which included two new satiric dialogues, &#145;Petty Sessions of the Poets&#146; and &#145;The contention of the Laurel as it is now acting at the New Theatre at the Hay-Market&#146;, together with a reprint of the <span class="italic">Battle of the Poets</span>. In 1743 an extravagantly eulogistic epistle in verse addressed by Cooke to the countess of Shaftesbury appeared, together with a prologue and epilogue on Shakespeare, the former spoken by Garrick at Drury Lane on 21 January, before and after <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span> for his benefit, and the latter by Mrs Woffington. Cooke formed a fine collection of printed plays, which he sold to Mrs Oldfield, the actress, and after her death it was purchased (1737) by Queen Caroline for &pound;200.<br>
<br>About 1741 Cooke became editor and author of the well-known <span class="italic">Craftsman</span>, in succession to Nicholas Amhurst. In 1748 his free criticisms of the Pelham administration led the duke of Bedford, a secretary of state, to proceed against him for libel, and he was placed under the care of a parliamentary messenger for several weeks, but received no further punishment. Religious discussions interested Cooke, and he approached them from an advanced point of view. In 1748 he published anonymously a letter (addressed before 1732 to Archbishop Wake) &#145;concerning Persecution for Religion and Freedom of Debate, proving Liberty to be the support of Truth and natural property of Mankind&#146;, which was prefixed to <span class="italic">A Demonstration of the Will of God by the Light of Nature</span>. This work was dedicated to the third earl of Shaftesbury, and portions of it criticize the argument of Samuel Clarke (1675&#150;1729), with whom Cooke was for the most part in agreement. In 1756 he supplied Dr Leonard Howard, rector of St Saviour's, Southwark, with some unpublished poems and old correspondence as material for the second volume of Howard's collection of <span class="italic">Ancient Letters</span>. Among Cooke's correspondents were men prominent in the church and in the universities, as well as a number of writers.<br>
<br>Cooke was always in debt, and his difficulties increased with his years. He died in great poverty on 29 December 1756 at a small house in Lambeth, which he was in the habit of describing to casual acquaintances as a magnificent mansion. He was buried on 1 January 1757. A few literary friends subscribed to his funeral expenses, and contributed to the support of his widow, Anne, a sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1906/', "Charles Beckingham")</script>, and his only child, a daughter, Elizabeth. Anne died in March 1757, and Elizabeth in the autumn of 1758 in the Lambeth workhouse. Cooke, though of a convivial temper, had a cynical humour; he introduced Samuel Foote to a club as &#145;the nephew of the gentleman who was lately hung in chains for murdering his brother&#146;. Sir Joseph Mawbey, to whom Cooke left his manuscripts, contributed a long anecdotal biography, with copious extracts from his commonplace books, to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> for 1791, 1792, and 1797. There he described Cooke as of a &#145;bold and daring temper&#146; and &#145;blunt, and sometimes coarse&#146;, as well as &#145;not infrequently dictatorial and assuming, which often disgusted strangers, and made him feared by many&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 61/2, 1791, 1092; 62/1, 1792, 30).<br>
