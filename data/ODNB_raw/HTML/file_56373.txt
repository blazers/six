<span class="headword">Knowles,  James Thomas</span>  (1806&#150;1884), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 23 September 1806 at 41 Bell Street, Reigate, the premises of his parents, the Surrey glaziers James Knowles (1778&#150;1813) and Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gale (<i>d</i>. 1836). One of six children, Knowles probably attended the local parish school before being apprenticed as a glazier and plumber, possibly in or around London. This London experience, his membership of the freemasons (1834), and local connections probably helped him gain access to his first clients. For example it was probably through his family's association with Reigate landowner the earl of Hardwicke that Knowles met Captain the Hon. George Francis Wyndham, later the fourth earl of Egremont and an important client.<br>
<br>On 18 January 1831 Knowles married Susannah Brown (1810&#150;1876), and in 1836, on the death of his mother, he inherited the family business. But he was already styling himself &#145;architect&#146;, and since around 1833 had been establishing himself as a designer of large classical country houses; for example, he rebuilt Bramley Park, Surrey, for the fourth earl of Egremont in 1837. Following his unbuilt design for a vast country house (Egremont Castle, Somerset, 1838), the smaller, &#145;Greco-Lilliputian&#146;  (<span class="italic">Country Life</span>, 7 Sept 1945) Silverton Park, Devon (1839&#150;45) achieved its grandeur through architectural treatment rather than dimensions. Knowles also designed country rectories, and churches, for example St John the Evangelist, Redhill, Surrey (1842&#150;3; extensively remodelled by J. L. Pearson, 1889).<br>
<br>The architecturally and socially ambitious Knowles entered the Houses of Parliament design competition in 1836. In 1840 he severed his links with the glazier's trade, moving to Clapham with his wife, three daughters, and two sons (both of whom were apprenticed to him by 1848). Though practising from 1 Raymond Buildings, Gray's Inn, since 1839 at least, Knowles only became a fellow of the RIBA in 1847. Knowles's own palazzo-style house, Friday Grove, Clapham (1845), marked his social arrival and advertised his architectural style. In 1851 he entered the Great Exhibition competition, and was selected for &#145;honourable and favourable mention&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Builder</span>, 8 June 1850). His reputation was further enhanced by his houses and business premises for London commercialists, particularly the fashionable palazzo-style warehouses for draper William Cook at St Paul's Churchyard (1853) and for bookseller Hodgson at Chancery Lane (1854). <span class="italic">The Builder</span> described Cook's as &#145;more like a Walhalla than a warehouse&#146;  (19 Feb 1853), and praised Hodgson's (which exhibited hallmark &#145;eyelid&#146; window hoods and openwork decoration) as &#145;a substantially beautiful &hellip; business pile&#146;  (18 Aug 1885) designed to be both aesthetic and functional.<br>
<br>Knowles's connection with the Cook family led to his only known foreign travel and commission&#151;the rebuilding of Villa Monserrate at Cintra in Portugal (<i>c</i>.1858&#150;63), as an elaborate and exotic villa of corridor-linked pavilions, topped with &#145;oriental&#146; cupolas. An 1870 poem praised this imaginative &#145;Knowlesian&#146; architecture and, though a later commentator criticized it as &#145;barbarous orientalism &hellip; built in a moorish delerium&#146;  (Macaulay, 137), it is now a national monument.<br>
<br>The blending of styles and favourite motifs in an attempt to synthesize a particularly English contemporary style is Knowles's hallmark, and is nowhere better illustrated than in one joint commission with his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34353/', "James Thomas Knowles (1831&#150;1908)")</script>, the Grosvenor Hotel (1859&#150;63), serving London's Victoria railway station. Here the spatially exciting interior, external &#145;eyelid&#146; windows, and vigorous applied decoration, beneath the complex curving roof-forms, give the &#145;Knowlesian&#146; flavour. The &#145;Grosvenor style&#146; fused Gothic, Moorish, and classical in the elder Knowles's search for what was &#145;truly grand, and beautiful, and original in design&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Builder</span>, 8 June 1850). His son's biographer describes the Knowleses as &#145;eclectics and reconcilers both&#146;  (Metcalf, ix): the &#145;rumbustious&#146; decoration  (M. Girouard, <span class="italic">The Victorian Country House</span>, 1979, 294), which earned the Grosvenor the accolade of having &#145;the largest swags in London&#146;  (<span class="italic">Building News</span>, 20 March 1863, 210&#150;11), perhaps demonstrates the influence of the younger Knowles, as his father's later style was more conservative.<br>
<br>Knowles was evidently a practical man who valued convenience, &#145;fitness in design &hellip; and durability &hellip; in construction&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Builder</span>, 15 June 1850). His pragmatic approach and willingness to engage theoretical issues are demonstrated by his 1850 address to the RIBA on &#145;The propriety of the application of cements &hellip; to the exterior of buildings&#146;, which was vigorously debated against a background of Ruskinian notions of honesty in architecture.<br>
<br>Knowles, dignified, &#145;determined&#146;, and &#145;self-reliant&#146;  (Metcalf, 19), largely practised alone in the later 1860s, his last commercial work being Tarn's drapers at Elephant and Castle, Southwark (1863), after which he returned to domestic practice, with Hedsor House, Buckinghamshire, for Lord Boston (1865&#150;8). He retired from Raymond Buildings in 1869, but in 1872&#150;3 designed a memorial fountain at Wigton, Cumberland, for long-standing client textile magnate George Moore. In retirement Knowles remained a dedicated and active member of the RIBA council (a record of his activities may be found in RIBA <span class="italic">Transactions</span>, 47, 1884, 619, and <span class="italic">The Builder</span>, 3 May 1884, 604). He died on 23 March 1884 at 49 Russell Square, Bloomsbury, where he lived with his younger son, George, after Susannah's death in 1876. He was buried with her at Norwood cemetery.<br>
