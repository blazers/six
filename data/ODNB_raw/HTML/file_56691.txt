<span class="headword">Townsend <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Butler]</span>,  Mary Elizabeth</span>  (1841&#150;1918), <span class="occ">philanthropist</span>, was born on 23 July 1841 at St John's vicarage, Kilkenny, the only child of the Revd Robert Butler (<i>d</i>. 1847) and his wife, Grace (<i>d</i>. 1843), daughter of the Revd James Hamilton of Trim, co. Meath. At the time of her birth, her father was vicar of St John's and domestic chaplain to the earl of Ormond. Left an orphan at an early age, Mary Butler was brought up in England by her father's sisters. On 21 July 1863 she married Frederick Townsend (1823&#150;1905), a serious-minded amateur artist and botanist eighteen years her senior. The marriage was a happy one: Mary Townsend later recalled &#145;I was free indeed with one who was all in all to me. Then life began to open out in fair colours and every gift I had began to grow and develop under his care&#146;  (M. E. Townsend, &#145;Memories&#146;, 7).<br>
<br>In 1875 Frederick Townsend inherited his uncle's estate of Honington Hall, but the couple's early married life was spent at Shedfield Lodge, near Wickham, in Hampshire. Taking a keen interest in the people living on the estate, Frederick organized support for the local cottage hospital, the building of a recreation and reading-room, and a library for working men, and ran village penny-savings banks, while Mary started working classes for girls whose education had finished at elementary school, looked after the ill and the aged, and became involved in the work of the local orphanage for girls. Through these activities she became aware of the problems faced by girls going into domestic service, including loss of communications with their families and unwanted pregnancies resulting in dismissal.<br>
<br>A friend and frequent visitor at Shedfield was the Revd T. V. Fosbery, chaplain to Bishop Samuel Wilberforce; in 1873 the bishop invited Mary Townsend to assist in some diocesan &#145;rescue work&#146; among &#145;fallen women&#146;. She soon perceived that prevention was better than cure: realizing that servant girls were often friendless and had no respectable place to go on their half-days off, she argued that they needed &#145;a little love, a few kind words, a look, a smile of interest to show that they are cared for; that they are expected to do well and that their career is watched with hope&#146;  (Money, 7). Fosbery encouraged Mary Townsend to take on this work herself, and through his interest drew in Catharine Tait (1819&#150;1878), Elizabeth Browne (wife of the bishop of Winchester), and Jane Nassau Senior (1828&#150;1877). They all met at Lambeth Palace in May 1874 and resolved to establish the Girls' Friendly Society (GFS), which officially began its work on 1 January 1875.<br>
<br>Although avowedly non-sectarian, the GFS was organized in parish, deanery, and diocesan groups (with a central office in London), reflecting its Anglican origins. It aimed to maintain a high standard of morals among its members (aged from fourteen upwards and unmarried), supplying &#145;for every working girl of unblemished character a friend in a class above her own&#146;  (Money, 36). Both classes of membership&#151;known as members and associates&#151;paid an annual subscription, half of which went to the branch and half to central funds. Recreation rooms, supervised by associates, provided opportunities for working-class girls to meet, read, sew, sing, and enjoy simple refreshments. Mary Townsend worked tirelessly in the early days of the movement. She served as president from 1876 to 1883 and again from 1891 to 1894, and also acted as head of various departments; she was directing the candidates department in 1879 when, by popular demand, it was decided to admit girls as young as eight years old. She wrote copiously for the various GFS journals&#151;such as <span class="italic">Friendly Leaves</span>, <span class="italic">Friendly Work</span>, and the <span class="italic">Associates Journal</span>&#151;and compiled best-selling collections of prayers and hymns. She succeeded in persuading popular writers to contribute to GFS publications, most notably recruiting Charlotte M. Yonge (1832&#150;1901), who opened and ran a branch of the GFS at her home in Elderfield and featured the GFS in such novels as <span class="italic">The Two Sides of the Shield</span> (1885). Mary Townsend developed lifelong friendships with many of the early associates and paid workers of the GFS, and she was consulted by the general committee even when she held no office.<br>
<br>The GFS encountered some difficulties&#151;the mistresses of households were sometimes suspicious of what they saw as interference between themselves and their servants&#151;but it grew with a speed that astonished the founder. By 1878, when the first report was published, the GFS was active in nineteen dioceses and Gibraltar, with 10,678 members and 4442 associates. A wide range of departments had been established, including those supervising shop and factory workers, publications, houses of rest, and affiliated societies, and services included a circulating library and an employment exchange. Thirty years later, other new departments&#151;including those overseeing the welfare of sick and blind members and the safety of emigrating girls and women&#151;had been established, and the GFS was offering training of various descriptions to members. From 1880 the society enjoyed royal patronage, and Queen Victoria herself acted as an associate and admitted servant girls at Balmoral to membership. In 1911 Mary Townsend celebrated the success of the GFS in expanding its original remit and transcending class boundaries:<blockquote>We are no longer an Association of Ladies working for girls chiefly of one class, but a band of women of all ranks, ages and occupations, invited to share in the same work, to uphold the same principles, each according to her power. (Money, 200)</blockquote>By 1913 the society had 197,493 members and 39,926 associates in England and Wales alone, with 80,274 candidates. When war broke out in 1914 the government sought the assistance of the GFS in recruiting and caring for women war workers, running canteens, and providing comforts for the troops. Mary Townsend herself organized a guild of church needlework to provide linen and paintings for army chaplains in France. She died suddenly on 14 June 1918 at Homewood, Hindhead, Surrey, shortly before the society received commendation for its war efforts in a government white paper, with honours for the president and secretary. She was buried beside her husband in Honington churchyard. Childless herself, Mary Townsend had influenced the lives of many girls and women of all classes, and her ability to motivate, delegate, and promote essential change ensured that the GFS survived her own death. At the close of the twentieth century it was still active in twenty-five countries worldwide, mainly those in the Anglican communion.<br>
