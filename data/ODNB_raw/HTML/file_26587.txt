<span class="headword">Stopford,  Joshua</span>  (1635/6&#150;1675), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, came from Lancashire; his parents' names are as yet unknown. He was admitted as a plebeian at Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1654, aged eighteen; he was awarded a Nowell scholarship on 25 November and matriculated on 25 July 1655. He migrated to Magdalen College as clerk the following year. He graduated BA on 23 February 1658, and was created MA in April and BD in May 1670. At some time Stopford married. Nothing is known of his wife other than that she was named Elizabeth. They are known to have had at least nine children, five daughters and four sons, baptized between December 1661 and October 1675, of whom at least three died in early childhood. The eldest known, Katherine, baptized in Manchester in December 1661, died aged sixteen and was buried in York in April 1678. Their last child was baptized a mere fortnight before Stopford's death.<br>
<br>On 29 June 1658 Stopford was appointed morning lecturer at the parish church in Manchester; three months later, on 23 September, he was ordained by the Manchester classis. However, he conformed at the Restoration and held the prebend of Dunnington in York Minster between November 1660 and late 1663. He appears to have continued preaching in Manchester until September 1662 when he and his wife finally left Manchester. He was presented with the living of Kirkby Stephen in Westmorland in 1663 and at the same time he appears as rector of All Saints' Pavement in York. Some time between 1663 and 1667 he was also appointed vicar of St Martin's, Coney Street, York.<br>
<br>Stopford published two anti-Catholic treatises: <span class="italic">The Ways and Methods of Rome's Advancement: Two Sermons Preached on 5 November 1671</span> (1675), in which he warned against Catholic false doctrine, and <span class="italic">Pagano-Papismus</span> (1675), in which he drew parallels between the Catholic church and pre-Christian or pagan practices in religion. Both works contain extensive bibliographies of the works he cited as evidence in support of his theories.<br>
<br>Stopford died in York on 3 November 1675. He was buried in the chancel of St Martin's Church in Coney Street on 5 November. Nothing further is known of his wife and surviving children. No will appears to have survived.<br>
