<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Raleigh, Sir  Walter Alexander</span>  (1861&#150;1922), <span class="occ">literary scholar and historian</span>, was born on 5 September 1861 at 4 Highbury Quadrant, London, the fifth child and only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23041/', "Alexander Raleigh (1817&#150;1880)")</script>, then Congregational minister of Hare Court Chapel, Canonbury, London, and his wife, Mary Darling, the only daughter of James Gifford, of Edinburgh. After a short time at the City of London School he was sent in 1876 to Edinburgh, where he lived with his uncle, the judge Adam Gifford, Lord Gifford (1820&#150;1887), and became a pupil at the Edinburgh Academy. On his return to London in 1877 he attended University College School and proceeded to University College, London, graduating with a BA in 1881. In October 1881 he entered King's College, Cambridge, and obtained a second class in the historical tripos of 1885. In the Lent term of 1883 he interrupted his residency at King's to travel by sea to Italy in the interest of his health; since childhood he had been subject to a nervous tremor in both arms, which he never wholly overcame. Upon his return he had shot up to 6 feet 6 inches in height. For some time he edited the <span class="italic">Cambridge Review</span>, and in Michaelmas term 1884 he was president of the Cambridge Union.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1885 Raleigh went to India as the first professor of English literature at the Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental College in Aligarh, but he was invalided home in April 1887. His letters give a vivid picture of his Indian experience  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 1.28&#150;107), which he always spoke of with enthusiasm. Forbidden by his doctors to return to India, he thought of becoming a journalist. During the winter of 1888&#150;9 he lectured for the Oxford University extension delegacy, and in March 1889 he became personal assistant to Professor Adolphus William Ward at Victoria University, Manchester. In November of the same year he was appointed professor of modern literature at University College, Liverpool, in succession to A. C. Bradley, and began his work there in January 1890. On 8 July 1890 he married Lucie Gertrude Jackson (<i>b</i>. 1865/6), the only daughter of Mason Jackson, the art editor of the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>. They had four sons, and one daughter, Philippa, who later married the scholar and journalist Charles Whibley (1859&#150;1930).<br>
<br>At Liverpool Raleigh played a spirited part in college affairs, at a time when the college was developing into the university. He also began to write, his chief publication to this point having been a paper read to the Browning Society while he was still at Cambridge (Browning Society's <span class="italic">Papers</span>, no. 25, 1884). His first book was <span class="italic">The English Novel</span> (1894), which he soon came to regard as &#145;'prentice&#146; work, but it exhibits his gift for lucid and lively narrative, covering the period up to the publication of Scott's <span class="italic">Waverley</span>. It was followed by <span class="italic">Robert Louis Stevenson: an Essay</span> (1895), a brief appreciation based on a lecture delivered at the Royal Institution, and <span class="italic">Style</span> (1897), which he wrote with enthusiasm but afterwards disparaged as &#145;stuck up&#146;&#151;its prose is certainly highly affected. He was Clark lecturer in English literature at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1899, and embodied his lectures in <span class="italic">Milton</span> (1900), a penetrating study, which includes interesting analyses of the poet's language. Its admirers have included William Empson, who called it a &#145;splendid handbook&#146;  (<span class="italic">Milton's God</span>, 1961, 9). The same year he edited, with a long introduction which broke new ground, Sir Thomas Hoby's <span class="italic">Book of the Courtier, from the Italian of Count Baldassare Castiglione</span> for the <span class="roman">Tudor Translations</span>, a series of reprints projected by W. E. Henley. In addition to these five books belonging to the ten years of his professorship at Liverpool, Raleigh also contributed to <span class="italic">English Prose Selections</span>, edited by Henry Craik, and to periodicals such as the <span class="italic">New Review</span> and the <span class="italic">Yellow Book</span>. Although his appointment to the professorship had been thought to be risky, by 1900 he was winning recognition as the most original and stimulating of the younger critics.<br>
<br>In June 1900 Raleigh was appointed by the crown to the chair of English language and literature at Glasgow University, again in succession to A. C. Bradley, and for the next four years he was one of the outstanding personalities there. Daily lectures to hundreds of students and continual administrative meetings left him less time for writing than he had enjoyed at Liverpool. But in the summer vacation of 1902, while staying at Stanford in the Vale, Berkshire, he wrote <span class="italic">Wordsworth</span> (1903), a companion to his <span class="italic">Milton</span> and a surprise to admirers of Wordsworth, who had not expected the author of <span class="italic">Style</span> to appraise the poet's language and themes so sympathetically. He intended that his next book should be on Chaucer, whom, in contrast to Milton and Wordsworth, he called &#145;my man&#146;, but only disjointed lecture notes remain. Having been consulted by the Glasgow publishing firm of MacLehose about their projected series of English voyages, Raleigh promised an essay for their edition of Richard Hakluyt's <span class="italic">Voyages</span>. This he wrote at Uffington, Berkshire, in the summer of 1904. It was published under the title of &#145;The English voyages of the sixteenth century&#146; in <span class="italic">Hakluyt's Voyages</span> (12, 1905) and in 1906 was published separately. He said more than once that it was his &#145;best book&#146;, though modern readers may find unacceptable his tolerance of some of the actions of the English seamen.<br>
<br>In June 1904 Raleigh became the first holder of the new chair of English literature at Oxford, with a fellowship at Magdalen College. The school of English language and literature had been established in 1894, but its steady development began with Raleigh's appointment. His usual method as a lecturer was informal&#151;a few facts, the reading of passages (admirably interpreted), and a running commentary. Much depended on his mood at the time, but when he was at his best no student forgot the impression he had made. Believing that system and dogma are unreliable guides in the study of literature, he invited his listeners to read and think for themselves. His audience contained men of all ages&#151;during one term Robert Bridges attended regularly&#151;and to one and all he seemed to speak as an equal. This was a rare attitude at the time for a professor to adopt, but it aroused enthusiasm among his students. An important part of his work at Oxford was his acting as an adviser to the Clarendon Press.<br>
<br>Raleigh's first essay written at Oxford was his introduction to <span class="italic">Lyrical Poems of William Blake</span> (1905). He wrote <span class="italic">Shakespeare</span> (1907) during the latter half of 1906, and of all his books it was this one which he was most pleased to have finished. &#145;I think Falstaff is good&#146;, he said, &#145;so are Shakespeare's women&#146;. He realized the book's inequalities; but the chapter entitled &#145;Story and character&#146; is important for its insights into Shakespeare's methods. One vital point which he makes is that Shakespeare could not work on his characters until he had created a situation: &#145;His plays open with a postulate; then the characters begin to live&#146;  (pocket edn, 1925, 134).<br>
<br>Raleigh welcomed the relaxation offered by a voyage to South Africa in 1907, though during his two months there he lectured at Pretoria, Johannesburg, Durban, Grahamstown, Cape Town, and Stellenbosch. On his return he compiled a collection of Samuel Johnson's essays and notes on Shakespeare  (<span class="italic">Johnson on Shakespeare</span>, 1908). In 1910 he brought out <span class="italic">Six Essays on Johnson</span>. This was his last book on a single author, and there are many critics who consider it his best. He was the Leslie Stephen lecturer at Cambridge in 1907 and went there as Clark lecturer for the second time, at Trinity College in 1911. In 1911 he was knighted on the occasion of the coronation of George V.<br>
<br>Raleigh had never overrated the importance of the academic study of literature, and from his first years at Oxford, and even earlier, he had an increasing desire to write on men and things directly. It was significant of this changing interest that his next book should have been an edition of the <span class="italic">Complete Works of George Savile, First Marquess of Halifax</span> (1912). His Henry Sidgwick memorial lecture on Dryden, delivered at Newnham College, Cambridge, in 1913, was largely on politics and the application of Dryden's satire to the present day. His essay on Burns (contributed to W. S. Douglas's edition of J. G. Lockhart's <span class="italic">Life of Burns</span>, 1914) he thought as good as anything he had written &#145;on a man&#146;. But he had no heart for further literary criticism after the outbreak of war in 1914. He wrote only one more critical essay on a new subject, &#145;Don Quixote&#146; (<span class="italic">TLS</span>, 27 April 1916). In October 1914, when his Oxford professorship was reconstituted as the Merton chair of English literature, he became a fellow of Merton College. Other academic honours which he received were honorary degrees from the universities of Glasgow and Durham and honorary fellowships of King's College, Cambridge (1912), and Magdalen College, Oxford (1916).<br>
<br>The war occupied Raleigh's thoughts for the rest of his life. <span class="italic">Might is Right</span>, written for the series of <span class="roman">Oxford Pamphlets</span> (October 1914), was followed by addresses on <span class="italic">The War of Ideas</span> (December 1916), <span class="italic">The Faith of England</span> (March 1917), <span class="italic">Some Gains of the War</span> (February 1918), and <span class="italic">The War and the Press</span> (March 1918), and by his British Academy lecture, <span class="italic">Shakespeare and England</span> (July 1918). These were collected into a volume entitled <span class="italic">England and the War</span> (1918), the main subject of which is the English character. In 1915 he was responsible for &#145;<i>The Times</i> broadsheets for soldiers and sailors&#146;. In that year he went to the United States to deliver at Princeton University the two lectures published under the title of <span class="italic">Romance</span> (1915); they were based on old material and delivered in the intervals of speaking about England and the war. His introduction to <span class="italic">Shakespeare's England</span> (1916), a book which he had planned many years earlier, is a glorification of the Elizabethan spirit and ends on a patriotic note.<br>
<br>Raleigh found a new interest in his lectures at Oxford after 1918, when men who had fought in the war crowded to hear him. At no time was he more sought after by the younger members of the university. These post-war years were busy, for in July 1918 he had accepted the invitation of the Air Ministry to write the official history of the Royal Air Force. He was able to complete only the first volume of <span class="italic">The War in the Air</span> (<span class="italic">History of the Great War Based on Official Documents</span>, 1922) but it remains his longest work. It was his first experience of writing history on a large scale, and he stated in his preface that &#145;The writer of this history has endeavoured to make his narrative intelligible to those who, like himself, are outsiders&#146;. His style is here at its simplest, but the fervour of his admiration for the heroism of the air is everywhere apparent and finds memorable expression in the introduction. The volume was published a few weeks after his death.<br>
<br>On 16 March 1922 Raleigh set out for the Middle East in preparation for the second volume of <span class="italic">The War in the Air</span>. When he returned to London on 25 April he was in the grip of typhoid fever, contracted when his aeroplane was marooned for four or five days in the desert between Jerusalem and Baghdad. He died at the Acland Nursing Home, Oxford, on 13 May 1922 and was buried at Ferry Hinksey, Berkshire, the village near Oxford where he had lived since 1909 at The Hangings, the house designed for him by his friend A. H. Clough, the son of the poet. His wife survived him.<br>
<br>Raleigh was a fine conversationalist, equally at his ease in very different kinds of company. His letters show a wide range of mood and often disguise their purpose in their jocularity. Reviewing the letters, however, Virginia Woolf thought that the &#145;excitement, the adventure, the turmoil of creation was unknown to him&#146;  (Woolf, 87). As a critic he came to write most freely when dealing with an author's character and outlook. His aim, he once said briefly, was &#145;to explain people&#146;, and he was more interested in men than in movements or theories. Yet he taught the continuity of literature and maintained that the English school at Oxford must be a school of the history of English literature and language. With Joseph Wright, C. H. Firth, and others, Raleigh reformed the examination structure and oversaw a considerable expansion in the number of students. His aims were not completely realized, since it proved impossible fully to integrate philological and literary studies in the degree course.<br>
<br>A selection from Raleigh's lighter pieces in verse and prose, among them three &#145;little plays&#146;, was edited by his second son, Hilary Raleigh, in 1923 under the title <span class="italic">Laughter from a Cloud</span>, and in the same year fourteen of his occasional essays and addresses were collected in <span class="italic">Some Authors</span>, a volume which he had roughly planned. The longer passages in his notes for his lectures were edited in 1926 by George Gordon under the title <span class="italic">On Writing and Writers</span>. His <span class="italic">Letters</span> (2 vols.), edited by Lady Raleigh, also appeared in 1926. A memorial window to him by Laura Anning Bell was placed in the library of Merton College. The larger portion of the fund raised in his memory provides an income for the purchase of rare books for the English faculty library at Oxford, which he had been primarily responsible for founding in 1914.<br>
