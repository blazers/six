<span class="headword">Quin,  Walter</span>  (<em>c.</em>1575&#150;1641), <span class="occ">poet and royal tutor</span>, was born in Dublin. He was apparently studying at Edinburgh University when, in 1595, he was presented to James VI, who was charmed with his manner. He further recommended himself to the king by giving him some poetic anagrams of his own composition on James's name in Latin, Italian, English, and French, together with a poetical composition in French entitled &#145;Discours sur le mesme anagramme en forme de dialogue entre un Zelateur du bien public, et une Dame laquelle represente le royaume d'Angleterre&#146;. The good impression which Quin made was confirmed by his presenting the king, on new year's day 1596, with an oration about his title to the English throne. The Edinburgh printer Waldegrave refused, however, to print a book on the subject which Quin prepared in February 1598. Quin was at the time reported to be writing a response to the fourth book of Edmund Spenser's <span class="italic">Faerie Queene</span>, where the king's mother, Mary, queen of Scots, was denounced under the name of Duessa.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Quin had been taken into the service of James VI as tutor to his sons, and he gave abundant proof of his loyalty by publishing <span class="italic">Sertum poeticum in honorem Jacobi sexti serenissimi ac potentissimi Scotorum regis</span> (1600). The volume consists of some of Quin's early anagrams on the king's names, some Latin odes and epigrams, and some English sonnets, addressed either to members of the royal family or to frequenters of the court who interested themselves in literature. In 1604 Quin celebrated the marriage of his friend Sir William Alexander in a poem that was to remain unprinted among the Hawthornden manuscripts at Edinburgh University.<br>
<br>Quin migrated with the Scottish king to England in 1603 on his accession to the English throne, and was employed as music teacher in the household of Prince Henry at a salary of &pound;50 per annum. He lamented the prince's death in 1612 in two sonnets, respectively in English and Italian, in Latin verse, and in some stanzas in French; these elegies were printed in Joshua Sylvester's <span class="italic">Lachrymae lachrymarum</span> (1612), and the two in English and Latin were reissued in <span class="italic">Mausoleum</span> (1613). In 1611 he contributed Italian verses in praise of the author to Thomas Coryat's <span class="italic">Odcombian Banquet</span>.<br>
<br>Quin became, after Prince Henry's death, preceptor to his brother Charles. For Charles's use he compiled <span class="italic">Corona virtutum principe dignarum ex variis philosophorum, historicorum, oratorum, et poetarum floribus contexta et concinnata</span>, with accounts of the lives and virtues of Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius (1613); this was reissued at Leiden in 1634, and in Stephen de Melle's <span class="italic">Syntagma philosophicum</span> (1670, 5.336&#150;481). A more ambitious literary venture followed in <span class="italic">The memorie of the most worthy and renowned Bernard Stuart, Lord D'Aubigni, renewed, whereunto are added wishes presented to the prince at his creation</span> (1619); &#145;A short collection of the most notable places of histories&#146; in prose is appended, together with a series of poems, entitled &#145;Wishes&#146;, and addressed to Prince Charles.<br>
<br>On Charles I's marriage in 1625 Quin published a congratulatory poem in four languages&#151;Latin, English, French, and Italian. It bore the title <span class="italic">In nuptiis principum incomparabilium, Caroli Britannici imperii monarchae &hellip; et Henriettae Mariae gratulatio quadrilinguis</span> (1625). Ten Latin lines signed &#145;Walt. O&#151;Quin Armig.&#146; are prefixed to Sir Thomas Herbert's <span class="italic">Travels</span> in 1634. An undated petition, assigned to 1635, from Quin's son John describes both Quin and his wife as ancient servants of the royal family, and prays that the pension of &pound;100 per annum granted to Quin may be continued during life to the petitioner. Nothing more is heard of Quin until 1641, when notification of his death in London was lodged by his widow, Anne.<br>
<br>Another son, <a name="cosubject_22961"></a><span class="headword">James Quin</span>  (1620/21&#150;1659)<span class="occ"></span>, was born in Middlesex, obtained a scholarship at Westminster School, and was elected aged eighteen to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1639. He graduated BA in 1642 and MA in 1646, and was elected a senior student. He contributed to the Oxford University collections of Latin verse issued on the return of the king from Scotland in 1641, and on the peace with the Netherlands in 1654.<br>
<br>As an avowed royalist Quin was ejected from his studentship by the parliamentary visitors in 1648. Anthony Wood, who was acquainted with him, often heard him &#145;sing with great admiration&#146;. His voice was a bass, &#145;the best &hellip; in England&#146;, but &#145;he wanted skill and could scarce sing in consort&#146;. He contrived to obtain an introduction to Cromwell, who was so delighted with his musical talent that, &#145;liquored by him with sack&#146;, he restored him to his place at Christ Church  (<span class="italic">Life and Times of Anthony Wood</span>, 1.287). In 1651 he was reported to be &#145;non compos&#146;. He died in October 1659, in a crazed condition, in his bedmaker's house in Penny Farthing Street in Oxford, and was buried in the cathedral of Christ Church.<br>
