<span class="headword">Peake, Sir  Charles Brinsley Pemberton</span>  (1897&#150;1958), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born on 2 January 1897 in Leicester, the third child and only son of Colonel William Pemberton Peake, surgeon and medical officer, of Hildenborough, Kent, and his wife, Alice Ambrosing Bucknell. Educated at Wyggeston School, Leicester, he took a commission as a captain in the Leicestershire regiment in 1914. During the war he was badly wounded in the leg and suffered from the effects for the remainder of his life. He was mentioned in dispatches and awarded the MC.<br>
<br>In 1919 Peake entered Magdalen College, Oxford, where he took a shortened course as a war service candidate, and emerged with a degree in French in 1921. He entered the diplomatic service as a third secretary in February 1922 and served in the British legation in Sofia from April 1922 to April 1924, when he returned to the Foreign Office in London. He was promoted second secretary in July 1925, and was briefly attached to the embassy in Constantinople, from October to December 1925. On 3 July 1926 he married Catherine Marie, daughter of William George Knight, of the Indian educational service. They had four sons.<br>
<br>In October 1926 Peake was transferred to the British embassy in Tokyo; he was granted an allowance for knowledge of Japanese in May 1928. From June 1929 until February 1933 he served in Bern, where at various points he acted as charg&eacute; d'affaires. He then served in Paris, where he was promoted first secretary in July 1934. He &#145;profited greatly from the opportunities offered by what was at that time the most important and stimulating post in the service&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 11 April 1958), but in October 1936, at his own request, he was transferred to the news department of the Foreign Office which was then headed by Rex Leeper. This combination became known affectionately as &#145;Leak and Peeper&#146; and by the time Peake succeeded Leeper in 1939 it was not a secret that he had become deeply convinced of the unwisdom of appeasement and of the need to galvanize the nation to the task of confronting Nazism. Contemporaries record that his dislike of the then prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, was considerable, so it is ironic that his next appointment, in January 1941, should have been that of personal assistant to the new ambassador to Washington, Lord Halifax, who had maintained a faith in appeasement which rivalled Chamberlain's. However, both men shared a deep commitment to Anglo-Catholicism, and despite the brevity of the appointment this period cemented a personal and lifelong friendship. Peake was appointed CMG in January 1941 and promoted counsellor in October the same year. On his return from Washington in February 1942, he was appointed British representative with the French national committee, where his considerable skills at personal diplomacy were amply tested and admirably deployed in smoothing the often fractious and capricious General de Gaulle. Between October 1943 and May 1945 he was political adviser to the supreme commander, Allied Expeditionary Force, with the personal rank of minister. In May 1945 he was appointed consul-general in Tangier where, despite his post, he was largely engaged in political work.<br>
<br>By temperament and ability, Peake preferred dealing with people rather than official papers, and these skills proved invaluable during his posting as ambassador to Belgrade between August 1946 and October 1951. The Balkans provided a rich background for Peake's innate flamboyancy and he established good working relations with several of the region's politicians, most notably Anna Pauker, then Romania's foreign minister. Sensitive to the nuances of the Soviet Union's relations with its satellites, he was among the first western observers to grasp the significance of rising tension in Yugoslav&#150;Soviet relations during the spring of 1948. Following Yugoslavia's expulsion from the Cominform, he capitalized on the opportunity to smooth the Anglo-Yugoslav relationship which had been strained since the war, and to establish closer relations with Marshal Tito than would otherwise have been possible. He was advanced to KCMG in June 1948. In October 1951 he was appointed ambassador to Athens where he was equally successful until Anglo-Greek relations became overshadowed by the bitterness of the dispute over Cyprus. Peake retired from the foreign service in April 1957 and acted for a time as special adviser to the Colonial Office on Cyprus.<br>
<br>Peake was gifted with an imaginative mind and an excellent memory which he cultivated through wide reading. These qualities combined with a sharp wit and dramatic sense to form a brilliant raconteur who was widely regarded as delightful company:<blockquote>He loved expounding the intricacies of a given problem, and he would do it always in a way that was both lucid and agreeably flattering to his hearer, as though there was nothing really new in it all, but a reminder of known facts might be useful. (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 11 April 1958)</blockquote>Openly and sincerely religious, he was fondly remembered as a generous host and a loyal friend. Throughout his career he was ably assisted by his wife. He died in London on 10 April 1958.<br>
