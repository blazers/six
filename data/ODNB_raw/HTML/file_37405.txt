<span class="headword">Eyre,  Charles Petre</span>  (1817&#150;1902), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic archbishop of Glasgow</span>, was born on 7 November 1817 at York, the fifth of nine children and third of five sons of John Lewis Eyre (1789&#150;1880), later a director of the South Western Railway Company, and his wife, Sara Parker (1790/91&#150;1825), daughter of William Parker of Kingston upon Thames. After his mother's death, Eyre's father married Augustine Cecile Pulcherie (<i>d</i>. 1876), daughter of Armand Dumesniel, marquis de Sommery, in 1828. The Eyre family had been settled in Derbyshire since the thirteenth century, but had lost most of their lands by confiscation at the Reformation. They maintained their Catholic allegiance, however, and four of the five sons and one grandson of John Lewis Eyre were ordained priest. His two elder brothers having predeceased him, Charles Eyre succeeded to the papal title of count of the Lateran Hall on his father's death on 11 November 1880.<br>
<br>On 28 March 1826 Eyre entered St Cuthbert's College, Ushaw, near Durham, where his great-uncle, Thomas Eyre, had been president. He was made deacon in May 1838, entered the English College, Rome, in December 1839, and was ordained at Rome on 19 March 1842. His working life was spent in almost equal parts between north-east England (twenty-six years), and Glasgow (thirty-three years). He was appointed to Newcastle in 1843; and to Wooler in 1849. Illness between May 1850 and July 1856 compelled him to undertake light work at Haggerstone Castle near Berwick upon Tweed, before returning to Newcastle. In 1868 he was appointed vicar-general of Hexham and Newcastle.<br>
<br>Eyre had already been identified as a future bishop, having been proposed for Hexham, and as coadjutor-archbishop of Sydney, Australia, in 1866. He was not, however, the first candidate proposed for the western district of Scotland in 1869. Indeed, Michael O'Sullivan of Birmingham was all but appointed before Henry Manning, archbishop of Westminster, submitted Eyre's name to Rome. Other candidates included the Redemptorists Robert Coffin and Edward Bridgett, and Bernard O'Reilly (later bishop of Liverpool). Eyre was nominated as delegate-apostolic for Scotland on 29 November 1868, titular archbishop of Anazarbus on 11 December 1868, and consecrated in Rome on 31 January 1869. On 16 April 1869, his appointment as administrator-apostolic of the western district of Scotland was confirmed.<br>
<br>Eyre arrived in Glasgow on 9 March 1869, with the twin task of preparing for the restoration of a diocesan hierarchy in Scotland, and to restore calm to the western district, which was deeply divided by tension between Scots and Irish Catholics. He attended the First Vatican Council in 1869&#150;70, and he embarked on an extensive programme of school and church building. In 1874, he opened a local seminary, St Peter's College. Although his tenure of office as administrator-apostolic was not without an initially unsettled period, he was presented with an address in 1876, from Scots- and Irish-born clergy, commending the progress of the previous seven years.<br>
<br>Eyre developed an ultramontane identity among his people. But he did not share the view of some northern district clergy, who remained unconvinced of the need for a diocesan hierarchy, viewing it as inserting an intermediary into hitherto direct links with Rome through the Congregatio de Propaganda Fide. With the ending in 1878 of the system of districts and vicariates-apostolic, he became archbishop of the restored archdiocese of Glasgow on 15 March of that year. His archdiocese included Motherwell and Paisley which later became dioceses (1948). Archdiocesan synods were held in 1881, 1888, and 1897, at which Eyre continued to promote schemes for the division of missions, which were almost dioceses in themselves. A cathedral chapter was erected in 1884.<br>
<br>The archbishop wrote extensively on historical and religious matters, including his <span class="italic">History of St Cuthbert</span>, first published in 1849, which reached a revised third edition in 1887. He also wrote <span class="italic">Children of the Bible</span>, a collection of leaflet lives of Scottish saints, and papers on the medieval cathedral of Glasgow. Eyre sought to have the Catholic community accepted as an integral part of Scottish life, and his efforts were recognized when he was made LLD by the University of Glasgow in 1892. In quite another sphere Eyre (with Michael Davitt) was among the early patrons of Celtic Football Club, founded in 1888. Eyre died at his home, 6 Bowmont Gardens, Glasgow, aged eighty-four, on 27 March 1902; he was buried on 31 March at St Peter's College, Bearsden, but has since been re-buried at St Andrew's Cathedral, Glasgow.<br>
