<span class="headword">Ewing,  Greville</span>  (1767&#150;1841), <span class="occ">Congregational minister</span>, the youngest son of Alexander Ewing, a teacher of mathematics, and his wife, Jacobina, was born on 27 April 1767 in the parish of Old Greyfriars, Edinburgh. He studied with considerable distinction at the high school and university there, and then decided, much against his father's wishes, to prepare for the ministry of the Church of Scotland. He was ordained in 1793 as associate minister of Lady Glenorchy's Chapel, Edinburgh, where he soon acquired wide popularity as a preacher. Missions attracted much of Ewing's attention, and in 1796 he took an active part in the formation of the Edinburgh Missionary Society, becoming its first secretary. He was also co-founder of the <span class="italic">Missionary Magazine</span>, which he edited for three years from its foundation in 1796. When Robert Haldane of Airthrey planned a mission to India, Ewing was appointed to go out, but the directors of the East India Company refused to sanction the undertaking, and it was abandoned. His association with the Haldanes involved him in an itinerant mission during the winter of 1798 on behalf of the newly formed Society for Propagating the Gospel at Home, and subsequently in the establishment of preaching centres in many parts of Scotland.<br>
<br>Finding the Church of Scotland inflexible, Ewing resigned his ministry at Lady Glenorchy's Chapel in 1798 and left the church. In July 1799 he became minister of the Glasgow Tabernacle, which connection he retained until 1836. Ewing embraced Congregational principles wholeheartedly and engaged in disputes with the Haldanes over church order and baptism. He defended his position in print in 1807 and 1809, and published <span class="italic">An Essay on Baptism</span> in 1823.<br>
<br>Ewing assisted in the foundation of the Glasgow Theological Academy in 1809 and of the Congregational Union of Scotland in 1812. He remained a tutor at the academy until 1836, training the first generation of Scottish Congregational ministers in moderate Calvinism. He did much to promote the study of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> in the original languages, publishing in 1801 a Greek grammar and lexicon for students of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> which ran to several editions. In 1821 he was awarded a DD by Princeton College, New Jersey.<br>
<br>Ewing married three times. His first wife, Anne Innes of Gifford, whom he married on 13 November 1794, died nine months later. In 1799 he married Janet Jamieson, who died on 18 January 1801, having borne a daughter, Ewing's only child. He married third, on 15 November 1802, Barbara, daughter of Sir James Maxwell, sixth baronet, of Pollok, and Frances Colquhoun; she died on 14 September 1828 as the result of an accident at the Falls of Clyde. Ewing published a memoir of her, which reached a second edition in 1829.<br>
<br>During the last few years of his life Ewing was in poor health, and had to discontinue his regular work. He died suddenly on 2 August 1841 in Glasgow, and was buried on 6 August at Eastwood.<br>
