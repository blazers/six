<span class="headword">Peake,  Arthur Samuel</span>  (1865&#150;1929), <span class="occ">theologian and biblical scholar</span>, was born at Leek, Staffordshire, on 24 November 1865, the second son and third child in a family of seven of the Revd Samuel Peake (1830&#150;1914), a Primitive Methodist minister, and his wife, Rosabella Smith (<i>d</i>. 1875), the daughter of a Herefordshire farmer. In accordance with the custom of the Methodist ministry, his father moved frequently from one circuit to another, and Peake was educated at various day schools, including Ludlow grammar school (1874), and a school in Stratford upon Avon (1876). From 1877 he attended King Henry VIII Grammar School, Coventry, before going up to St John's College, Oxford, in 1883, with a classical scholarship. After classical honour moderations he read for the honour school of theology, with a view to ordination in the Church of England. He obtained a first class in 1887, and continued to reside after graduation, winning the Denyer and Johnson scholarship in 1889 and the Ellerton essay prize in 1890. He was not, however, ordained, remaining a Methodist layman for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>In 1890 Peake was elected to a theological fellowship at Merton College, a position which he held for seven years. Earlier in the same year he had begun teaching at Mansfield College, which had been established at Oxford in 1886 for the training of candidates for the ministry of the free churches. His work here was mainly in the field of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, though he was also interested in the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> and in early church history, especially in the Gnostics, Manichaeans, and Montanists. His distinctive contribution to biblical studies was possible only to one who was a master of more than one field.<br>
<br>Peake's future career, however, was soon decided by a call from his own church. The Primitive Methodists had been slow to make provision for the theological training of their ministry. A group of reformers, with the financial backing of William Hartley, a wealthy manufacturer from Aintree, decided to turn the existing Theological Institute at Manchester into a college with a full and modern theological curriculum. On the foundation of Hartley Primitive Methodist College at Manchester, Peake was asked to take responsibility for the curriculum, with the position of tutor in the college. After some hesitation, and against the advice of some of his friends, he accepted the post. He went to Manchester in 1892, and for the remaining thirty-seven years of his life he was identified with Hartley College. Initially his theological position was regarded with suspicion as dangerously &#145;advanced&#146;: already as a student he had made himself familiar with German theological works and had been particularly influenced by the writings of W. Robertson Smith. But by the time of his death he held a position of almost unique authority in his church, and the higher intellectual standard of its ministry, and the broader outlook of its members in general, were largely the result of Peake's teaching and influence.<br>
<br>Peake's work at Manchester was not confined to a denominational college. In 1904 it was decided to form a faculty of theology in the University of Manchester. The first theological faculty to be established in any of the &#145;secular&#146; universities, it had from the outset an interdenominational character. Peake played a leading part in the establishment of the faculty, and became the first occupant of the Rylands chair of biblical criticism and exegesis, while retaining his appointment at Hartley College.<br>
<br>In addition to his academic work, Peake served as chairman of the council of the John Rylands Library, from its foundation in 1899 until his death. He edited the <span class="italic">Holborn Review</span> from 1919 until his death, and took an active part in the ecclesiastical affairs of his own church, and of the free churches in general, strongly supporting the movement for reunion, both among the Methodist bodies and outside them. These numerous activities were carried out under the handicap of uncertain health: in 1902, he underwent a serious operation for the removal of a cyst attached to his liver, which permanently affected his health. A severe breakdown from overwork followed in 1915, and his health was very poor from 1921.<br>
<br>Peake's knowledge of current literature, both British and foreign, in the field of biblical studies, was exhaustive. His original contributions to biblical learning were marked by accurate scholarship and balanced and cautious judgement. He saw the <span class="roman">Bible</span> as the record of God's progressive self-revelation in history and held that the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> witnessed to a developing system of belief and practice. He was thus able to reconcile Christian faith with historical criticism and with the Victorian belief in progress. Such books as <span class="italic">The Bible: its Origin, its Significance, and its Abiding Worth</span> (1913), and <span class="italic">The Problem of Suffering in the Old Testament</span> (1904), together with a <span class="italic">Commentary on the Bible</span> (1919) which he planned and edited, had a wide circulation and very great influence, helping many conservative Christians to come to terms with the consequences of recent biblical criticism. He also did much to save the free churches of Great Britain from the baneful effects of &#145;fundamentalist&#146; controversies.<br>
<br>Peake married on 29 June 1892 Harriet Mary (<i>b</i>. 1867/8), daughter of John Sillman, of Oxford, who survived him together with their three sons. He received the honorary degree of DD from the University of Aberdeen in 1907, and from the University of Oxford in 1920. He died at the Royal Infirmary, Manchester, on 19 August 1929, and was buried in the southern cemetery, Manchester.<br>
