<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hamilton <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Hammill]</span>,  (Mary) Cicely</span>  (1872&#150;1952), <span class="occ">writer and campaigner for women's rights</span>, was born on 15 June 1872 at 15 Sussex Gardens, Paddington, London, the eldest of four children of an Irish mother, Maude Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Piers, and an Anglo-Scottish father, Denzil Hammill. Cicely Hammill was educated privately at St Leonard's boarding-school in Malvern and at Bad Homburg, a small spa town in Germany. She worked as a student teacher in the midlands and then as an actress touring the country for some ten years, changing her name to Hamilton when she first went on the stage.<br>
<br>Hamilton joined the suffragettes of the Pankhursts' Women's Social and Political Union and wrote the words anonymously for the WSPU anthem, &#145;The March of the Women&#146;. She also worked for Charlotte Despard's Women's Freedom League and edited their paper, <span class="italic">The Vote</span>. Hamilton became a popular and effective public speaker for the women's suffrage campaign. The <span class="italic">Common Cause</span> of 13 April 1911 wrote that she &#145;dramatised for us the revolt of the idealistic woman against compulsory self-sacrifice. Her wit and her beauty and her beautiful dress all contributed to the impression that a woman is a thing of great value&#146;  (p. 5).<br>
<br>As well as suffrage, the great passion of Hamilton's early years was the theatre, where she experienced prejudice against women actors and playwrights at first hand. Her first stage play, <span class="italic">Diana of Dobson's</span> (1908), was produced at the Kingsway Theatre by one of London's first actress-managers, the suffragette Lena Ashwell. The heroine, Diana, is a shop assistant who wagers that a wealthy suitor who proposes to her is incapable of earning his own living for six months. In the same year Hamilton founded the Women Writers' Suffrage League with the writer Bessie Hatton, and the Actresses' Franchise League with the actress Elizabeth Robins. <span class="italic">How the Vote was Won</span> (1909), a one-act comedy, was co-authored with her close friend Christabel Marshall who wrote under the name of Christopher St John. The play is a modern version of <span class="italic">Lysistrata</span> set at the time of a women's general strike and ridicules the notion of coverture whereby English law assumed a woman to come under the protection of her nearest male relative. The drawing-room of Horace Cole, a clerk of modest means, is invaded by a series of distant, and hitherto economically self-sufficient, female relatives, each intent on persuading Horace to support her.<br>
<br>Hamilton's strongly-held convictions about women and economics were developed in her treatise <span class="italic">Marriage as a Trade</span> (1909), a robustly forthright, witty, and uncompromising outburst of indignation against the Edwardian family and the tyranny of marriage which women were often compelled to enter because it was the only trade for which they had received any training. In 1910 Hamilton was invited by the actress Edy Craig to write <span class="italic">A Pageant of Great Women</span>. The pageant, enthusiastically performed by women in London and in venues across the country, demonstrated the capacity to exercise leadership and featured fifty-two great women including Joan of Arc. Some parts were played by very well-known actresses including Ellen Terry. The other plays Hamilton published were <span class="italic">Jack and Jill and a Friend</span> (1911); <span class="italic">The Cutting Knot</span> (1911), which was turned into a novel as <span class="italic">A Matter of Money</span> (1916); a nativity play, <span class="italic">The Child in Flanders</span>, performed in 1917 and published later; <span class="italic">The Brave and the Fair</span> (1920); <span class="italic">The Old Adam</span>, also performed as <span class="italic">The Human Factor</span> (1926); and a play for children, <span class="italic">The Beggar Prince</span> (1936).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Just to Get Married</span> (1911) was her first novel, and explored the duplicitous behaviour of women desperate to get married. The heroine Georgina Vicary who has consented to a marriage of convenience comes to admire her suitor and marries for love. <span class="italic">Just to Get Married</span> was turned into a play. During the First World War Hamilton served with the Scottish women's ambulance unit and as an administrator in a military hospital outside Paris and from 1917 to 1919 she was a member of a repertory company organized by her friend Lena Ashwell which provided wartime entertainment for the troops. <span class="italic">Senlis</span> (1916) is a tribute to a small town which had been treated with great brutality by the Germans. Hamilton's experiences of the war made her disillusioned with the idea that human progress was inevitable, and she came to dislike what she termed as &#145;the herd instinct&#146; and became impatient with some of the more liberal ideals of her youth. <span class="italic">William: an Englishman</span> (1919) won the Femina Vie Heureuse prize. William, an idealistic socialist, and Griselda, an altruistic young suffragette, find themselves accidentally caught up in the outbreak of the First World War during their honeymoon in the Ardennes. When Griselda is brutally raped and murdered William comes to see his earlier beliefs as na&iuml;ve in the extreme and is converted to wholehearted support of the war effort. <span class="italic">Theodore Savage</span> (1922) is a curious dystopian novel which is set at the end of civilization and again illustrates the human potential for destructive behaviour.<br>
<br>Hamilton's commitment to equality did not waver. In 1919 she became press officer for the International Suffrage Conference in Geneva. She supported herself as a journalist writing for newspapers including the <span class="italic">Yorkshire Post</span> and the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, served on the editorial committee of <span class="italic">The Englishwoman</span>, and became a director of Lady Rhondda's feminist journal <span class="italic">Time and Tide</span>, through which she met Winifred Holtby. She also became a close friend of Lilian Baylis with whom she wrote a history of the Old Vic (1926). In the 1920s she was an early and active member of the Six Point Group which campaigned for the rights of children, widows, and unmarried mothers, equal guardianship, and equal pay in teaching and the civil service. She was also an impassioned advocate of birth control and a supporter of abortion law reform.<br>
<br>In 1931 Hamilton published <span class="italic">Full Stop</span>, an extraordinary novel which contained only one character and was concerned with the spiritual crisis of a politician who knows that he is nearing his death. Throughout the 1930s Hamilton travelled widely and published a series of commentaries on her impressions of Austria, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Russia, and Sweden, and nearer to home, England and Scotland. Her autobiography, <span class="italic">Life Errant</span> (1935), was critical of her belief in the perfectibility of human beings in her early career although not of her commitment to feminism or of her decision to remain a spinster. She was awarded a civil-list pension for services to literature in 1938. <span class="italic">Lament for Democracy</span> (1940), published at a moment when the Second World War fared badly for the allies, was pessimistic about the fragility of democracy when faced with the threat of totalitarianism. Hamilton worked as the editor of the press bulletin of the British League for European Freedom from 1945 to 1952. She died from heart failure, after a long illness, on 5 December 1952 at her home, 44 Glebe Place, Chelsea, London.<br>
