<span class="headword">Stanley,  Montague</span>  (1809&#150;1844), <span class="occ">actor and landscape painter</span>, was born in Dundee on 5 January 1809. His father served in the Royal Navy and he was sent, with his wife and young son, to New York in March 1810. He died about 1812, and in 1816 his widow remarried and moved to Halifax in Nova Scotia. At this time Montague Stanley showed an interest in the theatre and received notice for his role as Ariel in <span class="italic">The Tempest</span>. In 1817 the family moved to Kingston, Jamaica; two years later his stepfather died of yellow fever. Montague Stanley sailed for Liverpool in 1819 with his mother, stepbrother, and stepsister. The family first settled in Suffolk and later in Lancashire.<br>
<br>In 1824 Stanley received his first engagement as an actor in York, using the stage name Mr Manby. In 1826 he joined W. H. Murray's company in Edinburgh. Described as a very handsome young man and a good singer, he appeared in both acting and singing roles. He played in further seasons in Edinburgh, then also in Dublin in 1830 and London in 1832 and 1833. In 1834 he joined the Theatre Royal in Edinburgh, where he remained for the rest of his theatrical career. He was considered a sound and judicious actor, his renderings were sensible, and he never offended, but he was criticized for a certain coldness and stiffness of action. During these years he became profoundly affected by Christianity and decided to leave the theatre on religious and moral grounds. His final stage performance was in Edinburgh, playing Laertes to Charles Kean's Hamlet.<br>
<br>Stanley had no formal training as an artist. He first made copies, but by the mid-1820s he had begun to draw from nature and he received some instruction in landscape painting from John Ewbank. He first exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy in 1828 and from 1834 he was a regular exhibitor until his early death. After his retirement from the stage he made a living by teaching the flute, elocution, fencing, drawing, and painting. However, his ambitions were to become a full-time painter. First elected an honorary member of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1835, he was made an associate in 1838 in recognition of his talents. His landscapes present a Romantic interpretation of Scottish scenery in the manner of Horatio McCulloch. He painted in the highlands and in Cadzow Forest, Lanarkshire, and also in Wales and the Lake District. His works survive as book illustrations, for example as sixty wood-engravings in Sir Thomas Dick Lauder's 1842 edition of Uvedale Price's <span class="italic">On the Picturesque</span>. Unfortunately after his death many of his paintings were destroyed in a fire on a train which was carrying them to Edinburgh for auction.<br>
<br>In 1834 Stanley married into a respectable Edinburgh family, which perhaps hastened the demise of his acting career. At the beginning of 1844 he secured a house, Ascog Tower, at Ascog in Bute which afforded views to the Clyde near Rothesay. It enjoyed a more temperate climate than Edinburgh, a matter of importance as Stanley's health was causing concern. In January 1844 he paid his last visit to Edinburgh, and on 4 May he died at home of consumption. He was buried in the churchyard at Ascog, and was survived by his wife and seven young children.<br>
