<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Struthers, Sir  John</span>  (1823&#150;1899), <span class="occ">anatomist and medical reformer</span>, second son of Alexander Struthers, a wealthy flax mill owner, and his wife, Mary Reid, was born at Brucefield, Dunfermline, Fife, on 21 February 1823, and was educated privately. His two brothers qualified in medicine: James (1821&#150;1891) practised in Leith, and Alexander (1830&#150;1855) died at Scutari during the Crimean campaign while serving as an assistant surgeon. John Struthers studied medicine at Edinburgh University, where he was admitted successively a licentiate and a fellow of the College of Surgeons and a doctor of medicine of the university in 1845. On 22 October 1847 the College of Surgeons certified him to teach anatomy in an extramural school; Struthers substituted for Professor John Goodsir during his illness in the winter of 1853&#150;4.<br>
<br>In 1854 Struthers was appointed one of the assistant surgeons to the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary and was later full surgeon, an office he resigned in 1863 when he was appointed to the chair of anatomy at Aberdeen. The University of Aberdeen had begun a new existence on 15 September 1860 by the fusion of Marischal and King's colleges. Divinity and arts were taught at King's in Old Aberdeen and law and medicine in Simpson's building in Aberdeen itself. The accommodation, however, was meagre, and the students were few when Struthers began his work. Under the provisions of the <span class="roman">Universities (Scotland) Act</span> of 1858 the buildings of Aberdeen University were maintained by the board of works. Struthers made good use of this to have extensive new accommodation constructed for his anatomy department. This was at a time when the Royal Infirmary generally was being greatly enlarged and was well known for its clinical teaching. Struthers built up a museum of anatomy and established a university medal and prize in the subject in 1891; by the time he retired to Edinburgh in 1889 the number of students had more than doubled and the museum was almost unequalled.<br>
<br>Struthers was a skilled anatomist, and one of the earliest advocates in Scotland of the Darwinian hypothesis of natural selection. Aberdeen students were noted for championing Darwinism; even the keeper of the anatomy room was an out-and-out evolutionist. Struthers taught anatomy from a comparative perspective and his lectures were illustrated with his extensive collection of specimens that demonstrated Darwinian evolution. He was a keen dissector and a firm believer in practical work in all aspects of medical education.<br>
<br>In Edinburgh, Struthers became chairman of the board of directors of Leith Hospital and was elected a manager of the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. He was a member and president of the Royal Physical Society, and a member of the board of management of the Royal Dispensary, Edinburgh. In 1885 the University of Glasgow conferred upon him the honorary degree of LLD. He was president of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh from 1895 to 1897. He was knighted in 1898.<br>
<br>On 5 August 1857 Struthers married Christina Margaret, daughter of James Alexander, surgeon, of Wooler, Northumberland. Struthers and his wife were both champions of the cause of admission of women to the Scottish universities. They had five sons and four daughters. Three of his sons qualified in medicine. Two predeceased him; the youngest, John William Struthers (1874&#150;1959), was a general surgeon in Edinburgh and president of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh from 1941 to 1943. Struthers died on 24 February 1899 at his home, 15 George Square, Edinburgh, and was buried on the 27th in Warriston cemetery, Edinburgh. He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Struthers's most valuable scientific works are papers on the supracondyloid process and on the anatomy of whales. Whaling was an important local industry, and from time to time whole carcasses were washed up on the shore of eastern Scotland. Their dissection provided Struthers with the opportunity to elucidate and demonstrate an example of mammalian adaptation to life in the sea.<br>
<br>Struthers had a long interest in the reform of the medical curriculum. As a member of the General Medical Council from 1883 to 1891 and particularly as chairman of the education committee he sought to introduce measures to increase practical and clinical teaching and to ensure a rational ordering of the subjects of the medical course. This culminated in the extension of the medical course to five years in 1892. At Aberdeen he pressed for a compulsory pathology course and a chair of pathology. In the early 1870s he had encouraged students to nominate T. H. Huxley as university rector knowing that Huxley shared his belief in the need for curricular reform.<br>
