<span class="headword">Meyer, Sir  Anthony John Charles</span>, third baronet  (1920&#150;2004), <span class="occ">diplomatist and politician</span>, was born on 27 October 1920 at 33 Connaught Square, London, the only child of Sir Frank Cecil Meyer, second baronet (1886&#150;1935), businessman and politician, and his wife, (Marjorie Amy) Georgina, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Seeley (<i>d</i>. 1961), second daughter of Frederick Seeley, of Hale, Cheshire. His father was London chairman of De Beers, a director of the National Bank of Egypt, and Conservative MP for Great Yarmouth from 1924 to 1929. His father (Anthony's grandfather), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47715/', "Sir Carl Ferdinard Meyer, first baronet (1851&#150;1922)")</script>, a Jewish immigrant from Hamburg who had made his fortune with the Rothschilds, was given the baronetcy in 1910 after a sizeable donation to the project for the building of a national theatre.<br>
<br>In 1935, eight days before his fifteenth birthday, and while still a student at Eton College, Meyer inherited the baronetcy on his father's death in a riding accident. His university career at New College, Oxford, was curtailed by the outbreak of the Second World War. He joined the Scots Guards, but while serving as a first lieutenant near Caen in July 1944 he was struck by shrapnel, which lodged near his spine. Wound infection meant he had to spend the rest of the war in hospital, where he was helped back to health by his wife, Barbadee Violet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Knight (the only child of Athro Charles Knight, solicitor), whom he had married in Eton College chapel on 30 October 1941, when she was nineteen and he twenty-one. They had three daughters, Carolyn (<i>b</i>. 1943), Tessa (<i>b</i>. 1955), and Sally (<i>b</i>. 1961), and a son, Ashley (<i>b</i>. 1944).<br>
<br>Meyer's military experience convinced him both of the futility of war and of the need for political integration in Europe. After demobilization, rather than returning to Oxford he entered the civil service, via a temporary post at the Treasury, transferring to the foreign service in 1947, and serving as first secretary at the Paris embassy for five enjoyable years between 1951 and 1956. A posting to Moscow was cut short after the KGB had attempted to compromise him. On his return to London he served first in the economic relations department (1956&#150;8) and then in the western organizations department (1958&#150;62) of the Foreign Office.<br>
<br>In 1962 Meyer resigned from the Foreign Office to pursue a political career. After a short spell as director of research for the Common Market Campaign, he sprang a surprise at the 1964 general election, gaining the marginal seat of Eton and Slough for the Conservatives from the Labour incumbent&#151;the left-winger Fenner Brockway&#151;by eleven votes. During his short spell in parliament (he was defeated by Joan Lestor at the 1966 general election) he quickly gained a reputation as a liberal, voting to abolish the death penalty and in favour of oil sanctions against Rhodesia. Such a reputation made it hard for him to gain selection for another seat, but at the sixth attempt, and with the help of the retiring MP, Nigel Birch, he returned to parliament in 1970 as MP for West Flintshire. In 1972 he was appointed parliamentary private secretary to his close friend Maurice Macmillan, first as chief secretary to the Treasury, and then (until the Conservatives' defeat in the 1974 general election) as secretary of state for employment. It would be Meyer's only post in government.<br>
<br>Instead, Meyer reinforced his reputation as an independent-minded back-bencher, calling for a coalition government to be headed by Roy Jenkins after the first general election of 1974, and defying the Tory whip on devolution a few years later. In 1982 he opposed the use of force in the Falkland Islands, &#145;just to ensure that the Union Jack&#151;the Union Jack alone&#151;flies over what would be left of public buildings&#146;  (Meyer, 89). Such was the right-wing chagrin at Meyer's behaviour that Beata Brookes, a Thatcherite member of the European parliament, attempted to oust him from his redrawn Clwyd North West constituency in 1983. Meyer took the matter to court, and won.<br>
<br>As early as 1985 Meyer was calling for Margaret Thatcher to step down as tory leader. He was everything that she despised about the old tory party: a self-confessed &#145;old-fashioned, sloppy wet&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 8 Jan 2005), and a passionate advocate of closer British integration in Europe. Indeed, it was Meyer's immense frustration with Thatcher's policy on Europe, particularly in the late 1980s, that provoked him to stand against her for the Conservative leadership in November 1989, her first challenge in fifteen years. He described himself as a &#145;burnt offering&#146; rather than a stalking horse, hoping that a more senior figure would mount a challenge  (Meyer, 163). In the event, no one else was prepared to stand. The press derided him as &#145;Sir Nobody&#146; and &#145;the stalking donkey&#146;  (ibid.). But Meyer, who never lacked courage, persisted. Thatcher's margin of victory&#151;314 votes to 33, with 24 spoiled ballot papers (and three non-voters)&#151;was seen as clear-cut at the time. However, sixty MPs, one sixth of the parliamentary party, had refused to back the prime minister. In retrospect, Meyer's challenge punctured Thatcher's apparent invincibility; or, as Meyer commented later, &#145;It made the unthinkable thinkable&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 8 Jan 2005). Indeed, it was the start of a process that led to a much more serious, and ultimately decisive, challenge the following year.<br>
<br>Retribution against Meyer was swift. He was ostracized by many parliamentary colleagues and deselected (by 206 votes to 107) by his local constituency association. Media revelations followed of his twenty-five-year relationship with Simone Washington, a West Indian model and blues singer. After leaving parliament in 1992 he remained committed to the European cause as a patron of the European&#150;Atlantic Movement, a policy director of the European Movement, and the author of <span class="italic">A Federal Europe: Why Not</span> (1992). (He had published the semi-autobiographical <span class="italic">Stand Up and Be Counted</span> two years previously.) However, his support for the Pro-European Conservative Party at the 1999 European parliamentary elections resulted in complete failure. In any event, Meyer had never relied on politics for his living, having inherited a considerable fortune on the death of his mother, and also earning an income as a Lloyd's underwriter. He died at his home, 9 Cottage Place, Chelsea, London, on 24 December 2004, of colonic cancer. He was survived by his wife, Barbadee, and their four children, and was succeeded as baronet by his son, Ashley.<br>
