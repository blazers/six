<span class="headword">Rawlinson,  Thomas</span>  (1681&#150;1725), <span class="occ">book collector</span>, was born on 25 March 1681 in the Old Bailey in the parish of St Sepulchre, London, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23194/', "Sir Thomas Rawlinson (bap. 1647, d. 1708)")</script>, vintner and later lord mayor of London, and Mary (1661/2&#150;1725), the eldest daughter of Richard Taylor of Turnham Green, Middlesex. His brother, the nonjuror antiquary and collector <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23192/', "Richard Rawlinson (1690&#150;1755)")</script>, was the fourth son. Thomas was educated at Mr Day's school in Cheam, Surrey, and at Eton College until 1698. While still at Eton he was admitted a member of the Middle Temple in January 1696 or 1697. He matriculated from St John's College, Oxford, on 25 February 1699 and stayed until December 1701, but did not take a degree. After a tour through England and the Low Countries he returned to study municipal law at the Middle Temple. On 19 May 1705 he was called to the bar and the next year he was appointed a governor of Bridewell and Bethlem hospitals, of which his father became president soon after. He was made governor of St Bartholomew's Hospital on 7 July 1712. His inclination to practise law was minimal. It had been his passion for some time to collect books and manuscripts (he received an annuity for books from his grandfather Richard Taylor) and he pursued this occupation almost exclusively after inheriting his father's estates, becoming the &#145;<i>Leviathan</i> of book-collectors during nearly the first thirty years of the eighteenth century&#146;  (Dibdin, 458).<br>
<br>Rawlinson collected both at home and abroad, mainly in the Netherlands and Flanders, operating within a wide circle of antiquaries and collectors. He later fell out with rival collectors Edward Harley and John Murray, but worked closely with John Bagford, Thomas Hearne, Michael Maittaire, and Richard Mead. In 1712 Bishop William Nicolson asked him for corrections for a new edition of his <span class="italic">English Historical Library</span> (1714), and Maittaire acknowledged his assistance in his edition of Juvenal (1716). Joseph Ames and Maittaire owed much to Rawlinson's collections for their studies of early printing. Rawlinson also had a formative influence on the collecting and antiquarianism of his younger brother Richard. In 1717 he joined Hearne in a tour of Berkshire, and the next year both Rawlinsons undertook a perambulation of Oxfordshire for Richard's proposed antiquarian history of that county. Richard's <span class="italic">English Topographer</span> (1720) is largely a catalogue of Thomas's topographical materials. In 1713 Thomas became a member of the Royal Society and in 1724 of the Society of Antiquaries.<br>
<br>Rawlinson had a close relationship with the Oxford antiquary Thomas Hearne. They shared a love of antiquarian study and collecting and, as nonjurors and Jacobites, a deep-seated disaffection with the age they lived in. Both had outspoken and acrid temperaments: &#145;This Age (says my Friend) wants Monitors to Goodness, God knows; nay, ev'n severe ones, to scare th<sup>m</sup> out of ill Practises. I do my part in speaking; You, whose Pen is happier, by your Immortal Writings&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 7.178). They corresponded regularly, though unfortunately most of Rawlinson's letters to Hearne are not extant. Rawlinson almost every month sent boxes filled with books, manuscripts, and fragments for Hearne to evaluate. Hearne copied parts of Rawlinson's notebooks into his diaries and thus preserved some impression of Rawlinson as a bibliographer. Hearne much appreciated Rawlinson's classical, antiquarian, and bibliographical knowledge, and depended to an important extent on his information and judgements.<br>
<br>Rawlinson attached great importance to Hearne's scholarly output, and acted as one of his agents, finding new subscribers, distributing books in his London circles, and advising his friend on his publishing projects. He provided Hearne with critical comments and materials for his edition of Leland's <span class="italic">Itinerary</span> (1710&#150;12), and with the manuscript for <span class="italic">Beverly</span> (1716). He was closely involved with the preparations and production processes of the editions of Camden's <span class="italic">Annals of Queen Elizabeth</span> (1717) and William of Newburgh's <span class="italic">Chronicle</span> (1719). On a personal level he repeatedly offered Hearne a place in London to help solve his friend's political problems at Oxford. Hearne dedicated the preface of his edition of John Rouse (1716) to Rawlinson. His diary entry for 4 September 1725 is a warm and appreciative biographical account of his friend.<br>
<br>In 1716 Rawlinson moved from London's Gray's Inn, where his chambers could no longer accommodate his collections and where he was forced to sleep in the passage, to the roomier London House in Aldersgate Street. Rawlinson's collecting activities were so intense that he accumulated vast debts and was forced to sell parts of his collections. He had neglected the administration of the Rawlinson estates, and, if information from William Oldisworth to Hearne can be relied upon, a late attempt to remedy his financial problems through investing in the disastrous South Sea stock only aggravated the situation. Six sales took place between 4 December 1721 and Rawlinson's death.<br>
<br>On 22 September 1724 Rawlinson married his servant Amy Frewin, formerly a servant in an Aldersgate Street coffee house. The marriage appears to have embarrassed his family, angered his creditors, and, according to Richard's account of his brother, led to &#145;the hastening of his own death&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. J 4&deg; 4, fols. 148&#150;50). It also caused friends to speculate about his wife's character and questionable reputation. Rawlinson was much plagued by the creditors, and under the increasing pressure his health deteriorated fast. Hearne reflected that the booksellers should be more lenient and should in fact erect a statue to him, as Rawlinson had furthered their trade by driving up the prices of books through his frequent and high bidding. He died on 6 August 1725 in London House, and was buried on 12 August in the parish of St Botolph, Aldersgate.<br>
<br>After Thomas's death his brother Richard returned from his travels in Europe. Under the terms of their father's will the entailed estates now devolved upon him. Thomas's will, however, complicated matters, as he had made over the family property to a nonjuror friend as his executor to hold in trust for his widow and possible heirs (there were no children). In order to secure the administration of the Rawlinson estates, Richard challenged the validity of the will. Forced to settle Thomas's debts and sell the entire collection, he organized eleven further auction sales in seven years. Nevertheless he was able to buy (and later retrieve) a great part of Thomas's books and manuscripts himself. What Richard thus salvaged finally came to the Bodleian Library, Oxford, in his great bequest to that institution and to the nation. Among other prominent purchasers at the sales were Lord Coleraine, Edward Harley, and James West.<br>
<br>The auction sales of Rawlinson's collections of books and manuscripts took place at St Paul's Coffee House, Bedford Coffee House, and London House, between 4 December 1721 and 4 March 1734, the last being the sale of the manuscripts. His paintings were sold separately in April 1734; his prints may have been sold individually or retained by Richard. Thus there were seventeen sales in total, each auction lasting on average twenty days; the auctioneers were Charles Davis and Thomas Ballard, the latter assisted by Anthony Barker. The Bodleian holds copies of all the sale catalogues, annotated with the prices realized and a few of the buyers' names. According to De Ricci it was &#145;the largest library as yet sold in England and, with the Heber library, the largest sold to the present day&#146; and comprised over 200,000 volumes  (De Ricci, 45); Enright quotes 50,000 volumes and over 1000 manuscripts for the later sales  (Enright, &#145;Later auction sales&#146;, 113). Among them were invaluable manuscripts and incunabula (his noteworthy collection of Caxtons), and choice Elzevier and Aldine editions of the classics, many with Rawlinson's characteristic collation mark, &#145;C&amp;P&#146; (collated and perfect). Prices at the sales were disappointingly low. This has been attributed to such factors as the sale arrangements, the great number of books released onto the market, the position and role of the booksellers, the condition of the items (often bad or imperfect), and the sales of other important collections in those years.<br>
<br>The value and &#145;omnigenous&#146; character of Rawlinson's collections, often praised by Hearne in his publications, long remained difficult to appreciate because of their sheer size and lack of organization (despite the sale catalogues compiled by Thomas) and the subsequent dispersal of the library. Rawlinson's reputation as an antiquarian collector also suffered because of the general lack of appreciation for the work of antiquaries, bibliographers, and collectors in the Augustan age. Well known is Joseph Addison's satirical description of Tom Folio in <span class="italic">The Tatler</span> (no. 158, 1710), which was reputedly a portrait of Thomas Rawlinson. Hearne robustly countered this view in his affectionate account of his friend:<blockquote>Some gave out, &amp; published it, too, in printed Papers, that Mr Rawlinson understood the Editions and Title-pages of Books only, without any other Skill in them, and thereupon they stiled him <i>Tom Folio</i>. But these were only Buffoons, and persons of very shallow Learning. 'Tis certain that Mr Rawlinson understood the Editions and Titles of Books better than any Man I ever knew (for he had a very great Memory), but then, besides this, he was a great Reader, and had read abundance of the best writers ancient and modern throughout, and was intirely master of the Learning contain'd in them. (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 9.20)</blockquote>
