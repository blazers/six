<span class="headword">Pagett <span class="st"> [Pagit]</span>,  Ephraim</span>  (1574&#150;1646), <span class="occ">heresiologist</span>, was baptized at Wold (Old), Northamptonshire, on 28 May 1574, the second of three children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21126/', "Eusebius Pagit (1546/7&#150;1617)")</script>, vicar of Lamport in the same county, and his wife, Anne Gyles, about whom nothing else is known. Pagett's sister, Katherine (<i>b</i>. 1573), and brother, Nathaniel (<i>b</i>. 1589), died shortly after birth. At the age of eleven, Pagett translated from Latin twenty-eight of Ludwig Lavater's sermons on the book of <span class="roman">Ruth</span>. On 25 May 1593 he matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, aged eighteen. Though no record remains of his graduation, he was a great linguist, speaking fifteen or sixteen languages. On 19 August 1601 he was admitted rector of St Edmund the King, Lombard Street, London. On 29 June 1602 he married Jane Rogers (<i>b</i>. 1584), with whom he had two children, Ephraim and Elizabeth. At some point, Jane died; a second wife, Anne, was buried at St Nicholas's, Deptford, in 1621. On 16 April 1632 Pagett married Mary, widow of Sir Stephen Bord.<br>
<br>Pagett's <span class="italic">Christianographie, or, The description of the multitude and sundry sorts of Christians in the world not subject to the pope</span> (1635) was an attack upon Roman Catholicism and appeared in subsequently enlarged editions (1636, 1640; reissued 1674). Pagett described protestantism's international solidarity and accepted as protestants many exotic kinds of Christian around the world. His increasing episcopalianism in later editions has caused him to be identified as a &#145;Laudian&#146; writer, but such Laudianism was probably contrived by Pagett himself since he was trying to secure Laud's support in exporting <span class="italic">Christianographie</span> to the continent. About 1635 Pagett commended <span class="italic">Christianographie</span> to the patriarchs of Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem, the Maronites, Prince Radziwill of Poland, and John Tolnai of Transylvania, along with Elias Petley's Greek translation of the English prayer book and Laud's account of his conference with the Jesuit John Fisher. In 1638 Pagett produced an abbreviated version of <span class="italic">Christianographie</span> and, in 1640, two Latin versions, all of which were dedicated to Laud.<br>
<br>Despite the wide definition of reformed opinion in <span class="italic">Christianographie</span>, Pagett's religious beliefs were Calvinist and unequivocally rooted in the reformed traditions of the English church: the monarch, the prayer book, and the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>. By the 1640s his stance began to appear anachronistic, and his conception of orthodoxy narrowed as he turned away from international protestant Christianity towards describing the heterodoxies immediately around him.<br>
<br>His <span class="italic">Heresiography, or, A Description of the Heretickes and Sectaries of these Latter Times</span> (1645) grew out of a sermon he delivered against heresy, first published as <span class="italic">The Mysticall Wolfe</span> (1645) and reissued as <span class="italic">The Tryall of Trueth</span> (1645). Pagett claimed that he knew several heretics personally, but <span class="italic">Heresiography</span> is principally a compilation of heresies from the period's radical literature and earlier continental and patristic heresy lists. As a heresy list <span class="italic">Heresiography</span> is heresiological rather than heresiographical; it is only modern scholarship which has come to use Pagett's coinage, &#145;heresiography&#146;, to refer to all anti-sectarian writing, thereby underlining his historical and literary importance. Indeed, <span class="italic">Heresiography</span> went through six successively enlarged editions (1645 (again), 1646, 1647, 1654, 1661) and three issues (1647, 1648, 1662); more than any similar text. It remains perhaps the most systematically copious, if excessive, account of the sects during the period.<br>
<br>Circumstances forced Pagett to take the covenant in 1645, but he was soon silenced; an interim was introduced into the parish the same year. He left his ministry and retired to Deptford. He wrote his will on 6 August 1646 and died within a few months. He was buried on 27 October 1646 at St Nicholas's Church, Deptford, aged seventy-two. His bookseller, however, who oversaw <span class="italic">Heresiography</span>'s editions after 1646, claimed he was eighty-four, in accordance with Pagett's nicknames, Old Ephraim Pagitt and Old Father Ephraim. Pagett's cause of death is unknown. His will instructed that most of his land and property be sold to settle his debts, though he provided for his wife and children.<br>
