<span class="headword">Cooke,  Benjamin</span>  (1734&#150;1793), <span class="occ">organist and composer</span>, was born on 28 November 1734 in London, probably at his father's premises in Covent Garden. He was the son of Benjamin Cooke (<i>d</i>. 1742/3), a music seller and publisher in New Street, Covent Garden, and his second wife, Elizabeth Wayet, whose family came from Nottinghamshire and who was sister-in-law to Lancelot &#145;Capability&#146; Brown. Among the works which Cooke's father published was the first ever edition in score of the classic op. 6 concertos and trio sonatas (opp. 1&#150;4) of Arcangelo Corelli, &#145;Carefully Corrected by several Eminent Masters, and revis'd by Dr. Pepusch&#146;. Shortly after Cooke's eighth birthday his father died, and it was to Pepusch that young Benjamin's musical education was entrusted. Under him the boy made such rapid progress that he is said to have deputized for John Robinson, organist of Westminster Abbey, by the age of twelve. Through Pepusch he also became intimately involved in the affairs of the Academy of Ancient Music, and developed those antiquarian interests which were to remain with him for life. In 1749 the young Cooke took over from Samuel Howard as the academy's librarian, and three years later, on the death of Pepusch (who left him a gold piece worth 5 guineas in his will), Cooke stepped naturally into his shoes as its musical director. He continued in that role until 1789, when, in the face of mounting press criticism of the academy's performance standards, he was unceremoniously ousted by the members, and Samuel Arnold appointed in his stead.<br>
<br>By this date Benjamin Cooke had long been firmly ensconced at Westminster Abbey, where he succeeded Bernard Gates as master of the choristers in September 1757 and John Robinson as organist in July 1762; he had also held an appointment as a lay vicar there since 27 January 1758. On 22 May 1758 he married one of his pupils, Mary Jackson (1731/2&#150;1784); according to her son, &#145;she was a most amiable and affectionate woman, and possessed good property&#146;  (Cooke, 11). Of their ten children, five died in infancy. A sixth (another Benjamin) showed an early talent for music, but died aged ten and a half on 25 January 1772. On 2 November 1760 Cooke had been elected a member of the society &#145;for the Support of Decay'd Musicians or their Families&#146; (later the Royal Society of Musicians), and in April 1767 he joined the Catch Club, in whose annual competition for the composition of catches, canons, and glees he was later to win several prizes; he was also a member of the Madrigal Society (from 1769). In July 1775 Cooke took a doctorate of music at Cambridge (which degree he subsequently incorporated at Oxford). Though he refused at first to join a little club of musical graduates set up in 1790, he had apparently been reconciled to the fact that Arnold was also a member by December 1791, when he dined quite happily with a group of fellow &#145;graduates&#146; (including Haydn, a recent honorary DMus of Oxford).<br>
<br>Not content with his Westminster Abbey appointments, it seems that Cooke had hopes of becoming organist of St Michael Cornhill, London, as well; but in a parish election for the post held in 1781 he was resoundingly beaten by Richard John Samuel Stevens. The following year, however, he trounced Charles Burney in a similar contest for the organistship of St Martin-in-the-Fields. As one of the eight assistant directors responsible for organizing the first great Handel commemoration festival at Westminster Abbey and the Pantheon in 1784, Cooke worked closely with Burney, and he received one of the commemorative medals that George III had ordered to be struck on the occasion. Though Cooke is said to have been &#145;extremely thin&#146; when young, he evidently became quite corpulent in old age; he also suffered much from gout, but it was probably a heart attack that carried him off on 14 September 1793. He died at his house in Dorset Court, Parliament Street, Westminster, and was buried in the west cloister of Westminster Abbey on 21 September. His grave, which he shares with his wife, who died on 19 March 1784, his mother-in-law, and all ten children, is marked by a wall plaque on which is inscribed a canon of his own composition and an epitaph written by James Mathias, a fellow member of the Madrigal Society.<br>
<br>As a composer Benjamin Cooke is of no great importance. His output, however, was considerable, and includes a good deal of convivial vocal music, some of which&#151;his glees in particular&#151;reveals a modest but none the less genuine creative talent. He was also, it seems, not only a respectable scholar but also a good-natured and very likeable man, and Laetitia Hawkins's character reference is positively glowing. Her father, Sir John, was one of Cooke's oldest friends, and in the preface to his <span class="italic">General History of the Science and Practice of Music</span> (1776) he acknowledges Cooke's &#145;learning and ingenuity&#146; in transcribing into modern notation some of &#145;the compositions of greatest antiquity&#146; which he had felt obliged to include; indeed, there are several examples of such pieces among the large collection of Cooke's musical manuscripts now in the library of the Royal College of Music, London. Evidence of his studies in musical theory and other such matters survives in the British Library (Add. MS 29298) and in a very miscellaneous volume of &#145;Musical conjectures&#146; (started in 1769) now in the Bodleian Library at Oxford (Tenbury collection). Cooke liked to deprecate his abilities as a teacher, but this &#145;did high injustice to his ability and diligence; self, or mutual instruction could never have produced such pupils as left the choir of Westminster Abbey while it was under his tuition&#146;  (&#145;Memoir of Benjamin Cooke&#146;, 208). Among the many musicians who benefited from Cooke's tuition were Sir William Parsons, John Crosdill, both the elder and the younger Charles Knyvett, Reginald Spofforth, James Bartleman, Thomas Greatorex, and John Hindle.<br>
<br>Cooke's four surviving children all died unmarried, the two girls, Mary and Amelia, in 1819 and 1845 respectively. Henry (1766&#150;1840) was professionally active in the General Post Office (as was his uncle, Charles Jackson); in addition to <span class="italic">Some Remarks on the Greek Theory of Tuning Instruments</span>, he published a short memoir of his father (1837) and edited two volumes of his organ pieces. Cooke's second surviving son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6176/', "Robert Cooke (1768&#150;1814)")</script>, succeeded him as organist of St Martin-in-the-Fields.<br>
