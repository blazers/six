<span class="headword">Watkins,  Morgan</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1672), <span class="occ">Quaker preacher</span>, was of Wigmore Grange, then Eyton, Herefordshire, though little else is known of his early life and background. On 7 May 1653 he was one of the signatories to a &#145;Letter from the People of Herefordshire to the Lord General Cromwell&#146;, expressing allegiance to the protector and pledging to &#145;attend&#146; him with their &#145;persons, petitions, purses, lives and all that is dear to us&#146;  (Nickolls, 92).<br>
<br>Watkins was evidently a Quaker by 1657, for in that year George Fox met him at a meeting in Radnorshire and noted that he had become &#145;loving to Friends&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of George Fox</span>, 1.274). About 1658 he defended the Quaker notion of perfection at a disputation with the Baptist Vavasour Powell, details of which are given in <span class="italic">The Perfect Life of the Son of God Vindicated</span> (1658). In this Watkins protested that &#145;they that live in sin, and plead for it term of life, are all blind&#146;  (p. 4).<br>
<br>In 1660 Watkins was a prisoner in St Albans gaol, during which time he wrote <span class="italic">Swearing Denied in the New Covenant</span> [1660] which concerned the Quaker rejection of oaths. By July 1663 he was preaching in London at the Quaker meeting in Pall Mall and elsewhere. On 12 March 1665 he was sent to Newgate from the Bull and Mouth meeting, St Martin's-le-Grand. Two other imprisonments followed during the year, one at Westmorland, after a meeting at Elizabeth Strong's house, and another of about three months' duration at the Gatehouse prison, near Westminster Abbey, on a warrant of 9 August from the duke of Albemarle for attendance at a meeting with nine others. His letters to Mary Penington vividly describe the visitation of the plague both inside and outside prisons. On 18 September 1665 he wrote to her saying, &#145;the miseries that are upon many here are hardly to be uttered&#146;  (Barclay, 149). A later letter written on 5 December revealed that he had experienced &#145;several battles with death&#146; while imprisoned in London  (ibid., 156).<br>
<br>Afterwards Watkins preached and was imprisoned in Buckinghamshire, details of which are given in Thomas Ellwood's <span class="italic">Life</span> (1714). In 1666 he was accused by Justice Ambrose Bennett of being a Jesuit, for &#145;in his Preaching&#146; the latter felt &#145;he trolled over his Latin as fluently as ever he heard anyone&#146;, though Ellwood states that Watkins was &#145;better Versed in Welch, than in Latin&#146;  (p. 249). Watkins and five others were committed to Aylesbury gaol, but owing to the plague were sent to the High Wycombe house of correction, where they were kept from 13 March to 7 June 1666. They refused to be bound over for their appearance at the next assizes and were sent back to the gaol until 25 June, when they were released by proclamation. Ellwood notes that while in prison he made &#145;Nets for Kitchin-Service, to boil Herbs, &amp;c. in; which Trade I learned of Morgan Watkins&#146;  (ibid., 251). He also related that they &#145;kept a fair and Brotherly Correspondence, as became Friends, Prison-fellows and Bed-fellows&#146;  (ibid., 252). By 1670, some time after his incarceration, Watkins appears to have returned to Herefordshire when cattle and goods were distrained from his farm.<br>
<br>Watkins wrote a few more tracts in addition to those listed above, for example <span class="italic">The Children of Abraham's Faith</span>, written with Francis Gawler in 1663, of interest for its discussion of Quaker burials and in which Friends' practice was compared with that of the holy men of former ages. Other works include <span class="italic">A Lamentation over England</span> (1664), regarding persecution of Quakers, and <span class="italic">The Marks of the True Church</span> (1675).<br>
<br>Watkins died at some point after 20 June 1672, at which time he attended Somerset quarterly meeting at Ilchester.<br>
