<span class="headword">Gowland,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1776), <span class="occ">apothecary and inventor of Gowland's lotion</span>, was the grandson of Ralph Gowland, attorney and antiquary of Durham, his first cousin being Ralph Gowland (<i>c</i>.1722&#150;<i>c</i>.1782), an undistinguished MP successively for Durham and Cockermouth. John Gowland did not follow the family tradition of the law; he may have been the John Gowland who was apprenticed to John Marsden, an apothecary at York, on 27 September 1720. Possessing good social connections, about 1736 Gowland secured the post of apothecary in the household of Frederick, prince of Wales.<br>
<br>Gowland clearly prided himself on his professional integrity, and chafed at having to dispense medicines prescribed by court physicians all too ready to blame most ills on impure blood and to rely mainly on sudorifics, purges, and emetics. In 1743 Elizabeth Chudleigh, the future countess of Bristol, was appointed maid of honour to Frederick's wife, Augusta, princess of Wales. Miss Chudleigh had from a precociously early age realized that her face, and other bodily parts that she was not shy of exposing as the occasion called for, were her fortune. When her skin became blotchy and opaque, the royal doctors subjected her to purging, sea-bathing, and other ineffectual treatments, while she attempted to disguise her blemishes with patches and paints. Gowland's diagnosis was that the pores had become clogged from make-up or other causes, and he therefore devised a lotion with which to bathe regularly the face, hands, or any other affected area. Its action would release a form of scurf that could be rubbed away, allowing the skin to breathe naturally and so recover its customary bloom. Freckles and other disfigurements would likewise vanish, and pallor be corrected by a renewed supply of blood to the face. In reality the lotion contained not only bitter almonds and sugar but also a small quantity of corrosive sublimate, a derivative of sulphuric acid and thus powerful enough to remove the top skin. John Corry, in <span class="italic">Quack Doctors Dissected</span> (1801, 45), condemned its action as follows:<blockquote>
<div>There's the lotion of Gowland that flays ladies' faces,<br>
</div>
<div>Distorting the features of our modern graces.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>In spite of containing a noxious and poisonous substance the lotion restored Miss Chudleigh almost instantly to pulchritude, and society ladies anxious to emulate her schoolgirl complexion beat a path to the door of Gowland's residence in Bond Street, London, where the lotion was concocted and sold. However, he refused to add a hyperbolic adjective to what he named simply Gowland's lotion, or to advertise it in the press, relying entirely on personal recommendation. That celebrity led to his appointment in 1760 as apothecary to George III, an office he held until his death. For her part, once she embarked on her undulating career as a gold-digger <i>par excellence</i>, Miss Chudleigh was by no means happy about the story of her cure being publicized, and it did not appear in print until after her death.<br>
<br>The demand for Gowland's lotion, and its high price of 10<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. a quart bottle, made him a wealthy man; in later life he owned much property and had &pound;23,000 out in personal loans. As he and his wife, Elizabeth, left no children, he bestowed handsome legacies on his cousins Ralph Gowland and Thomas Gowland, and their families. The secret formula of his lotion he entrusted to Thomas Vincent, clerk to the royal music closet and principal oboist in the king's band, who had been his close friend since early in their court days. When Gowland died at Bath on 3 August 1776 Vincent took over the making of the lotion and inherited the business on Elizabeth Gowland's death just over three years later.<br>
<br>Vincent's troubles began when he married as his second wife Maria Elizabeth, a glazier's widow. Having moved into her house in Davies Street, London, he bought the lease and the contents, which he injudiciously placed in her sole name. During his absence abroad she and some confederates began to make their own variety of the lotion, clearly inferior, as she did not know the exact formula. In order to end relations with her Vincent had to leave home; together with his son-in-law, Robert Dickinson, he started up production at 55 Long Acre. A war of pamphlets between husband and wife ensued. He was compelled to begin advertising, and strove to build up a network of retailers in all cities and towns of Britain. Vincent died apparently in 1800, and Dickinson clearly lacked his entrepreneurial vigour, so Mrs Vincent's counterfeit version captured most of the trade.<br>
<br>The name of Gowland might have been entirely forgotten, had not Jane Austen in <span class="italic">Persuasion</span> (1818) made Sir Walter Elliot compliment his neglected daughter Anne for her greatly improved complexion, which had become cleaner and fresher. &#145;I should recommend Gowland, the constant use of Gowland, during the spring months. Mrs Clay has been using it at my recommendation, and you see what it has done for her. You see how it has carried away her freckles&#146;  (<span class="italic">Persuasion</span>, ed. R. W. Chapman, 145&#150;6). Jane Austen may have read the puffing pamphlets, with their emphasis on curing pallor and freckles, one having been published in 1792 by the retail agent R. Cruttwell in Bath. Curiously enough, Emma Elizabeth Chamberlayne, her second cousin once removed, in 1766 had married John Gowland's second cousin Thomas Gowland junior, a West India merchant. Fascinated though she was by the ramifications of her extended family, Jane Austen probably never knew of this distant kinship with the man she had immortalized.<br>
