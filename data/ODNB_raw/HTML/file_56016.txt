<span class="headword">Devon,  James</span>  (1866&#150;1939), <span class="occ">prison medical officer and criminologist</span>, was born on 25 October 1866 at 18 James Street, Calton, Glasgow, the son of John Devon, a journeyman iron-moulder, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Arthur. His family was poor working class&#151;his mother signed his birth certificate with a cross&#151;and he left school aged eleven. Devon was ambitious to be a doctor and studied part time at Anderson's and St Mungo's colleges, Glasgow. In 1893, aged twenty-seven, he obtained the Scottish triple qualification in medicine. Initially Devon had worked as a clinical clerk in Glasgow Eye Infirmary and as demonstrator and assistant to the pathologist at Glasgow Royal Infirmary. Thereafter he was appointed resident house surgeon and assistant to the professor of clinical surgery in Glasgow Royal Infirmary and resident assistant medical officer at Glasgow poorhouse and Town's Hospital in Glasgow. On 1 April 1895 he was appointed medical officer at Glasgow prison (Duke Street), where he remained until appointed medical commissioner to the Scottish Prison Commission on 10 April 1913. In 1902 he had been nominated a medico-legal examiner for the crown in criminal cases. Throughout his period as Scottish prison commissioner his chairman was Lord Polwarth, and Devon retired on 31 March 1929.<br>
<br>Glasgow's Duke Street prison had been a showcase house of correction for Scotland when it opened in 1823. However, by the end of the nineteenth century it was an overcrowded, under-funded, down-at-heel, poor-quality prison for short sentence and remand prisoners. In 1900 there was a total of 20,000 admissions, with a daily average of around 140 men and 260 women. In 1912 Devon described an unstimulating, dismal regime of plank beds, prohibition on speaking, exercise by prisoners walking a ring, and drab corduroy or moleskin uniform. He was concerned that reforms advocated for England by the 1895 Gladstone committee on prisons were not being implemented in the sixteen penal institutions overseen by the Scottish Prison Commission. Indeed he gave evidence to the 1900 departmental committee on Scottish prisons that at Duke Street there lacked adequate nursing provision and infirmary care. At this time Devon was instituting nurse training for prison staff while urging that this, albeit an improvement, was not a proper substitute for fully qualified professional nurses. Not until very recently had an assistant medical officer been appointed at Duke Street, and Devon's evidence to this committee was cited several times in its final report.<br>
<br>Devon was responsible for advising the Scottish Prison Commission on all health matters from 1913 to 1929. He oversaw the force-feeding of imprisoned suffragettes in Scotland in 1913, and was attacked with a dog whip on one occasion in this connection. He also oversaw the implementation of the so-called <span class="roman">Cat and Mouse Act</span>, under which hunger-striking suffragettes were released and later reimprisoned when their health was restored. Between 1916 and 1918 the prison system was faced with conscientious objectors, some of whom were Marxist revolutionaries, such as the &#145;Red Clydesiders&#146; John Maclean, James Maxton, and William Gallacher&#151;all sentenced for sedition under the <span class="roman">Defence of the Realm Act</span>. The issue of force-feeding conscientious objectors who went on hunger strike was testing and controversial for the medical commissioner. Also, prisons in the 1920s were greatly influenced by the work of Alexander Paterson of the English Prison Commission regarding reform of the Borstal system for young prisoners. New training systems for these required careful medical supervision with frequent calls upon the medical commissioner.<br>
<br>Devon wrote <span class="italic">The Criminal in the Community</span> (1912) and <span class="italic">Some Causes of Crime</span> (1908). His work was also described or published in medical journals such as the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span> and in more general ones such as the <span class="italic">Hibbert Journal</span>. By his death he was well known as a writer, criminologist, lecturer, and radio broadcaster. He repudiated the Lombrosian positivistic criminology, which held that heredity determines the bulk of criminality, and argued for careful understanding of the social context of the individual. However, he rejected one-dimensional explanations of crime as oversimplified and was, for example, well aware that policing and sentencing could act in a biased and discriminatory manner. Notwithstanding, Devon believed that crime flourished in overcrowded, neglected neighbourhoods which politicians ignored and profiteers exploited, and he argued that real concern for, and interest in, such neighbourhoods would restore bonds of social obligation and charity throughout the whole of society.<br>
<br>Although not an abolitionist Devon was highly critical of both capital and corporal punishment and of the regimes generally in Scottish prisons. He wanted drab and demoralizing routines of punishment for, in the main, trivial offenders to be replaced by individualized sympathy, guidance, and commitment. He strongly believed in the personal interest represented by the Probation Service and wanted young and first-time offenders diverted from custody. For many prisoners, he was convinced that prison was merely a warehouse, returning them to society with their lives and capacities severely disrupted: the former prisoner was therefore less fitted for self-maintenance than prior to sentence, with other criminals often their only recourse. None the less, Devon was suspicious of a tendency in the 1930s among some penal reformers to ascribe all criminality to environment and he insisted that deterrence was essential to criminal disposal. Thus Devon, initially a humanitarian prison reformer in an age of penal severity, found himself at odds with the later fashionable notion of the prison as essentially a moral reformatory.<br>
<br>Devon was twice married and was survived by his second wife and two daughters, one of whom entered the medical profession. He died on 25 February 1939, having lived his retirement at 67 Great King Street, Edinburgh; he was survived by his second wife, Jane Shiel, formerly Buchan. He was a member of the Scottish Liberal and Scottish Arts clubs until his death, and in his later years was in much demand as a speaker at Burns festivals.<br>
