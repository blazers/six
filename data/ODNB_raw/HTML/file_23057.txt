<span class="headword">Maidstone,  Ralph  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1245), <span class="occ">bishop of Hereford</span>, is of unknown origins. His date of birth is unknown, but is unlikely to have been later than <i>c</i>.1195. Since he is referred to, from his earliest occurrences, with the title of <i>magister</i>, he probably received a higher education in the first or second decade of the thirteenth century. Where he was educated is uncertain, but either Oxford or Paris is a possibility in view of his later links with both. He made his early career in the diocese of Coventry and Lichfield, perhaps through the patronage of Bishop William of Cornhill (<i>d</i>. 1223). He occurs as treasurer of Lichfield Cathedral on 21 September 1219 and between 1215 and 1223, his predecessor in this office last occurring in 1204. Between 1220 and 1221 he is recorded as archdeacon of Shropshire (in the diocese of Coventry), but very soon after this, in or by 1222, he was made archdeacon of Chester. Occurrences of his name in witness lists suggest that he was quite active in this office in the first half of the 1220s; thereafter he seems to have absented himself from the diocese, perhaps to go to Paris to teach, since Matthew Paris names him as one of several English scholars who left Paris for Oxford in 1229 when the university was dispersed following riots. It may have been while he was there that he composed the commentary on the <span class="italic">Sentences</span>, which he is said to have written while still archdeacon of Chester  (extract in London, Gray's Inn, MS 14, fols. 28&#150;32).<br>
<br>By 22 June 1231 Maidstone was chancellor of the University of Oxford, but soon after this he was made dean of Hereford in succession to Master Thomas of Bosbury, who died on 29 September 1231; Ralph first occurs as dean on 28 July 1232. He may have been recommended to Bishop Hugh Foliot of Hereford by the latter's friend and prot&eacute;g&eacute; Robert Grosseteste (<i>d</i>. 1253), whom Ralph would have known at Oxford. Shortly after Hugh Foliot's death (7 August 1234) he was elected bishop of Hereford; on 30 September 1234 he received the temporalities, and he was consecrated on 12 November of that year by Archbishop Edmund at Canterbury. Already as dean he had received signs of royal favour, being twice granted the right to take stags in the Forest of Dean; as bishop, in November 1235 he baptized Henry, son of Richard of Cornwall, at Hailes, and shortly afterwards was sent to Provence to escort Eleanor, the intended bride of Henry III, to England; in 1235, 1236, and 1237 he was involved with negotiations with Llywelyn ab Iorwerth.<br>
<br>During May 1237 Maidstone seems to have been making plans to resign from his bishopric, since it is at this point that he confirmed, and promised to renew, his predecessor's arrangements for leaving the episcopal manors stocked and provided with money for seed in a vacancy, and furthermore he established posts for four vicars-choral in the cathedral. He made other benefactions to Hereford Cathedral, including houses in London, service books, vestments, and relics. He had apparently made a vow while still archdeacon of Chester to enter the Franciscan order. The Dunstable annals attribute his wish to become a Franciscan to the injuries he received from a fall in 1238, which left him unable to celebrate mass for a time, but this probably was a contributory factor rather than the original cause. On 17 December 1239 at Oxford he was received into the Franciscan order, having resigned his bishopric, and became a member of the Franciscan community at Oxford, where he helped to build the church. A glossed <span class="roman">New Testament</span> which is inscribed as having been given by him, as a former bishop of Hereford, to the Franciscans of Canterbury, survives as BL, Royal MS 3 C.xi. Later he moved to the Franciscan convent at Gloucester, where he died and was buried in the choir. His date of death can be ascertained from the Hereford Cathedral obit book, which says that the time he spent as a mendicant was equal to the length of time he had been bishop, as 27 January 1245.<br>
