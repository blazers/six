<span class="headword">Percy <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>Fisher]</span>,  John</span>  (1569&#150;1641), <span class="occ">Jesuit</span>, was born on 27 September 1569 in co. Durham, in the village of Holmside, the son of John Percy, yeoman, and Cecilia Lawson, both protestants. At the age of fourteen he was sent to live with a Roman Catholic woman and due to her influence and the persuasions of a local Catholic priest he converted to Catholicism and in 1586 crossed the channel and entered the English College at Rheims. In 1589 he matriculated at the Jesuit-run English College at Rome, and on 13 March 1593, by papal dispensation, was ordained a priest before the full canonical age. In May 1594 he was admitted into the Society of Jesus and began his noviciate at Tournai. In the following year, however, he became ill due to overwork, and was ordered to England to recuperate. Upon arrival in London he was arrested and committed to Bridewell prison, where after seven months he managed to escape with two other priests and seven laymen. After hiding for a short time in London he was sent to Yorkshire and in 1598, after reportedly reconciling his mother and sister to the Catholic faith, he joined John Gerard as a chaplain in the Vaux household at Harrowden. In carrying out his pastoral duties there Percy became confessor to Grace, the wife of Sir John Fortescue, son of the chancellor of the exchequer. The young Jesuit was also instrumental in the conversions of members of the Digby family, including Sir Everard Digby, his wife, Mary, and John Digby of Rutland. In 1599 he became the Digbys' household chaplain. Although not involved in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 he was considered by government officials to be guilty by association with the Digby and Vaux families, and also because he had accompanied some of the conspirators on a pilgrimage to St Winifred's Well in Wales. Nevertheless, he was not apprehended and remained hidden at Harrowden until 1610.<br>
<br>In the years between 1605 and 1610 Percy emerged as an important apologist for the Roman faith. Although he used Fisher as an alias, in 1605 he published <span class="italic">The Treatise of Faith</span> using the pseudonym A. D. The <span class="italic">Treatise</span> was primarily a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> negation of protestantism. &#145;There must be one true faith which has existed visibly in all ages&#146;, Percy's argument went. Since Catholics could show a visible apostolic pedigree and protestants only a church since Luther, the Catholic faith must be true while protestantism was novel and therefore false. Answering Percy's question &#145;where was your church before Luther?&#146; became a provocative challenge for protestants and both Anthony Wotton, lecturer at All Hallows Barking by the Tower in London, and John White, chaplain to the king, published replies in 1608.<br>
<br>In November 1610 Harrowden was raided and Percy, along with Elizabeth Vaux and Nicholas Hart SJ, was arrested. Percy and Hart were sent to the Gatehouse prison at Westminster while Mrs Vaux was thrown into Fleet prison. The affair was widely reported in news dispatches and Gilbert Pickering, the JP who arrested the trio, was knighted. Though the two Jesuits received death sentences, James I commuted them to exile and in 1612 Percy and Hart left for Flanders. Percy remained very active in exile. In 1613 he was appointed vice-regent of the English mission in Flanders as well as professor of holy scripture at the Jesuit noviciate house in Louvain. In 1612, from the secret press at St Omer, he published <span class="italic">A Reply to Mr. Anthony Wotton and Mr. John White, Ministers</span>. The appendix contained &#145;A Catalogue of Divers Visible Professors of the Catholike Faith&#146;, to which Percy added &#145;A Challenge to Protestants&#146; to display their own historical pedigree. In 1614 John White replied again to Percy with his <span class="italic">Defense of the Way to the True Church</span>.<br>
<br>In 1615 Percy again travelled to England, only to be seized and thrown into the New prison. Since the king was now actively pursuing the favour of Spain, English Catholics were receiving numerous gestures of leniency. Along with other Jesuit prisoners Percy was allowed a daily furlough outside the prison and he regularly ministered in the homes of wealthy courtiers. He also became involved in the distribution of Catholic tracts. John Gee, a convert to protestantism, reported that Percy's secret London residence contained &#145;a greater store of books &hellip; than I ever beheld in any stationers ware-house&#146;  (Gee, 24). Even inside the prison Percy kept his personal library, celebrated mass, and actively engaged in debate with protestant churchmen, among whom were puritan ministers George Walker and Henry Burton.<br>
<br>The reputation of &#145;Fisher the Jesuit&#146; grew in the years between 1622 and 1624. In 1622 the countess of Buckingham, mother of George Villiers, the duke of Buckingham and the king's favourite, announced her conversion to Catholicism. Several members of her family also converted and, according to William Laud, the duke was wavering in his religious commitments. Percy was directly involved as he was by this time the chaplain in the Buckingham household, and the countess's confessor. In the wake of growing protestant protests against the Spanish match the king needed to squelch the rumours of these conversions. Publicly, the countess and her female kindred were quickly confirmed by the bishop of London. Privately, the king arranged a series of three debates with Percy, held before the Buckinghams on 24&#150;6 May 1622. On the first day he was called to debate with the dean of Carlisle, Francis White, the brother of John White. On the second day he debated with the king himself, and on the third day with William Laud, then bishop of St David's. After the debates the king delivered a note to the Jesuit, containing &#145;the principal points which with-hold my joining unto the Church of Rome&#146;  (Percy, <span class="italic">Answere to the Nine Points</span>, title-page). In 1624 White wrote <span class="italic">A Replie to Jesuit Fishers Answere to Certain Questions</span> and Laud published the <span class="italic">Answere to Mr. Fishers Relation of a Third Conference</span>. Laud's work was attributed to his chaplain Robert Baillie, but in 1639 Laud admitted that he was the author and published an enlarged version. The <span class="italic">Relation of a Conference between William Laud and Fisher the Jesuit</span> became a celebrated text in Anglican theology and forms part of Laud's collected works. With the assistance of his fellow Jesuit John Floyd, Percy formally responded to the debates in 1625 with the <span class="italic">Answere unto the Nine Points of Controversy</span>.<br>
<br>In 1623 Francis White and Daniel Featley, chaplain to Archbishop Abbott, engaged Percy and his fellow Jesuit John Sweet in another debate held at the home of Sir Humphrey Linde before a large audience of London's &eacute;lite society. This debate also resulted in numerous publications including Featley's <span class="italic">Fisher Catched in his Owne Net</span> (1623), Percy's <span class="italic">Answere to a Pamphlet</span> (1623), and Featley's response, <span class="italic">The Romish Fisher Catched and Held in his Owne Net</span> (1624). Featley's work prompted another reply by Percy in 1625 entitled <span class="italic">A Reply to D. White and D. Featley</span>. About 1625 Percy persuaded William Chillingworth, the well-known Oxford scholar and godson of William Laud, to become a Roman Catholic. Even though the conversion was widely celebrated by Catholics, Chillingworth renounced this new found faith by 1630. After Charles I married Henrietta Maria in 1625 Percy was granted a pardon. Nevertheless, in 1634 he was arrested and ordered to depart the realm. When he refused he was again confined in the Gatehouse until August 1635 when the queen interceded and he was released. Shortly after this he began to suffer from cancer and on 3 December 1641 he died in London.<br>
