<span class="headword">Dodgson,  Campbell</span>  (1867&#150;1948), <span class="occ">museum curator and art historian</span>, was born at Oakwood, Crayford, Kent, on 13 August 1867, the youngest child in the family of one daughter and seven sons of William Oliver Dodgson, stockbroker, and his wife, Lucy Elizabeth Smith. He was educated at Winchester College (1880&#150;86), before going up to New College, Oxford, where he took a first-class honours degree in Greats in 1890 and a second in theology in 1891. He abandoned his initial intention to take holy orders, and in 1893 was appointed to the department of prints and drawings at the British Museum; he succeeded Sir Sidney Colvin as keeper in 1912, a post he held until his retirement in 1932.<br>
<br>Although he came with no prior expertise in the field, Dodgson swiftly established himself as a formidable print scholar of international repute, specializing in the early German school after the British Museum's acquisition in 1895 of William Mitchell's collection of woodcuts of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Dodgson's <span class="italic">Catalogue of Early German and Flemish Woodcuts in the British Museum</span> (2 vols., 1903&#150;11) immediately became the standard work on the subject. He was co-editor of the D&uuml;rer Society publications (1898&#150;1911), and a tireless contributor on many aspects of print connoisseurship to all the major scholarly journals in his field, including the Viennese periodical <span class="italic">Die graphischen K&uuml;nste</span>, the <span class="italic">Burlington Magazine</span>&#151;he was a member of its advisory board from 1903, the date of its inception&#151;and the <span class="italic">Print Collectors' Quarterly</span>, which he helped to found in 1911 and edited single-handed from 1921 to 1936. Apart from his work on the German school he was actively engaged in the acquisition of important French eighteenth-century prints for the British Museum, publishing a book entitled <span class="italic">Old French Colour Prints</span> in 1924, and in 1933, after his retirement, the Roxburghe Club catalogue of the proof states for Goya's <span class="italic">Desastres de la guerra</span>.<br>
<br>Dodgson's importance was not confined to the field of old master prints. Using the income derived from the family firm of Hope, Dodgson, and Cobbold, he built an extensive private collection which ranged from fine examples of the work of Manet, Degas, Pissarro, Toulouse-Lautrec, Odilon Redon, K&auml;the Kollwitz, and Carl Larsson to comprehensive holdings of many contemporary French and British printmakers. Muirhead Bone, Charles Conder, and Augustus John were among many artists working in Britain of whose prints he published <span class="italic">catalogues raisonn&eacute;s</span>. From the outset, Dodgson developed his collection to complement the holdings of the prints and drawings department, ultimately bequeathing more than 5000 items to the British Museum, together with the sum of &pound;3000 to be administered by the National Art Collections Fund for the department's benefit. In 1919 he was a prime mover in establishing a special prints and drawings fund under the auspices of the Contemporary Art Society, from which the British Museum had first refusal on all purchases until 1945.<br>
<br>Dodgson was an outstanding public servant in the integrity and mental discipline he brought to bear on all that he did. After supervising the move of the British Museum's prints and drawings collection to new quarters in the Edward VIIth Wing shortly before the outbreak of the First World War, he ran the department virtually single-handed from 1916 to 1918; at the same time he was working in intelligence for the War Office, a service for which he was made a CBE in 1918. After his retirement the pattern of Dodgson's existence remained much the same; he frequented the Burlington Fine Arts Club (of which he became a member in 1902), travelled extensively until the Second World War, and continued to both collect and publish to the very end of his life, as well as serving as honorary keeper of prints at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge from 1939 to 1946. He received the German government's Goethe medal for services to the history of German art in July 1933, honorary degrees from Oxford and Cambridge in 1934 and 1936, and decorations from France and Belgium.<br>
<br>As a personality, Dodgson appeared an austere man of retiring manner whose iron-clad sense of duty&#151;&#145;Diligentia&#146; was the Dodgson family motto which appeared on Dodgson's own book-plate designed by Thomas Sturge Moore in 1909&#151;did not always endear him to more gregarious colleagues such as Sidney Colvin and Laurence Binyon; to the young John Pope-Hennessy he appeared in the latter part of his life to be &#145;like an old tortoise&#146;  (Pope-Hennessy to Antony Griffiths, 23 April 1978, BM), an impression aptly conveyed by the portrait of him etched by Andrew Freeth in 1938. Behind this reserve a more passionate nature was glimpsed by Oscar Wilde, who met him in February 1893 when Dodgson was engaged as a tutor to Lord Alfred Douglas. The engagement lasted no more than a few days, but Dodgson confessed to their mutual friend the poet Lionel Johnson to being quite spellbound by Wilde.<br>
<br>On 24 September 1913 Dodgson married (Frances) Catharine Spooner (1883&#150;1954) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32849/', "Dodgson, (Frances) Catharine")</script>], daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36219/', "William Archibald Spooner")</script>, warden of New College, Oxford, and his wife, Frances; she was a practising artist who had studied at the Ruskin School of Drawing in Oxford and at the Royal Academy Schools and the Slade School of Fine Art in London. They set up house at 22 Montagu Square, Marylebone, London, where they maintained a comfortable existence devoted to serious cultural pursuits, holding regular exhibitions of Dodgson's own collection and the work acquired for the Contemporary Art Society after 1919. Although they had no children, the Dodgsons were notably kind to Campbell's many nieces and nephews, among whom they were particularly close to John Dodgson, who became a professional artist, and to Eveline Dodgson, who also studied at the Slade. She was briefly married to James Byam Shaw of Colnaghis, who remained a close friend until Dodgson's death, which occurred on 11 July 1948 at Chapel House, Mattock Lane, Ealing, London.<br>
