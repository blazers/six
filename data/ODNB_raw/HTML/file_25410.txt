<span class="headword">Naylor,  Francis  Hare-</span>  (1753&#150;1815), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was the grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12298/', "Francis Hare")</script>, bishop of Chichester, and the eldest son of Robert Hare-Naylor (<i>d</i>. 1797) of Herstmonceux, Sussex, canon of Winchester, and his first wife, Sarah, daughter of Lister Selman of Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire. His mother died when he was a child, and his father then married Henrietta Henckell, who sold the family properties in Norfolk, Suffolk, and Hampshire, and eventually persuaded her husband to consent to the demolition of Herstmonceux Castle, so that a modern house could be built, and settled upon her own children. Francis Hare-Naylor had a small inheritance from his mother and, being unhappy at home, lived almost entirely in London, where he made friends with Charles James Fox and became one of the circle that gathered round Georgiana Cavendish, duchess of Devonshire, at Chiswick. He was introduced by the duchess to her cousin <a name="cosubject_25410"></a><span class="headword">Georgiana Shipley</span>  (<em>c.</em>1755&#150;1806), <span class="occ">painter</span>, fourth daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25411/', "Jonathan Shipley (1713&#150;1788)")</script>, bishop of St Asaph, and his wife, Anna Maria Mordaunt (1716/17&#150;1803), niece of the earl of Peterborough. Georgiana was described as &#145;tall, handsome, and self-sufficient, a scholar, and a painter&#146;  (Leslie and Taylor, 376). She was a friend and pupil of Sir Joshua Reynolds and &#145;exhibited with applause&#146;  (ibid.) at the Royal Academy in 1781, where she showed a portrait of a lady and two children. The duchess took every opportunity to bring her cousin and Hare-Naylor together, and Bishop Shipley was at last persuaded to invite him to his residence at Twyford, Hampshire. The following day he was arrested for debt while driving in the episcopal coach with Georgiana and her parents. Banned from the house, he disguised himself as a beggar, and met her while driving with her family. Her recognition of him produced a crisis. The bishop refused to assist Hare-Naylor, but the duchess of Devonshire gave him and Georgiana an annuity of &pound;200; they were married on 14 November 1784.<br>
<br>The couple then travelled to Karlsruhe, and afterwards to the north of Italy. Here they had four sons and a daughter, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12297/', "Augustus William Hare")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12304/', "Julius Charles Hare")</script>. The family eventually settled at Bologna where Georgiana devoted herself to painting and formed a friendship with Clotilda Tambroni, the eminent professor of Greek.<br>
<br>In 1797 Hare-Naylor's father died. It was found that his intention of leaving everything to his second wife was frustrated by her having built her new house of Herstmonceux Place upon entailed land. The Hare-Naylors therefore departed for England, leaving three of their children in the care of Clotilda Tambroni and Father Emmanuele Aponte, an old Spanish priest, and appointing the famous Mezzofanti as tutor of their eldest son.<br>
<br>The Hare-Naylors settled at Herstmonceux, but were plagued by financial problems. Hare-Naylor's democratic principles made enemies and lost friends. He indignantly rejected the offer of a baronetcy. From 1799 (when the Hare-Naylors returned to Italy to fetch their children) life became an increasing struggle with the requirements of an impoverished estate. Hare-Naylor turned to writing as a source of income. However, his plays <span class="italic">The Mirror</span> and <span class="italic">The Age of Chivalry</span> were rejected at Drury Lane. In 1801 he published his <span class="italic">History of the Helvetic Republics</span>, which was also a disappointment, although it passed into a second enlarged edition in 1809. The family was only saved from severe financial trouble by the intervention and help of Georgiana's sister, Anna Maria, widow of the orientalist Sir William Jones.<br>
<br>In 1804 Hare-Naylor and his family left Herstmonceux for ever, and moved to Weimar, attracted partly by its famous literary society, but more by the friendship of the reigning duchess, who paid daily visits to Georgiana. While at Weimar, Hare-Naylor published the novel <span class="italic">Theodore, or, The Enthusiast</span>, for which John Flaxman made a series of illustrations. On 6 April 1806 (Easter Sunday) Georgiana Hare-Naylor, blind from the age of forty-eight, died at Lausanne. In the following year Hare-Naylor sold the family estate at Herstmonceux. In the same year he married a relative of his first wife; the couple had two sons and a daughter, Georgina, who later married the theologian Frederick Denison Maurice. In September 1814 Hare-Naylor left England for the continent and in 1815 he died, after a lingering illness, at Tours. He was buried beneath the altar of Herstmonceux church. His best-known work, <span class="italic">The Civil and Military History of Germany</span>, was published posthumously in 1816.<br>
