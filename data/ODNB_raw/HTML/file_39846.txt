<span class="headword">Warner,  Reginald Ernest <span class="st"> [Rex]</span></span>  (1905&#150;1986), <span class="occ">novelist, classicist, and translator</span>, was born on 9 March 1905 in Amberley, Gloucestershire, the only child of the Revd Frederic Ernest Warner, vicar (&#145;of the modernist persuasion&#146;) of Amberley, and his schoolteacher wife Kathleen, daughter of the Revd John James Luce of St Nicholas's Church, Gloucester. He was educated first at St George's School, Harpenden, and then at Wadham College, Oxford, which he entered with an open scholarship in classics in 1923, in spite of having been, according to his tutor, Maurice Bowra, ill taught at school, so that he &#145;found in Greek and Latin all the charms of novelty&#146;. No doubt better taught at Wadham, he took a first class in classical honour moderations in 1925, but suffered a nervous breakdown in the following year and, after leaving Oxford for a time, returned to take a third class in English in 1928.<br>
<br>Among his Oxford contemporaries and friends were the poets W. H. Auden and Stephen Spender, and particularly Cecil Day-Lewis, who was at the same college and willing to share in some degree his athletic as well as his literary enthusiasms. Warner&#151;tall, strongly built, and vigorous&#151;captained a Wadham rugby team of which Day-Lewis was a member, and always retained his interest in and taste for energetic sporting pursuits. Day-Lewis, in his autobiography <span class="italic">The Buried Day</span> (1960), recalls his friend's &#145;Homeric boisterousness&#146;, which did not fade with the passing years.<br>
<br>Warner's entry on the literary scene was not immediate. On leaving Oxford he took teaching appointments in various schools, including at one stage, from 1932 to 1934, two posts in Egypt. His d&eacute;but, when it came in 1937, was auspicious. His <span class="italic">Poems</span>, published in that year, made no great mark, and in later years verse was only a small part of his prolific output. But it was also in 1937 that there appeared his novel <span class="italic">The Wild Goose Chase</span>, written mainly in England before he left for Egypt, and this strikingly original work made an immediate impression. His tale of three brothers and their quest in an unnamed country for the wild goose, symbol of hope and personal regeneration, was rightly seen as akin to the work of Franz Kafka; but it drew also on elements of classical mythology, and even of fairy tale, in a manner genuinely new in English fiction. <span class="italic">The Professor</span> (1938) was a very different work, a touching and almost purely naturalistic apology for traditional liberalism confronted, disastrously, with totalitarian amoralism. In <span class="italic">The Aerodrome</span> (1941) he reverted in part to a non-realistic, expressionist technique. Generally regarded as his best novel, this deeply gloomy work also sees human values collapsing before a rising tide of nihilistic materialism. Warner shared the Marxist enthusiasms of his student contemporaries but never joined the Communist Party. After the Molotov&#150;Ribbentrop pact he saw communist dictatorship as scarcely preferable to the fascist variety. His own position is vigorously stated in his book of essays <span class="italic">The Cult of Power</span> (1946).<br>
<br>After a brief spell of service with the Allied Control Commission in Berlin, Warner became director (1945&#150;7) of the British Institute in Athens. Later he held academic appointments in America, chairs at Bowdoin College in 1962&#150;3 and at the University of Connecticut from 1964 to 1974. He was appointed to the Greek royal order of the Phoenix (1963), and awarded an honorary DLitt degree by Rider College (1968) and an honorary fellowship of his Oxford college, Wadham (1973).<br>
<br>From 1945 Warner's output of fiction, criticism, translations, and particularly retellings of classical legend and history, was unceasing&#151;some thirty publications in as many years. But, after his rather slight novel <span class="italic">Escapade</span> (1953), it mostly took the form of what he himself called &#145;uncreative writing&#146;&#151;writing based rather on classical and historical scholarship than on imaginative invention. The quality of the work, however, was unfailingly high. <span class="italic">Imperial Caesar</span> (1960) won the Tait memorial prize, and special mention should be made of his version of the <span class="italic">Confessions</span> of St Augustine (1963), and of his translations of Aeschylus, Euripides, Thucydides, and Plutarch.<br>
<br>Warner was married three times, in unusual circumstances. In 1929 he married Frances Chamier Grove (1910&#150;2003), daughter of Frank Grove, civil engineer, who was much employed, before the First World War, in railway construction in China. They had two sons and a daughter. This marriage was dissolved in 1949 and in the same year he married Barbara Judith Rothschild (1911&#150;1989), divorced wife of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40176/', "Victor Rothschild, third Baron Rothschild")</script>, and daughter of St John Hutchinson, barrister and recorder of Hastings; they had a daughter. The marriage was dissolved in 1962 and in 1966 he remarried Frances Chamier Warner, his former wife. He died at his home, Anchor House, St Leonard's Lane, Wallingford, on 24 June 1986.<br>
