<span class="headword">Russell <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Worsley]</span>,  Anna</span>  (1807&#150;1876), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born in Arnos Vale, Bristol, in November 1807, one of five daughters and at least two sons of Philip John Worsley (1769&#150;1811), a sugar refiner in that city. Brought up in a Unitarian family in which the children were given every encouragement to develop their talents, she and her brother Samuel (1803?&#150;1888) showed a keenness for natural history. While he collected fossils, her interest lay initially in insects; after some years, though, she turned increasingly to botany, perhaps influenced in this by a brother-in-law, the Revd Thomas Butler (1806&#150;1886), a keen amateur botanist and father of the novelist Samuel Butler, to whom she was to become godmother. A long list of localities for the rarer plants of her home district contributed by her, indirectly, to H. C. Watson's <span class="italic">New Botanist's Guide</span> (1835) first brought her botanical ability to wider notice and won her the respect of its unsparingly critical author, who in later years was to acclaim her diligence and accuracy with unwonted warmth. Visits to the Butlers in Nottinghamshire and to another botanist relative, Dr Joseph Bunny (1798&#150;1885), at Newbury in Berkshire extended her acquaintance with the British flora and led to her producing a list of plants local to Newbury which was published in 1839 as an appendix to an anonymous history of that town (since revealed to have been edited by Edward William Gray). More than sixty species in this were first records for the county. Soon after, both she and Butler joined the Botanical Society of London and for many years she was active in contributing specimens to its annual exchanges of herbarium material. Some of these were collected for her by a friend, Frederick Russell; their botanical friendship culminated in marriage in 1844.<br>
<br>After some years at Brislington, on the outskirts of Bristol, the couple moved, in 1856, to Frederick Russell's home town of Kenilworth in Warwickshire. There Anna's interest turned to fungi, on which she brought to bear an early facility with pen and brush, eventually building up a collection of over 730 drawings, most of them of Warwickshire species.<br>
<br>As able and as quietly productive as her several female contemporaries who won comparable distinction in marine algology, Anna Russell nevertheless shared their diffidence at venturing into print, preferring to restrict knowledge of her work to a limited circle and leave it to intermediaries to publish her discoveries. She died at Kenilworth on 11 November 1876, her husband having predeceased her. Her herbarium and a collection of birds' eggs were bequeathed by her to the Birmingham and Midland Institute, but neither can now be traced.<br>
