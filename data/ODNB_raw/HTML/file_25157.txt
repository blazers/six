<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Seymour <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Grey]</span>,  Katherine</span>, countess of Hertford  (1540?&#150;1568), <span class="occ">noblewoman and royal kinswoman</span>, was the second of three daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11535/', "Henry Grey, duke of Suffolk (1517&#150;1554)")</script>, and Frances Brandon (1517&#150;1559). Frances was the second child and elder daughter of Henry VIII's sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18251/', "Mary Tudor")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3260/', "Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolk")</script>, and the granddaughter of Henry VII. Katherine's parents inherited the Suffolk title in October 1551. During childhood Lady Katherine lived mainly at Bradgate Hall in Leicestershire, where she was educated by Thomas Aylmer. Unlike <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8154/', "Jane Dudley (n&#233;e Grey)")</script>, Katherine did not make any impression on Roger Ascham when he visited Bradgate in the summer of 1550, and it is usually assumed from this that she was a far less serious scholar than her elder sister.<br>
<br>The Suffolk family moved to Southwark in late 1550 or 1551. On 21 May 1553, as part of Suffolk's plan to put Lady Jane on the throne, Katherine was either married, or betrothed, to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13028/', "Henry Herbert (d. 1601)")</script>, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13055/', "William Herbert, first earl of Pembroke")</script>, an ally of the duke of Northumberland. The ceremony took place at the duke's palace, Durham Place, on the same day that Jane married his son. Apparently the marriage was not consummated and Pembroke had it dissolved after Mary I's accession. In 1554, after her father's execution and mother's remarriage, Katherine was placed in the care of Anne, the dowager duchess of Somerset. Despite her father's and sister's treason, Katherine spent time at Mary's court and was treated as a princess of the blood. Although protestant, she outwardly conformed.<br>
<br>Soon after Elizabeth's accession Katherine was appointed maid of honour. On her mother's death in November 1559 she and her younger sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15503/', "Lady Mary Keys (1545?&#150;1578)")</script> inherited land in Lincolnshire and Warwickshire, but her stepfather, Adrian Stokes, was to enjoy the income from them during his lifetime. She also became heir presumptive according to Henry VIII's will, and consequently attracted the attention of foreign princes and ambitious Englishmen. In August 1559 and March 1560 rumours reached the government that Philip II was planning to persuade her to slip abroad and marry his son. In September 1560 the Scottish council was considering seeking her hand for the earl of Arran. Pembroke, meanwhile, wanted to re-establish her marriage with his son.<br>
<br>Katherine, however, wanted to marry <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25161/', "Edward Seymour, earl of Hertford (1539?&#150;1621)")</script>, the eldest son of Protector Somerset and his wife, Anne. Katherine's mother had agreed to the match in March 1559 and promised to use her influence with the queen and privy council to obtain their consent. This was crucial because an act of 1536 had made it treason for a person of royal blood to marry without the monarch's approval. Frances, however, died before interceding on the young couple's behalf. Fearful that the queen's permission would not be forthcoming, Katherine and Hertford, abetted by his sister Jane Seymour, decided to risk a clandestine marriage. In November or December 1560 the couple were secretly married at Hertford's house, with only Jane and an unidentified clergyman as witnesses. The marriage was immediately consummated in Hertford's bedchamber. In May 1561 Hertford was sent to France to further his education, but by then Katherine was pregnant. Alone and desperate, she confessed her plight in August to Lord Robert Dudley and Elizabeth St Loe, then a gentlewoman of the privy chamber. Dudley immediately informed the queen. Scenting a plot, Elizabeth ordered Katherine to the Tower and summoned Hertford back from Paris. Both were interrogated closely and separately. Although they differed on points of detail, they agreed on the essentials, but the minister could not be found, while Jane Seymour had died the previous March. In the third week of September 1561 Katherine gave birth to a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25160/', "Edward Seymour, Viscount Beauchamp")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25161/', "Seymour, Edward (1539?&#150;1621)")</script>], who was baptized within the Tower. On 31 January 1562 an ecclesiastical high commission headed by Archbishop Parker was appointed to judge the legitimacy of the marriage. With no witnesses or documentary evidence to support its validity, and probably under pressure from the queen, the commission declared on 12 May 1562 that there had been no marriage and that Edward was consequently illegitimate. Meanwhile, Katherine and Hertford were left in the Tower. The lieutenant, Sir Edward Warner, feeling sorry for the couple, disobeyed orders and allowed them secret conjugal visits. As a result, Katherine conceived again and gave birth to a second son, Thomas, in February 1563. For this affront, Hertford was fined &pound;15,000.<br>
<br>For the rest of her life Katherine remained in custody, never to see Hertford again; they could only exchange letters and books. Because of plague in London, she was removed in August 1563 to the house of her uncle, Lord John Grey, at Pyrgo in Essex, where she was kept under strict house arrest. During this time, she and Grey frequently petitioned Dudley and William Cecil to secure her pardon from the queen. Grey described Katherine as &#145;penitent and soroful&#146;, anorexic, and a suicide risk. On his death in November 1564 she was transferred to the custody of Sir William Petre of Ingatestone, Essex. In May 1566 Sir John Wentworth of Horkesley and Gosfield took over her charge until his death. From October 1567 she remained in the custody of Owen Hopton of Cockfield Hall, Yoxford, in Suffolk, who in 1570 became lieutenant of the Tower. Hertford paid for her expenses (66<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. per week for her diet, 26<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. for his sons, and 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. for each of her seventeen attendants). Elizabeth assigned to her the rents of the college of Astley in Warwickshire in 1567 to supplement her meagre income.<br>
<br>Katherine was kept in close custody for so long because of the debates on the succession. In early 1563 the MP John Hales wrote a manuscript tract defending her claim to the succession, and also sent Robert Beale abroad to obtain foreign legal opinion that the Hertford marriage was legal. Hales's tract was widely circulated, and news of his activities reached the queen in April 1564. She was incensed, and Hales was sent first to the Fleet and then the Tower. Others came under suspicion, including Lord John Grey, Lord Keeper Bacon, and Hertford's stepfather. Hales's intervention provoked a pamphlet war over the succession issue, which came to a head in the 1566 parliament, where Elizabeth was petitioned unsuccessfully to name her successor. The same year the play <span class="italic">Gorboduc</span>, written by Thomas Norton and Thomas Sackville, which had originally been performed before the queen on 18 January 1562, was reissued. Some historians believe that it was calling for the parliamentary settlement of the succession on the Suffolk line. Elizabeth, however, was unsympathetic to the claim of Katherine, preferring that of Mary Stewart.<br>
<br>Katherine died on 27 January 1568, perhaps of anorexia, and was buried at Yoxford on 21 February. Her grandson reinterred her remains in the Seymour family tomb at Salisbury Cathedral (the date of death on the monument is incorrect). Her death scene was idealized in a manuscript entitled &#145;A breefe discowrse of the manner and order of [her] departinge&#146;. In 1572 Thomas Churchyarde wrote a narrative poem based on the discourse, and John Philip also composed a panegyric in verse of her marriage life and death. For years afterwards many argued that her marriage was legal and her sons were consequently heirs to the throne. The union was finally declared legitimate in 1606.<br>
