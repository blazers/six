<span class="headword">Herrick <span class="st"> [Heyricke]</span>, Sir  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1562, <em>d.</em> 1653), <span class="occ">moneylender and royal official</span>, was baptized on 9 December 1562 at St Martin's, Leicester, the fifth and youngest son of John Herrick or Heyricke (1513&#150;1589) of Leicester and Mary, daughter of John Bond. He was born into a successful business family in Tudor Leicester, and was apprenticed to an elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54563/', "Nicholas Herrick")</script>, who was a London goldsmith. Having become free of the Goldsmiths' Company in 1587, and taking over the business in 1592, he soon became active as a moneylender on both a large and a small scale. On one occasion the explorer and naval commander Martin Frobisher requested an overnight loan of &pound;5, or even &pound;3 (presumably to pay a gambling debt), but was lent only &pound;2. By 1595 Herrick was able to buy the country house and estate of Beaumanor, near Leicester, from the financially embarrassed royal favourite, Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex. On 6 May 1596 he married Joan, daughter of Richard May of Mayfield Place, Sussex; they had twelve children, of whom eight survived infancy, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13175/', "Richard Heyrick (1600&#150;1667)")</script>, the Presbyterian minister.<br>
<br>Elected MP for the borough of Leicester in the last Elizabethan parliament, Herrick was also to sit in the first and third parliaments of James I (on a vacancy from 1605 to 1610, and in 1621). Soon after the new monarch's accession he was knighted, became one of the king's jewellers, gained exemption from civic office, and secured a reversion to a tellership in the exchequer of receipt. The latter grant was confirmed in 1611 and he succeeded to the office in 1616. By then he had, perhaps unavoidably, become a large-scale lender to the crown. His papers, which have survived in considerable bulk, are a potential source for the workings of the Jacobean exchequer. They include a series of begging letters from his nephew, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13092/', "Robert Herrick")</script>, the poet, then a student at Cambridge, as well as the portage book of Herrick's exchequer fees during his tellership, from which can be derived approximate totals of his earnings, over and above any stipendiary fees from the crown; in a good year the sum was as large as &pound;400, but often less than that. His so-called &#145;account book&#146; (Leics. RO, MS DG 9/2049) spans the 1590s to 1630s, but is only a ledger of in and out payments in his capacity as a goldsmith and moneylender during the years 1610&#150;19. It shows that very considerable sums were being deposited with him by other wealthy individuals, as well as recording a wide variety of loans and payments large and small. In the way in which he borrowed as well as lent, Herrick could be said to have anticipated the scrivener and goldsmith bankers of the mid- and later seventeenth century who kept &#145;running cashes&#146;.<br>
<br>It has been suggested that Herrick's criticism of royal patents granting monopolies, such as that for gold and silver thread, during the 1621 parliament was unacceptable to the court, and that this led to his loss of office. He was, however, allowed to sell the tellership and (though on worse terms) his post as jeweller, and vacated both in the course of 1623&#150;4. There is evidence earlier than this of his having been in financial difficulties, probably because his loans to the crown had not been repaid. He had begun to sell property, rather than buying more, even before the 1620s, parting with a Northamptonshire rectory and its associated rights for &pound;1700. His role as executor to the master of the great wardrobe, Sir Roger Aston (<i>d</i>. 1612), proved vexatious; Herrick was still being harassed over this more than twenty years later, causing him to minute on a letter &#145;that I have not a peny of Sir Roger Aston's estait in my handes&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Eng. hist. c. 480, fol. 288).<br>
<br>By the early 1630s Herrick had fallen into real impoverishment. This may have been worsened by his wife's extreme outspokenness and involvement in potentially slanderous disputes over religion. Lady Herrick was the sister of Sir Humphrey May (1573&#150;1630), chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, and a privy councillor, a connection which had been an asset earlier in the century. As against Lady Herrick's iconoclastic removal of a painted church window, and Sir William's later refusal to pay ship money on a holiday home in East Anglia, he had, however, subscribed to the forced loan of 1627 and did pay ship money on his main midland property. Yet in 1638 two of the more constitutionalist and anti-Laudian of the judges ordered a stay of any proceedings against Herrick and his eldest son for unpaid taxes&#151;an echo perhaps of the famous Hampden ship money case decided earlier in that year. Meanwhile Sir William had surrendered his rights to the woodlands on and around the Beaumanor estate, and seems in effect to have made the management of his affairs over to trustees. The alleged plundering of his property by royalist soldiers in 1644 and 1645, because he and his wife were regarded as &#145;rebels&#146; (parliamentarians), may have been, as it were, the last straw but is unlikely to have been of decisive importance. The family kept Beaumanor and a town house in Leicester, though they were still in difficulties during the later seventeenth century.<br>
<br>Uncertainty surrounds some aspects of Herrick's life. He died on 2 March 1653 and is sometimes said to have lived to the age of ninety-six; this would place his date of birth in 1556 or 1557 and make him nearly six when he was baptized, which, though not impossible, is extremely unlikely. The statement of his age at death is probably the result of a misreading of the inscription on his tombstone (in St Martin's, Leicester), which properly interpreted indicates that he died at the age of ninety. Obscurity also surrounds the cause of the belief, held by his family and some local historians in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, that he had been sent on a mission from Queen Elizabeth I to the sultan of Turkey. The state papers foreign and the records of the Levant Company reveal no trace of him; unfortunately, the portrait, said to have been of Herrick with a lady companion, both in oriental dress, which might have confirmed this story, has not survived.<br>
<br>More important questions concern his wealth and the reasons for his straitened circumstances and decline. He was probably never rich on the scale of his wife's brother-in-law, Baptist Hicks (1551&#150;1621), later Lord Campden, or the greatest London tycoons of the time, such as Sir Paul Pindar (1565&#150;1650), or some of the other farmers of the customs duties. Over-involvement in crown finance seems a likelier reason for his decline than loss of office, due to political and religious opposition to royal policy. With little evidence save the handwriting and certain entries in his papers, a decay in his mental faculties cannot be ruled out. The final picture is of an old man cajoled, possibly even swindled, out of his property rights by his own and his wife's families, and then the victim of looting by the cavalier army. At very much the same time, Herrick's poetical nephew lost his Devon church living at the hands of the victorious puritans.<br>
