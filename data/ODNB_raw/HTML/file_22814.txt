</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Prior,  Matthew</span>  (1664&#150;1721), <span class="occ">poet and diplomat</span>, was born in Stephen's Alley, Westminster, on either 21 or 23 July 1664, the son of Elizabeth (probably <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pennefather) and George Prior (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1675), a London joiner. The fifth of six children, he was the only one to survive early childhood.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsandeducation16641687"></a>Early years and education, 1664&#150;1687</h2>Prior's father had left Dorset to practise his joiner's trade in Westminster, where two of his brothers were already keeping taverns&#151;Arthur, The Rhenish tavern on Channel Row, Samuel, The Rummer tavern between Whitehall and Charing Cross. Prior's mother appears to have married below her class&#151;she was probably Elizabeth Pennefather, from a good Dorset family. His father George, however, appears to have prospered in his carpenter's trade, and could afford to send young Matthew to nearby Westminster School, which was presided over by the formidable Dr Richard Busby. Dr Busby emphasized strict discipline, the traditional classical curriculum, extemporaneous composition in both prose and verse, and oratory. Prior was later to praise what Thomas Sprat, bishop of Rochester, had called &#145;<i>the genius of that Place</i>&#146;&#151;that even very young boys there were made to compose extemporaneous verses and declamations in a very short space of time.<br>
<br>His father's death&#151;when Prior was about eleven&#151;had forced the family to withdraw him from Westminster School and put him to work at his uncle Arthur's Rhenish tavern. A year later Charles Sackville, sixth earl of Dorset, came into The Rhenish tavern and found the twelve-year-old Matthew behind the bar, reading Horace. Dorset asked Matthew to construe a passage or two of Horace, then to turn a Horatian ode into English. He did so with such skill that on subsequent visits to the tavern Dorset often asked him to entertain his friends and himself by turning Horace or Ovid into English verse. Finally, the earl of Dorset offered to pay Prior's tuition to return to Westminster School, if his uncle Arthur would pay for his clothing and other necessities. The Priors gratefully accepted this offer, and Matthew returned to Westminster School about 1676, becoming a king's scholar there in 1681, an award based on his distinction in classical languages.<br>
<br>Westminster king's scholars usually went to Christ Church, Oxford, and Dr Busby and the earl of Dorset expected Prior to do the same. Instead, he defied them and chose to attend Cambridge, where three of his best friends (Charles and James Montagu and George Stepney) were already in attendance or planned to be. Prior applied for and in the spring of 1683 received one of the first five duchess of Somerset scholarships to St John's College, Cambridge. By the terms of this scholarship Prior was exempted from paying tuition and received an allowance of 5<i>s</i>. a week for living expenses, a bedroom that he shared with four other young men, and a private study. During his four years at St John's College, Prior followed a curriculum still heavy in logic and divinity, one that he later felt had turned him away from poetry and in the direction of politics and prose. Yet while he was an undergraduate at St John's he wrote more than thirty Latin pieces and a dozen poems in English. None would have made his reputation as a poet, but he thought highly enough of them to preserve them carefully for the rest of his life. They show the direction in which his writing of poetry in English was moving: they are particularly concerned with royal or aristocratic occasions, and in them he utilizes pastoral or mythological machinery to advance his own causes.<br>
<br>On 9 February 1687 Prior graduated BA, eleventh in the <i>orde senioritatis</i>. He produced a thirty-four-line Latin hexameter poem in honour of the occasion, arguing against Thomas Hobbes that &#145;Fuit justum et injustum ante Leges Civiles&#146;.<h2>
<a name="YearsinLondonCambridgeandBurleigh16871690"></a>Years in London, Cambridge, and Burleigh, 1687&#150;1690</h2>Soon after graduating from Cambridge, Prior returned to London, probably largely because of the death of his uncle Arthur, who died there in May 1687, leaving Prior &pound;100. For the next three years Prior was reaching out for a professional role he had not yet defined, but which he was increasingly convinced he might find in politics rather than poetry. On 3 April 1688 he was entered as a Keyton fellow at St John's and moved into the fellows' quarters there, assigned to one of its two medical fellowships, and was later required to lecture on Galen as Linacre lecturer (1706&#150;10).<br>
<br>Prior seems to have spent most of this period (1687&#150;90) as tutor to the two sons of the earl of Exeter at Burleigh and as a fellow at St John's College. In his poems of these years there is an increasing sense that poetry is not his m&eacute;tier and that politics might be, if he were given an opportunity to serve in that sphere. <span class="italic">The Hind and the Panther Transvers'd</span> (1687), written in collaboration with Charles Montagu, was a satiric attack on Dryden's <span class="italic">The Hind and the Panther</span>, out less than two months earlier, and won instant public acclaim for both Montagu and Prior. &#145;On Exodus Iii. 14&#146; was an irregular ode in the style of Cowley, later to be echoed frequently in the fideistic sections of Alexander Pope's <span class="italic">Essay on Man</span>. Apparently one of Prior's favourite serious pieces, he was to use the <span class="roman">Exodus</span> ode as the lead poem in both his collected editions of <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span>. &#145;Journey to Copt-Hall&#146;, written in this period but not printed until 1907, is interesting chiefly as a predecessor, in content, method, and tone, thirty years earlier, of Prior's now famous &#145;Down-Hall: a Ballad&#146;. A group of four poems addressed to Fleetwood Shepherd, the wit and poet who served as intermediary between the earl of Dorset and the many poets whose patron he became, show two of the other directions in which Prior was moving in his light verse: the mock heroic and the familiar verse epistle.<h2>
<a name="YearsatTheHague16901697"></a>Years at The Hague, 1690&#150;1697</h2>Prior's opportunity to enter politics came on 1 November 1690, when he was appointed as secretary to Charles Berkeley, Viscount Dursley, British ambassador to The Hague. Prior's responsibilities included issuing or refusing passports, forwarding newspapers with details relevant to England, sending on with his own comments newsletters arriving from various important towns in the League of Augsburg, and reporting details of battles in the war and of local diplomatic gossip. For three of his seven years at The Hague (1692&#150;5) there was no English ambassador in residence there and Prior fulfilled those duties, acting as chief minister with skill, diligence, and good sense while receiving the pay only of a secretary. The Hague was at this time an important listening post and relay station in the Nine Years' War, which had already been going on for two years when Prior was appointed to The Hague and was to continue for almost seven more. Finally, Edward, Viscount Villiers, later earl of Jersey, assumed office as ambassador to The Hague in September 1695. For Prior it was a fortunate appointment. Both men were alumni of St John's College, and Prior's favourite cousin, Katharine, had married Colonel George Villiers, Edward's cousin. The earl of Jersey requested that Prior remain at The Hague and that his salary be doubled. When the peace negotiations of the treaty of Ryswick were beginning, Prior received the appointment he requested to be secretary to the embassy at The Hague, beginning on 10 March 1697. In the subsequent drawing up of the treaty of Ryswick (9 May &#150; 20/21 September 1697), it was Prior's function to check the French and Latin versions of the negotiations.<br>
<br>Prior's poems during his seven years at The Hague assumed a much more laureate bent, celebrating British war victories and events in the life of the royal family. From this period dates his most famous and successful such poem, &#145;An English Ballad, on the Taking of Namur by the King of Great Britain, 1695&#146;, in which Prior takes Nicolas Boileau's earlier &#145;Ode sur la prise de Namur, par les armes du roy, l'ann&eacute;e 1692&#146;, in a stanza by stanza refutation and demythologizing. Boileau had referred to himself (or Pindar) as an audacious eagle; Prior reduces him to a handsomely paid vulture. Boileau had described Louis XIV's plume as a leading star; Prior retorts that it was more like a short-lived meteor.<br>
<br>Prior wrote two other equally successful poems in two very different veins during this same seven-year Hague period. In &#145;Written in the Year 1696&#146; Prior describes his unusual Saturday and Sunday activities at The Hague and hence, by indirection, his usual daily activities there. &#145;To the Honourable Charles Montague, Esq.&#146; strikes the note of melancholy which was to characterize Prior's treatment of a favourite moral insistence that mankind can console itself with imagined pleasures, for the truth, if seen, is bleak.<br>
<br>Prior was physically much the same figure when he first went to The Hague at twenty-six as he was thirty years later: thin, wooden-faced, red-cheeked, already somewhat easy prey to the lung and intestinal disorders that were to mark his remaining thirty years and eventually claim his life.<br>
<br>By the year he went to The Hague, Prior had also established an intimate relationship with Jane, or Jinny, Ansley (also known as Jane Flanders), and while helping to draw up the treaty of Ryswick in 1697 he had met at the congress of Ryswick a man who was to become his friend, amanuensis, transcriber, and preserver of his manuscript poems after his death, Adrian Drift. Like Prior, Drift was London-born and came to the congress of Ryswick in the service of the earl of Jersey.<h2>
<a name="FirstyearsinParis16981699"></a>First years in Paris, 1698&#150;1699</h2>On his return to England in November 1697 Prior expected to be sent to Dublin to assume his duties as secretary to the lords justices. Instead, he was sent to the reopened British embassy in Paris as secretary to the new ambassador, William Bentinck, first earl of Portland. Prior's appointment was announced by 11 December 1697; he and Portland left for Paris one month later, on 21 January 1698. During his brief sojourn in London, Prior had been nominated as a fellow of the Royal Society. He was elected to membership in his absence, possibly on 23 March 1698. Meanwhile in Paris, Prior had his first private audience with Louis XIV on 4 February 1698; in mid-August of the same year he saw the exiled James II and his queen; still later he glimpsed the young Stuart prince. Prior had few official duties during his early stay in France, his main responsibility being to report to his superiors in England the activities of those in power in France and of the Jacobites there. When the earl of Portland left France in June 1698, the earl of Jersey was appointed to succeed him, arriving in September of that year.<br>
<br>In his initial nineteen-month stay in Paris, Prior found his expenses painfully greater than his pay, so when in April 1699 the fourth earl and first duke of Manchester was appointed to replace Jersey in Paris and Jersey was appointed secretary of state for the southern department, Prior at his own request was sent back to London as under-secretary of state, leaving Paris on 27 August 1699. In these nineteen months in Paris he had produced no poems, but had established a network of friendships and favourable recognitions from such political figures as the duc de Villeroy, the marquis de Torcy, and Louis XIV himself, and such literary figures as Boileau, Dacier, and Fontenelle.<h2>
<a name="FurtherLondonyears16991711"></a>Further London years, 1699&#150;1711</h2>From Paris, Prior travelled first to Loo in Holland to report to William III. Through William's intercession, Prior was permitted to keep his Irish post, <i>in absentia</i>, and was given an allowance of &pound;600 per year as well, to continue until he received a new government post. From Loo, Prior journeyed to The Hague and returned from there to London with William III and the earl of Jersey. For the remaining two years of William's life, Prior acted mainly as a peripatetic diplomatic agent, going on repeated journeys to Paris and Marly, in secret negotiations with Louis XIV on the second partition treaty. On 28 June 1700 he was appointed a commissioner of the Board of Trade and Plantations, succeeding John Locke, who had resigned because of poor health. The Board of Trade and Plantations oversaw the governing of all the American colonies and supervised all international English trade.<br>
<br>Although Prior was frequently ill during this twelve-year sojourn in London, it was also a significant social period for him. By 1700 he had become a member of the Kit-Cat Club, the gathering of whig wits that included Charles Montagu, Jacob Tonson, Joseph Addison, Richard Steele, William Congreve, and the earl of Dorset. But Prior, like his friend Jonathan Swift a few years later, found himself moving away from the whig political positions to the tory ones, especially in his belief that England needed a strong king, unhampered by the majority opposition in parliament.<br>
<br>In 1700 Prior decided to run for the position of member of parliament from Cambridge, presenting himself as an independent. When it became apparent that he had neither the funds nor the time to run for this position, he accepted instead, from the earl of Dorset, membership in parliament from the pocket borough of East Grinstead, a position that he held for five months (February&#150;June 1701). The last surviving child of Queen Anne had just died, and the whigs feared that on Anne's death a Stuart would be brought in from France to rule. The issue came to a climax during Prior's brief term in parliament in a vote of censure on the partition treaty, which Prior himself had had some hand in drawing up. The treaty had never been popular in England, had never been signed by the Austrian emperor, and was later repudiated by Louis XIV. Prior voted with the tories to impeach the four leading whigs involved in drawing up the treaty&#151;barons Somers and Halifax (Prior's old friend Charles Montagu) and the earls of Orford and Portland.<br>
<br>Prior explained later that <i>not</i> to vote to impeach these lords would have been to blame William himself for the unpopular treaty, but by his vote he had estranged himself from any further whig patronage and from the whig party itself. The earl of Dorset did not award him again the pocket borough seat in parliament; the earl of Portland and Charles Montagu were no longer his friends; his membership in the Kit-Cat Club was abruptly terminated. Yet Prior avoided much of the bitterness often attendant on political shifts in party; he later patched up his friendship with the Montagus, and Horace Walpole, son of the greatest whig of the eighteenth century, later wrote that &#145;Prior is much a favourite with me, <i>though a Tory</i>, nor did I ever hear anything ill of him. He left his party, but not his friends, and seems to me to have been very amiable&#146;  (letter to William Cole, 10 June 1778, in Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 2.90).<br>
<br>Even in this period of his relative prosperity, Prior often found himself in financial distress. He was not paid his salary as one of the commissioners of trade and plantations from 29 September 1700 to 8 March 1702. Yet in 1700 he had increased his expenses by buying &#145;Matt's Palace&#146;, a Westminster house on the west side of Duke Street, overlooking St James's Park to the rear. A source of great pleasure to Prior, the palatial house was his chief home for the remaining twenty years of his life. During the last three years of William's life, Prior had written a wide-ranging variety of original poems: political poems and laureate verse, love songs, poems to and about children, two more Horatian nostalgic requests for the simple life. But Anne's succession to the throne in 1702 limited Prior's political activities for two reasons&#151;she disapproved of appointing to public political office those of &#145;meane extraction&#146; (as she described Prior), and Sarah, duchess of Marlborough, her trusted friend, considered herself Prior's implacable enemy.<br>
<br>During this same period in London, Prior courted Elizabeth Singer (later Elizabeth Rowe), the poet, whom he met at Longleat, the country seat of Viscount Weymouth, in the autumn of 1703. He wrote her nine extant letters and two poems, but neither of the participants seems to have taken the courtship very seriously. Slightly later during this same period (between 1706 and 1708), Jane Ansley was replaced in Prior's affections by Anne Durham, who remained his mistress for perhaps a decade, until she was at least twenty-six. When he returned to Paris she accompanied him. When the two finally parted, Prior set her up in business, apparently as proprietor of a small shop, and left her &pound;300 in his will at his death three years afterwards. Less demanding than his other two mistresses, she seemed genuinely grieved at his death and satisfied with her legacy.<br>
<br>In 1709 Prior published <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span>, the first of two so-named collections of his poetry that he was to supervise and bring out during his lifetime. Prior himself spoke of the poetry contained in this collection as divided into four categories&#151;&#145;Public Panegyrics&#146;, &#145;Amorous Odes&#146;, &#145;Idle Tales&#146;, and &#145;Serious Reflections&#146;&#151;but some of its most famous poems (<span class="italic">Henry and Emma</span>, &#145;An English Padlock&#146;, and &#145;Jinny the Just&#146;) do not fit easily into any one of these four categories.<br>
<br>Another equally significant result for Prior of these dozen years when he was based in London was the cementing of his friendship with Swift and the Tory Brothers Club, which ranged from seventeen to twenty-two members, and met weekly during the last years of Queen Anne's reign. Swift's <span class="italic">Journal to Stella</span> records at least thirteen occasions when Prior dined with Swift, often with all the Brothers but sometimes with only two or three of them. On 21 February 1711 Swift records that he and Prior often walked together in St James's Park (behind Prior's &#145;Duke Street Palace&#146;). &#145;This walking is a strange remedy&#146;, he wrote to Stella; &#145;Mr. Prior walks to make himself fat, and I to bring myself down&#146;  (J. Swift, <span class="italic">Journal to Stella</span>, ed. H. Williams, 2 vols., 1948, 1.198). On another occasion he wrote that &#145;Prior and I stayed on, where we complimented one another for an hour or two upon our mutual wit and poetry&#146;  (ibid., 1.98). Several of Swift's anonymous political writings were attributed by their readers to Prior, and Swift reported to Stella that a whig newspaper had called Prior and him &#145;the two Sosias&#146;  (ibid., 2.422).<h2>
<a name="NegotiationswithFrance17121715"></a>Negotiations with France, 1712&#150;1715</h2>During the latter part of June 1711 Robert Harley, now earl of Oxford and lord treasurer, asked that Prior be sent to France along with Abb&eacute; Fran&ccedil;ois Gaultier, the French priest who was serving similarly as a secret negotiator for the opposite side. On 12 July 1711 Prior and Gaultier left London and eventually crossed the channel incognito and journeyed to Fontainebleau. There Prior entered into negotiations with Jean Baptiste Colbert, marquis de Torcy, his friendly acquaintance from his previous mission in Paris over a decade before. After ten days of negotiation and an audience with Louis XIV, Prior (still travelling under a false passport) set out once more for England, this time accompanied by Nicholas Mesnager, who was empowered to carry out further negotiations on behalf of France in England. However, Prior was apprehended and briefly gaoled by an over-zealous English customs official. The secret negotiations were secret no longer, and when Swift attempted to divert attention by an imaginative satiric spoof, a pamphlet called <span class="italic">A New Journey to Paris: together with some Secret Transactions between the Fr&#151;h K&#151;g, and an Eng&#151; Gentleman</span>, he probably made matters worse, for his &#145;pure inventions&#146; came uncomfortably close at several points to the fiercely guarded truth.<br>
<br>Prior was annoyed, but the peace negotiations continued through August and September 1711, often at Prior's Duke Street house, where Mesnager was sequestered. On 8 October 1711 three documents were signed as preliminary treaties between England and France. Prior's share in drawing up these documents, to become the basis of the treaty of Utrecht, was so conspicuous that the whigs derisively called the preliminary treaties &#145;Matt's peace&#146;. Yet although the English government wished to name Prior as plenipotentiary to protect Britain's commercial interests, Queen Anne did so only grudgingly, and Lord Strafford, ambassador at The Hague (described by Swift as &#145;proud as hell&#146;), flatly refused to serve with Prior. Prior nevertheless continued to function behind the scenes during the final negotiations, in both London and Paris. His comings and goings across the channel were at this period of sufficient importance in the mind of the English populace that Swift could write to Stella &#145;Prior is just come over from France for a few days; I suppose, upon some important affair. I saw him last night, but had no private talk with him. Stocks rise upon his coming&#146;  (J. Swift, <span class="italic">Journal to Stella</span>, ed. H. Williams, 2 vols., 1948, 2.566).<br>
<br>Finally, on 11 April 1713, the treaty of Utrecht was signed between England, Holland, Portugal, Prussia, Savoy, and France, ending the War of the Spanish Succession for these nations. The duke of Shrewsbury wrote to the earl of Oxford, on 8 March 1713, of Prior's role in the treaty of Utrecht:<blockquote>I think I may congratulate your Lordship that the peace is made, in which if by good fortune I have any share, I must do Mr. Prior the justice to inform you, that I have been in so particular a manner assisted by his zeal, diligence and ability that I hope he will be immediately encouraged and countenanced by some mark of your Lordship's favour. (<span class="italic">Bath MSS</span>, 230)</blockquote>However, in the celebrations that followed the signing of the treaty of Utrecht, Prior fell ill of cholera morbus, recurring fits of vomiting to which he was subject all his mature life, complicated this time by pleurisy as well. Though he remained in Paris, his commission had really expired with the signing of the treaty. He served in the absence of the duke of Shrewsbury as an acting ambassador to France and stayed at Fontainebleau during September and October 1713 at the particular request of Louis XIV. His main role during this period was, at the request of Henry St John, Viscount Bolingbroke, to draw France into a closer military, political, and commercial alliance with England.<h2>
<a name="ArrestandconfinementinLondon17151716"></a>Arrest and confinement in London, 1715&#150;1716</h2>After Anne's death on 1 August 1714, Prior continued his duties in Paris, negotiating with Louis XIV about the destruction of Dunkirk. Prior had already incurred a &pound;5000 debt while serving as unofficial and poorly allowanced ambassador in Paris, and his financial condition worsened when he was removed from his post as commissioner of customs. In January 1715 John Dalrymple, earl of Stair, came to Paris to serve as English ambassador to France and to relieve Prior of his duties there. The whig ministry finally agreed to pay off Prior's ambassadorial debts there, chiefly in order to return him to London for questioning.<br>
<br>The House of Commons had set up a secret committee to investigate corruption and treason in the tory party, particularly as related to the negotiations for the treaty of Utrecht, and Prior and Thomas Harley were arrested and confined in their own homes on Duke Street on 9 June 1715. As Prior later noted in his <span class="italic">History of his Own Time</span>, the secret committee intended to support charges of treason against the earl of Oxford by having Prior verify that the earl had been present at a meeting with Mesnager and Gaultier at Prior's Duke Street house, but Prior replied that either the duke of Shrewsbury or the earl of Oxford had been present, with the other absent, but that he could not recollect, four years later, which man had attended&#151;an answer, Prior recorded, that &#145;had this Effect, that it was the same Thing as if they were both absent, since they could not determine which of them was present&#146;  (M. Prior, <span class="italic">The History of his Own Time</span>, 1740, 417&#150;35). Despite repeated questioning, Prior kept to his story. He was confined in the home of the serjeant-at-arms of the House of Commons for more than a year thereafter, and unable to receive guests without permission of the speaker of the House of Commons or to write or receive letters from friends. But he had managed to protect his tory friends while saving his own neck, the most delicate diplomatic manoeuvring of his whole political career.<br>
<br>Prior was released on 26 June 1716, when parliament was prorogued. Even a year later his name, along with Thomas Harley's and the earl of Oxford's, was omitted from the list of those pardoned by the royal <span class="roman">Act of Grace</span> in July 1717. The injustice of the whole episode rankled with many tories; Prior's name became synonymous with undeserved political ill treatment. Yet it was during the spring months in London, when his life and those of his friends hung in the balance, that Prior wrote one of his most successful poems in domesticating the myth, his &#145;Daphne and Apollo&#146;, and while under house arrest that he wrote the first draft of one of his equally successful longer poems, a favourite of Alexander Pope's, <span class="italic">Alma, or, The Progress of the Mind</span>.<h2>
<a name="Lastyears17161721"></a>Last years, 1716&#150;1721</h2>After he was released, his political career irrevocably ended by the whig&#150;Hanoverian ascent into power, Prior returned to his Duke Street home without any immediate source of funds. To assist him, Bathurst and Lord Harley conceived the scheme of bringing out his poems in a subscription edition. Details of the plan were worked out at a meeting in January 1717, at which Bathurst, Harley, Prior, Pope, Gay, Arbuthnot, and Erasmus Lewis were present. Jacob Tonson, who was much experienced in subscription publication, was to be its publisher, and Alexander Pope, who had himself recently brought out his <span class="italic">Iliad</span> in a very successful subscription, would be a valuable adviser. When the volume finally appeared in mid-March 1719, it was a large, handsome folio, 1 foot across and 1 yard tall, 500 pages long, with a list of 1445 persons who had subscribed for 1786 books. The book reprinted and reordered all the poems from the 1709 edition of <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span> and added a number of poems written since that time, notably <span class="italic">Solomon</span> and <span class="italic">Alma</span>. Though he probably did not make as much money as is commonly cited (4000 guineas), Prior undeniably made a small fortune by this publication and found himself comfortably off for the rest of his life, independently wealthy and no longer dependent on repayments from a remiss and recalcitrant government.<br>
<br>Prior thus found himself free to devote himself to his chief interests beyond politics: women, collecting, friends, a country estate, and writing. By 1715 or 1716 he had met Elizabeth Cox, wife of John Cox, a Long Acre tavern keeper, and by 1718 Betty (Lisetta) had apparently replaced Anne Durham (Cloe) as Prior's mistress. Shortly after Prior's death, Dr Arbuthnot wrote that &#145;PRIOR has had a narrow escape by dying; for, if he had lived, he had married a brimstone bitch, one Bessy Cox, that keeps an alehouse in Long Acre. Her husband died about a month ago&#146;  (<span class="italic">European Magazine and London Review</span>, 13, January 1788, 8).<br>
<br>But an affluent Prior was collecting more than mistresses. A virtuoso, he filled &#145;Matt's Palace&#146; with treasures: coins, medals, jewels, antique bronzes, prints, drawings, and sculptures. Almost a hundred paintings covered the walls of his drawing-room and its adjacent &#145;closet&#146;; his bookshelves were lined with several thousand volumes.<br>
<br>Always a gifted and winning public letter-writer when abroad, Prior displayed the same abilities as a private correspondent at home in retirement. Through his correspondence he kept up his friendship with Swift, whom he never saw again, and in person he strengthened his friendship with Adrian Drift, who moved into the Duke Street house at the latest by the end of 1717 to serve as amanuensis, companion, and friend. Drift wrote after Prior's death that Prior had honoured him with &#145;Esteem and Affection full Five &amp; Twenty Years, without One harsh word ever falling from his Tongue&#146;  (Rippy, <span class="italic">Prior</span>, 38). Finally, the brightest new friendship which Prior made during his last years was with Edward Harley, son of the earl of Oxford, his wife, Lady Harriett, and his daughter, Margaret Cavendish Harley, later duchess of Portland. The Harleys and Prior became close friends; three solemn poems of Prior's last years are responses to the parents, and a charming poem (&#145;My Noble, Lovely, Little Peggy&#146;) and the coda to another (&#145;The Turtle and the Sparrow&#146;) are directed to young Peggy Harley, these last notable in a century that showed little interest in children's poems.<br>
<br>It was partly through Harley that Prior was able to realize his wish to own a country estate&#151;Down Hall near Hatfield Broad Oak in Essex. Harley provided Prior with half the amount necessary for its purchase in return for an agreement that the property would revert to Harley at Prior's death. Prior engaged James Gibbs to draw up plans and specifications for the new house and Charles Bridgeman to plan its gardens&#151;and wrote a long, colloquial poem, &#145;Down Hall: a Ballad&#146;, about his mixed anticipations and disillusionments connected with its first viewing. But his sudden death put an end to all this estate planning. Down Hall, with a number of improvements already made, reverted to Harley. Two other financial arrangements that Prior had worked out with Harley&#151;with Prior's paying a large lump sum to begin with and Harley then paying Prior an annuity for every year he lived&#151;would have had to exist for ten years for Prior to break even (excluding any calculation of interest). Prior lived only four years after the first and two years after the second. Harley, as Drift wrote, &#145;was a Gainer by Mr. Prior's Death by the sum of &pound;2058. 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>.&#146;<br>
<br>During the two years after the appearance of his subscription edition and before his sudden death, Prior continued to write poems, the most notable three being &#145;The Conversation: a Tale&#146;, &#145;The Turtle and the Sparrow&#146;, and ten fragments of &#145;Predestination, a Poem&#146;.<br>
<br>In August 1721 Prior went to visit Wimpole as a guest of the Harleys. On 11 September he once again fell violently ill of cholera morbus. On 13 September he seemed somewhat better, but the attacks resumed that evening, and he died at one in the afternoon on 18 September 1721. On Friday 22 September his body was carried to Westminster Abbey in a hearse accompanied by a mourning coach, each drawn by six horses and escorted by an outrider. The body lay in state in the historic Jerusalem chamber for three days. The funeral, held on 25 September, was attended by, among others, Richard Shelton (probably Prior's closest personal friend), Dr Arbuthnot, Erasmus Lewis, forty king's scholars from Westminster School, carrying white tapers, seventy men in mourning with branchlights, and a dozen almsmen with torches. A few weeks after the funeral, all those who had been present, and forty-two persons who had not, received gold mourning rings engraved &#145;M. Prior. Ob: 18.Sep:1721 Aetat 57&#146;. James Gibbs, who had drawn up the plans for Prior's new country estate at Down Hall, instead designed his &#145;stately Monument&#146;, the most sumptuous in the Poets' Corner of Westminster Abbey, planned by Prior himself and wryly described by him as &#145;this last piece of human vanity&#146;.<br>
<br>Prior, famous British diplomatist, was arguably the most important poet writing in English between the death of Dryden (1700) and the poetic majority of Pope in 1712. To his friend Jonathan Swift he gave specific lines and, more significantly and pervasively, an elegant courtliness and ease of familiar verse that Swift had not hitherto mastered. In 1723, as his prospective editor, Pope read almost everything extant of Prior's, looking closely at Prior as he did at Dryden, as a literary figure whose unusual merit both he and the English reading public conceded without question. His own work displays a lasting awareness of Prior's example. Prior likewise influenced Samuel Johnson in two of Johnson's works that shared Prior's Christian pessimism: <span class="italic">The Vanity of Human Wishes</span> (1749) and <span class="italic">Rasselas</span> (1755). Among lesser eighteenth-century writers influenced by the poetry of Prior were William Cowper, Anne Finch, countess of Winchilsea, and John, Charles, and Samuel Wesley the younger in England, Allan Ramsay in Scotland, and Christoph Martin Wieland and Friedrich von Hagedorn in Germany.<br>
<br>As the eighteenth century moved into heavy use of the heroic couplet form, Prior continued to practise other forms commoner in the Restoration&#151;anapaests, tetrameter, lyrical lyrics, <i>vers de soci&eacute;t&eacute;</i>&#151;and helped to keep these feet and syllables and tones alive through eighteenth-century English verse, as minor streams within a major current of heroic couplet versification. Finally, his very successful 1717&#150;19 subscription edition of his <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span> made a useful point: that a popular poet might make a small fortune from a subscription edition of his original poems, not just as a translator but as a practising poet, without dependence on one particular titled patron.<br>
