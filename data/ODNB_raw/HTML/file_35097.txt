<span class="headword">Molyneux, Sir  Robert Henry  More-</span>  (1838&#150;1904), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, born on 7 August 1838, was the third and youngest son of James More-Molyneux of Loseley Park, Guildford, and his wife, Caroline Isabella, the eldest daughter of William F. Lowndes-Stone of Brightwell Park, Oxfordshire. After being educated at private schools he entered the navy in 1852. As a cadet and midshipman of the <i>Sans Pareil</i> he served in the Black Sea during the campaign of 1854, when he was at the bombardment of Odessa and the attack on Sevastopol on 17 October, and as a midshipman of the <i>Russell</i> he took part in the Baltic expedition of 1855. In 1859 he was a mate of the <i>Vesuvius</i>, employed on the west coast of Africa in the suppression of the slave trade, and was mentioned in dispatches for services in a colonial gunboat up the Great Scarcies River; in the same year, with two boats, he captured an armed slaver brig off the Congo, and for this was promoted lieutenant (28 June 1859). He served from January 1860 to 1865 on the Mediterranean station, first in the <i>St Jean d'Acre</i>, afterwards in the flagship <i>Edgar</i>, and on 18 December 1865 was promoted commander.<br>
<br>In June 1866 More-Molyneux was appointed executive officer of the frigate <i>Doris</i> on the North America and West Indies station, and while serving in her received the thanks of the Admiralty and of the French government for valuable services rendered to the transport <i>Gironde</i>, wrecked off Jamaica; he was also recognized by the Admiralty for services after the great hurricane at St Thomas in 1867. In July 1869 he was appointed to command the <i>St Vincent</i>, a training ship for boys, and on 6 February 1872 was promoted captain. More-Molyneux married in 1874 Annie Mary Carew, the daughter of Captain Matthew Charles Forster RN. She died in 1898, leaving a daughter, Gwendolen.<br>
<br>In May 1877 More-Molyneux was appointed to command the <i>Ruby</i>, in which he served in the Levant during the Russo-Turkish War (1877&#150;8) and then in Burma. He was captain of the <i>Invincible</i>, the flagship of Vice Admiral Sir Frederick Seymour, at the bombardment of Alexandria, and afterwards during the war, and was awarded the Osmanie (third class) and the CB. In May 1884 he was appointed commodore commanding the ships in the Red Sea, and protected Suakin until the arrival of Sir Gerald Graham's expedition in 1885. He was mentioned in dispatches and was advanced to the KCB. He next served as captain-superintendent of Sheerness Dockyard until promoted to his flag on 1 May 1888. He was an aide-de-camp to Queen Victoria from 1885 to 1888.<br>
<br>More-Molyneux's further service was administrative and advisory. In 1889 he was one of the British representatives at the International Marine Conference at Washington, and from August 1891 to August 1894 he was admiral-superintendent at Devonport. On 28 May 1894 he became vice-admiral, and on 13 July 1899 admiral. From October 1900 until his retirement in August 1903 he was president of the Royal Naval College at Greenwich, and he was promoted GCB in November 1902. He died at Cairo on 29 February 1904. His body was embalmed, sent home, and buried at St Nicholas's Church, Guildford.<br>
