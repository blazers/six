<span class="headword">Ste M&egrave;re-&Eacute;glise,  William  de</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1224), <span class="occ">administrator and bishop of London</span>, took his name from the Norman ducal manor of Ste M&egrave;re-&Eacute;glise, where he and his mother had a royal pension in 1195. His family&#151;which may have been connected to that of William de Revi&egrave;res (or Vernon), fifth earl of Devon (<i>d</i>. 1217)&#151;was important to him: he bought marriages in England for four kinswomen; he provided for two nephews there; and in the chapter of St Paul's he made three men of his name canons of St Paul's. Presumably he had a clerical but not a university education, since he is never addressed as master. But at some time before 1182 he had won admission to the service of Henry II, and by 1183 he was being styled &#145;clerk of the chamber&#146;. During Henry's last years he became one of the king's most trusted servants, even attesting royal writs. His power attracted gifts of land and ecclesiastical livings, including the prebend of Haydour-cum-Walton in Lincoln Cathedral. The king also rewarded him with the wealthy deanery of the collegiate church of Mortain.<br>
<br>William remained with Henry up until his death on 6 July 1189, but two months later he had followed Richard I to England. He soon obtained from the new king prebends in the cathedrals of York and London, as well as the prestigious deanery of St Martin's-le-Grand in London. During the ensuing months William was often at court, and seems to have taken up duties in the chamber again. He was supposed to have taken the cross, but accompanied Richard on his crusade only as far as V&eacute;zelay. They parted on 4 July 1190, and for nearly three years William's whereabouts are unknown. He is next to be found visiting the captive king in Germany in late March 1193. Hubert Walter, bishop of Salisbury, was also there on his way home from the crusade, and they returned to England together, William carrying Richard's letters nominating Hubert to the archbishopric of Canterbury. When Hubert had been elected, he returned the favour by making William archdeacon of Wiltshire, thus giving him a prebend in Salisbury Cathedral.<br>
<br>In one of Richard's letters William is called &#145;protonotary&#146;, but any connection he had with the chancery must have been brief, since he was soon involved in the raising of the king's enormous ransom. In that connection he made two or three more trips to Germany and accompanied Richard back to England in March 1194. He was in Richard's company almost constantly while the king was in England, including his solemn crown-wearing at Winchester. But when Richard went to France in May, William stayed in England, a very important figure in the government of Hubert Walter, now chief justiciar. For two and a half years William was keeper of the king's escheats in southern England, and during that same time he acted as one of the two justices of the Jews. In the great eyre of 1194 he led one of the circuits, and in the justiciar's court at Westminster he sat once in 1194, occasionally in 1195, and regularly in 1196, though rarely thereafter. William's principal sphere of activity was the exchequer, where he became a highly respected figure. In reward for his service Richard nominated him to the bishopric of London, ordering the election to take place at the royal court in Normandy on 7 December 1198. On 23 May 1199 William made his profession of obedience to Archbishop Hubert Walter and was consecrated in St Katherine's Chapel, Westminster, in the presence of thirteen other bishops.<br>
<br>By then King Richard was dead, and William's first major act as bishop was to participate in the coronation of King John on 27 May 1199. And until June 1208 William's talents were much used by John: he was one of the king's special counsellors; he was sent on diplomatic missions to Germany in 1204 and to Scotland in 1205; he served in the exchequer regularly; he authorized royal writs and assessed royal charters for confirmation; and he often witnessed the king's charters. Many royal gifts, both for himself and his church, showed how high he stood in the king's regard. At the same time, William was also active in the affairs of the church. He obtained a papal confirmation of the deanship of the province of Canterbury for the bishops of London, and three times in the illness or absence of the archbishop William consecrated bishops. He attended a provincial council held by Hubert Walter at Westminster on 19 September 1200. Newly elected abbots of Westminster sought William's blessing in 1200 and in 1213 (the latter while he was in exile in France). He appears to have conducted diocesan business himself, for no episcopal official is known for him. His relations with his canons were good, even with Peter of Blois, archdeacon of London, who presented William with his treatise <span class="italic">De amicitia Christiana</span>. William was also the recipient of several papal mandates to act as judge-delegate, indicating the pope's confidence in his abilities and integrity.<br>
<br>The death of Hubert Walter in 1205 precipitated a great struggle between King John and Pope Innocent III (<i>r</i>. 1198&#150;1216), and William was placed squarely in the middle of it when the pope ordered him, along with the bishops of Ely and Worcester, either to obtain John's acceptance of Stephen Langton as archbishop of Canterbury or to impose an interdict upon the kingdom. After pleading with John for nearly eight months, the three bishops reluctantly proclaimed the interdict on 24 March 1208 and then fled the country. They were to remain in exile for five years, though they were invited back to England to negotiate with the king or the chief justiciar in the summer of 1208 for eight weeks, and twice again in 1209 for shorter periods. But the negotiations came to nothing, and the pope ordered them to excommunicate the king. When that also did not move John, in 1212 William and Eustace of Ely travelled to Rome with Stephen Langton to persuade the pope to authorize the king of France to invade England. This threat did bring John to heel, and the exiles were able to return to England on 16 July 1213.<br>
<br>After John failed to reconquer his continental possessions in 1214, he returned to find England seething with conspiracies against his rule. Hoping to protect himself with the privileges of a crusader, he took the cross on 4 March 1215 at the hands of the bishop of London in his cathedral. When, in June, John was forced to come to terms at Runnymede, William is represented, along with others, as advising the king to grant the great charter of liberties to his people. William was one of eight bishops at Oxford a month later when John met the barons' representatives to implement <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span>. But thereafter William is conspicuous by his absence from all accounts of the baronial war and the French invasion. He may have attended the Fourth Lateran Council; on 29 September 1215 he was in France in the company of two prelates who are known to have gone to Rome. But he appears to have been in his diocese in October 1216 and April 1217; he may have taken up residence in Coggeshall Abbey, where some of his horses were commandeered by royalist troops. William did not attend the first coronation of Henry III nor his first great council at Gloucester in November 1216. But when peace had been made and another charter of liberties was issued on 6 November 1217, it was by the counsel and in the cathedral of the bishop of London. On or about that same date he was present at the reopening of the exchequer, and a year later he was one of the great council present at the inauguration of the new royal seal.<br>
<br>For another three years William served Henry III as he had served his grandfather, uncle, and father. He witnessed a royal document as late as 25 April 1220, and on 5 October he was asked to go to Llywelyn of Wales. But soon afterwards William obtained from the pope permission to resign his bishopric because of his great age. This he did on 25 or 26 January 1221, but retained his episcopal dignity and &pound;100 of the revenues of the see for his maintenance. The custody of Colchester Castle, awarded to him in 1218, he also kept until at least December 1223. But at some point he took the habit of an Augustinian canon at the abbey of St Osyth on the east coast of Essex. There he built a chapel for his burial place, and he established a chantry for his soul, as he also did at St Paul's. He died at St Osyth's in 1224, probably on 27 March, and was buried there the following day. Many years earlier William had been denounced by Gerald of Wales as a mere follower of the court and a familiar of the king, but at his death he was remembered as a man of a great name and not a little authority, as one who had suffered great tribulation for the liberty of the church, and as an example of humility in his resignation of his see.<br>
