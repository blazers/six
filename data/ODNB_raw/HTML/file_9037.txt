<span class="headword">Eyre, Sir  Samuel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1638, <em>d.</em> 1698), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was baptized on 16 March 1638 at St Edmund's Church, Salisbury, Wiltshire, the fourth of the five children of Robert Eyre (<i>c</i>.1610&#150;1655) and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56086/', "Anne Eyre (1612/13&#150;1681)")</script>, daughter of Samuel Aldersey, merchant and haberdasher of London, and his first wife, Mary, daughter of Philip van Oyrle of Nuremberg and Antwerp. His grandfather was Robert Eyre (1569&#150;1638), a bencher of Lincoln's Inn and prominent puritan. Samuel was brought up in Salisbury by his parents, also puritans. In November 1646 his uncle William Eyre, a bencher of Lincoln's Inn, left him some valuable lands and tenements called Bonhams in South Newton near Salisbury, plus a library of law books provided he took up a legal career when the time came. On 9 December 1653 Eyre matriculated from Wadham College, Oxford. The following June he was admitted to Lincoln's Inn. His father died in March 1655, leaving moveable possessions worth &pound;251 and about thirty properties yielding rental income, including the Blue Boar, Talbot, and Bell inns in Salisbury.<br>
<br>In June 1661 Eyre qualified at Lincoln's Inn as a barrister. On 21 October 1661, at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, he married Martha, third daughter of Francis Lucy, and received her &pound;1800 portion. The couple lived at Newhouse Redlynch, a few miles from Salisbury, which Eyre had purchased the previous year, and had four sons including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9036/', "Sir Robert Eyre")</script>, judge of the queen's bench, and two daughters. For over thirty years Eyre followed his profession in Lincoln's Inn and Westminster Hall. In 1677 he had access on four occasions to the earl of Shaftesbury, imprisoned in the Tower, to whom he was reputed to be confidential adviser. By 1678 he was legal guardian of his lunatic sister Margaret, widow of Thomas Hassell of London, merchant tailor. He was active in Lincoln's Inn affairs, being called to the bench (1675), keeper of the black book (1685), and treasurer (1688). In 1685 he was asked to consult Sir Christopher Wren about repairing the chapel. As the executor of his aunt Margaret Blechinden, whose will was proved in 1684, Eyre built Blechinden's Almshouses, for six poor widows over the age of fifty, in Winchester Street, Salisbury. At some point after 1683 he was involved in a dispute about lands which he held as trustee on behalf of Whiteparish church, Wiltshire. He can probably be identified with the Samuel Eyre, esquire, who was one of the two candidates elected to represent Salisbury in the convention of 1689 but who was displaced when it was decided that the right to choose representatives lay with the city's mayor and corporation.<br>
<br>Eyre's puritan background and association with Shaftesbury probably precluded his promotion until after the revolution of 1688. He was made a serjeant on 21 April 1692. On 6 February 1694 he was knighted and appointed one of the four judges of the king's bench at a salary of &pound;250 per term. In 1694 Eyre was one of the judges who decided in favour of Charles Knollys, charged with murder, and liberated him because the indictment should have named him as earl of Banbury. During this case Eyre remarked, &#145;The House of Lords could no more deprive one of a Peerage than they could confer a Peerage&#146;  (Salkeld, 510). Eyre's cases were quite often in the news. It was reported in June 1694 that the case between the king and the bankers had been argued in the exchequer court by Eyre and his cousin Sir Giles Eyre, both of whom were of opinion against the king. That this was only four months after his appointment demonstrates his courage and impartiality. In September 1694 it was reported that he and three other judges formed a special commission of oyer and terminer that was visiting Lancashire and Cheshire to try the prisoners of state who were in custody there. Eyre was one of the judges at several trials for high treason, perhaps the most notorious case being the assassination plot of 1696, when Ambrose Rookwood and his fellow conspirators were sentenced to death for plotting the king's death. However, not all of Eyre's cases were so dramatic. He was often on circuit and he was required to report back to Whitehall on cases involving such diverse offences as horse-stealing, Jacobite meetings, housebreaking, disorders, and forgery. Among the places he visited for these trials were Norwich, Oxford, Maidstone, Kingston, Worcester, and Stafford.<br>
<br>In February 1698 the House of Lords asked Eyre and Chief Justice Holt to give reasons for the decision they had made four years earlier in the case of the earl of Banbury; both courageously refused and were threatened with the Tower, but the matter was dropped a few days later. Eyre's speech to the House of Lords committee at this critical juncture included the following: &#145;The King intrusts me with the administration of justice. I have ever given my opinion upon the greatest consideration and upon my conscience&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 12.1180). We can accept this as a true statement of how he approached his judicial duties, and indeed his whole life, reflecting his early upbringing and his honesty and integrity. Eyre died on circuit at Lancaster of colic on 12 September 1698, and a monument was erected to him there. His body was removed to St Thomas's, Salisbury, and reburied on 2 July 1699. Martha, his &#145;ever dear and faithful wife&#146; (as his will described her) survived until 1728.<br>
