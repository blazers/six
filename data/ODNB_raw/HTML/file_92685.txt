<span class="headword">Prince,  Frank Templeton</span>  (1912&#150;2003), <span class="occ">poet and scholar</span>, was born in Kimberley, South Africa, on 13 September 1912, the second of three children of Henry (Harry) Prince (formerly Prinz), a diamond merchant from London's East End, of Dutch descent, and his wife, Margaret Templeton, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hetherington, a teacher from Scotland. Prince's father was Jewish, his mother Presbyterian. Despite this he was educated at the Catholic Christian Brothers' College in his native Kimberley before attending the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. He came to England in 1931 to study English at Balliol College, Oxford, obtaining a first class degree in 1934; in 1935 he took up a one-year graduate fellowship at Princeton University in New Jersey. In the mid-1930s he also spent time travelling, notably in Italy, where he deepened his knowledge of its language, art, architecture, and culture. He also made a pilgrimage to Ireland in order to meet Yeats, who for him was and would remain &#145;the greatest poet of the twentieth century&#146;  (Devereux, 6).<br>
<br>In the late 1930s Prince converted to Catholicism, a faith he held to firmly until his death. Shortly after completing his undergraduate studies, he was already contributing to T. S. Eliot's influential magazine <span class="italic">The Criterion</span>, which printed three of his early poems. These were reprinted in his first book, <span class="italic">Poems</span>, published in 1938 by Faber and Faber, whose poetry list was edited by Eliot. Prince was thus among those who joined that precocious trio&#151;George Barker, David Gascoyne, and Dylan Thomas&#151;as very promising &#145;first-volumed&#146; poets in the 1930s. The final issue of <span class="italic">The Criterion</span> (January 1939) contained a not entirely favourable review of Prince's book by Janet Adam Smith. These were early days and, anyway, Prince later agreed that the book &#145;was altogether out of tune with the needs and thoughts of the time&#146;  (Devereux, 9). Perhaps Janet Adam Smith and other reviewers can be forgiven for not finding in the poems the complex beauty, enigmatic power, and tradition-based high modern strategies which would give later readers cause for rejoicing. Subsequently there was a significant analysis by Donald Davie of Prince's early Browning-influenced &#145;An Epistle to a Patron&#146;, a poem highly regarded by poets as different from each other as Geoffrey Hill and John Ashbery, as well as by American writers of the New York Poets and L-A-N-G-U-A-G-E schools. For all of these, Prince's sophisticated mastery of elaborate syntax as a matrix of thought or rather of educated feeling&#151;influenced by Milton and Henry James, Mallarm&eacute; and Proust, as well as Italian poets such as Giovanni della Casa&#151;was a key virtue. Prince, however, raised his eyebrows at one sentence in Davie's analysis: &#145;And so this splendid poem goes on. There is no reason why it should ever stop&#146;  (Davie, 92). Every reason, Prince told one of his publishers: &#145;it has a beginning, middle and end&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>Prince joined the study groups department at the Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House) in 1937 and worked there until 1940, when he embarked upon his six years' service in the Army Intelligence Corps. Halfway through his army service, on 8 March 1943, by then a captain, he married, at the church of St James in Manchester Square, London, (Pauline) Elizabeth Bush (<i>b</i>. 1920), the daughter of Harold Ferdinand Bush, cotton merchant. His address on the marriage certificate was given as 10 North Street, Bletchley. Apart from a year in Egypt where he was sent shortly after his marriage, he spent his entire war service at Bletchley. The couple had two daughters, born in 1945 and 1948.<br>
<br>After the war Prince joined the faculty of Southampton University, where he became professor of English in 1957 on the strength of his magisterially learned and seminal critical work, <span class="italic">The Italian Element in Milton's Verse</span> (1954), his only published book apart from editions of other poets and the successive volumes of his own poetry. Following the 1938 <span class="italic">Poems</span>, Prince did not bring out another volume until 1954, the same year as the Milton book. Having been dropped by T. S. Eliot, he went (&#145;out of sheer perversity&#146;, he later said) to the egregious Reginald Caton at the Fortune Press, who brought out the eponymous volume <span class="italic">Soldiers Bathing</span>. The book contained many memorable poems, not least the passionate &#145;The Old Age of Michelangelo&#146;. &#145;Soldiers Bathing&#146; itself, written in 1942, was and remained one of the best-known poems of the Second World War. In 1975 Prince even began a reading at the Poetry Society with the words: &#145;I have written other poems, you know&#146;  (private information). The energy of this great poem is generated by powerful rhythmic circuits, its perfectly judged rhymes serving as morphological punctuation, its very syntax meshing the thematic categories of beauty, compassion, ordeal, and revelation, which continued to be concerns throughout his work.<br>
<br>Prince remained at Southampton until his retirement in 1974. His distinguished and distinctive years there included a sabbatical taken at All Souls College, Oxford (1968&#150;9), and delivery of the Clark lectures at Cambridge (1972&#150;3) on Yeats, Eliot, and other poets. These, sadly, were never published and all requests by friends to read them were refused, because the author felt they were not up to scratch. Following <span class="italic">Soldiers Bathing</span>, his next volume of poetry was the handsomely produced <span class="italic">Doors of Stone</span>, published by a fan, Rupert Hart-Davis, in 1963, the same year as his new <span class="roman">Arden</span> edition of Shakespeare's poems. <span class="italic">Doors of Stone</span> reprinted all the poems Prince wanted to preserve from <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1938) and <span class="italic">Soldiers Bathing</span> (1954). The new poems in <span class="italic">Doors of Stone</span> included the masterful and thrilling sequence &#145;Strambotti&#146;, named after this complex stanzaic form which Prince appears to have been the first poet to use since Sir Thomas Wyatt. Over the years, too, Prince brought out various editions of Milton, later dismissed by him as &#145;mere potboilers&#146;. His edition of Wyatt was never published.<br>
<br>After retiring from Southampton, Prince spent most of the next decade as a visiting professor in the USA (at Brandeis University, and Washington University, St Louis), Jamaica (University of the West Indies), and North Yemen (Sana&#145;a&#146; University). But it was in 1970, while he was still at Southampton, that Prince's involvement with small presses began, and it lasted for the rest of his life. Wider questions about British literary culture are raised when such an important poet's books are published outside the commercial mainstream. Thus Fulcrum Press published <span class="italic">Memoirs in Oxford</span> in 1970 (a pamphlet-length ruminative poem, more immediately personal than his earlier dramatic monologues and personae poems). Then Menard Press published his next two pamphlet-length poems, <span class="italic">Drypoints of the Hasidim</span> (1975) and <span class="italic">Afterword on Rupert Brooke</span> (1976). Menard's publisher, Anthony Rudolf, later wrote that he knew he must publish <span class="italic">Drypoints</span>, this &#145;ravishingly beautiful, achingly beautiful long poem&#146; even before inheriting Prince from Fulcrum Press  (&#145;F. T. Prince: a Tribute&#146;, 27). As a professing Roman Catholic, Prince wrote an essay for the magazine <span class="italic">European Judaism</span> on the genesis of the poem.<br>
<br>In 1979 Menard Press co-published, with Anvil Press, Prince's first <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span>. During the 1980s Anvil Press also published two short books, <span class="italic">Later On</span> (1983) and <span class="italic">Walks in Rome</span> (1987), the latter (like <span class="italic">Memoirs in Oxford</span>) one of his rare works of &#145;confessional vulnerability&#146;  (Geoffrey Hill, in &#145;F. T. Prince: a Tribute&#146;, 29) and written in variable syllabics, a vehicle that &#145;mediates between set measures and free verse&#146;  (Anthony Howell, ibid., 36). In 1985&#150;6 Prince was president of the English Association and delivered his polemical presidential address, <span class="italic">Fragment Poetry</span> (1986), in verse. Its tone was typical of the long poems he wrote from 1970, lighter and more direct, lucid and more transparent than the richly imbricated poetry of the previous thirty-five years. The concluding lines served as a summary of his life's work in poetry:<blockquote>
<div class="indent">Last, full<br>
</div>
<div>Meanings are out of fashion;<br>
</div>
<div>But there is a devil,<br>
</div>
<div>A good devil, at work in poetry,<br>
</div>
<div>Who will toil, toil on to damn<br>
</div>
<div>Himself, and save us from ourselves.<br>
</div>
<div>The art itself will try and cry for<br>
</div>
<div>Fullness, meaning, not fragments,<br>
</div>
<div>Like Blake who in the <span class="italic">Proverbs of Hell</span>
<br>
</div>
<div>Cried for &#145;Enough! Or Too much.&#146;<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Fragment Poetry</span>, 10)</blockquote>Anthony Howell's video magazine <span class="italic">Grey Suit</span> published a reading by Prince in 1993, and in the same year Carcanet Press published the later <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span>. By this date it was becoming clear that Prince was a poet of consequence. Influential younger poets such as Mark Ford and Anthony Howell were talking about him, thus following in the precocious footsteps of Lee Harwood a generation earlier. His portraits and dramatic monologues, his deployment of masks and personae&#151;utterly personal to him albeit with a genetic connection to Browning via Pound&#151;allied to the mastery of syntax and traditional verse forms, bespoke a master craftsman, a late high modernist, and in the eyes of many a major poet. His admirers included Geoffrey Hill, J. H. Prynne, John Ashbery, and Donald Davie. He was incisive about the poet's predicament, writing to his publisher in 1975 that &#145;There is always some complexity in one's feelings about a recently completed poem&#151;a mixture of fed-up-ness, disappointment that it isn't better, and pleasure and pride&#146;  (Prince to A. Rudolf, 16 April 1975, priv. coll.) and later that &#145;A poem can sometimes follow a simple intense emotion (more often painful than not), even if it doesn't seem to be directly related. And the ability to go on writing from time to time has to be paid for instantly by instalments of anxiety or misery&#146;  (Prince to A. Rudolf, 16 October 1977, priv. coll.).<br>
<br>Some critics may prefer to rephrase Geoffrey Hill's &#145;confessional vulnerability&#146; in reference to <span class="italic">Walks in Rome</span> as &#145;personal vulnerability&#146;, in order to avoid confusion with what has become known as confessional poetry, than which nothing could have been more foreign to Prince's nature. But whether or not <span class="italic">Walks in Rome</span> and <span class="italic">Memoirs in Oxford</span> are to be characterized as personal or confessional, no poet&#151;when it comes to Prince's other important works&#151;would go to such extremes in terms of masks and personae, &#145;alienation&#146; and rhetoric, if he did not want to tell himself and his readers something profoundly personal, something universally personal indeed, about inner feelings and hidden thoughts, refracted through the lives of other people: a Zulu chief, a sibyl, a patron, a leper, Michelangelo, a group of Hasidic rabbis, Rupert Brooke, Laurence Sterne, and so on. This is not to say that he had something to hide, only that we all have something to hide, in the sense that there is an ineluctable disjunction between inner and outer projections of the self. This is what it means to be human. Moral concerns and intellectual preoccupations are dialectically addressed and are come to terms with, perhaps resolved, in a poetic language so self-aware that the truth-telling qualities of language have themselves to be understood as prime material. Along with language, beauty, compassion, ordeal, and revelation, Prince the poet was also concerned with virtue, faith, morality, and suffering&#151;what one critic called &#145;tragic nobility&#146;  (Kirkham, 76)&#151;for example how a man alone (as in &#145;Les cong&eacute;s de l&eacute;preux&#146;, the valediction of a poet contracting leprosy) confronts the cruel impositions of the world or of God. Conflict and tension are the <i>sine qua non</i> of human existence and, therefore, of the best poetry.<br>
<br>Prince spent the last decade of his life quietly at home in Southampton with his wife, Elizabeth. He died of a stroke at Southampton General Hospital on 7 August 2003, and was survived by his wife and their two daughters.<br>
