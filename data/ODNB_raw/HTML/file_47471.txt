<span class="headword">Atkyns <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Walpole]</span>,  Charlotte</span>  (<em>c.</em>1758&#150;1836), <span class="occ">actress and political activist</span>, was probably born in co. Westmeath, Ireland about 1758, according to her later biographers Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Barbey and E. E. P. Tisdall. She was the youngest of three daughters of Robert Walpole (<i>d</i>. 1803) of Athlone, co. Westmeath, probably the same Robert Walpole who was made a JP in that county in 1771, and his wife, Blancy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Peach (1741/2&#150;1826); her father's name, however, is elsewhere given as William or as Thomas Walpole. She made her stage d&eacute;but as Leonora in <span class="italic">The Padlock</span> by Isaac Bickerstaff at the Crow Street theatre in Dublin in January 1776. In April she transferred for performances at Smock Alley, returning to Crow Street from May until the end of the season. She is known to have appeared in Cork between 7 October and 10 December of that year; in the final weeks of 1776 and into 1777 she returned to Dublin and engagements at Fishamble Street and at Crow Street.<br>
<br>Walpole made her London d&eacute;but at Drury Lane on 2 October 1777, when she played Rosetta in Bickerstaffe's <span class="italic">Love in a Village</span>. She was with the Drury Lane company throughout the 1777&#150;8 season, when she is known to have played Gillian in Charles Dibdin's <span class="italic">The Quaker</span>, Jessica (when she was billed &#145;with a song&#146;) in <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>, Polly in John Gay's <span class="italic">Beggar's Opera</span>, Wilhelmina in Dibdin's <span class="italic">The Waterman</span>, Euphrosyne in George Colman's <span class="italic">Comus</span>, and the Widow Brady (when she performed the &#145;Epilogue Song&#146;) in <span class="italic">The Irish Widow</span> by David Garrick. For these services she was paid &pound;4 per week but in addition she made &pound;48 5<i>s</i>. for her benefit on 1 May 1778.<br>
<br>After the close of the London season Walpole spent the summer at Bath, where she was puffed as a rising star and as being particularly adept in breeches roles. <span class="italic">Felix Farley's Bristol Journal</span> said: &#145;She is a good Singer, an excellent Actress, and it is a matter of dispute with the young Londoners in which characters she appears to most advantage, male or female&#146;  (Barker). Certainly her repertory at Bath included a number of major travesty roles, including Sir Harry Wildair in George Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Constant Couple</span>, Macheath in <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span>, and Lord Foppington in Richard Brinsley Sheridan's <span class="italic">A Trip to Scarborough</span>.<br>
<br>&#145;The pretty Miss Walpole of Drury Lane&#146; returned to that theatre for the 1778&#150;9 season. In what was to be her final season on the stage she expanded her repertory to include Sylvia in Garrick's <span class="italic">Cymon</span>, Clarinda in <span class="italic">The Double Gallant</span> by Colley Cibber, and an unnamed role in Thomas Francklin's <span class="italic">The Contract</span>. In addition she created the role of Nancy (a character described as &#145;in love with William&#151;disguised as a man&#146;) in a musical entertainment assembled by Richard Tickell, <span class="italic">The Camp</span>. For her benefit on 16 April she appeared as Sir Harry Wildair and presented a dance after the main part of the programme.<br>
<br>On 18 June 1779 at St James's, Piccadilly, Walpole married Edward Atkyns (1757/8&#150;1794) of Ketteringham Hall, near Wymondham, in Norfolk, the son of Edward Atkyns, a Hamburg merchant, and great-grandson of the judge Sir Edward Atkyns, and retired from the stage. The couple had a son, Wright Edward Atkyns, who was born in 1780; he was later a captain in the 1st dragoons, or Royals, and died, unmarried, on 16 November 1804. Charlotte Atkyns may have retired from the stage but the ensuing phase in her life would lead to her becoming a character in a successful stage play of 1896, <span class="italic">Pamela, marchande de frivolit&eacute;s</span>, by Victorien Sardou, and part of the folklore surrounding the French Revolution. Atkyns and her husband had left Ketteringham for France by November 1784, probably to escape creditors. They entered court circles at Versailles and, after her move to Lille at the end of 1789, Charlotte Atkyns described herself as a pensioner of France, suggesting favour at court. Information on her career as an &eacute;migr&eacute; activist is difficult to verify. Of the two books dealing with her career the second, E. E. P. Tisdall's <span class="italic">Mrs &#145;Pimpernel&#146; Atkyns</span> (1965), is heavily dependent on the first, Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Barbey's <span class="italic">Une amie de Marie-Antoinette: Madame Atkyns et la prison du temple, 1758&#150;1836</span> (1905), translated into English as <span class="italic">A Friend of Marie-Antoinette</span> (1906). Barbey's book is reliant for many details on papers apparently placed by Atkyns with her notary in Paris, Achille Nicolas Ren&eacute; Tourin, and given to Barbey by Tourin's successor. The subsequent whereabouts of these documents are unknown. It appears that Charlotte and Edward Atkyns returned to Ketteringham in 1791. Charlotte gradually extended her contacts among French &eacute;migr&eacute;s, the most important of whom at this stage was the journalist Jean-Gabriel Peltier, and about August 1793 she departed for France, where she engineered a brief meeting with Marie-Antoinette in the Conci&egrave;rgerie. The queen asked her to concentrate on saving her son the dauphin, regarded by royalists as Louis XVII, following the execution of his father.<br>
<br>The death of Edward Atkyns at Ketteringham on 27 March 1794 probably increased Charlotte Atkyns's freedom of movement; if she did visit France to rescue Louis XVII it was that summer. The letters reproduced by Barbey suggest that she believed that she and her fellow conspirators had done so, although they could not explain what had happened to the dauphin after his supposed rescue from the Temple. Atkyns continued to promote the &eacute;migr&eacute; cause and mortgaged Ketteringham in 1799 to raise funds. She was also involved in domestic politics, sharing in the management of John Wodehouse's unsuccessful campaign to be elected member for Norfolk in 1806 and organizing the petition that overturned the election, although Wodehouse declined to stand again.<br>
<br>Following the restoration of Louis XVIII in 1814 Atkyns petitioned for a payment of between &pound;30,000 and &pound;40,000 to cover her expenditure on the Bourbon cause. Her insistence on including expenses incurred in the supposed rescue of Louis XVII provided the French government with a reason to deny her compensation. Atkyns continued to live in France, latterly at 65 rue de Lille, Paris, and made over Ketteringham to her sister-in-law Mary Atkyns, in return for an annuity, in 1824. She died at 65 rue de Lille on 2 February 1836 and was probably buried in Paris.<br>
