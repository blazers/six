<span class="headword">Skipwith, Sir  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1564&#150;1610), <span class="occ">politician and poet</span>, was born at Tugby, Leicestershire, the eldest surviving son of Henry Skipwith (<i>d</i>. 1588) of Cotes and Keythorpe, Leicestershire, and his wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1598), daughter of Francis Hall of Grantham, Lincolnshire, and widow of Francis Nele of Prestwold and Cotes, Leicestershire. He was educated at Jesus College, Cambridge, in 1580, and was knighted on 30 April 1603.<br>
<br>Sir William was descended from a long line of Lincolnshire gentry. His family became established in Leicestershire when his father, a younger son and equerry to Queen Elizabeth, married the widow of Francis Nele of Prestwold and Tugby and also purchased the manor of Cotes. William served as a volunteer with the earl of Leicester in the Netherlands in 1586, but after his father's death in 1588 settled down to life in the shire, becoming an influential figure in local politics. He was appointed to the county bench in 1592, served as sheriff (1597&#150;8), was one of the commissioners to deal with the midland revolt and problems of depopulation in 1607, and served as knight of the shire in 1601 and MP for Leicester in the parliament of 1604&#150;10. He also played host to Queen Anne and Prince Henry when they stayed in Leicester on their progress south in June 1603.<br>
<br>Skipwith's role in Leicestershire politics was largely determined by his ambiguous relationship with the Hastings family which dominated the local scene. During the late 1590s he was said to be &#145;out of frendship&#146; with the fourth earl of Huntingdon, the head of the family  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Carte 78, fol. 319) and this probably cost him a seat for the county in the parliament of 1597. By 1601 he had to some extent been reconciled with the family and his election for the county that year was probably with Huntingdon's blessing; however, at hearings during the parliament Skipwith sided with George Belgrave who had snubbed the earl during the election for Leicester. Skipwith was on much friendlier terms with George's grandson Henry, who succeeded to the earldom in 1605; however, in local politics he continued to take an independent line. He voiced loud criticisms of abuses by the local purveyor which reflected badly on the earl's management of the service; he also sided with the Greys and the Beaumonts in quarrels with the earl's great-uncle, Walter Hastings. Perhaps as a result of this Huntingdon never promoted him to the prestigious local office of deputy lieutenant. As an MP Skipwith was not a prominent speaker, confining himself mainly to interventions on local issues. None the less he established a reputation, both in Leicestershire and at Westminster, as an exemplary &#145;parliament man&#146;.<br>
<br>Skipwith's standing was also enhanced by his religious and literary activities. There is little evidence for his personal piety, but he showed his support for local puritans when the opportunity arose and was regarded as one of their chief allies. In May 1603 he arrested trouble-makers in Leicester who had set up a maypole in defiance of the town's godly ministers; then in January 1605 he joined other leading justices to sign a petition to Viscount Cranborne on behalf of puritan clergy who had been deprived of their livings. He was also a prominent member of a literary circle gathered under the patronage of Sir Henry Goodyer and the fifth earl of Huntingdon. Copies of his poems survive in a commonplace book which belonged to his family and also included works by other members of the network, notably Francis and John Beaumont, John Donne, and Thomas Pestell. Skipwith's verses dwelt on the themes of beauty, romantic love, and the author's obligations to his patron. The lines he composed for the earl's entertainment at Ashby, on the occasion of a visit from his mother-in-law, Alice, countess of Derby, in 1607, included a mock &#145;chancery bill&#146; indicting the countess and other gentlewomen present for &#145;stealing the hearts of his Majesty's loving subjects&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 25707, fol. 134). In his <span class="italic">Worthies of England</span>, Thomas Fuller described Skipwith as<blockquote>a person of much valour, judgement, learning and wisdom, dexterous at the making fit and acute epigrams, poesies, mottoes and devices, but chiefly at impresses neither so apparent that every rustic might understand them, nor so obscure that they needed an Oedipus to interpret them. (Fuller, <span class="italic">Worthies</span>, 2.258)</blockquote>Sir William was married twice, first, to Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1594), daughter of Roger Cave of Stanford, Northamptonshire, with whom he had four sons and four daughters, and second, to Jane (<i>d</i>. 1630), daughter of John Roberts and widow of John Markham of Sidebrook. He died in London on 3 May 1610 and was buried at Prestwold church where his second wife erected a large monument to him. The verses inscribed on this, written by his friend John Beaumont, present him as the ideal of the contemporary gentleman: nobly born, hospitable, learned, and the true servant of his country  (Nichols, 3.359).<br>
