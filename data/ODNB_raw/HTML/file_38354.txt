<span class="headword">Hill <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Dietz; <em>other married name </em>Harriott]</span>,  Diana</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1844), <span class="occ">miniature painter</span>, of unknown parentage, was a pupil of the miniature painter Jeremiah Meyer. In 1775 she exhibited three miniatures at the Society of Artists and was presented with an award. At that time she lived in Angel Court, Great Windmill Street, London. Between 1777 and 1798 she exhibited miniatures, mostly of ladies, at the Royal Academy. On 1 February 1781, at St Mary's, St Marylebone, she married Haydock Hill, and in 1785 exhibited at the academy under her married name three works, of which two were flower pieces. On 21 September of that year the court of directors of the East India Company gave her permission to work in India as a portrait painter&#151;her mother-in-law, Elizabeth Hill, and T. C. Blanchenhagen, merchant, being her approved securities.<br>
<br>On Diana Hill's arrival in Calcutta in 1786 the miniaturist Ozias Humphry noted that she was &#145;a pretty widow with two children&#146; who possessed great merit, came with powerful recommendations, and whose brother-in-law John Hill was highly placed in the East India Company's Bengal civil service  (Foster, 39). The attention and patronage that she received caused Humphry much alarm: he would &#145;rather have had all the male painters in England landed in Bengal than a single woman&#146;  (ibid.). An early commission came from William Larkins, accountant-general at Calcutta, whose miniature (BL OIOC, reproduced Foster, pl. 8c) is signed &#145;Hill, 1786&#146;. Three of her portraits, painted in India and all signed and dated, were shown at the exhibition of miniatures held at South Kensington Museum in 1865. These included a portrait of Sarah Stackhouse (priv. coll.), wife of General Macleod, stylishly dressed in a tartan jacket and a headdress of high feathers and ribbons, of whom Mrs Hill painted another, whole-length miniature showing her seated in a landscape (priv. coll.; reproduced Foster, pl. 8d). Like the portrait of Larkins this shows, in the treatment of the hair and the large eyes, the influence of Meyer. The flattering images that her portraits&#151;usually oval, in watercolour on ivory&#151;display of their sitters indicate that Diana Hill's success was due not only to her social connections in India. On 7 November 1788 the painter Thomas Daniell wrote to Humphry, who had returned to England: &#145;Mrs. Hill is still making handsome faces, in the house you lived in last in Calcutta&#146;  (Foster, 40). In that month, however, Diana Hill gave up painting professionally when on 15 November she married Lieutenant Thomas George Harriott, of the 1st native infantry, then acting as brigade major, 3rd brigade. A miniature of her second husband (V&amp;A) is signed &#145;D.H. 1791&#146;, her marriage perhaps indicating the reason for the change in her signature. Her miniature of an unknown, dark-complexioned, perhaps Indian girl in a large, almost theatrical mob cab (V&amp;A; reproduced <span class="italic">British Portrait Miniatures</span>, pl. 77) is an intriguing portrait in which the effects of the artist's style, together with the sitter's Western dress, led to her being described as &#145;evidently half-caste&#146;  (Foskett, 528). In 1792 Sophia Dietz was given permission by the East India Company to join her sister in Bengal. After serving in Fatehgarh and Dinajpur, Harriott resigned in 1806 and returned to England, presumably with his wife and family, and resided at West Hall, Mortlake, Surrey, where he died in 1817, aged sixty-four. Diana Hill died at Twickenham, Middlesex, on 10 February 1844. Of her two sons with Thomas Harriott, William Henry Harriott (<i>d</i>. 1839) became a clerk in the War Office, a watercolour painter, and a friend of Cotman. Examples of his work are in the British Museum and in Bridport Art Gallery. With his wife, Sibella Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hunter, he had a daughter, Sibella Christina, who also became an artist.<br>
