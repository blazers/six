<span class="headword">Kennedy,  David</span>  (1825&#150;1886), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was born in Perth on 15 April 1825, the only son of a weaver, David Kennedy, who was also precentor of a United Secession church, and his wife, Catherine Taylor. At the age of sixteen he was apprenticed to a painter, but he was trained in music by his father and in 1845 became precentor of the South Kirk, Perth. During 1848 he worked at his trade in Edinburgh and London, and returned to Perth to set up in business. There, on 22 December 1848, he married Helen, daughter of Robert Henderson, a brewer, and following her death five years later, on 5 June 1855, Elizabeth, daughter of Charles Fraser, a farm servant. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40314/', "Marjory Kennedy-Fraser")</script>, the folk-song collector, was their second and his fifth child.<br>
<br>Kennedy later obtained a precentorship in Edinburgh, and in 1859 began a series of weekly concerts. Short concert tours in Scotland followed in 1860 and 1861, and in 1862 he made his first appearance in London, at the Hanover Square Rooms. Between December 1862 and May 1863 he gave a hundred concerts in the Egyptian Hall; and in 1864 and 1865 he was again in London, singing, and reading parts of Walter Scott's <span class="italic">Waverley</span>. In 1866&#150;8 he toured Canada and the eastern United States, with his eldest daughter, Helen, as his accompanist. In 1869 he went to San Francisco via Panama. While he was in San Francisco the first railway across the continent was opened, and he sang &#145;The Star-Spangled Banner&#146; at the inaugural ceremony.<br>
<br>After spending three years in Scotland, Kennedy and his family made a tour around the world (1872&#150;6), visiting Australia and New Zealand, the United States, Canada, and Newfoundland. From 1876 to 1879 he toured in the British Isles, and performed two seasons in London; in 1879 he visited South Africa, and in 1879&#150;80, India. On his way home he spent several months in Italy, where several of his children were studying; in 1881 one of his sons and two of his daughters died when the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre des Italiens, Nice, burnt down. In 1881&#150;2 Kennedy was again in Canada and the United States, in 1883&#150;4 in Australia and New Zealand. In March 1886 he appeared in London for the last time and then left for Canada, where he died at Stratford, Ontario, on 12 or 13 October 1886. He was buried in the Grange cemetery, Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Kennedy possessed a rich tenor voice and good dramatic powers, along with a fund of humour, sometimes &#145;pawky&#146;, sometimes broad. He followed the example of John Templeton in concentrating on Scottish songs, and his many tours were prompted largely by a desire to bring his native music to the many expatriate Scots throughout the world.<br>
