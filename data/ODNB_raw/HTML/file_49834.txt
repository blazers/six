<span class="headword">Jackson,  Daphne Frances</span>  (1936&#150;1991), <span class="occ">physicist and champion of women in science and engineering</span>, was born on 23 September 1936 at 34 Willesden Avenue, Peterborough, the only daughter and second child of Albert Henry Jackson (1893&#150;1951), an engineering fitter and turner, and Frances Ethel, formerly Elliott (1897&#150;1985), a dressmaker and designer until she married. She was educated at Peterborough county grammar school and Imperial College of Science and Technology; she graduated BSc (special physics) and became an associate of the Royal College of Science in 1958.<br>
<br>In 1958 Jackson was invited by L. R. B. Elton to join him as his first research student when he was appointed to the headship of the physics department at Battersea College of Advanced Technology. Two years later she was appointed to the academic staff as assistant lecturer (1960&#150;62), earning her (University of London) PhD in 1962. She was appointed lecturer (1962&#150;6) and with Elton helped to lay the foundations of an internationally respected group studying the theory of the structure of the atomic nucleus. Together they did important work on the theory of nuclear reactions and nuclear structure and Jackson soon began to publish individual contributions to the interpretation of nuclear reactions in which protons and other particles are knocked out of nuclei by a high-energy proton beam. Such studies yield important information about the constituents of nuclei. Her contributions were recognized by the award of a University of London DSc in 1970. In 1966 Battersea College was granted a royal charter and became the University of Surrey. Jackson was made reader in nuclear physics and leader of the nuclear physics group, which given this lead grew into the largest and most strongly supported such group in the UK, while the University of Surrey advanced into one of the UK's major research-led universities.<br>
<br>In 1971 Jackson was appointed professor and head of the physics department, the first woman to hold either post in the UK; she retained both until her death. It was a source of great frustration to her that she was the UK's only woman professor of physics for the first fifteen years of her appointment. Jackson proved a worthy successor to Elton. Her leadership qualities and wide perspective were recognized when the university appointed her dean, first of the faculty of mathematical and physical science during 1977&#150;80, and thereafter of the faculty of science during 1984&#150;8.<br>
<br>From about 1978 onwards Jackson's physics interests began to move away from fundamental questions and towards applications of nuclear physics, especially in medicine. She played an important role in strengthening these areas in physics at Surrey as well as serving on various relevant national committees. The department's two MSc courses in medical physics and in radiation and environmental protection, which came to prominence during her headship, soon attracted students from all over the world, providing an important source of trained personnel for hospital physics departments and industry, especially the nuclear industry.<br>
<br>The breadth of Jackson's interests is indicated by her publications&#151;some eighty articles on nuclear physics (as well as four books and contributions to others), fifty-five articles on medical physics and its applications, and almost as many (forty-six) on issues of science and society. In 1965 she became the Institute of Physics's youngest fellow and later its vice-president. She was also fellow of the American Physical Society and the Institution of Electrical Engineers, a senior member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers (of which she was a member of council), and a liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Engineers. Various public bodies on which she served included the board of the Meteorological Office Agency, the Schools Examinations and Assessment Council, the Advisory Council on Research and Development for Fuel and Power for the Department of Energy, the BBC science consultative group, various boards of the Science and Engineering Research Council, the metrology and standards requirements board of the Department of Trade and Industry, the West Surrey and North East Hampshire District Health Authority, committees of several regional health authorities, the National Radiological Protection Board and the civil service commission final selection board. At various times she held visiting appointments in nuclear physics at the universities of Washington, Maryland, Louvain, and Lund, as well as at the Institute for Cancer Research of the Royal Marsden Hospital. She was also active in many roles within the Women's Engineering Society, most notably as its president.<br>
<br>In parallel with her interests in physics, Jackson found herself becoming increasingly active in &#145;encouraging women in science and engineering&#146;, which was listed as a recreation in her entry in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> of 1991. This recreation had outstanding consequences, some with an importance equal to or exceeding that of her contributions to nuclear physics. Using her presidency of the Women's Engineering Society in 1983&#150;5 as a springboard, she was instrumental in helping establish the national WISE (Women in Science and Engineering) initiative to attract schoolgirls into science and engineering. In the same period she conceived and launched the Women Returners' Fellowship scheme for women who had had to give up careers in science or engineering because of family commitments. These fellowships made it possible for such women to make an effective return to high-level technological or scientific careers, something many people had thought impossible. Her genius was to identify a genuine need in society, to plan an effective way of meeting this need, and to carry out that plan, raising the substantial funds needed and proving her many sceptics wrong in the process. Official recognition of these and related efforts came when she was appointed OBE in 1987. She was also awarded honorary degrees by the Open University and the universities of Exeter and Loughborough. Jackson's initiatives continued to flourish after her death, an effective testament to her vision and determination.<br>
<br>It was particularly poignant that, at a time when her professional interest was focused so much on the diagnosis and treatment of cancer using nuclear physics and other techniques, Daphne Jackson was herself diagnosed as having the disease. Throughout a long struggle with cancer she continued to work and make contributions both to science and society at university, national, and international levels. Her dedication to the Women Returners' scheme was particularly evident at this time. She died at her home in St Omer Road, Guildford, on 8 February 1991, having been involved only hours before in counselling one of her PhD students, and was cremated at Guildford six days later. Her memory has been perpetuated through her former research students, who hold positions as scientists all over the world, and through the Daphne Jackson Memorial Fellowships Trust which administers the Returners' Fellowship scheme she did so much to create.<br>
