<span class="headword">Finden,  William</span>  (1787&#150;1852), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was born on 9 April 1787, the fifth son in the family of seven sons and three daughters of James Finden and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Perkins, who had married at St Pancras Church, London, on 16 January 1773. His younger brother, <a name="cosubject_9448"></a><span class="headword">Edward Francis Finden</span>  (1791&#150;1857), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was born on 30 April 1791. Both brothers were apprenticed to the engraver James Mitan, Edward joining his brother under that master about 1806; William Finden styled much of his early work on that of James Heath, whose atelier later served as a model for that established by the Findens. They were first employed on illustrating works published by John Sharpe and W. Suttaby among others, including (after paintings by Robert Smirke) Mary Smirke's translation of <span class="italic">Don Quixote de la Mancha</span> (1818). William Finden's first important commission was to engrave fifteen plates for W. Y. Ottley's <span class="italic">Engravings of the &hellip; Marquis of Stafford's &hellip; Pictures</span> (1818), of which <span class="italic">Rent Day Feast</span> after David Teniers earned him a gold medal from the Society of Arts in 1813. On 8 September 1812 he married at St Pancras Church Anne Abercrombie, with whom he had five sons: William Henry (<i>bap</i>. 27 June 1813), William Edward (<i>bap</i>. 4 June 1823), George Frederick (<i>bap</i>. 17 Oct 1827), Edward Francis (<i>bap</i>. 1 March 1830), and Harry? (<i>bap</i>. 2 Sept 1837). They had five daughters: Louisa Walker (<i>bap</i>. 26 June 1822), Emma (<i>bap</i>. 29 Sept 1825), Ann Frances (<i>bap</i>. 27 June 1832), Mary (<i>bap</i>. 27 Aug 1834), and Sophia Ann. In 1810 Edward Finden&#151;then living at John Street, Fitzroy Square&#151;was awarded the small silver palette for an outline drawing of <span class="italic">The Laoc&ouml;on</span> by the Society of Arts. His early works include the title-page to volume 2 of an edition of Milton's <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span> published by J. Sharpe in 1817, and one plate, dated 1 July 1817, in Ottley's <span class="italic">Engravings of the &hellip; Marquis of Stafford's &hellip; Pictures</span> (1818). He contributed many illustrations to the annuals, books of beauty, and other sentimental works in vogue at that time.<br>
<br>The large number of book illustrations which bear the names of either William or Edward Finden is due, for the most part, to the industry of the atelier they set up at 18 and 19 Southampton Place, Euston Square, where they took on pupils who included S. Hollyer, T. Philibrowne, G. Price, S. Rawle, S. Sangster, and J. H. P. Stubbs, and assistants including J. B. Allen, J. W. Archer, F. Bacon, C. Rolls, and Lumb Stocks. Robert Staines was both pupil and assistant. While managing a large number of commissions, the two brothers supervised the work of the studio and concentrated on adding the final touches to the steel plates to produce the elaborate finish and precision for which their work had become known. As a result of this studio production commentators have sometimes described their work as cold and mechanical in character. Plates by William Finden are lettered below W. Finden, Willm Finden, and William Finden, and those by Edward, E. Finden, Edwd Finden, and Edward Finden; some plates which appear in their works are lettered below Finden. A founder member of the Associated Engravers' Society&#151;formed at the house of John Pye in July 1826 in order to foster &#145;direct intercourse between Engravers, and Patrons of the fine arts&#146;&#151;William Finden had earlier contributed to the society's project to engrave in line from paintings in the recently founded National Gallery  (Fox, 11). His engraving of <span class="italic">The Village Festival</span> (1831) after Sir David Wilkie was included in the first part of <span class="italic">Engravings from Pictures in the National Gallery</span> (1831). Engraved on copper, the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> and <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> both later described this as his best work, and as &#145;lively [and] full of character&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 2 Oct 1852, 1070).<br>
<br>Well into their thirties, William and Edward Finden began to produce the great series of steel engravings for which they are chiefly known. Basil Hunnisett notes that &#145;it is difficult to ascertain exactly the amount of work William put into the plates carrying his name, although he was reckoned to be the better engraver of the two brothers&#146;  (Hunnisett, 34). While continuing to provide single plates for various annuals&#151;including <span class="italic">The Keepsake</span>, <span class="italic">The Bijou</span>, and <span class="italic">The Anniversary</span>&#151;their portrait, landscape, and topographical engravings and vignettes provided illustrations to the lives and works of the major poets of the day, including Sir Walter Scott, Lord Byron, Thomas Moore, and Samuel Rogers, and, in the previous century, those of Oliver Goldsmith and Samuel Johnson. Their landscape engravings were included in popular series of landscape views which included the British coastline, ports, and harbours, Scotland, Wales, India, Italy, Syria, and America. For these substantial commissions from publishers they worked after drawings by well-known artists including J. M. W. Turner, David Roberts, Clarkson Stanfield, Thomas Stothard, and Samuel Prout.<br>
<br>Of all these commissions, it was William and Edward Finden's illustrations to Byron that substantially enhanced the status of their work. Following his death in Greece in 1824, their engravings sensitively conveyed to a wide contemporary audience images of Byron's life and work. Initially engaged by Byron's publisher, John Murray, to engrave a portrait of Byron at the age of nineteen by the Scottish painter George Sanders, in J. C. Hobhouse's possession, as the frontispiece to the first edition of Thomas Moore's <span class="italic">Life of Byron</span> (1830), William Finden went on to work for Murray on a popular edition of Moore's <span class="italic">Life and Works of Byron</span> which was first published in monthly parts. At the same time he conceived his own project to publish with Murray a series of landscape illustrations to Byron. Initially he gained the support of Byron's loyal friend J. C. Hobhouse, who agreed to write a text to accompany the illustrations and provided Finden with a list of subjects for illustration. Finden lost no time in commissioning drawings from Turner and other artists, but then ran into difficulties with Hobhouse, whose protective feelings towards his friend's reputation prevented him from ever publishing his recollections of Byron. Having made a heavy financial commitment towards this, his first publishing venture, and having also secured investment from Murray, Finden pressed on and began negotiations with the publisher Charles Tilt. <span class="italic">Finden's Landscape Illustrations to the Life and Works of Byron</span> finally appeared in fourteen monthly parts, with both Murray's and Tilt's names on the paper wrappers, from January 1832. Each part contained five plates; the quarto edition cost 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>., and the royal quarto with plates on india paper was issued at 7<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. per part.<br>
<br>Both the <span class="italic">Illustrations</span> and Moore's <span class="italic">Life and Works</span> created a great sensation, and led to further projects to engrave the life and works of other poets, and other works of a popular kind such as <span class="italic">Finden's Gallery of the Graces</span> (1832&#150;4) after works by Sir Edwin Landseer and A. E. Chalon; <span class="italic">Finden's Byron Beauties</span> (1834); <span class="italic">Finden's Portraits of the Female Aristocracy of the Court of Queen Victoria</span> (1838&#150;9), after portraits by Chalon, Hayter, and others; and <span class="italic">Finden's Tableaux of National Character, Beauty, and Costume</span>, edited by Mrs A. [Priscilla Maden] Watts.<br>
<br>The Findens' relationship with Turner continued in the commission offered by the Findens and John Murray for the series <span class="italic">Landscape Illustrations to the Bible</span>, first issued in parts and subsequently compiled and published as a set of two volumes in 1836 under the title <span class="italic">The biblical keepsake, or, Landscape illustrations of the most remarkable places mentioned in the holy scriptures</span>. This also included engravings after A. W. Callcott, Harding, and Stanfield. Of the hundred engravings, the twenty-six by Turner included fourteen after sketches &#145;done on the spot&#146; by Sir Charles Barry; of these six were of Jerusalem.<br>
<br>The large profits from these highly successful works were dissipated, however, in the brothers' most ambitious production, the folio-size <span class="italic">Royal Gallery of British Art</span> (1838&#150;40). The beautifully executed and handsomely produced plates, which included <span class="italic">Interior of a Highlander's House</span> after Sir Edwin Landseer by William Finden and <span class="italic">Returning from Market</span> after A. W. Callcott by Edward Finden, were by some of the finest engravers of the period&#151;including John Pye, G. T. Doo, Edward Goodall, and J. T. Willmore after works by the foremost painters, including Constable, Wilkie, Eastlake, Mulready, Etty, George Jones, and Francis Danby. The engravers selected were, according to the preface, those &#145;best suited to translate the characteristics of the painter&#146;, and many of the painters &#145;commented [on] and approved the engravings&#146;. The work did not, however, sell. Despite its lack of financial success, the work remains of lasting importance in publishing &#145;on a scale and style commensurate with their importance &hellip; calculated to present a correct view of the progress of Painting and Engraving in England&#146;  (<span class="italic">Royal Gallery</span>, preface). As such, it forms a record of contemporary taste in British art, and the list of facsimile signatures of subscribers published &#145;in its complete form&#146; by J. Hogarth in 1851 is a roll-call of those who then supported British art.<br>
<br>Following their earlier successes with illustrations from Byron, an edition of the poet's <span class="italic">Childe Harold's Pilgrimage</span> (1842) included twenty-nine vignettes by Edward and a frontispiece engraving by William Finden of Thomas Phillips's portrait of Byron in Albanian dress after the reduced-size copy belonging to John Murray. Twenty plates by Edward Finden illustrated the <span class="italic">Beauties of Moore</span> (1846); twenty-two had earlier been included in <span class="italic">Landscape Illustrations of the Waverley Novels</span> (1830&#150;31). Though the brothers devoted most of their lives to book illustration, they also engraved some large single plates, including William Finden's portrait of George IV after Sir Thomas Lawrence, for which he received 1500 guineas, according to his obituary &#145;the highest sum ever paid for an engraving after a portrait&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 2 Oct 1852, 1070). In later years, and probably to relieve the brothers' financial difficulties, he engraved <span class="italic">&#145;The Naughty Boy&#146;</span> in 1843, and <span class="italic">The Girl with the Fish</span> in 1844, both after Sir Edwin Landseer, and the following year <span class="italic">The Highlander's Return</span> after Sir David Wilkie. <span class="italic">The Crucifixion</span> engraved after the painting by William Hilton for the Art Union was his last plate, for which he received &pound;1470. Edward Finden's single plates included <span class="italic">The Harvest Waggon</span> after Gainsborough.<br>
<br>William Finden was president of the Artists' Annuity Fund, of which he was a founder member in 1810, from 1834 to 1836. In 1845 he was elected to the Council of the Institute of Fine Arts, and in the week before his death he was named as a signatory of a petition to Queen Victoria for the recognition of the claims of engravers to full honours at the Royal Academy. Returning from a meeting of engravers, he caught cold, and together with the pressures of work, this led to a series of heart attacks. Late of Upper Cheyne Row, Chelsea, he died, a widower, at his home, 49 Camden Street, Camden Town, London, on 20 September 1852, and was buried in Highgate cemetery. He was described in his obituary as &#145;a man of quiet, gentlemanly demeanour, in every way an ornament to his profession&#146;  (<span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, 14, 1852, 350). Though it has been suggested that Adam Edward Findon (1824&#150;1846) may have been a son of William Finden  (Hunnisett, 35), he was baptized on 15 August 1824 at St Sepulchre's Church, London, the son of Henry Findon and his wife, Sarah. Edward Finden died after a long illness in St John's Wood, London, on 9 February 1857. He never married.<br>
