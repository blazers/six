<span class="headword">Fitzgibbon,  Edward</span>  (1803&#150;1857), <span class="occ">writer on angling</span>, was born at Limerick in August 1803, the son of a land agent. From boyhood, when he fished in the trout streams near his home, he was devotedly attached to fishing. His education was interrupted when he was fourteen years old by his father's death, and he moved to London. At sixteen he was articled to a surgeon in the city, but he loathed the profession and quit two years later. He became a classical tutor in various parts of England for three years, finding time everywhere to practise his favourite sport. <i>En route</i> for Greece he visited Marseilles, where he remained six years, teaching English. He became involved in politics, and his study of French language and literature made him a welcome guest in all literary and polite circles. Having taken some part in the revolution of 1830, he returned to Britain and gained a position with the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, working as a parliamentary reporter in the gallery of the House of Commons. He was also a theatre critic of considerable acumen, and wrote for <span class="italic">The Observer</span>.<br>
<br>Fitzgibbon's real fame as a writer, however, lay in piscatorial matters, where his books and essays helped to popularize angling. For many years he wrote on the sport in <span class="italic">Bell's Life in London</span> under the pseudonym Ephemera, and he produced several books on the subject and contributed widely to country sports journals. His <span class="italic">Handbook of Angling</span> (1847) reached a third edition in 1853; he regarded <span class="italic">The Book of the Salmon</span> (1850), which he compiled with Andrew Young of Invershin, as the acme of his teachings on fishing. Writing elegantly with force and humour, he had the ability to impart knowledge in a way that could be readily understood and appreciated. He was an expert in practice as well as theory and claimed to have once killed fifty-two salmon and grilse on the Shin River in fifty-five hours of fishing, a remarkable feat considering the standard of equipment available at that time.<br>
<br>Fitzgibbon became an alcoholic. The phenomenon of his bouts of heavy drinking, after periods of abstemiousness and even refined living, interested doctors, and he often spoke of writing an account of his experiences of intoxication. But he had become a wreck some years before his death from haematemesis in London on 19 November 1857. A Roman Catholic priest visited him on his deathbed. He was married but had no children and was buried in Highgate cemetery.<br>
