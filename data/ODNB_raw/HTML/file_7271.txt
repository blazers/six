<span class="headword">Davies <span class="st"> [Dai]</span>,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1593), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and martyr</span>, was born at Croes-yn-eirias in the parish of Llandrillo-yn-Rhos, Denbighshire, son of William Dai and grandson of Dafydd (Dai) Nantglyn, the most distinguished harpist of his day. His mother (or stepmother) was Katherine Evans, wife of &#145;William Day o'r Groes&#146;; she was listed as a recusant in Llandrillo-yn-rhos in 1587&#150;8. His father was a protestant, however. William Davies, possibly he who matriculated at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, in 1575 and graduated in 1578, was admitted to the English College, Douai (at Rheims), in 1582, ordained in 1585, and in the same year arrived as a missionary in north Wales, on home ground. His centre of activity was probably Plas Penrhyn, the home of Robert Pugh. Both he and Robert Pugh were in 1587 of the company of recusants obliged to flee overnight from the cave at Rhiwledin, near Penrhyn, where they had established themselves with a printing press; the one book incompletely produced on this press (the first known book to be printed in Wales) was the anonymous <span class="italic">Y drych Cristianogawl</span> (&#145;The Christian mirror&#146;).<br>
<br>In 1592, again in the company of Robert Pugh, in Holyhead, while arranging the passage of four Welsh seminary students to Valladolid, Davies was arrested (Pugh escaped). He was imprisoned in Beaumaris Castle, with the four students. Condemned at his first trial, he was removed to Ludlow, to Bewdley, and to other prisons, but, refusing to recant, was brought back to Beaumaris and tried again. On 27 July 1593 he was hanged, drawn, and quartered in Beaumaris Castle. During his time at Beaumaris he became the focus of fervent local support; executioners, and even the material for the execution, had to be brought from afar. His one surviving letter describes his first trial; there are three accounts of his martyrdom. He was declared venerable by Pope Leo XIII in 1886, and beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1987. A single poem by him survives, in Welsh: a meditation on Lent, it echoes poems of Richard Gwyn.<br>
