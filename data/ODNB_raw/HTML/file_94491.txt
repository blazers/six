<span class="headword">Emery, Sir  Peter Frank Hannibal</span>  (1926&#150;2004), <span class="occ">politician and businessman</span>, was born at 100 Greencroft Gardens, Hampstead, London, on 27 February 1926, the son of Frank George Emery, a commercial traveller for a ladies' costumier, and later a small-scale clothing manufacturer, and his wife, Phyllis Marjorie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Thomas. He owed one of his middle names to his great-great-grandfather Captain Hannibal, whose grain-carrying schooners sailed between Plymouth and Australia. He was educated at Scotch Plains, New Jersey, before returning to Britain in 1944 to serve as an RAF pilot. After the war he won a scholarship to Oriel College, Oxford, where he was awarded a fourth-class degree in philosophy, politics, and economics in 1950. But his lasting contribution at university (and arguably during his whole political career) came earlier the same year when, while serving on the committee of the Federation of University Conservative Associations, he co-founded (with Bruce Griffiths) the Bow Group, a successful Conservative effort to counter the intellectualism of the Fabian Society. In the words of Geoffrey Howe, one of its early members, the Bow Group sought &#145;to make the Tory Party fit for <span class="italic">Observer</span> and <span class="italic">Guardian</span> readers to live in&#146;  (Howe, 25). Emery and Griffiths tossed for the chairmanship, and the former lost, taking on the role of secretary, which included drafting the Bow Group's constitution.<br>
<br>Emery had begun his political career in local government in 1949 when he was elected as a councillor in Hornsey. After leaving Oxford he combined political activity with working as a salesman for the family firm. In October 1959 he entered parliament as MP for Reading, having defeated the leading Labour left-winger, Ian Mikardo, who was on the executive of the Association of Supervisory Staffs, Executives and Technicians, of which Emery was a rank-and-file member. Much of Emery's motivation for being a trade union member (and indeed for the formation of the Bow Group) derived from the fact that he wanted to broaden Conservatism's appeal to the working class. Defeat followed at the 1966 election, but he was soon returned to parliament at the Honiton by-election a year later, serving in that constituency until 1997. His support for Michael Heseltine in the Conservative leadership contest of November 1990 led to an unsuccessful attempt to deselect him in 1990, but he completed four decades in parliament as the Conservative MP for Devon East (following boundary changes) from 1997 to 2001. He was married twice. On 3 July 1954 he married Elizabeth Nicholson, the 23-year-old daughter of Frank Philip Nicholson, stockbroker; they had a son and a daughter. Following their divorce, on 15 December 1972 Emery married Elizabeth Monnington, a 31-year-old personnel manager, and daughter of Gilbert John Richard Monnington, farmer; they also had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>In parliament Emery earned a reputation from his colleagues as &#145;an amiable blunderbuss&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 17 Dec 2004). Such an impression must have gained currency early on when he was drafted onto the Scottish grand committee to counter Labour's inbuilt majority. The whips expected Emery's loyal silence. Instead he spoke for ninety minutes in full highland dress. He was hastily dropped. Years later, in 1993, Emery's scheme to confine Sunday trading to newsagents and petrol stations until lunchtime was met with ridicule, and he withdrew his ill-considered amendment amid laughter.<br>
<br>Emery's ministerial career never really took flight. From 1960 to 1963 he served as parliamentary private secretary in the Foreign Office, first under David Ormsby-Gore and then, from 1961, under Joseph Godber, whom he followed to the War Department and then the Ministry of Labour in 1963&#150;4. He became joint honorary secretary of the Conservative back-bench 1922 committee in 1964, and was finally rewarded with a front-bench post a year later when Edward Heath, whom Emery had supported in the Conservative leadership contest, made him part of the Treasury team. But Heath did not reward Emery with a post in government until 1972, when he appointed him parliamentary under-secretary at the Department of Trade and Industry. In the dying days of the Heath government Emery served briefly under Lord Carrington, as parliamentary under-secretary at the newly created Department of Energy. In opposition Margaret Thatcher failed to include Emery on her front-bench team. With the Conservatives back in government after 1979 Emery devoted his energies to serving on back-bench committees (most notably as chairman of the procedure committee from 1983 to 1997) and to his considerable business interests, the latter not without controversy. In 1980 he was sharply criticized by the public accounts committee for &#145;gross profiteering&#146; on a government contract entered into by Shenley Trust Services (formerly Emery and Emery, of which he was chairman) to operate the underwater training centre on a loch near Fort William. In 1983 he attracted further controversy when he wrote an article for <span class="italic">The Times</span> praising the puppet apartheid regime in Bophuthatswana, without first declaring that he had accepted an indirect payment from the South African government. Such controversies did not prevent Thatcher from recommending Emery for a knighthood in 1982, and John Major (to whom Emery was conspicuously loyal over the <span class="roman">Maastricht bill</span>) selecting him to join the privy council in 1993. Much of Emery's personal fortune was made while chairman of the Winglaw Property Group (1984&#150;2000). He also served on the boards of Property Growth Insurance (1969&#150;72) and Phillips Petroleum UK (1964&#150;72).<br>
<br>Towards the end of his parliamentary career Emery campaigned on behalf of his fellow asthma suffers. In 2001, in his capacity as chairman of the National Asthma Campaign, he bravely attacked his own side for their failure to support the Labour government's bill to ban tobacco advertising. Before his retirement from the House of Commons in 2001 he also served as the treasurer of the 1922 committee. Throughout his life he was an enthusiastic bridge player, and for many years he captained the House of Commons bridge team. He died of leukaemia on 9 December 2004 at Charing Cross Hospital, Fulham, London, and was survived by his wife, Elizabeth, and his four children.<br>
