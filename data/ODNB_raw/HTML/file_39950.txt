<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Williams,  (George) Emlyn</span>  (1905&#150;1987), <span class="occ">actor and playwright</span>, was born on 26 November 1905 at Pen-y-Ffordd, Mostyn, Flintshire, the eldest of the three surviving sons (two older children, a boy and a girl, died in infancy) of Richard Williams, a former navy stoker become greengrocer, of Ffynnongroyw, Flintshire, and his wife, Mary, a former maidservant, daughter of Job Williams, collier, of Treuddyn, Mold. He was educated at Holywell county school and at St Julien, Switzerland, before winning an open scholarship to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1923. At Holywell county school he had met Miss Sarah Cooke, the senior mistress, on whose character and personality he drew for much of Miss Moffett in <span class="italic">The Corn is Green</span>. She encouraged him, fostered his gift for languages, paid for his stay in Switzerland, entered him for the Oxford scholarship, gave him much financial support, and remained a lifelong friend. At Oxford he did little work, spending his time acting with the Oxford University Dramatic Society and writing plays. In 1926 he suffered a nervous breakdown before his final examinations, mainly due to an emotional friendship with a fellow undergraduate (his autobiography is frank about his bisexuality). He sat his finals in 1927, when he was already a professional actor, and took a second class in modern languages. Williams was stage-struck, captivated by a glamorous popular theatre in which, through hard work and professional commitment, he became a dominant figure. Though he acquired great sophistication he remained, essentially, the daringly optimistic, emotional, and single-minded romantic who had worked his way up from humble beginnings.<br>
<br>When he was an undergraduate Williams's one-act play, <span class="italic">Vigil</span> (1925), and a full-length drama, <span class="italic">Full Moon</span> (1927), were performed at the Playhouse theatre, Oxford. In London, after impressing with <span class="italic">Glamour</span> (1928) and <span class="italic">A Murder has Been Arranged</span> (1930), he had his first commercial success with <span class="italic">The Late Christopher Bean</span> (1933), an adaptation of Sidney Howard's English version of Fauchois's <span class="italic">Prenez garde &agrave; la peinture</span>. <span class="italic">Night Must Fall</span> (1935) ran for more than 400 performances; <span class="italic">The Corn is Green</span> (1938) was very popular in both London and New York. His numerous plays include <span class="italic">The Druid's Rest</span> (1944), a Welsh comedy in which the young Richard Burton made his d&eacute;but, <span class="italic">The Wind of Heaven</span> (1945), and <span class="italic">Someone Waiting</span> (1953). He wrote features for radio and one play, <span class="italic">Pepper and Sand</span> (1947), and two plays for television, <span class="italic">A Blue Movie</span> (1968) being the better known. His film scripts include <span class="italic">The Citadel</span> (1938), in collaboration, and <span class="italic">The Last Days of Dolwyn</span> (1949).<br>
<br>Williams's professional acting career began in 1927, at the Savoy, with a small part in <span class="italic">And So to Bed</span> by J. B. Fagan. His first success was as Angelo in Edgar Wallace's <span class="italic">On the Spot</span> (1930). In a long West End career he often starred in his own plays: he was a hit as Dan in <span class="italic">Night Must Fall</span> and an even greater one as Morgan Evans in <span class="italic">The Corn is Green</span>. In 1937 he appeared in Shakespeare at the Old Vic. He was Sir Robert Morton in Terence Rattigan's <span class="italic">The Winslow Boy</span> (1946). At Stratford in 1956 he played Angelo, Shylock, and Iago. In 1955 he was Hjalmar Ekdal in <span class="italic">The Wild Duck</span>; he was Sir Thomas More in the New York production of <span class="italic">A Man for All Seasons</span> (1962). His films included <span class="italic">The Last Days of Dolwyn</span> (1949), <span class="italic">Ivanhoe</span> (1952), <span class="italic">The Deep Blue Sea</span> (1955), <span class="italic">The L-Shaped Room</span> (1962), and <span class="italic">David Copperfield</span> (1969).<br>
<br>In 1951 Williams began his acclaimed readings from Charles Dickens, performing all over the world until he was well over eighty. From 1955 he performed a second one-man show, as Dylan Thomas in <span class="italic">A Boy Growing Up</span>. A third, based on the writings of H. H. Munro (Saki), began at the Apollo in 1977.<br>
<br>In 1961 Williams published the best-selling <span class="italic">George: an Early Autobiography</span>; its sequel, <span class="italic">Emlyn</span>, followed in 1973. His interest in the psychology of murderers led to <span class="italic">Beyond Belief</span> (1967), on the &#145;moors murderers&#146;, and to <span class="italic">Dr Crippen's Diary</span> (1987).<br>
<br>Given the high intellectual promise of Williams's beginnings his career is disappointing. He was a fine popular actor with lucid diction and a &#145;mesmeric&#146; stage presence. But, though he had a success in <span class="italic">The Wild Duck</span> and as a &#145;superbly dangerous&#146; Iago, his classical roles generally received mixed reviews. He was a determinedly commercial dramatist, with little interest in the avant-garde or in exploring social or political issues. His subjects were the psychology of murder and the supernatural, the conflict between innocence and experience, and the relationship between Wales and the outside world. But too often his desire for immediate effect led to melodrama, sentimentality, or theatrical cleverness. His portrayal of Welsh people tended to stereotype; claims that, in his Welsh plays, he perfected a rich poetic language reminiscent of J. M. Synge are overstated. However, with such plays as <span class="italic">A Murder has Been Arranged</span>, <span class="italic">Night Must Fall</span>, and <span class="italic">Someone Waiting</span> he contributed to the psychological thriller; his portrayal of ordinary people, particularly the rural Welsh, widened the narrow social range of West End &#145;drawing-room&#146; plays. Above all, his fine command of the dramatist's craft made him a highly successful entertainer. His was the age of the well-made, middlebrow drama, and the abrupt changes in British theatre during the 1950s, the advent of Samuel Beckett and John Osborne, effectively ended his writing for the stage. <span class="italic">Night Must Fall</span> and <span class="italic">The Corn is Green</span> are occasionally revived and remain staple fare for amateurs, but he is now better remembered for his brilliantly accurate impersonation of Dickens the public reader.<br>
<br>Williams's greatest literary achievement is <span class="italic">George</span>, a moving and detailed recreation of his childhood and adolescence in north Wales and an important study of a &#145;scholarship boy&#146; in the 1920s. <span class="italic">George</span> is one of the twentieth century's finest autobiographies.<br>
<br>Williams's family was poor and Welsh-speaking. He remained proud of his roots and retained his Welsh. His upbringing made him careful with money; he died a wealthy man. He was a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, received an honorary LLD at the University College of North Wales, Bangor, in 1949, and was appointed CBE in 1962. During his early career he lived with a fellow actor, Bill Cronin-Wilson, who died in 1934. In 1935 he married Mary Marjorie 
    (Molly; <i>d</i>. 1970)
  , formerly an actress, who was divorced from the barrister Cecil Caradoc (Jack) Carus-Wilson. They had two sons. Mary's father was Theodore Walter O'Shann, a chartered accountant. Emlyn Williams died on 25 September 1987, of cancer, at his London home, Flat 3, 123 Dovehouse Street.<br>
