<span class="headword">Elmy <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Morse]</span>,  Mary</span>  (1712&#150;1792), <span class="occ">actress</span>, perhaps began her career in a provincial company and may have acted at the Haymarket in 1732 and in early 1733. On 18 October 1733 a Miss Morse is listed as playing Charlotte in Thomas Southerne's <span class="italic">Oroonoko</span> at Drury Lane. She made two more appearances at Drury Lane as Miss Morse&#151;as Chloe in <span class="italic">Timon of Athens</span> on 23 November and as Lucy in Edward Phillips's <span class="italic">The Livery Rake</span> on 8 January 1734&#151;then some time between 14 and 31 January she became Mrs Elmy: probably Mrs William, perhaps Mrs James Elmy. Nothing more is known of her husband. The remainder of the 1730s suggests occasional appearances in London at Drury Lane, the Haymarket, and Covent Garden, where she made her d&eacute;but as Florinda in Aphra Behn's <span class="italic">The Rover</span> on 11 April 1737. She may well have had regular employment in small and unadvertised parts at these and other houses. Whatever the case, in 1738 she left London for Dublin, and made her first appearance there as Mrs Sullen in George Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Beaux' Stratagem</span> at the Aungier Street Theatre in October, when she was advertised as from Drury Lane. She made her d&eacute;but at the Smock Alley Theatre on 11 December 1739 and stayed in that company through to the season of 1743&#150;4.<br>
<br>In autumn 1744 Mrs Elmy returned to London and the roles of Phyllis in Richard Steele's <span class="italic">The Conscious Lovers</span> at the Haymarket with Theophilus Cibber's &#145;Academy&#146; and Lady Dainty in Colley Cibber's <span class="italic">The Double Gallant</span> at Drury Lane. In 1745&#150;6 she appeared again in Dublin and remained for the season at the Aungier Street Theatre and at Smock Alley, where she was part of the supporting company for Garrick's engagement. She then appeared as Lady Grace in Sir John Vanbrugh's <span class="italic">The Provoked Husband</span> at Drury Lane (3 January 1747) and stayed in Garrick's company until the end of the 1740s, appearing in a range of increasingly high-profile roles.<br>
<br>On 16 October 1750 Mrs Elmy was Belinda in Vanbrugh's <span class="italic">The Provoked Wife</span> at Covent Garden, and she remained with that company until her retirement in 1762. Her roles included Lady Touchwood in William Congreve's <span class="italic">The Double Dealer</span>, Lady Brute in <span class="italic">The Provoked Wife</span>, Regan in <span class="italic">King Lear</span>, and, throughout the 1750s, Gertrude in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>: she was greatly praised for her portrayal of Gertrude to Spranger Barry's Hamlet. The <span class="italic">European Magazine</span> lists her death on 1 April 1792 at the age of eighty at Knightsbridge, London.<br>
<br>Mary Elmy made a will on 12 October 1780 and added a codicil on 28 April 1789; it was proved on 19 April 1792. In the will she noted herself to be a widow. She left &pound;100 each to four cousins in Norwich and &pound;20 to another cousin in London. In addition four children of a cousin were each to receive &pound;10. One Anne Williams received a diamond ring, and the rest of her estate&#151;including &pound;1000 in stock&#151;was left to her cousin Sarah Smith, also of Norwich. The codicil left &pound;50 to Anne Crawford, Spranger Barry's widow.<br>
<br>Mary Elmy was never of the first rank of performer but became a solid and reliable company member, though she occasionally excelled in the right part. For example, in the 1753 season her Desdemona was greatly praised. Her fellow actress George Anne Bellamy considered her a &#145;good humorist and possessed of a great good sense, but by her want of powers was prevented from making a conspicuous figure upon the stage&#146;. <span class="italic">The Thespian Dictionary</span> (1802) adds that Elmy was &#145;respectable both in tragedy and comedy &hellip; [and] had a tolerable share of wit and good sense&#146;. Chetwood's <span class="italic">A General History of the Stage</span> (1749) was surprised that &#145;She seems to have more Spirits <i>off</i> the Stage, in a Chamber, than she has <i>in</i> the public Theatre&#146;, and in <span class="italic">The Actor</span> (1750) Hill saw her as &#145;an actress of great judgement, endowed with a sweet voice and a pleasing deportment&#146;  (<span class="italic">BDA</span>).<br>
