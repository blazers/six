<span class="headword">Holden,  Samuel</span>  (1674/5&#150;1740), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was baptized at Christ Church, Southwark, Surrey, in August 1675, the son of the merchant Joseph Holden, citizen and haberdasher of London (originally from the East Riding of Yorkshire), and his second wife, Priscilla Watt. His father died in 1683, when Samuel was only eight, but the boy inherited useful connections in the City. In 1692, at seventeen, he was apprenticed, in the Drapers' Company, to the great Baltic merchant, Nathaniel Gould, later treasurer of the Eastland Company, governor of the Russia Company, director and governor of the Bank of England, and director of the new East India Company, a major collaborator of Sir Gilbert Heathcote in the creative whig financial activity of 1694&#150;1710. Gould sent young Holden to Riga to learn his trade. At the conclusion of his apprenticeship, he continued in business in Russia, but had returned to London as an independent merchant by 1709, when on 1 March he was elected assistant (director) of the Russia Company, and on 4 April married, at St Michael, Wood Street, Jane (1679/80&#150;1766), daughter of John Whitehall (or Whitehaulgh), citizen of London. They raised one son, who died in 1736, and three daughters.<br>
<br>During his Riga years, Holden became friendly with Matthew Shiffner (<i>d</i>. 1756), with whom he later participated in major commercial undertakings. Shiffner, a native of Russia, had resided long enough in England to become naturalized on 8 October 1711. On his subsequent return to Russia, Shiffner married in 1720 Hedwig Agnata Bruiningk (1704&#150;1793) of Riga, later <i>gouvernante</i> to Anna, duchess of Courland, niece of Peter the Great, and future Russian empress (1730&#150;40). Such court connections must have appeared most useful to his allies trading to Russia, where firms with which Shiffner was connected&#151;particularly Shiffner and Wolff&#151;had enough influence to obtain valuable export privileges and army supply contracts.<br>
<br>In London, Holden was at various times active in the trades to Lisbon, Leghorn, Smyrna, the West Indies, and New England, but he played a major part in trade to Russia. He collaborated with John Gore in importing Russian iron, and with Shiffner and Wolff in cloth shipments to the Russian army and in hemp exports from Russia. Some of this hemp was sent directly to Leghorn, and olive oil returned to Russia. Peter the Great showed confidence by entrusting Holden with the care of Russian apprentices sent to England for training. The British government also entrusted him with the transportation of horses to Russia as gifts for the tsar, as well as with remittances to British diplomatic representatives there. In London, his growing standing was marked by his selection as assistant, consul, and ultimately (1728&#150;40) governor of the Russia Company, and by his long service during 1720&#150;40 on the court of directors of the Bank of England, of which he became deputy governor in 1727&#150;9 and then governor in 1729&#150;31. In 1737 he was also one of the City trustees for the loan of &pound;370,000 to the Holy Roman emperor, secured on the copper mines of Hungary. Holden, close to the Walpole administration, was regularly consulted by the Board of Trade on the negotiations leading to the British&#150;Russian commercial treaty of 1734, and in 1735 was elected member of parliament for East Looe, a Treasury-controlled borough. He was also named one of the directors of the Royal Hospital at Greenwich.<br>
<br>By the 1730s Samuel Holden was a leading figure among dissenters. In 1735 he was asked by the Massachusetts house of representatives to serve as their agent in London, but he declined the honour as inconsistent with his other commitments. Nevertheless, in 1732, when the dissenting communities were seriously excited by the possibility of obtaining the repeal of the <span class="roman">Test and Corporation Acts</span>, he agreed to serve as chairman of a committee set up that year by the deputies from the three principal dissenting confessions to work for repeal. His personal opinions were, however, expressed in his presidential address to a &#145;general assembly&#146; of dissenters on 29 November 1732. He warned his listeners that, with a parliamentary election in the offing, this was not a propitious time to bring the issue before parliament. Yet he made his own unqualified dissenting sympathies clear by referring in the speech to the &#145;bigotry&#146; and &#145;interest&#146; of those who opposed repeal. The printing of his address in the London press evoked a pamphlet reply (<span class="italic">A Letter to Samuel Holden</span>, 1732) from a pro-ministerial author more sympathetic to the established church. Holden's rejoinder (<span class="italic">An Answer to a Letter to Samuel Holden</span>, 1732) was his only known avowed publication. Several other pro-repeal pamphlets published about the same time were addressed to Holden, by implication recognized as the lay leader of dissent. One of these (<span class="italic">An inquiry into the Propriety of Applying to Parliament for the Repeal of the Corporation and Test-Acts</span>, 1732) referred to the divisions among the dissenters &#145;heightened by a secret management, under ministerial direction, by representing the most dismal consequences to some of them, at private conferences, which by these few were to be sent among the rest of the people&#146;. This can be interpreted as criticism both of Holden's closeness to the ministry, and of his style of leadership, but had little immediate effect. Holden kept his committee quiet during the excise crisis of 1733 and the election of 1734, but, when the repeal question was finally brought before the Commons in 1736, Walpole disappointed his dissenter friends by continuing inactive and neutral. Holden, obviously embarrassed, spoke for the repeal bill during that session, but, on its defeat, felt obliged to resign as chairman of the dissenting deputies' special committee.<br>
<br>Holden was particularly interested in the Congregational colonies in New England. His correspondents there included the prominent Boston clergyman Benjamin Colman, who, on a visit to London in the 1690s, had lodged with Holden's mother, Mrs Thomas Parkhurst. In the 1730s, Holden sent Colman books and cash worth nearly &pound;1000 sterling, for distribution to the deserving. At Holden's death Colman published in Boston a memorial sermon of tribute (1740), and in London a selection of Holden's letters to him on spiritual topics (1741). Samuel Mather, another eminent Massachusetts divine, dedicated to Holden his <span class="italic">An Apology for the Liberties of the Churches in New England</span> (1738).<br>
<br>At the time of his death, Samuel Holden resided in Roehampton House, Surrey, an impressive leased villa, and kept a counting house in Bishopsgate Street in the City. He also owned property in Lincoln's Inn Fields, as well as landholdings in Derbyshire, which secured his wife's dower rights. At his death on 12 June 1740, he left a personal estate of over &pound;80,000. Of this, &pound;60,000 was left to his wife and two surviving daughters, with the balance to be used for charitable purposes selected by his widow. Part of this benefaction went to Harvard College, and was used there for the construction of Holden Chapel. Holden was buried in St Bride's Church, Fleet Street on 20 August 1740. In 1744 Samuel Holden's daughter Mary became the second wife of John Jolliffe MP. In 1866 their great-grandson, W. G. H. Jolliffe, was created Baron Hylton.<br>
