<span class="headword">Raisin,  Catherine Alice</span>  (1855&#150;1945), <span class="occ">geologist and educationist</span>, was born at 13 Camden Terrace, Camden New Town, London, on 24 April 1855, the daughter of (Daniel) Francis Raisin, pannierman at the Inner Temple, and his wife, Sarah Catherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Woodgate. She was educated at North London Collegiate School and at University College, London, which she entered in 1873, although she also taught at her old school until 1875. She studied botany, taking the honours examinations as a private student, and also geology and mineralogy. When University of London degrees were opened to women in 1878, she concentrated on botany, geology (studying under T. G. Bonney), and zoology (under T. H. Huxley). After taking her BSc in 1884, with second-class honours in geology and third-class in zoology, she stayed on at University College as voluntary research assistant to Professor Bonney. In 1898 she was awarded a DSc, only the second woman geologist to receive this degree from the University of London. She was elected a fellow of University College in 1902.<br>
<br>After serving as demonstrator in botany at Bedford College for Women from 1886 to 1890, Raisin succeeded Grenville A. J. Cole as head of the geology department, becoming the first woman head of a geology department in a British university. From 1907 she was also Norton Sumner lecturer in geology; she held both posts until her retirement in 1920. From 1890 to 1907 she also headed the botany department, and, from 1898 to 1901, was vice-principal of the college.<br>
<br>The Geological Society of London awarded Raisin the Lyell fund in 1893, the first such honour given a woman. It was accepted for her by Professor Bonney, since women were not then allowed to attend meetings of the society. She became one of the first women fellows in 1919, when women were finally admitted.<br>
<br>Much of Raisin's work was in microscopic petrology and mineralogy, interests she had developed when training under Bonney. She was known as an excellent microscopist. Her first research, an examination of the metamorphic rocks of south Devon, was notable as one of the early attempts to map metamorphic facies. Other work included field and laboratory studies of rocks from the Ardennes and Switzerland, and the petrography of rock collections from the Himalayas and many parts of Africa. She published twenty-four scientific papers between 1887 and 1905. Her best-known work was her detailed investigation of the microscopic structure of minerals forming serpentine, published as a joint paper with Bonney in 1905 (<span class="italic">Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society</span>).<br>
<br>Remembered by colleagues as a strong, vigorous, and charming woman, Raisin was also a &#145;character&#146;, who ruled absolutely in her department and dealt summarily with opposition. An outstanding teacher, she paid close attention to the work of her assistants, and was always solicitous about her students; among them she was affectionately known as &#145;the Raisin&#146;, and (secretly) &#145;the Sultana&#146;. In committee she could be a formidable opponent. One of Britain's first professional women geologists and a noted pioneer among late nineteenth-century women educationists, Raisin took a keen interest in all aspects of women's advancement. In the late 1870s she founded and organized a discussion group for women, the Somerville Club, which, when it opened in 1880, had 1000 members. She served as its honorary secretary and then as chair. After retiring, Raisin gave much time to various women's groups and to societies for the promotion of women's interests. She was a member of the Geologists' Association for sixty-seven years, and latterly its most senior member. She died on 12 July 1945, unmarried, at Ash Priors Nursing Home, Pitville Circus, Cheltenham and was buried on 17 July.<br>
