<span class="headword">Callender, Sir  Geoffrey Arthur Romaine</span>  (1875&#150;1946), <span class="occ">naval historian and museum director</span>, was born at Didsbury, Manchester, on 25 November 1875, the elder son of Arthur William Callender, cotton mill owner, and his wife, Agnes Louisa, daughter of the Revd George Stephen Woodgate, vicar of Pembury, Kent. Educated in Oxford at St Edward's School and at Merton College, he was placed in the second class of the honours list in modern history in 1897. He was appointed in January 1905 to the new Royal Naval College, Osborne, where he embraced the study of naval history with characteristic enthusiasm. Finding no textbook suitable for naval cadets, he instantly set about producing his <span class="italic">Sea Kings of Britain</span> (3 vols., 1907&#150;11). He became head of the history and English department in January 1913, and thereafter the navy and its history were the guiding interests of his life.<br>
<br>In 1921 Callender moved to the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, as head of the history department there, but he did not remain long. Experience gleaned from the First World War showed that a study of history was essential at all levels of naval education: a chair of history was therefore established in London at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, where a staff college and a war college were also being formed. Callender was appointed first occupant in 1922 and it was there that he published his best-known work, <span class="italic">The Naval Side of British History</span> (1924). Meanwhile (1921&#150;4), the Society for Nautical Research was conducting its campaign to save HMS <i>Victory</i>. Callender was already that body's honorary secretary and treasurer&#151;a dual post which he held continuously from 1920 until his death&#151;and he was largely responsible for the successful outcome of the campaign.<br>
<br>Callender now embarked on his dearest project: the foundation of a museum which would assemble under one roof the priceless naval and maritime treasures of Britain. The co-operation of the Society for Nautical Research and beneficent sympathizers like Sir James Caird secured in 1928 the acquisition for the nation of the magnificent Macpherson collection of naval and nautical prints, to form, with the pictures and models already at the college, the nucleus of the new museum. The ideal site was Inigo Jones's Queen's House at Greenwich, then occupied by the Royal Hospital school; and on the latter's migrating to Holbrook, the last difficulty was overcome. The <span class="roman">National Maritime Museum Act</span> was passed in 1934 and Callender became, as of right, the first director. Into the immense task of restoring the Queen's House, preparing the galleries, assembling the exhibits, and arranging them he threw his whole energy, and the museum was opened by George VI on 27 April 1937. Callender was knighted in the following year and spent the rest of his life improving and adding to the collections. He died, suddenly, but fittingly, in the museum on 6 November 1946. He was unmarried. Callender was a man of exceptional personality, a born conversationalist, and a brilliant lecturer, respected and beloved by several generations of naval officers, and possessed of an encyclopaedic knowledge of nautical antiquities.<br>
