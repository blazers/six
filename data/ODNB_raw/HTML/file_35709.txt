<span class="headword">Reed, Sir  (Herbert) Stanley</span>  (1872&#150;1969), <span class="occ">newspaper editor and politician</span>, was born in the Ashley district of Bristol on 28 January 1872, the son of William Reed, a grocer of Fremantle Villa, Bristol, and his wife, Amelia Whitney. He was educated privately, became a journalist, and in 1897 joined the staff of the <span class="italic">Times of India</span> in Bombay, then under the editorship of Thomas Bennett. As a young bachelor Reed entered fully into the lively social life of Bombay at the turn of the century, enjoying sailing, riding, and hunting over the dry rice fields of the surrounding countryside; he was eventually to become an enthusiastic member of the Bombay light horse and to command that volunteer body with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. In 1901 he married Lilian (<i>d</i>. 1947), daughter of John Humphrey. They had no children. She fully shared his interest in India, where they spent much of their married life and made many friends.<br>
<br>From the time of his arrival in India, Reed was keen to travel and see as much of the country as possible, and in 1900 he broke new ground for his newspaper with an extensive tour of famine-affected areas. He sent reports of what he had seen in the countryside not only to his own newspaper but also to the <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span>, as its special correspondent. In his book <span class="italic">The India I Knew</span>, published in 1952, Reed described how he invaded the placid leader writing sanctum of Bennett with this revolutionary suggestion:<blockquote>I am doing little or nothing here. Yet the city is ravaged by plague. Poona is deserted. &hellip; The Black Death has swept over Sholapur, Surat and Ahmedabad. &hellip; The embers of the famine are slowly dying and we have nothing about these great happenings.</blockquote>That was the start of travels which ranged over the length and breadth of India. Reed accompanied George V and Queen Mary when, as prince and princess of Wales, they toured India in 1905. His dispatches were republished in book form in 1906, with a preface by Sir Walter Lawrence, who abandoned his intention of writing an official record of the royal visit when he found that Reed had virtually done the job for him. During these travels Reed acquired the profound knowledge and sympathetic understanding of the Indian people which were later to stamp his writing as an editor and his speeches as a British parliamentarian.<br>
<br>Reed was appointed editor of the <span class="italic">Times of India</span> in 1907, and under his control the newspaper became not only one of the two most influential journals in India (the other was <span class="italic">The Statesman</span>, based in Calcutta on the other side of the subcontinent), but in its general conduct and appearance able to challenge comparison with any English daily. Under the editorship of his predecessor, Lovat Fraser, the status of the <span class="italic">Times of India</span> had been raised from that of a respectable provincial newspaper into an Indian organ of opinion which Lord Curzon of Kedleston described as the leading paper of Asia. Reed saw that it lacked two things: a sensible selling price and a comprehensive foreign news service. He persuaded its proprietors to drop its selling price from 4<i>d</i>. to 1<i>d</i>. This led to a fourfold rise in circulation in three days, and Reed went on to play an influential role in the Imperial Press Conference in 1909, where the case for cheap telegraphic rates between the countries of the empire was pressed.<br>
<br>In the First World War, Reed was director of publicity to the government of India, and towards its end he was called upon to counsel on the functions and organization of the central publicity board, of which he became vice-president (1918). This was a belated attempt to improve the understanding of the people of India about a war to which they had been committed four years earlier by Lord Hardinge of Penshurst, then the viceroy. Reed had, in the columns of his newspaper, written very critically about the military disaster in Mesopotamia and was in consequence not universally popular at government headquarters in Simla, but he pressed through a number of reforms aimed at helping the press and some sections of the public to understand how and why the war was being fought. The isolation of the government of India from public opinion at that time, Reed wrote many years later, was almost inconceivable. In 1919 he was created KBE, having been knighted in 1916.<br>
<br>Reed retired from India in 1923, having founded the <span class="italic">Indian Year Book</span> in the previous year, but continued to write for his paper from London for many years. With Patrick Cadell he wrote <span class="italic">India: the New Phase</span> (1928), which presented a lucid summary of the Montagu&#150;Chelmsford reforms introduced by the <span class="roman">Government of India Act</span> of 1919. He quickly became involved in British politics and in 1929 unsuccessfully contested the Stourbridge constituency in Worcestershire as a conservative; but in 1938 he fought and won a by-election in the Aylesbury division of Buckinghamshire. The first suggestion that he should stand for parliament had come from the Labour Party secretary, Arthur Henderson, when they were both members of the British delegation to the League of Nations in 1924. Reed had certain natural affiliations with the Labour Party but he professed himself unable to swallow nationalization and the capital levy, and it was finally his old Indian guru, Sir Walter Lawrence, who persuaded him to enter the lists on the tory side. He contributed many useful speeches to the House of Commons on Indian questions and on a variety of other topics and, if his independence of mind did not always endear him to the whips, his well studied briefs ensured him an attentive audience. He and Alan Herbert jointly presented a private member's bill to amend the law of defamation; this ended in the appointment of a committee presided over by Lord Porter, which for a variety of reasons could not report until 1948. It was, however, on Indian subjects that Reed spoke most frequently, and his support for Indian independence after the war was tempered with regret that Britain had taken so long to complete a process which, he reminded the house, had begun in 1917. He retired from politics in 1950 and lived on in London until he died in Westminster Hospital on 17 January 1969.<br>
