<span class="headword">Hobsbaum,  Philip Dennis</span>  (1932&#150;2005), <span class="occ">poet and literary scholar</span>, was born on 29 June 1932 at 24 Underwood Street, Whitechapel, London, the son of Joseph Hobsbaum, telephone engineer, and his wife, Rachel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sapera. His parents were both first-generation eastern European Jewish immigrants. In 1939 his father's job took the family to Yorkshire. They settled in 1942 in Bradford, where Hobsbaum obtained a place at Belle Vue Grammar School. Ronald Bradshaw, a perceptive English teacher, recognized ability in the bullied, physically awkward pupil, and moved him from the C to the A stream, encouraging him to try for a Cambridge scholarship. During his schooldays Hobsbaum participated in theatricals at the local Civic Theatre (at one point he toyed with the idea of becoming a professional actor) and debated at the local Jewish society. Both helped form his clear diction and well-modulated readings of verse and prose. Following school he worked for two years as a Ministry of National Insurance clerk. Poor eyesight meant that he failed the national service physical test. During this period he wrote many poems, short stories, and plays, and attended lectures given by the eminent Shakespearian critic G. Wilson Knight and others.<br>
<br>In 1952 Hobsbaum gained an exhibition to Downing College, Cambridge, where his teachers included F. R. Leavis, whom he subsequently described as &#145;the greatest man I ever met &hellip; an amazing teacher&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>). At Cambridge he edited the student literary magazine <span class="italic">Delta</span> (1954&#150;6). As editor he displayed his acumen in recognizing talent, publishing early work by, among others, Ted Hughes and Peter Redgrove, and forming the foundations of what became important connections within the London literary establishment. Continuing to write poetry, he also created the first of many writing group meetings, at which poets read new work aloud and received criticism from their peers. He gained upper seconds in both parts of the English tripos, graduating in 1955.<br>
<br>On leaving Cambridge Hobsbaum moved to London, and became a licentiate of the Royal Academy of Music in 1956 and of the Guildhall School of Music in 1957. In London he worked in television and for a theatrical agent, and taught at various schools, including Tulse Hill comprehensive, where Ken Livingstone, subsequently mayor of London, was one of his students. Livingstone later said that if Hobsbaum hadn't left, in 1958, &#145;I would have probably stayed on for higher education&#146;  (<span class="italic">Independent on Sunday</span>, 28 Feb 1993). Meanwhile, at Brixton Synagogue on 7 August 1957, Hobsbaum had married Hannah Kelly, a nineteen-year-old dictaphone typist and poet; there were no children of the marriage. In their basement flat in Stockwell, south London, Hobsbaum convened a writing group known as the Group. Those attending included poets of the calibre of Martin Bell, George Macbeth, Peter Porter, Peter Redgrove, and Edward Lucie-Smith. Hobsbaum's own poetry also began to attract attention, being published in small magazines like <span class="italic">Extra Verse</span>, <span class="italic">Gemini</span>, the <span class="italic">Oxford and Cambridge Magazine</span>, <span class="italic">Universities' Poetry</span>, and elsewhere.<br>
<br>In 1959, supported by his wife, Hobsbaum enrolled at Sheffield University for a PhD, since the poet and critic William Empson, whom he greatly admired, taught there. Hobsbaum's essays for Empson had &#145;very wide margins, so he could scribble abuse&#146; on them&#151;a device Hobsbaum's subsequent students also found to be useful  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). Hobsbaum's relationship with Empson, his supervisor, was complex, intense, and at times hostile. His account was later published in his memoir, &#145;Empson as teacher: the Sheffield years&#146;, in <span class="italic">William Empson: the Critical Achievement</span> (ed. C. Norris and N. Mapp, 1993), and partially documented in the second volume of John Haffenden's biography of Empson. Empson nevertheless supported Hobsbaum's search for an academic position and in 1962 he was appointed lecturer at Queen's University, Belfast, where he taught for four years before moving to the University of Glasgow in 1966. The professor who appointed him to the Belfast English department was Peter Herbert Butter, known for his critical and editorial work on the Anglo-Scottish poet Edwin Muir. Hobsbaum moved to Glasgow University a year after Butter's appointment to the regius chair of English there. He spent the rest of his career at the Glasgow English department, where he formed the creative writing programme and moved progressively through the academic ranks, from lecturer to senior lecturer in 1972, from 1979 to 1985 as reader, and then to a personal chair until retirement in 1997.<br>
<br>Hobsbaum's PhD was eventually awarded in May 1968. Entitled &#145;Some reasons for the great variety of response to literature among modern literary critics&#146;, his dissertation subsequently appeared in various journal articles and as a monograph under the title <span class="italic">A Theory of Communication</span> (1970). Reflecting the influence of both Leavis and Empson, Hobsbaum argued that words depend on their context for meaning: &#145;One's approach to a poem must necessarily be governed by what is available to the reader&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Theory of Communication</span>, 58). During this period several volumes of Hobsbaum's poetry were published. His <span class="italic">Poems in the Place's Fault, and Other Poems</span> (1964), in the words of Heather Clark, &#145;emphasize Hobsbaum's feelings of marginalization in a class-obsessed culture that makes little room for a Jewish scholarship boy from Yorkshire&#146;  (Clark, 59); <span class="italic">Snapshots</span> appeared in 1965, a year later <span class="italic">Retreat and Other Poems</span>, and in 1969 <span class="italic">Coming Out Fighting</span>, and <span class="italic">Some Lovely Glorious Nothing: a Poem</span>. In 1972 <span class="italic">Women and Animals</span> was published. Peter Lawson observed that in such poems as &#145;Testimony&#146; and &#145;Watching and Waiting&#146;, and &#145;animal poems&#146; like &#145;The Sick Lion&#146;, &#145;together with his accomplished craft and ironic humour, Hobsbaum's quasi-Judaic faith redeems his poetic voice and saves it from disappearing into the silence of despair&#146;  (P. Lawson, <span class="italic">Passionate Renewal: Jewish Poetry in Britain since 1945, an Anthology</span>, 2001, 14). Hobsbaum's &#145;A Lesson in Love&#146; was included by Philip Larkin in his selection <span class="italic">The Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse</span> (1972).<br>
<br>Hobsbaum edited, with Edward Lucie-Smith, <span class="italic">A Group Anthology</span> (1963), a collection of poetry discussed at his writing workshops, and, as sole editor, an anthology, <span class="italic">Ten Elizabethan Poets</span> (1969), directed at sixth-formers. In his later years his publications focused on literary criticism and the clear exposition of the work of individual writers, although he continued to write poetry and dramatic sketches. <span class="italic">A Reader's Guide to Charles Dickens</span> appeared in 1972, <span class="italic">A Reader's Guide to D. H. Lawrence</span> in 1981, and <span class="italic">A Reader's Guide to Robert Lowell</span> in 1988. Hobsbaum wrote forewords to S. K. Hassan's <span class="italic">Philip Larkin and his Contemporaries: an Air of Authenticity</span> (1988) and Phil Moore's <span class="italic">Alasdair Gray: Critical Appreciations and a Bibliography</span> (2002). Gray attended Hobsbaum's Glasgow lectures and writer's workshops, as did Liz Lochhead and James Kelman, to name but a few of the significant creative talents encouraged by him. Gray's <span class="italic">Book of Prefaces</span> (2000) was dedicated to Hobsbaum, &#145;poet, critic, and servant of the servants of art&#146;. In addition to many articles and reviews Hobsbaum's critical work included <span class="italic">Tradition and Experiment in English Poetry</span> (1979), <span class="italic">Essentials of Literary Criticism</span> (1983), and <span class="italic">Metre Rhythm and Verse Form</span> (1996). His stated aim was &#145;to get things clear. In poetry this means being true to one's experience, whatever that experience may be. In criticism it means trying to get across to the reader a sense of the text as verbal entity&#146;  (Chapman and Jorgenson, 209). He was sceptical of the kind of critical theory fashionable in academic circles at the close of the twentieth century. He believed that &#145;you should master the basic works of English Literature&#146; rather than read criticism  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>).<br>
<br>Hobsbaum was perhaps most notable, to use the words of his <span class="italic">Times</span> obituarist, as a &#145;servant&#146; to the &#145;makers&#146; (the poets). The impact of his workshops in London, Belfast, Glasgow, and elsewhere was acknowledged by the Nobel prizewinner Seamus Heaney, who commented that Hobsbaum &#145;emanated energy, generosity, belief in the community, trust in the parochial, the inept, the unprinted&#146;  (Clark, 60). Others acknowledging their indebtedness to Hobsbaum during the Belfast years included such distinguished talents as Bernard MacLaverty, Derek Mahon, and Michael Longley. Hobsbaum's prominent role in fostering talent was reflected in the pages of Heather Clark's <span class="italic">The Ulster Renaissance: Poetry in Belfast, 1962&#150;1972</span> (2006).<br>
<br>Hobsbaum's first marriage ended in divorce in 1968, but in 1976 he married, as his second wife, Rosemary Singleton, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Phillips, a teacher. He thereby acquired two stepdaughters. In spite of suffering from increasingly severe diabetes, in his last years he travelled, especially enjoying a visit to the Galapagos Islands. He also loved Handel, Bach, and the <span class="italic">EastEnders</span> soap opera. Bearded and heavy of stature, he was capable of great kindness and sympathy. During his final illness his satiric, puckish sense of humour did not desert him in spite of a leg amputation. Visited by an American dramatist whose work he had championed, he is reputed to have said as his last words, &#145;You see me&#146; (in a broad Western drawl) &#145;in the Last Chance Corral&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>). He died in Glasgow on 28 June 2005 from complications of diabetes, and was survived by his wife, Rosemary, and his two stepdaughters. Patrick Reilly in an obituary observed that &#145;wherever Philip went, literature flourished &hellip; To be the sponsor of three great movements of poetry&#151;in London, Belfast, and Glasgow &hellip; is no small achievement. To be praised by giants like Heaney and Gray is an accolade given to few&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Herald</span>).<br>
