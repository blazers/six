<span class="headword">Shaw,  John</span>  (1776&#150;1832), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 10 March 1776 at Bexley, Kent, the son of John Shaw and his wife, Elizabeth. He was apprenticed for seven years to George Gwilt the elder in 1790, and began to practise independently in 1798. With his wife, Elizabeth Hester Whitfield (<i>bap</i>. 1776, <i>d</i>. 1864), who was the daughter of his uncle Francis Whitfield and his wife, Elizabeth, Shaw had seven sons and two daughters. The eldest son was <a href="#cosubject_25259">John Shaw junior [<i>see below</i>]</a>; the seventh son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25270/', "Thomas Budd Shaw")</script>.<br>
<br>From 1799 until 1831 Shaw was a regular exhibitor at the Royal Academy. In 1803, following his appointment to the post of surveyor of the Eyre estate in St John's Wood, he exhibited at the academy ambitious plans for a &#145;British circus&#146; consisting of detached and semi-detached houses arranged in two circles on either side of a circular road. Although not the originator of this scheme, which was not carried into effect, Shaw and his eldest son were to become pioneers in the development of semi-detached houses in irregularly designed roads, as opposed to grid-plan terraced streets. In 1816 he was appointed architect and surveyor of Christ's Hospital school in Newgate Street, London, to which he made extensive additions: between 1820 and 1822 he built the infirmary; the west side of the quadrangle followed between 1825 and 1829, and the mathematics and grammar schools in 1832. These were built in the Gothic style, which Shaw later used to sympathetic effect in his additions to Newstead Abbey, Linby, Nottinghamshire (1818&#150;<i>c</i>.1830), for Colonel Wildman, who had purchased the abbey from Lord Byron. Other examples of his work in this style are the church of St Dunstan, Fleet Street (1831&#150;3; eventually completed by his son), and Ilam Hall, Staffordshire (1821&#150;6).<br>
<br>Shaw made extensive valuations of property in London, and was architect to the Phoenix Fire Assurance Company. In addition to the projects mentioned above, he built many country houses, including Blendon Hall, Kent (<i>c</i>.1815; destr. 1834) and Rooks' Nest (later Croome House), Surrey (<i>c</i>.1818). He was a member of the Architects' Club and a fellow of the Royal and Linnean societies and of the Society of Antiquaries.<br>
<br>As architect to the trustees of Ramsgate harbour, Shaw designed the clock house, the steps known as Jacob's Ladder, and the obelisk erected to commemorate a visit by George IV on his way to Hanover. He died suddenly on 30 July 1832 at the age of fifty-six, while working at Ramsgate harbour, and was buried at Bexley, Kent.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_25259"></a><span class="headword">John Shaw junior</span>  (1803&#150;1870), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 17 May 1803 at 25 Great James Street, Bedford Row, Holborn, London. He was a pupil of his father, whom he succeeded as architect to Christ's Hospital. About 1825 he became surveyor to Eton College, for which he designed the Tudor Gothic buildings in Weston's Yard at Eton, and developed the Chalcots estate near Chalk Farm in Hampstead, building semi-detached villas (1840&#150;50). His designs for the hall, schools, dormitories, and chapel at Eton were exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1825 and 1846, together with designs for a marine villa at Bognor, the Law Life Assurance Company, and the Royal Naval School at Deptford (later Goldsmiths' College), built in 1843&#150;4. He built Holy Trinity Church, Great New Street, Fetter Lane, in 1838, following which he published <span class="italic">A letter on ecclesiastical architecture as applicable to modern churches: addressed to the lord bishop of London</span> (1839), in which he advocated the use of the Romanesque style for that purpose. His last design, in the style of Wren, was Wellington College, Sandhurst, Berkshire (1855&#150;9).<br>
<br>Shaw was one of the official referees of metropolitan buildings from 1844 to 1855, when the duties of that office were transferred to the Metropolitan Board of Works. Described as early as 1843 in <span class="italic">The Builder</span> as a designer in the manner of Wren, a recent commentator noted further that &#145;it was as a designer of buildings in a revived &#147;Renaissance&#148; style that Shaw was most successful and original&#146;  (Colvin, <span class="italic">Archs</span>.). Shaw was a fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects. He died on 9 July 1870, at his home, 10 Sheffield Gardens, Kensington, London, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery. He left a widow, Jane, and a son, William Francis Shaw.<br>
