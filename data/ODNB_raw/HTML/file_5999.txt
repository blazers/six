<span class="headword">Colton,  (Charles) Caleb</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1777, <em>d.</em> 1832), <span class="occ">writer and Church of England clergyman</span>, was baptized at Shrivenham, Berkshire, on 11 December 1777, the son of Barfoot Colton (<i>bap</i>. 1736, <i>d</i>. 1803), who had been elected to King's College, Cambridge, in 1755, and was afterwards canon of Salisbury. Caleb Colton was educated at Eton College before being elected in 1796 to King's College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1799, and graduated BA in 1801 and MA in 1804. In 1801 he was presented by his college to the rectory of Prior's Portion, Tiverton, tenable with a fellowship. Here he published a sermon in 1809, a <span class="italic">Plain and Authentic Narrative of the Sampford Ghost</span> in 1810, and <span class="italic">Hypocrisy: a Satire in Three Books</span> (only one book published) in 1812.<br>
<br>Colton's character, talents, and opinions were better suited to a literary than to a clerical career, and he was also better known for his skill as a sportsman and fisherman than for any work as a divine. In 1818 he was presented to the college living of Kew and Petersham, Surrey, but it was here that his eccentricities, such as precipitately ending a service to go partridge shooting, became marked. A writer in the <span class="italic">Literary Magnet</span> who first met him in company with &#145;Walking Stewart&#146; (John Stewart) (1749&#150;1822) found him wearing military dress, appropriate, Colton claimed, to &#145;an officer of the church <i>militant</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 565). Colton apparently maintained that it was cheaper to live in London than at his living, and the same writer described his lodgings, which were over a marine-store shop, as squalid and littered with books, fishing-rods, and manuscripts. Cyrus Redding, however, countered this with his own declaration that Colton was always temperate, and his living quarters were clean. For a time Colton carried on business as a wine merchant.<br>
<br>In 1816 Colton published a poem, initially entitled <span class="italic">Napoleon</span>, as <span class="italic">Lines on the Conflagration of Moscow</span> (4th edn, 1822), and his <span class="italic">Remarks Critical and Moral on the Talents of Lord Byron</span> appeared in 1819. The first volume of his best-known work, <span class="italic">Lacon, or, Many Things in Few Words Addressed to those who Think</span>, was published in 1820, and had run to six editions by 1821. A second volume was added in 1822, and it was frequently reprinted. It is a collection of moral aphorisms, often very forcibly expressed, and some contemporaries charged him with borrowing from Bacon's <span class="italic">Essays</span> and the <span class="italic">Materials for Thinking</span> of William Burdon.<br>
<br>Colton was addicted to gambling, and became financially embarrassed. He had associated with John Thurtell, who murdered William Weare in 1823. When Colton disappeared about the same time, Thurtell was at first thought to be involved. According to Redding, however, Colton had in fact retired to America, his debts having been caused by speculations in Spanish bonds. He went to Paris, and in 1827 returned to claim his living. In 1828, however, he was officially removed for non-residence, and a successor was appointed.<br>
<br>Colton again visited America, and finally settled in Paris. He gambled at the Palais Royal, and is said at one time to have gained &pound;25,000, to have collected a picture gallery, and afterwards to have been ruined. Colton suffered from a painful disease, and falsified one of the remarks in <span class="italic">Lacon</span>, that no one ever committed suicide from bodily anguish, though thousands have done so from mental anguish, when, rather than submit to a surgical operation, he shot himself on 28 April 1832, while visiting Major Markham Sherwell at Fontainebleau. A volume called <span class="italic">Modern Antiquity, and other Poems</span> was edited by Sherwell in 1835.<br>
