<span class="headword">Stephens, Sir  Robert Graham</span>  (1931&#150;1995), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 14 July 1931 in Bristol, the first of the three children of Reuben Stephens (1905&#150;1985), a shipyard labourer and costing surveyor, and his wife, Gladys Millicent, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Deverell (1906&#150;1975), a chocolate-factory worker. Stephens was brought up virtually as an only child as his sister, Jackie, was nine years younger than he and his brother, John, fourteen years younger. He attended Portways Boys' School and, encouraged by an outside elocution teacher, won a free scholarship to the Bradford Civic Theatre School in Yorkshire in 1949. After a spell in provincial theatre, notably at the Library Theatre in Manchester, Stephens joined the newly formed English Stage Company at the Royal Court in London. There he made his name in the title role of John Osborne's second play (co-written with Anthony Creighton), <span class="italic">An Epitaph for George Dillon</span> (1958), and he originated the role of Peter the chef in Arnold Wesker's <span class="italic">The Kitchen</span> (1961). He also appeared in Osborne's <span class="italic">The Entertainer</span> with Laurence Olivier (whom he understudied as Archie Rice) in the West End. When Olivier started the National Theatre adventure, first at the Chichester Festival Theatre in Sussex and then at the Old Vic in London in 1963, Stephens was hired in a crucial phalanx of Royal Court shooting stars: directors William Gaskill and John Dexter, and actors Joan Plowright, Frank Finlay, and Colin Blakely. Margaret Natalie Cross (Maggie) Smith (<i>b</i>. 1934) joined this group from the West End, and Stephens promptly fell in love with her. He had first married the actress (Nora) Ann Simmonds in 1951, and their son, Michael, was brought up by his mother's brother when the marriage failed. Soon afterwards Stephens met the actress Tarn Gillian Bassett (<i>b</i>. 1928/9). They married on 26 April 1956 and produced one daughter, Lucy, an international lawyer. Stephens's affair with Maggie Smith, which began in 1964 when they played alongside Olivier in a revival of George Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Recruiting Officer</span>, was one of many romantic escapades. But their professional partnership under Olivier's aegis proved an exciting focus of attention in the National's early days. They married in 1967 and had two sons, Christopher and Toby, both actors.<br>
<br>These years were gloriously successful for Stephens. His National roles included Atahualpa, the Inca sun god, in Peter Shaffer's <span class="italic">The Royal Hunt of the Sun</span> (1964), a performance that was shamelessly influenced by Olivier's Othello. Half-naked and glistening, he emerged in a golden back wall that opened like a sunflower and spoke in a strange argot based on a study of Peruvian bird noises. This mesmerizing performance was followed by a preening Benedick (opposite Maggie Smith's brilliantly flirtatious Beatrice) in Franco Zeffirelli's production of <span class="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</span>; a besotted Sandy Tyrell (with Edith Evans, Maggie Smith, and Derek Jacobi) in No&euml;l Coward's <span class="italic">Hay Fever</span>; a tortured Loevborg in Ingmar Bergman's radical reworking of Ibsen's <span class="italic">Hedda Gabler</span> with Smith in the title role; and a touching Tom Wrench in Pinero's <span class="italic">Trelawny of the Wells</span>. This latter performance was as one of the several disappointed writers in whom Stephens seemed to specialize: his George Dillon was presented with a typewriter at the very moment that he knew he would never produce anything worthwhile; Tom Wrench embodied the future of new writing as he sacrificed his unquenchable love for Rose; his Loevborg was a nervous dissolute whose great manuscript was eaten up in the plot and the fire; and his Trigorin in Chekhov's <span class="italic">The Seagull</span> at the Greenwich Theatre in 1974, one of his greatest performances, was a philandering short-story specialist who was good but &#145;not as good as Turgenev&#146;. He had graduated from being an eye-catching juvenile with an easy stage manner, a musical voice, and a heartbreaking gift for pathos, to the stature of a more bestial, classical, and imposing artist. He saw himself in the great romantic tradition of Kean, Macready, and his hero, Olivier. The point was underlined in that same Greenwich season when he also played a sly, smiling Pastor Manders in Ibsen's <span class="italic">Ghosts</span> and a fleshy, guilt-racked Claudius in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>. He never went on to play Shakespeare's greatest tragic soldiers, Macbeth and Anthony, roles in which he might have excelled, and he was a disappointing Othello in Regent's Park.<br>
<br>It was not in Stephens's nature to be cautious, pragmatic, or materialistic; he never owned a house or a car. When his marriage to Maggie Smith began to fail, he launched a last-ditch attempt to save it in a revival by John Gielgud of No&euml;l Coward's <span class="italic">Private Lives</span> at the Queen's Theatre in 1972. As Elyot his performance was acclaimed as one of surprising morbidity, but the marriage ended in divorce in 1975. Smith had won an Oscar for her performance in the 1968 film of <span class="italic">The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie</span> (in which Stephens had a supporting role as the art teacher), but he could not match that Hollywood success with his own bid for stardom in Billy Wilder's <span class="italic">The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes</span> (1969). The rest of his film career was on the whole undistinguished. Trying for the West End money-spinner that always eluded him, he played the lead in <span class="italic">Murderer</span> (1975) by Anthony Shaffer, the author of the hit thriller <span class="italic">Sleuth</span>. The production was a failure, but not his new friendship with the actress Patricia Quinn. This relationship would prove the most stable of his life, and it lasted until his death.<br>
<br>Stephens always bounced back. In a second memorable term at the National Theatre in the early 1980s he played Pontius Pilate and Herod in Bill Bryden's production of <span class="italic">The Mysteries</span> in Tony Harrison's new version. The production was shown to the critics on an all-day Saturday assignment; they were astonished to find Stephens at the bar well before the official opening time, dispensing large gin and limes to all and sundry, but mainly himself. His subsequent performance was judged superlative. Again, his career went into decline, but he was given one last chance by Adrian Noble, the artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company who, as a schoolboy in Chichester, had been propelled towards a stage career by Stephens's performance as Atahualpa. Audiences relished his return to the front rank as a gloriously embittered, unsentimental Falstaff with the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1991. Two years later he played King Lear, again with the Royal Shakespeare Company, as one who knew only too well what it meant to see your life flashing before you. He caught the poignancy, humour, and sheer grandeur of Shakespeare's tragic hero in a way unrivalled in recent times. This completed a comeback on a par with that of Lazarus.<br>
<br>Stephens's last weeks were spent on a dialysis machine in the Royal Free Hospital, Hampstead, where he had undergone a kidney and liver transplant operation in September 1994. He was knighted in January 1995 and he married Patricia Quinn in the same month. He died in the hospital of liver failure in the early hours of 13 November 1995, just ten days after the publication of his autobiography, <span class="italic">Knight Errant</span>. In defiance of doctors' orders, he smoked untipped cigarettes to the last and took comfort in his own belief that it was impossible to be a good actor if you were a dull man. He was cremated at Golders Green.<br>
