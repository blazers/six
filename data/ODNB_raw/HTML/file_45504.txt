<span class="headword">Senior <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Hughes]</span>,  Jane Elizabeth</span>  (1828&#150;1877), <span class="occ">workhouse and school inspector and philanthropist</span>, was born on 10 December 1828 at Uffington House, Uffington, Berkshire, the only daughter of eight children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14079/', "John Hughes (1790&#150;1857)")</script>, author, and his second wife, Margaret Elizabeth (1797&#150;1887), second daughter of Thomas Wilkinson of Stokesley Hall, Yorkshire. Known as Jeanie, she had long blonde curly hair and blue eyes. On 10 August 1848 she married Nassau John Senior (1822&#150;1891), son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25090/', "Nassau William Senior (1790&#150;1864)")</script>, the distinguished economist. Her husband failed to make a success of the bar, and the couple lived with his parents at Hyde Park Gate during the early years of their marriage, when their son Walter Nassau Senior (1850&#150;1933) was born. The marriage was unhappy, and she found other interests, taking singing lessons with Manuel Garcia, which developed her fine mezzo-soprano voice. Through her friend Sara Prinsep she met the artist G. F. Watts, with whom she formed an intense friendship; she also had an intimate correspondence with the French polymath Prosper M&eacute;rim&eacute;e. In 1856 she adopted Helen Wilson, the motherless daughter of an Indian army officer. In 1860 she and her husband set up home in Clapham, taking in family members as paying lodgers; she also gave singing lessons to supplement their income, as her husband lacked permanent paid employment and was virtually cut out of his father's will.<br>
<br>Although Jane Senior was admired by her husband's sister Minnie, who described her as &#145;the brightest ornament in our house&#146;  (Simpson, 94), it is unlikely that she was close to her father-in-law, who held views on the relationship between the state and the poor far removed from hers. Her own brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14091/', "Thomas Hughes (1822&#150;1896)")</script>, author of <span class="italic">Tom Brown's Schooldays</span> (1857), was a Christian socialist who promoted working men's associations, and while there is no evidence of Jane Senior's involvement with these activities, her own work does display a belief not only in charitable work but also in a more active role for the state.<br>
<br>As part of cultured London society Jane Senior was well connected and, like many middle-class women of her time, heavily involved in charitable work; Octavia Hill (1838&#150;1912) and Louisa Twining (1820&#150;1912) were both her friends. Her views accorded well with those of Twining: both were keen to promote women's work, not only in a voluntary capacity but also in state welfare work with the poor. During the Crimean War Senior worked as part of a team sending supplies to soldiers; later, during the 1870&#150;71 Franco-Prussian War, she directed the ladies' committee of the London office of the Red Cross, for which she was awarded a Red Cross medal. She was also an active workhouse visitor with a special interest in the fate of young girls when they left the workhouse; in 1875 she founded the Metropolitan Association for Befriending Young Servants. Her organizational and workhouse experience led to her appointment as the first woman government inspector, and it is for this that she is remembered.<br>
<br>On 6 January 1873 James Stansfeld (1820&#150;1898), president of the Local Government Board and a renowned radical campaigner, in a move to receive &#145;a woman's point of view&#146;, appointed Jane Senior inspector of workhouses and of workhouse pauper schools with a brief to produce a report on the effect on girls of education in pauper schools. Both her appointment and report were controversial. The appointment of a woman was unpopular with other civil servants who, as Stansfeld later recalled, hated having a woman imposed on them. On 14 February 1874, however, her appointment was made permanent, with the position of senior inspector.<br>
<br>Since the early nineteenth century there had been campaigns for middle-class women to exercise greater influence over poor-law policy and the running of the workhouses. It was argued that women would bring their &#145;domestic economy&#146; skills to the work; indeed, the absence of women's influence was seen as a reason for the development of huge poor-law institutions, so beloved of official experts and decried by campaigners. From 1834 pauper children had been contained either in large London district institutions, in ordinary workhouses, or in separate schools. Intense debate peaked in the 1860s over the appropriate institutions for these children; although all were agreed that the type of institutions in which the children were placed was crucial to their future development and &#145;usefulness&#146; to society, the issue remained unresolved. Non-official attitudes emphasized the importance of a family, or at least a vicarious family, for children, especially girls, who needed training in domestic skills to fit them for future work as domestic servants, their most likely destination on leaving the control of the poor-law authorities. In the 1860s the huge district schools of London were brought into disrepute by scandalous revelations of mismanagement, disease, and overcrowding, and this strengthened the case for the &#145;family&#146; system.<br>
<br>Senior's report appeared in September 1874, in spite of attempts by E. C. Tufnell, the inspector of workhouse schools, to make her withdraw it. She recommended dividing large schools into: cottage homes with about thirty children in each; &#145;scattered homes&#146;, where about thirty children would all live under one roof but attend the local schools; and the more piecemeal, but ultimately more widely adopted suggestion, that orphans should be individually boarded out in working-class homes with foster parents who would receive reimbursement from the poor rates. Her report has been hailed as a landmark in the history of official policy, although in fact attitudes among officials towards pauper children had already begun to change. It was not so much the views that were novel as the manner of their presentation&#151;by a woman in an official capacity. Senior's ill health, which led to her resignation in November 1874, and Stansfeld's short-term tenure of his post meant that while the policy advocated by Senior was acted upon, Stansfeld's example of appointing a woman to a senior post was not emulated for many years to come.<br>
<br>Jane Senior, who had suffered for many years from a tumour of the uterus, died of haemorrhage and exhaustion on 24 March 1877 at her home, 98 Cheyne Walk, London; she was buried two days later at Brookwood cemetery, Woking. Her appointment as the first woman government inspector did not herald the arrival in Whitehall of women in high-profile and senior positions or break down prejudice against women in senior civil service posts; but her report did contribute to the development of the system of fostering of orphans in England.<br>
