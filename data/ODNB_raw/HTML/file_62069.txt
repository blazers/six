<span class="headword">Venetian painters in Britain</span>  (<em>act. </em>1708&#150;<em>c.</em>1750), <span class="occ">decorative painters</span>, were linked by kinship or close professional practice. Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini, Marco Ricci and Sebastiano Ricci, Antonio Bellucci, and Jacopo Amigoni worked mainly as decorative painters at various stages in England between 1708 and 1739. All were connected with London theatre and musical life, and on the whole their patrons were prominent whigs. Their artistic achievement in England is hard to judge since relatively little of their work survives <i>in situ</i>, or indeed at all. Though they were not Venetians by birth, the work of Giuseppe Grisoni and Antonio Joli in England places them within this group.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_66913"></a><span class="headword">Marco Ricci</span>  (1676&#150;1730)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 5 June 1676 at Belluno, in the republic of Venice, the son of Gerolamo Ricci, a landscape painter, and Gerolama Trevissoi. He probably trained with his uncle, <a href="#cosubject_66914">Sebastiano Ricci [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and is said to have fled to Dalmatia, where he was apprenticed to a landscape painter, after having killed a gondolier in a brawl. With Pellegrini he was invited to England in 1708 by the British ambassador at Venice, Charles Montagu, then earl and later first duke of Manchester. <a name="cosubject_62069"></a><span class="headword">Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini</span>  (1675&#150;1741)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 29 April 1675 in the parish of San Polo, Venice, the son of Antonio Pellegrini, a glove maker. Montagu's secretary, Christian Cole, a close friend of Rosalba Carriera, whose sister Angela (<i>d</i>. 1760) had married Pellegrini in early January 1704, may have suggested their names. By 1708 Pellegrini was a painter of high repute who had made use of Marco Ricci's services as a landscape specialist. Already well travelled, Pellegrini had worked with his master Paolo Pagani (1661&#150;1716) in Moravia and Vienna in the early 1690s, and had visited Rome from 1699 to 1701. His free, spirited handling and vivid colouring were indebted to his study of the late baroque of Luca Giordano and Giovanni Battista Gaulli. Marco Ricci was an eccentric, unstable character, whose career is poorly documented, but he worked in Florence and probably visited Rome. He painted classical landscapes, picturesque Veneto scenes, capriccios, and tempestuous landscapes indebted to Salvador Rosa and Alessandro Magnasco.<br>
<br>When he invited Pellegrini and Marco Ricci to London, Manchester's concerns were for the renovation of Kimbolton Castle, Huntingdonshire, by Vanbrugh, and the success of the new opera house in Haymarket, London, to which he hoped to attract first-rate Italian singers. After their arrival in late October 1708, the pair worked on the decoration of the hall and staircase at Manchester House (des.) and on scenery for two opera productions of 1709 under the management of Owen McSwiney. In 1709&#150;10 Charles Howard, third earl of Carlisle, employed them at Castle Howard in Yorkshire, recently completed by Vanbrugh, together with the north Italian stuccoists Giovanni Bagutti and Plura. The extensive decoration, largely destroyed by fire in 1940, included scenes from the <span class="italic">Iliad</span>, an unusual choice which may owe more to the tradition of theatre and opera than to conventional baroque iconography. Pellegrini and Ricci also worked for the young Richard Boyle, third earl of Burlington (or for his mother, Juliana), probably then painting the scenes from the <span class="italic">Metamorphoses</span>, now at Narford Hall, Norfolk, which were apparently presented to Sir Andrew Fountaine after Colen Campbell's reorganization of Burlington House. Fountaine also independently commissioned paintings from Pellegrini. About 1711&#150;12 William Henry Bentinck, second duke of Portland, employed Pellegrini at his house in St James's Square, London, for a fee of &pound;800 according to Vertue, suggesting that the decorations (des. 1748 during rebuilding) were substantial. Pellegrini's last major commission before he left for D&uuml;sseldorf in early summer 1713 was at Kimbolton Castle, where he painted the chapel, the grand staircase, and another room. Here and in the Narford canvases his radiant colour, sensuous brushwork, and often Veronese-inspired designs reveal his strengths as a virtuoso late baroque artist. The relative freedom allowed by his whig patrons, who were unencumbered by rigid patterns of patronage, together with his new-found interest in the work of Van Dyck and Rubens, had a dynamic effect on his style. For the first time Pellegrini painted family portraits, for Manchester and Carlisle and perhaps for the dramatist and dealer Peter Le Motteux, and he produced many cabinet pictures of biblical and mythological heroines for what must have been a demanding market.<br>
<br>While Marco Ricci had worked independently on theatre decoration in 1710, there is no evidence in the Carriera correspondence to support Vertue's account that the two painters had quarrelled. Marco Ricci travelled to Venice in summer 1711, accompanying the singer Catherine Tofts, and he returned with his uncle in the winter. <a name="cosubject_66914"></a><span class="headword">Sebastiano Ricci</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1659, <em>d.</em> 1734)<span class="occ"></span> was baptized on 1 August 1659 at Belluno, in the republic of Venice, the son of Livio Ricci and his wife, Andreana. In Venice he was apprenticed to Federico Cervelli (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1625, <i>d</i>. before 1700). Following a number of romantic entanglements, including a possible marriage to Anna Maria Venanza, on 12 September 1696 he married Maddalena Vandermer (<i>c</i>.1663&#150;1742). Ricci's early career involved long sojourns in Bologna (where he learned the guitar), Parma, Rome, and Milan. Except for a trip to Vienna in 1701&#150;2, he was mainly based in Venice from 1696 until 1706 when he joined Marco Ricci at the Florentine court. Sebastiano Ricci's travels enabled him to study the best of Italian art, from the proto-baroque of Correggio in Parma to the energetic and witty classicism of Annibale Carracci at the Palazzo Farnese in Rome. In Venice in 1708 he painted a lyrical homage to Veronese in a celebrated altarpiece for San Giorgio Maggiore. Perhaps he went to London, as Vertue recounts, to mortify Pellegrini; perhaps he was invited by Queen Anne, as Pascoli states; more likely he was grasping the opportunity to compete for the prestigious commission of the dome of St Paul's Cathedral, for a rumour to that effect had reached John Talman in Rome by November 1711. Pellegrini had already entered the public competition of 1709, and he and Sir James Thornhill were invited in February 1710 to paint &#145;little cupolas&#146; or models: it is unlikely that <span class="italic">The Trinity and Saints</span> (V&amp;A; repr. Knox, pl. 42) of 1710 relates to this, as it had already been decided that the subjects were to come from the <span class="roman">Acts of the Apostles</span>. The commission was not resolved until June 1715, and Ricci's involvement is undocumented. Instead he found a lavish patron in Lord Burlington, who in 1712&#150;13 commissioned monumental canvases of mythological subjects for the staircase of Burlington House, London, and a variety of others on biblical or classical themes, some of which were installed in his villa at Chiswick in the late 1720s. Handel also enjoyed Burlington's patronage in this period, and would have known Pellegrini and the Riccis&#151;some of their paintings were in his collection. Other whig figures who commissioned work from Sebastiano Ricci include Richard Arundell, a friend of Fountaine, and the duke of Portland, who paid &pound;1000 for decorative work at Portland House completed by the summer of 1713 (largely destroyed through rebuilding, 1748). This included a ceiling with <span class="italic">The Choice of Hercules</span> as a centrepiece, recalling the earl of Shaftesbury's espousal of the subject in 1712 as an illumination of his moral philosophy (dem. 1938). In the autumn Sebastiano and Marco Ricci decorated the duke's chapel at Bulstrode House (des. by rebuilding, 1862). Sebastiano Ricci is not documented at Kneller's Academy, where Pellegrini was one of the directors (and was active in life-drawing classes); however, he presented an allegory on the treaty of Utrecht to the Painter&#150;Stainers' Company, perhaps at the time when Handel's <span class="roman">Utrecht <i>Te Deum</i></span> was performed. While little is known of Marco's independent work, his landscapes were clearly popular and the many versions that exist of his <span class="italic">Opera Rehearsal</span>, including one at Castle Howard (1709&#150;10; repr. Scarpa Sonino, <span class="italic">Ricci</span>, fig. 59), a playful group portrait, attest to the popularity of this early exercise in sardonic social observation.<br>
<br>Portland, Burlington, and probably other patrons who employed both painters, could compare Pellegrini's sketchy, festive style with Sebastiano Ricci's powerful, dynamic manner. A more versatile, inventive artist, Ricci adapted his style to suit the developing classicizing taste of English patrons, looking to the Roman and Bolognese artists whom they admired as well as to the qualities of Veronese. Charles Talbot, first duke of Shrewsbury, an admirer of the Roman baroque, was keen to have Ricci decorate the prince of Wales's bedchamber; however, Lord Halifax insisted that the commission go to Thornhill, for the sake of his career and for the encouragement of English artists. Possibly Shrewsbury obtained for Ricci instead the commission to paint the <span class="italic">Resurrection</span> mural at Chelsea Hospital in 1714&#150;15. In late summer 1715 Sebastiano Ricci left England, since he is documented in Milan in September; Marco Ricci presumably left with him. In Venice the pair continued to collaborate and to work for British patrons, painting two of the allegorical tombs of whig worthies commissioned by Owen McSwiney in the early 1720s, and numerous works for Joseph (later Consul) Smith. Both were closely associated with Venetian theatre and opera. Sebastiano Ricci bought a handsome apartment in the calle del Salvadego with his English wealth where Marco resided until his death on 21 January 1730. He was unmarried. He was buried on 22 January in the Venetian church of San Mois&egrave;. In London Marco had painted atmospheric landscapes in gouache on kidskin, a technique taken up by Joseph Goupy, and he probably made caricatures there too; he explored these new genres with great originality in his remaining years in Venice, while also experimenting with etching from 1723. Sebastiano enjoyed a high international reputation in his late career as a painter who had rediscovered the values of Veronese. He died in Venice on 15 May 1734. Pellegrini's later career was a peripatetic one. After two profitable years at the court of D&uuml;sseldorf, followed by a sojourn in the Netherlands, he was again invited to England in 1719 by the British ambassador at The Hague, William Cadogan, to decorate his country house (des. by fire before 1770). During these months, from May to late October, Pellegrini may also have worked on the staircase decoration at Cowdray House, Sussex, for Lord Montacute (des. 1793 by fire) and perhaps for Sir Andrew Fountaine at Narford. For the remaining twenty-two years of his life Pellegrini worked all over Europe, especially for the courts of Dresden, W&uuml;rzburg, Vienna, and Mannheim, while also painting the enormous ceiling of the &#145;Salle Mississippi&#146; at the Banque Royale in Paris for John Law in 1720 (des. 1722 during renovations). He died on 2 November 1741 in Venice and was buried there in the church of San Vidal on 3 November.<br>
<br>The commercial success of Pellegrini and the Riccis in England may have induced other painters to try their luck there. Niccol&ograve; Cassana (1659&#150;1713), active in Venice from 1698 as the agent of Grand Duke Ferdinand and a friend of Sebastiano Ricci, went to London <i>c</i>.1710&#151;invited, according to C. F. Ratti, to paint portraits for Queen Anne. Vertue records that he and Sebastiano engaged in picture dealing, supplying the nobility with often dubious old masters. Vincenzo Damini (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1690&times;92, <i>d</i>. after 1749), a follower of Pellegrini, is said to have come from D&uuml;sseldorf to London, and Vertue notes that he arrived about 1713, but he may not have arrived until 1719&#150;20. He left for Italy in 1730, accompanied by his pupil, the unconventional and talented Giles Hussey. Vertue associated Damini with Francesco Riario, a Bolognese history painter, one of whose few documented works is a portrait of John Devoto (<i>fl</i>. 1708&#150;1752), a painter of Genoese parentage who worked as a stage designer from 1718 at Drury Lane, London, and elsewhere. The Flemish-born <a name="cosubject_11649"></a><span class="headword">Giuseppe Grisoni</span>  (1699&#150;1769)<span class="occ"></span> was born at Mons on 24 October 1699. Of his parents nothing is known. He studied in Florence and Rome and came to England with John Talman in 1715, working as a draughtsman. He developed as a portraitist and history painter, decorating a ceiling at Canons for James Brydges, first duke of Chandos. His depiction of Colley Cibber as Lord Foppington in Vanbrugh's <span class="italic">The Relapse</span> (Garrick Club, London; repr. Ashton no. 116) is a rare early theatrical portrait, while a painting showing one of the masquerades at the King's Theatre organized by John James Heidegger (V&amp;A; exh. NPG, 1985, no. 105) may be by his hand. In 1724 Grisoni married an Englishwoman, Anne St John (<i>d</i>. 1739?), to whom he had given drawing lessons, and returned to Italy in 1728, taking with him William Hoare as his pupil. He worked successfully in Florence until 1740 and subsequently in Rome, where he died in 1769, as a sculptor and history painter. Little is known of the career of Francesco Sleter (<i>c</i>.1685&#150;1775), who called himself a Venetian, although undocumented in contemporary Venetian sources. He is first recorded in England as working for the duke of Chandos at Canons in 1719; he probably decorated the state rooms at Grimsthorpe Castle for Peregrine Bertie, second duke of Ancaster, after Vanbrugh completed the building in 1724; here his style is close to Bellucci's. Sleter is later documented in 1731, painting murals based on Spenser's <span class="italic">Faerie Queene</span> for the Temple of Venus at Stowe, Buckinghamshire, while in 1732 he provided grisaille decoration for Benjamin Styles at Moor Park, Hertfordshire. In the mid- and late 1730s he was paid for ceiling decorations at Mereworth Castle (Kent) for John Fane, later seventh earl of Westmorland; he died at Mereworth in 1775.<br>
<br>The most celebrated artist to arrive in these years was <a name="cosubject_66915"></a><span class="headword">Antonio Bellucci</span>  (1654&#150;1726)<span class="occ"></span>. He was born on 19 February 1654 in Venice and baptized there in the church of Santa Maria Formosa on 26 February, the son of Giovan Battista Bellucci and Caterina Volpato. He studied drawing in Dalmatia (Sebenico) with a nobleman, Domenico Difnico, and some time before 1680 married Maria, with whom he had three children baptized in June 1680, 1683, and 1684 in Venice. Bellucci had gained fame in his native Venice in the 1680s, developing a neo-Veronesian manner which was also indebted to Bolognese and Roman baroque art. Although he worked periodically on religious and secular commissions in Venice, he was essentially a successful court painter, celebrating the glory of the ruling Liechtenstein family at Vienna (1692&#150;1703) and the Wittelsbach at D&uuml;sseldorf (1706&#150;16) with allegorical cycles enshrining their virtues. In 1716 at the death of his patron, the elector Johann Wilhelm, Bellucci left D&uuml;sseldorf for London, no doubt encouraged by Pellegrini. His reputation went before him, and he decorated an unspecified house in Pall Mall on his arrival. Little is known of his patrons, and by comparison with the versatile Ricci, he may have seemed old-fashioned. His major patron was the first duke of Chandos, who brought together the leading history painters of the day at Canons, together with the stuccoists Giovanni Bagutti and Giuseppe Artari, who had also worked in Germany. Handel was still director of music at Canons in 1719, and Bellucci could well have known him from D&uuml;sseldorf. Among other decorations (des. <i>c</i>.1747&#150;8), he painted the enormous library ceiling with a complex allegory recalling the rhetoric he had employed for the elector palatine. His canvases from the ceiling of the chapel, completed by August 1720, survive at Great Witley church, Worcestershire, while the four paintings commissioned by the duke for St Lawrence's Church, Little Stanmore, Whitchurch, Middlesex, survive <i>in situ</i>. At Chandos House in St James's Square, London, Bellucci decorated the duke's visiting room and picture room (des. by rebuilding, 1735). He may have felt at home in England to some extent, especially when Pellegrini returned, or when the antiquarian and connoisseur Anton Maria Zanetti, a close friend of the Riccis and Pellegrini, visited in summer 1721; moreover he would have known Giacomo Leoni from the D&uuml;sseldorf court. However, Bellucci suffered from gout, and left in July 1722, working in the Veneto until his death at the family home in Pieve di Soligo on 29 August 1726. His son Giovanni Battista Bellucci (1684&#150;1760) remained, making his career as a portraitist in England and Ireland; his portrait of the librettist Paolo Rolli (priv. coll.; exh. NPG, 1985, no. 90) evokes the family's associations with London musical life.<br>
<br>It has been convincingly argued that the first generation of whig nobility admired the mercantile, oligarchic republic of Venice and associated its civic virtues with the architectural style of Palladio, hence the position of Palladianism as the English national style by the 1720s. The employment of artists who worked in the manner of Veronese by prominent whigs has been seen as a deliberate reinforcement of this analogy with the cultural as well as political virtues of Venice. It can be objected that Pellegrini's major decorative projects were associated with Vanbrugh, and that he and the Riccis had more in common with the cosmopolitan world of Italian music and of late baroque decoration than with the essentially protestant and rational ethos of English Palladianism. However, as distinct from large-scale history painting in oil on plaster, Pellegrini and Sebastiano Ricci could also provide canvases to be inset in decorative surrounds in Palladian interiors. Sebastiano Ricci's work was undoubtedly favoured by Burlington; moreover, he designed the frontispiece to Leoni's <span class="italic">The Architecture of A. Palladio</span> (1715), to which he and Marco Ricci were subscribers. Sebastiano was the most successful of this group of Venetians in England: Vertue reported the death in 1734 of this &#145;excellent and famous painter&#146;, noting that his works in England would remain &#145;a Monument of Fame&#151;to him and to the Honour of this Nation&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 3.65). But in general by the 1720s the established taste for Italian opera and for Veronese-inspired history painting tended to raise nationalistic hackles, leading to a movement in favour of a more robust, naturalistic &#145;English&#146; style in music, theatre, and art. The Venetian painter whom this affected most strongly was Jacopo Amigoni.<br>
<br>Born in Venice, the son of Pietro Amigoni and Caterina Fischi, <a name="cosubject_62062"></a><span class="headword">Jacopo Amigoni</span>  (<em>c.</em>1680<span class="mult">x</span>85&#150;1752)<span class="occ"></span>, whose name also appears as Giacomo Amiconi in various sources, is recorded as &#145;abroad&#146; in 1711, and, according to Vertue, who may have had the information at first hand, he was a pupil of Bellucci at D&uuml;sseldorf. Certainly Amigoni's career was made in Germany, particularly at the court of the elector Max II Emanuel von Wittelsbach; he worked at Nymphenburg, Schleissheim, and the abbey of Ottobeuren from 1716 to 1729, visiting Venice, Rome, and Naples in 1728&#150;9. His pupil Joseph Wagner (1706&#150;1780) was to join him in London in 1732. Receptive to both French and Venetian influences, Amigoni's art evolved from a lightened Bellucci-like manner to a delicate, cosmopolitan style, with cool, powdery colours and a finish evoking the softness of pastel. In late 1729 Amigoni travelled to London with his sister Carlotta (a painter and engraver) and an Italian opera singer, presumably one engaged by Handel on his trip to Germany in that year.<br>
<br>Amigoni decorated the staircase of Lord Tankerville's house in St James's Square, London, in early 1730 (des. by rebuilding <i>c</i>.1753), collaborating with the Lombard <i>quadraturist</i> Gaetano Brunetti (<i>d</i>. 1758). He worked elsewhere with Brunetti (who was also a scene-painter) including the staircase of the duke of Chandos's new residence at Cavendish Square in 1735 (des.). His paintings, generally on canvas rather than plaster, attracted fashionable attention: the queen visited Lord Tankerville's house to view his work in 1732, while the staircase decoration for the Spanish ambassador at Powis House (des.) provided the catalyst for controversy in 1734. Amigoni was attacked by James Ralph in the <span class="italic">Weekly Register</span> as a foreigner who painted in an overblown and superficial manner, compared with the more wholesome and realistic qualities of English art. Although this attack was held up for ridicule by Bavius in the <span class="italic">Grub Street Journal</span>, Ralph's views were shared if not encouraged by Hogarth, whose animosity towards Amigoni in particular was inflamed by the action of Benjamin Styles in publicly rejecting Thornhill's history paintings for the hall at Moor Park. Styles turned to Amigoni instead in 1732 for some light-hearted Ovidian scenes, with grisaille paintings by Sleter in the upper level, the whole set amid elegant stucco-work by Bagutti. Another possible bone of contention was Amigoni's decoration of the rebuilt Covent Garden Theatre for Hogarth's friend John Rich in 1732 (lost in renovations, 1782). Hogarth prevented Amigoni from obtaining the commission for the staircase at St Bartholomew's Hospital in 1734 by volunteering himself for the task. Amigoni was identified with Italian opera through his close friendship with the famous castrato Farinelli, in London from 1734, and his marriage on 17 May 1738 to Maria Antonia Marchesini (La Lucchesina), the opera singer who made her London d&eacute;but at the King's Theatre in 1737. He may have collaborated with George Lambert on the scenery for Handel's opera <span class="italic">Atalanta</span> in 1736. Meanwhile, Amigoni set up a print studio with Wagner (a business partnership that was to continue until his death) which produced prints after Amigoni's paintings, including portraits and a group, <span class="italic">Cries of London</span>, while prints after Canaletto were planned. Doubtless competition with Hogarth and Arthur Pond fuelled the studio's energies; moreover, as the taste for allegorical and mythological decorative paintings was receding, Amigoni's activities diversified. However, he continued to work as a history painter, painting a ceiling for Thomas Wentworth, first earl of Strafford, in 1735 and probably collaborating with Sleter at Mereworth Castle in 1736&#150;9, although payments are recorded only to Sleter. Charles Howard negotiated with Amigoni in 1731 and in 1736&#150;7 for four paintings, <span class="italic">The Labours of Hercules</span>, for Hawksmoor's Tempietto at Castle Howard (which were apparently never executed): knowing his patron's tastes, Amigoni cited Pellegrini's prices. Amigoni painted small-scale histories exquisitely on copper for <span class="italic">The Temple of the Four Monarchies of the World</span> (Royal Collection), the complex musical clock designed by Charles Clay, with sculptural ornament by Rysbrack and Roubiliac, and music by Handel, Geminiani, and Corelli, which was purchased by Augusta, princess of Wales, in 1743.<br>
<br>Although Amigoni was more successful in some ways as a portraitist of fashionable society than Hogarth, the limitations of his elegant, courtly style were recognized. Queen Caroline and the prince of Wales sat to him, and apart from painting other members of the royal family he portrayed sitters such as the young Charles Frederick, subsequently an important patron of Andrea Casali, while his allegorical portrait of Farinelli (National Museum, Bucharest; repr. Scarpa Sonino, <span class="italic">Amigoni</span>, 88) was admired in his studio in 1735. Amigoni and Wagner returned to Venice in mid-1739. There he painted altarpieces and decorative works for an international clientele, remaining in contact with Farinelli, who had left London for Madrid in 1737. At Farinelli's instigation Amigoni was invited to become first painter to Fernando VI: from 1747 until his death on 22 August 1752 in the Calle del Barquillo, Madrid, he worked on fresco decoration, court portraits, and stage designs. He was buried on 23 August in the church of San Jos&eacute;, Madrid.<br>
<br>Amigoni may have encouraged Antonio Canal, called Canaletto, to visit England, and <a name="cosubject_62068"></a><span class="headword">Antonio Joli</span>  (<em>c.</em>1700&#150;1777)<span class="occ"></span> was able to benefit from the latter's popularity with the English. A talented painter of stage scenery and <i>vedute</i>, Joli was born in Modena, where he studied perspective under Raffaello Rinaldi before becoming a pupil of Giovanni Paolo Panini in Rome. He worked for the theatre in Modena, and in Venice from 1732 until 1742, where he married. After travelling to Germany he settled in London from 1744 to 1748 or 1749. Joli was taken up by Heidegger, working for him at the King's Theatre and decorating his house in Richmond with landscapes and capriccios. Farinelli must have known Joli's theatrical work, for he was invited to the Spanish court in 1749. Joli left Madrid for Italy in 1754, and was a founder member of the Venetian Academy in 1755, but by the late 1750s was in Naples, working on a large group of topographical views for John, Lord Brudenell. He worked in Naples from 1762 as a painter of scenery, of court life, and of sparkling <i>vedute</i>. Joli died on 29 April 1777 in Naples, survived by his wife.<br>
