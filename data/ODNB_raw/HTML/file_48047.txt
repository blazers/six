<span class="headword">Larnach,  Donald</span>  (1817&#150;1896), <span class="occ">banker and financier</span>, was born on 17 July 1817 at Caithness, Scotland, one of at least two sons of William Larnach (<i>d</i>. 1829), reputedly a naval purser, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith. Little is known about his early life, but he clearly received a good education. In 1834 he joined his squatter brother, John, in New South Wales. During the 1840s' colonial depression he bought a steam flour mill in Sydney and also traded and acquired urban and pastoral property. On 3 September 1845 he married Jane Elizabeth, the eldest daughter of a leading merchant and fellow countryman, William Walker, the influence of whose advice and guidance he later generously acknowledged.<br>
<br>In 1845 Larnach began his legendary association with the Bank of New South Wales, first as auditor and, from the following year, as an innovative and respected director. Compact and well-proportioned in figure and features, Larnach had a composed appearance which belied energy and confidence. Following his involvement in the reconstitution of the bank in 1850, he was elected president (1852&#150;3). He steered his charge to notable prosperity, greatly enhanced by direct dealing in gold. Generous-minded, Larnach identified easily with a rising colonial society, and was early bent on making its first bank successful: by 1866 the &#145;Wales&#146; had assets greater than any other bank in Australia.<br>
<br>By the age of thirty-six Larnach had laid the foundation of a personal fortune and was also a director of a gold company. After moving to London in 1852 he organized a branch for the bank that freed it from overseas agencies. He was appointed foundation managing director at Cannon Street in 1854, where for more than forty years he promoted expansion of the bank outside Australia. Ambitious to make an impression and even &#145;take the lead of all others&#146;, he could soon write, &#145;we stand as high as any Bank in London and you may say to our friends that although many of them thought it very fine to belong to English Banks, I would not exchange with any of them&#146;  (Larnach to Alexander Stuart, 2 Jan 1854, London letter-book, B/LON/2, Westpac archives).<br>
<br>While a steady flow of gold from Australia had no doubt helped, Larnach's fine judgement, finesse, and acute professional principles met recognition in the capital. He became director (1858&#150;91) and president of the London Joint Stock Bank, and a director of the Chartered Mercantile Bank of India, London, and China and of the Indemnity Mutual Marine Insurance Co. During the financial crisis following the collapse of Overend, Gurney &amp; Co. in 1866 he chaired a committee formed to contain the failure of the Agra and Masterman's Bank. In the panic he assured headquarters at Sydney that &#145;I always hold myself in readiness to pledge all I have in the world for the Bank here&#146;  (Larnach to Shepherd Smith, 26 Sept 1866, London letter-book, B/LON/2, Westpac archives). It was no small pledge. Larnach fully appreciated the subtleties, social and otherwise, of metropolitan financial activities. Living at Kensington Palace Gardens (&#145;Millionaires' Row&#146;), and riding in nearby Hyde Park, he entertained appropriately but not ostentatiously; his estate, Brambletye, in Sussex (where he was high sheriff in 1883), was close to members of the Walker family.<br>
<br>Larnach raised loans and development finance on the London market for the Australian colonies, adroitly reducing the consequences of unco-ordinated borrowing. His shrewdness was a byword in the Antipodes, and his advice widely depended on. He kept in close touch with the bank's Sydney management and with visitors, correspondents, and colonial politicians. In the early 1870s Larnach virtually ran the New South Wales agent-general's office in London. In 1879 he was appointed chairman of the London board and retired as managing director. Increasingly sceptical of the financial management of short-lived colonial administrations, he agreed in 1884&#151;when the bank relinquished the New South Wales government account, held since 1868&#151;that &#145;&hellip; we would be as well without their business&#146;  (Larnach to Shepherd Smith, 8 Aug 1884, London letter-book, B/LON/2, Westpac archives). Larnach visited Australia, where he retained investments and property, in 1880 and 1886. A founding vice-president of the Institute of Bankers, he was acknowledged as the doyen of Australian bankers.<br>
<br>Survived by his wife, two sons, and a daughter, Larnach died at home, at 21 Kensington Palace Gardens, Kensington, London, on 12 May 1896.<br>
