<span class="headword">Marks,  Henry Stacy</span>  (1829&#150;1898), <span class="occ">artist</span>, was born on 13 September 1829 at 92 Great Portland Street, London, and baptized at the church of All Souls, Langham Place, on 9 October 1829, the fourth child and eldest surviving son of John Isaac Marks and his wife, Elizabeth Pally. His father was a former solicitor who had given up that profession before his birth in order to take over the running of the family coach building business, an unwise decision since under his management the business declined. Although he was baptized into the Church of England, Marks was brought up as a dissenter. Compelled to attend lengthy sermons at Craven Chapel, off Regent Street, during his childhood, he developed a streak of anti-clericalism which later manifested itself in his fondness for preaching bogus sermons.<br>
<br>Marks was educated at small private schools near Regent's Park and later at Eythorne in Kent, where, to enable him to assist in the carriage-making business, his father sent him to learn to paint crests and coats of arms. In 1845 he began work as a ledger clerk at a warehouse owned by a friend of his father and soon afterwards joined his father's business. To improve his skill as a painter Marks began about 1846 to attend evening classes at J. M. Leigh's art school in Newman Street. After an earlier rejection, Marks enrolled at the Royal Academy Schools in December 1851. Early in the following year his father was forced to sell the carriage works; this left him free to attend the day classes at the academy, but instead his friend P. H. Calderon persuaded Marks to accompany him to Paris to study at the atelier of Fran&ccedil;ois Edouard Picot. Marks also attended the &Eacute;cole des Beaux-Arts, but he returned to England in June 1852, leaving Calderon to continue his studies in Paris.<br>
<br>Marks first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1853, showing a scene from Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</span>: <span class="italic">Dogberry Examining Conrad and Borachio</span>. It was hung under the line next to Holman Hunt's <span class="italic">Strayed Sheep</span> and sold to a fellow student for &pound;15. Marks commented: &#145;I have never enjoyed the sale of any other [work] so much&#146;  (Morris and Milner, 61). The works Marks exhibited at the Royal Academy during the 1850s and 1860s were generally either scenes from Shakespeare's plays, for example, <span class="italic">Bardolph</span> (exh. RA, 1853) or <span class="italic">Francis Feeble, Woman's Tailor</span> (1865; reproduced in Morris and Milner, 63), or historical genre paintings of medieval scenes. Of his Shakespearian scenes, G. C. Williamson remarks that, &#145;few men were so much at home in Shakespeare as was Marks, and that he knew by heart whole plays&#146;  (Bryan, <span class="italic">Painters</span>, 287). Painting scenes of medieval life allowed Marks to practise a neo-medieval style of painting which tended to give his figures a na&iuml;ve quality, for example, <span class="italic">Toothache in the Middle Ages</span> (exh. RA, 1856; reproduced in Marks, 1.53).<br>
<br>With the failure of his business, John Marks had emigrated to Australia during his son's stay in Paris, and Marks for a time had to support his mother and three younger brothers. His responsibilities increased when on 4 October 1856 he married Helen Drysdale (1829&#150;1892). To supplement his income from painting he took on commissions for wood-drawings for illustrations in <span class="italic">The Home Circle</span> books, and was art critic of <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>. He carried out porcelain decoration for the Minton works, church decoration for the firm of Clayton and Bell, friezes for theatres, furniture painting for the architect William Burges, and even Christmas cards. His painting <span class="italic">A Bit of Blue</span> (1877; Royal Albert Memorial Museum, Exeter), which depicts a porcelain collector examining an addition to his collection, was probably inspired by his earlier work for Minton. The patronage and friendship of the publisher C. E. Mudie and the sale of one of his humorous medieval genre paintings, <span class="italic">The Franciscan Sculptor and his Model</span> (exh. RA, 1861), for the handsome sum of 300 guineas, brought Marks greater financial security, although he continued to carry out commissions for decorative work. For example, he designed a frieze for an outside wall of the Albert Hall. Most of his later decorative work, however, was for private houses, including that of the neo-classical painter Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema. His largest commission for house decoration was from Hugh Lupus Grosvenor, first duke of Westminster; he worked on decorations for Eaton Hall, Cheshire, between 1874 and 1880, painting two canvasses 35 feet long of Chaucer's pilgrims for the saloon, and in 1879 twelve panels of birds for the drawing-room.<br>
<br>Marks became a member of the St John's Wood Clique when in 1862 he moved with his wife to Hill Road, St John's Wood. The clique was an association of young artists who shared an interest in historical genre painting. Marks's friend P. H. Calderon also became a member, and his brother-in-law Frederick Walker (who did not live in St John's Wood) was associated with the group. Members aimed to improve their work by submitting it to the rigorous and constructive criticism of the group. Their motto, as framed by Calderon, was, &#145;the better each man's picture, the better for all&#146;  (Marks, 1.147). The clique also had a recreational function, and at meetings Marks would entertain the company by preaching bogus sermons and singing comic songs he had composed. He is depicted in Walker's cartoon <span class="italic">A Vision of the Clique</span> (1865; reproduced in Marks, 1.90) holding a fool's bauble. Marks was high-spirited but prone to moods of melancholy and misanthropy. His sympathy with, and generosity to, his fellow artists made him very popular in artistic circles.<br>
<br>Marks had been fond of birds since his childhood, but he did not begin to use them as subjects for painting until the middle of his career. <span class="italic">The Convent Raven</span> (1870; Bristol City Art Gallery) is an early bird painting in oils. <span class="italic">St Francis Preaching to the Birds</span> (1870), one of his key works, sold for &pound;1155 seven years after Marks sold it to Agnews for &pound;450. His favourite subjects, however, were long-legged birds, particularly storks, cranes, and herons. He also took great delight in parrots and frequently visited the parrot house at London Zoo in order to sketch them. These visits inspired what is probably Marks's most famous painting, <span class="italic">A Select Committee</span> (1891; Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool). <span class="italic">Convocation</span> (exh. RA, 1878), which depicts a group of adjutant storks, secured his election as Royal Academician following his election as associate in 1871. It won high, though not unqualified, praise from the eminent art critic John Ruskin. His diploma work, <span class="italic">Science is Measurement</span>, was regarded as &#145;one of his highest achievements&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Most of Marks's pictures of birds were watercolours, which he exhibited either at the Old Watercolour Society, of which he became associate in 1871 and member in 1883, or at the two &#145;bird exhibitions&#146; at the Fine Art Society, which he held in 1889 and 1890. The Victoria and Albert Museum has three of his finished watercolour studies of birds and eleven watercolour sketches for larger bird paintings. Although he was interested in parallels between human behaviour and bird behaviour, Marks did not anthropomorphize his avian subjects. Mr Bartlett, the superintendent of London Zoo, for whom Marks had great respect, discouraged him from imputing human characteristics to birds. His higher reputation as a bird painter rather than as a genre painter rests on the fact that his birds tend to display considerably more animation than his human figures. In his later years Marks painted land- and seascapes &#145;of notable serenity and breadth&#146; of scenes around Southwold and Walberswick in Suffolk  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>).<br>
<br>Marks's first wife died in 1892. The following year, on 21 December, he married Mary Harriet Kempe (1848&#150;1911), a still-life and genre painter. Marks died on 9 January 1898 at his home, 5 St Edmund's Terrace, Regent's Park, and was buried four days later in Hampstead cemetery.<br>
