<span class="headword">Bowers,  George Hull</span>  (1794&#150;1872), <span class="occ">dean of Manchester</span>, born in Staffordshire, was the son of Francis Bowers. He was sent to the Pembroke grammar school, and from there proceeded to Clare College, Cambridge, in 1819 as a &#145;ten year man&#146;, graduating BD in 1829 and DD in 1849. Ordained in 1819 he was appointed perpetual curate of Elstow, Bedfordshire, and was a tutor in the family of the duke of Bedford, who appointed him to the rectory of St Paul's, Covent Garden, in 1832. He was select preacher of his university in 1830 and was elected FSA in 1836. He was twice married; his elder son, Francis, was born in 1829.<br>
<br>Bowers was one of the collaborators with the Revd Charles Eaton Plater (1798&#150;1854) in the establishment of a public boarding-school, with modest fees, chiefly for sons of clergymen. He published a scheme for such an institution in 1842; Marlborough College, Wiltshire, opened in the following year. He resigned as honorary secretary of the school in 1844 following evangelical criticisms of its Tractarian tendency. He then became involved with Rossall School, founded at Fleetwood, Lancashire, in 1844 by the Revd St Vincent Beechey (1806&#150;1899) as a safer protestant alternative for clergy sons. Among the early pupils was Bowers's younger son, George Henry Bowers, who entered the church. He also assisted in the foundation of Haileybury College (1862).<br>
<br>In June 1847, following the death of Dean Herbert, Bowers was nominated by Lord John Russell to the deanery of Manchester, an office which he held until 26 September 1871. He was not a frequent preacher in Manchester, but his pulpit discourses were at once simple and scholarly, and his delivery effective. He was a warm advocate of the &#145;free and open church movement&#146;, attacking pew rents in addresses and sermons. He was for this reason instrumental in the erection of St Alban's, Cheetwood, and various addresses which he delivered there were printed. On his resignation of the office of dean of Manchester he retired to Leamington, where he died on 27 December 1872. He bequeathed &pound;300 for the support of the special Sunday evening services at Manchester Cathedral, where a window and a brass were placed by his widow to his memory. One of his daughters, Georgiana Bowers (<i>b</i>. 1836), was a noted illustrator of scenes of hunting and country life in <span class="italic">Punch</span>.<br>
