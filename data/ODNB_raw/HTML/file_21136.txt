<span class="headword">Paisible,  James <span class="st"> [Jacques]</span></span>  (<em>c.</em>1656&#150;1721), <span class="occ">composer and recorder player</span>, was born in France, probably in or near Paris. He was related to Guillaume Paisible (<i>c</i>.1659&#150;1728), a page in the <i>chambre du roy</i> at Louis XIV's court, and probably to Louis Paisible, a wind musician there. Paisible presumably grew up learning wind and stringed instruments from one of the <i>joueurs de violons, hautbois, sacquebouttes et cornets</i> in the <i>grande &eacute;curie</i>. Paisible apparently came to England in September 1673 with the composer Robert Cambert, whose plan to produce French-style operas failed. Paisible was among the French oboe and recorder players in John Crowne's masque <span class="italic">Calisto</span> (Whitehall, February 1675). In 1677 he composed an unsuccessful <i>com&eacute;die-ballet</i>, <span class="italic">Rare en tout</span>, performed at Whitehall for Charles II's birthday. That October, the poet Rochester wrote to Henry Savile at court, sending Paisible, &#145;the best present I can make at this time&#146;, as the bearer, &#145;whom I beg you to take care of, so that the King may hear his tunes when he is easy and private, because I am sure they will divert him extremely&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Wilmot</span>, 160). Savile replied that Charles had heard Paisible's compositions &#145;with very great delight&#146;  (ibid., 165) but failed to acknowledge the implied sexual present. That same year Paisible and three other French recorder players received a court appointment that was concealed, perhaps because of anti-Catholic sentiment. To the French ambassador, Honor&eacute; Courtin, they played &#145;perfectly&#146;  (Buttrey, 200). Upon James II's accession in 1685 Paisible was openly appointed as a court musician, and on Christmas day 1686 he was given another post as an instrumentalist in James's new Roman Catholic chapel.<br>
<br>About 1676&#150;86 the French <i>philosophe</i> Saint-Evremond organized musical activities at the duchesse de Mazarin's Chelsea home. His biographer, Pierre Des Maizeaux, wrote that he &#145;himself wrote the Idylls, Prologues and other pieces. &hellip; The <i>symphonie</i> he charged with Monsieur Paisible, or some other capable musician&#146;  (Desmaizeaux, 231). <span class="italic">Les noces d'Isabelle</span> features &#145;an old poet&#146;, presumably Saint-Evremond, and &#145;a young musician&#146;, once addressed as Paisible  (<span class="italic">&#338;uvres mesl&eacute;es</span>, 3.155&#150;9). Saint-Evremond described Paisible as a &#145;great and slothful musician &hellip; with manners that savoured of a well-bred man, and expressions which he must have learnt in his little library&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lettres</span>, 2.223). A later assessment of Paisible's character, that he was &#145;likely to forget in the morning what he promised the day before&#146;  (Nagel, 585&#150;6), is due to the German viola da gamba player Ernst Christian Hesse (1711).<br>
<br>On 4 December 1686 Paisible obtained a licence to marry <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7291/', "Mary (Moll) Davis (d. 1708)")</script>, a former singer, actress, and mistress of Charles II. Their marriage attracted ribald comments from court wits. Sir George Etherege wrote: &#145;Mrs Davies has given proof of the great passion she always had for music, and Monsieur Peasible has another bass to thrum than that he played so well upon&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, ed. Bracher, 118). On 16 December 1687 Paisible became a denizen. The following year he was living in St James's Place. When James II fled England about Christmas time, Paisible, being a Catholic, left to serve him in exile at St Germain-en-Laye, near Paris. In 1693 the Paisibles returned to England. Paisible was appointed composer to Prince George of Denmark, the consort of Princess Anne, and after Anne's accession (1702) wrote her annual birthday dance. Upon George's death (1708) he received a court annuity. For the London theatre he wrote act tunes (consisting of an overture and dances played between the acts) for Dorset Garden in 1693, then frequently for Drury Lane from 1694 to 1702. He also performed in public concerts and taught.<br>
<br>By 1702 Paisible belonged to the Drury Lane &#145;band&#146; (a small orchestra). He normally played the bass violin (almost obsolete in England), but for the interval &#145;entertainments&#146; switched to the recorder. He and other members of the band often took part in concerts at York Buildings. In January 1708 he became a cellist at the new opera house, the Queen's Theatre in the Haymarket. The anonymous translator of Fran&ccedil;ois Raguenet's <span class="italic">Paral&egrave;le des italiens et des fran&ccedil;ois</span> (1709) attested that &#145;the famous Mr Paisible&#146; on the recorder &#145;need not give place to any [Masters] at Paris&#146;  (<span class="italic">Comparison</span>, 9). In 1710 the German traveller Zacharias Conrad von Uffenbach, hearing Paisible play the recorder in a concert, claimed that his &#145;equal is not to be found&#146;  (Quarrell and Mare, 66&#150;7). In 1713 Paisible moved to White Hart Yard, off Castle Street, in the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, and he remained there until his death. By 1715 he was playing again at Drury Lane, appearing in interval entertainments in competition with the recorder player John Baston from the Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre. Both there and in concerts Paisible played the recorder and the echo flute or small echo flute (apparently two slightly different recorders fastened together to allow for soft and loud playing).<br>
<br>Paisible died in the first half of August 1721 and was buried in the churchyard of St Martin-in-the-Fields on the 17th. Although he had been known in England as James, his French will preserved the original form of his forename, Jacques. His possessions were valued at &pound;26 2<i>s</i>. 0<i>d</i>. plus 60 guineas in gold.<br>
<br>Paisible's attractive theatrical music, consisting largely of French-style dances, was good enough to have been mistaken for Henry Purcell's. During the 1690s Paisible was one of the leading composers in England integrating elements of the French and Italian styles&#151;in his case, in a rather quixotic manner. His thirteen mixed-style recorder sonatas were probably the most virtuosic music written for the instrument up to that date, giving some idea of the impact he clearly made as a performer. His best-known work is the sombre <span class="italic">The Queen's Farewell</span> (1695) for Mary's funeral, apparently for six-piece oboe band.<br>
