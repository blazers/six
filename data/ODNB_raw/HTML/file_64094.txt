<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Baillie,  George, of Jerviswood</span>  (1664&#150;1738), <span class="occ">landowner and politician</span>, born on 16 March 1664 at Jerviswood Tower, Lanarkshire, was the eldest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1068/', "Robert Baillie (d. 1684)")</script> and of his wife and cousin Rachel Johnston (<i>d</i>. 1697), daughter of the Presbyterian martyr Sir Archibald Johnston, Lord Wariston. &#145;Intended for the practice of the law&#146;  (Murray, 21), Baillie was studying in the Netherlands when news reached him of his father's arrest on charges of high treason arising from the Rye House plot. He returned home to Scotland and witnessed Robert's execution in the Grassmarket of Edinburgh on 24 December 1684. The Jerviswood estates were subsequently confiscated and Baillie fled to the Netherlands, where he joined a band of stalwart Presbyterian exiles, including his father's friend Sir Patrick Hume, whose daughter Grisell (1665&#150;1746) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1061/', "Baillie, Lady Grisell")</script>] he was later to marry (17 September 1691). With Hume's eldest son, Baillie served in the prince of Orange's horse guards &#145;till they were better provided for in the army, which they were before the Revolution&#146;  (Murray, 50). In 1689 he joined the prince's expedition to England, narrowly escaping shipwreck <i>en route</i>.<br>
<br>As a staunch supporter of the revolution's principles, Baillie expected and received preferment, though of a modest nature. He was restored to his estates and served as commissioner of supply for Berwickshire and Lanarkshire (1689) and as a commissioner of militia (1689). Tiresome months of solicitation at court proved more productive after his uncle, James Johnstone, became one of the Scottish secretaries of state in 1692; in the following year Baillie was appointed receiver-general (Scotland) at a salary of &pound;300 p.a. He had been elected as a commissioner to the Scottish parliament in 1691 and represented Berwickshire until 1701; although he headed the poll for Berwickshire in 1702, he chose to represent Lanarkshire, for which he also had a commission (1702&#150;7). Baillie had been politically aligned with Secretary James Johnstone's group from 1692 to 1696, but, on his uncle's dismissal from the secretaryship, became associated with the country party, voting against the government in 1701 on both the standing army and Darien questions. As the Jacobite George Lockhart of Carnwath remarked, Baillie gained a great reputation in King William's time &#145;by standing so stiffly by the interest of his country&#146;  (Lockhart, 95).<br>
<br>At the beginning of Queen Anne's reign Baillie remained part of the opposition and was, with the other members, bizarrely implicated by the duke of Queensberry, the leader of the Scottish administration, in the &#145;Scotch plot&#146;, an alleged Jacobite conspiracy. Early in 1704 the opposition sent him to London, in the company of the earls of Roxburghe and Rothes, to put its views before the queen and to urge the calling of a Scottish parliament. A change in the Scottish ministry shortly followed, with Baillie taking office as treasurer-depute and appointed a member of the Scottish privy council in an administration headed by the marquess of Tweeddale. This government of the &#145;new party&#146;, as the group became known, was not a happy one: Baillie and the rest were castigated as deserters of the country party (although, in fact, they still attempted, perhaps na&iuml;vely, to pursue country party principles in office), Tweeddale was widely considered incompetent, the powerful Scottish magnates were hostile, and the English government was unwilling to allow the new party the patronage powers which might have assured success. Baillie, diligent, principled (he was one of the few politicians brave enough, with the Edinburgh mob in full cry, to attend the meetings of the Scottish privy council during the deliberations on the <i>Worcester</i> affair), and perhaps more astute than most of his colleagues, shared their fate when the new party leaders were dismissed from office (June 1705). It was particularly galling for a man with Baillie's history that his successor as treasurer-depute, the earl of Glasgow, suggested that the main reason for the change in government was so that it would be &#145;thoroughly upon the Revolution bottom&#146;  (Hume Brown, 179).<br>
<br>The ousting of the new party, however, did not drive it to reunite with the opposition. Indeed, Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun's unsuccessful attempt to keep Baillie out of the 1705 parliament sprang entirely from spleen at what he regarded as Baillie's apostasy from the country party. The quarrel verged on farce when Baillie espoused John Law's land bank scheme. This was a project for remedying the dearth of money in Scotland which had much appeal for those who, like him, had, in 1696, backed the Company of Scotland (in which he had an investment of &pound;1000 and of which he was a director) when it attempted to remedy a similar situation by issuing its own bills. Fletcher's insistence that the scheme was yet another plot to enslave the Scottish nation led to a duelling challenge between Fletcher and Lord Roxburghe: it was only with difficulty that Lord Charles Ker and Baillie, the respective seconds, succeeded in bringing about a reconciliation between the principals.<br>
<br>In refusing to rejoin the opposition, the new party hoped to hold the balance in the Scottish parliament. However, the <i>squadrone volante</i>, as it now became known, was ineluctably drawn in a court direction. Baillie's own, somewhat reluctant conversion to the necessity for Scotland's union with England, a court imperative by 1705, can be traced in his correspondence: union was first a potion which had to be drunk, then the lesser of two evils, and finally &#145;our onlie game&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 142, 144, 145). It was the votes of the squadrone which allowed the passage of the union treaty in 1706; the duke of Atholl reportedly asserted that they had &#145;acted like angels&#146; and that the queen owed union to them  (ibid., 174).<br>
<br>With the other squadrone leaders, Baillie now sought a role on the British stage. He represented Berwickshire in the first British parliament and, with the backing of the whigs, became a member of the Board of Trade, surviving several tory purges before being dismissed in 1712. He joined with other Scots in parliament in successfully urging the abolition of the Scottish privy council (1707) and in unsuccessfully resisting the extension of English treason penalties to Scotland (1709). It was thanks to a campaign organized by him and Lockhart that the imposition of new linen duties on Scotland was delayed for a year; he also opposed the malt tax (1713). As the effects of the Union became more apparent, Baillie came to resent the &#145;utmost contempt&#146; with which the Scots were treated, even as he recognized that dissolving the Union (a bill was put forward in 1713) might have &#145;a worse effect and be more fatal to us&#146;  (<span class="italic">Polwarth MSS</span>, 1.12).<br>
<br>A convinced Hanoverian, Baillie welcomed the accession of George I, becoming one of the nine &#145;chief men in place&#146; in the new House of Commons  (<span class="italic">Letters and Works of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu</span>, ed. Lord Warncliffe, 3 vols., 1861, 1.136). He served as a lord of Admiralty (1714&#150;17) and was appointed to the Treasury board formed on Robert Walpole's resignation in 1717. There he remained, retaining his post after Walpole's return to the Treasury in 1721, until 1725, when he was ousted (though with a pension equal to his salary) to satisfy the Argyll interest. He had broken with his long-time friend and <i>squadrone</i> ally the earl of Roxburghe in 1723, correctly observing that Roxburghe's performance as Scottish secretary had reduced Scotland to less weight in the management of affairs than any county in England, and in that year professed himself &#145;quite out of bussiness&#146; and ready to depart public life were it not for his position as MP, from which he finally stepped down in 1734  (<span class="italic">Polwarth MSS</span>, 3.289, 282).<br>
<br>Although lacking the social clout which would have enabled him to scale the heights in Scottish or British politics, and impeded, particularly after the Union, by increasing deafness, Baillie possessed, as Lockhart admitted, a &#145;profound solid judgment&#146; and was &#145;by far the most significant man of all his party, to whom he was a kind of dictator&#146;  (Lockhart, 95). He worked hard to keep the <i>squadrone</i> together, continually urging, though not always successfully, the necessity of acting in concert  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 76, 163). No mere placeman, he was willing to vote against the court, as he did on the Spanish question in 1711, and determined always to act in ways which seemed right to him, in small matters as in large: when he was in the Admiralty he made his children return a present of a parrot from a gentleman who was soliciting something there  (Murray, 8). At the time of the Jacobite rising of 1715 he urged mercy for the participants, despite the unpopularity of such a stance and the despoliation of his own Mellerstain lands. He also advised and assisted the relatives of the rebels. Lockhart thought him &#145;morose, proud, and severe&#146;  (Lockhart, 95), and, indeed, his own and his family's history had given him reason to be so. In private life, however, as Lady Murray's memoir indicates, he was very different, enjoying music, hawking, and hunting, and accompanying his offspring to balls and masquerades.<br>
<br>A devoted husband, Baillie wrote to Lady Grisell by every post during their long periods of separation; not until 1714 did his family move to London. He confided his political secrets only to her, he relied on her substantial managerial capabilities in looking after his Scottish interests, and he conscientiously filled requests for &#145;muslin with Indian flowers&#146; and other items for her and the bairns. Three children were born of the marriage&#151;a son, Robert (<i>b</i>. 1694), died in infancy; Grisell (1692&#150;1759), who married Alexander Murray, son and heir of Sir David Murray of Stanhope, in 1710, with her father's reluctant consent: a legal separation was obtained in 1714; and Rachel (1696&#150;1773), who in 1717 married Charles, Lord Binning (1697&#150;1732), son and heir to the earl of Haddington. When Lord Binning became ill, Baillie accompanied the rest of the family to Naples (1731&#150;3) in an unavailing attempt to improve his health.<br>
<br>Baillie devoted his retirement to his friends and his family, to his books and his prayers; he had for many years been representative elder for the parish of Earlston, in which lies Mellerstain, and he remained a devout Presbyterian to the end. This &#145;honest, serious, religious Man&#146;  (monument) died in Oxford on 6 August 1738, after a brief illness. He was buried in the mausoleum he had ordered to be built in the fields of Mellerstain; his estate passed in liferent to his wife and was eventually inherited by the second son of Lord and Lady Binning.<br>
