<span class="headword">Coombe,  Thomas</span>  (1747&#150;1822), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and American loyalist</span>, was born on 21 October 1747 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Thomas Coombe (<i>c</i>.1720&#150;1799) and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rutter. His father was health officer of the port of Philadelphia, a friend of Benjamin Franklin, and actively interested in natural philosophy. Coombe was baptized in Christ Church, Philadelphia, on 14 November 1747. He attended the College of Philadelphia (subsequently the University of Pennsylvania), where he received an AB in 1766 and an AM in 1768. Valedictorian of his college class, Coombe demonstrated literary ability as an undergraduate by translating some of the Latin poems of his master John Beveridge, which appeared in the latter's <span class="italic">Epistolae familiares</span>, published in Philadelphia in 1765. Coombe travelled to England in 1768, seeking ordination, as there was no bishop in the colonies to perform the rite, and stayed temporarily at the lodgings of his father's friend Benjamin Franklin, at 36 Craven Street, Strand. He was ordained deacon on 11 February 1769, and priest on 21 December 1771 at the Chapel Royal, St James's Palace, by Richard Terrick, bishop of London. In 1771 Coombe was appointed chaplain to Charles Watson-Wentworth, second marquess of Rockingham, whom he served until his return to America the following year to be an assistant minister at Christ Church and at St Peter's, Philadelphia. He was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society on 15 January 1773.<br>
<br>Coombe married, first, Sarah (Sally) Ann Leake (1752?&#150;1778), daughter of Bernard Badger and Susannah Rich&eacute; of Hempstead, Long Island, New York, on 13 May 1773. On 21 May 1774 Sally bore twins, a son, John Rich&eacute; Coombe (<i>d</i>. 12 May 1855), and a daughter. A further son, Henry Coombe, died on 3 October 1776, aged one year; two years later Sally died, on 17 October 1778. Coombe married his second wife, Elizabeth Chassereau (1758&#150;1829), on 8 September 1784 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London; she was the daughter of Fran&ccedil;ois Chassereau and his wife, Honor, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Williams, of London. Three children of this second marriage are identified in Coombe's will: Thomas (1796&#150;1876), Charlotte, and Elizabeth.<br>
<br>Early in his career Coombe distinguished himself as an eloquent preacher. In a sermon delivered on 20 July 1775, a general fast day appointed by the continental congress, he advocated the cause of the colonies. His sermon, which aroused much attention, was printed and received wide circulation in editions published in Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Newport. Like many of his Anglican colleagues Coombe conscientiously believed that his oath of allegiance to king and parliament required at ordination did not permit him to swear to uphold the <span class="roman">Declaration of Independence</span>. At the outbreak of the American War of Independence Coombe and forty other rich and prominent persons were arrested by the executive council of Philadelphia on the charge of having &#145;uniformly evinced a disposition inimical to the cause of America&#146;  (Bronson, 554&#150;7). He was held in the masons' lodge in Philadelphia and sentenced to imprisonment at Staunton, Augusta county, Virginia, in 1777. Many prominent Philadelphians came to his defence and protested the harshness of the decree. Coombe pleaded ill health, which rendered his removal impracticable. After the arrival of the British army in Philadelphia in 1777 he was granted permission to go to New York. Three of the English commissioners who had arrived in New York in 1778 with the intention of settling the dispute between the colonists and England&#151;Frederick Howard, fifth earl of Carlisle, William Eden, later first Baron Auckland, and George W. Johnstone, governor of West Florida&#151;granted Coombe authorization to sail for England in 1779, where he passed the remainder of his life.<br>
<br>Both in Philadelphia and in London, Coombe was recognized as a scholarly, persuasive, and powerful preacher. Josiah Quincy jun. said that one of Coombe's extemporary prayers, &#145;in point of sentiment, propriety of expression, and true sublimity&#146;, excelled anything of that kind that he had ever heard  (J. Quincy, <span class="italic">Memoir of the Life of Josiah Quincy, Junior</span>, 1825, 121). Several of his sermons and addresses were published. He enjoyed the company of many distinguished friends, including Benjamin Franklin, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Samuel Johnson, Oliver Goldsmith, John Jortin, and James Beattie.<br>
<br>After a period of service as chaplain (from 1780) to Lord Carlisle, Coombe accompanied Carlisle upon his appointment as lord lieutenant of Ireland (1780&#150;82) and was soon made his private secretary. Under the eye of his patron Coombe obtained in 1781 the rectory of Donagh-Henry, co. Tyrone, which he later resigned. In the same year he was admitted to the degree of doctor of divinity from Trinity College, Dublin. At the dissolution of the government of Lord North in 1782 he returned to England with Lord Carlisle.<br>
<br>In 1789 Lord Auckland asked Coombe to accompany him to The Hague as chaplain to his embassy, a post which he declined. For many years he served as preacher at the Mayfair Chapel in Curzon Street. In 1794 he was appointed a chaplain to George III. Under the continuing auspices of Carlisle he was preferred to a prebendal stall at Canterbury in 1800. A year later he was presented by the dean and chapter of the cathedral to the vicarage of St Mildred, Tenterden, Kent, a post which he was permitted to resign to his son John in 1806. In 1808 the dean and chapter of Canterbury appointed Coombe rector of the united parishes of St Michael Queenhithe and Trinity the Less, in London, which he served for fourteen years, until his death.<br>
<br>Coombe's claim to the title of poet rests on his publication <span class="italic">The Peasant of Auburn, or, The Emigrant: a Poem</span> (1783). Dedicated to Oliver Goldsmith the work is an imitation of Goldsmith's <span class="italic">Deserted Village</span>; it recounts the unhappy fortunes of the emigrant from &#145;sweet Auburn&#146; when later, on the banks of the Ohio River, his bright hopes darkened to desolation, war, and death. The volume includes a number of shorter poems.<br>
<br>Coombe easily adapted his career and life to London. To his contemporaries he was more of an Englishman than an American, and a clergyman of character and talent rather than a poet. He was an active and outspoken member of the committee for the abolition of the slave trade. Coombe died a wealthy man on 15 August 1822 at his home in Hereford Street, London. His will, proved on 22 August 1822, indicates an estate valued at more than &pound;30,000. He granted to his wife &pound;14,500, the leasehold for the house and stable in Hereford Street, his plate, and his household furniture. To each of his four surviving children he bequeathed &pound;4500; his library of about 300 volumes he divided between his sons John and Thomas. To his son from his first marriage, the Revd John Rich&eacute; Coombe, he bequeathed a gold snuffbox.<br>
