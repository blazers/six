<span class="headword">Handyside,  Eric Charles</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1926), <span class="occ">police officer in India</span>, was a celebrated figure at the time of his death, yet details of his life and background are remarkably sparse. His father was said to have been from Cornwall, and his mother from Russia. No record of his birth has been found. He joined the Indian police in November 1901 and began his career in the Punjab, where he established a formidable reputation for his courage and tenacity, and was promoted superintendent in November 1909. He was awarded the king's police medal in January 1911 for his exploits, having apprehended a dangerous gang of escaped convicts after three days of hard marching in summer heat and with no food. He served in New Delhi for George V's durbar, and moved to become superintendent of police in Multan. After twelve years' service in the Punjab he was given a rousing send-off, with thousands turning out to wish him well.<br>
<br>Handyside's new posting in the North-West Frontier Province was to secure his reputation. He arrived in the province in March 1913 to join the frontier constabulary. Recruited from the local Pathans, the frontier constabulary was established as the final stage of the reorganization of the north-west frontier's defences by the commander-in-chief, Kitchener. Handyside's arrival at the constabulary's headquarters at Dera Ismail Khan coincided with a policy change away from the &#145;outlaw conciliation committees&#146; which allowed law-breakers in British territories on the frontier, who had found sanctuary as outlaws across the border, to return to their homes. This was found to lead to a cycle of repeat banditry; in future a tougher policy was implemented, and the search for outlaws would be more persistent. Handyside's qualities and methods were suited to the new policy, which involved incursions into the raiders' heavily armed villages. His first mission was the successful arrest of some men of the Khudakhel tribe who were offering shelter to criminals and refusing to pay fines. A succession of actions led to the award of a bar to his king's police medal in 1918: &#145;During the four years he has spent in the Frontier Constabulary he has acquired a reputation for fearlessness, tenacity and personal bravery which it would be hard to equal.&#146;<br>
<br>During the Anglo-Afghan War of 1919&#150;21 Handyside defended Gomal, protecting the strategically important Gomal Pass, against a large force of Wazirs and Mahsuds; with only a small detachment of police he held the enemy at bay for three days despite having been wounded at the outset. On the arrival of an army relief force Handyside was reported to have saluted smartly to the brigadier and &#145;with the suspicion of a wink said &#147;This is your job, sir, I am only a civilian&#148;&#146;  (Griffiths, 402). For this feat he was appointed OBE.<br>
<br>In 1921 Handyside was promoted commandant of the frontier constabulary. A sortie he headed in March 1923 to recover a cache of .303 rifles stolen from the police armoury at Kohat by cross-border raiders received publicity as &#145;a tale of daring and well-planned enterprise seldom, if ever, equalled in the annals of frontier raiding and counter-raiding&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 7 March 1923). Handyside and his men, under the cover of darkness, scrambled across mountainous terrain to encircle the suspected raiders' village across the border, backed by artillery on an overlooking vantage point. A search undertaken in the face of the protestations of the village elders revealed the rifles hidden in pits under the houses.<br>
<br>Handyside was killed on 11 April 1926, in a hamlet ten miles from Peshawar, during a routine expedition to capture two outlaws. Handyside led the search, and on dashing across the empty space at the heart of the compound was shot twice and died there. Though a civilian (obituaries emphatically styled him &#145;Mr&#146;) he was buried with full military honours and an RAF flypast.<br>
<br>Handyside's death prompted tributes to his heroism from the provincial government, the government of India, and in Westminster: &#145;Some of his exploits were of epic quality and he himself had become a theme of border legend and song. Even the wild tribesmen against whom he had so often fought shared the widespread grief at his loss&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annual Statement on the Moral and Material Progress of India</span>, 207). The journalist Frank Herbert Brown located him within the traditions of initiative and leadership of the British defenders of the north-west frontier, his exploits showing &#145;that British servants of the Crown in India have not lost the powers of leadership, intrepidity, and personal valour which went in days gone by to the establishment of the <i>pax Britannica</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Observer</span>, 18 April 1926). &#145;Short and stocky in build&#146;  (Curry, 338), he was celebrated as fearless, yet careful in his preparations and in his concern for the lives of his men. Chaotic with paperwork, he was unorthodox in his methods and dress, living a life of &#145;spartan simplicity&#146;  (Elliott, 95) in border forts. Sir John Maffey, chief-commissioner of the North-West Frontier Province, recalled &#145;&#147;Handy&#148; in shorts with Pathan sandals on his feet, a revolver sling and full cartridge belt, a Balaclava cap, a heavy <i>poshtin</i> coat, happy as a schoolboy, hard as nails, and ready to walk for a week on Pathan bread and water&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 20 April 1926). He was credited with an understanding of Pathan traditions and language, and with a chivalrous respect for his notorious outlaw opponents. His compassion was recalled through his habit of paying the owners of itinerant dancing bears to liberate one of their animals for a day, feeding and watering it in what he called &#145;a bear's holiday&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 16 April 1926). A fund in his memory paid for a memorial to him in St John's Church, Peshawar, and a memorial arch next to the police station in the Kohat Pass. The Handyside Memorial Fund in Punjab provides scholarships for the education of the families of those non-gazetted officers who die or are killed while serving.<br>
