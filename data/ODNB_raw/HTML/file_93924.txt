<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Keith,  Kenneth Alexander</span>, Baron Keith of Castleacre  (1916&#150;2004), <span class="occ">merchant banker and industrialist</span>, was born on 30 August 1916 at the Wicken House, Castle Acre, Norfolk, the elder of the two sons of Edward Charles Keith (1877&#150;1972), farmer and natural history author, and his wife, Gertrude May, daughter of William Suffield Telfair of Mauritius. He was educated at Rugby School and then trained with the City chartered accountants Peat, Marwick and Mitchell. Upon the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 he was commissioned in the Welsh Guards and served in north Africa, Italy, France, and Germany and spent time as a prisoner of war. He was mentioned in dispatches and finished the war as a lieutenant-colonel on the intelligence staff at supreme allied headquarters and then spent a year as deputy head of the Foreign Office's political intelligence department.<h2>
<a name="RiseandthecreationofHillSamuel"></a>Rise and the creation of Hill Samuel</h2>In April 1946 Keith joined Philip Hill and Partners, one of a handful of Mayfair-based so-called &#145;West End finance houses&#146;. On 25 April he married Lady Ariel Olivia Winefred Baird (1916/17&#150;2003), daughter of John Lawrence Baird, first Viscount Stonehaven; the couple had one son and one daughter. Philip Ernest Hill, the founder of the eponymous firm, was a tireless, buccaneering financier and company promoter who lived by his motto: &#145;start early and work late&#146;  (<span class="italic">DBB</span>, 3.238). Philip Hill and Partners had been established in 1932 with backing from Eagle Star Insurance, of which Hill was a director from 1929. It specialized in conducting initial public offerings on behalf of new British industrial and commercial companies. As the economy recovered from the slump the firm was instrumental in financing a host of iconic inter-war businesses: the Beecham group, the largest British proprietary medicines company, aircraft manufacturer Hawker Siddeley, Brylcreem, Woolworths, Odeon cinemas, and the Olympia exhibition hall. However, other flotations were more dubious and Hill was regarded with hostility by Montagu Norman, governor of the Bank of England, and the City establishment, as a speculator and market manipulator.<br>
<br>Hill died in 1944 but it is just possible that he met Kenneth Keith, who in many ways was a fitting successor, since he did some work for Philip Hill and Partners as a young accountant just before the war. Keith's entry into the firm came about through his friendship with a fellow prisoner of war, Brian Mountain, whose family controlled Eagle Star. Thus Mountain was able to provide an opening for Keith, at a time when partnerships in financial firms were largely confined to scions of City dynasties. Keith quickly emerged as the post-war driving force at Philip Hill, being appointed managing director in 1951. In an internal memorandum of early 1950 he outlined his strategy of buying up prestigious merchant banks that had fallen on hard times with a view to turning the small, and not wholly reputable, firm into &#145;one of the leading financial institutions of the City&#146; (quoted in Kynaston, 39). His first move, in June 1950, was a merger with Higginson &amp; Co., an estimable but unprofitable City house, and the combined entity, Philip Hill Higginson, took offices in the Square Mile. In 1955 British Shareholders Trust was acquired and incorporated into Philip Hill Investment Trust (established in 1936), and so enhanced the firm's asset management activities. The same year Keith joined the board at Eagle Star, reinforcing that relationship. An establishment acquisition of a different sort was John Colville, diplomat and private secretary to Sir Winston Churchill, who added lustre to the management following Churchill's resignation as prime minister in April 1955. But mostly Keith recruited accountants and lawyers, forging one of the City's most well-qualified&#151;and pushy&#151;merchant banks of the 1950s, along with Warburgs, which did likewise.<br>
<br>Kenneth Keith and Siegmund Warburg were the foremost City revolutionaries of the two decades after the war. Both insisted on professionalism and hard work, and disdained the gentlemanly amateurism, idleness, and incompetence that were commonplace in the old City. According to Paul Ferris, who profiled a set of top European financiers in the late 1960s, Keith and Warburg both shared &#145;the same contempt for inertia&#146;  (Ferris, <span class="italic">Men and Money</span>, 137). Anthony Sampson, who interviewed Keith in 1962, found him &#145;a tough, casual, feet-on-the-desk banker with swept-back grey hair and a brisk way of talking&#146;  (Sampson, <span class="italic">Anatomy</span>, 387). Ferris later described him as &#145;A large man, physically restless behind his desk, as though it might trap him between visitor and window &hellip; he attracted adjectives like &#147;electric&#148; when City journalists wrote about his business coups, as they often did&#146;  (Ferris, <span class="italic">Gentlemen of Fortune</span>, 240). Keith's dynamic, restless, unconventional, hectoring, sometimes bruising manner and conduct meant that he was not to everyone's liking. John Kinross of the Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation (ICFC) (later 3i), who met him in January 1950 just as he was assuming control at Philip Hill, recalled that &#145;none of us took to Keith. It was clear that the possibility of any meaningful business relationship was remote and so it proved to be&#146;  (Kinross, 145).<br>
<br>During the 1950s the assets and profits of Philip Hill Higginson more than quadrupled under Keith's forceful leadership. In summer 1959 the firm was admitted to the Accepting Houses Committee, the City's inner forum whose members enjoyed privileged borrowing rights at the Bank of England. Building up the firm's banking business was the strategic logic for the almost simultaneous takeover of Erlanger, another eminent but commercially becalmed City merchant bank. The combined firm, Philip Hill Higginson Erlanger, undertook three distinct activities&#151;corporate finance, asset management, and banking. This threefold combination of activities became the standard business model of the London merchant banks in the 1960s and 1970s. Other marriages among City firms that achieved the same end at the turn of the 1960s included the creation of Schroder Wagg, Kleinwort Benson, and Lazards' absorption of de Stein.<br>
<br>In 1965 Keith negotiated yet another merger, this time with a major and successful merchant bank, M. Samuel. Hill Samuel, the combined firm, was the largest London merchant bank, fulfilling the goal Keith had set himself a decade and a half earlier. Following the merger the leading executive from the Samuel side, Lord Melchett, was quickly outmanoeuvred by Keith and left the firm, as did others. There was also discontent on the part of First National City Bank of New York, a friendly minority shareholder in M. Samuel whose chairman, James Stillman Rockefeller, expressed his unhappiness to Leslie O'Brien, governor of the Bank of England. O'Brien noted:<blockquote>They thought that Samuels' were their kind of people. They had been somewhat surprised with the link-up with Philip Hill and very displeased with the new attitude which followed that. As Mr Rockefeller put it, this was not the girl we married. Clearly this dissatisfaction centred on Mr Keith who, Mr Rockefeller said, thought more about his own interests than those of his customers.(quoted in Kynaston, 338&#150;9)</blockquote>Soon after, First National City Bank quietly disposed of its shareholding.<br>
<br>The new offices occupied by the swollen combined firm had none of the trappings customary at City merchant banks; they were described by <span class="italic">Management Today</span> as being as &#145;anonymous as a Labour Exchange&#146;  (May 1970). The dour utilitarian building reflected Keith's disdain for the City's gentlemanly traditions and his focus on cost control and the bottom line. The merger and acquisition boom of the second half of the 1960s was good for Hill Samuel and in these years profits rose from &pound;230 million to &pound;440 million. Keith was a long-standing business associate of Charles Clore and his firm acted for Clore in his high-profile bid for Selfridges in 1965 and other acquisitions. In 1967 it orchestrated and won an acrimonious landmark takeover bid by Arnold Weinstock's GEC for Associated Electrical Industries (AEI). But there were reverses too, notably Keith's backing for flamboyant fraudster Bernie Cornfeld, whose mutual fund business Investors Overseas Services collapsed in 1970.<br>
<br>As a member of the Accepting Houses Committee, Keith was notionally part of the City establishment, though, as ever, he tried to make it on his terms. In 1963 Lord Cromer, governor of the Bank of England, asked him to represent the City in discussions with the Treasury about boosting the Square Mile's contribution to the UK's balance of payments. The following year, under Harold Wilson's Labour administration, Keith was appointed to the National Economic Development Council and he became an enthusiast for the establishment of a corporatist entity to represent the City along the lines of the Confederation of British Industry and the Trades Union Congress. This proposal was opposed by most City firms and especially the Bank of England, which saw such a body as a threat to its authority. Cromer's successor as governor of the Bank of England, Sir Leslie O'Brien, even suspected that Keith was trying to establish his own rival City power base. Matters came to a head in 1968 and Keith was forced to back down. The following year he received a knighthood from Wilson's government.<h2>
<a name="Bidforgrowth"></a>Bid for growth</h2>Having created the country's biggest merchant bank, Keith's ambition shifted in the late 1960s to the formation of the City's first full-blooded financial conglomerate. To this end Hill Samuel acquired Lamberts, a leading shipbroker, and in 1969 Noble Lowndes, an innovative pension and life-assurance broker. Then in late June 1970 came the announcement of an agreed merger between Hill Samuel and Metropolitan Estates and Property (MEPC), Britain's second largest property company. &#145;There is a premium on size,&#146; Keith told the press. &#145;The merchant banks are too small and their future lies overseas, where big muscle is needed. A company with a &pound;200m market capitalisation provides a unique springboard.&#146; Sir Charles Hardie, MEPC's chairman, enthused that the joint venture would mean &#145;a sensational change in City structure, creating a unit in international terms of sufficient size to enable the City to make a great impact&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 1 July 1970).<br>
<br>The proposed merger aroused opposition from MEPC's institutional shareholders, who anticipated the depreciation of their investment because of dilution of their prime property assets by a riskier, lower-rated merchant banking business. Moreover, the host of small, specialist merchant banks and stock exchange firms took fright at the prospect of competition from a vastly larger financial conglomerate. City opposition was voiced in an alarmed letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span> from James Scrimgeour, a leading stockbroker, who warned that &#145;separate and individual activities would be submerged in vast corporations generally controlled at the top by a diminishing number of &#147;businesscrats&#148;&#146;  (13 July 1971). The traditional City establishment engineered a rival bid for MEPC from Commercial Union and Keith's attempt to create a financial colossus collapsed.<br>
<br>Keith's belief in scale led him to enter further merger talks with a number of banks in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In the summer of 1969 he held serious discussions with Sir Siegmund Warburg about uniting their firms to create &#145;the most powerful merchant bank on the London stage&#146;  (Fraser, 324). However, opposition from Henry Grunfeld, Warburg's right-hand man, scotched the idea. Then it was Morgan Grenfell's turn to receive an approach, again rebuffed, to the effect that Hill Samuel wanted to merge so that it could take over the management. Around the same time Hill Samuel was itself on the receiving end of an inquiry about a link up from NatWest Bank, but this time it was Keith who recoiled, fearful of the stifling embrace of a bureaucratic clearing bank. In April 1973 an astonished City learned that a merger had been agreed between Hill Samuel and Slater Walker, the brash investment group that had been built up by the controversial financier Jim Slater. With combined assets of &pound;1.5 billion the proposed firm would have towered over the rest of the sector, and <span class="italic">The Times</span> hailed the move as &#145;probably &hellip; the most fascinating City development since the war&#146;  (27 April 1973). However, investors took fright and the shares of both banks plunged. Moreover, Keith and Slater soon fell out and it became plain that it would be impossible for them to work together: &#145;fundamental differences of work-style and personalities&#146; were cited in the press statement announcing the termination of the merger talks  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 20 June).<br>
<br>Keith's frustration at his repeated failure to pull off a deal that would put Hill Samuel in a class apart was exacerbated by the slump in share prices and the sharp downturn in domestic City activity in 1974&#150;5. Euromarket business boomed after the oil price rises of 1973, but Hill Samuel saw no benefit because it was not active in those markets. In fact, Keith admitted that he did not understand the euromarkets and his failure to grasp their significance and potential was arguably his greatest strategic shortcoming. He stood down as chief executive of Hill Samuel in 1976, though remaining non-executive chairman. In 1980, even more convinced that the firm was too small to compete in the global market place, he tried to engineer its acquisition by Merrill Lynch to create a transatlantic financial giant. But the other directors, whom he had not consulted, rejected the deal and Keith resigned as chairman.<br>
<br>Hill Samuel never fully recovered from the downturn of the mid-1970s, and it handled the challenges of the &#145;big bang&#146; deregulation of the London securities industry in the mid-1980s with uncertainty. In 1986 the rudderless bank became &#145;in play&#146; with the accumulation of substantial shareholdings by speculators. In October 1987, following the collapse of a proposed acquisition by Union Bank of Switzerland, Hill Samuel was bought for &pound;777 million by Trustee Savings Bank (TSB), which had recently been floated and was eager to enter investment banking. As it became clear that TSB had overpaid and that Hill Samuel had a poor fit with TSB's retail banking activities, Keith's creation was broken up. Thus the newest and biggest became the first of the major merchant banks to disappear, but it was soon followed by most of the others, including Morgan Grenfell and Warburgs.<h2>
<a name="RollsRoyceandotherinterests"></a>Rolls-Royce and other interests</h2>In 1972 Keith accepted an invitation from Edward Heath's Conservative government to become chairman of aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce, following its financial collapse in 1971 and controversial nationalization. Keith relished the role and oversaw the completion of the crucial RB211 engine and the restoration of morale. He became an effective high-level salesman for the company, especially in the United States. Following the return of a Labour administration in 1974, he clashed bitterly with the National Enterprise Board, which he once called a &#145;bureaucratic contraceptive&#146;, and with the secretary of state for industry, Tony Benn, who recorded in his diary that Keith spoke like &#145;the most arrogant right-wing Tory boss&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 4 Sept 2004). Keith retired as chairman in 1980 and was rewarded with a life peerage, as Baron Keith of Castleacre, by Margaret Thatcher, the new Conservative prime minister. Keith had many other business interests. In the 1980s he was non-executive chairman of Beecham group and Standard Telephones and Cables (STC). At various times over his long career he was a director of British European Airways, Eagle Star Insurance, Times Newspapers, National Provincial Bank, and the Bank of Nova Scotia. Other activities included serving as a governor of the National Institute for Social and Economic Research and of Manchester Business School.<br>
<br>A contentious and controversial City figure for four decades, Keith's business career came to an end in 1989 when he stepped down as chairman of STC. In retirement he found time to serve as president of the Royal Norfolk Agricultural Association, the British Standards Institution, and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, and to pursue his pastimes which he named as farming, shooting, and golf. After divorce from his first wife in 1958 he married, on 22 June 1962, the 44-year-old (Nancy) Mary Raye Hayward (<i>d</i>. 1990), daughter of Edward Gross, banker&#151;from whom he was divorced in 1972&#151;and on 1 August 1973, as his third wife, the 54-year-old Marieluz Muffet (Marie) Hanbury (<i>d</i>. 2001), daughter of Denniston Webster, naval officer. Keith fleetingly re-entered public view on 2 February 2002 when he married the 79-year-old interior designer Penelope Ann de Lazlo, daughter of Gerald Steele. He died from pneumonia on 1 September 2004 at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, King's Lynn, Norfolk. He was survived by his fourth wife and his two children, and left an estate valued for probate purposes at over &pound;23 million.<br>
