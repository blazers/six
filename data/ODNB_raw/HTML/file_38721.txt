<span class="headword">Connell,  James <span class="st"> [Jim]</span></span>  (1852&#150;1929), <span class="occ">socialist and writer of The Red Flag</span>, was born on 27 March 1852 in McCormack's Yard, Kilskyre, Crossakiel, co. Meath, Ireland, the eldest of thirteen children born to Thomas Connell, farm labourer, and his wife, Ann Shaw. It is likely that he was born O'Connell, as other family members, including his brother Canon O'Connell of Scarborough, carried this version of the name. Biographical details of his parents and siblings are scarce, but a brother was known to have been active in the Irish Bakers', Confectioners' and Allied Workers' Amalgamated Union.<br>
<br>Connell's father moved his family to Birr, King's county, in 1862, where he worked as a groom or gamekeeper for the earl of Rosse. James acquired a love of the land, developing a lifelong interest in poaching and in land agitation. In 1870 he moved to Dublin and worked as a docker. Here he fell under the influence of the socialist John Lange (or Laing), and debated theoretical matters on Sunday rambles with the Free Literary Union. Here he met, among others, Fred Ryan, pioneer socialist and later secretary of the Socialist Party of Ireland. In January 1875 he emigrated to London, where he quickly became involved in socialist and Irish nationalist politics. He married an English woman, Catherine Angier, in Poplar, London, on 2 September 1882; they had one child, Norah, and separated when she was thirteen.<br>
<br>Connell's first political activity was in the Irish Republican Brotherhood, being sworn in at Birr in 1870. He also claimed to have founded the first London branch of the National Land League of Great Britain in Poplar in 1879 and to have served on its executive. The league was, in fact, inaugurated on 25 March 1881 under the presidency of Justin McCarthy, with the intention of informing British workers about the Irish land question and their &#145;community of interests&#146; with Irish tenant farmers. Connell claimed original membership of the Social Democratic Federation (SDF), remaining active for ten years, although he &#145;never cared for the management&#146;. He was certainly an associate of H. M. Hyndman, and wrote for <span class="italic">Justice</span>, the SDF party organ, on a regular basis. In September 1890 he stood unsuccessfully for the SDF in Finsbury, failing to attract the Irish vote, which went to the Liberal, and being attacked by T. P. O'Connor's <span class="italic">Star</span>. Later he became a member of the Independent Labour Party. In 1888 he was named before the commission on Parnellism and crime as an &#145;advocate of treason, sedition, assassination and violence&#146;  (Boyd, <span class="italic">Irish Trade Unions</span>, 58). Long political activity gave him contact with nearly all the leading trade union and labour movement figures of his day, many regularly visiting him to enjoy his lively company and gift for conversation.<br>
<br>Connell's source of income is unclear: he had various jobs, including some journalism, and had a regular entry in the <span class="italic">Labour Yearbook</span> as a speaker on socialism, Darwinism, philosophy, and the game laws. Francis Williams recalled Connell's famous discourse on evolution, entitled &#145;From protoplasm to man&#146;, being so erudite that &#145;he was never known in the course of a two hours' talk to get beyond the introduction&#146;  (Williams, 103). From 1909 until his death he was secretary of the Workingmen's Legal Aid Society, based in Chancery Lane, London, providing advice on compensation and other claims. He was well known in Fleet Street, and was visited in his favourite haunt, the Golden Cross in the Strand, by many trade union and Labour leaders. He was 6 feet 1, and wore a black sombrero, a flowing Inverness cape, and bright red scarf; his theatrical manner led many to think he was a Shakespearian actor. He successfully published a series of pamphlets: <span class="italic">Brothers at Last: a Centenary Appeal to Celt and Saxon</span>; <span class="italic">Socialism and the Survival of the Fittest</span> (3rd edn, 1908); <span class="italic">The Truth about the Game Laws</span> (which was published by the Humanitarian League despite their objections to his trapping and poaching, which latter once resulted in Connell being fined in Croydon court); and <span class="italic">Confessions of a Poacher</span> (1901). This last sold 80,000 copies in several editions by C. A. Pearson, having first appeared in serial form in <span class="italic">Titbits</span>. He always kept dogs and was inseparable from his favourite lurcher, Nellie, his companion on frequent walks and poaching expeditions.<br>
<br>In the Christmas issue of <span class="italic">Justice</span> in 1889 Harry Quelch published Connell's song &#145;The Red Flag&#146;. It was written, he claimed, on a fifteen-minute train journey from Charing Cross to New Cross, and was intended to raise working-class morale and as a celebration of the London dock strike. It was inspired by Connell's knowledge of and commitment to international working-class struggle, as the verses attest. Originally set to the popular air &#145;The White Cockade&#146;, Adolphe Smythe Headingley in 1895 rearranged it to the tune &#145;Maryland&#146;, or &#145;Der Tannenbaum&#146;, with which tune it was principally sung thereafter. Connell hated the change, and George Bernard Shaw dismissed the new air as being like &#145;a funeral dirge to the eels&#146;  (Boyd, &#145;In search of Jim Connell&#146;). Labour Party leader James Ramsay MacDonald liked neither the song nor its author, and in 1925 the <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span> held a competition with a &pound;50 prize to find a new, better Labour anthem. Judged by Hugh Roberton, founder of the Glasgow Orpheus Choir, and John McCormack, the Irish tenor, over 300 entries failed to produce a winner. Connell was delighted. Although Connell makes no reference to it, a poem &#145;The Red Flag&#146; by the Chartist poet Alfred Fennell, first published in the <span class="italic">Red Republican</span> in 1850, may have provided the original inspiration. Connell's &#145;Red Flag&#146; was sung at the conclusion of Labour Party and Trades Union Congress conferences, and raised the rafters of the House of Commons when sung by the 393 victorious Labour MPs after the 1945 general election.<br>
<br>Connell wrote many other songs and poems published in the left-wing press. He was on the staff of Keir Hardie's <span class="italic">Labour Leader</span>, where his material regularly appeared. His work also appeared in Ireland: James Larkin published &#145;The Blackleg&#146; in the <span class="italic">Irish Worker</span> on 22 November 1913, and the <span class="italic">Voice of Labour</span> printed &#145;The Minor&#146; on 16 August 1918. A collection, <span class="italic">Red Flag Rhymes</span> (n.d.), was republished in several editions. &#145;The Red Flag&#146; is the only generally surviving Connell piece, and appears as a standard entry in all socialist song collections. He retained an interest in Irish affairs, actively generating support in Britain for the Dublin workers during the 1913 lock-out and returning for occasional meetings, such as that of the Ballinlough Land Back to the People Committee at Crossakiel on 30 August 1918.<br>
<br>Connell died at 390 High Street, Catford, Lewisham, on 8 February 1929 from bronchitis. He was cremated on 14 February at Golders Green crematorium. The <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span> obituary (9 February 1929) noted that he was &#145;essentially a man of the people&#146;, and that he described himself as &#145;educated under a hedge for a few weeks&#146; and as a &#145;sheep farmer, dock labourer, navvy, railwayman, draper, lawyer of a sort and all the time a poacher&#146;. Veteran labour leader Tom Mann conducted the secular funeral proceedings, and he told the crowd Connell was &#145;no meek and mild platitudinarian&#146; and that his songs &#145;inspired thousands&#151;possibly millions&#146;. Connell departed to the strains of &#145;The Red Flag&#146;, sung to both his original and the adopted airs. In 1989 Gordon Brown MP unveiled a plaque in Stondon Park, Forest Hill, London&#151;Connell's last address&#151;as Lewisham borough council commemorated the sixtieth anniversary of Connell's death, and in 1997 a permanent memorial was erected in his birthplace under the aegis of the Kells Heritage Committee.<br>
