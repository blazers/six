<span class="headword">Malcom <span class="st"> [Malcolm]</span>,  Andrew George</span>  (1782&#150;1823), <span class="occ">minister of the Presbyterian General Synod of Ulster and hymn writer</span>, was born at Hill Hall House, co. Down, on 15 September 1782. He was the second son of James Malcolm (<i>d</i>. 3 Oct 1805), who was ordained minister of Drumbo, co. Down, on 24 December 1764, in succession to his uncle, Andrew Malcom (<i>d</i>. 2 March 1763). His mother was Fanny, third daughter of Andrew Kennedy, Presbyterian minister of Mourne, co. Down. He was educated at Glasgow University, where he graduated MA. On 11 March 1807 he was ordained by Bangor presbytery as minister of Dunmurry, co. Antrim. He was not related to his predecessor at Dunmurry, John Malcome. He resigned from Dunmurry on 11 September 1808, and was installed on 14 March 1809 as minister of the First Newry Presbyterian Congregation in co. Down. Through his mother he was the great-grandson of George Lang (<i>d</i>. 25 Jan 1702), the first Presbyterian minister of Newry. Malcom's ministry at Newry was one of marked success, and he was an influential leader of educational and charitable movements in the town. He was one of the founders in 1813 of the <span class="italic">Newry Magazine</span> and he frequently contributed to it. He married Eleanor Hunter (<i>d</i>. 22 March 1854); they had five sons and two daughters. His children reverted to what they believed to be the original spelling of his surname&#151;Malcolm. His eldest son, James Malcolm (1811&#150;1855), was a Unitarian minister in Ireland and England. His fourth son, Andrew George Malcolm MD (1818&#150;1857), was physician to the Royal Hospital, Belfast.<br>
<br>Although his theology was Arian, Malcom never became involved in controversies with orthodox colleagues. Early in 1820 he received the degree of DD from Glasgow. On 27 June 1820 he was elected moderator of the General Synod of Ulster. On 28 June 1821 the general synod approved an exposition of the principles of Presbyterianism from his pen, and ordered it to be prefixed as an introduction to their forthcoming code of discipline. This order was not carried out, the introduction being set aside in committee as it was considered by the orthodox members of the synod to be somewhat unsound. Malcom died of fever at Newry on 12 January 1823, and was buried in the First Newry Presbyterian graveyard; his wife survived him.<br>
<br>Malcom was best known during the nineteenth century as a hymn writer. He published <span class="italic">A Collection of Psalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs</span> (1811) which contained 405 hymns, twenty-three of them being by Malcom himself, and was for a long time the most considerable collection published in connection with Irish Presbyterianism. Many of Malcom's own hymns are of real merit; six were retained in <span class="italic">Hymns for Christian Worship</span> (1886), the authorized hymnal of non-subscribing Presbyterians.<br>
