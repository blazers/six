<span class="headword">Carter,  Henry Vandyke</span>  (1831&#150;1897), <span class="occ">epidemiologist</span>, was born on 22 May 1831 in Hull, the son of Henry Barlow Carter (1803&#150;1867), a well-known artist; nothing is known of his mother. His brother, Joseph Newington Carter (1835&#150;1871), was also an artist, and Henry showed some talent in this area himself but was inclined from an early age towards the study of science. After leaving Hull grammar school, where he was instructed in science by his uncle John Sollitt, Carter studied at St George's Hospital, London, and shortly afterwards, in 1852, he was admitted a member of the Royal College of Surgeons and a licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries. Four years later he graduated MD at the University of London. In London he collaborated with Henry Gray on the latter's <span class="italic">Anatomy: Descriptive and Surgical</span> (1858), jointly undertaking many dissections, and providing the illustrations. In 1858 he joined the Indian Medical Service as an assistant surgeon.<br>
<br>Carter joined the Bombay establishment and spent most of his career in the city and its environs. His scientific interests marked him out from most of his colleagues, and he was soon appointed professor of anatomy and physiology at Grant Medical College; he was later to become its principal. During his time in Bombay he devoted himself to a number of schemes for medical reform, including one which aimed at appointing honorary physicians and surgeons to the Jamsetji Jijibhai Hospital&#151;a charitable institution founded by the Parsi philanthropist of that name. Carter was also instrumental in establishing, in 1884, a course for women doctors at Grant Medical College and in endowing a lectureship in physiology on the occasion of his retirement.<br>
<br>The scientific work for which Carter is chiefly remembered is his research on leprosy and &#145;spirillum fever&#146;. Research into the latter began during the famine years of 1876&#150;80, when large numbers of starving people flooded into Bombay from the surrounding countryside in search of food and work. A disease broke out among them which Carter identified as a form of relapsing fever. His research was published in 1882 under the title of <span class="italic">Spirillum Fever&#151;Synonyms, Famine, or Relapsing Fever&#151;as Seen in Western India</span>, winning him the British Medical Association's Stewart pathological prize.<br>
<br>Carter's work on leprosy did not involve laboratory or clinical research but rather a comparison of leprosy in a number of different contexts. His first publication on the subject came in 1874, with his <span class="italic">Report on Leprosy and Leper Asylums in Norway, with Reference to India</span>. This followed a visit to Norway&#151;paid for by the government of India&#151;in which Carter attempted to ascertain whether the leprosy identified in Norway was the same disease as that found in India, and what measures might be useful in the treatment and prevention of the disease. Carter concluded that the leprosies of Norway and India were the same disease and that leper asylums like those in Norway should be established in India. As he made clear in his book <span class="italic">On Leprosy and Elephantiasis</span> (1874), he thought that leprosy was primarily a hereditary disease and that it might be eradicated if lepers were prevented from having children. He therefore recommended that, if asylums were to be established, a policy of sexual segregation should be enforced.<br>
<br>By the 1880s, however, Carter had changed his mind about the way in which leprosy was spread. The gradual acceptance of G. H. A. Hansen's claim to have discovered the bacillus causing leprosy in 1874, together with the discovery of the micro-organisms causing other diseases, led Carter to place more emphasis on contagion than on heredity, believing that the disease might be spread in a similar manner to tuberculosis. In his earlier work he had been prepared to acknowledge that contagion might play some role in the spread of the disease but had stated that there was no conclusive evidence for this. Carter's conversion to the contagion theory served only to strengthen his advocacy of leper asylums. Working with other Europeans, who were concerned about the number of vagrant lepers congregating in the centre of Bombay, and with a number of Parsi philanthropists, Carter persuaded the government to establish a number of leper asylums in the region and, in 1882, to permit the passage of by-laws pronouncing the congregation of lepers to be a sanitary threat.<br>
<br>The prominent part played by Carter in the campaign for leper asylums in Bombay, and his other philanthropic and scientific achievements, led to his being promoted to the rank of deputy surgeon-general in the Indian Medical Service. He also became an honorary surgeon to Queen Victoria. After leaving India, Carter retired to his native East Riding of Yorkshire. He died at his address, 2 Belgrave Crescent, Scarborough, on 4 May 1897.<br>
