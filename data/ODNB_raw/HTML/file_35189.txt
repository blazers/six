<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Nathan, Sir  Matthew</span>  (1862&#150;1939), <span class="occ">civil servant and colonial governor</span>, was born in Paddington, London, on 3 January 1862, the second son of Jonah Nathan and his second wife, Miriam, daughter of Lewis Jacobs. His father descended from Jewish immigrants from Dessau and was a partner in a firm manufacturing paper goods. Nathan was brought up in west London and educated by private tutors. Encouraged by his mother he competed successfully in examinations and entered the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, in 1878, graduating first in his class with prizes, and was commissioned as a subaltern in 1880 at the School of Military Engineering, Chatham, passing out as a lieutenant of the Royal Engineers. He was selected by his former commandant, Colonel Andrew Clarke, an inspector-general at the War Office, to prepare plans for colonial fortifications. His Whitehall base and influential contacts with members of the colonial defence committee resulted in a tour of Sierra Leone in 1883 to prepare defences; secondment to General Wolseley's Sudan expedition in 1884&#150;5; three years as a fortification specialist in India and Burma; and a posting on a punitive expedition on the north-east frontier which earned him a service medal and promotion to captain. In 1895 he was appointed secretary to the colonial defence committee.<br>
<br>In 1898 with the rank of major Nathan was sent by the Colonial Office as interim administrator to Sierra Leone, following a &#145;hut tax&#146; rebellion. He upheld direct taxation in the colony and protectorate, put down a riot in Freetown, and pushed through building and health regulations. At the end of 1899 he was back in the War Office with a sound reputation. Accordingly, Joseph Chamberlain offered him the governorship of the Gold Coast in July 1900 with orders to re-establish control over Asante. He refrained from extracting tribute from the reconquered states, but he did not restore the exiled Asantehene. He restructured Asante and the southern colony into provinces and districts under commissioners and stipended chiefs, as a measure of decentralization, and kept to direct military rule in the northern protectorate. Relations with commercial and mining representatives were improved by gold claims registration and completion of a railway to Kumasi, but Nathan encountered Aborigines' Rights Protection Society opposition to land purchases and destooling chiefs.<br>
<br>By 1904 his good standing earned Nathan the first-class governorship of Hong Kong, where he moved with caution, avoiding offence to Peking (Beijing) from the local press and supporting a concession for the Kowloon&#150;Canton (Guangzhou) railway construction in the face of foreign competition. Despite this success, he was transferred in 1907 to Natal where he was caught between liberal policies and pressures from responsible government politicians for extension of martial law and the execution of Zulu rebels. Agreeing under protest to Natal ministers' demands, he kept his reputation for coolness under political fire and came to agree with settler views concerning racial segregation and the Indian franchise. Nathan can be counted as one of the midwives of the South African <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> by encouraging Natal's inclusion and by his support for entrenched clauses safeguarding the South African protectorates.<br>
<br>Unable to secure another governorship, Nathan became secretary to the General Post Office in 1909 and chairman of the Board of Inland Revenue in 1911. A lifelong Liberal, he was introduced to Herbert and Margot Asquith and their circle. Asquith and Lloyd George picked him as under-secretary for Ireland in July 1914, where he played a dutiful second to the secretary, Augustine Birrell, and reluctant confidant to Lord Lieutenant Wimborne. He supported the Liberal policy of conciliating Irish parliamentary nationalists and opposed Irish military conscription. But he failed to foresee the Easter rising of 1916, a responsibility he shared with Birrell and Wimborne. Resigning along with his superiors he returned briefly to the Royal Engineers and then acted as secretary of the Ministry of Pensions in 1919. From there he was sent by Lord Milner as governor to Queensland in 1920&#150;25, to conciliate a Labor government which swamped the legislative council with its nominees, moved to abolish it in 1921, and threatened the independence of the judiciary. Nathan reported on this spectacle, but refrained from urging disallowance of government bills, sponsoring instead research on the Great Barrier Reef and serving as chancellor of the University of Queensland from 1922 to 1926.<br>
<br>In retirement Nathan served on the special commission on the constitution of Ceylon in 1927&#150;8, and he was chairman of the colonial secretary's advisory committee on rubber from 1926 to 1928. He was appointed CMG in 1899, KCMG in 1902, and GCMG in 1908. Settling in West Coker he was high sheriff of Somerset in 1934 and devoted himself to the study of local history. He died at his home, the Manor House, West Coker, on 18 April 1939 and was buried in the Jewish cemetery of Willesden, London. A careful imperial broker rather than an innovator, Nathan survived the change from civil service promotion by patronage to selection by examination, as an outsider who became a professional administrator. Not averse to the companionship and affection of women, he remained a confirmed bachelor.<br>
