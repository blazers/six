<span class="headword">Borton, Sir  Arthur</span>  (1814&#150;1893), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 20 January 1814 at Blofield, near Norwich, the youngest son of John Drew Borton (1769&#150;1847), rector of Blofield, and of his wife, Louisa, daughter of the Revd Thomas Carthew of Woodbridge, Suffolk. Educated at Eton College, he received a commission as ensign in the 9th (East Norfolk) regiment on 13 July 1832; he became lieutenant-colonel on 10 June 1853, colonel on 28 November 1854, major-general on 1 January 1868, lieutenant-general on 19 October 1875, colonel of the 1st battalion of the West India regiment on 22 May 1876, and general on 4 December 1877, and was transferred to the colonelcy of the Norfolk regiment on 17 October 1889.<br>
<br>Borton joined his regiment in Ireland accompanying it to Mauritius in 1833 and on to India in 1835. He came home in 1838 to study in the senior department of the Royal Military College, and obtained a certificate in November 1839. After his return to India he served with his regiment in Afghanistan under Major-General George Pollock in 1842. He took part in forcing the Khyber Pass on 5 April, when the 9th was broken into detachments which had the honour of leading the columns of attack; he was also engaged in the victory over Muhammad Akbar Khan at the Tezin Pass and the Haft Kotal on 13 September, when, at the head of a party of the 9th, he made a gallant charge. After the force's arrival at Kabul on 15 September he accompanied the column under Major-General John McCaskill into Kohistan, and took part in the assault and capture of the strongly fortified town of Istalif on 29 September. Borton returned to India in October with his regiment, which formed part of the rear-guard and was involved in some fighting in the passes.<br>
<br>Borton served with his regiment in the 5th brigade of the 3rd infantry division in the Sutlej campaign of 1845&#150;6, and was present at Mudki on 18 December 1845, and at Ferozeshahr on 21 and 22 December. In this he succeeded to the command of his regiment when Lieutenant-Colonel A. B. Taylor was killed, and was himself very severely wounded in the right elbow (he never recovered the complete use of his arm). For his services in this campaign he received the brevet of major and a pension for his wound.<br>
<br>The 9th returned home in 1847, and Borton served with the regiment at Winchester until the end of 1848, and during the next six years in Ireland, succeeding to the command on 10 June 1853. He embarked with the regiment for Malta on 18 February 1854, and went on with it to the Crimea on 19 November, where he commanded it at the siege of Sevastopol. He led the regiment in the assault on the Redan by the column under Major-General Eyre on 18 June 1855 and was mentioned in dispatches. He was promoted colonel in the army on 17 July, and made a CB, military division, on 27 July. At the end of the war he received the order of the Mejidiye (third class) and the L&eacute;gion d'honneur (fifth class). He was also awarded a good service pension.<br>
<br>From the Crimea, Borton took his regiment to Canada in 1856, and brought it home in November of the following year. On 1 March 1865 he was appointed a colonel on the staff to command the troops at Colchester. On 1 April 1866 he was given the command of the infantry brigade at the Curragh, Ireland, with the rank of brigadier-general, until his promotion to major-general on 1 January 1868. On 9 September 1870 Borton was appointed to the command of the Mysore division of the Madras army, which he held for five years. He was promoted to KCB, military division, on 2 June 1877, and on 13 May 1878 was appointed governor and commander-in-chief at Malta. He was made a GCMG on 28 May 1880, and on relinquishing the government of Malta was made GCB, on 24 May 1884.<br>
<br>Borton married, on 9 April 1850, at Drumbanagher, co. Armagh, Caroline Mary Georgina (who survived him), daughter of the Revd John Forbes Close, rector of Mourne, co. Down, and of his first wife, Mary Sophia Brownlow, sister of the first Lord Lurgan. They had two sons: Arthur Close, lieutenant-colonel 13th Somerset (Prince Albert's) light infantry, and Charles Edward, major 9th Norfolk regiment, who served in the Second Anglo-Afghan War. Borton died on 7 September 1893 at his residence, 105 Eaton Place, London, and was buried on 9 September at Hunton, near Maidstone, Kent.<br>
