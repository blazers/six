<span class="headword">McBride,  (Sara) Vonla Adair</span>  (1921&#150;2003), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 20 January 1921 at Ballygarvey, co. Antrim, the elder daughter of Andrew Stewart McBride, farmer and miller, and his wife, Agnes, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Martin. She was educated at Ballymena Academy and Trinity College, Dublin, where she graduated with honours in modern literature in 1942. After teaching for some years at Ballymena and subsequently at Gardenhurst School, Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, she decided at the age of twenty-eight to apply for a direct entry commission in the Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS), and was accepted in 1949 as a personnel selection officer. This was a new specialization for career members of the WRNS; the task of interviewing new entrants to the naval service to discover their aptitudes and potential had previously been carried out by officers only in the context of wartime duties. McBride quickly made her mark as a perceptive and brisk assessor and continued in this specialization for several years, being promoted second officer in the process. Her final appointment in this rank was as staff officer to the London division of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve; this considerably broadened her horizons and allowed her to move easily into the higher ranks, which beckoned with early promotion to first officer in 1958. She then commanded WRNS units in five different establishments, four of them naval air stations, where she came into contact with, and was responsible for the welfare and organization of, Wrens from a very wide spread of specializations and skills.<br>
<br>McBride's success in these posts led to a key appointment as first officer training at the new entry establishment, HMS <i>Dauntless</i> at Burghfield near Reading. Promoted chief officer in 1964, she went on to an even more important job as officer in charge of the WRNS officer training unit at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich. There she wrote her only full-length book, <span class="italic">Never at Sea</span> (1966). This was a volume in the <span class="roman">My Life and My Work</span> series for <span class="roman">Educational Explorers</span>, books designed to help young people choose a career. But McBride's book was much more than a straightforward description of work; her character, interests, and tastes, as well as her humour and resilience, came through strongly.<br>
<br>In 1967 McBride moved on to her first appointment in the Ministry of Defence, where she remained for five years, first in the directorate of naval manning and then as deputy director of WRNS. She then became command WRNS officer to the flag officer, naval air command, being promoted superintendent in 1973 and moving on to command HMS <i>Dauntless</i>. In 1975 she became command WRNS officer for the whole of the naval home command, and in 1976, as commandant, was appointed director of WRNS, the highest WRNS post in the naval service. Even though her progress through the ranks had been rapid, her relatively late entry to the service made her age an obstacle, but a sensible change in the regulations ensured that she could take up the post for which she was so clearly fitted.<br>
<br>McBride's time as director was marked by a steady expansion of the scope of duties and opportunity for members of the WRNS, and notably for their coming under the <span class="roman">Naval Discipline Act</span> where previously they had been subject only to relatively informal regulation that meant, for example, that they could leave the service without permission in circumstances which, for a male rating, would have brought a charge of desertion. She did not, however, press for female service at sea nor for full integration of the WRNS into the Royal Navy. These were both to occur during the next decade and a half, and McBride probably foresaw them, but she did not hurry them.<br>
<br>McBride was appointed CB on her retirement in 1979 and, already a freeman of the City of London, became a director of the London region of Lloyd's Bank. She became a liveryman of the Shipwrights' Company in 1983, the first woman to be so appointed, and her charitable work included vice-presidency of the Ex-Servicemen's Mental Welfare Society, the Officers' Pensions Society, and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.<br>
<br>Vonla McBride never married but always remained a strongly feminine person. She was known for her charm and wit, qualities that came to the fore in an amateur acting career of considerable accomplishment and in sparkling performances as an after dinner speaker. She had the rare gift of personal involvement with every individual with whom she came in contact. But behind these attributes lay a keen intellect and great administrative skill that served the WRNS, and the nation, well. She died at Ashley Grange nursing home, Lode Hill, Downton, near Salisbury, on 2 August 2003, following a stroke.<br>
