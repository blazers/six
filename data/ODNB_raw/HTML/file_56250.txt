<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Walsh,  Adela Constantia Mary  Pankhurst</span>  (1885&#150;1961), <span class="occ">suffragette and pacifist</span>, was born on 19 June 1885 at Chorlton upon Medlock, Manchester, Lancashire, the fourth of five children and the third and youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/93722/', "Richard Marsden Pankhurst (1835/6&#150;1898)")</script>, barrister, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35376/', "Emmeline Pankhurst, n&#233;e Goulden (1858&#150;1928)")</script>, suffragette leader. In 1888 Richard Pankhurst, seeking a parliamentary career, moved his family to 8 Russell Square, Bloomsbury, London, where Adela received her early education. The Pankhursts returned to Manchester in 1893, to 4 Buckingham Crescent, and Adela and her sisters, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35375/', "Christabel Pankhurst")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37833/', "Sylvia Pankhurst")</script>, were enrolled at Manchester Girls High School. After Richard Pankhurst's death in 1898, the family, in reduced circumstances, moved to 62 Nelson Street. Adela left school at sixteen after a severe illness, and helped in her mother's fancy goods shop. At seventeen she became a pupil-teacher in a working-class suburb of Manchester.<br>
<br>A child apart, fragile physically from birth, Adela Pankhurst developed a strong will and her own ideas, becoming secretly a believer in Jesus in spite of her father's rigid opposition to religion. At seventeen, after a traumatic visit to Chorlton workhouse, she was drawn to a vague but passionate Christian socialism, and began to help her mother in her work for women's suffrage and the Independent Labour Party.<br>
<br>At eighteen Adela became the youngest of the early members of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) formed by her mother in October 1903, and her enthusiastic campaigning led to arrests and prison terms. After a month in Holloway gaol, following the riot at the House of Commons in October 1906, Adela left teaching to work full-time for the WSPU, mainly in the north of England or Scotland, speaking, writing, and organizing in testing conditions. She was prominent in the rowdy and successful suffragette by-election campaigns of 1907 and 1908. But by 1910 Adela's criticism of the increasingly militant tactics of Christabel's leadership of the WSPU led to conflict with her mother. Christabel, firmly concentrated on the women's vote issue, saw Adela &#145;as a very black sheep &hellip; because of the warmth of her Socialism&#146;, as the middle sister, Sylvia, artist and socialist, noted in her memoir, <span class="italic">The Suffragette Movement</span>  (E.S. Pankhurst, 367). &#145;One of Adela is too many&#146;, said Christabel  (ibid., 384).<br>
<br>Following a severe breakdown in health in 1912 Adela Pankhurst agreed to withdraw from campaigning, to take a course, paid for by her mother, at Studley Horticultural College, Warwickshire. After graduating she escaped (from an arduous gardening job near Bath) to Switzerland, in the summer of 1913, as governess to the children of feminist Helen Archdale. But she was still seen as dangerously divisive and after a final painful interview with her mother in Paris in January, Adela agreed to sail for Australia on 2 February 1914. She never saw England or her family again.<br>
<br>Partly because of this sudden disappearance, Adela Pankhurst has received little attention in British suffragist history, though her many admirers included Rebecca West, and her memoirs, &#145;Looking backwards&#146;  (in <span class="italic">Stead's Review</span>, Melbourne, 1928&#150;30) are illuminating. Always impetuous and restless, she managed in Australia to offend communists, socialists, trade unionists, patriots, feminists, nationalists, imperialists, and conservatives as she zigzagged from left to right, denigrated as a renegade by the left, an eccentric by the right. Yet, brimming with Pankhurst self-belief and a na&iuml;ve, Joan of Arc sense of mission, she showed enormous energy and will, as well as flashes of insight and a talent for charismatic leadership, as for three decades she struggled to have her say on social, economic, and foreign policy, at a time when few women featured in public life in Australia.<br>
<br>After arriving in Melbourne on 27 March 1914, Adela Pankhurst worked for the women's movement with the prominent Australian feminist Vida Goldstein. An ardent pacifist since the South African War, she became a leading speaker for the Women's Peace Army when the First World War broke out, travelling widely in Australia and New Zealand.<br>
<br>Adela Pankhurst's journalism for the <span class="italic">Australian Woman Voter</span> and <span class="italic">The Socialist</span> and her popular anti-war polemic, <span class="italic">Put Up the Sword</span> (1915), brought her under the notice of military intelligence and into conflict with Prime Minister W. M. Hughes. Late in 1916 she left the Goldstein group unexpectedly to work for the Victorian Socialist Party. Only 4 feet 11 inches tall, the tiny, fair-haired, grey-eyed, &#145;Maid of Peace&#146;, became a courageous star speaker in the bitter campaigns against conscription of 1916 and 1917, and published an anti-war play, <span class="italic">Betrayed</span> (1917), and a pamphlet, <span class="italic">After the War, What?</span> (1917). Her mother disowned her, and Adela's leadership of demonstrations led to her arrest and imprisonment in Pentridge, Melbourne, from late 1917 to January 1918.<br>
<br>On 30 September 1917, between prison terms, Adela Pankhurst married Irish-born Thomas Walsh (1871&#150;1943), militant unionist and socialist, a widower fourteen years her senior, in a Free Religious Fellowship service. In her happy marriage Adela bore a son and four daughters between 1918 and 1926, in chaotic and straitened conditions in Sydney and Melbourne, while also caring for three stepdaughters and pursuing her socialist interests. But her increasing advocacy of a family-centred feminism dismayed many feminists.<br>
<br>Adela Pankhurst Walsh campaigned with her husband (who was general secretary of the Seamen's Union), in the landmark seamen's strike of 1919, and wrote for and helped edit the <span class="italic">Seamen's Journal</span>. A foundation member of the Australian Communist Party in 1920, along with Walsh, she was an active communist until, disillusioned with revolution, she resigned in 1922. She also lost faith in militant unionism after the seamen's strike of 1925, when Walsh was imprisoned and threatened with deportation; and the death of her newborn baby in 1926 further sapped her confidence. When years of violent struggle in the union ended in 1928 with Walsh's expulsion over his ideas of industrial peace (that is, co-operation between employers and employees), she rejected unionism, socialism, and the Labor Party, and was reconciled with her mother just before Emmeline's death in 1928.<br>
<br>In 1929 Adela Pankhurst Walsh formed an Australian branch of the London-based Women's Guild of Empire, a conservative welfare group with a mainly middle-class following. During the 1930s, through this group and its organ, the <span class="italic">Empire Gazette</span>, Adela preached anti-communism, the benefits of industrial peace, the importance of the family, and the need for a strong British empire. In 1937 she received the Coronation Medal for community services. Savaged as a radical turncoat, Adela Pankhurst Walsh also lost many of her conservative followers when, as a pacifist, she opposed the Second World War in 1939. Forced to resign from the shocked guild, she advocated economic co-operation with Japan and distrust of American imperialism in the Pacific. A visit she and Walsh made to Japan as guests of the Japanese tourist bureau in late 1939 resulted in the pamphlets <span class="italic">Conditions in Japan</span> (1940) and <span class="italic">What We Should Know about the Orient</span> (1940). In 1940 she stood unsuccessfully for the Australian senate.<br>
<br>In a last attempt to influence history, Adela joined in late 1941 with an anti-British group to create the Australia First movement, a tiny, nationalistic, xenophobic, anti-communist, anti-war party. After Japan's entry into the war, leading members were interned. Adela, who had resigned from the group, was interned on 20 March 1942 but released on 13 October after a hunger strike. Her husband died from cancer on 5 April 1943. Hampered by myocardial degeneration, Adela withdrew from public life, living with her children in turn, taking occasional work as a companion and a nurse for retarded children until of pensionable age.<br>
<br>Adela Pankhurst Walsh was an enthusiast to the end; her final conversion was to the Roman Catholic church in December 1960. She died from a coronary arrest at the Home of Peace, Wahroonga, Sydney, on 23 May 1961, and was buried the following day in the Unitarian section of the Northern Suburbs cemetery, Sydney, beside her husband.<br>
