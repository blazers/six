<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stanley,  Edward George Geoffrey Smith</span>, fourteenth earl of Derby  (1799&#150;1869), <span class="occ">prime minister</span>, was born on 29 March 1799 at Knowsley Hall, Lancashire, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26268/', "Edward Smith Stanley, thirteenth earl of Derby (1775&#150;1851)")</script>, and his wife, Charlotte Margaret (1778&#150;1817), his first cousin and the second daughter of the Revd Geoffrey Hornby, rector of Winwick, Lancashire.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsandeducation"></a>Early years and education</h2>Edward Stanley's childhood at Knowsley, as part of an extended family, was dominated by the powerful personality of his grandfather the twelfth earl of Derby (1752&#150;1834). In addition to his parents and grandparents, the Knowsley household also came to include Stanley's siblings, Charlotte (1801&#150;1853), Henry (1803&#150;1875), Emily (<i>b</i>. May 1804, <i>d</i>. Nov 1804), Louisa (1805&#150;1825), Eleanor Mary (1807&#150;1887), and Charles (1808&#150;1884), as well as the children of the twelfth earl's second marriage, to the actress Elizabeth Farren, namely Lucy (1799&#150;1809), James (1800&#150;1817), and Mary (1801&#150;1858). From his gregarious grandfather Stanley inherited an early commitment to partisan whig politics. In later years he remembered learning as a young boy a family catechism beginning &#145;What does A stand for?&#146; &#145;An Axe.&#146; &#145;What is an Axe for?&#146; &#145;To chop off Kings' heads.&#146; Alongside the high ideals and lowlier pursuits, such as gambling, game shooting, and horse-racing, of Foxite whiggery, as personified by his ebullient grandfather, he was also influenced by the austere Anglican evangelicalism of his mother. His surviving childhood poems, in conventional evangelical terms, dwell upon the themes of earthly temptation, divine judgement, and the necessity of personal faith to secure that grace made available by Christ's atonement on the cross. Stanley's more reclusive father, who though a loyal whig in politics was devoted to the private study of zoology and ornithology, had less influence on the young statesman. Indeed, one of his first actions upon the death of his father in 1851 was to disperse the very large collection of animals and birds his father has assembled at Knowsley.<br>
<br>Stanley was sent to Eton College, where he was in the fifth form lower division in 1811 and upper division in 1814. His Etonian contemporaries included his uncle James Stanley (who was twelve months his junior), Edward Pusey, Richard Jelf, John Evelyn Denison (later speaker of the House of Commons), Charles Augustus Ellis, sixth Baron Howard de Walden, and Lord Francis Leveson-Gower (later Egerton). Under the harsh regime of John &#145;Flogger&#146; Keate, Stanley exhibited both a striking cleverness and a remarkable self-assurance. At Eton, Edward Pusey recalled, Stanley displayed &#145;an iron will and an unbounded self-confidence&#146;  (H. Liddon, <span class="italic">Life of Edward Bouverie Pusey</span>, 3 vols., 1893, 1.13). His acute intelligence was refined through the narrowly classical Eton curriculum, and literary translation remained for the rest of his life an absorbing private pursuit. He became an early and accomplished member of the Eton Society (a debating club known as Pop), the nursery of some periods' greatest orators. During his final year at Eton, in 1817, Stanley undertook an abridgement of Herodotus, as well as Livy's Roman history, and drew up extensive notes on the Hindu and Muslim history of India. When later addressing the faculty and students of Glasgow University, during his installation as lord rector in December 1834, he observed that for any man wishing to study politics or the art of persuasion nothing was more necessary than to imbue the mind with the spirit of the ancient poets and historians, so as &#145;to draw from that pure and crystal fountain some of the copious diction, high sentiment and masculine thought, which so eminently distinguished those great men&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 22 Dec 1834, 3). During his final months at Eton, Stanley's uncle and contemporary James Stanley died. This was followed, on 16 June 1817, by the death of his mother.<br>
<br>In October 1817 Stanley went up to Christ Church, Oxford, as a gentleman commoner. Under his tutor the Revd Edward Goodenough (later headmaster of Westminster School and dean of Wells), he continued to read Herodotus, Thucydides, Aeschylus, Plato, Aristotle, Horace, and Tacitus. Thomas Short, who taught him mathematics for one term, judged his pupil &#145;a clever promising young man&#146;  (Christ Church Archive, cen.i.a.4). As part of the smart Etonian &#145;set&#146; within the college, Stanley was noted for his academic abilities and boisterous self-assurance. In 1819 he won the prestigious chancellor's prize for Latin composition with his spirited poem &#145;Syracuse&#146;. Earlier that same year he also led a group of drunk undergraduates who, late one night, pulled the figure of Mercury, erected in 1695, down from its plinth in the centre of Christ Church's Great Quadrangle. The college authorities drew a discreet veil over what was regarded as a gentlemanly escapade. Not unusually for a son of the peerage, he went down from Christ Church in April 1820 without taking a degree, leaving behind him a reputation for scholarly cleverness and spirited wilfulness, complemented by his assured self-confidence and evident sensitivity to personal criticism.<h2>
<a name="Earlypoliticalcareer18201830"></a>Early political career, 1820&#150;1830</h2>After Oxford, Stanley associated himself with the urbane and sophisticated third marquess of Lansdowne, a prominent whig who had served as a youthful chancellor of the exchequer in the &#145;ministry of all the talents&#146; from 1806 to 1807. Under Lansdowne's tutelage he undertook extensive reading outside the classics in preparation for a political career, thereby broadening the political ideas he inherited from his grandfather. Through Lansdowne he was introduced to the liberal views of the Scottish Enlightenment and political economy, and also read extensively in British history. This reinforced his belief in the pre-eminent status of parliament as the authoritative arena of national politics and the source of constitutional sovereignty. Thus parliament checked the potential tyranny of both an arbitrary royal prerogative and the wayward democratic mob. Party deliberation within Westminster defined the authentic national interest and bestowed upon cabinets the authority to govern. Stanley's scepticism regarding popular agitation and disdain for the press was also encouraged by his studies. Parties in parliament complemented the legitimate hierarchical social influence of a responsible and enlightened aristocracy. His commitment to the Anglican church establishment within the United Kingdom stood upon the authority of the law as the foundation of a civil order safeguarding property and progress.<br>
<br>Early in 1822 Stanley travelled to Italy. While composing a series of Petrachan &#145;Sonnets to Italy&#146; during his journey, he also assaulted a Neapolitan official for a perceived insult. As a result he was sentenced in Naples to one day in the black hole and thirteen days in the common gaol. Here he experienced those harsh conditions of incarceration which prompted William Gladstone, thirty years later, to decry Neapolitan barbarity. Upon his return Stanley was elected, on 30 July 1822, as MP for the borough of Stockbridge&#151;an interest in the constituency having recently been bought by the whig Earl Grosvenor from the West Indian proprietor Joseph Foster Barham. He loyally returned whig votes in Commons divisions, making his maiden speech on 30 March 1824 on the <span class="roman">Manchester Gaslight Bill</span>, which was favourably received as a signal of the arrival of a promising young whig talent. Soon afterwards he spoke against the radical Joseph Hume's call for an inquiry into the Anglican Irish church establishment, arguing that any interference with the property of the Church of Ireland would be a dangerous precedent justifying the disruption of other legally designated forms of landed, funded, or commercial property.<br>
<br>In the autumn and winter of 1824, accompanied by his Christ Church friends John Evelyn Denison, Henry Labouchere, and John Stuart Wortley, Stanley travelled in Canada and the United States. Upon his return he married, on 31 May 1825 at Marylebone, Emma Caroline (1805&#150;1876), second daughter of Edward Bootle-Wilbraham, afterwards first Baron Skelmersdale (1771&#150;1853). They established their first married home at Ballykisteen, the 4000 acre Derby estate in Tipperary. Their first child, a son called <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26266/', "Edward Henry Stanley")</script>, was born on 21 July 1826. Their second son, the future governor-general of Canada <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36245/', "Frederick Arthur Stanley")</script>, followed in 1841. Stanley spoke little during the 1825 and 1826 parliamentary sessions. At the general election on 26 June 1826 he was returned for Preston under a popular franchise, defeating the rival candidacy of William Cobbett. During the eventful session of 1827 Stanley, like his mentor Lansdowne, moved closer to the liberal tory George Canning, and supported his unsuccessful bid to revise the corn laws in March 1827. Following the premature death of Canning (who had been premier since April) in July 1827, Stanley accepted the office of colonial under-secretary on 15 October 1827 under Canning's successor Lord Goderich, but resigned from the post when the duke of Wellington became prime minister in January 1828.<br>
<br>During the following months, with Lansdowne's influence waning, Canning's legacy provided a template for Stanley's ambition. &#145;The old stubborn spirit of Toryism&#146;, he declared to the Commons on 18 February 1828, &#145;was at last yielding to the increased liberality of the age&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 2</span>, 18, 1828, col. 523). Stanley attacked Wellington's ministry for its opposition to Catholic emancipation, defended Canning's proposed revision to the corn laws in April 1828, and voted for the repeal of the <span class="roman">Test and Corporation Acts</span>. He also supported proposals for gradual, as opposed to extensive, parliamentary reform. By July 1828 some MPs, most notably Sir James Graham, looked to the youthful and self-assured Stanley to lead a centrist merger of moderate whigs and liberal Canningite tories. This was the context for William Huskisson's description of Stanley in 1829 as &#145;the Hope of the Nation&#146;  (T. Creevey to Ord, 1 Nov 1829, <span class="italic">The Creevey Papers</span>, ed. H. Maxwell, 1905, 545). The passage of Catholic emancipation at the hands of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel in April 1829, however, removed the ground upon which a moderate coalition might stand. None the less, Stanley had acquired sufficient stature, particularly as an effective speaker, as to give some credibility to the claim of his being the only &#145;brilliant eldest son produced by the British peerage for a hundred years&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 25 Oct 1869, 7).<h2>
<a name="ChiefsecretaryforIrelandandcolonialsecretary18301834"></a>Chief secretary for Ireland and colonial secretary, 1830&#150;1834</h2>On 29 November 1830 Stanley was appointed chief secretary for Ireland, without a seat in cabinet, in Lord Grey's reform ministry, and was sworn of the privy council. When he was defeated, amid violent scenes, in his re-election for Preston in December 1830 by Henry &#145;Orator&#146; Hunt (1773&#150;1835), William IV made the constituency of Windsor available, for which royal borough Stanley was returned on 10 February 1831. In Ireland, which he believed was on the verge of rebellion, Stanley was confronted by the novel political agitation of Daniel O'Connell's popular Catholic campaign and increasing rural violence against the payment of the Anglican tithe, within the wearingly familiar context of Irish sectarian politics. His first priority as chief secretary was the full restoration of the rule of law. Only with the establishment of stable civil order, he insisted, could remedial reforms be responsibly undertaken. This priority caused constant conflicts with ministerial colleagues, such as Lord Holland, Lord Althorp, and Lord Brougham, as well as the lord lieutenant of Ireland, Lord Anglesey, who all strongly favoured immediate concessions to Irish grievances. Stanley's own and entirely secular diagnosis of Ireland's ills was the absence of a resident gentry, want of capital, shortage of employment, and lack of adequate education.<br>
<br>During 1831, fierce and bitter confrontations between Stanley and O'Connell became regular parliamentary occurrences. In January 1831 O'Connell was arrested for seditious activity, although, to Stanley's great displeasure, the charges were subsequently allowed to lapse on the understanding that he would support parliamentary reform. Later in the year Stanley armed the Irish yeomanry (a largely protestant force) and attempted to introduce an <span class="roman">Arms Bill</span>, regulating the importation of weapons into Ireland and increasing the penalties for possessing arms without a licence. He insisted on an arrears of tithes measure, passed in June 1832, requiring the collection of unpaid tax. This, Anglesey complained, left the lord lieutenant &#145;carrying at the point of a bayonet, an odious measure&#146;  (Marquess of Anglesey [G. C. H. V. Paget], <span class="italic">One-Leg: the Life and Letters of Henry William Paget, First Marquess of Anglesey, 1768&#150;1854</span>, 1961, 264). In 1833 Stanley secured a very strong <span class="roman">Peace Preservation Act</span> which empowered the lord lieutenant to suppress meetings and to declare disturbed districts under martial law. His dramatic description in the Commons, on 27 February 1833, of the murder and rural outrages occurring in Ireland secured parliamentary support for the measure. Lord John Russell regarded this speech as &#145;one of the greatest triumphs ever won in a popular assembly by the powers of oratory&#146;  (J. Russell, <span class="italic">Recollections and Suggestions</span>, 1875, 113). Alongside firm coercive legislation Stanley introduced a number of concessionary Irish reforms. His <span class="roman">Irish Education Act</span> of 1832 created the Irish board of national education in receipt of a government grant to support schools admitting children of all denominations and providing religious teaching of an undogmatic character. The scheme drew on an anonymous pamphlet, <span class="italic">Thoughts and Suggestions on the Education of the Peasantry of Ireland</span> (1820), read by Stanley, upon Lansdowne's recommendation, ten years earlier. Stanley also established the Irish board of works and the Shannon navigation improvements. In the spring of 1832 he oversaw a <span class="roman">Tithes Act</span> which enforced a permanent commutation of tithes for money payments. In later life he regarded this legislation as his most important achievement while Irish chief secretary. The most laborious and disagreeable task he faced, he recalled, was reforming the notoriously corrupt Irish civil list.<br>
<br>In June 1831 Grey brought Stanley into his cabinet, and increasingly relied on him as a counterweight to their more radically minded colleagues. During November 1831, amid reform riots in the country, Stanley undertook, on behalf of Grey, some of the delicate private negotiation with the more moderate opponents of reform, such as lords Wharncliffe and Harrowby, exploring the possibility of a compromise reform settlement. Many believed Grey was grooming Stanley for the Commons leadership once Lord Althorp, upon the anticipated death of his father, was elevated to the Lords. Meanwhile, during 1831&#150;2, the combative Stanley proved himself the strongest ministerial speaker in the Commons, particularly in the prolonged exchanges over parliamentary reform. For example, he effectively answered Peel on 4 March 1831 and delivered, on 17 December 1831, a brilliant and crushing response to John Wilson Croker. During the &#145;Days of May crisis&#146; in 1832, when Grey briefly relinquished office, Stanley rallied the party with a powerful after-dinner speech at Brooks's Club. The final passage of the 1832 <span class="roman">Reform Act for England and Wales</span> owed much to his forceful advocacy. Stanley also oversaw, during 1832, an <span class="roman">Irish Reform Act</span> which enlarged the county electorate by enfranchising various categories of leaseholder, introduced a &pound;10 householder borough franchise, and gave an additional five MPs to Irish constituencies. On 17 December 1832 he succeeded his father as MP for North Lancashire, which seat he held until he was raised to the Lords in 1844.<br>
<br>On 28 March 1833 Grey transferred Stanley to the Colonial Office. Here Stanley drew up the <span class="roman">Abolition of Slavery Bill</span> which became law in August 1833. This legislation enacted a fixed seven-year period of apprenticeship for freed adult slaves and allocated &pound;20 million compensation for plantation owners. In April 1833, at the young age of thirty-four, Stanley suffered his first chronic attack of gout, aggravated by the unceasing exertions of the previous years. Thereafter, recurrent attacks of the illness forced him to his bed in excruciating pain with increasing frequency. In May 1834 the debate on Irish church revenues prompted Stanley's resignation from Grey's ministry. Stanley's <span class="roman">Irish Church Temporalities Act</span> of 1833 had reformed the institutional structure of the church by reducing the number of bishoprics and scaling down the revenues of the remaining twelve. But in May 1834 Russell, fresh from a tour of Ireland, pushed for further Irish church reform. Stanley fiercely objected to Russell's Commons pronouncement, on 6 May, in favour of the appropriation of Irish church revenues for secular purposes. With Graham and the duke of Richmond, he resigned on 27 May.<h2>
<a name="TheDerbyDillyandConservativemerger18341841"></a>The &#145;Derby Dilly&#146; and Conservative merger, 1834&#150;1841</h2>After May 1834 Stanley led a small group of independent MPs derisively dubbed by O'Connell the &#145;Derby Dilly&#146;, a reference to George Canning's poem &#145;The Loves of the Triangles&#146;. On 2 July 1834 Stanley famously and injudiciously described whig policy over the Irish church tithe as resembling the sleight of hand practised by thimbleriggers (tricksters) at a fair. The offensive tone of his &#145;Thimblerig&#146; speech widened the breach with former whig colleagues. Having assumed, upon the death of his grandfather on 21 October 1834, the title Lord Stanley, he now looked to hold the Commons balance of power between Peel's Conservative Party on one side and whig, Irish, and radical MPs on the other. He declined to join Peel's Conservative cabinet in December 1834. Rather, he took the opportunity of his installation as lord rector of Glasgow University on 21 December 1834 to announce what became called the &#145;Knowsley creed&#146;, in which he promised to uphold traditional institutions, including church establishments, in the affection of the country, while removing proven blemishes in the constitution and embracing responsible reform. In doing so he committed himself to opposing reckless and destructive radical change. But the pre-emptive publication of Peel's Tamworth manifesto, just days before the announcement of the Knowsley creed, and Russell's subsequent unification of the whig, radical, and Irish opposition in the Lichfield House compact of March 1835 undercut Stanley's ground. By April 1835, with Lord Melbourne and Russell's return to office, the Derby Dilly was politically marginalized, and Stanley's &#145;visions of the helm&#146; rapidly faded  (Croker to Peel, 8 Jan 1835, C. S. Parker, <span class="italic">Sir Robert Peel</span>, 2 vols., 1891, 2.277).<br>
<br>During 1835 and 1836 Stanley gradually moved towards union with Peel's Conservative Party. On 1 July 1835 he and Graham crossed the floor of the Commons to sit alongside Peel's supporters. At a banquet for Peel, given at the Merchant Taylors' Hall on 12 May 1838, he sat beside Peel as one of his chief lieutenants, and declared that the traditional whig aims of moderate and responsible reform were now to be realized through the Conservative Party. At the beginning of 1841 he joined the Carlton Club. In opposition from 1835 to 1841, Stanley forcefully criticized the government's Irish and ecclesiastical proposals, its <span class="roman">Jamaica Bill</span>, and its policy with regard to Canada. In February 1840 he introduced an <span class="roman">Irish Voters Registration Bill</span>, proposing annual registration along English lines and the abolition of the existing certificate system. O'Connell immediately denounced &#145;Scorpion Stanley&#146; and launched the National Association for Repeal of the Union. The <span class="roman">Irish Voters Registration Bill</span>, however, ran out of parliamentary time and was withdrawn by Stanley on 6 July 1840. In February 1841 he reintroduced the bill. But the success of the Conservative no-confidence motion of August 1841 forced Melbourne's government from office, and with a large Commons majority Peel formed a Conservative ministry.<h2>
<a name="Colonialsecretary18411845"></a>Colonial secretary, 1841&#150;1845</h2>On 3 September 1841 Stanley joined Peel's cabinet as colonial secretary, the post from which he had resigned seven years earlier. During his tenure of office Hong Kong became a British colony, under the terms of the treaty of Nanking (Nanjing) of 1842. In 1843 Natal in South Africa and Sind in India also became British territories. Stanley worked with the foreign secretary, Lord Aberdeen, in negotiating the Webster&#150;Ashburton treaty of August 1842, which settled the boundary dispute between the United States and Canada. In 1843 he also supported the <span class="roman">Canadian Corn Bill</span>, which allowed Canadian corn into the British market at a greatly reduced import duty. While advocating a policy of free trade with the colonies, however, he opposed the extension of this policy to commercial relations with foreign powers.<br>
<br>In November 1844 Stanley was elevated to the Lords with the title of Lord Stanley of Bickerstaffe. The government need for debating strength in the upper house and Stanley's ill health were given as the official explanation for this move. But the elevation was also, in part, due to a cooling of relations with Peel. Stanley subsequently rejected Peel's argument in October 1845 that the condition of Ireland required a broader policy of free trade: it was a policy, he maintained, inconsistent with Peel's previous statements, which also violated the government's understanding with its own back-bench support. Repeal of the corn laws, in such circumstances, would be a breach of faith. On 22 December 1845 Stanley resigned from Peel's cabinet, his parting words to his ministerial colleagues being &#145;we cannot do this as gentlemen&#146;  (Lord Broughton, <span class="italic">Recollections of a Long Life</span>, ed. Lady Dorchester, 6 vols., 1909&#150;11, 6.229).<h2>
<a name="Conservativeleadership18461868"></a>Conservative leadership, 1846&#150;1868</h2>Stanley resolutely opposed Peel's repeal of the corn laws, most notably in his speech of 25 May 1846, when he defended protection as necessary to preserve the twin pillars upon which the British empire stood: the landed interest and the colonial system. Yet Stanley was never a doctrinaire protectionist. Rather, he saw repeal as a betrayal of the mutual trust that should exist between a party leadership and its parliamentary support. &#145;Peel's great error&#146;, Stanley observed to Lord George Bentinck in October 1847, &#145;has always been disregarding the opinion of his party, whenever it did not exactly square with his own&#146;  (Stanley to Bentinck, 27 Oct 1847, Derby MS 920 DER (14) 177/2). To accept office, he later maintained, &#145;with the purpose of throwing over, voluntarily, the main object of those who have raised us to it is to follow too closely an <i>exemplar vitiis imitable</i> to which I can never submit&#146;  (Derby to Disraeli, 18 Jan 1852, Monypenny &amp; Buckle, 3.317).<br>
<br>During 1846 Stanley accepted, with initial reluctance, the leadership of the protectionist Conservatives who opposed corn law repeal. Yet he continued to look towards a reunion with the Peelites. As opposition leader after 1846 Stanley consistently advocated a moderate policy, distancing himself from militant popular protectionist agitation and the intense anti-Catholicism of some of his supporters. During 1848 he encouraged the abandonment of the label protectionist for the resumption of the more moderate party designation Conservative. He delivered powerful attacks on Russell's government over the expulsion of the British ambassador to Spain in 1848; on his amendment to the royal address in 1849; on the <span class="roman">Navigation Bill</span>; and on Lord Roden's removal from the commission of the peace in February 1850 over accusation of partiality in his dealings with an Orange march at Dolly's Brae, in co. Down. Most notably, on 17 June 1850, Stanley secured a Lords majority of seventeen votes criticizing Lord Palmerston's policy of gunboat diplomacy in the Aegean in the Don Pacifico affair.<br>
<br>The paucity of talent among the Commons protectionist leadership remained a difficulty for Stanley throughout this period. The mercurial Lord George Bentinck resigned the Commons leadership in December 1847. Thereafter, Stanley was forced to acknowledge Benjamin Disraeli's pre-eminence, by virtue of his debating skills, within Conservative ranks. Stanley remained, however, deeply suspicious of Disraeli's propensity to intrigue, his volatile temperament, and the obstacle he presented to reunion with the Peelites. Not until 1850 was Disraeli recognized by Stanley as sole Commons leader. Disraeli was not invited to Knowsley until December 1853, and Stanley never visited Disraeli's country seat at Hughenden.<br>
<br>In February 1851, upon Russell's resignation as premier, Stanley was invited by the queen to form a government. Initially, on 22 February, he declined the commission. &#145;It is a bungling fisherman who strikes at the first nibble&#146;, he privately commented: &#145;I shall wait till my fish has gorged the bait and then I am sure to land him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Disraeli, Derby and the Conservative Party</span>, 44). The queen then reverted to Stanley on 25 February, Russell in the interim having failed to form a ministry. But the Peelites, at Graham's urging and despite Aberdeen's professions of friendship, refused to join Stanley in office. The subsequent hesitation of his own supporters, particularly John Herries and Joseph Henley, forced an exasperated Stanley to abandon his commission. After February 1851 he gave up hope of a collective reunion with the leading Peelites and came to regard moderate whigs as better prospects for future adhesion. On 30 June 1851 his father died and he succeeded to the title as fourteenth earl of Derby.<br>
<br>Upon Russell again resigning as premier on 21 February 1852 Derby formed a Conservative government. Once more rebuffed by the Peelites, Derby formed his cabinet from meagre and inexperienced Conservative materials. This led to the government being given the hostile appellation of the &#145;Who, Who&#146; ministry. Much abuse was, and has continued to be, heaped upon this makeshift 1852 government, which was hampered by its minority status in the Commons. Nevertheless, Derby secured the Conservatives' official relinquishment of protectionism, which he recognized as the major bar to a broader reconstruction of party alignment. During 1852 new militia legislation (based upon a plan devised by Prince Albert) was passed, a new constitution for New Zealand was established, legal reforms were enacted (streamlining common-law procedure, remodelling chancery practice, and generally revising the equity system), and fiscal free-trade reforms were incorporated in Disraeli's budgets. This legislative activity sustained Derby's aim of proving that the Conservatives in office, though shorn of Peelite talent, were capable of moderate and responsible government. In July 1852 Derby dissolved parliament, and the ensuing general election returned to the Commons some 299 Conservatives, 315 Liberals, whigs, and radicals, and 40 Peelites. On 16 December 1852 Disraeli's supplementary budget was decisively defeated, primarily as a consequence of Gladstone's ferocious opposition. The following day Derby resigned as prime minister.<br>
<br>In opposition, first to Aberdeen's coalition ministry from December 1852 to February 1855, and thereafter to Palmerston's first ministry until February 1858, Derby adopted a policy of &#145;armed neutrality&#146;. Through &#145;masterly inactivity&#146; he sought to kill the government with kindness, as he privately described it  (<span class="italic">Disraeli, Derby and the Conservative Party</span>, 92). He believed that any government, such as Aberdeen's Peelite, whig, Liberal, and radical coalition, made up of discordant non-Conservative elements must eventually break apart&#151;as long as the Conservative opposition avoided raising issues which might unite them. As a result non-Conservative governments fell, in 1855 and 1858, because of hostile radical, rather than conservative, initiatives. This was meant to show moderate whigs that their real friends sat opposite, not alongside, them in the Commons. Such calculation, as well as patriotic duty, tempered Derby's criticism of government mismanagement during the Crimean War. Moreover, the unresolved issue of parliamentary reform, he anticipated, would prove the pernicious solvent of non-Conservative Party connection after 1852. Reform would bring whigs and moderate Liberals together with the Conservatives in opposition to dangerously radical and destructive change.<br>
<br>When, on 29 January 1855, Aberdeen's coalition was defeated over a radical motion for an inquiry into the conduct of the Crimean War, the queen asked Derby to form a government. Believing neither Russell nor Palmerston capable of forming a stable government he initially declined the commission, thereby causing his rivals' weakness to be exposed. He then expected to be sent for by the queen a second time and to be in a much stronger position to invite non-Conservatives to join him. As anticipated Russell failed to form a government, but, to Derby's surprise, the elderly Palmerston succeeded in bringing a whig, Liberal, and Peelite cabinet together under his leadership. This, in retrospect, exposed Derby to Conservative criticism. Disraeli, for one, was incensed by what he saw as a lost opportunity, but by November 1855 he was in agreement with Derby that &#145;silence and inertia are our wisest course&#146;  (Disraeli to Derby, 7 Nov 1855, Derby MS 920 DER (14) 145/3). During these years Disraeli served his leader well by providing a target for those frustrated or disillusioned by Derby's quiescence in opposition. Conservatives found it easier to despise Disraeli than be disloyal to Derby.<br>
<br>In February 1858, following defeat over a radical attack on their handling of the Orsini crisis, Palmerston's government resigned. On 21 February Derby promptly accepted the premiership for a second time. Invitations to join his cabinet were extended to the Peelite Gladstone and the duke of Newcastle, and to the whig third Earl Grey, but were rejected. Once again, therefore, Derby was forced to form a purely Conservative cabinet from restricted resources, enjoying only minority support in the Commons. None the less, he sought firmly to establish the Conservatives as a credible and moderate party of government: a party, as he termed it, prepared strenuously to maintain the institutions of the country, while not hesitating to support measures of undoubted improvement. On 1 March 1858 Derby told the Lords that there could be no greater mistake than supposing a Conservative ministry to be a stationary ministry. Their age, he pronounced, was one of constant moral, social, and political progress, in which old institutions should, by judicious changes, be adapted to the increased demands of society. Thus, during 1858, Disraeli introduced a budget reviving the terms of Gladstone's 1853 fiscal plan; an <span class="roman">India Act</span> revised the government of the Asian subcontinent in the wake of the Indian mutiny; a bill abolishing the property qualification for MPs (a Chartist demand) was supported, as was legislation allowing practising Jews to sit in the Commons; Anglo-French relations were calmed in the aftermath of the Orsini crisis; Anglo-American relations were soothed over Central America; mediation was pursued in the affair of the <i>Charles et George</i>; the Cagliari incident was resolved; and a policy of neutrality adopted over the Italian question.<br>
<br>In March 1859 Derby's ministry introduced a <span class="roman">Parliamentary Reform Bill</span> which proposed an identity of suffrage in both counties and boroughs at the &pound;10 householder level. The new uniform franchise was safeguarded by clauses stripping borough freeholders of their county vote and a redistribution scheme mitigating the effect in the counties of a uniform suffrage. Derby saw the measure as a moderate and comprehensive settlement. But the success, by 330 to 291 votes, of a Commons motion moved by Russell on 1 April 1859 objecting to the disfranchisement of borough freeholders in the counties scuttled the bill. Derby immediately dissolved parliament. The Conservatives gained seats in the election, but their 306 MPs remained in a minority in the event of the divided opposition finding ground upon which to unite. The Willis's Rooms meeting of 6 June 1859 brought whigs, Liberals, radicals, and Peelites together, and on 10 June Derby's ministry was defeated in a packed chamber by 310 to 323 votes on a broad Commons opposition motion of no confidence. In recognition of his services to the country the queen, upon Derby's subsequent resignation of the premiership, made him a knight of the Garter.<br>
<br>In opposition to Palmerston's second ministry from June 1859 to October 1865 Derby resumed a strategy of &#145;masterly inactivity&#146;: what Lord Malmesbury, his confidant, described as keeping &#145;the cripples on their legs&#146;  (Malmesbury, 2.215). Once again Derby believed a broad Liberal alliance to be an inherently unstable party alignment. In 1860 the Conservatives assisted Palmerston in shelving Russell's parliamentary reform legislation. The supreme achievement of Palmerston's last years, however, proved to be keeping the Liberal &#145;bundle of sticks&#146;, as the whig Lord Clarendon had called it, bound together  (Lord Fitzmaurice, <span class="italic">The Life of Second Earl Granville K.G.</span>, 2 vols., 1905, 1.487). Palmerston's longevity deferred the Liberal disintegration anticipated by Derby. Meanwhile, increasingly frequent severe attacks of gout enhanced for Derby the advantages of parliamentary quiescence. Also the recurrence of periods of depression during his later years, which usually descended upon him during the recess at Knowsley away from the exhilaration of Westminster and after the main racing calendar, brought on moods of despondency and gloom. Although he consistently criticized Russell's foreign policy (for example, on 4 February 1864 he delivered a major speech in the Lords preventing British intervention in the Prussian-Danish War), restraint remained the keynote of his opposition during Palmerston's lifetime. &#145;Our game&#146;, Derby told Disraeli in July 1865, &#145;must be purely defensive&#146;  (Derby to Disraeli, 25 July 1865, Derby MS DER (14) 190/1).<br>
<br>In October 1865 Palmerston died while still in office. This raised the long-awaited prospect of party reconstruction, with Russell succeeding Palmerston as premier, around the revived issue of parliamentary reform. Following the rejection of a Liberal <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> in June 1866 upon a hostile motion moved by dissident Liberals, Derby formed, on 28 June, his third minority Conservative government. As he later declared to the Lords, he &#145;did not intend for a third time to be made a mere stop gap until it would suit the convenience of the Liberal party to forget their dissensions&#146;. He was determined to take such a course &#145;as would convert, if possible, an existing minority into a practical majority&#146;  (22 July 1867, <span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 188, 1867, col. 1783). Having accepted office, Derby told Sir John Pakington privately in December 1866, &#145;I mean to keep it as long as I can&#146;  (Derby to Pakington, 4 Dec 1866, Derby MS 920 DER (14) 193/1). He saw in the reform issue the opportunity, once again, to prove a Conservative government capable of overseeing judicious change and safeguarding progress. In November 1866 he advocated a reform scheme for England and Wales adopting a rated urban household suffrage, moderated by plural voting. Having skilfully managed ministerial discussion during the recess, however, the increasingly frail Derby found his control of the reform measure wrested from him during the intense Commons debate that ensued after February 1867. The Conservative bill broadly designed by Derby became subject to and transformed by Disraeli's tactical dexterity. With Disraeli's compliance many of the safeguards, such as plural voting for professionals, a two-year residential qualification, and the personal payment of rates, were stripped away from the urban household suffrage. As a result a more extensive measure than Derby had originally conceived was passed by the Commons, which effectively almost doubled the size of the electorate. None the less, Derby rallied Conservative peers behind the bill as a means, he declared, of establishing the institutions of the country on a firmer basis, while increasing the loyalty and contentment of a greater portion of her majesty's subjects. In August 1867 the second <span class="roman">Reform Act</span> was passed. The county suffrage in England and Wales was lowered to an annual &pound;12 rental qualification, a modest redistribution of forty-five seats gave an additional twenty-five members to county constituencies, while a Parliamentary Boundary Commission, packed with Conservatives, redrew the constituencies so as to reduce urban electoral intrusion into the counties.<h2>
<a name="Retirementanddeath18681869"></a>Retirement and death, 1868&#150;1869</h2>In February 1868 a rapidly ageing and sick Derby resigned from the premiership, handing the office over to Disraeli. Derby also resigned the formal leadership of his party in the Lords. Thereafter, he spoke repeatedly and forcefully against the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland, as proposed by Gladstone, and delivered his last speech to the Lords on 17 June 1869. In March 1869 the queen had honoured him with the GCMG. Derby attended the Lords for the last time on 22 July to hear the <span class="roman">Irish Disestablishment Bill</span> passed and remarked to Lord Cairns, on departing the chamber, &#145;I have nothing left but to go away&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Queen Victoria</span>, ed. A. C. Benson and Lord Esher, and G. E. Buckle, 2nd ser., 1926&#150;8, 1.521).<br>
<br>Having retired to Knowsley at the end of the 1869 session Derby died there, after being for days in a state of semi-consciousness due to the large quantities of opium administered to relieve his pain, at 6.55 a.m. on 23 October 1869. His final words, in response to the enquiry as to how he was feeling, were &#145;Bored to the utmost power of extinction&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diaries of E. H. Stanley</span>, 37). As in life so Derby approached death with a characteristic insouciance. According to his instructions he was buried on 29 October 1869 in Knowsley parish church with a strictly private service attended only by family, servants, and tenants. He was survived by three children, Edward Henry, fifteenth earl of Derby (1826&#150;1893), Frederick Arthur, sixteenth earl of Derby (1841&#150;1908), and Emma Charlotte (1835&#150;1928), who married the Hon. W. Talbot.<h2>
<a name="Scholarshiptheologyandsport"></a>Scholarship, theology and sport</h2>Derby's classical and literary talent received early recognition with the chancellor's prize in 1819. Throughout his life he continued to translate classical authors, particularly Homer, and contemporary French and German poetry. His conversation also revealed a love for and familiarity with Shakespeare, whose works he enjoyed reading aloud to his family. In 1852 he succeeded the duke of Wellington as chancellor of Oxford University and was created DCL by diploma. His Latin speeches, particularly those given at his installation in the Sheldonian Theatre in 1853 and delivered on 16 June 1863 upon the visit of the prince and princess of Wales to the university, were widely admired for their easy and excellent style. Derby's <span class="italic">Translations of Poems Ancient and Modern</span>, privately printed in 1862, included a blank verse translation of part of the <span class="italic">Iliad</span>. His translation of the whole, as <span class="italic">The Iliad of Homer Rendered into English Blank Verse</span> (2 vols.), appeared in 1864 to much critical praise. It reached its sixth edition by 1867. In 1870 the Derby (classical) scholarship was posthumously established at Oxford to commemorate his connection with the university.<br>
<br>In 1828 Derby published his <span class="italic">Conversations on the Parables for the Use of Children</span>. The lucidly written and engaging <span class="italic">Conversations</span>, composed in the form of daily lessons given by a mother to her two young children, revealed the influence of his own maternal evangelicalism. The parables were explained as moral lessons on the Christian duties of personal faith, charity, and humility. A second edition was published in 1832. In 1839 Derby published <span class="italic">The Miracles of Our Lord Explained</span>. In epistolary form this work discussed Christ's miracles as parables, illuminating key Christian truths such as the sanctity of marriage, the ascendancy of God's power over evil, and the necessity of God's grace to the removal of sin. The work is notable for its earnest warnings of the dangerous seductive falsehoods of Catholicism. Like the blind man restored to sight, Derby explained, only personal faith, not priestly power, could enable the genuinely repentant to receive the blessings of God's redeeming love.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Derby was a passionate sportsman. Horse-racing and <i>battue</i> shooting remained, until the 1860s, absorbing diversions from public life. As a young man he managed his grandfather's large stable. Yet, despite his best efforts, during his racing career he failed to win either the Derby or the Oaks, those highlights of the racing calendar established by his grandfather. In 1858 he came close, with his horse Toxophilite, to achieving the double distinction of winning the Derby and being prime minister in the same year. Other famous horses from his stable, such as Dervish, De Clare, Canezou, and Ithuriel, brought him much success. In 1849 he was appointed steward of the Jockey Club. His letter to the Jockey Club of 1857 became a classic and oft-quoted statement of the appropriate conduct for gentlemen of the turf. In 1863, because of ill health, he sold a greater part of his stud and formally retired from the turf. Game-shooting on the Knowsley estate, accompanied by his spaniels and with his tenants acting as beaters, remained a passion he shared with close friends and political intimates such as Lord Malmesbury.<br>
<br>Derby prided himself on the affection with which he was held by his tenants. Visitors to Knowsley often observed the warm relations between him and those who farmed or worked on the estate. Elsewhere in the county Derby's son, in 1853, &#145;found remaining an almost feudal respect for our family&#146;  (<span class="italic">Disraeli, Derby and the Conservative Party</span>, 112). In 1862 Derby became chairman of the central relief committee in Lancashire during the cotton famine. At Manchester, on 2 December 1862, he praised the noble manner in which destitution was being borne by the working men of Lancashire, and until 1865 he devoted much energy to raising private subscriptions for the relief of suffering in the county. He contributed &pound;10,000 to the fund himself, then regarded as the largest single subscription, up to that time, made by an individual Englishman to a public fund for a single purpose. He also served as a Sloane trustee of the British Museum from 1835 to 1866 and as an elder brother of the Trinity House from 1852 to 1869.<h2>
<a name="Achievementandreputation"></a>Achievement and reputation</h2>Derby was the first British statesman to become prime minister three times. He remains, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, the longest-serving party leader in modern British politics. When unveiling a statue of Derby in Parliament Square, Westminster, in July 1874 Disraeli summarized his career thus: &#145;He abolished slavery, he educated Ireland, he reformed parliament&#146;  (Monypenny &amp; Buckle, 2.451). Because of his debating power Derby played an important part in the reforms of the early 1830s, particularly the <span class="roman">1832 Reform Bill</span>. Between 1846 and 1868 he restored the Conservatives as a credible party of government. Throughout his career he advocated moderate judicious reform, which he presented as the essential safeguard of peaceful, well-ordered progress. This was the context for his private conviction that &#145;real political power was not to be had in England: at best you could only a little advance or retard the progress of an inevitable movement&#146;, and that it was the purpose of politics to provide a stable, yet flexible, framework for the onward advance of society  (<span class="italic">Disraeli, Derby and the Conservative Party</span>, 104). Derby retained, however, an abiding distrust of non-parliamentary politics, as manifested in populist campaigns or the influence of the press. Throughout his life he remained convinced that the authentic national interest was to be discerned in the calm deliberation of parties in Westminster rather than popular platforms or extra-parliamentary agitation. Dangerous extremism, either radical or ultra-tory, was to be contained, and reckless change to be held in check. Only when necessary did he speak outside parliament.<br>
<br>As a result Derby's achievement as a statesman was confined to the parliamentary arena. His attractive tenor voice, precise diction, clearness of style, and commanding intelligence made him one of the most effective parliamentary speakers of his day. This was despite the extreme nervousness he experienced prior to making any major statement. T. B. Macaulay, to whom Derby confessed that before speaking his throat was as dry as a man about to be hanged, noted that, none the less, Derby &#145;speaks like a man who never knew what fear or even modesty was&#146;  (G. O. Trevelyan, <span class="italic">The Life and Letters of Lord Macaulay</span>, 2 vols., 1876, 1.242). One hostile observer, the first earl of Kimberley, judged Derby's magisterial speech on the Don Pacifico affair in 1850, &#145;the most brilliant speech I think I have ever heard&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Journal of John Wodehouse, First Earl of Kimberley, 1862&#150;1902</span>, ed. A. Hawkins and J. Powell, Camden Fifth Series, 9, 1997, 44). The whig lord chancellor, Lord Campbell, declared the combative Derby to be &#145;a host in himself. He has marvellous acuteness of intellect and consummate power in debate. There is no subject which he cannot thoroughly and lucidly explain&#146;  (M. S. Hardcastle, <span class="italic">Life of Lord Campbell</span>, 2 vols., 1881, 2.324). Disraeli privately marvelled at Derby's capability: &#145;his mind always clear, his patience extraordinary, he rises in difficulty, and his resources never fail&#146;  (<span class="italic">Disraeli, Derby and the Conservative Party</span>, 72). The Conservative minister and novelist Edward Bulwer-Lytton thought Derby &#145;the <i>cleverest</i> public man he had ever met. Others had more genius, more knowledge, more pure intellect, but none seemed to rival Derby's cleverness&#146;  (Bulwer-Lytton memo, 1869?, Herts. ALS, Lytton MS C13, fol. 21).<br>
<br>Yet, though he achieved much, after his death Derby was much neglected. In part this was because of his temperament and manner. He was well known for his love of the pointed jest. When, in later life, he heard the riddle posed &#145;Why is heaven like a bald head?&#146;, Derby declined the conventional response that both were shining places where no parting existed. But he immediately replied that &#145;in neither place is a &#147;Whig&#148; in sight&#146;  (Bagley, 185). But, despite his charm, Derby rarely established confidential relations with supporters or social inferiors. He &#145;made no pains to soothe irritated vanities. He thought he did the party a great favour to lead it at all&#146;  (Bulwer-Lytton memo, 1869?, Herts. ALS, Lytton MS C13, fol. 21). Only the aristocratic sharers of his amusements became intimates. He rarely frequented the Carlton Club and entertained little at his London residence in St James's Square. The countess of Derby was neither a successful nor enthusiastic political hostess: one guest remembered her entertainments as being &#145;of a dullness as depressing as a London fog&#146;  (Lord Redesdale, ed., <span class="italic">Memories, by Lord Redesdale, 1867&#150;76</span>, 2 vols., 1915, 1.534). Derby's aloofness, a robust, often sharp, sense of humour, and total absorption in the activity of the moment repelled easy social familiarity. Moreover, his manner led many to doubt his seriousness of purpose. Hence Lord Brougham's double-edged comment that at thirty Derby was by far the cleverest young man of the day, and that at sixty he would be the same  (Lord Morley, <span class="italic">The Life of Gladstone</span>, 3 vols., 1903, 1.160). In his poem &#145;New Timon&#146; (1845) Bulwer-Lytton famously described Derby as &#145;frank, haughty, rash, the Rupert of Debate&#146;.<br>
<br>As later historians of Conservatism celebrated the contributions of Peel and Disraeli so Derby was overlooked. An official multi-volume biography, as bestowed by W. F. Monypenny and G. E. Buckle on Disraeli, was never produced. Disraeli himself, in his 1852 biography of Lord George Bentinck, portrayed Derby as &#145;a secondary personage in the party and the legislature&#146;  (Monypenny &amp; Buckle, 3.328). Later Disraelian apologists, such as the tory journalist T. E. Kebbel, declared that Derby lacked &#145;any taste for those strategical manoeuvres which are as necessary in politics as in war&#146;  (T. E. Kebbel, <span class="italic">A History of Toryism</span>, 1886, 332). Although Kebbel's 1890 memoir of Derby was more generous, the short biography by the tory writer George Saintsbury, published in 1892, concluded that Derby, despite his talents, &#145;had no consistent or thoroughgoing theory of politics&#146;  (G. E. Saintsbury, <span class="italic">Lord Derby</span>, 1892, 199). The appearance of Charles Greville's <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> in 1888, edited by Henry Reeve, gave further ammunition to Derby's detractors, as Greville believed Derby, whom he deeply disliked on a personal level, was too much affected by &#145;the Newmarket style of life&#146; to be a serious politician  (<span class="italic">The Greville Memoirs, 1814&#150;1860</span>, ed. G. L. Strachey and R. Fulford, 1938, 6.457). Thus Derby became conventionally portrayed as either a frivolous or apathetic aristocratic politician devoid, as one modern historian has described it, of &#145;the qualities of ambition and dedication normally necessary for successful party leadership&#146;  (J. B. Conacher, &#145;Party politics in the age of Palmerston&#146;, <span class="italic">1859: Entering an Age of Crisis</span>, ed. P. Appleman and others, 1959, 166). Recent historical scholarship has begun to revise this verdict, recognizing that Derby's insouciant manner and passion for the turf were not proof of a lack of political seriousness; although to date, 130 years after Derby's death, no full study of his complete career, based upon his papers and correspondence (now housed at the Liverpool Record Office), has yet been published.<br>
