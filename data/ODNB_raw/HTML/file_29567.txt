<span class="headword">Williamson, Sir  Adam</span>  (1733/4&#150;1798), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial governor</span>, was the son of Lieutenant-General George Williamson (1707?&#150;1781), who commanded the Royal Artillery during operations in North America from 1758 to 1760. He was admitted to Westminster School in October 1744, aged ten, became a cadet gunner on 1 January 1748, and entered the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich in 1750. After graduating as a practitioner engineer on 1 January 1753 he went the following year to North America. He served as an engineer in Braddock's expedition to Virginia in 1755 and was wounded during the defeat at Monongahela. On 14 October he was commissioned ensign in the 6th foot. He was at the surrender of Fort William Henry in August 1757, was promoted lieutenant in the 5th foot on 25 September, and was given a staff appointment as lieutenant and engineer-extraordinary on 4 January 1758. In this capacity he served at the capture of Louisburg in July 1758 and the taking of Quebec a year later, when he was wounded again. Having been appointed captain in the 40th foot on 21 April 1760, he distinguished himself during the capture of L'Isle Royale the following August. At the end of the year he accompanied his father to England on leave of absence.<br>
<br>Williamson was sent back to North America in 1761, and joined the expeditions to the West Indies that captured Martinique in February 1762 and Havana in August. He returned to England in 1763. In 1770 he was promoted major in the 16th foot and engineer-in-ordinary, and later he was transferred to the 61st foot; he was promoted lieutenant-colonel in the army on 12 September 1775. He married at Woolwich on 10 August 1771 Ann Jones, the daughter of Thomas Jones of East Wickham, Kent. As lieutenant-colonel of the 18th Royal Irish regiment, he ceased his engineering duties and returned to active service in North America, where he participated in the battle of Bunker Hill (June 1775). After his return to England in July 1776 he was appointed deputy adjutant-general of the forces in south Britain on 23 December 1778. He achieved promotion to colonel in the army on 15 February 1782 and major-general on 28 April 1790, and became colonel of the 47th foot on 16 July 1790; he transferred to the 72nd highlanders in March 1794.<br>
<br>In July 1789 Williamson and his wife inherited Avebury Manor from her uncle. Williamson, however, had little time to enjoy his new home, for late in 1790, when war with Spain threatened, he was sent as lieutenant-governor and garrison commander to Jamaica, Britain's most important colony. He replaced the governor following the latter's death in November 1791. Deferential to the colonial assembly and lax in enforcing the laws of trade, he proved popular with the planters. He won praise for his &#145;mildness&#146; and for maintaining calm after the outbreak of a major slave uprising in nearby St Domingue. Several of its white colonists sought refuge in Jamaica and requested that Britain take over the French colony. Williamson cultivated these contacts, for St Domingue was a source of enormous wealth. Following the outbreak of war in 1793 he received permission to send troops to those areas that would accept a British protectorate. In September there began a tenuous five-year military occupation. Slave owners welcomed the British forces into much of western and southern St Domingue, and plantation production revived. Ultimately, however, their alliance could make little headway against the burgeoning insurrection among the enslaved and free coloured populations. Troops sent from Europe were vastly outnumbered and died quickly from disease. Yet, in the optimism following the capture of Port-au-Prince on 4 June 1794, Williamson was made a knight of the Bath on 18 November and governor of St Domingue, where he arrived on 26 May 1795.<br>
<br>The governor had to implement an experiment in what later became crown colony government. Reintroducing civil administration into a society torn apart by the French Revolution proved a delicate task. Although Williamson generally had a good word for everyone, his favouring of radical Anglophile colonists over conservative &eacute;migr&eacute;s from France was received badly in Whitehall. The occupation, moreover, became notorious for military losses and escalating costs. Yellow fever, inflation, and the guerrilla warfare of the insurgents doomed the expedition. Williamson expanded the use of black soldiers but was unable to reduce the death rate of British troops. Instructed to foster colonial support for British rule, the humane and generous governor spent lavishly, both his own money and the government's. Since he was fluent in French and fond of late-night drinking and story-telling, he was well liked by wealthy colonists, but, indulgent and overworked, he allowed corruption to flourish around him.<br>
<br>Perceived as a lax administrator and poor judge of men, Williamson was recalled in October 1795; he left the colony on 14 March 1796. His final promotion was as lieutenant-general, on 26 January 1797. He died from the effects of a violent fall at his Avebury home on 21 October 1798 and was buried in the parish church. His wife had predeceased him and in his will he bequeathed Avebury Manor to her nephew Richard Jones. A Haitian hamlet north of Port-au-Prince still bears his name.<br>
