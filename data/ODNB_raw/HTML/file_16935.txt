<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Loftus,  Adam</span>, first Viscount Loftus of Ely  (1568&#150;1643), <span class="occ">lord chancellor of Ireland</span>, was the second son of Robert Loftus (<i>d</i>. 1606) of Coverham in Yorkshire; his mother is unknown. His uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16934/', "Archbishop Adam Loftus")</script> of Dublin, also held the Irish chancellorship from 1578 until his death in 1605.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsandadvancement"></a>Early years and advancement</h2>Loftus matriculated from Jesus College, Cambridge, in 1586, graduating BA in the same year and proceeding MA in 1589. Three years later he appears as a member of Thavies Inn, subsequently entering Lincoln's Inn. Archbishop Loftus arranged preferments for his nephew in Ireland. In 1594 he appointed him archdeacon of Glendalough and Loftus retained the benefice until his death, despite never being <i>presbyteri canonici</i>, Archbishop Laud's disapproval, and an adverse judicial ruling in 1638. Three years later, in 1597, he married Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1650), widow of Richard Meredyth, bishop of Leighlin, and daughter of one Bathoe. They had four sons and two daughters. The same year he was made judge of the marshal court, in peaceful times a sinecure but not so when Loftus secured the post nor later, in 1608, during the repression of O'Doherty's rebellion. In 1598 he became a master in chancery. While his uncle was alive Loftus deputized on occasion for him in chancery and in the court of the prerogative as well as acting as his vicar-general. When he was created LLD, as has been claimed, is obscure.<br>
<br>Further advancement followed: a knighthood (1604), membership of the Irish privy council (1608), constable of Maryborough Castle (1611), and judge of the new Irish admiralty court (1612). This last appointment involved Loftus in questions of patronage and jurisdiction. He was thus soon to spend &pound;200 in litigation to wrest the appointment of water bailiff back from the city of Dublin. Very much later, in 1637, he was to object to incursions into his admiralty jurisdiction by the common law courts, the corporate towns, and the manor courts. From 1613 to 1615 he sat in the Irish House of Commons as a member for King's county. The main prize, the lord chancellorship, fell into his hands in 1619. Early that year, the then chancellor, Archbishop Thomas Jones, Archbishop Loftus's successor, died. There were two contestants for the vacancy&#151;Sir Francis Aungier, the master of the rolls, and Loftus. Offered &pound;1000 by Loftus, the duke of Buckingham, then, as ever, in need of ready cash, made the self-evident choice: formal appointment by James I, on 13 May 1619, followed swiftly. More honours ensued. In May 1622 James raised Loftus to the peerage as Viscount Loftus of Ely: the viscountcy was intended, as the fulsome language of the accompanying patent had it, to &#145;descend upon his posteritie for his sake that thereby his vertues may be recorded for future ages, soe longe as there shall remaine an heire male of his howse&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ninth Report</span>, HMC, 2.303). The chancellor, meanwhile, at this point was associated with key investigations into the condition of church and state in Ireland&#151;of which the king's directions for the courts of 1622 were one outcome&#151;and into the Ulster plantation. In 1622, in the absence of a lord deputy, Loftus served alongside Viscount Powerscourt as lord justice. Further periods as lord justice followed&#151;in 1629&#150;33 alongside Richard Boyle, the earl of Cork, and in 1636 alongside Sir Christopher Wandesford.<h2>
<a name="QuarrelsandthefallofFalkland"></a>Quarrels and the fall of Falkland</h2>Proud, overbearing, and jealous of his position&#151;traits hardly in short supply in the king's servants of the period&#151;Loftus was to prove a tiresome colleague for those with whom he was teamed in the administration. Quarrels were frequent and a source of annoyance in England to Buckingham, who had, after all, secured him the chancellorship, and, following the latter's assassination, even to Charles I. In 1625 Loftus complained to the privy council at the level of his remuneration, alleging that an undertaking given on his appointment as judge marshal that he would receive 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. per diem had not been honoured:<blockquote>I have only &pound;300 p.a. How farr short this poore some is of a competent maintenance for so great and chargible a place, and what disproportion there must needs be between my receipts and disbursments, and what contempt and other inconveniences the pooreness of this fee may bringe, I know your Lordshipps will in your greate wisdome redely apprehend. (<span class="italic">Ninth Report</span>, HMC, 2.294)</blockquote>A king's letter wrought a modest amelioration, promising Loftus a moiety of all fines charged on writs issuing from the Irish chancery. How hard-pressed at this period Loftus actually was is impossible to determine. It may be significant that when, in October 1639, William Weston accused Loftus of having taken bribes, this was ascribed to the years 1620 to 1623 when Weston said he gave Lady Loftus, among other things, &#145;one suit of hangings of the value of &pound;160, one dozen of silver plates with his lordship's arms thereupon [and] 32 ells [of] Polonie rich taffetie&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1633&#150;47</i>, 225).<br>
<br>Meanwhile, a major row was brewing with Henry Cary, Viscount Falkland, appointed lord deputy in 1622. Loftus had declined to sign fiants for grants of a tannery and a distillery; he had also refused to accept Falkland's nominations of judges to serve on the assize circuits and of JPs. In a letter to Falkland, Loftus stood his ground:<blockquote>If the sole command of the seal be in his Lordship's [Falkland's] power, vain and needless is the place of a Chancellor, and profane and impious were his oath taken at his entrance, if his conscience should be subject to the will and command of any other person. (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1615&#150;25</i>, 533)</blockquote>Falkland was not convinced, and replied dubbing Loftus's suggestion of a reference to the judges &#145;a specious subterfuge to color a disobedience&#146;  (ibid., 540). Falkland took steps to guard his position and, if possible, obtain the removal of the lord chancellor. Allegations reached London that Loftus had orchestrated opposition to Falkland over the financial negotiations of 1627 and, potentially more damning, allegations, too, of miscarriages of justice in the Irish chancery. A detailed list of such supposed miscarriages, meticulously, if anonymously, prepared, survives in the state papers. Loftus was called to London in June 1627 to justify his conduct. The result, announced before Loftus's return in August 1628, was his total vindication. The irony of this in light of Charles I's verdict on Loftus in not totally dissimilar circumstances a decade later cannot have been lost on contemporaries. A consequential instruction of the king's the following year must have been a particularly bitter pill for Falkland to swallow. It was, wrote Charles, &#145;just and fit that all those that have preferred any scandalous and false informations or charges against our Chancellor, for his carriage in the execution of his office, be proceeded against in our High Court of Castle Chamber&#146;  (Morrin, 3.464).<h2>
<a name="LoftusandtheearlofCork"></a>Loftus and the earl of Cork</h2>Between the recall of Falkland in the autumn of 1629 and the arrival of Viscount Thomas Wentworth, the future earl of Strafford, in the summer of 1633, the post of chief governor was shared by Loftus and Cork as lords justices. It was a strange alliance, stranger still that the king had endorsed it. Cork had earlier complained of the &#145;affronts and storms&#146; he had encountered in legal proceedings before Loftus  (Ball, 1.327), as a consequence of which Charles had rebuked his lord chancellor for failing to ensure that Cork received impartial justice; and a factor in Loftus's quarrel with Falkland had been the latter's nomination of a kinsman of Cork's to ride an assize circuit where lawsuits involving Cork were pending. So far as most items of official business were concerned the two preserved a united front. In the first months of office they thus both signed the decree ordering the suppression of religious houses throughout the kingdom, and in September 1632 they jointly ordered the destruction of buildings at St Patrick's Purgatory on Lough Derg in co. Donegal, in Queen Henrietta Maria's book an act of sacrilege over which she was later to protest to Wentworth. They were in unison, too, over the revival of recusancy fines. But the animosity between the two men&#151;its precise origin is unclear&#151;went deep, and could flare up on the least provocation. Gifts from Cork to Loftus of goshawks, falcons, and wine (not, so far as is known, reciprocated) and attempts by the king to secure the formal reconciliation of the two men&#151;ordering handshakes before witnesses&#151;achieved nothing. The capacity of both Loftus and Cork to use intemperate language to each other helped keep the relationship poisonous. Such an altercation occurred as the two accompanied Wentworth to Christ Church Cathedral on the day Wentworth was sworn in. And in 1635, at a meeting of the Irish council where the continuance of a lawsuit against Cork following a plaintiff's death was being debated, Cork attacked Loftus for expressing an opinion hostile to his own, whereupon Loftus, moved to anger, responded that he cared &#145;not a rush&#146; for Boyle  (Grosart, 1st ser., 4.109&#150;10). At this uproar erupted.<br>
<br>Wentworth's installation as lord deputy signalled a complete change in the fortunes of the two erstwhile lords justices, and for the worse. Of the two Cork became the first casualty: in 1636 he was forced to purchase at a huge price immunity from a prospective castle chamber prosecution connected to his unscrupulous land dealings in Munster. If Loftus had already been targeted Wentworth for the moment at least played a waiting game. There were even conspicuous displays of friendship and support. In 1634 he wrote to the lords of the admiralty in London backing Loftus's claims to patronage in the Irish admiralty: &#145;I have a high opinion of his loyalty, and do not think the Chancellorship (not worth above &pound;400 a year) is as well paid as it should be&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1633&#150;47</i>, 72).<h2>
<a name="Wentworthdownfallanddisgrace"></a>Wentworth, downfall, and disgrace</h2>A brutal exchange of letters between Loftus and Wentworth over the choice of barrister to replace Serjeant Catlyn on the Leinster circuit after Catlyn's sudden death in April 1637 marked a deterioration of the relationship. But already there had been set in train a sequence of events that was to lead to Loftus's downfall and disgrace. Accused in February 1637 by Sir John Gifford, the half-brother of his daughter-in-law, Elinor, of failure to honour a promise to provide a settlement on the marriage of his eldest son, Sir Robert Loftus, and Elinor back in 1621, the lord chancellor was eventually, on 1 February 1638, found at fault by the council board presided over by Wentworth and ordered to make the necessary financial arrangements. Sir Robert and Elinor had lived with the lord chancellor in his house and at his expense until shortly before Gifford voiced his complaint. Elinor's sister's husband was none other than Sir George Wentworth, the lord deputy's younger brother. When Elinor died in May 1639 the lord deputy penned an extraordinary tribute. &#145;With her&#146;, he wrote, &#145;are gone the greatest part of my affections to the country, and all that is left of them shall be thankfully, and religiously paid to her excellent memory&#146;  (letter to Lord Conway, <span class="italic">Ninth Report</span>, HMC, 2.298). In such circumstances, but not least because there was found but a single witness to the promise Loftus was supposed to have given in 1621, suspicion necessarily attaches to Gifford's bona fides and, indeed, to Wentworth's role in the entire affair.<br>
<br>Yet for Loftus much worse was to come. Found contumacious in April 1638 for failing to comply with the decree of 1 February and for insults to Wentworth he was superseded from office and sent as a prisoner to Dublin Castle. And there he lingered until a bout of ill health secured a temporary respite in May 1639 and final release the ensuing July or August, having in the end complied with the decree of February 1638, apologized abjectly for his contempts, and in substantial measure beggared himself. The ferocity of the reported exchanges between Wentworth and Loftus during the latter's trial makes it hard to accept that they could ever have been on friendly terms. Loftus refused to kneel to receive his sentence on 20 April 1638. &#145;The Great Seal&#146;, he protested, &#145;ought not to creep on knees and elbows to any subordinate person in the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">Various Collections</span>, 3. 171). The next day, with Loftus still refusing to surrender the seal, Wentworth is reputed to have remarked that he &#145;did once believe he should never have been able truly to have said that he was sorry his Lordship was lodged so near him&#146;  (ibid.). Loftus appealed against his sentence to the king, but Charles dismissed this, and in December 1639 Sir Richard Bolton was named lord chancellor in his stead. Wentworth took no risks over the king's handling of the appeal. In the intervening months a great deal of new material was assembled touching on Loftus's conduct as a judge&#151;material that included Weston's story of the acceptance of bribes&#151;all of which helped to traduce the lord chancellor's character still further. Some items in the dossier, for example, Loftus's supposed violations of articles 18 and 21 of the king's directions for the courts of 1622 (which, ironically, Loftus as a lord justice that year had promulgated), however, do possess the ring of truth.<h2>
<a name="Lastyears"></a>Last years</h2>Loftus lost considerable property, in excess of &pound;10,000 in value, as a result of the Irish rising of October 1641. Soon afterwards he removed to Yorkshire, where he died at Middleham in the North Riding early in 1643. He was buried later that year at Coverham church. His widow died seven years later. Sir Robert Loftus, his eldest son, predeceased him. Alice, his younger daughter, married the second Viscount Moore of Drogheda. During her father's incarceration she had vainly petitioned the king on his behalf, earning from Wentworth the scarcely flattering description of Loftus's &#145;unclean mouth'd daughter&#146;  (letter to Sir John Wintour, 10 Dec 1638, <span class="italic">Ninth Report</span>, HMC, 2.297).<br>
<br>In the articles of impeachment drawn up against Wentworth in 1641, his conduct in <i>Gifford v. Loftus</i> received specific mention. The decree of February 1638 was itself set aside by the English House of Lords in May 1642: the decision ordered the conveyance back to the former chancellor of the lands taken from him. Reverberations from the great cause lasted down to 1678. The successor to the viscountcy in 1643, Loftus's second son, Sir Edward, faced an uphill struggle to obtain enforcement of the Lords' ruling of 1642. Pitted against him, in a series of fascinating, if tortuous, English and Irish lawsuits (easily followed through <span class="italic">Ninth Report</span>, HMC, and <span class="italic">Various Collections</span>, vol. 3) which happened to necessitate, on separate occasions, the interventions of Oliver Cromwell and Charles II&#151;was Sir Robert and Elinor's daughter Anne, and, after the latter's death in 1659, Dacre Barrett, her son and heir.<br>
