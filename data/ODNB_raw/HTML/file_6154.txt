<span class="headword">Cooke,  Alexander</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1564, <em>d.</em> 1632), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious controversialist</span>, was born at Beeston, near Leeds, Yorkshire, the second son of William Gayle or Cooke, and baptized there on 3 September 1564. After Leeds grammar school he followed his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6175/', "Robert Cooke (1549/50&#150;1615)")</script>, to Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1581, graduating BA in 1585. In 1587 he was elected to a Percy fellowship at University College, proceeding MA in 1588 and BD in 1596. Cooke returned to Yorkshire, where his strongly anti-Catholic views were employed in preaching to the recusant prisoners in York Castle in 1600, and on 5 February 1601 he was instituted to the important royal living of Louth in Lincolnshire. Cooke was appointed one of the select preachers at the accession of James I in 1603, but in the following year his puritan principles landed him in trouble with the diocesan authorities at Lincoln and he was deprived of his living on 30 October 1604 for refusing to wear the surplice.<br>
<br>Cooke then again returned to Yorkshire to assist, in the capacity of curate, his brother Robert, who as vicar of Leeds was instrumental in establishing a vigorous protestant tradition there. The brothers made a formidable partnership which attracted the support of many of the leading townsmen so that, when Robert died in 1615, a group of them persuaded the archbishop of York, Tobie Matthew, to bypass the surviving owners of the advowson&#151;also local worthies, who had hoped to appoint to the vicarage Richard Middleton, a chaplain to Prince Charles&#151;and to place Cooke in the living instead. A suit in chancery followed. This was settled in Cooke's favour in August 1617 when the right of presentation was confirmed in a self-perpetuating body of twenty-five trustees, mostly local lay sympathizers of Cooke and his brand of churchmanship, but also including John Favour, vicar of Halifax, and other puritan clergy of the area associated with the exercise at Halifax at which Cooke had been a preacher.<br>
<br>Though it met with vociferous opposition from some quarters, Cooke's subsequent ministry in the town was both purposeful and authoritative; he preached against popular festivals, including Christmas, and was firm in his opposition to the alehouse, denouncing from the pulpit by name those who had failed to live up to his godly standards. More positively, his ministry produced a flowering of puritan piety in Leeds and its chapelries, best expressed in the charitable giving to the poor and in support for clergy and educational institutions during the 1620s and 1630s. This was given institutional direction through the committee for pious uses established for the parish in 1619, and Cooke's supporters also formed the nucleus of the corporation set up by royal charter in 1626 giving the town self-government and releasing it from control of the manor.<br>
<br>Cooke's renowned anti-Catholic views were well known in senior ecclesiastical circles and brought him to the attention of Matthew, who encouraged him to publish controversial works, the first of which, <span class="italic">Pope Joane: a dialogue betweene a protestant and a papist, manifestly proving that a woman called Joane was pope of Rome</span>, was published in 1610, and in the course of the well-known argument pilloried the views of Bellarmine. A second edition followed in 1625 and a French translation was published in 1633, but Cooke's most popular controversial work in his lifetime was his more substantial <span class="italic">Work for a Mass-Priest</span>, first published in 1617, and going through four further amplified editions in the author's lifetime.<br>
<br>In addition to his public opposition to popery, Cooke was thought to be a vigorous critic of the Arminians in private. His controversial style also affected his pastoral ministry, which was disturbed between 1619 and 1622 by a cause in Star Chamber between Cooke and John Metcalf, the bailiff of Leeds manor, over a variety of issues which had much to do with the administration of local charities and the traditional loyalties of the latter in matters of religion. Not withstanding these problems, Cooke's legacy to the religious and cultural temper of seventeenth-century Leeds was substantial and in the years immediately after his death several endowments were made to the outlying chapelries of the parish and a new chapel, St John's, established in the town. Cooke died in 1632 and was buried in his parish church on 23 June next to his brother Robert. He was survived by his wife, Anne, and three children, to whom he left his books, which later formed the nucleus of a library for St John's Chapel.<br>
