<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Blackie,  Margery Grace</span>  (1898&#150;1981), <span class="occ">homoeopathic physician</span>, was born on 4 February 1898 at Redbourn, Hertfordshire. She was the youngest of ten children of Robert Blackie (<i>c</i>.1852&#150;1936), a man of independent means, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1941), daughter of Rowland Rees, civil engineer and architect. Her mother's family were ardent supporters of homoeopathy and Elizabeth's sister Katherine married James Compton Burnett, an eminent homoeopathic physician and father of the novelist Ivy Compton Burnett.<br>
<br>In 1911 the Blackie family moved to London where Margery attended the Haberdashers' Aske's School for Girls in Acton. At an early age she determined upon a medical career and in 1917 entered the London School of Medicine for Women. She was by no means a brilliant student. Her path to qualification included several failed examinations. In 1923 she eventually qualified as a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians and a member of the Royal College of Surgeons. Three years later she passed, at the second attempt, the examination for the London University degree of MB BS. However within two years she proceeded MD at the early age of thirty.<br>
<br>Immediately after qualification Blackie became resident medical officer at the London Homoeopathic Hospital, where she added to the knowledge of the homoeopathy she had gained from her family. She came under the particular influence of Douglas Borland and John Weir, who were two of the first British doctors to study under James Tyler Kent in the United States. She never deviated from her devotion to his principles, and his advocacy of the use of high potency remedies. After the completion of her residency in 1926 Blackie had opened a practice at 10 Drayton Gardens, Fulham, but also resurrected a defunct homoeopathic dispensary at 68B Fulham Road. Although she always regarded herself as a general practitioner she continued to work at the hospital, becoming assistant physician to the children's department in 1929 and, years later, physician in charge of out-patients. At the end of the decade she moved to 18 Thurloe Street, Kensington, where she remained for the rest of her working life in partnership with Helen Banks (<i>d</i>. 1971).<br>
<br>Blackie kept up to date with developments in medicine, and was respected by her medically more conventional colleagues, consulting them whenever she thought it necessary. She was a remarkable homoeopath, who attracted patients from all over the country and, indeed, the world. Her ability was recognized in 1969 when she was appointed physician to the queen in succession to Sir John Weir. Although her prime concern was always the welfare of the patient she came to recognize the need for research that would demonstrate the effectiveness of homoeopathy. In 1971 she founded the Blackie Foundation Trust to encourage education and research.<br>
<br>In 1965, having already served as president, Blackie was appointed dean of the Faculty of Homoeopathy. She reorganized teaching and ran three week-long courses per year. These grew from small beginnings to serve up to one hundred students per course. She did not hesitate to write personally to doctors who she thought would become good homoeopaths, to encourage them to attend. She was persistent in her pressure upon those she wanted as lecturers so that few ultimately refused her. At her own expense she entertained students to a fork supper at Thurloe Street and to a dinner at a Bloomsbury hotel. A number of these students on each course would be selected to attend her surgery at Thurloe Street, where she would demonstrate her methods leading to the selection of a remedy. She always emphasized the advantage of bringing the patient from the waiting room herself, because so much knowledge could be gained from the patient's attitude and from a handshake. She also unwittingly demonstrated her instinctive ability to select the appropriate remedy.<br>
<br>Blackie was a lifelong devout evangelical Christian, greatly influenced in adult life by the Congregational ministers at the Westminster Chapel. She always regarded herself as on call but her long friendship with Musette Majendie, whose home was Hedingham Castle in Essex, enabled her to spend her limited leisure time watching birds, playing croquet and bridge, and solving jigsaw puzzles. Her summer holidays were spent with her friends at Aviemore. While she gave many lectures (a selection of which was published posthumously under the title <span class="italic">Classical Homoeopathy</span>, 1986) she wrote very little and published only one book. <span class="italic">The Patient, not the Cure</span> was published in 1975 and was an anecdotal summary of her ideas on homoeopathy. In later life Blackie contracted and recovered from rheumatoid arthritis, but a broken hip eventually led to her retirement in 1980. She resigned from her appointment as physician to the queen in June 1979. She received the honour of CVO in recognition of her devoted service to the royal family. Blackie spent her final year at Hedingham, becoming increasingly frail, although her bedside reading remained what it had always been, the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and Kent's <span class="italic">Homeopathic materia medica</span>, which sum up her main interests in life.<br>
<br>Blackie had an excellent memory for names. She was polite and meticulous about punctuality, although delays such as traffic jams were accepted with patience. Always well dressed she evolved and kept to her own smart bright style with the assistance of Peter Crown of La Chasse, a London fashion house. Margery Blackie died peacefully of a stroke on 24 August 1981 and was buried on 29 August at Castle Hedingham.<br>
