<span class="headword">Slatin, Sir  Rudolf Carl  von</span>  (1857&#150;1932), <span class="occ">colonial governor and author</span>, was born on 27 June 1857 at Ober Sankt Veit, near Vienna, the fourth of six children born to Michael Slatin, a silk dyer, and his wife, Maria Anna Feuerstein, who was born in Lw&oacute;w (Lemberg). Slatin's grandfather was a Jew who had been converted to Catholicism. The family lived at 1 Wolfrathplatz, where their six children were born between 1852 and 1864. Rudolf was baptized Rudolf Anton in the Catholic church at Ober Sankt Veit, but was later known as Rudolf Carl. He entered Oberrealschule am Schottenfelde in September 1866, but his academic record was poor and he left school after three years. In 1870 he entered a commercial school in Vienna, the Wiener Handelsakademie, and graduated three years later.<br>
<br>Aged sixteen, Slatin was eager to begin a life of adventure. Chance decided that it was to be in Egypt, where a bookseller was in need of a clerk and a tutor for his sons. Slatin spent a few months as tutor and left for a trip up the Nile. Once the boat reached Korosko in Turco-Egyptian Sudan, he continued by camel to Berber and then to Khartoum, where he spent two months. He left Khartoum for the Nuba Mountains in southern Kordofan, but for reasons of security was ordered back. Chance intervened when he met Edward Schnitzer&#151;better known by his Muslim name, Emin Pasha&#151;who was about to join the Egyptian service in Equatoria under the governorship of General Charles Gordon. Slatin asked Emin to recommend him to Gordon's attention for future employment. In December 1875 Slatin returned to Vienna and joined the Austrian army, serving with the 18th Bohemian infantry regiment. In December 1877 he was posted to the 19th Hungarian regiment as a sub-lieutenant for service in the lines. In July 1878 Gordon Pasha, now governor-general of Turco-Egyptian Sudan, invited Slatin to join his staff in Khartoum and he accepted eagerly.<br>
<br>Slatin's career in the Sudan covered thirty-six eventful years. He started in January 1879 in the finance department as an inspector with the rank of a <i>bimbashi</i> (the Turkish equivalent of a major). Later that year he was appointed governor of Dara, in south-western Darfur, and after less than a year became governor-general of the whole province. In his major publication <span class="italic">Fire and Sword in the Sudan</span> (1896) Slatin was vague about his duties in Darfur. However, his life as governor-general was soon disrupted by Muhammad Ahmad ibn &#145;Abdullahi, who in June 1881 declared himself the <i>Mahdi</i> of the Sudan. Soon the Mahdi and his followers (<i>ansar</i>) escaped from Aba Island, on the White Nile, to the Nuba Mountains and Slatin became actively involved in the uprising. Many of the tribal and religious leaders in Darfur joined the Mahdi. Slatin led his troops in numerous battles against the Mahdist forces and lost many soldiers. In January 1883 al-&#145;Ubayd, capital of Kordofan, fell into Mahdist hands and Darfur was cut off from Khartoum. Slatin decided &#145;nominally to adopt the Mohammedan religion&#146; since he was told by his Egyptian and Sudanese followers that they had lost confidence in his ability, as a Christian, to win the war against the Mahdi. &#145;I am not a foreigner, I am not an unbeliever&#146;, he responded, &#145;I am as much a believer as you &hellip; I bear witness that there is no God but God and Mohammed is his Prophet&#146;  (Slatin, 216&#150;17). However, disastrous defeats at the battle of Shaykan in November 1883 and the fall of al-Fasher, capital of Darfur, convinced Slatin to surrender. He sent a letter to the Mahdi in al-&#145;Ubayd declaring his submission and in December 1883 he and his troops surrendered at Dara. Slatin was renamed &#145;Abd al-Qadir Salatin, a name he carried thereafter.<br>
<br>From 1884 to 1895 Slatin was a prisoner, first of the Mahdi and, following his death in 1885, of Caliph &#145;Abdullahi al-Ta &#145;aishi. After a brief period in Dara, where he was allowed to live in his old house and keep his servants, Slatin was ordered to join the Mahdi's camp at al-&#145;Ubayd and to take part in the march to Khartoum. During the siege of Khartoum, Slatin was asked by the Mahdi to write on his behalf to General Gordon and seek his surrender. Slatin, according to his account, attempted to explain to Gordon the circumstances of his conversion to Islam and to justify his surrender. Gordon was willing to forgive Slatin's surrender but not his conversion to Islam. After the Mahdi's death Slatin became the caliph's orderly, and was entrusted with confidential administrative and financial duties. He described the caliph as a &#145;cruel beast&#146; and accused him of brutalities, but failed to mention how kindly he and some of the other European prisoners were treated. During this period Slatin apparently had two wives, Hassaniyyah, a Fur girl he brought with him when he surrendered to the Mahdi in December 1883, and an Abyssinian, Desta, who bore him a child shortly after his escape from Omdurman in 1895; the child died after a few weeks  (Neufeld, 206&#150;7). He left both women behind when he escaped in 1895.<br>
<br>Slatin's problematic relations with the caliph may also be observed in a letter he wrote to the caliph from Cairo on 6 April 1895, some six weeks after his escape from the Sudan. In this letter Slatin asked his former patron to continue to rely on his love and loyalty and to disregard any rumours to the contrary emanating from Cairo. He ended his letter by asking the caliph to forgive him for having left Omdurman without notifying him and offered to return to his service once he received his letter of pardon  (Slatin to Caliph &#145;Abdullahi, 6 April 1895, Durham University Library, Sudan archive, SAD/100/20).<br>
<br>Of Slatin's value as an intelligence agent there are conflicting views. Few of the communications he smuggled to Cairo contained valuable information. Colonel Reginald Wingate, who since 1887 had served in the military intelligence department of the Egyptian army, ignored most of them as probably written under duress. For intelligence purposes he needed Slatin in Cairo, where he could interrogate him freely. On 20 February 1895 Slatin escaped from Omdurman, led by two guides hired by the intelligence department. He arrived in Cairo on 19 March and was met by Wingate at the railway station. Two days later the Egyptian khedive, Abbas II, received him and raised him to the grade of pasha. His detailed intelligence report to Wingate was entitled &#145;General report on the Egyptian Sudan, March 1895, compiled from statements made by Slatin Pasha&#146;. Wingate, who helped Slatin to write his memoirs, worked to convince the British government and public opinion that the Sudan had to be reconquered because of the caliph's cruel autocracy, and Slatin's literary contributions were both timely and essential. <span class="italic">Fire and Sword in the Sudan</span> was published in English in 1896 and was dedicated to Queen Victoria. Its impact on public opinion in Europe was greater than Wingate had expected. It appeared in numerous editions until 1935, and was translated into German, Italian, French, and Arabic. Slatin spent several months of leave, partly with his family in Austria and partly in travelling throughout Europe, receiving decorations from heads of state and lecturing at geographical societies. He had become a celebrity and seemed to enjoy it.<br>
<br>From 1896 to 1898 Slatin was Wingate's assistant director of military intelligence in the Egyptian army. Both were practical and down-to-earth, methodological of mind, and scornful of the abstract. Articulate, uninhibited, and simple, they trusted each other absolutely and became close friends. Although Slatin was a full colonel and a pasha, while Wingate, his superior, was a mere bey and a lieutenant-colonel, this did not affect their close relationship. Their aim was the reconquest of the Sudan and the total destruction of the Mahdist state; nothing else mattered. They therefore cultivated the press, an art at which both men excelled. Eager to return to active service in the Sudan, Slatin was allowed to take part in the final battle, which took place at Karrari, near Omdurman, on 2 September 1898. His knowledge of Omdurman and its people, as well as his fluent command of Arabic, proved to be invaluable.<br>
<br>During the conquest Slatin's views condoning slavery were brought to the attention of Queen Victoria and he was warned to be more careful in future. However, he continued to express his view that black people were inferior and &#145;do not deserve to be treated like free and independent men&#146;, and suggested that black people &#145;should be made to remain under the protection of their former masters&#146;  (Hill, 55&#150;6). The queen forgave Slatin and also overlooked his years as apostate. He became a favourite correspondent and a frequent visitor at Windsor and Balmoral. In 1898 Queen Victoria awarded him a knighthood, and upon his retirement in February 1899 the khedive, Abbas, promoted him to general and granted him a yearly pension. In 1906 he was created a baron of the Austrian&#150;Hungarian empire.<br>
<br>Slatin's retirement did not last long. In the summer of 1900 Wingate, now governor-general, arranged for Slatin's appointment in the Sudan government as inspector-general and director of intelligence. It was, according to Wingate, a personal post which would cease when Slatin left the service. Given his experience and command of Arabic, his position as Wingate's right-hand man was unchallengeable. His duties and authority were never clearly defined but his role was paramount in shaping the government's Islamic and tribal policy. He knew most of the leaders personally and advised on the establishment of a &#145;Board of Ulemas&#146;, arguing that a government consisting of Christians should not interfere in daily decisions regarding Muslims. Slatin decided who would serve on this board and he acted as the liaison officer between the board and the government. He personally kept in touch with former Mahdist leaders, including members of the families of the Mahdi and the caliph, both for intelligence purposes and because of his loyalty to old friends. His idea was to propagate &#145;orthodox&#146; Islam as a barrier against Sufi and Mahdist fanaticism. In April 1913 he wrote to Wingate: &#145;I am expelling 3 fikhis from the Yemen and Hejaz, who were preaching Rott and Nonsense&#146;  (Hill, 93). Slatin was more apprehensive regarding Sufism than he was with regard to a possible Mahdist revival. He knew that most of the condominium's Sudanese employees had previously served in the Mahdist state but did not question their loyalty. Slatin himself lacked religious zeal of any kind. Christian missionaries were forbidden to proselytize in the Muslim provinces and were ordered to limit their activities, including education, to the non-Muslim regions. In tribal affairs he sought to strengthen family bonds, tribal leadership, and the administration of justice according to tribal law. He believed that by lowering taxes and encouraging tribes to revert to their traditional economies, the government would be relieved of many of its administrative burdens. He relied on his acquaintances, many former Mahdists, in deciding whom to appoint as tribal sheikhs or in other senior positions. Slatin's British colleagues resented his constant interference in their provinces and one of them claimed that &#145;he was not popular among the Sudanese as he was supposed to show favoritism to his pals among the tribes&#146;  (Butler, journal, 1911, Durham University Library, Sudan archive, 422/12). However, with Wingate's unrelenting support Slatin's position was maintained. On Slatin's departure in 1914 following the outbreak of the First World War the position of inspector-general ceased to exist.<br>
<br>For Slatin it was a difficult decision: he was fifty-seven years old and had served under the British crown for most of his life. Due to his superior knowledge of Turkey and the Middle East he was asked occasionally by the Austrian authorities to give advice. In December 1914 the khedive, Abbas, met Slatin in Vienna and offered to appoint him as his general aide-de-camp, for the duration of the war. Slatin turned the offer down since he did not want to commit himself to active participation in the war against England. His sole active service was in the Austrian Red Cross, in which he served as unpaid head of the division for prisoners of war. In this capacity he also did his best for British prisoners of war in Austrian captivity. However, with the patriotic feelings prevailing in Europe, the British press frequently slandered Slatin as a double-crosser. Wingate came to his defence whenever he could, but the misrepresentations prevailed.<br>
<br>When the war ended Slatin was included in the Austrian delegation to the peace conference and in October 1919 he was offered the post of Austrian minister in London. He declined because of ill health and lack of financial means. During his years of retirement he often travelled to England where he saw Wingate and other old friends who had served with him in the Sudan. He also met George V. On 21 July 1914 he had married Baroness Alice von Ramberg (1873&#150;1921). The couple had a daughter, but Alice died from cancer on 26 June 1921. In the winter of 1927 he made his last visit to the Sudan, as the guest of Sir John Maffey, the new governor-general. He wrote to Wingate following the visit and commented favourably on the vast Gezira irrigation scheme, which Wingate and he had initiated in 1913, but criticized the glorification of Sayyid &#145;Abd al-Rahman al-Mahdi, the Mahdi's posthumous son. In his last diary, covering 1932, he noted on 16 March: &#145;Today it is 37 years that I reached Assouan on my escape from Omdurman&#146;  (Sudan archive, 441). He died on 4 October 1932 at the Cottage Nursing Home, Vienna, Austria, and was buried at Ober Sankt Viet.<br>
