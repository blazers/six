<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Clegg, Sir  (John) Charles</span>  (1850&#150;1937), <span class="occ">football administrator</span>, was born in Sheffield on 15 June 1850, the eldest son of William Johnson Clegg (<i>d</i>. 1895) and his wife, Mary (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Sykes). His father was an ambitious solicitor and politician, active in the temperance movement, who became mayor of Sheffield. Charles's first public appearance was alongside his father on a temperance platform at the age of seven. He was educated in Sheffield and later at Gainford School, Darlington, alongside many other sons of well-to-do northerners. Clegg soon displayed unusual athletic talents and after returning to Sheffield in 1866 to train as a solicitor established himself as an unbeatable quarter-mile runner. He seems to have thought nothing of competing (usually successfully) for several different events on the same afternoon. Clegg later implied that it was the prevalence of betting that drove him out of local athletics, and football, then in its first few years as an organized sport, became his sole sporting passion. He and his brother William (W. E.) Clegg (1852&#150;1932) were among the first local players to earn wider renown, by playing for Sheffield Wednesday and various representative sides. Charles was even chosen for the first ever football international, England v. Scotland in 1872: but it was a bitter experience. Clegg scarcely got a kick and became convinced that his mostly old school and varsity team mates were deliberately not passing to him: as he recalled, &#145;Some members of the England eleven were awful snobs and not much troubled about a &#147;man fra' Sheffield&#148;&#146;  (J. A. H. Catton, <span class="italic">Wickets and Goals</span>, 1926, 171).<br>
<br>The year 1872 was important for Clegg in other ways. He qualified as a solicitor, joined his father's firm, and married a young woman from Manchester, Mary Sayles (<i>d</i>. 1933). He followed his father into the temperance movement, became a stern opponent of gambling, and served as a Liberal city councillor in the late 1870s and early 1880s. But it was his brother William who was to emulate the father's political successes. Charles took up a more daunting challenge: that of imposing his own vision on the new and increasingly complex phenomenon of a mass sport. The original gentlemanly and clerical patrons of football had seen it wholeheartedly embraced by the populace. At local level this infused the game with more traditional popular habits, including betting and brawling. At higher levels gate money was being taken and the players expected to be at least compensated for giving up work to play. Clegg's rise through the ranks of those controlling the sport was rapid. He refereed in 1882 the first Football Association (FA) cup final to feature a team of working-class <i>de facto</i> professionals. In 1886 he forced through the amalgamation of Sheffield football associations and became president of the resultant Sheffield and Hallamshire Football Association (SHFA). This position brought him a seat on the national FA council. The gentlemen of the football establishment could no longer ignore the &#145;man fra' Sheffield&#146;: if the game were to be controlled perhaps a tough northerner with a sharp legal mind, undaunted either by gentleman or player, might be the man to do it.<br>
<br>As a football administrator Clegg became identified with his favourite dictum, &#145;No-one gets lost on a straight road&#146;. But he was more flexible and pragmatic than his reputation allows. A hardline opponent of professional football when it appeared in the early 1880s, he had no problems adapting when the FA recognized professionalism in 1885. Indeed he was a director when the Wednesday turned professional in 1887, was instrumental in the establishment of a second local professional club, Sheffield United, in 1889, and when in 1890 professionalization edged Major Marindin into quitting as FA president, Clegg was elected to the resultant vacancy as FA chairman&#151;the most powerful position in football.<br>
<br>Clegg's belief was that while professionalism was there to stay, the financial side of the game should be tightly controlled so as to preserve something of the old amateur spirit and to ensure that serious corruption did not destroy the game, as he had seen happen to Sheffield athletics. He responded to evidence that Manchester City had been involved in trying to bribe opponents in 1905&#150;6 by conducting a thorough and scrupulous investigation: the ensuing punishments were exemplary and paid no regard to the fame or status of the miscreants. He supported the maximum wage and disliked the Players' Union (PU), with its arguments that players' wages should be fixed by the market instead. Clegg believed that the maximum wage stopped the wealthy clubs from enticing all the best players their way&#151;which to some extent it did&#151;but also clearly felt there was something distasteful in the idea of players getting paid like popular entertainers rather than as sporting artisans. The FA remained firmly opposed when the PU threatened to strike in 1909: the union eventually received some concessions but the strike was averted and the maximum wage survived.<br>
<br>Clegg was equally tough when some southern football associations challenged the FA's authority in the cause of amateurism by demanding the right to exclude professionals. Clegg held the FA firm and by 1914 the amateurs were suing for terms: another victory for the &#145;man fra' Sheffield&#146; over the old school. The latter had their final fling against him when, after the outbreak of war, the football authorities agreed that the professional season should continue. The reaction of various mostly southern clerics and sportsmen so recently dispatched by Clegg in pursuit of a different-shaped ball was swift and hysterical: professional football, they alleged, was encouraging potential military recruits to loaf around on football terraces instead. Clegg was shaken but held firm: it was falling gate receipts rather than moral pressure that eventually persuaded professional football to suspend operations. To his relief George V, who had delighted the FA by attending the 1914 cup final, was indifferent to the controversy and was back in the royal box, when health permitted, in the post-war finals too. Finally, it was under Clegg that the FA and county equivalents established a number of disciplinary committees to deter betting, violence among players and spectators, and lesser irregularities. Clegg was actively involved on these committees. His was a forbidding presence: hair and moustache the colour of high-grade Sheffield steel, clear blue eyes, firm jaw; many players reported that facing him on these committees was always worse than any subsequent punishment.<br>
<br>When Lord Kinnaird died in 1923, Clegg succeeded him as FA president, a less active position. Still president of the SHFA and on the Sheffield United and Wednesday boards, his attendance at committee meetings became more sporadic. He was in his seventies. He was bowed by personal tragedies. His eldest son, William, who had joined the family law firm, died young in 1927. Clegg himself seems to have had a stroke the same year. His younger son Colin died in 1929. His wife's death in 1933 was a particularly severe blow. But despite these setbacks he retained a massive moral influence over the game. He was knighted in 1927 for &#145;services to the Board of Trade and the Ministry of Labour&#146;. This could have been for work with local youth and employment committees: most assumed that Baldwin had recommended football's first knighthood.<br>
<br>Clegg's approach to football was of a piece with his Methodist beliefs and commitments. He and Lady Clegg were temperance activists: he was secretary and later president of the British Temperance League. As late as the 1940s, accordingly, Sheffield United players seeking to make a living outside the game as publicans were being driven out of the club. He remained a fierce opponent of gambling: hence football's unavailing attempts to prevent gambling on the game. He was a regular chapel-goer and inaugurated a special annual service for footballers. He was a magistrate and widely respected official receiver in bankruptcy for Sheffield. Sir Charles Clegg died at his home, Clifton House, 32 Cavendish Road, Sheffield, on 26 June 1937, and was buried four days later in Fulwood churchyard.<br>
<br>One of Clegg's last appearances in public life had been to defend a match between England and the Nazi-sponsored German team near Jewish parts of north London. His view that &#145;politics&#146; should be kept out of sport was looking out of touch. By the time of his death other horrors&#151;a rejuvenated Players' Union, the football pools&#151;were clearly not going to go away. But the game still, and for years later, reflected Clegg's flinty image. It was neither amateur nor fully commercialized. It was neither democratic&#151;Clegg's autocratic attitude to committee meetings and debates invited and received comparisons with Napoleon&#151;nor &eacute;litist. It was popular but respectable enough to be endorsed by royalty and prime ministers. Not for decades was the maximum wage finally removed, a deal with the pools done, or players given freedom of contract. Clegg may have been more pragmatic than he liked to let on, but that he so successfully stamped his own values on the first modern mass sport remains one of the unlikelier phenomena of twentieth-century British society.<br>
