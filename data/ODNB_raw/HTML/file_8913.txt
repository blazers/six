<span class="headword">&AElig;thelred I <span class="st"> [Ethelred I]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> 871), <span class="occ">king of the West Saxons</span>, was the fourth of the five sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8921/', "&#198;thelwulf (d. 858)")</script>, king of the West Saxons, and his first wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20887/', "Osburh (fl. 839)")</script>, herself descended from the West Saxon royal line. &AElig;thelred first attested his father's charters in 854 as a king's son, a title he retained through the reigns of his brothers <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8901/', "&#198;thelbald")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8904/', "&#198;thelberht")</script>, until he himself became king in 865.<br>
<br>The elevation of &AElig;thelred, and even more so the elevation of his younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/183/', "Alfred")</script>, would have seemed unlikely in the 850s. In the arrangements &AElig;thelwulf made after his return from Rome in 856, Wessex and its south-eastern extensions were divided between &AElig;thelred's elder brothers &AElig;thelbald and &AElig;thelberht. On &AElig;thelwulf's death in 858, &AElig;thelbald took over Wessex, married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39264/', "Judith")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8921/', "&#198;thelwulf")</script>], his stepmother and an anointed queen of the Frankish royal line, and doubtless expected to produce heirs.<br>
<br>After &AElig;thelbald's childless death in 860, &AElig;thelberht joined Wessex to his existing kingship of Kent. It seems likely that &AElig;thelred would have been expected to gain Wessex: a note in the historical preamble to King Alfred's will that part of &AElig;thelwulf's inheritance was meant to descend among &AElig;thelbald, &AElig;thelred, and Alfred suggests that &AElig;thelberht was expected to set up his own cadet branch of the family in Kent, and so no longer to need estates in Wessex. However, on &AElig;thelbald's death &AElig;thelred and Alfred gave up their part of that inheritance to &AElig;thelberht, on condition that he return it to them on his death. The likeliest explanation is that &AElig;thelberht received the kingship of Wessex, and also the inheritance intended to descend to &AElig;thelred and Alfred, because his younger brothers were considered too young to lead a country facing viking attack in 860: Alfred was only eleven, &AElig;thelred perhaps a year or so older. This explanation would accord with the fact that twice, in 862 and 863 (and presumably once he had come of age), &AElig;thelred issued charters as king of the West Saxons  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 335 and 336). He must have done so as &AElig;thelberht's deputy or in his absence, as there is no record of conflict between the brothers and &AElig;thelred continued witnessing &AElig;thelberht's charters as a king's son in 864.<br>
<br>After &AElig;thelberht's death in 865, &AElig;thelred became sole king of the West Saxons. In the same year, what the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> calls the &#145;great heathen army&#146; arrived in England and completely changed the scale of the viking attacks: within five years, these vikings had conquered and installed their own rulers over Northumbria and East Anglia. In 868, when they took Nottingham in Mercia, the Mercian king <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4018/', "Burgred")</script>, &AElig;thelred's brother-in-law, asked for West Saxon help. &AElig;thelred and Alfred led the West Saxons to Nottingham and besieged the vikings: there was no decisive battle, but the Mercians were able to make peace with (presumably buy off) the vikings, who returned to York.<br>
<br>The vikings turned their attention to Wessex late in 870, setting up base at Reading. &AElig;thelred and Alfred led the West Saxons against the vikings there, resulting in a large battle with great slaughter which the West Saxons lost. Four days later &AElig;thelred and Alfred again fought against the vikings, at Ashdown (in what are now called the Berkshire Downs), and this time were victorious. A fortnight later they were defeated by the vikings at Basing and two months afterwards, at &#145;Meretun&#146;, they again fought and again lost; to make matters worse, after this battle another viking army (the &#145;great summer army&#146;) sailed up the Thames and landed at Reading.<br>
<br>&AElig;thelred died shortly after Easter in 871 and was buried at Wimborne Minster. He had two sons, &AElig;thelhelm and &AElig;thelwald. The latter rebelled against Alfred's son Edward in 899 and was killed at the battle of the Holme in 902. The only other known descendant of &AElig;thelred is &AElig;thelweard, ealdorman of the western provinces in the late tenth century, who notes his descent from &AElig;thelred in his chronicle.<br>
