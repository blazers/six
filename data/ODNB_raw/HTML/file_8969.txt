<span class="headword">Evans,  John</span>  (1779&#150;1847), <span class="occ">Calvinistic Methodist preacher</span>, was born at Cwm Gwen, Pencader, Carmarthenshire, in October 1779, the son of John Evans and his wife, Rachel. His parents gave him a religious education, and he could read his <span class="roman">Bible</span> when he was four. He was sent to the best schools within reach, and under Mr Jones of Maesnoni he is supposed to have learned Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. As a boy he often preached without hearers. His parents were members, and his father a deacon, of the Independent church at Pencader. At the age of fourteen he was taken to hear David Jones of Llan-gan, one of the great Methodist preachers of the day. At sixteen, when his father had failed to persuade him to join the Independent church, he joined the Calvinistic Methodists and in 1796 began to preach at Llanpumsaint, where he had opened his own school. At nineteen he went to the Presbyterian college, Carmarthen, but soon left, though his tutor, the Revd D. Peter, thought highly of him. He married Mrs Jones, a widow of Llwyn Ffortun, Llanegwad, about 1808, and the year after his marriage he received deacon's orders, after examination, from Richard Watson, bishop of Llandaff. He held several curacies in succession&#151;at Mynyddislwyn, Monmouthshire, and Bridgend and Laleston in Glamorgan&#151;for short periods, and wherever he went he filled the churches. Great opposition was raised by some against his &#145;Methodistic ways&#146; and he returned to Llwyn Ffortun. His last curacy was at Llanddowror. He could not confine himself to his own church, and often preached off tombstones to crowded assemblies. He soon found, however, that the episcopal church was no proper place for him, and he returned to his old friends the Calvinistic Methodists, though he preached also among the Baptists or Congregationalists, and was everywhere welcome, and followed by an admiring multitude.<br>
<br>After the death of his first wife he married Rachel Davies of Pen-twyn, Llan-non, Carmarthenshire, and he spent the remainder of his life at her home. As he advanced in years he became much troubled with melancholia, and sometimes he had to be fetched from his bed to his pulpit duties. He died on 6 October 1847, and was buried at Pen-twyn Chapel, Llan-non.<br>
