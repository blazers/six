<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Gimson,  Ernest William</span>  (1864&#150;1919), <span class="occ">craftsman and architect</span>, was born in Leicester on 21 December 1864, the fourth child and second son in the family of three sons and four daughters of Josiah Gimson (1818&#150;1883), iron-founder, engineer, and industrial entrepreneur, who established the Vulcan works in Leicester, and his second wife, Sarah Ansell (1828&#150;1899). Josiah Gimson's father was a carpenter. From an early age Gimson's interest in buildings was obsessive; as a young man he was quoted as saying &#145;I am thinking of architecture all the time I am awake&#146;  (Lethaby, Powell, and Griggs, 2).<br>
<br>After leaving Franklin's School, Stoneygate, Leicester, in 1881 Gimson was articled to a local architect, Isaac Barradale, and also attended Leicester School of Art, where he won national medals for suburban housing and for furniture design. His father was a leading freethinker, founder member and president of the Leicester Secular Society, and a Liberal member of the city council. Gimson's view of life&#151;which was always to be that of the &#145;idealist individualist&#146;  (Lethaby, Powell, and Griggs, 1)&#151;was formed more by the mood and the standards of that crowded, argumentative, intellectually zealous, middle-class, provincial household than by his formal education.<br>
<br>In 1884 Gimson went to listen to William Morris lecturing to the Leicester Secular Society on &#145;Art and socialism&#146;. Afterwards he met Morris, who suggested the way that he should go in combining his radical conscience with his practical abilities in making and designing. It was Morris who encouraged him to move to London, recommending him to J. D. Sedding, a &#145;freestyle&#146; church architect himself involved in the practice of the crafts.<br>
<br>Gimson was a deeply solitary man with a contradictory need for close male friendships. In the mid-1880s in Sedding's office, he joined the small convivial group of young Arts and Crafts architects, satellites around Morris and Philip Webb, becoming a member of such early architectural action groups as the Art-Workers' Guild and the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings.<br>
<br>In 1890 Ernest Gimson was prime mover in establishing an individualistic London decorating firm, a brotherhood of architects designing and supervising the making of their furniture by cabinet-makers. The other members were W. R. Lethaby, Sidney Barnsley, Mervyn Macartney, Reginald Blomfield, and a less active partner, Colonel Mallet, each contributing &pound;100 of capital. This short-lived but enthusiastic enterprise was called Kenton &amp; Co., after a neighbouring street in Bloomsbury, and was obviously modelled on Morris's own firm.<br>
<br>Gimson subscribed to the arts and crafts principle that &#145;<i>doing</i> is Designing&#146;  (Lethaby, Powell, and Griggs, 4). He was fascinated by the practicalities of a new approach to traditional crafts. Before Kenton &amp; Co. opened he had travelled to Bosbury in Herefordshire to learn the craft of turned rush-seated chair making from an old man, Philip Clissett, who had been bodging chairs since 1838. His own versions of these, soon given their own generic title &#145;Gimson chairs&#146;, were still being made at the end of the twentieth century.<br>
<br>Gimson also learned the techniques of moulded and modelled plasterwork from the London trade firm of Whitcombe and Priestley, having admired the plaster ceilings at such historic houses as Speke Hall, Lancashire, Haddon Hall, Derbyshire, and Chastleton, Oxfordshire. In the William Morris manner of reviving ancient crafts in a new creative spirit, Gimson's plasterwork drew on natural motifs&#151;pinks, roses, trailing strawberry plants. These images recur in his designs for embroidery made at the same time. As his furniture workshops expanded Gimson was less able to take part in actual processes of making: his chief role became that of director and designer. But plasterwork was the one craft he continued all his life.<br>
<br>Ernest Gimson was a ruminative character, &#145;a thinker, an explorer, a teacher&#146;, as described by his colleague W. R. Lethaby  (Lethaby, Powell, and Griggs, 9). Having private means as a young man he travelled widely in England and Italy, making closely observed Ruskinian architectural drawings, watching with dismay the despoliation of the countryside, and gradually evolving his singular philosophy of craftsmanship and the environment.<br>
<br>In 1893 Gimson left London with Sidney Barnsley and went to live at Ewen in Gloucestershire. It was a move rich in symbolic overtones, true to Gimson's conviction that to do good work one must live near to nature in uncorrupted, incorruptible surroundings. Sidney's brother, the architect Ernest Barnsley, joined them with his family. In 1894 they all moved to Pinbury, a hamlet in a then remote and heavily wooded area five miles west of Cirencester. Here Gimson converted a stone farm building to make a cottage.<blockquote>The room was large, and the floor flagged with white stone &hellip; A large black dresser, hung with gay and well-used crockery, a large settle at the fireside, and oak armchair and other rush-bottom chairs made by himself on his pole lathe, were its furniture. (Lethaby, Powell, and Griggs, 18)</blockquote>Gimson used one of the outbuildings of Pinbury Park as a workshop for plaster and ladder-back chair making. He and Ernest Barnsley entered into a partnership as furniture makers, starting to employ cabinet-makers of their own.<br>
<br>In 1900 Gimson married Emily Ann Thompson (<i>d</i>. 1940), an enthusiastic amateur sketcher, daughter of the vicar of Skipsea in the East Riding of Yorkshire. Two years later the Gimsons and the Barnsleys moved to Sapperton, barely a mile away from Pinbury, where Gimson built himself a large new cottage, high-roofed with straw thatch. They established workshops and a showroom at Daneway House, a rare example of a medieval Cotswold house, leased from Earl Bathurst. (In the mid-twentieth century Daneway was occupied by the modernist architect Oliver Hill.) Tensions arose between the three families. By 1905 the partnership between Gimson and Ernest Barnsley broke up in bitterness. Sidney Barnsley and Gimson were only able to continue their friendship outside their homes. But their work retained recognizable stylistic affinities: a clear respect for techniques and materials, a strong love of tradition, and a belief in the vernacular which had a considerable impact on both theory and practice of British twentieth-century industrial design.<br>
<br>Gimson's furniture has long been regarded as his supreme achievement, the only relatively modern work to bear comparison with that of the great English cabinet-makers of the eighteenth century. It was highly perfectionist furniture, made by skilled craftsmen under Gimson's expert Dutch foreman, Peter van der Waals, using the minimum of machinery. Though Gimson so solemnly espoused the simple life much of his furniture was elaborate in concept and rich in its materials, using such timbers as ebony, rosewood, and English walnut with carved and inlaid detailing.<br>
<br>Gimson's furniture was made to commission for wealthy and discriminating clients, notably Sir Ernest Debenham and C. H. St John Hornby, owner of W. H. Smith &amp; Sons. Gimson's woodwork and metalwork&#151;the wrought-iron architectural fixtures, fire-irons, candlesticks and sconces made by his craftsmen in the blacksmiths' shop at Sapperton&#151;were commissioned for their buildings by other arts and crafts architects true to the ideal of the union of crafts. Prime examples are Gimson's ebony choir stalls in J. F. Bentley's Roman Catholic cathedral in Westminster and his massive timberwork at St Andrew's Church, Roker, designed by Edward Prior.<br>
<br>Within and beyond his own lifetime Ernest Gimson was regarded primarily as a furniture designer. In 1936 Nikolaus Pevsner described him as &#145;The greatest of the English artist-craftsmen&#146;  (<span class="italic">Pioneers of the Modern Movement</span>, 1936, 146). The originality and integrity of his few completed buildings had long been recognized, particularly his craggy stone-built cottages at Markfield near Leicester, buildings that themselves seem rooted in their landscape, and the magnificent timbered library at Bedales School, built posthumously. But for many decades Gimson's architecture was considered as an interesting sideline. Only in the 1990s did more concentrated study of the drawings for Gimson's architectural projects, less than half of which were realized, reveal the continuing centrality of his architecture in Gimson's creative life. His designs for the Port of London Authority headquarters and his masterplan for the new city of Canberra show great reserves of visionary energy. He was the most faithful of William Morris's followers and, besides two pairs of stone cottages at Kelmscott, was commissioned by May Morris to design her father's Memorial Hall, opened by Ramsay MacDonald in 1934.<br>
<br>With his tall well-built frame, his broad and rather florid features, his heavy hobnail boots and country yeoman's tweeds, Gimson seemed the rural Englishman personified. Beneath his bluff exterior was an immense austerity and the will-power to demonstrate what he believed in. When he led the country dances in the village hall at Sapperton it was reported &#145;there were no idle feet&#146;  (Lethaby, Powell, and Griggs, 32). Gimson's verbal uncommunicativeness and his wife's <i>de haut en bas</i> approach to village life worked against the achievement of his ambitions for a national resurgence of the crafts. He had bought land at Sapperton to set up a craft village, model for other villages to come. Plans had not developed far when Ernest Gimson died at his home of cancer on 12 August 1919. He was buried in Sapperton churchyard, under the yews. Peter van der Waals took over Gimson's workshop, continuing to make fine furniture which lacked the inspiration of his master's. Gimson's philosophical and practical influence on the twentieth-century craft workshop movement has been considerable particularly in the small furniture workshops which burgeoned from the 1970s. Collections of Gimson's furniture are in Cheltenham Art Gallery and Museum, Gloucestershire, Leicester City Museums, Belgrave Hall, and the Arts and Crafts Collection, Owlpen Manor, Uley, Gloucestershire.<br>
