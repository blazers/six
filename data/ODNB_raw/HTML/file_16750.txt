<span class="headword">Lionel</span> <span class="st"> [Lionel of Antwerp]</span>, duke of Clarence  (1338&#150;1368), <span class="occ">prince</span>, was the third (but second surviving) son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8519/', "Edward III (1312&#150;1377)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22110/', "Philippa of Hainault (1310x15?&#150;1369)")</script>. He was born at St Michael's Abbey, Antwerp, on 29 November 1338 during his parents' period of residence in the Low Countries at the start of the Hundred Years' War. Master Giles de Monte, a physician from Hainault, was later given &pound;15 as a gift for the thirteen weeks during which he cared for the infant prince. The unusual name given to the child is often supposed to have been a reference to the lion of Brabant, the duke of Brabant being one of Edward III's allies at the time of the prince's birth. But Edward had already specifically identified himself with the mythological and chivalric figure of Lionel&#151;one of the knights of Arthur's round table and cousin of Lancelot&#151;in a tournament held at Dunstable in 1334. Furthermore, the name carried obvious associations with the heraldic lions (more properly leopards) on the royal arms of England. The prince's personal heraldic repertoire was expanded in 1339 when William Montagu, first earl of Salisbury, to whom the king had earlier granted the right to bear the royal crest of an eagle, passed on the privilege to Lionel in his capacity as the child's godfather.<br>
<br>On 9 September 1342, at the Tower of London, Lionel was married to Elizabeth de Burgh (<i>b</i>. 6 July 1332), the daughter and sole heir of the deceased William de Burgh, third earl of Ulster. The marriage was consummated in 1352 and produced only one recorded child, Philippa Lionel, who married Edmund (III) Mortimer, earl of March: the house of York descended from this union. Lionel was recognized as earl of Ulster in the right of his wife at the latest by 26 January 1347. In organizing the marriage to Elizabeth de Burgh, Edward III evidently intended to set up Prince Lionel as the principal magnate in Ireland. However, the increasing power of the Gaelic tribal chiefs and the competing claims of the heirs male to the earldom of Ulster meant that Lionel's agents had effective control over only a comparatively small part of the landed estate associated with the title. In order to rectify this situation, a marriage was arranged between Lionel's widowed mother-in-law, Maud, daughter of Henry, earl of Lancaster, and Ralph Ufford, younger brother of the king's friend Robert Ufford, earl of Suffolk; Ralph was then appointed justiciar of Ireland in 1345 and given the task of re-establishing the earldom of Ulster. In fact, these plans came to little since Ufford died in 1346, and Lionel's destined career in Ireland was put off for some fifteen years.<br>
<br>Not the least of the reasons for this delay was the king's preoccupation with the wars in France. Lionel was appointed regent of England during his father's absence in Flanders from 3 to 26 July 1345, and again from 11 July 1346 to 12 October 1347 during the lengthy Cr&eacute;cy&#150;Calais campaign. The prince was obviously not old enough to exercise authority in person, and the task of government was fulfilled by the council; nevertheless, on the latter occasion the regent was provided, at the king's expense, with a personal seal in order to authorize the limited range of administrative responsibilities technically reserved to him. The surviving warrants under this seal indicate that during 1346&#150;7 Lionel's household was based successively at the Tower of London, Windsor, Reading (for much of 1347), and Bristol.<br>
<br>Lionel's own military career began in 1355 when he was knighted and he accompanied the king to Calais to take part in an inconclusive foray into enemy territory. He also participated in the invasion of Scotland in the winter of 1355&#150;6 and headed the list of witnesses to the official instrument by which Edward Balliol renounced his claim to the Scottish throne in favour of Edward III. In May 1359 he took part in a tournament at Smithfield, London, and was in France from October 1359 to May 1360, being present both at the siege of Rheims and at the peace negotiations held at Br&eacute;tigny. He was nominated a knight of the Garter to fill the stall vacated by John, Lord Beauchamp of Warwick, who had died on 2 December 1360, and first received robes from the king for the Garter ceremonies of April 1361.<br>
<br>The Anglo-French peace of 1360&#150;69 offered an opportunity for Lionel to take up his long-awaited role in Ireland. In July 1360 the Anglo-Irish political community had begged the king to send them a leader with the authority and resources necessary to re-establish order in the troubled lordship. Late in 1360, furthermore, the Countess Elizabeth's grandmother, Elizabeth de Clare, died, and Lionel came into possession not only of her share of the Clare estates in England and Wales but also of the Irish lands of the earldom of Ulster in which she had enjoyed a life interest. Edward III announced his intention to dispatch Prince Lionel to the lordship on 15 March 1361 and on 1 July created him royal lieutenant in Ireland. Lionel's elevation to the title of duke of Clarence (meaning the town, castle, and honour of Clare) in parliament on 13 November 1362 also had the effect of making him the senior Irish peer.<br>
<br>In the mid-fourteenth century the English colony in Ireland was on the defensive. Theoretically Edward III claimed lordship of the whole island, but in practice the native clans enjoyed a great deal of independence. Beyond the Bann and the Shannon there lay large areas in which English lordship was exercised only fleetingly and with difficulty, and even the heart of the English colony immediately around Dublin was threatened from time to time by Gaelic Irishmen such as the &Oacute; Broin, &Oacute; Tuathail, and Mac Murchadha tribes. Within the areas controlled by the English, royal authority was only ultimately effective if it met with the acquiescence of the resident aristocracy, in particular the earls of Desmond, Ormond, Louth, and Kildare. These and other members of the colonial aristocracy were highly critical of Edward III's neglect of the lordship: in 1346 it was alleged that the earl of Desmond had even sent messengers to the pope asking the latter to take Ireland under his special jurisdiction and appoint Desmond his vicar there. Consequently, although they regularly demanded royal intervention in the lordship, it was apparent even before Clarence's arrival that the &#145;English born in Ireland&#146; (as the resident Anglo-Norman lords were often called) had a very different political perspective from the &#145;English born in England&#146; (the description used for viceroys and other ministers sent into Ireland by the Westminster government). This was to be the great dilemma of Clarence's lieutenancy.<br>
<br>Lionel's task was to repair the ruinous state of the English colony by a demonstration of military might: he was equipped with a force of approximately 50 knights, 300 men-at-arms, and 540 mounted archers, and provided with ample financial resources to raise additional troops within Ireland (the original scheme to raise 800 foot archers in Wales and the west of England appears to have foundered). Almost as soon as he landed, the prince made a foray into Wicklow against the Gaelic forces that were challenging the English settlements around Dublin. In order to provide a more effective base for a military-style administration, some of the government was moved to Carlow, although Lionel himself continued to use Dublin as his personal headquarters and had the royal castle there renovated. He appears to have been diligent in his duties: early in 1362 he was at Drogheda and later that year he campaigned in Meath. On 22 April 1364 the earl of Ormond was appointed keeper of the lordship and Clarence returned to England to consult with the king and council; but Lionel was reappointed lieutenant on 24 September 1364 and took up residence in Ireland again in December, when he began a progress which took him from Cork via Trim to Drogheda. After a further visit to England in 1365, he held a parliament at Kilkenny in February 1366 which produced the most lasting of his legacies to Irish government. The statute of Kilkenny aimed to prevent the process of political and cultural &#145;degeneracy&#146; among the English born in Ireland by forbidding the subjects of the king from using the Irish tongue, marrying Irish wives, or observing Irish law. There was little that was new about these rules, but their codification in 1366 meant that the statute of Kilkenny became regarded as the definitive statement on the subject down to the early seventeenth century.<br>
<br>Lionel was replaced as lieutenant on 7 November 1366 and left Ireland, vowing (according to the author of the <span class="italic">Eulogium historiarum</span>) never to return. His contribution to the English regime in the lordship was mixed. On the one hand, his period as lieutenant witnessed the first sustained attempt to force absentee landholders to contribute to the defence of the colony. Nor was it devoid of military success: the capture of Art M&oacute;r Mac Murchadha and the latter's subsequent death while in Lionel's custody removed the most troublesome of the Gaelic chieftains. On the other hand, Clarence's lieutenancy demonstrated that the colony was no longer self-supporting and that English authority could only be maintained with regular support, both military and financial, from the English government at Westminster; when the crown's interest and determination waned, such resources could all too easily disappear. The political rhetoric of the Irish parliaments of this period certainly does not suggest that the resident aristocracy perceived any appreciable improvement in the state of the Plantagenet regime. Above all, the statute of Kilkenny demonstrated the conflict between official government policy and the reality of Anglo-Irish political culture.<br>
<br>Even before Lionel left Ireland, the king appears to have had a new career marked out for him. Clarence's first wife had died in Dublin in 1363; her body had been transported back to England, at the crown's expense, and buried in her family mausoleum at Clare Priory in Suffolk. On 30 July 1366 a diplomatic mission was sent to Italy to discuss the possibility of a marriage between Violante Visconti, daughter of Galeazzo Visconti, lord of Pavia, and either Prince Lionel or his younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16023/', "Edmund of Langley")</script>. Lionel quickly emerged as the preferred candidate. The initiative for this alliance came from Violante's uncle, Bernab&ograve; Visconti, lord of Milan, who was prepared to pay dearly for the prestige of a Plantagenet alliance. It also complemented the anti-papal stance adopted by the English crown in the mid-1360s. Otherwise, it is difficult to see how the marriage offered any particular advantages to Edward III, whose dynastic strategy was focused very much on the British Isles and France. The terms were settled at Westminster in May 1367 and the prince and his entourage began to make plans for their departure in February 1368. Lionel was accompanied across the channel by an entourage of 457 men, together with no fewer than 1280 horses. The wedding took place before the door of Milan Cathedral on 28 May or 5 June 1368 and was celebrated with great pomp; the aged poet Petrarch was said to have dined with the wedding party during the sumptuous celebrations that followed.<br>
<br>Violante brought with her a marriage portion of 2 million gold florins and a string of towns and castles in Piedmont; English chroniclers, playing on the apparent success of Edward III's family policy in the 1360s, believed that Galeazzo had surrendered half his lands to his new son-in-law. In the event, the marriage was brief and fruitless: Clarence died at Alba, in Piedmont, on 17 October 1368 and was initially buried at Pavia. By his will, dated at Alba on 3 October 1368 and proved at Lambeth on 8 June 1369, he expressed the wish to be buried at Clare, and his body was later removed to England and interred with that of his first wife. Violante subsequently married Ottone Palaeologo, marquess of Monferrato (<i>d</i>. 1378), and finally Ludovico Visconti, lord of Lodi (<i>d</i>. 1381); she died in 1382.<br>
<br>In contrast to his brothers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8523/', "Edward, prince of Wales")</script> (the Black Prince), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14843/', "John of Gaunt")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27197/', "Thomas of Woodstock")</script>, Lionel of Antwerp had only a minor role to play in English political life and made very little impression upon contemporary chroniclers and commentators. Perhaps, like his other brother, Edmund of Langley, he was not instinctively drawn to the world of high politics; more likely, his careers in Ireland and Italy and his early death, shortly before his thirtieth birthday, deprived his English contemporaries of any real knowledge of the prince's personal attributes and worth. In the fifteenth century, however, he achieved posthumous fame as one of the two sons of Edward III through whom the house of York claimed its right to the throne of England: this dynastic link undoubtedly explains, for instance, why the chronicler John Hardyng not only concocted an idealized physical description of the duke but also speculated that the Visconti marriage might, in the fullness of time, have made Clarence king of Italy and even emperor.<br>
