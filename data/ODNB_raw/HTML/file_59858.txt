</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Glaister,  John</span>  (1856&#150;1932), <span class="occ">expert in medical jurisprudence and public health</span>, was born on 9 March 1856 in the county town of Lanark, the eldest of four children born to Joseph Glaister (1830&#150;1871) and Marion Hamilton Weir (1832&#150;1871), small property owners, grocers, and spirit merchants. Glaister was educated at Hugh Brown's School, Westport, and Lanark grammar school before entering into a legal apprenticeship at the age of fifteen. After the death of his parents the family business was bought by an uncle, who became his guardian. Glaister then turned his back on the law and entered Glasgow University, in 1873, to study medicine. He proved a gifted student, gaining many prizes, and completed his studies in less than four years, though he was refused permission to sit the final MB examinations immediately because he was still some months under the age of twenty-one.<br>
<br>Undeterred, in 1877 Glaister obtained licences from both the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, and after a brief period as assistant to a practitioner in Carluke he set up practice in the then affluent Townhead district of Glasgow. An archetypal young man in hurry, he married in 1878 Mary Scott Clarke, daughter of Robert Clarke, of Wishaw. The first of their six children was born in 1879. In the same year Glaister graduated MD at Glasgow. With a young family to support and no medical connections or continental study to further his career, he augmented his income by obtaining the post of police surgeon for the St Rollox division, an industrial district on the banks of the Forth and Clyde Canal. The foundations of Glaister's ensuing medico-legal career were laid in this period. He rapidly became acquainted with a wide range of wounds caused by crimes and industrial accidents. The canal provided him with material to differentiate between injuries caused to bodies by the screws of passing steamers before and after death. By 1893 he had seen 300 dead bodies as part of his duties.<br>
<br>Glaister's wide circle of medical friends included the rising surgeon William Macewen, then a part-time extramural lecturer on medical jurisprudence at Glasgow Royal Infirmary medical school. In 1881 Glaister succeeded Macewen in this post, the latter having obtained the infirmary lectureship in surgery, and he also became a fellow of the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow. In the mid-1880s he added lectures in public health to his course, responding to the demand for suitably qualified medical officers of health. He was appointed, in 1887, as special lecturer in public health at the Royal Infirmary, with a laboratory which he equipped at his own expense. Glaister took the Cambridge diploma in public health in 1889. His was the sole laboratory in Glasgow and the west of Scotland to offer sufficient tuition for the Cambridge diploma.<br>
<br>Glaister was appointed professor of forensic medicine and public health in 1889 when the Glasgow Royal Infirmary school merged with St Mungo's medical school. At this point public health appeared the more important field to Glaister. He published a book and several articles on the subject but it is doubtful whether he shared James Burn Russell's ideology: Glaister's writings on sanitary failings are tinged more with nature than with nurture. During the 1890s he campaigned for improved standards in death certification. With Russell he toured public health laboratories throughout the United Kingdom for Glasgow University. In 1899 he was elevated to the university's regius chair of forensic medicine and public health; he taught female students separately at the nearby Queen Margaret College. In 1903 Glaister introduced postgraduate degrees for BSc and DSc in public health. By 1907 Glaister had successfully acquired custom-built and specially equipped laboratory facilities for both forensic medicine and public health within the university's latest extension.<br>
<br>When the sheriff of Lanarkshire appointed him a crown medical witness in 1899, Glaister resigned his police position and sold his private practice. From that time onwards he derived his income mainly from his professorial salary and his medico-legal fees, and he styled himself &#145;medico-legal examiner in crown cases&#146;. He lived in some comfort, with a small country estate in Dumfriesshire, where he indulged his leisure pursuits of golf, fishing, and motoring.<br>
<br>Glaister became a household name as his appearances increased in the busy Glasgow high courts. Like his Edinburgh counterpart, Henry Littlejohn, Glaister considered himself the complete medical detective: a forensic pathologist, toxicologist, serologist, psychiatrist, and ballistics and fingerprint expert, who dealt with all theatres of death. Notorious trials such that of Oscar Slater in 1909 for the murder of Marion Gilchrist by assault with a hammer, and of Donald Merrett in 1926 for the murder by shooting of his mother, secured Glaister's position in a forensic firmament later inhabited by Bernard Spilsbury and Sydney Smith, with whom he did battle, or so it seemed to his medical students and the average Glaswegian.<br>
<br>Unlike Littlejohn, however, Glaister was a full-time academic who also wrote valuable textbooks. His first, published in 1902, conjoined the two subjects professed from his chair: <span class="italic">A Textbook of Medical Jurisprudence, Toxicology and Public Health</span>. Thereafter, subsequent editions were restricted to medical jurisprudence and toxicology, with one edition of <span class="italic">A Textbook of Public Health</span> in 1910. He dedicated each edition to his wife under the acronym MSG. Glaister's was the first British textbook to use photographic evidence to illustrate violent death and other aspects of forensic medicine, each further edition amplified by his latest cases. In court his textbook was often quoted back at him by defence counsels, notably the eminent Craigie Aitchison. It pleased Glaister enormously to gain student recognition through the affectionately scurrilous &#145;Ballad of John Glaister&#146;, which encapsulated many of his lecture and textbook themes. The ballad's fame crossed the Atlantic to Harvard medical school, whose students thought Glaister to be a fictional character similar to Sherlock Holmes. In his lifetime Glaister published five editions of his textbook. John Glaister the younger, his son and successor in the chair, continued with further editions.<br>
<br>Glaister carried his forensic skills beyond the criminal courts and into the arena of industrial disease and death. He was the specialist medical referee in industrial diseases for the counties of Lanark, Ayr, Renfrew, Bute, Stirling, and Dumbarton. He made a unique study of accidental arsine poisoning through the triggering of the Marsh test effect, which produces arseniuretted hydrogen.<br>
<br>During the First World War Glaister carried the bulk of teaching and examination in public health and forensic medicine at Glasgow. The post-war growth of the subjects' specialisms forced him to recognize what had been accepted in Edinburgh in 1897&#151;that the traditional Scottish teaching of both subjects in tandem was no longer viable. In 1923 one of Glaister's friends, the industrialist Sir Henry Mechan, endowed a separate chair of public health. Glaister continued as professor of forensic medicine until 1931. When he retired the university conferred upon him the honorary degree of LLD. Until the end of his career Glaister's idiosyncratic court attire consisted of the silk top hat, long frock-coat, and Gladstone high collar of his younger days.<br>
<br>Between 1907 and 1909, when Glaister was president of the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, the faculty applied for and was granted the title &#145;Royal&#146;. In his time Glaister was also elected president of the Royal Glasgow Philosophical Society, vice-president of the Medico-legal Society of Great Britain, the Medico-legal Institute of New York, and academician and gold medallist of the Royal Chemico-Physico Academy of Palermo. He was a member and fellow of many societies including the Edinburgh Royal Society, the Chemical Society, and the Royal Sanitary Institute. Closer to home Glaister was a member of the management board of the Royal Infirmary and a long-time member of the Southern Medical Club. He also worked enthusiastically for the British Medical Association: he was joint secretary at the 1888 annual general meeting in Glasgow, president of the section of industrial diseases and forensic medicine at the 1922 meeting, and, shortly before his death, vice-president of the section on forensic medicine at the centenary meeting in 1932. He was a staunch member of the St Rollox Conservative Association, and for fifty-six years he was a member and senior deacon at the Elgin Place Congregational Church. Glaister was a moving force in the foundation of the Scottish Burial Reform and Cremation Society, of which he was a medical referee, director for thirty years, and chairman from 1922 to 1932.<br>
<br>In December 1932 Glaister and his wife succumbed to an influenza epidemic sweeping Glasgow. On 18 December they died within four hours of each other at their home in Newton Place. Their joint funeral service was held on 23 December in the university chapel, Glaister's coffin distinguished by his scarlet robe. They were cremated at the Maryhill crematorium, Glasgow, and their ashes interred in the family grave in Lanark.<br>
