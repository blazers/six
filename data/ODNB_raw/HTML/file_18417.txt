<span class="headword">Maxwell <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Herbert]</span>,  Winifred</span>, countess of Nithsdale  (1672&#150;1749), <span class="occ">Jacobite courtier</span>, was the last of the six children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13060/', "William Herbert, marquess and Jacobite duke of Powis (c.1626&#150;1696)")</script>, and Lady Elizabeth Somerset (<i>c</i>.1634&#150;1691), daughter of Edward, second marquess of Worcester. She was the sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13039/', "Lady Lucy Herbert")</script>, devotional writer and superior of the English Augustinian convent at Bruges, Flanders, and Lady Carrington, who was active in Jacobite plots. Her parents, prominent in the court of James II, moved to St Germain-en-Laye after the revolution of 1688. There she met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18413/', "William Maxwell, fifth earl of Nithsdale (1676&#150;1744)")</script>, the son of Robert and Lucie Maxwell, fourth earl and countess of Nithsdale. Lady Winifred married the fifth earl in 1699. Two children survived to adulthood, William, Lord Maxwell, and Anne, Lady Bellew. Lady Nithsdale raised her granddaughter, Frances Maria Bellew, after Anne died giving birth to her second child.<br>
<br>When Lord Nithsdale was imprisoned and sentenced to death for his part in the 1715 Jacobite rising, Lady Nithsdale travelled to London to attempt to secure a pardon for him. She completed her journey on horseback when deep snow stopped the stagecoaches. In London she asked those with power for assistance and attempted to present a petition in person to George I. He refused to accept it, and when she clutched at his robes, he dragged her to the end of the room where a guard stopped her. This incident sparked criticism of the king's rudeness and encouraged popular sympathy for Lady Nithsdale. Though Lord Dorset eventually had the petition read to the king, Lady Nithsdale believed that her husband's Catholicism would prevent any leniency. When this and other petitions failed, Lady Nithsdale organized her husband's escape from the Tower of London on 22 February 1716. With the assistance of her maid Cecilia Evans and two friends, Mrs Morgan and Mrs Mills, Lady Nithsdale confused the guards and smuggled in an extra cloak and paint to disguise Lord Nithsdale. Lady Nithsdale conducted her husband outside and then returned to his cell and pretended to converse with him for a while. When she departed, she told the guards he was at prayers and should not be disturbed. Once Lord Nithsdale was safely out of the Tower, Mrs Evans placed him with one of her friends. When the escape became known, Lady Nithsdale remained quietly in London, but once Lord Nithsdale was safe on the continent, she undertook a risky journey to Scotland to secure the family papers and arrange for the care of their property. She suffered a miscarriage during her journey to join her husband, but she recovered and became active in the exiled Jacobite court, residing first at La Fl&egrave;che, in France (March 1717&#150;July 1718), and then from 1718 to 1726 at Rome.<br>
<br>Lady Nithsdale's only official position at court was governess to Henry Benedict Stuart, but she also served as unofficial lady-in-waiting to Clementina Sobieska and cared for Charles Edward Stuart when Clementina moved to a convent. Many of Lady Nithsdale's letters from this period plead for money and assistance in curtailing her husband's expenditures. Despite the hardships of her later years, her devotion to James Edward Stuart and his children never wavered. She died in Rome in May 1749.<br>
<br>The romantic story of the earl's escape made Lady Nithsdale a popular heroine in early Jacobite writing. In a letter to her sister Lucy describing the escape, she writes that George I, whom she calls &#145;the Electour&#146;, said &#145;that I had done him more mischeif than any woman in Christendom&#146;  (Tayler, 56). Her story provided the basis for numerous popular historical accounts, plays, most notably Clifford Bax's <span class="italic">The Immortal Lady</span> (1931), and a highly romanticized historical novel, <span class="italic">Winifred, Countess of Nithsdale: a Tale of the Jacobite Wars</span> (1869), by Barbarina Olga Brand, Lady Dacre. Lady Nithsdale also became a recurring figure in books of distinguished women, where she is praised for her intrepid actions and her devotion to her husband.<br>
