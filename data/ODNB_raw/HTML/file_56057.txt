<span class="headword">Fawcett,  Marion</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Catherine  Rodger Campbell; <em>married name </em>Catherine  Rodger Ball]</span>  (1877&#150;1957), <span class="occ">actress and theatre director</span>, was born on 25 November 1877 at 39 Twiss Street, Toxteth Park, Liverpool, the daughter of Peter Campbell, marine engineer, and his wife Catherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rodger. She was educated at the Convent of the Faithful Companions, Sefton Park, Liverpool. Her first stage appearance was in 1899 at the Court Theatre, Liverpool, when she had a walking-on part in Henry Irving's company in <span class="italic">Robespierre</span>. She appeared in a sketch at the London Pavilion in 1903. Adopting the stage name Marion Fawcett, by which she was always known, she gained experience in provincial repertory theatre with Armitage's and Leigh's company.<br>
<br>In 1918 she formed her own repertory players and opened at the Empire Theatre, Wakefield, on 10 June with <span class="italic">The Old Country</span> by Gerald Du Maurier, moving on to Wakefield Theatre Royal and Opera House on 5 August for a further ten weeks. The plays she produced were regarded as providing &#145;clean, healthy and educational amusement&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wakefield Express</span>, 8 June 1918, p. 5). She continued the repertory management, with seasons in several northern towns, until 1921. Subsequently she moved to London and assisted with Lena Ashwell's Once-a-week Players. She produced also for the Jewish Drama League and the Repertory Players. In 1925 she produced <span class="italic">East Lynne</span> at Southampton and the Borough Theatre, Stratford, London, and <span class="italic">The Boy Next Door</span> at Woking.<br>
<br>In the summers of 1926 and 1927 Fawcett was the producer for short and ambitious seasons of &#145;international masterpieces&#146; at the Theatre Royal, Huddersfield, with plays by Chekhov, Ibsen, and Pirandello among others that &#145;made no concession to popular taste&#146;  (Chadwick, 31). Pierre Fresnay, formerly of the Com&eacute;die Fran&ccedil;aise, appeared in Pirandello's <span class="italic">The Game as he Played it</span> in August 1927 and Robert Donat was recruited as the young lover in <span class="italic">The Witch</span>, a play adapted by John Masefield from the work of Hans Wiers-Jenssen, for that year's final week. As always, Fawcett herself took only small parts but &#145;her rendering of the snuff-taking, vodka-drinking, love-sick Masha in <span class="italic">The Seagull</span>&#146; was described as &#145;unforgettable&#146;  (Isaac, 56).<br>
<br>Between 1926 and 1928 Fawcett was associated with Jack de Leon's management at the Q Theatre, Kew Bridge, London, where her activities were &#145;multifarious&#146;. She revised scripts&#151;sometimes, as with <span class="italic">Contraband</span> (1928), radically (it had originated with a blacksmith named Warren but was promoted as a play by Noel Doone and Warren Fawcett, that is, Jack de Leon and Marion Fawcett). She also directed, served as business manager, stood in for sick actresses, wrote short stories for the <span class="italic">Q Theatre Gazette</span>, and played numerous minor parts, &#145;extracting laughs by &hellip; the shape of her figure and the stolidness of her walk&#146;  (Barrow, 50). At some point she &#145;lost&#146; nine years from her age (and revised her place of birth): the entry in the 1947 edition of <span class="italic">Who's Who in the Theatre</span> quotes her birth as in Aberdeen in 1886. Jack de Leon remarked that when he first met her in 1926 she was &#145;just over forty&#146; but seemed &#145;an ancient unshakeable monument&#146; with &#145;a vast store of repertory and professional experience in every aspect of theatre&#146;  (Barrow, 49). She was proud not only of the Scottish ancestry of both sides of her family, but also of being, as she saw it, among pioneer women entering a man's world.<br>
<br>Fawcett appeared in minor roles at some of the principal London theatres on Sundays and sometimes Mondays in 1927 and 1928, in one-off productions by the Venturers' Society and the Sunday Play Society, rarely qualifying for even a mention in reviews. By then her career had peaked. In 1931 she spent a brief period producing at the Opera House, Malta, and had occasional modest parts in plays in London for the next twenty years, rarely attracting critics' attention. Her last stage appearance, as Mabel in <span class="italic">Separate Tables</span> at St James's Theatre, London, in September 1954, was again unremarked.<br>
<br>Fawcett was married to Dennis Ball who acted under the name of Dennis Bryan. He predeceased her. She died of cancer on 18 July 1957 at Charing Cross Hospital, Westminster, London.<br>
