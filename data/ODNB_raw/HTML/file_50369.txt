<span class="headword">Baker,  Richard Edward St Barbe</span>  (1889&#150;1982), <span class="occ">conservationist</span>, was born on 9 October 1889 at West End, near Southampton, the eldest of five children of John Richard St Barbe Baker, horticulturist, and his wife, Charlotte, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Purrott. His father grew trees for a living on his own land and from his earliest days Baker was surrounded by and dedicated to woods and trees. After early schooling locally, at the age of thirteen he was sent to Dean Close School, Cheltenham. Four years later, on discovering that his father was having to sell off land to pay for his education, Baker resolved to leave school and fulfil an early ambition of going to Canada. There, at Saskatoon, he became one of the early students of Saskatchewan University, where he read arts and sciences. In the three and a half years he spent in Canada he gained much experience of working in the forests and it was from this that he decided he should qualify as a forester. He also held deep religious beliefs and on returning to England in 1913 he went to Cambridge to study divinity. At the outbreak of the First World War he volunteered for service overseas and was commissioned in the Royal Horse and Field Artillery. Severely wounded three times in the course of his war service (and awarded the Military Cross), he was finally invalided out in April 1918. After a period of convalescence he returned to Cambridge, to Gonville and Caius College, and took a diploma in forestry. His first application to become assistant conservator of forests in Kenya was turned down on medical grounds as he was still recuperating from the injuries he had suffered, but the post was granted in November 1920 and a public career that was to lead to world renown began.<br>
<br>In Kenya, Baker saw at once the pressing need for widespread reafforestation to stem the erosion and desiccation of the land caused by unremitting felling of the forests. No funding was available for this, but with the collaboration of Chief Josiah Njonjo a team of volunteers&#151;<i>Watu wa Miti</i> (Men of the Trees)&#151;was formed, a dedicated group of fifty warriors being sworn in on 22 July 1922 at the first dance of the trees. Over the years millions of trees were planted. On his return to England in 1924 Baker founded the Men of the Trees Society (renamed the International Tree Foundation in 1992), the activities of which led within his lifetime to the planting of billions of trees throughout the world. Between 1924 and 1929 he was conservator of forests in Nigeria and from then until the Second World War he travelled throughout the world to establish tree planting and conservation programmes. Of special concern to him was the saving of the giant redwoods of California, and he returned there year after year to pursue this. A discussion with Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932 resulted in the formation of the Civilian Conservation Camps Corps, which contributed massive labour to forest conservation over a nine-year period.<br>
<br>In the years following the war until the very end of his life Baker continued to travel the world, campaigning vigorously for the preservation and restoration of forests and the reclamation of desert areas (the Sahara being seen as a particular challenge), lecturing widely, participating in international conferences and symposia, and tirelessly spreading his expertise. His (ever modest) autobiographical writings gave a hint of the great range of his benevolent achievements over the course of a long career. He married first, on 23 January 1946, Doreen Whitworth Long (<i>b</i>. 1919/20), daughter of George Henry William Long, farmer, of Puncknowle, Dorset. They had a son and a daughter. The marriage was dissolved in 1953 and in 1959 Baker married Catriona Burnett of Mount Cook, New Zealand, and took up residence there. In 1971 he was made an honorary LLD of the University of Saskatchewan and he was appointed OBE in 1978. In June 1982, in his ninety-third year, he returned to Saskatoon, where, on 5 June, in celebration of World Environment day, he planted what proved to be his last tree. He died there peacefully four days later and following a Baha&#146;i funeral service (a faith he had held since 1922) was buried in the Woodlawn cemetery in Saskatoon.<br>
<br>Although he made no claims to being a writer as such, in the period from 1940 to the late 1970s Baker published some twenty-five seminal books about trees and the challenges he had undertaken, many being illustrated with his own very accomplished photographs. He also wrote many specialist articles. St Barbe, as he was affectionately known to many, was a practical man of exceptional vitality, motivated by an unwavering belief in the need to reverse the destruction that had been wrought from the earliest times upon the forests of this planet. The combination of his ideals, backed by his religious convictions and blended with his agreeable personality, his ability to relate constructively to everyone he encountered, and his tireless energy, culminated in the vast contribution he made to pioneering the saving of the world's forests. He was always the first to declare that what had been achieved was the outcome of teamwork, but there can be no doubt that he was the indispensable catalyst.<br>
