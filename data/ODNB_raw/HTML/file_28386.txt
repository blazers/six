<span class="headword">Wadham, Sir  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1412), <span class="occ">justice</span>, was probably a native of Devon, though his background is obscure. Having entered upon a legal career, he is first recorded in 1367, as an attorney at Westminster, and prospered sufficiently to be returned to parliament as a burgess for Exeter in 1379. In January 1383 he was ordered to become a serjeant-at-law, and thereafter appeared regularly in the central courts as a pleader. In 1384 he was in receipt of livery from Edward Courtenay, earl of Devon, for whom he acted as a feoffee in the following year. A JP for Devon for the first time in 1384, he was a commissioner of array there in 1385, and was subsequently appointed to judicial commissions, and to be a justice of assize and gaol delivery, in many southern and midland counties. By June 1387 he had become a king's serjeant. The purge of the judiciary by the lords appellant in the following year provided Wadham with further opportunities for advancement. On 20 May 1389 he was one of three new justices appointed to the court of common pleas, receiving an annual fee of 50 marks as well as the usual salary of &pound;40. For as long as he held this office he was invariably among the justices summoned to parliament, and seven times acted as a trier of petitions.<br>
<br>The profits of success soon became apparent. Between 1384 and 1386 Wadham acquired the Dorset manor of Haydon. Following the exile of Sir John Carey in 1388, Wadham and his friend and fellow justice William Hankeford were able for &pound;400 to buy Carey's estates at Hardington Mandeville, Chilton Cantelo, Merrifield, and Trent in Somerset. Other acquisitions included the manors of Harberton and Silverton, and half the manor of Lustleigh, all in Devon. Perhaps his rise prompted resentment, for in 1392 he fell foul of his former employer, the earl of Devon, who sent word to Wadham while he conducted a gaol delivery in Exeter, &#145;that he should sit more uprightly without partiality than he had at the last session&#146;  (Leadam and Baldwin, 77&#150;81). The earl had to plead for the king's grace, and Wadham remained in favour, active as a justice both at Westminster and in the localities, regularly named as a commissioner, and appointed to the bench in counties as far apart as Devon and the North Riding of Yorkshire. By September 1397 he had been knighted. Even if Wadham did not always act upon his commissions, the demands of the king's business must have been considerable, and perhaps it is not surprising that on 10 May 1398 he should have been discharged from the common pleas at his own request and at once withdrew from an assize circuit in south-east England. For his good service Wadham was granted &pound;20 a year for life.<br>
<br>For the rest of his life Wadham was largely concerned with his affairs in the south-west, where he seems mainly to have resided at Merrifield. He was, however, returned as a knight of the shire for Devon in 1401, and he continued to be appointed to the county bench for Devon until 1408 and for Somerset until May 1410. In December 1407 he was appointed to investigate the sensitive issue of oppressions by royal officials in Somerset, but otherwise he withdrew from public business almost entirely. Provision for the descent of his estates to his wife and sons had been largely completed in 1397, but in 1404 he added to his earlier arrangements. Wadham drew up his will on 12 March 1411. It shows that he was a wealthy man, with a fine collection of plate, and enough cash (&pound;835 in all) to allow him to bequeath &pound;100 each to his wife, three of his sons, William, John, and Thomas, and his three daughters, Joan, Elizabeth, and Margery, who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61261/', "John Stourton, first Baron Stourton")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52797/', "Stourton family")</script>]. A fourth son, Walter, who was a priest, received only &pound;40. Other bequests were less generous. William Hankeford received a silver cup with a cover, but Wadham's sister Cicely was left only &pound;5, and his niece Agnes just 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. A variety of small sums, and in one case ten sheep, were left to London friaries, local churches and roads, neighbours, friends, and servants. 40 marks were set aside for prayers for the testator's soul, but with the evident hope that the four chaplains stipulated for could be hired for less. Wadham died on 27 July 1412, leaving lands valued at &pound;115 per annum. He had married twice. His first wife, Maud, and his eldest son, Robert, both predeceased him; before 1385 he had married his second wife, Joan Wrothesley, who outlived her husband.<br>
