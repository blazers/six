<span class="headword">Myers,  George</span>  (1803&#150;1875), <span class="occ">builder and craftsman</span>, known as &#145;Pugin's builder&#146;, was born in Kingston upon Hull, Yorkshire, the son of George Myers, whitesmith, (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1823), and of his second wife, Mary Benson (<i>d</i>. 1845). Family details are vague, including the religious affiliation of his parents at the time of his birth. Myers certainly died a Roman Catholic. Only one brother and one half-sister have been traced. As a boy Myers was apprenticed to William Comins, the master mason at Beverley Minster. He continued working there until 1829, and it was there, in 1827, that he first met A. W. N. Pugin, who had gone there to draw; they were not to meet again for ten years.<br>
<br>In 1829 Myers returned to Hull and set up in business as a stonemason and builder. Expanding towns and cities, together with Catholic emancipation and the religious revival, created a need for more churches, and new wealth created a desire for new buildings of every kind. In Hull, Myers built the Wilberforce memorial (1834) as well as public baths, houses, mills, and churches. In 1837 he met Pugin again when he tendered to build St Mary's Church in Derby, not realizing that the architect was the young boy he had helped in Beverley Minster a decade earlier. Pugin, according to his biographer, Benjamin Ferrey, is said to have flung his arms round his neck and promised that he should execute all his buildings, a promise which he kept to the best of his ability. It has been said that Myers was the rock on which Pugin built the Gothic revival. Pugin described Myers as &#145;a rough diamond, but a real diamond&#146;  (Spencer-Silver, 61). It would have been difficult, if not impossible, for him to have found another builder with Myers's knowledge of medieval Gothic who was also capable of working from Pugin's sketchy drawings. They became true friends and collaborators, yet no evidence has come to light to show that Myers had any hand in the decorating or furnishing of the houses of parliament. Myers carried out about forty major contracts for Pugin. The grand finale of their work together was the medieval court at the Great Exhibition of 1851. Myers was awarded a medal for his sculpture. Pugin died the next year and it was Myers himself who carved the full length effigy on his tomb in St Augustine's Church, Ramsgate.<br>
<br>In 1842 Myers had moved to London. In 1845 he took on the lease of Ordnance Wharf, Lambeth, just downstream from Westminster Bridge. Here he established workshops where his craftsmen carved, sculpted, made furniture and also made the patterns for some of the metalwork produced by John Hardman (1811&#150;1867) of Birmingham. With his yards on the bank of the river and Waterloo Station nearby, transport was no problem and he was well equipped to take a leading part in the great building boom of the 1850s and 1860s.<br>
<br>Myers's most spectacular works were carried out for architects other than Pugin&#151;in all, 240 of his contracts have been traced. He was involved in many government contracts. He built the first barracks at Aldershot, where the red-bearded, frock-coated contractor with his stove-pipe hat, driving his high-wheeled gig, was remembered for many years. He enlarged the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, and built Netley Hospital on Southampton Water, the Herbert Hospital at Woolwich, and the Staff College at Camberley. He restored the Tower of London using stone from his own quarries, and also the Guildhall in the City; and he worked at Windsor Castle. He built asylums, including Colney Hatch and Broadmoor and he enlarged and modernized Bedlam (the Bethlem Hospital). In the City of London he built banks, offices and warehouses. He also constructed a number of small railways, in addition to building stately homes.<br>
<br>Myers was the Rothschilds' favourite builder and built Mentmore in Buckinghamshire and Ferri&egrave;re near Paris, as well as many of their other houses, both in London and in the country. He built nearly a hundred churches for all denominations, and one synagogue. His craftsmen's work travelled far: an altar table and lectern went to Newfoundland, a Pugin-designed tombstone for two babies was dispatched to New Orleans, and three model churches, which took to pieces, as well as church furniture in stone and tombstones, were sent to Tasmania. It is impossible to go far in London without coming across an example of Myers's work, and most counties in England can boast at least one of his buildings.<br>
<br>On 10 May 1829 Myers married Isabella, daughter of William Patterson of Beverley, Yorkshire; they had two sons and his wife died in 1834 giving birth to a third son, who died soon after. On 18 March 1841 Myers married Judith, daughter of David Ruddock of Horbury, Yorkshire, who gave birth to three sons and three daughters. The youngest girl married her cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48715/', "Sir John Jackson (1851&#150;1919)")</script> in 1876. In June 1873 Myers retired and handed over the business to David and Joseph, the two sons of his first marriage. In the spring of 1874, he had a stroke; he died of &#145;exhaustion&#146; at his home, Thanet House, Montague Place, Lambeth, London, on 25 January 1875. He was buried in Norwood cemetery. The lease of Ordnance Wharf came to an end that year, and was not renewed. Judith Myers survived for another sixteen years.<br>
