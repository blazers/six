<span class="headword">Ward,  Robert Plumer</span>  (1765&#150;1846), <span class="occ">politician and writer</span>, was born in Mount Street, Mayfair, on 19 March 1765, the sixth son and eighth child of John Ward (<i>d</i>. 1791), a merchant resident in Gibraltar and chief clerk of the civil department in the garrison, and his wife, Rebecca Raphael (1732&#150;1768), who was descended from a Genoese Jewish family settled in Spain. She died when Robert was three years old. Ward was educated at Macfarlane's academy, Walthamstow, and afterwards at Christ Church, Oxford, which he entered in January 1783. He remained at Oxford until 1787 and, after leaving, travelled in France while pursuing studies in law. During his time in France he witnessed the early stages of the French Revolution. He returned to London and was called to the bar by the Inner Temple on 18 June 1790.<br>
<br>Ward initially practised law on the western circuit, as well as conducting business in London where he undertook appeals before the privy council. In 1794 he came to the attention of William Pitt when he provided details of a republican plot. This incident occurred on the eve of the government's decision to prosecute members of the London reform societies. Even so, it seems unlikely that the evidence that Ward presented had any influence on the subsequent course of events  (Veitch, 304). Nevertheless this meeting just prior to the treason trials led to a suggestion from the brother of Lord Eldon that he write a book on international law. <span class="italic">An enquiry into the foundation and history of the law of nations in Europe from the time of the Greeks and Romans to the age of Grotius</span> (2 vols.) duly appeared in 1795. Shortly after this, on 2 April 1796 Ward married Catherine Julia Maling (1772&#150;1821) of West Herrington, co. Durham, thereby becoming closely connected with Henry Phipps, first earl of Mulgrave, who had recently married her eldest sister, Sophia. They had one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28685/', "Sir Henry George Ward")</script>.<br>
<br>Ward now moved his legal practice to the northern circuit. The rise of the League of Armed Neutrality brought a request from the foreign secretary, Lord Grenville, for a defence of the rights of belligerents, and Ward produced <span class="italic">A treatise of the relative rights and duties of belligerents and neutral powers in maritime affairs, in which the principles of the armed neutralities and the opinions of H&uuml;bner and Schlegel are fully discussed</span> (1801). These political services were rewarded when on the personal recommendation of William Pitt he was offered a seat in the House of Commons for the Lowther pocket borough of Cockermouth in June 1802. Both Viscount Lowther and Ward's brother-in-law the future earl of Mulgrave had been Pittite MPs before inheriting peerages. Ward's maiden speech in December 1802 had supported the Addington administration but by the following year Pitt's friends, especially after the resumption of the war against France, moved to restore the former minister. On his own initiative Ward published a pamphlet favourable to Pitt in response to Patten's criticism of Addington's dealings with Bonaparte. When Pitt did return to power in 1804 Ward supported the government's position following the seizure of four Spanish frigates prior to the declaration of war on Spain on 16 October 1804 by publishing <span class="italic">An enquiry into the manner in which the different wars of Europe have commenced during the past two centuries</span> (1804).<br>
<br>In January 1805 Lord Mulgrave was appointed foreign secretary and Ward was offered the post of under-secretary. He decided to accept, turning his back on a lucrative legal career and the offer of a Welsh judicial post. Ward did not speak in parliament on foreign affairs, though a little earlier he had attempted to bolster the government's position by informing the press that French claims of a Russian capitulation at what proved to be Austerlitz were fabrications  (<span class="italic">Creevey Papers</span>, 45). The death of Pitt in February 1806 and the advent of the &#145;ministry of all the talents&#146; led to Ward's resignation and move into opposition. He was not a candidate at the election of 1806 but was returned for Haslemere as Lord Lowther's nominee in January 1807. When later that year the duke of Portland took office, Lord Mulgrave was made first lord of the Admiralty and Ward appointed a junior lord with a place on the Admiralty board. Until 1811 Ward moved the naval estimates in the house and undertook to defend the interest of the Admiralty on other questions.<br>
<br>Ward worked quite closely with Spencer Perceval, then chancellor of the exchequer, and came to admire his abilities and character. When Perceval became prime minister, Ward continued a firm supporter of the ministry and kept a political diary. The portions published by Phipps cover the period 1809&#150;May 1812 and October 1819&#150;November 1820. Croker declared the journals &#145;trustworthy and authentic&#146; but cautioned that apart from his under-secretaryship &#145;Ward &hellip; was not in what is considered confidential office&#151;and had little or no personal share in what we may call the interior working of the higher parts of the political machine&#146;  (Croker, 241&#150;2). Perceval offered him a place on the Treasury board but Ward preferred to remain at the Admiralty. However, when Lord Mulgrave became master-general of the ordnance he willingly transferred and was appointed clerk from June 1811. From 1812 he moved the ordnance estimates in the house and by 1816, with the establishment of peace he was able to announce a reduction of &pound;3 million. The earl of Mulgrave made way at the Ordnance for the duke of Wellington in 1818. After initial doubt about his position Ward remained in the post until April 1823. He was then granted the post of auditor of the civil list until its abolition as a sinecure by the whig government in 1831.<br>
<br>Ward's wife had died on 28 December 1821 and with his political career now over, he produced his first novel, <span class="italic">Tremaine, or, The Man of Refinement</span> (1825), published anonymously by Colburn. The work had been edited by Colburn's reader P. S. Patmore, who some two years later, their mutual identities now disclosed, became Ward's literary adviser and close friend. <span class="italic">Tremaine</span> was in essence a didactic work, in parts resembling a theological tract. Charles Tremaine is a dandy who flees fashionable society and a short-lived parliamentary career for his country estate. This life too he finds unsatisfactory. Protracted exchanges follow between Tremaine and a neighbouring clergyman, Dr Evelyn, on such themes as deism, free will, and the problem of evil. Tremaine, whose ideas contain many of the assumptions of eighteenth-century <i>philosophes</i>, is gradually won over to orthodox Christianity and the hand of Evelyn's daughter Georgina. The novel had drawn a flattering portrait of fashionable society and was an immediate success, selling 1500 copies in three weeks. It was a pioneer of the silver fork genre, Michael Sadleir calling it &#145;the chief impulse to <span class="italic">Vivian Grey</span>&#146; and &#145;the inspiration of the two most influential novelists of the 'thirties and 'forties&#146;  (Sadleir, 117).<br>
<br>Ward's second novel, <span class="italic">De Vere, or, The Man of Independence</span>, appeared in four volumes in 1827, and may have prompted Canning's quip that Ward's law books were as interesting as novels and his novels as dull as law books. <span class="italic">De Vere</span> took ambition as its main subject, and Ward considered it as didactic as <span class="italic">Tremaine</span> but more dramatic. Sharply contrasted with the world-weary Tremaine, Mortimer De Vere is the unworldly idealist whose subsequent enlightenment comes when he enters parliament. He finds himself unwilling to be the tool of his uncle Lord Mowbray and instead gives his support to the opposition leader Wentworth. De Vere declares he will put his trust in &#145;measures not men&#146;, and for this his uncle disowns him. Some of the characters were portraits of actual political figures, Wentworth apparently a composite of Pitt, Canning, and Bolingbroke, and Mowbray in part modelled on the duke of Newcastle. <span class="italic">De Vere</span> was a detailed study of the political ethos and politics the motivation behind the action. Its main weakness was a lack of imaginative power  (Rosa, 67&#150;8).<br>
<br>On 16 July 1828 Ward married the wealthy widow Jane Lewin, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hamilton (1768&#150;1831), a granddaughter of the seventh earl of Abercorn. Her first husband had been William Plumer (<i>d</i>. 1822), and her second husband Richard John Lewin RN (<i>d</i>. 1827). Subsequent to the marriage settlement, Ward assumed the additional name and arms of Plumer. Robert Plumer Ward at once took up residence at his wife's estate, Gilston Park, Hertfordshire, and served as sheriff of Hertfordshire in 1832. Mrs Plumer Ward seems to have been on bad terms with her husband's children  (Disraeli, <span class="italic">Letters</span>, 235&#150;6). She died on 26 March 1831 at Gilston shortly after the deaths within days of each other of Ward's two older daughters Catherine and Julia. His youngest daughter Anne died of the same consumptive illness as her sisters in 1835.<br>
<br>On 14 February 1833 Ward married his third wife, Mary-Anne Okeover (1803&#150;1875), daughter of the Hon. Sir George Anson GCB, and widow of the Revd Charles Gregory Okeover. She was the mother of a young son and daughter. Ward and she now spent long periods on the continent. <span class="italic">Illustrations of Human Life</span> (1837) appeared at this time. After his wife became the trustee of her son's estate at Okeover, Staffordshire, Ward and his new family left Gilston to Henry George Ward and his eight children. Ward wrote to Patmore in November 1838 saying &#145;my son is very welcome to all the cockneys and radicals of Herts. I never felt a real country gentleman before&#146;  (Patmore, 97). At this time he published <span class="italic">An historical essay on the real character and amount of the precedent of the Revolution of 1688</span> (2 vols., 1838). This was followed by <span class="italic">Pictures of the World at Home and Abroad</span> (3 vols., 1839) and at length his last novel, <span class="italic">De Clifford, or, The Constant Man</span> (4 vols., 1841).<br>
<br>In appearance Ward showed no trace of his Spanish ancestry &#145;his cast of countenance was essentially Saxon; and the bright blue eye, even flow of spirits, and indefatigable energy of his mind and body, proclaimed him a nature-born Englishman&#146;  (Phipps, 1.2). Croker said of him:<blockquote>he had abundance of small talk and lively conversation, with a prodigious untaught musical talent; and all through life, and even to the last&#151;though reduced to an ear trumpet&#151;he had a jaunty air, and appeared, both in countenance and figure, very much younger than he really was. (Croker, 274)</blockquote>Early in 1846, Ward, now in his eighty-first year, and his wife joined her father Lieutenant-General Sir George Anson at his official residence in Chelsea Hospital. Ward died there on 13 August 1846, after a sudden attack of angina pectoris.<br>
