<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Holles,  John</span>, first earl of Clare  (<em>d.</em> 1637), <span class="occ">landowner and politician</span>, was the son of Denzel Holles (1538?&#150;1590) and Eleanor, daughter of Edmund, Lord Sheffield. His year of birth is unknown. He matriculated at Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1579, was a fellow-commoner in 1580, and entered Gray's Inn in 1583. In April 1590 his father died, followed some nine months later by his grandfather Sir William Holles, &#145;by whose decease there devolved upon him a very fayre and opulent inheritance and with it the care of divers brothers and sisters&#146;  (Holles, <span class="italic">Memorials</span>, 89). Holles saw military service against the Armada in the Netherlands and Ireland where he was knighted by the earl of Essex in October 1593. He served as sheriff of Nottinghamshire in 1591&#150;2. After his marriage in 1591 to Anne Stanhope (1576&#150;1651), daughter of Sir Thomas Stanhope, Holles became an active supporter of his father-in-law in the latter's disputes with Gilbert Talbot, earl of Shrewsbury. Holles was twice challenged to a duel by Gervase Markham, a follower of Shrewsbury, but they did not fight until 1598. Although Markham was seriously wounded both men escaped punishment. In 1597, after he failed to appear in Star Chamber when charged with infringing a proclamation forbidding new buildings in London, Holles was fined and criticized by Lord Burghley. Holles, who never let a public rebuke or insult pass unanswered, replied to Burghley's attack on the social status of his ancestors with a similar attack on the Cecils. Holles wisely ensured he was aboard the Azores expedition when the letter was delivered.<br>
<br>Elected MP for Nottinghamshire in 1604 and 1614, Holles was not a leading member of the Commons but his collection of the shire's views on the great contract consolidated his position in the county. Although he served as a gentleman of the king's privy chamber, it was not until his appointment, in the autumn of 1610, as comptroller of Prince Henry's household, that his quest for an important court office was rewarded. After Henry's death Sir John's hopes of office through his patron Robert Carr, earl of Somerset, were dashed when evidence emerged which implicated the earl in the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury. Holles was prominent in the attempts to clear Somerset. These culminated in his unsuccessful plea to Richard Weston, at his execution at Tyburn for Overbury's murder, to absolve the earl. For his temerity Holles was fined &pound;1000 and imprisoned but it was Sir Edward Coke's stinging attack when he passed sentence which he never forgot and sought to avenge. After his release Holles hoped that appointment to office would recover his reputation. He was led to believe that &pound;10,000 would purchase the treasurership of the king's household and a barony. By the time Holles discovered that only a barony was offered he was too deeply engaged to withdraw without dishonour. Though he complained it meant there was &#145;no use in me for the King and the state, then my purs&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 1.132), in July 1616 he paid &pound;10,000 for the barony of Haughton.<br>
<br>As an adviser to Elizabeth, Lady Hatton, the estranged wife of Sir Edward Coke, Haughton seized every opportunity to attack his enemy. In 1617 he represented Lady Hatton in the negotiations for the marriage of her daughter Frances to Sir John Villiers, a brother of the earl of Buckingham. When it was discovered that Coke, who had been dismissed from the bench, also saw the marriage as a way of regaining favour, Frances was removed to the country. Coke, who accused but never proved that Haughton was responsible for his stepdaughter's seclusion, seized Frances and his terms for the marriage were accepted by Buckingham. When Lady Hatton tried to defeat her husband by claiming there was a prior contract of marriage to the earl of Oxford, Haughton advised her to concede and seek the best available terms. She made her peace but Haughton found himself out of favour with Buckingham and James I. In 1618, when Margaret Langford accused Coke in Star Chamber of forcing her to sell lands in Derbyshire to him, Sir Edward accused Haughton of inciting the action. It was not until 1623 that this charge was withdrawn, by which time Haughton, who contested every legal move of his adversary, had been twice imprisoned for defying the orders of the privy council and the Star Chamber. He did become more cautious for in 1621 his refusal to join in a Star Chamber action brought against Coke, by Lepton and Goldsmith, two aggrieved patentees, was praised in the Commons.<br>
<br>In 1624 Buckingham's intermediary Bishop Williams, the lord keeper, offered Haughton an earldom for &pound;6000. As a sign of his worth Haughton asked that office should accompany the honour. When he heard of Buckingham's &#145;willingness&#146; to appoint him to the council of war, and after securing a reduction in the price, Haughton paid &pound;5000 for the earldom of Clare (BL, Harley MS 7000, fols. 161<i>r</i>&#150;162<i>r</i>; <span class="italic">Letters</span>, 2.296&#150;7). Clare was not, however, appointed to the council of war and in his letters he became increasingly critical of the actions and influence of Buckingham. He joined the &#145;patriott&#146; lords in their defence of the privileges of the nobility and the liberties of the subjects  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 2.321, 334). In the 1626 parliament Clare was prominent in the attempts to free the earl of Arundel who had been imprisoned on the king's orders during the session. His fears that &#145;we gallopp all to the overthrow of Parliament &hellip;&#146; were intensified when the crown tried to raise a forced loan. The nobility were expected to set an example by their subscriptions but Clare refused to lend for he believed the loan was unlawful and established a dangerous precedent. Although the realization that the king supported the loan perplexed him, he resisted all strategies to make it appear that he had contributed and was removed from the commission of the peace.<br>
<br>In the 1628 parliament Clare supported the attempts of the Commons to &#145;settle the propriety and liberty of the subject&#146; and then to grant in subsidies a &#145;most bountifull retribution&#146; for this was &#145;a better way&#146; than &#145;either King or people be driven to extremes &hellip;&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 3.380). Clare played a leading role in the House of Lords debates, frequently arguing for accommodation with the Commons and the acceptance of the petition of right. In November 1629 Clare was imprisoned for possessing a pamphlet which urged the king to bridle the impertinency of parliaments and raise taxes by military force. It was eventually established that the proposals, which had been given to Clare by Somerset, had been rejected by James I and that the original was in Sir Robert Cotton's library. The charge that the pamphlet scandalized Charles I's government was now difficult to substantiate and the Star Chamber proceedings were withdrawn in May 1630. Clare believed he was prosecuted because of his opposition to the king's policies and his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13550/', "Denzil Holles's")</script> opposition in the Commons during the session of 1629. After a submission to the king, Clare was eventually restored to the commission of the peace and asked, in June 1630, to investigate the complaints of the town of Misterton. He continued to oppose what he believed were illegal proceedings and in his last year Clare was contesting his fines for building in London and enclosures in Nottinghamshire.<br>
<br>In 1629 Clare claimed he was unsuccessful in his search for court office because he was &#145;planted on the north side, where no court sunn shone, my nature advers to flatter greatnes, or to serve turns with base offices&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 3.390). This explanation forgets his successes: the comptrollership of Prince Henry's household, and, though it proved unlucky, his alliance with Somerset. As the years 1615&#150;19 showed it was his combative temperament which led him to obstruct legal proceedings, and into unwise actions and his vendetta with Coke that undermined his search for office. It is no surprise that in 1618 James was reported to have &#145;no manner of liking to him in any sort&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 2.133) and his career never recovered from his actions in these years. His independence and determination to defend a cause did enable Clare in the years 1626&#150;9 to make an important contribution to the principled opposition to the attacks on the liberties of the subjects.<br>
<br>From 1591, when he succeeded his grandfather, to his death in 1637 Clare spent at least &pound;22,362 on the purchase of land in Nottinghamshire and Middlesex and &pound;15,000 on the acquisition of peerages. In Nottinghamshire he concentrated on the consolidation of the properties he inherited around Haughton, the family seat. In Middlesex he followed a similar policy, adding to and improving his properties in and around the parish of St Clement Danes. As the profits from the lucrative London property market increased they came in the 1630s probably to amount to approximately half his rental income, which was about &pound;4000 at his death  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 1.xvii&#150;xxiii). He died on 4 October 1637 at Thurland House, Nottingham, and was buried three days later at St Mary's, Nottingham. His son and namesake <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13555/', "John Holles")</script> succeeded to the earldom.<br>
<br>Despite the disappointments of his search for office Clare could console himself that though he became a &#145;chapman&#146; to purchase titles, he had settled his house in honour  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 1.135), and by his careful stewardship they had a more than sufficient income to maintain their status.<br>
