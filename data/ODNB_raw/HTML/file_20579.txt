<span class="headword">Ogden,  James</span>  (1718&#150;1802), <span class="occ">poet and author</span>, was born in Manchester, and while his parentage remains to be discovered, it is known that he was one of at least three children and the cousin of the well-known author the Revd Samuel Ogden. His childhood and personal life remain equally obscure, though it can be determined that he fathered at least one son, William Ogden (1753&#150;1822). It seems that the Ogden family had a close connection with the local cotton industry in the Manchester district and thus James found early employment as a fustian shearer, before travelling as a young man to Europe where he visited France and Germany, spent a year in the Netherlands at either The Hague or Leiden, and witnessed the battle of Dettingen on 23 June 1743.<br>
<br>On his return to England, Ogden soon took up a post as master of a school in connection with the Manchester collegiate church, and it was probably about this time that he secured the patronage of the first Lord Ducie. Ogden was not a physically imposing man, later described by William E. A. Axon as &#145;rather under the middle height, with spare but sinewy frame, a thin face, ruddy complexion, and large aquiline nose&#146;  (Ogden, <span class="italic">Manchester</span>, xv), but he had a &#145;cheerful disposition, and natural urbanity, [which] endeared him to a large circle of acquaintance&#146;  (<span class="italic">Manchester Gazette</span>). He maintained well-defined and strong opinions on diverse subjects: he was an advocate of the abolition of the slave trade, held a peculiar dislike for what he called the &#145;modern game&#146; of cricket  (Ogden, <span class="italic">Archery</span>, 55), and had a passion for archery which saw him distinguished as an officer in a Manchester archery society.<br>
<br>By 1772 Ogden had returned to his former trade as a fustian shearer, continuing well into the 1790s in this line of employment, but it was his literary pursuits which over the years brought him fame. The <span class="italic">Manchester Gazette</span>, in an obituary notice, stated that he was &#145;a person well known in the literary world&#146;, and although the <span class="italic">Manchester Directory</span> designates him as a poet for the first time in 1797, Ogden's first publications appeared some thirty-five years earlier with <span class="italic">An Epistle on Poetical Composition</span> (1762), a poem entitled <span class="italic">On the Crucifixion and Resurrection</span> (1762) which was an orthodox comment on Jesus Christ published specifically for release on Good Friday, and <span class="italic">The British Lion Rous'd, or, Acts of the British Worthies, a Poem in Nine Books</span> (1762) which was published by subsidy of 600 subscribers and is indicative of the kind of recognition Ogden's literary talents received. As a poet Ogden was more consistently productive than prolific in the years to follow, with his writings presenting fairly standard, albeit poetically elegant, observations on the subjects he discussed. In 1774 he produced <span class="italic">A Poem, on the Museum, at Alkrington, Belonging to Ashton Lever</span>, followed some years later by <span class="italic">The Revolution, an Epic Poem</span> (1790) which presents William III as a hero and is devoted to the third Lord Ducie, nephew of Ogden's former patron; <span class="italic">Archery: a Poem</span> (1793), a composite volume praising the sport of archery as well as a concluding piece, in recognition of his subscribers' interests, on agricultural pursuits; and <span class="italic">Emanuel, or, Paradise Regained: an Epic Poem</span> (1797). Ogden's two most interesting and important poetical compositions appeared some twelve years apart, the first being <span class="italic">Poem, Moral, Philosophical and Religious, in which is Considered the Nature of Man</span> (1788), which was published anonymously. Arguably his finest poem, this work encompasses by way of subject the grand moral scheme of providing all the women of Manchester and its districts with good husbands, this to be achieved by a reform in domestic economy; Ogden also advocates a gradual abolition of the slave trade. His other significant work was also his last: <span class="italic">Sans Culotte and Jacobine, an Hudibrastic Poem</span> (1800). This is a staunchly conservative piece of writing which rejects calls for political reform, particularly universal suffrage and annual parliaments, on the grounds that such reforms would promote corruption and bribery in the world of politics. Ogden also argues that political changes would ultimately destroy the industrial spirit of the British nation by diverting the attention of the people away from work towards politics. For these reasons Ogden goes on to oppose the whig calls for Manchester to be represented in parliament. The author further confirms his conservatism in a prefixed song dedicated to the volunteer forces which defended church and state during the 1790s against radical enthusiasts. Ironically the work was published by Ogden's son William who later distinguished himself as an ardent radical reformer.<br>
<br>Ogden's efforts as a writer of prose were less voluminous, but no less significant, with <span class="italic">A Description of Manchester</span>, originally published anonymously in 1783 and reprinted in 1887 as <span class="italic">Manchester a Hundred Years Ago</span> with an introduction by William E. A. Axon, and <span class="italic">A concise narrative of all the actions, in which the British forces were engaged, during the present war, on the continent of Europe</span> (1797). Ogden resided for many years at 27 Wood Street, with his son living in later years at 26 Wood Street, until his death in Manchester, on 13 August 1802, at the age of eighty-four. While it is understood that he was buried in the grounds of the Manchester collegiate church, the location of his grave remains to be discovered.<br>
