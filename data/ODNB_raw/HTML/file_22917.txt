<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pye,  John</span>  (1782&#150;1874), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was born in Birmingham on 7 November 1782, the sixth child of Charles Pye, writer, and Ann, daughter of William Radclyffe. He was baptized on 24 January 1783 at St Philip's, Birmingham. His father had, in expectation of a sizeable inheritance, seen no need to practise any trade. A lawsuit, however, dashed his hopes, and obliged him to support his family by writing works on local history and antiquities&#151;subjects he had already explored as a gentleman amateur. His son did not receive any extensive schooling beyond basic instruction in engraving gained from his father, who had engraved illustrations for his works himself.<br>
<br>Pye moved to London in 1801 to become a paid assistant of James Heath ARA, to whom his elder brother <a href="#cosubject_22917">Charles Pye [<i>see below</i>]</a> was already apprenticed. On 29 May 1809, at St Marylebone, Westminster, he married Mary, daughter of the engraver Samuel Middiman; they had an only child, Louisa Eliza (1818&#150;1904). Much of Pye's work at this period consisted of engravings of historical buildings and landscapes for topographical works such as Thomas Dunham Whitaker's <span class="italic">History of Richmondshire</span> (1823). He also produced vignettes for various pocket-sized ladies' annuals such as <span class="italic">The Amulet</span>. Throughout his career Pye remained fiercely loyal to the line engraving medium.<br>
<br>J. M. W. Turner had praised Pye's skill in rendering subtle light effects when the latter engraved <span class="italic">Pope's Villa</span> in 1809  (Rawlinson, 1.xxv&#150;xxvi, lxvi); in later years Pye engraved several other Turner landscapes. Despite Pye's strong reciprocal admiration for Turner, his large engraving of the latter's <span class="italic">Ehrenbreitstein</span> (1845) was the only instance in which the painter and engraver entered into a direct contractual relationship to engrave, print, and publish a specific work. In contrast to the eagerness with which younger engravers courted popular painters such as Edwin Landseer for engraving contracts in the 1840s, Pye remained largely aloof. He produced only one engraving after a work of Landseer, <span class="italic">All that Remains of the Glory of William Smith</span> (1836). This is surprising given Landseer's respect for Pye, whom he was to call in 1854 &#145;the head of a particular school of art which had taught all who followed him&#146;  (Dyson, &#145;Images interpreted&#146;, 33). Although Pye had his admirers, his position as leader of and spokesman for his fellow engravers was not justified by any superior quality appreciable in his work. It was rather his organizational skills and seniority relative to his somewhat younger colleagues that gained him their respect.<br>
<br>Pye hoped to raise the fortunes, status, and public profile of engravers by means of professional association and co-operation. He was active at the birth of the Artist's Joint Stock Fund in 1819. Despite much internal wrangling, the fund grew and was chartered in 1827, when Pye was its president. It was at the fund's annual dinner on 23 January 1823 that Pye made an address urging engravers to associate and publish their own prints. In this way, he argued, engravers would cut out manipulative printsellers and receive a larger proportion of the revenue from prints. Pye's friend the painter William Mulready offered the copyright of his popular playground scene, <span class="italic">The Wolf and the Lamb</span>, to facilitate this endeavour. The print (1824) realized a profit of over &pound;1000 for the associated engravers.<br>
<br>Emboldened by this success, Pye went on in 1827 to propose a series of engravings after paintings in the National Gallery, which had opened to the public in 1824. He gathered together a group of engravers including George Doo, William Finden, and others for this purpose. Pye found his hopes for the project, which he believed could have been &#145;a monument honourable to the country&#146;, shared by the well-known collector of contemporary British art John Sheepshanks  (Pye Papers, National Art Library, fol. 50). Sheepshanks advanced &pound;3000 towards the venture, which, largely owing to Pye's efforts, had 870 subscribers by the end of 1831. Difficulties financing loans and the dilatory progress of several engravers, however, eventually terminated the project. Seven instalments in all appeared between 1832 and 1840; among them was Pye's engraving (1834) of Gaspar Dughet's <span class="italic">Abraham and Isaac</span>. Despite its failure, Pye's <span class="italic">Engravings from Pictures in the National Gallery</span> is noteworthy for being one of the earliest attempts to engrave paintings from a European public art gallery.<br>
<br>Parliamentary select committees on the arts and manufactures (1835&#150;6) and on art unions (1844) both questioned Pye in his capacity as the outspoken advocate of the engravers. In the 1844 art union select committee Pye was at pains to point out as &#145;a fact &hellip; not generally known, that the arts of this country have risen principally on engraving&#146;  (<span class="italic">Select Committee on Art Unions</span>, 224). The Royal Academy should, he argued, recognize the debt they owed to engravers as the creators of an open art market. Pye had been leading efforts to end the Royal Academy exclusion of engravers for election to full membership of the academy by means of petitions since 1812, when a memorial was sent to the prince regent. Although engravers could be elected to associate membership of the Royal Academy, Pye believed that to stand for election under these terms was both personally and professionally demeaning. In 1826 he and other leading engravers vowed never to do so; further petitions were to follow in 1836 and 1837. In 1836 and 1859 Pye was to publish pamphlets attacking the Royal Academy.<br>
<br>Pye's pamphlets echoed earlier jeremiads by other engravers, such as Robert Strange's <span class="italic">Conduct of the Academicians</span> (1771) and John Landseer's <span class="italic">Lectures on the Art of Engraving</span> (1807). The Royal Academy had insisted in 1812 that engravers were beyond the pale of art; even if they gained election, engraver associates were not allowed to vote on academy business or hold any office. To Pye this exclusion was conclusive evidence that the academy's principles were diametrically opposed to those of engraving, &#145;whose very essence is expansion and diffusion&#146;  (Pye, <span class="italic">Patronage</span>, 296). The Royal Academy's stance contrasted sharply with the compliments paid to Pye by foreign academies: he received a gold medal from the French government in 1846 and was elected to membership of the Paris and St Petersburg academies in 1862 and 1863 respectively.<br>
<br>Pye's most important publication was a history of the relationship between the visual arts and the state in Britain: his book <span class="italic">Patronage of British Art</span> (1845). This well-researched book traces the development of public, rather than noble, patronage from the middle of the eighteenth century onwards. Pye's history describes how Hogarth and other eighteenth-century figures made engraving into the profitable catalyst of a public sphere for art:<blockquote>the mass of the people became the first source of patronage open to native talent; hence, too, a new and vast channel of enterprise was opened to the commercial speculator; and the various powers of the painter's mind were applied, through the art of engraving, to advance the interests of trade, by cultivating and feeding the taste of the million, both at home and abroad. (ibid., 141)</blockquote>A profile drawing of Pye by William Mulready engraved by J. H. Robinson and reproduced in his <span class="italic">Patronage of British Art</span> records his high forehead, furrowed brow, and slightly ironic smile, which together evoke a probably characteristic expression of wry amusement.<br>
<br>Although he was uninvolved with the project, Pye was an important collector of rare states and proofs of Turner's engraved <span class="italic">Liber Studiorum</span>, which he held an indispensable resource to training the eye of professional artists and amateurs alike. Pye sold his collection to the British Museum in 1869. His death at his home, 17 Gloucester Crescent, Regent's Park, London, on 6 February 1874 deprived engravers of an individual who had been their best spokesman, albeit one whose faith in public taste and belief that commercial and aesthetic considerations could coexist in harmony often seem more at home in the late eighteenth-century world of Josiah Boydell. His leadership, however, was instrumental in encouraging engravers to associate for their mutual benefit and in forwarding projects which sought to make the relationship between engravers and their public closer and more aesthetically improving.<br>

<a name="cosubject_22917"></a><span class="headword">Charles Pye</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1776&#150;1864), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, elder brother of John, was born in Birmingham and baptized at St Philip's, Birmingham, on 2 December 1776. He was apprenticed to James Heath ARA in the 1790s, becoming specialized in line engraved illustrations for books and pocket annuals. Typical of these is his <span class="italic">Luxembourg Palace</span> (after a drawing by Frederick Nash) in J. Scott and P. B. de la Boissi&egrave;re, <span class="italic">Picturesque Views of the City of Paris and its Environs</span> (London, 1823). On 11 May 1809, at St James's Chapel, St Pancras, London, he married Alice Hughes (<i>d</i>. 1841). Pye retired to Leamington Spa by 1840 and died at his home on Church Street, Leamington, on 14 December 1864.<br>
