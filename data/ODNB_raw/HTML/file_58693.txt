<span class="headword">Giffard,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1731), <span class="occ">man-midwife</span>, about whose early life nothing is known, practised in Brentwood, Essex, before moving to Westminster, London, in 1724. From 1725 he began recording some of his midwifery cases, with a view to publication. Giffard recorded the use of the forceps from 8 April 1726. He called them his &#145;extractor&#146;. The blades were straight, not conforming to the pelvis though curved to fit the foetal head, whereas those depicted by Edmund Chapman in 1735 in the second edition of his book, <span class="italic">A Treatise on the Improvement of Midwifery</span>, also showed a curve to match that of the pelvis.<br>
<br>Giffard wrote his only work, <span class="italic">Cases in Midwifry</span>, at Brentwood, to where he had retired. The place is significant because it is near to Woodham Mortimer, where Peter Chamberlen, a member of the family of refugee Huguenots, who had invented the obstetric forceps, had prudently retired during the civil war. Chamberlen took his then secret instrument&#151;the obstetric forceps&#151;with him but about the beginning of the eighteenth century they became known to a few practitioners living nearby, Giffard included. Giffard's book was published posthumously in 1734 by Edward Hody, who wrote that it was &#145;an account of 225 mostly difficult cases and to which he had been summoned by midwives&#146;. Giffard believed that &#145;midwives should summon a male practitioner as soon as they encountered any difficulty in the birth; failure to do so he criticized as &#147;self-sufficiency&#148;&#146;  (Wilson, 98). The book has a frontispiece engraving of Giffard's forceps and of the forceps as &#145;improved&#146; by John Freke, surgeon at St Bartholomew's Hospital.<br>
<br>Giffard once used the forceps on a face presentation. He removed the placenta (afterbirth) manually after the birth of the baby. He recorded a case of the uterus turning inside out (inversion) when he had pulled on the cord attached to the placenta when it was still inside the womb. In breech deliveries he brought down the arms. For the after-coming head in breech presentations he used a finger in the mouth, and fingers over the shoulders to pull the head out of the pelvis. The manoeuvre was later attributed to William Smellie, though Giffard predated him by several years. He also supported the perineum at birth with his hand. This became known much later as von Ritgen's manoeuvre after he described it in 1828.<br>
<br>Giffard also recorded a case which was probably a tumour of the placenta (choriocarcinoma), and he early described the manner of stopping the ante-partum haemorrhage of placenta praevia (placenta in front of the presenting part of the foetus) by turning the presentation to that of the breech using a hand inside the uterus (internal version), then drawing down a leg so that the bleeding site could be compressed.<br>
<br>In his numerous cases Giffard described many obstetric complications dealt with in competent and practical fashion. He was among the first to write about them. Following the diffused knowledge of the forceps, many obstetricians in London evolved newer methods of coping with obstetric difficulties and taught their methods to students and medical practitioners. Giffard was in the forefront of these movements in ideas and practice. Hody described him as &#145;a plain man, remarkable for an honest, frank behaviour, of strong judgment, skilful and experienced in his profession and very charitable to the poor, averse to all kinds of flattery, and a generous and judicious practitioner&#146;  (Spencer, 18). Giffard died at Brentwood towards the end of 1731.<br>
