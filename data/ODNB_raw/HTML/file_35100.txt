<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Morgan,  Charles Langbridge</span>  (1894&#150;1958), <span class="occ">novelist and journalist</span>, was born on 22 January 1894 at Warreston, Rodway Road, Bromley, Kent, the youngest of four children of Sir Charles Langbridge Morgan (1855&#150;1940), civil engineer, and Mary (<i>d</i>. 1906/7), daughter of William Watkins. Both Charles and Mary Morgan spent their youth in Australia, but later returned to England, where Charles Morgan senior had a distinguished career, becoming president of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1923&#150;4. The young Charles Morgan entered the Royal Navy in 1907 and received his education at Osborne and Dartmouth, where he was cadet captain, and served as midshipman in the Atlantic Fleet and on the China station. Morgan experienced the ill treatment then common in the Royal Navy while serving in the <i>Good Hope</i>, but found encouragement for his literary aspirations in his immediate superior in the <i>Monmouth</i>, Commander Christopher Arnold-Forster, great-grandson of Thomas Arnold, headmaster of Rugby, and lifelong friend.<br>
<br>With the support of his father, Morgan resigned from the navy to follow a literary career, and was to have gone up to Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1914, but on the outbreak of war, he rejoined the Royal Navy and was involved in the Antwerp expedition with the naval brigade of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. After the fall of Antwerp, Morgan crossed into the Netherlands, where he remained interned until 1917. After a period of imprisonment Morgan was given parole and lived on the Rosendaal estate belonging to the De Pallandt family in Guelderland. It was among this family that he was introduced to the French language and culture which would become a lifelong influence. During this period Morgan had the opportunity to begin his apprenticeship as a novelist with a first novel, <span class="italic">The Gunroom</span> (1919), recounting his experiences as a young midshipman in the pre-war Royal Navy.<br>
<br>In 1919 Morgan was able to take his place at Oxford where he read history at Brasenose (1919&#150;21), and became president of the Oxford University dramatic society. Through the good offices of A. B. Walkley, francophile drama critic of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, Morgan joined the editorial staff of the paper, and on Walkley's death in 1926 he took over as principal theatre critic until 1939. Journalism was to provide the financial security he needed to begin writing novels.<br>
<br>On 6 June 1923 Morgan married fellow novelist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62359/', "Hilda Campbell Vaughan (1892&#150;1985)")</script>, daughter of Hugh Vaughan Vaughan of Builth, Brecknockshire, and Morgan's letters to her reveal how important she was in helping him to develop as a writer. Their two London homes were first at More's Garden in Chelsea and then from 1933 16 Campden Hill Square. They had two children, Elizabeth Shirley born in 1924, who married the seventh marquess of Anglesey in 1948, and Roger, born in 1926.<br>
<br>In 1925 Morgan published another apprentice work, <span class="italic">My Name is Legion</span>, but in 1929 he had greater success with <span class="italic">Portrait in a Mirror</span>, which won the Femina Vie Heureuse prize (1930). This was followed in 1932 by <span class="italic">The Fountain</span>, which drew on his wartime experience in the Netherlands and proved very popular in both England and America, winning the Hawthornden prize (1933). Another ambitious novel, <span class="italic">Sparkenbroke</span>, appeared in 1936, and <span class="italic">The Voyage</span> (1940), set in France in the late nineteenth century, came out just at the beginning of the Second World War and was awarded the James Tait Black memorial prize. In 1935 he published an essay, <span class="italic">Epitaph on George Moore</span>, in place of the biography of the novelist that Moore had wished him to write, and in 1938 his play <span class="italic">The Flashing Stream</span> was produced in London.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Morgan worked for naval intelligence and made a lecture tour of the United States for the Institute of International Education. He still found time to write: he brought out a short novel, <span class="italic">The Empty Room</span>, in 1941 and in 1942 he began a series of weekly articles for the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span> under the title &#145;Menander's mirror&#146;, republished in two volumes as <span class="italic">Reflections in a Mirror</span> (1944&#150;6). His love of France and its culture led him to become involved with the Free French in London, and a <span class="italic">Spectator</span> article translated as <span class="italic">Du g&eacute;nie fran&ccedil;ais</span> was published by &Eacute;ditions de Minuit in 1943. He also wrote an <span class="italic">Ode to France</span> (1942) which was read in September 1944 at the reopening of the Com&eacute;die Fran&ccedil;aise in Paris.<br>
<br>After the war Morgan returned to novel writing and produced an allegorical fable of good and evil, <span class="italic">The Judge's Story</span> (1947), and a tale of the resistance, <span class="italic">The River Line</span> (1949), which was turned into a play in 1952. A dark note, caused by his fears concerning the power of modern science, entered into his book of essays <span class="italic">Liberties of the Mind</span> (1951) and into his last play, <span class="italic">The Burning Glass</span> (1953). A long novel dealing with a similar theme was never completed and his two final novels, <span class="italic">A Breeze of Morning</span> (1951) and <span class="italic">Challenge to Venus</span> (1957), returned to lighter subjects.<br>
<br>During his career Morgan received honorary degrees from Scottish and French universities and was made an officer of the French L&eacute;gion d'honneur (1936). He took great satisfaction in 1949 when the Institut de France made him one of its members. From 1953 to 1956 he held the presidency of International PEN.<br>
<br>Although Morgan never sought a wide audience for his novels, they did achieve some degree of popularity during the 1930s, with <span class="italic">The Fountain</span> reaching a printing of 144,000. He claimed the seventeenth-century Neoplatonist Henry Vaughan and the Romantic poets as his literary antecedents, although his contemporaries compared him more with Walter Pater and George Moore. After the Second World War his abstract, almost allegorical stories and careful attention to style failed to reach wide audiences when social realism and satire proved more popular. His work was never taken seriously among literary critics in Britain, but in France his novels aroused some academic interest. Marius-Fran&ccedil;ois Guyard explained this by the French discovering in the novels their own idea of England, and pointed out that critics as varied as Paul Val&eacute;ry and Fran&ccedil;ois Mauriac took notice of Morgan's work  (Guyard, 77&#150;9). Morgan died on 6 February 1958 at his home, 16 Campden Hill Square, Kensington, London.<br>
