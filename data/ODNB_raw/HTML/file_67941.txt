<span class="headword">Treacy,  Eric</span>  (1907&#150;1978), <span class="occ">bishop of Wakefield and railway photographer</span>, was born on 2 June 1907 at 63 Kings Road, Willesden, London, the surviving twin son of George Treacy (1866&#150;1929), a furniture salesman, and his second wife, Annie Kate, daughter of Alfred Jopp of Aberdeen and his wife, Annie. A younger sister was born three years later. His father had been born in Burma, where his grandfather, an Irishman, had been a district commissioner. His paternal ancestors included William de Tracy, one of the knights responsible for the murder of Archbishop Thomas Becket. He attended a small private school in Willesden Green, and Haberdashers' Aske's School, Hampstead, from 1918 to 1925. He left school with below average matriculation results and remained acutely conscious throughout his life of his &#145;abysmal lack of education&#146;  (Peart-Binns, 8). However, he had excelled at sport, especially rugby and cricket, and had been heavyweight boxing champion for two successive years. Six feet tall and weighing over 14 stones, he was endowed with a burly physique and a craggy, florid complexion, enhanced by piercing blue eyes and well-groomed fair hair. He was mentally agile, genial, and personable and later maintained that he managed to hold his own wherever he found himself owing to &#145;a quick wit, a good memory, and more than a fair share of curiosity&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Treacy's parents were not churchgoers during his childhood years, but he later dated the beginning of his Christian experience from family seaside holidays in Norfolk, where he attended children's special service missions and first learned &#145;to pray rather than say my prayers&#146;  (Peart-Binns, 11). He was confirmed on 6 July 1922 and subsequently became a server and Sunday school teacher, attending initially the church of St Jude on the Hill, Hampstead Garden Suburb, and subsequently St Anne's Church, Highgate, whose vicar, James Adderley, was a fervent Christian socialist. After leaving school Treacy sought employment as an insurance agent, but soon discovered that he hated office work. Having joined Toc H, he offered his services as a boxing instructor at a boys' club in Kentish Town, where he began to develop a vocation for the Anglican ministry. He entered King's College, London, as an evening student, but after three hopelessly unsuccessful attempts at the Latin examination moved north in 1929 to take charge of the Shrewsbury School mission, a large boys' club and residential home in the socially deprived dockland of Liverpool. There he developed communication and leadership skills that shaped the future course and style of his ministry, which was spent almost entirely in the industrial north. He completed his theological studies at St Aidan's College, Birkenhead, and was ordained deacon in 1932 and priest in 1933, serving as curate at Liverpool parish church from 1932 to 1934.<br>
<br>Treacy married a voluntary social worker, Mary (May) Leyland Shone (1902&#150;1985), the daughter of James Arthur Shone, a Methodist flour miller, magistrate, and member of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, at St Luke's Wesleyan Methodist Church, Hoylake, on 16 June 1932. The marriage was one of total mutual dependence, strengthened by the early loss of a stillborn child and the lack of any other children. In 1936 Treacy was appointed vicar of St Mary's, Edgehill, where he remained until he became a chaplain to the forces in 1940. He proved an outstanding army padre, encouraging some 150 men and officers, nearly a quarter of the 59th medium regiment, to join his confirmation classes in 1944. Moreover, during the regiment's service in Normandy, Treacy was mentioned in dispatches for gallantry and subsequently appointed MBE.<br>
<br>After the Second World War, Treacy moved across the Pennines to become successively rector of Keighley (1945&#150;49), archdeacon and vicar of Halifax (1950&#150;61), bishop-suffragan of Pontefract (1961&#150;8), and bishop of Wakefield (1968&#150;76). The translation of a non-graduate to a diocesan see at the age of sixty-one was testimony to the high regard in which he was held throughout the diocese of Wakefield, where he had served for nearly twenty years. A self-styled liberal evangelical, he was regarded widely as a cleric of middle ground views, and was seen by many as a stabilizing force within the Church of England. He was highly articulate, adept at using the media, forthright in his views, and not afraid to address controversial issues.<br>
<br>Although some of Treacy's views were progressive, his instincts were basically conservative. He voted for reunion with the Methodists in 1969 and was willing to accept women priests, but described <span class="italic">Honest to God</span> as &#145;a dangerous book likely to disturb the faith of more people than it will stimulate&#146;  (Peart-Binns, 164) and did not welcome new translations of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. He encouraged the Church of England to retain the rite of exorcism, but only within stringent safeguards, after a notorious exorcism in his own diocese had resulted in the killing of a young mother by her estranged husband. Similar paradoxes were evident in his pronouncements on social issues. He criticized legislation which allowed eighteen-year-olds to marry without parental consent, but was sympathetic to the remarriage of the innocent victims of broken marriages in church. He advocated the birching of young delinquents in the early years of his ministry at Liverpool, but later regularly visited prisoners serving life sentences at Wakefield and campaigned for penal reform. He condemned the blasphemous rantings of the television comedy character Alf Garnett, but refused to support campaigners trying to prevent a Scandinavian director from entering Britain to make a film purporting to portray the sex life of Christ. In his role as bishop he found it difficult to reconcile synodical government with episcopal authority and tended to act autocratically, but was widely respected for his pastoral concern, rushing to the pithead of Lofthouse colliery in March 1973 in the early hours of the morning when he heard that miners were trapped underground, and declining an increase in stipend in 1974 to empathize with his low-paid parochial clergy.<br>
<br>Treacy's major recreation, railway photography, sprang from his rapport with railwaymen parishioners in Edgehill during the recession of the early 1930s. His photography earned him an unparalleled national reputation and the sobriquet of the &#145;footplate bishop&#146;. By the late 1930s his technically accomplished style, with an artist's eye for portraying a locomotive in the landscape, had become instantly recognizable. &#145;I am wanting to do with my camera what I could only do with a box of watercolours&#146;, he once proclaimed, &#145;to catch that indefinable spell of railways, to make visual something that can only be felt&#146;  (Thomas, 7). He once perched on the girders of the Forth Bridge to capture the drama of steam locomotive traction crossing the estuary. He published the first of eight collections of railway photographs in 1946, including his finest book, <span class="italic">Steam Up</span> in 1949, in which he emphasized that his approach was essentially &#145;emotional&#146;  (ibid., 11). As steam locomotion declined he began to photograph diesels, but less enthusiastically, and became a keen supporter of steam preservation societies.<br>
<br>Following Treacy's retirement, on 31 October 1976, to his country retreat at The Ghyll, Applethwaite, on the lower slopes of Skiddaw, near Keswick, he frequently visited Appleby railway station, where he suffered a major coronary attack photographing the <i>Evening Star</i>, the last steam locomotive built for British Rail, and collapsed and died on 13 May 1978. His death was widely reported in the national news media and he was buried on 19 May at Crosthwaite parish church, near Kendal, Westmorland. In addition to a memorial service held at Wakefield Cathedral on 27 June 1978, some 4000 people gathered at Appleby Station on 30 September 1978 for an open-air memorial service. Subsequently a new community centre and meeting place for the diocese adjoining Wakefield Cathedral was named in his memory and a new electric railway locomotive was named the <i>Bishop Eric Treacy</i> by his widow in May 1979.<br>
