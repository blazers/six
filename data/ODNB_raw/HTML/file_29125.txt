<span class="headword">Weston,  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1572), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was probably a grandson of William Weston (<i>d</i>. 1513/14) of Essex and London, mercer, and lived in Essex until his death. The arms on his monument were the same as William's but differenced by a martlet charged with a molet, indicating that he was the third son of a fourth son. To judge from his standing in the Middle Temple, he was probably admitted in the mid-1530s, in which case he would have been born in the 1510s. That makes it difficult to identify him with the youngest son of Richard Weston of Colchester, Essex, who (together with two elder brothers) was under age at his father's death in 1541&#150;2. Some pedigrees make him the second son of John Weston of Lichfield, Staffordshire, who was the fourth son of John Weston of Rugeley, and whose descendants included two judges in the reign of Charles I. Nothing is known of the lawyer before 1548, when he was counsel to Admiral Seymour. In 1553 he was returned to parliament by Lostwithiel, and he served for three other constituencies in the 1550s. About 1554, the year in which he became a justice of the peace for Essex, he succeeded Anthony Browne (another Essex Middle Templar) as clerk of assize on the home circuit. That was also the year in which he delivered his only reading in the Middle Temple, on a statute of 1539 concerning joint tenants and tenants in common. Now well established in his profession, he purchased in January 1555 the manor of Skreens in Roxwell, near Writtle, Essex, which he made his principal seat. He acquired various other lands in Essex, from Tilbury in the south to Dunmow in the north.<br>
<br>On 20 November 1557 Weston was appointed solicitor-general, an office that ended on the demise of the queen one year later. However, on 26 January 1559 he was created serjeant-at-law at a single call, the first of its kind for a serjeant who was not being appointed a chief justice. It seems that he was already marked to fill the vacancy in the common pleas created by Catlin's promotion on 22 January, but he was made to serve at the bar for most of the year as one of the queen's serjeants before he received his judicial patent in October 1559. He remained a puisne justice of the common pleas until his death on 6 July 1572, when he was buried at Writtle, Essex, near the body of his second wife. There is a tomb chest in the church with three brass shields of arms, but no inscription or effigy, in accordance with his testamentary wish that it should be &#145;made withoute curiositie&#146;. The impalements on the shields record his three marriages. His first wife was Wyburgh (<i>d</i>. 1553), daughter of Anthony Catesby of Whiston, Northamptonshire, and widow of Richard Jenour (<i>d</i>. 1548) of Great Dunmow, Essex, clerk of the court of surveyors. Their only son, Jerome, was the father of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29126/', "Richard Weston, first earl of Portland")</script>. They also had a daughter. The judge's second wife was Margaret, daughter of Eustace Burneby and widow of Thomas Addington. They had one son, Nicholas, still under age in 1572, and two daughters. His third wife, whom he married in 1566, was Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Lovett of Astwell, Northamptonshire, widow of Anthony Cave and of John Newdegate. Elizabeth died in 1577.<br>
