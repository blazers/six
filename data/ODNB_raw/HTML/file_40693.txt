<span class="headword">Goldie,  Grace Murrell  Wyndham</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Grace Murrell Nisbet]</span>  (1900&#150;1986), <span class="occ">television producer</span>, was born on 26 March 1900 in Glenfinnan, in the district of Arisaig, Inverness-shire, the only daughter and second of the three children of Robert James Nisbet, civil engineer, and his wife, Alice Isabel Wright. Her father's work took him to Egypt and Grace first attended school at the convent of Notre Dame de Sion in Alexandria. In 1916 the family returned to Britain and she was educated at Cheltenham Ladies' College. Despite a warning that her early schooling abroad would prevent her from going on to tertiary education, she managed to enter Bristol University, where she took a first-class honours degree in history (1921). She then went to Somerville College, Oxford, and achieved a second class in philosophy, politics, and economics (1924).<br>
<br>For the next three years Nisbet taught history at Brighton and Hove high school. Petite and birdlike, in 1928 she married the handsome actor Frank Wyndham Goldie (1894&#150;1957), the son of Lewis Alexander Goldie, solicitor, and his wife, Phillis Payne. They lived in Liverpool for six years, during which she lectured on drama, acted as an examiner in history, read plays for the repertory theatre where her husband was working, and wrote a book on its history, <span class="italic">The Liverpool Repertory Theatre, 1911&#150;1934</span> (1935). In 1934 they moved to London and for the next seven years she wrote radio criticism for <span class="italic">The Listener</span>, turning her attention to television when it started in 1936. During the Second World War she spent two years (1942&#150;4) at the Board of Trade before joining the BBC staff in 1944 as a talks producer, replacing Guy Burgess.<br>
<br>Goldie produced some major current affairs series such as <span class="italic">Atomic Energy</span> (1947) and <span class="italic">The Challenge of our Time</span> (1948). In 1948 she moved to the television talks department at Alexandra Palace, to the disappointment of Bertrand Russell, who said, &#145;My dear girl, television will be of no importance in your lifetime or mine; I thought you were interested in ideas.&#146; She was indeed; and she managed to translate political or international ideas into effective television programmes. She successfully enlisted academics such as David Butler and Robert McKenzie to take part in the mammoth election results programmes which she mounted, beginning in 1951. She also encouraged political ministers to appear on the new medium in <span class="italic">Press Conference</span>. In 1949 Goldie started <span class="italic">Foreign Correspondent</span>, shortly to be followed by <span class="italic">International Commentary</span>, <span class="italic">Race Relations in Africa</span>, and <span class="italic">India's Challenge</span>, all well-researched programmes, with articulate presenters such as the war correspondents Chester Wilmot and Edward Ward, as well as Christopher Mayhew and Aidan Crawley, then both former right-wing Labour MPs with considerable experience of the responsibilities of government and an interest in communication. Her regular use of these and other former Labour MPs led some Conservatives to complain that she was a well-known socialist. In fact her political instincts were Conservative, and her husband worked part-time for the Conservative central office. In 1954 a new head of television talks was appointed and Goldie became the assistant head of the department. Her high standards and her mastery of television techniques made her a valuable trainer of production staff who sought attachments to an expanding and highly regarded department. Without children herself, she particularly enjoyed recruiting and training youngsters. She excelled at starting new programmes, and making sure that they began well, but she tended to interfere with the minutiae of programme content, and it was not always easy for producers, especially the women, to work with her. She was described as having a whim of iron, and once a new series, such as the revamped current affairs vehicle <span class="italic">Panorama</span>, the daily magazine <span class="italic">Tonight</span>, or the arts programme <span class="italic">Monitor</span>, had been successfully launched, it was imperative to direct her restless energy elsewhere. She continued to produce major programmes herself, such as the tribute on Sir Winston Churchill's eightieth birthday in 1954, and <span class="italic">Men Seeking God</span>. In 1958 she was appointed OBE.<br>
<br>After the death of her husband in 1957, Goldie found relaxation difficult. Reluctant to return to her empty flat, she would remain late at the studios, arguing and dissecting programmes. Emboldened in the hospitality room, she would tell cabinet ministers, with the same asperity she showed to producers, what she thought of their performances. In 1962 she became head of talks and current affairs. After retirement in June 1965 she wrote <span class="italic">Facing the Nation</span> (1977), a definitive book about television and politics. Grace Goldie died in London at her flat in Kensington, 86 St Mary Abbots Court, Warwick Gardens, on 3 June 1986.<br>
