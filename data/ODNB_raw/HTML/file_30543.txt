<span class="headword">Bairstow, Sir  Leonard</span>  (1880&#150;1963), <span class="occ">aeronautical engineer</span>, was born on 25 June 1880 at Halifax in Yorkshire, the son of Uriah Bairstow, a commercial clerk, and his wife, Elizabeth Lister. He attended schools in Halifax, from where he went, in 1898, on a scholarship to the Royal College of Science, London. There he became a Whitworth scholar in 1902. In 1904 he entered the engineering department of the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) at Teddington, Middlesex, where he worked under T. E. Stanton on the problems of fatigue and of aerodynamics. In 1909 he moved to the new section of aerodynamics and became the principal in charge. There he carried out pioneer investigations into wind tunnel design, tested models, and measured the aerodynamic derivatives in the NPL wind tunnel. One of his assistants at the time was E. F. Relf.<br>
<br>In 1917 Bairstow was appointed to the Air Board where he worked for Sir David Henderson on aircraft design and aerodynamics research. As deputy to Alexander Ogilvie he co-ordinated the departmental work on structural strength, aerodynamics, performance, and airscrews. In 1920 he was appointed professor of aerodynamics at Imperial College, London, and in 1923 he became Zaharoff professor of aviation and head of the department of aeronautics.<br>
<br>Bairstow was a member of the advisory committee of aeronautics (later the Aeronautical Research Committee and during the Second World War expanded into the Aeronautical Research Council) from 1921 to 1955 and was its chairman from 1949 to 1952. He served on over fifty committees and had an unequalled record of service. In 1917 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society and appointed CBE. He gave the seventh Wilbur Wright memorial lecture in 1919&#151;an event well remembered for the subsequent controversy in which Bairstow's references to S. P. Langley's &#145;heavier than air&#146; aircraft were ultimately justified. The first edition of his <span class="italic">Applied Aerodynamics</span> was published in 1920; it was the first, and for many years the only, comprehensive textbook in this field. He was chairman of the council of the Royal Aeronautical Society in the year 1922&#150;3. He married, first, Eleanor Mary Hamer (<i>d</i>. 1926); they had one son and one daughter. In 1930 he married Florence Katharine, the eldest daughter of D. J. Stephens, of Llandaff.<br>
<br>Bairstow was involved in two great controversies, whose outcome ultimately had considerable effect on the development of aeronautical research. Bairstow was a doughty fighter, always well equipped with extensive knowledge and powerful arguments, and it required considerable new experimental work and most careful theoretical exposition to convince him of his mistakes.<br>
<br>The first controversy arose over discrepancies between the measurements of aerodynamic derivatives made in an aeroplane in flight at the Royal Aircraft Establishment by W. S. Farren and G. P. Thomson and measurements made in wind tunnels at the NPL. Bairstow argued, with reason and conviction, that measurements made in a wind tunnel, by skilled observers, with accurate instruments, under ideal conditions, must be more reliable and were more reproducible than observations made by a pilot distracted by the problems of manoeuvring an aircraft. Tests on a standard aerofoil carried out in foreign laboratories failed to resolve the matter, which was eventually traced to a difference of turbulence between wind tunnels and the free air. Bairstow himself was finally convinced of the effects of turbulence in wind tunnels, and the long-running controversy ultimately led to important advances in the design of wind tunnels and the use of models.<br>
<br>The second controversy was over the theory of the &#145;boundary layer&#146; of airflow round an aeroplane or wind tunnel model advanced by Ludwig Prandtl in 1904. Bairstow held that mathematical theory should encompass the whole surrounding air mass, rather than a thin layer, and he was inclined to reject Prandtl's argument. He was eventually persuaded to adopt it, whereupon he invented a rapid and precise method of solving the necessary equations. His criticism of Prandtl's theory was undoubtedly justified and it was not until M. J. Lighthill had developed the theory of differential equations with singular perturbations that an adequate theory could be constructed. Bairstow should be remembered not only for his part in these controversies but also for his considerable contributions to knowledge of the stability of aircraft.<br>
<br>Bairstow's main contributions to aeronautical science were in matters of stability, but he also dealt with solutions of equations of motion in perfect and viscous fluids, and in his early days at NPL he investigated some engineering problems of explosions and strength of materials. In the course of his investigations into stability, Bairstow made a number of small gliding models from mica sheets and aluminium foil. He also applied the model method to the design of wind tunnels, and in later papers he studied the stability of balloons and airships. His researches on the tail oscillations which occur in an aeroplane represent the first attempt to understand the important problem of flutter.<br>
<br>Bairstow's experience led to his appointment to two government committees which investigated the accidents to the airships R 38 and R 101. Unfortunately his earlier work, which would have permitted calculations of the structural stresses due to aerodynamic forces on the R 38, had not been consulted and it was not until after the accident that the accidents investigation subcommittee (in 1922) called attention to the dangerously low factor of safety.<br>
<br>In the case of the R 101 the airworthiness of airships panel, under the chairmanship of Bairstow, was intimately associated with the airship's design and construction and would have made the complete re-examination of the aerodynamic calculations necessitated by modifications to the original design, but unfortunately the refusal of a cabinet minister to postpone the date of the projected flight to India made this impossible. The immediate cause of the R 101's crash in 1930 was the stormy weather over northern France which caused a substantial loss of gas from the balloons, which fretted against the metal structure.<br>
<br>Bairstow retired from Imperial College in 1945. He was made an honorary fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society the same year, and received its gold medal in 1946. He was knighted in 1952. He died at the county hospital in Winchester, Hampshire, on 8 September 1963, and was cremated at Southampton four days later. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
