<span class="headword">Lambert, Dame  Florence Barraclough</span>  (1871&#150;1957), <span class="occ">physician and public health administrator</span>, was born on 13 August 1871 at Northwick, Harrow, Middlesex, the daughter of Thomas Henry Lambert, a solicitor and a partner in the firm of Lambert Brothers, coal exporters, and his wife, Sarah Ann Harrison.<br>
<br>Florence Barrie Lambert, as she was known most of her life, was educated in France and then trained between 1895 and 1898 as a nurse at the London Hospital. In 1899 she went to South Africa as a nursing sister with the imperial yeomanry, and served until 1901. After returning to England she studied medicine at the London School of Medicine for Women, where she qualified MB BS (Durham), on 9 October 1906. Her main interest from then onwards was in public health, and in 1907 she obtained a diploma in public health from Cambridge University.<br>
<br>Lambert was fortunate in being able to devote time to voluntary work, in particular to child welfare. She became honorary director of the Central Council for Infant and Child Welfare, honorary secretary of the Central Council for the Care of Cripples, and an active member of the Invalid Children's Aid Society. This work channelled her interest into physical medicine, and she undertook postgraduate study at the University of Stockholm. As a result of this she was appointed physician in charge of the mechano-therapeutic department of the Charing Cross Hospital, London, and assistant physician in similar departments in London at St Mary's Hospital and the Royal Free Hospital. In 1913 she was elected a member of the State Medical Service Association, the precursor of the Socialist Medical Association.<br>
<br>Lambert's specialized knowledge of what became known as physiotherapy led to her appointment, in 1915, as inspector of military massage and electrical services, with the honorary rank of major in the Royal Army Medical Corps; she was also a member of the electro-medical committee of the War Office. She held these posts until 1919, when she was appointed a medical officer of the newly formed Ministry of Health. This office involved the inspection of child welfare and orthopaedic work carried out by local authorities throughout the country, which gave her a valuable insight into local government.<br>
<br>In 1921 Lambert resigned from the Ministry of Health in order to devote her talents to public service in the political field, and in March 1922 she was elected an alderman of the London county council (LCC). Throwing herself wholeheartedly into the work of the council she served on the public health committee from the year of her election, and chaired the committee from 1928. She was still chair in 1930 when, with greatly increased functions, it became the central health committee and subsequently the hospital and medical services committee. These bodies were charged with the enormous task of taking over the seventy-six hospitals (42,000 beds) previously administered by the Metropolitan Asylums Board. Lambert personally visited all these hospitals, and in spite of the economic crises of 1931 and 1933, when the Municipal Reform Party lost its majority at County Hall, she brought about or set in train many necessary changes.<br>
<br>After 1934 Lambert was &#145;leader of the opposition&#146; on the hospitals and medical services committee, but both she and her successor, Somerville Hastings (1878&#150;1967), had similar objectives and a keen desire to improve the public health and municipal health services in London, and they worked together in close co-operation. Appointed a CBE in 1920 for her war work, Lambert was made a dame commander in the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in 1938. When hospitals were nationalized in 1948, she was appointed a member of the South-East Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board, and she chaired the nursing committee. She retained her membership of the LCC health committee and strove to effect a close liaison between the work of the local health authorities and that of the regional hospital boards.<br>
<br>Lambert, who was also vice-president of the Medical Defence Union, resigned from her office as county alderman in 1952. She died at her home, 1 Langton Ridge, Langton, Speldhurst, Kent, on 11 December 1957. Not having married she left most of her estate to two nieces, Patricia Ainsworth Barnard and Joan Barrie Lambert. According to &#145;A.D.&#146;, writing in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>:<blockquote>Dame Barrie was indefatigable in her visits to hospitals. She had a tenacious memory and was an excellent debater. She was a firm supporter in time of trouble and tough when she felt she was right. She was no political partisan and was prepared to fight within her own party to get more money for hospitals. She was generally successful. She had vision and insight; these combined with her toughness enabled her to overcome obstacles. Few Londoners realise how much they owe to her for the whole-hearted energy with which she attacked the enormous problem of transforming the poor-law hospitals into a co-ordinated hospital system providing a first-rate service for the public. (<span class="italic">The Lancet</span>, 21 Dec 1957)</blockquote>
