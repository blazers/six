<span class="headword">Taylor,  Isaac</span>  (1730&#150;1807), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was born on 13 December 1730 in the parish of St Michael in Bedwardine, Worcester, the third of the seven known children of William Taylor (<i>fl</i>. 1710&#150;1753), brass-founder, and his wife, Anne (<i>fl</i>. 1710&#150;1740). In 1739 he was apprenticed to his father and he soon made a speciality of engraving book-plates and silverware. By the late 1740s his father's business interests included the production of engraved prints commemorating local events. At some point, perhaps in 1753, Taylor became a freeman of the city of Worcester, but the evidence for the date is confused. Early in 1752, after a quarrel with his father, he set off for London, walking &#145;by the side of the waggon&#146;  (C. Taylor, 593) and &#145;fired with the ambition of distinguishing himself as an artist&#146;  (I. Taylor, &#145;Jane Taylor&#146;, 81). Soon after his arrival in London he found work with Thomas Jefferys, the topographer and map engraver, and in due course was entrusted with the engraving of a number of plates for the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> and for <span class="italic">Owen's Dictionary</span>.<br>
<br>It was through this connection that Taylor met his future wife, Sarah Hackshaw Jefferys (1733&#150;1809), the niece and housekeeper of Thomas Jefferys and the daughter of Josiah Jefferys (1709?&#150;1770), a successful cutler, and his wife, Jane (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Hackshaw). They were married on 9 May 1754 at Shenfield, Essex, where Taylor's father-in-law had property. For a short time after his marriage Taylor practised unsuccessfully as a land surveyor at Shenfield, before returning to London to resume the profession of engraver. There were five children: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27021/', "Charles Taylor (1756&#150;1823)")</script>; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27033/', "Isaac Taylor (1759&#150;1829)")</script>; Josiah (1761&#150;1834), a successful bookseller and publisher; Sarah (1763&#150;1845), who married Daniel Hooper; and Ann (1765&#150;1832), who married James Hinton (1761&#150;1823) and was the mother of the Baptist minister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13356/', "John Howard Hinton (1791&#150;1873)")</script>. Isaac Taylor appears to have been more conscientious than loving as a father: he ensured that his sons were scrupulously well trained as engravers, but &#145;though a strictly moral man &hellip; he exhibited towards his family an austere reserve which was little calculated to awaken the domestic affections to genial life&#146;  (Gilbert, 1.5&#150;6).<br>
<br>Isaac Taylor undoubtedly fulfilled his ambition to distinguish himself as an artist and in particular as an engraver. Before about 1750 superior examples of the engraver's art had been virtually a monopoly of French and other continental engravers, but during Taylor's working lifetime, and owing in part to his own achievements, that pre-eminence passed decisively to England, albeit with the help of immigrants such as Francesco Bartolozzi, of whom Isaac Taylor's sons possibly became pupils. Taylor did, as was common practice, produce full-scale engravings of other artists' paintings&#151;his engraving for John Boydell, <span class="italic">A Flemish Collation</span> (1765), after Van Harp was an early example&#151;and between 1765 and 1780 he exhibited them and other works regularly at the Incorporated Society of Artists, of which he was a director in 1772&#150;3 and secretary from 1775 probably until his death.<br>
<br>However, Taylor's speciality was book illustration. In this field he almost always engraved to his own designs. After the death of Anthony Walker in 1765 he could lay claim to be the pre-eminent living illustrator. Among his finest works were the vignettes to the <span class="italic">Poetical Works</span> of John Langhorne (1766) and to Oliver Goldsmith's <span class="italic">Deserted Village</span> (1770) and the illustrations for Samuel Richardson's <span class="italic">Sir Charles Grandison</span> (1778). Towards the end of his active career Taylor also engraved a number of county maps. Plates engraved by him were said to wear better at the press than those of any other engraver of his time.<br>
<br>In 1770 Taylor bought the business, and premises at the Bible and Crown, Holborn, of the booksellers and publishers A. and Henry Webley, with whom he had worked as an engraver since 1767. Architectural works were already prominent in Webley's catalogues, and Taylor concentrated almost exclusively upon such publications. The business, which became known as the Architectural Library in 1787, later achieved, under Taylor's son Josiah, a virtual monopoly in this field. Taylor appears to have been a shrewd businessman and initially gave priority to the practical manuals required to support the building boom of the late eighteenth century, such as <span class="italic">The Practical Builder</span> (1774) by William Pain and <span class="italic">The Builder's Price Book</span> (1776). However, he also had an eye for emerging talent and was quick to secure the young John Soane for his list.<br>
<br>Engraving and publishing made Taylor's reputation and his fortune, but painting was perhaps nearer to his heart. He retired early when he was little more than fifty and moved from London to the village of Edmonton, Middlesex. There he amused himself by painting in oils.<br>
<br>Although Taylor's sons became prominent dissenters, there is no reason to suppose that Isaac Taylor was of that persuasion. According to his granddaughter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10681/', "Ann Gilbert (1782&#150;1866)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27039/', "Taylor, Jane")</script>], he was, though &#145;a man of sense and ability&#146;, not &#145;under the influence of Christian principle&#146;  (Gilbert, 1.5). He was a supporter of John Wilkes and lost the astonishingly large sum of &#145;considerably more than &pound;1000&#146;  (ibid., 1.184) as a result. He had many friends in the literary and artistic world, including Oliver Goldsmith, Francesco Bartolozzi, Robert Smirke, Henry Fuseli, and, probably, David Garrick. Thomas Bewick was his prot&eacute;g&eacute; and mentions him in his autobiography with affection and respect, despite the fact that Taylor had reacted ungraciously when the young Bewick decided to abandon a promising career in London.<br>
<br>Shortly after his marriage in 1754 Taylor painted a fine pair of portraits in oils of his wife and of himself, outdoor subjects in the manner of Gainsborough. Another surviving portrait, a pencil drawing of Taylor in late middle age, probably by his son Isaac, brings out the austere side of Taylor's nature. Isaac Taylor died at his home in Church Street, Edmonton, on 17 October 1807 and was buried on 24 October in the churchyard of the parish church of All Saints, Edmonton.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_27035"></a><span class="headword">James Taylor</span>  (1737/8&#150;1790), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was a younger brother of Isaac Taylor. He was born in 1737 or 1738 and it is a reasonable supposition that he was born in Worcester. He worked for some years as a china painter in Worcester, before following his brother to London, where he practised engraving, first in association with his brother and then independently. He exhibited at the Society of Artists between 1770 and 1776. Anker Smith was one of his pupils. He died, according to an obituary by his nephew Charles in the <span class="italic">Literary Panorama</span> of 1808, on 21 December 1790, aged fifty-two.<br>
