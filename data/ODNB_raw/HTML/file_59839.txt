<span class="headword">Yeats,  Susan Mary <span class="st"> [Lily]</span></span>  (1866&#150;1949), <span class="occ">embroiderer</span>, was born on 25 August 1866 at Enniscrone, co. Sligo, the second eldest of the four surviving children of John Butler Yeats (1839&#150;1922), barrister, painter, and writer, and Susan Mary (1841&#150;1900), eldest daughter of William Pollexfen, a merchant in Sligo, of an ancient Cornish family settled in Devon, and his wife, Elizabeth Middleton, an Irish middle-class protestant. Known as Lily, she shared the dark, good looks of her siblings, particularly the eldest, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37061/', "William Butler Yeats")</script> (the poet), to whom she was particularly close, and the strong-minded, affectionate nature of her eccentric father, to whom she was both devoted and stern. Because of their father's financial problems and their mother's nervous ill health, the children led an unconventional, precocious, insecure childhood, staying with relatives in Sligo and Devon, and in a succession of rented houses in London and Dublin. What Lily and her sister, <a name="cosubject_59839"></a><span class="headword">Elizabeth Corbet <span class="st"> [Lollie]</span> Yeats</span>  (1868&#150;1940), <span class="occ">printer</span>, who was born on 11 March 1868 in Fitzroy Road, London, lacked in formal education or good health, they learned through perseverance. Eventually, through the rich artistic contacts provided by their father and brothers, W. B. Yeats and the painter and graphic illustrator <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37060/', "Jack Butler Yeats")</script>, and self-imposed apprenticeships in needlework and printing skills, the two women were able to provide an outlet (if not an income) for their siblings' talents from 1902 onwards.<br>
<br>In 1888, when the family had gone to live in a house in London's Bedford Park, Lily Yeats worked in the embroidery workshop run from nearby Kelmscott House by William Morris's daughter, May. In order to provide her family with a much-needed weekly income, she spent six years making cushion covers, firescreens, and mantelpiece covers, teaching new recruits, and sometimes running the workshop in a tedious but invaluable apprenticeship. A four-poster bed hanging she had embroidered for Kelmscott Manor (<i>in situ</i>) from May Morris's design was exhibited with the English Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society in 1893; in 1895, the year after she resigned from May Morris's workshop, an embroidered mantle border represented her work in the Arts and Crafts Society of Ireland's first exhibition.<br>
<br>In 1902, when Yeats and her sister, Elizabeth, were invited by Evelyn Gleeson (1855&#150;1944), Gaelic leaguer and suffragist, to help set up a craft enterprise along the lines of Morris's utopian socialist ideals, they moved back to Dublin with their father. They took a cottage, Gurteen Dhas (&#145;pretty little meadow&#146;), in Churchtown, Dundrum, near the house, Dun Emer, in which Gleeson set up a printing press, carpet and needlework rooms, and other artistic ventures. While Elizabeth Yeats used her experience as a teacher, watercolourist, designer, and author of four successful books on her freehand brushwork technique, and took a short printing course in order to set up the Dun Emer Press, Lily Yeats drew on her Kelmscott experience to set up an embroidery workshop. Their brother Jack's strongly graphic designs of Irish figurative subjects, worked by local girls as banners for St Brendan's Cathedral, Loughrea, co. Galway, were among early designs adapted from the work of artists seminal to the Irish arts and crafts movement. By 1904 Lily was supervising the execution by seven girls of designs by various artists, including her sister, Elizabeth.<br>
<br>In 1908 disagreements with Evelyn Gleeson led to the Yeats sisters setting up their own Cuala Industries, a printing press and embroidery workshop in a nearby cottage. However successful and productive, they were continually beset with financial, emotional, and health problems. The First World War affected the luxury end of the embroidery workshop badly and in 1923 the end of the lease on Cuala forced the sisters to seek new premises. Using silk and woollen threads on linen or a distinctive blue silk poplin, their stylized floral and landscape designs were often by Elizabeth or Jack Yeats, or adapted from images by other contemporaries, even though signed &#145;Lily Yeats&#146;. By 1925, when the Cuala Industries moved into Dublin, the embroidery workshop was mostly reproducing old designs, partly because of Lily Yeats's increasing ill health. The last sale of embroidery made under her direction was held in 1931, although she continued to make &#145;little needle pictures&#146; from home until her death.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Yeats, initially guided by Emery Walker, the arts and crafts printer who had inspired William Morris, continued to handprint books, bookplates, calendars, hand-coloured prints, Christmas cards, and pamphlets featuring texts by the outstanding writers and illustrators of the Irish revival. The final catalogue of prints issued in her lifetime, <i>c</i>.1939, from Baggot Street, Dublin, offered ninety-seven different prints for sale. In total she published seventy-seven volumes, eleven of which were produced at Dun Emer, each corresponding to their earliest ideal of 14 point Caslon old style font, light ivory-toned rag, mould-made paper manufactured near Dublin, bound in a small quarto format between blue- or grey-covered boards with a linen spine. Her clearly legible, slender volumes with their distinctive paper labels may be seen as the sole survivors of the handcrafted ideal established in 1900 by Walker and T. J. Cobden-Sanderson's Doves Press. As well as exhibiting her printed and designed work throughout Britain and America, Elizabeth Yeats painted fans and furniture, and worked for the Women's National Health Association of Ireland. She died, unmarried, on 16 January 1940 in a nursing home in Dublin, and was buried on 18 January in St Nahi's Church, Dundrum, co. Dublin. Lily Yeats died, unmarried, on 5 January 1949 at her home in Churchtown following a stroke and was buried three days later at St Nahi's Church, Dundrum. A number of Yeats embroideries have been bequeathed to the National Gallery of Ireland, though many remain in private collections.<br>
