<span class="headword">Levett,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1554), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and gun-founder</span>, was the son of a substantial landowner in the Hollington area of Hastings, where he was born, and the brother of John Levett of Little Horsted, gentleman and ironmaster. He obtained an Oxford degree in canon law and was rector of Guestling in 1528 and of West Dean by 1529. He became rector of Buxted in April 1533, and the same year obtained the living of Stamford Ryvers in Essex. As deputy receiver of the king's revenue in Sussex in 1533, he would have had knowledge of Newbridge ironworks on the duchy of Lancaster estate in Ashdown Forest.<br>
<br>His executorship of the will of his brother John, proved in May 1535, involved Levett more closely in the iron trade. The executors were to lease John's iron mills and furnaces, the profits going, after payment of the debts and legacies, to John's son, who was not to occupy the ironworks himself. They included Stumbletts furnace, newly erected on the duchy estate in 1534, and it must be supposed that the executors leased these ironworks to William Levett himself. Levett's first supplies to the ordnance date from 1539 and in August 1540 he provided 15 tons of iron shot or &#145;gunstones&#146;. In March 1541 he was appointed &#145;goonstone maker&#146; to the king and received &pound;200 towards the casting of shot.<br>
<br>Henry VIII urgently needed cannon for his new coastal forts, but casting these in bronze would have been a formidable expense. Cast iron had already been used in the Weald to manufacture ordnance, but with separate barrels and breeches, after the fashion of wrought-iron guns. The bulk of Levett's new guns were muzzle-loaders, cast in one piece on the pattern of the latest bronze ordnance. By 1543 falconets were being made. The cascabel pattern and dodecagonal barrel of the Padstow gun, a demi-culverin perhaps cast in 1544, indicate the correctness of the tradition that royal gun-founders assisted at Levett's Buxted furnace. However, circular-sectioned, strictly functional designs with few embellishments soon evolved and between July 1545 and 1553 over three hundred guns of up to demi-cannon in size were supplied. The new guns were too heavy to find favour with the navy, but bronze was ten times more costly, so in fortifications and for arming merchant ships iron guns were preferred. Gradually, owing to their &#145;toughness and validitie&#146;, an important export trade in wealden guns built up and they remained dominant on the Amsterdam market until displaced by Swedish guns around 1620.<br>
<br>Metallurgically Levett needed to cast culverins and demi-cannon of 1500 to 2000 kg, but contemporary furnace hearths produced only around 500 kg of metal at one tapping. A larger hearth was clearly needed, but when appointed to oversee the ironworks at Worth in December 1546, after the attainder of the duke of Norfolk, Levett soon had a double furnace built there, the first known example in the metallurgy of iron. How can the exceptional quality of wealden guns be accounted for? Like their bronze counterparts, they were cast vertically, breech downwards, in pits. But since vertical casting of iron guns was also practised on the continent, other factors, such as the phosphoric nature of some wealden ores and the use of loam rather than sand for the moulds, have been adduced.<br>
<br>The unlikely story that Levett was a recusant, that he was deprived of his benefices in 1545, and that he was not restored to Buxted until after the accession of Mary I, was based on the particular meaning which the word began to acquire only following the Elizabethan church settlement of 1563. In this instance a collector &#145;certified Levett recusant&#146;, possibly for the &#145;refusal&#146; of a clerical subsidy, but the rector of the neighbouring parish of Rotherfield, Richard Collier, used this and Levett's frequent absence from home to induce the Canterbury authorities to declare the rectory vacant on 31 May 1545, and to install Collier in Levett's stead. This came exactly at a time when Levett was preparing his first major delivery of guns for the ordnance, and this expansion from being a simple supplier of wrought iron, iron artefacts, and cast-iron shot, into becoming England's first major manufacturer of cast-iron cannon, would have caused him the most severe financial pressure. The king's council at once made interventions on 3, 24, and 30 June, ordering Collier to desist and reprimanding the collector. Levett did indeed ultimately relinquish his distant rectory at Stamford Ryvers in Essex and some other preferments, but his continuing acceptability to the ecclesiastical authorities was shown in September when he was admitted to the rectory of Herstmonceux, which lay nearer to his home. Levett's deprivation from Buxted probably lasted no more than a few weeks.<br>
<br>Levett continued as &#145;one of the Mynisters of the Kinges Majestyes ordynaunce&#146; during Edward VI's reign, though the penury of the crown meant that the demand for guns declined. He died, unmarried, at some point between March and July 1554. His will provided for more than forty bequests, including &pound;6 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. to the poor of Buxted and 6 tons of cast iron to Levett's servant Ralph Hogge (<i>d</i>. 1585), who in 1559 succeeded him as royal gunstone founder.<br>
