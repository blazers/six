<span class="headword">Ashwood,  Bartholomew</span>  (1622&#150;1678), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was born in 1622 and baptized on 23 June of that year at Bickleigh, near Tiverton, Devon, the son of Bartholomew Ashwood (<i>d</i>. 1650&times;60), originally from Warwickshire, who for forty years was rector of Bickleigh. He matriculated from St Alban Hall, Oxford, on 22 March 1639 but soon transferred to Exeter College, where, according to Anthony Wood, he was put under a puritan tutor and took his BA on 23 December 1642. Threatened with sequestration in 1650, his father resigned his living to Ashwood. In October 1656, on the presentation of the godly Sir John Drake, Ashwood moved to the vicarage of Axminster, Devon. He had married in or before the following year when his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/791/', "John Ashwood (1657&#150;1706)")</script> was born. In 1660, Ashwood, now an Independent, gathered a congregation at Axminster. With twelve brethren he signed a covenant, promising &#145;to keep at a distance from the corruptions of the times, both as to worship and conversation: that they would be &hellip; a people dwelling alone&#146;  (Howard, 15). Ejected from his vicarage at the Restoration, he continued to minister to his congregation. For this he was arrested in August 1662 and, on his refusal to take the oaths of allegiance and supremacy, imprisoned at Exeter. The authorities kept a watchful eye on Ashwood's activities. Bishop Seth Ward reported him still preaching at Axminster in 1665. In April 1672 Ashwood obtained a licence as an Independent preacher in his house at Axminster, and at Chard, Somerset.<br>
<br>Thomas Reynolds's popular <span class="italic">Account</span> of John Ashwood (1707) celebrated Bartholomew Ashwood as a godly minister and exemplary parent, whose preaching helped to effect the conversion of his despairing son. Reynolds also related how both Bartholomew and his father, while worrying about their children, were comforted &#145;by an audible voice&#146;, which &#145;strangely impressed upon [them]&#146;  (Reynolds, 54&#150;5) those words (from <span class="roman">Genesis</span> 17: 7), &#145;I will be a God to thee and to thy seed after thee&#146;. While Reynolds denied that this smacked of enthusiasm, Samuel Palmer, the late eighteenth-century biographer of nonconformists, was less certain.<br>
<br>All three of Bartholomew Ashwood's publications were posthumous. His <span class="italic">Heavenly Trade</span> (1679, 1688), dedicated to the Bristol merchant Jeremy Holwey, sought to &#145;revive dying godliness&#146; by urging that &#145;Religion hath its work as well as the world; every trade hath its employment, and so has godliness &hellip; faith without works &hellip; will signifie nothing towards salvation&#146;  (title-page, p. 192). Such a lively faith promised more immediate rewards: [It] &#145;will make you thrive in your own work, if you are faithful and diligent in God's work, he will care for yours &hellip; Twas piety made Joseph so prosperous&#146;  (pp. 207&#150;8). <span class="italic">The Best Treasure</span> (1681) included a preface by John Owen which applauded the author for upholding the mystery of free grace against those who exalted human wisdom. Returning to <span class="roman">Genesis</span> 17: 7, Ashwood insisted that the best inheritance the godly could leave their children was an interest in the covenant. Yet parents must not &#145;daub and flatter [their children] with false promises&#146;, but convince them of their &#145;undone condition without Christ&#146;  (p. 435). Though he directed the treatise particularly to godly families, Ashwood did not ignore those outside the covenant, but issued a fervent call for lay evangelization: &#145;Do all you can to further the match between the Lord Jesus and sinners: Be advising your neighbours to forsake their evil ways &hellip; and stirring up your Christless friends &hellip; you should &hellip; commend [Christ] to all the world&#146;  (p. 433). His <span class="italic">Groans for Sion</span> (1681), advertised by the bookseller, William Marshal, is no longer extant. Ashwood died while visiting members of his flock in Chard on 27 October 1678, and was buried on 6 November at Axminster. Robert Bartlet, the ejected rector of Over Compton, Dorset, also an Independent, preached (but did not print) his funeral sermon. Ashwood was survived by his widow, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1710), who was possibly not his first wife, and his son John, who served as his executor. At the time of his death, he possessed goods valued at &pound;41, though little remained after his debts had been paid.<br>
