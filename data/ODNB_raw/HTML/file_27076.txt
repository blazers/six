<span class="headword">Taylor,  Robert</span>  (1710&#150;1762), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born in Newark, Nottinghamshire, in April 1710, the son of John Taylor, twice mayor of the town. He was educated at Newark grammar school before going on to St John's College, Cambridge, where he was admitted on 23 June 1727. However, on 27 October 1727 he moved to Trinity College. It was there that he became a scholar in 1729, and there that he took the degree of bachelor of medicine in 1732, followed by that of doctor of medicine on 7 July 1737.<br>
<br>Immediately after taking his first degree Taylor entered medical practice in Newark, where he filled the vacancy that had been left unoccupied since the death of Mordecai Hunton in 1723. He quickly won the esteem of his fellow townsfolk, for his polished manners, professional assiduity, and general erudition. It was while practising at Newark that the event occurred which laid the foundation for his professional success in London. Richard Boyle, third earl of Burlington, was on a visit to Belvoir Castle, some 25 miles from Newark, when he was taken dangerously ill. Taylor was summoned and managed to save his patient, despite the gravest apprehensions, by the bold administration of opium. Thereafter, Lord and Lady Burlington persuaded Taylor to move to London, where, owing especially to the efforts of Lady Burlington, he quickly built a large practice and obtained the patronage of Edward Hulse, physician to the king&#151;the position which Taylor was in time to hold himself.<br>
<br>Taylor became a fellow of the Royal Society on 23 June 1737. He was admitted a candidate of the Royal College of Physicians on 4 April 1738, being elected a fellow on 20 March 1739. The following year he gave the Goulstonian lecture and in 1755 the Harveian oration, making clear the college's then favourable views on the recently introduced practice of inoculation. A collection of his writings was published as <span class="italic">Miscellanea medica</span> in 1761.<br>
<br>Taylor was married twice: first to Anne (<i>d</i>. 1757), the youngest daughter of John Heron, and then, on 9 November 1759, to Elizabeth Mainwaring of Lincoln, who had a fortune of &pound;10,000 and who died on 10 May 1812, aged eighty-six. With Elizabeth he had a son, Robert, who died an infant, and a daughter, Elizabeth, who survived both parents and in 1781 married Charles Chaplin (1759&#150;1816) of Blankney Hall, Lincolnshire, who was later MP for that county.<br>
<br>Taylor died on 15 May 1762 and his body was interred in South Audley Street Chapel, London. However, in 1778 it was moved to Winthorpe, near Newark, where his widow had constructed a small private vault and where she and their infant son were also laid to rest. A monument to their memory was erected by their daughter.<br>
