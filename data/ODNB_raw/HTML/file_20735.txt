<span class="headword">Oliver,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1658, <em>d.</em> 1716), <span class="occ">physician</span>, born at Launceston, Cornwall, was the son of William Oliver (1627&#150;1681), rector of Launceston, and his wife, Alice Middleton; he was baptized on 31 July 1658. He was entered in the physic line at Leiden University on 17 December 1683 when aged twenty-five, but his medical studies were interrupted by his joining the duke of Monmouth's expedition to England, and serving with the troops as one of their three surgeons. Some years later Oliver told Oldmixon that after Monmouth's defeat he rode off the field with the duke, Lord Grey, and a few others. When they had ridden about 20 miles he proposed to the duke to turn off to the sea coast of Somerset, seize a passage boat at Uphill, and cross to Wales. The advice was not taken and Oliver rode away to Bristol, about 12 miles distant. There he concealed himself with friends, and after the &#145;bloody assizes&#146; travelled to London with the clerk of Judge Jeffreys, to whom he had been recommended as a tory. He then escaped to the continent and made his way to the Netherlands. In 1685 he was at K&ouml;nigsberg in Prussia, and he spent one winter in the most northern part of Poland, but his name appears again in the list of the students at Leiden on 17 February 1688. He accompanied William III to England in 1688 as an officer in his army, and was soon rewarded for his services.<br>
<br>On 30 September 1692 Oliver qualified as a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians at London, and from 27 April 1693 to 1702 he held the post of physician to the Red squadron. He served with the fleet at Cadiz in 1694, and spent two summers in the Mediterranean, during which period he eagerly pursued his inquiries in medicine and natural philosophy. Extracts from two letters written by Oliver when with the fleet were communicated by Walter Moyle to the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> (17.908&#150;12), and a third letter, written at the same period, was published in the same <span class="italic">Transactions</span> (24.1562&#150;4). A letter &#145;on his late journey into Denmark and Holland&#146;, about 1701, also appeared in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> (23.1400&#150;10).<br>
<br>Oliver was elected FRS on 5 January 1704. From 1702 to 1709 he lived in London and Bath, his <span class="italic">Practical Essay</span> being dated from &#145;Red Lion Court in Fleet Street, July 10, 1704&#146;, but it is doubtful whether he ever practised at Bath. From 1709 to 1714 he was physician to the hospital at Chatham for sick and wounded seamen, and from 1714 to 1716 he was physician to the Royal Hospital at Greenwich. He died unmarried at Greenwich on 4 April 1716, and was buried there. A monument was erected to his memory in the abbey church at Bath.<br>
<br>Oliver published in 1704 <span class="italic">A practical essay on fevers, containing remarks on the hot and cold methods of their cure</span>, at page 202 of which began &#145;a dissertation on the hot waters of Bathe&#146;, the first draft of his subsequent work. The essay, through its author's references to Dr John Radcliffe, was attacked in <span class="italic">A letter to Dr. Oliver, desiring him to reconcile some few of the contradictory assertions in his Essay on Feavers</span>, dated from Tunbridge Wells, 25 July 1704. The treatise on Bath was expanded into <span class="italic">A practical dissertation on Bath waters; to which is added a relation of a very extraordinary sleeper near Bath</span> (1707, 1719; 5th edn, 1764). This account of the sleeper, Samuel Chilton, a 25-year-old labourer at Timsbury, is also in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> (24.2177&#150;82), and was issued separately in 1707 and 1719. A further communication by Oliver is in the same <span class="italic">Transactions</span> (24.1596). Oliver's discourse, &#145;Christian and politike reasons&#146; why England and Holland should not go to war with each other, with other manuscripts, is in the British Library  (Sloane MS 1770), as is a letter from him to James Petiver  (Sloane MS 4054).<br>
