<span class="headword">Ashington group</span> <span class="st"> [pitmen painters]</span>  (<em>act. </em>1934&#150;1983) <span class="occ"></span>originated in October 1934 when men, mainly coalminers, from Ashington, Northumberland, began classes in art appreciation. It was a course without precedent in a mining village 16 miles, and a world away, from the nearest art gallery. The class, organized by the Workers' Education Association (WEA), first met on 29 October 1934 and was initially attended by thirteen students, rising to twenty-four in the following week. The lecturer assigned to the course was <a name="cosubject_98373"></a><span class="headword">Robert Lyon</span>  (1894&#150;1978)<span class="occ"></span>, then master of painting at Armstrong College, Newcastle upon Tyne. Lyon had been born on 18 August 1894 in Warrington, Lancashire, the son of Charles Lyon (<i>b</i>. 1864/5), a journalist and writer originally from Scotland, and his wife, Grace, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wood (<i>b</i>. 1869), from Scarborough. After war service with the King's Liverpool regiment, Lyon studied at Liverpool School of Art and the Royal College of Art, London, where he received the prix de Rome (painting) in 1924. On his return from Italy he had taken a teaching post at Hornsey College of Art and moved to Armstrong College in 1932.<br>
<br>At first Lyon sought to educate the Ashington class in the aims and achievements of the old masters, using lantern slides. But disconcerted by his students' lack of even the most rudimentary knowledge, he soon decided that art history was lost on them and that practicality was the only option. As Lyon put it, his method became &#145;Seeing by doing&#146;  (<span class="italic">Catalogue of an Exhibition of Paintings by Members of a Workers' Educational Association Art Appreciation Group, Ashington Northumberland</span>, YMCA hall, Ashington, December 1936, introduction).<br>
<br>Starting with linocuts and proceeding after a couple of weeks to painting in whatever materials they could acquire, the men rapidly caught on to the idea. Many of the group had studied together before (taking classes in, for example, geology and evolution) and were used to looking out for one another on shift, so they were free and easy in company. The subjects that Lyon initially set them (&#145;Rest&#146;, &#145;Dawn&#146;, &#145;Deluge&#146;) were given as homework and brought to the class for mutual criticism. Members of the group regarded their paintings as exercises to be checked over for accurate self-expression. In the words of one of the group's founding members, <a name="cosubject_98374"></a><span class="headword">Oliver Percival Kilbourn</span>  (1904&#150;1993)<span class="occ"></span>, &#145;We became enthralled with this and carried on to paint all we felt about our lives&#146;  (Kilbourn archive). Kilbourn, who became the group's best-known artist, was born on 6 October 1904 at 75 Chestnut Street, Ashington, the fifth child of James Smith Kilbourn (<i>b</i>. 1867/8), coalminer, and his wife, Mary Hannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Chilton (<i>b</i>. 1868/9). He was educated at the local elementary school and began work as a miner at the Duke pit, Ashington, three days after his thirteenth birthday. With the closure of the Duke pit, Kilbourn moved to the nearby Ellington colliery, where he became a coalface drawer aged twenty-four. He remained at Ellington for the rest of his working life, becoming a salvage drawer during the Second World War and a wasteman, responsible for the maintenance of the mine's airways, three years before his retirement in 1968. On 20 November 1952 he married Margaret Isabel 
    (Peggy; 1914&#150;2006)
  , daughter of John Edward Parker, who worked as the librarian at Ashington public library. Kilbourn had attended tutorial classes organized by the Ashington Miners' Union and then the WEA since the mid-1920s, and it was through this route that he enrolled on Robert Lyon's art appreciation course in October 1934.<br>
<br>Under Lyon's guidance the Ashington group concentrated on the familiar&#151;&#145;the things we knew about&#146; as Kilbourn put it. That these subjects were extraordinary to those living beyond the coalfields soon became apparent, not least to Lyon. Keen to air what he termed &#145;an experiment in art appreciation&#146;, he arranged two exhibitions of the group's work in November and December 1936&#151;first at the Hatton Gallery, Armstrong College, and then at the YMCA, Ashington&#151;and also introduced the group to Helen Sutherland, a wealthy patron and collector who lived at Rock Hall, near Alnwick. Writing later she recalled how she was moved by &#145;the vital freedom which the solidarity of the Group induces in its members and the rich diversity of accumulated experience commonly shared&#146;  (H. Sutherland, introduction, exhibition catalogue, Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle, June 1941). She in turn introduced members to some of the artists in her circle, notably David Jones and Ben Nicholson. In February 1936 she paid for a weekend trip to London to see exhibitions at the Royal Academy, National Gallery, and Tate Gallery, as well as to visit the Larkhall housing estate, Lambeth, and the studio of Alfred Hardiman where they viewed the sculptor's statue of Earl Haig, destined for Whitehall in the following year. According to another prominent member, <a name="cosubject_98375"></a><span class="headword">Harry Wilson</span>  (1898&#150;1972)<span class="occ"></span>, the London visit had a significant effect on the group's development:<blockquote>we began to feel like a unit, a group of people that had somewhere to go, something to do &hellip; it became almost a duty then to find something to do to justify the interest that had been taken in us. (Feaver, <span class="italic">Pitmen Painters</span>, 43)</blockquote>As a result of being gassed during the First World War Wilson worked not as a miner but as a dental mechanic and insurance salesman. He had moved to Ashington in 1926 and made friends through attending meetings of the WEA, of which he became secretary in the following year. Wilson's painting <span class="italic">East Wind</span> (1935; reproduced in two early magazine articles on the Ashington artists, by Lyon in <span class="italic">The Listener</span>, May 1935, and <span class="italic">Mine</span>, February 1936) quickly became an example of the group's interest in representing scenes from daily life. Lyon's <span class="italic">Listener</span> article also reproduced <span class="italic">The Miner</span> (1935) by (James) Leslie Brownrigg (1905&#150;1976). Brownrigg, the son of James Robinson Brownrigg (<i>b</i>. 1872), police constable, and Sarah Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mather, had been born on 20 December 1905 at the police station, Alnwick; like Oliver Kilbourn he worked as a miner but later became an elementary school teacher. Along with Lyon, between 1936 and 1938 the Ashington artists also contributed essays on art appreciation for the <span class="italic">Ashington Collieries Magazine</span>: Brownrigg wrote on Leonardo da Vinci, Kilbourn considered modern art, while Wilson wrote on sculpture.<br>
<br>Hailed as pioneer working-class artists, and with a growing following among southern radicals, the Ashington group faced the prospect of being both patronized and exploited. Tom Harrisson, the head of Mass-Observation, learned of the group from a 1938 <span class="italic">Listener</span> article. Harrisson and the artist Julian Trevelyan (who had Northumberland gentry connections) made contact and in October 1938 held a conference at Bensham Grove Settlement, Gateshead, on &#145;Vision and social realism&#146;, which featured a debate with members of the group, whose &#145;unprofessional painting&#146; was shown alongside works by self-taught and &#145;outsider&#146; artists. Harrisson's hopes for publicity (Tom Driberg, &#145;William Hickey&#146; of the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, attended the conference) were dashed by the onset of the Munich crisis in the same week. Following the Bensham Grove conference the group's work was exhibited at several venues in London, and, in November, Lyon and Wilson travelled to Alexandra Palace to appear on the BBC television programme <span class="italic">Picture Post</span> with Leslie Mitchell. But there was no further involvement with Mass-Observation, from which the Ashington artists, weary of Harrisson's zeal for endless particulars, readily dissociated. Their ambitions were keyed to art, not anthropology, as members had made clear in their contributions to the <span class="italic">Ashington Collieries Magazine</span>. &#145;It is the artist's emotional reaction towards the scenes that holds you and not the mere representation itself&#146;, wrote the elementary school teacher George Rowe  (Dec 1936, 337). In the words of Andy Foreman, another elementary teacher: &#145;it has been the aim of our experimental group to study art from within&#146;  (June 1937, 153). Some years later Kilbourn wrote:<blockquote>Below ground all the more rubbishy emotions are purged and instead strong comradeship prevails. I never paint dramatic accidents, although I have been in them, because I don't want to force people's emotions, I would like them to feel it in a more subtle way. (Kilbourn archive)</blockquote>Aware of the virtues of limitation, the value of eyewitness, and the advantage of their circumstances, Kilbourn and the other Ashington artists took a pride in their independence. Until the mid-1960s the group numbered about fifteen. Of these half a dozen were exceptionally dedicated, notably Wilson, whose work emphasized the deprivation of daily life (for example, <span class="italic">House Drain</span>, 1938, which depicts backstreet open sewers); the miner Jimmy Floyd (1898&#150;1974), whose artlessness was sustained with charm over forty years; and Kilbourn who, given the chance, would have gone to art school and become a professional artist:<blockquote>I'm not so sure now that I have missed out as I might have ended up painting like someone else if I had gone [to art school] and of course I would not have had the burning intensity to depict the mining life. (Kilbourn archive)</blockquote>The outbreak of war brought a spate of fresh subject matter. Despite extra shifts, and duties in the Home Guard and ARP, members still made time for painting. &#145;The war hasn't finished us&#146;, wrote Arthur Fletcher Whinnom (1899&#150;1962), a colliery cashier, in December 1939. &#145;We do our most intensive art-production in the winter months. Meaning blackout preparations and inconveniences and hours and hours of ARP and rotten travelling.&#146; The group's subject matter reflected the times (for example Harry Wilson's <span class="italic">Wartime Wedding</span>, 1940, and Whinnom's <span class="italic">Gas Mask for Baby</span>, 1941) but equally, as Whinnom commented, members resisted &#145;subordinating everything to the idea of War; we finally decided to gang oor ain gait as we had always done&#151;paint what we wanted&#151;and to explore a bit&#146;  (Arthur Whinnom MSS, Kilbourn archive). The group's second show at the Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle (June 1941), was followed in August 1942 by a selling exhibition at the Lefevre Galleries, London, after which Lyon arranged for the paintings to be shown at the National Gallery of Scotland.<br>
<br>No longer a WEA class, the group became self-sufficient when Robert Lyon moved to become principal of Edinburgh College of Art in the summer of 1942. Shortly before his move Lyon had completed a thesis on the &#145;Appreciation of art through the visual and practical approach&#146; and he continued to broadcast on his experience with the Ashington painters, writing to them in April 1945 of the Ministry of Information's intensive use of &#145;<i>The</i> Group &hellip; as part of their propaganda&#146;  (Feaver, <span class="italic">Pitmen Painters</span>, 130). In the following year a report on art in adult education by the Dartington Hall trustees identified Lyon as the &#145;teacher greatly responsible for the great success of the Ashington Group&#146; and his students as &#145;the most interesting&#146; of the societies then &#145;engaged in painting and handicrafts&#146;, a success attributed to its being &#145;a homogeneous group with long experience of working together&#146;  (ibid., 125&#150;6). At Edinburgh, where he remained until his retirement in 1960, Lyon established the degree course in fine art and, as a painter, undertook murals for Edinburgh's Western General Hospital, the school of dentistry at King's College, London, and Essex County Hall, Chelmsford.<br>
<br>Five years before Lyon's departure the group had bought a hut for &pound;10 and erected it at Long Horsley, about 12 miles from Ashington, for use on summer weekends. In 1943 they took possession of it again (the hut having been commandeered by the army) and transferred it to Ashington on land belonging to the Ashington Coal Company with an annual ground rent of 1<i>s</i>., later rising to 10<i>s</i>. This became the group's meeting place for the next forty years, with members gathering each week to paint, discuss their work, or attend an illustrated lecture, usually presented by Oliver Kilbourn: &#145;We really loved our Hut as it was a focus of so much happiness and friendship. This helped keep us together&#146;, he later wrote  (Kilbourn archive). The group's activities in this period included a second visit to London in January 1948, where they were invited to tour the British Museum. A <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span> photographer caught them advancing down the steps of the Tate Gallery: heroes of the era of &#145;We are the masters now&#146;. This confidence, built on a deep-seated sense of independence, was fostered by Lyon, who kept in regular contact and who supported the group's decision to distance itself from both national bodies, which sought to exploit their northern identity, and amateur art societies: &#145;Ashington does not need the stimulant of association with other groups&#151;or sketch clubs&#146;, he wrote to Arthur Whinnom in May 1953  (Feaver, <span class="italic">Pitmen Painters</span>, 132). The post-war period also saw changes in the group's membership, as founding members like Leslie Brownrigg became less active and were replaced by newcomers such as the craftsman joiner Len Robinson (1896&#150;1987) and the colliery joiner, Fred Robson Laidler (1918&#150;1988).<br>
<br>By the early 1970s the Ashington group comprised ten active members and, after a period of relative obscurity, their work and practice of &#145;seeing by doing&#146; now gained new publicity. Between January 1972 and April 1973 a selection of the group's permanent collection (numbering about 100 paintings stored in their hut) was exhibited at a series of British galleries, opening in Durham and concluding at London's Whitechapel Gallery. The paintings were later shown in Berlin (1977) and Rotterdam (1978), by which time, for safety, the collection had been transferred to a National Coal Board training centre in Newcastle. Oliver Kilbourn and his wife attended the exhibitions in Germany and the Netherlands and in the mid-seventies Kilbourn completed a series of thirty-eight paintings to tell the story of his working life; under the title <span class="roman">My Life as Pitman</span> the paintings were shown in Nottingham in 1978 and in London a year later.<br>
<br>In 1971 a film by Tristram Powell for the BBC told the story of the group through the recollections of Kilbourn, Wilson, Floyd, and Laidler, who discussed their work and revisited Rock Hall. Harry Wilson died on 20 February 1972, a month after the programme was broadcast, followed by Jimmy Floyd (1974), Leslie Brownrigg (December 1976), and the group's tutor, Robert Lyon, who died on 7 June 1978 at his home in Cavendish, Suffolk. Writing to the group from Edinburgh in 1945 Lyon had spoken of his seven years of classes at Ashington as &#145;<i>high-lights</i> in an otherwise not uninteresting life&#146;  (Feaver, <span class="italic">Pitmen Painters</span>, 130); he was survived by his wife, Mabel, and their son, Peter, who achieved note as a sculptor. Powell's film was also seen by staff at the Chinese embassy and this led, in 1980, to an exhibition of the group's work in China under the auspices of the British Council. The exhibition, one of the first from the West following the cessation of the cultural revolution, began in Beijing and went on to tour the country's mining provinces.<br>
<br>By 1982 the group's regular weekly attendance had dwindled to Kilbourn and another former miner, Jack Harrison (1904&#150;2004). A year later the artists' hut was demolished and in 1988 Ashington colliery was closed. At this time the group's permanent collection was placed by its trustees, Oliver Kilbourn and William Feaver, in the Woodhorn Colliery Museum and in 2006 the paintings were installed in a purpose-built gallery at the museum. In the following year the activities of the group formed the subject of Lee Hall's play <span class="italic">The Pitmen Painters</span>, inspired by Feaver's book of the same title. Kilbourn, the longest surviving of the group's founders, died in April 1993. A continuous presence in the history of the Ashington artists, he was well placed to assess its motivation and the reasons for its success:<blockquote>A key factor in our long life, I think, was the fact that we were never a commercial group but preserved our idealism. We thought we were doing something that no one else could do. We were depicting a way of life both below and above ground in a mining village that only we knew by experiencing it. Life goes on and we paint life &hellip; A funny thing, once you've painted a picture, you feel it's part of your life. (Kilbourn archive)</blockquote>
