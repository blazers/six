<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Downey,  Richard Joseph</span>  (1881&#150;1953), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic archbishop of Liverpool</span>, was born on 5 May 1881 in Kilkenny, the eldest of three children and only son of Thomas Downey, chemist, and his wife, Mary (Minnie) Casey. The family moved to Liverpool and he attended St Edward's College junior seminary in 1894. In 1901 he moved to the senior seminary, St Joseph's College, at Upholland, near Wigan, where he was ordained priest in 1907. Sent to Rome to pursue higher studies at Beda College and the Gregorian University, Downey gained a doctorate of divinity with distinction in 1911. In that year he was appointed a member of the Catholic Missionary Society, dedicated to the conversion of non-Catholics to the Roman Catholic faith. This involved him in preaching and lecturing throughout the British Isles. In 1918 he became co-founder and first editor of the <span class="italic">Catholic Gazette</span> (a successor to the <span class="italic">Missionary Gazette</span>) which began to cater for a more educated Catholic readership. During these years he also had part-time posts teaching philosophy and theology. In 1926 he returned to teach at Upholland, and became vice-rector there the following year.<br>
<br>In 1928 Downey was appointed archbishop of Liverpool, and was consecrated in the pro-cathedral on 21 September, a meteoric rise to ecclesiastical power. At forty-seven he was the youngest Roman Catholic archbishop in the world. With a Catholic population of 374,000 it was by far the most populous diocese in England and Wales. Downey was decisive in manner, unashamedly triumphalist, and would not compromise over Catholic principles. A good conversationalist with a ready wit, he was able to relax in an easy manner with his senior clergy (who referred to him as Dickie). Almost immediately he began to grapple with the thorny question of Catholic education. In his Advent pastoral letter of 1928 he argued that the funding of Catholic schools was not merely a political matter but was a question of justice for Catholics and that the church had to be vigorously involved in the debate. In October 1928 Downey coined the slogan &#145;The cathedral in our time&#146;. He subsequently engaged the prominent architect Sir Edwin Lutyens to design a cathedral that would be worthy of the city and diocese, and which would be second in size only to St Peter's in Rome. In order to finance this Downey established a Catholic Emancipation Fund, and put a lot of his energy into fund-raising.<br>
<br>With his Liverpool background Downey was familiar with the bitter sectarian divisions which bedevilled politics in the city&#151;and with which a Catholic archbishop had to contend. The powerful Working Men's Conservative Association was strongly Orange in composition. The local Labour Party had reached its inter-war peak with fifty-seven councillors facing seventy-nine Conservatives. However, one third of the Labour councillors were Roman Catholic and the party had strong support from the Roman Catholic working-class population. Even so, Downey had misgivings about the socialist tendencies of the Labour Party. He banned his clergy from electioneering and forbade the Catholic Representation Association (founded by his predecessor) from using the word &#145;Catholic&#146; in its title. (It subsequently became the Centre Party.) Downey forged a close personal friendship with Sir James Reynolds, a prominent Catholic businessman, high sheriff of Lancashire (1927&#150;8), and Conservative MP for Liverpool Exchange (1929&#150;32).<br>
<br>In 1930 the 9 acre site of Brownlow Hill workhouse came on the market as the city corporation of Liverpool took over responsibility for poor relief. Downey put in a bid of &pound;100,000 for it as a site for his projected cathedral. There was bitter Orange opposition: Councillor Longbottom said that he would prefer &#145;a poison germ factory&#146; there rather than a Catholic cathedral. Eventually the Catholic bid, the only one standing, was accepted by an overwhelming vote in the city council. The foundation stone was laid at Whitsuntide 1933 in the presence of a papal legate. Because of the war building had to cease in 1941, when only the massive crypt had been partially completed. After the war escalating costs made it impracticable to continue building on Lutyens's scale or design.<br>
<br>The Hadow report of 1926 (the consultative committee on the education of the adolescent) had recommended replacing the system of parallel secondary and all age elementary schools with a diversified education after the age of eleven according to age, ability, and aptitude of the child. It also recommended raising the school-leaving age to fifteen. The Catholic bishops welcomed these suggestions, but could not sustain the costs which this would entail. Archbishop Downey, both in articles and by addressing mass rallies in Liverpool and in many centres throughout the country, pressed the Catholic claim that they should be given financial support for this reorganization parallel to that given to local education authorities. In the run-up to the general election of 1930 Downey questioned fifty-nine parliamentary candidates in the Liverpool area as to whether they were willing to support the Catholic cause; thirty-eight agreed to do so. An education bill drawn up by the Labour government proved unacceptable to the Catholic bishops because it allowed local education authorities (LEAs) to appoint teachers in denominational schools except for a few reserved places. After five years of campaigning the Catholic bishops under Cardinal Hinsley agreed to accept the terms of the 1936 <span class="roman">Education Act</span> which allowed LEAs to give grants of up to 75 per cent of the cost of reorganizing denominational schools (although by now Church of England and free church authorities had agreed to use LEA schools with an agreed syllabus for religious education). The first school built under this act was a Catholic one in Southport, in the Liverpool archdiocese. Because of the sectarian opposition to &#145;Rome on the rates&#146; Liverpool city council refused to pay any grants to Catholic schools and Downey called upon Catholics to make it an issue at the forthcoming local election. The Catholics lost this fight, but in 1938 the Board of Education stepped in and withheld &pound;180,000 of Liverpool's grants. Eventually, by means of a private act, a solution was reached whereby the diocese rented schools from the LEA.<br>
<br>Archbishop Downey was not on friendly terms with the Church of England diocesan bishop of Liverpool, Dr Albert David (1923&#150;44). Their differences became public when David criticized Downey for refusing to join protestants even to sing hymns at the Cenotaph, and attacked the Roman Catholic clergy, and also the Catholic Evidence Guild for bringing relentless pressure to bear upon non-Catholic partners in mixed marriages. Downey rejected David's invitation to an ecumenical service: &#145;an Archbishop of the Catholic Church can hardly be expected to accept the spiritual leadership of an Anglican Bishop&#146;, he wrote  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 3 Dec 1930). At a later stage he was to lead the opposition among the Catholic bishops to Cardinal Hinsley's ecumenical prayers with Bishop George Bell at meetings of the &#145;Sword of the Spirit&#146; in May 1941. None the less his popularity as an after dinner speaker and his power as an orator at public functions built many bridges at the secular level.<br>
<br>Downey suffered from obesity and in 1932, although he was only 5 feet 4 inches, he weighed 18 stone. This did not restrict his activity but it alarmed his doctor. By rigid dieting he had reduced his weight by half by 1939. He was a capable administrator, increasing the number of deans from fourteen to twenty. Through them he kept in touch with every part of the diocese, whose population grew from 374,000 to 437,000. At the same time the number of clergy, both secular and regular, grew steadily from 445 in 1928 to 683 in 1953. Downey met the need for more clergy partly by recruiting newly ordained priests from Ireland. Some of these priests gained a reputation for fund-raising and the building of new churches and schools. Under the nickname of the Kerry gang they were believed to have considerable unofficial influence with the archbishop. Meanwhile, the number of churches had increased from 152 to 195.<br>
<br>After a brief illness Downey died in Gateacre Grange, a convent nursing home in Woolton, Liverpool, on 16 June 1953. His requiem mass took place at the pro-cathedral of St Nicholas and he was buried on 23 June in a tomb designed by Lutyens in the unfinished crypt of the cathedral of which he had dreamed.<br>
