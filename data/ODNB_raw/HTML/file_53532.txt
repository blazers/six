<span class="headword">Felkin,  William</span>  (1795&#150;1874), <span class="occ">manufacturer and historian of the lace and hosiery industries</span>, was born on 24 April 1795 in Ilkeston, Derbyshire, the son of William Felkin (1772&#150;1824), a framework knitter who became a Baptist minister, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Harrison. The family moved to Leicestershire, where Felkin was educated at Benjamin Wootton's school at Kegworth (1799&#150;1805) and at his father's school in the same place (1805&#150;7). At the age of twelve he was apprenticed to his grandfather, also a framework knitter, for a year and then to Heard and Hurst, a leading Nottingham firm of merchant hosiers, for seven years (1809&#150;16). In 1812/1813 the partners moved him to their London warehouse to widen his experience. Ten years later he made the critical move of his career, securing employment with John Heathcoat, the patentee of the bobbin-net lace machine (1808&#150;9), first at his London warehouse in Cheapside, then at his Tiverton factory. In 1822 he married Susannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Clarke. When Felkin returned to Nottingham in 1826 it was as agent for Heathcoat, who had become the colossus of the lace industry and trade.<br>
<br>Apart from representing Heathcoat's interests, from 1832 Felkin was also a commission agent, buying the production of scores of small local producers, bleaching and hand-embroidering the net, and marketing it in London and elsewhere. He also began to manufacture lace net, at first in partnership with fellow Baptist William Vickers, later with one of his sons in Beeston. In the mid-1850s, when hosiery began to shift to factory production, he invested in the new circular knitting machines. The business was supported for many years by Wrights' Bank, but became insolvent in 1865. Some old friends bought him an annuity, which enabled him to retire and devote his time to research and writing.<br>
<br>As Heathcoat's agent Felkin held a position of authority in the economic affairs of Nottingham and its region. Moreover, he had considerable personal qualities, acute intelligence, and an evangelical zeal in a town full of chapels, &#145;the manners of a Chesterfield and the oratory of a Bright&#146;  (<span class="italic">Nottingham Daily Express</span>, 26 Nov 1901). He was soon heavily involved in trade politics, and in giving evidence to a sequence of government inquiries. To protect the many small lace machine owners in and about the town, he took the lead in initiatives to restrict hours of work and output, and also to reinforce the statutory prohibition on the export of machinery from Britain (English producers were particularly anxious about French rivals). When these campaigns proved ineffective, Felkin turned to the promotion of the Mechanics' Institute (1836) and the Nottingham School of Design (1842), and to industrial exhibitions, beginning in 1840.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Felkin was focusing his energies too on the politics of municipal reform. His friend and fellow Baptist Absalom Barnett was the leading exponent of poor-law reform locally, advocating the labour test and the workhouse test for Nottingham's unemployed. Felkin became a poor-law guardian during the early operational years of the new poor law (1836&#150;9), but withdrew after a long and acrimonious conflict with the tory traditionalists. He then became a councillor on the newly reformed Nottingham corporation, joining the controlling group of like-minded nonconformist progressives. In 1845 Nottingham was authoritatively stated to be the most overcrowded town in England, so there was ample scope for municipal improvement. Felkin played a leading role in the promotion of the <span class="roman">Nottingham Enclosure Act</span> (1845) and the corporation sanitary committee (1847 onwards), which inaugurated the modern planning process in the town. The two strands of Felkin's public life, trade and municipal politics, converged in 1850 when he was elected mayor, an office he held for two consecutive terms. He was an energetic promoter of the Great Exhibition of 1851 and wrote a pamphlet, dedicated to Prince Albert, which eulogized the event as inaugurating a new age of peace and reconciliation of labour and capital. He was appointed chairman of jury no. 20 at the exhibition, which dealt with clothing, and was proud that Nottingham provided sixty exhibitors and won fourteen prize medals.<br>
<br>While Felkin was an eminent public figure in the midlands during his lifetime, his main claim to the attention of posterity is as a statistician and historian of the British lace and hosiery industries. He made a lifelong study of the subject and spent years of his retirement assembling this material for his <span class="italic">History of the Machine-Wrought Hosiery and Lace Manufactures</span> (1867). The best part of the book deals with the period in which he was actively involved in the industry and, as a contemporary account of this key period, can never be superseded. The work, however, has its limitations: its approach is technical, rather than commercial, financial, or design-oriented. Like much writing of the period, the approach is moralistic, expressing the virtues of working-class self-help and the dire consequences of prodigality, though recent scholarship confirms the existence of a strong upward social mobility in the lace industry&#151;one of Felkin's main themes. Inevitably there is some partiality: Nottingham is better covered than other hosiery centres (for example Leicester, Loughborough, or Hinckley), and Germany (where one of Felkin's sons worked) better than France or the USA. Similarly, the book is weak on rivals to Heathcoat's claims to have invented the bobbin-net machine, as well as on Deverill's justifiable claim to be considered the father of the fancy lace machine  (D. E. Varley, <span class="italic">History of the Midland Counties Lace Manufacturers Association</span>, 1959, 21&#150;8).<br>
<br>Felkin died at his home on the Nottingham Park estate, on 26 September 1874. He was survived by his wife and a large family, and was buried in Nottingham general cemetery on 5 October.<br>
