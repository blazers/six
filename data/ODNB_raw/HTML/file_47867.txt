<span class="headword">Trinder,  Arthur William</span>  (1901&#150;1959), <span class="occ">bond dealer</span>, was born on 11 August 1901 in Reading, the son of Arthur Trinder, sergeant-major, Royal Berkshire regiment, and his wife, Louisa Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Taylor. He was educated at Christ's Hospital from January 1912 until July 1918, having won a place there as a West's scholar in open competition. On leaving school he found employment as a clerk with the Union Discount Company of London Ltd, then the leading house in the discount market.<br>
<br>Trinder took his first step to high office in the 1920s when R. C. Wyse, manager from 1922 to 1940, appointed him as his &#145;boy&#146; or assistant to the manager. In 1930 he was made assistant manager and when in the following year he was promoted to sub-manager, a contemporary described him as &#145;the eyes, and ears and often the mouthpiece of the management&#146;  (private information). He was deputy manager under E. C. Ellen from 1940 and when Ellen retired in January 1947 Trinder was the natural choice to succeed him.<br>
<br>The sheer size of the Union Discount's operations meant that its managers tended to be the most prominent market experts of their day. This was certainly true of Trinder, who was the acknowledged leader of the discount market in the late 1940s and the 1950s. Between 1953 and 1955 he served as chairman of the London Discount Market Association. Trinder's forte was the bond market: he had an unmatched reputation as an astute and skilful dealer, and from the early days Union Discount had been the market's largest operator. Now it was to bonds rather than bills that the houses had to look for their chief hope of profit; and there was renewed encouragement from the Bank of England for the houses to develop their role, acquired during wartime, of making a market in short-dated government bonds.<br>
<br>Trinder's importance as a bond dealer led to his appearance, in December 1957, before the Parker tribunal, set up to investigate an alleged leakage of information regarding the raising of the bank rate. Trinder argued, in words that lived after him, that prior information would have been of no value, because the size of his bond-holding left no room for manoeuvre: &#145;I am the market in certain short bonds, so therefore I have to sit tight and do nothing&#146;  (<span class="italic">DBB</span>, 5.555). A few weeks later, in January 1958, he provided further valuable insights into discount market operations, when he gave evidence to the committee on the working of the monetary system (the Radcliffe committee).<br>
<br>&#145;Trin&#146;, as he was universally known, was a much loved figure in the discount market, which looked to him as a source of wisdom in all business matters. Trinder with his quick, dry wit would often oblige with an apposite and humorous aphorism known as a &#145;Trinderism&#146;. He attributed his own success in the bond market, for example, to the possession of &#145;a long pocket and strong nerves&#146;  (private information). His business style was a successful combination of flamboyance and shrewd calculation. It was not, however, beyond criticism. He had learned management from the autocratic and dictatorial Wyse and he kept too much in his own hands and failed to bring on his management team. His last years were marred by losses in bond dealing, owing to his failure to heed advice; moreover, because Union Discount had a non-executive board he was never made a director of the company.<br>
<br>Little is known about Trinder's private life, including the name of his wife; but they had a daughter and two sons, both of whom followed him into the City. Trinder apparently lived for his work and he was, he always said, &#145;wedded to Union Discount&#146;  (private information). His company's fortunes were at a peak when he retired in 1958, but retirement left him bereft of purpose. Less than eleven months later, he died from gastric haemorrhage and hepatitis at the London Clinic, 20 Devonshire Place, Marylebone, London, on 28 July 1959.<br>
