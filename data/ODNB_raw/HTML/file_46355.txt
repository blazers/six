<span class="headword">Macartney,  Carlile Aylmer</span>  (1895&#150;1978), <span class="occ">historian of central Europe</span>, was born on 24 January 1895 at Newlands, Crockham Hill, Westerham, Kent, the youngest of five children of Carlile Henry Hayes Macartney (1842&#150;1924), barrister, landscape artist, and horologist, and his wife, Louisa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gardiner. The family, whose most renowned member was George, Earl Macartney, was of Scottish origin but long resident in Ulster. Aylmer's infancy and much of his boyhood were spent at Foxhold, a small house at Crockham near Newbury, Berkshire. In 1909 he went to Winchester College as a Pitt exhibitioner and scholar. He was elected to a scholarship at Trinity College, Cambridge; but, as he matriculated in October 1914, his classical studies were cut short by the war, in which he fought in France and was wounded in the leg. His only brother, Maxwell, fifteen years his senior, was already widely respected as a reporter for <span class="italic">The Times</span>, specializing in central Europe and the Balkans. Aylmer began to share many of his interests, travelling to Vienna, where he was acting vice-consul from 1922 to 1925. While there he married Nedella (1899&#150;1989), daughter of Colonel Dmitry Mamarchev, of the Bulgarian army.<br>
<br>In his first book, <span class="italic">The Social Revolution in Austria</span> (1926), Macartney drew on his experiences of the new, post-Habsburg republic, emphasizing the disparities between living conditions in the huge capital city and the rural or mountainous provinces around it. But his attention soon shifted to Hungary, the inter-war &#145;kingdom without a king&#146;, whose problems, historical and contemporary, were to fascinate him throughout his academic life. He became fluent in Magyar, visited every region in the country, and established personal contacts with scholars and with some leading Calvinist landowning families. In 1930 he published a study entitled <span class="italic">The Magyars in the Ninth Century</span>, subsequently analysing the earliest Hungarian chronicles in a series of critical articles published in Budapest over several years. This scholarly achievement he made available for Western students in <span class="italic">The Medieval Hungarian Historians</span> (1953). Meanwhile he worked in the international department of the League of Nations Union from 1928 to 1936 and was recognized by the Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House) as the leading authority on the problems of the Danube basin, and the relationship between &#145;national states and national minorities&#146;, a title he chose for a judicious study published in 1934. This problem was also at the heart of his <span class="italic">Hungary and her Successors</span> (1938), a survey of the political and economic consequences of the treaty of Trianon of 1920, by which two-thirds of pre-war &#145;historic Hungary&#146; was ceded to neighbouring states.<br>
<br>In 1936 Macartney was elected a research fellow of All Souls College, Oxford. When war came in 1939 he was attached to the research department of the Foreign Office. Hungary remained neutral until June 1941, and early in 1940 Macartney travelled to Budapest for talks with the prime minister, Count Pal Teleki, and others who hoped to curb the mounting Nazi influence in their country. Subsequently Macartney began broadcasting regularly in Magyar for the BBC's World Service. Although firmly anti-German in content, the broadcasts showed a tolerant understanding of the existing order in Hungary which, by 1942, angered more radical colleagues. The Foreign Office backed Macartney, realizing that his combination of restrained comment and gently ironic reproach offered his listeners an impartiality lacking in their own media and German propaganda. &#145;Macartney acquired a reputation in Hungary which survived the vicissitudes of the war&#146;, the official history of British broadcasting observes  (A. Briggs, <span class="italic">History of Broadcasting in the United Kingdom</span>, 3.428).<br>
<br>Until 1949, when the republic adopted a Soviet-style constitution, Macartney maintained links with scholars under the new regime as a foreign member of the Hungarian Academy. He interviewed detainees in occupied Germany (including the former regent, Horthy) and survivors of the war years in Budapest, from whom he received several unpublished memoirs and other documents. This varied material, supplemented by information from &eacute;migr&eacute;s, encouraged him to write a two-volume history of Hungary between 1929 and 1945, which he entitled <span class="italic">October Fifteenth</span> to recall that confused Sunday in 1944 when Horthy vainly sought a separate peace with the allies. The critical assessment of his sources took Macartney almost nine years but in 1956 <span class="italic">October Fifteenth</span> was at last published by the University of Edinburgh, where from 1951 to 1957 he held the chair of international relations.<br>
<br>In November 1956 Macartney was on the Austrian frontier during the flight of refugees after the failure of the uprising in Budapest against Soviet occupation. He continued to help Hungarian exiles in London, but in his academic work he abandoned recent history to study the Habsburg lands as a whole, from Leopold II's accession to the end of dynastic rule, and concentrating on domestic affairs. His <span class="italic">The Habsburg Empire, 1790&#150;1918</span> (1968) was an undertaking affectionately contemplated for forty years; it grew into a book of half a million words, not easy reading, but a quarry of detailed scholarship into which no dedicated student of the region could fail to hack. Other works, smaller in compass, included: <span class="italic">Independent Eastern Europe: a History</span> (1962), in collaboration with A. W. Palmer; a single-volume history of Hungary (1962); and a brief life of Maria Theresa (1969).<br>
<br>Macartney was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1965, the year he retired from All Souls. In <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> he listed &#145;travel&#146; as his recreation: he was able to visit the USA and was welcomed once more in Hungary and Bulgaria. He retained the thin, ascetic figure of a good walker. Perhaps his greatest pleasure in later years came from cultivating the irises at Hornbeams, his home on Boars Hill, south of Oxford. There, in early June each summer, with flag flowers in full colour, the Macartneys would welcome friends to a garden party. On 18 June 1978, a few days after the last of these celebrations, Aylmer Macartney collapsed and died at Hornbeams. A funeral service in the chapel of All Souls College, Oxford, on 23 June was followed by private cremation at Oxford crematorium.<br>
