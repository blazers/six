<span class="headword">Copeland,  Thomas</span>  (1781&#150;1855), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, son of William Copeland (1747&#150;1787), curate of Byfield, Northamptonshire, was born in May 1781. He studied under Mr Denham at Chigwell in Essex, and in London under <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9856/', "Edward Ford")</script>, his maternal uncle, before attending medical classes in Great Windmill Street and at St Bartholomew's Hospital. On 6 July 1804 he was admitted a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and on the 14th of the same month was appointed an assistant surgeon in the 1st foot guards. He embarked with his regiment for Spain under Sir John Moore, and was present at the battle of Corunna in 1809.<br>
<br>On his return to England and retirement from the army, Copeland succeeded to his uncle's practice following the latter's death in September that year. Copeland also inherited his residence, 4 Golden Square, London, and having been appointed surgeon to the Westminster General Dispensary he soon made some influential connections, chiefly among the aristocracy. In 1810 he brought out <span class="italic">Observations on the disease of the hip-joint, by E. Ford; edited and revised with additions, by T. Copeland</span>. In the same year he published <span class="italic">Observations on some of the Principal Diseases of the Rectum</span>, a work which ran to three editions. His new and scientific treatment of these diseases established his reputation and justly earned him the distinction of being the founder of rectum surgery; as a consulting surgeon his opinion was in great demand in the West End of London. Copeland was the first to suggest the removal of the septum narium by means of an ingeniously contrived pair of forceps, in cases where its oblique position obstructed the passage of air through the nostrils.<br>
<br>Copeland was elected FRS on 6 February 1834, and in 1843 he became honorary FRCS. For a time he was a member of the council of the Royal College of Surgeons, and he became surgeon-extraordinary to Queen Victoria in 1837. He moved to 17 Cavendish Square, London, in 1842, but his failing health caused him to reduce his practice. Copeland was also the author of <span class="italic">Observations on the symptoms and treatment of the diseased spine, more particularly relating to the incipient stages</span>, published in 1815; a second edition appeared in 1818 and the work was translated into several European languages. Among his contributions to professional journals was a paper entitled &#145;History of a case in which a calculus was voided from a tumour in the groin&#146;  (<span class="italic">Transactions of the Medico-Chirurgical Society</span>, 3.191). Copeland's career was marked by a keen observance of professional etiquette, and by courtesy and friendship towards his fellow practitioners. Copeland died from an attack of jaundice at Brighton on 19 November 1855. His wife died on 5 December 1855. He left &pound;180,000, bequeathing &pound;5000 both to the Asylum for Poor Orphans of the Clergy and to the Society for the Relief of Widows and Orphans of Medical Men.<br>
