<span class="headword">Reeve,  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1666), <span class="occ">maker of optical instruments</span>, was of obscure origin, but in the records of a London court case of 1664 he was described as a gentleman (rather than an artisan or a freeman of a City guild company) with landed relatives in Burghfield, Berkshire. His skill in the polite art of turning on the lathe and a facility for working optical glass led to him playing a central role in a concerted programme to improve the image quality in refracting telescopes and microscopes.<br>
<br>The first mention of Reeve's optical work is in 1639, in a letter from a correspondent of Samuel Hartlib. Between 1641 and 1643 Reeve was associated with the circle of Charles Cavendish, working with the mathematician John Pell in the ambitious (and ultimately fruitless) task of grinding lenses with the idealized hyperbolic sections recommended by Ren&eacute; Descartes. The reported achievements of the German optician Johann Wiesel prompted further work, notably under the patronage of the courtier Sir Paul Neile. Reeve constructed telescopes of increasing focal length and magnification for Neile, including several for the observatory established in 1650 by Seth Ward at Wadham College, Oxford. This was the focus for a group of royalist astronomers and natural philosophers during the interregnum, centred on Ward, Dr John Wilkins, Robert Boyle, and his assistant and prot&eacute;g&eacute; Robert Hooke, and including Neile's son William and the young Christopher Wren. By 1652 Reeve was well established as a telescope maker in London and was described by the diarist John Evelyn as &#145;that admirable Artiste Reeves famous for Perspectives, &amp; turning curiosities in Ivorie&#146;  (Evelyn, 64). In the same year Reeve developed an improved form of compound microscope which was marketed commercially. Reeve microscopes were used by Wren for his pioneering illustrations of microscopic objects, some of which were presented to Charles II in 1661. Hooke was closely involved with this project which came to published fruition as his <span class="italic">Micrographia</span> of 1664 and formed a valuable advertisement for Reeve's instruments.<br>
<br>By 1656 Reeve had produced the first of a series of successful 36 feet long telescopes, for Neile's house at White Waltham, Berkshire. There it was used by Wren for his important work on the structure of Saturn's rings before being transferred to Gresham College, London, for Wren's use after his appointment as Gresham professor of astronomy in 1657. The telescope attracted the interest of Charles II, to whom it was demonstrated in 1660, and for a time it was relocated at Whitehall Palace before being remounted in 1664 by Hooke at Gresham, where he became professor of geometry. A further Reeve telescope of this size was presented by Charles as a diplomatic gift to his brother-in-law Philippe, duke of Orl&eacute;ans, brother of Louis XIV. With the encouragement of Hooke, Reeve developed telescopes of 60 feet in length during the period 1662&#150;5, and one was purchased by Boyle for Hooke's use at Gresham. More typical of Reeve's fashionable trade was the construction of smaller terrestrial telescopes such as the 4 foot instrument purchased by William, first duke of Bedford, in 1661, probably in anticipation of the transit of Mercury that year. A list of Reeve's prices for instruments is included in correspondence of 1660 with the microscopist Henry Power in the British Library.<br>
<br>Reeve's first marriage is tentatively identified with that recorded at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 5 October 1624 between Richard Reeve and Margeria Alexander. The baptisms of two children are known: in 1626 or 1627 that of a daughter, Elizabeth, and in 1630 that of a son, Richard, who equates with the Richard who succeeded Reeve in business at his death. Reeve subsequently married Alice Groves in St Paul's, Covent Garden, in 1659. She died from accidental domestic injuries received in 1664 and Reeve was indicted for manslaughter. He was able to secure a royal pardon in 1665 but at considerable expense.<br>
<br>Reeve may be identified with the Richard Reeve who died in January 1666 in Hampstead, and was buried at St Paul's, Covent Garden, leaving the remaining lease of his house in Henrietta Street, Covent Garden, to his then wife, Dorothy, in a will contested by his cousin. The lease was originally taken out by Reeve in 1633 and Dorothy Reeve is recorded as the occupant for 1667 and 1668. The Reeve business was at the west end of Longacre, trading at the Blue Blanket 1656&#150;73 (and perhaps earlier at Cross Lane, Longacre, 1643&#150;51). The younger Reeve, who was recorded in Samuel Pepys's diary, was not as successful as his father and soon lost the approbation of Hooke and the Royal Society. They came to favour Christopher Cock, an optical instrument maker who may earlier have worked under the elder Reeve and is associated with a commission undertaken by Reeve for the mathematician James Gregory in 1663. In 1675 a Richard Reeve, gentleman, who may be identical with the younger Reeve, obtained a patent for a type of reflector lamp for street lighting, but his later circumstances are unknown.<br>
