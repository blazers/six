<span class="headword">Meinertzhagen,  Daniel (V)</span>  (1801&#150;1869), <span class="occ">merchant and merchant banker</span>, was born at Bremen, Germany, on 8 December 1801, the eldest of at least four sons and four daughters of Daniel (IV) Meinertzhagen (1772&#150;1859) and his wife, Meta Rebecca, daughter of George von Groning, who married in December 1800. The name of Daniel was traditionally given to the eldest son, one being differentiated from another by the addition of a roman numeral. Thus Meinertzhagen was known as Daniel (V).<br>
<br>The Meinertzhagens were a leading, if not prosperous, Bremen family. Daniel (I), a merchant, originally from Cologne, had settled there at the end of the seventeenth century and had become a senator in Bremen's legislative council; both his son and his grandson, Daniel (II) and Daniel (III), were to follow him in this office. Daniel (V)'s father was a Bremen merchant and at least two of his brothers held important positions in the city, George as a clergyman and Emile as a lawyer. Three of his sisters were still unmarried by 1859; a fourth was the wife of a local merchant, Johannus Tibeman. Daniel (V) followed his father into merchanting and in 1820 took up a clerkship at Nantes; in 1822 he moved to Bordeaux, which did more trade with Bremen than any other French port. A third brother, Heinrich Albrecht (known outside Germany as Henry Albert), also became a merchant; by 1859 he had settled at Melbourne, Australia, and appears to have been linked in business with Daniel, who by then had lent him &pound;3000.<br>
<br>When the family firm, along with many others, failed during the economic downturn of 1826, Meinertzhagen moved to London and sought employment with Frederick Huth &amp; Co., merchants, where a contact of his mother and grandmother, John Frederick Gruning, was a partner and where a friend from Nantes, Jules Dufou, was a clerk. Four years earlier, Dufou had written to Meinertzhagen telling him that &#145;for learning commerce, London is without exception the best school&#146;  (Meinertzhagen, 252). Huths recruited Meinertzhagen as a clerk and his rapid progress was consolidated when in June 1833 he married Amelia Huth (1810&#150;1887), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48245/', "Frederick Huth")</script>, at St John's Church, Hackney, Middlesex. They had eight daughters and three sons, the eldest of whom was Daniel (VI), born in 1842. His betrothal resulted in his admission to the Huth partnership in January 1833, despite his modest wealth; by 1836 he still contributed only &pound;4200 of his firm's capital of &pound;123,000. In 1837 he became a naturalized British subject.<br>
<br>The Huth business had been formed by Frederick Huth in London in 1809. He had come from Hamburg via Spain and initially his firm, widely recognized as a leading &#145;German&#146; house, did business with Europe and especially with Germany, Spain, and the Baltic. Its interests were extended to the west coast of South America in the mid-1820s, when local houses were established at Lima and Valpara&iacute;so. By the time of Meinertzhagen's admission, Huths was a major London merchant bank, ranking immediately below firms such as Barings and Rothschilds. Barings recorded in the 1820s that &#145;there is no doubt that their means are most complete for anything they may undertake&#146; and that &#145;Mr Huth is a most prudent &amp; circumspect man and thought highly of&#146;  (Baring Brothers &amp; Co. archives, HC16.1).<br>
<br>Frederick Huth, who retired in 1850 aged seventy-three, and who died in 1864, almost outlived Meinertzhagen, which makes distinction of their individual achievements difficult. However, Meinertzhagen, who succeeded as senior partner of a partnership largely comprising Huth's sons, appears to have had little regard for the entrepreneurial skills of the junior Huths. &#145;I often wish the counting house was again in our house and that you could come sometimes and be by my side &hellip; so as to gain an interest in the business&#146;, he confided to his wife in 1843, but adding &#145;it is not in your family and [I] do not like to talk about it then&#146;  (Meinertzhagen, 277). Under Meinertzhagen's leadership, the Huth business made steady progress; by 1845 its capital was &pound;312,000, and it rose to about &pound;500,000 by 1870.<br>
<br>It seems fair to attribute Huths' important diversification into North American trade and finance to Meinertzhagen, though he came to this with no obvious qualification. As a major accepting house, in 1839 Huths established a Liverpool firm to handle its cotton finance business and in 1837 it became co-financier, with Barings, of the Bank of the United States; later, however, unlike Barings, it made substantial losses when the bank collapsed. By the 1850s important business was done in financing the export of railway materials to the United States.<br>
<br>If accepting was one leg of Huths' business in the USA, then trading in securities was the second. The firm became a major conduit for the flow of United States securities to Europe, but it specialized in placing them privately, often among rich continental investors, rather than making public issues. By the mid-1830s, important positions were taken in Morris Canal and Banking Company bonds, New Orleans City stock, and New York 5 per cents. In 1839 Meinertzhagen reached agreement with the Bank of Missouri for the sale of Missouri state and bank bonds.<br>
<br>When financial crisis overwhelmed the United States in 1841, Huths was badly damaged and Meinertzhagen, along with the young Louis Huth, was dispatched to rescue what he could. Despite having &#145;hardly anything but bad business to attend to, constant discussions with debtors and lawyers, and nothing very cheering from London&#146;, he appears to have done well, and stated that in Florida &#145;I have been rather fortunate in settling one of our heaviest claims. &hellip; In Texas I have also secured a small claim which we had considered as lost&#146;  (Meinertzhagen, 291).<br>
<br>In extending Huths' securities business to Europe in 1863, Meinertzhagen &#145;was much in favour&#146; of joining a consortium of seven of London's second-division houses to form the International Financial Society, but in doing so he had to overcome the opposition of &#145;old Huth&#146; who had &#145;said nay&#146;  (Kynaston, 221). This combination aimed to compete with more powerful forces in winning a share in arranging finance for infrastructure projects and governments largely in central Europe.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Meinertzhagen maintained close links with his native Bremen, where his wider family continued to live. By 1859 he had provided a house and land at nearby Grohn for use by his mother and three unmarried sisters, and in the same year Bremen granted him its freedom in recognition of his assistance during the financial crisis of 1857. In London Meinertzhagen's leading role in the German community was illustrated by his treasurership, taken up by 1862, of the German Hospital. His daughter-in-law described him as &#145;a delightful personality, a hard worker, enterprising and far seeing and generous almost to a fault&#146;  (Meinertzhagen, 16).<br>
<br>Early on Meinertzhagen lived above Huths' City offices in South Place, but later he settled at Devonshire Place in London's West End. Later still he acquired Belmont House, a country home at Wimbledon, where he died on 12 July 1869; he was buried in Mottisfont churchyard, Hampshire. Daniel (VI) succeeded him as a partner at Huths, and subsequent generations of Meinertzhagens played a prominent role both in the affairs of Huths, until their winding up in 1936, and in the City of London generally.<br>
<br>Although few details of his achievements are now known, Meinertzhagen was one of London's greatest merchants during the mid-nineteenth century. On his death, <span class="italic">The Times</span>, then not noted for carrying obituaries of merchants, described him as &#145;a leading and greatly esteemed member of the mercantile world&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 13 July 1869).<br>
