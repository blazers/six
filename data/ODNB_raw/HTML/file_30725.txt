<span class="headword">Berkeley, Sir  George</span>  (1819&#150;1905), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, born on the island of Barbados, West Indies, on 2 November 1819, was the eldest son of General Sackville Hamilton Berkeley, colonel of the 16th regiment of foot, who had served at the capture of Surinam in 1804, of the Danish islands of St Thomas, St John, and St Croix in 1807, and of Martinique in 1809, and was descended from a branch of the family of the earls of Berkeley. His mother was Elizabeth Pilgrim, the daughter of William Murray, of Bruce Vale estate, Barbados. He entered Trinity College, Dublin, on 3 July 1837, and graduated BA in 1842. Soon afterwards he returned to the West Indies, where he remained for most of his active life.<br>
<br>On 11 February 1845 Berkeley was appointed colonial secretary and controller of customs of British Honduras, where he was also <i>ex officio</i> member of the executive and legislative councils. While still serving in that colony he was chosen in 1860&#150;61 to administer temporarily the government of Dominica, and on 8 July 1864 was appointed lieutenant-governor of the island of St Vincent. During his tenure of office in 1867 an act to amend and simplify the legislature substituted a single legislative chamber for the two houses which had been in existence since 1763.<br>
<br>Berkeley was acting administrator of Lagos from December 1872 to October 1873, when he was appointed governor-in-chief of the west Africa settlements (Sierra Leone, the Gambia, Gold Coast, and Lagos). The Gold Coast and Lagos soon became a separate colony (24 July 1874), and Berkeley was recalled to allow the appointment at a reduced salary of a new governor of Sierra Leone and the Gambia. While on his way home in June 1874 he was offered, and accepted, the government of Western Australia, but did not take up the appointment, being sent instead to the Leeward Islands as governor-in-chief. There he remained until 27 June 1881, when he retired on a pension. He was created CMG on 20 February 1874, and KCMG on 24 May 1881.<br>
<br>Berkeley died unmarried in London on 29 September 1905 at his home, 10F Hyde Park Mansions, Marylebone Road, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
