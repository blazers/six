<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Savage family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1369&#150;1528), <span class="occ">gentry</span>, originated in Derbyshire. The Savages established an important interest in Cheshire in the late 1370s after <a name="cosubject_69954"></a><span class="headword">John (I) Savage</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1386)<span class="occ"></span> married as his second wife the heiress Margaret Danyers. The lands she brought to him, which included Clifton, Cheshire, had been granted to Geoffrey of Dutton by John, constable of Chester, during the reign of Henry II. John Savage had risen to prominence in the service of Edward, the Black Prince, in France: one of the remaining garrison commanders after 1369 when the days of large-scale musters had passed, he held Salveterre in 1373. John died in 1386, leaving an heir, John (II), and three daughters, Elizabeth, Blanche, and Lucy. Margaret survived him and went on to marry Piers Legh, younger son of Robert Legh of Adlington; but it was her Savage descendants to whom she gave the liberty of bearing her arms, argent, four (or five) fusils in pale, sable.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_69955"></a><span class="headword">Sir John (II) Savage</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1450)<span class="occ"></span> achieved success in royal service. Like his father, he served in France: Froissart records his complaint in 1390 at the tournament of St Inglevert that he had not crossed the sea merely to run one lance. Under Richard II he was appointed keeper of the park of Macclesfield, along with Piers Legh of Macclesfield. Yet he made the transition to the Lancastrian allegiance: soon after Bolingbroke's accession, Savage was granted a fee and in the first year of the reign he led troops in Henry IV's Scottish campaign. John (II) consolidated his interest around Macclesfield, receiving a lease of its mills in 1408, and he was often a justice on eyre in Cheshire. Knighted at Agincourt, in 1418 John (II) led 250 Cheshire men to Calais; he also received significant rewards from a ransom. Early in Henry IV's reign he married Maud, daughter of Robert Swinnarton, heir to a valuable inheritance which included all the lands once held by Hugh Despenser, earl of Winchester, in Staffordshire and Cheshire; these included the manor of Great Barrow, Cheshire. With Maud, John had five sons, John (III), William, Arnold, George, and Roger, and three daughters: Margaret, who married John, eventual heir to Sir Piers Dutton of Dutton; Maud, who married Sir Thomas Booth of Barton; and Isabel, who married Robert Legh of Adlington. In 1428, after Maud's death, John married again. The identity of his second wife is not entirely certain. She has usually been identified as Ellen (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Urswyk), who had previously been the wife first of Robert Molyneux and then of Sir James Harrington. But claims have also been made for her having been the daughter of Sir Ralph Vernon of Shipbrook, and although the evidence for the second identification is meagre, it would help to explain the settlement of Vernon estates upon Sir John and his wife that was made early in Henry VI's reign. Sir John (II) died on 1 August 1450; his son and heir, John (III), was already in full maturity, and the foundations for a transition of power from father to son were laid in 1439 when they were jointly appointed to office in Macclesfield for life.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_69956"></a><span class="headword">John (III) Savage</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1463)<span class="occ"></span> extended Savage interests by obtaining a stake in the Middlewich salt industry. He married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William Brereton, with whom he had John (IV), his son and heir (born in 1421 or 1422), and three daughters: Margery, who married first Edmund Legh of Baguley, and second Thomas Leycester of Nether Tabley, as his second wife; Margaret, who also married twice, first to John Maxfield, and second to Randle Mainwaring of Carincham, third son of Randle Mainwaring of Peover; and third, Ellen, who married Piers Warburton. John (III) died on 29 July 1463, aged fifty-three, leaving John, his heir, aged forty and more.<br>
<br>John (II) Savage was retained in 1441&#150;2 by Humphrey Stafford, first duke of Buckingham, but Buckingham's intervention in the politics of Cheshire was short-lived. More productive and long-lasting connections were formed with the houses of York and Stanley. Although there is a possibility that John (III) entered the service of the house of York, it seems more likely that it was his son <a name="cosubject_69957"></a><span class="headword">Sir John (IV) Savage</span>  (<em>c.</em>1423&#150;1495)<span class="occ"></span> who did so. He was therefore well placed to benefit from Henry VI's deposition. John (III) served as deputy to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26278/', "Sir Thomas Stanley, afterwards Baron Stanley")</script>, as steward of the duchy lordship of Halton, Cheshire. John (IV) married Stanley's daughter Katherine; the couple's children were many and prominent. Aside from John (V), Savage's son and heir, there was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24727/', "Thomas Savage (d. 1507)")</script>, who rose to be bishop of Rochester in 1492, and of London in 1497, and archbishop of York in 1501, Sir Humphrey, Lawrence, James, Sir Edmund, Christopher, William, George, and Richard. His daughters made good matches, with Ellen being married to Peter Legh of Lyme, Katherine to Thomas Legh of Adlington, Margaret to Edmund Trafford of Trafford, Lancashire, Alice to Roger Pilkington (<i>d</i>. 1527) [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52792/', "Pilkington family")</script>], and Elizabeth to John Leek of Langford, Derbyshire. John (IV) was knighted at Elizabeth Woodville's coronation in May 1465, and although he is not always easily distinguished from his son and namesake, he probably also became a knight of the body to Edward IV, and a banneret after the Scottish campaign of 1482; he was also very prominent in local affairs in Cheshire and the north midlands. In 1484, as mayor of Chester, he presided when his sons were made freemen of the city.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_24716"></a><span class="headword">Sir John (V) Savage</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1492)<span class="occ"></span>, who fought for Edward IV at Tewkesbury, became a royal carver and knight of the body, and was second in order of precedence when Edward was buried. He received many important grants, including that of the constableship of Hanley Castle, Worcestershire. As such close supporters of Edward IV, and associates of the Stanleys, it is not surprising that John (V) and his father seem to have been mistrusted by Richard III. Thomas Savage may have been abroad during the latter's reign and possibly acted as the Savages' direct contact with Henry Tudor. According to Polydore Vergil, John (V) was one of those who &#145;invited&#146; Tudor to invade. He certainly played an important role at Bosworth, where he commanded the left wing. The author of <span class="italic">Bosworth Feilde</span> described him and his men, clad in their distinctive white livery hood:<blockquote>
<div>Sir John Savage, that hardy Knight,<br>
</div>
<div>deathes dentes he delt that day<br>
</div>
<div>with many a white hood in fight,<br>
</div>
<div>that sad men were at assay.<br>
</div> (Hales and Furnivall, 3.255)</blockquote>As a result of this support, in 1486 he received an extensive grant in the north midlands of the forfeited estates of John, Lord Zouche, and Francis, Viscount Lovell, valued at &pound;158 p.a. or more. He also received extensive grants of office, especially in Worcestershire and Gloucestershire. The support of the Savages for Henry Tudor guaranteed them a growing prominence at court, and at eight out of eleven council meetings for which evidence survives during the period June&#150;July 1486 either John (V), or Thomas, or both, were present. Sir John (V) Savage led the force that seized Humphrey Stafford from sanctuary at Culham in 1486. He married Dorothy, daughter of Sir Ralph Vernon of Haddon, and the marriages of his daughters suggest the extending interest of the family: Alice married Sir William Brereton; Felicia married Robert Milward of Eaton, Derbyshire; Ellen married John Hawarden; and Maud married Sir Robert Needham of Shenton, Shropshire. Sir John (V) Savage was also notable for his illegitimate offspring: George Savage, parson of Davenham, who himself fathered several illegitimate sons, including George Savage, chancellor of Chester, John Wilmslow, archdeacon of Middlesex, and perhaps <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2850/', "Edmund Bonner")</script>, bishop of London. John (V)'s brothers also enjoyed successful careers: Sir Humphrey established a position in Staffordshire and served in the parliament of 1491&#150;2 as knight of the shire for the county; Sir Edmund was knighted at Leith in May 1544 and married Mary, widow of Roger Legh of Ridge, and daughter and heir of William Sparke of Surrey.<br>
<br>Yet the Savages suffered the same difficulties as the Stanleys, in spite of their support for the king. When Richard Savage, brother of John (V), failed to appear on a murder charge, his father was imprisoned. Sir John (V) was killed at the siege of Boulogne in 1492, and Sir Humphrey was already suspected of involvement in the activities of Perkin Warbeck in September 1493, when his house was attacked by two royal servants. The Savage family's remarkable success in winning office and land in the north midlands had already made them enemies, most notably (and in spite of John (V)'s marriage) the Vernons of Haddon. For a few years immediately after 1485 the Savages could rely on the support of others with influence in the region, including the Stanleys, to whom they were related. But by March 1494 this alliance had dissolved, as the Stanleys moved to support the Vernons; Stanley violence, most clearly seen in the murder of William Chetwynd in June 1494, may have helped to forge an alliance between the Savages and Henry Willoughby. Yet Savage and Stanley interests had already clashed, most obviously in the Pilkington&#150;Ainsworth dispute over the manor of Mellor on the Derbyshire&#150;Cheshire border. The Savages, and particularly Bishop Savage, pressed the claims of John Ainsworth, although his adversary Robert Pilkington, who relied on the good lordship of the earl of Derby and his heir, claimed to be able to show his ancestors in possession for eight generations. Conflict flared in 1493, when Sir John (IV) Savage distrained the tenants for rents and evicted those who would not pay, and trouble continued intermittently into the next century. The attack on Sir Humphrey in that same year may also reflect his family's residual loyalty to the Yorkist succession, and fears aroused in Cheshire by the intrusion of the council in the marches of Wales into the palatine administration.<br>
<br>Sir John (IV) Savage died on 22 November 1495 at the age of seventy-three. His grandson <a name="cosubject_69958"></a><span class="headword">Sir John (VI) Savage</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1527)<span class="occ"></span> succeeded to his father's offices after the latter's death at Boulogne and became a knight for the body by 1501. John (VI) married Anne, daughter and heir of Ralph Bostock, and thereby acquired a claim to the Venables of Kinderton inheritance. Although the Venables interest had the case dismissed from Star Chamber to common law, John (VI) Savage used the influence of the earl of Shrewsbury, Sir Thomas Lovell, and Edmund Dudley to secure victory. With Anne he had seven sons, John (VII), Edward, George, Richard, Lawrence, Roger, and Thomas, and a daughter, Anne, who married Thomas, sixth Baron Berkeley, in 1533. The fall of Sir Humphrey Savage did not affect John (VI)'s career. The most obvious sign of his success at court was the marriage of his heir John (VII) to Elizabeth, the daughter of Charles Somerset, later earl of Worcester. Yet, especially after the death of Archbishop Thomas, the Savages' position was still open to challenge. In 1498 John (VI) lost the stewardship of the High Peak, Derbyshire, and a combination of personal extravagance and royal policy left him in debt to the crown. By 1515 some Savage estates were taken into royal hands to secure payment.<br>
<br>Although John (VI) provided a contingent for the campaign against France in 1512, and his son <a name="cosubject_69959"></a><span class="headword">Sir John (VII) Savage</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1528)<span class="occ"></span> led a company in 1513 and was knighted at Tournai, the Savages' continued contempt for royal authority in their regional power bases in the west and north-west soon made them a target for Cardinal Wolsey's determination to administer &#145;indifferent&#146; justice. The immediate occasion for action against them was the murder on 31 March 1516 by John (VII) and his associates of John Pauncefote, a JP in Worcestershire and potential rival to the Savages in that region. Both Johns were taken into custody in the Tower in June 1516. By the time the two men were brought into king's bench in February 1517 the number of indictments had grown to at least sixty-seven. After a long series of hearings, which also provided the occasion for a radical reinterpretation of the laws of sanctuary, the alleged violation of which had formed the central plank of John (VII)'s response to an appeal of murder, both Johns abandoned their defences, and in November 1520 were granted royal pardons. Clearly, a deal had been concocted behind the scenes, involving the king's sister Mary and John (VII)'s brother-in-law, the earl of Worcester. The settlement was not to the Savages' advantage, however, for John (VI) lost his offices and had substantial fines imposed. For the payment of these nearly all the Savage estates outside Cheshire were entrusted to royal feoffees and leased back to the family at an annual rent of &pound;160, while for additional security those in Cheshire were also taken over by the crown. Despite their consequent heavy indebtedness the Savages seem to have failed to learn their lesson, continuing in subsequent years a long-standing quarrel with Sir Piers Dutton of Halton, and feuding with Ralph Leche over the manor of Ilkeston. John (VI) died in 1527, and his son John (VII) in 1528, only a few months after the crown had foreclosed on his father's debt. John (VI) was probably buried in Macclesfield church, where his son was interred. What was left of the Savage inheritance passed to John (VII)'s infant son, John Savage (<i>d</i>. 1597), who grew up &#145;to be a worshipful Elizabethan gentleman&#146;  (Ives, 319).<br>
