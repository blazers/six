<span class="headword">Brian,  (William) Havergal</span>  (1876&#150;1972), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born in Dresden, Staffordshire, on 29 January 1876, the eldest survivor of the seven sons (four of whom died in infancy) and one daughter of Benjamin Brian, a potter's turner, and his wife, Martha, daughter of James Watson. He was educated at the local infants' school and at St James's School, Longton, which had a strong musical tradition. His formal education ceased at the age of twelve: he had already shown musical talent, as a chorister and on violin, cello, and piano&#151;and while trying a variety of trades (carpenter's apprentice, railway office boy, clerk, and buyer for a timber firm) he attempted to become a professional musician. He trained with a reactionary but thorough local music teacher, Theophilus Hemmings, and began to gain some reputation as a fine church organist (it was at this time that he assumed the name Havergal, probably after the hymn composer W. H. Havergal). At the 1896 Staffordshire triennial festival he heard Beethoven's ninth symphony and the premi&egrave;re of a contemporary English work, <span class="italic">King Olaf</span>, by Edward Elgar&#151;and, fortified by encouragement from Elgar, he resolved to become a composer.<br>
<br>The years 1906&#150;12 saw Brian resident in Stoke-on-Trent and recognized as a promising figure among British composers of the younger generation, with his choral compositions becoming staple fare as test-pieces in competitions and his early cantatas and orchestral works produced to critical acclaim at various festivals. He was also active as a critic; consorted with leading musicians&#151;Elgar, Frederick Delius, Thomas Beecham, Ernest Newman, Henry Wood, and especially Granville Bantock, who became a close and lifelong friend; and was supported by the patronage of the pottery magnate Herbert Minton Robinson. This palmy period was shattered by the breakup of his first marriage in 1913, and for the next fourteen years Brian struggled to make ends meet in London, Birmingham, and Sussex, producing hack-work and occasional journalism. On the outbreak of war he joined the Honourable Artillery Company as a private, but was invalided out in 1915 (having not served abroad) and worked first in the audit office of the Canadian forces contingent, listing the effects of men killed in action, and later as a clerk in munitions for Vickers Ltd in Birmingham. After the war he was a music copyist for various publishers. The price of this hectic and unsettled life was professional obscurity: his early music dropped out of the repertory, even though in the meantime he had developed considerably, composing two works of extraordinary brilliance&#151;the satirical anti-war opera <span class="italic">The Tigers</span> (1917&#150;19) and the huge first symphony, the &#145;Gothic&#146; (1919&#150;27), for gigantic choral and orchestral forces.<br>
<br>Brian moved back to London in 1927, and his position stabilized when he became assistant editor of the journal <span class="italic">Musical Opinion</span>, a post he held until 1939. In these years, as well as producing copious and acute journalism, he continued to write a series of large-scale symphonies (nos. 2&#150;5), but hardly any of his post-1912 music was performed: he was virtually a forgotten composer. During the Second World War he was awarded a civil-list pension and worked as a clerk for the Ministry of Supply, remaining in the civil service until retirement in 1948. From that latter date&#151;possibly partly as a result of the publication of a short biography by Reginald Nettel, <span class="italic">Ordeal by Music: the Strange Experience of Havergal Brian</span> (1945)&#151;began an extraordinary Indian summer of creativity which produced a vast body of music including four operas and twenty-seven more symphonies (twenty-one of these after the age of eighty). Largely owing to the efforts of the composer and producer Robert Simpson, Brian's works began to be broadcast by the BBC, beginning with his eighth symphony in 1954, and there was a revival of interest in his music&#151;gradual at first but much accelerated by a performance of the &#145;Gothic&#146; at the Royal Albert Hall in 1966 to mark the composer's ninetieth birthday. The army of performers included 500 singers, 50 brass, 16 percussionists, and 30 woodwind players.<br>
<br>Brian was twice married. In 1899 he married Isabel Alice, daughter of George Dalton Priestley, painter and decorator; they had four sons (one died in infancy) and a daughter. After his first wife died he married in 1933 Hilda Mary (<i>d</i>. 1980), daughter of Creswell Hayward, decorator of china and other pottery; previously they had had three daughters and two sons.<br>
<br>In 1958 Brian moved from Harrow (where he had spent the previous twenty years) to Shoreham by Sea, Sussex. Manchester University conferred on him the honorary degree of doctor of music in 1967; the following year he moved into a council flat on Shoreham beach, and he composed his last works there. In July 1972 he received the accolade of composer of the year from the Composers' Guild of Great Britain.<br>
<br>Physically a small man, of impassive and unassuming mien, his conversation richly flavoured by the Potteries accent he never lost, Brian dedicated his life to music with the utmost tenacity of a sardonic, idiosyncratic, and deeply original mind. His knowledge of past and contemporary music was more encyclopaedic than that of practically any of his contemporaries, and he was deeply stirred by nature, by Gothic architecture, and Romantic literature&#151;he taught himself German, French, and Italian. Despite his humble origins and lack of worldly success he did not regard himself as socially or artistically disadvantaged, and the early termination of his formal education left him free to follow his own interests to the furthest degree.<br>
<br>Though in his early years Brian wrote many songs and partsongs, as well as some instrumental music, after the age of fifty he concentrated almost exclusively on music-drama and works for large orchestra. Several of these pieces remain unperformed, and his largest&#151;a cantata setting of Shelley's <span class="italic">Prometheus Unbound</span> (1937&#150;44)&#151;is lost, a fate which has overtaken several earlier scores. His music developed from the stylistic basis of the late Romantics (Berlioz, Wagner, Elgar, and Strauss), but a pronounced streak of scepticism led him to question the heroic assumptions of these masters and to counterbalance their harmonic opulence with a muscular, &#145;objective&#146; polyphony inspired by the example of Bach and Handel, searching development of motivic cells, and ironic juxtapositions of highly contrasted and mutually subversive kinds of music. While his works are generally tonal, therefore, their argument is elliptical, rejecting carefully formalized solutions in favour of open-ended procedures that continually undercut the listener's expectations. It is not comfortable (though it can be inspiring) music to listen to; it is also extremely difficult to play without extensive rehearsal, and few of his symphonies have yet been performed to a standard sufficiently high to project their substance with the force it deserves. Nevertheless, the &#145;Brian revival&#146; proved no temporary phenomenon; a gradual realization grew that he was one of the most important British composers of the twentieth century. He died on 28 November 1972 at Southlands Hospital, Shoreham, as a result of complications following a fall outside his home. His youngest child, a daughter, predeceased him by seven months.<br>
