<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Shenstone,  William</span>  (1714&#150;1763), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 18 November 1714 at The Leasowes, the family farm on Mucklow Hill, north-east of Halesowen, then part of Shropshire, and baptized at Halesowen church on 6 December, the elder of two sons of Thomas Shenstone (1685/6&#150;1724), son of William Shenstone of Lapull, and his wife, Ann Penn (1692/3&#150;1732), eldest daughter of William Penn of Harborough Hall, Hagley, part of which estate Shenstone later inherited. According to Johnson, Shenstone developed an early enthusiasm for reading, and pestered members of his family for new books every time they went to market: &#145;It is said that when his request had been neglected, his mother wrapped up a piece of wood of the same form, and pacified him for the night&#146;  (Johnson, 348). He was taught initially by Sarah Lloyd, later to be the model for his <span class="italic">School-Mistress</span>, and attended Halesowen grammar school briefly before being taught by the Revd John Crompton at Solihull School. Here he met Richard Jago, a lifelong friend, correspondent, and fellow poet. Shenstone's father died in June 1724, aged thirty-eight, and his mother died in June 1732, aged thirty-nine; his grandmother managed the estate, but on her death he was placed under the guardianship of his uncle, the Revd Thomas Dolman of Broome, Staffordshire.<br>
<br>In May 1732 Shenstone was admitted commoner at Pembroke College, Oxford; Johnson had already left, but Shenstone formed lasting attachments with Anthony Whistler and the future novelist Richard Graves, both at Pembroke. Jago went to University College. Shenstone made a point of wearing his own hair rather than a wig, thus incurring &#145;ill-natured remarks&#146; in the various clubs which he and Graves frequented  (Graves, 178). He studied &#145;mathematics, logic, natural and moral philosophy, and the other sciences usually taught in the university&#146;  (Graves, 23), and after four years wore the gown of a student of civil law, but spent most of his energy on poetry. From April 1736 he was listed as a BA in the college battels books, but he never claimed to have a degree. A large mulberry tree in the fellows' garden at Pembroke was known as &#145;Shenstone's tree&#146;. About 1733 he wrote a small mock-heroic poem, &#145;The Diamond&#146;, but his first published volume was <span class="italic">Poems upon Various Occasions</span> (1737), some copies of which are anonymous; it included an early version of <span class="italic">The School-Mistress</span>, the affectionate Spenserian parody for which Shenstone is chiefly remembered. He left Oxford in August 1739, but his name remained on the register at Pembroke until March 1742.<br>
<br>From Oxford Shenstone initially returned to Harborough Hall, where Richard Graves spent a pleasantly indolent month's visit. Shenstone visited London and Bath, contributed to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, went to the theatre, and flirted with literary society. In <span class="italic">The Judgement of Hercules</span> (1741), addressed to George Lyttelton, whom he supported at the Worcester election in 1741, he appears to choose the pursuit of active virtue and literary fame against the pleasures of slothful rural retirement, but most of the subsequent poetry reverses this decision. He revised <span class="italic">The School-Mistress</span> (1742), doubling the poem's size, adding detail to the portrait of the strict but sympathetic country teacher, and enhancing his appreciation of Spenser's &#145;peculiar tenderness of sentiment&#146;  (&#145;Advertisement&#146;). The poem did not receive the reception Shenstone thought its due, and gradually his work took on a more reclusive, melancholic, and occasionally Gothic tone: by 1748 he had written twenty-six elegies, many of them in praise of introspective retreat from society. His &#145;A Pastoral Ballad, in Four Parts&#146;, later set to music by Thomas Arne, laments parting from an early love (the sister of his friend Richard Graves), though it was later rewritten for another romance, curtailed by lack of funds. In the early 1740s he also wrote a large number of songs and ballads, and humorous pieces. This work was later published, sometimes without formal permission, in the last three volumes of his friend Dodsley's influential <span class="italic">Collection of Poems by Several Hands</span> (1748&#150;58).<br>
<br>In 1744 Shenstone withdrew to The Leasowes, where he had sometimes boarded with the tenant. He now set about turning the estate into a landscape garden, or <i>ferme orn&eacute;e</i>, &#145;which he did with such judgement and such fancy as made his little domain the envy of the great and the admiration of the skilful: a place to be visited by travellers, and copied by designers&#146;  (Johnson, 350). He continued to agonize about his decision to abandon literary society, and to revise <span class="italic">The School-Mistress</span>, but his main energies went into diverting streams to create waterfalls, and clearing undergrowth to display &#145;natural&#146; beauties from advantageous viewpoints. Shenstone showed his many visitors round the serpentine walks and surprise vistas in a careful routine; the garden was popular enough to engender a certain rivalry with Lyttleton's much bigger park at Hagley, and Shenstone sometimes complained that Lyttleton showed people round his garden the wrong way on purpose. The garden was filled with seats, urns, temples, and obelisks, many with inscriptions, in the structured form of picturesque contemplation made popular by the designer Batty Langley. Among the buildings were some designed by Sanderson Miller, and a number of fashionable Gothic &#145;ruins&#146;, one of which was made habitable for a tenant.<br>
<br>Shenstone's mature years were saddened by ill health and the deaths of the poet James Thomson (1748), Shenstone's brother (1751), his cousin Mary Dolman (1754), Anthony Whistler (1754), and Lady Luxborough, the troubled sister of Viscount Bolingbroke with whom he had corresponded for many years (1756). He also found himself engaged in a lawsuit about the division of the Harborough property, which was eventually settled in 1758 after the intervention of Lord Stamford. Shenstone managed to establish new friendships with the printer John Baskerville, the critic Joseph Spence, and the industrialist Matthew Boulton. Otherwise he spent his time gardening, painting, playing music, and collecting <i>objets d'art</i>. He confined his literary efforts to letters and to the assistance of friends like his bookseller Robert Dodsley, and Thomas Percy, whose <span class="italic">Reliques of Ancient Poetry</span> owes much to Shenstone's literary taste. He also prepared an anthology of poems by his friends, which remained unpublished until 1952.<br>
<br>Graves describes Shenstone as having &#145;a dull heavy look, unless when his features were animated by any sprightly sentiment, which rendered them extremely pleasing. His favourite dress was a plain blue coat and a scarlet waistcoat with a broad gold lace&#146;  (Graves, 25). Carlyle met him in 1758 and described him as &#145;a large heavy fat man, dressed in white clothes and silver lace, with his gray hairs tied behind and much powdered, which, added to his shyness and reserve, was not at first prepossessing&#146;; but Carlyle reports that once Shenstone's &#145;reserve and melancholy&#146; abated, he &#145;became good company&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, ed. Burton, 388). Richard Graves included a cameo of Shenstone in <span class="italic">The Spiritual Quixote</span> (1773), and the same author's <span class="italic">Columella</span> (1779) is partly based on Shenstone's character. Some of his contemporaries, such as Walpole and Gray, thought the pose of retirement was affected in order to elicit curiosity or sympathy.<br>
<br>Shenstone died at The Leasowes on 11 February 1763, &#145;of a putrid fever&#146;  (Johnson, 353), later rumoured to have been caused by sitting outside one night after an argument with his housekeeper (or mistress) Mary Cutler. The fever is more prosaically associated with Shenstone's return from a visit to Lord Stamford at Emville in connection with a government pension, for which Lord Loughborough had made application to Lord Bute. He was buried on 15 February in Halesowen churchyard, beside his brother Joseph (1722&#150;1751), who had trained but never practised as an attorney; there is a memorial urn to him beside the north wall of the church with an inscription by Graves. Johnson suggests that the poet, whose income was about &pound;300 a year, got himself into debt with extravagant works; he had perennial trouble in recovering his rents, and his &#145;The Progress of Taste&#146; laments the disparity between his income and his ambitions. In his will Shenstone made provision for the payment of his debts by directing the sale of several small estates and houses. Dated a few days before he died, it bequeathes The Leasowes to his cousin John Hodgetts of Birmingham, for life, and thereafter to another cousin, Edward Cooke of Edinburgh, and his heirs, specifying that the property could be sold to friends such as the Hon. John Grey, son of Lord Stamford. Shenstone also left an estate at Quinton, Halesowen, and a house in Birmingham, to his cousin John Shenstone. There were several other sizeable bequests to relatives, friends, and servants. Mary Cutler received an annuity of &pound;30. She later challenged the will on the grounds that back wages were unpaid, promises of recompense made by Shenstone had not been carried out, and the executors had failed to pay her specified legacies.<br>
<br>Shenstone's garden continued to attract visitors (Goldsmith wrote an essay on it in 1773), but it was not carefully maintained. The house had been rebuilt by 1781; it is now the clubhouse for Halesowen golf course, which partly covers the garden. The rest of the 58-hectare estate is managed by Dudley metropolitan borough council, and is being restored according to Shenstone's designs. Shenstone had been planning a subscription edition of his works, but in the event Dodsley immediately set about publishing Shenstone's <span class="italic">Works in Verse and Prose</span>. The poems constituted volume 1 (1764); <span class="italic">Essays on Men, Manners, and Things</span>, including influential essays on gardening, with a plan of The Leasowes and an enthusiastic description by Dodsley, appeared as volume 2 (1764); and a collection of Shenstone's letters to his friends made up volume 3 (1769). A scholarly edition of the letters was published by Marjorie Williams in 1939, but the poems, which were admired by Johnson, Burns, Hazlitt, and Ruskin, and reprinted many times into the nineteenth century, still lack a thorough modern edition.<br>
