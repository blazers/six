<span class="headword">Allen,  Norman Percy</span>  (1903&#150;1972), <span class="occ">metallurgist</span>, was born in Wrexham, north Wales, on 5 June 1903, the fifth of ten children, seven girls and three boys, of Sidney Edward Allen, an accountant in the borough treasurer's department at Wrexham, and his wife, Emily Eliza Davis. He was educated at Burton upon Trent Boys' Grammar School from 1913 to 1920. He was awarded the prestigious Linley open scholarship at Sheffield University, studied metallurgy there under Professor C. H. Desch, and graduated with a second-class honours degree in 1923. After a two-year spell in the university working on low melting point zinc base die-casting alloys he joined Swansea University College in 1925 to work on the porosity of copper and copper alloys. There he met Olive Gwendolen Williams, his future wife. She was a native of Swansea, where her father, J. H. Williams, was a tin-plate and metal merchant. In 1928 Allen joined Birmingham University as assistant lecturer, and he was married in 1929. There were two sons and one daughter of the marriage.<br>
<br>At Birmingham, Allen studied the mechanism responsible for the porosity of commercial tough pitch copper. Allen showed that this was related to the presence of hydrogen in the melt in thermodynamical equilibrium with copper oxide present, and that on solidification this would lead to the evolution of hydrogen gas or steam, forming small blowholes. On the basis of this work Allen was awarded the DSc degree by Birmingham University in 1934.<br>
<br>In 1933 Allen joined the Mond Nickel Research Laboratory in Birmingham, where he remained until 1944. He was second in command to Dr L. B. Pfeil. Apart from his administrative duties for the research programme as a whole, he was involved in a major research project on the transformation characteristics of low alloy steels, in particular on the effect of alloying elements such as nickel and chromium, which enabled steel to be hardened in thick sections on cooling from high temperature; this helped to economize on these strategic elements which were in short supply during the war. From 1939 he and his colleagues developed the Nimonic alloys suitable for high temperature applications in gas turbines. These alloys transformed the Whittle engine into practical reality, and even today remain the standard blading material for many aircraft and land-based gas turbine installations throughout the world. Allen made a major contribution to the speed with which these alloys became available for exploitation by engine designers.<br>
<br>In 1944 Allen joined the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) as superintendent of the metallurgy division, and initiated a good mix of programmes, ranging from the academic to the applied. While he was conversant with the whole of the work going on, he was personally involved with a number of the projects. In 1963 Allen initiated the superconductivity project, aimed at promoting the application of superconductors in industry.<br>
<br>The NPL was also very much involved in the development of materials for high temperature service. Systematic studies were carried out in the division on creep of Nimonic alloys for gas turbines, and on a variety of alloys used in power station components&#151;for example, superheater tubes and steam pipes. These careful and objective researches were a major factor which enabled the turbine designer to increase continually the size, operating temperature, and efficiency of the turbine units.<br>
<br>Following the catastrophic failures of certain welded ships during the war, a long-term investigation was initiated in 1946 under Allen's leadership to determine the effects of alloying elements on the mechanical properties of pure iron. This work contributed significantly to improved steel making procedures in the late 1950s, and to an understanding of the complex mechanical properties.<br>
<br>In 1966 Allen was appointed deputy director of the NPL and until he retired at the end of 1969 he was concerned with the administrative changes needed in the formation of the materials group which absorbed the metallurgy division. He received many honours, including election to the Royal Society in 1956, the Bessemer medal of the Iron and Steel Institute in 1965, and the platinum medal of the Institute of Metals in 1967. He was president of the Institution of Metallurgists in 1961&#150;2, was made an honorary fellow of the Institute of Metals in 1971, and was appointed CB in 1966. He had honorary doctorates from Prague (1964) and Sheffield (1966).<br>
<br>Allen was short and stockily built and his face was notable for the bushy eyebrows, the owlish glasses, and an ever present smile. He was full of energy, and worked at a pace which his staff sometimes found difficult to match. He was very good at stating a case, and he appeared to enjoy an argument. He was conscientious and a very hard worker, who set high standards. He did not tolerate anything slipshod in experimental work or argument. At home he took a full interest in his family and their development. He enjoyed walking and gardening and in his later years became an enthusiastic amateur painter. Allen died suddenly on 23 February 1972, at his home, 10 Firlands, Ellesmere Road, Weybridge, Surrey, when influenza brought on the failure of an already weakened heart.<br>
