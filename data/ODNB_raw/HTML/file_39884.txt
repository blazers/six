<span class="headword">Part, Sir  Antony Alexander</span>  (1916&#150;1990), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born on 28 June 1916 in Chelsea, London, the only son of Alexander Francis Part, barrister and company director, from a Lancashire family, and his second wife, Una Margaret Reynolds Snowdon, from Yorkshire. He had a younger sister, an older half-brother and half-sister, and a younger half-brother. His early childhood years were spent in happy and prosperous family surroundings in Chelsea, but his adolescence was overshadowed by his parents' divorce. After a good grounding in classics at a preparatory school he entered Harrow School with a scholarship at the age of twelve and later specialized in French and German. He won a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he achieved first-class honours in both parts of the modern and medieval languages tripos (1935 and 1937).<br>
<br>Part entered the Board of Education in 1937 through the competitive examination for the administrative class of the home civil service. Though he was soon lent to the newly created Ministry of Supply, a keen interest in education and training motivated the greater part of his civil service career. In 1940 he married a ballet dancer, Isabella (Ella), daughter of Maurice Bennett, businessman. His marriage was happy and although they had no children he and his wife maintained a close relationship with his siblings and their children.<br>
<br>Part joined the Royal Ulster Rifles in 1940, but his knowledge of German quickly led to a commission in the intelligence corps, where by 1943 he had gained rapid promotion to lieutenant-colonel, serving in the western desert campaign and later in the twenty-first army group headquarters preparing for the invasion of France. His personality was changing. At school he had been shy and retiring. University had built his self-confidence. Finding in the army that he was thought somewhat over-assertive, he learned an important lesson about leadership which he never forgot.<br>
<br>Recalled to the Ministry of Education at the end of 1944, Part became principal private secretary to three successive ministers. His first major opportunity came in 1946 when he and the chief architect of the department as joint heads set up a new branch to assist education authorities to build the new schools needed to meet the demands of the rising birth rate and the raising of the school leaving age. The programme they developed was so effective in enabling good schools to be built quickly at acceptable cost that it earned international reputation. As a Commonwealth Fund fellow in the USA in 1950&#150;51, Part found leading American experts in school building eager to learn from him about these British methods. He contracted tuberculosis in America and did not return to work until spring 1953.<br>
<br>Promoted to under-secretary in 1954 as head of the schools branch and later of the further education branch, Part was active in the initiatives to improve and expand technical training at all levels through technical colleges and colleges of advanced technology. He became deputy secretary in 1960, covering teacher training and further education, served as a departmental assessor on the committee on higher education (1961&#150;4) chaired by Lord Robbins, and seemed well positioned by ability and experience to achieve his growing ambition to become permanent secretary of the Ministry of Education.<br>
<br>There were, however, other plans for Part. In March 1963 he was moved to the Ministry of Works to organize a merger of departments into the Ministry of Public Building and Works, of which he became permanent secretary in 1965. It was as permanent secretary of the Board of Trade in 1968, of the newly created Department of Trade and Industry in 1970, and of the Department of Industry from 1974 to 1976 that he had the greatest scope for the exercise of his talents and experience. He worked hard to establish an industrial department as a major force in Whitehall and was greatly upset by the decision of the Labour government to split the Department of Trade and Industry into three in 1974. His strengths were his vision, his genuine interest in manufacturing industry, his ability to work constructively with most businessmen, trade unionists, and politicians, and his flair for public speaking. He exhibited great energy and determination in everything he undertook, whether in the fields of education or trade and industry. He put into practice his strong conviction that public administration should be efficient and financially prudent.<br>
<br>After retiring from the civil service in 1976, Part took up a new career as a non-executive director of a number of firms, including chairmanship of Orion Insurance Company. He continued his active interest in education as deputy chairman of the court of governors of the London School of Economics. Part was appointed MBE (1943), CB (1959), KCB (1966), and GCB (1974). He received honorary degrees from Brunel (1966), Aston (1974), and Cranfield (1976), and an honorary fellowship of the London School of Economics (1984). In his prime he was tall and dark with a confident bearing. However, he had poor health all his life and this greatly affected his appearance in his last years in the civil service and thereafter, major heart surgery causing him to have a pronounced stoop and to move very slowly. He enjoyed the performing arts, but his main interests were in his work in both public and private sectors, which despite his ready wit he took very seriously. Part, who lived latterly at Flat 5, 71 Elm Park Gardens, London, died of heart failure in Westminster Hospital, London, on 11 January 1990. A memorial service was held at St Margaret's, Westminster, on 22 February 1990. He was survived by his wife.<br>
