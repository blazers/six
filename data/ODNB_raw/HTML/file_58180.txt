<span class="headword">Moore,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1806&#150;1823), <span class="occ">mathematician and rocket theorist</span>, is a person of whom little is now known. His publications showed his mathematical competence, but he was not an Oxford or Cambridge graduate and was probably self-taught and thus near the end of a long line of similar men typified by Benjamin Robins (1707&#150;1751) or Charles Hutton (1737&#150;1823). He is shown among the preliminary appointments in the records of the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, for 1741&#150;1892, as becoming the sixth mathematical assistant in 1806 and as remaining on the mathematical staff until he was either retired or discharged when staff cuts were made in 1822 or 1823. The examining board that appointed him consisted of Charles Hutton and two others. According to a transcript dated October 1806, Moore and Peter Barlow (1776&#150;1862), also then appointed, were thought &#145;capable of becoming very useful Masters&#146;. <br>
<br>There is no published recognition by Charles Hutton of Moore, despite their teaching and researching in the same academy, supposedly side by side for several years. In Hutton's article &#145;Rockets&#146; in volume 2 of his <span class="italic">Philosophical and Mathematical Dictionary</span> (1815) there is no mention of Moore or of his publications. Woolwich was then the centre of British rocket research and development, and Moore probably personally knew Sir William Congreve, inventor and rocket pioneer, and was presumably influenced by his work on rockets. <br>
<br>In 1811 Moore published <span class="italic">A Treatise on the Doctrine of Fluxations</span>. His <span class="italic">Treatise on the Motion of Rockets [and] an Essay on Naval Gunnery</span> (1813) is acknowledged as the first publication on rocket mechanics which correctly proceeds from Newton's principles, calculating on the basis of equations following from Newton's third law of motion, that &#145;action and reaction are equal and opposite&#146;. The second topic in the title, the penetration of wood by round shot, was then already well researched. The aim was to predict gunpowder charges which would cause solid iron round shot, projected at speeds of about 1500&#150;2000 feet per second, to penetrate the &#145;wooden walls&#146; of ships in action at sea. <br>
<br>In September 1807 Copenhagen was successfully bombarded by British Congreve rockets. In 1810 the academy of Copenhagen proposed a prize essay on the related topics of rocket trajectories when projected in an oblique direction, the effects of perturbations on them, and certain matters pertaining to Congreve rocket combustion. Moore did not submit a competition essay but wrote four short incomplete papers, published in the <span class="italic">Journal of Natural Philosophy</span> (1810&#150;12). The questions set in the competition were so wide-ranging as to deter all but two entrants. This led Moore to write his <span class="italic">Treatise</span>, essentially an extension and refinement of his papers, but also including naval gunnery theory. He did not himself experiment, and admitted that his results were theoretical and needed to be tested by experiment. <br>
<br>Moore's date and place of death are now unknown. German bombing in the Second World War destroyed invaluable documents with data on men, presumably including Moore, who had worked at Woolwich.<br>
