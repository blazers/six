<span class="headword">Kendall,  George</span>  (1808/9&#150;1886), <span class="occ">Chartist and trade unionist</span>, was baptized in the village of Hoton on the Hill near Loughborough on 26 July 1811, the son of George and Sarah Kendall. Starting work in the local hosiery industry at the age of five years, he moved to Sutton in Ashfield as a young man and worked as a framework knitter, making stockings and socks on a hand frame. He married, and with his wife, Sarah, had two children, Elizabeth, born in 1834, and George, born in 1836.<br>
<br>Industrial villages like Sutton were the location of most organized Chartist activity and Kendall became a recognized leader of the Sutton framework knitters during the early 1840s. He spoke at or presided over many of the larger meetings in the locality, and represented his village at delegate meetings. In addition he was called to give evidence to the 1845 commission on the condition of the framework knitters.<br>
<br>The origins of Nottinghamshire discontent sprang from a depression in the framework knitting trade. The introduction of new marketing techniques and the pressure to reduce standards of work, together with a labour force for which there was not enough work in times of slack trade, had led to the continual lowering of wages and speeding up of work. The operatives had, by the Chartist period, been involved in machine breaking and in various forms of trade union activity in their attempts to reverse the continual downward trend of their wages and conditions, but without success.<br>
<br>As well as pursuing the political programme of the six points of the <span class="roman">People's Charter</span>, Kendall and his group campaigned against wage reductions and against the &#145;truck system&#146; (the payment of wages in goods). In his evidence before the commission of 1845 Kendall stressed the evils of this system. He became the secretary of an anti-truck association formed by some of the local Chartists which took many employers to court. The result of his activity led to his being blacklisted by employers in the locality, but had little effect on reducing the prevalence of truck payment.<br>
<br>In the second half of the century the hosiery trade began to improve, and trade union organization became more possible. Kendall became the secretary of the local wide-hand framework knitters' trade society. His first wife died of tuberculosis and he married his second wife, Mary Ann, who was eighteen years his junior. There were two more children from this marriage, Eliza, born in 1859, and William, born in 1861.<br>
<br>During the 1850s and 1860s the Sutton operatives, under Kendall's continued leadership, took part in an experiment in industrial relations: this involved the establishment of an arbitration board on which workers and employers could discuss problems before they reached a phase of industrial dispute. The first chairman of the board was A. J. Mundella, the radical politician and hosiery manufacturer. The board seems to have maintained a degree of tranquillity in the relations between the two sides of the industry, and truck payment was finally abolished altogether. Unfortunately, the experiment did not establish a model for other industries as its originators had hoped, and it broke down in the harsher competitive conditions of the 1870s, finally coming to an end in 1884.<br>
<br>Apart from his political and industrial activities, Kendall, like many other ex-Chartists, was an active supporter of the 1870 <span class="roman">Education Act</span>. He served on the local school board for eight years, using his position to make the service available to the poorer children by the waiving of fees and encouraging families to keep the children in full- or half-time education in spite of the availability of juvenile employment. In 1879 when illness forced him to give up his work in the hosiery trade, Kendall resigned his chairmanship of the Sutton school board in order to become its employee as a school caretaker. He worked in this post for seven years, but continued his association with his trade and with local affairs generally.<br>
<br>Kendall died of cancer on 14 October 1886 at 21 Union Street, Sutton in Ashfield, and was buried in the churchyard of St Mary's Church, Sutton, on 16 October. He was survived by his wife.<br>
