<span class="headword">Mickleton,  James</span>  (1638&#150;1693), <span class="occ">antiquary and lawyer</span>, was born in Durham on 19 April 1638, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70468/', "Christopher Mickleton (bap. 1612, d. 1669)")</script>, attorney, of Durham, and his first wife, Mary King (<i>c</i>.1615&#150;1644). He was educated at Durham School, admitted to Gray's Inn in 1652, and to Christ's College, Cambridge, and the Inner Temple in 1656. He was called to the bar in 1663. He was appointed keeper of the seal of the county palatine of Durham in 1689.<br>
<br>Mickleton was married on 29 April 1660 to Frances Hall (<i>bap</i>. 1634, <i>d</i>. 1690). His father, Christopher, marked the occasion by transferring to him the ownership of the family home of Crook Hall, on the outskirts of Durham, but friction soon arose between father and son over the right to occupy the property, resulting in rancorous litigation. James was totally excluded from his father's will, which described him as &#145;ungratefull, unthankfull, abusive and disobedient&#146;  (will of Christopher Mickleton).<br>
<br>Like many lawyers, James Mickleton collected manuscripts both for their practical value as legal records and for their absorbing antiquarian interest. As he himself expressed it, &#145;There is a certain pleasure &amp; delight in hearing &amp; discoursing of Matters that have been in old times before us wch mightily provoked me to look into Antiquity&#146;  (Mickleton and Spearman MS 1, fol. [3]). He had a circle of friends with similar interests to his own, among whom was John Davies of Kidwelly, who dedicated to him his edition of <span class="italic">The Ancient Rites &hellip; of Durham</span> (1672), an important account of the pre-dissolution regime and buildings of Durham Cathedral. Mickleton probably became acquainted with Davies through his brother-in-law John Hall, Davies's patron.<br>
<br>Mickleton died on 3 August 1693, and was buried in Durham Cathedral on 4 August. The value that he attached to his manuscript collections can be judged from his will, in which he left detailed instructions as to how they were to be cared for. Certain major compilations were left to trustees, in the hope that they could eventually be published, while the remainder of his local history collection was left to his only surviving son, Michael (1663&#150;1711). His collection of printed and manuscript law books he left to <a href="#cosubject_74232">James [<i>see below</i>]</a>, the eldest of Michael's ten children. Michael seems to have been a disappointment to his father. He was called to the bar in 1684 and married Elizabeth (1667&#150;1704), the daughter of John Spearman, a prominent Durham lawyer. However, he did not pursue a legal career or share in his father's antiquarian pursuits, and it was the younger James Mickleton who continued the family interest in manuscript collecting.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_74232"></a><span class="headword">James Mickleton</span>  (1688&#150;1719)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 27 March 1688 and baptized in Durham Cathedral on 2 April 1688. In 1705 he was admitted to the Inner Temple; in 1709 he became a member of Furnival's Inn and in 1716 he migrated to Gray's Inn, which became his normal London residence. He was called to the bar in 1718. Mickleton was married in 1711 or 1712 to Hannah Eden (<i>b</i>. 1686), daughter of his grandfather's close friend Sir Robert Eden. Little is known of this marriage. It seems to have ended on Hannah's death, no later than the spring of 1718. There were no surviving children.<br>
<br>Ownership of his grandfather's legal and antiquarian manuscript collections, together with an easy social manner, gave Mickleton ready access to antiquarian circles, and although he undoubtedly made some effort to study law he gradually became preoccupied with social life and historical studies. His acquaintances included Humfrey Wanley, library keeper to Lord Harley, and John Anstis, Garter king of arms. He assisted Wanley in tracking down works suitable for the Harleian Library, and gave help to Anstis in his researches into heraldry. Meanwhile he continued to add to his own collections, and in 1716 acquired, as a gift from a great-uncle, the library of his great-grandfather Christopher Mickleton. In July 1717 he was one of twenty-three members present at the inaugural meeting of the Society of Antiquaries at the Mitre tavern.<br>
<br>Mickleton's income was not equal to his social aspirations, and by November 1719 he was in deep financial difficulties. The bookseller Richard Sare described his state in a letter to Wanley: &#145;he was &hellip; surrounded with Dunns, running into every ones Debt that wou'd lend him money; the Thoughts whereof made him fly to Drinking, so that he was seldom sober&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 3781, fol. 25). According to Sare, he had met with a repulse in his courtship; probably he had unsuccessfully attempted to extricate himself by the well-established expedient of an advantageous marriage. On 25 November 1719 his drowned body was found in the Thames. The verdict of the inquest was the charitable one of &#145;accidental death&#146;, but all the circumstances suggest the likelihood of suicide. He was buried in St Clement Danes, Strand.<br>
<br>On James Mickleton's death the family manuscript collections were bought by his uncle, Gilbert Spearman, also an antiquary, who added his own family's manuscripts. The combined collection passed down the Spearman family until 1817, when it was presented to Shute Barrington, bishop of Durham. Barrington caused the collection to be divided. The legal manuscripts were given to the library of the Inner Temple, where they became known as the Barrington manuscripts, and the antiquarian material was presented to the dean and chapter of Durham, and eventually passed to Durham University as the Mickleton and Spearman collection.<br>
<br>The volumes that the elder James Mickleton wished to be published were never printed in the form that he envisaged. However, his manuscripts and those of his grandson continue to be used as a source for legal and historical research in a way that amply fulfils his intention in forming the collections.<br>
