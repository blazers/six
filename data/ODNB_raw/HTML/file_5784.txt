<span class="headword">Cockerill,  William</span>  (1759&#150;1832), <span class="occ">inventor</span>, was born in Lancashire, of unknown parentage, and began life by making &#145;roving billies&#146;, and flying shuttles. He was gifted, however, with an extraordinary mechanical genius, and could make with his own hands models of almost any machine. Although the identity of his wife remains unknown, he was probably married by the time he went to Russia in 1794, having been recommended as a skilful artisan to the Empress Catherine II. At St Petersburg he received every encouragement, but the death of the empress only two years later totally ruined his prospects. Her successor, the madman Paul, sent Cockerill to prison, merely because he failed to finish a model within a certain time. Cockerill, however, escaped to Sweden, where, joined by his sons Charles James and William, he was commissioned by the government to construct the locks of a public canal; but his attempts to introduce spinning and other machines of his own invention were not appreciated. He therefore proceeded in 1799 to Verviers in Belgium, where he entered into a contract with the firm of Simonis et Biolley, which enabled him to supply his machines. He was joined by a third son, <a href="#cosubject_5784">John [<i>see below</i>]</a>, in 1802. On the expiry of the contract in 1807 Cockerill settled at Li&egrave;ge with his sons, and there established factories for the construction of spinning and weaving machines. His business increased rapidly. He had thus secured to Verviers supremacy in the woollen trade, and had introduced at Li&egrave;ge an industry of which England had hitherto possessed the monopoly. The merits of his inventions and workmanship were acknowledged by an industrial commission of 1810 and in the same year he took French nationality. Two years later Cockerill retired from business in favour of his two younger sons, Charles James and John. Of his eldest son, William, little is known. His daughter, Nancy, married James Hodson, a skilful mechanic, of Nottingham, who settled at Verviers in 1802, and realized a princely fortune. Cockerill died at the Ch&acirc;teau de Behrensberg, near Aix-la-Chapelle, the residence of his son Charles James, in 1832, aged seventy-three.<br>
<br>Cockerill's son <a name="cosubject_5784"></a><span class="headword">John Cockerill</span>  (1790&#150;1840), <span class="occ">woollen manufacturer</span>, born on 30 April 1790 at Haslingden, Lancashire, was consigned to the care of a relative in England until 1802, when he was apprenticed to his father in Verviers. In 1807, when only seventeen, he shared with his brother Charles James the management of the factory at Li&egrave;ge. Soon after the battle of Waterloo the brothers were permitted, through the kind offices of M. Beuth, the Prussian minister of finance, to set up a woollen factory at Berlin. Their success tempted John Cockerill to propose a still greater enterprise. On 25 January 1817 the brothers established at Seraing on the River Meuse what was to prove the most extensive iron foundry and machine manufactory on the continent. John Cockerill married Jannette F&eacute;d&eacute;rique Pastor of Aix-la-Chapelle on the same day that his brother Charles married her sister. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>The king of the Netherlands, William I, supported the Cockerill brothers' endeavours and was until 1835 a partner in the business, having invested in it the sum of &pound;100,000. In that year (1835) John Cockerill became the sole proprietor. In February 1839 the firm was in liquidation, but the reverse proved only temporary. Shortly afterwards John Cockerill went to St Petersburg to submit to the tsar his plans for the construction of railways in Russia. On his return, he contracted typhoid fever in Warsaw, and after ten days' suffering he died in his wife's arms on 19 June 1840. In 1867 his remains were taken back to Seraing by his family, where their arrival was greeted by a popular demonstration on 9 June 1867. His statue was unveiled at Seraing on 29 October 1871.<br>
