<span class="headword">Cleverdon,  (Thomas) Douglas James</span>  (1903&#150;1987), <span class="occ">bookseller and radio producer</span>, was born on 17 January 1903 in Bristol (he retained all his life a faint trace of a Bristol accent), the elder son (there were no daughters) of Thomas Silcox Cleverdon, master wheelwright, and his wife, Jane Louisa James. The only book in the house in those days was his mother's Welsh <span class="roman">Bible</span>. He was educated at Bristol grammar school, where he learned his love of books from the headmaster, Ted Barton. While still an astonishingly good-looking schoolboy in a cap and blazer he went for a week to London, and walked into Francis Birrell's and David Garnett's new bookshop. He was f&ecirc;ted by Clive Bell and Roger Fry, and introduced to the latest work in painting, engraving, and printing.<br>
<br>Cleverdon published his first catalogue as an undergraduate at Jesus College, Oxford, immediately establishing his reputation as a lover of fine printing and exquisitely illustrated books. He became part of what he himself later called the &#145;typographical renaissance&#146; made possible by Stanley Morison's reintroduction of great typefaces of the past and Eric Gill's sculptural lettering, and became a close friend and disciple of both. At Oxford he obtained a second class in classical honour moderations (1924) and a third in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1926).<br>
<br>In 1926 Cleverdon opened his own bookshop in Charlotte Street, Bristol. Roger Fry painted the hanging sign, bought from an old pub, with Athena's owl perched on a pile of books, and Eric Gill painted the fascia over the shop window in sans-serif capitals. Cleverdon asked him for a copy of the alphabet, and it was from this that Morison commissioned the famous &#145;Gill Sans-serif&#146;. At this time he also began publishing, with Gill's <span class="italic">Art and Love</span> (1927), printed in a limited edition, including thirty-five copies on full vellum, and S. T. Coleridge's <span class="italic">The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</span> (1929), for which he commissioned ten copper-engravings, and an introduction from David Jones. This venture was brought to an end by the economic depression, but Cleverdon continued to sell books until the end of the 1930s, when he was persuaded by Francis Dillon to begin working part-time for the BBC. In 1939 he worked for <span class="italic">Children's Hour</span> and in the same year became a west regional features producer. In 1940, as he himself put it, &#145;a bomb fell on the bookshop, and I was with the BBC for thirty years&#146;. In 1943 he became a features producer in London. He was to bring to radio all his skills as a publisher: inspired commissioning of new work; patient encouragement and direction of writers, musicians, and actors; perfectionism in editing and production; and all the craftsmanship he had learned from Morison and Gill, and in his father's workshop.<br>
<br>It was shortly before the Second World War that Cleverdon met (Elinor) Nest Lewis (1920&#150;2003), former head girl of the Clergy Daughters School in Bristol, and daughter of James Abraham Lewis, canon, of Cardiff. They eventually married in 1944, though John Betjeman referred to her ever afterwards as &#145;Douglas's child bride&#146;. They were to have two daughters, the elder of whom, born in 1948, died immediately, and three sons, the eldest of whom died at birth in 1952. Cleverdon, busy, bustling, chuckling, with sparkling blue eyes and a slightly irregular smile, would greet almost everyone as &#145;my dear&#146; to save himself from having to remember names. He was a small man, but even so it was said that he towered over his wife. She was to be his strength and stay.<br>
<br>Cleverdon's main achievement of the war years was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/57624', "The Brains Trust")</script>, which he devised with Howard Thomas, and which reached an audience of twelve million. He was sent briefly to Burma in 1945 as a BBC war correspondent, and on his return began by developing the already existing <span class="italic">Radio Portrait</span> series for the Third Programme. He dramatized David Jones's <span class="italic">In Parenthesis</span> (1948) and <span class="italic">The Anathemata</span> (1953), using the voices of Richard Burton and Dylan Thomas. He also launched Henry Reed's satirical <span class="italic">Hilda Tablet</span> series in 1953, broadcast the poems of Sylvia Plath, Ted Hughes, Thom Gunn, Wole Soyinka, John Betjeman, Siegfried Sassoon, and Stevie Smith, and produced the work of David Garnett, Rose Macaulay, Compton Mackenzie, and Jacob Bronowski. He also travelled to Rapallo to record a series of broadcasts with Max Beerbohm.<br>
<br>Cleverdon produced programmes of folk-song with A. L. Lloyd and Alan Lomax, and commissioned new music from Humphrey Searle, Alan Rawsthorne, Lennox Berkeley, Aleksandr Tcherepnin, Peter Racine Fricker, and M&aacute;ty&aacute;s Seiber. He was the first to engage Michael Flanders and Donald Swann for the radio. His most famous commission was <span class="italic">Under Milk Wood</span>, broadcast in 1954, which he succeeded in wringing out of Dylan Thomas shortly before his death in 1953.<br>
<br>Cleverdon retired from the BBC in 1969, and, as well as organizing poetry festivals, returned to publishing, with his own Clover Hill Editions, called after the Old English meaning of his own name. His printer was his old friend Will Carter of the Rampant Lions Press, Cambridge. He preserved the same standards he had set himself as a young man, with beautifully produced work by Reynolds Stone, Michael Ayrton, and David Jones, and <span class="italic">The Story of Cupid and Psyche</span>, an unprinted Kelmscott Press book with wood blocks by William Morris after Sir Edward Burne-Jones. Cleverdon died on 1 October 1987 at his home at 27 Barnsbury Square, London.<br>
