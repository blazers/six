<span class="headword">Spicer, Sir  Albert</span>, first baronet  (1847&#150;1934), <span class="occ">paper merchant and wholesale stationer</span>, was born on 16 March 1847 at Clapham, Surrey, the second of four sons and sixth of ten children of James Spicer (1807&#150;1888), a wholesale stationer of Woodford Green, Essex, and his wife, Louisa (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Edwards). He was educated at Mill Hill School and was then sent to Heidelberg where he learned to speak German fluently.<br>
<br>Shortly after Spicer returned to England in 1864 his grandfather, John Edward Spicer, died leaving his stationer's business at 182 New Bridge Street, London, to his three sons. They fell out, however, and James started another paper merchant firm, James Spicer &amp; Sons, at 50 Upper Thames Street, London. His two brothers, meanwhile, continued the existing business in New Bridge Street under the name Spicer Bros. Both branches of the Spicer family were influential Congregationalists. On James Spicer's side they were linked to the Unwins, the publishing family, through the marriage of two of his daughters, one of whom, Elizabeth, became mother of Sir Stanley Unwin.<br>
<br>Albert Spicer became the dynamic figure in James Spicer &amp; Sons. With just eight employees in 1865, the firm tapped new markets for printing and writing paper by acting as an intermediary between the paper manufacturers on one side and retailers and consuming organizations on the other. The company developed a regional branch house system, moved swiftly when new markets (such as school boards or county councils) appeared, and vigorously sought foreign markets, mostly in the British empire, Albert himself making overseas tours. In 1879 he married Jessie Stewart Dykes (1857&#150;1934); they had three sons and eight daughters.<br>
<br>Albert and his brother Evan (1849&#150;1937) strengthened their competitive position by increasing the capital investment in their London facilities, rebuilding the Upper Thames Street premises, and in 1886 acquiring an envelope factory in Southwark. In 1910 the partnership was converted into a private company, James Spicer &amp; Sons Ltd, with an authorized capital of &pound;450,000. It continued to build up its British and empire distribution network so that in 1913 it had warehouses in London, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Glasgow, Bristol, Melbourne, and Durban, and offices in Belfast, Liverpool, Edinburgh, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Wellington (New Zealand), Cape Town, and Paris.<br>
<br>The slump after the First World War increased the pressures on specialist wholesalers and dealers. James Spicer &amp; Sons protected their position by reuniting with their cousins. The two Spicer firms merged in 1922 with the formation of Spicers Ltd with an authorized and issued capital of &pound;1.15 million. It owned Eynsford Mills in Kent and the Sawston Mills, Cambridgeshire; two factories in Southwark; and a new factory at Brimsdown, Middlesex. Albert Spicer received 4966 of the 50,000 &pound;10 ordinary shares and 5162 of the 65,000 5 per cent &pound;10 preference shares in Spicers and, in addition, an annuity of &pound;3000 for five years. He remained chairman of the new company for one year before retiring from business in 1923.<br>
<br>In London's business community Albert Spicer was a considerable figure. He was president of the London chamber of commerce from 1907 to 1910 and in 1909 visited Sydney as president of the Chambers of Commerce of the Empire. For ten years, from 1907, he sat on the commercial intelligence advisory committee of the Board of Trade. During the First World War he was a member of the royal commission on paper supplies.<br>
<br>Outside business Spicer's interests centred on Congregationalism and Liberal politics. He was elected to the Essex Congregational Union and then, in 1873, to the London Missionary Society's board, serving as chairman from 1882 and as treasurer from 1885 to 1910. Spicer was also instrumental in the building of Mansfield College, Oxford, a Congregational theological college, of which he was treasurer from 1888 to 1921. In 1892 Spicer was elected the second lay chairman of the Congregational Union of England and Wales and in 1899 moderator of the International Congregational Council held at Boston. He attempted to inject greater social concern into his denomination but made little headway. In 1919&#150;20, as chairman of the laymen's commission on ministerial stipends, he visited local Congregational churches, encouraging lay support for the local ministry. It was calculated that his gifts, chiefly but not only to the Congregational cause, averaged 26 per cent of his income during his active life. He became vice-president of the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1896, president of the Sunday School Union in 1900, and for seven years served on the army council's advisory committee on the spiritual and moral welfare of the army.<br>
<br>Spicer entered politics by sitting on the Woodford school board from 1877 to 1892. By 1888 he had held every official position connected with Liberal organizations in Essex. He founded and was vice-president of the London and Counties Liberal Union and by 1888 was a trustee of the National Liberal Club. He unsuccessfully contested the Walthamstow division of Essex in 1886 but sat as Liberal MP for Monmouth Boroughs from 1892 to 1900, and for Central Hackney from 1906 to 1918. For public services Spicer was created a baronet in 1906 and sworn of the privy council in 1912.<br>
<br>In 1912 Spicer chaired the Marconi inquiry committee which investigated the dealings between Godfrey Isaacs and leading Liberal politicians. Partly because of his deafness he failed to dominate the committee, and the Liberal members glossed over what all agreed was at least ministerial impropriety, and what tories saw as corruption. To his credit, Spicer issued his own report departing from both sides. He died on 20 December 1934, at his home, 24 Palace Court, Bayswater, London, his wife having died before him, in May 1934. He was cremated at Golders Green crematorium.<br>
