<span class="headword">Gilbert,  John</span>  (1812&#150;1845), <span class="occ">zoological collector and explorer in Australia</span>, was born on 14 March 1812 in Newington Butts, London, the son of William Gilbert (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1793), a carpenter, and his wife, Ann (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1792); they were from villages in Kent just 3 miles apart. As a teenager Gilbert was apprenticed to John Gould (1804&#150;1881), who was then employed as taxidermist to the Zoological Society of London but later became an illustrious publisher and bird artist. Gould taught him the principles of the art of taxidermy, a specialist skill of which he became a master. Very little is known about his private life; he seems to have married twice, to a widow, Catherine Alice Crump, on 6 September 1829, and to Esther Sadler on 29 November 1836. He may have had a daughter, though clear evidence of any offspring is lacking. He apparently had two younger brothers (William (<i>b</i>. 1813), and Thomas (<i>b</i>. 1818)) and a sister, possibly called Rachel.<br>
<br>Gilbert became the first curator of the Shrewsbury Museum in 1836, but was dismissed after only a few months for trying to install his wife in his rooms at the museum. After applying to his former employer for help he was hired as field assistant on Gould's much-heralded 1838 expedition to Australia. He soon proved his worth as a collector and naturalist. At first Gould and he worked together in Tasmania, but soon Gould became so sure of his capabilities that, in early 1839, Gilbert was sent on his own to Western Australia. He also collected on the Cobourg peninsula of Northern Territory, at that time a totally unexplored area, between 1840 and 1841.<br>
<br>In 1841 Gilbert returned to Britain, but such had been his success in Australia that Gould almost immediately sent him back. Gilbert worked his old patches in Western Australia for a time, having many adventures, such as nearly being shipwrecked on the notorious Houtman Abrolhos islands. He eventually moved on to New South Wales, working his way overland to the lush Darling Downs of southern Queensland. Here he had a fateful encounter with the German explorer Ludwig Leichhardt. In October 1844 he joined Leichhardt's overland expedition from Brisbane to Port Essington (north of Darwin); after many trials and tribulations the party was ambushed by Aborigines at Dunbar Creek near Mitchell River, Cape York peninsula, on 28 June 1845, and Gilbert died almost instantly when a spear pierced an artery in his neck. He was buried at the scene of the attack the next day.<br>
<br>Gilbert collected more new species of Australian birds and mammals than any other collector, past or present. Of the 785 or so species of Australian birds or mammals that are known to exist, Gilbert was the first collector of fifty-nine (7.5 per cent). There are Gilbert specimens in museums all over the world, but the most important are in Liverpool, London, and Philadelphia. Among the many bird species he discovered were the paradise parrot, <i>Psephotus pulcherrimus</i>, which is now probably extinct; the Gouldian finch <i>Chloebia gouldiae</i>, possibly the most colourful bird in the world; and Gilbert's whistler (otherwise known as Gilbert's thickhead) <i>Pachycephala inornata gilbertii</i>, first collected by Gilbert in Western Australia. Of a long list of mammals which he discovered, perhaps the most appropriate to mention is Gilbert's rat-kangaroo <i>Potorous tridactylus gilbertii</i>, which was rediscovered at Two Peoples Bay in Western Australia in November 1994, after having been thought to be extinct since the 1870s. No photographs or pictures of Gilbert have been located, but he is said to have been short, dark, and spare; he was a good bushman, a crack shot, an excellent zoologist and taxidermist, and could turn a neat phrase with his pen. He seems to have been an industrious and efficient soul who did not suffer fools at all.<br>
