<span class="headword">Disney,  William</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or after 1633, <em>d.</em> 1685), <span class="occ">conspirator</span>, was the eldest son of Molyneux Disney (1614&#150;1694), army officer, and his wife, Mary (<i>bap</i>. 1616, <i>d</i>. 1669), youngest daughter of Sir Robert Monson of North Carlton. The family had been well-known puritan landowners at Norton Disney, Lincolnshire, for many generations. Molyneux Disney married Mary Monson on 14 January 1633. He raised a troop of horse for parliament in 1642&#150;3 and was active in local government in 1645&#150;6, but appears to have become somewhat disillusioned with the parliamentary side and in 1649 was fined for having corresponded with the royalists. In 1673 he was commissioned as an officer in the duke of Albemarle's regiment of foot.<br>
<br>Disney was admitted to the Middle Temple on 12 November 1654 but was apparently never called to the bar, although a contemporary later claimed he was a barrister. Disney's activities in the 1660s and 1670s remain a mystery. In the 1680s, when he became active in whig politics, he can once again be traced. In 1680 Disney confessed to Secretary of State Leoline Jenkins and the earl of Essex that he had been investigating the issue of the duke of Monmouth's possible legitimacy, trying to discover whether Charles II had indeed married Monmouth's mother, Lucy Walters. In 1681 he published a pro-parliament treatise entitled <span class="italic">Nil dictum quod non dictum prius, or, A transcript of government considered as it is in the state of nature or religion</span>. Disney set out to prove that the &#145;Saxon constitution&#146;, with its emphasis on the great council of the kingdom, survived the conquest of 1066 intact. He next asserted that the power of parliament remained<blockquote>unlimited and universal &hellip; it hath power above the Law it self, having power to alter the common law of England, to declare meaning of any doubtful law, to repeal old patents, grants, or charters and Judgements whatsoever of the king, or any court of justice, if erroneous or illegal, not without, but against the king's personal consent. (W. D., 135)</blockquote>Disney was reportedly related to the Rye House plotter Major John Wildman. While there is no evidence directly linking Disney to the plot to assassinate Charles II and the duke of York at Rye House in 1683 it seems highly likely that he was involved or at least knew about the conspiracy. Following the suspicious death of the earl of Essex in the Tower in July 1683 while awaiting trial for involvement in the plot, Disney was also active in whig efforts to prove that Essex was murdered and had not committed suicide. In the months preceding Monmouth's rebellion in June 1685, Disney acted as a contact between whigs and dissenters in the Netherlands and England. He apprised Wildman and former Fifth Monarchist Henry Danvers of Monmouth's plans, but both were reluctant to give support. At one point, Disney told a Monmouth envoy in London that he had consulted with some unnamed gentlemen (probably lords Delamere and Macclesfield) and that they had suggested that the duke join the earl of Argyll's invasion of Scotland, believing that the people of England were not inclined to help Monmouth. With the help of the Quaker bookseller John Brickhurst and a Rye House conspirator, Thomas Weeks, Disney printed advance copies of Monmouth's notorious <span class="italic">Declaration</span> (penned by &#145;the Plotter&#146;, Robert Ferguson).<br>
<br>Disney was arrested at Lambeth on 15 June 1685 with 750 partially printed copies of Monmouth's <span class="italic">Declaration</span> and five perfect copies. According to <span class="italic">A true and full account given by the minister of St. George, concerning the behaviour and last dying speech of William Disney, esq.</span> (1685) he was caught with just &#145;his shirt on and his maid in his bed&#146;. On 16 June he was committed by Judge Jeffreys for conspiring the death of the king and exciting persons to rebellion. He was tried on 25 June in Southwark by special commission and the lord chief justice and found guilty of treason. Disney was hanged, drawn, and quartered on 29 June 1685 at Kennington Common in Surrey. His quarters were ordered to be fixed to the city gates. In his final moments he refused to make any discovery, begged God's pardon, and told the Anglican minister with him that &#145;he lived in and did now die in the communion of the Church of England which he repeated again in these words, &#147;the Protestant Church of England&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">A True and Full Account</span>). The name of Disney's wife is unknown, but they had at least three children, who in 1692 petitioned for and were granted pensions in compensation for the &#145;services and sufferings&#146; of their father  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1691&#150;2</i>, 157).<br>
