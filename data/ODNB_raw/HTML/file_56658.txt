<span class="headword">Africanus,  Scipio</span>  (<em>c.</em>1702&#150;1720), <span class="occ">servant</span>, was born of an African family that most likely came from west Africa, where many Bristol merchants bought or captured black men and women for transport to the American colonies. He became the servant of Charles William Howard, seventh earl of Suffolk and second and last earl of Bindon, who in 1715 had married Arabella, daughter and coheir of Sir Samuel Astry and his wife, Elizabeth Morse. The Morse family occupied the Great House in Henbury, Gloucestershire, near Bristol. Whether Scipio was acquired after the marriage or inherited from the family who previously occupied the house is unknown. He died at Henbury on 21 December 1720, closely followed by his master, in February 1722, and his mistress only four months later.<br>
<br>Scipio's elaborate gravestone remains in the churchyard of St Mary's, Henbury, with its black cherubs and distinctive epitaph, perhaps a tribute to the regard in which his employers held him, in contrast to the general anonymity of servants at that date and the virtual invisibility of black people and their stories in the official records of society. His name implies some knowledge of classical history and literature by those who gave it to him. Polybius's account of his namesake's capture of Carthage by the Romans in the third century <span class="smallcap">BC</span> suggests that black slaves might expect freedom from servitude if they exhibited goodwill towards their conquerors. The words of the epitaph reinforce this attitude, recording the victory of Christianity over paganism: &#145;I who was Born a PAGAN and a SLAVE now sweetly sleep a CHRISTIAN in my Grave&#146;. While aspects of Scipio's life remain unrecorded the status that he was accorded on his death is a monument to attitudes on race and colour in the colonial era; his is one of the very few marked burial places of the 10,000 black slaves and servants present in British society in the early eighteenth century.<br>
