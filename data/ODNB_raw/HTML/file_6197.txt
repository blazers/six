<span class="headword">Cookson,  Henry Wilkinson</span>  (1810&#150;1876), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was born on 10 April 1810 at Kendal, Westmorland, the sixth son of Thomas and Elizabeth Cookson. Wordsworth was one of his godfathers. He was educated at Kendal grammar school and at Sedbergh School, then under the headmastership of Henry Wilkinson, an old friend of the family from whom he derived his second baptismal name. In October 1828 he entered Peterhouse, or St Peter's College (as he always preferred to style the most ancient college in the University of Cambridge). His private tutors were Henry Philpott, who as bishop of Worcester was to pronounce the last words over his grave, and the famous William Hopkins of Peterhouse. He graduated BA as seventh wrangler in 1832, MA in 1835, and BD and DD in 1848. Elected a fellow of his college in 1836, Cookson was appointed tutor in 1839; his pupils included William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin). He was proctor in 1842.<br>
<br>In 1847 Cookson succeeded Dr Hodgson as master of his college, and also as rector of Glaston in Rutland until 1867 when the two offices became separated under the new college statutes. In 1855 he married Emily Valence, elder daughter of Gilbert Ainslie DD, master of Pembroke College. They had one daughter. Cookson died, after an illness of a few days, on 30 September 1876, in Peterhouse lodge, Cambridge; he was buried in the churchyard of the college benefice of Cherry Hinton, near Cambridge.<br>
<br>Cookson was one of the most influential members of his university. With his mathematical abilities he combined strong scientific sympathies and distinct literary tastes. He rendered substantial service to the Cambridge Philosophical Society, of which he was president in 1865&#150;6. A staunch protestant, in 1870 he defended the maintenance of religious tests in the university; it was no secret that in 1867, through Lord Derby, he was offered the bishopric of Lichfield, which he declined. In politics a Conservative, he was an energetic chairman of the committee in support of Anthony Cleasby during the parliamentary election for one of the university seats in February 1868. He was elected vice-chancellor on five occasions (1848, 1863, 1864, 1872, and 1873) and was almost continuously a member of the council of the senate from its institution in 1856 onwards. His &#145;unerring eye for the bye-paths of university business &hellip; earned him the nickname &#147;the artful dodger&#148;&#146;  (Brooke, 53). Although he became proverbial at Cambridge for prudence and caution, he was hardly less distinguished by a genuine enthusiasm for progress, and especially for the extension of the studies of the university, and an increase in the number of its professorial chairs. Thus he drew particular satisfaction from the practical results of university administration, such as the augmentation of the Woodwardian Museum, the enlargement of the botanical garden, and the erection of new museums; and he was one of the first to advocate the application of a proportion of the funds of the colleges to the endowment of new professorships. Altogether, he had no slight share in the remarkable development of Cambridge after 1850.<br>
