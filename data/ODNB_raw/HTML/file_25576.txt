<span class="headword">Simon, Sir  John</span>  (1818&#150;1897), <span class="occ">serjeant-at-law</span>, was born at Montego Bay, Jamaica, on 9 December 1818, the only son of Isaac Simon, a Jewish merchant, and his wife, Rebecca, only daughter of Jacob Orobio Furtado. Rebecca Simon was descended from Balthasar Orobio, who, on account of his adherence to the Jewish faith, spent three years (1655 to 1658) in the prison of the Spanish Inquisition, and whose father, Caesar Orobio, was burnt at the stake. Simon was educated at a public school in Jamaica, and a private school in Liverpool. He went on to study at University College, London, and graduated LLB in 1841 at London University. He entered the Middle Temple on 29 October 1839 and on 4 November 1842 he was called to the bar, the second Jew to be admitted. In 1843 he married Rachel, fifth daughter of Simeon Kensington Salaman of Portman Square, London, and sister of Charles Kensington Salaman, the composer. Rachel Simon was a writer. Together they had five surviving children&#151;two sons, Charles Moncrieffe Simon and Oswald John Simon, and three daughters.<br>
<br>After practising for two years in Jamaica, Simon returned to England in 1845, and became a leader on the common-law side on the northern circuit. In April 1858 he successfully defended Simon Bernard from the accusation of complicity with Orsini in the attempt to assassinate Napoleon III. On 15 April 1864 he was appointed a serjeant-at-law, and in February 1868 he received a patent of precedence, which gave him the privileges of queen's counsel, with the right of holding briefs against the crown. On 27 November 1868 he was returned to parliament as a Liberal for the borough of Dewsbury in Yorkshire. In the House of Commons it was said that he swiftly commanded attention as an authority on legal questions. He made significant speeches on the <span class="roman">Oaths Bill</span> (1880&#150;83), which he had introduced, allowing for an affirmation to be given by those who objected to taking an oath. He also spoke extensively on the government of Jamaica in 1884 and played an important part in the restoration of representative government.<br>
<br>In parliament and outside Simon was an untiring advocate of Jewish interests. Besides organizing the Mansion House meeting in 1870 to protest against the persecution of the Jews in Romania and Serbia, he entered a vigorous protest in parliament against the pogroms in Russia in 1882. He was one of the founders of the Anglo-Jewish Association in 1871. On 24 August 1886 he was knighted and in 1888 he retired from parliament. He was a member of the Reform Club. He died at his London residence, 36 Tavistock Square, on 24 June 1897, and was buried that month at Golders Green cemetery.<br>
