<span class="headword">Pigott, Sir  Arthur Leary</span>  (1749&#150;1819), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was born on 19 October 1749 in Barbados, the eldest son of John Piggott (<i>d</i>. 1776?) and his wife, Jane. A Yorkshireman, his father had emigrated in the 1730s, settling first in Barbados and later in Grenada.<br>
<br>Arthur Pigott's early life was spent in England and the West Indies. In 1767 he enrolled as a student at the Middle Temple, and in or about 1773 he married Jane Dunnington (1752?&#150;1841), of Manchester. The couple had at least one child, a daughter. In 1778 he matriculated at Oxford University from Trinity College, though he did not take a degree. He commenced his legal career in Grenada, however, and in 1780 was appointed attorney-general for the island. Even after settling in England he maintained professional ties with the West Indian plantation community, regularly acting as their parliamentary counsel on the slave trade question.<br>
<br>This toleration of slavery contrasted with Pigott's generally whiggish political creed. He owed his entry into politics to Lord North who, upon Pigott's return to England in 1780, appointed him to the newly formed public accounts commission. Thereafter, however, Pigott's views gravitated more nearly toward those of North's coalition partner, Charles James Fox. A charter member of the Whig Club, Pigott was also active in the Revolution Society, the Society of the Friends of the People, and the Friends of the Liberty of the Press. Fox's good opinion secured him the post of solicitor-general to the prince of Wales in 1783, and a too pronounced adherence to Foxite principles cost him that post in 1792.<br>
<br>Pigott's career at the English bar began in the common law courts. After being called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1777 he attended the home circuit, and in May 1783 he received a patent of precedence. Despite his silk gown he did not achieve great professional eminence in the king's bench. Commentators have blamed this variously on his inability to assess evidence rapidly before a jury, and the resolution of attorneys on his circuit, one of whom he had offended, to deny him briefs. Whatever the reason, in 1793 he migrated to the court of chancery, where his practice flourished. Henry Brougham described Pigott's knowledge of the law as accurate and profound in all its branches, and his legal opinions as deliberately considered  (Brougham, 407). The <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> praised his ability &#145;to compress into a smaller compass than is usual with equity pleaders the merits of his case&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 89, 372). His powers of oratory were not remarkable, and perhaps not surprisingly he had scant respect for rhetorical ornamentation, which he dismissed as &#145;air&#146;, &#145;fringe, as it were&#146;, and &#145;all that sort of thing, you know&#146;  (Brougham, 413).<br>
<br>On formation of the coalition government in February 1806 Pigott was appointed attorney-general as part of the Foxite contingent. Fox also secured his return to parliament for Steyning, in Sussex, interceding with the borough's patron, the duke of Norfolk. Less congenial was the intervention of the king, who insisted upon knighthoods for Pigott and the solicitor-general, Samuel Romilly. During his year in office Pigott spoke regularly in debate on legal issues, and he particularly distinguished himself by his capable management of Lord Melville's impeachment for malversation of funds. The latter was not Pigott's first experience of parliamentary litigation; in the 1790s he had been one of six lawyers retained to assist the impeachment of Warren Hastings, the former governor-general of Bengal.<br>
<br>Pigott's professional aspirations had largely been achieved by his appointment as a law officer. In the autumn of 1806 he informed Brougham that, supposing the ministry were to continue after Fox's death, he should prefer the office of accountant-general to a judgeship. He particularly objected to a judicial appointment that would require enforcement of the criminal law, which he regarded as unduly harsh. Consequently, upon the government's resignation in March 1807, Pigott did not pine for public legal office. In 1811 he resisted suggestions that he might become either lord chancellor of Ireland or chief baron of the exchequer, were his political associates to form a regency government. Instead, he was content to express moderate whig views from the back benches. He supported legislation to limit the sale of parliamentary seats, though he favoured the duke of York's reinstatement as commander-in-chief in 1811&#151;two years after an inquiry into the sale of military offices had led to the duke's resignation. In 1817 he served on the secret committee investigating civil unrest and, while acknowledging the threat to public order, he opposed suspension of the <span class="roman">Habeas Corpus Act</span>. A committed Anglican, he nevertheless advocated Catholic emancipation.<br>
<br>Friendship with the duke of Norfolk, and not merely his status as Fox's prot&eacute;g&eacute;, secured Pigott's return in successive parliaments for Arundel and Horsham, and he gradually assumed the mantle of elder statesman within his party. His private legal practice also remained steady, and as Old Pig and the Learned Pig he became one of the fathers of the equity bar. He afforded the lord chancellor, Eldon, professional respect and political aversion. Like Romilly, he objected to the long delays that marred chancery practice, but likewise felt that his own professional situation must restrict public criticism of the chancellor.<br>
<br>Pigott's last public appointment, to the civil list committee, came just weeks before his death. He died on 6 September 1819 at his home, Rose Cottage, Grove Road, Eastbourne, Sussex, and was buried in St Mary's Church, Eastbourne, six days later. His wife survived him.<br>
