<span class="headword">Prideaux,  John</span>  (1578&#150;1650), <span class="occ">bishop of Worcester</span>, was born at Stowford, Devon, on 17 September 1578, one of twelve children and the fourth son of John Prideaux, farmer, and his wife, Agnes (<i>d</i>. 1625/6). The death of his father in 1592 or 1593 left resources stretched and the latter part of Prideaux's early education, probably at Ashburton grammar school, was subsidized by Lady Fowell. After failing to become parish clerk of Ugborough, Prideaux walked to Oxford and entered Exeter College as a servant. He matriculated on 14 October 1596 and was tutored by William Helme.<h2>
<a name="EducationandrectorshipofExeterCollege"></a>Education and rectorship of Exeter College</h2>Prideaux graduated BA on 31 January 1600, became fellow of Exeter College in June 1601, and proceeded MA on 11 May 1603. Subsequently he was appointed chaplain to Henry, prince of Wales, and was thereby dispensed from some requirements in taking his BD on 6 May 1611. Shortly before Prince Henry died he secured Prideaux's election on 4 April 1612 to the rectorship of Exeter. As a result Prideaux took his DD early, on 30 June 1612. In his theses he denied that grace sufficient for salvation was granted to all; that those reborn to grace might lose it; and that sacraments confer grace <i>ex opere operato</i>. In the same year Prideaux became chaplain to King James, a post in which he continued under Charles I.<br>
<br>Prideaux shortly after married Anne, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10999/', "Dean William Goodwin")</script> of Christ Church, and granddaughter through her mother of the Marian martyr Rowland Taylor. Of their nine children, two daughters survived their father. Anne Prideaux died on 11 August 1627 and in August the next year Prideaux entered a childless marriage with Mary (<i>d</i>. 1666), daughter of Sir Thomas Reynell of Ogwel, Devon.<br>
<br>Fuller calls Prideaux a generous almsgiver, but it was ecclesiastical pluralism which made this possible: with his headship of Exeter College came the vicarage of Kidlington, Oxfordshire; in 1614 he obtained the vicarage of Bampton, Oxfordshire, which he resigned to his son-in-law, William Hodges, in 1634; in 1617 he received a Christ Church canonry in reversion and in 1620 the vicarage of Chalgrove, Oxfordshire, which he resigned to a miscreant brother-in-law in 1625; also in 1620 he became a canon of Salisbury. Nine years later he became rector of Ewelme, and soon after of Bladon-cum-Woodstock.<br>
<br>Prideaux was famed as tutor and theologian before his rectorship, during which he enhanced the college's appeal to Calvinists at home and abroad, and numbers in residence increased. Some came after a period in the household of Bishop John Williams. There were distinguished Scots, such as James Hamilton, marquess of Hamilton from 1624, and Richard Spottiswood. Prideaux attracted John Sigismund Cluverius, James Casaubon, Sixtinus Amama, and other continental scholars. Archbishop Ussher dispatched a kinsman reclaimed from popery, James Dillon, who later returned to Catholicism. Wood noted that Exeter produced besides sound men &#145;many that did great mischief&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.271). Anthony Ashley Cooper, later first earl of Shaftesbury, was there from 1637. Prideaux had a pedagogue's penchant for punning and wordplay, in part mnemonic technique; Thomas Fuller spoke of his &#145;becoming festivity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Worthies</span>, 1.279). He kept the well-born, some of whom were accommodated in his lodgings, on a loose rein and tolerated some indiscipline. Exeter men were prominent in &#145;coursing&#146; or baiting rival colleges at academic exercises, and Laud induced Charles I to threaten implicated heads in 1631.<br>
<br>By-products of Prideaux's arts tutoring were his widely used manuscript notes and published textbooks, notably <span class="italic">Tabulae ad grammaticam Graecam introductoriae</span> (1607), <span class="italic">Tyrocinium ad syllogismum legitimum contexendum</span> (1629), and <span class="italic">Heptades logicae</span> (1639). John Aubrey was taught with Prideaux's logic at Trinity College in the early 1640s, and also used his notes on moral philosophy; he later praised these easy-to-memorize manuals. To improve college tuition Prideaux obtained from his kinsman Sir John Maynard endowment of a theological readership, and established another in Hebrew.<br>
<br>Effective fund-raising enabled major building work, and even the hostile Peter Heylyn allowed that the college was transformed. Sir John Acton funded a new hall, Sir John Peryam new rector's lodgings, and George Hakewill a new chapel. Prideaux's sermon at the chapel consecration was published in 1625 and in 1631 he produced a survey of the altered college. Ever intolerant of opposition, he accepted in 1630 forged documentation of birthplace for a tied fellowship and expelled dissenting fellows. Petitions and appeals drew in Laud (as chancellor), the Star Chamber, and the king. The visitor, Bishop Joseph Hall of Exeter, censured Prideaux and reinstated the fellows.<br>
<br>Prideaux was active in the university at large. William Herbert, earl of Pembroke, and chancellor, 1616&#150;30, whom Prideaux called his &#145;Maecenas&#146;, nominated him vice-chancellor during four years, 1619&#150;21 and 1624&#150;6. In 1620 Prideaux high-handedly imposed a kinsman of the chancellor as principal of Jesus College over fellows' objections. In January 1626 he declared Sir Thomas Edmonds, recommended by Pembroke and Archbishop Abbot, MP for the university despite opposition at the election by supporters of Sir Francis Stewart. The latter appealed, and despite a skilful rebuttal, the vice-chancellor was summonsed by the committee of privilege and the election quashed. Prideaux vigorously asserted academic privileges against the city. When free to do so he courted popularity, backing in 1620 a demand by young masters to wear caps in congregation and convocation and securing Pembroke's assent.<br>
<br>Laud's ascendancy banished Prideaux to sterile opposition. In a 1627 dispute at Wadham College the enemies of Laud, then bishop of Bath and Wells, sought unsuccessfully to undermine his visitatorial jurisdiction in the secular courts, and Prideaux, a member of Gray's Inn from 1625, was implicated. In 1630 he worked to elect as chancellor the deceased Pembroke's brother, Philip, instead of the victorious Laud.<h2>
<a name="Regiusprofessorofdivinity"></a>Regius professor of divinity</h2>Since December 1615, however, Prideaux had been regius professor of divinity and he remained in control of theological teaching. Peter Heylyn observed that James I's &#145;Directions&#146; for uprooting puritanism of 1617 had been thwarted because the then vice-chancellor was Prideaux's father-in-law  (<span class="italic">Cyprianus Anglicus</span>, 1668, 72). Prideaux responded to the &#145;Directions&#146; by debating anti-Arminian points at Exeter College.<br>
<br>Prideaux had a deep knowledge of continental writers, medieval and modern, protestant and Catholic. An eclectic rather than an original theologian, he was a skilful dialectician. He was a competent Hebrew scholar and always a promoter both of that language and of Arabic. Placing great emphasis on the Synod of Dort, and a consistent proponent of the absolute decree of reprobation, he was esteemed by non-Arminians and opponents of liberal or rational theology. Affirmation of the pope as Antichrist was central to his creed and he rejected the alternatives of Mohammed or the Turk, but he had reservations about extreme apocalyptic approaches. He assailed Richard Montague's <span class="italic">Appello Caesarem</span> in 1625 and told students, contrary to the &#145;Directions&#146;, to apply themselves first to systematic catechism and only then to the fathers. Although prominent in collecting for distressed Calvinist ministers abroad, he rejected being labelled as a Calvinist. Always hard to pin down, he supported episcopacy but excused foreigners unable to enjoy it. He believed in visible pre-Reformation congregations of protestant hue but claimed that they had remained under legitimate bishops and pastors.<br>
<br>Prideaux used less measured expressions in the heat of public disputations: mature opponents were flayed by sarcasm&#151;his rebuke of Christopher Potter at his doctoral disputation in 1627 rankled ever after with the provost of Queen's College. When Gilbert Sheldon, later warden of All Souls, denied in his 1628 DD disputation that the pope was Antichrist, he was assailed by Prideaux who said the pontiff was his debtor and likely to award him a cardinal's hat. Prideaux's most celebrated opponent was Peter Heylyn, a dialectically sharp prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Laud, who provoked him and then reported incautious expressions. At his BD exercises in 1627 Heylyn examined the visibility of the church. Prideaux, addressing jibes to the youthful gallery, spoke sufficiently loosely to be represented as asserting pre-Reformation visibility in conventicles. In considering church authority at his 1633 DD disputation, Heylyn drove Prideaux to speak as if deprecating church authority.<br>
<br>1631 was a black year for Prideaux. Laud rebuked him for failing to deliver the statutory number of lectures, and again in the king's name for allowing an inconvenient Act question. Charles I considered dismissing him for his implication in efforts to thwart new statutes, entangled with court intrigue and anti-Arminian sermons by young men who flouted the vice-chancellor's jurisdiction. Laud, however, after vigorous prosecution, unexpectedly sought leniency and Prideaux escaped with a reprimand, probably after intervention by Philip, earl of Pembroke. Harassment by his ascendant enemies continued in 1634 when Heylyn published a translation of his <span class="roman">1622 Act</span> lecture, <span class="italic">The Doctrine of the Sabbath</span>, to embarrass the professor with puritanical supporters and Vice-Chancellor Brian Duppa had a sermon by Francis Mason on church authority reprinted to undermine Prideaux's influence in lectures. Meanwhile Prideaux had published nothing new since collections of his lectures and Act orations in 1625/6. He had complained to Ussher in 1628 that supervision hindered printing sound theology. For fear of Laud's spies Prideaux refused open support to John Durie's promotion of international protestant unity. The content of a set of sermons he published in 1637 got him into trouble and he must have been under considerable pressure from the archbishop when he tamely approved in that year Chillingworth's <span class="italic">Religion of Protestants</span>, the tenor of which was hateful to him. However, there were occasional flashes of spirit as when in 1636 he criticized adulatory language in the university's letter thanking Laud for new statutes. In 1640 he backed Laud's enemy, Sir Nathaniel Brent, to be a university MP.<br>
<br>Prideaux's career revived with the fall of Laud, and the new chancellor, Philip Herbert, nominated him vice-chancellor in 1641. He struggled to balance loyalties to king and chancellor. Obeying royal directions, and raising money for Charles, he seems none the less to have acquiesced in the protestation oath in early 1642. He accepted Pembroke's imposition in March 1642 of a lay lawyer, Giles Sweit, as commissary to exercise judicial functions from which parliament had seemingly debarred a clerical vice-chancellor. Infuriated fellow heads later censured his accounts for unwarranted spending, especially on Sweit's commission.<h2>
<a name="BishopofWorcester"></a>Bishop of Worcester</h2>On 22 November 1641 the king, at the marquess of Hamilton's urging, made Prideaux bishop of Worcester to assuage religious opposition. Consecrated at Westminster in December, he seems to have been absent when most of the bishops incurred impeachment and, despite voting against removing bishops from the Lords, he had sufficient credit with the Commons to be approved Worcestershire representative to the assembly of divines. His fund-raising for the king as vice-chancellor, however, provoked parliament to order his arrest on 12 July 1642. By then Prideaux had left Oxford for Worcester. Although &#145;almost grown to the Chair, he had sate so long and close therein&#146;  (Lloyd, 536) he was replaced as professor by Robert Sanderson on 19 July. Prideaux resigned as rector of Exeter College on 3 August.<br>
<br>According to Wood, the royalist Bishop Prideaux excommunicated the king's enemies. In 1643 he headed a parliamentary list of Worcestershire delinquents to be sequestrated and the following year his eldest son, William, died a colonel at Marston Moor. At the surrender of Worcester, Prideaux helped calm military hotheads. Petitioning the Lords on 24 September 1646 he claimed that he had no private means on which to survive the sequestration of his bishopric. On 25 December the Commons allowed bail to Prideaux, then in custody of the serjeant-at-arms, and granted him his books and manuscripts providing he stayed within 20 miles of London. Later he was permitted to live with his son-in-law, Henry Sutton, at Bredon rectory in Worcestershire, where he was allowed 4<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. a week for his support. He visited Oxford about 1648, probably to publish <span class="italic">Viginti-duae lectiones de totidem religionis capitibus</span>, a collection of his Latin theological works. His important <span class="italic">Fasciculus controversiarum theologicarum</span> appeared in 1649.<h2>
<a name="Deathandreputation"></a>Death and reputation</h2>Prideaux died of a fever at Bredon on 29 July 1650. &#145;Such was the number and quality of persons attending his funeral&#146; there on 16 August that &#145;such as deny <i>Bishops</i> to be <i>Peers</i>, would have conceived this <i>Bishop</i> a <i>Prince</i>&#146;  (Fuller, <span class="italic">Worthies</span>, 1.280). An ornate and adulatory Latin sermon was delivered. In his will of 20 June, Prideaux declared that he died &#145;firmely beleevinge and houldinge the Doctrine Worshipp and Discipline established and professed in the Church of England, in the raigne of Queene Elizabeth King James and the beginninge of the raigne of the late Kinge Charles&#146;  (Butcher, 24). He bequeathed his wife bonds for &pound;1000 owed by her family and &pound;100 in gold, as well as other goods. To Henry Sutton he left leasehold property adjoining Exeter College. He divided his library between his two sons-in-law, Sutton and William Hodges, joint executors and residuary legatees. Stories that he sold his library to support himself are evidently exaggerated: more than 600 of his books survive in Worcester Cathedral Library.<br>
<br>A number of Prideaux's works were published posthumously during the interregnum. In 1651 there appeared his <span class="italic">Scholasticae theologiae syntagma mnemonicum</span> and his <span class="italic">Conciliorum synopsis</span>. Notes left to his daughters on the use of common prayer were printed as <span class="italic">Euchologia</span> (1655), and a work on conscience written for his wife appeared in 1656. His collected <span class="italic">Hypomnemata logica, rhetorica, physica, metaphysica, pneumatica, ethica, politica, oeconomica</span>, tutorial notes for undergraduates, reached the press in 1656, and <span class="italic">Manuductio ad theologiam polemicam</span> the following year.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_22787"></a><span class="headword">Matthias Prideaux</span>  (<em>c.</em>1625&#150;1646?), <span class="occ">author</span>, was son of John Prideaux and his first wife, Anne. He matriculated from Exeter College on 3 July 1640 and was elected fellow on 30 June 1641. Graduating BA on 2 November 1644, he entered the king's army and his captaincy obtained him an accelerated MA on 3 December 1645. Following the surrender of Oxford in 1646 he moved to London where he died from smallpox shortly after. His father edited from his papers for publication at Oxford in 1648 the popular <span class="italic">An Easy and Compendious Introduction for Reading All Sorts of Histories</span>.<br>
