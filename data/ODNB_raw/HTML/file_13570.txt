<span class="headword">Hollond <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Teed]</span>,  Ellen Julia</span>  (1822&#150;1884), <span class="occ">salon hostess, philanthropist, and author</span>, was born at Madras on 28 September 1822, only child of the lawyer Thomas Teed (1797&#150;1843) and his Scottish wife, Julia Jane Jordan (1800&#150;1866), afterwards Lushington. Sent to England at an early age, she was later joined by her parents, who in 1835 bought Stanmore Hall at Great Stanmore, Middlesex. On 18 March 1840 she married at Great Stanmore <a name="cosubject_61299"></a><span class="headword">Robert Hollond</span>  (1808&#150;1877)<span class="occ"></span>, Liberal MP for Hastings.<br>
<br>Of an Anglo-Indian background like herself, Robert Hollond was born in London on 5 January 1808, fourth son of William Hollond (<i>d</i>. 1836), a wealthy Bengal civil servant, and his wife, Harriet Pope. He graduated from Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, in 1831 and was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1834, but became absorbed by aeronautics and financed the <i>Great Nassau</i> balloon voyage from London to Weilburg on 7&#150;8 November 1836; undertaken with Charles Green and Thomas Monck Mason, this was logged by himself at the time, described scientifically in Mason's <span class="italic">Aeronautica</span> (1838) and more flippantly in R. H. Barham's <span class="italic">Ingoldsby Legends</span> (1840), and celebrated in a painting by John Hollins at the National Portrait Gallery. In 1837 Hollond was elected to parliament as a &#145;Reformer, pledged to support the ballot&#146;. During his fifteen years there he made only one speech (on balloon-conveyed projectiles) and uttered some sentences of protest when the cleanliness of Hastings was impugned, but both he and his wife became known as unsparing benefactors to local and national causes, including the welfare of children.<br>
<br>The Hollonds made a handsome pair, he dark and aristocratic in appearance, she tender-looking, with glossy brown hair and splendid large blue eyes. They resided chiefly at 63 Portland Place and counted W. M. Thackeray among their intimates, but after the revolution of 1848 they wintered increasingly in Paris, in the rue Basse-du-Rempart and later in the rue d'Astorg. Among their earliest French friends was Ary Scheffer, who painted a graceful portrait of Ellen (1852) and used her as a model for a copy (1854) of his <span class="italic">St Augustine and St Monica</span>; both pictures are in the National Gallery. Before the <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> of December 1851 Ellen Hollond had started to host gatherings of democratic figures such as Odilon Barrot and Charles de R&eacute;musat who, together with other eminent if disparate representatives of the &#145;ligue lib&eacute;rale&#146;, including Pr&eacute;vost-Paradol, Lanfrey, Mignet, Laboulaye, Dufaure, and the Catholic but Stanmore-born comte de Montalembert, later formed in her salon a tacit opposition to Napoleon III, the common ground of which, according to her obituarist Edmond de Pressens&eacute;, was &#145;love of freedom and hatred of empire&#146;.<br>
<br>Another distinguished guest was the philosopher Victor Cousin, who delighted in Ellen Hollond's company at Cannes, where Robert purchased in 1864 the pretty Villa Allegria, with a magnificent sea view, to enjoy the winter seasons and rest Mrs Hollond's weak constitution. There too she secured her greatest prize, Prosper M&eacute;rim&eacute;e. Though at first suspicious of this bluestocking with Britannic prejudices, he came to respect her mind and warmly admired her books. The first two of these had appeared anonymously in Paris. In <span class="italic">Channing: sa vie et ses oeuvres</span> (1857) she presented the views of the Unitarian philosopher with an ecumenical intent seen also in the chatty but charming <span class="italic">La vie de village en Angleterre, ou, Souvenirs d'un exil&eacute;</span> (1862), which eulogized various aspects of protestant English life, including cricket. Under her own name she published in London in 1864 <span class="italic">A Lady's Journal of her Travels in Egypt and Nubia</span>, and in Paris in 1870 <span class="italic">Les Quakers</span>, a short but well-written plea for religious tolerance.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Robert Hollond, whose great wealth permitted the childless couple to commute among five desirable addresses, to buy paintings including a Boucher, and to entertain on an unusually grand scale, was perplexed by the conversation in his drawing-room and kept to himself and his whisky. He is said to have had little French; where English could be spoken, participation was easier. This would have been so in the quiet, Anglophile Paris home of the &eacute;migr&eacute; Russian historian Nikolay Turgenev, where the Hollonds met the novelist Ivan Turgenev, or even in the more famous salon of Julius and Mary Mohl, which Mrs Hollond had to some extent been emulating. Mary Mohl herself was quite attached to her, but felt uncomfortable at her receptions as French politics always predominated. Less sympathetic critics attacked Mrs Hollond's taste for the new and fashionable, saying that she used her beauty and charm to attract anyone with talent or a name. It is true that, unlike Mary Mohl, she was an informed listener rather than a compelling conversationalist, but she doubtless preferred brilliant minds to speak to each other rather than to herself. Moreover, her generosity was never in question, and received its best practical expression in the home that she founded for English nurses at Cannes.<br>
<br>In 1877 Robert Hollond was taken ill while they were staying at the Turgenevs' at 97 rue de Lille, Paris, and he died there on 26 December; he was buried at Great Stanmore on 3 January 1878 in the imposing family mausoleum that he had built in the ruins of the old church. He left most of his estate of some &pound;350,000 to or for the lifetime use of his widow, including properties in Devon and the south of France, the lease of 1 Upper Berkeley Street, and Stanmore Hall, which he had acquired in 1847. In broken health and aged beyond her years, Ellen Hollond retained Villa Allegria but spent the warmer months at Wonham in Devon or at Stanmore Hall, where she died from pneumonia on 29 November 1884; she was buried at Great Stanmore on 5 December. From her estate of some &pound;60,000 she left benefactions for this parish which she loved and for her dozen servants, as well as &pound;5000 to continue her work of providing English nurses for invalids in France.<br>
