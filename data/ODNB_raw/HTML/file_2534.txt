<span class="headword">Blackstone,  John</span>  (1712&#150;1753), <span class="occ">apothecary and botanist</span>, was born at Harefield, Middlesex, the eldest of three sons of Edward Blackstone (<i>d</i>. 1730), ironmonger and citizen of London, and his wife, Sarah, daughter of Francis Ashby of Brakspeare, Harefield. In 1729 he was apprenticed to Thomas Bearcroft, apothecary in the Strand, Westminster. Following his father's death, his mother took her younger sons to live in Harefield; Blackstone spent his holidays there, became interested in the local flora, and from 1734 began to discover new species.<br>
<br>Blackstone's paternal grandfather, John Blackstone (1650&#150;1712), prominent in the Society of Apothecaries and a benefactor of St Bartholomew's Hospital, had been a friend of Sir Hans Sloane and this probably encouraged the young man to begin corresponding with Sloane, J. J. Dillenius, Isaac Rand, and other eminent botanists. Apart from these letters, he apparently worked alone. Convalescence from an illness during the summer of 1736 kept him at Harefield, enabling further discoveries. Another spell of illness in 1737 forwarded his work, and that year he published his <span class="italic">Fasciculus plantarum circa Harefield sponte nascentium</span>. It was a small catalogue in alphabetical order, with synonyms taken from other authors, giving the locations, times of flowering, and other details, of 527 local plants, supported by a general description of the soils, aspects, and drainage. It is valuable as the first example of a complete enumeration of a small district, probably 16 to 20 square miles, and as such was much imitated by later collectors.<br>
<br>After completing his apprenticeship Blackstone stayed at Charlbury, Oxfordshire, with his uncle John Blackstone, keeper of Wychwood forest, where he compiled a catalogue of local plants. He then went to Essex, where another uncle owned property; there he extended his interest to mycology as autumn drew on.<br>
<br>Blackstone was made free of the Society of Apothecaries in 1738 and established his own business in Fleet Street, London. On 16 February 1740 he married a widow, Elizabeth Webb, but she died later that year. In October 1742 he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1801), daughter of Richard Abbott, of the Painter&#150;Stainers' Company. Their first daughter (<i>b</i>. 1744) died in infancy; a second, Sophia (1748&#150;1827), survived him.<br>
<br>Friendship with the Yorkshireman Ambrose Dawson, physician at St George's Hospital, probably led Blackstone to visit the north of England. Mary Blackstone inherited &pound;500 from her father and this was spent on acquiring property in Harefield. Blackstone gathered his knowledge of 366 rare and local species within England into his <span class="italic">Specimen botanicum quo plantarum plurium rariorum Angliae indigenarum loci naturales illustrantur</span> (1746), intending to follow this with a second volume. This was the last book published in England on indigenous botany to be based on the classification system of John Ray before that of Linnaeus came into universal favour. Blackstone was beset by failing health and died at Harefield on 11 March 1753. He was buried there, near his parents, on 18 March. Some of his own books were bought by Thomas Birch, secretary of the Royal Society, and later went into the British Library with Birch's bequest. His name was perpetuated in the genus <i>Blackstonia</i>.<br>
