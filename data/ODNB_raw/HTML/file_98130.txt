<span class="headword">Ryan,  Sarah</span>  (1724&#150;1768), <span class="occ">Methodist preacher</span>, was born on 20 October 1724, though the place of her birth and the identity of her parents are unknown. She was one of six children and at the time of her birth the family lived in &#145;comfort &hellip; [and] plenty&#146;  (&#145;Life&#146;, 3). However, a combination of her father's drinking and bad business decisions forced her into domestic service at the age of ten. In her twenties her life was dominated by a series of unhappy marriages, poverty, and debt. Her first husband was a bigamist, whom she met while helping her mother to run a shop. In the years that followed she simultaneously &#145;married&#146; Mr Ryan, an Irish Roman Catholic trader who was frequently away at sea, and Solomon Benneken, an Italian Jew. The marriage to Ryan was abusive, and she later recalled his &#145;barbarous treatment&#146;  (ibid., 26) and her struggles to pay the couple's debts by taking in washing and needlework, before once more going into service.<br>
<br>Sarah Ryan's introduction to Methodism took place about 1754, when she heard John Wesley preach and felt that &#145;all the time something said in my heart &#147;this is the truth I shall live &amp; die by it&#148;&#146;  (&#145;Life&#146;, 36). She attended Spitalfields Chapel, London, with the influential Methodist preacher Sarah Crosby, and in the mid-1750s she lived with Crosby in lodgings in Moorfields. In 1757 Ryan was appointed by Wesley as housekeeper at the New Room in Bristol, with some responsibility for overseeing Kingswood School. She commented to Wesley, &#145;I have considered well your proposal, and it appears to me to be the will of God which my soul desires to do&#146;  (diary, 3). It was a controversial appointment, given Ryan's past and her lack of experience and education. But her success in the role was evident, as Wesley observed that, under Ryan's care, Kingswood was &#145;a blessing to all that are therein and an honour to the whole body of Methodists&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal</span>, 4.247). Wesley's readiness to overlook Ryan's past was consistent with the intimacy of their relationship, exemplified by his comment that &#145;I cannot think of you without thinking of God. Others often lead me to Him; but it is, as it were, going round about: you bring me straight into His presence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 4.4). Their correspondence is remarkable for the equality of their exchange on spiritual matters. Wesley published a number of these letters in the <span class="italic">Arminian Magazine</span> (1781&#150;2), implicitly establishing Ryan as a model of Christian life. Nonetheless, Ryan's past did present problems, particularly within the Wesleys' turbulent marriage. At a Methodist conference in Bristol, while Ryan was serving dinner to some seventy preachers, Mary Wesley allegedly called out &#145;see that whore, who is serving you! She hath three Husbands now alive&#146;  (Fletcher, &#145;Further account&#146;, 35).<br>
<br>Ryan left Bristol in 1762 due to ill health, and began her association with Mary Bosanquet (later Fletcher), which would shape the rest of her life. In 1763 they established an orphanage at The Cedars, Leytonstone, Essex, using Bosanquet's legacy from her grandmother. Sarah (Sally) Lawrence, Ryan's four-year-old orphaned niece, came with them and continued to live with Bosanquet until her death in 1800, becoming an influential Methodist class leader in her own right. In five years the orphanage housed thirty-five children and thirty-four adults (including the preacher Sarah Crosby) and was modelled on Kingswood School, educating the children in literacy, religion, and domestic tasks. Despite hostility from the local community and growing financial pressures, the women also established regular Methodist meetings. After preaching at Leytonstone, Wesley commented &#145;Oh what a house of God is here! Not only for decency and order, but for the life and power of religion! I am afraid there are very few such to be found in all the King's dominions&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal</span>, 5.195). Bosanquet later recorded in her autobiography that Ryan was the &#145;main spring &hellip; in all the active part of this undertaking&#146;  (autobiography, pt 2, 26). By 1768 Ryan was in poor health and the community was struggling financially. The family relocated to Cross Hall, Yorkshire, but Ryan did not live to see the community re-established and died in rented lodgings in Gildersome, near Morley, on 17 August 1768. She was buried in the churchyard of Leeds Old Church.<br>
<br>Following her death Ryan's spiritual life was documented in fragments in the <span class="italic">Arminian Magazine</span>, including passages from her life, a selection of correspondence, and extracts from her diary. Her unorthodox personal life was edited out of these histories, though her reputation as &#145;a thoughtless, flirting trigamist&#146;  (Tyerman, 2.289) has been persistent. Nonetheless, the account of her life dictated to Bosanquet in 1767 both fleshes out her history and provides rare access to the subjective spiritual experience of an eighteenth-century woman preacher.<br>
