<span class="headword">Melville,  Andrew</span>  (1545&#150;1622), <span class="occ">university principal and theologian</span>, was born at Baldovy, near Montrose, Angus, on 1 August 1545, the youngest of nine sons of Richard Melville of Baldovy (<i>d</i>. 1547) and Giles Abercrombie, daughter of a burgess in Montrose. Andrew's eldest brother, Richard, who inherited the family's estate, studied at the Lutheran University of Greifswald, where he matriculated in 1546; as tutor to James Erskine, the laird of Dun's son, he accompanied the latter to Wittenberg, where they studied for two years under Philip Melanchthon before proceeding to Copenhagen and meeting John Macalpine, who taught theology in the university there. By 1560 Richard was authorized by the general assembly of the kirk in Scotland to undertake service in the reformed church, and he became minister of the neighbouring parish of Maryton. Of the other brothers, Thomas visited France and Italy, became a civil servant, and attained high office; Walter settled in Montrose and was a magistrate; Roger became a burgess of Dundee; James became minister of Arbroath; John served as minister of Crail; and Robert and David both became craftsmen.<h2>
<a name="Education"></a>Education</h2>Brought up by his brother Richard, Andrew Melville attended Montrose grammar school, where Thomas Anderson was schoolmaster. According to his nephew, Andrew was a &#145;seiklie tender boy&#146; who &#145;tuk pleasur in na thing sa mikle as his buik&#146;. He remained in Montrose for a further &#145;year or twa&#146;, at his own expense, to be taught &#145;the Greek grammar and something of that language&#146; by the Frenchman Pierre de Marsiliers, whom the reforming provost, John Erskine of Dun, had attracted to the burgh  (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Diary</span>, 39). In 1559 he enrolled at St Mary's College in St Andrews University and was befriended by its provost, John Douglas, who conformed at the Reformation and contributed in 1560 to the reformers' <span class="roman">Book of Discipline</span>. Among his fellow students in the class of 1559&#150;60 was James Lawson, who eventually aspired to the presbyterian leadership as Knox's chosen successor as minister in Edinburgh. After he had &#145;past his cuirse&#146; and graduated MA probably in 1563, with the reputation of being &#145;the best philosopher, poet, and Grecian, of anie young maister in the land&#146;  (ibid., 39), Melville sailed first to England and then to France. He visited Bordeaux and Dieppe before finally reaching Paris, &#145;whar he remeanit in the Universitie twa yeiris at his awin studies&#146;  (ibid., 39&#150;40).<br>
<br>In Paris, Melville attended the public lectures given in the Coll&egrave;ge de France, the royal trilingual college founded by Fran&ccedil;ois I in 1530, primarily for the study of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. He heard Jean Mercier and Jean de Cinquarbres on Hebrew; Pierre de la Ram&eacute;e (Peter Ramus), the great critic of Aristotelianism, and his great opponent Adrien Turn&egrave;be, on Greek and Latin philosophy; Pierre Forcadel, Jacques Charpentier, and Pascal Duhamel on mathematics; and Louis Duret on medicine. He also heard the Italian protestant scholar Joseph Justus Scaliger on Hebrew and Fran&ccedil;ois Baudouin on law. By 1566 Melville had decided to further his legal studies by proceeding to Poitiers, a Roman Catholic town held by the duke of Guise and besieged by protestant forces under Admiral Coligny, where he tutored privately and taught in the university for three years.<br>
<br>In 1569 the religious wars led Melville to seek refuge in Geneva, where his kinsman Henry Scrimgeour was a professor of law. Melville travelled on foot, &#145;as he haid done befor from Deipe to Paris, and from that to Poicteors&#146; and &#145;caried na thing with him bot a litle Hebrew <span class="roman">Byble</span> in his belt&#146;, to study theology, &#145;wherto he was dedicat from his mother's wombe&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Diary</span>, 40&#150;41). He did, however, take letters of introduction to Theodore Beza. He attended Beza's &#145;daylie lessons and preatchings&#146; and made divinity &#145;his cheiff studie&#146;  (ibid., 42). At Geneva he gained a knowledge of the Chaldaic and Syriac tongues from Bertram, the professor of Hebrew, and Beza secured his appointment in November 1569 to teach Latin in the <i>coll&egrave;ge</i>. Melville was bold enough to question the pronunciation of Portus, the professor of Greek, probably following the new pronunciation of the language fostered by Ramus in Paris.<br>
<br>Also resident in Geneva by 1571 were two future leaders of English presbyterianism, Thomas Cartwright and Walter Travers, the latter of whom produced during his Genevan stay his <span class="italic">Ecclesiasticae disciplinae &hellip; explicatio</span> (1574). Melville's interest in the work was such that he later presented a copy of the treatise to a fellow Calvinist, Alexander Arbuthnot, principal of King's College, Aberdeen. Following the influx of further Huguenot exiles to Geneva after the massacre of St Bartholomew's day in 1572, Melville had the opportunity to hear Fran&ccedil;ois Hotman, the French lawyer and political theorist, whose <span class="italic">Franco-Gallia</span> (1573) reasserted the ultimate sovereignty of the people over their king. He also maintained a lasting friendship with another exile from France, Joseph Scaliger, who taught philosophy. In 1570 Melville heard Ramus lecture on Cicero and followed him to Lausanne to attend his lectures in July the same year. Ramus then returned to Paris, and Melville went back to Geneva.<h2>
<a name="ReturntoScotlandanduniversityreformatGlasgow"></a>Return to Scotland and university reform at Glasgow</h2>Persuaded by his fellow countrymen to go home, so that his native land might benefit from the services of a distinguished scholar at a politically critical time, Melville left Geneva in April 1574 after five years' residence. He travelled in the company of Alexander Campbell, titular bishop of Brechin, and Andrew Polwarth, later minister at Paisley. In Paris he engaged in debates at the Jesuit college, where the archbishop of Glasgow, then resident, made &#145;sum minassing speitches&#146;; aware of the dangers, he made for Dieppe  (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Diary</span>, 44). After spending some time in London he arrived home in July with testimonials from Beza, as moderator of the Venerable Company of Pastors, and from Jean Pinaud, rector of the <i>coll&egrave;ge</i>, in which they warmly praised his abilities and recommended him to the Scottish church. According to Melville's nephew, Beza considered that &#145;the graittest taken of affection the Kirk of Genev could schaw to Scotland&#146; was &#145;that they had suffered tham selves to be spuiled of Mr Andro Melvill, wherby the Kirk of Scotland might be inritched&#146;  (ibid., 42&#150;3).<br>
<br>From Edinburgh, Melville set out for Baldovy, where he sought &#145;to repose a whyll with his frinds&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Diary</span>, 45) and tutored his nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18547/', "James Melville (1556&#150;1614)")</script>. News of his return resulted in competition for his services, but as he &#145;lyked nocht to be in Court bot rather to be in sum Universitie&#146;  (ibid.), he declined the offer to become court chaplain to the regent, James Douglas, fourth earl of Morton. His candidature as principal of St Mary's College in St Andrews, in succession to John Douglas, the archbishop, who had died in July, was canvassed in the general assembly in August 1574. In the end, however, he accepted the invitation to become principal of Glasgow University at the behest of Archbishop Boyd, the university chancellor, and Andrew Hay, university rector and commissioner of churches in the west. Before taking up his appointment, which took effect in November 1574, Melville visited Stirling where he &#145;conferrit at leynthe&#146; with George Buchanan, then tutor to King James, and met the young king, &#145;the sweitest sight in Europe that day, for strange and extraordinar gifts of ingyne, judgment, memorie and langage&#146;  (ibid., 48).<br>
<br>Once installed in Glasgow, Melville set about revitalizing teaching. As an admirer of the anti-scholastic philosophy of Ramus, he introduced Ramist texts in logic, rhetoric, geometry, and arithmetic, and initiated specialist teaching in place of the outmoded practice of regenting, the system of conducting students through their entire course of study. Greek, Hebrew, and the unfamiliar Syriac and Chaldaic languages, necessary for scholarly biblical exegesis, took their place in the curriculum alongside classes in history, geography, and astronomy, but not metaphysics, which was discarded as unprofitable.<br>
<br>Melville's emphasis was on the <i>studia humanitatis</i>, the liberal arts, and epitomized the new humanist values designed to replace the old scholasticism. At table after meals in college, he was apt to demonstrate informally how &#145;Aristotle could err and haid erred&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Diary</span>, 67). His drastic reconstitution of the curriculum and a realistic benefaction by King James in 1577 strengthened Glasgow's reputation, and soon St Andrews and Aberdeen universities, followed by the town college in Edinburgh, adopted features of his successful experiment in Glasgow.<h2>
<a name="Reforminthechurch"></a>Reform in the church</h2>As theology professor and biblical scholar Melville also exercised a powerful influence within the church, which stood in the tradition of the &#145;best reformed churches&#146; on the continent. Unlike the universities, the church had experienced a thorough reformation on Calvinistic lines. After his homecoming Melville attended meetings of the general assembly and, by applying Reformation principles, sought to correct perceived defects in the church's operation. He offered attractive solutions to outstanding problems and was keen to integrate the universities more fully in the wider work of the reformed church. He saw himself as holding the ecclesiastical office of doctor, which according to Calvin was one of the four essential offices in the church, and with a seat in church courts he saw it as his duty to interpret scripture aright by applying the tools of philology to exegesis. He also lent his support to the general assembly's determination to resist Regent Morton's policy of conforming the Scottish church with that of England.<br>
<br>When appointed by the general assembly in 1575 to two committees for examining the aptitude of the bishop of Moray and the bishop-elect of Dunblane, Melville seems to have expressed no disapproval of the episcopal office. He was concerned not with ending episcopacy but with recommending how the examination and election of bishops could be made more effective. His attitude to bishops was based at least as much on observation and experience of Scottish practice as on any doctrinaire argument inherited from Geneva. Yet his introduction to the episcopate through the bishops of Moray and Dunblane, two improper promotions criticized by the assembly as neither had first served as a minister, provided Melville with ample ammunition when prevailing dissatisfaction over episcopal appointments led to a critical appraisal of bishops &#145;as they are now in the Kirk of Scotland&#146;.<br>
<br>In the assembly of 1575 Melville is said to have supported opponents of the Leith episcopacy by illustrating how the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> bishop was &#145;not to be taken in the sense that the common sort did conceive, there being no superiority allowed by Christ among ministers&#146;  (Spottiswoode, 2.200). He affirmed (as Beza had earlier warned John Knox) that the church could not remain in purity unless the corruption that had crept into the estate of bishops was completely removed. The assembly certainly appointed him to a committee to debate whether diocesan episcopacy had scriptural validity and whether the electoral chapter could be tolerated in a reformed church. The committee's verdict was that the name &#145;bishop&#146; was applicable to all ministers of the word and sacraments, though some might still be chosen to act as visitors while retaining their congregational charges. Melville's nephew claimed that ministers were &#145;informed mair throwlie be Mr Andro of the unlawfulnes of Bischopes, and the right maner of governing of the Kirk be Presbyteries&#146;, which suggests that his uncle's ideas were already shared by others, and Andrew Hay is named as one minister &#145;wha lyked never those bischopries and wha specialie was the ernest suttar for Mr Andro Melvill&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Diary</span>, 48, 56).<br>
<br>The arguments advanced by Melville and his colleagues, so familiar to readers of Calvin's <span class="italic">Institutes</span>, seem to have been that the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> bishop was not a great diocesan prelate who sat in parliament and council, the &#145;lord-like bishop&#146; for whom Knox had shown such distaste, but rather an overseer and shepherd of the flock. Melville was determined to ensure that power continued to lie with assemblies of the church, which Regent Morton's policy threatened to subvert, and not with a new order of bishops. He was a member of the assembly's committee of more than thirty members charged with preparing the second <span class="roman">Book of Discipline</span> (1578). Of his &#145;exceiding grait peans&#146; in regularly &#145;keiping Assemblies and dyettes of conference, reasoning and advysing with brethring anent that wark&#146;, there is sufficient testimony  (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Diary</span>, 52); yet he was not the chief author, and even his admiring nephew assigned no greater role to him than to the other participants. Nevertheless, the whole thrust of the programme outlined in the second <span class="roman">Book of Discipline</span> was entirely consistent with Melville's ideas.<br>
<br>Melville was elected moderator of the general assembly in April 1578, which ratified the presbyterian polity of the second <span class="roman">Book of Discipline</span>; and his prominence in the councils of the church led to his re-election as moderator of the assembly in April 1582, his retention in June 1582, re-election in June 1587 and May 1594, and election to a convention in January 1590. The spiritual jurisdiction and government granted to the church by God through Christ the mediator was understood to be exercised not by the membership at large but by those appointed by the Word to specialized functions within the congregation of the faithful. The church was not deemed to have received its jurisdiction from God intermediately through the prince, as was claimed in England. Any notion of intermediate, earthly headship of the church, either papal or princely, was denounced as &#145;ane title falslie usurpit be antichryst&#146;, which &#145;aucht not to be attributtit to angell or to mane of quhat estait soevir he be, saiffing to Chryst, the heid and onlie monarche in this kirk&#146;  (second <span class="roman">Book of Discipline</span>, 167). The prince and civil magistrate, as members of the church, ought to be willing to hear God's word revealed through his messengers and ambassadors, the ministers of the word, and so &#145;reverence the majestie of the sone of God speiking be thame&#146;  (ibid., 216). From doctrine, discipline, and distribution, there arose a fourfold permanent order of ministers or bishops, doctors or teachers, elders or governors, and deacons or distributors of the church's revenues. The office bearers were responsible for governing the church through a series of councils from congregational elderships to the general assembly, and were empowered to convene without tarrying for the magistrate's permission. All of this, however, amounted to little other than a succinct summary of earlier strands of Reformation thought, which it was deemed advisable to restate and reinforce, at a point when the crown sought to dictate policy and control the church through its bishops.<h2>
<a name="StMarysCollege"></a>St Mary's College</h2>His nephew James attributed Melville's negligible published output to his &#145;grait occupationes and distractiones&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Diary</span>, 63) in promoting the work of the ministry and schools. This received a fresh stimulus in 1580 with Melville's appointment at St Andrews University as principal of St Mary's College, reconstituted as a divinity college after the university's reorganization in 1579. Melville himself had been an early advocate of establishing &#145;an anti-seminarie to be erected in St Androis to the Jesuit seminaries for the course of theologie&#146;  (ibid., 76), and had tried, without success, to secure the services of his Geneva acquaintances Thomas Cartwright and Walter Travers as theology professors for St Andrews.<br>
<br>Leaving Glasgow &#145;sear against his will&#146;, Melville saw his work in St Andrews as professing the &#145;learned tongues and theologie against the seminaries of Rems and Rome&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Diary</span>, 83). Yet he soon encountered opposition to his reforms from more conservative colleagues. The course he devised was an expansion of his theology course at Glasgow, based on an intensive study of the tongues and biblical exegesis. He resisted the influence of scholastic philosophy on theology and in 1583 helped to secure the general assembly's condemnation of those aspects of Aristotle's &#145;doctrine directlie impugning the grounds of religioun&#146;  (Thomson, pt 2, 640&#150;41). Favouring Ramus's anti-metaphysical approach, which offered clarity and order in analyses of scripture, Melville saw the biblical text as &#145;perfect, clear in itself, its own interpreter&#146; and &#145;the supreme judge of all controversies&#146;  (<span class="italic">Scholastica diatriba de rebus divinis</span>, 1599). But within a year of his arrival his opponents attempted to fight a rearguard action. If Ramus were right and Aristotle wrong, the implications were clear enough to Melville's opponents: &#145;thair breadwinner, thair honour, thair estimation, all was gean, giff Aristotle sould be sa owir-harled in the heiring of thair schollars; and sa dressit publict orationes against Mr Androe's doctrine&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Diary</span>, 123&#150;4). The same domineering attitude which he had displayed at Glasgow was brought to bear at St Andrews, where &#145;Mr Andro insisted mightelie&#146; against the exponents of the old scholastic philosophy &#145;in his ordinar lessones&#146; until they finally &#145;acknawlagit a wounderfull transportation out of darkness unto light&#146;. Despite &#145;mikle feghting and fascherie&#146;, he made his views prevail  (ibid.), and for three decades he remained the dominant figure in Scottish theological education.<br>
<br>In St Andrews, Melville also sat as an elder on the kirk session for several years and, on occasion, preached from the pulpit of Holy Trinity parish church. He took part in the general assembly's proceedings against Patrick Adamson and Robert Montgomerie, the recalcitrant archbishops of St Andrews and Glasgow, and was chosen to help with the work of establishing presbyteries in east Fife. In an address to the assembly of which he was moderator in 1582, he condemned the crown's exercise of that &#145;absolute authoritie whereby men intended to pull the crown off Christ's head and to wring the sceptre out of his hand&#146;  (Calderwood, 3.622). As a leading presbyterian he was of considerable interest to English diplomats in Scotland: Stephan Pole, a student at St Andrews, acted as informant to the English envoy, from whom he received &pound;50 for his services.<h2>
<a name="PoliticalconfrontationandexileinEngland"></a>Political confrontation and exile in England</h2>Following the rise to power of James Stewart, earl of Arran, and the inauguration of an administration which was hostile to the presbyterians, in 1584 Melville was summoned to appear before the privy council for uttering in a sermon on <span class="roman">Daniel</span> allegedly seditious and treasonable speeches from the pulpit, in which he was said to have compared the king to Nebuchadnezzar. Taking with him testimonials in his favour from the staff of St Andrews University, he denied the charge and affirmed subjects' duty to obey the king whom &#145;God in his mercie hath placed lawfull king and supreme magistrat in the civill government of this countrie&#146;  (Calderwood, 4.4), but declined the privy council's jurisdiction in matters of doctrine and &#145;planlie tauld the King and Counsall that they presumed ower bauldlie&#146; to &#145;judge the doctrin and controll the ambassators and messingers of a King and Counsall graitter nor they, and far above tham&#146;. Unfastening his little Hebrew <span class="roman">Bible</span> from his belt, he clanked it down on the table before the king and chancellor, declaring that this was his warrant, for &#145;with all ernestnes, zeall and gravitie, I stand for the cause of Jesus Chryst and his Kirk&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Diary</span>, 142).<br>
<br>When charged to enter ward in Blackness Castle, Melville took flight with his brother Roger and sought refuge in England, where others had also fled for safety. With his departure from St Andrews, along with &#145;ane number of maisters and regentis thairof&#146;, the government declared the principalship of St Mary's vacant and proceeded to appoint John Robertson as Melville's successor. From the safety of Berwick, Melville contemplated resuming his academic life on the continent and as a preliminary went to London, where in June 1584 with other exiles he had an interview with the secretary of state Sir Francis Walsingham. In July he visited Oxford and Cambridge universities, where he &#145;conferrit with the most godlie and lernit ther&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Diary</span>, 219). At Oxford the debate concerned the contentious issue of whether the minister in exercising his office need tarry for the civil magistrate. In London puritan ministers conferred with Melville and the Scottish exiles about creating a presbyterian polity.<br>
<br>To counteract the effect of propaganda by Patrick Adamson, archbishop of St Andrews, directed to the reformed churches abroad, Melville wrote on 1 July 1584 to the churches of Geneva and Z&uuml;rich with his version of events in Scotland. He was also able to lecture in the chapel of the Tower of London, which was exempt from the bishop of London's jurisdiction. In October he attended the funeral in London of James Lawson, the exiled minister of Edinburgh. In November 1585 he joined the banished lords in returning home as Arran's administration collapsed.<h2>
<a name="ClasheswithJamesVI"></a>Clashes with James VI</h2>From 1586 presbyterianism made headway again, and Melville urged ministers to unite in opposing the <span class="roman">Black Acts</span> of 1584, legislation which had asserted the crown's supremacy and the authority of bishops and had deprived the church of free assemblies. Unable to return to St Andrews, where plague had broken out, Melville spent the winter in Glasgow and was invited to visit the university which he called &#145;his eldest bern&#146;. In March 1586 he resumed teaching at St Andrews, but in May, on being summoned to court, he was informed by the king, displeased by his continued opposition to Archbishop Adamson, that his services in the university would be dispensed for a season and that he would be warded at Baldovy until such time as James would recall him. When the university petitioned for Melville's return, James relented, providing Adamson were treated &#145;reverendlie&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Diary</span>, 251).<br>
<br>Forbidden by the king in 1587 from preaching to the people in English on Sundays, Melville further angered James VI in 1592 by defending the views of John Knox and George Buchanan, who had &#145;sett the crowne upon his head&#146;. James considered them defensible only by &#145;traterous and seditious theologues&#146;, and asserted that he had received his crown &#145;by successioun and not by anie man&#146;. This led Melville to deliver to the king &#145;a maiste scharpe and frie admonition concerning his evil thinking and speaking of the best frinds of Chryst and him selff&#146;. In 1593 he also &#145;gave the king a sharpe reprooffe for his favour borne to Papists&#146;, especially to the earl of Huntly  (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Diary</span>, 313), and when the king marched north with an army to secure the submission of Huntly and the northern earls Melville accompanied him.<br>
<br>Melville had attended the coronation of Anne of Denmark in May 1590 and, much to the king's satisfaction, contributed an oration in Latin verse for the occasion, printed as <span class="italic">Stephaniskion</span> by Waldegrave, at the king's request. Both Joseph Scaliger and Justus Lipsius congratulated him, as copies of the work &#145;past throw all Europe&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Diary</span>, 279). Melville penned a further poem in 1594 to mark the birth of James's son and heir, Prince Henry, who he predicted would unite the crowns of Scotland and England and humble the pride of Spain and Rome.<br>
<br>In 1594 Melville was suspected by the king, apparently without foundation, of favouring the earl of Bothwell, when the latter for a time supported presbyterian objections to the king's leniency towards Huntly. In 1595, and again in 1596, he made his famous &#145;two kingdoms&#146; speech on the separate nature of the ecclesiastical and civil jurisdictions. At Falkland Palace he sharply reminded the king that he was &#145;God's sillie vassall&#146;. There were two kings and two kingdoms in Scotland with overlapping spheres: the kingdom of &#145;Chryst Jesus the King&#146; was the kirk, &#145;whase subject King James the Saxt is&#146;, and in that realm there were no lords or heads, but only members. Those who had a special commission from Christ &#145;to watch over his Kirk and governe his spirituall kingdome&#146;, that is, ordained ministers, &#145;hes sufficient powar of him, and authoritie sa to do, bathe togidder and severallie; the quhilk na Christian King nor Prince sould controll and discharge, but fortifie and assist, utherwayes nocht fathfull subjects nor members of Chryst&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Diary</span>, 370).<br>
<br>Excluded by the king from attending presbyteries, in 1597 Melville was also deprived of his office as rector of St Andrews University, though in 1599 he still remained dean of the faculty of divinity. Opposed to ecclesiastical representation in parliament, he was ordered by the king to leave the general assembly meeting at Dundee in 1598; and though commissioned by his presbytery to attend, he was again forbidden by the king from participating in the Montrose assembly of 1600. In vain he protested that &#145;he had a calling in the Kirk of God, and of Jesus Chryst, the King of kings, quhilk he behovit to dischairge at all occasiounes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Diary</span>, 542). In 1602 he was warded in his college for making the exercise on the text <span class="roman">Ephesians</span> 5: 11 and touching upon &#145;the present corruptions of the kirk&#146;  (ibid., 545). Yet he welcomed James's accession to the English throne in 1603, which he celebrated in verse, and favoured a legislative union of the two kingdoms.<h2>
<a name="Englandandfinalexile"></a>England and final exile</h2>After James suspended meetings of the general assembly in 1604, the following year Melville and others made a stand and held an assembly at Aberdeen in defiance of the king, who resorted to severe measures against the ringleaders. In 1606, after heading the list of forty-two signatories to a protest against episcopacy, Melville was summoned to London. He arrived by the end of August, and in meetings with the king at Hampton Court during September he defended the freedom of general assemblies and the meeting of the Aberdeen assembly. Accused by the English privy council in November of writing some verses &#145;tending to the scandall and dishonour of the Church of England&#146;, he admitted to &#145;being muche moved with indignatioun to see suche vanitie and superstitioun in a Christian church under a Christian king&#146;. Shaking the sleeves of the archbishop of Canterbury's rochet he branded them &#145;Romish ragis&#146;, a &#145;pairt of the beastis marke&#146;, and their wearer, Richard Bancroft, &#145;the capitall enemie of all the reformed kirks in Europ&#146;  (Calderwood, 6.597&#150;8). Melville also disapproved of the &#145;great superstitioun and vanitie&#146; displayed at court on St George's day and wrote some verses in Latin, translated as:<blockquote>
<div>Saint Andro, Chrystis Apostle trew,<br>
</div>
<div>Does sign the Scotismenes rites;<br>
</div>
<div>St George, Armenian Heresiarch,<br>
</div>
<div>The Inglischmenes delytis.<br>
</div>
<div>Let Scotismen, thane, hauld fast the faith!<br>
</div>
<div>That is holie Appostolicke,<br>
</div>
<div>Howbeit that Ingland keipes the cours<br>
</div>
<div>That Papistis Apostaticke.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Diary</span>, 706)</blockquote>Confined first in the house of the dean of St Paul's, Melville was finally committed to the Tower of London in April 1607. The principalship of St Mary's in St Andrews was then declared vacant. From the Tower he wrote a reply to George Downame's sermon in defence of episcopacy. His services as divinity professor were sought in vain by the protestant academy at La Rochelle. Melville was initially denied visitors and the use of writing materials, but after a year some relaxation was permitted through the intercession of Sir James Sempill of Beltrees. When his room was examined, its walls were found covered with verses which he had engraved with the tongue of his shoe buckle.<br>
<br>By 1608 Melville was persuaded to address some conciliatory verses to the king and an apologetic letter to the privy council, on the advice of Archbishop John Spottiswoode, once his student at Glasgow. In 1610 the English ambassador to France received a request from the protestant duc de Bouillon that James release Melville and allow him to become professor of biblical theology in the Huguenot enclave at Sedan. Released from the Tower in 1611 but forbidden to return to Scotland, he debated the merits of the post in Sedan. &#145;I am in a state of suspense as to the course which I ought to take. There is no room for me in Britain&#146;, he wrote, &#145;on account of pseudo-Episcopacy&#151;no hope of my being allowed to revisit my native country&#146;. He had pondered the thirty-six years of active life in Scotland and &#145;the idle life which I have been condemned to spend in prison&#146;, a miserable reward for all his efforts &#145;taken in connection with the disgraceful bondage of the Church and the base perfidy of men&#146;. The choice before him was an unpalatable one. &#145;Shall I fly from my native country, from my native Church, from my very self? Or, shall I deliver myself up, like a bound quadruped, to the will and pleasure of men?&#146;  (M'Crie, 314&#150;15). In the end he accepted the invitation and left for France on 19 April 1611.<br>
<br>At Sedan, Melville found himself in controversy with David Tilenus, his fellow professor of theology, a critic of Calvinism and inclined toward the views of Arminius. He showed sympathy, however, towards Johannes Piscator, a prominent Ramist and theologian at Herborn in the Rhine palatinate, whose teaching on the doctrine of justification caused considerable controversy in both France and Switzerland. Yet Melville remained resolute in his defence of the absolute decree of reprobation and was vigorous in his opposition to all who deviated in the direction of Arminianism. He died in Sedan, unmarried, in 1622.<br>
<br>As a champion of ecclesiastical independence and a redoubtable opponent of royal supremacy, Melville proved a worthy successor to John Knox in defending Reformation principles. Yet his intransigence, his explosive temper, and his unwillingness to compromise led to open conflict with King James who, taking up Melville's challenge, succeeded in outmanoeuvring him by remodelling the church to suit his own preferences along English lines. Beyond his contribution as presbyterian leader within the church, Melville exerted a powerful influence in revitalizing university education. In neither field did James VI manage to expunge his achievement. Although his published works were slender, his beliefs helped to shape the covenanting struggle in the seventeenth century. They also permeated thinking both within the presbyterian establishment after the revolution settlement in 1690 and within the ranks of presbyterian seceders in the eighteenth century.<br>
