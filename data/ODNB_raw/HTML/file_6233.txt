<span class="headword">Cooper,  Thomas Henry</span>  (1813&#150;1881), <span class="occ">surgeon and botanist</span>, was born in December 1813 at Lewes, Sussex, the second of four sons of Thomas Cooper, a solicitor in that town, and Lucy Elizabeth Durrant. He probably attended Lewes grammar school and at fifteen was apprenticed to a surgeon in Marylebone, Middlesex. He subsequently studied at the Middlesex Hospital and, from 1832, at University College, London, where he attended the botanical lectures of Lindley. Through the good offices of the latter he was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1834, the year in which he gained his licence to practise. He was married and had two daughters; the surname of his wife, Annie Elizabeth, who outlived him, is unknown.<br>
<br>Cooper's claim to notice is as the once-supposed author of useful early catalogues of the higher plants of Sussex and Nottinghamshire. The first of these was published as a seventeen page appendix to the second volume of T. W. Horsfield's <span class="italic">History, Antiquities, and Topography of the County of Sussex</span> (1835), and was notable for the unusual device of presenting the data in three successive ways: by habitats, topographically, and finally with the plant names arranged in the newly fashionable natural system, which had been ardently embraced by Lindley. A long list of records for the rarer species followed, seemingly on Cooper's own authority. Years later, however, it emerged that these had been lifted almost in their entirety (without clear acknowledgement) from a catalogue provided by William Borrer, a veteran Sussex botanist with a high reputation nationally.<br>
<br>Cooper treated another local expert, Dr Godfrey Hewitt, in just the same way during a brief spell in Nottingham a few months later. He was at that time seeking to impress his botanical seniors and obtain one of the few academic posts in the subject. He boldly sought to compete against Lindley for the professorship of botany at the Society of Apothecaries in 1835 but the best he was able to achieve, and that after some years, was lecturing at an agricultural school in Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire.<br>
<br>By that time botany was a mere prop to what had returned to an essentially medical career. That was to prove not undistinguished, culminating in Cooper's appointment as physician to the Great Western and Metropolitan railways and then election as FRCS. Perhaps significantly, though, all mention of his botanical past was suppressed from his entry in the professional directories. He spent his final years in Slough, where he died on 25 December 1881.<br>
