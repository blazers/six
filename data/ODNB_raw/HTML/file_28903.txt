<span class="headword">Way,  Albert</span>  (1805&#150;1874), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, born on 23 June 1805, in Bath, and baptized on 23 June 1807 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28905/', "Lewis Way (1772&#150;1840)")</script>, barrister, and Mary Drewe (1780&#150;1848). He was their third child of three sons and six daughters, but his two brothers and one sister died in infancy. Albert suffered from poor health throughout his life. He was privately educated at home in Stansted Park, Sussex, and at the age of seventeen travelled through Europe to Syria with his father. An accurate draughtsman, a good classical scholar, and a linguist with a knowledge of most European languages, Hebrew, and Old English, he matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1824, where he encouraged his contemporary Charles Darwin in insect collecting. He graduated BA in 1829 and proceeded MA in 1834. Like his father, he trained as a barrister and was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1833. However, by 1837 his interest had turned to the study of medieval antiquities; he contributed notes to the Norfolk volume of J. S. Cotman's <span class="italic">Engravings of Sepulchral Brasses in Norfolk and Suffolk</span> (1838), and he was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1839.<br>
<br>In 1840 Way's father died and he inherited sufficient wealth, later augmented by legacies from other relatives, to be able to live off his private income. His first sole publication was based on a paper read to the Society of Antiquaries in 1841 &#145;On an effigy of King Richard Coeur de Lion in the cathedral of Rouen&#146; (<span class="italic">Archaeologia</span>, 29, 1842); his next communication introduced the term palimpsest brasses to the English language (&#145;On palimpsest sepulchral brasses&#146;, <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span>, 30, 1844). In 1842 he was elected the society's director, responsible for its publications and possessions. The publishing of proceedings of meetings was started at his suggestion in 1844. The first volume of his principal work was issued in 1843, his edition of the English&#150;Latin dictionary <span class="italic">Promptorium parvulorum sive clericorum</span> (<i>c</i>.1440) by Geoffrey the grammarian (Camden Society, 25, 1843; 54, 1853; 89, 1865). Way donated many books to the society's library in his lifetime, and his collection of early dictionaries was later presented to the society by his widow. He helped Sir Samuel Meyrick revise his <span class="italic">A Critical Inquiry into Antient Armour</span> for the second enlarged edition of 1844 and contributed many drawings and notes to Henry Shaw's <span class="italic">Dress and Decoration of the Middle Ages</span> (1858). Way was meticulous in recording archaeological finds and historical sources but his interpretation of the evidence for the existence of the Pilgrims' Way in medieval times has been disputed.<br>
<br>As a moderately wealthy gentleman and learned amateur, Way appeared a traditional antiquary, but his interest in the collection, classification, and publication of antiquities made him an important figure in the movement towards a more scientific approach to archaeology. While director, he compiled a classified catalogue to the Society of Antiquaries' museum collections (published 1847) and his interest in medieval seals was aroused by the Prattinton seal casts bequeathed in 1841. He published many articles on the subject and assembled several thousand impressions, which his widow gave to the society to provide the foundation of the largest classified collection of British seal impressions.<br>
<br>Way purchased a country seat, Wonham Manor, Betchworth, Surrey, in 1840, and was appointed a JP in 1850 and deputy lieutenant for Surrey. On 30 April 1844 he married his cousin Emmeline Stanley (1809&#150;1906), youngest surviving daughter of John Thomas, first Lord Stanley of Alderley. Their only child, Mary Alithea, was born in 1850. He resigned the directorship of the Society of Antiquaries in 1846 because of the difficulty of attending evening meetings after he had given up his London residence; but by then he had become more involved in the (Royal) Archaeological Institute. This was established as a body distinct from the British Archaeological Association largely through his efforts and because of his disagreements with Thomas Wright and Charles Roach Smith. In his memoirs the latter paid tribute to Way's insufficiently acknowledged services to archaeology, but characterized him as extremely cautious.<br>
<br>Way and Smith were joint honorary secretaries to the original British Archaeological Association between 1843 and 1845, and Way was one of the honorary secretaries to the Archaeological Institute from 1845 to 1868; he organized many of the annual meetings and temporary exhibitions in different parts of the country. He saw the role of the institute as one of promoting the preservation of historic monuments throughout England and providing a forum for the exchange of new ideas. <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> claimed he did a great deal to encourage local archaeological societies whose formation had been prompted by the two national associations. He edited the <span class="italic">Archaeological Journal</span> for many of the first twenty-five years of its publication and contributed seventy-two articles to the first thirty volumes, mostly on medieval costume, jewellery, seals, and documents. With an up-to-date and extensive knowledge of most periods of British archaeology, Way enjoyed the friendship of and corresponded with many leading antiquaries throughout Europe. He was known for privately giving enthusiastic help to others engaged in research. His letters to Sir A. W. Franks and Sir F. Madden are in the British Museum and British Library respectively, and many others have survived. He was a strong advocate for developing the British collections and was a generous donor to the British Museum.<br>
<br>A man of strong religious principle but of moderate opinions within the Church of England, Way rebuilt the Marboeuf Chapel, founded in Paris by his father for English protestants. He travelled to France and Italy on several occasions for the sake of his health, and withdrew from active involvement with the Archaeological Institute in 1863, although he continued to help with the <span class="italic">Journal</span> until 1868. His health deteriorated before he could complete his major catalogue of the duke of Northumberland's antiquities at Alnwick Castle. He died after a lingering illness at Le Trouville, Cannes, on 23 March 1874 and was buried at Betchworth. His collections of prints and drawings were sold at Sothebys on 16 June 1875 and 3 April 1876 and his <i>objets d'art</i> in their sale of 27&#150;9 July 1908; books from his library were sold by Thomas Thorp in March 1907.<br>
