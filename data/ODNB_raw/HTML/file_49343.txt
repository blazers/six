<span class="headword">Holme,  Bryan</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1776, <em>d.</em> 1856), <span class="occ">lawyer and a founder of the Law Society</span>, was baptized on 29 December 1776 at Tunstall, near Lancaster, the son of William Holme and his wife, Elizabeth. He attended a school at nearby Wray and was articled in 1793 to John Baldwin, a solicitor in Lancaster. On admission in 1800 he worked in Lancaster for a short time before moving to London about 1803 where he entered the offices of Bleasdale and Alexander, solicitors of Hatton Court, Threadneedle Street, and New Inn. Bleasdale and Alexander was a well-established firm which acted for the London Assurance Corporation and the Hudson Bay Company. Holme began as a managing clerk, specializing in chancery work, but he soon became a partner in 1806. The following year he married Anne Simpson, a daughter of Samuel Simpson, shipowner and merchant of Lancaster. In 1810 Holme was elected a member of the Society of Gentlemen Practisers, an exclusive London-based solicitors' association, but he did not become involved in its activities.<br>
<br>By the early 1820s Holme had become the senior partner of the eminent firm of Holme, Frampton, and Loftus. In 1823 he emerged as the leading figure in the project to establish a permanent society for the solicitors' profession, to be called the Law Institution. Until this time the associations for solicitors had been confined either to the metropolis or to localities in the provinces. None had achieved a major impact on the profession as a whole. The Law Institution represented a new departure and an attempt to form a country-wide professional organization. A number of prospectuses were issued and subscriptions invited to raise a fund for the institution and the building of a hall and library. In 1825 meetings of the subscribers were held in London which led to the formation of the Law Institution. A committee of management, of which Holme was an original member, was appointed to put the scheme into effect. A site in Chancery Lane, at the heart of London's legal quarter, was purchased in 1828 for the construction of the hall, which was completed in 1832. In 1831 a royal charter was obtained and the institution became the Society of Attorneys, Solicitors, Proctors and others, not being Barristers, practising in the Courts of Law and Equity of the United Kingdom, or more simply, the Incorporated Law Society. The name was altered to the Law Society in 1906.<br>
<br>After his initial central role in the formation of the society, Holme played a less conspicuous part in its subsequent development. He became neither chairman of the committee of management nor president. However, he continued as a member of the committee of management (and later the council) until his death, and served on several subcommittees, particularly those which reflected his professional and personal interests, such as the library and chancery subcommittees. His role as the principal architect of the society was recognized in a resolution passed at the special general meeting for accepting the charter in January 1832, and was further celebrated by the raising of a subscription for a full-length portrait by Henry William Pickersgill which was hung in the society's hall in 1834.<br>
<br>Holme continued to practise and quietly pursued his interests in literature and book collecting. He presented many books to the society's library. Late in life, in 1854, he again became involved in professional matters, when plans for establishing a benevolent institution for the relief of aged and infirm London solicitors were broached. Holme was chairman of the provisional committee, but before matters could proceed beyond the circulation of a prospectus, his health declined and the scheme came to nought. Holme died at his residence in Brunswick Square, London, on 15 July 1856 of heart disease and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery. It is curious that his death passed largely unremarked by the Incorporated Law Society and the profession. He was survived by his wife.<br>
