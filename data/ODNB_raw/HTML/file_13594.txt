<span class="headword">Holmes,  James</span>  (1777&#150;1860), <span class="occ">miniature painter</span>, was &#145;born in a humble sphere of life&#146;, the son of a dealer in precious stones in Clerkenwell, London, who died when James was about seven  (Story, 3). At school he showed a talent for drawing, and a master gave him a copy of Aesop's fables, from which he copied woodcut illustrations. His mother, a Catholic, sent him to the Abb&eacute; de la Touz&eacute; to learn French, and had him apprenticed to the engraver R. M. Meadows, with whom he remained until he was twenty-one. Aged &#145;19&frac12;&#146; he entered the Royal Academy Schools on 19 March 1796 to study engraving. He engraved Richard Westall's <span class="italic">Storm in Harvest</span> and Sir Thomas Lawrence's portrait of the duke of Leeds. In 1800 he engraved in stipple a portrait of the radical author and bookseller Thomas Clio Rickman, after W. Hazlitt. He became friends with his fellow apprentice Thomas Heaphy and also with the painters Richard and William Westall, the engraver Luke Clennell, and the miniature painter Henry Richter, who showed him how to use small clay or wax models to arrange a composition and from whom he learned colouring techniques. In the early part of his career Holmes, who was a good draughtsman, assisted Richard Westall, whose works were then popular, with acquatints after his drawings, and worked especially on the heads of figures.<br>
<br>His apprenticeship completed, Holmes gave up engraving and turned to watercolour painting. He received several portrait commissions in Worcester, where he also taught drawing, for which he charged 1 and then 2 guineas an hour, and returned to London as a popular instructor in watercolour painting. As his miniatures gained in popularity he gave up teaching. He became a member of the Associated Artists in Water Colours and exhibited with them twenty-two works, of which six were portraits from 1808, until 1812, when the society was dissolved. At the last exhibition he showed <span class="italic">The Doubtful Shilling</span>, which was much admired and acquired for the duchess of York by Beau Brummell, with whom Holmes became friends. The work was reproduced by Holmes in acquatint and finished by hand, and was very popular. In 1813 Holmes became a member of the Society of Painters in Water Colours, which had recently changed its rules to admit painters in oil, and sent two works&#151;<span class="italic">Hot Porridge</span> and <span class="italic">The Married Man</span>&#151;to their exhibition that year, and further small subject pictures and a few portraits to their exhibitions until 1821, when the society's rules reverted to admitting only painters in watercolour. <span class="italic">The Michaelmas Dinner</span> (exh. 1817; Royal Collection), which &#145;allied [him] to the Dutch school&#146;, Holmes regarded as among his best works  (Story, 86). In 1824 he was a founder member of the Society of British Artists, of which he was president in 1829, and exhibited with them for nearly thirty years.<br>
<br>In 1814 Holmes moved from 9 Delancey Place, Camden Town, where he had lived for some years, to 1 Upper Titchfield Street, Fitzroy Square, a change that was probably the result of his marriage at that time. In 1815 he moved again, to 9 Upper Titchfield Street, and then in 1817, to 9 Cirencester Place, where he remained until his move to 15 Wilton Street, Belgrave Square, in 1828. Holmes, whose wife's identity is unknown, had three surviving sons: George Augustus and Edward, who became painters&#151;the former of figure and animal subjects, the latter of portraits in miniature and landscape&#151;and Henry, who emigrated to Australia. (His first son, James, died young.) Holmes and his family enjoyed a lifelong friendship with the Leigh family&#151;George Augustus was the godson of Augusta Leigh, half-sister of the poet Lord Byron. Holmes painted a miniature portrait of Augusta (priv. coll.) and several of Byron, with whom he was intimate.<br>
<br>Princess Esterh&aacute;zy, of whom Holmes painted about twelve portraits, introduced him to her cousin George IV, of whom he painted four portraits, including in 1828 a reduced-size copy of a whole-length by John Hoppner (oils; Temple Newsam, Leeds), which was subsequently engraved; his reduced-size copy in oil of a portrait of George III after James Northcote is also at Temple Newsam. He also made a portrait of the duke of Clarence, later William IV, in uniform as lord high admiral, and miniatures of the Princess Sophia. His miniature of Princess Mary of Russia, grand duchess of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenbach, signed and dated 1821, is in the Royal Collection. Holmes was invited to the coronation of George IV and later made a sketch of this from a pencil drawing that he had made on the spot. He painted three or four portraits of Maria II, queen of Portugal, and in 1828 the duc d'Orl&eacute;ans sat to him in Wilton Street. &#145;Holmes's suavity of manners and invariable good humour, joined to his talents as an artist and as a miniaturist had rendered him a great favourite at Court, and he became a frequent guest at His Majesty's evening parties&#146;  (Story, 90&#150;91). A talented flautist (he had been encouraged by Novello, founder of the well-known music publishing firm, to give up painting for music), Holmes was often invited to play for the king; Marquess Conyngham commented that &#145;Mr. Holmes had become the King's hobby&#146;  (ibid., 91). He was also patronized by the brewer Sir Henry Meux and the society hostess Lady Sarah Sophia, countess of Jersey, of whom he painted a whole-length portrait in oil (1834; priv. coll.). Other sitters included Charles John Gardiner, first earl of Blessington (NPG), Thomas Grenville (exh. Society of British Artists, 1837), and F. J. Robinson, first earl of Ripon (<i>c</i>.1844). At the height of his career Holmes was earning in excess of 2000 guineas a year but his temperate nature led him always to be short of funds.<br>
<br>In 1835 Holmes made a two-month visit to Italy with the painter F. Y. Hurlstone, with whom he became acquainted in 1823&#150;4. He accompanied Hurlstone as far as Milan and then went on separately to Venice, where in 1818 Byron had invited him to paint portraits of his mistress and his natural daughter, Allegra. In later years Holmes stood surety for the builder of his studio, whose firm subsequently went bankrupt, and at seventy he was financially ruined. He gave up his home in Wilton Street and moved to Hendon. In 1853 his wife died, and he passed several years visiting friends in Shropshire and Worcestershire, before living with his sons George and Edward. He died in London on 24 February 1860.<br>
<br>Holmes was &#145;comparatively short of stature and inclined to spareness of figure&#146;; he was &#145;very strongly built&#146;, &#145;quick of motion&#146;, and noted for his &#145;vivacity of temperament&#146; and &#145;perpetual good spirits&#146;  (Story, 107&#150;8). Basil Long commented that although he was more successful with his watercolours than in oil &#145;the few miniatures by Holmes which I have seen were not such as to justify the reputation he appears to have enjoyed&#146;  (Long, 217). Daphne Foskett noted the large amount of gum arabic Holmes used to obtain a varnish-like finish to his miniatures in watercolour but commented more favourably that his miniatures signed &#145;J. Holmes&#146; or &#145;Js Holmes Pt&#146; or &#145;J. H.&#146;, followed by a date, &#145;are well-drawn and expressive&#146;  (Foskett, 568). Holmes was much in demand, and his sitters commissioned from him many copies of miniature portraits that he had painted from life. The quality of his work varies greatly, depending on whether the status of a miniature is that of a prime version or a copy after a studio template. (George Augustus Holmes is also known to have made copies of miniatures painted by his father.) At his best&#151;for example, in the prime versions of his portraits of Lord Byron of 1813 and 1815&#150;16&#151;Holmes's work shows great sensitivity in rendering the sitter's facial expression as well as his physical appearance. Byron wrote that &#145;Holmes made (<i>I think the very best</i>) one of me in 1815&#151;or 1816&#151;and from this there were some good engravings taken &hellip; I prefer that likeness to any which has been done of me by any artist whatever&#146;  (<span class="italic">Byron's Letters and Journals</span>, 10.175).<br>
