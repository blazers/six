<span class="headword">Botwulf</span> <span class="st"> [St Botwulf, Botolph]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>654&#150;<em>c.</em>670), <span class="occ">abbot of Iken</span>, began to build his minster of &#145;Icanho&#146; (now conclusively identified as Iken, Suffolk) in 654 according to the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span>. Ceolfrith, the future abbot of Monkwearmouth and Jarrow, is said by his anonymous biographer to have visited East Anglia &#145;to see the monastic practices of Abbot Botwulf, whom report had proclaimed on all sides to be a man of unparalleled life and learning and full of the grace of the Holy Spirit&#146;  (Plummer, 1.389), a visit which would have occurred <i>c</i>.670. This suggests that the rule observed at Iken, unfortunately unknown, was a formative one which influenced the practices of other major late seventh-century houses.<br>
<br>Iken Minster, where excavations in 1977 found remains of the early church and monastic settlement, controlled at least one daughter house on the opposite side of England. A charter of 674&#150;90 preserved in the &#145;Testament of St Mildburg&#146; records the foundation of Much Wenlock Minster, Mercia, on land given by &AElig;thelheah, abbot of Botwulf's monastery of Iken, &#145;on condition that the said place shall by God's will remain, not on compulsion but willingly, under the tutelage of the church of the venerable Abbot Botwulf&#146;  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 1798). A twelfth-century charter records a tradition that Hadstock, Essex, was another minster founded by Botwulf.<br>
<br>These fragments of evidence identify Botwulf as a religious leader of high status in the first years of East Anglian Christianity, almost certainly acting under royal patronage, who extended his monastic federation through cross-kingdom family networks. The much fuller account of his life written by Folcard after <i>c</i>.1070, which amplifies the context of royal patronage, states that Botwulf and his brother Adulf were trained in Germany, and gives the year of his death as 680, seems to be largely imaginary. In the tenth and eleventh centuries his relics were divided up and are recorded variously at Peterborough, Thorney, Bury, Ely, and Hadstock, a multiplicity of sites which raises a suspicion that two or more saints called Botwulf may have been conflated in the hagiographical tradition. Botwulf's cult had some success in post-conquest England, especially in East Anglia and London, and sixty-four medieval dedications to him are recorded; there was also a significant cult in Scandinavia. His feast was celebrated on 17 June, that of his translation on 1 December.<br>
