<span class="headword">Villiers,  John</span>, Viscount Purbeck  (1591?&#150;1658), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28292/', "Sir George Villiers (c.1544&#150;1606)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28288/', "Villiers, Sir Edward")</script>] and his second wife, Mary (<i>c</i>.1570&#150;1632), daughter of Anthony Beaumont of Glenfield, Leicestershire. His two younger brothers were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28293/', "George Villiers, the future duke of Buckingham (1592&#150;1628)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28287/', "Christopher Villiers, the future earl of Anglesey (d. 1630)")</script>. Nothing is known of his education, but in 1602 his brother George went to school at Billesdon, Leicestershire, where Anthony Cade was the master, and Villiers may well have preceded him.<br>
<br>In May 1609 Villiers's mother was able to procure a pass via her future third husband, Sir Thomas Compton, to enable Villiers and his brother George to travel abroad. Three years were spent at places such as Blois and Angers before the brothers returned in 1612&#150;13. By the beginning of 1616 George Villiers had begun his meteoric rise to power and influence, and he was not averse to advancing his elder brother. On 30 June 1616 John Villiers was knighted, and he soon became groom of the bedchamber and master of the robes to Prince Charles (the future Charles I). When the king conferred the earldom of Buckingham on George in January 1617, it was entailed upon his elder brother should the new earl die without male heirs.<br>
<br>Villiers married on 29 September 1617 Frances (1599&#150;1645), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5826/', "Sir Edward Coke")</script> and his second wife, Lady Elizabeth Cecil [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68059/', "Hatton, Elizabeth")</script>], widow of Sir William Hatton (and therefore known as Lady Hatton). For Coke this was a marriage intended to form an alliance with the Villiers family, and so regain royal favour. For Villiers the attractiveness of the match was more material: as Lady Hatton put it, her daughter &#145;is heir to the mother to a fortune not much inferior to any unmarried heir of England&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Holles</span>, 2.185). Lady Hatton was opposed to the marriage, and hid her daughter at Oatlands, near Hampton Court. Coke then forcibly took possession of his daughter, who seems to have reconciled herself to the match knowing that &#145;it will be a means of the King's favour to my father&#146;, and because Villiers was &#145;not to be misliked; his fortune is very good; a gentleman well born&#146;  (Lockyer, 43). The marriage was conducted by the bishop of Winchester at Hampton Court, in the presence of the king, the queen, and Prince Charles.<br>
<br>Lady Hatton appears to have accepted the match, but when it came to bestowing some of her fortune, inherited from her late husband, on to the couple, she prevaricated, and it is not known how much was eventually settled upon them. It was in anticipation of some of the Hatton property on the Isle of Purbeck, Dorset, being settled on Villiers that James I on 19 July 1619 created him Baron Stoke and Viscount Purbeck. In 1620 Purbeck and his wife were abroad, visiting Spa; this was possibly an early indication of the need to find a cure for his ill health. By this date he was exhibiting signs of mental instability, which took the form of several days of uncontrolled behaviour, before he subsided in a &#145;dull fit&#146;, which allowed him to be calmed down. In October 1622 Purbeck was at Compton to recover from &#145;his fit&#146;, and Lady Purbeck was living elsewhere and enjoying financial support from Buckingham.<br>
<br>On 19 October 1624 Lady Purbeck gave birth to a son, Robert. The father was rumoured to be Sir Robert Howard, a younger son of the earl of Suffolk. Buckingham was outraged, given that at this date he was without an heir himself and the child stood to inherit his titles and honours. Both Lady Purbeck and Howard protested their innocence and were ordered to appear before the court of high commission on 5 March 1625. Purbeck himself accompanied Buckingham on his embassy to the Netherlands later in 1625. A second hearing before the court of high commission took place on 19 November 1627, when Lady Purbeck was found guilty of adultery, fined, and ordered to undertake a public penance. This she avoided by taking refuge in the Savoy, and she then escaped to live with her father. After Coke's death in 1634 she returned to London, but for fear of renewed prosecution she fled to France with Howard, before returning in the early 1640s. She was buried on 4 June 1645.<br>
<br>Following the death of Buckingham in 1628, Purbeck appears to have been put under royal protection. A letter survives from 1632 which enjoins a strict regimen for Purbeck, now a patient at the home of Dr Cudiman: no tobacco or wine, nor any visitors apart from those who came with him out of the country. At some point after 1645 Purbeck was married for a second time, to Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1696), daughter of Sir William Slingsby of Kippax, Yorkshire, and the widow of Colonel Chichester Fortescue of Dromiskin, Ireland. Purbeck made his will on 29 August 1655, making his wife executrix. In December 1655 he petitioned for lodgings at Somerset House, but these were refused. His death was reported on 26 February 1658 by two of Secretary Nicholas's Parisian correspondents, but another source reported his death on 18 February 1658 at Charlton, near Greenwich, Kent. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7136/', "Robert Danvers (1624&#150;1674)")</script>, either his son or the illegitimate son of his wife, fought for the king, married the daughter of a regicide, became a presbyterian, and died a Catholic in France.<br>
