<span class="headword">Kuper,  Hilda Beemer</span>  (1911&#150;1992), <span class="occ">social anthropologist</span>, was born in Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia, on 23 August 1911, the daughter of Joseph Beemer, a Lithuanian Jew who with his brother ran a trading business in Northern Rhodesia, and his wife, Antoinette, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Renner, who was also Jewish and was from Vienna. Hilda's father died during the influenza pandemic of 1918 and she then moved with her mother, three sisters, and a brother to Johannesburg. She enrolled at the then new University of the Witwatersrand in 1928 to study social anthropology and French. She had been drawn to anthropology by Winifred Hoernl&eacute;, an inspiring teacher, who gave her a good grounding in the French, German, and American, as well as the British, schools of this emerging discipline. Her other teachers included the historians W. M. Macmillan and Margaret Hodgson (later Ballinger), the palaeontologist Raymond Dart, and the young anthropologist Isaac Schapera, with whom she had her first exposure to fieldwork in Bechuanaland. Her fellow students included Max Gluckman, a childhood friend, and Leo Kuper (1908&#150;1994), her future husband. After her graduation Schapera recommended her to pursue further studies in anthropology with Bronislaw Malinowski at the London School of Economics. While there she undertook a course of psychoanalysis and was a member of a Marxist study group. She established a close relationship with Malinowski and acted as his research assistant in the preparation of his last major book, <span class="italic">Coral Gardens and their Magic</span> (1937). She always acknowledged his influence on her fieldwork methods, though she came to disagree with his views on such issues as the tribe as a harmonious whole, the role of conflict, and the relationship of history to social anthropology.<br>
<br>After two years in London Hilda Beemer was awarded a fellowship by the International African Institute to do fieldwork in Swaziland. She was with three of her mentors, Hoernl&eacute;, Schapera, and Malinowski, at an education conference in Johannesburg when she met Sobhuza II, paramount chief and later king of Swaziland, for the first time in July 1934&#151;the beginning of a long and close friendship. Sobhuza suggested that she should do fieldwork at Lobamba, the royal village of his mother, the queen mother Lomawa, about ten miles south-east of the administrative capital, Mbabane. Malinowski accompanied her to Swaziland and helped her to establish a good relationship with Lomawa. Her acceptance by the Swazi was further facilitated by the rapidity with which she acquired a good working knowledge of siSwati. Her first significant published work on the Swazi was a study of the structure and function of the regimental system. The writing of her dissertation was delayed by periodic bouts of malaria and by theoretical uncertainty, but she finished it in 1942. She had by then abandoned the structural&#150;functional approach and had concluded that the organizing principle of Swazi society was rank. She was, however, also concerned with conflict, and sought to show how, in the context of colonial rule and land alienation, colour had become a complicating factor&#151;an index of inequality. Her dissertation had, perhaps unfortunately, to be published in two parts and by two different presses: <span class="italic">An African Aristocracy: Rank among the Swazi</span> (1947) and <span class="italic">The Uniform of Colour: a Study of White&#150;Black Relationships in Swaziland</span> (1947). Her other works on Swaziland included a score of articles, a monograph, <span class="italic">The Swazi: a South African Kingdom</span> (1963 and 1986), a novel, <span class="italic">Bite of Hunger</span> (1965), and a play, <span class="italic">A Witch in My Heart</span> (1970).<br>
<br>Hilda had married Leo Kuper, who was then practising as an attorney, in 1936. After distinguished war service in South African military intelligence, he trained as a sociologist at Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and then under Charles Madge at the University of Birmingham. Although her work on the Swazi emphasized the important political and social roles of women, Hilda Kuper was not a feminist, and subordinated her own academic career to that of her husband. She resigned from her post at the University of the Witwatersrand in order to accompany him to America and England, and returned with him to Durban when he became head of the sociology department there in 1952. It is, perhaps, surprising that she did not turn her attention to the Zulu in Durban, but, while bringing up two young daughters, Mary and Jenny, she devoted her time there to research on another &#145;tribe&#146;&#151;the Indian minority in South Africa. Her work on kinship, religion, and caste in the diverse Indian community of Durban was brought together in <span class="italic">Indian People in Natal</span> (1960).<br>
<br>The Kupers were founder members of the Liberal Party in Natal and were active opponents of apartheid. They moved to Los Angeles in 1961 after Leo's appointment as a professor of sociology at the University of California. Hilda's own appointment as a professor of anthropology at the same university came two years later. Until that time she had had a relatively short teaching career, including five years, 1940&#150;45, in Johannesburg, and two years, 1959&#150;61, at the University of Natal, but she acquired a reputation as a dedicated and stimulating teacher. Leo had begun an academic career relatively late, but he rapidly made up for lost time. His major contributions to the study of South Africa were <span class="italic">Passive Resistance in South Africa</span> (1957), <span class="italic">Durban: a Study in Racial Ecology</span> (1958), and <span class="italic">An African Bourgeoisie</span> (1965), a book on South Africa's emerging black middle class. He also co-edited an important collection, <span class="italic">Pluralism in Africa</span> (1969). In his retirement he produced two books, <span class="italic">Genocide: its Political Use in the Twentieth Century</span> (1981) and <span class="italic">The Prevention of Genocide</span> (1985), which were both retrospectively and prophetically critical of the ability of the United Nations to cope with genocide.<br>
<br>Hilda Kuper undertook her last major work, <span class="italic">King Sobhuza II, Ngwenyama and King of Swaziland</span> (1978), an authorized biography, out of gratitude, but reluctantly. She was aware of the difficulty of writing the life of a friend with the unwelcome &#145;help&#146; of an advisory committee. The book was, however, based on over forty years of close observation of its subject, as well as on interviews and archival research, and was one of the best-informed and most revealing biographies of a twentieth-century African leader. Some critics alleged that she allowed herself to be co-opted by Sobhuza, and that through her publications as a whole she gave intellectual respectability to his &#145;traditionalist&#146; agenda. There is an element of truth in these assertions, but it is equally clear that she would have been unable to produce her remarkable body of ethnographic work without his support. She genuinely admired Sobhuza, whom she saw as &#145;a good king, a wise statesman, [and] a gracious man&#146;  (dedication in Kuper, <span class="italic">The Swazi</span>, 1986). She sympathized with his low-key resistance to colonial rule, and supported his efforts to regain Swazi land and self-respect. She took Swazi citizenship in 1970, preferring this to South African or American citizenship, and thereafter always travelled on a Swaziland passport. Her Swazi name was La Bema, derived from her maiden name.<br>
<br>Hilda and Leo Kuper formed an unusually happy and creative intellectual partnership and both made major contributions, in related but different fields, to the study of Southern African society. Hilda Kuper died in Los Angeles on 23 April 1992, and Leo Kuper died there on 23 May 1994. They were survived by their daughters, Mary and Jenny, the latter an expert on international law in relation to the rights of the child.<br>
