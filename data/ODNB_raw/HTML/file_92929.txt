<span class="headword">Manuel II</span>  (1889&#150;1932), <span class="occ">king of Portugal</span>, was born on 15 November 1889 at the royal palace of Bel&eacute;m, in Lisbon, the second of the two children of Carlos I (1863&#150;1908), king of Portugal (1889&#150;1908), and his wife, Queen Am&eacute;lie (1864&#150;1951), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/92473/', "Louis Philippe d'Orl&#233;ans, count of Paris")</script>, and his wife, Marie Isabelle d'Orl&eacute;ans Montpensier, infanta of Spain. His full name was, according to Portuguese court etiquette, a long rosary of names invoking the memory of relatives, or the protection of some favourite saints: Manuel Maria Filipe Carlos Am&eacute;lia Lu&iacute;s Miguel Rafael Gabriel Gonzaga Xavier Francisco de Assis Eug&eacute;nio. To these were added the names of four European princely houses: Bragan&ccedil;a (from his great-grandmother), Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (from his great-grandfather), Savoy (from his grandmother), and Orl&eacute;ans (from his mother). As the second son of the king, he had the titles of infante and duke of Beja. After an education at home by private tutors, Manuel enrolled at the Lisbon naval school in 1907. Following the tradition of the Portuguese court, he was not expected to perform any public role, but he was to be denied the traditional leisurely life of the infantes in Portugal, when a tragedy put him suddenly on the throne of Portugal.<br>
<br>On 1 February 1908 Manuel survived the attempt made on the royal family in the square of Terreiro do Pa&ccedil;o, in Lisbon, in which his father, King Carlos, and his brother, the crown prince Lu&iacute;s Filipe, were killed by a band of republican militants armed with rifles and pistols. Manuel, who was travelling in the same open carriage as his parents and his brother when they were attacked, was himself shot in the arm, while his mother, Queen Am&eacute;lie, tried to defend him by hitting one of the assassins with a bouquet of flowers.<br>
<br>Under the direction of his forceful mother and her chosen advisers, the young Manuel II turned himself into a studious and zealous king. He read government files through the night and made a point of braving the streets of Lisbon on horseback and in an open carriage despite republican threats. He, his mother, and their advisers tried to preserve the old British-style constitutional monarchy as it had existed in the nineteenth century, liberal in its principles, consensual in its methods, and tolerant of its adversaries. These efforts never convinced the republicans, but alienated the conservatives. Thus Manuel's experience was that of increasing isolation. The weakening of the old court nobility and the Catholic church by successive liberal governments during the nineteenth century deprived him of the support of a strong aristocracy or a loyal priesthood.<br>
<br>In spite of family links with almost all European royal houses, Manuel never managed to find a bride among them. One of the prospective brides was Princess Louise of Battenberg (the future queen of Sweden), who refused Manuel despite Edward VII's admonition to her that she should have &#145;a more patriotic approach to marriage, as it would be a great thing &hellip; if the Queen of Portugal was British&#146;  (Brook-Shepherd, 276). This lack of patriotism among the young British royals was taken in Portugal as a sign that the European dynasties saw the Portuguese monarchy as doomed. From Britain the only thing Manuel gained was to be made a knight of the Garter (1909), like most kings of Portugal since Jo&atilde;o I in the fifteenth century. In his isolation Manuel found some solace in the attention of a French actress, Gaby Deslys, whom he met in Paris in November 1909.<br>
<br>When the republicans tried to subvert the Lisbon garrison on 4 October 1910 Manuel found himself alone, having to flee the royal palace under bombardment. Forced into exile, he arrived in Plymouth on 14 October 1910. The choice of England as a place of refuge may be explained by his family connection with the British royal family, and by a desire somehow to influence the destiny of his former kingdom, given the importance of the British alliance to Portugal. England had also been the traditional place of exile for his Orl&eacute;ans relatives.<br>
<br>Manuel's first months in exile were not easy. With all his properties in Portugal confiscated, he had to live off the life insurance his father had taken in London. His uncle, the duke of Orl&eacute;ans, put him up in his Wood Norton house, near Evesham, Worcestershire. In January 1911 he moved to Abercorn House, in Richmond, Surrey, rented by his mother, Queen Am&eacute;lie. In 1913, after the Lisbon government, under British pressure, returned to him the properties of the duchy of Bragan&ccedil;a, the greatest territorial estate in Portugal, Manuel was able to acquire Fulwell Park, in Twickenham, Middlesex, which was his residence in England for the rest of his life (his mother had been born in Twickenham, at York House). On 4 September 1913 he married a distant cousin, Auguste Viktoria (1890&#150;1966), daughter of Wilhelm (1864&#150;1927), prince of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, and his wife, Marie Therese (1867&#150;1909), princess of Bourbon-Sicily. From the very first moment, rumours abounded about the difficult relationship of the couple. They never produced an heir.<br>
<br>In England Manuel was treated by the British royal family as a guest of honour, and attended many official ceremonies and royal parties. He fitted in well with the British upper class, benefiting from the guidance provided by the marquis of Soveral, the former Portuguese minister in London and an intimate of the late Edward VII. In June 1911 Winston Churchill, secretary of state for the Home Department, met Manuel for a &#145;long drive and walk&#146;. In a letter to his wife, Churchill described the former king as &#145;really a vy charming boy&#151;Full of gravity &amp; conviction, &amp; yet in spite of his sorry plight&#151;a boy brimful of life &amp; spirits. He has a great air, natural and compulsive. He is extremely clever and accomplished.&#146; Manuel tried to engage Churchill's help in the lobbying for his cause, but Churchill realized that the restoration of the monarchy in Portugal had foundered on &#145;deeper problems than the inquiring mind of this intelligent, good Master &amp; devout young exile has yet reached&#146;  (Churchill, 2.341).<br>
<br>Apart from his official and political endeavours, Manuel led the life of a gentleman of leisure, supporting local societies (he was the president of the Twickenham Piscatorial Society) and helping to raise funds for good causes. He would travel to London most days, sharing his time between the Marlborough Club, in Pall Mall, and the booksellers Maggs Bros., where he spent a fortune on rare books. Every year he went to Wimbledon for the tennis tournament and to Vichy for treatment at the local spa. When travelling he used the title of count of Our&eacute;m. His favourite occupations were playing the piano, reading and cataloguing his collection of fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Portuguese books. The results of his erudite pursuits appeared in three massive volumes, <span class="italic">Livros antigos portugueses, 1489&#150;1600</span>, published by Cambridge University Press between 1929 and 1935. A flattering review of the first volume in the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span> in 1929 left him ecstatic. He saw his expensive bibliophilia as a patriotic service to Portuguese history and culture, but it reinforced the conviction of many of his remaining partisans in Portugal that he preferred his life as a retired gentleman in a London suburb to that of a pretender fighting for his throne.<br>
<br>After the disappointing outcome of monarchist insurrections in 1911&#150;12 Manuel's chances of returning were in any case never very high. He remained suspicious of his supporters in Portugal, rejecting the anti-liberal principles which most Portuguese monarchists borrowed from Action Fran&ccedil;aise. The First World War exposed the gap separating the exiled king from his followers inside the country. Whereas most of these, blaming Britain for the fall of the monarchy, sympathized with Germany, Manuel insisted that the British alliance was the best way of guaranteeing Portuguese independence. When the republic entered the war on the side of the allies in 1916, he shocked his followers by ordering them to support the republican government. His explanation, that the survival of the nation must take precedence over the restoration of the monarchy, gained him the nickname of King of the Republicans in reactionary circles. When in 1926 a military dictatorship finally expelled the radicals from power, Manuel lobbied the British government to recognize the new conservative republic, and he never ceased to praise its finance minister, Dr Salazar.<br>
<br>Always a heavy smoker, Manuel died from an oedema of the throat at home, in Fulwell Park, on 2 July 1932. His entourage blamed his death on negligence by his English doctor. After a requiem mass at Westminster Cathedral his body was taken in August 1932 to the royal mausoleum of S&atilde;o Vicente de Fora in Lisbon, Salazar having decided to give a state funeral to the former king. Manuel's reputation among non-monarchists increased when it was revealed that he had left his library, art collections, and properties to the nation.<br>
<br>Life allowed Manuel the rare privilege of reconciling high principles and self-interest. His willingness to put the interests of the nation above those of his dynasty justified him in his decision to remain in England, at ease to pursue with a clear conscience that life of a gentleman of leisure that the tragedy of 1908 almost denied him.<br>
