<span class="headword">Lamb,  Andrew</span>  (1565?&#150;1634), <span class="occ">bishop of Galloway</span>, was probably related to Andrew Lamb of Leith, a lay member of the general assembly of 1560. He became minister of Burntisland, Fife, in 1593, and was translated to Arbroath in 1596 and to South Leith, near Edinburgh, in 1600. In that year he was appointed one of the members of the standing commission of the church to advise the king between general assemblies, and in 1601 he became a royal chaplain, in which capacity he accompanied the earl of Mar on an embassy to England to ensure James VI's succession to the English throne. Lamb was one of the ministers chosen by James to accompany him on his journey south in 1603, and he received a pension from the abbey of Arbroath for services to the king and to the church.<br>
<br>Lamb was made titular bishop of Brechin in 1607, and he presented a brass chandelier of Flemish workmanship to Brechin Cathedral in 1615. He was a member of the general assembly of 1610 which restored the full powers of the episcopate, and was one of the three Scottish bishops consecrated at London on 21 October 1610. He was one of four bishops who signed a letter of remonstrance to the king regarding the images ordered for the decoration of the Chapel Royal at Holyrood on the occasion of James VI's visit in 1617. Several biographers of Samuel Rutherford have suggested that Lamb gave tacit consent to his ordination by the laying on of presbyterial hands. While there is no clear evidence of this, Lamb was believed to be more tolerant than some of his contemporaries of those who did not conform to the ecclesiastical practices prescribed in the five articles of Perth. At the general assembly of the kirk in August 1618 he conceded that he knew of nothing in &#145;Scripture, Reasone, nor Antiquitie that inforceth kneeling&#146;, but, since he considered the practice as a thing indifferent, advocated its acceptance for the sake of conformity to the king's wishes  (MacDonald, 163).<br>
<br>In 1619 Lamb was translated to Galloway, but in his later years became blind and resided chiefly in Leith, where he owned property. He died in 1634, leaving a son, James, and two daughters, both of whom married landowners in the stewartry of Kirkcudbright. His wife's name is unknown.<br>
