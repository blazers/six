<span class="headword">Boteler <span class="st"> [Butler]</span>,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1645&#150;1670), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer and major-general</span>, was the son of Noel (or Neville) Boteler of Barnwell in Northamptonshire; the Anglican clergyman <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2957/', "Edward Boteler")</script> was probably his brother. There is little information about his early life but he reputedly attended Oundle School, Northamptonshire. At some point before 1646 he married Elizabeth Brooke of Great Oakley, Northamptonshire.<br>
<br>Boteler rose to the rank of captain of a troop of horse in a local regiment during the first civil war. Over the next few years he was active in, first, local and soon national military affairs: in the summer of 1648 he was a leader of the forces which suppressed a royalist rising in Northamptonshire and the following spring he was active both in maintaining order in the county and in the capture of the Leveller mutineer William Thompson. He acquired a residence in Oundle and land in Derbyshire. Clearly he was on the way up economically.<br>
<br>Boteler's concern for religion was shown by service on the commissions for the propagation of the gospel in Wales (where he became a JP) and by his part in petitions for toleration, which no doubt reinforced contacts with Oliver Cromwell. He had spoken up for religious freedom at the Whitehall debates in January 1649: acutely aware &#145;that for the most parte truth and light go under the name of errour and heresy&#146;, he feared that the state-funded religious teachers proposed in the second <span class="italic">Agreement of the People</span> would &#145;raile against us in every pulpitt; and make itt their worke nott to discover truth and preach sound doctrine, butt to raile against honest men&#146;  (<span class="italic">Clarke Papers</span>, 2.173). In 1652, in similar vein, he presented a paper to his fellow-commissioners for the propagation of the gospel in Wales which asked whether it was not God's pleasure that the judgment and condemnation of false teachers and heretics be left to himself [God] alone and whether for civil powers to judge in matters of religion was not against the liberties granted by Christ to his people. An Independent congregation met at his house in Oundle.<br>
<br>Between 1655 and 1657 Boteler was major-general for Northamptonshire, Bedfordshire, and Huntingdonshire. This was a remarkable appointment for one who had so far never commanded a regiment&#151;he was by now major in James Berry's regiment of horse&#151;though he had been engaged in local administration in his home county as JP and judge for the relief of poor prisoners over the preceding years and had recently earned praise for his success in quelling discontent and negotiating civil&#150;military tensions in Bristol in the winter of 1654&#150;5. Boteler was certainly among the most assiduous of the major-generals. He was particularly harsh on Catholics, on Quakers (to George Fox, Boteler was &#145;a cruel persecutor&#146; and &#145;a shame to Christianity and religion&#146;), and on vagrants and the disorderly: all of these groups he seems to have lumped together  (Durston, 46). Boteler was noted, too, for vigorous, even violent, implementation of the decimation tax upon royalists. He showed little regard for their social sensibilities, gaoling James Compton, third earl of Northampton, when the latter refused to enter into a security bond with no time limitation, and releasing him only when directly ordered to do so by the council of state. According to one royalist account, Boteler had &#145;carried himself insolently to a royalist of quality, calling him &#147;Sirrah&#148; and telling him he would make him proclayme Charles Steward &hellip; a traytor or eate his sworde&#146;  (ibid.). He purged Bedford corporation, justifying the legally dubious ends that he had employed by pointing to the consequent strengthening of the position of the godly party in the town; he later managed to restrict the borough franchise and got himself and four allies placed on the aldermanic bench.<br>
<br>Elected for Northamptonshire to the second protectorate parliament (1656&#150;8), Boteler was prominent in the debates over the alleged &#145;horrid blasphemy&#146; of the Quaker James Nayler, revealing thereby, as in his actions against Friends as major-general, the limitations of his own toleration. His ears tingled and his heart trembled to hear the report of Nayler's entry in Bristol in imitation of Christ's entry into Jerusalem. Such blasphemers by the Mosaic law were to be stoned to death, and for his part he could freely consent to it. When the protector enquired about the grounds for the Commons proceeding to a trial, Boteler was satisfied they had &#145;a judicatory power&#146; to do so. Not unexpectedly, his defence of the major-generals in the debates over the <span class="roman">Decimation Bill</span> was &#145;hot&#146;. He deplored the house's &#145;dilatoriness&#146; in voting funds for the war with Spain. Although he was opposed to the offer of the crown to Cromwell in the spring of 1657, with that out of the way he came round in support of the revised draft of the humble petition and advice (June 1657). In the brief second session (January 1658) he argued strongly for transacting with the new &#145;other House&#146; as a House of Lords, expounding the virtues of government by a single person and a bicameral parliament. In his interventions he displayed a familiarity with the scriptures and a grasp of parliamentary procedure. In the spring of 1658 Boteler was given the command of Oliver Cromwell's own regiment of horse: an appointment which Henry Cromwell put down to his father's belief that &#145;he may command those more absolutely, who have been most used to obey him&#146;  (Thurloe, 7.102).<br>
<br>Boteler did not sit in Richard Cromwell's parliament (1659), where, however, he was assailed for gross abuses as major-general in Northamptonshire. Although he claimed merely to have followed the protector's orders, he was put out of the commission of the peace. When further penalties were proposed Secretary John Thurloe, for political (and perhaps personal) reasons, spoke up for him, pressing&#151;ironically in view of Boteler's attitude in the Nayler trial&#151;that he should be heard before sentence. The abrupt dissolution of the parliament in April rescued him. The restored Rump, however, took away Boteler's regimental command and spurned his nomination as quartermaster-general. Even so, he was given a garrison command at Rockingham.<br>
<br>At the Restoration Boteler's exclusion from the <span class="roman">Act of Oblivion</span> was rejected by a small majority. He retired to live quietly at Oatlands Park, Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, maintaining his religious nonconformity, establishing himself in legal practice and, if he was indeed the Mr William Buttler who paid tax on fourteen hearths in 1664, living in some prosperity. He was questioned from time to time about radical plots, and was even for a time held in the Tower of London. In June 1666, after ten months' imprisonment, he pleaded with the secretary of state, the earl of Arlington, for his release: his practice and estate were ruined and he feared that his wife and five children would starve for lack of maintenance (it is uncertain whether this wife was Elizabeth Brooke or another woman). His claim to be moved by conscience and not by political faction seems then to have been accepted. However, he is last visible in the records following his being picked up again at a large conventicle in May 1670, regarded by the authorities as a man &#145;dangerous, and likely to enflame&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1670</i>, 234). The date and place of his death are unknown.<br>
<br>Boteler's was an unappealing personality. His principles were narrow and his realization of them oppressive: even he conceded to Thurloe in May 1656 that he was almost daily exceeding his legal powers. His career suggests that he was capable of combining a sense of duty with an urge to self-help. But within its strait limits his religion seems to have been genuine enough, and one small incident a few months before Boteler became major-general shows him in an informal moment of curiosity drawn to the utopian vision of Samuel Hartlib. In June 1655 he visited Hartlib to thank him for his recently published <span class="italic">The Reformed Common-Wealth of Bees</span>, which presented the hive as the model of a harmonious, ordered commonwealth; Boteler was &#145;especially taken with the Glass-hives&#146; which Hartlib used to exhibit his argument  (Hartlib papers, Sheffield University Library, HP 29/5/35b).<br>
