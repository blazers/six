<span class="headword">Ponsonby, Sir  William</span>  (1772&#150;1815), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22506/', "William Brabazon Ponsonby, first Baron Ponsonby (1744&#150;1806)")</script>, and his wife, Louisa (1749&#150;1824), fourth daughter of Richard Molesworth, third Viscount Molesworth of Swords. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22499/', "John Ponsonby, Viscount Ponsonby (c.1770&#150;1855)")</script>, was his eldest brother. Both Ponsonby and his second cousin, Frederic Cavendish Ponsonby (1783&#150;1837), were great-grandsons of the first earl of Bessborough.<br>
<br>After serving for a year and a half as ensign and lieutenant in the independent companies of Captain Bulwer and Captain Davis, Ponsonby obtained a company in the 83rd foot in September 1794, and on 15 December of that year became major in the loyal Irish fencibles. On 1 March 1798 he was transferred to the 5th dragoon guards, and he obtained command of the regiment on 24 February 1803, having become lieutenant-colonel in the army on 1 January 1800. He married the Hon. Georgiana Fitzroy, sixth daughter of the first Lord Southampton, on 20 January 1807.<br>
<br>Ponsonby became colonel on 25 July 1810. In 1811 he went to Spain with his regiment, part of Le Marchant's brigade. His was the leading regiment of the brigade in the action at Llerena on 11 April 1812, and he won the commendation of Sir Stapleton Cotton. At Salamanca he was at the head of his regiment in the charge of the brigade which broke up the French left and took 2000 prisoners, and after the fall of General Le Marchant in that charge Ponsonby assumed command of the brigade. He was officially appointed to this command three days afterwards, on 25 July 1812, and he led the brigade at Vitoria. He was promoted major-general on 4 June 1813, and was made KCB on 2 January 1815.<br>
<br>In the campaign of 1815 Ponsonby was given command of the Union brigade (so called because of its combination of English, Scottish and Irish regiments) of heavy cavalry (Royals, Scots greys, and Inniskillings), and led it at Waterloo in the famous charge on d'Erlon's shattered corps on 18 June. Lord Anglesey's order was that the Royals and Inniskillings should charge and the Greys should support, but the Greys came up into front line before the other regiments were half way down the slope. The French columns broke up, and 2000 prisoners were taken. Sir George de Lacy Evans, who was acting as extra aide-de-camp to Ponsonby, wrote:<blockquote>The enemy fled as a flock of sheep across the valley, quite at the mercy of the dragoons. In fact our men were out of hand. The general of the brigade, his staff, and every officer within hearing exerted themselves to the utmost to re-form the men; but the helplessness of the enemy offered too great a temptation to the dragoons, and our efforts were abortive.</blockquote>They mounted the ridge on which the French artillery were drawn up, and, meeting two batteries which had moved forward, sabred the gunners and overturned the guns. The Household Cavalry brigade, which had charged at the same time on the right, became to some extent intermixed with the Union brigade. Napoleon, seeing the situation, sent two regiments of cuirassiers to fall on the front and flank of the disordered cavalry, and they were joined by a regiment of Polish lancers. According to Evans:<blockquote>Every one saw what must happen. Those whose horses were best, or least blown, got away. Some attempted to escape back to our position by going round the left of the French lancers. Sir William Ponsonby was of that number. (Siborne, 61)</blockquote>Ponsonby might have escaped if he had been better mounted, but the groom with his chestnut charger could not be found at the moment of the charge, and he was riding a small bay hack which soon stuck fast in the heavy ground. Seeing he must be overtaken, he was handing over his watch and a miniature to his brigade major to deliver to his family, when the French lancers came up and killed them both. He was buried at Kensington, in the vault of the Molesworth family (his ancestors in the female line), and a national monument was erected in St Paul's Cathedral. Wellington, in his report on the battle, expressed his &#145;grief for the fate of an officer who had already rendered very brilliant and important services, and was an ornament to his profession&#146;.<br>
<br>Ponsonby left one son, William, who succeeded his uncle John Ponsonby as third Baron Ponsonby&#151;a title which became extinct later in the nineteenth century&#151;and four daughters.<br>
