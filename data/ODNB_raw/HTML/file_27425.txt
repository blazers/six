<span class="headword">Thynne,  Thomas</span>, third Viscount Weymouth and first marquess of Bath  (1734&#150;1796), <span class="occ">courtier and politician</span>, was born on 13 September 1734, the eldest son and heir of Thomas Thynne, second Viscount Weymouth (1710&#150;1751), landowner, and his second wife, Louisa (<i>d</i>. 1736), the second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4804/', "John Carteret, Earl Granville")</script>. He seems to have been educated by his family and then at a school in Market Street, Hertfordshire, before matriculating from St John's College, Cambridge, in Lent 1752. He received his MA in 1753 and subsequently undertook a grand tour on the continent. In January 1751 he had succeeded his father, becoming the third Viscount Weymouth. The young aristocrat devoted considerable time and money to improving the family seat at Longleat in Wiltshire, employing Capability Brown, who from 1757 onwards and at considerable cost created the modern gardens and park which surround the house. But Weymouth's principal activities, then and in the future, were the common aristocratic pursuits of gambling and dissipation. In 1757, when his gambling losses were the talk of the court, George II expressed concern that Weymouth &#145;could not be a good kind of man, as he never kept company with any woman, and loved nothing but play and strong beer&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of John, Fourth Duke of Bedford</span>, 2.231). Two years later, on 22 May 1759, Weymouth married Elizabeth Cavendish (1735&#150;1825), the eldest daughter of William Bentinck, second duke of Portland, and his wife, Margaret Cavendish Harley [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40752/', "Bentinck, Margaret Cavendish, duchess of Portland (1715&#150;1785)")</script>].<h2>
<a name="Royalfavourandentryintopolitics"></a>Royal favour and entry into politics</h2>This aristocratic marriage was central to Weymouth's rise. When George III became king the following year, Weymouth was appointed a lord of the bedchamber (1760&#150;63), while his wife became first a lady of the bedchamber to Queen Charlotte (1761&#150;93) and subsequently mistress of the robes (1793&#150;1818). These positions at court, and the support of the ruler to which they led, were important during two decades when George III played an active role in government and ministerial politics. Weymouth attached himself to the duke of Bedford and was named master of the horse when the duke's followers joined George Grenville's ministry in spring 1763. The family finances, however, were unable to bear the costs of the third viscount's lifestyle, and by 1765 he was on the point of fleeing his creditors and travelling to France. Court and ministerial favour provided temporary salvation with the appointment (April&#150;July 1765) as lord lieutenant of Ireland; at the end of May Weymouth was sworn of the privy council. This appointment was accompanied by the usual grant of &pound;3000 for equipage, though Weymouth never crossed the Irish Sea to take up his post and resigned within three months.<br>
<br>Aristocratic birth, political connections, and royal favour were still sufficient to secure entrance to the highest level of government. Weymouth possessed all three and, with a rising reputation as a speaker in the House of Lords, by the mid-1760s he was on the brink of a public career. In January 1768, when the duke of Bedford's followers finally joined the ailing Chatham&#150;Grafton administration, he became secretary of state for the northern department at the unusually early age of thirty-three, though he wholly lacked experience of either diplomacy or government office. At this period formal control of British foreign policy was divided on a geographical basis. In the following October, Weymouth requested and received the senior southern secretaryship. He remained at that post until December 1770. Five years later, in November 1775, he returned to the southern department, acting as secretary of state until November 1779, when he resigned. The seven years during which he was involved in the running of Britain's foreign policy made him one of the longest-serving secretaries of state in the age of the American War of Independence, in spite of his notorious personal failings which troubled his contemporaries and flawed his career.<h2>
<a name="Secretaryofstate"></a>Secretary of state</h2>Weymouth was notoriously lazy, devoted to the gaming table, and given to dissipation and drunkenness: shortly after he entered office Junius sneered about the northern secretary and &#145;the bewitching smiles of Burgundy&#146;  (Francis, 31). He was not without ability, and his correspondence contains periodic flashes of high intelligence and real political insight, while on occasions he was a spirited and effective government spokesman in the House of Lords. This was aided by his tall and handsome appearance and patrician demeanour. In private he could charm and enchant by his conversation and lively mind. He was capable of occasional bouts of activity, not always with beneficial consequences, and these interspersed his habitual indolence. This was a crucial failing: the secretaries of state were the key executive agents of British government, responsible for turning cabinet decisions into precise orders to government agents at home and abroad. The smooth running of foreign policy depended upon the maintenance of regular communications with diplomats, and this Weymouth consistently failed to do. Instead he depended heavily, during his first period in office, on his loyal under-secretary, Robert Wood, to transact official business. While this did something to disguise Weymouth's chronic laziness, it carried an additional price, since Wood himself was widely suspected by contemporaries of abusing his position, and the inside information which it provided, to speculate in the financial markets.<br>
<br>Weymouth's two periods as secretary of state provoked a series of thinly disguised complaints and even overt protests by members of Britain's diplomatic corps that they had found themselves without specific instructions or even general guidance from London at crucial moments. In nine months during 1779, at a critical period for Anglo-Russian relations, James Harris in St Petersburg received only one letter, which was both belated and very general. Early in his ministerial career Weymouth expressed a very odd sentiment for a secretary of state, that British ministers &#145;should <i>hear</i> as much and <i>say</i> as little as possible&#146;  (<span class="italic">SIRIO</span>, 12.369), and he himself reinforced precept by example. His taciturnity and evasiveness towards the foreign diplomatic corps were notorious and widely and correctly interpreted as an attempt to cover up his ignorance of European issues, on which he remained badly informed even towards the end of his spell in office. His relations with his ministerial colleagues were equally frosty: the neglect of his duties, together with the limited impact which he had on wider government policy, was accompanied by evident ambition and periodic ruthlessness in pursuit of personal advancement. The shrewdest assessment was that offered by Sir Nathaniel Wraxall, who remarked that Weymouth's &#145;application to business by no means kept pace with his abilities, nor was he ever a popular Minister&#146;  (Wraxall, 2.198).<h2>
<a name="Foreignrelations"></a>Foreign relations</h2>British foreign policy during Weymouth's months at the northern department in 1768 was dominated by an Anglo-French confrontation over the Mediterranean island of Corsica. France's leading minister, the duc de Choiseul, secretly concluded a treaty with the declining Italian republic of Genoa to purchase the island, at a bargain price. Its acquisition would strengthen France's position in the western Mediterranean and provide protection for her important southern naval base at Toulon; it would also boost her flagging prestige after the severe defeats in the Seven Years' War (1756&#150;63). When a Franco-Genoese agreement was suspected in spring 1768, the southern secretary, the earl of Shelburne, together with the effective leader of the ministry, the duke of Grafton, Lord Camden (lord chancellor), and Sir Edward Hawke (first lord of the Admiralty), argued within cabinet for a vigorous response and were prepared to fight if necessary. They were opposed by Weymouth, along with Lord Gower (lord president of the council), Lord North (chancellor of the exchequer), and the earl of Hillsborough (American secretary). Weymouth had long been a follower of the duke of Bedford, the leading Francophile in British public life, and seems to have been taking his cue from him. The divisions within the cabinet were known to the French government and undermined Britain's position over Corsica. It was further weakened by Weymouth's calculated indiscretions to members of the foreign diplomatic corps, to the effect that the Grafton ministry would never fight over the French annexation of the island. Shelburne's policy had been wrecked by his brother secretary&#151;with whom he was already on bad terms&#151;and in the summer of 1768 France's take-over went ahead, Britain doing nothing to resist it.<br>
<br>In the autumn Shelburne resigned and was replaced by a career diplomatist, the earl of Rochford. But the latter, despite his relevant experience as an ambassador to Spain and France, was consigned to the northern department. This was because Weymouth requested and received the southern secretaryship, still recognized to be the senior province: had he not switched departments, Rochford's appointment would have appeared to slight him. As far as Weymouth was concerned, it was a matter of political prestige, not any new-found zeal for the business of government. From autumn 1768, for almost two years, he exhibited little interest in British diplomacy, being content to allow the hard-working Rochford to shape policy. Weymouth exerted real influence only on two areas of government activity during this spell in office. He acted vigorously to restore order in the capital during the riots in London in spring 1768 and the unrest associated with the Middlesex election. His actions were prompted by George III and strengthened his links with the king. Weymouth long remained an advocate of firm measures against John Wilkes. In 1769 he intervened decisively but without immediate consequences in the affairs of the East India Company, setting a precedent for taking unilateral action behind the back of his cabinet colleagues, which was to be so important in 1770 over the Falkland Islands.<br>
<br>The context to this confusing episode was the expansion of the company's territorial power and economic influence in the subcontinent during and after the Seven Years' War. At times it could act independently of the government in London over important issues of strategy in India, which had implications for Britain's wider policy. In 1768&#150;9 disquiet had arisen over the East India Company's annexation of Balambangan without apparent approval from the Grafton ministry. On this occasion Weymouth, again prompted by George III, expressed disquiet to the governors of the company. When in 1769 the company's military problems with Haidar Ali led it to seek government support, Weymouth seized the opportunity to raise the question of ministerial control. His efforts, including an unprecedented appeal to the general court, were unsuccessful, at which point he calmly issued secret instructions&#151;which contradicted his public orders&#151;to Sir John Lindsay, who was dealing with problems on the spot in India. Nothing came of this attempt to weaken the East India Company's independence, and the episode is interesting primarily for the light it sheds on Weymouth's personality and character.<h2>
<a name="TheFalklandIslandscrisis"></a>The Falkland Islands crisis</h2>In the second half of 1770 Weymouth's influence upon British foreign policy returned, and during these months his involvement was at its peak. The occasion was a revival of an earlier Anglo-Bourbon confrontation over the Falkland Islands in the distant south Atlantic. In 1766&#150;7 there had been a sharp dispute over a British settlement at Port Egmont on West Falkland, which Madrid claimed as Spanish territory. On that occasion a compromise had been patched up, with both sides wanting to avoid war. But the issue had been shelved rather than solved, and it re-emerged three years later when Spain adopted a much firmer stance. In June 1770 a Spanish force evicted the tiny British garrison from Port Egmont.<br>
<br>In September word of the expedition against Port Egmont reached London. Britain's response was the responsibility of Weymouth, who now demonstrated greater vigour than at any point in his career. The southern secretary, being one of the principal executors of government policy, possessed considerable freedom of action under the prevailing constitutional conventions. This, together with the absence from London of North (now leader of the ministry) and his brother secretary, Rochford, enabled him to determine Britain's initial response. From the first Weymouth was determined to force Spain to fight or to surrender, believing that British naval superiority could achieve this. Without consulting his cabinet colleagues he set in motion a substantial naval mobilization and adopted an intransigent and bellicose attitude in the diplomatic exchanges with Madrid. By the closing months of 1770 a war over the Falklands appeared very likely, as it was assumed in both London and Madrid that France would support her Spanish ally.<br>
<br>Weymouth's motive for seeking hostilities with Spain was to achieve political supremacy for himself. North, slowly consolidating his own government, was the main obstacle to his dominance. He calculated&#151;perhaps acting at Wood's instigation&#151;that war would bring down the ministry and restore to power the legendary architect of British victories in the Seven Years' War&#151;William Pitt, now earl of Chatham. But Chatham would only be a figurehead in any new ministry, given the extent of his physical and mental collapse, and so Weymouth might expect to wield effective authority. This naked bid for power proved stillborn. George III, whose oversight of the official correspondence enabled him to monitor the southern secretary's actions, realized that the scale of naval preparations would bring about hostilities and acted to preserve peace: in company with most members of the ministry, he wanted a firm stance towards Spain, but he did not wish to force her to fight. Together with North, the king orchestrated cabinet opposition to Weymouth's actions and reassured Bourbon diplomats in London that Britain did not wish a war. During late November and early December the southern secretary's policy was overturned, to his unconcealed fury. After a stormy cabinet meeting on 7 December, Weymouth resigned. North, Rochford, and George III supervised a settlement with Madrid, finally concluded in late January 1771.<br>
<br>One mysterious dimension of Weymouth's resignation in late 1770 is that at some point he received an assurance from the king that he would one day be restored to the southern department. Barely six months after he left office Weymouth, who had not joined the opponents of North's ministry, was mentioned as a possible lord privy seal, should Grafton not accept the post. In the following year he was offered a secretaryship of state, but haughtily declined. His phoenix-like resurgence came during the first half of the War of American Independence (1775&#150;83). In November 1775 he was restored to the southern department, where he remained until his final departure from office in November 1779. The passage of time had done little to remove the shortcomings apparent throughout his whole career. He remained indolent, aloof, and isolated within cabinet, though he acted as a government spokesman in the House of Lords and intermittently intrigued very actively against his colleagues. His earlier hard line towards the Bourbon powers did not immediately resurface after autumn 1775, when it would have been difficult to reconcile with the official policy of maintaining good relations with Versailles and Madrid. When his return to office was being considered, George III had discreetly noted&#151;with one eye firmly on the Falklands episode&#151;that &#145;Lord Weymouth and the Court of Spain cannot pleasantly transact business&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of George III</span>, 3.283). In fact he accommodated himself for a time to the official strategy of conciliating the Bourbon powers in order to facilitate the suppression of the American colonial rebellion.<h2>
<a name="Thedrifttowardswar"></a>The drift towards war</h2>Before long, however, the hostility towards France and Spain re-emerged. Weymouth aligned himself with the earl of Sandwich, who had also followed Bedford during his earlier career. Sandwich, who was first lord of the Admiralty, feared Bourbon intervention in the American struggle and favoured a firm diplomatic and naval response to this threat. The two men were isolated within a cabinet which advocated conciliation of France and Spain. In 1776&#150;7, when Weymouth's attitude was diametrically opposed to the ministry's policy, he was simply bypassed by his own colleagues and by French and Spanish diplomats: the southern secretary ceased to transact relations with the two principal countries within his department, which the complacent viscount happily accepted. His influence on Britain's foreign policy during the American war was slight. Indeed, he found an ingenious way to circumvent his indolence by circulating extracts from the dispatches of the influential ambassador in Paris, Viscount Stormont, as instructions to other British diplomats. This was a unique episode in the history of Britain's eighteenth-century foreign relations and had a coda which was entirely apposite: Stormont succeeded him as southern secretary.<br>
<br>By mid-1777 war with France was believed to be inevitable, and Weymouth's earlier hostility towards the Bourbons now fitted with Britain's overall policy. He could therefore return to a day-to-day role in the conduct of London's diplomacy, which he did from that summer. Yet his impact upon British diplomacy or the wider conduct of the war was minimal, and his commitment to his office no greater than hitherto. This became particularly evident in 1779. The final illness and death of the northern secretary, the earl of Suffolk, made Weymouth for the first nine months of the year <i>de facto</i> foreign secretary, responsible for relations with countries in both departments. Edmund Burke was quick to sneer, noting sarcastically that &#145;The whole of the laborious and arduous correspondence of this Empire rested solely upon the activity and energy of Lord Weymouth&#146;  (Mackesy, 246). Throughout these months Britain's diplomacy was allowed to drift towards the rocks by its inattentive pilot. His principal initiative was a volcanic outburst during an interview with the Spanish ambassador in May 1779. Blending anger and menaces in equal proportions, he censured Madrid's duplicity throughout the colonial rebellion and reversed in one ill-considered outburst a year's careful diplomacy aimed at conciliating Spain. The impact was slight: Madrid's decision to intervene openly on the American side, announced in the summer, had already been made and proceeded from far more fundamental causes. But the episode once more highlighted Weymouth's shortcomings as a foreign minister, apparent throughout his final months in power. One well-placed contemporary, John Robinson, believed that this final phase of neglect proceeded from the viscount already having decided to resign, which he duly did in November when he left office for the last time.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>Weymouth and his wife were established figures at court. The extent of this royal favour was apparent in June 1778, when he was created a knight of the Garter, though he was never to be installed. In August 1789 he was created marquess of Bath. He had served as groom of the stole between March and November 1775, and was reappointed in 1782. Weymouth held the office and the substantial income of &pound;2000 per annum which it conferred until his death, in Arlington Street, London, on 19 November 1796. He was buried at Longbridge Deverill. His eldest son, Thomas Thynne (1765&#150;1837), succeeded to the title; two other sons and five daughters of his marriage survived him. His life was a salutary reminder that a flawed personality and manifold failings as a minister were no obstacle to a career at the highest level of government during the second half of the eighteenth century, provided they were accompanied by sufficient aristocratic pedigree and reinforced by connections at court.<br>
