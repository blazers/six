<span class="headword">Pyne,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1600, <em>d.</em> 1678), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was baptized on 21 February 1600 at East Down near Barnstaple, Devon, the eldest son of Thomas Pyne (<i>d</i>. in or before 1609), gentleman, of Merriott in Somerset, and his wife, Amy, daughter of Thomas Hanham of Wimborne Minster, Dorset. He was heir to his grandfather, John Pyne of Curry Mallet, Somerset, who died in 1609. He matriculated from Hart Hall, Oxford, in February 1610, graduated BA in 1612, and proceeded MA in 1615. He entered the Middle Temple in 1619 and was called to the bar in 1629; he kept chambers until 1637. The influence of his mother's family secured Pyne's election for Poole in Dorset to the parliaments of 1625, 1626, and 1628, but he did little in Westminster. Most of the speeches by &#145;Mr Pyne&#146; in 1628 were almost certainly made by his uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/94296/', "Hugh Pyne")</script>, who was briefly MP for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis. John may have spoken on the <span class="roman">Marriage Bill</span> on 22 April, however; he would have been especially interested, because of difficulties over his intended marriage to his cousin, Eleanor Hanham, with whom he eloped in 1629 and married on 23 April.<br>
<br>In the 1630s Pyne held minor offices in Somerset, but he was not a JP until 1646. He obstructed collection of ship money in 1638 and Poole returned him to both 1640 parliaments. He was regarded as one of the &#145;rigid party&#146; against the king. Named one of parliament's deputy lieutenants in March 1642, he subsequently had an undistinguished military record. Moderately wealthy, he claimed wartime losses of &pound;1000. By 1645 he headed an extreme parliamentarian faction in Somerset, which in the recruiter elections assisted radical candidates. Under his leadership the Somerset county committee became notorious for its vindictiveness. Pyne used it ruthlessly to pursue royalists, harass political opponents, and bully witnesses and minor officials. He promoted county petitions supporting the vote of no addresses, Pride's Purge, and the trial of Charles I. But although named to the high court of justice in January 1649, he stayed away and returned to parliament only after the king's execution. He occasionally attended the Rump Parliament, but his main achievement during the Commonwealth was to govern Somerset successfully. He survived the abolition of the county committee in 1650, and sat in the nominated assembly of 1653, though he was largely inactive as a member. Presbyterian in religion, he was tolerant of other sects, and supported proposals to abolish tithes and remodel the universities. As he was an outspoken critic of the &#145;Instrument of government&#146; the protectorate brought an end to his parliamentary career. He appeared against John Penruddock and his rebels in 1655, but refused any office under Oliver Cromwell, and was badly beaten in the 1656 elections. Nevertheless, he sat in the restored Rump in 1659, and retained his position as a JP throughout the 1650s.<br>
<br>At the Restoration, Pyne took the oath of allegiance but was debarred from holding public office. He was several times imprisoned on suspicion of plotting, but otherwise lived quietly in Curry Mallet. His first wife died some time in or after 1654, and he later married Amy White. He died in 1678, having asked to be buried silently at night. Two sons survived him (Pyne disinherited John, the elder, making the younger, Charles, his heir); a daughter Susannah (Pitts) died in 1676.<br>
