<span class="headword">Kendrick,  James</span>  (1771&#150;1847), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born on 14 January 1771 at Warrington, Lancashire, the town where both his father and grandfather were born. He was educated at Burtonwood grammar school and at Warrington's free grammar school. On leaving school he was apprenticed to a Mr Hankinson, a local &#145;practitioner in surgery of some note in his day&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>). He began practising medicine&#151;as a surgeon&#151;about 1793, and together with his friend Thomas Glazebrook Rylands was instrumental in establishing the Warrington Dispensary.<br>
<br>Although a career, medicine was not Kendrick's passion. In his leisure he studied botany and zoology, and was admitted a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1802. In 1811 he and a group of friends started the first literary and scientific institution in Warrington; Kendrick was made vice-president. He was also part of the &#145;small circle of nature lovers&#146; who founded the Warrington Natural History Society on 23 November 1838. At the time of his death Kendrick was president of the society, which subsequently provided material to form the nucleus of the Warrington Museum and Library. Kendrick was one of the chief founding benefactors of the museum&#151;others included William Beamont, William Robson, and John Fitchett Marsh.<br>
<br>Kendrick was president of the Botanical Society of Warrington, and contributed observations and notes to George Crosfield's <span class="italic">A Calendar of Flora, Composed during the Year 1809, at Warrington, Latitude 53&deg; 30'</span> (1810). Kendrick was well acquainted with the philanthropist John Howard and gave much assistance to James Baldwin Brown in his <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Public and Private Life of John Howard</span> (1818)&#151;in which Kendrick was described as &#145;the successor of Dr [John] Aikin&#146;. The botanist Thomas Nuttall (1786&#150;1859) named the <i>Rhododendron kendrickii</i> (imported into England in 1852 from Bhutan) after him. Kendrick's wish &#145;to die quietly at the close of a day's work&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>) was fulfilled when he died on 30 November 1847, at Stanley Street, Warrington. He was buried on 6 December at St Elphin's Church, Warrington (with the simple inscription &#145;Kendrick&#146; to mark his grave). He was married and is known to have been survived by two sons and several daughters.<br>
<br>Kendrick's eldest son, <a name="cosubject_15355"></a><span class="headword">James Kendrick</span>  (1809&#150;1882), <span class="occ">local historian and topographer</span>, was born on 7 November 1809, at the corner of Orford and Buttermarket streets, Warrington. He was educated at Mr Davenport's School (then located in Golborne Street), Warrington, and he also attended a school in Mersey Street, which was run by the Revd Topping, curate at the parish church.<br>
<br>Kendrick began his medical career with his father and served an apprenticeship at the Warrington Dispensary in Buttermarket Street. About 1828 he moved to Edinburgh where he graduated MD on 1 August 1833 with a thesis entitled <span class="italic">On the Dependence of Diabetes Mellitus on Disease of the Stomach and Intestines</span>. Soon after Kendrick returned to Warrington where he began to practise medicine from 1833; about 1850 he acted as physician to Mr Lyon's family, at Appleton Hall. On 21 July 1837 Kendrick married Isabella Anne (<i>d</i>. 23 July 1863), the only child of Robert Berry, a merchant formerly of Port Louis, Mauritius (afterwards consul for Sweden and Norway in China, where he resided at Macau), and his wife, Ann Mary; this marriage resulted in nine children, five of whom survived their father. The year after his first wife's death, on 19 October 1864, he married Martha (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1873), third daughter of Thomas Green of Warrington and sister-in-law to Benjamin Pierpoint, of the same town; this marriage was childless. In 1874 he married his third wife, Catherine, daughter of William Burgess of Frodsham, and sister of Alderman John Burgess; their marriage was also childless.<br>
<br>Kendrick had a fondness for antiquities and frequently lectured on local topography and history. He issued a series of &#145;Contributions to the early history of Warrington&#146; in the <span class="italic">Manchester Courier</span> (1839&#150;40; 1851) and wrote many papers which appeared in the publications of the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire, Chester Archaeological Society, the <span class="italic">Reliquary</span>, and the <span class="italic">Warrington Guardian</span>. In 1853 he became a member of the British Archaeological Association.<br>
<br>Kendrick wrote a number of other publications including: <span class="italic">An Account of Warrington Siege, anno 1643</span> (1852; 1856); <span class="italic">A Description of Two Ancient Chessmen, Discovered in the Mote Hill, Warrington</span> (1852); <span class="italic">Profiles of Warrington Worthies</span> (1853; 1854); <span class="italic">An Account of Excavations Made at the Mote Hill, Warrington</span> (1853); <span class="italic">Account of the Loyal Warrington Volunteers of 1798</span> (1854; 1856); <span class="italic">A Morning's Ramble in Old Warrington</span> (1855); and <span class="italic">The Warrington Blue Coat School Exposure, and its Beneficial Results</span> (1868).<br>
<br>In 1869 Kendrick wrote <span class="italic">On the Roman Station at Wilderspool, Near Warrington</span> (1870). He spent much time and money on the excavation of this site and on 15 August 1870 it was reported that Kendrick had presented an extensive collection of Roman artefacts found there to the Warrington Museum. In 1871 he released <span class="italic">On Recent Discoveries at the Roman Site at Wilderspool</span>, and a year later compiled <span class="italic">A Guide Book to the Roman Remains from Wilderspool</span>, which was presented to the museum. He was also co-author, with William Robson, of <span class="italic">Memorials of the Late Dr. Robson, of Warrington: his Life and Writings</span> (1876).<br>
<br>In 1859 Kendrick took charge of the antiquities in the Warrington Museum; he subsequently contributed many items to the collections, including an important series of impressions from German imperial seals. In 1878, he donated some 1000 books and pamphlets to the Warrington Free Library. Kendrick died on 6 April 1882 at his home, 27 Bold Street, Warrington. His remains were interred beside other members of his family in Padgate churchyard on 11 April 1882; present at his funeral were his third wife, two daughters, and two sons.<br>
