<span class="headword">Swire,  John Samuel</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em> the Senior]</span>  (1825&#150;1898), <span class="occ">merchant and shipowner</span>, was born in Liverpool on 24 December 1825, the eldest son of John Swire (1793&#150;1847), merchant, and Maria Louisa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Roose (<i>c</i>.1794&#150;1858). His father had founded the family import&#150;export business in Liverpool about 1816, and it became John Swire &amp; Sons in 1832. At his death in 1847 the elder Swire left equal shares in the firm, and capital to the value of &pound;1000 each, to John Samuel and his younger brother, William Hudson Swire (1830&#150;1884).<br>
<br>During his youth Swire sought physical adventure; in maturity he sought fulfilment in business. He spent five months in the American west in 1849, and in September 1854 he sailed for Australia to seek his fortune, working at diggings in New South Wales before founding a branch of the family firm in Melbourne. This episode exhibited two of his most salient personal characteristics: tenacity and commercial long-sightedness. A quick fortune eluded him, however, and he returned to resume his responsibilities in Liverpool; his brother, plagued by ill health, had been finding it difficult to cope with the business on his own.<br>
<br>One of Swire's first acts on returning to Britain was, on 15 November 1859, to marry Helen Abigail (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1837), daughter of Adam Fairrie, a member of a notable sugar-refining family. She died at sea, however, on holiday in the Bay of Smyrna, on 5 May 1862, after only thirty months of marriage, leaving one child, John (Jack) Swire (1861&#150;1933). Swire, shocked by the blow, retreated into the world of work. In the first two decades after the death of their father, the Swire brothers built up their business, establishing a solid presence in New York and Australia, and widening the range of goods they traded. Wine was imported from Le Havre, bottled Guinness was shipped to Australia, and raw cotton was acquired from the United States. By 1867, after twenty years of slow, steady growth, they had placed their enterprise on a secure foundation, sharply symbolized by their removal of the firm's head office to London that year. Swire bought out his brother's share of the company in 1876, but for many years before that the development and fortunes of the firm had been directed by the iron hand of the Senior (as he was nicknamed).<br>
<br>Swire is chiefly remembered as the great interloper among the foreign firms trading on the China coast, arriving late on the scene at the close of the decades of war and rebellion, and barging his way forcefully and quickly into a position of great prominence. The gentlemanly traders, Jardine Mathesons (the &#145;Princely Hong&#146;), Dents, and Russell &amp; Co., found their interests and ambitions sharply challenged by the upstart newcomer from the bourgeois English north-west. Unlike most firms already there, Swires was untarred by association with the illegal opium trade; it was also healthily interested in pursuing good relations with prospective Chinese customers. The sight of Swire employees entertaining Chinese merchants frankly appalled their foreign competitors.<br>
<br>Swires had initially sought new markets in China and Japan because of the disruption of the cotton trade after 1861 by the civil war in the United States. Ten years of extraordinary expansion of those business activities were quietly heralded by John Swire's arrival in Shanghai on 28 November 1866. Within a week of his landing Swire established a branch of the firm in a partnership (dissolved two years later) with Richard Shackleton Butterfield (<i>d</i>. 1879). Initially trading in tea, silk, and imports of cotton and piece-goods, the firm of Butterfield and Swire&#151;Taikoo (from a local term meaning &#145;ancient and honourable&#146;)&#151;became identified with interests as diverse as shipping, sugar, and insurance. After opening a second branch in Yokohama, Swire returned overland to Britain in mid-1867.<br>
<br>The key to Swire's success in China lay in his network of international contacts, and especially in his firm's close long-term association with the Ocean Steam Ship Company&#151;the Blue Funnel Line&#151;owned by fellow Liverpudlians Alfred and Philip Holt. Swire was an initial investor in the enterprise in 1865 and Taikoo first became Blue Funnel's Shanghai agents, in 1868, and then took on the Hong Kong agency, in 1870. Swire's influence on the Ocean Steam Ship Company's growth was great, and his loyalty solid; his was the broader vision which the Holts lacked; his too was the initiative behind the shipping conferences which regulated competition and unified Far Eastern shipping interests. The relationship was, of course, mutually beneficial: Blue Funnel ships were fed goods and passengers by the Swire-managed China Navigation Company (CNC), which operated on the Yangtze (Yangzi) River.<br>
<br>The story of CNC pointedly illustrates Swire's business approach. Close supervision of costs, tenacity, and patient long-term planning were combined with a willingness to take risks that others often considered foolish, and to drop schemes that went wrong. The capital for the firm was raised in London in 1872. Two existing ships were acquired for service on the Yangtze, and a further three ordered. By virtue, initially, of a fierce rates war, and latterly of rigid conference schemes, Swire built up the firm, forcing Russells to leave the river and holding his own against Jardines and other competitors. The company's progress illustrates the Senior's gritty idealism: CNC, he believed, deserved a fair share of an expanding trade that could easily support all the competing firms, and so Swire set out to seize that share. By 1883 CNC had twenty ships, and by 1894 it was the largest of the Yangtze shipping fleets with twenty-nine; by 1900 it boasted fifty ships and extensive shore properties, and the company had also established a successful presence in China's coastal trade. Unlike other companies John Swire &amp; Sons kept out of treaty-port politics, and their voice was rarely heard in the special-pleading, China-lobbying groups; both activities diverted attention away from business, which remained the Senior's key passion.<br>
<br>While Swire's success depended partly on the quality of the men he employed and on the loyalty that his rigorously fair, but absolutely uncompromising, manner engendered, he also kept a close personal eye on activities and personalities in China and elsewhere. He travelled back out to Asia four more times and also revisited Australia twice, and built up the firm relentlessly. When not riding to hounds, or spying out possible horse purchases, he lived and talked business in the 1860s and 1870s. Wealth was not the spur, and he could have retired comfortably when his brother William chose to.<br>
<br>&#145;I have always gone in for <i>glory</i>, and not &pound; &amp; d&#146;, Swire wrote to his prospective second wife in 1881  (Swire to Warren, 24 July 1881, Swire Archives). Lonely since Helen's death it was with some trepidation and great reticence that he embarked on the courtship of Mary (<i>c</i>.1851&#150;1918), the daughter of George Warren, a Liverpool shipowner. They married on 18 October 1881, and had one child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39473/', "(George) Warren Swire (1883&#150;1949)")</script>. In 1884 the couple moved to Leighton House, in Leighton Buzzard, where they were associated with various philanthropic ventures; apart from hunting, however, Swire played no active role in local public affairs.<br>
<br>The Senior never relinquished control over the company; and it was only some years after his death that his partners began to inaugurate projects he had previously opposed. In the last decade of his life rheumatoid arthritis caused him much pain, not least the tedium of spa visits to alleviate his suffering. Ill health failed to stop his frequent touring in Europe, but his beloved horse-riding came to an end in 1894. In November 1898 Swire was confined to bed for three weeks with a severe attack of arthritis. On 1 December he died of heart failure, at his London home, 31 Pembridge Square. He was buried at All Saints' Church, Leighton Buzzard, on 6 December 1898. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
