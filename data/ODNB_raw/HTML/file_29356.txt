<span class="headword">Preston,  Roland</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Thomas; <em>pseud. </em>Roger Widdrington]</span>  (1567&#150;1647), <span class="occ">Benedictine monk</span>, was born in January 1567, probably in Shropshire, though his family are unidentified. He matriculated from Magdalen Hall, Oxford, on 22 December 1576, but he did not take his degree, which may imply that he was a Catholic recusant. In 1586 he went with other students via Allen's English College at Douai (which was temporarily taking wartime shelter in Rheims) to the new English College in Rome. He was already a priest when he entered the Benedictine noviciate at Monte Cassino, where he was professed under the name Thomas on 16 June 1592. Some time later he was transferred to the abbey of Santa Justina at Padua, and may have spent time at San Giorgio, Venice. If so, this helps to explain his later somewhat Gallican view of the church, for there was a good deal of tension between Venice and the papacy at this time. He was well thought of by the superiors of the Cassinese congregation and was employed in teaching theology, being evidently an able man.<br>
<br>In late 1602 the pope agreed, after no little delay, to allow English monks from the Cassinese and Spanish congregations to travel to England as missionaries: the first two Cassinese were Preston and Anselm Beech, who landed at Great Yarmouth in 1603. Here they met, probably by arrangement, Sigebert Buckley, the last survivor of the community of Westminster restored under Queen Mary, who was living with the Woodhouses at Caston, Norfolk. They made arrangements for him to live in London in reasonable comfort. There on 21 November 1607, Buckley was able to aggregate to himself Robert Sadler and Edward Maihew, two newly professed Cassinese monks. They represented (at least in the opinion of the lawyer&#150;monk Augustine Baker, who was present) the entirety of the rights, property, and privileges of the English congregation as it had existed up to the dissolution. It is not clear that Preston was actually present, but he is included in Buckley's list of four monks through whom Buckley extended his handing on of rights to others whom they had received as monks. In fact Preston was the superior for the Cassinese monks working in England for many years.<br>
<br>Preston is known chiefly for his involvement in the disputes about the oath of allegiance, devised in 1606, with the intention of securing a body of Catholics whom the government could consider loyal subjects, and of aiding James I's aspirations towards Christian unity, but opposed by Rome and most Catholic leaders. Preston addressed the issue in his <span class="italic">Apologia cardinalis Bellarmini pro jure principum</span> (1611), utilizing the probabilism absorbed from his theology teachers in Rome, chiefly the Jesuit Gabriel Vasquez. With Rome slow to make any definite decision he pressed the claim that Catholics could take the oath since there was no definite prohibition or, if there was, there was also a body of theological opinion which would allow the oath, leaving the matter merely &#145;probable&#146;.<br>
<br>The issue was for many a genuine question, and it generated a European field of publications for several years, in which leading figures like James I and Cardinal Bellarmine took a vigorous part. It is thought that Preston's argument, that the pope's power to depose princes was not <i>de fide</i>, and need not be held by every Catholic (though abhorrent to the Jesuit-inspired zeal of the Counter-Reformation), was very convenient to the government, and attractive to James himself in his promotion of conciliarism and European peace. Thus the government was content to keep Preston for over thirty years in relative comfort in the Clink prison, and he was content to be able to write (and operate in some part as a priest), his imprisonment shielding him from direct interference by the Inquisition.<br>
<br>Preston wrote a series of works, mostly in the decade 1611&#150;21, under a pseudonym, Roger Widdrington. The real Widdrington was a keenly recusant minor landlord in Northumberland, a useful front who, because of his remoteness, would not be likely to come to much harm. The general weight of opinion and probability, now as in his own time, is that there was, and is, no real doubt that Preston, not Widdrington, was the author. Widdrington was somewhat unconvincing in this guise as an energetic writer and learned controversialist, but there seems to have been at least friendship, and perhaps co-operation, between the two.<br>
<br>Preston continued to publish on the oath controversy, often as responses to opponents, and in both Latin and English. He was an able and courteous controversialist, and was regarded with considerable respect by Bellarmine, Suarez, and others, who took his position and influence very seriously. Rome several times tried to get him to toe the line, working through people like Panzani, the papal envoy (himself not unsympathetic to Preston's position on the oath), and several of his works finished up on the <span class="italic">Index</span>, the first in 1614. He responded to his works' condemnation in <span class="italic">A Copy of a Decree</span> (1614), with an appendix directed against the Jesuit Thomas Fitzherbert. He renewed his appeal to Rome with the lengthy Latin <span class="italic">Rogeri Widdringtoni &hellip; supplicatio</span> (1616), published with a lengthy appendix responding to Bellarmine's accusations, but placed on the <span class="italic">Index</span>. He continued to publish in English, and in his &#145;short and plain&#146; <span class="italic">A New-Yeares Gift for English Catholikes</span> (1620) &#145;abandoned his uncommitted attitude and told the faithful that they would risk damnation if they refused the oath&#146; since the doctrine of deposition of princes was heretical  (Lunn, <span class="italic">English Benedictines</span>, 50&#150;51). With mounting pressure upon him he appealed to Rome with his 1620 <span class="italic">Appellatio</span> and his 1621 <span class="italic">Reverendorum partum D. Thomae Prestoni &hellip; humillima supplicatio</span>. He appears to have submitted, and not to have published further. As a forerunner of ecumenism Preston had tried to make accommodation possible.<br>
<br>Preston's later years are unclear. There is in existence a royal warrant which gave him licence to live outside the Clink, being by this time an old man. In 1646 he appealed to parliament after pursuivants had raided his rooms in the Clink and removed all his books and possessions, which on a previous occasion (1634) had amounted to five or six cartloads of books, with many other valuables. For thirty-three years, he said, he had been a prisoner there, writing in the king's service, to his discredit in Rome, and now he was &#145;not able to cloath and uncloath himself without help&#146;. Indeed shortly afterwards he caught fever and died, either in the Clink or nearby, in the spring of 1647.<br>
