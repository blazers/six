<span class="headword">Cheney,  Christopher Robert</span>  (1906&#150;1987), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born on 20 December 1906 in Banbury, Oxfordshire, the youngest of four sons (there were no daughters) of George Gardner Cheney, director of a family printing business established in the eighteenth century, and his wife, Christina Stapleton Bateman, schoolteacher. It was a close-knit family, with strong musical interests which he shared. He was educated at Banbury county school and Wadham College, Oxford, where he won the Gibbs scholarship in 1927, and took a first-class degree in modern history in 1928. He then began research in medieval English ecclesiastical history under F. M. Powicke. After spells of lecturing in Cairo, then University College, London (1931&#150;3), and Manchester University (1933&#150;7), in 1937 he succeeded V. H. Galbraith as reader in diplomatic in Oxford and became a fellow of Magdalen College. He returned to Manchester as professor of medieval history in 1945, moving to Cambridge in 1955 on his election to the chair of medieval history, which he held until his retirement in 1972, and to a fellowship at Corpus Christi College. During the Second World War he worked in the War Office with MI5.<br>
<br>Cheney's greatest achievement was to lead the way in interpreting the records and history of the medieval English church, and of the relations of the papacy with England, and in furthering the collaborative enterprises, both national and international, necessary to publish the original sources. His upbringing gave him a lasting interest in the practical process of making books, and he always took delight in good craftsmanship and typographical perfection.<br>
<br>Cheney's university lectures were the seeding ground for many of his published works. His Oxford courses on diplomatic led to his <span class="italic">Notaries Public in the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries</span> (1972) and to his writings on English episcopal documents. These involved him in two major collaborative enterprises. A project to produce an edition of the corpus of medieval church councils, inspired by Powicke, was in danger of running into the quicksands of planning committees when he took control, brought out, and part edited one volume (1964), and assisted substantially in the completion of another. Later he directed and contributed to the British Academy series of <span class="roman">Episcopal Acta</span>. The field he made particularly his own was the age of Innocent III, especially the great pope's relations with England. Critical examination of Innocent's letters concerning England led to two definitive volumes of documents (1953 and, with Mary Cheney, 1967). These provided the groundwork for his Ford lectures, <span class="italic">From Becket to Langton</span> (1956), his monograph on Hubert Walter (1967), and his fine book <span class="italic">Pope Innocent III and England</span> (1976). All were remarkable for the lucidity, sanity, and breadth of imagination and knowledge they revealed.<br>
<br>A penetrating but never unjust critic, Cheney was an inspiring if exacting teacher, remembered for his inflexibly high standards, and for his kindness and humour, which, together with intelligence and imagination, were reflected in his face. His originality lay in going more deeply and critically, more precisely and less credulously, into the written materials preserved in archives and other collections. In the memorable words of his Cambridge inaugural lecture, he pointed out that &#145;Records, like the little children of long ago, only speak when they are spoken to, and they will not speak to strangers.&#146; No one was better able than he to penetrate the minds of the men behind the medieval institutions that he described almost as if he had been there when they were being fashioned. He brought to historical study in England a mastery of the techniques of research in which English scholars hitherto had lagged behind continental writers. At the same time, his deeper penetration into the practical application of the jurisdiction of the medieval church in England provided a model for their future researches. Closely associated with Walther Holzmann, who worked in English archives on the ambitious <span class="roman">Papsturkunden</span> project sponsored by the G&ouml;ttingen Academy, he carried his own researches on collections of papal decretals and the work of judges delegate in England to a point that has inspired French and German scholars to begin filling in gaps in the <span class="roman">Papsturkunden in Frankreich</span> series. As joint literary editor of the Royal Historical Society (1938&#150;45), he guided many scholars' work to publication.<br>
<br>Cheney was appointed CBE in 1984. In 1951 he was elected a fellow of the British Academy; other academic honours included honorary doctorates at Glasgow (DLitt, 1970) and Manchester (DLitt, 1978), and election as a corresponding fellow of the Mediaeval Academy of America and corresponding member of the <span class="roman">Monumenta Germaniae Historica</span>. Wadham College made him an honorary fellow in 1968.<br>
<br>Cheney was a small man with dark hair and an impish glance. In 1940 he married Mary Gwendolen (daughter of Gilbert Hall, of the Malayan civil service), a historian who collaborated with him in two of his books and supported him in his research all his life. There were two sons and one daughter of the marriage. Cheney died in Cambridge on 19 June 1987.<br>
