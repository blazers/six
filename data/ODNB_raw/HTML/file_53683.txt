<span class="headword">Franklin <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Montagu]</span>,  Henrietta <span class="st"> [Netta]</span></span>  (1866&#150;1964), <span class="occ">educationist and suffragist</span>, was born on 9 April 1866 in London, the first of the eleven surviving children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35076/', "Samuel Montagu, later first Baron Swaythling (1832&#150;1911)")</script>, foreign-exchange banker and Jewish philanthropist, and his wife, Ellen Cohen (1848&#150;1919). Her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35074/', "Edwin Montagu")</script> was sometime secretary of state for India. She was educated at home, at Doreck College, and at King's College for Ladies, London. On 7 October 1885 she married her cousin Ernest Louis Franklin (1860&#150;1950), financier son of the banker Ellis Franklin and Adelaide Montagu, in the New West End Synagogue, Bayswater. Between 1886 and 1903 she gave birth to four sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>The decisive, inspiring experience for Henrietta Franklin and her life's work was her encounter, in 1890, with the educational reformer Charlotte Mason, founder of the child-centred Parents' National Educational Union (PNEU), which focused on liberal pre-school and primary education as a collaborative effort by mothers and teachers. Henrietta Franklin was honorary organizing secretary for the PNEU, 1894&#150;1964, and in 1892 started the first PNEU school in London. The movement affirmed every child's right to be respected as a unique personality (its motto being: &#145;I am, I can, I ought, I will&#146;) and to have access to a &#145;generous curriculum&#146; including nature study, poetry, religion, art, carpentry, gymnastics, and music. A tireless publicist and organizer for the validity of Charlotte Mason's educational philosophy and praxis as a teacher trainer, it was Henrietta Franklin who ensured that the PNEU achieved national and international exposure, not least through her writing and public lecture tours (which included most of the capitals of Europe, North America, and, in 1923, South Africa), as well as through her gift for consolidating the national network and by means of her own personal wealth.<br>
<br>In religion Henrietta Franklin differed from her Orthodox father and husband and supported her sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40837/', "Lily Montagu")</script> in the establishment of a Liberal Jewish path that focused on the spirit rather than on the letter of the law. This Liberal Judaism, influenced by the thought of Claude Montefiore, stressed ethics as the core of Jewish life and inaugurated a new form of religious service in which men and women sat together, prayers and hymns were in English, and which eventually enabled Lily Montagu to officiate as the first woman lay minister and preacher at a Liberal Jewish service. Together with her sister Lily, Henrietta Franklin published <span class="italic">Daily Readings from the Old Testament</span> in 1922, stressing those psalms and passages in <span class="roman">Isaiah</span>, <span class="roman">Ezekiel</span>, <span class="roman">Job</span>, and <span class="roman">Zechariah</span> that affirm the unity of man and peace as the culmination of the religious ideal.<br>
<br>Henrietta Franklin's feminism was manifest not only in her Liberal Judaism but also in her political activism. She was an early member of the National Council of Women, and became both its vice-president and its president. She was a committed suffragist, being on the executive committee of the Jewish League for Woman Suffrage formed in 1912 and later chair of the National Council for Equal Citizenship. In 1915 she served on the executive committee of the Women's Municipal Party which encouraged the candidature of women for the London county council and London borough councils. During the First World War Henrietta Franklin was one of the courageous, unpopular &#145;pacifist feminists&#146; who supported the Women's International Congress at The Hague in 1915, aiming firstly to demand that international disputes should in future be settled by some other means than war and, secondly, to claim that women should have a voice in the affairs of the nations. She was also a signatory to the open Christmas letter to German women drafted by Emily Hobhouse in December 1914, and a financial supporter of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom.<br>
<br>Henrietta Franklin, or Netta, was a very able woman of immense force of character and phenomenal, restless energy. Rather than being content to become a mere society hostess, she gave herself totally to many causes of liberal progress. She could never feel that she had learned enough or had filled a day to the uttermost. For the last fifty-three years of her life she had had to fulfil all her commitments with an artificial leg. &#145;Well, I would sooner lose a leg than an arm,&#146; she said. In 1950 she was made CBE. Henrietta Franklin died on 7 January 1964 at her home, 88 Carlton Hill, St John's Wood, London. Her monument is the longevity of the PNEU.<br>
