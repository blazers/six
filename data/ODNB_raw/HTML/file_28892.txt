<span class="headword">Watts,  Robert</span>  (1820&#150;1895), <span class="occ">minister of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland and theological writer</span>, was born at Moneylane, near Castlewellan, co. Down, on 10 July 1820, the youngest of fourteen children of a Presbyterian farmer. He was educated at the parish school of Kilmegan, co. Down, and at the Royal Academical Institution, Belfast. In 1848 he went to America, where he graduated at Washington College (now Washington and Lee University), Lexington, Virginia, in 1849 and studied theology at Princeton Theological Seminary under Charles Hodge DD (1797&#150;1878). He organized a Presbyterian mission at Philadelphia in 1852, gathered a congregation in Franklin House Hall, was ordained its pastor in 1853, and obtained the erection in 1856 of Westminster Church for its use. He got into a controversy over Arminianism with Albert Barnes (1798&#150;1870), a Philadelphia Presbyterian of liberal views. On a visit to Ireland he accepted a call to Lower Gloucester Street congregation, Dublin, and was installed there in August 1863. During a previous visit to Ireland in 1853 he had married Margaret, daughter of William Newell of Summerhill, Downpatrick, co. Down. They had two sons and two daughters. The eldest son, Robert Watts, was Presbyterian minister of Kilmacrenan, co. Donegal, and died on 4 December 1889. The two daughters married Presbyterian ministers.<br>
<br>On the death of John Edgar in 1866, Watts was elected to the chair of systematic theology in the Assembly's College, Belfast. He was a keen theologian, of very conservative views, opposed to the tendencies of the late nineteenth century's so-called higher criticism, and especially to the influence of German exegesis. He studied the then current speculations with some care and in a spirit of uncompromising antagonism. His writings were acceptable to the older minds in his denomination, and were in some measure successful in combating the new theological views. He helped to give the college a reputation for vigorous Calvinism. However, in matters where he considered that no theological interest was involved he was not so conservative; he advocated the use of instrumental music in public worship, though this was against the general sentiment of Irish presbyterians.<br>
<br>Watts held the chair of moderator of the general assembly from 1879 to 1880 and was a representative at the pan-Presbyterian councils in the 1870s and 1880s. His literary output was extensive. His works often addressed the new forms of criticism and other theological and doctrinal issues. These include: <span class="italic">The New Apologetic</span> (1879), <span class="italic">The Rule of Faith and the Doctrine of Inspiration</span> (1885), and <span class="italic">The Sovereignty of God</span> (1894). He was also a regular contributor to periodicals. After the close of the college session in April 1895, his health completely broke down. He died at College Park, Belfast, on 26 July 1895, and was buried on 29 July in the city cemetery.<br>
