<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Manton,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1620, <em>d.</em> 1677), <span class="occ">nonconformist minister</span>, was baptized on 31 March 1620 at Lydeard St Lawrence, Somerset, where his father, Thomas Manton of Whimple in Devon, was probably curate.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlyclericalcareer"></a>Education and early clerical career</h2>Manton was educated at the free school in Tiverton, Devon, and on 11 March 1636 matriculated as a plebeian from Wadham College, Oxford. He graduated BA from Hart Hall, Oxford, on 15 June 1639, proceeded BD from Wadham on 20 April 1654 (the degree was incorporated at Cambridge in 1658), and was created DD at Oxford on 19 November 1660. Bishop Joseph Hall ordained Manton to the diaconate in 1640, although his leanings towards presbyterianism prevented him from seeking further ordination. Anthony Wood, the Anglican polemicist of the 1680s, alleged that Bishop Galloway ordained Manton to the priesthood in 1660. The balance of probabilities is against this assertion; Edmund Calamy states, on the basis of Josias Hill's testimony, that it was Manton's &#145;judgement that he was properly ordained to the ministerial office, and that no powers on earth had any right to divide and parcel that out at their pleasure&#146;  (Calamy).<br>
<br>Until September 1643 Manton was lecturer to the parish church of Sowton, near Exeter, where he married Mary Morgan (<i>d</i>. 1701) of Sidbury on 15 May 1643. After Exeter fell to royalist forces on 4 September the Mantons were forced to move first to Lyme and then to Colyton. Further royalist advances led Manton to decide to flee the west altogether, and in July 1645 he moved to London, where he was installed by Alexander Popham, the godly MP and parliamentarian colonel, as rector of St Mary's, Stoke Newington.<h2>
<a name="Animpassionedpresbyterian"></a>An impassioned presbyterian</h2>During the late 1640s Manton was involved in the campaign to establish presbyterianism in the London region. He established the government at St Mary's, Stoke Newington, in 1646 and was joined by Alexander Popham as the parish's ruling elder. Manton was a committed member of the eighth London classis and was often a delegate to the London provincial assembly, which gave him the task of persuading the ministers of the failed eleventh classis to set up church government.<br>
<br>Manton's ministry at Stoke Newington was a model of rigorous evangelical Calvinism; in particular he preached long expository sermons of the epistles of both <span class="roman">James</span> and <span class="roman">Jude</span>. In so doing he caught the attention of the House of Commons and, in the troubled years of 1647&#150;8, was twice invited to preach at official parliamentary fasts. He ostensibly chose moderate themes for both of these sermons. On 30 June 1647, at the peak of the crisis between the army and the City of London, Manton preached <span class="italic">Meate out of the Eater, or, Hopes of Unity in and by Divided Times</span>, a sermon on <span class="roman">Zechariah</span> 14: 9. In his epistle to the Commons he stated that the purpose of the sermon was &#145;<i>to reduce men from their</i> violences <i>&amp;</i> extremities <i>to some better</i> temper <i>and</i> moderation&#146;. The main thrust of the sermon, however, was that parliament should establish presbyterianism as the official church system in England and allow only a modicum of accommodation for dissenting opinion.<br>
<br>On 28 June 1648, during the second civil war, Manton was again invited to preach before the Commons. His sermon, entitled <span class="italic">England's Spiritual Languishings; with the Causes and Cure</span>, was on <span class="roman">Revelation</span> 2: 3 and had as its doctrine &#145;That a speciall way to save a Church and people from imminent and speedy ruine is the repairing of decayed godlynesse&#146;. He bemoaned the fact that religion had become the &#145;stalking horse to every selfe seeking designe&#146; and once again asked parliament to settle presbyterianism as a means to rectify England's sins. Appalled by Pride's Purge and the trial of Charles I, in January 1649 he was a signatory to the London presbyterians' printed protests about both addressed to Lord General Fairfax. Manton also joined the ministers of the London provincial assembly in private fasts convened to seek the guidance of God about the revolutionary events. He preached a sermon for this purpose to the assembly on 6 February 1649.<h2>
<a name="Commonwealthcareer"></a>Commonwealth career</h2>During the first three years of the republic the London presbyterians plotted against the regicides' regime for the return of Charles II and the solemn league and covenant. The result of this plotting was the arrest, trial, and condemnation of Christopher Love for treason in the summer of 1651. In August 1652 Manton joined Edmund Calamy and Simeon Ashe in spiritually preparing Love for his execution. Manton intended to preach at Love's public funeral, but when this was forbidden by parliament, who feared rebellion, he was forced to give his oration to a midnight audience at Love's parish of St Lawrence Jewry. Despite the threatening presence of the army a correspondent noted that &#145;a mighty throng of people&#146; gathered to hear him. He lectured on <span class="roman">1 Corinthians</span> 15: 57 and applied the text in a Calvinist manner against Love's persecutors. Manton used the logic of predestination to interpret the passage, holding that it revealed a &#145;terror for wicked men&#146; as &#145;none but a childe of God can have true and solid courage against death&#146;. In condemning those who had executed Love, Manton equated the republic to the Babylonian tyranny of Belshazzar in the book of <span class="roman">Daniel</span>.<br>
<br>Although Manton refused to co-operate with the republic's government his star was in the ascendancy during the protectorate of Oliver Cromwell, and on 20 March 1654 he was appointed one of the commissioners for the approbation of public preachers, or &#145;triers&#146;. The state papers show that he was often called upon to perform this duty. In April 1654 he joined his fellow presbyterians Edmund Calamy, Stephen Marshall, Simeon Ashe, and Richard Vines for talks on accommodation with the congregationalists Joseph Caryl, Philip Nye, Sidrach Simpson, Samuel Slater, and William Carter. He also joined the senior presbyterian and Independent ministers of Oxford, Cambridge, and London in signing a letter recommending John Durie in his mission to create unity among European protestants.<br>
<br>Manton's willingness to seek accommodation with the congregationalist clergy meant that he became the principal presbyterian voice on protectorate committees discussing religious matters. In October 1654 he was chosen for the committee convened to help resolve the rift in the Church of Scotland between the resolutioners and the remonstranters. In November that year a parliamentary subcommittee chose Manton to join ministers such as Thomas Goodwin, John Owen, Henry Jessey, and Richard Baxter to agree on the fundamentals of religion that would be essential for subscription to the protectorate church. He also sat with the council of state in November 1655 to hear Menasseh ben Israel's proposals for the readmission of the Jews into England.<br>
<br>Manton's connections with the protectorate earned him high appointment. He was chosen to be lecturer at Westminster Abbey on 18 January 1656, and on 21 December following the earl of Bedford called him to be admitted as rector of St Paul's, Covent Garden, whose congregation also included Oliver St John and Sir William Fleetwood. Manton was keen to establish presbyterian discipline at St Paul's, but the policy was resisted by his parishioners, as well as by his assistant Abraham Pinchbecke. Despite his presbyterianism he showed charity to clergymen of other persuasions; in May 1658 the Anglican diarist John Evelyn recalled that Manton arranged a collection for the &#145;Anglican&#146; clergy sequestered during the civil war. He was also nominated an assistant to the Middlesex commission on 24 October 1657. When Oliver Cromwell was offered the crown by parliament in the same year, Manton was chosen alongside John Owen, Joseph Caryl, Philip Nye, and George Gillespie to pray with the lord protector in order to help him seek God's guidance in making a decision. Although Cromwell finally refused the crown Manton was chosen to deliver the public blessing at the inauguration of the second protectorate parliament in June.<h2>
<a name="Thesearchforaccommodationandejection"></a>The search for accommodation and ejection</h2>Manton welcomed the protectorate of Richard Cromwell and its call for unity among the orthodox godly clergy. On the opening day of Richard's ill-fated parliament Manton wrote to Richard Baxter about the possibility of calling an assembly of divines to seek agreement between presbyterians and Independents, a suggestion Baxter opposed on grounds that agreement was unlikely. When the army deposed Cromwell, Manton joined his fellow presbyterians in seeking the restoration of Charles II and was one of the divines who attended Charles at Breda. He was also one of the ministers deputed to give the oath of loyalty to the king on his procession through London in May 1660. Despite these overtures to the king Manton's belief in the need for a godly and disciplined church did not wane. In 1660 he joined his fellow ministers in signing the <span class="italic">Seasonable exhortation &hellip; to the people of their respective congregations</span>, warning of the dangers of popery and heresy. He was also a co-signatory with Edmund Calamy and other London presbyterians in writing a private letter to brethren in Scotland, warning of the threat to the godly cause from the restoration of episcopacy and the Anglican liturgy.<br>
<br>Manton's connection with the king meant that he received some favour in the early days of the Restoration. He was officially instituted at St Paul's, Covent Garden, on 10 January 1661, although some of his parishioners petitioned the bishop of London to make him read the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. Despite his opposition to the ceremonies Manton reluctantly complied with the bishop's orders.<br>
<br>With the re-establishment of episcopacy the moderate presbyterian ministers sought to use their favour at court to remodel the national church in the Reformed mould. In 1660 Manton republished the 1641 work of the presbyterian ministers who wrote under the eponym &#145;Smectymnuus&#146;. This was an extremely provocational act as the work argued that in the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> the Greek words for &#145;bishop&#146; and &#145;priest&#146; were used synonymously. Smectymnuus claimed that this proved that the hierarchy between bishop and priest was false and thus a sinful human innovation. Manton stated in his epistle, &#145;if the quarrell of Episcopacy were once cleared, and brought to an issue, we should not be so much in the dark in other parts of discipline.&#146;<br>
<br>The main concern of the presbyterians was to prevent the institution of the revised Anglican liturgy, which they saw as containing the worst abuses of Roman Catholicism. Manton was present at a meeting at Edmund Calamy's Aldermanbury house on 2 April 1660 and attended discussions at Sion College. The purpose of these meetings, also attended by Richard Baxter, was to resolve contents of the presbyterian liturgy. On 22 October, Manton and other senior presbyterian clergy attended the king at Lord Chancellor Manchester's residence to present their proposals. These talks led to the ill-fated conference between the Anglicans and presbyterians at the Savoy on 25 March 1661, the failure of which prompted Clarendon to remark to the thin Baxter that if he &#145;were but as fat as Dr. Manton, we should all do well&#146;  (Keeble and Nuttall, 1.377). Manton was offered the deanery of Rochester if he conformed, but rejected this offer.<br>
<br>The failure of the attempts to reach an accommodation in church matters and the rise of the cavalier party in the House of Commons meant that the puritan clergy were ejected from the Church of England for nonconformity on 24 August 1662. Like other London ministers Manton preached a poignant farewell sermon, choosing <span class="roman">Hebrews</span> 12: 1 as his text. He may have been disappointed with Charles II's failure to intervene to stop the great Ejection, for George Wild, the bishop of Derry, noted that Manton seemed to make a slur on the title &#145;Defender of the Faith&#146; in his prayer for the king. Dr Patrick, later bishop of Ely, replaced Manton at Covent Garden on 23 September 1662. Manton attended his services at Covent Garden, but was accused by Patrick of circulating libels about him among the congregation. In 1669 Manton was referred to the bishop of London's court for not receiving communion.<h2>
<a name="Restorationnonconformist"></a>Restoration nonconformist</h2>Manton was at the centre of early nonconformist organization and generally held the chair of dissenters' meetings. This was possibly due to his influence with the king and nobles. In March 1663 Charles II summoned him alongside Edmund Calamy, William Bate, and possibly Richard Baxter to discuss his plans for the comprehension of moderate dissenters in the Church of England. His main influence, however, was with the presbyterian aristocrats and gentry who attended various conventicles at his house in King Street, Covent Garden, at White Hart Yard, near the Strand, and at Lord Wharton's residence at St Giles-in-the-Fields. In January 1664 a government agent noted that Manton preached to the countess of Exeter, Sir William Waller, and Lord Wharton at Arthur Jackson's residence in Whitefriars. In the same year another agent noted that he regularly met at an unnamed lord's house some 17 miles from London with Edmund Calamy, Richard Baxter, and others to plan nonconformist strategy. Manton's preaching was particularly popular with nonconformist ladies; reports mention ladies Bedford, Manchester, Clare, Clinton, Wortland, Scarsdale, Seymour, and Trevor and the earl of Anglesey's sister as having attended his services. He also seems to have had some influence with Scottish presbyterian peers, especially the earl of Lauderdale.<br>
<br>In September 1668 Manton was asked by Charles II through Sir John Baber to make an address thanking the king for indulgence. In making this request Baber was joined by William Bates and Thomas Jacombe. This prompted hopes for a <i>rapprochement</i> between the presbyterians and the established church, and Manton joined Richard Baxter and Bates in discussing comprehension with the king and others at Lord Arlington's residence. Baxter reports, however, that the congregationalist John Owen, who refused to accept anything but full toleration, wrecked the talks.<br>
<br>The breakdown of communication between the king and the nonconformists led to a wave of repression in the form of the revised Clarendon code. In 1670 Arlington received communication that Manton, speaking for the presbyterians, had resolved with the leaders of the congregationalists and the Baptists to resist the <span class="roman">Conventicle Act</span> of 1668 as a united body. Manton was also involved in talks with the congregationalist clergy on obtaining a common liberty of conscience. His reward was to be arrested under the <span class="roman">Five Mile Act</span> in March 1670 and imprisoned for six months in the Gatehouse. Upon release his peace-making skills were required in the presbyterian camp. In December 1671 he joined William Bates and Thomas Jacombe, the so-called &#145;dons&#146; (presbyterians who wanted comprehension with the established church), in negotiations with Samuel Annesley, Nathaniel Vincent, and Thomas Watson, called the &#145;ducklings&#146; because they represented the younger generation of presbyterians who wanted to remain separated from the Church of England.<br>
<br>Reconciliation among the presbyterians came in time for the declaration of indulgence in 1672. Manton was licensed as a presbyterian at his home in Covent Garden on 2 April. He took full advantage of the opportunity created by the indulgence and was elected one of the joint congregational and presbyterian lecturers at Pinners' Hall in Old Broad Street, London. He also preached at the revival of the presbyterian morning exercises. Manton applied <span class="roman">Acts</span> 2: 38 to give counsel on baptism at Cripplegate in 1674 and applied <span class="roman">2 Thessalonians</span> 2: 15 in defending the doctrine of the sole sufficiency of scripture in the morning exercises against popery in 1675.<h2>
<a name="Lastyears"></a>Last years</h2>In 1675, with the end of the king's indulgence, Manton's congregation was broken up. He, however, continued to preach to his aristocratic followers at Covent Garden until his death. In April 1675 he joined William Bates, Matthew Poole, and Richard Baxter in more ill-fated accommodation talks with the latitudinarian clergy John Tillotson, George Morley, Seth Ward, and Edward Stillingfleet. In the following year he was a co-signatory to Baxter's <span class="italic">The Judgment of Non-Conformists, of the Interest of Reason, in Matters of Religion</span>.<br>
<br>Manton's health began to fail in late 1675, and he &#145;languish'd many months but presuming he should be too strong for his infirmity, neglected it, till at last it became insuperable and mortal&#146;  (W. Bates, <span class="italic">A Funeral Sermon Preached upon the Death of &hellip; Thomas Manton</span>, 1678, 58). He died on 18 October 1677 and was buried in the chancel of St Mary's, Stoke Newington, on 22 October. Ralph Thoresby noted that the nonconformist ministers were paired with priests of the established church during the funeral procession and that Manton was styled &#145;the King of Preachers&#146;. William Bates preached Manton's funeral sermon and chose <span class="roman">1 Thessalonians</span> 4: 17 as his text. His former presbyterian colleagues Thomas Case and John Collinges also commemorated his life in sermons.<br>
<br>Manton's wife, Mary, lived until 1701 but few of their children survived them. One daughter, Ann, married John Terry and died on 16 March 1689. A son, Nathaniel, was a bookseller at the Three Pigeons in Poultry. Manton left little money, but a vast library of books was sold at public auction at his house in King's Street on 25 March 1678 for the benefit of his family.<br>
<br>Manton's works were generally well regarded by his contemporaries. Archbishop Ussher described him as a &#145;voluminous preacher&#146; and William Bates commended his technique of &#145;represent[ing] the inseperable connection between Christian duties and priviledges&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). His Calvinism was, however, too much for Lord Bolingbroke, whose family had been under Manton's ministry at Covent Garden. Bolingbroke told Jonathan Swift that &#145;Manton taught my youth to yawn, and prepared me to be a high churchman, that I might never hear him read or read him more&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). The younger Calamy gave a more favourable judgement, noting that he &#145;was endowed with extraordinary knowledge of the scriptures, and in his preaching gave a perspicacious account of the order and dependence of divine truths&#146;.<br>
