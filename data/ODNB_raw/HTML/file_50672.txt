<span class="headword">Grant <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Cruickshank]</span>,  Doris Margaret Louise</span>  (1905&#150;2003), <span class="occ">nutritionist</span>, was born on 23 January 1905 in North Sandlaw, Aloah, Banff, Scotland, the youngest in the family of two sons and three daughters of William Cruickshank, a businessman who had returned from China to buy a farm and settle in Scotland, and his wife, Adeline Anne Marshall, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith. She attended Banff Academy, moving on to the Glasgow School of Art, where she took the five-year diploma course (1922&#150;7), and won the Rome scholarship, awarded to the top student of the year. However, when it was discovered that she was engaged to be married, she was forced to give up the scholarship. She married (William Duncan) Gordon Grant (1902&#150;1997) in Banff on 8 November 1927. Her husband, the son of George Cowie Grant, a doctor, worked for the family firm of William Grant, distillers, and after their marriage they moved to London, where he established the London office of the firm. They had two daughters.<br>
<br>As a young woman Doris Grant suffered many years of ill health, including chronic indigestion and crippling rheumatoid arthritis, but she made a rapid recovery after adopting the Hay diet, developed in the 1920s by an American, William Howard Hay. Hay's book, <span class="italic">A New Health Era</span> (1934), set out the principles of &#145;food combining&#146;. Believing that disease was mainly caused by the wrong chemical conditions in the body, created by bad eating habits, he advocated eating proteins at separate meals from carbohydrates, and thought that vegetables, salads, and fruits should make up the bulk of the diet, in order to avoid generating excess acid in the digestive system. From then on Doris Grant was a passionate believer in the Hay diet, and after writing about it in a series of weekly articles in the <span class="italic">Sunday Graphic</span> for nine months from 1936 to 1937 she was visited by Hay, who asked her to write a book of menus and recipes for the British housewife. <span class="italic">The Hay System Menu Book</span> was published in 1937, followed by <span class="italic">Feeding the Family in Wartime, Based on the New Knowledge of Nutrition</span> (1942).<br>
<br>Doris Grant is remembered mainly for the &#145;Grant loaf&#146;, made from unkneaded dough. The recipe first appeared in <span class="italic">Your Daily Bread</span>, which was published in 1944, and was subsequently printed many times in the magazine <span class="italic">Housewives Today</span>. An advocate of wholemeal bread and home baking, Grant discovered by accident that wholemeal bread did not have to be kneaded, and that in fact it tasted better made this way, and also saved time, making it easier for housewives to bake their own bread. Her recipe called for stoneground wholemeal flour and Barbados muscovado cane sugar, and a large quantity of yeast. Despite the healthy nature of the Grant loaf, she thought one should only eat bread at one meal a day. In <span class="italic">Your Daily Food</span> (1973) she expanded on the ill effects of eating white bread, which she described as &#145;murdered bread&#146;, using white flour from which the wheat germ and bran, important sources of vitamin B, had been discarded, and which had been bleached with chemicals to make it whiter. &#145;If you love your husbands&#146;, she declared, &#145;keep them away from white bread &hellip; If you don't love them, cyanide is quicker but bleached bread is just as certain, and no questions asked&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 29 March 2003).<br>
<br>After the war Grant continued to campaign for healthy eating. In <span class="italic">Dear Housewives</span> (1954) and <span class="italic">Housewives Beware</span> (1958) she warned about the dangers of processed foods and food additives, and urged people to grow their own fruit and vegetables, or eat organically grown local produce, and to avoid all food that had come through a factory: &#145;the chemical dragon&#146; was &#145;now breathing its foul breath over our food and water&#146;  (<span class="italic">Housewives Beware</span>, 15). In 1984 she returned to the subject of the Hay diet in <span class="italic">Food Combining for Health: a New Look at the Hay System</span>, written with Jean Joice: it ran to five editions in ten years, selling half a million copies. This was followed by <span class="italic">Food Combining for Life: the Health Success of the Century</span> (1995), which included some of the hundreds of letters she had received from readers who claimed to have had their lives transformed by the Hay system. She also took up other causes in her efforts to improve the health of the nation. She was a vigorous opponent of the fluoridation of the water supply, and her address to the British Housewives' League in 1979 was published as a pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Fluoridation Fallacy</span>. She was also a founder member of the Henry Doubleday Research Association, devoted to the furtherance and improvement of organic gardening.<br>
<br>Slim and energetic, Doris Grant had many other interests and talents. She took up the cello at the age of forty, in order to complete the family string quartet, and designed and made costume jewellery for the royal dress designer Norman Hartnell to sell in his boutique. When her husband retired in 1962 and they moved to Poole, Dorset, she took navigation lessons in order to help sail their motor yacht in the English Channel. Although she was regarded by many as a crank, her emphasis on healthy eating and organically grown fruit and vegetables had become widely accepted by the time of her death. She died on 27 February 2003 at the Lister Hospital, Stevenage, Hertfordshire, of heart disease, and was survived by her two daughters, her husband having predeceased her.<br>
