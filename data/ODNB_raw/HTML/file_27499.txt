<span class="headword">Tolfrey,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1777?, <em>d.</em> 1817), <span class="occ">orientalist</span>, was probably baptized on 27 October 1777 at St Swithin London Stone, London, the son of William and Susannah Tolfrey. He was apparently educated in England. In 1794 he went to Calcutta, where his father then lived, and obtained at first some subordinate post in a public office, but soon afterwards relinquished this for an ensigncy in the 76th (foot) regiment. His military career was creditable. Promoted to the 74th regiment, he served in the Anglo-Mysore War under General George Harris and in the Maratha campaigns of 1803&#150;4. He was distinguished also in the battle of Assaye.<br>
<br>In 1805 Tolfrey sold his commission, and, visiting an uncle, Samuel Tolfrey, in Ceylon, obtained a post in the civil service of the island in 1806. In 1813 he was assistant commissioner of revenue and commerce, and shortly afterwards his proficiency in Sinhalese obtained him the post of chief translator to the resident at Kandy. On the arrival of Sir Robert Brownrigg as governor in 1812, a <span class="roman">Bible</span> society was started, and with other scholars Tolfrey undertook the revision of the old Sinhalese translation of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> made by the Dutch. The work was printed under the direction of the Colombo Auxiliary Bible Society between 1817 and 1820. Struck by the unduly colloquial character of the original edition Tolfrey had decided on the course of first translating each verse into classical Pali. It was probably this that led him to attempt the translation of the whole <span class="roman">New Testament</span> into Pali, a work which he had nearly completed at the time of his death. It was subsequently printed, but as a literary production it was of no great or lasting value. Tolfrey was, however, probably the first Englishman to study Pali, the most important of the languages of Buddhism, and he merits recognition as a pioneer. Benjamin Clough used his materials for the compilation of his Pali grammar, printed in Colombo in 1824, which was the only work of the kind for some thirty years.<br>
<br>Tolfrey died in Ceylon on 4 January 1817. He appears to have been unmarried at the time of his death: his sole executor was his mother, and after leaving legacies to his servants, he bequeathed the residue of his personal estate to the Colombo Auxiliary Bible Society. A monument was erected to his memory in the church of St Peter in the fort of Colombo.<br>
