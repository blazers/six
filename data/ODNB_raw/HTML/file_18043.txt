<span class="headword">Marett, Sir  Robert Pipon</span>  (1820&#150;1884), <span class="occ">politician in Jersey and poet</span>, was born at St Peter, Jersey, on 20 November 1820, the eldest of the eight children of Peter Daniel Marett (<i>d</i>. 1838) and his wife, Mary Ann, eldest daughter of Thomas Pipon, lieutenant bailiff of Jersey. Marett belonged to a family established in Jersey for many centuries, and was a descendant of Philip Maret (or Marett). His father had served in the East India Company's Madras infantry with the rank of major, and married his mother on retiring to Jersey.<br>
<br>Marett's early education at McMahon's School, Jersey, revealed great academic potential. A contemporary chronicle records:<blockquote>The spiritual activity and love of work, which were already characteristic of him, never deserted him in the course of a career filled not only with legal and professional achievements but also with literary and scientific studies, the gift of great intelligence. (<span class="italic">Almanach de la Chronique de Jersey</span>, 227)</blockquote>In 1840 Marett commenced a five-year course of study at the University of Caen. He was called to the Jersey bar in November of the same year. On completing his studies he spent one year in Blois with his family, where his widowed mother had gone for health reasons, and was involved in founding an English church there, building being his lifelong hobby.<br>
<br>Reform was the watchword of the time, and local politics were dominated by two parties, the laurel on the right and the rose on the left. In this contentious atmosphere Marett stood for moderation. He was defeated in the 1852 election for constable of St Helier as an independent candidate, but elected unopposed at the next election, in 1856. As constable (mayor) he used the full weight of his influence to improve the town, widening streets and creating public parks. He took the far-sighted view that as the island had no capital but that which came from outside, everything possible had to be done to make it attractive to outsiders.<br>
<br>The progress of Marett's career was rapid. He was appointed solicitor-general in 1858 and attorney-general in 1866, and sworn in as bailiff in 1880. He was knighted in May 1881. His opinion on legal reform was valued throughout his career: he gave evidence before a commission of the privy council in 1861, and drafted a law fundamentally changing and simplifying the inheritance of real estate, which was passed in 1879. He edited four volumes of manuscripts encapsulating Jersey law, written by Philip Le Geyt, an earlier lieutenant bailiff, and wrote a learned treatise as preface to the edition published by the states of Jersey in 1882. His standing as a legislator is such that his writings were regularly quoted by counsel in cases before the courts even at the close of the twentieth century.<br>
<br>Marett's other local concerns included designs for a new harbour at St Helier, the founding of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Jersiaise, patronage of societies ranging from the orphanage and general dispensary to the Agricultural and Horticultural Society, and being a governor of both Victoria College and the Jersey Ladies' College.<br>
<br>In 1865 Marett married Julia Anne (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1830), youngest of the four daughters of Philip Marett, seigneur of La Haule, and a distant cousin, with whom he had one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34872/', "Robert Ranulph Marett")</script>, who became a distinguished anthropologist, and three daughters.<br>
<br>Marett's interest both in classical and in English literature was wide, and he built up a valuable library at his home, Blanc Pignon, which was destroyed by fire in 1874, whereupon he and his family moved into La Haule Manor. He was fluent in English, French, Latin, and Jersey Norman French, and is considered a pioneer of J&egrave;rriais as a written language, having published a number of poems in the vernacular in the liberal journal <span class="italic">La Patrie</span>, of which he was a founder, under the pseudonym Laelius.<br>
<br>Marett's death, on 10 November 1884 at La Haule Manor, plunged the island into mourning, and the local newspapers devoted many columns to the most handsome tributes and to voluminous lists of the multitude of local notables and ordinary citizens who attended his funeral at St Brelade's parish church.<br>
