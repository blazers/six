<span class="headword">Clerk,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1655), <span class="occ">civil lawyer</span>, was admitted as a scholar to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in 1605. By its statutes Trinity Hall was committed to the study of the civil law, which was derived from Roman law and governed ecclesiastical, maritime, and international affairs. Clerk was a fellow of the college from 1609 to 1634, taking the degrees of LLB in 1610 and LLD in 1629. In 1631 he published a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">An Epitome of Certaine Late Aspersions Cast at Civilians</span>. This was a contribution to the continuing defence of the civil law against the encroachments of the common lawyers, and aimed to refute criticisms of the civil law made in the preface to Sir John Davies's <span class="italic">Primer report des cases &amp; matters en ley</span> (1615).<br>
<br>By the 1620s Clerk was seeking to become established as a practitioner in the civil law courts. In 1624 he was appointed as joint commissary of the exchequer and prerogative court of York, but never assumed the post. He obtained full membership of Doctors' Commons in 1629, and probably by 1634 had become official of the archdeacon of London. From 1635 until 1640 he was active as an advocate in the London courts, and was also appointed to a number of commissions for piracy.<br>
<br>Although parliament abolished the ecclesiastical courts in 1646, there was still a need for the expertise of civil lawyers. From 1647 Clerk served as a judge in the court of admiralty, and was also president of Doctors' Commons. The outbreak of war with the Dutch in the spring of 1652 led to a considerable increase in the business being handled by the admiralty court, and in recognition of this Clerk's salary was set at &pound;200 per annum.<br>
<br>As a judge Clerk frequently had to deal with cases of international importance. The most celebrated of these was the trial of Don Pantaleone Sa, the brother of the Portuguese ambassador, for his involvement in the murder of an innocent bystander during a street disturbance. Don Pantaleone claimed he had authority to act as ambassador in his brother's absence, and thus had diplomatic privilege, even though the crime of which he was accused was against the law of nations. Clerk was one of a committee of six judges appointed to consider whether Don Pantaleone could be tried. The committee decided that a trial was permissible, and a special commission of three common law judges, three civil law judges, including Clerk, and three laymen was appointed to hear the case, with a mixed English and foreign jury. In spite of his claim to ambassadorial status Don Pantaleone was found guilty, and executed on 10 July 1654.<br>
<br>Clerk was buried on 3 August 1655, and appears to have continued working until his death, which probably took place in London. He left a wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1674), and a daughter, Elizabeth. His achievement was to help in keeping the civil law alive in the unsettled political conditions of the civil war and interregnum.<br>
