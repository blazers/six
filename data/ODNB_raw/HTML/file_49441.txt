<span class="headword">Mouchel,  Louis Gustave <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Gustave-Louis]</span></span>  (1852&#150;1908), <span class="occ">promoter of ferroconcrete</span>, was born on 11 January 1852 at 56 rue Corne de Cerf, Cherbourg, third of the four children of Louis Mouchel, wig maker, and his wife, Felicit&eacute; Duchemin. He had three sisters. Mouchel attended the college at Cherbourg to train as a naval officer but joined the department of highways, taking an engineering course at the Government School of Mines.<br>
<br>Mouchel spoke English fluently, and in 1875 he moved to Briton Ferry in south Wales, where he initiated a number of business enterprises. He introduced coke making to the area, and formed the Cardiff Washed Coal and Fuel Company, subsequently a client for ferroconcrete. He exported coal and imported ore from mines in Brittany. As French vice-consul, Mouchel was responsible for several south Wales ports and was also a ship broker. He became co-director of various prominent companies, including Eaglesbush colliery, Neath, and the Gwalia Tinplate Company, a modern works &#145;illuminated with the electric light&#146;  (Humphreys, 39). By 1898, when Mouchel became general agent for Hennebique's system of reinforced concrete in the UK, he was a prospering and well-known businessman in south Wales, residing in one of the notable houses in Briton Ferry, a successful entrepreneur with useful contacts.<br>
<br>As Hennebique's agent, Mouchel effectively established the use of reinforced concrete in Britain, particularly for framed buildings. At this time, when reinforced concrete was developed and marketed by rival patentees, Hennebique was expanding his organization rapidly. Mouchel may have been his first client in Britain, for some house property, but the first built project recorded was a provender mill for William Weaver &amp; Co. in Swansea (1897&#150;8), the first multi-storeyed construction in Britain entirely in reinforced concrete. For this project, workmen and even materials, including high quality sand from the Loire, were shipped from France.<br>
<br>It may have been while Hennebique was arranging transport that he and Mouchel first met; as consul, the latter organized French ship movements in Swansea harbour. Mouchel accepted the agency, deciding to make the introduction of Hennebique's material into Britain the &#145;chief object of his professional life&#146;  (&#145;Life and work of Louis Gustave Mouchel&#146;, 212). He even coined the term &#145;ferroconcrete&#146; to describe it. His business organization followed Hennebique's model, employing specially trained engineers and licensed contractors, with nationwide expansion based on regional &#145;commercial&#150;technical&#146; offices. Mouchel himself underwent training in Hennebique's offices and began to execute working drawings. He also patented designs, especially for underground and marine work, modifying Hennebique's system, and published illustrated books of ferroconcrete works.<br>
<br>Mouchel moved his office to London in 1900, to a new but bare apartment owned by the Great Western Railway Company (itself a client of his). The following year, he moved to his permanent business address, 38 Victoria Street, Westminster, and rapidly established offices throughout the UK. Engineers and draughtsmen from Hennebique's offices in France joined Mouchel. Early clients included the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which had its own building department and obtained a Hennebique licence.<br>
<br>Mouchel possessed enormous energy, organizational skill, and single-mindedness; contemporaries spoke of great personal charm and a magnetic personality which compelled confidence in himself and in ferroconcrete. His attention to detail ensured an excellent safety record, and his response to a rare failure of a test floor in Manchester in 1902 demonstrated his deep professional commitment. In a twelve-page letter to the client's engineer, presenting a passionate plea for justice in the matter, he wrote:<blockquote>if on account of that wretched incomplete test they throw us overboard, I would consider it an iniquity. Because it would be doing us, without justification, the maximum of injury possible and destroying at one stroke &hellip; my five years of anxious and arduous work in this country. (Mouchel to Hunter, 1902, L. G. Mouchel &amp; Partners archives)</blockquote>Mouchel faced considerable prejudice in Britain. The Institution of Civil Engineers showed little interest in ferroconcrete before 1908, and although the Royal Institute of British Architects investigated it earlier, a speaker questioned the sanity of anyone's using such a heterogeneous combination as concrete and steel. Finally, the use of patent systems, particularly by &#145;pretentious foreigners&#146;  (&#145;The progress of reinforced concrete&#146;, <span class="italic">Concrete and Constructional Engineering</span>, 2, 1907, 11), increasingly came under attack. Nevertheless, Mouchel completed more than 130 framed buildings and numerous other structures.<br>
<br>Mouchel never married and had no hobbies, but &#145;lived entirely for his work&#146;  (<span class="italic">Builders' Journal</span>). In 1907, suffering from stomach cancer, he formed a company, L. G. Mouchel &amp; Partners Ltd, which was still flourishing almost a century later. Mouchel returned to France and died at 12 rue Vintras, Cherbourg, at his brother-in-law's house on 27 May 1908. He never took British citizenship.<br>
