<span class="headword">Halliwell,  David Wiliam</span>  (1936&#150;2006), <span class="occ">playwright and theatre director</span>, was born on 31 July 1936 at Lynn Lea Maternity Home, Clifton, Yorkshire, the elder son of Herbert Halliwell, company secretary, and his wife, Ethel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Spencer. At the time of his birth his parents lived at 24 Upper Green Lane, Brighouse, Yorkshire. As a child he had ambitions to become a comic actor, and his hero was Charlie Chaplin. Educated at Victoria secondary modern school, Rastrick, and Hipperholme grammar school, he attended Huddersfield College of Art (1953&#150;9), from which he was expelled and then allowed to return. The incident inspired him to write his most famous play, <span class="italic">Little Malcolm and His Struggle against the Eunuchs</span>, in which the protagonist, Malcolm Scrawdyke, is expelled from a technical college before starting the Dynamic Erection Party, whose main purposes are power and revenge against the college's principal. The anti-hero Malcolm is an instantly recognizable human figure, a mixture of frustrated ambition and absurd self-delusion.<br>
<br>Halliwell studied acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), and, after graduating, worked as an assistant stage manager at Nottingham Playhouse. He moved back to London (living at 28 Chepstow Court) and in 1964 wrote <span class="italic">Little Malcolm</span>. &#145;It occurred to me that if I could write a successful play I might rocket to the top of the profession&#146;, he said  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 21 March 2006). Initially running for six hours, the play was first directed by Mike Leigh at London's left-wing Unity Theatre in 1965. When first produced, it was seen as a ground-breaking political satire and was noted for its extraordinary display of verbal fireworks. Substantially rewritten, it was revived at the Garrick Theatre the same year, with John Hurt giving a critically acclaimed performance in the title role. The play won for its author the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span>'s most promising playwright award for 1967. It was seen in Dublin and then in New York (where it was pointlessly retitled <span class="italic">Hail Scrawdyke!</span>), filmed in 1974 (again starring John Hurt, and with George Harrison as producer) and revived at the Hampstead Theatre in 1998 in a sell-out production starring Ewan McGregor. Reassessing the play after three decades Michael Billington commented: &#145;If the play makes for a good evening it is because it pins down the bedsit revolutions of much of 1960s student life and accurately shows how dreams of power spring from emotional deprivation&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 19 Nov 1998).<br>
<br>In 1968 Halliwell set up, with David Calderisi, his own pioneering fringe theatre company, Quipu, which operated until 1973 variously at the Arts Theatre, the Mercury Theatre in Notting Hill, and the Little Theatre, off St Martin's Lane. Halliwell's purpose was to create &#145;a new kind of organisation in which the means of production are owned, controlled and developed by the artists whose work is being produced&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 22 March 2006). As well as directing premi&egrave;res of new works, including his own, he oversaw successful productions of Shaw, Strindberg, Poliakoff, and Pinter. A staple of 1960s fringe theatre was his own play <span class="italic">The Experiment</span> (1967), in which a group of actors struggle to explore the significance of the assassination of the American president James Garfield in 1881. Throughout the 1970s Halliwell continued to write prolifically, notably <span class="italic">K. D. Dufford</span> (1970), a shocking and controversial drama in which a man seeks notoriety by murdering a child. Other plays included <span class="italic">A Last Belch for the Great Auk</span> (1971) and <span class="italic">The Freckland Bum</span> (1975). In 1976 he spent a year as the literary manager of the Royal Court Theatre in London.<br>
<br>In his later writing career Halliwell's nuanced psychological stage plays began to fall out of fashion, but he did write a host of well-received television dramas including <span class="italic">Triple Exposure</span> (1972) and <span class="italic">Steps Back</span> (1973). He also contributed scripts to several television crime series, including <span class="italic">Crown Court</span> and <span class="italic">The Bill</span>. Radio plays included <span class="italic">Was It Her / Spongehenge</span>, <span class="italic">There's a Car Park in Witherton</span>, <span class="italic">Crossed Lines</span>, and, most famously, <span class="italic">Who's Who of Flapland</span>, which brought two of his paranoiacs together, characteristically using language drawn from his native Yorkshire as the site of their confrontations.<br>
<br>Few British dramatists have enjoyed such international acclaim with their first play as Halliwell did with <span class="italic">Little Malcolm and His Struggle against the Eunuchs</span>, and although he never repeated the triumph he remained a highly influential figure in British theatre during the 1960s and early 1970s. His work, both as an experimental and political dramatist, and as a visionary fringe theatre director, was championed by such figures as Alan Strachan, Mike Leigh, and Dan Crawford. A bluff northerner, who never married, he was renowned in theatrical circles as being a maverick, a loner with few social graces. His close friendships were few but to those who knew him well he remained a fiercely loyal and witty companion. He died alone on 17 March 2006 at his home, 8 Crawborough Villas, Charlbury, Oxfordshire, following a heart attack. His brother Roger survived him.<br>
