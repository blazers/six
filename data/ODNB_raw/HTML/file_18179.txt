<span class="headword">Martin,  Francis</span>  (1652&#150;1722), <span class="occ">theologian</span>, was born towards the end of November 1652 in Galway. He was educated first at a local school and then at home. In 1670 he became a teacher, but in 1673 Archbishop Lynch of Tuam, a relative, sent him to Louvain. He matriculated on 19 December 1673 and graduated in the arts in 1674. In 1675 he began the study of theology. He applied for the lectureship in Greek at the Collegium Trilingue in 1681, obtaining it in 1683 through the intervention of powerful anti-Jansenists in the university and the government, and retaining it until his death. Throughout his study of theology he struggled with the view of grace then prevalent in the Louvain faculty, and after his appointment as a lecturer he openly attacked it. In 1684 he obtained the licentiate in theology and became lecturer at St Martin's, a house of Augustinian canons. Complaints in 1685 and 1686 that his lectures undermined the authority of Augustine and promoted extreme claims about papal power led to opposition within the faculty to his being awarded the doctorate in theology in 1688, but the intervention of the nuncio at Brussels enabled him to take the degree.<br>
<br>Late in 1688 Martin wrote to the nuncio to the court of James II outlining a hypothetical scheme for the assassination of William of Orange, an abiding source of embarrassment after the letter was published in an anonymous Gallican pamphlet, <span class="italic">&Eacute;tat pr&eacute;sent de la facult&eacute; de th&eacute;ologie de Louvain</span> (Tr&eacute;voux, 1701). In 1689 Martin obtained a position in Hovius College thanks to the anti-Jansenist master, Pierre Marcelis, under whose guidance he took part in a campaign to harass and discredit suspected Jansenists at the university, among other things by bringing a malicious suit before the council of Brabant. Throughout 1691 and 1692 Martin was professor of theology at the great seminary in Mechelen, appointed by Archbishop Precipiano due to his stand against Jansenism. His lectures again aroused complaints, and when a thesis on <span class="roman">Genesis</span> in which he criticized Augustine was condemned his removal was petitioned.<br>
<br>Towards the end of 1692 Nicolas du Bois, ageing regius professor of scripture at Louvain, applied to have Martin deliver lectures on his behalf. The following year the governor-general acceded to the request in the face of opposition from the faculty, and Martin returned to Louvain. In 1694 Precipiano appointed him ecclesiastical censor and synodal examiner, and on du Bois's death in 1696 Martin succeeded him as regius professor by royal letters patent, subsequently becoming, again through political patronage, a regent of the faculty of theology and a canon of St Peter's in Louvain. Until 1705 he was to combat Jansenism not only in his daily lectures and his writings (of which there is no systematic bibliography), but also by using his powers in the university to block the promotions of suspected Jansenists, and his position as censor to refuse them publication, while favouring their opponents.<br>
<br>From 1705, growing increasingly distrustful of the Jesuits and of Molinism, and reading Pascal, Arnauld, and Dominican works on efficacious grace, Martin gradually drew closer to the Jansenists, openly aligning himself with them in 1710. Expediency may have played some role in changing his attitude. After the nadir of 1700&#150;06, when the occupying French authorities had given full support to Archbishop Precipiano's anti-Jansenist measures, the allied victory at Ramillies (1706) inaugurated a brief period of Jansenist &#145;revanche&#146;  (Pirenne, 105). Martin seems to have become particularly outspoken after the death of his former patron Precipiano in 1711. In that year his former allies lodged a complaint against him in Brussels which was quashed at the intervention of the English minister, and in 1712 he propounded in his lectures theses which the then censor of books described as scandalous and which led to heated controversy. A further appeal to the Brussels internuncio to discipline Martin precipitated a dangerous dispute about secular, papal, and internal jurisdiction in the university which ended only when Martin submitted a retraction in 1713. His one constant conviction seems to have been absolute papal infallibility in doctrinal matters, so that the condemnation of Jansenism in the bull <span class="italic">Unigenitus</span> (1713) led him to abandon his support for the Jansenist party.<br>
<br>In 1714 the principal work of Martin's career was published, <span class="italic">Scutum fidei contra haereses hodiernas</span>, written to vindicate the Catholic faith from the attacks of John Tillotson, defending the infallibility of the church, the primacy of the pope, the sacrament of penance, transubstantiation, communion in one kind, adoration of the eucharist, the Latin liturgy, the use of images, and the invocation of saints, and denying Tillotson's charge that Catholic doctrine taught that the pope had the authority to depose secular rulers. On this last point Martin stressed that even those theologians who argued most forcefully for the opinion never claimed it was an article of faith, and commented on the irony of a whig expressing horror at the deposition of kings.<br>
<br>Martin approached the internuncio in 1715 with a proposal for a book supporting the debated papal bull <span class="italic">Unigenitus</span>. This was finally published in March 1720 as <span class="italic">Motivum juris pro bulla Unigenitus orthodoxia</span>. Attacking the schism threatened both by appeals against <span class="italic">Unigenitus</span> and by the &#145;secret machinations of the molinists&#146;  (p. 162), it was an attempt to reconcile conflicts within the church on an infallibilist basis which few would have been willing to accept. The very next year Martin published his <span class="italic">Brevis tractatus</span> expanding on his view of the papal deposing power as touched on in the <span class="italic">Scutum fidei</span> and <span class="italic">Motivum juris</span>. Martin's contacts with the earl of Sunderland, who had visited Louvain in September 1717 when secretary of state, and with the bishop of Bangor convinced him that the main obstacle to the toleration of Catholics in Britain was fear of their disloyalty arising from the papal deposing power. While maintaining that the papal primacy was instituted by Christ in St Peter, Martin showed that the power of the pope to depose secular rulers was a theological opinion rather than an article of faith, and argued strongly that it was an opinion which occasioned harm to the faithful and no good to the church. By attacking the opponents of <span class="italic">Unigenitus</span> while still fiercely opposing Molinism, and simultaneously upholding papal infallibility while denying papal authority over secular rulers, Martin was isolating himself within the university.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1720 Martin struck a Dominican priest during an argument and was suspended from teaching. He initiated an appeal within the university, but also sought the intervention of the council of Brabant, and returned to teaching in 1721 with his internal appeal still pending. On 4 October 1722 Martin died while undergoing surgery in the hospital of St John in Bruges, and he was buried the same month in the hospital chapel. His memorial records his ample liberality to the poor.<br>
<br>Martin's litigiousness, his violent temper, and his possibly opportunist shift from Molinism to Jansenism to an infallibilist opposition to both, led several contemporaries to describe him as quarrelsome, unstable, and inconsistent. His readiness to resort to civil tribunals or even political favour in university and ecclesiastical affairs, certainly in part opportunist but also foreshadowing Josephinist attitudes soon to be more widespread, was seen by some as dangerously undermining the separation of jurisdictions. When reporting Martin's death the internuncio wrote that he &#145;had often caused great harm to the authority of the Holy See in Flanders and had endangered the privileges of the entire University&#146;  (Giblin in <span class="italic">Collectanea Hibernica</span>, 5.104).<br>
