<span class="headword">Lucas,  John</span>  (1807&#150;1874), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, was born in London on 4 July 1807, the son of William Lucas (<i>bap</i>. 1775, <i>d</i>. 1819), whose family came from King's Lynn in Norfolk, and a Miss Calcott. His father began his career in the Royal Navy, but later styled himself a literary man, publishing poems such as <span class="italic">The Fate of Bertha</span> (1800) and acting as editor of <span class="italic">The Sun</span> newspaper. Lucas was apprenticed to Samuel William Reynolds, the mezzotint engraver, at the same time as Samuel Cousins. During this time he also studied and practised oil painting. When his tenure with Reynolds ended in the late 1820s, Lucas established his practice as a painter while continuing as a member of the Clipstone Street Academy, working with William Etty and other artists.<br>
<br>Lucas exhibited his first portrait at the Royal Academy in 1828 and thereafter gained fame as a fashionable society portraitist. He painted the likeness of Queen Adelaide, the prince consort (four times), the princess royal, the duke of Wellington (eight times), Lord and Lady Palmerston, and William Ewart Gladstone, among others. His portrait of Mary Russell Mitford was purchased by the National Portrait Gallery after his death. The National Portrait Gallery also has Lucas's <span class="italic">Conference of Engineers, Britannia Bridge</span>, which features portraits of Robert Stevenson and Isambard Kingdom Brunel. This work was later engraved by J. Scott, as were other portraits by Lucas. Lucas himself employed his training as an engraver, producing engravings after Sir Thomas Lawrence.<br>
<br>In 1836 Lucas married Milborough Morgan, a woman of Welsh descent, with whom he had three sons and two daughters. He often exhibited his works publicly, showing ninety-six portraits at the Royal Academy from 1828 to the time of his death on 30 April 1874 at his home, 22 St John's Wood Road, London. He was buried on 5 May 1874 at Kensal Green cemetery, London. Christies auctioned the contents of his studio on 25 February 1875. Lucas's artistic legacy lived on in the work of his sons: William Lucas became a watercolour painter and Arthur Lucas became an art publisher. His nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/101031/', "John Seymour Lucas RA")</script> was his pupil. His eldest son, <a name="cosubject_17133"></a><span class="headword">John Templeton Lucas</span>  (1836&#150;1880)<span class="occ"></span>, perhaps achieved the most renown. Born in London, he concentrated on landscape painting, exhibiting seven landscapes at the Royal Academy between 1859 and 1876. Like his grandfather, he turned to literature, publishing a farce entitled <span class="italic">Browne the Martyr</span> and a book of fairy tales, <span class="italic">Prince Ubbely Bubble's New Story Book</span>, in 1871. He died at Bagdale, Whitby, in Yorkshire, on 13 September 1880.<br>
