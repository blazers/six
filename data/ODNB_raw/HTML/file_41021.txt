<span class="headword">Howley,  Richard Joseph</span>  (1871&#150;1955), <span class="occ">transport company director</span>, was born on 9 July 1871 at Rich Hill, co. Limerick, the son of Lieutenant-Colonel John Howley, deputy lieutenant. He was educated at Oscott College, the Jesuit establishment near Birmingham, and at the University of Dublin. He trained as an engineer, and joined the British Electric Traction company in that capacity in August 1899.<br>
<br>Howley moved to executive duties and became joint manager (with C. H. Dade) in 1912, and was appointed to the board in 1923 with responsibility for administration. He succeeded the founder, Emile Garcke, as chief executive in 1929, and became deputy chairman in 1930. When J. S. Austin retired in 1942, Howley took over the chairmanship, which he handed in 1946 to H. C. Drayton. He remained on the board until 1953. During much of this time he served as chairman or on the board of several subsidiary companies, notably the Birmingham and Midland Motor Omnibus company (&#145;Midland Red&#146;). He played a significant part in the diversification of BET from power generation and traction to become the parent of a large group of bus companies, with interests extending into non-transport activities.<br>
<br>In his public life Howley was a member of the tramways committee of the Board of Trade, and afterwards served from 1917 to 1919 on the railways priority committee. In 1919 he was a founder member of the Institute of Transport. In his evidence to the royal commission on transport (1929&#150;31) he made his mark on the future of the bus industry. The commission was examining a draft bill produced by a Ministry of Transport committee on the licensing and regulation of public service vehicles, under the chairmanship of Sir Henry Percy Maybury (1864&#150;1943). Howley's evidence led the commission to modify Maybury's draft bill so as to set up <i>ad hoc</i> regional licensing authorities, rather than give the powers to county and county borough councils. Nevertheless his submissions did not neglect the interests of his company, nor those of the larger firms in the bus industry.<br>
<br>Howley was a quiet man, who never married, but he was noted for his singleness of purpose. He took over as chairman of BET when a long-standing partnership with the Tilling group was breaking up, and he had little sympathy with the policies of Sir J. F. Heaton, Tilling's chairman. This difference of opinion was reflected in the decision of the board under Drayton's chairmanship not to sell BET bus companies to the British Transport Commission in 1948. Howley's influence, both on BET and on the statutory control of the British bus industry, remained significant in the late twentieth century.<br>
<br>Howley was appointed CBE in 1919, for his war work, and he was awarded the Road Transport (Passenger) Medal of the Institute of Transport in 1924. He died on 2 April 1955 at his home 49 Hallam Street, Marylebone, London, leaving &pound;230,710 gross.<br>
