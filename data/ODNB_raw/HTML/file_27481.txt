<span class="headword">Titley,  Walter</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1698, <em>d.</em> 1768), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, baptized on 6 December 1698 at Ingestre, Staffordshire, was the son of Abraham Titley of Hopton, Staffordshire. He was admitted a king's scholar at Westminster School in 1714. While there he acted as &#145;help&#146; to Osborn Atterbury, the son of Francis Atterbury, bishop of Rochester, and was afterwards his tutor. On 28 May 1719 he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1720; he graduated BA in 1722, was elected a fellow of Trinity in 1725, and proceeded MA in 1726. He then entered the diplomatic service, wishing for &#145;some sort of employment abroad, in which I might have an opportunity of acquainting myself with business and seeing the world&#146;  (Black, <span class="italic">British Diplomats</span>, 101), and became secretary of the British embassy at Turin. On 3 January 1729 he was selected to act as charg&eacute; d'affaires at Copenhagen in the absence of John Campbell, Lord Glenorchy (later third earl of Breadalbane), and on 3 November 1730 he was named minister-resident. Titley's diplomatic career was henceforward devoted to Britain's ongoing efforts to exclude Denmark from any alliance led by France. The policy was pursued throughout the century, usually with success.<br>
<br>In 1733 Richard Bentley (1662&#150;1742), master of Trinity, appointed Titley to the physic fellowship at that college. Titley resigned his diplomatic position to accept it, but had become so attached to his life at Copenhagen that he was unable to leave it. He accordingly resumed his post. In 1736 Horatio Walpole proposed that Titley be made envoy-extraordinary to the Danish court; his nomination was initially unsuccessful, but Titley received the promotion in 1739. He became the century's longest-serving British diplomatist, exceeded in his time overseas only by Sir Horace Mann. The emphasis he placed on socializing was well known: Walpole thought him &#145;amused and deceived by little outward personal civilities&#146;  (Black, <span class="italic">British Diplomats</span>, 100), and in 1746 Titley complained that, with his pay in arrears, he was unable to give dinners and so alienated prospective friends at court. His efforts to ensure that successive Danish kings were friendly to Britain included not only outbidding proffered subsidies from France, but also a role in the arrangement of two royal marriages: that of Princess Louisa of Great Britain to Prince Frederick, later King Frederick V of Denmark, in 1743, and of the Princess Caroline Matilda of Great Britain to King Christian VII of Denmark in 1766. Another particular achievement was an agreement in 1761 whereby the king of Denmark agreed to order the seizure and extradition of deserters from the British army and navy, on condition that the British government reciprocated with Danish absentees. Two years later, in 1763, Titley reported his exhaustion to London&#151;his &#145;gouty legs&#146; would no longer support him &#145;in paying court or pursuing the noble pastime of lev&eacute;e-hunting&#146;  (ibid., 99)&#151;and he was granted an assistant. He died, greatly respected and lamented by his contemporaries, at his estate at Lyngby, near Copenhagen, on 27 February 1768. In his will he bequeathed &pound;1000 each to Westminster School, Trinity College, and the University of Cambridge. Part of the last bequest was to be devoted to buildings.<br>
<br>In addition to a number of original Latin verses, Titley wrote an &#145;Imitation&#146; in English of the second ode of the third book of Horace; this was much admired by Bentley, who parodied it.<br>
