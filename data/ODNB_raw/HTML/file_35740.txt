<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Richardson, Sir  Owen Willans</span>  (1879&#150;1959), <span class="occ">physicist</span>, was born on 26 April 1879 in Blenheim Terrace, Dewsbury, Yorkshire, the eldest of the three children of Joshua Henry Richardson, woollen manufacturer, and his wife, Charlotte Maria Willans. From St John's Church day school, Dewsbury, Richardson won a scholarship to Batley grammar school in 1891. In 1897 he won another scholarship, to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he gained a first class in part one of the natural sciences tripos (with distinction in physics, chemistry, and botany, 1899) and proceeded in physics and chemistry to a first in part two in 1900. He was elected a fellow of Trinity in 1902, became Clerk Maxwell scholar in 1904, and was awarded the London DSc degree in the same year.<br>
<br>On graduating in 1900 Richardson began research at the Cavendish Laboratory under the supervision of J. J. Thomson, who suggested that he search for electrons blown out of a wire by a high-frequency alternating current. The results were negative and Richardson decided that:<blockquote>before starting another problem I would think over the whole field of opportunity and make my own decision as to what was the best thing for me to do and the best way to set about it, without asking anybody's advice. (Richardson to Rayleigh, 4 Dec 1940, Richardson MSS)</blockquote>He began thinking about what the electrons were likely to be doing inside a metal and why they did not get out more easily. As in much of his later work, he drew, for his theory, on classical thermodynamics and the kinetic theory of gases.Richardson formulated a general theory of the process wherein electrons in the metal, responsible for its electrical conductivity, were regarded as evaporating through a potential barrier at its surface. &#145;It seemed to me that the real things to go for were the highest possible temperatures under the best attainable vacuum conditions&#146;, he wrote to Rayleigh, and he was encouraged by finding that McClelland, also at the Cavendish, had found the type of effect he expected using platinum. Richardson's detailed measurements on platinum, described in &#145;The electrical conductivity imparted to a vacuum by hot conductors&#146;  (<span class="italic">PTRS</span>, 201, 1903), fitted his formula<blockquote>
<i>i</i>=<i>A</i><sub>1</sub><i>T</i> <sup>&frac12;</sup> e<sup>-<i>&#966;/kT</i></sup>
</blockquote>where <i>A</i><sub>1</sub> is a constant, <i>k</i> is Boltzmann's constant, &#966; (the &#145;work function&#146;) is the energy needed to get the electrons over the barrier, <i>i</i> is the current, and <i>T</i> the temperature. However, difficulties in other fields of physics led to reconsideration of the theory from less specific thermodynamical approaches. As later described in his book <span class="italic">The Emission of Electricity from Hot Bodies</span> (1916), Richardson, Harold Albert Wilson, and several others at the Cavendish gradually improved the derivation of the emission formula obtaining<blockquote>
<i>i</i>=<i>A</i><sub>2</sub><i>T</i> <sup>2</sup> e<sup>-<i>&#966;/kT</i></sup>
</blockquote>which became known as Richardson's law, and which formed the basis for progress in radiotechnology. <i>A</i><sub>2</sub> is a constant different from <i>A</i><sub>1</sub>. Experimentally the formulae are difficult to distinguish because of the overwhelming control by the exponential term. The second formula has withstood the test of experiment and time, being unaffected by changing views of the nature of the electron gas. The basic, evaporation-potential barrier, idea is retained. Richardson was able to use his theory to create a link with electrical and thermal conductivity in metals, and also with photoelectricity. His contribution in this field was recognized by the award of the Nobel prize in physics in 1928. He coined the word thermion, hence thermionics referring to the emission of electricity&#151;negative or positive&#151;by hot bodies, in 1909.<br>
<br>The difficulties encountered raised other questions. Mathematical studies of ionic recombination contributed to understanding of what was going on in the imperfect vacuum outside the emitting surface. Experimental and theoretical investigations of diffusion problems&#151;such as hydrogen through palladium and platinum&#151;contributed to ideas on what was going on inside metals. These seem to have been guiding principles for Richardson's further Cambridge researches in physics, but an element of indecision regarding his future course is evident from other investigations in physical chemistry and from a record of an application for a chair of physical chemistry at Liverpool.<br>
<br>In 1906 Richardson was appointed to the chair of physics at Princeton, and in the same year, on 12 June, married Lilian Maud (1875/6&#150;1945), daughter of Albert William Wilson, goods manager to the North Eastern Railway Company at Darlington, and sister of his friend H. A. Wilson. The Richardsons had two sons and a daughter. At Princeton, Richardson built up a strong school of physics, A. H. Compton being his best-known pupil. His colleagues C. J. Davisson and O. Veblen married Richardson's two sisters. He continued to work on thermionic emission, looking at cooling and heating effects accompanying thermionic emission and absorption, reflection of slow electrons from metallic surfaces, theory of contact e.m.f. and thermo-electricity, and the emission of positive ions from heated salts. With F. C. Brown he verified that thermionic electrons have a Maxwellian velocity distribution. About the end of 1911 Richardson developed a theory of the photoelectric effect (in which electrons are emitted from a metal upon which ultraviolet light is falling). He again based his theory on the thermodynamics of the electrons, obtaining an emission law which was identical to Einstein's, but which did not require Einstein's assumption of the existence of light quanta&#151;particles of light  (<span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span>, 24, 1912). Concurrently he and his former student, K. T. Compton, in the most accurate experiments to date, verified the law predicted by both himself and Einstein  (<span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span>, 24, 1912, and 26, 1913).<br>
<br>In broader fields of electron physics Richardson speculated on the possibility of explaining gravitation in terms of electron theory, and in 1908 predicted a rotational reaction on magnetization of iron. He failed to detect this effect, but it was observed by Einstein and De Haas in 1919 and has been called the Richardson&#150;Einstein&#150;De Haas effect. The converse phenomenon, observed by S. J. Barnett (1914), has been termed the Richardson&#150;Barnett effect. These &#145;gyromagnetic&#146; and &#145;magneto-mechanical&#146; phenomena were more fully explained after the electron &#145;spin&#146; concept had been introduced by Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit in 1925.<br>
<br>In 1913 Richardson was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and the following year, after much deliberation, he returned to England to the Wheatstone chair of physics at King's College, London. His book <span class="italic">The Electron Theory of Matter</span> (1914), based on his Princeton lectures, provided the most comprehensive survey then available of electron theory and gave an even-handed treatment of both classical and modern theories. At King's, under the impact of the quantum theory and the stimulus of Bohr's explanation of the hydrogen spectrum, he began a protracted series of spectroscopic researches largely undertaken with C. B. Bazzoni, although thermionics, the photoelectric effect, metallic conduction, reflection of slow electrons from metals, emission of electrons in chemical reactions, and problems of theoretical physics continued to occupy him.<br>
<br>In 1924 Richardson was appointed Yarrow research professor of the Royal Society, being thereby relieved of teaching duties. He continued research, largely with T. Tanaka and later P. M. Davidson, primarily on the spectrum of molecular hydrogen, for which he had already published high resolution data. His book <span class="italic">Molecular Hydrogen and its Spectrum</span> (1934) is based on his Silliman memorial lectures at Yale in 1932. He acquired a magnificent reflection echelon with which he tested what have proved keystones of physics: theories of the spectra of atomic hydrogen and its isotopes. In 1940 he, with J. W. Drinkwater and W. E. Williams, published &#145;Determination of Rydberg constants, e/m, and fine structure of H<sub>&#945;</sub> and D<sub>&#945;</sub> with a reflexion echelon&#146;  (<span class="italic">PRS</span>, 174A, 164&#150;88 and 175A, 345), which gave by far the most accurate wave number measurements of hydrogen spectrum lines hitherto made. These experiments were intended as a test of Dirac's theory but a flaw in the analysis of the fine structure components (probably occasioned by disruption of work due to the imminence of war) most regrettably obscured a vital feature only cleared up in 1947 by Lamb and Retherford. Richardson's greatest project, to use the echelon for measurements on the Lyman &#945;-line, was abandoned because of the war, but before the evacuation of King's College in 1940 and the destruction of his laboratory by enemy action some measurements were obtained on fine structures in the molecular hydrogen spectrum which confirmed his previous work. With F. C. Chalklin and F. S. Robertson he studied the soft X-ray spectra of a number of metals, and in 1944 studied the reflection of very slow electrons by copper, with I. Gimpel. He continued scientific work long after retiring from his Yarrow professorship in 1944 and between 1901 and 1953 published, with his collaborators, more than 130 scientific papers.<br>
<br>Richardson received honorary degrees from Leeds, St Andrews, and London, and was a fellow of King's College, London (1925), and an honorary fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge (1941). From the Royal Society he received the Hughes medal (1920) and a royal medal (1930). He was knighted in 1939. He was president of the Physical Society in 1926&#150;8 and its honorary foreign secretary from 1928 to 1945.<br>
<br>Richardson was short, wiry, and sharp-featured. In his younger days he was fond of fell and mountain walking, sometimes alone, and could cover 40 miles in one day. He had been known to take a sleeper to Fort William, climb Ben Nevis, and return by the next sleeper. On returning to England in 1914 the Richardsons had settled in Hampstead, first in Cannon Place, and then at 45 Haverstock Hill. They had a home of extraordinary beauty containing the finest English period furniture and a wonderful collection of paintings by Dutch and other old masters. They kept a large and beautiful garden. They also maintained a country cottage in Sussex. Richardson had a fund of humorous after-dinner stories, sometimes told in the West Riding dialect, which he could speak perfectly. He had a hesitant but precise manner of speech. He kept a good table and a well-stocked cellar (wherein whisky was drawn from the wood). He rose late but seldom retired before 3 a.m.; this, he said, left it too late for burglars to start operations and he could work well in the early hours of the morning. He was a kindly man with much sympathy for refugees from totalitarian countries, whose misdirection of science he detested. He once remarked that he held practically no absolute conviction about anything except that science should be free. His work had practical applications in radio and other fields but he declined himself to be sidetracked from fundamental investigations.<br>
<br>In 1939 Richardson moved from Hampstead to Chandos Lodge, Alton, Hampshire. Partly as a war effort he bought a large farm at Medstead, nearby, which he supervised closely for several years. In 1945 his wife died and on 19 January 1948 he married Henrietta Maria Rupp (<i>b</i>. 1896/7), a physicist who was an early observer of electron diffraction. The divorced wife of E. Rupp, and daughter of an industrialist, J. Grunhut, she had been a family friend for many years. Richardson was president of the North-East Hampshire Agricultural Association in 1948&#150;9. He died at home in Alton of a cerebral thrombosis on 15 February 1959; his wife survived him.<br>
