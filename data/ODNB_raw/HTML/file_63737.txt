<span class="headword">Kennedy, Sir  John Noble</span>  (1893&#150;1970), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial governor</span>, was born at the manse, Portpatrick, Wigtownshire, Scotland, on 31 August 1893, the eldest of the six children&#151;four sons and two daughters&#151;of James Russell Kennedy (<i>b</i>. 1854), a Church of Scotland minister, and his wife, Sarah Maude Noble. Educated locally at Stranraer, he acquired a lifelong love of fishing and bird-watching. In 1911 he joined the navy as a paymaster-midshipman, but on the outbreak of war in 1914 managed to transfer to the army, fearful he might not see action. From the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, he was commissioned in 1915 as a (regular army) second lieutenant in the Royal Regiment of Artillery. He was wounded in 1916 and in 1917 won the MC for conspicuous gallantry in action. &#145;He, with three men, established an observation post in &#147;No-Man's Land&#148; and under a heavy hostile fire directed the fire of his battery most successfully&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Gazette</span>, 26 March 1917).<br>
<br>From 1919 to 1920 Kennedy served with the British military mission in south Russia, being appointed to the order of St Vladimir for helping to repel a cavalry attack near Moscow. He contributed papers to the <span class="italic">Royal Artillery Magazine</span> and was credited with inventing &#145;a new method of gun-laying &hellip; adopted for field and heavy artillery&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wigtown Free Press</span>, 5 May 1921). In 1926 Kennedy married Isabella Rosamond Georgiana Joicey-Cecil (<i>d</i>. 1941). They had three sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Between the wars Kennedy served in Egypt as well as England. In 1921 he was a student, and in the 1930s an instructor, at the Staff College, Camberley. There he caught the eye of the commandant, Sir John Dill, who in 1934 was appointed director of military operations (DMO) and in 1935 brought him into the War Office &#145;in charge of that section of the General Staff which devilled strategy and war plans for him&#146;  (Kennedy, 1). After attending the Imperial Defence College in 1938, Kennedy returned to Whitehall as deputy director of military operations, becoming in the following year director of plans. He had now found his true m&eacute;tier and, apart from two brief periods in France and Ireland and several frustrating months in hospital after being run down in the black-out in December 1939, spent the whole war in Whitehall.<br>
<br>As DMO from 1940 to 1943 and assistant chief of the Imperial General Staff (operations and intelligence) from 1943 to 1945, Kennedy gave loyal support, and was admired by successive holders of the post of chief of the Imperial General Staff, especially Sir Alan Brooke, who described his subordinate as &#145;a superb DMO gifted with broad strategic vision and the ability to express his thoughts in the clearest language&#146;  (Bryant, <span class="italic">Triumph in the West</span>, 41n.).<br>
<br>Kennedy's <span class="italic">The Business of War</span> (1957), based on notes he made at the time, gives an illuminating insight into the evolution and application of military strategy from 1938 to the end of 1944, and chronicles in detail the constant clashes between Churchill and his army advisers. &#145;Whenever an idea, however wild, was thrown up, he ordered detailed examinations, or plans, or both to be made at high speed&#146;  (Kennedy, 173). The War Office, concluded Kennedy, almost needed &#145;two staffs: one to deal with the prime minister, the other with the war&#146;  (ibid.). It was, Kennedy warned his subordinates, their duty to supply &#145;the military evidence&#146; for or against any proposal and to resist the &#145;tendency to modify wording &hellip; of papers submitted to the prime minister with the idea of making them more acceptable to him&#146;  (ibid., 93). There was an embarrassing encounter between the two men when in April 1941 Kennedy, in Brooke's words, &#145;infuriated the PM&#146; by arguing that plans should be prepared for the possible loss of Egypt, &#145;and was relegated amongst those &#147;many generals who are only too ready to surrender and who should be made examples of like Admiral Byng&#148;&#146;  (Bryant, <span class="italic">Turn of the Tide</span>, 254). Though shaken, Kennedy bravely stuck to his guns, commenting later: &#145;The charges of defeatism which Churchill hurled at us all continually and were so resented at first, came to be regarded &hellip; lightheartedly&#146;  (Kennedy, 146). A man of generous disposition&#151;his earlier accident had, he insisted, been &#145;my own fault&#146;&#151;Kennedy took in good part the abuse he had suffered. &#145;The massive figure of the great prime minister&#146;, he insisted, remained undiminished &#145;by glimpses of his petulance&#146;  (ibid., 356). Kennedy's first wife died in 1941 and the following year he married Catherine Fordham (<i>d</i>. 1969).<br>
<br>From December 1944 until the end of the war in August 1945 Kennedy was on sick leave, suffering primarily from exhaustion. In recognition of his contribution to the war effort, he received a knighthood in that year. However, he decided that to return to the army would be &#145;flogging a dead horse&#146;  (Kennedy, 355). Having retired, he was appointed governor of Southern Rhodesia, where he remained until it became part of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in August 1953. &#145;Here was a new world indeed,&#146; he wrote later, &#145;expanding, growing, buoyant, stimulating, refreshing; inhabited by the kindest people imaginable&#146;  (ibid.). These feelings were reciprocated. &#145;Both he and Lady Kennedy devoted themselves to the welfare of all sections of the community&#146;, wrote one local historian  (Kane, 239). &#145;He is regarded as one of the country's more open-minded governors &hellip; noted for his attempts to mix socially with Africans&#146;, confirmed another writer  (Rasmussen, 130), while his own chief justice considered him &#145;the best governor we ever had&#146;  (Tredgold, 225).<br>
<br>Kennedy makes no mention in his <span class="italic">Business of War</span> of his brother, James Russell Kennedy (<i>b</i>. 1895), who was commissioned into the Royal Artillery on the same day as himself and also served in Russia and at the War Office, before retiring in 1931 to edit <span class="italic">The Army, Navy and Air Force Gazette</span> and to write on military subjects. A progressive in military thinking&#151;he was a supporter of the tank enthusiast J. F. C. Fuller&#151;he became a political reactionary and fascist. J R, as he was known, was the author of several books on military matters, including <span class="italic">Modern War and Defence Reconstruction</span> (1936).<br>
<br>Sir John Kennedy briefly returned to Rhodesia in 1960 to chair a national convention on the country's future, but spent his final years enjoying country life in Scotland. He died at his home, Broxmouth House, Dunbar, East Lothian, on 15 June 1970. Although &#145;austere&#146;, recorded an obituary, and &#145;meticulous over detail&#146;, he remained &#145;hospitable, kindly and friendly, with&#146;&#151;his most striking characteristic&#151;&#145;a tremendous capacity for work&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). The honours Kennedy received for his distinguished service included KCVO (1947), KCMG (1952), and GCMG (1953).<br>
