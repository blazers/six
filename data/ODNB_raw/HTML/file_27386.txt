<span class="headword">Thorp, Sir  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1361), <span class="occ">justice</span>, was of obscure origins. He first appears as a clerk of the king's bench in 1315, and in that status was assaulted in 1318 by enemies who caught him on the way to court, trampled upon him, and contemptuously urinated on him. He is quoted in two cases during the eyres of 1329&#150;31. At this time an apprentice, he was created a serjeant-at-law in Michaelmas term 1339, while on 20 January 1341 he became a king's serjeant, an office he held until 1344. He was elevated to justice of the king's bench on 20 May 1345, and was knighted at the same time. Promotion to chief justice of the king's bench came soon after, on 16 November 1346.<br>
<br>Venality may have been a constant companion to Thorp's judicial skill, and helps to explain how he came to hold a considerable collection of estates in several counties, particularly in Lincolnshire. An ordinance of 1346 prohibited justices from taking fees and robes from anyone but the king, and from giving advice in any matters relating to the king's affairs. Thorp took this oath in an impressive gathering attended by the king, prelates, and magnates; the king pointedly and personally warned him about the penalties for breaking the oath, namely, death by hanging and confiscation of all goods. The stringencies of the new oath were balanced, however inadequately, by an additional annual fee of 50 marks provided for each justice. However, Thorp persisted in his older and more profitable ways, maintaining close relationships with the town of Cambridge, the abbot of Glastonbury, and especially the abbot of Ramsey, from whom he accepted a retaining fee within a year of the ordinance, and by whom he was feed in 1347&#150;50, 1354&#150;5, and 1361&#150;2. As he later admitted, he took bribes amounting to &pound;100 (probably at Lincoln sessions, Easter term 1349) for respiting the exigent against five men who appeared before him.<br>
<br>Thorp was arrested on 25 October 1350 and imprisoned in the Tower of London. He was tried on 4 November by an imposing panel (the earls of Warwick, Arundel, and Huntingdon, the steward of the royal household, and the king's chamberlain). After he confessed his receipt of bribes, the judges ordered confiscation and sought the king's will. An angry Edward III, apparently seeing Thorp's misdeeds as a rebellious breaking of the personal bond between justice and sovereign, told his judges to proceed; they decreed hanging and confiscation of Thorp's considerable wealth&#151;his moveables were deposited in no fewer than eight monastic houses. Yet by a privy seal letter issued the same day the king pardoned Thorp his life. The imprisonment continued, however, as did the seizures of land and goods. On 24 November the records of the case were sent into chancery, and a new investigation into all aspects of Thorp's judicial proceedings was also ordered. Thorp was released before Christmas, for he and his household spent that holiday as guests of his old friend, the abbot of Ramsey. In the parliament of February 1351 the entire proceedings in the case were laid before the magnates, who approved the sentence.<br>
<br>On 10 March 1351 Edward (citing compassion and appreciation for Thorp's previous good service) provided him with a full pardon and restoration of goods and lands. On 24 May 1352 Thorp was appointed second baron of the exchequer, and he soon was named to a variety of judicial commissions, although he was never returned to the king's bench. Along with other royal justices he was formally excommunicated in 1357 for his failure to appear at the papal court in Avignon in the case of Thomas Lisle, bishop of Ely (<i>d</i>. 1361). His last judicial service seems to have been an oyer and terminer commission for several counties in 1359. He remained on the books of Ramsey Abbey as recipient of a fee until his death, which occurred on 27 May 1361. He appears to have had a son, William, who was pardoned in May 1356 for killing a servant in the New Temple, London.<br>
