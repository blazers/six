<span class="headword">Bisse,  Thomas</span>  (1675&#150;1731), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and founder of the Three Choirs festival</span>, was baptized on 6 April 1675 at Oldbury on the Hill, Gloucestershire, one of two sons of John Bisse (<i>c</i>.1638&#150;1686), rector of that parish, and his wife, Joyce Gyles. Bisse came from a Somerset clerical family of long standing and, at times, distinction. His elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2476/', "Philip Bisse (bap. 1666, d. 1721)")</script>, was bishop of Hereford (1713&#150;21). Thomas entered Corpus Christi College, Oxford, in 1691, and later became a fellow; he graduated BA in 1695, and proceeded MA in 1698, BD in 1708 and DD in 1712. He was ordained deacon at Oxford on 4 June 1699. In 1715 he was preacher at the Rolls Chapel, London.<br>
<br>On becoming bishop of Hereford in 1713 Philip Bisse appointed Thomas to a prebend in Hereford Cathedral and to the incumbency of Cradley and part of Ledbury. There is evidence of non-residence at least until 1716, when his Cradley churchwardens acidly noted that Bisse was always in London. But in that year his brother promoted him to the chancellorship of the cathedral and to the prebend of Colwall in place of the nonjuring John Harvey, who had been deprived of both. In the same year Bisse also succeeded Harvey as rector of Weston under Penyard, Herefordshire, where he added a brewhouse to the parsonage. He held his chancellorship, the two prebends, and all his Hereford livings until his death, but his parishes were well tended by curates in his absence.<br>
<br>Besides these offices Bisse is chiefly remembered in musical circles as the instigator in 1724 of the Three Choirs festival, which survived to become the oldest musical festival in the country. Before moving to Herefordshire he had been much impressed by the annual charity services for the Corporation of the Sons of the Clergy in London (founded in 1655); these took the form of a choral service and an appropriate sermon, one of which Bisse had preached at St Paul's. On his arrival in Herefordshire he became an enthusiastic supporter of the existing occasional meetings of the three cathedral choirs of Hereford, Gloucester, and Worcester, and at Bisse's suggestion these meetings were put on a regular footing, possibly in 1716 or 1717, and certainly by 1724; each cathedral took a turn every three years, and there was a sermon in support of the orphans of clergy in the three dioceses. Nowadays the sermon is preached on the Sunday preceding the festival.<br>
<br>Bisse was regarded as an eloquent preacher. Among the subjects of his published sermons are defence of episcopacy and charity schools, but perhaps the most notable are <span class="italic">The Beauty of Holiness in the Common Prayer</span> (1716), <span class="italic">A Rationale on Cathedral Worship or Choir-Service</span> (1720), and <span class="italic">Musick the Delight of the Sons of Men</span>, the last preached at the Three Choirs festival in 1726. He also published two Latin poems, <span class="italic">Lusus poetica olim conscripti</span> (1720) and <span class="italic">Microscopium</span> (1721). He died on 22 April 1731. It is not known whether he was married.<br>
