<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fage,  Arthur</span>  (1890&#150;1977), <span class="occ">aerodynamicist</span>, was born on 4 March 1890 at Portsmouth, the youngest in a family of two sons and two daughters born to William John Fage (1859&#150;1947), coppersmith at Portsmouth Dockyard, and his wife, Annie Crook (1862&#150;1943). Educated at Portsmouth secondary school from 1901 to 1904, Fage successfully competed for a shipwright apprenticeship at Portsmouth Dockyard, where he met Ernest Relf (1888&#150;1970), who was to become his lifelong friend and professional colleague. The dockyard apprenticeships, combining practice with study at the Royal Dockyard School, provided a thorough and rigorous training. Fage survived the course, carried off three Admiralty prizes, and spent his fifth year at the Haslar ship tank, with evening classes at Portsmouth Municipal College, where he won prizes for mathematics and theoretical mechanics. In 1909 he won a royal exhibition to the Royal College of Science, South Kensington, where he chose to specialize in mechanics. He enjoyed sports, played football and cricket, and for many years was an enthusiastic long-distance walker, touring in England, Scotland, Germany, and Switzerland.<br>
<br>At the end of three years Fage, who had achieved the highest marks in all subjects and a first class associateship of the Royal College of Science, was offered a research scholarship tenable at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), Teddington, to work on a topic allied to aeronautics. Relf had preceded him as a junior assistant in the aeronautics section, and Fage joined for a two-year spell as student assistant, assigned to a variety of projects. He obtained his diploma of Imperial College in 1914 and, as the First World War coincided with the end of his studentship, he was formally appointed to the staff of the NPL.<br>
<br>At this time the science of aerodynamics was ill-defined, its components, such as fluid mechanics, pressure distribution on the ground and on aircraft and airships in flight, and its effect on their structure and component materials, little known. Fage and his colleagues undertook research on many of these aspects. During 1914 he wrote a popular book, <span class="italic">The Aeroplane</span> (1915), into which he managed to compress the whole of aeronautical engineering, with little mathematics. The book was immediately popular; by 1918 it was in its fifth edition and had also been published in the USA. After the war Fage continued his investigations into the theory and practical engineering of airscrews and published extensively; in 1917&#150;18 he had lectured around Britain. He became ultimately a world authority on this topic. This expertise led to his specialist monograph, <span class="italic">Airscrews in Theory and Experiment</span> (1920). He married on 1 September 1920 a colleague from the NPL physics department, Winifred Eliza (<i>d</i>. 1951), a botany graduate and daughter of Thomas H. Donnelly, master builder, of Kimberley, Nottinghamshire. It was a most happy marriage. Their son, John Donnelly Fage (<i>b</i>. 1921), rose to eminence as a professor of African history; their daughter, Christine Mary Fage, later Richards (<i>b</i>. 1924), joined the staff of the University of Durham.<br>
<br>By 1925 Fage had turned to the extremely complex problem of pure fluid mechanics and turbulence. He had already looked at the lift and drag, slipstream effects, and wake turbulence set up by aerofoils; now he concentrated on experimental work associated with these movements, both in free air and within pipes. With H. C. H. Townend he devised the fluid motion microscope, which enabled him to study under high magnification the movement of illuminated ultramicroscopic particles in turbulent water, and to apply the results to similar motions in air. This fruitful research was publicized in numerous papers in the aeronautical and scientific literature, and in his many lectures. It brought Fage, since 1918 a fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society, the Edward Busk memorial prize (1928), founder membership of the (American) Institute of the Aeronautical Sciences (1933), corresponding membership of the Lilienthal Gesellschaft f&uuml;r Luftfahrtforschung (1937)&#151;he travelled to Berlin in 1936 and Munich in 1937&#151;and, in 1942, election to the Royal Society.<br>
<br>With the outbreak of the Second World War and the arrival of high-speed aircraft, Fage and his colleagues at the NPL were confronted with problems of transonic and supersonic flow. On 1 January 1946 he succeeded Relf as superintendent of the aerodynamics division. New wind tunnels were built to assist with problems of high-speed aerodynamics, in which he took a close interest. However, administrative duties precluded any further personal research, for much of his time was spent on committee work with the Aeronautical Research Council, various government departments, and aircraft companies, and necessarily involved lengthy overseas travel. Following the death of his wife in 1951 Fage lost his zest for work, and he retired from the NPL in June 1953, being then appointed CBE. He continued to travel abroad, and about 1955 moved to Winchelsea, where he took up painting. He returned to Teddington for five years, then gave up his committee work and moved to Yockleton, Shropshire, to be near his daughter. He died at Yockleton Grange on 7 November 1977. An obituarist summed him up as &#145;one who had led a full life, and had done more than most men. He was widely respected, and held in high esteem and indeed affection by the colleagues of his later years and by others close to him&#146;  (Collar, 49).<br>
