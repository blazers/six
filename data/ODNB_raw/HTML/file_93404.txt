<span class="headword">Giri, Varahagiri Venkata</span>  (1894&#150;1980), <span class="occ">trade unionist and president of India</span>, was born on 10 August 1894 in Berhampore in the Ganjam district of the Madras presidency, India, the second child in the family of seven boys and five girls of V. V. Jogaiah Pantulu (<i>b</i>. 1869), lawyer, and his wife, Venkata Subadramma. On his mother's side he came from a prosperous Andhra-Neogi Brahman family, originally from Kakinada in the Godavari district of the Madras presidency, who had relocated in 1869 to Berhampore. His father had come to reside in Berhampore after his marriage to Giri's mother, who was the daughter of Berhampore's distinguished pleader D. V. Ramaiah Pantulu. Jogaiah also thrived in legal practice. He was an avid nationalist as well. A member of the Swaraj Party (founded by Motilal Nehru and Chittaranjan Das), he was elected to the central legislative assembly (1927&#150;30) and, following the act of 1935, to the Madras legislative council. He was also a supporter of the movement for creating the Bengal Nagpur Railway Indian Labour Union. On his own admission Giri imbibed the solid middle-class virtues of thrift, hard work, and punctuality, as well as his nationalist politics, from his parents and grandparents. <br>
<br>Giri's early education was completed at Khallikote College High School at Berhampore, from where he went to Madras and passed the senior Cambridge examination in 1912. The next year he left for the National University and the inns of court, Dublin, with a view to studying law. In Dublin he was drawn into the cross-currents of the Irish struggle for self-government, which furnished a parallel to the contemporary Indian nationalist struggle for <i>Swaraj</i> (self-rule). With other members of the Indian student community of the university he formed the Anarchical Society; he was also elected secretary of the Indian Students' Association. Suspected of associating with those implicated in the Easter rebellion of 1916, he was ordered by the British government to leave the UK by 1 July that year. Meanwhile he had been called to the Irish bar, though he was yet to be awarded his degree. <br>
<br>Giri returned to India in September 1916 and enrolled as an advocate of the Madras high court. He also joined the Indian National Congress and began participating in the Home Rule League spearheaded by Annie Besant. In 1917 he married Saraswati Bai, from Bellary. He gave up his law practice in 1921 in order to engage fully in the Indian freedom movement led by Mahatma Gandhi, who was calling for the withdrawal of lawyers from the courts as part of his non-co-operation movement. Aiming to induct the working class into the national movement, in 1922 he became president of the Bengal Nagpur Railway Indian Labour Union and devoted his energy to forming a federation of all the railway unions in British India. Thus the All-India Railwaymen's Federation, with its headquarters at Berhampore and with Giri as its first general secretary, came into being in 1923. Three years later Giri was elected president of the All-India Trade Union Congress at its Madras session (he was elected president a second time in 1942). He represented the Indian workers at the International Labour Congress in Geneva in 1927, and attended the second Round Table conference (September&#150;December 1931) in London as British India's labour representative. In the early 1930s he organized trade unions in support of Gandhi's civil disobedience movement. <br>
<br>Giri became a member of the Indian legislative assembly in 1934. In 1936 he won a landmark victory over the raja of Bobbili, leader of the Justice Party and erstwhile chief minister, in the general election in Madras and became the minister of labour, industries, co-operation, and commerce in Chakravarti Rajagopalachari's Congress ministry of 1937&#150;9. He had always been concerned for India's economic plans and in October 1938, at a conference of Congress industrial ministers, he spoke on the need for planning and industrialization. When the national planning committee was established in 1939 he became its convener. In that year the Congress decided against co-operating with the British government in the Second World War and Congress ministers in the Indian provinces resigned in October 1939. Giri was incarcerated in January 1940 for participating in anti-war protests, released in March 1941, and arrested again in August for participating in the Quit India movement. After his release he once again became labour minister of Madras in 1946, though he resigned after a short while on the fall of the cabinet that had appointed him. <br>
<br>Following India's independence in 1947, Giri served as the first Indian high commissioner in Ceylon, until 1951. In the general election of 1952 he was elected to the Lok Sabha (the lower house of the Indian parliament) as a Congress candidate and became the minister of labour. In October of that year he adumbrated what became known as the &#145;Giri approach&#146;, highlighting his faith in collective bargaining rather than compulsory adjudication, at the twelfth session of the Indian Labour Conference. The next year he succeeded in getting an amendment to the <span class="roman">Industrial Disputes Act</span> of 1947 that safeguarded workers against redundancy without due advance notice or compensation. He resigned from the government in August 1954 when the cabinet, against his wishes, decided to amend an award given by the industrial appellate tribunal in a dispute involving banks and their employees. The next few years saw his political career in limbo, but in 1957 he was appointed governor of Uttar Pradesh. He was subsequently governor of Kerala (1960&#150;65) and Mysore (1965&#150;67). He served as vice-president of India (1967&#150;9) and finally as the country's fourth president, from 24 August 1969 to 23 August 1974. His presidency was marked by India's victory over Pakistan in the war of 1971, which resulted in East Pakistan's emergence as the new sovereign nation of Bangladesh. <br>
<br>Giri was a prolific writer and among his works two were considered by contemporaries to be magisterial: <span class="italic">Industrial Relations</span> (1955) and <span class="italic">Labour Problems in Indian Industry</span> (1959). The V. V. Giri National Labour Institute was founded in 1974 as an autonomous body of the Ministry of Labour and Employment of the government of India. He received India's highest civilian decoration, the Bharat Ratna (jewel of India) in January 1975. He died in Madras on 24 June 1980, and was survived by his wife and several children.<br>
