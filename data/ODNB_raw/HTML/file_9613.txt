<span class="headword">Reginald fitz Jocelin</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Reginald Italus, Reginald Lombardus]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1140&#150;1191), <span class="occ">bishop of Bath and archbishop-elect of Canterbury</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50340/', "Jocelin de Bohun")</script>, bishop of Salisbury, and was related to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23716/', "Earl Robert of Gloucester (d. 1147)")</script> and to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24732/', "Savaric fitz Geldwin (d. 1205)")</script>, whom Emperor Heinrich VI (<i>r</i>. 1191&#150;7) in 1191 referred to as his own kinsman. It has been plausibly suggested that Reginald's mother belonged to the family of the Savoyard counts of Maurienne. Reginald was born <i>c</i>.1140 and brought up in Italy, whence his epithets Lombardus and Italus. Appointed archdeacon of Wiltshire by his father by 1161, he entered the service of Archbishop Thomas Becket, perhaps in 1162, and went to Paris to study letters (1163&#150;4), carrying a recommendation to Bishop Hugues of Soissons (the French king's chancellor) from Pope Alexander III (<i>r</i>. 1159&#150;81) himself. Louis VII (<i>r</i>. 1137&#150;80) assigned the abbey of St Exuperius, Corbeil, to him. Philip Augustus of France attested Reginald's long-standing friendship with Louis VII when he wrote in support of his election to Canterbury in 1191.<br>
<br>However, Reginald did not stay at Paris long enough to acquire the title of master, for he is recorded in Henry II's service from <i>c</i>.1167. From that moment he was a loyal supporter both of the king and of his father, and so lost the friendship of the exiled Becket circle, although he had provided horses for an anonymous Becket messenger in mid-1164. He became one of Henry II's principal emissaries to the papal curia, representing the king's interests against Becket in 1167&#150;8, 1169, 1169&#150;70, and to the papal nuncios Vivian and Gratian in August 1169. After Becket's murder (29 December 1170) he was sent once more to present the king's case at the papal curia (January&#150;April 1171); and his good service was rewarded in 1173, when Henry II secured his election to the see of Bath, one of four &#145;enemies of the Martyr&#146;  (Bouquet and others, 14.645) to be so promoted. His election and theirs (and also that of Richard of Dover to Canterbury) were challenged by Henry, the Young King, who alleged illegitimacy and uncanonical process against him, and he went to the papal curia in the company of Archbishop-elect Richard to defend his position. Walter Map claimed that Reginald succeeded only through bribery; but the well-informed Ralph de Diceto records that he had to clear himself by oath of complicity in Becket's death, and provide sworn evidence that his conception had taken place before his father became a priest, before being consecrated at St Jean-de-Maurienne by the archbishops of Canterbury and Tarentaise on 23 June 1174. In the company of Archbishop Richard he met the king at Barfleur (8&#150;9 August) and was enthroned at Bath on 24 November.<br>
<br>Reginald at once began to take his place in the public affairs of the kingdom. In 1175 he attended the provincial council of Westminster in May, and the royal council of Woodstock in July, and in 1176 was present at the king's Easter court at Winchester. Recorded at the Westminster council of March 1177, he attested a royal charter at Rouen in the following September, and may have taken part immediately afterwards in the negotiations with Louis VII which led to the treaty of Ivry, although he is not recorded as a witness. These secular duties were interrupted in 1178 by his participation in the joint Anglo-French mission against Cathar heretics in Toulouse, led by Cardinal Pierre of San Crisogono, but Reginald attended that year's Christmas court at Winchester, before going to the Third Lateran Council in March 1179. On his return journey he persuaded Hugh of Avalon to take charge of the Carthusian house of Witham in Somerset, founded by Henry II in partial expiation for Becket's murder. During the 1180s he is only occasionally recorded as attending courts and councils, probably because during that decade his energies were largely devoted to the administration of his diocese, though in 1186 he attended councils at Oxford and Woodstock. But at the coronation of Richard I, on 3 September 1189, he appears in a distinguished position, processing on the king's left hand.<br>
<br>Reginald was by then one of the longest-serving bishops in England, though not yet fifty, enjoying the precedence of noble descent and experience, and in a position to play a more forceful role in the new reign. He attended the Council of Pipewell on 15 September, and was probably the Reginaldus Italus who unsuccessfully offered Richard I &pound;4000 for the chancellorship. On the king's instructions he secured the legatine title for his rival, Bishop William de Longchamp (<i>d</i>. 1197), but he then supported Archbishop Geoffrey of York against Longchamp, and in October 1191 colluded in the latter's overthrow. His own long-standing support of the Canterbury monks against Archbishop Baldwin's foundation of a church at Hackington, dedicated to St Stephen and St Thomas the Martyr, made him a strong contender for the archbishopric when Baldwin died at Acre in 1190, and the monks immediately elected him (27 November 1191), rejecting Richard I's candidate, Guglielmo, archbishop of Monreale. The new justiciar, Walter de Coutances (<i>d</i>. 1207), challenged the election; but before the matter could be resolved, on 24 December, Reginald was struck down by paralysis at Dogmersfield in Hampshire, having arranged the election of his kinsman Savaric to Bath. In his only surviving letter as archbishop-elect, dictated on his deathbed on Christmas day, he requested the monastic habit from the prior of Christ Church. He died the following day and was buried near the high altar of Bath Abbey on 29 December 1191&#151;the feast of St Thomas of Canterbury. According to Richard of Devizes, he received the monastic habit from Prior Walter of Bath, with the words, &#145;God did not wish me to be an archbishop, nor do I. He wished me to be your monk, and so do I&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chronicon Richardi Divisensis</span>, 56). After his death miraculous cures were attributed to his intercession.<br>
<br>Although Becket considered him a turncoat, Peter of Blois (<i>d</i>. 1212) wrote first (1169&#150;70) that Reginald desired reconciliation with his old master, but was prevented by his associates and by devotion to his father, whom Becket had suspended and interdicted; and later (1173&#150;4) that his defence of his father was understandable, and that he was not alone in misjudging the martyr. Since Peter and Jocelin were friends, these testimonials may be suspect; but Herbert of Bosham (<i>d</i>. 1194) spoke highly of him in his account of the <i>eruditi sancti Thome</i> (&#145;St Thomas's learned men&#146;), declaring that he had returned to St Thomas after the murder. This judgement is confirmed both by his dedication of a church of St Thomas the Martyr at St L&ocirc;, in Normandy, on his return from Italy in 1174, and by his commission in 1176 of a reliquary pendant containing relics of St Thomas for Queen Margaret of Sicily, mother of William II of Sicily (<i>r</i>. 1166&#150;89), whom Henry II's daughter Joanna married in 1177.<br>
<br>Although Peter of Blois recorded Reginald's delight in hawking (and he secured from Richard I the right to have hunting dogs throughout Somerset), he was a hard-working diocesan bishop. More <i>acta</i> survive from his episcopate than from that of any other twelfth-century bishop of Bath&#151;122 in all, at least 73 of them datable to the period 1180&#150;91. Moreover, they reveal a conscientious pastoral bishop. He regulated the relationship between monasteries and the vicars of appropriated churches, to the benefit of the latter, by insisting on rights of tenure and adequate endowment, and as a judge-delegate he applied the latest canonical rules in the execution of papal commissions. At Bath he founded the hospital of St John in 1180, so that the poor and sick could have the benefit of the waters. At Wells he built part of the nave of the future cathedral, and provided funds for the completion of work on the fabric by ordering that the incomes of vacant churches should be devoted to it. He confirmed the canons in nine prebendal churches, and increased their common fund. He erected the liberty of Glastonbury Abbey into an archdeaconry, and made the abbot a member of the Wells chapter. He confirmed the burghal status of the town of Wells, defined its boundaries, and added to its privileges. Reginald's early death may well have deprived Canterbury of a distinguished archbishop&#151;as it was, he was commemorated there with archiepiscopal honours.<br>
