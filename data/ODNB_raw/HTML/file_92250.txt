<span class="headword">Kerruish, Sir  (Henry) Charles</span>  (1917&#150;2003), <span class="occ">politician and farmer</span>, was born on 23 July 1917 at Ballafayle, Maughold, Isle of Man, the only child of Henry Howard Kerruish (<i>bap</i>. 1872, <i>d</i>. 1938), farmer, and his wife, Clara May, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kewin (1877&#150;1961). Ballafayle, Kerruish's lifelong home, had been farmed by his family since 1725. He was educated nearby at the village school at the Dhoon, then at Ramsey grammar school. He showed little inclination for academic work, and left school in 1933 to work on his father's farm. There he learned ploughing, cattle-rearing, and sheep-shearing, and took a particular interest in the breeding and exhibition of horses. When his father died in 1938 he took over the farm, and negotiated a bank loan to buy the adjacent holding, doubling the size of his farm from 80 to 160 acres. During the Second World War he was, as a farmer, exempt from conscription, but served as a lieutenant in the Home Guard. On 12 November 1942 he married Margaret Gell (1918&#150;1970) of Peel. They had four children, three girls and a boy, between 1945 and 1954.<br>
<br>Among the young farmers' clubs in the north of the island Kerruish developed skills in public speaking and chairing meetings, and an interest in politics. He first stood for election to the House of Keys (the lower house of Tynwald, the Manx parliament) in 1943, his only defeat. In 1946 he was elected as member (MHK) for Garff, his local constituency. Like most MHKs he sat as an independent. At twenty-nine he was the youngest member of the Manx legislature. He soon established himself as a vigorous and capable MHK, attentive to his constituents. He argued against the continuation of conscription, and for higher pay for farm labourers. He was critical of the powers exercised by the governor and his appointed executive council, and campaigned for the Keys to control national finances and for genuine home rule. In 1955 he was co-opted to the executive council, and elected as chairman of the health services board, but this did not inhibit his reforming zeal.<br>
<br>The appointment of Sir Ronald Garvey as the island's governor in 1959 (he served until 1966) initiated a period of reform and development during which Kerruish became the island's most prominent politician. As the holiday industry declined, new policies were developed to sustain the island's economy, including the encouragement of new residents and light industry, and lower taxation to stimulate business and finance. Kerruish was not primarily responsible for the details of economic policy, but he identified himself with the new initiatives and co-operated on most issues with Garvey. His popularity in the Keys led to his election in 1962, aged forty-four, as the youngest speaker of the Keys in Manx history. A month later Garvey appointed him as chairman of the executive council, and he also continued to chair the health services board until 1966. In 1964 he was appointed OBE.<br>
<br>This accumulation of power aroused resentment against &#145;King Charles&#146;, as Kerruish was sometimes called. He was riding high in the 1960s, often leading deputations to the Home Office to protest about the threat of Common Market membership or restrictions placed on Manx Radio. But after 1966 most MHKs wanted him cut down to size. New laws were passed in 1968 making it impossible for the speaker to head a department or join the executive council. Henceforth Kerruish was restricted to his role as speaker, still an influential position. In 1970 he suffered a personal tragedy with the death of his wife, Margaret, but on 4 January 1975 he was married again, to an Englishwoman, Kathleen Emily (Kay) Warriner, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hardie (<i>b</i>. 1923), a principal education assistant from Weybridge, Surrey.<br>
<br>By the later 1970s Manx politics had entered a more settled period, the UK government having negotiated an acceptable associate membership of the EEC for the Isle of Man, which allowed the island to retain its own taxation system. The governor's powers were whittled down until he became more of a constitutional figurehead. Kerruish took a greater interest in issues of Manx culture and heritage, culminating in the historically dubious choice of 1979 as Tynwald's millennium year. Ceremonial events were his forte, and in 1979 he was knighted. Since 1957 he had found a niche on the international stage through attendance at Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conferences. This was a discussion forum which enabled him to travel widely, meet most leading Commonwealth politicians, and publicize the Isle of Man and its case for greater self-determination. He was on the executive for many years, and president in 1984 when the annual conference was held on the island. He was the longest-serving presiding officer in the Commonwealth.<br>
<br>In the 1980s Kerruish continued, as speaker, to press not for complete independence, but for &#145;recognition as a self-governing territory&#146;. In 1990 the governor relinquished his right to chair Tynwald and the legislative council, or upper house. Kerruish was elected by his colleagues as first president of Tynwald, and retired from the Keys, having held his Garff seat through nine elections. He was re-elected president of Tynwald in 1996. Throughout the 1990s he continued to criticize Manx governments for being too conciliatory towards the UK. His opponents argued that the island had already achieved the effective self-government he had always sought. In 2000 Kerruish finally retired from politics after nearly fifty-four years in the legislature. For his remaining three years he continued farming, now on some 6000 acres. On several occasions over the years his private activities as an entrepreneurial farmer had brought him into conflict with the Manx government.<br>
<br>As a politician Kerruish had many devoted supporters, but also a number of critics. To his friends he showed warmth, charm, and courtesy, but he could also be a formidable enemy. His remarkable persistence, political longevity, and powerful character ensured his position as the dominant Manx politician of the second half of the twentieth century. As a constitutional reformer he made a large contribution to continuing and completing the agenda for Manx self-government begun by Samuel Norris in the first half of the century. He died after a series of strokes on 23 July 2003, his eighty-sixth birthday, in Noble's Hospital, Strang, Braddan, near Douglas, and was buried a week later in Maughold churchyard. He was survived by his second wife, Kay, and the four children of his first marriage, two of whom, Clare Christian and Anne Craine, were at the time of his death members of the Manx legislature.<br>
