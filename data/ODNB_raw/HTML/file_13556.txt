</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Holles,  John</span>, duke of Newcastle upon Tyne  (1662&#150;1711), <span class="occ">landowner and politician</span>, was born on 9 January 1662, probably in Nottinghamshire, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13553/', "Gilbert Holles, third earl of Clare (1633&#150;1689)")</script>, and his wife, Grace (<i>d</i>. 1702), daughter of William Pierrepont of Thoresby, Nottinghamshire. From his father's accession to the earldom in 1666 he was known as Lord Haughton. Nothing seems to be known of his education beyond that he enjoyed &#145;all the advantages of education at home and abroad&#146;  (Collins, 178). He was the dedicatee of John Dryden's <span class="italic">The Spanish Fryar</span> in 1681, but there is no evidence that he was at court at this period.<br>
<br>In November 1688 Haughton waited on William of Orange as a representative of the supporters of the risings at York and Nottingham. He was elected to the Convention Parliament as a member for Nottinghamshire on 14 January 1689, but two days after his election his father died and he became fourth earl of Clare and inherited the Holles estates, mainly in Nottinghamshire and London. In the Lords he voted for the transfer of the crown to William and Mary, and was rewarded with the offices of gentleman of the bedchamber to William and lord lieutenant of Middlesex. Soon afterwards his mother suggested to her sister Frances, wife of Henry Cavendish, second duke of Newcastle, that he marry Newcastle's third but favourite daughter, Margaret (1661&#150;1716). The marriage took place on 1 March 1690. By his will of May 1691 Newcastle left his estates, which were mainly in the east midlands and Northumberland, to Margaret and the heirs of her body, provided the estates remained undivided in the blood of the Cavendishes and that Margaret's descendants took the name of Cavendish in honour of the first duke of Newcastle. Clare vigorously defended the settlement in the court of chancery against Ralph Montagu, first earl of Montagu, who had married Newcastle's eldest daughter, Elizabeth, and Thomas Tufton, sixth earl of Thanet, who had married Newcastle's fourth daughter, Catherine. Chancery rejected all attempts to invalidate the will; the duel which Thanet and Clare fought on 13 May 1692 saw both wounded and did nothing to change the issue.<br>
<br>Clare, supported by his father-in-law, applied for a dukedom on 18 April 1691, but William III refused. The death of the duke on 26 July 1691 brought him the Newcastle estates, where he was able to pay an outstanding mortgage of &pound;80,000. Disappointed at not receiving the dukedom he sought, Clare resigned as gentleman of the bedchamber and (in 1692) lord lieutenant of Middlesex, and retired to his estates, where he proved an informed and careful steward. On the death of his unmarried kinsman Denzil Holles, third Baron Holles of Ifield, on 25 January 1694, he succeeded to his property scattered throughout southern England. Clare also spent about &pound;200,000 adding to the Nottinghamshire properties, re-creating the Holles interest in Lincolnshire, and acquiring substantial estates in Cambridgeshire, Bedfordshire and Huntingdonshire.<br>
<br>Clare was an informed and careful steward of his estates. He was, in the estimation of Bishop Burnet, &#145;the richest subject that had been in England for some ages&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, ed. Burnet and Burnet, 2.579), and on 14 May 1694 he was created marquess of Clare and duke of Newcastle upon Tyne. The next month he became lord lieutenant of Nottinghamshire. In October 1695 he reportedly spent &pound;5042 on entertaining William III at Welbeck Abbey, inherited through his wife, which became his principal residence instead of the Holles family seat of Haughton. As long promised he was installed KG on 7 July 1698. His support for the junto ministry was rewarded in August 1699 with the lieutenancy of the East Riding of Yorkshire and the wardenship of the New Forest.<br>
<br>Newcastle became one of the leading electoral patrons of his day. At the core of his interest were East Retford in Nottinghamshire and Dorchester in Dorset, where he became high steward in January 1701. He purchased control of Aldborough, Yorkshire, and in neighbouring Boroughbridge his acquisitions in alliance with one of its leading families enabled him to significantly influence the return. In the first years of Anne's reign Newcastle voted with the whigs but, as before, he had little interest in major political office, until in March 1705 his friend Robert Harley persuaded him to join the Godolphin&#150;Marlborough administration as lord privy seal. He was also sworn of the privy council and became lord lieutenant of the North Riding of Yorkshire, and from 1706 to 1707 was a commissioner for the union with Scotland. In the last two sessions of the parliament of 1705&#150;8 Newcastle had a tight personal following of ten members, &#145;nearly all of whom were either mainly or entirely indebted&#146; to him for their seats  (Holmes, 225). His wealth and influence enabled him to act independently and he remained lord privy seal after the reconstruction of the ministry and tory victory in 1710. He was rewarded with more local offices, becoming chief justice in eyre, north of Trent, from September 1710, and lord lieutenant of Middlesex in July 1711. Newcastle seemed set to enjoy his extended influence; he was trusted by Queen Anne and by Harley, although his adherence to the ministry had shaken his whig friends and was regarded with misgiving by some tories. However, on 13 July 1711 he fell from his horse while stag-hunting at Welbeck, and died there on 15 July. He was buried on 9 August 1711 at Westminster Abbey, &#145;under a sumptuous monument&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>).<br>
<br>Newcastle's will of 29 August 1707 was the object of much critical comment by contemporaries, but underlines the priorities which governed his life. He attempted to keep the majority of his estates undivided and perpetuate his family's name. The bulk of his estate was left to his nephew, Thomas Pelham [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21801/', "Holles, Thomas Pelham-, duke of Newcastle upon Tyne and first duke of Newcastle under Lyme")</script>], the son of his sister Grace who had married Thomas Pelham, first Baron Pelham of Laughton. The duchess of Newcastle received her jointure. Their only child, Henrietta (1694&#150;1755) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53530/', "Harley, Henrietta Cavendish, countess of Oxford and Mortimer")</script>], was given a marriage portion of &pound;20,000 and the former Cavendish properties in Staffordshire, Northumberland, and Yorkshire provided she did not enter upon or sue for any other parts of her father's real estate. The duchess and her daughter, who in 1713 married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12337/', "Edward Harley, later second earl of Oxford and Mortimer")</script>, contested the will, claiming that Newcastle had no right to dispose of the Cavendish estate. After protracted litigation and the death of the duchess a settlement was agreed and given statutory form in 1719. Henrietta now received, with the exception of Nottingham Castle, all the properties that Newcastle had inherited from his father-in-law, the last Cavendish duke, in 1691, including Welbeck and Bolsover, and the acquisitions Newcastle had made since making his will in 1707. Henrietta had succeeded in increasing her share, but Newcastle had succeeded in keeping the majority of his possessions together which went, with the Yorkshire parliamentary boroughs, to Pelham.<br>
