<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Greenwood,  James William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1835, <em>d.</em> 1927), <span class="occ">author and journalist</span>, was born in Lambeth, Surrey, where he was baptized on 15 November 1835, the second son in the family of eleven children of James Caer Greenwood, coach trimmer, and his wife, Mary Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fish, of Park Street, Lambeth. His year of birth is not known for certain; in census returns and elsewhere his age was variously recorded, pointing to a birth year between 1830 and 1835. He married, at Southwark, on 21 December 1851 (when he gave his age as twenty-one), Eliza Hayson (1824&#150;1917), a dressmaker, daughter of William Hayson, mason. They had at least three sons and five daughters.<br>
<br>Greenwood is known to have been apprenticed as a compositor, and was employed as an engraver. Following his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33544/', "Frederick Greenwood")</script>, he took up writing as his occupation. Together they wrote a novel, <span class="italic">Under a Cloud</span>, first published serially in the <span class="italic">Welcome Guest</span> and in 1860 as a separate volume. Thereafter he established himself as a successful children's author. His adventure book for boys, <span class="italic">Wild Sports of the World</span> (1862), with accounts of big game and biographies of hunters, was published by Samuel Beeton, who went on to publish at least four more of Greenwood's books, first in serial form and later as novels. &#145;King Lion&#146;, a story that appeared anonymously in Beeton's <span class="italic">Boy's Own Magazine</span> in 1864, but was later attributed to Greenwood, was credited as an influence by Kipling. He worked with a succession of publishers and produced more than thirty children's novels until about 1890. His stories were often illustrated by Ernest Griset, an artist born in France but known as &#145;the English Dor&eacute;&#146;, who specialized in depictions of animals.<br>
<br>Through his elder brother, who became editor of the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, Greenwood established a reputation as an early investigative journalist. He had begun to explore the potential of London's rough street life in children's stories, such as &#145;The True History of a Little Ragamuffin&#146;, which originally appeared in the <span class="italic">Englishwoman's Magazine</span> and was later (1866) published as a book, and in contributions to the <span class="italic">Penny Illustrated Paper</span>. Late in 1865 Frederick commissioned him to spend a night in the casual ward of a London workhouse. He was allegedly reluctant, but agreed to the work when offered a fee of &pound;30 or &pound;40 in advance, and further payment if the resulting articles made a significant impact on the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>'s circulation. Accompanied by a friend named Bittlestone, a stockbroker, he entered Lambeth workhouse for a night in January 1866, both men having adopted clothing appropriate to occupants of the casual ward, which housed vagrants seeking overnight shelter. They remained in the workhouse for fourteen hours and emerged the following morning to be collected by Frederick's carriage. Their observations were conflated (to give the impression that Greenwood had entered the workhouse alone) and were allegedly toned down by Frederick &#145;to avoid suspicion of exaggeration&#146;  (Robertson Scott, 167) before being published in three successive issues of the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> (12, 13, 15 Jan 1866), under the title &#145;A night in a workhouse&#146;. The articles were published anonymously, and the author was styled &#145;the amateur casual&#146;. Greenwood's revelations of squalor, neglect, and degradation, and maladministration by the workhouse authorities, together with the shock of his and his companion's personal experiences (submerged in the filthy bathwater and sharing a bed with paupers), caused a sensation. A later reading has also drawn attention to the homoerotic undercurrents of the casual ward, which Greenwood brought to light, and which scandalized contemporary opinion  (Koven, 25&#150;87). Circulation of the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> increased significantly, the articles were reprinted in full in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, and they were issued later in the year as a pamphlet.<br>
<br>Greenwood both wrote and lectured as the Amateur Casual for the next thirty years, producing further observations of the poor districts of London, disguised as a tramp. <span class="italic">Unsentimental Journeys, or, Byways of Modern Babylon</span> (1867) was one of a series of works in which he presented observations of the poor as travellers' tales. His <span class="italic">Seven Curses of London</span> of 1869 attempted to summarize the problems facing the city: &#145;neglected children&#146;; &#145;professional thieves&#146;; &#145;professional beggars&#146;; &#145;fallen women&#146;; &#145;the curse of drunkenness&#146;; &#145;betting gamblers&#146;; and &#145;waste of charity&#146;. His passion for his subject and his fascination with a quirky story were combined with an outlook that attempted to distinguish between the deserving and undeserving poor. He proposed emigration to the colonies as a remedy for pauperism. A later work, <span class="italic">Odd People in Odd Places</span> (1883), offered pen portraits of the &#145;homes, haunts, and habits of some of the lower grade of the great community&#146; of London  (preface).<br>
<br>Greenwood left the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> to write for the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, where he published four articles, in December 1871, resulting from a commission by the Liberal MP Michael Thomas Bass to investigate working conditions on Britain's railways. His revelations of long working hours contributed to the establishment of the first railway workers' trade union, and led to Greenwood's becoming editor of a new journal, the <span class="italic">Railway Service Gazette</span>, which first appeared in February 1872. He was later editor of the short-lived <span class="italic">King's Cross Journal</span> of 1880. Writing under his second pseudonym, One of the Crowd, he produced for the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> another expos&eacute;, claiming in 1874 to have attended a fight in which a man was pitted against a dog. The engagement was alleged to have taken place in Hanley in Staffordshire. The account aroused public anger and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (among others) attempted to trace the organizers of the fight. Greenwood could not subsequently locate the venue, the human participant in the fight, or any other member of the audience and so could never vindicate his account; he was said to have earned the enmity of the inhabitants of north Staffordshire for his slur on life in the Potteries. A self-styled activist against social abuses, he is known to have become involved in philanthropy during the mid-1890s, establishing two funds for children, to provide outings to the countryside and to supply Christmas hampers. His last books, published in 1902 and 1905, were concerned with his experiences as an observer in the London police courts and his interviews with the inmates of lunatic asylums.<br>
<br>Known to his friends and colleagues as Jimmy or Bill, Greenwood was on friendly terms with his fellow journalists, and was said to have been acquainted with Dickens; yet despite the success of his workhouse articles he never enjoyed a cordial relationship with his brother Frederick, who never forgave him for leaving the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>. There were apparently differences of character between them. Frederick was described by a niece as a man of strong principles, in contrast to James for whom &#145;principles were not one of his strong points&#146;  (Robertson Scott, 171). His investigative journalism rests on the pioneering technique (albeit one initially forced upon him) of temporarily adopting the dress and circumstances of others. He has been described as &#145;the most celebrated exponent of mid-Victorian complete participation&#146; in the experience of the poor  (Freeman, 104). Mayhew, Dickens, and others may have interviewed the poor, but Greenwood became &#145;one of the crowd&#146; and so provided a model for successors like Jack London, Mary Higgs, and George Orwell.<br>
<br>Greenwood&#151;5 feet 6 inches tall, with black curly hair&#151;was described as &#145;a short, squarish, good-humoured man, dressed in a long black frock-coat, and black tie&#151;the cut of a slum missionary&#146;  (Robertson Scott, 169). His later years were spent in obscurity and evident poverty. He was living with his daughter at Lee, London, at the time of his death, at 390 High Street, Catford, London, on 11 August 1927, and was described in his death certificate as an &#145;old age pensioner&#146;, aged ninety-six.<br>
