<span class="headword">Vicars,  Thomas</span>  (1589&#150;1638), <span class="occ">theologian</span>, was born and baptized in Carlisle, the eldest of the twelve children of William and Eve Vicars, and tells us he attended the school there. He matriculated from Queen's College, Oxford, on 19 June 1607; he graduated BA on 16 December 1611 and MA on 17 June 1615. He was elected chaplain on 7 July 1615 and fellow on 20 April 1616, and on 10 May 1622 was licensed to preach, receiving at the same time the degree of BD. In that year he married Anne, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19940/', "Sir Henry Neville")</script> and stepdaughter of a Carlisle man, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4671/', "George Carleton (1557/8&#150;1628)")</script>, bishop of Llandaff, who on his translation to Chichester, also in 1622, presented Vicars to the vicarages of Cowfold and Cuckfield in Sussex. Carleton employed Vicars as his chaplain and in 1624 made him a prebendary of Chichester Cathedral. Vicars appears to have resided at Cuckfield, where the parish register records the baptism of five of his children; of these the only son, George, and the eldest girl, Anna (baptized on 26 July 1624), died before their first birthday.<br>
<br>In 1620 Vicars issued a translation from the Latin of Bartholomew Keckermann entitled <span class="italic">A Manuduction to Theologie</span>. The work was dedicated to the service and good of the church, to Lady Anne Neville (perhaps his wife's mother), and to &#145;The Lady Anne Fetiplace of Chilrey&#146;, Berkshire. In it he aimed &#145;to further the simplest of my countrymens growth in all godliness&#146;  (Fincham, 196). In 1624 he published <span class="italic">Astrologomania: the Madness of Astrologers</span>, addressed to his cousin Thomas Carleton of Carleton Hall in Cumberland, JP. The preface made clear his disbelief, &#145;whether it be a more artificial delusion, which satan worketh in the learned and great clerks of the world, or a more simple and gross kind of insinuation which he practiseth on the ruder and unlettered people&#146;, and cited a personal reason: during his school days at Carlisle, a &#145;cunning man&#146; or &#145;wizard&#146; visited the Vicars household while Thomas was entertaining a young schoolfriend. Having been persuaded to tell the fortunes of the two boys, he predicted that Thomas would become a scrivener and the other would be a preacher. &#145;Now it fell out, that my school fellow proved the scrivener, and I prove the preacher.&#146; In the third edition of his education manual, <span class="italic"><i>Cheirag&#333;gia</i>: manuductio ad artem rhetoricam</span> (1628, first published 1621), Vicars made an early, punning reference to Shakespeare&#151;&#145;that famous poet who takes his name from &#147;shaking&#148; and &#147;spear&#148;&#146;&#151;which indicates that the dramatist and poet was regarded by some school and university students as an important vernacular writer from the late 1620s. Vicars was buried at Cuckfield church on 29 August 1638.<br>
