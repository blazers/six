<span class="headword">Bird,  Ruth</span>  (1899&#150;1987), <span class="occ">historian and schoolteacher</span>, was born on 26 May 1899 at 62 St Quintin Avenue, Kensington, London, the second of the two children of George Bird (1863&#150;1912), entrepreneur and engineer, and his wife, Theresa Mary (1867&#150;1953), daughter of Thomas Edwards, chemist, and his wife, Hannah. The Bird family had been wealthy London merchants during the nineteenth century, but the early death of Ruth's father in 1912 proved detrimental to his family's finances. Ruth's brother, Harold (1896&#150;1962), was educated at Charterhouse School and from 1909 until 1917 Ruth boarded at Elstree Grange in Eastbourne, where her academic ability was recognized in her outstanding success in public examinations.<br>
<br>Ruth Bird studied at Bedford College, London, from 1917 to 1922. In 1920 she was the only historian awarded first-class honours in the BA examinations. In May 1921 she received the inaugural grant of the Amy Lady Tate scholarship, which covered tuition fees and use of the newly opened Institute of Historical Research, while she studied at Bedford College under the direction of J. W. Allen and Miss Jeffries Davis. Her master's degree, awarded in December 1922, was the ninth history MA in the college's history, but the first distinction.<br>
<br>Ruth Bird started teaching at Truro Girls' High School in 1923. In 1926 she moved to the Wyggeston Grammar School for Girls in Leicester where she remained until she retired in 1959, having been senior mistress. She obtained no specific teaching qualifications, but loved her chosen career, and was an inspirational and enthusiastic classroom teacher. Her former pupil Professor Claire Cross described her as &#145;perhaps the greatest (teacher) I ever met&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>A small, slight figure, with a short severe hair cut, Ruth Bird possessed great natural authority and a remarkably warm smile. She dressed simply, lived humbly, and owned little. Ruth's membership of the Anglican third order of Franciscans and her commitment to its principles of humility and simplicity explain her exceptionally austere and frugal lifestyle, rather than lack of funds. She was initially linked with the order at Burnham Priory at Taplow and later with the convent at Lingfield. Her vicar at Horsted Keynes knew Ruth as a dedicated &#145;practising Christian, devout and faithful in her prayer life, in worship and private study&#146;  (private information) and although her beliefs were private and she was no evangelist she saw no separation between secular and spiritual worlds. Her faith was evident.<br>
<br>Although she was a keen traveller and a teacher who emphasized the international perspective to history as a means of furthering peace among nations, Ruth Bird's own scholarly studies were consistently local. Her main publication, <span class="italic">The Turbulent London of Richard II</span> (1949), was a revision of her master's thesis, &#145;Civic factions in London and their relation to political parties, 1376&#150;1399&#146;, which she prepared for publication during a year's refresher in 1935&#150;6 at the London School of Economics. Her thorough research enabled her to analyse the intricacies of the shifting alliances between the city's guilds, thus revealing deep political and personal complexities, which have precluded any subsequent simplistic assessment of the situation.<br>
<br>While in Leicester Bird co-wrote entries on the villages of Humberstone and Knighton for the Leicestershire <span class="roman">Victoria county history</span> (1958). On her retirement to Sussex in 1963 she immersed herself in the local history of Horsted Keynes, where she co-wrote a history of the village, and edited two volumes of &#145;day books&#146; kept by Giles More, a seventeenth-century incumbent of the parish church of St Giles. The second part of <span class="italic">The Journal of Giles More</span> appeared as volume 68 of the Sussex Record Society in 1971. At the time of her death Ruth Bird was co-writing a history of the local Horsted Keynes school, a seventeenth-century charitable foundation by Archbishop Robert Leighton.<br>
<br>Ruth Bird's health was undermined in her later years by a weak chest, though she remained mentally alert. She died in hospital in Haywards Heath on 24 January 1987 aged eighty-seven, and her ashes were buried in Horsted Keynes churchyard on 31 January 1987.<br>
