<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Devereux,  Walter</span>, first earl of Essex  (1539&#150;1576), <span class="occ">nobleman and adventurer</span>, was born on 16 September 1539 at Chartley, Staffordshire, the eldest son of Sir Richard Devereux and his wife, Dorothy, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12570/', "George Hastings, first earl of Huntingdon")</script>. Sir Richard, who was created a knight of the Order of the Garter on 20 February 1548, died the same year, in the lifetime of his father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7567/', "Walter Devereux, first Viscount Hereford")</script>. The family was descended from Robert d'Evreux, a companion of William the Conqueror who settled in Herefordshire. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50222/', "Walter Devereux, first Baron Ferrers of Chartley")</script>, met his death fighting for Richard III at Bosworth. His son John succeeded as Lord Ferrers, and married Cecily, sister of Henry Bourchier, earl of Essex. The offspring of this marriage, Walter, created Viscount Hereford in 1550, was, on his death in 1558, succeeded by his grandson Walter. Biographical verses written on the life of this Walter Devereux and an elegy on his death collected by J. Payne Collier indicate that he spent his youth on the large family estates at Lamphey in Pembrokeshire.<h2>
<a name="Loyaltyduringtherisingofthenorthernearls"></a>Loyalty during the rising of the northern earls</h2>On Elizabeth I's accession Walter, Lord Hereford, went up to court, and about 1561 married Lettice (1543&#150;1634) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8159/', "Dudley, Lettice")</script>], eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15755/', "Sir Francis Knollys")</script>; both were in their early twenties. For the next seven years they lived at Chartley Hall in Staffordshire. It was during this period that their eldest child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23490/', "Penelope Rich")</script>, was born. His first call to public service came in 1568 when ordered to keep a body of horse in readiness to prevent any attempt to release Mary, queen of Scots, from Tutbury, then under the charge of the earl of Shrewsbury. John Leslie, the Scottish queen's envoy and historian of Scotland, spread rumours about the young Lord Hereford to poison Queen Elizabeth's mind against him, in particular that Hereford had slandered Leicester, her favourite. Later events would divide Leicester and Hereford but at this time, on 29 September 1569, Hereford protested to William Cecil that he bore no grudge against Leicester. From his letter to the queen on 27 November 1569 it is clear that Hereford had raised troops to aid the suppression of the northern uprising under the earls of Northumberland and Westmorland, and joined the earl of Warwick's army at Leicester where he was appointed &#145;high marshal of the field&#146;. He was commended for his decisive part in the suppression of the rising. In 1571 he succeeded his cousin Anne Parr, marchioness of Northampton, as Lord Bourchier. On St George's day (23 April) 1572 Hereford was made a knight of the Garter, and on 4 May was created earl of Essex, his Bourchier great-granduncle's title. Such rewards were indicative of his steady and efficient loyalty to the queen and to the reformed religion.<h2>
<a name="TheUlsterbackgroundtoEssexsIrishcareer"></a>The Ulster background to Essex's Irish career</h2>In 1573 Essex undertook as a partial adventurer to colonize Ulster, then the <i>ultima</i> <i>Thule</i> of Gaeldom, a province known to statesmen as &#145;the gall and misery of all evil men in Ireland&#146;  (Essex to Burghley, 23 June 1574). Previous efforts to settle Ulster had failed. Turlough Luineach O'Neill then held sway over what is now co. Tyrone, the senior O'Neill Gaelic lordship, and in south Derry and north Armagh. He also occasionally controlled the influential vassal chief (<i>uriath</i>) Turlough mac Henry O'Neill of the Fews in south Armagh, and was sometimes in alliance with Sir Brian mac Phelim O'Neill, ruler of Clandeboye (most of south Antrim). The O'Neills also had formidable support from the mercenaries of Sorley Boy MacDonnell, the brother of James McDonnell, lord of north Antrim, of Rathlin Island, and of Kintyre and the isles in Scotland.<br>
<br>Confident of success in Ireland, Essex hoped to further his credibility at court and to move to centre stage in political life. By formal agreement with Queen Elizabeth in July 1573 he was to take over Clandeboye, the present co. Antrim, save for the fortress of Carrickfergus and its hinterland. When secured, the territory was to be free of tax for seven years and enjoy free trade with England and all manorial rights, but not to benefit from fines of the crown courts. An army of 1200 men was to be raised jointly by Essex and the queen, and costs of fortifications were to be shared equally between them: &#145;the Earl shall fortify as occasion shall require before division at the equal charges of her Majesty and the Earl&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calendar of the Carew Manuscripts</span>, 1.444). Elizabeth loaned Essex &pound;10,000 on mortgage of his properties in Buckinghamshire and Essex. If the sum was not repaid within three years these pledged properties&#151;about a third of all his property&#151;would be forfeited. In sanguine mood Essex reckoned that his Ulster plantation would yield an annual rental of &pound;5000 which would offset any outlay the crown was prepared to make in its support. In 1572 similar arrangements had been granted to Thomas Smith, the natural son of Sir Thomas Smith, to colonize the Ards peninsula between Belfast and Strangford Lough in co. Down. That project had been a failure, but Essex's new scheme was heartily supported. Lord Rich, Sir Peter Carew, William and John Norris of Rycot, William Morgan, Francis Kellaway, Sir Arthur Champernowne, Henry Knollys (Essex's brother-in-law), Michael and John Carey, the sons of Lord Hunsdon, and Henry Sydenham all raised volunteer bands. Essex wanted each adventurer to &#145;build a small castle with a bawn of stone and intrench a town&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 48015, fols. 296&#150;300). He prudently employed officers who had previous Irish experience such as Nicholas and John Malby, Edward Barkeley, Thomas Chatterton, and Francis Drake, captain of the <i>Falcon</i>. Early in July 1573 the queen advised him to avoid bloodshed as far as possible and not to make any hasty enforced changes in religion.<br>
<br>Essex sailed from Liverpool in good spirits with part of his expedition on 19 July 1573. The small fleet was soon storm-scattered; some ships were blown on to the Isle of Man and others as far south as Cork. Essex landed with difficulty at Carrickfergus where he took command of the garrison and where Hugh O'Neill (later second earl of Tyrone) joined his force. He wintered at Belfast where an earthen fort at Skegoneill, near the present city, is associated with Essex. Thence he issued a proclamation to Turlough Luineach O'Neill to the effect that his sole aim was to rid Ulster of the Scots and that all who helped him to do so would be well received. Sir Brian mac Phelim O'Neill initially made feint submission by sending in supplies of cattle to Carrickfergus, but a few days later withdrew his forces to join Turlough Luineach O'Neill's, and at the same time managed to recover his cattle from Essex. The problem for Essex was to prevent the O'Neills, Turlough and Brian, acting together with their Scottish allies and mercenaries; rather his aim was to have them at each other's throats. One fierce attack was made on Sir Brian MacPhelim at Masereene, near Antrim town, but simultaneously a raid by the Scots on the Ards resulted on 18 October 1573 in the death of Thomas Smith, on whom Essex had relied for support. Essex's difficulties increased as his men began to desert, some to England and some to the pale; he lacked a steady stream of supplies and to compound his ill luck the plague broke out&#151;twin factors which accounted for the failure of many Elizabethan colonial ventures. Some of his volunteers openly declared their intention of going home so that Essex was left to depend on the support of drafted men, and was forced to plead for further financial aid from the queen who loaned him additional money against further mortgages. &#145;I will not leave this enterprize as long as I have any foot of land in England unsold&#146;, he wrote to the council in March 1574  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/45/7). Contrary to his original plans, Essex now suggested winning the support of Sorley Boy and his Scots to use against the O'Neills.<h2>
<a name="DifficultieswithFitzwilliamthelorddeputy"></a>Difficulties with Fitzwilliam, the lord deputy</h2>The lord deputy, William Fitzwilliam, who had been against the project from the beginning, now declined to help Essex, who promptly sent his secretary, Edward Waterhouse, to report his situation to queen and council. Orders were sent directly to Fitzwilliam to succour Essex in Ulster. A proposal to recall Fitzwilliam and have him replaced by Essex was aborted by the intervention of Leicester, to whom the queen listened. Instead, to satisfy Essex, he was promised the titles of governor of Ulster and earl marshal of Ireland. Early in March 1574 he appealed to Fitzwilliam for help in an excursion against Turlough Luineach O'Neill; he got but a handful of men from the pale. Again, desertions and want of supplies stopped the attempt; instead a truce was negotiated with Turlough before the end of the month.<br>
<br>The whole enterprise was manifestly failing, and the queen contemplated recalling Essex out of Ireland. Essex foresaw the ruin of his fortunes unless the terms of his contracts could be altered. He first asked the queen for another 700 men while he continued to support 100 himself, and asked her to grant him Island Magee at a nominal rent; alternatively he asked her to take &pound;250 a year in discharge of the &pound;10,000 debt. Elizabeth graciously acceded to his first request. These reinforcements arrived but once more disease, desertions, and famine became rampant in Carrickfergus; old and new soldiers were dying at the rate of fifteen or twenty a day. With heroic fortitude Essex shared in their sufferings and although his forces were weakened they did manage to persuade Sir Brian mac Phelim O'Neill to consider surrendering his territory of Clandeboye to the queen in May 1574. In June 1574, at Fitzwilliam's request, Essex moved south to ask the earl of Desmond to negotiate with the deputy and council in Dublin. In this he was temporarily successful. On his return north Essex mustered what soldiers he could, and with the help of Hugh O'Neill, baron of Dungannon (and second earl of Tyrone <i>de jure</i>, 1562), carried out a murderous raid on a Clandeboye O'Neill crannog (a fortified island in a lake) near Banbridge, co. Down. From there he marched through Turlough Luineach O'Neill's lordship from Benburb in co. Tyrone to the River Foyle, burning a bountiful harvest as he went. At Lifford in Tyrconnell he placed a loyalist O'Donnell in charge instead of a dissident one.<br>
<br>However, this show of strength failed to bring Turlough Luineach to submission. The trail of damage was quickly repaired since in a pastoral economy no towns and few substantial houses existed. Essex could see that only permanent forts garrisoned by paid government troops could effectively bring the province under English control. He also would have liked coastal fortifications to keep the Scots out of Ulster. His frustration at his perceived lack of progress in carrying out his project drove him to desperate measures. In November 1574 he invited MacPhelim to conference and to spend Christmas with him at Belfast, at that time but a cluster of houses around a church and small fort at a ford on the Lagan River. A rich banquet was prepared for the Irish chief, his wife, his brother, and their retainers. At a signal his troops treacherously slaughtered Sir Brian's company, seized the three chief guests, and had them sent to Dublin Castle and there executed, presumably for treachery. Essex boasted that this little execution broke the faction and struck terror into the rest. No justification was given for the atrocity.<h2>
<a name="ContinuedtroublesbetweenEssexandFitzwilliam"></a>Continued troubles between Essex and Fitzwilliam</h2>Differences and difficulties with the Dublin administration led to confusion of authority as Essex and Fitzwilliam were frequently at cross purposes. Fitzwilliam regarded Essex and his prospective colonists with suspicion. The Irish enemy made capital on the confusion by claiming they were &#145;no rebels&#146;, but acting in self-defence against predators; that if indeed it was the queen's war, then the lord deputy and not Essex would have been appointed to lead it. When Fitzwilliam had to reduce the forces in Ireland to about 2000 soldiers, Essex's army was threatened with extinction. Hence he resigned. The queen praised his earlier efforts and declared that the enterprise was not to be abandoned. And yet she informed Essex that she was not prepared to continue support for the colonization of Ulster. By June 1575, as part of his evacuation plans, he moved his headquarters from Carrickfergus to Drogheda and there opened negotiations with Turlough Luineach O'Neill. The queen now ordered Essex to retire as soon as he could. By the end of June 1575 he threw up a fort and bridge across the Blackwater, north of Armagh, but in his haste that work was unfinished because his men were continually harassed by followers of Sorley Boy MacDonnell and Turlough Luineach O'Neill. However, he came to terms with Turlough Luineach, who undertook to confine himself to his Tyrone lands and to relinquish claims over his neighbours. Essex then drove the Scots under Sorley Boy out of Clandeboye and handed it over to a minor Irish chieftain, Brian Fertagh O'Neill.<h2>
<a name="TheRathlinIslandmassacre"></a>The Rathlin Island massacre</h2>An essay in frightfulness followed when Essex sent a naval expedition under John Norris and Francis Drake to Rathlin Island where Sorley Boy had sent his own family and those of his chief followers for safety. Robert Bruce's former castle on the island was stormed and 200 defenders killed in a siege that lasted four days (22&#150;6 July 1575). No quarter was given, and some 300 to possibly 400 people, including women and children, were hunted down and slaughtered in the caves where they had taken refuge. Rathlin proved easy to sack but difficult to hold, being a staging post on the way to and from the south Hebrides. Drake and Norris were forced to abandon the island under pressure from Sorley Boy who in retaliation sacked Carrickfergus.<br>
<br>The massacre of Rathlin Island was the last act in Essex's Ulster tragedy. The whole venture had been a costly failure, the queen having spent over &pound;130,000 in Ireland in the two and a half years to September 1575. In November 1575, once Sir Henry Sidney had returned to Ireland as lord deputy to replace Fitzwilliam, he visited Ulster and found it &#145;utterly disinhabited&#146;. Modern research would seem to confirm Froude's description of the massacre on Rathlin Island, some aspects of which were questioned by Brewer in letters to <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> in 1870, particularly that Sorley Boy had witnessed the murder of his children from the mainland, and that Essex and the queen regarded the operation with satisfaction. Contemporary reports would appear to support Froude's views rather than Brewer's. The massacre is long remembered in the catalogue of English outrages and Irish grievances as recorded by the Gaelic annalists. Little had been achieved by Essex in Ulster. At best Turlough Luineach O'Neill was restrained from exercising authority over his neighbours and from bringing in undue forces of Scottish mercenaries, but fears of Scots-Irish intrigues continued until the execution of Mary, queen of Scots, in 1587.<h2>
<a name="Essexsfinalyears"></a>Essex's final years</h2>In October 1575 Essex arrived at his house in Lamphey, Pembrokeshire. The queen had eased his anxieties by writing on 2 September:<blockquote>You may think it has been a dear conquest to you, in respect of the great care of mind, toil of body, and intolerable charges you have sustained to the consumption of some good portion of your patrimony, but you have invested yourself with immortal renown. (<span class="italic">Calendar of the Carew Manuscripts</span>, 2.24)</blockquote>By 29 December 1575 he was at Durham House in London petitioning for compensation from the privy council for the loss of his fortune in Ireland and to pay off his creditors. Negotiations dragged as offers were made and rejected by Essex, and Lord Burghley became irritable. At length, on 9 March 1576 the queen signed a warrant reappointing Essex &#145;earl marshal of Ireland&#146; and on 9 May confirmed the grant of the Farney in co. Monaghan, about one-fifth of that shire. He then defrayed debts amounting to about &pound;35,473 by selling off land in Staffordshire, Cornwall, Essex, Wiltshire, and Yorkshire. He left Chartley Hall, Staffordshire, in mid-July 1576 and arrived in Dublin on the 23rd where, in the absence of Sir Henry Sidney, he was welcomed by the chancellor, William Gerard, and by Adam Loftus, the archbishop of Dublin. After visiting his lands in Monaghan, Sidney invested him in the office of earl marshal of Ireland.<br>
<br>By September Essex was ill with dysentery. On 20 September he wrote to the queen that he was on his deathbed and begged her to favour his elder son, Robert. He died in Dublin on 22 September 1576, aged thirty-seven, and was buried in Carmarthen on 26 November. In his will, drawn up on 14 June 1575, Essex left moneys to be expended on fortifying the pale at the discretion of the lord deputy. A funeral sermon (published in London in 1577) was preached by Richard Davies, bishop of St David's, and an epitaph was entered in the Stationers' Company register in 1575/6 which is identical with &#145;The Death of Devoreux&#146; printed by J. Payne Collier from a manuscript in his possession in his <span class="italic">Extracts from the Stationers' Company Registers</span>. Thomas Churchyard published an elegy in his <span class="italic">Generall Rehearsall of Warres</span> (1579), which may in fact have been issued separately at the time of the earl's death.<h2>
<a name="Controversyoncauseofdeath"></a>Controversy on cause of death</h2>A rumour that the earl had been poisoned proved groundless, as attested by the post-mortem examination ordered by Sir Henry Sidney. Sidney's report to Walsingham gives a detailed description of Essex's last days, and likewise his secretary, Edward Waterhouse, wrote a sad account, printed in William Camden's <span class="italic">Annales</span> (as edited by Thomas Hearne, 1717). A manuscript copy of the latter, erroneously attributed to Thomas Churchyard's hand and once belonging to William Cole, the Cambridge antiquary, is now in the British Library (BL, Add. MS 5845, fols. 337&#150;49). <span class="italic">Leicester's Commonwealth</span>, an attack on Leicester's character written in 1584, wrongly ascribes to Robert Parsons the allegation that Leicester was responsible for Essex's death, motivated, as he may well have been, by his adulterous relations with Essex's wife. A contemporary ballad, &#145;Leicester's Ghost&#146;, repeats the story, but it was not published until 1641. Certainly Lady Essex did not accompany her husband to Ireland. In 1575 she was at Kenilworth when Leicester entertained the queen there, and on 6 August the countess of Essex received the queen at Chartley Hall in the absence of the earl. We know that Leicester was anxious in March 1576 to have Essex return to Ireland, and there is no proof that the countess intrigued with Leicester in her husband's lifetime. She married Leicester on 21 September 1578. By her second marriage she had a son who died in 1584. After Leicester's death (4 September 1588) she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2685/', "Sir Christopher Blount")</script> in July 1589. He was executed in 1601 for his part in the treason plot of her son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7565/', "Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex")</script>, and she lived a widow until her death at the age of ninety-four on 25 December 1634. She was buried at the side of her second husband at Warwick.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>All who knew Essex, and especially those who served with him in Ulster, testify to his exceptional courage in sharing all the hardships of the campaign to which his men were subjected. But his Ulster enterprise was ill-conceived and incompetently executed, and its inexorable failure was due as much to his lack of judgement as to the vacillating policy of the queen and the rivalry of William Fitzwilliam. The wanton atrocities committed on the O'Neills and the Scots on Rathlin Island precipitated a further deterioration in Anglo-Gaelic relations.<br>
<br>Richard Davies, the preacher of his funeral panegyric, said that Essex was learned in history and genealogy and heraldry. According to Waterhouse, Essex's secretary, he sang a hymn of his own composition on his deathbed. A poem attributed to Essex exists in two copies in the British Library, and another in the Bodleian. These verses are printed as &#145;The Compleynt of a Sinner&#146; in <span class="italic">The Paradise of Dainty Devices</span> (1576) above the initials F. K. (Francis Kinwelmersh, friend of the Elizabethan writer and poet George Gascoigne).<br>
