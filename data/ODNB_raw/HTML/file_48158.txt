<span class="headword">Ruston,  Joseph</span>  (1835&#150;1897), <span class="occ">engineer and manufacturer</span>, was born in February 1835 at Chatteris, Cambridgeshire, son of Robert Ruston (<i>d</i>. 1850/51), farmer. He was educated at Wesley College, Sheffield, and was apprenticed in the cutlery firm of Wolstenholme &amp; Son. Opportunities for advancement in this old-established firm were limited, so he sought a partnership elsewhere, having some capital inherited from his father, who had died when Joseph was fifteen.<br>
<br>On 1 January 1857 Ruston entered the partnership of Burton and Proctor at Lincoln. This firm, subsequently styled Ruston, Burton, and Proctor, was a small business of millwrights and general smiths. They made and repaired various types of machinery, including ploughs, threshing machines, and a few steam engines. Ruston brought energy, enthusiasm, and new business acumen to the firm. He persuaded his partners to make a more vigorous entry into the market for portable steam engines by building for stock. The first machines were well received at shows, and Ruston was keen to increase production. The pace of change was too great for Burton, who sold his share to Ruston in July 1857 for &pound;8000. In 1864 Proctor retired, and Ruston became sole proprietor of Ruston, Proctor &amp; Co. (and the firm retained that name until 1918).<br>
<br>Joseph Ruston toured widely across Europe, and as far afield as Russia, to win business. He had a readiness to seize market opportunities and to innovate. As a result, while steam engines, threshing machines, and grinding mills remained principal products during the nineteenth century, there was early diversification into pumping and irrigation equipment for overseas, and into railway locomotives and pit winding engines. By the end of the century the firm had joined the leading manufacturers of gas and oil engines. The acquisition of the rights to manufacture mechanical excavators, known as steam navvies, led to a profitable development of the business. Their successful use in the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal established the reputation of these machines. The firm was turned into a limited liability company in 1889, with a capital of &pound;500,000. Ruston served as chairman of the company until his death; but he also had other business activities, including the chairmanship of Joseph Rogers &amp; Son Ltd, cutlers in Sheffield, and of the Lincolnshire Publishing Company Ltd, newspaper publishers.<br>
<br>Elected to Lincoln city council in November 1865, Ruston represented the lower ward until 1874, when he was made an alderman. In 1869 he was appointed chief magistrate for the city, and he was a justice of the peace for the city from 1871 and for Lindsey from 1885. He was mayor of the city of Lincoln for the year 1869&#150;70. He was appointed deputy lieutenant for Lincolnshire in 1889, and was high sheriff of Lincolnshire for 1891, in which year he was also made a freeman of the city, the first to be accorded such an honour. Ruston entered national politics in 1884, being returned as Liberal MP for Lincoln at a by-election. He was elected again at the general election the following year. However, he parted company with the Liberal Party over home rule for Ireland, voted against Gladstone's bill of 1886, and declined to stand at the election called that year.<br>
<br>Ruston married Jane, daughter of Mr W. Brown of Sheffield, in 1859. The couple had two sons and six daughters. In 1873 Ruston bought Monks Manor, Lincoln, where he housed an extensive collection of art. A member of Newland Congregational Chapel, Ruston was a deacon of the church from 1865 onwards. He was a supporter of the church's mission work, and he made financial contributions for mission chapels at South Bar and Croft Street, Lincoln, and for the Newland chapel's new building. Other charitable work included involvement with the Lincoln branch of the YMCA&#151;he served as president and contributed to a new gymnasium. He was president of the Lincoln committee of the NSPCC. In 1892 he paid for a new children's ward at the city hospital. He provided a drill hall for the Lincoln Volunteers in 1890, and underwrote the restoration of Queen Eleanor's tomb in the cathedral. He was involved in educational development in Lincoln through his position on the city council. He encouraged the development of the city's grammar school, and supported the extension fund for elementary schools. He served as chairman of the Lincolnshire Agricultural Society in 1892.<br>
<br>Joseph Ruston's spirit of enterprise became legendary in the late nineteenth-century engineering world. When he first became a partner in the firm in 1857 the business employed twenty-five men. At his death it employed more than 2500 people, and there was a branch in Budapest and agencies throughout the world. Ruston died of heart disease on 10 June 1897 at Monks Manor, Lincoln, survived by his wife. He was buried at Eastgate cemetery, Lincoln. One of his sons, Joseph Seward Ruston, was chairman of the engineering company from 1901 to 1939.<br>
