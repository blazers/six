</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Chirol, Sir  (Mary) Valentine Ignatius</span>  (1852&#150;1929), <span class="occ">journalist and author</span>, was born on 23 May 1852, the younger son of the Revd Alexander Chirol (1816&#150;1875?), and Harriet Ashburnham (1824&#150;1908), daughter of the Revd Denny Ashburnham of Catsfield, Sussex. The Chirols were Huguenots, who emigrated to England from Switzerland during the upheaval of the French Revolution. Alexander, ordained in the Church of England in 1841, was soon caught up in the Tractarian movement, and in 1847 he, along with his new wife and his mother, was received into the Roman Catholic church. Valentine Chirol was born in Europe and shortly afterwards his father, repenting his doctrinal switch, returned to England and to the Anglican church. Young Chirol and his mother, a devout Catholic until her death, stayed in Europe, where he was raised in her faith and as an only child; although of French descent and brought up in France and Germany, Chirol was a staunch English patriot, proud of his Anglo-Saxon Ashburnham blood.<br>
<br>Chirol took his <i>baccalaur&eacute;at</i> at the Sorbonne in 1869, which entitled him to style himself a <i>bachelier &egrave;s lettres</i>. He continued his studies in Germany until the Franco-Prussian War made it prudent for mother and son to resettle in England. Although he kept terms at Lincoln's Inn from 1890 to 1892, Chirol did not choose a career at the bar. Trilingual as a boy, he spoke nine languages by the time he was in his mid-thirties. According to Chirol, his mind and character&#151;including an ability to dream in French and German as well as English&#151;were formed by his foreign upbringing and education. The direction his life took he credited to two dramatic events witnessed at first hand: the first was the entrance of Prussian troops into Paris in 1871; the second the destructive excesses of the Paris commune. Stirred deeply, Chirol pledged himself to &#145;the study and writing of history as we see it in our own times constantly in the making, whether shaped by new aspirations or by ancient forces&#146;  (Chirol, 20).<br>
<br>Chirol's linguistic skills helped him to find a place at the Foreign Office, which he left after a stay of only four years. His abrupt departure was probably occasioned by a combination of youthful impatience with the slow pace and tedious routine of his post, and a taste for travel and exotic adventure, although financial embarrassment might also have contributed  (L. S. Amery, <span class="italic">My Political Life</span>, 1953, 1.93). During his employment at the Foreign Office, Chirol learned how diplomacy worked and gained an insight into foreign affairs in general. He made some close friends and acquired the habit, never really lost, of thinking of himself as a diplomat. Freed from Foreign Office routine, he immersed himself in the history and culture of the Near East, which had intrigued him on a brief earlier visit. He went first to Cairo, then hardly touched by Western influences and sinking rapidly into the chaos that would result in British occupation. In 1879 Chirol was in Syria and Lebanon, and by 1880 Constantinople, where he learned the trade of journalism, working for the <span class="italic">Levant Herald</span>. His first book, <span class="italic">'Twixt Greek and Turk</span> (1881), recounted his adventures and observations on a trip along the politically restless and violent Graeco-Turkish border. In 1882 the London <span class="italic">Standard</span> sent him back to Egypt to cover Wolseley's campaign against Arabi Pasha. He continued to travel and to produce occasional journalism, making his first visit to India in 1883, traversing a primitive Persia in 1884, and serving as <span class="italic">The Standard</span>'s war correspondent in the Sudan in 1885. The following year he was in Sofia for the dramatic end to Prince Alexander's rule in Bulgaria.<br>
<br>These were valuable <i>Wanderjahre</i> for Chirol; he gained on-the-spot experience of international politics and a number of well-connected and well-informed friends, among them Moberly Bell, who in 1890 was appointed managing editor of <span class="italic">The Times</span>. At Bell's urging the paper had set up a separate foreign news department with the widely respected correspondent, and Chirol's friend from Bulgarian days, Donald Mackenzie Wallace, as foreign editor. When Bell offered Chirol a job in 1891, Wallace warmly seconded the offer. The opportunity of working with Bell and Wallace, and for a paper with the reputation and influence of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, along with financial losses that reduced his scope for working part-time, led Chirol to accept. His post was to be Berlin, rapidly becoming one of the most important capitals on the recently remodelled map of Europe.<br>
<br>Chirol, a slight, dapper man of medium height with reddish hair and blue eyes, moved to Germany in May 1892. Encouraged to acquit himself like the diplomat he already felt himself to be, he began &#145;the most important years of [his] life&#146;  (Chirol, 264). Extraordinarily adept at winning the confidence of German officials, including the foreign minister, Marshall von Bieberstein, and the behind-the-scenes architect of German foreign policy, Friedrich von Holstein, Chirol began at once to analyse German affairs, internal and external. Initially disposed to promote good Anglo-German relations, Chirol aimed for a balanced and open-minded tone in his dispatches. A growing awareness of the brutality of German politics, the unstable character of her autocratic emperor, and the aggressive nature of her military and imperial ambitions, began to suggest to him that Germany was, at best, an uncertain friend to England. In 1896 Chirol's special relationship with German officialdom abruptly ended when, in the aftermath of the Kruger telegram incident, he published the details of its authorship and the extent of German ambitions in South Africa in <span class="italic">The Times</span> of 4 January. Hurt and frustrated at being ostracized by his former friends, and ridiculed by them in the manipulated German press, he returned to London. Not yet a thoroughgoing Germanophobe, Chirol's suspicions of Germany were now well planted.<br>
<br>Chirol took himself, and his position as a representative of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, very seriously. Sensitive to slights touching on his dignity or his patriotism, he found that doubts not laid to rest were hard to forget. Although never physically robust and often in poor health, he was intrepid, even pugnacious, ever ready to defend himself and his opinions. Intellectually honest and deeply moral, he could not accept the duplicity that he felt permeated German diplomacy. On his return to London in 1896, Chirol served as Wallace's deputy until he became foreign editor in 1899; for the next twelve eventful years he decided the position that <span class="italic">The Times</span> would take on foreign affairs. England soon abandoned diplomatic &#145;isolation&#146; and allied herself to Japan in 1902, followed in short order by ties with her former enemies France and Russia. Increasingly convinced of the seriousness of the German threat, Chirol actively promoted these connections and then worked to strengthen them. He also worked to improve Anglo-American relations and, believing fervently in the beneficent capabilities of the British empire, he devoted himself to its preservation.<br>
<br>Chirol was an exacting but encouraging editor. Under his direction a distinguished team of foreign correspondents made the paper's foreign news coverage pre-eminent throughout the world. He attempted to steer a middle course, aiming at a more balanced attitude to Germany than he himself had adopted as Berlin correspondent. Cultivating his quite exceptional relationship with the diplomatic and Foreign Office establishment, he listened closely to what his contacts had to say to him, while maintaining his personal independence and a sense of responsibility to his readership. When Lord Northcliffe bought <span class="italic">The Times</span> in 1908 Chirol stayed on but was worried and upset by what he saw as the inevitable vulgarization of the august old &#145;Thunderer&#146;. As changes at the paper multiplied, and the tempo of international crises increased, Chirol's health could no longer stand the strain of newspaper work. Granted a knighthood on his retirement in 1912, he continued to chronicle history in the making and serve the British empire. A productive author, his numerous titles reflect his lifelong interest in the East, most particularly in India. While still in Berlin he published <span class="italic">The Far Eastern Question</span> (1896), and, during his years as foreign editor, <span class="italic">The Middle Eastern Question</span> (1903) and <span class="italic">Indian Unrest</span> (1910).<br>
<br>On his retirement Chirol was named to the royal commission on the Indian Civil Service (1912&#150;16), an appropriate appointment given his continuing fascination with Indian history and culture, and deepening concern with the political future of both the raj and the indigenous population. Between his work on the commission and the necessity of collecting evidence for his defence in a libel suit brought against him in 1915 by the Indian extremist Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Chirol spent the equivalent of several years effectively living in India. He was finally acquitted in the libel action in 1919, but by then had been exposed to the problems that would face India in a post-war world, an exposure that led him to write two further volumes, <span class="italic">India Old and New</span> (1922) and <span class="italic">India</span>, a volume in the <span class="roman">Modern World Series</span> (1926). Egypt also continued to fascinate Chirol; in 1921 he republished, as <span class="italic">The Egyptian Problem</span>, articles written for <span class="italic">The Times</span> on the rise of militant Egyptian nationalism.<br>
<br>Given his profound knowledge not only of Europe but of the Near East, Chirol was useful to the Foreign Office during the war. In 1915 he was sent on a secret tour of the Balkan states to try to bring them into the war on the allied side, an attempt that, through no fault of his, failed. At the end of the war Chirol went to the peace conference at Versailles to liaise between the French press and the British delegation on questions concerning the future of south-eastern Europe and Turkey.<br>
<br>Chirol always had time for his friends. Accused in later accounts of excessive sensitivity and touchiness, he was in fact a loyal, generous, and understanding friend, who had warm and enduring friendships with some of the most interesting and vital men and women of his time. A testament to one such friendship is his <span class="italic">Cecil Spring-Rice: in Memoriam</span> (1919). Never married, he loved the amenities of family life and was as fond of children as they of him. He was a member of the Athenaeum, a founder and governor of Lady Margaret's School in Parsons Green, London, and a director of the weekly publication <span class="italic">The Near East and India</span>. A keen and able watercolourist, Chirol also loved music and was a discriminating collector of art and artefacts from around the globe. He wrote two well-received volumes of memoirs, <span class="italic">Fifty Years in a Changing World</span> (1927) and <span class="italic">With Pen and Brush in Eastern Lands</span> (1929).<br>
<br>Although Englishmen later realized the debt that was owed to Chirol's presentient grasp of the threat posed by an armed and hostile Germany, his favourite tribute came from the then German foreign minister, Count von B&uuml;low, in 1899. In a secret memorandum, published after the war, B&uuml;low said that given the na&iuml;vety and blind confidence of the British ruling classes, &#145;the most dangerous Englishmen for us are those who, like Chirol and Saunders, knew from personal observation how sharp and deep is the German dislike of England&#146;  (Dugdale, 114).<br>
<br>Chirol died of a heart attack at 34 Carlyle Square, Chelsea, London, on 22 October 1929 and was cremated at Golders Green crematorium. A Catholic as long as his mother lived, he had never forgiven the French clergy for their role in the Dreyfus affair. According to his wishes, an Anglican memorial service took place on 28 October at St Martin-in-the-Fields.<br>
