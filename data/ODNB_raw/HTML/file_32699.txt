<span class="headword">Dalziel,  Davison Alexander</span>, Baron Dalziel of Wooler  (1852&#150;1928), <span class="occ">newspaper proprietor and financier</span>, was born in Camden Town, London, on 17 October 1852, the youngest son of Davison Octavian Dalziel (1825&#150;1875) and his wife, Helen, daughter of Henry Gaulter. He was descended from a Northumbrian family distinguished for both artistic and business ability: of the eight sons of his paternal grandfather, Alexander Dalziel of Wooler (1781&#150;1832), seven became artists; four of them, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32701/', "George Dalziel")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32700/', "Edward Dalziel")</script>, John Dalziel, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32703/', "Thomas Bolton Gilchrist Septimus Dalziel")</script>&#151;the &#145;Brothers Dalziel&#146; [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75984/', "Dalziel family (per. 1840&#150;1905)")</script>]&#151;produced as engravers, draughtsmen, and publishers a large proportion of the woodcut illustrations issued in England between 1840 and 1880. The eighth son, Davison Dalziel's father, became a businessman rather than an engraver.<br>
<br>Dalziel went to New South Wales in his youth and worked as a journalist on the Sydney <span class="italic">Echo</span>. On 29 January 1876 he married Harriet Sarah (1854&#150;1938), the daughter of John Godfrey Dunning of Edinburgh, at St James's Church, Sydney. Their only child, Helen, died on 21 December 1910.<br>
<br>As a young man Dalziel also spent several years in the United States, where he gained experience of newspaper management. On returning to London in 1890, and with American financial backing, he became one of the founders of Dalziel's News Agency. In 1910, together with Sir Alexander Henderson, he bought a controlling interest in <span class="italic">The Standard</span> and the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> newspapers from Sir Cyril Arthur Pearson, and was chairman of the board of directors for many years. Under his management, <span class="italic">The Standard</span> made a name for itself through its &#145;Woman's platform&#146; page, allowing supporters and opponents of female suffrage to argue their case. Dalziel was also a shareholder in the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> from 1912 to 1916. He controlled the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> from August 1915 until 1917, when he sold it for &pound;10,000.<br>
<br>In 1916 Dalziel disposed of his newspaper interests (<span class="italic">The Standard</span> ceased publication in 1917 and the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> was sold to Sir Edward Hulton), and became prominent as a director of public companies, chiefly those concerned with overland transport. In 1906 he formed the General Motor Cab Company Ltd, of which he was initially vice-chairman and then chairman, 1907&#150;12. In 1907 he was chiefly responsible for the introduction of motor cabs in London. He was chairman of the Pullman Car Company from its inception in 1915 and was a director of the International Sleeping Car Company, being elected chairman and president of the managing committee in 1919. He became chairman of the International Sleeping Car Share Trust Ltd in 1927, a holding company which he formed with a capital of &pound;5.25 million in order to gain a controlling interest in the International Sleeping Car Company. The next year he negotiated the purchase by the latter company of the touring agency business of Thomas Cook &amp; Son.<br>
<br>Dalziel, who had always put his newspapers at the service of the tory party, was elected to parliament as a Conservative MP for Brixton in January 1910, having been narrowly defeated in 1906. He was an effective speaker and an able advocate of tariff reform. Except for a short interval in 1923&#150;4, he continued to represent Brixton in the Commons until he was raised to the peerage as Baron Dalziel of Wooler in 1927, having already been created a baronet in 1919.<br>
<br>Dalziel was a man of ability and energy: in negotiation he was forceful yet conciliatory, and much of his success was due to personal charm which, combined with business acumen and friends in government, secured to him the loyalty of friends and associates both in Great Britain and elsewhere. He died at his home, 18 Grosvenor Place, Westminster, London, on 18 April 1928. After his death, the peerage and baronetcy became extinct.<br>
