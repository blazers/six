<span class="headword">Sutcliffe,  Alice</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1624&#150;1634), <span class="occ">author</span>, was probably the daughter of Luke Woodhouse, of Kimberley in Norfolk. Little is known about her early life, but she seems to have been attached to the household of Katherine, duchess of Buckingham, the widow of George Villiers, first duke of Buckingham, for she refers to the duchess as &#145;a <i>Mother</i>&#146;. This association with the Buckingham faction makes it likely that Sutcliffe herself was either a Catholic or sympathetic to the Catholic cause, since the duchess of Buckingham was involved in the resurgence in Catholicism at court under the auspices of Queen Henrietta Maria. In addition, Sutcliffe specifically thanks the duchess of Buckingham and her sister for the &#145;<i>Spirituall</i> blessings&#146; they have bestowed upon her, and she concludes her carefully worded prose treatise with a prayer to God for knowledge of &#145;the Glory of the inheritance of his Saints&#146;. Any open statement of Catholicism would, however, have been unwise.<br>
<br>It is likely that Sutcliffe, after leaving the Buckingham household, entered court, for by 1624 she was married to John Sutcliffe of Yorkshire, a squire to James I and subsequently groom of the privy chamber to Charles I. They had a daughter, Susan, of whom nothing else is known. The connection with the Buckingham group appears to have persisted after Sutcliffe's marriage, since her only recorded work, <span class="italic">Meditations of Man's Mortality, or, A Way to True Blessedness</span> (1634), includes dedications to Susan, countess of Denbigh, Buckingham's sister, to Philip Herbert, earl of Pembroke and Montgomery, whose son had married Buckingham's daughter, as well as to Katherine, the widowed duchess of Buckingham.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Meditations of Man's Mortality, or, A Way to True Blessedness</span> comprises a biblical prose treatise and a spiritual poem. It sets out to warn the reader of the omnipresence of death, initially painting a darkly Gothic picture of human sin and damnation, but then turning in the final stanzas to welcome death as a way to salvation and eternal life. The poem demonstrates Sutcliffe's biblical knowledge as well as her classical learning, but she seems to be torn between openly demonstrating her literary skill, and disavowing expertise on the grounds of her sex. Thus, she denigrates her &#145;sex's act&#146; in writing, but simultaneously praises female intelligence:<blockquote>
<div>Nor is there aught that lives in woman kind<br>
</div>
<div>Exceeding the rare prowess of her mind.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Similarly, while the poem attacks Eve as a &#145;Wicked woman&#146; Sutcliffe is also able to defend her sex, &#145;courage woman&#146;. This balancing act between defending women and accepting their vilification parallels that of the central theme of the poem: a fear and a welcoming of death, and of the religious subtext of Catholicism and protestantism. In each case Sutcliffe evades open confrontation between the opposing discourses, but the resulting tensions inevitably thread through the poetry, leaving the reader with a sense of unsettling ambiguity. Among the commendatory poems prefixed to <span class="italic">Man's Mortality</span> is one by Ben Jonson.<br>
<br>The date and place of Alice Sutcliffe's death are not known.<br>
