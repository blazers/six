<span class="headword">Field,  Joshua</span>  (1786&#150;1863), <span class="occ">engineer</span>, was born at Hackney, Middlesex, the son of John Field, a corn and seed merchant in the City of London. His father afterwards became master of the Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors. In 1794 Field was sent to a boarding-school at Harlow, Essex, kept by the Revd J. Brown. In 1803 he began an engineering pupillage at Portsmouth Dockyard under Simon Goodrich, as a draughtsman in the office of Sir Samuel Bentham, and later transferred to the Admiralty at Whitehall. Block-making machinery for the dockyard at Portsmouth was then being made at <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18357/', "Henry Maudslay's")</script> workshop in Margaret Street, off Oxford Street, London, and when Maudslay requested a naval draughtsman for the work, Field was sent there in 1804.<br>
<br>In 1810 Field moved with Maudslay to a new works at Lambeth. In 1812 he became a partner in the firm of H. Maudslay &amp; Co., and in 1822 the firm's name changed to Maudslay, Son, and Field. The business specialized in making marine engines but it also made stationary steam engines of various patterns, machinery for flour, sugar, and rice mills and saw mills, equipment for minting coins, machine tools, waterworks pumping machinery, railway locomotives, and fixed haulage engines for railway inclines. It made the tunnelling shield for M. I. Brunel's Thames Tunnel. The first set of ships' machinery the firm built was for the Thames vessel the <i>Richmond</i> (1813), and its first naval contract was for HMS <i>Lightning</i> (1825).<br>
<br>In 1816 Field was one of the founders of the Institution of Civil Engineers, and he served as vice-president in 1837 and president in 1848 and 1849. He delivered a number of papers at the institution, and in 1821 spent several months making a tour of engineering works in the midlands. Field's illustrated diary of the trip has survived. In 1862 he became a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.<br>
<br>Field was active as a consulting engineer, helping plan the machinery for laying the Atlantic telegraph cable, and advising the Metropolitan Board of Works on sewage disposal works at Deptford. He advised Isambard Kingdom Brunel on the machinery for his steamships, and was one of the committee appointed to deal with the metropolitan local committees of the Great Exhibition. He patented in 1824 a method of reducing the concentration of salt in marine boilers, but this was superseded later by the widespread introduction of the surface condenser.<br>
<br>He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 3 March 1836 and was also a member of the Society of Arts. He was by religion a nonconformist. Details of his family life are sketchy, but Field's wife, Matilda (1797&#150;1874), is thought to have been a niece of John Medenham, one of the partners in the firm from 1812 to 1820. Two of their sons, Joshua (1829&#150;1904) and Telford Field, became partners in the company during the 1860s. There was also a third son, Sidney, who lived at Reigate. Field died at his residence, Balham Hill House, London, on 11 August 1863, and was buried at Norwood cemetery on 18 August.<br>
