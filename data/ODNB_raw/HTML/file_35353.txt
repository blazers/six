<span class="headword">Page,  William</span>  (1861&#150;1934), <span class="occ">historian and antiquary</span>, was born on 4 September 1861 at 26 Norfolk Square, Paddington, London, the third son and fifth and last child of Henry Page (1811&#150;1874), merchant, and his wife, Georgiana (Georgina) Forrester (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1823). He was baptized on 16 October 1861 at St James's, Sussex Gardens. After a short time at Dr Westmacott's local private school, and despite his father's death, he attended Westminster School from January to May 1875. After being articled to a civil engineer, and following his brother to Australia, he was assistant executive engineer to the Queensland government from 1880 to 1884.<br>
<br>In 1885 Page returned to England and joined his brother-in-law William John Hardy, son of Sir William Hardy, the deputy keeper of public records, as partner in the firm of Hardy and Page, record agents. He married on 8 June 1886, apparently at Penzance, Kate Marion 
    (Marianne; 1863&#150;1947)
  , youngest daughter of Charles William Roe of Chiswick, London; they had a son and daughter. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries before he was twenty-six and his first paper, &#145;Some remarks on Northumbrian palatinates and regalities&#146;, appeared in <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span> in 1888. Hardy's residence at St Albans encouraged Page to research Hertfordshire history and archaeology, and to move to St Albans from 1896 to 1902.<br>
<br>Page's output of articles and editions was already voluminous when he came to the attention of Herbert Arthur Doubleday, co-founder of the <span class="roman">Victoria History of the Counties of England (VCH)</span>, begun in 1899. Doubleday had realized that the records on which his contributors depended to produce topographical chapters and manorial descents needed centrally organized searching in London by specially trained researchers and writers. For that he turned to Hardy and Page, who in 1902 became joint, and from 1904 to 1934 was sole, editor of the <span class="italic">History</span>.<br>
<br>Page returned to London, living at Battersea from 1904 to 1906 and at Frognal Cottage, Hampstead, from then until 1922. His impact on the <span class="italic">VCH</span> was dramatic. By 1902 only one volume had appeared; by the end of 1910 there were forty-six. A <span class="italic">Guide</span> published about 1903 was largely Page's work. It underlay <span class="italic">VCH</span> practice until 1950 and indirectly later. He was probably responsible for encouraging the marked architectural content of the early <span class="italic">VCH</span>, served on the Royal Commission on Historical Monuments (England) from 1909 to 1934, and was also an inspector under the Historical Manuscripts Commission.<br>
<br>Failure of funds and the First World War disrupted the <span class="italic">VCH</span>. Page occupied himself with his works <span class="italic">Commerce and Industry</span> (1919) and <span class="italic">London</span> (1923), on the city's early history. After the war he worked, largely without assistance, to bring to publication twenty-one more volumes. In 1922, despite obtaining an office at the University of London's new Institute of Historical Research, he moved to Middleton-on-Sea, Sussex, taking all the <span class="italic">VCH</span>'s materials with him, and became its proprietor in 1928. In 1932 Oxford University awarded him the honorary degree of DLitt, the sole recognition of his service to local history. In order to ensure the <span class="italic">VCH</span>'s continuance he conveyed all the rights in 1933 to the University of London, which set up a management committee of which he remained chairman until he died at Middleton on 3 February 1934.<br>
<br>Page's last edited work, <span class="italic">VCH Rutland</span>, volume 2, appeared posthumously in 1935 prefaced by a full bibliography of his publications, which combined archaeological investigation with a deep knowledge of historical sources and an interest in innovative methodology. His editorial work for the <span class="italic">VCH</span> displays both immense energy and productivity and great tact in dealing with contributors.<br>
