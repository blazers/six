<span class="headword">Anderson,  John</span>  (1817&#150;1892), <span class="occ">warehouseman and department store owner</span>, was born in Aberfeldy, Perthshire, the son of Peter Anderson, a carrier, and his wife, Margaret. His parents died when he was young, and Anderson became an apprentice draper in Perth. After failing to recover his savings of &pound;6 from his employer, he moved to Glasgow in 1835, finding work in a draper's shop. He opened his own small draper's shop in Clyde Terrace in May 1837: according to tradition, he began with a vest-length of cloth, which he made up and sold for sufficient profit to invest in two vest-lengths. Trading on a cash-only basis, in April 1838 he moved to larger premises at 4 Clyde Terrace; eventually he expanded Anderson's General Warehouses to include numbers 2, 3, 4, and 5.<br>
<br>In 1845 Anderson introduced the concept he called &#145;universal trading&#146;&#151;selling different classes of goods under one roof, in the manner of what became known as a department store. Anderson's tactic was to purchase goods in bulk and sell them at massive discounts, in sales advertised heavily in the local press. His profits came from the large and rapid turnover of his stock. His cut-throat tactics, and the innovative practice of selling books, engravings, fancy goods, and all manner of products under one roof, were condemned by rival shopowners. However, attempts to bring him to heel, by boycotting his suppliers and querying the quality of his sale goods, were unsuccessful. Anderson called in inspectors to verify the accuracy of his advertisements, and found new suppliers to replace those who succumbed to the threats of his rivals.<br>
<br>In 1867 Anderson showed the defiant side of his nature once again, after moving to a new home in the socially exclusive Park Gardens. His neighbours were distressed to find a mere shopkeeper living among them and offered to buy him out if he would move elsewhere. In a typically fiery retort Anderson threatened to paint the fa&ccedil;ade of his house in a bright tartan pattern if the matter was raised again. It was not, and Anderson lived happily there for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>In 1856 Anderson's General Warehouses in Clyde Terrace housed seventeen departments. He moved to larger premises that year, in the Polytechnic Hall in Jamaica Street, one of Glasgow's fashionable shopping streets. Naming the store the Royal Polytechnic Warehouse, he lured customers with popular evening lectures, waxworks, exhibitions, and other events. The volume of business continued to grow and in 1867 he moved once more, to 95&#150;99 Argyle Street. In 1887 the mammoth store provided employment for up to 275 men and women.<br>
<br>Anderson possessed strong Christian beliefs and was a teetotaller. In 1836 he joined the Sabbath Morning Young Men's Society for Religious Improvement, and his association with religious causes lasted throughout his life. He made donations to the Salvation Army during the difficult early history of the organization. In 1838 he married Robina Deacon Graham; they had five sons and two daughters. From 1866 Anderson charged customers an admittance charge of 2<i>d</i>. during the new year holidays each year, and he raised around &pound;7000 for charities by this means alone.<br>
<br>Anderson retired from the business in October 1891, handing control to his sons Alexander and Charles. He died on 7 June 1892 at his home, 3 Park Gardens, Glasgow. He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>The world's first department stores are generally believed to have emerged in England, France, and the USA during the 1850s. However, John Anderson instigated his system of &#145;universal trading&#146; in 1845 and by 1850 was selling not only drapery and furnishings, as other early department stores did, but books, engravings, and a wide variety of other goods, in separate departments. If he was not the first department store owner, he was certainly a pioneer of the type of shop, and the retailing methods, which were to become identified with the department store.<br>
