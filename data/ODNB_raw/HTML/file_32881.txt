<span class="headword">Dove,  John</span>  (1872&#150;1934), <span class="occ">colonial official and journalist</span>, was born on 6 November 1872 in Birkenhead, Cheshire, the second son of John Matthew Dove, of Birkenhead and Boreatton Hall, Shropshire, managing director of the Liverpool, London and Globe Insurance Company, and his wife, Amy Gordon, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wood. He was educated at Rugby School and New College, Oxford, where he was an exact contemporary of Lionel Curtis and two years senior to Lionel Hichens and Richard Feetham, all of whom became close friends. He took a third in classical moderations in 1893 and a fourth in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1895. He then read in chambers with J. A. Hamilton (later Lord Sumner), and was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1898.<br>
<br>A lifelong propensity to ill health was made worse by the effects of an early hunting accident, and it was partly in the hope that the warm, dry climate of the veldt would improve his health that in 1903 Dove applied successfully (with the help of a recommendation from Sir William Anson) for the post of assistant town clerk of Johannesburg. There he worked directly under Feetham (in whose house he lived) and joined Curtis and Hichens in the activities of Lord Milner's &#145;kindergarten&#146;. He succeeded Feetham as town clerk in 1905, but resigned following the victory of Het Volk in the Transvaal elections of February 1907. He then worked directly for Lord Selborne (Milner's successor as governor of the Transvaal and high commissioner of South Africa) as chairman of the Transvaal land settlement board, set up to protect the interests of British settlers in the colony. He was closely involved in the kindergarten's activities in support of the unification of the South African colonies, spending autumn 1908 in England attempting to drum up support, and then helping Curtis in the organization of Closer Union societies.<br>
<br>Dove returned to England in spring 1910, exhausted. Nevertheless he was pressed into service as Curtis's assistant in forming Round Table groups around the empire, to discuss and (their founders hoped) agitate for imperial federation, prompting Lady Selborne to comment that &#145;it was clear that his duty was now to die for the Empire, though on the whole not to die in the Transvaal&#146;  (Lavin, 101). He undertook a successful tour of Australia, but shortly after his return to England in March 1911 suffered a physical collapse, necessitating a major operation and a long period of convalescence. He recovered sufficiently to serve in France in the intelligence department of the War Office from late 1917. At the end of 1918 he became a director of the Commonwealth Trust, set up to administer the properties of German and German-Swiss missionary bodies which had been sequestrated during the First World War. On behalf of the trust he undertook journeys to India in 1919 and Mesopotamia in 1919&#150;20.<br>
<br>Late in 1920 Dove was persuaded to become editor of the <span class="italic">Round Table</span> in succession to Geoffrey Dawson. He wrote little for the journal (most editorials still being written by Philip Kerr), and when he did he tended, as he admitted, &#145;to make bricks without straw or rather you may say to steal some of other peoples' straw&#146;  (May, 254). Nevertheless he was an assiduous editor, and one whose style suited the collegiate nature of the journal's editorial board. He remained a firm believer in imperial federation, though under his editorship the journal moved with the times in accepting co-operation as the theme of Anglo-dominion relations. He travelled frequently to Germany and Switzerland to seek cures, and some of his observations on central European politics were published in the journal. He was assisted as editor by H. V. (Harry) Hodson from 1931.<br>
<br>After Dove's death Robert Brand recalled his &#145;inexhaustible courage, battling to the very last of his days with ill-health, with physical difficulties and with still more baffling difficulties of the mind and spirit too&#146;  (Brand, <span class="italic">Letters</span>, vi). Profoundly religious, he was nevertheless prone to doubts and uncertainties, and was not at all dogmatic. Dougal Malcolm thought that he &#145;came as near to real saintliness as is given to our frail humanity&#146;  (May, 59). A keen chess player, in his youth he enjoyed hunting, fishing, shooting, and golf, but had progressively to give up these pursuits. He retained an interest in art, and at the end of his life hoped to enrol as a student at the Slade School of Fine Art. He made light of his physical difficulties, and had an impish sense of humour. He was fortunate in having a private income which allowed him to live in comfort, though he was not extravagant and had a streak of austerity. He was unmarried. He died at his home, the Lower House, North Aston, Oxfordshire, on 18 April 1934. After his death a volume of his letters (mainly from travels in India, Mesopotamia, and Europe) was published, edited by Robert Brand.<br>
