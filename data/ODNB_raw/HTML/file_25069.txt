<span class="headword">Selwyn,  William</span>  (1806&#150;1875), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25068/', "William Selwyn (1775&#150;1855)")</script> and Laetitia Frances (<i>d</i>. 1842), youngest daughter of Thomas Kynaston of Witham, Essex, was born on 19 February 1806. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25066/', "George Augustus Selwyn (1809&#150;1878)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25064/', "Sir Charles Jasper Selwyn (1813&#150;1869)")</script> were his brothers. He was educated under Keate at Eton College from 1823 and entered St John's College, Cambridge, in October 1824. In the following three years in succession he gained Sir William Browne's medal for a Greek ode, and in 1826 carried off all the Browne medals. In the same year he was Craven scholar. He graduated in 1828 as sixth wrangler, and also senior classic and first chancellor's medallist. His subsequent degrees were MA in 1831, BD in 1850, and DD in 1864.<br>
<br>In March 1829 Selwyn was made a fellow of St John's, and in the same year gained the Norrisian prize. He was ordained deacon by the bishop of Ely in 1829 and priest by the bishop of Rochester in 1831. In 1831 he was presented by the duke of Rutland to the rectory of Branstone, Leicestershire. He married on 22 August 1832 Juliana Elizabeth, eldest daughter of George Cooke of Carr House, Doncaster. In 1846 he exchanged Branstone for the vicarage of Melbourne, Cambridgeshire, in the gift of the dean and chapter of Ely. He held Melbourne until 1853. In 1833 he was made a canon residentiary of Ely, an office which he retained until his death. When his brother-in-law Dean Peacock died he was offered the deanery of Ely. He declined it as it would have involved the resignation of the Lady Margaret professorship to which he was elected in 1855, having beaten his chief competitor, Harold Browne, by the casting vote of the chairman. &#145;It is Harold the conqueror this time, not William,&#146; was his remark to his opponent, under the impression that the election had gone the other way. He insisted on setting apart out of his own income the yearly sum of &pound;700 for the better endowment of the Norrisian professorship during Harold Browne's tenure of it, and after that for furthering the study of theology in Cambridge. Selwyn lived to see the new divinity school erected with the funds thus raised. In 1857 he was appointed Ramsden preacher and in 1859 was chaplain-in-ordinary to the queen. He served on the committee to revise the Authorized Version of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>. He was a fellow of the Royal Society from 1866, honorary joint curator of Lambeth Library from 1872, and president of the Cambridge Philosophical Society in 1867.<br>
<br>Selwyn had a strong interest in church&#150;state relations, taking legal action to try to prevent Irish disestablishment. His major concern was the position of the cathedral in the church. He questioned the centralizing tendency of the ecclesiastical commission, and its emphasis upon the parish, publishing a pamphlet in 1840 entitled <span class="italic">An Attempt to investigate the True Principles of Cathedral Reform</span>. He believed in the capability of the church to reform itself through its councils, notably the chapter, when elevated to a role of bishops' council. In 1852 he was named a member of the cathedrals commission, and the report of 1854 was understood to be largely his work. He was also the moving cause of the rebuilding of his own college chapel, for which purpose funds had been accumulating under the bequest of a late master.<br>
<br>In appearance Selwyn was tall and spare, having been a keen oarsman in his youth. In Michaelmas term 1866, when riding along the Trumpington Road, he was thrown from his horse, owing to the carelessness, it was said, of an undergraduate who was riding on the wrong side of the road. In a copy of Latin elegiacs, dated 20 November, which appeared in <span class="italic">The Times</span> of 15 December 1866, the sufferer apostrophized the &#145;juvenum rapidissime&#146; in lines of mingled humour and pathos. He never wholly recovered from the effects of the fall and died at Vine Cottage, Cambridge, on 24 April 1875, being buried at Ely on 29 April. He left a widow but no children. Selwyn published letters, speeches, sermons, and works on <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> criticism.<br>
