<span class="headword">Austin,  Samuel</span>  (1796&#150;1834), <span class="occ">watercolour painter</span>, was probably born on 30 September 1796, and baptized on 23 October at the Mount Pleasant Wesleyan Chapel, Liverpool, the son of Samuel (or possibly William) Austin and his wife, Mary. His early years are obscure. He attended the Liverpool Blue Coat School from 1806 to 1809, after which he was apprenticed in the office of a merchant, William Barber, before turning to a career in art. The extent of his formal training is not known, but he is said to have had three lessons in watercolour from Peter DeWint. He exhibited at the Royal Academy only once, in 1820, but from 1824 onwards he regularly showed work in London, first with the Society of British Artists, of which he was a founder member, and then with the Society of Painters in Water Colours. Although he spent time in the capital he lived chiefly in Liverpool and was closely involved with the Liverpool Academy, being an associate from 1815 and a member from 1823, and serving as secretary in 1824&#150;7 and 1830. His exhibited works were mostly landscapes, coastal scenes, and architectural views, of subjects in and around Liverpool and north Wales and as far afield as the channel coast and the Scottish highlands. From 1829 he showed views of towns and scenery in the Netherlands, Germany, and France, presumably travelling to the continent about this time. He worked principally in watercolour, usually in a lively, spirited style, occasionally employing dramatic lighting effects which show the influence of Turner. An outstanding work from the very end of his career is <span class="italic">East Quay, Princes Dock</span> (Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool), which vividly evokes the bustle of Liverpool in its early nineteenth-century heyday. He was one of several artists who contributed plates to Robert Wallis's <span class="italic">Lancashire Illustrated</span> (1829&#150;31). He was also active as an art teacher, among his pupils being the translator Anna Swanwick. Austin married Elizabeth Sophia Adams (<i>d</i>. 1848) and had six children. His eldest daughter, Anna Mary (1821&#150;1909), married the architect Lewis Hornblower and was herself an artist. Austin died at Cefn-y-gribin, Montgomeryshire, on 15 July 1834, and was buried near by at Llanfyllin on 19 July. A portrait in oils by Alexander Mosses and a miniature by Thomas Hargreaves, both in the possession of his descendants, record the good looks that are said to have impressed his contemporaries. A centenary exhibition was held at the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, in 1934.<br>
