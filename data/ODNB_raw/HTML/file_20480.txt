<span class="headword">O'Callaghan,  Edmund Bailey</span>  (1800&#150;1880), <span class="occ">journalist and historian</span>, the youngest of the six children of Owen O'Callaghan, merchant, was born in Mallow, co. Cork, about 1 March 1800, and was educated in his home town. About 1820 he went to Paris to study medicine and remained there for two years. In 1823 he emigrated to Canada, where in 1826 he obtained the post of apothecary at the Montreal General Hospital. Licensed to practise medicine in 1827, he was the surgeon at the Quebec emigrants' hospital from 1828 to 1829. At the same time he was actively involved in several societies for the relief and welfare of Irish immigrants. In 1830 he married Charlotte Augustina Crampe, an Irishwoman. She died in 1835, having borne one son who did not survive infancy.<br>
<br>O'Callaghan soon became a spokesman and champion of the Irish community in Canada. In 1833 he moved to Montreal, where he became a close associate of Louis-Joseph Papineau, the leader of the nationalist Patriote Party, and in 1834 was appointed editor of <span class="italic">The Vindicator</span>, the party organ, in which he attacked the colonial government and sought to rally Irish support for the French Canadian cause. He was elected in the same year to the Canadian assembly as the member for Yamaska. His calls for agitation and civil disobedience contributed to the heightening of the political tension in the autumn of 1837, when his editorial offices were sacked by loyalists. When the revolutionary party met at Richelieu River in October to determine their final course of action, although O'Callaghan supported Papineau in condemning the resort to arms, he took the field with the rebels, and was in the action at St Denis on 23 November 1837. On the failure of the rising he fled with Papineau to the United States.<br>
<br>O'Callaghan found such a congenial home in New York state that, when his companions returned to Canada under amnesty, he remained in Albany, where he practised as a doctor from 1839 to 1847. On 9 May 1841 he married Ellen Hawe, of Albany; there was one son of the marriage, who died in infancy. He continued his journalistic activity, and while researching some articles on anti-rent agitation for the <span class="italic">Northern Light</span> became interested in the original Dutch land grants and other documents relating to the early history of New Amsterdam, which lay neglected in the office of the secretary of state. He learned Dutch in order to pursue his researches more widely, and in 1846 published the first volume of his <span class="italic">History of New Netherland, or, New York under the Dutch</span>, a work which marked a new epoch in American historiography. In 1848 he gave up medicine to become the archivist of the state of New York, and to edit the transcripts of documents copied from archives in The Hague and elsewhere by J. R. Brodhead. A selection of these was published in his four-volume <span class="italic">Documentary History of the State of New York</span> (1849&#150;51). The full translated collection was subsequently published as <span class="italic">Documents Relative to the Colonial History of the State of New York</span>, (11 vols., 1853&#150;61). In these the French source material on the border dispute between New France and New York was made available for the first time. Earlier, in 1847, he had published a seminal paper which first drew attention to the importance of the Jesuit <span class="italic">Relations</span> as sources for North American history.<br>
<br>In 1870 O'Callaghan was persuaded by Mayor Abraham Oakey Hall to move to New York in order to edit the minute books of the city council, but the fall from power of his political patrons in the Tweed Ring scandal halted publication of the series in 1872. The fifteen manuscript volumes of the work have survived in the archives of the New York Historical Society. After 1877 he was, owing to an accident, confined to his house, 651 Lexington Avenue, New York, where he died on 29 May 1880. He was buried on 2 June in Calvary cemetery, New York. His library, containing a unique collection of Jesuit <span class="italic">Relations</span>, was sold on 4 December 1882 by Bangs &amp; Co. of New York for $12,098. <br>
<br>O'Callaghan was particularly gratified by the honorary degree of MD awarded to him in 1845 by the University of St Louis; it was his only medical qualification. A man of deep Catholic faith, he retained to the end of his life a strong sense of loyalty to his Irish homeland. The final harnessing of his energies to archival research resulted in work which put the early colonial history of North America on a solid foundation.<br>
