<span class="headword">Wilks,  Mark</span>  (<em>c.</em>1760&#150;1831), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on the Isle of Man, and entered the East India Company's service. Earlier intended for the ministry, he had a classical education, and so went to India older than was usual. He obtained a cadetship in 1781, and on 25 September 1782 was commissioned into the Madras army. In 1786 he became deputy secretary to the military board, and in 1787 secretary to a diplomatic mission under Sir Barry Close to the sultan of Mysore. In 1788 he was appointed fort adjutant at Fort St George, and on 6 March 1789 he was promoted lieutenant, and served as aide-de-camp to the governor. From 1790 to 1792 he acted as brigade major and aide-de-camp to Colonel James Stuart during the war against Tipu Sultan of Mysore. In 1793 he was assistant adjutant-general, and in 1794 was appointed Stuart's military secretary. From 1795 to 1799 he was on furlough from bad health and on 12 October 1798 was promoted captain. On his return he served successively as military secretary and private secretary to the governor, Edward, second Baron Clive. He was next appointed town major of Fort St George, and in 1803 became military secretary to the commander-in-chief, Lieutenant-General James Stuart. From 1803 to 1808 he was political resident at the court of Mysore, and was promoted major on 21 September 1804 and lieutenant-colonel on 4 April 1808. In 1808 ill health obliged him to leave India.<br>
<br>On 20 November 1812 Wilks was appointed governor of St Helena (then still under the East India Company), and he arrived there on 22 June 1813. His administration was firm and enlightened, and he was popular. He improved agriculture by introducing better methods of cultivation, and by persuading the East India Company to alter the land tenure system. He was promoted brevet colonel on 4 June 1814. He was described as, in 1815, &#145;a tall, handsome, venerable-looking man, with white curling locks and a courtier-like manner&#146;  (Corbett, 5). He was governor on the arrival of Bonaparte on 15 October 1815, but was not made responsible for Bonaparte, who continued in the custody of the naval officer who brought him. However, they met and conversed through an interpreter, largely on chemistry and on India, and Wilks refused to take an appeal from Bonaparte to the prince regent to England. Wilks's account of their conversations was published by Julian S. Corbett in 1901. In April 1816 Wilks was replaced by Sir Hudson Lowe and left St Helena, leaving there &#145;a veneration for his name which will be long affectionately cherished&#146;  (Jackson, 216). Wellington and others believed that if Wilks had been retained his relations with Bonaparte would have been better than Lowe's. He returned to England and retired from the company's service on 15 October 1818.<br>
<br>Wilks's fame rested chiefly on his admired <span class="italic">Historical Sketches of the South of India in an Attempt to Trace the History of Mysoor</span> (vol. 1, 1810; vols. 2 and 3, 1814). For early Mysore history he had access to the state records, and he had participated in the later events he described, and from his official employment had ample knowledge of state transactions. His history was impartial, and Sir James Mackintosh praised it as &#145;the first book on Indian history founded on a critical examination of testimony and probability, and from which the absurdities of fable and etymology are banished&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; Mackintosh</span>, 69), though he disagreed with Wilks's &#145;more favourable opinion of the Indian character&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Wilks married twice. His second wife, whom he married at Bath on 16 February 1813, was Miss D. Taubman, youngest daughter of J. Taubman of Bath. With his first wife he had a daughter, Laura (1796/7&#150;1888), married at Bath on 22 July 1817 to Major-General Sir John Buchan (<i>d</i>. 1850) of Kelloe. She was famous for her beauty, on which she was complimented by Bonaparte, who gave her a bracelet.<br>
<br>Wilks's publications included <span class="italic">A report on the interior administration, resources, and expenditure of the government of Mysoor</span> (Fort William, 1805). On 23 February 1826 he was elected FRS, and he was for some years a vice-president of the Asiatic Society, in whose <span class="italic">Transactions</span> he published an analysis of the philosophical work of Nas&iacute;r ud d&iacute;n of T&uacute;s entitled <span class="italic">Aklak i Naseri</span>. Wilks died of apoplexy at Kelloe House, near Edrom, Berwickshire, the residence of his son-in-law, Major-General Sir John Buchan, on 19 September 1831.<br>
