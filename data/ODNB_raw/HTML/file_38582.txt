<span class="headword">Wood,  Haydn</span>  (1882&#150;1959), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born on 25 March 1882 at Slaithwaite in Yorkshire, the son of Clement Wood (1833&#150;1886) and his wife, Sabra Sykes, who died in 1902. He was the youngest of twelve children, four of whom did not survive infancy. He was born into a musical family. His father having been captivated by a performance of Haydn's <span class="italic">Creation</span> shortly before his birth, Wood was named after that composer (but the name was pronounced to rhyme with maiden). When he was two his family moved to the Isle of Man, where he lived throughout his childhood. In a supportive family Haydn Wood received violin lessons from his older brother Harry and became a child prodigy. By the age of twelve he was featured playing solos in Slaithwaite and at the island's holiday resort, Douglas. At fifteen he won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music, studying violin with Enrique Fern&aacute;ndez Arbos and composition with Charles Villiers Stanford, whose traditionally minded approach consolidated Wood's own m&eacute;tier, which eventually brought him worldwide recognition as a composer of popular ballads and light classical orchestral music. At the opening of the Royal College of Music Concert Hall in 1901 the solo violinist was the nineteen-year-old Haydn Wood. Present were the great violinists Joseph Joachim and Pablo Sarasate, whose commendation helped decide him to go to Brussels for special training under C&eacute;sar Thomson. As solo violinist he embarked on a world tour with soprano Mme Albani, with whom he was associated for eight years. Composition remained a driving force. In 1905 his &#145;Phantasy&#146; string quartet came second in the competition for the prestigious Cobbett chamber music prize. His piano concerto, first performed in 1909 to very good reviews, received its most prestigious performance in London's Queen's Hall in 1913 under Willem Mengelberg.<br>
<br>On 23 March 1909 Wood married the popular soprano (Clara) Dorothy Court (1883&#150;1958), daughter of Thomas Court. This led to his writing lyrical romantic ballads, eventually numbering more than 200. His melodic gift and ability perfectly to marry his inspiration to the lyrics he astutely chose brought him enormous success, notably with &#145;Bird of Love Divine&#146; (1912), &#145;Love's Garden of Roses&#146; (1914), and &#145;A Brown Bird Singing&#146; (1922). His most famous song, &#145;Roses of Picardy&#146;, was first set by Herbert Brewer and rejected by the publishing firm Boosey. Fred Weatherly then took his lyrics to Haydn Wood and Chappell published their song in 1916. Perfectly expressing the hope that rose above the anguish engendered by the horrors of the First World War, the song was an immediate hit. Over 3 million records and over 2 million song copies were sold and Wood's fortune was made.<br>
<br>Music for the stage came in 1915, when Wood contributed material for <span class="italic">Tina</span> at the Adelphi. This was followed in 1917 with the musical comedy that he composed, <span class="italic">Cash on Delivery</span>, staged at the Palace Theatre. He also contributed to <span class="italic">Dear Love</span>, staged in 1929 at the Palace Theatre, London. He wrote <span class="italic">Lochinvar</span> and other major choral works, and several solo pieces for solo violin and other instruments.<br>
<br>Haydn Wood's numerous orchestral compositions, eagerly welcomed by the many light orchestras and ensembles flourishing in municipalities, theatres, cinemas, spas, and seaside resorts, ranged from unpretentious, tuneful miniatures such as <span class="italic">An Evening Song</span> (1923), many incorporated into suites such as <span class="italic">Paris</span> (1935), <span class="italic">Frescoes</span> (1936), and <span class="italic">Cities of Romance</span> (1937), to more extended pieces like <span class="italic">A May-Day Overture</span> (1918), and those founded on Manx folk tunes and dances such as the tone poem <span class="italic">Mannin Veen</span> (1932) and rhapsodies <span class="italic">A Manx Rhapsody</span> (1931) and <span class="italic">Mylechrane</span> (1946). His traditional style most effectively expressed itself in more serious symphonic works with his overture <span class="italic">Apollo</span> (1935), <span class="italic">Soliloquy</span> (1949), <span class="italic">Philharmonic Variations</span> for cello and orchestra, and in particular the violin concerto.<br>
<br>Wood was quiet and unassuming and his lifestyle in later years was increasingly retiring, though he did appear on the rostrum from time to time to conduct his own works. His music's popularity continued to the end of his life, and included a BBC Light Music Festival commission in 1954, <span class="italic">Gipsy Rhapsody</span>. His march <span class="italic">The Horse-Guards, Whitehall</span> from the suite <span class="italic">London Landmarks</span> (1946) was a signature tune for the popular BBC radio programme <span class="italic">Down your Way</span> over many years. His tuneful output continued into his seventies, including <span class="italic">Serenade to Youth</span> (1953) and the march <span class="italic">Lutine Ahoy</span> (1954). Having suffered from heart disease for some time, Wood died peacefully in a London nursing home, The Priory, Roehampton, on 11 March 1959, shortly before his seventy-seventh birthday. He had no children.<br>
