<span class="headword">Mayne,  Symon <span class="st"> [Simon]</span></span>  (<em>bap. </em>1612, <em>d.</em> 1661), <span class="occ">regicide</span>, was baptized at Dinton, Buckinghamshire, on 17 February 1612, the son and heir of Symon Mayne (1576/7&#150;1617) of Dinton Hall, near Aylesbury, and his wife, Coluberry (<i>d</i>. 1629), daughter of Richard Lovelace of Hurley, Berkshire, sister of the first Lord Lovelace and widow of Richard Beake of Haddenham, who died in 1606. The elder Symon Mayne died on 13 July 1617, aged forty, and was buried in Dinton church, where a large monument was erected in his memory. His will reveals a prosperous and generous man: it includes legacies of &pound;20 each to a niece and a nephew, to his two godsons and to seven stepchildren, with smaller sums to all his servants and to poor people in three parishes. His wife inherited the Dinton estate, with reversion to their son on her death, which occurred on 10 January 1629; she too was buried in Dinton church. The family's long lease from the dean and chapter of Rochester for the nearby parishes of Haddenham, Cuddington, and Kingsey was left to their daughter, another Coluberry (or Celiberry), who married Thomas Boulstrode (or Bulstrode) of Upton, Buckinghamshire, with reversion to her young brother after fifteen years.<br>
<br>In November 1630 Mayne enrolled as a student at the Inner Temple. His first marriage, on 23 May 1633, was to Jane Burgoine (1613/14&#150;1641), then aged nineteen, eldest daughter of John Burgoine of Sutton, Bedfordshire, and his wife, Jane, daughter and heir of William Kempe of Finchingfield, Essex. After her death he married Elizabeth (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Woodward), perhaps the widow of someone called Tow, of Essex. They had three sons, Symon, Edward, and Samuel, a mercer. Mayne was related to many families who supported the cause of parliament in the civil war, including his near neighbours Arthur Goodwin and Sir Richard Ingoldsby. He threw in his lot with them and served on the grand jury of Buckinghamshire, which apparently presented an address to Charles I for the dismissal of his army in 1642. On 14 June 1645, after the battle of Naseby, Cromwell is said to have stopped at his house, Dinton Hall. About September 1645 he was returned as a recruiter MP for the nearby borough of Aylesbury. He was a prominent figure in the parliamentarian government of Buckinghamshire, the author of the <span class="italic">Mystery of the Good Old Cause</span> (1660) describing him as a &#145;great committee man, wherein he licked his fingers&#146;. Certainly, as early as October 1643 he had secured the sequestered lands he had formerly held under lease from the dean and chapter of Rochester. In 1648 he helped sponsor a petition from Buckinghamshire in support of the radical vote of no addresses ending parliament's approaches to Charles I for a settlement. Local power was emphasized when, in September 1648, he and his cousin Henry Beake, George Fleetwood, and others signed a defiant reply to the treasurers of sequestration, following demands for a speedy account of profits from sequestrations for the county in their charge. In 1649 he was appointed one of the judges for the trial of Charles I, attended on most days, and signed the warrant for the king's execution [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "Regicides")</script>]. Not active in parliament, he served during the protectorate on the committee for Buckinghamshire.<br>
<br>After the Restoration Mayne, as a regicide, was excepted from the general act of pardon. What is believed to have been his temporary hideout was discovered in 1804 during restoration work on Dinton Hall. In June 1660 he surrendered to a serjeant-at-arms and was tried at the Old Bailey on 13 October. Bulstrode Whitelocke recorded that Mayne's wife retained him as counsel to prepare a petition to the king. At his trial Mayne made an inaccurate and incoherent defence: &#145;I knew not of the King's bringing up [to London], I was never at any Committee&#146;. When asked, of the death warrant, &#145;see if your hand and seal be not upon it&#146;, he replied &#145;I acknowledge it is my hand, &hellip; there was a gentleman told me I should be sequestered as a delinquent &hellip; saith he, you will rather lose your estate than take away the king's life&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>). He was found guilty and sentenced to death.<br>
<br>Mayne's health may never have been robust. As early as 1635 and 1636 he and his wife had received licences &#145;for notorious sickness&#146; to eat flesh on fish days. After his committal to the Tower his illness became fatal and he died there on 13 April 1661 &#145;from gout, with fever and convulsion-fits&#146;. An inquest was held next day, and Sir Edward Nicholas gave the lieutenant of the Tower a warrant for delivery of the corpse to the widow &#145;for interment in the country without ostentation&#146;. Mayne was buried in Dinton church on 18 April 1661. The lands sequestered from the dean and chapter of Rochester had been restored to them (and leased to a member of the royal household) but the Dinton estate, forfeited by Mayne, was regained by his widow in 1664, the conveyance being made by Christopher Egleton of nearby Ellesborough, who had known Mayne, and George Goswell of Beaconsfield. Elizabeth Mayne died in 1694 and was buried at Dinton on 10 August. The Dinton estate remained in the family until well into the next century.<br>
