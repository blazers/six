<span class="headword">Hobry <span class="st"> [Aubry; <em>other married name </em>Defermeau]</span>,  Mary</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1688), <span class="occ">murderer</span>, was a French Catholic midwife of the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields who emerged into prominence in late January 1688 when the head, torso, and limbs of her husband, Denis Hobry, were discovered one by one around London. His trunk was behind a dunghill in Parker's Lane, his limbs in one privy in the Savoy, his head in another. Much speculation centred on these body parts. The case became one site of rumour and debate over the Catholic menace in the months prior to the fall of James II. That three illustrations of Mary Hobry's crime and punishment are included in a deck of playing cards about the Revolution suggests the significance of the crime as a portent of the social and political disorder which could flourish under a Catholic king.<br>
<br>The reassembled body was displayed in the St Giles bone house in the hope of determining the victim's identity. Once the victim was identified as Denis, Mary Hobry was apprehended on 2 February at the house of one of her clients. At the time of the murder she had been married to Denis for four years. Confusion as to the couple's last name seems to have been a consequence of the fact that they did not speak English, and that their English neighbours had a hard time grasping their name. Mary Hobry also seems to have been known by the name of her first husband, Defermeau. She had two children from her earlier marriage, a married daughter and a thirteen-year-old son who was a weaver's apprentice. Although both were living in London, neither lived with Hobry and her husband in Castle Street. A coroner's inquest was held on 8 February. A true bill was found against Mary at the Old Bailey on 22 February; she was arraigned the same day for petty treason and murder. She pleaded guilty.<br>
<br>The fullest account of the events of 27 January appears in Roger L'Estrange, <span class="italic">A Hellish Murder Committed by a French Midwife, on the Body of her Husband, Jan. 27, 1687/8</span> (London, 1688); other printed versions seem to have been based on this lengthy pamphlet. Since Hobry had confessed to her crime, and there was no trial, the tory journalist Sir Roger L'Estrange was concerned that there would be no published account to counter the many rumours circulating about the case, especially those attaching political significance to the murder: &#145;The late Barbarous Murder of Denis Hobry, (what with Malice, Prejudice, Credulity and Mistake) has put more Freaks and Crotchets into the Hearts and Minds of the Common People, than any Story of that size perhaps ever did in this World before&#146;  (L'Estrange, sig. A2<i>r</i>). Therefore L'Estrange assembled and published what he viewed as the case against Hobry: the sworn testimony of numerous witnesses, taken before him as investigating magistrate, as well as her own detailed &#145;confession&#146;, which he secured in a private interrogation with the help of a translator. L'Estrange emphasized the domestic nature of the murder. He explicitly pressed Mary on why she had disposed of parts of the body in privies at the Savoy, thereby incriminating the religion she professed. She replied that her only thoughts had been &#145;to part the Limbs and the Body, and hoped the Water might carry them away&#146;  (L'Estrange, sig. F3<i>r</i>). Similarly Henry Care, a journalist who was a whig ally of the king's, was concerned to refute &#145;the Croakings of the Faction&#146;  (<span class="italic">Publick Occurrences</span>, 3, 6 March 1688), who had been busily turning the murder &#145;to the disadvantage of the Government, and scaring people, as it must needs be acted on some Religious score, and but the Bloody Prologue to some greater Tragedy&#146;  (ibid., 1, 21 Feb 1688). Care emphasized that the murder was the result of &#145;<i>private Malice</i> or <i>Revenge</i>&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>All accounts of the murder suggest that the marriage had been contentious and violent. The couple fought about Denis's extravagance, especially his seizure and waste of what Mary Hobry earned through her &#145;industrious Care&#146; as a midwife  (<span class="italic">Warning-Piece</span>, 2), his drunkenness and dissolute life, which Mary claimed had infected her with a sexually transmitted disease, and his insistence that she &#145;submit to a compliance with him in Villanies contrary to Nature&#146;  (L'Estrange, sig. E3<i>v</i>). The couple alternated between separations, when Denis returned to France, and brief reconciliations, during which he would promise to amend his ways, with spells of open hostility.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">A Hellish Murder</span> presents not only the fullest account of the murder itself, but also the one most sympathetic to Mary Hobry, since it so vividly details her provocation. On the night of the murder, by this account, Denis &#145;attempted the Forcing of this Examinate to the most Unnatural of Villanies, and acted such a Violence upon her Body in despite of all the Opposition that she could make, as forc'd from her a great deal of Blood&#146;  (L'Estrange, sig. F<i>r</i>). He also beat Mary, threatened her, and &#145;bit her like a Dog&#146;  (ibid., sig. F<i>v</i>). After he fell asleep she contemplated her limited options and decided to deliver herself from misery by killing him. She strangled him with a piece of packthread he used as a garter. Mary then spent several days deciding how to dispose of the body; at last, on 30 January, she dismembered him.<br>
<br>Presenting the murder as the culmination of marital conflict did not render it less threatening, as L'Estrange seemed to hope. After all, murdering one's husband was distinguished from other murders as petty treason, and was associated by analogy with high treason, that is, any threat to or assault on the monarch and his or her government. For women, the punishments for petty and high treason were the same: burning at the stake. On 23 February Hobry was sentenced to be burnt; the sentence was carried out at Leicester Fields on 2 March. While the timing of the murder and Mary Hobry's status as a French Catholic made her crime even more controversial, her gruesome death links her to other murderous wives, whose murder of their husbands was also understood as treason.<br>
