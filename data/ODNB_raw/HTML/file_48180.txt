<span class="headword">McColvin,  Lionel Roy</span>  (1896&#150;1976), <span class="occ">librarian</span>, was born on 30 November 1896 at Heaton, Newcastle upon Tyne. He was the second son and third child of John Andrew McColvin, a portrait painter, and his wife, Isabel (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Stewart); there were two more children, of whom one, Eric Raymond (<i>b</i>. 1904), was afterwards librarian at the polytechnic, Regent Street. In 1901 the family moved to London and finally settled at 38 Lebanon Road, East Croydon. McColvin attended Portland Road primary school, and, at the age of eleven, won a scholarship to Croydon Council Boys' Secondary School, later part of Selhurst grammar school. In 1911 he became a junior assistant in the central library in Katharine Street, following his elder brother, Norman. McColvin enlisted in the 24th Middlesex regiment in 1915, transferred to the 2nd Border regiment, and fought in the third battle of Ypres in October 1917. He returned to Croydon public libraries in 1919 and was later appointed reference librarian. He attended the school of librarianship at University College, London, and passed the Library Association examinations in 1920&#150;21; his diploma thesis, <span class="italic">Music in Public Libraries</span>, completed and approved in 1923, was published in 1924. Appointed chief assistant at Wigan Public Library on 1 April 1921, he there met and on 18 April 1922 married Mary Carter, the only daughter of William and Esther Carter.<br>
<br>McColvin became chief librarian at Ipswich in the summer of 1924 and the new central library opened in September 1924. He took an active part in planning the interior, and made much of it open-access for the first time. Helped by William Paul, a local corn merchant, he secured enough money to restock the shelves; he promoted musical activities, created a children's library, encouraged extension work and the drama, and actively publicized the library service. A keen amateur musician, he organized celebrity concerts in Ipswich and through them met many famous musical figures. He contributed to <span class="italic">The Sackbut</span>, the <span class="italic">Musical Times</span>, and other musical papers. Between 1920 and 1929 McColvin contributed to <span class="italic">Library World</span> under the pseudonym Aristonymous, and, under another pseudonym, John Molvin, wrote plays, two of which were published, and most of which were produced by the Ipswich library players. This culminated in his Ipswich pageant play <span class="italic">To Kill the Queen</span>, produced between 17 and 20 June 1931.<br>
<br>In 1931 McColvin was appointed chief librarian at Hampstead and curator of the Keats House Museum. His principal achievement was the new Belsize Library, but he also rejuvenated the lending library stock and introduced chamber music concerts. In 1936 he undertook a survey of public libraries in the United States, part of an international project undertaken by the Library Association, and the results, edited by McColvin, appeared in 1938. While at Hampstead he published a number of influential books: <span class="italic">Library Stock and Assistance to Readers</span> (1936); <span class="italic">Libraries and the Public</span> (1937); and <span class="italic">Music Libraries</span> (2 vols., 1937&#150;8). On 1 April 1938 he became city librarian at Westminster and remained there until his retirement on 30 November 1961. In 1940 he was put in charge of the civil defence report centre for Westminster, but still found opportunity, granted six months' paid leave of absence, to undertake extended tours around the country for an inquiry into the public library service, published as <span class="italic">The Public Library System of Great Britain</span> (1942): the McColvin report. But its recommendations were not then accepted.<br>
<br>McColvin served on the Library Association's council from 1925; he was also a member of the wartime emergency committee, honorary secretary (1934&#150;51), editor of the <span class="italic">Library Association Record</span> (1941&#150;5), president (1952), and honorary fellow (1961). He was made CBE in 1951. McColvin worked for UNESCO and was a member of its British co-operating committee; he also worked for the British Council and travelled extensively on its behalf, and was a member of the International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA) as vice-president and chairman of the public libraries section, and of the Society of Municipal and County Chief Librarians, which he was instrumental in establishing. In Westminster, in the post-war period, he opened a new branch library in Charing Cross Road and founded the central music library. He was a member of the Roberts committee, whose report (1959) led to the 1964 <span class="roman">Public Libraries and Museums Act</span>. He was forced to retire in 1961, affected by defective memory caused by two strokes, and died on 16 January 1976 at Southgate. He was cremated at Golders Green.<br>
<br>McColvin (Mac) was personally unassuming and not especially gregarious. A pipe-smoker and beer-drinker, he was always accessible to colleagues, no matter how junior, and was willing to listen, quick-witted, a fluent speaker, and an excellent committee man; he wrote and published prolifically. He was agnostic, although his wife was a Roman Catholic. His eldest son, (Kenneth) Roy, later became librarian of Lambeth. McColvin was the most influential British public librarian of the twentieth century. He was best-known for his promotion of cultural extension activities in libraries, and his insistence on the key role of public libraries in community life.<br>
