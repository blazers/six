<span class="headword">Vincent,  John Painter</span>  (1776&#150;1852), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was born at Newbury, Berkshire, the son of Osman Vincent, silk merchant and banker in Newbury, who lived at nearby Donnington. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28314/', "Richard Budd Vincent")</script>, naval captain, was his elder brother. John Vincent was apprenticed in 1793 to William Long, who was surgeon to Christ's Hospital and assistant surgeon to St Bartholomew's Hospital. While an apprentice he attended Leigh Hunt, then a boy at Christ's Hospital, who said that Vincent &#145;was dark, like a West Indian, and I used to think him handsome&#146;  (Hunt, 141). Vincent became a member of the Company of Surgeons on 20 March 1800, and of the newly incorporated Royal College of Surgeons two days later. He was assistant surgeon to St Bartholomew's Hospital from 1807, succeeding William Long and taking over his house in Lincoln's Inn Fields. He was full surgeon from 1816. Vincent married Maria, daughter of Samuel Parke of Kensington, on 28 May 1812; they had six children, of whom three sons survived him. One became a barrister, and two became clergymen. His wife died in October 1824, and he then married Elizabeth Mary Williams, who survived him.<br>
<br>At the Royal College of Surgeons Vincent was a member of the council (from 1822), a member of the court of examiners (1825&#150;51), Hunterian orator (1829), vice-president (1830, 1831, 1838, and 1839), and president (1832 and 1840). He was not in favour of establishing fellowships, but was one of the original 300 elected in 1843.<br>
<br>&#145;Old Vinco&#146; was popular with the students. He always walked to the hospital, &#145;shuffling along with short steps, his hands never in his pockets, never behind him, but always clasped in front, as if ready to do handy work. He was very careful of his hands, and well he might be, for they were his best instruments&#146;  (Plarr, 462). Vincent was an &#145;able practical surgeon, shrewd in diagnosis &hellip; he never taught in the school&#151;never even, I think, gave a clinical lecture &hellip; disposed to avoid operations, unless obviously necessary&#146;  (ibid., 462). He wrote little, but published his Hunterian oration in 1829, and a work on surgical practice, in 1847.<br>
<br>Vincent fell ill and resigned as surgeon to St Bartholomew's in 1847; he was made a governor of the hospital, but he kept his college offices until 1851. He died at Woodlands Manor, near Wrotham and Sevenoaks, Kent, on 17 July 1852, and was buried in the church he had built at Woodlands, where his youngest son was perpetual curate.<br>
