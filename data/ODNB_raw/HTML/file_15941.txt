<span class="headword">Lambert, Sir  John</span>  (1772&#150;1847), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 28 April 1772, the son of Captain Robert Alexander Lambert RN (<i>c</i>.1732&#150;1801), second son of Sir John Lambert, second baronet, and his wife, Catherine, daughter of Thomas Byndloss of Jamaica. He was commissioned ensign in the 1st foot guards on 27 January 1791, and promoted lieutenant and captain on 9 October 1793. He served at the sieges of Valenciennes and Dunkirk, and was in the action of Lincelles in 1793. He was adjutant of the 3rd battalion in the campaign of 1794, served with it in Ireland during the uprising of 1798, and in the expedition to the Netherlands in 1799. He was promoted captain and lieutenant-colonel on 14 May 1801. He served in Portugal and Spain in 1808, was present at Corunna, and commanded the light companies of the guards in the Walcheren expedition of 1809. He became colonel in the army on 25 July 1810, and embarked for Cadiz in command of the 3rd battalion on 30 May 1811. In January 1812 he was sent to Carthagena with two battalions. He remained there three months, and in October joined Wellington's army at Salamanca.<br>
<br>On 4 June 1813 Lambert was promoted major-general, and was appointed to a brigade of the 6th division. He commanded it at the battles of the Nivelle, the Nive, Orthez, and Toulouse, and was mentioned in dispatches. He received the thanks of parliament and the gold cross, and was made KCB on 2 January 1815. Having been sent to America, he joined the army under Sir Edward Pakenham below New Orleans on 6 January 1815, with the 7th and 43rd foot regiments. In the unsuccessful attack on the American trenches, made two days afterwards, he commanded the reserve. When Pakenham was killed, and General Gibbs mortally wounded, the chief command devolved on Lambert. He decided not to renew the attack, withdrew the troops which had been sent across the Mississippi, and, after retreating on 18 January, re-embarked his force on the 27th. It went to the Bay of Mobile, where Fort Bowyer was taken on 12 February, and next day news arrived that peace had been signed.<br>
<br>Lambert returned to Europe in time to command the 10th brigade of British infantry at Waterloo. The brigade joined the army from Ghent only on the morning of 18 June, and was at first posted in reserve at Mont-St Jean. After 3 p.m. it was moved up to the front line to support the 5th (Picton's) division, and one of its regiments, the 27th, which had to be kept in square near La Haye-Sainte, lost two-thirds of its men, a heavier loss than that of any other regiment. Lambert received the thanks of parliament, the order of St Vladimir of Russia (3rd class), and that of Maximilian Joseph of Bavaria (commander). He commanded the 8th infantry brigade in the army of occupation in France. On 19 October 1816 he married Jane (<i>d</i>. 22 May 1864), daughter of John Morant of Brocklehurst Park, New Forest.<br>
<br>Lambert was promoted lieutenant-general on 27 May 1825, and general on 23 November 1841. He was given the colonelcy of the 10th regiment on 18 January 1824, and was made GCB on 19 July 1838. He died at Weston House, Thames Ditton, Surrey, on 14 September 1847, aged seventy-five.<br>
