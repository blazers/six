<span class="headword">Cooper,  Edward Herbert</span>  (1867&#150;1910), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, born at Trentham, Staffordshire, on 6 October 1867, was the eldest son of Samuel Herbert Cooper of New Park, Trentham, later of Newcastle under Lyme, Staffordshire, and his wife, Katharine, daughter of the Revd Edward James Justinian George Edwards and granddaughter of the bibliographer James Edwards. While at a preparatory school at Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, Cooper contracted a chill, which caused an illness that lasted seven years and left him partially disabled. Prepared for Oxford by a private tutor, he matriculated at University College on 18 October 1886, took third-class honours in history in 1889, and graduated BA in 1890.<br>
<br>After a false start in chartered accountancy in London, and in politics as secretary of the Suffolk Liberal Unionist Association at the general election of 1892, Cooper found his feet as a writer. His first novel, <span class="italic">Geoffrey Hamilton</span>, a rather plotless work but with some good Oxford autobiographical tales, was published in 1893. It was followed in the same year by <span class="italic">Richard Escott</span>, and then by the stronger work <span class="italic">The Enemies</span> (1896), about Ireland after the Parnell affair. Later that year Cooper joined in Paris the staff of <span class="italic">Galignani's Messenger</span>, and acted as Paris correspondent for the <span class="italic">New York World</span>. <span class="italic">Mr Blake of Newmarket</span>, an excellent sporting story, and <span class="italic">The Marchioness Against the County</span>, a social satire, were both published the following year, in 1897. <span class="italic">Mr Blake</span> drew a letter of praise from Lord Rosebery, and <span class="italic">The Sportsman</span> called it &#145;the best exposition of turf life that we know&#146;.<br>
<br>But although Cooper dabbled in a variety of genres, producing twenty-three works, he found his greatest success as a children's writer. In 1899 he began a series of imaginative stories for the young, told by a pretty little rich girl, Wyemarke. They were: <span class="italic">Wyemarke and the Sea Fairies</span> (1899); <span class="italic">Wyemarke and the Mountain Fairies</span> (1900); <span class="italic">Wyemarke's Mother</span> and <span class="italic">Sent to the Rescue, or, Wyemarke's Adventures in South America</span> (1903); and <span class="italic">My Brother the King</span> (1910). The tales owed much to the suggestion of Lewis Carroll, but there was originality in their execution. Cooper also aided the philanthropist Benjamin Waugh in practical efforts to protect children from cruelty.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Cooper travelled a great deal in search of better health. In 1898, supported by two sticks, he made the ascent of Mont Blanc as far as the Col du Go&ucirc;ter, and in 1901 he visited Finland. He afterwards wrote in the London press on Finland's constitutional struggle, and the following year assisted in the preparation of the English version of N. C. Fredericksen's <span class="italic">Finland: its Public and Private Economy</span>. In 1903 he returned to London, and was for three years special reporter on the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>.<br>
<br>Cooper, whose features were marked by a rare refinement, bore his physical disabilities with courage and cheerfulness. He had an inveterate addiction to gambling: while cheering on his favourite horse at the Newmarket racecourse on 26 April 1910 he suffered an apoplectic seizure and died. He was buried in Kensal Green cemetery, London. He was unmarried.<br>
