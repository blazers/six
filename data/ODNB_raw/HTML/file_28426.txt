<span class="headword">Walbran,  John Richard</span>  (1817&#150;1869), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, son of John and Elizabeth Walbran, was born at Ripon, Yorkshire, on 24 December 1817, and educated near by at Whixley. After leaving school he became assistant to his father, an iron merchant, before entering business as a wine merchant in Ripon. His antiquarian interests led to his becoming local secretary of the British Archaeological Institute, which he addressed in 1846 &#145;On the necessity of clearing out the conventual church of Fountains&#146;. Publication of the paper resulted in excavations at Fountains Abbey, carried out under his personal direction, which marked the beginning of the modern archaeological study of that important site. Walbran also studied the documentary sources, publishing the first volume of <span class="italic">The Memorials of the Abbey of St. Mary of Fountains</span> for the Surtees Society in 1864. This was followed by a second, posthumous volume completed by James Raine in 1878. The first volume of another uncompleted work, his <span class="italic">History of Gainford, Durham</span>, was published in 1851 with the support and assistance of his friend William Harrison, printer, of Ripon. Walbran embarked on other substantial local antiquarian studies, but did not see them to completion. He did, however, have success as a writer of popular guides of a scholarly type. His <span class="italic">Guide to Ripon</span>, which included Harrogate and the abbeys of Fountains and Bolton, was published in 1844 and went through nine editions, under various titles, during his lifetime. He also shared the contemporary taste for the picturesque, publishing <span class="italic">A Summer's Day at Bolton Abbey</span> in 1847, which combined his antiquarian knowledge and a sensitive evocation of the landscape, complete with quotations from Wordsworth.<br>
<br>Walbran married, on 3 September 1849, Jane, daughter of Richard Nicholson of Ripon, solicitor and left two sons, the elder of whom, Francis Marmaduke Walbran of Leeds, was the author of works on angling. Walbran was elected FSA on 12 January 1854, and in 1856 and 1857 was mayor of Ripon. In April 1868 he was struck with paralysis, and died on 7 April 1869. He was buried in Holy Trinity churchyard, Ripon. After his death his manuscripts were purchased by Edward Akroyd of Halifax, and deposited at York Minster Library.<br>
