</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Martin,  Richard</span>  (1570&#150;1618), <span class="occ">barrister and politician</span>, was born at Otterton, Devon, the son of William Martin of Otterton and Anne, daughter of Richard Parker of Sussex. He matriculated at Pembroke College, Oxford, as a commoner in 1585, and made his mark as a debater although he left without taking his degree. He entered the Middle Temple in 1590, but was temporarily expelled after leading a riotous Lord of Misrule festival in February 1591. Martin became part of the Mitre circle of poets and wits whose members included Ben Jonson, Fulke Greville, John Selden, John Hoskins, Arthur Ingram, and Lionel Cranfield, whose close friend and attorney he became. His mercurial temperament was suggested by an incident in February 1598 in which he was assaulted with a cudgel by Sir John Davies, who had earlier prefaced his &#145;Orchestra&#146; with a dedicatory sonnet to him.<br>
<br>Martin was elected MP for Barnstaple, Devon, in 1601, through the patronage of Robert Chichester. He made his maiden address on 10 November, was active in the debates against monopolists, and won attention by chiding Serjeant John Hele for suggesting that subsidies belonged to the monarch by right. On 8 December he was appointed to the committee for privileges. In 1602 he was called to the bar, and in 1603 he gave a speech of welcome on James I's accession at Stamford Hill which, published with the king's assent, earned him the sobriquet of London Oracle. Returned again to parliament in 1604 for Christchurch, Hampshire, possibly through the patronage of Sir Robert Cecil, he soon emerged as one of the half-dozen leaders of the House of Commons and a frequent spokesman in conferences with the Lords. In 1604 he took a prominent part in the Goodwin&#150;Fortescue election dispute, served as a member of the committee that framed the apology and satisfaction that defended the Commons' privileges, and sharply objected to the speaker's forwarding petitions or bills to the king without the assent of the house. Martin remained similarly active throughout the four sessions of James's first parliament. He was prominent in the debates on the Anglo-Scottish union, supporting Sir Edwin Sandys's brief for a perfect union, and in 1607 he defended John Hare, who had denounced the abuses of purveyance; he joined Hoskins in attacking John Cowell's <span class="italic">The Interpreter</span> for casting aspersions on the common law and the subject's liberties. In 1610 he assailed what he called &#145;an arbitrary, unlimited, and transcendent power to levy impositions&#146;  (Gardiner, 88), and chaired the committee that dealt with this issue. That same year he offered a bill to deprive ministers who exalted prerogative beyond its proper bounds and &#145;tread upon the neck of the law&#146;  (E. R. Foster, 2.328). In November he chaired the important debates over the adoption of the great contract.<br>
<br>Despite the seeming popularity of many of his positions Martin retained his connections with Salisbury, and was praised by Lord Treasurer Sackville for his short and apt answers in conference. He kept up his academic associations, and in September 1611 took part in a philosophical feast at Brasenose College, Oxford. In February 1613 he organized the masque in honour of the marriage of Frederick V, elector palatine, and Princess Elizabeth at the Middle Temple.<br>
<br>The London gossip John Chamberlain reported in 1614 that Martin was growing rich from his legal practice and was unwilling to jeopardize it by standing for parliament again; Francis Bacon also noted that &#145;Martin hath money in his purse&#146;. He did appear before the House of Commons in May as counsel for the Virginia Company, which he had represented since 1612. Departing from his brief, however, he lectured the Commons on their slow proceedings and disorderly carriage, was censured by the house, and was forced to recant his remarks. This episode, too, does not appear to have done Martin lasting damage although the company's leading projectors, the earl of Southampton and the lords Sheffield and De La Warr, were furious with him. In 1616 he was Lent reader of the Middle Temple, and James commended him at Cranfield's suit to succeed Sir Anthony Benn as recorder of London in 1618. Installed on 1 October, he died some time between 31 October and 7 November 1618 and was buried in the Temple Church. His will was executed by the mayor of Exeter, and contained small bequests to the parish church of Otterton as well as to that of Culliton-Raleigh, Devon, where his country residence was located.<br>
<br>Martin never married, although he was rumoured to be the father of a daughter by Lady Lake. His untimely death aborted a career still in the ascendant. He was admired by many of the leading figures of his time, and Ben Jonson dedicated his &#145;Poetaster&#146; to him. Anthony Wood reports that Martin was a poet in his own right, although only a single verse epistle, to Sir Henry Wootton, appears to survive. His career should be seen in the context of the group of Middle Temple reformers, including Sandys, Hoskins, and James Whitelocke, that formed the core of the parliamentary opposition in the first two decades of the seventeenth century. The hundred he owned in Virginia still bears his name. It was the site of a massacre of colonists by local Indians in 1622.<br>
