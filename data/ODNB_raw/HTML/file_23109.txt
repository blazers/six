<span class="headword">Randall,  John</span>  (1570&#150;1622), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in 1570 at Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, and sent &#145;by his relations&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.319) to St Mary Hall, Oxford, matriculating aged eleven on 27 November 1581. Following a move to Trinity College, Randall graduated BA on 9 February 1585, was elected a fellow of Lincoln College on 6 July 1587, and proceeded MA on 9 July 1589. Among his pupils at Lincoln in the early 1590s was the impoverished future puritan Robert Bolton (1572&#150;1631), to whom he lent many books. Tutor Randall was &#145;of no great note then, but afterward became a learned divine and godly preacher at London&#146;  (Bagshawe, 6&#150;7). When Queen Elizabeth visited Oxford in August 1592 Randall was appointed to &#145;frame and oversee the stage for the academical performance given&#146; in her honour  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Afterwards Randall studied divinity, and was admitted BD on 28 June 1598.<br>
<br>On 31 January 1599 Randall was presented by Gilbert Talbot, seventh earl of Shrewsbury (1553&#150;1617), to the rectory of St Andrew Hubbard, London; he applied for his preaching licence on 14 May. There he made a reputation as a staunch puritan and effective preacher; he married a wife and had a daughter, but outlived both. When he began to draw up his will on 11 January 1622, he had been afflicted by a serious illness. Randall bequeathed property to the poor of the parishes of Great Missenden, All Hallows, Oxford, and St Andrew; a tenement called Ship Hall to Lincoln College, Oxford; and property in Southwark and Oxford, as well as money, to various relations including eight married sisters. His brother Edward Randall and nephew Joshua Randall were named executors. The will was signed on 13 April and Randall died at his house in the Minories in May, probably at the end of the month since he was buried in St Andrew Hubbard in June. In the same year William Holbrooke, who seems to have been his curate from about 1613, published his mentor's <span class="italic">The Description of Fleshly Lusts</span>, <span class="italic">The Necessitie of Righteousnes</span>, and <span class="italic">The Great Mystery of Godliness</span>. The dedications, to Mary, Lady Weld, Lady Bennet, and Mistress Thomasin Owefield, reveal the godly circles of which Randall was a respected member. Further works followed: <span class="italic">St Pauls Triumph</span> (1623) (Sermons on <span class="roman">Romans</span> 8: 38&#150;9); <span class="italic">Three and Twenty Sermons, or, Catechisticall Lectures upon &hellip; the Lords Supper</span> (1630), dedicated to Lady Boys, another friend; and <span class="italic">Twenty-Nine Lectures of the Church</span> (1631), dedicated to Richard Knightley of Preston Capes.<br>
