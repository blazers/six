<span class="headword">Carvajal y Mendoza,  Antonia Luisa  de</span>  (1566&#150;1614), <span class="occ">Catholic missionary</span>, was born in Jaraicejo, Extremadura, Spain, on 2 January 1566, the sixth child of Francisco de Carvajal y Vargas (<i>d</i>. 1572), a nobleman commissioned by the king to high regional posts, and Mar&iacute;a de Mendoza y Pacheco (<i>d</i>. 1572), also of the high nobility. She was baptized there on 15 January. Unsubstantiated seventeenth-century texts refer to Carvajal as the niece of Ignatius of Loyola, which would have facilitated her later intimacy with the Society of Jesus.<br>
<br>Following a move to Le&oacute;n in 1571 both of Carvajal's parents died of a contagious disease a year later and she was moved to the royal palace in Madrid under the guardianship of her maternal grandmother's sister, Mar&iacute;a Chac&oacute;n, governess of the crown prince. Carvajal's great-aunt died suddenly in 1576, thrusting the young girl into yet another dramatic change. Her maternal uncle, Francisco Hurtado de Mendoza, had unsuccessfully vied for her guardianship in 1572 and aggressively made her his ward at Almaz&aacute;n. A prominent figure in Spanish imperial politics, Mendoza also had close ties to the Jesuits. Under the tutelage of Mendoza's wife, the Marquesa Mar&iacute;a de C&aacute;rdenas, Carvajal learned Latin, accounting, estate management, and the exercise of charity&#151;all standard fare for noblewomen of her day. Her uncle, on the other hand, exercised her in perverse rituals of mortification in which she was forced to disrobe and was whipped and disparaged by two servants appointed to carry out such &#145;exercises&#146;. Similarly, he denied her the exercise of normal bodily functions and arranged other circumstances of deprivation, presumably to teach her to &#145;conquer herself&#146;. Carvajal describes these unseemly activities in her spiritual life story.<br>
<br>In 1586 the family moved to Madrid, where Carvajal's guardians died in 1592. Carvajal took up the life of an urban holy woman, residing with a small community of women in a house close to the Jesuit college. In the 1590s she vowed poverty, obedience to her spiritual superior (whom she chose herself), and the pursuit of perfection. She was still unsatisfied. In 1598 she manifested her anxious desire for God by vowing to seek out martyrdom, a singular promise indeed. By this time Carvajal had designs on an English mission and these vows proved her solidarity with Jesuit politics and faith. She also wrote poetry, most of which dates from this period.<br>
<br>Carvajal's public display of her self-inflicted poverty scandalized her important relatives, and they sued for her inheritance. However, she managed to retain most of her sizeable estate, at the cost of nine years in court and a move to Valladolid in 1601. On 6 January 1605 she willed 12,000 ducats to the Jesuits for the foundation of an English college, leaving 5000 as settlement with her brother. She probably wrote her spiritual life story during her years in Valladolid.<br>
<br>The exile of Catholic priests from England in 1604 moved Carvajal to seek permission officially, if secretly, to go to London, where she would be able to circulate openly in public, which a priest could not do. In spite of an illness related to a heart condition she left Valladolid on 26 January 1605, probably with her confessor, Jesuit Michael Walpole, in disguise as her servant. Five months later she reached Dover and was installed in the house of Henry Garnett, superior of the Jesuit English mission, only to be left to fend for herself when the group suddenly scattered upon threats of a raid. Late in 1605 the Spanish ambassador, Pedro de Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga, installed her at his insistence in his residence in London. The Gunpowder Plot of 5 November 1605, which led to Garnett's execution, endangered Carvajal as a Catholic with close connections to the Jesuits. Insisting that she had not come to England to live with Spaniards, she firmly pursued independence.<br>
<br>By January 1607 Carvajal had rented a house next to the Spanish embassy, where she lived with select English companions, refining her English and beginning her mission in earnest. She visited imprisoned Catholics, particularly priests, to fortify them in the face of execution, recruited funds for Catholic vocations, catechized, hid priests in her house, and supervised the collection and care of the drawn and quartered body parts of executed Catholics. She also arranged baptisms, recruited prostitutes for conversion, and cared for the poor and infirm. Carvajal's Society of the Sovereign Virgin, modelled on the Jesuits, was founded during this period and included the six women who lived with her.<br>
<br>During the last week of June 1608 Carvajal was arrested for public proselytizing in a Cheapside shop, and spent four days in prison. Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga refused to have her released, making it clear that her imprudence was becoming a national liability for Spain. Her letters, however, describe her own exaltation over the experience, which evidently only intensified her zeal.<br>
<br>George Abbot's succession as archbishop of Canterbury on 9 April 1611 assured Carvajal's downfall. Abbot had long been enraged by her freedom of movement and effectiveness, and ordered her arrest at any prison where she appeared. Deteriorating health led Carvajal to move to Spitalfields, where she lived enclosed with her companions because of illness. Such enclosure only fuelled Abbot's rage for its semblance to monastic retirement, and on 28 October 1613 one of the sheriffs of London broke into Carvajal's house and arrested her. However, the diplomatic crisis this provoked was resolved by the able Spanish ambassador, Diego de Sarmiento, who successfully bargained with King James for her release. Three days later Carvajal was removed to the Spanish embassy, where she died, probably resulting from her heart condition, quietly in her bed on 2 January 1614, her forty-eighth birthday.<br>
<br>In her will Carvajal had asked that her body be buried at the Jesuit college in Louvain that her money had founded. The society took her ducats but did not claim her corpse, which was instead welcomed into the reliquary collection of the Real Monasterio de la Encarnaci&oacute;n in Madrid in 1615 by her dear friend, Prioress Mariana de San Jos&eacute;. The members of Carvajal's company were reported to be continuing their work in the London Catholic underground several months after her death.<br>
