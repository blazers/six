<span class="headword">Loudon,  Charles</span>  (1801&#150;1844), <span class="occ">medical writer</span>, was born in Barony, Lanarkshire, and baptized there on 11 October 1801. He matriculated at the University of Glasgow in 1818. By 1826 he had become a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in London; in that year he published his first work, <span class="italic">A short inquiry into the principal causes of the unsuccessful termination of extraction by the cornea</span>. In 1827 he graduated MD at Glasgow.<br>
<br>Loudon established himself in 1828 as a physician at Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, where he published his second work, <span class="italic">A Practical Dissertation on the Waters of Leamington Spa</span>, which went through three editions between 1828 and 1831. He described the forms of treatment and the amenities that were available in this new spa resort that was already attracting an aristocratic and royal clientele. Contrary to the more &#145;quack&#146; medical writers of the day he described the waters as &#145;inapplicable to every ailment&#146;. In Leamington, Loudon first practised at Bedford House before moving to the newly built 3 Clarendon Place, Clarendon Square&#151;both in the fashionable new town being built north of the River Leam. On 12 July 1830, at Leamington Priors, he married Margracia Ryves of Castle Ryves, co. Limerick. They had no children.<br>
<br>In 1833 Loudon was appointed one of the royal commissioners for inquiring into the employment of children in factories. One of three medical commissioners, he investigated conditions in the north-eastern district of Yorkshire, in Leicestershire, and in Nottinghamshire. He contributed articles to medical journals, including a paper in 1832 on the use of leeches on the breasts to cure amenorrhoea and a contribution on the medicinal use of laurel leaves for <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>. In 1836 he published the first of two works on population and subsistence, <span class="italic">The equilibrium of population and sustenance demonstrated, showing on physiological and statistical grounds the means of obviating the fears of the late Mr Malthus</span>. One of many publications of the time that sought to contradict the notion of the &#145;positive check&#146; to population advanced by Thomas Malthus, this was followed in 1842 by a volume published in Paris, <span class="italic">Solution du probl&egrave;me de la population et de la subsistance</span>. In a series of thirteen epistles, Loudon concluded that an extended physical, moral, and religious education would make for a contented population. Loudon had retired to Paris in 1841, and he died there at 9 rue neuve du Luxembourg, on 2 February 1844.<br>
