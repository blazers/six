<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Abell, Sir  George Edmond Brackenbury</span>  (1904&#150;1989), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, was born on 22 June 1904 in Sanderstead, Surrey, the eldest in the family of two sons and two daughters of George Foster Abell, director of Lloyds Bank, and his wife, Jessie Elizabeth Brackenbury. His brother, Sir Anthony Abell, became governor of Sarawak. He was a scholar and senior prefect of Marlborough College, and scholar of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he obtained a first class in classical honour moderations (1925) and a second in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1927). A triple blue, in rugby, cricket, and hockey, he captained the Oxford rugby fifteen in 1926, and played cricket for Worcestershire. In 1928 he married Susan (<i>d</i>. 1992), daughter of Frank Norman-Butler, inspector of schools, and they were close companions throughout the rest of his life. They had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>Abell joined the Indian Civil Service as a district officer in the Punjab in 1928, becoming deputy registrar of co-operative societies and a settlement officer. He enjoyed the work, and coped effectively with crises, quelling a riot in Dera Ghazi Khan gaol by walking into the middle of it while the warders were taking refuge on the roof. In 1941 the governor of the Punjab appointed him as his private secretary, and in 1943 he was promoted deputy secretary to the viceroy, the second marquess of Linlithgow. In 1945 he took over as private secretary to the viceroy, by then Viscount Wavell, and he continued to hold this post under Louis Mountbatten until the end of the raj, thereafter serving as Mountbatten's secretary when he became governor-general of India.<br>
<br>Abell's role in government during the critical years leading up to the partition and transfer of power in India was of central importance. Although the Hindus regarded his Punjab background with suspicion, Wavell, whom he liked and admired, used him to coax M. K. Gandhi, describing him as &#145;diplomatic and persuasive&#146;. He wrote the first draft of the handover scheme to be presented to the new Labour government, and he was on the small committee used by Wavell to work out the details of his &#145;breakdown plan&#146;. He tended to moderate Wavell's tougher telegrams but respected his soldierly directness. However, he came to feel that the British position in India was untenable, that partition was inevitable, and that the British should extricate themselves quickly. Although less comfortable with Mountbatten's personality, he therefore worked happily to implement his policy. He drafted the partition plan for the viceroy with General Hastings Ismay, and he helped to keep him from some of the mistakes inevitably made in the rush to meet the deadline. &#145;The Lord needs George or Ismay to steady him&#146;, commented a diarist close to the scene.<br>
<br>On his return to England in 1948 Abell joined the Bank of England as an adviser, serving as a director from 1952 until 1964. He was responsible for all matters connected with staff, and for the buildings. He developed the new graduate entry, organizing a career structure which made proper use of graduates' talents. He also ended the old division between men and women, and integrated them into one staff. He had directorial responsibility for three major new Bank of England buildings, including the New Change office block at the top of Cheapside.<br>
<br>Abell was first civil service commissioner from 1964 until 1967, chairman of the Rhodes trustees from 1969 until 1974 (having been a trustee from 1949), and chairman of the governors of Marlborough College from 1974 until 1977. He was also president of the council of Reading University between 1970 and 1974. This was at a time of rapidly increasing numbers and general student restlessness. That Reading did not suffer the disruption of many other universities had much to do with the confidence which Abell engendered in dons and students. They respected his mind, and his sense of humour defused many difficult situations.<br>
<br>Abell enjoyed the outdoor life, shot well, and tied his own fishing flies. He remained the all-rounder throughout his life, and he brought his common sense and his clear mind to a wide range of problems. He retained the discretion of the civil servant, and his response to biographers and journalists who wanted to get behind the scenes of the closing years of the raj was that he continued to regard his role as that of a private secretary.<br>
<br>Abell was appointed OBE (1943), CIE (1946), and KCIE (1947). He received an honorary LLD from Aberdeen University in 1947, and became an honorary fellow of Corpus Christi College in 1971. He died at his home, Whittonditch House, Ramsbury, near Marlborough, Wiltshire, on 11 January 1989 and was buried at Ramsbury church.<br>
