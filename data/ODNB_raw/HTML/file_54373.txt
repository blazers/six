<span class="headword">Gray <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Anderson]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>  (1831&#150;1924), <span class="occ">fossil collector</span>, was born on 21 February 1831 at the Burns Arms inn, Alloway, near Ayr, the second child of Thomas Anderson, innkeeper, and his wife, Mary Hamilton Young. She began her education at a small private school in Girvan, after her father moved to Enoch to become a farmer. At the age of fifteen, she was sent to a boarding-school in Glasgow for a year, before returning home in order to help look after her six younger brothers. Her father, a keen naturalist and collector known to Scottish geologists, encouraged her interest in the local Girvan fossils.<br>
<br>At the age of twenty-four Elizabeth met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11352/', "Robert Gray (1825&#150;1887)")</script>, a Glasgow bank inspector, on an ornithological visit to the Ayrshire coast. They were married on 8 April 1856, and continued to make excursions to Girvan each summer, recording the results in the journals of the Natural History Society of Glasgow. Collecting the rich Ayrshire Palaeozoic assemblages became an absorbing family pursuit that was continued every year despite the growing number of children. In 1874 the family moved to Edinburgh when Robert Gray accepted a new post, and Elizabeth Gray then began her co-operation with the many palaeontologists who described her Ordovician fossils.<br>
<br>Throughout her life Elizabeth Gray preferred to devote her energies to discovering fossils and later her objective became the extension of faunal lists. She trained all her family in the practical methods of collecting and documenting specimens. Her successive collections were acquired by the Hunterian Museum, Glasgow (1866); the Royal Scottish Museum (1889); the Geological Survey (<i>c</i>.1890); the Sedgwick Museum (1907&#150;10); and the British Museum (Natural History), London; together they form a unique resource of Palaeozoic fossils.<br>
<br>In 1900 Elizabeth Gray was made an honorary member of the Geological Society of Glasgow for the contribution her collections had made to geological literature. The Murchison geological fund was awarded to her in 1903 in recognition of her skilful services to geological science. A woman of considerable character, determination, and resourcefulness, with a phenomenally retentive memory, she was renowned for her extensive collecting in the Girvan district, which she carried on until the autumn of 1923. She died of heart failure at 59 George Street, her Edinburgh home, on 11 February 1924, after packing a batch of fossils the previous day. An obituarist, J. Horne, described her as &#145;one of the most successful fossil collectors in Scottish geology&#146;.<br>
