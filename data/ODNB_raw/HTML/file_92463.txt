<span class="headword">Wedel,  Lupold  von</span>  (1544&#150;1615), <span class="occ">traveller and writer</span>, was the son of Kurt von Wedel (<i>d</i>. 1552), a Pomeranian knight, and his wife, Anna Borcke (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1573). He was born on 25 January 1544 on the manor of Kremzow (now in Poland), and had at least one brother, Busso, and a sister, Benigna; the sources differ as to whether Lupold or Busso was the elder son. Their father died in 1552, and upon attaining his majority in 1565 Wedel received as his inheritance the Kremzow estate, which remained his chief residence for the rest of his life. He is said to have been sent to school at the age of eight, but efforts to interest him in scholarship appear to have proved fruitless, as he remained in the school for only one year. It may be hindsight that attributes his abortive educational career to restlessness, but certainly between the ages of seventeen and fifty-one his life alternated between periods spent at Kremzow and journeyings as a courtier, soldier, pilgrim, or invalid. As a young man he attended the wedding of William of Orange in Dresden, travelled in Germany in the train of Count Volrad von Mannsfeld, and joined the army which Duke Johann Friedrich of Pomerania-Stettin led against the Turks; his brother Busso is said to have died on this campaign, <i>c</i>.1566. After his return home, Lupold remained there until his mother's death <i>c</i>.1573, and then resumed his travels. During more than twenty years he fought in the French wars of religion, went as a pilgrim to Jerusalem and from there wandered to Cairo, and journeyed in Prussia, Spain, Portugal, England, and Scotland. His last journal entry chronicles his stay at the spa town of Kissingen, where he took the healing waters, perhaps a necessity after his rugged life.<br>
<br>Wedel made copious observations of the people, towns, and sights of the various countries in which he travelled, and also of the military expeditions in which he served; these survive in the form of a journal of more than 700 folio pages. Comments in the journal reveal that he also produced an illustrated book of manners, which has been lost. On 17 August 1584 he came to England, and his journal of his visit, which also took in Scotland, provides a compelling view of late sixteenth-century Britain, combining topographical, geographical, and historical observations with detailed descriptions of cities, people, great events, and wondrous sights. Wedel twice refers to himself as accompanied by an interpreter, and this, combined with his garblings of place names and his laboured attempts at reporting direct speech&#151;as when he describes Queen Elizabeth calling out &#145;Gott seve mi pippel&#146; to bystanders  (&#145;Journey&#146;, 256)&#151;suggests that he had difficulties with the language. But this did not hinder his curiosity, and he comments on everything, from the varieties of Southwark entertainments to the glories of the procession which accompanied the lord mayor of London at his inauguration, along with such oddities as a cow with six legs, and the embalmed corpse of Queen Catherine of Valois, lying in melancholy state in Westminster Abbey (where he sat on the coronation chair)&#151;she reminded him of the embalmed corpses he saw in Egypt. While in London he also attended a bear-baiting, examined two Native Americans brought to England by Sir Walter Ralegh, and observed the workings of the Royal Mint.<br>
<br>Wedel was greatly interested in courts and rulers. He visited the royal palaces of Whitehall, Hampton Court, and Greenwich, and watched Queen Elizabeth admiringly at all three of them: &#145;sitting all alone in her coach [she] appeared like a goddess such as painters are wont to depict&#146;  (Klarwill, 329). He was particularly struck by the magnificence of the post-Christmas revels at Greenwich, with their music and dancing. Overall he thought England was wealthy and fertile, so much so that &#145;Many a yeoman here keeps greater state and a more opulent table than the nobles in Germany&#146;  (ibid., 342). Scotland, however, he seems to have found comparatively drab. As he passed through Northumberland early in September he noted that the crops were still standing in the fields, though near London they were already harvested. Having crossed the border at Berwick, he made his way to Edinburgh, and was able to observe James VI at Sunday worship, without being greatly impressed by either the king or his entourage&#151;&#145;The court does not show much royal splendour&#146;  (&#145;Journey&#146;, 245). The Scots were less impoverished than they looked, he thought, but he was clearly disappointed that they &#145;show no splendour in garments, but are clothed in a very plain way&#146;  (ibid., 248). The &#145;maiden&#146;, the guillotine used to decapitate the earl of Morton, seems to have interested him as much as anything he saw in Scotland.<br>
<br>Wedel left Scotland on 2 October 1584, and returned to London via York&#151;where he admired the minster&#151;and Cambridge. He finally left England on 30 April 1585. About 1595 he married Anna, daughter of Valentin von Eickstedt, chancellor of Pomerania from 1558. The marriage is said to have produced five sons and four daughters; he also had illegitimate children from earlier relationships. Wedel died in June 1615 at Kremzow, and was buried there on either 13 or 15 July. The character given him by his biographers depicts a man thoughtless and quarrelsome but not vicious, one whose wanderlust had overcome his familial feelings. Wedel's accounts of circumstances are not always perfectly accurate; he claims that in 1584 Elizabeth had ruled for twenty-six years without convening parliament, his account of William Parry's conspiracy to assassinate Queen Elizabeth early in 1585 contains several errors, and he freely retails court gossip along with detailed observation. But his eye alike for the rich panorama and for small but telling details have provided social and cultural historians with intriguing insights into English and Scottish life in the 1580s. His journal was published in 1895 as <span class="italic">Lupold von Wedels Beschreibung seiner Reisen und Kriegserlebnisse, 1561&#150;1606</span>. English translations of the portions describing his visit to Britain appeared in 1895 and 1926.<br>
