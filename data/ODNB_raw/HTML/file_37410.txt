<span class="headword">Farnes,  Kenneth</span>  (1911&#150;1941), <span class="occ">cricketer and schoolmaster</span>, was born on 8 July 1911 at home at 141 Wallwood Road, Leytonstone, Essex, the younger son of Sydney Heath Farnes, a brewer's clerk, and his wife, Florence Susanna Georgiana Shipston. He captained the eleven at Royal Liberty School, Romford, and on leaving school (1928) spent &#145;eighteen depressing months [as] a bank clerk&#146;  (Farnes, 27) before giving up his job impulsively in May 1930 to &#145;watch the Australians at Leyton&#146;  (ibid., 30). Seven weeks later, after successful performances for the Gidea Park club side, he made his first-class d&eacute;but for Essex, and soon gained a reputation as a right-arm fast bowler. In his second match for Essex he took five for 36 against Kent. In nine seasons for his county he took 367 wickets, his best performance being in 1938 when he took fifteen for 113 against Glamorgan. Earlier, in 1934, his eleven for 131 had helped Essex to their first win against Yorkshire since 1911.<br>
<br>Freed from banking Farnes went up to Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he won a blue each year (1931&#150;3) and took 113 wickets (average 20.28) for the university. In his last year at Cambridge (1933) against Oxford he took seven for 71, employing the fast leg-theory tactics (employing four short legs) which Larwood had controversially used in the recently ended &#145;bodyline&#146; tour of Australia. He also won an athletics blue for putting the weight. Having read geography and history in his triposes, he was appointed to the staff of Worksop College in Nottinghamshire by F. J. Shirley and made a housemaster after only one term. He proved an ideal schoolmaster, with a quickness of response and a mind well stocked with varied interests. He painted and sketched &#145;with much more than ordinary talent&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Worksopian</span>). He also coached several successful first elevens. Throughout his time at Worksop the school was generous in the frequency in which he was allowed off to play first-class cricket.<br>
<br>Having proved to be the most effective amateur bowler in the 1933 season, Farnes was first selected for England against the 1934 Australians. He took ten for 179 in the first test and secured the wickets of seven out of the eight top batsmen (though the tactics of bodyline bowling were not employed throughout the test series). He never again produced similar figures but in fifteen tests (1934&#150;9) he took sixty wickets (average 28.65), including six for 96 in an Australian total of 604 at Melbourne in 1937.<br>
<br>Some of Farnes's best performances occurred at Lord's for the Gentlemen versus the Players. In 1936 he clean-bowled H. Gimblett, W. R. Hammond, and J. Hardstaff for single figures, bowling &#145;at a pace unequalled at Headquarters since the days of C. J. Kortright&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wisden</span>, 1937, 477). With eleven for 103 he helped the Gentlemen in 1938 to a rare win, again bowling at a devastating pace, while in 1939, in his first match of the season, he secured three wickets in an over.<br>
<br>Farnes was one of the fastest bowlers of his generation. Standing 6 feet 5 inches tall, he delivered the ball from a height of over 8 feet, off an eleven-pace run, and achieved considerable lift. His natural body action imparted swerve and he could make the ball break back from the off. In his career, ended by the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, he took 690 wickets (average 21.45). Without great pretensions as a batsman, he nevertheless made 97 not out against Somerset in 1936, sharing in a last wicket partnership of 149.<br>
<br>Farnes's <span class="italic">Tours and Tests</span> (1940) provided a vivid and picturesque account of his three overseas trips, in a day when the MCC still went to the West Indies by banana boat. His epilogue to the book has poignancy in its anticipation of the contribution which Len Hutton and Denis Compton would make to cricket after the war. A few weeks before the book came out, he made a final appearance at Lord's, in August 1940, for an eleven raised by Sir Pelham Warner&#151;virtually an England side&#151;against a West Indies eleven. Farnes alone of those players (on both sides) would not survive the war. He had joined the Royal Air Force in 1940 and undergone training in Canada. After returning to Britain, Pilot Officer Farnes, who was unmarried, was killed when the Wellington bomber which he was flying crashed at Chipping Warden in Oxfordshire on the night of 20 October 1941. He was buried at the Brook military cemetery, Woking. England's post-war bowling attack was diminished and Worksop lost a housemaster with a &#145;love of life and an enjoyment of fun&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Worksopian</span>), immensely popular and respected by both colleagues and pupils.<br>
