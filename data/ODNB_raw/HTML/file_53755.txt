<span class="headword">Theal,  George McCall</span>  (1837&#150;1919), <span class="occ">historian and civil servant</span>, was born on 11 April 1837 at Saint John, New Brunswick, where his United Empire Loyalist forebears had settled. He was the eldest of the nine children of William Young Theal, a doctor, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bell. Theal's schooling at the Cockaigne Academy and at St John Grammar School gave him the normal grounding of a classical education. Significantly, a favourite book was Gibbon's <span class="italic">Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</span>. After spending time in the United States and west Africa, he was <i>en route</i> for Australia with friends when he decided to stay in South Africa. Frontier newspapers, schoolteaching, some months at the diamond fields, and five years at the Lovedale mission occupied his early years in South Africa. He published two early works: <span class="italic">South Africa as it is</span> and a <span class="italic">Compendium of the History and Geography of South Africa</span> which, by 1877, had reached a third edition. He also collected oral records, subsequently published as <span class="italic">Kaffir Folk Lore</span>.<br>
<br>The years from 1877 to 1881 were crucial for South Africa: widespread frontier resistance was quelled, and Carnarvon's imperially propelled federation project failed. They were also decisive years for Theal. He moved from the eastern Cape to Cape Town and lost his close association with the indigenous people among whom he had worked as missionary and as government appointee. His early sympathy for the conquered peoples disappeared in his later work. Excited by the records of the past that he encountered in his official duties, he became a zealous archivist and dedicated historian.<br>
<br>Theal was appointed colonial historiographer in 1891. This was a decade after his bitter disappointment when the Sprigg government appointed the Revd H. C. V. Leibbrandt to the recently created post of librarian to the house of assembly and keeper of the archives. Theal's consolation was an unwelcome, but better paid and mercifully short, appointment as magistrate at Tamacha. He returned to Cape Town as a clerk in the native affairs department. It was part of his work to prepare summaries of documents and investigate disputes. In addition, he was instructed to search out and prepare for publication documents relating to issues of current concern. His four volumes of <span class="italic">Basutoland Records</span> (three published) and his nine volumes on the <span class="italic">Records of South East Africa</span> resulted from such work. Successive Cape governments backed him in his wider commitment to search for, transcribe, translate if necessary, and prepare for publication the records of Cape Colony. To this end he was permitted to spend long years working in repositories in Britain and in Europe. The most notable result was the thirty-six volumes of <span class="italic">Records of the Cape Colony</span> from 1793 to January 1828. Theal knew foreign languages and drove himself hard; his work was not faultless, but his achievement remains impressive. Long before the age of photocopying, his work equipped scholars in South Africa with some, at least, of the documents necessary for historical research. Writing history flowed from his archival work. Here, too, he achieved and maintained a prodigious productivity. He studied the ethnography of the indigenous people and published the results. More impressively, he achieved an eleven-volume survey of the South African past which brought the story almost up to his own day, as well as a host of smaller histories. He drew on earlier works, but none of his predecessors had attempted quite so broad a canvas. The chronological span of his publications extends from 1871 to the 1960s, when reprints of some of his compilations were issued.<br>
<br>In 1904 the Cape government decided to retire all civil servants over sixty years of age. After vigorous protests and a parliamentary select committee, Theal received a pension based on his salary as civil service clerk, but he retained the title and emoluments of colonial historiographer until his death. He continued to work assiduously. One of his later tasks was to prepare for publication the manuscript of G. W. Stowe's work <span class="italic">The Native Races of South Africa</span>. Theal's ideas were disseminated widely when some of his works were translated into Dutch, and his writing became the basis of school textbooks. He was utterly convinced of his own impartiality and accuracy, and he vaunted his own merits. He omitted annotations from his historical writing and claimed that this was the result of his desire to avoid expense and delay. He has been condemned by late twentieth-century historians for his own self-congratulation&#151;however wide his interests, his sympathies were extremely narrow, and his accuracy has not escaped unscathed the scrutiny of later scholars. Like other historians of his day, writing in other places, he saw history as a progressive movement. For him the theme of progress lay in the achievements of the white population of South Africa, both Boer and colonial British, who in establishing themselves and subjugating the indigenous peoples, made possible the inevitable triumph of civilization over barbarism. Always concerned to defend the white colonist or trekker, Theal berated unpopular officials and humanitarians. He conspicuously failed to see that there was &#145;another side&#146; to frontier issues, and simplified complex movements to the point of caricature. For example to him the upheavals in the interior subsequently called the mfecane resulted simply from the savagery of Shaka, whom Theal called the &#145;Attila of South East Africa&#146;. He similarly dismissed the cattle killing as the &#145;madness&#146; of the Xhosa, whose leaders perpetrated &#145;a blunder such as a child would not have made&#146;.<br>
<br>Theal received honorary doctorates from Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, in 1895 and from the University of the Cape of Good Hope in 1899. The criticisms of his own day were muted and his evident sympathy for the trekkers won him the lasting esteem of many Afrikaner historians. But since 1930, if not earlier, the castigation of Theal has become an academic industry, and his errors and misrepresentations have been frequently subjected to withering attack. Placed alongside the burgeoning studies of black polities and of the experience of indigenous peoples, Theal's work appears now to be at best superficial and smug, at worst callous. Yet historians, like others, are entitled to be judged by the standards of their own context. His presentation of South African history was guided by what he judged to be the crucial needs of his own times&#151;co-operation among the white inhabitants of South Africa and the development among them of a shared sense of identity.<br>
<br>Described as tall and massive, with grey eyes that betokened humour, Theal apparently possessed an air of essential simplicity and charm. He spent his last years at Wynberg. An Episcopalian by birth, he became a Presbyterian by choice, but served as an elder in the Dutch Reformed church at Wynberg. He died in Wynberg on 17 April 1919, survived by two children, Martin William and Hannah Catherine Hester. His wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stewart, had died on 23 November 1911. He was buried in the Dutch Reformed church cemetery at Wynberg. Friends collected funds and commissioned an oil portrait to serve as his memorial. The painting, by Professor E. Roworth, is now housed in the South African Library at Cape Town.<br>
