<span class="headword">Dominis,  Marco Antonio  de</span>  (1560&#150;1624), <span class="occ">archbishop of Spalato and ecumenist</span>, was born on the island of Rab off the eastern Adriatic coast. He was from a prominent family that may have been South Slavic in origin but which had used an Italian name since the fourteenth century. He received his early education at a Jesuit school in Loreto in Italy and entered the Society of Jesus in 1579. Following further education in Verona and Padua he became a professor of mathematics at the University of Padua and of rhetoric and philosophy at the University of Brescia. He made significant contributions to the science of optics during his academic career. His <span class="italic">De radiis visus et lucis</span>, published in Venice in 1611, analysed the refractions of light in droplets of water. In 1597 he resigned from the Society of Jesus in order to accept appointment as bishop of Segna, in Habsburg-controlled Croatia. He made strenuous efforts to pacify the Uskok pirates, refugees from the Ottoman empire who preyed on both Turkish and Venetian shipping, but met with little success. In 1602 he became archbishop of Spalato (Split) and primate of Dalmatia and Croatia. Spalato was in territory controlled by Venice, but much of the archdiocese was in Ottoman hands.<br>
<br>De Dominis took the side of Venice in the crisis over Venetian&#150;papal relations in 1606&#150;7 and wrote, anonymously, two manuscript treatises dealing with the jurisdictional issues in dispute. He argued that papal jurisdiction did not extend to temporal affairs and that the pope had no right to interfere in the affairs of civil governments when there was no issue of religious faith involved. He had reason to resent papal actions in the administration of his archdiocese. He was required to pay a pension to another ecclesiastic, Marzio Andreucci, who became bishop of Tra&ugrave; in 1604, precluding, in de Dominis's opinion, any need for a pension. During his years as archbishop he developed a theory of how the universal church ought to be governed, on the model of the early church; this was the basis of his <span class="italic">De republica ecclesiastica</span>, eventually published in three volumes. King James VI and I's ambassadors in Venice, Sir Henry Wotton, Sir Dudley Carleton, and then Wotton again, along with Wotton's chaplain, William Bedell, cultivated de Dominis's friendship, seeing in him a critic of the papacy whose activities might open the way for protestantism in the Venetian territories or who might take the protestant side in the religious and political controversies that revolved about the oath of allegiance. By 1616, de Dominis had been promised a place of dignity and modest reward by George Abbot, archbishop of Canterbury, and he made plans to migrate to England. By agreement with the papal authorities, who were not aware of these plans, he renounced his episcopal see in favour of his nephew, Sforza Ponzone.<br>
<br>De Dominis set out for England in September 1616 disguised as a Ragusan merchant in the company of two British subjects. Travelling by way of northern Italy, Switzerland, the Rhineland, and the Netherlands, he arrived in England in December 1616. His <span class="italic">Manifestation</span>, explaining his departure from Italy, was published in Latin and Italian in Heidelberg (<span class="italic">Consilium profectionis</span>) in autumn 1616 and in an English translation in London after his arrival there. French and Dutch translations were also published on the continent in 1616. His migration was a sensation in the religiously divided Europe of his day. The reasons he gave included his hope of finding greater intellectual freedom in Britain and being able to encourage a reunion of the church as a community of churches sharing a common faith. It seems clear that he also wanted to find an opportunity, lacking even in Venice, of publishing his <span class="italic">De republica ecclesiastica</span>. The English Jesuits John Floyd and John Sweet wrote rejoinders accusing de Dominis of seeking material gains. They poured scorn on his intended efforts to bring unity to the warring religious sects. In England, de Dominis became a guest of Archbishop Abbot at Lambeth Palace and was given a warm welcome at court by King James. Soon afterwards he received significant appointments: dean of the Chapel Royal at Windsor and master of the Savoy, the hospital with chapel attached, in London. On occasion he preached at the Italian church, the chapel of the Mercers' Company set aside for Italian residents and visitors. In summer 1617 he visited both Cambridge and Oxford and received doctor's degrees at both universities. De Dominis assisted Archbishop Abbot in the consecration of Nicholas Felton and George Montaigne as bishops in December 1617.<br>
<br>De Dominis's stay in England was marked by publications widely circulated in Britain and on the continent. His sermon on 30 November 1617 at the Italian church accused the Church of Rome of having discarded the map and compass, namely the scriptures and the first four general councils, but nevertheless asserted that the churches of Christendom shared a common legacy of faith. The sermon was published in London in Italian and English in 1617 and on the continent in Latin and German in 1618 and in French in 1619. His Latin <span class="italic">Papatus romanus</span> (1617) was a collection of passages about the papacy from the church fathers, the general councils, and canon law, showing that, in earlier times, ecclesiastical power had been shared among Rome and the other major sees. His <span class="italic">The Rockes of Christian Shipwracke</span>&#151;published in English, Italian, French, and German in 1618&#151;argued that papal claims to supremacy were obstacles or rocks in the way of the church's successful voyage. His most important statement on how to reunite the church and to secure peace and concord in Europe was his massive Latin work, <span class="italic">De republica ecclesiastica</span>, which dealt with most of the current theological and ecclesiological controversies. The first volume, published in London in 1617, contained the first four of a projected series of ten books. The second, published in London in 1620, contained the fifth and sixth books. The third volume, containing books seven and nine (eight and ten never appeared), was published in Hanau in 1622. He sought to provide a basis on which the &#145;Bishops of the Holy Catholic Church&#146;, to whom the preface to the first volume was addressed, could unite to oppose papal intrusions and to overcome the dissensions that afflicted the church. In refuting the prominent Roman Catholic theologian Francisco Suarez on the exercise of the royal supremacy in England, he argued that the Church of England was an exemplary case of a reformed church in which the ancient orders of ministry had been preserved, the eucharistic recalling of Christ's sacrifice was celebrated with great solemnity, and parish churches were dedicated to the saints and martyrs and to the Blessed Virgin Mary. The universal church could best be reunited, he contended, by an ecumenical council attended by bishops from the east as well as the west and supported by the temporal rulers. Protestants whose churches lacked bishops would certainly need to be represented at the council. There, theological agreement would be sought on the basis of the scriptures and the decrees of the general councils. If perfect union could not be achieved, differences among the churches might be tolerated where they did not compromise the fundamentals of the faith.<br>
<br>De Dominis assisted in the publication in London of Paolo Sarpi's celebrated <span class="italic">Historia del Concilio Tridentino</span> in 1619, published in an English translation as <span class="italic">The Historie of the Councel of Trent</span> in the following year. Sarpi sought to show that the opportunity of reconciling Roman Catholics and protestants by means of a council had been lost at Trent, partly through the tactics employed by the popes and their agents. De Dominis's dedication of the work to King James implied that he had brought the manuscript to England from Venice to be published. In fact, it was sent in weekly packets from Venice by the English lawyer and scholar Nathaniel Brent to Archbishop Abbot. It was Brent who translated the work into English. But de Dominis knew Sarpi and may have brought a sample of the work to England. In 1617 de Dominis offered advice to the states general of the United Provinces on how to resolve theological disputes in the Netherlands in a moderate way, and in 1619 he wrote to Cyril Lukaris, patriarch of Alexandria, to propose that the Church of England and the Greek Orthodox church formalize the closer relations that had developed between them during James's reign.<br>
<br>In spring 1622, in a remarkable reversal of his earlier migration, de Dominis returned to the continent and to the communion of the Roman Catholic church. He explained his reasons in <span class="italic">Second Manifesto</span>, published in 1623 in Rome as <span class="italic">Sui reditus ex Anglia consilium exponit</span>, and in an English translation in Li&egrave;ge in the same year. He had found, he wrote, that the Church of England was deeply infected with heresy and he acknowledged errors in his own work since his migration to England. In a long letter to Joseph Hall, dean of Worcester, dated 1 March 1622&#151;not published until 1660 as <span class="italic">De pace religionis</span>&#151;he said that he had found the leaders of the English church less willing than their king to recognize the common ground shared by the Church of England and the Roman Catholic church. A further explanation is found in his written answers to interrogations by English ecclesiastical officials in early 1622, before he was given permission to leave the country. He pointed out that the recent accession of Pope Gregory XV, a friend from earlier years in Italy, had given him a potential ally in the cause of religious reconciliation. He received absolution in Brussels from the papal nuncio in May 1622 and journeyed to Rome where he was given housing, provisions, and a stipend. But Gregory XV died in summer 1623, with the result that de Dominis's position became less certain. In April 1624 he was put in prison by the Inquisition while his teachings were examined, and there he died of a fever on 9 September 1624. The Congregation of the Holy Office concluded its case by decreeing, on 21 December 1624, that he had died as a relapsed heretic. As a result his body and his books were burnt at campo dei Fiori, Rome. Among the items considered by the Inquisition was a plan, presumably written after his return, for a reunion involving the Church of Rome, the Church of England, and the reformed churches  (Biblioth&egrave;que de l'Arsenal, MS 4111, 77&#150;83). It seems to have persuaded the inquisitors that he had returned to his previous errors.<br>
<br>Archbishop Abbot, in a letter to Sir Thomas Roe, the British ambassador in Constantinople, described de Dominis in November 1622 as a <i>bestaccio</i> (little beast) who had never thanked his British hosts for their generosity and hospitality. Thomas Middleton's play of 1624, <span class="italic">A Game of Chess</span>, represented de Dominis as a fat bishop, worldly, proud, and gullible, who fell victim to the machinations of the black knight (the Spanish ambassador Gondomar) to return him to the kingdom of darkness. Bishop Richard Neile, who published a collection of official documents concerning de Dominis's departure, called him, in the subtitle of the book, &#145;a man for many masters&#146;. Though attacked by Roman Catholic writers during his sojourn in England and by protestant writers after his return to the Roman obedience, he was a pioneer in the cause of reconciliation among Christians, a cause to which most of his contemporaries were unresponsive. His personal flaws&#151;including, according to many observers, avarice, overweening ambition, and arrogance&#151;also impeded the ecumenical project to which he was passionately committed. His major work, the <span class="italic">De republica ecclesiastica</span>, is a considerable achievement in the breadth of its subject matter and scholarship and in its provocative theological and historical arguments.<br>
