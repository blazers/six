<span class="headword">Maclagan,  Myrtle Ethel</span>  (1911&#150;1993), <span class="occ">cricketer and soldier</span>, was born on 2 April 1911 in Ambala, India, the elder daughter and second of four children of Robert Smeiton Maclagan (1860&#150;1931), army officer, and his wife, Beatrice Ethel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Duperier. She moved to Britain in 1919 and lived at Haileybury College, where her father became bursar following his retirement as a colonel in the Royal Engineers. The family had a long connection with the Indian army. Both her grandparents, Robert Maclagan and Henry William Duperier, were generals. Maclagan was also a cousin of Sir Charles Oman, the historian. She was educated at the Royal School, Bath, from 1922 to 1929, captaining and playing in numerous sports teams. She was the youngest and smallest pupil there, but this did not inhibit her in any way. In a school cricket match against Cheltenham Ladies' College she took five wickets in five successive balls. She also won the senior and middle school maths prizes and the knitting prize. In 1929 she went on to the Harcombe House Domestic Science College, where she won a first-class certificate with the Devon board.<br>
<br>In 1931 Maclagan went to the Colwall cricket week and took ten wickets for 22 runs in her first match. Two years later she played for England against the rest and was selected for the first women's cricket team to tour Australia and New Zealand in 1934&#150;5. On 7 January 1935 in Sydney she scored the very first women's test match century, reaching a total of 119. It was the second test of the series against Australia. During the first, in Brisbane the previous month, she had taken seven Australian wickets for just 11 runs, a record which stood until 1958. She also scored the first test match century in England, at Blackpool, when Australia made the return visit in 1937. She went on to become a legend of the game. In fourteen test matches she scored 1007 runs at an average of 41.9, and her 51 wickets came at a cost of 16.9 runs each. She became the first player to score 1000 runs and take 50 wickets in women's test match cricket. Also a brilliant fielder, she took twelve catches in tests. Although never happy in the role, she also captained England in two test matches in 1951, when Molly Hide was injured.<br>
<br>Maclagan's qualities were many but, as a batsman, she was a tower of strength and particularly difficult to dislodge. She saw it as her duty to be there when the first 50 of the innings was posted; in the twenty-five innings she played in test match cricket, she herself passed 50 eight times. She played her county cricket for Surrey, and was an imposing, perhaps daunting, figure. Her strength of character was exemplified when, at the age of fifty-two and having been retired from cricket for eleven years, she emerged to play for the combined services against the Australian touring side of 1963. It was, of course, no idle whim; Maclagan made 81 not out.<br>
<br>Maclagan, who had served in the ATS between 1939 and 1945, rejoined the army in 1951, and was appointed supervising officer for physical training, eastern command. In 1963 she was promoted major and stationed in Aldershot as inspector of physical training, Women's Royal Army Corps. She played hockey, cricket, tennis, squash, and badminton for the army. Army squash champion for six years, badminton champion for five, she captained the army and the combined services cricket elevens between 1952 and 1963.<br>
<br>In retirement Maclagan lived in Camberley, Surrey, and applied herself vigorously to her many hobbies, which included carpentry, metalwork, and gardening. Her way of life was spartan and she made no concession to age. She had a constant stream of visitors from all over the country and on her eightieth birthday so many people turned up to congratulate her that she had to make a speech from the top of a stepladder. This she announced with the blast of a whistle. She did not marry. She died of cancer at the Phylis Tuckwell Hospice, Farnham, Surrey, on 11 March 1993. There was a memorial service at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, on 22 April 1993.<br>
