<span class="headword">Parsons, Sir  John Herbert</span>  (1868&#150;1957), <span class="occ">ophthalmologist and physiologist</span>, was born in Bristol on 3 September 1868, the youngest of the five children of Isaac Jabez Parsons, grocer, and his wife, Mary Goodhind Webb. He was educated at Thomas Turner's private school, at Bristol grammar school, and at University College, Bristol, where he studied arts, science, and medicine. His entry into the college was aided by his gaining a Gilchrist scholarship and his medical studies by a Stewart scholarship, and he won the first entrance scholarship to Bristol Royal Infirmary. Parsons left Bristol in 1889 and pursued medicine further at University College, London, where he graduated BSc with honours in physiology (1890). He completed his medical course in St Bartholomew's Hospital, where he graduated MB in 1892. He thereupon returned to University College as Sharpey scholar and assistant and demonstrator in physiology to E. A. Schafer (later Sharpey-Schafer). He married in 1894 Jane Roberta (<i>d</i>. 1911), daughter of John Hendrie of Uddingston, Lanarkshire; a son and a daughter survived him.<br>
<br>Parsons settled in London, and after a short period in general practice in Finchley he found himself compelled to return to his initial interest in physiology; through this he took up ophthalmology and became a clinical assistant at Moorfields Eye Hospital. He qualified FRCS in 1900 and was elected pathological curator and librarian at Moorfields Hospital. In 1904 he was elected to the consulting surgical staff of that hospital and of University College Hospital, both of which he served throughout his working life; he was also for a time consulting surgeon to the Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street. At the same time he conducted a large ophthalmic practice at a house in Queen Anne Street.<br>
<br>Parsons's concern was the working of the eye and its behaviour in health and disease. After his own studies ceased he encouraged others to continue this work. His first book was a small manual, <span class="italic">Elementary Ophthalmic Optics</span> (1901), an attempt to impress on the student that it was wrong to test a patient's vision or examine him or her clinically without a thorough understanding of the optics of the methods he was using. Simultaneously he undertook research work on the physiology of the eye in the department of physiology of University College, beginning with the innervation of the pupil and the lacrimal gland. His fundamental work on the control of the intra-ocular pressure was summarized in his second book, <span class="italic">The Ocular Circulation</span> (1903). For these researches he obtained the degree of DSc (London, 1904). Thereafter Parsons turned his attention to ocular pathology, and from his laboratory at Moorfields he published a series of original papers; the whole subject was also correlated and integrated for the first time in his classical treatise, <span class="italic">The Pathology of the Eye</span> (4 vols., 1904&#150;8). With its appearance Parsons became a world authority and his hospital clinics a mecca for students from abroad. At the same time his maturing clinical experience was reflected in the appearance of a comprehensive and yet concise clinical textbook, <span class="italic">Diseases of the Eye</span>, which, soon after its appearance in 1907, became the most popular work of its type; it went through ten editions before passing to other editorial hands.<br>
<br>Parsons's interests then turned to the psychology of vision and perception; in this vast field his main thesis was that perceptive phenomena could be analysed only on a factual basis; that the only safe approach to their understanding was a materialistic one, through physiological experimentation; and that introspective psychology divorced from biology was dangerous. Endowed with untiring energy, unusually wide knowledge, critical ability, and scientific honesty, Parsons attained a unique place in the scientific world by the publication of four books on this wide subject. Two of them were classical, <span class="italic">An Introduction to the Study of Colour Vision</span> (1915) and <span class="italic">An Introduction to the Theory of Perception</span> (1927); and two of them were small and incidental, <span class="italic">Mind and the Nation: a Pr&eacute;cis of Applied Psychology</span> (1918) and <span class="italic">The Springs of Conduct</span> (1950)&#151;the latter being a summary of Parsons's neuro-psychological creed, written when he was eighty-two.<br>
<br>Parsons had wide interests in public, professional, and cultural life. He served on several government commissions, his greatest contribution in this respect being in the adequate lighting of factories, a subject gravely neglected at the time. During the thirty-one years of the activities of the departmental committee set up by the Home Office on factory lighting, he played a prominent part; and he was one of the founder members of the Illuminating Engineering Society, of which he was the first chairman of council, its president in 1924, and honorary member in 1943. In professional societies Parsons participated wholeheartedly. To the Ophthalmological Society of the United Kingdom, which he joined in 1900, he made some 140 contributions, and he was its president in 1925. He was president of the Royal Society of Medicine (1936&#150;8) and honorary fellow (1942).<br>
<br>Parsons also took a prominent part in international ophthalmology, directing his influence towards the resumption of friendly relations between ophthalmologists throughout the world after the First World War. He helped to create the International Council of Ophthalmology (1927) and to arrange the very successful 13th International Congress of Ophthalmology in Amsterdam (1929). He was chairman of the editorial committee of the <span class="italic">British Journal of Ophthalmology</span> from its foundation in 1917 to 1948. He was one of the founder members of the British Council of Ophthalmologists and was largely responsible for its substitution by the Faculty of Ophthalmologists to serve as the co-ordinating and academic custodian of the specialism. Of the greatest importance was his association with the Medical Research Council on which he served from 1929 to 1932; to his influence was largely due its efforts to maintain an interest in research in visual problems in the period between the two world wars. In the first of these he served initially with the rank of captain as ophthalmic surgeon to the 3rd London General Hospital, between 1916 and 1917; he then took the rank of colonel as ophthalmic consultant to the home forces between 1917 and 1918; and thereafter he served in an advisory capacity to the army, the navy, and the Royal Air Force. In 1919 he was appointed CBE, and he was knighted in 1922.<br>
<br>The Royal College of Surgeons invited Parsons to give the Arris and Gale lectures in 1903&#150;4; from the British Medical Association he received the Middlemore prize in 1904 and again in 1914. From the Ophthalmological Society he received the Nettleship gold medal (1907) and the Bowman lectureship (1925); from the Oxford Ophthalmological Congress he was awarded the Doyne medal (1919); and from the American Ophthalmological Society he was given the Howe medal (1936). He was made honorary DSc of his own university, Bristol, in 1925, and LLD at Edinburgh in 1927. In 1921 he was elected FRS, and he served on the society's council in 1926&#150;7 and 1941&#150;3, and became a vice-president in 1941&#150;2. On his eightieth birthday he was presented with his portrait, painted by John Gilroy, by the Faculty of Ophthalmologists and the Ophthalmological Society; and the same occasion was marked by the appearance of a special number of the <span class="italic">British Journal of Ophthalmology</span> consisting of contributions made by his scientific and clinical pupils and associates.<br>
<br>Parsons's life was full of work, but he also enjoyed leisure. He appreciated good company and was a delightful host, particularly to the young, on whom he lavished much kindness, assisting them freely in their work and professional troubles. He had a great appreciation of music and used to go to the opera armed with a score. His knowledge of languages was wide and Persian literature and art interested him greatly. Golf was an absorbing hobby most of his life and he enjoyed periodic holiday cruises.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of war in 1939 Parsons left London and retired from practice, lending his London house to the French Red Cross. He went to live in Leeds with long-standing friends, though he visited London frequently. In his later years progressive deafness, an annoying tremor, and cardiac troubles&#151;disabilities exasperating to a nature so forceful and active&#151;gradually curtailed his activities. He died in University College Hospital, Grafton Way, London, on 7 October 1957.<br>
