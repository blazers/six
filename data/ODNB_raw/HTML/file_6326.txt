<span class="headword">Corner,  Julia</span>  (1798&#150;1875), <span class="occ">children's writer</span>, was born in London, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6325/', "John Corner (fl. 1788&#150;1825)")</script>, a printmaker. Her first publication was a silver fork novel, <span class="italic">The Baronet</span> (1834), a rather uneven production in which a sprightly narrative is oddly interrupted by a dream-like murder scene. She continued to produce occasional novels throughout her literary career, including <span class="italic">The Brothers Basset</span> (1855) and <span class="italic">Culverley Rise: a Tale</span> (1861), both workmanlike productions of mid-nineteenth-century domestic realism.<br>
<br>Corner was, however, far more significant as the writer of history textbooks. In 1837, she produced a sequel to Richmal Mangnall's popular <span class="italic">Historical and Miscellaneous Questions</span> (1800), entitled <span class="italic">Questions on the History of Europe</span>. Then, in 1840, she published <span class="italic">The History of England</span> and <span class="italic">The History of France</span>, with Thomas Dean &amp; Son, well-known publishers of juvenile works. These were the first volumes in a series known as <span class="roman">Miss Corner's Historical Library</span> (1840&#150;48), which covered the history of European countries as far apart as Ireland and Turkey; some were illustrated from designs by Sir John Gilbert (1817&#150;1897), a painter and illustrator as prolific in his production of historical images as Corner was of historical texts. Some volumes of the <span class="roman">Historical Library</span> were later reprinted as <span class="italic">Every Child's History</span>. The English volume in the series is a brisk, largely conventional narrative, although Corner was less credulous of traditional historical anecdotes and gave more space to social history than many contemporary textbook writers; the foreign volumes were more conservative in these respects. In 1850, a singularly productive year, Corner published (with Dean &amp; Son) accounts for young children of the ancient Britons, Saxons, and Normans, followed by descriptions of England in the middle ages, the sixteenth and seventeenth, and eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. With Henry Bohn, she published <span class="italic">China</span> (1853) and <span class="italic">India</span> (1854).<br>
<br>Corner's other educational works for children included <span class="italic">The Picture Nursery Sunday-Book</span> (1852), <span class="italic">Merry Multiplication</span> (1867), and <span class="italic">The Play Grammar</span> (1848), the last of which was an admirably lucid (if rather challenging) guide to parsing. She also produced revised versions of historical textbooks by other authors, including Anne Rodwell's <span class="italic">A Child's First Step to the History of England</span> in 1853. But Corner also published lighter works, contributing in 1854 five or six tales to Dean's series of <span class="roman">Simple Tales and Little Stories</span>, including <span class="italic">Rose and her Bird</span> and <span class="italic">The Good Children</span>. In addition, she wrote many short plays for children, based on fairy stories and published in Dean's series of <span class="roman">Little Plays for Little People</span>. In the Preface to <span class="italic">The Little Play of Mother Goose</span> (1854), she claimed to have been inspired by seeing some children amusing themselves and their elders at Christmas by this &#145;innocent and lively recreation&#146;. Conscious that some parents would object to home theatricals, she argued that amusement was an essential part of education and could be used to teach useful and moral lessons.<br>
<br>Julia Corner died unmarried, at her home, 92 Clarendon Road, Notting Hill, London, on 16 August 1875. Although well received by contemporaries, her publications brought her no lasting reputation; Allibone's <span class="italic">Critical Dictionary</span>, however, described her as &#145;one of the most useful writers of the age&#146;  (1.430).<br>
