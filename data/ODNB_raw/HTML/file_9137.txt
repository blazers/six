<span class="headword">Fane,  John</span>, eleventh earl of Westmorland <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Lord Burghersh]</span>  (1784&#150;1859), <span class="occ">diplomatist and composer</span>, was born on 2 or 3 February 1784 at 4 Sackville Street, Piccadilly, London, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9136/', "John Fane, tenth earl of Westmorland (1759&#150;1841)")</script>, and his first wife, Sarah Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Child (1764&#150;1793). He was known as Lord Burghersh until succeeding his father as eleventh earl in December 1841. He was educated at Harrow School and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he took his MA in 1808. In 1806 he was returned as MP for Lyme Regis on his family interest, and he retained the seat until his resignation in 1816. He demonstrated few political convictions, and generally voted in support of the government, of which his father was a member. His attempt in 1832 to regain the seat as a tory was unsuccessful. In June 1811 he married Lady Priscilla Anne Wellesley-Pole (1793&#150;1879), daughter of the third earl of Mornington [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9140/', "Fane, Priscilla Anne")</script>]; her uncles were to become the Marquess Wellesley and the duke of Wellington.<br>
<br>Burghersh's first career was as a soldier. He became a lieutenant in the Northamptonshire militia in 1803, but soon joined the 11th foot as an ensign. He served in several regiments before being appointed aide-de-camp to Lieutenant-General George Don in the expedition to Hanover. In 1806&#150;7 he served in Sicily and Egypt as assistant adjutant-general, and took part in the two attacks on Rosetta. In 1808 he joined the army in Portugal, where he took part in the battles of Roli&ccedil;a and Vimeiro, and the following year he was aide-de-camp to Sir Arthur Wellesley (later duke of Wellington); he served at the battles of Talavera and Busaco, and in the retreat to Torres Vedras. An attempt by his father to secure Burghersh's rapid promotion through the use of his influence and contrary to regulations was foiled by a motion in the House of Commons in May 1809. In 1813 he was accredited military commissioner to the headquarters of the allied armies in Europe, and he was present during the 1814 campaign in France until the capture of Paris. He was promoted major-general in 1838, and general in 1854. He published two volumes of memoirs of the campaigns in which he had been involved.<br>
<br>In August 1814 Burghersh took up a diplomatic career and went to Florence as envoy-extraordinary and minister-plenipotentiary; he remained in Italy until 1830, serving in the same capacity at Parma, Lucca, and Modena from 1818. In 1815 he took part in the campaign against Naples, and was one of the signatories to the convention of Caza Lanza, which restored the kingdom of Naples to the Bourbons. His appointment as envoy-extraordinary to Naples in 1830 was revoked, and his diplomatic career languished during the whig ministries of the 1830s. On the formation of the Conservative government in 1841, he was appointed minister at Berlin, to the chagrin of the previous incumbent, Lord William Russell, who called him &#145;that great fool&#146;, and recorded, perhaps with truth, that &#145;Lady Burghersh made the Duke of Wellington ask for Berlin for Burghersh, he being ruined and in immediate want of money&#146;  (Blakiston, 454). Burghersh none the less retained his office in Berlin for a decade, during which time he acted as a mediator in the Schleswig-Holstein question, and was a signatory to the peace treaty of 1850. In 1851 he was sent as ambassador to Vienna, where his time was principally occupied with negotiations concerning the imminent Crimean War, but he did not enjoy much confidence from his own government: Lord Clarendon called him &#145;our faithful but feeble Westmorland&#146;  (Conacher, 193). He participated, with Lord John Russell, in the Congress of Vienna of 1855, and retired from the diplomatic service on a pension in November of that year. His final public duty was to convey the queen's official congratulations to her uncle Leopold of the Belgians on the twenty-fifth anniversary of his succession.<br>
<br>Westmorland was one of the most influential amateur musicians of his day. He was an accomplished violinist and a prolific composer, and had studied music under Charles Hague at Cambridge. He held firmly to a belief in the inferiority of all musical styles to the Italian, and his compositions were entirely unoriginal. They included seven operas, composed between 1821 and 1849 (most of them first performed at his own residence in Florence), three symphonies, and a number of choral works. His greatest importance was as the founder of the Royal Academy of Music in 1823. It was largely through Burghersh's efforts at fund-raising and lobbying that Britain's first conservatory of music came into existence, and, despite conflicts with the professorial staff caused by his authoritarian and dictatorial behaviour&#151;he insisted on restricting the programmes of the academy's concerts to Italian music and his own compositions&#151;it was largely through his support that it survived the precarious early years of its existence.<br>
<br>Westmorland died at the country home to which he had retired, Apethorpe House, Wansford, Northamptonshire, on 16 October 1859, and was buried at Apethorpe. He was survived by his wife, one of their two daughters, and two of their five sons. His fourth son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9132/', "Francis William Henry Fane")</script>, succeeded him as twelfth earl, and his youngest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9138/', "Julian Henry Charles Fane")</script>, followed him into the diplomatic service. His daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55695/', "Lady Rose Weigall")</script>, edited his correspondence in 1912.<br>
