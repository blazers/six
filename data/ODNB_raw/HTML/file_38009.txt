<span class="headword">Stillman <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Spartali]</span>,  Marie</span>  (1844&#150;1927), <span class="occ">painter and artist's model</span>, was born in Hornsey, near London, on 10 March 1844, the eldest of the three children of Michael Spartali, merchant and later Greek consul-general in London, and his wife, Euphrosyne Varsini. Shortly after her birth the family moved to Clapham, Surrey, where she was educated at home, languages and artistic subjects being her main interests. Showing an early talent for painting and drawing, she became in 1864 the pupil of the Pre-Raphaelite painter Ford Madox Brown, who was numbered among the family's wide acquaintance of artists, writers, and musicians. Brown remained her adviser for over a decade, although she also sought occasional guidance from the painter Edward Burne-Jones.<br>
<br>Spartali made her exhibition d&eacute;but in 1867 at the Dudley Gallery, London, with three watercolours of female figures drawn from various sources, including Edmund Spenser (<span class="italic">The Lady Prays Desire</span>) and classical history (<span class="italic">Corinna</span>). Keeping to watercolours, she rapidly expanded her exhibitions to include the Royal Academy (from 1870), Liverpool, Birmingham, and Manchester, and minor London shows. She was also invited to show at the Grosvenor Gallery, London, from 1879. Acclaimed in 1871 as a follower of Pre-Raphaelitism by the school's chief commentator, W. M. Rossetti, she became recognized during the 1870s as one of those artists following in the footsteps of D. G. Rossetti and, later, as an admirer of Burne-Jones. She also became a celebrated beauty after posing for the photographer Julia Margaret Cameron and the painters Brown, Rossetti, Burne-Jones, and Val Prinsep.<br>
<br>On 10 April 1871 Spartali married the American journalist and painter William James Stillman (1828/9&#150;1901), a widower and father, by his first wife, of two daughters and a son (<i>d</i>. 1874). The match was against her father's wishes and caused considerable family conflict. A daughter, Euphrosyne, was born in 1872 and a son, Michael, in 1878; a third child died shortly after birth. The Stillmans moved to Florence in 1878; Marie Stillman continued to send work regularly to exhibitions in Britain and the USA, where her first appearance in 1875 had drawn favourable notice from the novelist and art critic Henry James. Her subject matter became increasingly Italianate, often drawn from Dante and Boccaccio.<br>
<br>For health reasons Marie Stillman returned to England in 1883, staying in the Isle of Wight and London, but her husband's appointment in 1886 as Italian and Greek correspondent for <span class="italic">The Times</span> drew her back to Italy, where she lived in Rome until 1898. On returning once more to England the artist and her family settled in Surrey, where her husband died in 1901. From 1898 she exhibited only sporadically, mostly at the New Gallery, London. Her range of subjects expanded to include landscape, religious narratives, and flower painting. In 1900 she met the American collector Samuel Bancroft, who became her most consistent patron. She had solo exhibitions in the USA in 1903 in Boston, and in 1908 in New York. Her last major work was painted in 1914, though she continued to paint regularly until her death.<br>
<br>Marie Stillman was credited by her friends not only with great beauty but also with a generous and amiable disposition. Brought up in a wealthy home, she had to supplement her husband's erratic income during their married life through her painting, though her sales were always irregular. Her stepgranddaughter recalled her ceaseless industry as an artist, as well as her &#145;Greek rages&#146; and her enduring appeal to men. One of a group of women seen in their own lifetimes as emblems of Pre-Raphaelitism, she made a considerable executive contribution to this important British art movement, and was recognized at her death as the last surviving link with it. She died on 6 March 1927 at her home, 19 Ashburn Place, Cromwell Road, Kensington, London. Her work is represented in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, the Delaware Art Museum, the Richard F. Brush Art Gallery, New York, the National Trust collection and the Lloyd-Webber collection.<br>
