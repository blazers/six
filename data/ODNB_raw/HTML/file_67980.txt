<span class="headword">Tyler,  John</span>  (1640&#150;1724), <span class="occ">bishop of Llandaff</span>, was born in Westhide, Herefordshire, on 16 August 1640, according to his memorial in Hereford Cathedral, the son of John Tyler of Kington, Herefordshire. He had at least two brothers and one sister. He was apparently educated at Lady Hawkins's School, Kington, as a John Tyler appears in the visitation lists there for 1648, 1649, and 1650. He was not the John Tyler who was rector of Shobden, Herefordshire, from 1664 to his death in 1696, but may have been rector of Letton Cheney, Dorset, from 1680 to 1690. He married Sarah, daughter of John Scudamore, of Trecelly, Herefordshire, and Dorothy, daughter of Sir William Cooke, of Highnam, Gloucestershire, but the date of their marriage is not known; they appear to have had no children. He was created BA and MA from Magdalen College, Oxford, by decree on 14 April 1686, and proceeded BD on 15 May 1686. He held the living of Kentchurch, Herefordshire, until 1688, possibly in the gift of the Scudamore family. He was made a canon of Hereford in 1688, and became vicar of Brinsop, Herefordshire, in 1689 and vicar of St Peter's, Hereford, in 1690. He was also a chaplain-in-ordinary to William and Mary. He was installed as dean of Hereford on 27 September 1692, a position he continued to hold until his death, even after his elevation to the episcopal bench. He was elected to the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK) on 3 February 1700.<br>
<br>Tyler was consecrated as bishop of Llandaff on 30 June 1706, describing his new see in September 1706 as &#145;one of the poorest bishoprics in Christendom&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Diaries of William Nicolson</span>, 54), it being worth about &pound;300 p.a. He took the oaths of allegiance and supremacy on 3 December 1706 and preached &#145;a very good&#146; sermon to the House of Lords on 30 January 1707  (ibid., p. 413). He was created DD by diploma on 25 June 1707. His visitation of the diocese that year saw him distribute books sent to him by the SPCK. He supported the extension of Thomas Bray's parochial library scheme to the diocese, initially recommending that a library be established in Cardiff, but after consulting his clergy and leading laymen he instead decided upon Cowbridge, where a library was established in 1711.<br>
<br>Tyler also involved himself in national politics. By 1708 he was living in a house in Crutched Friars in London. He seems to have been a moderate whig churchman, supporting an amendment to the <span class="roman">General Naturalization Bill</span> in March 1709 which made the taking of communion in a parochial church rather than a reformed congregation a necessary condition for using the act. However, with the advent of a tory ministry under Robert Harley in 1710 his political position became more overtly whig. Harley thought him unlikely to support the ministry in an analysis made in early October 1710 and Tyler voted against the earl of Peterborough in January 1711 when the verdict on his conduct of the war in Spain became a trial of strength between his tory supporters and the whigs. He was seen by Harley, by then earl of Oxford, as an opponent of the court in the spring of 1713, and he voted against the French commercial treaty in June 1713. In the 1714 parliament he opposed the high-church <span class="roman">Schism Bill</span>. That year he obtained an act of parliament annexing the treasurership of Llandaff Cathedral to the bishopric from its next vacancy, raising the episcopal revenue by &pound;12 2<i>s</i>. 10<i>d</i>. per annum.<br>
<br>Following the Hanoverian succession Tyler voted against the earl of Oxford when the latter was impeached by the whig ministry in June 1717. He opposed the repeal of the <span class="roman">Occasional Conformity and Schism Acts</span> in December 1718. In 1721, after much criticism from Browne Willis, who accused him of neglecting the fabric of the cathedral, Tyler wrote to William Wake, archbishop of Canterbury, explaining that the diocese and the chapter did not have the revenue to repair it. He supported the petitions by the chapter to George I, the prince of Wales, and the nobility and gentry of the diocese that year for funds to repair the cathedral, but was too infirm to present the petitions in person. The king gave &pound;1000.<br>
<br>Tyler died on 8 July 1724 at &#145;a very advanced age&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 242), and was buried in Hereford Cathedral. His wife was still alive in June 1726 when the SPCK agreed to send her a copy of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> in Arabic which her husband had subscribed to, but she died on 10 November 1726. Tyler's will bequeathed his lands in Radnorshire, Herefordshire, and Monmouthshire to John Tyler, the son of his nephew William Tyler. His stock in the Bank of England and South Sea Company was to be used to fund legacies to a host of relatives, many of them clerics. He also left &pound;100 to the school he established in Hereford for the benefit of the poor.<br>
