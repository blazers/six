<span class="headword">Nicholson,  Norman Cornthwaite</span>  (1914&#150;1987), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 8 January 1914 at 14 St George's Terrace, Millom, Cumberland, the only child of Joseph Nicholson, tailor and draper, of Millom, and his wife, Edith Cornthwaite, the daughter of a butcher. His mother died when he was five, and his father remarried three years later. He was educated at Millom secondary school, but in his adolescence he developed tuberculosis and from 1930 to 1932 was confined to hospital in Hampshire. One of his lungs was removed. This was the only period in his life when he spent any considerable time away from his native and ancestral Millom, the source of much of his inspiration both in verse and prose.<br>
<br>Nicholson began writing at an early age. He was encouraged in this by a local clergyman, the Revd Samuel Taylor, who put him in touch with Brother George Every, a poet, literary critic, and theologian, and a contributor to <span class="italic">The Criterion</span>; through Every, Nicholson was introduced in 1938 to the editor of that journal, T. S. Eliot, who showed an interest in his poems. In the same year, Nicholson began to give lectures on literature to local Workers' Educational Association classes, material from which he used in his first critical book, <span class="italic">Man and Literature</span> (1943); but already, in 1942, he had edited a Penguin <span class="italic">Anthology of Religious Verse</span>, and before that had started to publish poems in periodicals, including some in the United States.<br>
<br>Nicholson's upbringing was in the Methodist church, to which his stepmother belonged, but in 1940 he was confirmed in the Church of England. His Christian faith was central to him throughout his life. Much of his poetry and his verse-plays drew on this faith, nourished by his devotion to the landscapes, history, people, and stories of Cumberland. All are abundantly present in his first individual volume of poems, <span class="italic">Five Rivers</span>, which Eliot accepted for Faber and Faber and which was published in 1944. This had been preceded in 1943 by a selection of his work published in one volume alongside selections from Keith Douglas and J. C. Hall. Nicholson went on to publish another ten books and pamphlets of poems, including <span class="italic">Selected Poems</span> in 1966, augmented in 1982. All were well received, as authentic and sometimes gently quirky products of a life which, though restricted by Nicholson's fragile health (&#145;My ways are circumscribed&#146;, he wrote in the poem &#145;The Pot Geranium&#146;), had broader visions of a universe of rock, rivers, hills, and the sea.<br>
<br>In appearance Nicholson was craggy, and he became increasingly bewhiskered with impressive sideburns. He had a fine head, brightly flashing and mischievous eyes, and an engaging and often roguish smile. His voice, as a result of lung operations, was hoarse but also strikingly vigorous: he was a splendid reader not only of his own poems but of other poets too, especially his beloved Wordsworth, parts of whose <span class="italic">Prelude</span> he read in a memorable series of BBC Third Programme broadcasts in the early 1960s. He was a much sought-after reader at literary gatherings up and down the country and, though these expeditions often exhausted him, he enjoyed them.<br>
<br>In 1956 Nicholson married a teacher, Yvonne Edith, daughter of John Oswald Gardner, engineering draughtsman. The partnership was a very happy one until her death in 1982. Her loss left him desolate; and, much though he enjoyed the literary recognition and honours which increasingly came to him in his later years, they could not compensate for her absence. They had lived cheerfully in the small terraced house in Millom which had always been Nicholson's home (indeed, he had been born there, when it was also his father's shop), and he continued to live there after Yvonne's death. They had no children.<br>
<br>Nicholson was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1945, and that year was given the Heinemann award. In 1967 he shared the Cholmondeley award for poetry with Seamus Heaney and Brian Jones. He received a Society of Authors travelling bursary in 1973 (spent visiting Scandinavia) and an Arts Council bursary in 1977, which was also the year he was awarded the queen's medal for poetry. He received the honorary degree of MA from the University of Manchester in 1959 and another from the Open University in 1975. Manchester Polytechnic conferred on him an honorary fellowship in 1979, and he received a LittD from the universities of Liverpool (1980) and Manchester (1984). One of his most treasured honours, which he delighted in showing to visitors, was the OBE, conferred in 1981. Perhaps even more, he was deeply moved by a volume of poems and prose pieces by many distinguished writers, <span class="italic">Between Comets</span> (edited by William Scammell), published and presented to him on his seventieth birthday in 1984.<br>
<br>Among Nicholson's many other publications were books and anthologies concerned with the history and topography of the Lake District, four verse-plays, two early novels, and a life of William Cowper (1951). The most individual and revealing of all is <span class="italic">Wednesday Early Closing</span> (1975), a memoir of his early years, full of the characters, anecdotes, sights, sounds, and smells of his Millom boyhood. He died on 30 May 1987 at Whitehaven, Cumberland.<br>
