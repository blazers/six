<span class="headword">Baker,  Geoffrey  le</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1326&#150;1358), <span class="occ">chronicler</span>, was born in Swinbrook in Oxfordshire. He is noteworthy as the author of two chronicles. The smaller of these, the <span class="italic">Chroniculum</span>, begins <i>in primordio temporis</i> and ends on 20 July 1347, with a colophon revealing Baker's name and Osney as the place where he concluded the lesser work. Stow thought that he was a canon regular, but Baker terms himself <i>clericus</i>, so he was probably an unbeneficed clerk, untraced as yet in ordination lists. He is identifiable as the &#145;Geoffrey Pachon of Swynebrook, chaplain&#146;, one of the malefactors pardoned by Edward II in 1326 on condition that they aided him against the incursion of his queen, Isabella. Baker states that he wrote at the behest of Thomas de la More, knight, who also features in the larger chronicle. Significantly, in view of Baker's political views, the <span class="italic">Chroniculum</span> is objective, with no derogatory comments about Bishop Adam Orleton or Isabella, <i>nobilissima regina Anglie</i>.<br>
<br>The larger (anonymous) <span class="italic">Chronicon</span> extends from 1303 until 1356, its final words indicating that the author remained alive in 1358. The structure is based on Adam Murimuth's recension of 1341, but whereas the latter is laconic and circumspect, Baker is expansive and opinionated. The basis of E. M. Thompson's edition is provided by items 10 and 11 in the late fourteenth-century Bodl. Oxf., MS Bodley 761, folios 99<i>r</i>&#150;145<i>v</i>, 149<i>r</i>&#150;156<i>v</i>, a miscellany which belonged to Thomas Walmesford, or to someone else close to the Bohun family, lords of Chadlington hundred in which Swinbrook lay. Thompson considered that the chronicles were not Baker's autograph but the work of an uncritical copyist using an unrevised text. There are, for instance, two consecutive versions of the early years of Edward III's reign, the second of which appears in the charred BL, Cotton MS Appendix lii&#151;also late fourteenth-century&#151;the vestige of a copy of the <span class="italic">Chronicon</span> confined to that reign. Elizabethan transcripts of the <span class="italic">Vita et mors Edwardi secundi</span>&#151;that part of Baker's chronicle covering Edward II's reign&#151;fostered the belief that behind the Latin text lay a French original by Sir Thomas de la More, an idea countenanced by Stubbs. But Thompson concluded that More was responsible merely for a specific passage, his eyewitness account of the renunciation of homage to Edward II at Kenilworth.<br>
<br>In the <span class="italic">Chronicon</span> before 1328 Baker interpolates into Murimuth's narrative passages designed to place the responsibility for Edward II's abdication and death upon Orleton, Bishop Henry Burghersh of Lincoln (<i>d</i>. 1340), and, under their tutelage, the queen. He regards Isabella's journey to France in 1325, the dispatch of her son to perform homage to Charles IV of France, her invasion, and Edward's murder as elements in a preconceived plan of which Orleton is the principal architect. John Stratford, More's kinsman, who was then bishop of Winchester and later became archbishop of Canterbury, escapes criticism, and Murimuth's subsequent account of the crisis of 1341 is omitted. Mortimer attracts no opprobrium until the Scottish treaty of 1328, while Earl Humphrey (VII) de Bohun is lauded, despite being a rebel who died ignominiously at Boroughbridge in 1322. Edward himself is <i>generosus dominus</i> and <i>amicicie cultor fidelissimus</i>. His queen exhibited &#145;feminine characteristics&#146; of <i>rapidissima ira</i> and <i>avaricia insaciabilis vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the Despensers, and acted towards her imprisoned husband as an iron lady (<i>ferrea virago</i>). In short, this part of the chronicle apportions blame for Edward II's fate. It has affinities with the attack on Orleton at the time of his promotion to Winchester in 1333, reading like a counterblast to Robert Reading's virulent condemnation of Edward's rule&#151;a <i>pi&egrave;ce justificative</i> for that of Isabella and Mortimer.<br>
<br>The editor of Orleton's Hereford register sought to interpret &#145;de la More's <span class="italic">Vita et mors</span>&#146; as a riposte to the <span class="italic">Libellus famosus</span> of 1341&#151;a tract directed against Stratford and attributed by some to Orleton. The content of the <span class="italic">Libellus</span> militates against this. Baker himself claims that the circumstances of Edward's captivity were revealed to him by William Bishop after the black death (1348&#150;9) and Thompson believed that the chronicle (as it has survived) was not begun until after 1341, the concluding date of Murimuth's text. But this would not preclude the possibility that Baker incorporated material he had prepared earlier. William Bishop is not identifiable with certainty, although there was a king's serjeant of that name, also a man in Mortimer's retinue pardoned in 1321 for attacking the Despenser lands. In view of More's authenticity, the attribution cannot be readily dismissed. At the same time it is clear that Baker's &#145;passion of Edward of Caernarfon&#146;&#151;the former king's mistreatment in captivity&#151;owes much to his inventiveness, as, probably, does the deathbed scene in Berkeley Castle, while Orleton's responsibility for ordering Edward's killing is a gratuitous invention.<br>
<br>Baker's account of Bannockburn (1314), derived from a Carmelite source, is particularly informative, but popular jingoism impairs his treatment of the Scottish treaty of 1328. Following Edward III's assumption of personal rule in 1330, the chronicler, saving a final barb against Orleton, rarely betrays political animus. Indeed, with certain notable exceptions, such as the black death and the inauguration of the Order of the Garter, he has comparatively little to say about domestic events. The Scottish conflict is well reported and there is an independent description of the battle of Halidon Hill (1333). Predominant, however, is his treatment of the Hundred Years' War, about which he is remarkably well informed, despite occasional confusion of dates and a penchant for anti-French gossip. Clearly he had access to eyewitness reports, newsletters, and official documents. The naval engagement of Sluys (1340) is detailed, even to the names of the recaptured English ships. There is a lengthy description of Edward's campaign of 1346&#150;7, concluding with the battle of Cr&eacute;cy and the capture of Calais, while the text of the truce that followed in 1347 is methodically itemized. Baker names the bishops of London and Norwich, Ralph Stratford and John (<i>recte</i> William) Bateman, as royal candidates for the cardinalate in 1350, emphasizing papal partiality in the elevation of eleven Frenchmen. The <i>chevauch&eacute;e</i> of Edward, the Black Prince, from Bordeaux to Narbonne is reliably plotted between 5 October and 2 December 1355, and Baker's description of the prince's subsequent campaign, culminating in the battle of Poitiers (1356), which concludes the chronicle, is indispensable and preferable to that of Froissart. Despite Thompson's excellent notes, the value of the <span class="italic">Chronicon</span> for the period 1330&#150;56 continues to be underestimated. Stow translated lengthy passages for his <span class="italic">Annales</span> (1601, 1605), thus first introducing Baker to a wider audience.<br>
