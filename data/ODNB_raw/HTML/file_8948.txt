<span class="headword">Evans,  Daniel</span>  (1774&#150;1835), <span class="occ">Independent minister</span>, was born at Maindala, Eglwyswrw, Pembrokeshire, on 16 January 1774. As a youth he received little education and was apprenticed as a tailor. He frequently attended prayer meetings in private houses and, at the age of fifteen, became a member of the Independent church. Soon afterwards, in 1792, he began preaching with great enthusiasm from house to house. He thus trained himself for his future work, and became very successful as a missionary. His first settlement was at Llanwrtyd, Brecknockshire, as co-pastor with the Revd Isaac Price, from 1796 to 1799. In 1799 he accepted a call to Bangor, where his congregation had but twenty-five members, who were unable to pay him a sufficient wage. Supported partially by his own private means, he worked extremely hard and succeeded in enlarging his own congregation, as well as establishing seven new ones in the immediate neighbourhood, and extending his ministry as far as the Conwy valley. In 1808 he moved to Mynydd-bach, near Swansea, where he was again exceptionally successful. During a period of only six months, in 1828&#150;9, he added no fewer than 650 to the membership of his churches and Mynydd-bach became the mother church of a cluster of Independent chapels in a district extending over much of the Swansea valley and Swansea itself.<br>
<br>Evans's published works, which were all in Welsh, included several biographies and religious commentaries, and a volume of sermons published posthumously. He died at Mynydd-bach on 3 March 1835.<br>
