<span class="headword">Moule,  Handley Carr Glyn</span>  (1841&#150;1920), <span class="occ">bishop of Durham</span>, was born at Fordington, Dorchester, Dorset, on 23 December 1841. His parents were the classicist and inventor the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19426/', "Revd Henry Moule (1801&#150;1880)")</script> and Mary Mullett Evans (1801&#150;1877); they had a family of eight sons, one of whom died in infancy. The seven brothers, as they were known, were taught at home by their father; one committed suicide, one became a missionary (<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56160/', "Arthur Evans Moule")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35128/', "Moule, George Evans")</script>]), and two became bishops [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35128/', "Moule, George Evans")</script>]. Handley, the eighth and youngest son, was named after his godfathers, Augustus Handley and Carr John Glyn. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1860, and for his first year his tutor was J. B. Lightfoot. Moule had a brilliant university career and became a noted classicist, winning numerous academic prizes. He graduated BA (first class) in 1864 and MA in 1867. He took up a college fellowship and became an assistant master at Marlborough College before he was ordained deacon in 1867 and priest in 1868. Between 1867 and 1872 he was his father's curate, then for five years dean of Trinity College, Cambridge. On his mother's death he returned to Fordington as his father's curate and remained there until Henry Moule died. On 16 August 1881 Moule married Harriot Mary (1844&#150;1915), daughter of the Revd Charles Boileau Elliott; they had two daughters. Though he came from an evangelical home, and was strongly influenced by his mother's faith, Moule did not experience an evangelical conversion until 1866. He later said, &#145;I am an Evangelical churchman &hellip; and of those convictions I am not at all ashamed&#146;  (<span class="italic">To my Younger Brethren</span>, 1892, 254). In 1884 he had another profound religious experience, after which he became thoroughly identified with the Holiness Movement, speaking at the Mildmay conferences and the Keswick Convention, which he considered to be &#145;the vestibule of heaven&#146;  (Harford and Macdonald, 131).<br>
<br>From 1880 Moule was the first principal of Ridley Hall, Cambridge, lecturer at Holy Trinity Church, and an examining chaplain to Bishop J. C. Ryle. As a preacher and teacher Moule exercised an immense influence over undergraduates and theological students and played an important part in making the evangelical party more pietistic and missionary minded. During Moule's principalship more than 500 men were ordained, of whom more than 100 became missionaries and 23 bishops. It was said that Ridley Hall men were pious but not learned. They may have been well taught, but Moule failed to tackle current critical issues. He was an inspiring writer and maintained a steady output of publications, which included devotional writings, biblical expositions, sermons, poems, and tracts. He achieved further academic success in gaining a BD in 1894 (this thesis was expanded and published as <span class="italic">Romans</span> in the <span class="roman">Expositor's Bible</span> series) and a DD in 1895 for his edition of Bishop Ridley's work <span class="italic">A Brief Declaration of the Lord's Supper</span>. Moule became well known outside Cambridge as a respected evangelical leader, and was in demand as a preacher and speaker. He became a chaplain to Queen Victoria and then to Edward VII. In 1899 Moule was appointed Norrisan professor of divinity at Cambridge, and he continued to have links with Ridley Hall as a council member and later as college visitor.<br>
<br>From 1901 Moule was bishop of Durham. He felt unworthy of following J. B. Lightfoot and B. F. Westcott, and his simple pietism and lack of judgement were severely criticized by his successor, who regarded Moule as a good Christian but a bad bishop. But Hensley Henson was too forthright in his condemnation. It is true that Moule found diocesan business tedious, being too timid in decision making and too ready to accept unsuitable candidates for ordination, but his humility, lack of guile, and godliness won the hearts of his clergy and people. As a bishop his priorities were spiritual and not administrative. He encouraged his clergy to be faithful in their devotions and to be powerful in the pulpit; to preach the good news but not to advocate political causes; to keep the Sabbath; and, like him, to become teetotal. Moule strongly supported mission at home and overseas and urged his clergy to follow his example. While Moule was not as politically astute as Westcott he was not uninformed, and spoke out on political and industrial issues. He believed in a just war, and spoke during the First World War on the &#145;holiness of patriotism&#146;, urging prayer for victory. Though he remained faithful to his evangelical convictions, he was not partisan; tolerant towards Anglo-Catholic practice, he was prepared to sanction the use of incense and the wearing of the alb at communion services.<br>
<br>In 1905 Moule had suffered a severe illness following the death of one of his daughters, and from the autumn of 1915 was away from his episcopal duties for almost a year after an operation and following the death of his devoted wife. He died of pleurisy at 13 Cranmer Road, Cambridge, on 8 May 1920, and was buried next to his wife, daughter, and brother in Bow cemetery, Durham.<br>
