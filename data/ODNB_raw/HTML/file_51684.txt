<span class="headword">Daly,  Ivan de Burgh</span>  (1893&#150;1974), <span class="occ">physiologist</span>, was born on 14 April 1893 at Pyrmont, 43 Brinswood Avenue, Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, the second son and third of the five children of James Thomas Daly (1853&#150;1928), seaman and engineer, and his second wife, Amy Pritchard. He was educated at Beech Lawn preparatory school, Leamington Spa (1903&#150;5), and at Rossall School, Lancashire (1906&#150;11), where he developed an interest in science and engineering and, encouraged by his father, considered becoming an engineer. Two serious illnesses, and acquaintance with an uncle in the medical profession, however, turned his thoughts towards a career in medicine. When he went to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in 1911 he read physiology, chemistry, and anatomy for the natural history tripos. He passed part one with first-class honours and gained an exhibition in 1914.<br>
<br>In the First World War Daly joined the Royal Army Medical Corps as a stretcher bearer, then worked for nine months at St Bartholomew's Hospital as a clinical clerk and surgical dresser. In 1915 he was commissioned as a flight lieutenant in the Royal Naval Air Service, and trained at Eastchurch, Kent, as a fighter pilot. He saw a brief period of active service in Belgium before being wounded, and returned to Eastchurch as a gunnery officer. He resigned his commission in February 1917 and completed his medical course at St Bartholomew's and graduated MB BCh (Cambridge) in August 1918. Assigned to the medical branch of the RAF he completed his three months as a house physician, during which time he worked under Dr John Drysdale and gained experience in electrocardiography.<br>
<br>Eager to pursue this line of research, Daly secured an appointment as assistant to Professor Ernest Henry Starling at University College, London, where he was principally engaged on cardiovascular researches. He was awarded a Beit memorial research fellowship for research in which the Fleming diode was used to investigate electrical changes in living tissue; his use of the thermionic valve to record the frog electrocardiogram was the first such application in England. The results were published by Daly and K. E. Shellshear in 1920. On 1 September of that year Daly married Beatrice Mary 
    (Molly; <i>b</i>. 1897/8)
  , daughter of Alfred Leetham of Shelley, Yorkshire. Their elder son, Michael de Burgh Daly (<i>b</i>. 1922), followed his father into a similar branch of the medical profession; the younger, Peter de Burgh Daly (1926&#150;1959), pursued a military career until his death in a helicopter accident.<br>
<br>Daly graduated MD in 1922. The Beit fellowship was extended in 1923 when he moved to the National School of Medicine at Cardiff. His success in the field of heart-lung preparations led to his appointment in 1927 to the chair of physiology at Birmingham University, where he enlarged the department to include animal physiology. He was also involved in planning the new medical school (which opened in 1938) during which time he went to look at medical schools in the United States. He moved to Edinburgh in 1933, taking over the chair in succession to the retiring incumbent, the eminent professor Sir Edward Sharpey-Sch&auml;fer. Daly's main interest was now the pulmonary and bronchial circulations which he had developed in his latter years at Birmingham. As the importance of his work gained recognition Daly received the degree of MD from Birmingham in 1928, was elected fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1934, Harvey and Hannah lecturer in the United States in 1936, and fellow of the Royal Society in 1943.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Daly collaborated with the RAF in experiments on the physiology of high-altitude flying and on poison gases. In 1942 he was seconded to direct the Medical Research Council physiological laboratory attached to the gunnery wing of the Armoured Fighting Vehicle Training School in Dorset, looking into the problems of gun fume poisoning. He returned to Edinburgh in 1945.<br>
<br>The Agricultural Research Council (ARC), deliberating on the best way forward in the post-war years, decided to establish an institute to undertake fundamental research on the physiology of the larger farm animals. Daly was offered the directorship in 1947, his first task being to find a site. His choice fell on the 450 acre Babraham Hall estate, near Cambridge. It was purchased by the ARC in 1948 and named the Institute of Animal Physiology, with the various necessary laboratories, animal accommodation, and housing being built up in successive years as the number of staff rose to 160 by 1956. Daly controlled the institute firmly, knowing precisely what he wanted it to achieve (in this he was not always in agreement with the ARC). However, having chosen his scientific staff with care he let them get on with their chosen work unhindered and was supportive, rather than directive. He meanwhile continued his own pulmonary and bronchial investigations, latterly assisted by his son. His success with heart-lung preparations, in which the greater and lesser circulations were separately maintained and controlled by two blood pumps, undoubtedly stimulated and influenced the later development of open heart surgery.<br>
<br>Daly was appointed CBE on his retirement in 1958, and in 1959 he was awarded the Baly medal of the Royal College of Physicians. He secured funding to continue his research in the physiology laboratory of the University of Oxford until 1965, after which he continued at his home, 25 High Street, Long Crendon, Aylesbury. He was on the editorial board of the <span class="italic">Quarterly Journal of Experimental Physiology</span> from 1935 to 1968, and with Catherine Hebb wrote <span class="italic">Bronchial and Pulmonary Vascular Systems</span> (1966). He died suddenly while writing at his desk on 8 February 1974.<br>
