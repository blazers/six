<span class="headword">Coleridge,  William Hart</span>  (1789&#150;1849), <span class="occ">bishop of Barbados and the Leeward Islands</span>, was the only son of Luke Herman Coleridge (brother of Samuel Taylor Coleridge) of Thorverton, Devon, and Sarah, his wife, third daughter of Richard Hart of Exeter. His father died during his infancy, and he was educated by his uncle, the Revd George Coleridge, master of the grammar school of Ottery St Mary. He entered as a commoner at Christ Church, Oxford, and graduated BA (on 21 November 1811), MA (on 1 June 1814), BD (on 17 June 1824), and DD (on 18 June 1824).<br>
<br>Soon after leaving Oxford (in 1811), Coleridge became a curate at St Andrew's, Holborn, in London, and afterwards he was secretary to the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge; he was also preacher at the National Society's chapel in Ely Place. On 25 July 1824 he was consecrated bishop of Barbados and the Leeward Islands at Lambeth. In 1825, he married Sarah Elizabeth, eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23371/', "Dr Thomas Rennell")</script>, dean of Winchester and master of the Temple; she was also a granddaughter of Sir William Blackstone, the judge. They had one son and one daughter, both of whom outlived him.<br>
<br>The diocese of Barbados was made up of the islands of the British West Indies with, in 1826, the addition of British Guiana. Coleridge arrived in Barbados in January 1825 and almost immediately set out on his first visit, travelling to Trinidad, Grenada, St Vincent, and St Lucia. He found the diocese in an unsatisfactory condition, judging that the number of clergymen and churches was insufficient, and that there were too few daily schools and Sunday schools. In his first charge (delivered in 1830) he felt able to congratulate the congregation on the improved spiritual condition of the black population who, he noted, had almost entirely abandoned traditional grieving customs such as lamenting the dead with loud cries and leaving food at burial sites.<br>
<br>During his episcopate Coleridge worked closely with the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. The society provided all the diocese's clergy and managed the slave-worked Codrington estates and Codrington College on Barbados itself. It had attracted some odium from British abolitionists for not being strenuously engaged in the abolition movement, though from 1830 it was proceeding towards gradual emancipation in the belief that<blockquote>as Trustees of the Codrington Estates [they] are able not only to suggest a course, but to make the trial themselves, for the satisfaction of others; and to shew the planters how they may gradually enfranchise their Slaves without destruction to their property. (Pascoe, 202)</blockquote>Coleridge seems to have been in full agreement with this course of action, for as he himself wrote:<blockquote>To prepare the minds of a mass of persons, so peculiarly situated, for a change such as this, was a work requiring the exercise of great patience and altogether of a most arduous nature. And it was chiefly owing to the Society of the Propagation of the Gospel that that day not only passed in peace, but was distinguished for the proper feeling that prevailed and its perfect order. (Pascoe, 203)</blockquote>In a charge delivered in July 1838, just before the legal emancipation of slaves in the West Indian colonies, he stated that the native population flocked to the churches and chapels, and were civil in their behaviour and decent in their appearance.<br>
<br>By the time of emancipation the number of communicants was unusually large, the number of diocescan clergy had risen to ninety-nine, and there were fifty-three parish churches and forty-two school houses. Of the many churches which had been damaged in the great hurricane which devastated Barbados on 11 August 1831, seven had been rebuilt, thanks partly to a parliamentary grant and partly to a grant of &pound;2000 from the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. Other institutions established or remodelled during Coleridge's episcopate included a diocesan committee of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, a clerical library, a branch association of the Negro Conversion Society, a &#145;daily meal&#146; society, a medical dispensary society, four friendly societies, an asylum for the &#145;coloured poor&#146;, and three societies for the education of the &#145;coloured poor&#146;. Soon after his arrival in the diocese Coleridge had also been engaged, together with the trustees, in the reorganization of Codrington College, Barbados.<br>
<br>In 1842, after about eighteen years' zealous labour, Coleridge was compelled to resign his see through the failure of his health. The large diocese was then divided, the three archdeaconries of Barbados, Antigua, and Guiana being erected into separate sees. On the establishment of St Augustine's Missionary College at Canterbury, Coleridge became the first warden. He held the office until his sudden death, caused by a rupture of a vessel of the heart on 21 December 1849, at his home, Salston, in Ottery St Mary.<br>
