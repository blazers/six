<span class="headword">Wigan,  Alfred Sydney</span>  (1814&#150;1878), <span class="occ">actor</span>, whose father, James Wigan, a teacher of languages, was at one time secretary to the Dramatic Authors' Society, was born at Blackheath, Kent, on 24 March 1814. The actor and playwright <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29364/', "Horace Wigan")</script> was his younger brother. His early career is obscure, his own accounts of it being contradictory. Since he exhibited some talent for music, he became &#145;a wandering minstrel&#146;, and sang at Ramsgate, Margate, and elsewhere. He was also an usher at a school and assisted his father at the Dramatic Authors' Society. Under the name of Sydney or Sidney he was in 1834 at the Lyceum, and the following year was under Louisa Cranstoun Nisbett at the Queen's Theatre, Tottenham Street. When John Braham opened the newly erected St James's Theatre, Wigan joined him, and, under the name of Sidney, was in September 1836 the original John Johnson in <span class="italic">The Strange Gentleman</span>, by Charles Dickens. In 1838 he was at a small theatre in the Old Manor House, King's Road, Chelsea, where he played Tom Tug in <span class="italic">The Waterman</span>, and other musical parts, and sang songs between the acts. With Madame Vestris he appeared in 1839 at Covent Garden, as Mr Wigan, playing the original Sir Otto of Steinberg in Sheridan Knowles's <span class="italic">Love</span>. On 5 August 1839 he married the actress <a href="#cosubject_29366">Leonora Pincott [<i>see below</i>]</a>.<br>
<br>Wigan continued at Covent Garden until 1844. Some success attended his Montagu Tigg in <span class="italic">Martin Chuzzlewit</span> and his French usher in <span class="italic">To Parents and Guardians</span>, but it was not until he was cast for Alcibiades Blague in Jerrold's <span class="italic">Gertrude's Cherries, or, Waterloo in 1835</span> that he showed, as a guide to the field of Waterloo and a seller of vamped-up relics of the fight, the remarkable finish of his style. On the abrupt closing of Covent Garden, Wigan went to the Strand, where he played Iago in a burlesque of <span class="italic">Othello</span> and parodied W. C. Macready, and then to the Lyceum, with the Keeleys, having also played at Drury Lane for a while. In later years he produced his own <span class="italic">Watch and Ward</span> (in which he was the Chevalier Du Guet), <span class="italic">A Model of a Wife</span> (in which he was Pygmalion Bonnefoi), <span class="italic">Luck's All</span>, <span class="italic">The Loan of a Wife</span>, <span class="italic">Next Door</span>, and <span class="italic">Five Hundred Pounds Reward</span>, in all of which he took some part.<br>
<br>As a member of Benjamin Webster's company Wigan appeared at the Haymarket in October 1847, playing Sir Benjamin Backbite in a revival of Sheridan's <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span>. There he was also the first Osborne in Westland Marston's <span class="italic">The Heart and the World</span> and the first Hector Maul&eacute;on in Webster's <span class="italic">The Roused Lion</span>. Dudley Smooth in Bulwer-Lytton's <span class="italic">Money</span>, Goldfinch in Holcroft's <span class="italic">The Road to Ruin</span>, and Tattle in Congreve's <span class="italic">Love for Love</span> were his other successful roles at this time. After playing at the Olympic for a while, where he produced his own <span class="italic">Law for Ladies</span>, he was in 1848&#150;9 at the Haymarket again with Mr and Mrs Charles Kean, playing various Shakespearian characters, in particular the Clown in <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span>, Bassanio in <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>, and one of the Witches in <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>. His Achille Talma Dufard in his comedy <span class="italic">The First Night</span> (adapted from <span class="italic">Le p&egrave;re de la d&eacute;butante</span>), seen at the Princess's in October 1849, was one of his finest impersonations. At the Olympic he produced in 1850 his farce <span class="italic">A Dead Take-In</span>. He continued to play at the Olympic, the Princess's, and the Adelphi until 1857, when, on the plea of ill health, he took a benefit on his retirement from the stage. He reappeared, however, at the Adelphi in March 1859 as Sir Paul Pagoda in <span class="italic">The Bengal Tiger</span>.<br>
<br>Once more Wigan's career on the stage was in full swing. He opened the St James's in November 1860 and was at the Haymarket once again in April 1861. The following year, with his wife, he gave a series of readings in London, and in October 1867 he opened the newly erected Queen's Theatre in Long Acre with Charles Reade's <span class="italic">The Double Marriage</span>, adapted from his novel <span class="italic">White Lies</span>. On the opening of the Gaiety in December 1868 he was Adolphe Chavillard in <span class="italic">On the Cards</span>, an adaptation by Alfred Thompson of <span class="italic">L'escamoteur</span>. Later, for the benefit of Charles Mathews, Wigan played Dangle in <span class="italic">The Critic</span>. In May 1870, in <span class="italic">The Man of Quality</span>, an alteration by John Hollingshead of <span class="italic">The Relapse</span>, he was Lord Foppington. On 6 July 1872, in <span class="italic">The First Night</span> and <span class="italic">Still Waters Run Deep</span>, he took a farewell benefit at Drury Lane and retired from the stage. After giving a few private readings, he was seen at the Gaiety at an afternoon performance of <span class="italic">The House or the Home</span> and <span class="italic">The Bengal Tiger</span>. In the summer of 1878 he left his house, 33 Brompton Square, and moved to Folkestone, where he died, at 26 Sandgate Road, on 29 November 1878. He was buried in Kensal Green cemetery on 8 December.<br>
<br>Wigan was an admirable actor in a rather narrow groove. He lacked robustness and breadth of style, and could never play a modern gentleman, which part he could not even dress. Humour and pathos were, however, equally at his command. He was a French scholar, and his greatest successes were made in Frenchmen or characters in which he spoke French or broken English&#151;Tourbillon in <span class="italic">To Parents and Guardians</span>, Ch&acirc;teau-Renaud, Talma Dufard, Adolphe Chavillard, Hector Maul&eacute;on in <span class="italic">The Roused Lion</span>, and the Marquis de Belleterre in <span class="italic">The Poor Nobleman</span>. His method was modelled to some extent upon that of Bouff&eacute;, a brilliant French actor of the early nineteenth century. Among purely English characters, his John Mildmay in <span class="italic">Still Waters Run Deep</span> may count as his masterpiece.<br>
<br>Wigan's wife, <a name="cosubject_29366"></a><span class="headword">Leonora Wigan <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Pincott; </span></span> <span class="st"> <em>known as </em>Mrs Alfred Wigan]</span>  (1805&#150;1884), was the daughter of Pincott, a showman, and his wife, Elizabeth, who was the daughter of William Wallack and sister of James William Wallack. Leonora was at the outset a <span class="occ">rope-dancer and performer on stilts</span>. Her first appearance in London took place on 6 July 1818 at the English Opera House (Lyceum) as Chimpanzee in a pantomime drama, <span class="italic">La Perouse, or, The Desolate Island</span>, based on Kotzebue; her mother was Umba and J. P. Cooke La Perouse. She also took part in the ballet <span class="italic">Don Juan</span> and was Ganymede in <span class="italic">Midas</span>. She was next at Drury Lane, at which her uncle James Wallack was stage-manager from 1826 to 1828, playing pantomime, utility, and walking ladies. In 1831 she was with Madame Vestris at the Olympic, where her Catherine Seton, in a burlesque on <span class="italic">Mary Queen of Scots</span>, attracted attention. On 5 August 1839 she married Alfred Wigan, whose senior she was by several years, and whom she had nursed during an illness. When in April 1844 the Lyceum opened under the management of the Keeleys, Mrs Wigan spoke the opening lines of Gilbert &agrave; Beckett's <span class="italic">Forty Thieves</span> as a police inspector of fairies; Wigan was Mustapha in the same production. She had a plump figure, a bright eye, and a mass of dark hair, but was not otherwise attractive. To her husband and his associate and partner, Robson, she was of great service, as she had stage knowledge and flair, though with no special expository capacity. She took, after her marriage, some important parts&#151;Mrs Candour in <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span> and Mrs Malaprop in <span class="italic">The Rivals</span>&#151; and obtained applause as Mrs Yellowleaf in <span class="italic">The Bengal Tiger</span> and Mrs McCann in <span class="italic">Up at the Hills</span>. Her best part was Mrs Hector Sternhold in <span class="italic">Still Waters Run Deep</span>. She supported her husband at most of the theatres at which he appeared, and acquired a reputation in Frenchwomen. She died on 17 April 1884 at her residence, Westwood Lodge, The Avenue, Gipsy Hill, Surrey.<br>
