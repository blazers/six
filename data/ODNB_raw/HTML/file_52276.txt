<span class="headword">Arn&oacute;rr Earls' Poet</span> <span class="st"> [Arn&oacute;rr Jarlask&aacute;ld, Arn&oacute;rr &THORN;&oacute;r&eth;arson, Arn&oacute;rr Th&oacute;rdarson]</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1046&#150;1073), <span class="occ">court poet in Iceland</span>, was the son of the poet Th&oacute;rd Kolbeinsson and of Oddn&yacute; Eykyndill. His father, who lived from the late tenth century into the early eleventh century and farmed at H&iacute;tardalr in western Iceland, was the lifelong opponent of the eponymous hero of <span class="italic">Bjarnar saga H&iacute;td&#339;lakappa</span>, as is told there in much picturesque and possibly fictional detail. Th&oacute;rd's paternal ancestry is given in two conflicting accounts in <span class="italic">Landn&aacute;mab&oacute;k</span>, the Icelandic <span class="italic">Book of Settlements</span>; on his mother's side he is descended from a &#145;Meld&uacute;n earl in Scotland&#146; and from &#145;Myrgjol&#146; (Muirgeal), daughter of an Irish king &#145;Glj&oacute;mall&#146;; these names are certainly Gaelic in origin and might contain or conceal an element of historical truth, since Iceland was partly settled from the viking colonies in the British Isles, and some scholars have seen Irish influence on Norse court poetry.<br>
<br>Arn&oacute;rr probably received poetic training from his father, but spent most of his career abroad, in the viking earldom of Orkney and in Norway, though little otherwise is known of his life. Poems are attributed to him about Earl R&ouml;gnvald of Orkney (&#145;R&ouml;gnvaldsdr&aacute;pa&#146;, three surviving verses) and about King Magnus the Good of Norway (&#145;Hrynhenda&#146;, also known as &#145;Magn&uacute;sdr&aacute;pa&#146;, twenty surviving verses), both of which were composed <i>c</i>.1046. A memorial lay was also attributed to him for Earl Thorfinn (II) Sigurdson (&#145;the Mighty&#146;) of Orkney (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1065), of which twenty-five verses survive; and a memorial lay, of which nineteen verses survive, for King Harald Hardrada of Norway, who fell in battle at Stamford Bridge in 1066. Two lines of a poem about the Icelandic chieftain Hermund Illugason, and five occasional verses, are also attributed to him. He is mentioned in the poetical treatise <span class="italic">Snorra Edda</span>, in the historical texts contained in <span class="italic">Morkinskinna</span>, <span class="italic">Heimskringla</span>, and <span class="italic">Flateyjarb&oacute;k</span> (and so in <span class="italic">Orkneyinga Saga</span> as preserved in <span class="italic">Flateyjarb&oacute;k</span>), and in the sagas of Icelanders, <span class="italic">Laxd&#339;la saga</span> and <span class="italic">Grettis saga</span>. Arn&oacute;rr was not only an accomplished professional poet; his poetry sometimes has an unusually personal tone, as when showing his own conflict of loyalties between R&ouml;gnvald and Thorfinn, or in his rather impassioned lament for Thorfinn's death. It is also, of course, an important contemporary witness to historical events. Arn&oacute;rr seems still to have been alive in 1073, having probably returned to Iceland.<br>
