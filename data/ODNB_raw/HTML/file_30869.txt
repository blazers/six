<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hepburn,  Patrick George Thomas  Buchan-</span>, Baron Hailes  (1901&#150;1974), <span class="occ">politician and governor-general of the Federation of the West Indies</span>, was born on 2 April 1901 at Smeaton Hepburn, East Lothian, the third son (there was also a daughter) of Sir Archibald Buchan-Hepburn, fourth baronet (1852&#150;1929), a barrister, and his wife, Edith Agnes (<i>d</i>. 1923), daughter of Edward Kent Karslake KC. The Buchan-Hepburns were descended from Patrick Hepburn, who was ennobled as Lord Hailes in 1452. Buchan-Hepburn was educated at Harrow School (1915&#150;19) and at Trinity College, Cambridge (1919&#150;22). By his own later account, his schooldays were not happy and his academic record was &#145;quite undistinguished&#146;  (Hailes MSS, 5.29). He left Cambridge with no clear ideas for his future. A talented amateur painter and a connoisseur of historic buildings, he proceeded to travel widely.<br>
<br>From January 1926 to February 1927 Buchan-Hepburn served as an honorary attach&eacute; at the British embassy in Constantinople. After returning to Britain with political ambitions, he secured appointment as unpaid private secretary to Winston Churchill. Other steps in his political apprenticeship were a foredoomed contest as Conservative candidate for Wolverhampton East in the 1929 general election, and a spell as an elected member for North Kensington on the London county council in 1930&#150;31. At the 1931 general election the Conservative landslide carried him into parliament as member for the East Toxteth division of Liverpool. &#145;I owe my good fortune very largely to you&#146;, he wrote to Churchill  (Hailes MSS, 4/2).<br>
<br>Buchan-Hepburn was no orator and seldom took part in Commons debates; rather, his talent was for organizational work. Importantly for his career, Oliver Stanley, who was widely seen as a future prime minister, took him on as parliamentary private secretary. Between 1931 and 1939 Stanley held ministerial appointments in the Home Office, transport, labour, education, and trade. By remaining with him as parliamentary private secretary throughout these years, Buchan-Hepburn acquired detailed knowledge of the workings of government. In June 1939 he became an assistant government whip and in November he was appointed a junior lord of the Treasury. He retired from this post in June 1940 in order to join the 11th (City of London yeomanry) light anti-aircraft regiment of the Royal Artillery, in which he became a brigade major on staff and served until 1943. Summoned by Churchill back to the Commons, he resumed his appointment as a junior whip in 1944. On 7 June 1945 he married Diana Mary (<i>d</i>. 1980), daughter of Brigadier-General the Hon. Charles Lambton and a descendant of Lord Durham. Her first husband, Major William Hedworth Williamson, had been killed at Alamein in 1942.<br>
<br>When the Conservatives went into opposition in July 1945 Buchan-Hepburn became deputy to James Stuart, the party's chief whip. In 1947 Stuart decided for personal reasons to retire from his post, with Buchan-Hepburn his obvious successor. Churchill was slow to authorize the transition, and Buchan-Hepburn effectively served as <i>de facto</i> chief whip until his promotion was formalized in July 1948. In the same year boundary changes left him without a safe seat to contest at the next election. Churchill failed to persuade the Liverpool tories to endorse him for Garston. Soon afterwards, however, he won endorsement for Beckenham, which he went on to hold from 1950 until his retirement from politics in 1957.<br>
<br>During the 1950&#150;51 parliament Buchan-Hepburn was centrally involved in the Conservatives' systematic campaign to harry the Attlee administration from office. In government after October 1951 he continued as chief whip, becoming parliamentary secretary to the Treasury and a privy councillor. His effectiveness could be reckoned from the fact that in the years 1951&#150;4 the government's average majority in divisions was twenty-nine, almost double its paper majority. &#145;A prodigy!&#146; was Churchill's tribute  (Hailes MSS, 4/2).<br>
<br>Buchan-Hepburn was credited by his contemporaries with inaugurating a new style in his office. Typically, tory chief whips had been military men who took a bluntly disciplinarian approach to their responsibilities. Buchan-Hepburn was subtler, more inclined to seek his objectives by turning to account his intuitive perception of the traits and motivations of others. He was articulate, charming, and persuasive, and also had the advantage of looking the part, being tall and notably elegant. He was known in parliament as &#145;Mr Efficiency&#146;&#151;but also as &#145;the Gorgeous Peacock&#146;  (<span class="italic">Yorkshire Post</span>, 10 May 1957; <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, 12 May 1957). Behind the charm he was rather vain and sensitive to criticism, and at times his composure gave way to bursts of anger. &#145;I am not &#147;pussyfoot&#148; by nature&#146;, he once remarked  (Hailes MSS, 4/20). But he made few political enemies, and as a chief whip who delivered the desired results, he enjoyed the full confidence of the party's leaders.<br>
<br>Though Buchan-Hepburn remained personally loyal to Churchill, he was anxious to see Anthony Eden succeed to the premiership, and from 1952 he was among those seeking to persuade Churchill to retire. On attaining the premiership at last in April 1955, Eden kept him on as chief whip until the reshuffle of December 1955, when he promoted him to the post of minister of works with a seat in cabinet. It was an office in which he could apply his architectural interests, but as things turned out he had little time to make an impact. He spent the later months of 1956 embroiled in the Suez crisis, as one of the few in cabinet who from first to last opposed the use of force. Yet in the aftermath of the abortive invasion he took a leading role in cabinet in urging Eden to stay on as prime minister. At the cabinet meeting of 17 December he argued that party unity was at stake and that Eden's departure would be seen as an admission of failure; an argument supported by every other minister who spoke except his old chief Stuart, who had never been an Edenite.<br>
<br>When on 9 January 1957 Eden did resign, Buchan-Hepburn was the sole minister to give unequivocal support to R. A. Butler for the succession. In a subsequently published letter to the victor, Harold Macmillan, he asked not to be considered for the new ministry. On 15 February Macmillan elevated him to the Lords; reviving the family title, he became Baron Hailes of Prestonkirk.<br>
<br>A governor-general was needed for the Federation of the West Indies, a newly devised grouping of ten Caribbean islands which the Colonial Office (CO) hoped might become, in time, a viable independent state. Both the CO and the leading Caribbean politicians felt that the governor-generalship should go to a sympathetic colonial administrator such as Sir Hugh Foot, governor of Jamaica. Indeed the colonial secretary, Alan Lennox-Boyd, had already discussed the position with Foot. But Macmillan had other plans. He informed the CO that he proposed to appoint someone with British parliamentary, ministerial, and cabinet experience, as being more appropriate for a territory close to self-government. Hailes's appointment was announced in May. The appointment as GBE followed in September.<br>
<br>Hailes arrived in the Caribbean in January 1958. To an interviewing journalist he seemed both &#145;sensitive&#146; and &#145;practical&#146;  (Hailes MSS, 5/29). As governor-general and commander-in-chief he had responsibility for external affairs, defence, and the maintenance of financial stability, along with appointive powers and a veto power over legislation. He also chaired the federal council of ministers&#151;&#145;a pretty formidable task&#146;, in the CO's judgment  (Hailes MSS, 5/3). But within the federal structure the central government was weak <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the island governments, and this limited Hailes's ability to maintain the federal momentum in the face of strong inter-island rivalries. Further, leading politicians such as Norman Manley and Eric Williams chose to hold office at island rather than federal level, which placed them outside his sphere of direct authority. His poor relationship with the governor of Trinidad (Sir Edward Beetham) did not help.<br>
<br>A federal review conference in 1959 foundered upon Jamaica&#150;Trinidad recriminations, and Trinidad in particular began pressing for a separate independence. Hailes sought reinforcement, in the shape of a visit by the colonial secretary, Iain Macleod. The Macleod visit in June 1960 was followed two months later by full internal self-government at the federal level. Hailes approved, but in April 1961, with further constitutional talks approaching, confided to Macmillan that he was &#145;not very sanguine&#146;  (Hailes MSS, 4/16). Late in 1961 the anti-federation outcome of a Jamaican referendum signalled the end of the experiment. The federation was dissolved in May 1962. It was all a &#145;bitter disappointment&#146; to Hailes  (Hailes MSS, 5/77). He had been a conscientious and energetic governor-general, but one whose institutional position was never very strong. His real problem, however, was that he was the agent of a misjudged overall policy. Federation made administrative sense in London, but not much political sense in the Caribbean.<br>
<br>Following the dissolution of the federation Hailes was appointed a Companion of Honour (1962) and retired once more. In retirement he took on the chairmanship of the Historic Buildings Council for England, a post which he held from 1963 to 1973 and in which his love of art and architecture could find practical expression. He died at his home, 1 Pelham Place, London, on 5 November 1974. There being no children from the marriage, the barony became extinct.<br>
