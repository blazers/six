<span class="headword">Nevinson,  Christopher Richard Wynne</span>  (1889&#150;1946), <span class="occ">painter and journalist</span>, was born on 13 August 1889 in John Street, Hampstead, London, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35206/', "Henry Woodd Nevinson (1856&#150;1941)")</script>, writer, journalist, and foreign correspondent, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45464/', "Margaret Nevinson, n&#233;e Wynne Jones (1858&#150;1932)")</script>, a leading suffragette and a writer. He was educated at University College School, Hampstead, and then at Uppingham School, Rutland (1904&#150;7), where excessive bullying caused his early departure. He returned to London and began to study art, first at the St John's Wood School of Art (1907&#150;8), and then at the Slade School of Fine Art (1908&#150;12), where Mark Gertler, Dora Carrington, Stanley Spencer, William Roberts, and David Bomberg were among his contemporaries. He began to exhibit regularly, painting in an impressionist style, and gained the interest of older artists, including Charles Ginner, Harold Gilman, and Spencer Gore, but not that of the assistant professor, Henry Tonks, who advised him to quit art. Nevinson left the Slade School in the summer of 1912 and travelled to Paris. There he befriended the Italian futurist painter Gino Severini and soon afterwards introduced the fragmented imagery of futurism into his own paintings, with mixed results. In due course Severini introduced him to Filippo Marinetti, the futurist leader and polemicist, already well known in England for his bombastic performances. When Marinetti visited London in 1913, he was enthusiastically welcomed by Nevinson, and also by Wyndham Lewis, the self-appointed spokesman for nearly every young independent abstract artist then comprising the English avant-garde. Lewis was eager for radical artistic change, and futurism was a noisy, freely available, anti-establishment aesthetic; but by the spring of 1914 Lewis had changed his mind: he feared an Italian takeover of abstract art in England. When&#151;on 7 June 1914&#151;Nevinson and Marinetti published <span class="italic">Vital English Art</span>, a brash futurist manifesto wrongly claiming the support and signatures of nearly all the British independents, Lewis pounced, incensed. Vilifying Marinetti and Nevinson in print, he announced vorticism, an art movement of 1914&#150;15 which attacked British aesthetic values in semi-futurist terms through the pages of his own magazine <span class="italic">Blast</span>&#151;whose name Nevinson had coined. The ensuing furore denied Marinetti a voice in Britain and, temporarily but seriously, discredited Nevinson among the English avant-garde.<br>
<br>It is arguable that Nevinson made his greatest contribution to futurism&#151;and to his own reputation&#151;in his very vocal role as Marinetti's proselytizing acolyte, and not through his paintings. His work was often uneven and owed too much of its style to Severini. However, his retreat from pure abstraction worked in Nevinson's favour, for, in the wake of <span class="italic">Blast</span>, he gave the press an accessible form of contemporary art to debate. Critics and readers alike tended to accept his paintings, whereas they were unable or unwilling to come to terms with the icy abstraction of vorticism. Nevinson called himself a futurist until late in 1915, even using the name in the vorticist exhibition catalogue of the same year. Thereafter, until his death in 1946, he was outspoken in his rejection of all group affiliations.<br>
<br>In 1915 Nevinson married Kathleen Mary Knowlman; they had one son, who died in infancy. He experienced the First World War at first hand as a Red Cross orderly (1914&#150;15), and with the Royal Army Medical Corps in France and Flanders (1915&#150;16) before illness led to his military discharge in 1916. From 1915 he executed and exhibited several harshly emotive images of the war in a futurist idiom, including <span class="italic">La mitrailleuse</span> (exh. London Group, 1915; Tate collection), whose merits were argued by well-placed admirers and detractors alike  (Cork, <span class="italic">A Bitter Truth</span>). By the end of 1915 Nevinson had completely disavowed futurism (to Lewis's delight) but did not mention this when he requested employment as an official war artist from the Ministry of Information in April 1917: official correspondence shows that Britain's head of propaganda, C. F. G. Masterman, was disappointed with the non-futuristic outcome of Nevinson's official commission. Instead, his work at, and derived from, the western front after the end of June 1917 (such as <span class="italic">Paths of Glory</span>, 1918) was a form of painterly journalism, respected by many artists and by a wide public following an exhibition at the Leicester Galleries, London, in 1918. This, and the publication of two illustrated books (<span class="italic">British Artists at the Front: C. R. W. Nevinson</span>, 1918; <span class="italic">The Great War: Fourth Year: Paintings by C. R. W. Nevinson</span>, 1918), meant that, by the armistice of 1918, Nevinson's reputation in Britain, France, and the United States was assured. However, his peacetime painting lacked the bite of his wartime images, and it was soon criticized: he may have entered journalism in self-defence, but in doing so he found an alternative m&eacute;tier. Nevinson's popularity as an outspoken artist gained him easy access to the features columns of many newspapers, and he was a frequent contributor to the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> and the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>. From 1920 until 1940 they carried his strident, maverick diatribes, aimed at society at large, and at the establishment in all its forms&#151;for example, &#145;Women growing more and more beautiful&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, October 1929) and &#145;Once more, this ridiculous Royal Academy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, May 1930). He also wrote regularly for other journals such as the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>, the <span class="italic">Strand Magazine</span>, and <span class="italic">Harper's Bazaar</span>, and the variety, salacity, and often uncompromising savagery of his egocentric articles remains enormously entertaining. However, his autobiography, <span class="italic">Paint and Prejudice</span> (1937), is marked and marred by a strong undercurrent of confrontational right-wing xenophobia, and some of his private correspondence in the Imperial War Museum in London is explicitly racist: true signs of the times to which he was such a conspicuous contributor.<br>
<br>A series of strokes in 1942 and 1943 ended Nevinson's career as a painter, and his unjustly neglected prints form his last continuous body of work. Many views of London, New York (1919&#150;21), and southern England, including several executed for London Transport, are outstanding, but his last major commission&#151;as an official war artist in 1940&#151;completely lacked his former vigour. Variously viewed by his contemporaries as charming, aggressive, and neurotic, he was the only artist among the young, pre-1914 British avant-garde who had adopted wholeheartedly the bellicose ideals of Italian futurism. Nevinson died of heart disease on 7 October 1946 at his home, 1 Steeles Studios, Haverstock Hill, Hampstead, London.<br>
