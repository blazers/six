<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Richardson, Sir  George Lloyd Reily</span>  (1847&#150;1931), <span class="occ">army officer and commander of the Ulster Volunteer Force</span>, was born in Bengal, India, on 20 September 1847, the eldest son of Major-General Joseph Fletcher Richardson (1822&#150;1900) and his wife, Mary Hannah (1828/9&#150;1908), daughter of James Reily. His father, who belonged to a Devon family with a tradition of service in India, was a Bengal cavalry officer who served in the Second Sikh, Second Burma, and Mutiny wars, and was commended for his &#145;heroic conduct&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 19 May 1900), commanded the 6th Bengal cavalry from 1854 to 1876, and retired to England.<br>
<br>George Richardson was educated at Streatham, London, and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. In March 1866 he was commissioned ensign in the 38th (1st Staffordshire) regiment, then stationed in Bengal. In March 1869 he transferred to the Bengal staff corps, and he served in his father's regiment and the 18th Bengal cavalry. He was promoted lieutenant in March 1869, captain in March 1878, major in March 1881, and lieutenant-colonel in March 1892. In 1878 he married Florence Ellen (<i>d</i>. 1924), fourth daughter of Fleetwood Williams CSI, of the Bengal civil service.<br>
<br>Richardson served in the Hazara campaign (1868) on the north-west frontier, and in the Second Afghan War (1879&#150;80), when he was commended by the adjutant-general of India for his pursuit of camel-raiders, &#145;a dashing bit of cavalry work, which reflects great credit on Captain Richardson&#146;  (Richardson papers, 1957-05-31, 13 Aug 1880). He served in the Mahsud Waziri expedition (1881) and the Zhob Valley expedition (1890). He commanded the 18th Bengal lancers from 1891 to 1897. In 1893 he commanded the Indian cavalry contingent at the London wedding of Prince George (later King George V).<br>
<br>Promoted colonel in March 1896, Richardson served in operations on the Samara and in the Kurram Valley, from August to October 1897 commanding the flying column there, during the Pathan revolt on the north-west frontier. He also took part in the Tirah campaign (1897&#150;9), including at the capture of the Sampagha Pass. From July 1900 to July 1901 he commanded the Indian cavalry brigade in the China expeditionary force, following the Boxer rebellion in 1899, and led it in the attack on the Temple of Heaven in Peking (Beijing).<br>
<br>In 1902 Richardson was promoted brigadier-general, and commanded the Hyderabad contingent, and in 1903 the Agra brigade. In 1904 he was promoted major-general and commanded the 6th (Poona) division. In 1906 he was promoted lieutenant-general, awarded a good-service pension, and appointed colonel of his old regiment, redesignated the 18th Prince of Wales's Own Tiwana Lancers. He retired in April 1908, and settled in Ireland. Small and wiry, he was a highly accomplished horseman, successful at polo and on the turf, and in jumping competitions. He was appointed CIE (1893), CB (1898), and CSI (1900), and was knighted KCB in 1909.<br>
<br>In July 1913 Richardson was appointed general officer commanding the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). The leaders of the Ulster Unionists had been preparing for armed resistance to the imposition of Irish home rule, and in March 1913 had asked Earl Roberts to command their volunteer &#145;Army of Ulster&#146;  (Jeffery, 115). Roberts declined, and tried to find a suitable officer. In April 1913 Roberts discreetly approached Richardson, who had served under Roberts in India and Afghanistan but was neither a member of his &#145;ring&#146; nor close to him. Reportedly Richardson would not accept &#145;until he was guaranteed his existing pension&#146;  (Beckett, 49). He was paid &pound;1500 per annum, the largest UVF expenditure other than armaments. On taking up the position Richardson moved to Belfast, and his appointment was made public in September 1913.<br>
<br>The UVF was an unpaid paramilitary &#145;democratic army&#146;  (Bowman, 45), reportedly some 110,000 strong, representative of the Ulster protestant loyalist majority, and including over 120 serving and former British army officers. Initially it was inadequately armed with largely obsolete weapons and drilling with wooden rifles. Richardson wrote to Roberts that soon the UVF &#145;would be able to hold its own any-where&#146;, and admired the civilian Ulster Unionist Council to whom he was responsible: &#145;Carson is a splendid Leader &amp; Craig is a wonderful organiser&#146;  (Roberts papers, 7101-23-46-184, 19 Sept 1913). Richardson had no formal disciplinary power; local units had considerable autonomy and sometimes disobeyed orders. He modified the UVF organization and inspected units. The UVF's purpose was partly image-making, to persuade the British government and public of Ulster's determination to resist home rule, but for this it needed military credibility.<br>
<br>Richardson appeared prominently at UVF reviews and parades, and was photographed and filmed. He shared secret contingency planning for &#145;the coup&#146;, taking control of Ulster after home rule, and for countering possible British government military intervention. A UVF officer later wrote that Richardson and his staff &#145;lived in daily dread of arrest, forfeiture of pensions or assassination&#146;  (Stewart, 167). He was also involved in planning gun-running to arm the UVF with effective modern rifles, though on this he was apparently cautious. In February 1914 Major Frederick Crawford of the UVF bought German and Austrian rifles and ammunition from a Hamburg arms dealer, and sailed them towards Ulster. With the arms at sea Richardson wanted to cancel the operation, but was overruled and participated in its final stage. On the night of 24/25 April the rifles and ammunition were successfully landed at Larne, co. Antrim, and elsewhere.<br>
<br>The outbreak of the First World War ended the Ulster confrontation. The Ulster Unionists supported the war and the UVF was largely recruited into the 36th (Ulster) division of Kitchener's New Army. Richardson, too old for wartime army command, continued to command the residual UVF. He assisted in the formation of the 36th division but later apparently &#145;sat neglected and neglecting in his Headquarters&#146;, regarding his position as &#145;little more than a sinecure&#146;  (Bowman, 184, 206). In April 1919, for reasons now unclear, Richardson resigned his UVF command, and in May the UVF ended. Carson thanked him for &#145;all the loyal service you so willingly gave us&#146;  (Richardson papers, 1957-05-32, 7 May 1919).<br>
<br>Richardson resumed his retirement, residing in Gloucestershire and Earl's Court, London. He did not include his UVF command in his <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> entry. Following the death of his first wife, he married, second, on 18 February 1928, Ethel Mary Judith Yorke (1885&#150;1976), younger daughter of James Edward Penrose of Woodhill, Cork, and Hartley Wintney, Hampshire. Richardson died on 9 April 1931 at the home of his wife's family, Alton Lodge, Hartley Wintney.<br>
