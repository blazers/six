<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Baldwin family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1760&#150;1857), <span class="occ">newspaper proprietors</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_56525"></a><span class="headword">Henry Baldwin</span>  (1734&#150;1813)<span class="occ"></span>. Born on 26 December 1734 in London, he was the second son, in the family of three sons and four daughters, of Robert Baldwin, apothecary, of Faringdon, Berkshire, and his wife, Jane. Baldwin was apprenticed on 5 September 1749 as a printer to Edward Say, newspaper publisher, and admitted to the livery at the Stationers' Company on 27 December 1756. His first known venture as printer was the <span class="italic">London Packet</span>, but on 4 March 1761 he launched the <span class="italic">St James's Chronicle</span> from Whitefriars as a thrice-weekly evening newspaper.<br>
<br>Shortly before its d&eacute;but, Baldwin purchased from fellow printer William Rayner the <span class="italic">London Spy</span>, <span class="italic">Read's Weekly Journal</span>, and the <span class="italic">St James's Evening Post, or, British Gazette</span>. The <span class="italic">Spy</span> and the <span class="italic">Journal</span> were merged to form a Saturday paper, and the <span class="italic">St James's Evening Post</span> became the <span class="italic">St James's Chronicle</span>. To secure financial support, Baldwin formed a joint-stock company; the other proprietors included George Colman, David Garrick, and Bonnell Thornton. The meetings of the proprietors of the <span class="italic">St James's Chronicle</span> were to span more than fifty years and its minute books are the most detailed of any eighteenth-century newspaper.<br>
<br>Within a few months of the paper's launch, Baldwin was joined as editor by Nathaniel Thomas, fresh from Oxford University. And with writers of the calibre of Colman, William Cowper, Oliver Goldsmith, and Thornton involved, the early days of the paper were indeed heady, as John Nichols was to describe in his <span class="italic">Literary Anecdotes</span> (1812): &#145;Baldwin with the aid of a phalanx of first-rate wits brought it to a height of literary eminence till then unobtainable in any journal&#146;  (Griffiths, <span class="italic">Encyclopedia</span>, 87).<br>
<br>Under Baldwin, the <span class="italic">Chronicle</span> was also to be an outspoken critic of the government; and on 21 May 1765, with Charles Say and Henry Woodfall, he was summoned to the House of Lords because of an article published three days earlier describing a mass meeting of impoverished weavers. Four years later, on 21 December 1769, he reprinted the Junius letter from the <span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span> attacking the king and the government. As a result, Baldwin, with others, was charged&#151;and acquitted. One consequence of the Junius trial was that parliamentary debates were now reported increasingly and with great accuracy, leading the government, on 5 February 1771, to reaffirm that they should not be published. Notwithstanding, the debate was immediately published by Baldwin. As a consequence, with Wright, another publisher, he was made to kneel in penance before the speaker, the last ever to do so, and after being reprimanded was discharged on paying his fees. Baldwin rose in silence, ostentatiously brushed his knees, and in an audible aside remarked: &#145;What a damned dirty House&#146;  (Griffiths, <span class="italic">Encyclopedia</span>, 87).<br>
<br>The following year, Baldwin, increasingly successful, moved to new premises at 108 Fleet Street. His marriage to Eleanor, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Graham, produced three sons, Robert, George, and <a href="#cosubject_48268">Charles [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and three daughters. His remaining time as chief proprietor was to be less eventful, and in 1792 he served as master of the Stationers' Company. Henry Baldwin died on 21 February 1813, and the <span class="italic">St James's Chronicle</span> of 20&#150;22 February noted:<blockquote>Upwards of 40 years a Proprietor and Printer of this Paper: but who had long retired from business. &hellip; The firm rectitude of his mind, the real tenderness of his heart, and the sincerity of his attachments were best known in his domestic circle and to his chosen friends. (<span class="italic">St James's Chronicle</span>, 20&#150;22 Feb 1813)</blockquote>Henry Baldwin was succeeded as proprietor of the <span class="italic">St James's Chronicle</span> by his son <a name="cosubject_48268"></a><span class="headword">Charles Baldwin</span>  (1774&#150;1869)<span class="occ"></span>, who was bound to his father as an apprentice compositor on 7 July 1789. &#145;So quickly did he attain the knowledge of the business that at 18 Mr Baldwin senior confided in him the entire superintendence of the working part of his establishment&#146;  (Griffiths, <span class="italic">Encyclopedia</span>, 87). In 1801, at the age of twenty-seven, Charles saw his efforts rewarded when his father changed the firm's name to Henry Baldwin &amp; Son and later relinquished his two shares. He married Elizabeth Ann Laurents of Jersey. They had fifteen children, one of whom, <a href="#cosubject_56523">Edward [<i>see below</i>]</a>, later took over the business. By 1808, through gift, exchange, and purchase, Charles Baldwin owned seven of the eight shares in the company and with the death of Christopher Moody, the other shareholder, seven years later he became sole owner.<br>
<br>In 1809 Charles Baldwin bought the rival <span class="italic">London Evening-Post</span>, and then in 1819 purchased the <span class="italic">London Chronicle</span> for &pound;300 from its owner, Colonel Robert Torrens, and absorbed it into the <span class="italic">St James's Chronicle</span>. That same year, Baldwin and his new editor, Dr Stanley Lees Giffard, were loud in their condemnation of the crowds at the Peterloo massacre on 16 August:<blockquote>What has long been desired by every friend of order has at length taken place. The strong arm of the law has been put forth to put, we trust, a final stop to the assemblage of the ignorant and the seditious. (Griffiths, <span class="italic">Encyclopedia</span>, 86)</blockquote>With the appointment of George Canning as prime minister in April 1827, the old tories sought to start a newspaper in opposition and approached Baldwin. After long discussions he agreed, and on 21 May 1827 <span class="italic">The Standard</span> was launched, carrying Baldwin's declaration:<blockquote>I was not willing to risk the continuance of my old and valued journal [the <span class="italic">St James's Chronicle</span>]; I preferred the heavier risk of establishing at my own expense and hazard, a Daily Evening Paper to be conducted on the same principles and by the same editor [Giffard]. I also engaged the assistance of Dr Maginn and other celebrated writers.</blockquote>For Baldwin and his editor, there were to be three unshakeable principles: total opposition to Catholic emancipation, to parliamentary reform, and to repeal of the corn laws&#151;and for the next twenty years they were to fight hard in the struggle to defend these. Initially, the sales of the paper were barely 700, but within five years the circulation had risen to more than 1500; and with his other papers Baldwin was &#145;said to be worth upwards of &pound;100,000&#146;. Profits on <span class="italic">The Standard</span> alone were estimated to be between &pound;7000 and &pound;8000 per year; and, apart from <span class="italic">The Standard</span> and the <span class="italic">St James's Chronicle</span>, he was also owner of the <span class="italic">London Packet</span>, which came out twice weekly, and the <span class="italic">London Journal</span>, a weekly&#151;&#145;all got up with scarcely any expense out of <span class="italic">The Standard</span>&#146;  (Griffiths, <span class="italic">Encyclopedia</span>, 86). It was believed that his total income from newspapers was more than &pound;15,000 a year.<br>
<br>In 1844, having reached the age of seventy, Charles Baldwin decided to retire. He continued, however, to attend the Stationers' Hall, having twice been master of the company, in 1842 and 1843, and the Literary Society, of which he was a founder member in 1799. He unsuccessfully contested the constituency of Lambeth in 1837 and 1841. He died aged ninety-five at his daughter's house, 27 Sussex Gardens, Hyde Park, London, on 18 February 1869, and to the very end it was said that &#145;his genial disposition, amiable manners and lively conversation endeared him to a large circle of younger friends&#146;  (Griffiths, <span class="italic">Encyclopedia</span>, 86). However, his passing was totally ignored by <span class="italic">The Standard</span>.<br>
<br>Since Baldwin's retirement in 1844, the papers had been run by his son <a name="cosubject_56523"></a><span class="headword">Edward Baldwin</span>  (1803&#150;1890)<span class="occ"></span>. He had been educated at St John's College, Oxford (BA 1824, MA 1827), and one of his first acts on assuming control was to develop the <span class="italic">Morning Herald</span>, which he had recently purchased from the Thwaites family. In writing of the transaction, James Grant described Edward Baldwin as a thoroughly enterprising and enlightened trader in journalism, &#145;who, two decades after Dudley's death, bought the <span class="italic">Morning Herald</span> from the little group of fifth-rate capitalists to which it had gone&#146;  (Griffiths, <span class="italic">Encyclopedia</span>, 86). He immediately entered on a course of spirited rivalry with <span class="italic">The Times</span>, which set all its resources in motion to crush the new competitor. With Giffard acting as editor in addition to his <span class="italic">Standard</span> role, Edward's first task was to engage the best journalists and increase the honorarium paid for leading articles from 3 guineas to 5 guineas.<br>
<br>After an initial loss, the railway mania of 1845 meant that, through the huge increase in advertising extolling new railway companies, the <span class="italic">Herald</span> was running a twenty-page paper and making big profits. However, later that year, on 17 November, <span class="italic">The Times</span> exposed the competing railway companies, showing that there were more than 1200 projected railways seeking to raise some &pound;500 million. The bubble burst immediately, but Baldwin, still intent on overtaking <span class="italic">The Times</span>, continued to pay high wages. The average circulation dropped, however, from 6400 in 1845 to 3700 by 1854.<br>
<br>It was a state of affairs that could not last, and in March 1857 there appeared a short notice in <span class="italic">The Times</span> announcing the bankruptcy proceedings of Edward Baldwin&#151;and with it the end of almost 100 years of his family's involvement in the London newspaper world. Edward Baldwin himself moved to Streatham Green, London, where he died on 31 January 1890. His wife's identity is unknown, but at least two sons survived him. In his obituary it was noted that &#145;his connexion with the Press belongs to a past generation, but in his time he played a prominent part in the newspaper world and was an ardent supporter of the early policy of Lord Derby and Mr Disraeli&#146;  (Griffiths, <span class="italic">Encyclopedia</span>, 86).<br>
