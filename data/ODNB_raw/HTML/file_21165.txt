<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Palliser, Sir  Hugh</span>, first baronet  (1723&#150;1796), <span class="occ">naval officer and politician</span>, was born on 26 February 1723 at Kirk Deighton in the West Riding of Yorkshire. He was the son of Captain Hugh Palliser, army officer, of North Deighton and Mary, daughter of Humphrey Robinson of Thicket Hall, Cottingworth, Yorkshire. In 1735 he was entered as a midshipman on the <i>Aldborough</i>, commanded by his uncle, Nicholas Robinson. Two years later he moved, with Robinson, to the <i>Kennington</i>, in which he remained for three years. He was for a few months in 1740 in the <i>Deptford</i> storeship and in the <i>Tiger</i>, and early in 1741 he joined his uncle in the <i>Essex</i>. He passed his examination for lieutenant on 12 May 1741, and, continuing in the <i>Essex</i>, was promoted to that rank on 18 September 1741. At the beginning of the winter Robinson was superseded in the command by Richard Norris, son of Sir John Norris, and Palliser, continuing with him, was first lieutenant of the <i>Essex</i> in the action off Toulon on 11 February 1744. Amid the charges and counter-charges that followed, Palliser, with some of the other lieutenants of the <i>Essex</i>, preferred a charge of cowardice and misconduct against Norris, whose career was subsequently terminated.<br>
<br>On 3 July 1746 Palliser was promoted commander of the <i>Weasel</i>, and on 25 November captain of the <i>Captain</i>, going out to the West Indies with the broad pennant of Commodore Edward Legge. On Legge's death (19 September 1747) Palliser was moved into the <i>Sutherland</i> (50 guns), and in the following March he was severely wounded by an explosion and was obliged to return to England. By December he had recovered sufficiently to be appointed to the frigate <i>Sheerness</i>, in which he was sent out to the East Indies with news of the peace. He joined Edward Boscawen on the Coromandel coast in July 1749, and returned to England in the following April, when the ship was paid off.<br>
<br>In January 1753 Palliser was appointed to the <i>Yarmouth</i>, guardship at Chatham, from which in March he was moved to the <i>Seahorse</i>, a small frigate employed during that and the next year on the coast of Scotland to prevent smuggling. At the end of September 1754 the <i>Seahorse</i> was ordered to refit at Sheerness. From there she went to co. Cork, and sailed in January 1755, in charge of a convoy of transports, for Virginia, from where Palliser returned to England on 26 July, Commodore Augustus Keppel taking a passage with him; they arrived at Spithead on 22 August 1755.<br>
<br>A month later Palliser was appointed to the <i>Eagle</i> at Plymouth, and early in October he was sent to cruise off Ushant, where he captured several vessels coming home from Newfoundland. During 1756 the <i>Eagle</i> was one of the fleet cruising off Ushant and in the Bay of Biscay under Admirals Edward Hawke, Edward Boscawen, or Sir Charles Knowles, and in 1757 she was with Rear-Admiral Francis Holburne off Louisbourg. During the summer of 1758 Palliser commanded the <i>Shrewsbury</i> in the fleet off Ushant under Lord Anson; and in 1759 he took part in the operations in the St Lawrence leading up to the reduction of Quebec. In 1760 he was with Sir Charles Saunders in the Mediterranean, and for some time had command of a detached squadron in the Levant. In 1762 he was sent out to Newfoundland with a small squadron to retake St John's; but that service having already been accomplished, he returned to England.<br>
<br>In April 1764 Palliser was appointed governor and commander-in-chief at Newfoundland, with his broad pennant in the <i>Guernsey</i>. This was at that time a summer appointment, the ships coming home for the winter; but in Palliser's case it was twice renewed, in 1765 and 1766, during which time he acted as a commissioner for adjusting the French claims to fishing rights, and directed a survey of the coasts, which was carried out by the circumnavigator James Cook. In 1770 Palliser was appointed comptroller of the navy, and on 6 August 1773 he was created a baronet. In the following year he was elected MP for Scarborough. He took his seat as a supporter of Lord North's ministry and spoke on naval affairs during the American War of Independence. On 31 March 1775 Palliser was promoted rear-admiral, and shortly afterwards he was appointed one of the lords of the Admiralty, under the earl of Sandwich. In the same year, by the will of his old chief Sir Charles Saunders, he came into a legacy of &pound;5000, and was appointed lieutenant-general of marines in succession to Saunders. On 29 January 1778 he was promoted vice-admiral of the blue; and in March, when Vice-Admiral Keppel was appointed to the command of the Channel Fleet, Palliser, while still retaining his seat at the Admiralty, was appointed third in command under him.<br>
<br>Off Ushant for three days (24&#150;7 July 1778), the English and French fleets were in each other's presence, Keppel vainly trying to bring the enemy to action. On the morning of 27 July a shift of wind enabled Keppel in the <i>Formidable</i> to bring the enemy to a brief, indecisive but damaging action. After the two fleets drew clear of each other Keppel signalled to reform the line, hoping to renew the battle. However, Palliser's rear squadron had been damaged and was unable to get into its station until after nightfall. Next day the French fleet was not in sight and Keppel returned to Plymouth. This indecisive engagement created great disappointment at home. The &#145;opposition&#146; press, led by the <span class="italic">General Advertiser</span>, blamed Keppel's failure to defeat the French on Palliser's tardiness in supporting him for a renewed attack. Furious at this, Palliser in November desired Keppel to write to the press to contradict their accusation. Keppel refused, whereupon Palliser issued his own explanation of events in the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>. The two men clashed in the House of Commons on 2 December, when Keppel implied Palliser had been negligent if not disobedient in failing to answer his signals. Impulsively Palliser demanded a court martial on Keppel for misconduct and neglect of duty. In a court packed with Keppel's friends he was honourably acquitted in February 1779. The London mob celebrated his acquittal by gutting Palliser's house in Pall Mall, and by burning Palliser in effigy. In York they are said to have demolished the house of Palliser's sister.<br>
<br>The court martial on Keppel had pronounced the charges &#145;malicious and ill-founded&#146;  (Drummond, 3.247). Palliser consequently resigned his appointments, including his Admiralty seat, withdrew from parliament, and applied for a court martial on himself in February 1779. Keppel declined to prepare the charge for the trial which began at Portsmouth on 12 April. Because of Keppel's decision there was accordingly no prosecutor and no charges; proceedings were rather in the nature of an inquiry. Even so they lasted twenty-one days. Palliser's &#145;conduct was considered in many respects highly exemplary and meritorious&#146;  (ibid.); however, he was criticized for failing to inform his commander-in-chief of the state of his ship, and, though he was acquitted of any misconduct, his acquittal was neither unanimous nor with honour.<br>
<br>Although he requested to be reinstated in the offices which he had resigned Palliser was appointed, only through the efforts of Sandwich, to the governorship of Greenwich Hospital in 1780. He did not stand at the 1780 general election but did contest, and win, the vacant seat of Huntingdon in October of that year. He became an admiral on 24 September 1787 and died, unmarried, at his country seat of Vach in Buckinghamshire, on 19 March 1796, allegedly &#145;of a disorder induced by the wounds received on board the <i>Sutherland</i>&#146;. He was buried in the parish church of Chalfont St Giles. At his death the bulk of his estate passed to his illegitimate son. The baronetcy descended to his grandnephew Hugh Palliser Walters, who took the name Palliser, and from him to his son, on whose death it became extinct.<br>
