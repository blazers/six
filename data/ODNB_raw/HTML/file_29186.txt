<span class="headword">Wheeler, Sir  Hugh Massy</span>  (1789&#150;1857), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company</span>, was born on 30 June 1789 at Clonbeg, co. Tipperary, Ireland, the son of Captain Hugh Wheeler of the East India Company's service and his wife, Margaret, second daughter of Hugh, first Lord Massy. He was educated at Richmond, Surrey, and at Bath grammar school. Wheeler married Frances Matilda (<i>d</i>. 1857), the Anglo-Indian widow of Thomas Samuel Oliver, at Agra on 6 March 1842, and they had a son and two daughters.<br>
<br>Wheeler was commissioned ensign in the 24th Bengal infantry, in the East India Company's service, in 1803 and the following year served with his regiment during Lord Lake's campaign against Delhi. On 5 April 1805 he was promoted lieutenant, and captain on 1 January 1818. Wheeler was sent on detached duty in December 1824 with two companies, and dealt successfully with the robber Diraj Singh. On 27 June 1835 he was promoted lieutenant-colonel and in December was appointed to command the 48th native infantry. Wheeler led this regiment in Afghanistan in 1838&#150;9, and was present at the assault and capture of Ghazni on 23 July 1839 and the occupation of Kabul on 6 August. For his services during the war he was mentioned in dispatches in October and made a CB on 20 December 1839. Wheeler was also highly commended by Sir Willoughby Cotton and mentioned in dispatches when on 19 August 1840 he dealt with a gathering of hostile Waziri tribesmen near Kaja, 30 miles from Jalalabad, and destroyed several enemy forts. In December 1840 Wheeler accompanied Cotton to India, his regiment forming part of the escort guarding Dost Muhammad, the former shah, who had surrendered. For his services in Afghanistan Wheeler was allowed to accept from the Shuja al-Mulk and wear the order of the Durani empire.<br>
<br>Wheeler was appointed to command the 2nd infantry brigade, composed of the 50th foot, 48th native infantry, and the Sirmur battalion, in the army of the Sutlej on 13 December 1845. At the battle of Mudki on 18 December he was badly wounded, but, although still suffering from his injuries, with his brigade he joined Sir Harry Smith near Ludhiana on 26 January 1846 and took a prominent part in the battle of Aliwal two days later. In his dispatch dated 30 January 1846 Sir Harry Smith observed: &#145;In Brigadier Wheeler, my second in command, I had a support I could rely on with every confidence, and most gallantly did he head his brigade.&#146; On 17 February Wheeler led his brigade across the Sutlej River and occupied the strong fort at Phillaur, before advancing to the banks of the Beas. For his services he was made aide-de-camp to the queen with the rank of colonel in the army from 3 April 1846.<br>
<br>On 29 April Wheeler was appointed to command the Jullundur Doab as a brigadier-general of the first class. Following the outbreak of the Second Anglo-Sikh War he took the field in September, and on 14 October reduced the strong fortress of Rangal Naga. For this action he was congratulated by Lord Gough, who ascribed the success to &#145;his soldier-like and judicious arrangements&#146;. Wheeler was appointed to command the 9th brigade of the 4th infantry division of the army of the Punjab on 8 November 1848. Later that month he was mentioned in dispatches by Sir Hugh Gough for his important role in the reduction of Kalawala. While commanding the Punjab division and the Jullundur field force Wheeler was also later mentioned in dispatches for his assault and the capture of the heights of Dallah during his difficult operations against Ram Singh. When the war ended the governor-general commented in general orders on the great skill and success with which Wheeler had carried out the duties assigned to him. For his services Wheeler received the campaign medal, the thanks of both houses of parliament, and the thanks of the directors of the East India Company; on 16 August 1850 he was made a KCB.<br>
<br>Wheeler resumed his command of the Jullundur Doab, and on 20 June 1854 was promoted to be major-general. He was appointed to the command of the Cawnpore division on 30 June 1856. When the Indian mutiny began in May 1857 Wheeler remained surprisingly optimistic when news reached him that the Indian regiments stationed at Meerut and Delhi had mutinied. As a precautionary measure, however, Wheeler selected a defensive position outside the city of Cawnpore, near the sepoy lines, where some half-completed barracks offered suitable accommodation for the European men, women, and children under his command. His small European force was also reinforced by a small detachment from Lucknow, and despite Sir Henry Lawrence's words of warning Wheeler also enlisted the support of the Raja Dundhu Panth of Bithur (afterwards known as Nana Sahib). Three hundred of his men and two guns arrived at Cawnpore on 22 May and took over the custody of the treasury at Nawabganj. The incomplete entrenchment was quickly occupied by the European women, children, and other non-combatants who were joined at the beginning of June by Wheeler. On 1 June Wheeler confidently wrote to Lord Canning informing him that he had sent transport to bring in the European population of Allahabad &#145;and in a few days&#151;a very few days&#151;I shall consider Cawnpore safe&#151;nay, that I may send aid to Lucknow if needed&#146;. Despite Sir Henry Lawrence's unease about Cawnpore's defences, two officers and fifty men were sent two days later from the city to help defend Lucknow. He had good grounds for concern. In fact, Wheeler's position at Cawnpore was very weak. A combination of over-confidence about the loyalty of the Indian regiments stationed at Cawnpore and his anxiety not to provoke an incident had persuaded Wheeler deliberately to reject occupying the easily defensible magazine, a large walled enclosure near the river that was amply supplied with arms, ammunition, and stores, which could have held out until help arrived. The hastily constructed entrenchment that he had chosen to occupy instead was badly sited, its defences were weak, and inadequate supplies had been collected to withstand a long siege.<br>
<br>During the night of 4 June the 2nd cavalry regiment and 1st native infantry stationed at Cawnpore mutinied, joining with the Nana's troops at Nawabganj. The treasury was looted, public buildings set on fire, and the magazine, with its heavy artillery, ammunition, and stores, was occupied by the rebels. The two unaffected native infantry regiments followed suit the next day and the mutineers, laden with loot, started marching towards Delhi until the Nana persuaded them to return to attack the Europeans&#151;numbering just under 1000&#151;gathered at Cawnpore. On the night of 6 June the bombardment of Wheeler's position commenced, using guns captured at the arsenal. Heavy casualties were inflicted in the exposed entrenchment each day, including Wheeler's already wounded son, Godfrey, who was decapitated by a roundshot. A combination of intense heat, hunger, and thirst caused further intense suffering among the handful of defenders and the large number of non-combatants crowding the position. On 25 June Nana offered the garrison terms of surrender, but although Wheeler wanted to reject them outright he was persuaded by his fellow officers that the safety and well-being of the civilians was paramount. The remnant of the garrison, with the surviving women and children, marched out of the entrenchment under arms after a three-week siege on the morning of 27 June, under a safe conduct from the Nana to proceed downstream by river to Allahabad. While this column embarked on boats at the Satichaura Ghat and started to journey downriver, however, the mutineers and Nana's troops suddenly opened fire, killing and wounding large numbers of the surviving soldiers, women, and children. Wheeler was among those killed, along with his wife and elder daughter, Margaret Frances. His eighteen-year-old daughter, Ulrica, was rescued from the ghat by an Indian cavalryman who later married her. The women and children who survived the massacre were imprisoned in atrocious conditions in the <i>bibigarh</i> in Cawnpore, and later murdered.<br>
