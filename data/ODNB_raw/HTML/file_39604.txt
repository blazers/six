<span class="headword">Adams,  Maurice</span>  (1850&#150;1935), <span class="occ">socialist and moral philosopher</span>, was the youngest child of John Botroele Adams, a general agent who specialized in building and insurance work. His elder sister Mary had been born nine years earlier in Birmingham. After leaving school, Adams qualified as a chartered insurance broker and joined his father's firm, which became John B. Adams &amp; Son, Incorporated Insurance Brokers, of Moorgate, London. He remained in business as an insurance broker until retirement. On 10 June 1880 he was married in the parish church of Lambeth to Ada Clementina Barnett, four years his junior, and the daughter of John Barnett, a microscope maker. He and his wife spent the rest of their lives near Croydon, Surrey, first at Norbury Cottage, Beulah Road, Thornton Heath, and then, from about 1900, at Fairdeen Cottage, 52 Downs Road, Coulsdon. They had one son, John, born in 1881, who later joined the family firm. Some time in the 1880s Adams's sister Mary, a spinster, moved in with them.<br>
<br>In the late 1870s Adams became profoundly dissatisfied with the religion of his family, and began to seek an alternative. He met William Jupp, a Congregationalist minister who was having problems accepting the discipline of church membership, and who later founded a free religious movement in the Croydon area. The two men became lifelong friends, both of them living for a while in Beulah Road. They went on long walks together, during which Adams pursued his amateur interest in botany. When Thomas Davidson, a peripatetic philosopher, returned briefly to England from 1882 to 1884, Adams and Jupp were part of the small group which collected around him to discuss religion, ethics, and social reform. A difference of opinion within the group led to those who emphasized the importance of economic and social reform departing to form the Fabian Society, while those who remained continued as the Fellowship of the New Life, emphasizing the importance of reforming the spiritual and moral basis of society. Adams joined both organizations, but his main concerns and activities were those of the fellowship. He resigned from the Fabian Society together with Ramsay MacDonald, Mrs Pankhurst, and Henry Salt on 20 April 1900 in protest at the society's failure to adopt a clear stance in opposition to the South African War.<br>
<br>Adams edited the newspaper of the fellowship, the <span class="italic">Sower</span> (renamed <span class="italic">Seedtime</span> after the first issue), from its inception in July 1889 until the final issue of February 1898. He also wrote articles on subjects such as &#145;Equality&#146;, &#145;Labour in America&#146;, and &#145;Domestic servitude&#146;. He edited, with an introduction, Thomas More's <span class="italic">Utopia</span> (1890), and he wrote short works on <span class="italic">The Ethics of Social Reform</span> (1887) and <span class="italic">Giordano Bruno</span> (1905). All of his writing reflected the socialism of the fellowship; a socialism which owed more to Emerson and Wordsworth than to Marx, more to the utopian visions of Thomas More and Giordano Bruno than the schemes for municipalization taking shape with the Fabian Society. The members set out to promote the spiritual ethic they believed would inspire people to transform their own lives, and thereby rid society of abuses such as sweated labour. Although the fellowship had little direct impact on British politics, it was the fountainhead for much of the peculiarly ethical socialism which spread throughout the country at the turn of the century. This was something Adams foresaw when he wrote, in the last issue of <span class="italic">Seedtime</span>, upon the disbanding of the fellowship, &#145;it is not to its meetings that the Fellowship must look for the spread of its teaching, but to the lives of those who have received the Fellowship ideal&#146;.<br>
<br>Adams himself carried the fellowship ideal into several other groups. He lectured on topics such as &#145;The self and the moral life&#146; to organizations such as the Christo-Theosophical Society. He was a member of the Humanitarian Society, which published his lecture on &#145;The sweating system&#146; as a tract in December 1896. From 1902 to 1922 he was a member of the Rainbow Circle, a progressive discussion group, speaking on &#145;The basis of ethics&#146; in October 1908, and again on &#145;William James&#146; in December 1911. Most importantly, when the fellowship disbanded, he led some of the members into the Croydon Ethical and Religious Fellowship as part of the British Ethical Movement. In April 1898 he was one of the ethical thinkers Stanton Coit brought together in the Society of Ethical Propagandists, a group of men who could not take holy orders because their consciences kept them out of the churches but who were to act as quasi-religious teachers. All this time his fundamental concern remained the same: to use evolutionary theory to buttress a science of ethics highlighting the growth of co-operation, and inspiring a higher individualism centred on self-realization through the good of others. Adams died at his home in Coulsdon, Surrey, on 3 December 1935; his wife survived him.<br>
