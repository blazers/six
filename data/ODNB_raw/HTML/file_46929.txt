<span class="headword">Tyrwhit <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Oxenbridge]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>, Lady Tyrwhit  (<em>d.</em> 1578), <span class="occ">author and courtier</span>, was born at Forde Place, Brede, Sussex, one of five children of Sir Goddard Oxenbridge (<i>d</i>. 1531) and his second wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1531), daughter of Sir Thomas Fiennes, son of Richard, Lord Dacre of Herstmonceux. Between March 1538 and August 1539 Elizabeth Oxenbridge was married, as his second wife, to Sir Robert Tyrwhit (<i>d</i>. 1572) of Leighton Bromswold, Huntingdonshire, second son of Sir Robert Tyrwhit of Kettleby, Lincolnshire, and his wife, Maude, daughter of Sir Robert Taylboys. They had a daughter named Katherine who married Sir Henry Darcy of Brimham, Yorkshire, and died in 1567. From her father's first marriage Elizabeth had a half-brother, Thomas, whose daughter Elizabeth, also married to a Robert Tyrwhit, needs to be distinguished from her father's half-sister.<br>
<br>The elder Elizabeth Tyrwhit's early career took place at the court of Henry VIII, where she appears in household records from 1537 on as a recipient of gifts and as a gentlewoman of the privy chamber. Her relationship with Katherine Parr was especially close, possibly because Parr was cousin by marriage to Sir Robert Tyrwhit through her own first marriage to Edward, Lord Borough. Tyrwhit shared Parr's protestant sympathies and, with others of Parr's ladies-in-waiting suspected of links to the martyr Anne Askew, was arrested by Henry in 1546. When Katherine Parr died of puerperal fever in September 1548, Tyrwhit was at her bedside. For a brief period in 1549, after the scandal surrounding the relationship between Parr's last husband, Thomas Seymour, and Princess Elizabeth in 1547&#150;8, Tyrwhit was appointed governess to the princess in lieu of the suspect Katherine Astley.<br>
<br>In recognition of her ardently Reformist leanings, Tyrwhit's husband noted that &#145;my wyffe is not sayne in Dyvinity, but is half a Scripture woman&#146;  (Haynes, <span class="italic">Collection of State Papers</span>, 104). Both her own work and the dedication to her by John Feilde, rector of St Giles Cripplegate, London, of his translation of Jean de l'Espine's <span class="italic">Excellent Treatise of Christian Righteousness</span> (T. Vautrollier, 1577) support this view of her religious opinions. Tyrwhit's book, <span class="italic">Morning and Evening Praiers, with Divers Psalmes Himnes and Meditations</span> (1574), contains orders for private morning and evening prayers, with a series of &#145;godly prayers&#146; and hymns appended, and appears in a unique copy held in the British Library. Another version appears in &#145;The second lampe&#146; of Thomas Bentley's <span class="italic">Monument of Matrones</span> (1582). It differs substantially from the original, however, for Bentley changes not only structure, but also content and tone, by amalgamating some prayers, inserting others by different authors, and deleting some of Tyrwhit's altogether.<br>
<br>Of considerable interest is the volume in which Tyrwhit's original text appears, largely because a handwritten note on the flyleaf indicates that it belonged to Elizabeth I. Along with Tyrwhit's work, it contains the litany and an incomplete copy of <span class="italic">The Queen's Prayers</span> by Katherine Parr. The book's binding in enamelled gold depicts Moses raising the serpent and the judgment of Solomon on front and back covers, respectively. The former is surrounded by the phrase, &#145;Make the afyrye serpent an settt [<i>sic</i>] up for a sygne that as many as are bytte maye loke upon it an lyve&#146;, while the border around the latter states, &#145;Then the kyng ansvered an sayd gyve her the lyvyng child an slaye [it] not for she is the mother thereof.&#146;<br>
<br>Tyrwhit died at her home in St John's Lane, Clerkenwell, Middlesex, and her will, dated 1577, was proved on 28 April 1578. An effigy of Elizabeth, along with those of her husband and daughter, can be found in the church of St Mary, Leighton Bromswold.<br>
