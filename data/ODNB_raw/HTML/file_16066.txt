<span class="headword">Lapworth,  Edward</span>  (1574&#150;1636), <span class="occ">physician and poet</span>, was born in Warwickshire. His father, possibly the Michael Lapworth who was elected fellow of All Souls, Oxford, in 1562 and graduated BM in 1573, was physician to Henry Berkeley.<br>
<br>Lapworth is probably the Edward Lapworth who matriculated from Exeter College, Oxford, on 31 January 1589. He was admitted BA from St Alban's Hall on 25 October 1592, and MA on 30 June 1595. From 1598 to 1610 he was master of Magdalen College School, and as a member of Magdalen College he supplicated for the degree of MB and for licence to practise medicine on 1 March 1603. He was licensed on 3 June 1605, and was admitted BM and DM on 20 June 1611. He was &#145;moderator in vesperiis&#146; in medicine in 1605 and 1611 and &#145;respondent&#146; in natural philosophy on James I's visit to Oxford in 1605. In July 1611 he had permission to be absent from congregation so that he might attend to his practice. In 1617 and 1619 Lapworth seems to have been in practice at Faversham, Kent. In 1618 at Oxford he was designated first Sedleian reader in natural philosophy under the will of the founder (though the bequest did not take effect until 1621), and on 9 August 1619 he was appointed Linacre physic lecturer. From this time he resided part of the year in Oxford, but in the summer he usually practised in Bath.<br>
<br>Lapworth married, first, Mary Coxhead, who was buried on 2 January 1621; and, second, Margery, daughter of Sir George Snigg of Bristol, baron of the exchequer, and widow of George Chaldecot of Quarlstone. With his first wife he had a son, Michael, who matriculated at Magdalen College in 1621, aged seventeen; he also had a daughter, Anne, who was her father's heir, and became the mother of the poet and dramatist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15155/', "William Joyner")</script>.<br>
<br>According to Guidott, in person Lapworth was &#145;not tall, but fat and corpulent&#146;, a scholarly man, with a taste for poetry. At the marriage of Theophila Berkeley to Sir Robert Coke in 1613 there were, it is said, &#145;songs of joy from that learned physician, Doctor E. Lapworth&#146;  (Smyth, 3.401). The verses he contributed to a variety of books included lines on Elizabeth's death and on James I's accession. There were some verses of his in Joshua Sylvester's <span class="italic">Du Bartas, his Devine Weekes and Workes</span> (1605), and in the treatise of Edward Jorden on <span class="italic">Naturall Bathes and Minerall Waters</span> (1631). The lines given in MS Ashmole 781, fol. 137, as by &#145;Dr. Latworth on his deathbed&#146;, seem to be his; they begin &#145;My God, I speak it from a full assurance&#146;. There are some notes of his as to a child with two heads being born at Oxford in 1633  (Queen's College, Oxford, MS 121, fol. 29; <span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1633&#150;4</i>, 284). He was the owner of Harleian MS 978  (Bodl. Oxf., MS James 22).<br>
<br>Lapworth died in Bath on 24 May 1636, a year after resigning his Oxford lectureship. He was buried in the church of St Peter and St Paul, Bath.<br>
