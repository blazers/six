<span class="headword">Matilda</span>, duchess of Saxony  (1156&#150;1189), <span class="occ">princess</span>, the third child and eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12949/', "Henry II, king of England")</script>, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8618/', "Eleanor of Aquitaine")</script>, was baptized in the church of the Holy Trinity, Aldgate, by Archbishop Theobald of Canterbury (<i>d</i>. 1161). She had four surviving brothers: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12957/', "Henry (1155&#150;1183)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23498/', "Richard I (1157&#150;1199)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10533/', "Geoffrey, duke of Brittany (1158&#150;1186)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14841/', "John (1167&#150;1216)")</script>; and two sisters: Eleanor (<i>b</i>. 1161) and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14818/', "Joanna (1165&#150;1199)")</script>. In 1160 the queen took Matilda to join the king in Normandy; they seem to have brought her back with them in January 1163. Early in 1165 an embassy came from the emperor, Frederick Barbarossa, to ask in marriage two of Henry's daughters, one for Frederick's son, the other for his cousin, Henry the Lion, duke of Saxony. Both couples were betrothed, but while Henry II appears to have dropped the project of a marriage between his daughter and Frederick's son, the marriage between Matilda and Henry went ahead. After visiting Normandy again, Matilda returned in the autumn of 1166. The earliest extant register of English tenants-in-chief and their holdings, still preserved in the <span class="roman">Red and Black Books of the Exchequer</span>, was probably compiled with a view to the assessment of the aid levied by the king for his daughter's marriage. In 1167 the duke sent envoys to fetch his bride. She sailed about Michaelmas from Dover to Normandy, and thence proceeded, probably after Christmas, to Germany. The duke met her at Minden, and they were married there by Bishop Werner in the cathedral church on 1 February 1168.<br>
<br>Henry the Lion was twenty-seven years older than Matilda; he had been married long before she was born, and divorced from his first wife in 1162. First cousin to the emperor, he was duke of Bavaria and Saxony. Brunswick was his main residence in Saxony; there the newly married couple held their wedding feast; and there their first child, Richenza, was born during her father's absence on pilgrimage in 1172. Two sons were born in the next eight years, probably in 1173 or 1174 and 1174 or 1175. Henry occupied a quasi-regal position in Saxony, and he laid much stress on the status conferred by his marriage to Matilda, who was referred to on a number of occasions as the daughter of a king and granddaughter of an empress. His power and its ruthless exercise had long aroused opposition among other lay and ecclesiastical magnates. In the late 1160s Frederick had been able and willing to mediate between the two groups, but after the ending of the papal schism in 1177 the opposition to Henry found renewed intensity, and this time Frederick, who had come to have his own quarrels with Henry, was not prepared to intervene. After Henry had refused to obey a series of summonses to assemblies at which charges against him were to be heard, he was outlawed for contumacy at an assembly at W&uuml;rzburg in January 1180 and his lands declared confiscated.<br>
<br>From the spring of 1180 there followed eighteen months of campaigning in Saxony, at the end of which Henry submitted to Frederick at Erfurt in November 1181. He regained his allodial possessions, but had to go into exile, not to return without Frederick's consent; the sources differ on whether a term was set for the exile and if so how long, and on whether Matilda was also exiled or joined Henry in exile voluntarily. The couple left the Reich in July 1182, accompanied by two of their sons; Lothar remained in Saxony, perhaps as a hostage. They reached Argentan in the summer of 1182, and soon afterwards their fourth son was born there. It was probably at this point that the troubadour Bertrand de Born met Matilda; he apostrophized her under the name Elena in two poems and praised her beauty and wit. On 12 June 1184 Matilda travelled to England, and in that year her fifth son, William, was born at Winchester. In November she was in London with her husband; at Christmas both were at Windsor with the king. In 1185 Henry and Matilda were allowed to return to Saxony, in part through the mediation of Henry II. In the spring of 1189 the emperor demanded that Henry the Lion should either accompany him on crusade, or go into exile again until his return. Henry again sought refuge in England, but Matilda remained at Brunswick and died there on 28 June. She was buried at the church of St Blaise and St Giles, Brunswick. Her husband returned to Brunswick after Frederick's death; he died there in 1195 and was buried at her right hand, &#145;choosing to sleep beside her in death as in life&#146;  (Pertz, 231). In the early thirteenth century their tombs were provided with stone effigies, probably as part of a larger project for a family memorial put in hand by their son Otto IV (<i>d</i>. 1218). Arnold of L&uuml;beck called Matilda &#145;a most religious woman, whose memory is of note before God and man, whose good works and sweet disposition enhanced the lustre of the long royal line whence she sprang; a woman of profound piety, of wondrous sympathy for the afflicted, a great distributor of alms, and, being given to prayers, a most devoted frequenter of masses, of which she had many sung&#146;  (<span class="italic">Arnoldi chronica Slavorum</span>, 11&#150;12).<br>
<br>Little is known of the part Matilda played in the government of her husband's territories, although she acted in effect as regent in his absence, for example during his crusade in 1172 and in the last few months of her life. She acted not only as a transmitter of Anglo-French cultural impulses to the court at Brunswick, which, certainly in the reign of her son, Otto IV, was more advanced than most princely courts in the Reich, but was also closely associated with Henry in his efforts to build up Brunswick as a princely residence, with a palace, cathedral-like church, and art treasures. Most prominent of these is the &#145;Evangeliary of Henry the Lion&#146;, now in Wolfenb&uuml;ttel, in which Matilda appears both in the dedicatory miniature and in a further miniature depicting Christ crowning (in what sense is disputed) herself and Henry the Lion, surrounded by their ancestors.<br>
<br>Matilda's eldest child, Richenza, is almost certainly identical with the daughter whom the English chroniclers call Matilda, who was left in Normandy with her grandparents in 1185, returned to England with them in 1186, was married, first, in 1189, to Geoffroy, count of Perche, and second, between 1200 and 1205, to Enguerrand (III) de Coucy, and died before 1210. The eldest son, Henry, assumed the title of duke of Saxony on his father's death, became count palatine of the Rhine in 1196, and died in 1227 survived by two daughters, Irmgard and Agnes, his only son, Henry, having predeceased him. His brother Otto, nominated by his uncle Richard I as earl of York in 1190 and count of Poitou in 1196, was elected emperor in 1198 in opposition to the Staufer candidate, crowned at Rome in 1209, excommunicated and declared deposed the following year, and died childless in 1218, having lost all royal power after the defeat of the Welf and Angevin forces at Bouvines in 1214. Lothar died in 1190. The boy born at Argentan in 1182 is never heard of again, and presumably died very young. Matilda's youngest child, the English-born William of Winchester, died in 1213. He and his wife, Helen, daughter of Waldemar I of Denmark, had a son named Otto, who became sole heir male of the family on the death of his uncle Henry in 1227. From him are descended the ducal house of Brunswick-L&uuml;neburg, and the British royal house of Windsor.<br>
