<span class="headword">Scrafton,  Luke</span>  (1732&#150;1770?), <span class="occ">East India Company servant</span>, was born on 22 March 1732 in the City of London, the son of Richard Scrafton, surgeon, and his wife Susannah (<i>d</i>. 1771/2). He was appointed a writer in the East India Company's Bengal service in March 1746 and was made an assistant at the Dacca factory on 20 October 1749. In 1751 he was promoted to the rank of factor and joined the council at Dacca, where he remained until 1756 when the nawab of Bengal, Siraj ud-Daula, turned against the company. The factory surrendered to his forces and Scrafton and other company servants were held for a period as prisoners. The nawab's capture of Calcutta was reversed by Robert Clive in January 1757, and in the following month Scrafton acted as one of two emissaries to the nawab; two months later he was, at Clive's request, sent to the durbar, the nawab's court, at Murshidabad, to assist William Watts (who was later briefly president of the council in Bengal). Scrafton's knowledge of Persian and his diplomatic skills were put to good use in the conspiracy against Siraj ud-Daula, and he was present when Siraj ud-Daula was defeated by Clive at Plassey in June 1757. After Plassey, Scrafton succeeded Watts at the durbar and found himself at the heart of the changed political environment in which the new nawab, Mir Jafar, and the British found themselves. In addition to his official activities (and having reaped a substantial financial reward from the change of nawab), he became involved in revenue farming under fictitious names and made loans to <i>zamindars</i> at high rates. His departure from the durbar in August 1758 coincided with a particularly demanding visit to Calcutta by the nawab, during which Scrafton acted as interpreter; in the months that followed, however, he ceased to be involved in mainstream affairs and was critical of Clive. In 1759 he left Calcutta for Madras on account of ill health, and eventually returned to England.<br>
<br>In England, Scrafton engaged in intellectual pursuits and corresponded with the historian Robert Orme, from whom he sought advice. In 1763 he published <span class="italic">Reflections on the government, etc of Indostan; with a short sketch of the history of Bengal, from the year 1739 to 1756; and an account of the English affairs to 1758</span>. This work, praised by Voltaire, was one of several such works which appeared in this period and which served to bring events in India to the attention of a wider audience than hitherto. In the same year Scrafton toured Europe, but the politics of the East India Company increasingly occupied him. Although he was not on close personal terms with Clive he supported Clive's cause, and served as a director of the company between 1765 and 1768; for most of this period Clive was in Bengal and Scrafton was an important representative of his interest within the court of directors. He also defended Clive against accusations made by Henry Vansittart&#151;a former governor of Bengal with whom Scrafton apparently once almost fought a duel&#151;in <span class="italic">Observations on Mr Vansittart's Narrative</span>, published in 1766. His skills as a propagandist seem also to have been utilized by the directors in the periodical the <span class="italic">East India Observer</span>, in the same year.<br>
<br>In September 1769 Scrafton sailed for India as Clive's representative on a supervisory commission designed to improve the administration of the company's affairs. The <i>Aurora</i>, which carried the supervisors (among them Henry Vansittart), was not heard from again after it left the Cape of Good Hope on 27 December, and it would appear that the ship foundered in heavy seas following a decision by the captain to navigate the Mozambique Channel in bad weather.<br>
