<span class="headword">Ullmann,  Stephen</span>  (1914&#150;1976), <span class="occ">linguistic scholar</span>, was born on 13 June 1914 in Hungary, where his father, Istv&aacute;n Ullmann, was a senior civil servant. Ullmann read modern languages at the University of Budapest, from where he obtained a doctorate at the early age of twenty-two. In 1939 he married Susan G&aacute;sp&aacute;r, with whom he had one son (Michael) and two daughters (Diana and Patricia). Stephen and Susan Ullmann left Hungary for the United Kingdom in 1939 and became permanently domiciled there as British citizens.<br>
<br>From 1940 to 1946 Ullmann was employed by the BBC Monitoring Service. In 1946 he joined the University of Glasgow as lecturer in Romance philology and general linguistics, and was promoted to a senior lectureship in 1950, having been awarded the degree of DLitt in 1949. From Glasgow he moved to the University of Leeds, where he was successively professor of Romance philology (1953&#150;64) and of French language and Romance philology (1964&#150;8). From 1968 until his death he held the chair of Romance languages at the University of Oxford, and was simultaneously fellow of Trinity College. His international reputation earned him invitations to undertake lecture tours in many European countries, in  circumstances are unknown. North America, and in India, and he held visiting professorships at the universities of Toronto (1964 and 1966) and Michigan (1965), and at the Australian National University (1974). From 1970 to 1976 he was president of the Philological Society.<br>
<br>Ullmann's scholarly interests were broad and his knowledge encyclopaedic, but his research and publications fell into two main areas. The first was semantics, to which he had been introduced by one of his teachers at the University of Budapest, Zolt&aacute;n Gombocz, and in which he did much pioneering work at a time when the study of meaning was somewhat neglected by theoretical linguists. Following the posthumous publication of Ferdinand de Saussure's <span class="italic">Cours de linguistique g&eacute;n&eacute;rale</span> in 1916, theoretical linguistics, until then almost exclusively historical in its orientation, became primarily synchronic and descriptive. Recognizing this, Ullmann justifiably contended that semantics had largely escaped the impact of this revolution, since it continued to be concerned above all with the study of changes in meaning. The one significant exception to this generalization, he observed, was the development in Germany by Jost Trier and others, in the 1920s and the early 1930s, of the theory of semantic fields. It was largely through Ullmann's publications some two decades later that this approach to the study of meaning became more widely known to Western scholarship.<br>
<br>Ullmann's approach to semantics was first set out at length in 1951 in <span class="italic">The Principles of Semantics</span>. There he presents his view of the essence of the subject at that point in its development, and maintains a balance between descriptive and historical aspects. It had been preceded earlier in the same year by a more popular book on meaning and language, <span class="italic">Words and their Use</span>, which avoids discussion of theory.<br>
<br>Following closely on <span class="italic">Principles</span>, Ullmann's <span class="italic">Pr&eacute;cis de s&eacute;mantique fran&ccedil;aise</span> (1953) makes explicit its aim to present the principles of semantics to a wider public by applying them to French, although the audience envisaged, unlike that of <span class="italic">Words and their Use</span>, is clearly academic. This time the balance was tipped much more towards the synchronic side. Despite its apparently modest intentions, this book contains much that is new in comparison with its predecessor and develops considerably further some of the ideas contained in the author's earlier writings&#151;notably on synonymy, polysemy, and homonymy, and the problems involved in distinguishing between the last two of these. &#145;Motivation&#146; in language is also extensively discussed. Taking as his starting point Saussure's insistence on the essentially arbitrary nature of the linguistic sign, under which view the relationship between a word and its meaning is entirely conventional, Ullmann aims to show that, on the contrary, the meaning attached to a linguistic symbol can be motivated at three different levels&#151;the phonetic (in cases where it is possible to speak of onomatopoeia or sound symbolism), the morphological (where complex forms are understood from a knowledge of the meaning of their component parts), and the semantic (where words take on new meanings because of perceived similarities between entities, as when one speaks, for instance, of the &#145;head&#146; of an institution). A further point of discussion is the way in which it is possible to distinguish between &#145;intellectual&#146; and &#145;affective&#146; meaning, because of the existence in all languages of devices for conveying emotional overtones. Arguing that the presence of these various features occurs in different proportions in different languages, Ullmann developed his theory of semantic typology, showing in this context that French is typologically different from, say, German. Consideration of typology later led him to prepare a paper on semantic universals (1963).<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">Semantics: an Introduction to the Science of Meaning</span> (1962) there is less theoretical discussion, the book being intended mainly for non-specialists. The main themes of the two earlier books are taken up again, but discussed in language rather less technical. There is an attempt, too, to show how the subject had developed since the publication of his first major book, for Ullmann was always at pains to present his own theories in the broader context.<br>
<br>Somewhat unusually for a general linguist, Ullmann concerned himself extensively with language as used in literature as well as with what one might by contrast refer to as everyday, non-creative language. Many points in his books and articles on semantics are illustrated with quotations from literary works, especially poetry. Where such items occur, one is not far removed from a discussion of style. It is therefore not surprising that the second of his two principal research interests should be stylistics. Ullmann is sometimes held to have worked first in semantics and then turned his allegiance mainly to stylistics. In fact the two strands run in parallel throughout his published work, with articles in both spheres first appearing in the mid-1940s. The closeness of the two in his mind is symbolized by the titles of his two books of collected papers, <span class="italic">Language and Style</span> (1964) and <span class="italic">Meaning and Style</span> (1973). His stylistic work was first directed to French poetry, and there are early articles on Racine, Hugo, Leconte de Lisle, Vigny, and Musset. Later he turned his attention to the novel, and this is the subject of his two books <span class="italic">Style in the French Novel</span> (1957) and <span class="italic">The Image in the French Novel: Gide, Alain-Fournier, Proust, Camus</span> (1960). The first alternates between the treatment of a theme (for example, word order) over a number of novels and an analysis of some aspect of a single novel: in the book as a whole, twenty novels by seventeen authors, mostly belonging to the nineteenth century, are examined. In his work on style Ullmann aimed to construct a bridge between the type of stylistics which is concerned with the expressive resources of a language as a whole and the type which looks at the variety of the language that is the particular creation of a given author. His own studies, however, concentrate on the latter. In the first of the two books, he looked at the linguistic world presented in a single novel, while the second was more concerned with the linguistic world of an author's total output.<br>
<br>In both his domains of endeavour&#151;semantics and stylistics&#151;Ullmann was something of a pioneer. This was not in the sense that he was a creator of the disciplines, but in the sense that, in the first case, he did much to revive an important and neglected area of linguistics, and, in the second, he did much to strengthen a fledgeling subject. He was zealous in promoting both, seeing the former as &#145;the youngest branch of modern linguistics&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Principles of Semantics</span>, 1) and the latter as the &#145;new science of style&#146;  (<span class="italic">Style in the French Novel</span>, vii). He did not strive solely for novelty or originality. His extraordinarily wide reading had given him not only an exceptional knowledge of those who had contributed studies on topics germane to his interests, but also an appreciation of the value of their work. His own research was never conducted in isolation, for he had total familiarity with the work of his contemporaries. When reviewing the work of others, he always attempted, even where he disagreed with the trend of a book's argument, to highlight what was positive and insightful.<br>
<br>Stephen Ullmann died on 10 January 1976 of a coronary thrombosis in the Evans Lane post office, near his home in Kidlington, Oxfordshire. He was described by those who knew him as a dominating presence who at the same time was shy and modest, as a man who was generous with his time to students and colleagues, as a brilliant and inspiring lecturer who yet suffered from stage fright, and as an academic who worked in fields that encouraged controversy but who made no enemies.<br>
