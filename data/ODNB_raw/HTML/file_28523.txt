<span class="headword">Walkinshaw,  Clementine</span>, styled countess of Albestroff  (<em>c.</em>1720&#150;1802), <span class="occ">mistress of Prince Charles Edward Stuart</span>, was the youngest of ten children, all daughters, of John Walkinshaw (1671&#150;1731) of Barrowfield and his wife, Katharine (1683&#150;1780), daughter of Sir Hugh Paterson of Bannockburn. Clementine was a staunch Roman Catholic and supporter of the exiled Stuarts.<br>
<br>Detail of her early life hangs on tradition and conjecture: she was almost certainly named after Clementina Sobieska, wife of James Francis Edward Stuart, the Old Pretender, but no firm evidence supports claims that she was born in Rome and Clementina was her godmother, or that as a child she was the &#145;little playmate&#146; of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5145/', "Charles Edward Louis Philip Stuart (1720&#150;1788)")</script>, Stuart claimant to the throne. It is not certain that she was with Charles while he was in Glasgow in December 1745, but they met a month later at Bannockburn House, home of Clementine's uncle, when the prince fell ill, and according to Lord Elcho she became his mistress. Tradition in the Lake District of England claims they had a daughter, Clementina Johannes Sobieski Douglas (a surname used by Charles), known as the Finsthwaite princess. She lived near Newby Bridge, but died young, and her grave can be seen in Finsthwaite churchyard.<br>
<br>Following the prince's return to France, Clementine Walkinshaw's relations with her family turned cold, and for no apparent reason she was ostracized for thirty-two years. The suggestion that she met the prince again in London when he came to England in 1750, a story that features in Sir Walter Scott's <span class="italic">Redgauntlet</span>, has been dismissed by Leo Berry.<br>
<br>According to a memoir laid before the French king, Louis XV, in 1774, the prince made Clementine promise at Bannockburn to join him if he sent for her. He did so in 1752 as she was about to enter a religious order in the Low Countries. Since her sister was a member of the household of the princess dowager of Wales, English Jacobites suspected Clementine of being a British spy, and violently opposed her joining Charles: he insisted, however, and they were reunited in Paris in June or July 1752. When the Elibank plot to capture the Hanoverian royal family was betrayed later that year, Clementine was blamed, although the real &#145;mole&#146; was Alexander Macdonnell of Glengarry, also known as Pickle the Spy, who was not exposed until 150 years later by Andrew Lang in his book <span class="italic">Pickle the Spy</span>. Many bitter and disillusioned supporters now abandoned the Jacobite cause.<br>
<br>Charles and Clementine settled in &#145;a preti house&#146; in the rue des Vernopeles in Ghent, and later in Li&egrave;ge as Count and Countess de Johnson. At first they were happy together, and even Alexander Macdonnell admitted that &#145;the Pretender keeps her well and seems very fond of her&#146;  (Lang, 213). A daughter, Charlotte, born in October 1753, was baptized in the church of Ste Marie-des-Fonts in Li&egrave;ge on the 29th of that month. Sir Compton Mackenzie asserts that the couple's first serious quarrel was over Charlotte's baptism into the Catholic faith because Charles had converted to protestantism in London.<br>
<br>Jacobites continued to blame Clementine for every folly the prince committed and for every secret leaked to London; at the same time spies hunted the pair down relentlessly, until they were forced to abandon Li&egrave;ge for secret hiding places, and eventually the relative safety of Basel in Switzerland. There they lived, modestly but comfortably, as an English doctor named Thomson and his wife, but when their presence in Basel became widely known they returned to Li&egrave;ge in 1756. Later they moved to the Ch&acirc;teau de Carlsbourg, near Sedan, which belonged to the prince's uncle, the duke of Bouillon. James Francis Edward Stuart, the Old Pretender, tried to persuade his son to abandon Clementine and marry, but to his credit Charles refused, bringing about the final rift between father and son.<br>
<br>Charles subjected Clementine to outbursts of temper and beatings, and eventually, on the night of 22 July 1760, while he was absent, she took her child and fled. The prince was beside himself with anger, not because his mistress had left him but at the loss of his child, his beloved Pouponne, as he called her. With the connivance of Louis XV and the prince's father Clementine had taken refuge in the convent of the Visitation de Ste Marie, in the rue du Bac in Paris, and had no intention of returning. Anger, humiliation, and grief at losing his child led to physical and mental collapse, and for almost five years Charles scarcely left Carlsbourg. He paid Clementine nothing and, taking the style countess of Albestroff, she lived for twenty-four years with her daughter in near penury at convents around Paris. The Pretender in Rome gave her a pension of 10,000 livres, and after his death in 1766 she received half that amount from Charles's brother Henry, Cardinal York. But the price was high: Henry forced her to sign an affidavit on 9 March 1767 swearing she was never married to Charles, a declaration which she withdrew almost immediately. In 1772 the prince married Louisa, countess of Albany. Charlotte worked ceaselessly to have the world accept that her parents were husband and wife under the law of Scotland. Only ill health put an end to her pursuit of the claim. In 1784 the prince sent for his daughter, declared her legitimate, and gave her the title duchess of Albany. Within a month of joining him in Florence Charlotte persuaded her father to provide for Clementine.<br>
<br>Charlotte kept in close touch with her mother, writing as many as 100 letters to her in a single year, and after Charles's death in 1788 did all she could to help her. At the French Revolution in 1789 the French cut off Charlotte's financial help, and Clementine had to flee to Switzerland for safety. Then in November that same year Charlotte died, leaving Clementine to live out a lonely life of genteel poverty at Fribourg, in Switzerland. She died there in November 1802, and was buried at the town's St Nicholas's Cathedral.<br>
