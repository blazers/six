<span class="headword">Cleary,  Thomas Stanislaus</span>  (1851&#150;1898), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born in Dublin. The details of his early life are not known, but in 1878 he became editor of the <span class="italic">Clare Independent</span>, a paper published in Ennis, co. Clare, which claimed the support of the Roman Catholic church and advocated nationalist politics. Cleary was active in the &#145;land war&#146;, and in 1879 clashed with members of the Catholic clergy who had challenged his claim to local leadership. Dublin Castle believed that he was the paid secretary of the Clare Land League, and that, by the general tone of his paper and his speeches, he excited people to commit acts of violence. Despite this, his obituary in the <span class="italic">Clare Journal</span> claimed that Cleary had friends &#145;among those whose political views were utterly opposed to his&#146;.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Weekly Nation</span> considered Cleary to be an accomplished journalist and ballad writer who was a &#145;veritable encyclopaedia&#146; of knowledge  (9 July 1898). He wrote a pamphlet addressed to the Clare Tenants' Defence Association and a large number of poems on nationalist themes. His <span class="italic">Songs of the Land War</span> (1888) was dedicated to William O'Brien. Many of his poems were printed as leaflets: his &#145;The Lament of Luggacurran&#146;, first published in <span class="italic">United Ireland</span> and reprinted as a leaflet by Irish Canadians, was thrown into Lord Lansdowne's carriage on his visit to Ottawa in April 1887. Cleary also wrote <span class="italic">Twitterings at Twilight</span> (1883), which contains a number of rather poor poems in the style of Percy French. He contributed to the <span class="italic">Weekly Nation</span> and <span class="italic">United Ireland</span>, and also wrote for the Irish-American <span class="italic">Boston Pilot</span>, edited by Patrick Ford. In 1882 he published <span class="italic">Shin-Fain, or, Ourselves Alone, a Drama of the Exhibition</span>, the title containing a very early use of the words &#145;Shin-Fain&#146; (later Sinn F&eacute;in). Cleary had two sons, but his private life is otherwise obscure. He died in Killaloe, co. Clare, on 1 July 1898, and was buried in Glasnevin cemetery, Dublin, on 3 July.<br>
