<span class="headword">Prince,  John Critchley</span>  (1808&#150;1866), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 21 June 1808 at Wigan, Lancashire, and baptized on 11 August 1808 at Ebenezer Methodist New Connexion Chapel, Bolton-le-Moors, the eldest among eight or more children of Joseph Prince (1788/9&#150;1854) and his wife, Nancy Critchley (1787/8&#150;1868). Joseph Prince was a maker of &#145;reeds&#146; (instruments of lath and wire used by hand-loom weavers for separating threads); he was also a drunkard and a wanderer. John Prince learned to read and write at a Baptist Sunday school, but at nine he started reed-making for fourteen to sixteen hours a day with his father; his few hours of leisure were spent reading. He improvidently married Ann Orme (<i>bap</i>. 1808, <i>d</i>. 1858) of Hyde, near Manchester, when they were both eighteen, and by 1830 they had two daughters and a son. From 1828 Prince earned tiny sums from verses contributed to <span class="italic">The Phoenix</span> and many other local periodicals.<br>
<br>In 1830 Prince spent seven fruitless months seeking work in northern France, at St Quentin in Picardy, and Paris, and underwent extraordinary hardships on his homeward journey; meanwhile his wife and children were in Wigan poorhouse. Reunited, they slept on straw in an unfurnished garret in a court off Long Millgate, Manchester, and would have starved if Ann had not worked as a power-loom weaver while Prince was unemployed; even so, their youngest baby died and its flesh was putrid before they could raise money for a funeral. Prince found work as a reed-maker for a while at Ashton under Lyne, then returned to Hyde. There, at &#145;Flowery Field&#146; in 1836, he established a small club of working-class poets, the &#145;Literary Twelve&#146;, and in Hyde in 1837 he was prosaically employed in a cotton mill, twelve hours a day for 18<i>s</i>. a week (when fully employed). Between 1838 and 1840 he worked as a yarn warehouseman.<br>
<br>Prince's <span class="italic">Hours with the Muses</span>, printed for and sold by the author, ran into three successively enlarged editions in 1841&#150;2 and attracted attention in London as well as Manchester, giving Prince hopes of making money by poetry. He now had a small shop in Long Millgate, Manchester, and was secretary of a short-lived Lancashire Literary Association which met at The Sun inn, opposite the shop, and where it seems he drank the profits of trade and verse. Promised a government post, he wrote on 22 June 1842 of being &#145;feasted, flattered, lionized, and promise-crammed for twelve months&#146;  (Procter, <span class="italic">Memorials</span>, 180), but the &#145;post&#146; was a postman's job at 15<i>s</i>. a week in Southampton which he left after a few days. Robert Peel refused his application for a librarianship but sent him &pound;50 from the royal bounty in October 1842 and in the same year <span class="italic">Bradshaw's Manchester Journal</span> paid him for cheerful articles describing the &#145;rambles of a rhymester&#146; in search of work.<br>
<br>The shop failed and was relinquished at the end of 1842. Prince resumed work as a reed-maker, at 20<i>s</i>. a week if fully employed, and found intermittent employment in Manchester, Blackburn, and Ashton under Lyne. His wife was disabled with rheumatism but worked in factories when she could. For six years from 1845 he earned &pound;12 p.a. as editor of the <span class="italic">Ancient Shepherds' Quarterly Magazine</span>, the journal of an Ashton under Lyne friendly society; he was awarded &pound;40 from the Royal Literary Fund in 1844 and another &pound;20 in 1846. A &#145;Prince testimonial&#146; was established by well-wishers in 1846 to give financial help, &#145;but the committee found that intemperance was his weakness&#146;  (Lithgow, 187), despite his taking the pledge more than once and writing verses for temperance journals.<br>
<br>Prince's <span class="italic">Dreams and Realities in Verse and Prose</span> (1847), <span class="italic">The Poetic Rosary</span> (1850), <span class="italic">Autumn Leaves</span> (1856), and <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Poems</span> (1861), were printed for the author, and were sold by him from his home through what were little better than begging letters to friends, acquaintances, and strangers. Reed-making was in decline as machinery supplanted manual labour, Prince's addiction to poetry and/or drink deterred potential employers, and his income from poetry was at best precarious. Rent on a succession of cottages in Ashton was often in arrears until in 1851 the Princes were &#145;sold up, dish and spoon, goods, working tools, everything&#146;  (Lithgow, 212), and moved in with their married daughter Elizabeth in Hyde and later in Ashton under Lyne. In 1855 another daughter died, leaving two infants in the Princes' care. Prince tramped widely and usually fruitlessly in search of work and was often disabled by inflamed eyes, severe rheumatism, or drink. He tried to live by his pen but survived only by scrounging.<br>
<br>Prince's wife died in September 1858; one of his daughters took care of the orphaned grandchildren and, after a spell of wandering, Prince married Ann Taylor (<i>b</i>. 1813/14) on 30 March 1862 at St Mary's parish church, Mottram in Longdendale, Lancashire. Ann was illiterate, so perhaps to save her from humiliation, or perhaps as a joke, Prince too signed the marriage register with a mark. Fortunately, she was more careful, thrifty, and tidy than Prince's first wife&#151;soon after the wedding Prince had a stroke from which he never fully recovered and they were both out of work during the cotton famine. By autumn 1865 Prince was dependent on tobacco and drink, almost blind, and partially paralysed. He died on 5 May 1866 at Brook Street, Hyde, and was buried in St George's churchyard, Hyde.<br>
<br>Prince was about 5 feet 10 inches tall, &#145;of slight physique, but wiry&#146;, his head unusually large, his neck narrow  (Lithgow, 109, 120). He disapproved of socialism and Chartism and his verse rarely touches on social issues; it consists mostly of anodyne lyrics on religion and nature, and, considering the circumstances of his life, is astonishingly sunny and optimistic.<br>
