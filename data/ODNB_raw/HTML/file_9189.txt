<span class="headword">Farre,  Frederic John</span>  (1804&#150;1886), <span class="occ">physician</span>, second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9190/', "John Richard Farre (1775&#150;1862)")</script>, physician and ophthalmologist, was born in Charterhouse Square, London, on 16 December 1804. He was educated at Charterhouse School, where he was gold medallist in 1821, and captain in 1822. He entered St John's College, Cambridge, with a foundation scholarship, and graduated in 1827. After studying medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, he graduated MA in 1830, and MD in 1837. In 1831 he was appointed lecturer in botany at St Bartholomew's, and from 1854 to 1876 he was lecturer on materia medica. On 23 July 1836 he was elected assistant physician to his father at the Royal London Ophthalmic Hospital, and from 1843 until his death, he was full physician. He married Julia Fanny, daughter of Kensington Lewis, on 12 September 1848; she and their two daughters survived him.<br>
<br>Farre was elected to the Royal College of Physicians in 1838, and held the offices of censor in 1841, 1842, and 1854, lecturer on materia medica from 1843 to 1845, councillor from 1846 to 1848 and 1866 to 1867, examiner in 1861&#150;2 and 1866&#150;7, treasurer from 1868 to 1883, and vice-president in 1885. Before he resigned the office of treasurer he presented the college with a copious manuscript history of its proceedings, compiled by himself. He was one of the editors of the first <span class="italic">British Pharmacopoeia</span>, published by the General Medical Council (1864), and also of an abridgement of Jonathan Pereira's <span class="italic">Materia medica</span>, published in 1865 with later editions in 1872 and 1874. His paper &#145;Treatment of acute pericarditis with opium&#146; in <span class="italic">St. Bartholomew's Hospital Reports</span> (1866) recommended abandoning the harmful mercurial treatment then in fashion.<br>
<br>Farre was a successful lecturer and teacher, being clear and simple in style, and agreeable in manner. He had considerable private practice for many years in Montague Street, Russell Square. In 1870 he was obliged through age to retire from active work, though he was still able to attend the Royal College of Physicians. He died at his home, 35 Elsham Road, Kensington, London, on 10 November 1886.<br>
