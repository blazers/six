<span class="headword">Petrus</span> <span class="st"> [St Petrus]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 605<span class="mult">x</span>11), <span class="occ">abbot of St Peter's and St Paul's, Canterbury (later St Augustine's)</span>, was both a monk and a priest, and was one of the companions of St Augustine on his mission to England in 596&#150;7. Probably in late 600, Augustine sent him in company with Laurence, afterwards archbishop of Canterbury, to Pope Gregory to announce the success of the mission and to lay before him certain questions [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93690', "Gregorian mission")</script>]. He brought back the pope's replies in 601. &AElig;thelberht, king of Kent, was building the monastery of St Peter and St Paul at the time of Augustine's death, and Petrus was appointed its first abbot. Bede is the principal witness for Petrus, probably deriving his information from Albinus, abbot of St Peter's and St Paul's, via the priest Nothelm. He recounts that Petrus was drowned in a creek of the sea at &#145;Amfleat&#146; (Ambleteuse), a short distance north of Boulogne, while fulfilling a mission to Gaul on which he had been sent by &AElig;thelberht. He was given an unworthy burial by the local inhabitants, but a heavenly light appeared above his grave every night, revealing to the people that it was a saint who was buried there. Having discovered his identity, they removed his body and buried it with due honour in a church in Boulogne.<br>
<br>According to the Benedictine martyrology, Petrus's death occurred on 30 December, though the English martyrology (reproduced by the Bollandists) places it on 6 January. William Stubbs suggested that this may have been the day of his translation. The year of his death probably depends on that assigned to Augustine, since Thomas Elmham, the early fifteenth-century chronicler of St Augustine's (as St Peter's and St Paul's became in 978), states that Petrus died one year, seven months, and three weeks after Augustine. Augustine's death occurred at some time between 604 and 609. Elmham gives an epitaph on Petrus. There is an unprinted and unreliable life of Petrus, written in the twelfth century by Eadmer, in Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS 371, fol. 416.<br>
