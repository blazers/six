</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Oates,  Lawrence Edward Grace</span>  (1880&#150;1912), <span class="occ">Antarctic explorer</span>, was born on 17 March 1880 at Putney, London, one of the four children, and the elder son, of William Edward Oates (1841&#150;1896), gentleman, of Gestingthorpe Hall, Essex, and his wife, Caroline Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Buckton, of Meanwood, Leeds. He spent two years at Eton College but was withdrawn with ill health and was afterwards educated privately. In 1898 he was gazetted to the 3rd West Yorkshire (militia) regiment and in April 1900 he was commissioned into the regular army, and posted to the 6th (Inniskilling) dragoons. He served with distinction in the South African War and was severely wounded in the thigh on 6 March 1901. He was mentioned in dispatches and invalided home, but returned to his unit before the end of the year and was promoted lieutenant on 2 February 1902. He afterwards served with his regiment in Ireland, Egypt (where he became captain and adjutant in 1906), and India.<br>
<br>Oates was devoted to hunting and steeplechasing and was happiest when working with horses, but he was also a keen yachtsman and had a thirst for adventure. When army life in India began to pall he applied to join Captain Robert Falcon Scott's second Antarctic expedition and in March 1910 learned that he had been accepted. He had offered to contribute &pound;1000 to expedition funds but it was for his expertise with horses that he was taken on, and he was put in charge of the nineteen ponies that were vital to the south pole attempt.<br>
<br>Nearly 6 feet tall with a strong frame, Oates was an independent-minded character with little time for ceremony or pretence. He arrived at the expedition ship <i>Terra Nova</i> in London in the spring of 1910 wearing an old raincoat and was scrutinized by the crew who, according to the Irishman Tom Crean, &#145;never for a moment thought he was an officer, for they were usually so smart. We made up our minds he was a farmer.&#146; Crean added: &#145;but oh! he was a gentleman, quite a gentleman, and always a gentleman!&#146;  (Gregor, 34). As the only cavalry officer on an expedition staffed primarily by naval men, Oates won respect by his hard work and he grew to be more popular with the seamen than perhaps any other officer. Such was his contribution to the <i>Terra Nova</i> that he was kept on the ship for the voyage south, instead of being sent to oversee the purchase of the expedition ponies in Siberia.<br>
<br>In retrospect this was a grave mistake, and when Oates first saw the animals, at Lyttelton, New Zealand, he was dismayed at the selections made. Scott, however, was inclined to think that he was too pessimistic and there was considerable tension between them as a result. News that a Norwegian expedition was also bound for the south pole sharpened Oates's misgivings about the British undertaking and of Roald Amundsen he wrote: &#145;If he gets to the Pole first we shall come home with our tails between our legs and no mistake &hellip; I myself think these Norskies are a very tough lot&#146;  (Limb and Cordingley, 123). Rather ominously he noted that they had 200 dogs: the British expedition had 32.<br>
<br>Once ashore at Cape Evans, Oates urged that the ponies be worked hard in preparation for the polar journey, but Scott would not allocate the necessary manpower. The animals struggled during the depot-laying expedition across the great ice barrier (now the Ross Ice Shelf) during January and February 1911, and Oates spent the polar winter striving to build up their strength. Known on the expedition as &#145;Titus&#146;, or &#145;the Soldier&#146;, he was conservative in outlook and naturally taciturn. He affected a dislike of foreigners, an indifference to society in general and women in particular (he was unmarried), and preferred long periods in the relative isolation of the stables to life in the cramped expedition hut. But for all his austerity and reserve he was well liked, with &#145;a fund of dry humour, and a store of anecdote from which gems would drop at the most unexpected moments&#146;  (Ponting, 161). His care of the ponies was universally admired. More than most he suffered from the perpetual darkness and he wrote to his mother, to whom he was extremely close, that he had no intention of remaining for a second winter if it could be avoided.<br>
<br>As the southern journey approached, Oates's frustration with Scott reached its pitch. The failure of the expedition's two experimental motor sledges put extra pressure on the ailing ponies and in a letter to his mother on 24 October 1911, Oates complained: &#145;it is perfectly wretched starting off with a lot of cripples &hellip; I dislike Scott intensely and would chuck the whole thing if it was not that we are a British expedition and must beat those Norwegians&#146;  (Limb and Cordingley, 169). But he later added: &#145;please remember that when a man is having a hard time he says hard things about other people which he would regret afterwards&#146;  (ibid., 173).<br>
<br>After the main polar party set out across the ice barrier on 1 November, Scott began to appreciate better the true extent of the ponies' failings and of Oates's achievement in bringing them so far. The animals performed their task of transporting loads across the barrier and when the last was shot, at the foot of the Beardmore Glacier on 9 December, a load was lifted from Oates's shoulders. On new year's eve, sitting in Scott's tent high on the polar plateau, he unusually took the lead in the conversation and talked openly for hours about his home and horses and life in the army. One of those present, Lieutenant Edward Evans, later recalled:<blockquote>At length Captain Scott reached out and affectionately seized him in the way that was itself so characteristic of our leader, and said, &#145;You funny old thing, you have quite come out of your shell, Soldier. Do you know, we have all sat here talking for nearly four hours?&#146; (Evans, &#145;Captain Oates&#146;, 626)</blockquote>On 3 January 1912 Scott announced a five-man team for the pole. Along with Dr Edward Adrian Wilson, Lieutenant Henry Robertson Bowers, Petty Officer Edgar Evans, and Scott himself, it included Oates, who was selected for his strength and toughness. Scott must also have felt that he deserved the honour because of his work with the ponies, and as a representative of the army. In a letter to his mother, to be taken back with the last returning party, Oates was restrained in his reaction to the news, but wrote emotionally about his longing for his home and family. Dr Edward Atkinson, leader of the team that had turned back on 21 December, thought that by then Oates did not want to go on. His feet were wet and cold and he was troubled by his old war wound, and gave the impression of someone &#145;who knew he was done&#151;his face showed him to be and the way he went along&#146;  (Limb and Cordingley, 194). On 15 January, about 30 miles from the pole, Oates wrote that he &#145;felt very depressed and homesick&#146;  (Huntford, 512). Scott's team reached the pole on 18 January 1912 and Oates was ungrudging in his respect for the Norwegians who had beaten them there (on 14 December 1911): they seemed to have had, he noted, &#145;a comfortable trip with their dog teams, very different from our wretched man-hauling&#146;  (Limb and Cordingley, 196).<br>
<br>The return journey was from the outset a struggle for survival, and after the death of Edgar Evans on 17 February 1912 Oates was the principal cause for concern. From 26 February to 2 March the minimum temperatures dipped below -30 &deg;F every day, and on the latter date Oates revealed to Dr Edward Wilson his badly frostbitten feet. By 5 March they were in a &#145;wretched condition&#146; and although he never complained, he had become, in Scott's words, &#145;a terrible hindrance&#146; to the others  (Scott, <span class="italic">Diaries</span>, vol. 2, 5 and 6 March 1912). On 10 March, Oates asked Wilson if he &#145;had a chance&#146;, to which Wilson replied that he did not know, and Scott recorded: &#145;In point of fact he has none&#146;  (ibid., 10 March 1912). In fighting for his own life Oates risked jeopardizing the survival of his companions and Scott wrote on 11 March: &#145;he is a brave fine fellow and understands the situation, but he practically asked for advice&#151;nothing could be said but to urge him to march as long as he could&#146;  (ibid., 11 March 1912). Scott, however, compelled Wilson to give to each man thirty opium tablets from the medicine case, &#145;the means of ending our troubles&#146;  (ibid.). They were not used. At lunch on 15 March Oates proposed that the others should leave him behind in his sleeping-bag, but they persuaded him to go on. He woke next morning, 16 March 1912, and according to Scott:<blockquote>It was blowing a blizzard; he said I am just going outside and may be some time. He went out into the blizzard and we have not seen him since &hellip; We knew that poor Oates was walking to his death but though we tried to dissuade him we knew it was the act of a brave man and an English gentleman. (ibid., 16/17 March 1912)</blockquote>His thoughts were of his regiment and, lastly, his mother: &#145;he did not&#151;would not give up hope till the very end&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Oates's three companions made only about 18 miles before their final camp at 79&deg;50' S on 19 March, where they died about ten days later. Their tent was found by the relief expedition led by Edward Atkinson on 12 November 1912 and a cairn was built over it, commemorating also Evans and Oates. Scott's diary revealed what had happened to the polar party and the relief expedition travelled two days south in a vain search for Oates's body. As near as they could judge to the site of his death they built a memorial cairn. At the burial service on 12 November Scott's moving account of Oates's death was read aloud and from this point onwards the legend of his heroism spread. His parting words became familiar to successive generations of his countrymen and his noble deed an inspiration. R. C. K. Ensor, in his <span class="italic">England, 1870&#150;1914</span> (1936), saw the praise reaped by Oates in Edwardian England as indicating the shifting moral emphasis of the time  (p. 553), and in 1961 the lord chancellor, Viscount Kilmuir, arguing in a debate on the <span class="roman">Suicide Bill</span> for a more sympathetic approach, noted that Captain Oates &#145;commands the respect and admiration of us all&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5L</span>, 2 March 1961, col. 247).<br>
<br>In a less romantic age Oates's tragic end has become key evidence in the historical inquiry conducted into Scott's leadership of the expedition, and his death has been portrayed not as an act of heroic self-sacrifice so much as of suicide brought on by unbearable pain. But it is the original interpretation that endures, encapsulated in the inscription left by the relief expedition at his memorial cairn:<blockquote>Hereabouts died a very gallant gentleman, Captain L. E. G. Oates of the Inniskilling Dragoons. In March, 1912, returning from the Pole, he walked willingly to his death in a blizzard, to try and save his comrades, beset by hardships. (Evans, <span class="italic">South with Scott</span>, 254)</blockquote>The Oates Coast (69&deg;30' S, 159&deg;00' E) and the Oates Piedmont Glacier (76&deg;25' S, 162&deg;35' E) in Antarctica are named after him.<br>
