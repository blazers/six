<span class="headword">Cooper,  Thomas Mackay</span>, Baron Cooper of Culross  (1892&#150;1955), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 24 September 1892, the elder son by a second marriage of John Aitken Cooper, burgh engineer of Edinburgh, and his wife, Margaret Mackay, from Dunnet. His father, who came from Culross, died when Tom Cooper was eight. At nine he entered George Watson's College and left at sixteen, <i>dux</i> of the school, medallist in English, Latin, and Greek, with second place in mathematics and winner of the North American prize for dynamics and chemistry. He passed to Edinburgh University, taking first place in its open bursary list, and graduated MA with first-class honours in classics (1912) and LLB with distinction (1914). For a time during the war he worked in the war trade department in London and for his services was appointed OBE in 1920.<br>
<br>Cooper had passed advocate in 1915 and on returning to the bar in 1919 made rapid progress. He had the advantage, through a maternal uncle, of valuable legal connections, but he had also gifts of advocacy and a knowledge of many technical subjects which pointed to an assured forensic career. He took silk in 1927. After eight years of large senior practice he was elected Conservative member for West Edinburgh in May 1935 and appointed solicitor-general for Scotland. In October of the same year he became lord advocate and was sworn of the privy council. He proved himself to be one of the most efficient and popular lord advocates that Scotland had ever had. In June 1941 he succeeded Lord Aitchison as lord justice-clerk with the judicial title of Lord Cooper, and in January 1947 he became lord justice-general and lord president of the Court of Session. Serious illness overtook him in the late summer of 1954 and he resigned office in December. He had received his barony in June 1954, but, because of illness, he was never able to take part in the business of the upper house: his sole appearance there was the occasion of his introduction, undertaken with great difficulty in March 1955.<br>
<br>Cooper had a well-equipped legal mind. His judgments were vigorous, penetrating, and lucid. As a lawyer he will stand favourable comparison with the most eminent of his predecessors. He was a steadfast supporter of the principles of Scots law, and frequently commented on the unfortunate intrusion into these principles of English legal conceptions and precedents. Perhaps the most publicized of his judgments was that given shortly before he retired, in an action challenging the adoption for Scotland of the numeral II in the title of Queen Elizabeth  (<i>MacCormick v. HM Advocate</i>, 1953). Though the action failed on certain preliminary pleas, Lord Cooper took occasion to criticize the English principle of the sovereignty of parliament in relation to the treaty of union between Scotland and England. He was active in the formation in 1934 of the Stair Society to study and advance the history of Scots law, and made a number of contributions to its publications, the chief being <span class="italic">Regiam majestatem</span> (1947). Independently of the society he published in 1944 <span class="italic">Select Scottish Cases of the Thirteenth Century</span>. A member of the Scottish History Society from 1934, he gave, as its president (1946&#150;9), four addresses which he published under the title of <span class="italic">Supra crepidam</span> (1951), and which he claimed to be merely addresses by an amateur to specialists on their own subject. It has been said that his keen perception as a historian is best seen in these addresses. Numerous other addresses and contributions to periodicals, collected in <span class="italic">Selected Papers, 1922&#150;1954</span>, published by his brother in 1957, after his death, show his breadth of view and width of learning, as also the spirit of a reformer. He was an original member of the Scottish committee on the <span class="roman">History of Parliament</span> and latterly chairman of its executive committee until his death. When a judge, he was called on to be chairman of a number of government committees on Scottish problems; the most important, on hydroelectric development in Scotland (1941&#150;2), resulted in the setting up of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board. He was a trustee of the National Galleries of Scotland from 1947, for a short time (1946&#150;9) chairman of the Ancient Monuments Board for Scotland, and, as lord president, a trustee <i>ex officio</i> of the National Library of Scotland.<br>
<br>Cooper was a man of restless energy, great industry, keen intellect, and a rapid worker. He had a scientific bent of mind, with the genius for the practical application of his knowledge. He was a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and its vice-president (1945&#150;8), a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries (Scotland), a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, and a member of the Astronomical Society of Edinburgh, which lent him a telescope which he had erected in his garden. Essentially a friendly man, Cooper was nevertheless shy, not a man of the world or socially inclined, although drawn to men with whom he could talk on a basis of common understanding. He was happy with very young children, whom he would amuse with drawings and stories, but his interest in them evaporated when they left childhood. He loved animals and never failed to hold converse with a cat. He had some interest in music and art, taught himself to play the piano and organ, and engaged in sketching. He was devoted to his mother, with whom he made his home for substantially the whole of his life, and whom he survived by less than four years. He died in Edinburgh, unmarried, on 15 July 1955.<br>
<br>Cooper was an honorary LLD of Edinburgh, Glasgow, and St Andrews, and received an honorary doctorate of Paris University, a signal honour for a Scottish judge. He was an honorary master of the bench of the Middle Temple and honorary member of the Society of Public Teachers of Law, of the Institution of Municipal Engineers, and of the Edinburgh Merchant Company.<br>
