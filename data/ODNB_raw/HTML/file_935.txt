<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Aylmer,  John</span>  (1520/21&#150;1594), <span class="occ">bishop of London</span>, was descended from the Norfolk branch of an ancient family long established in Tivetshall St Mary. The identities of his parents are unknown. He was born in 1520 or 1521, since his funeral inscription recorded his age at death as seventy-three. Before consecration he emphasized his putative Anglo-Saxon origins by signing himself &#145;&AElig;lmer&#146;. Otherwise his name is usually found in contemporary sources as &#145;Elmer&#146;.<br>
<br>Thomas Fuller relates that as a schoolboy Aylmer attracted the notice of Henry Grey, third marquess of Dorset and later duke of Suffolk, who subsidized his studies at Cambridge. Although he probably became a fellow of Queens' nothing is definitely known about his university career except that he graduated BA in 1541, proceeding MA in 1545.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareerandexileabroad15411559"></a>Early career and exile abroad, 1541&#150;1559</h2>Another of Aylmer's early patrons may have been Dr John Aylmer (<i>d</i>. 1550/1559?), presumably both a kinsman and the Cambridge graduate who proceeded BCL in 1514. He held a clutch of west country livings during the 1540s and was doubtless the John Aylmer who was prebendary of Wells from 1543. Although the future bishop has been credited with one or more of these promotions he seems until 1549 to have remained entirely within Dorset's household at Bradgate, Leicestershire, or else at court, as tutor to his daughters. Since Dorset was little interested in such matters Aylmer also apparently served as his &#145;corresponding secretary&#146; with those leading evangelicals and reformers who took the trouble, for political reasons, to address him. Thus he was able to cultivate friendships with Martin Bucer and Heinrich Bullinger, encouraging Lady Jane Grey to write to them as her education progressed.<br>
<br>Thomas Becon encountered Aylmer at Bradgate in 1546&#150;7&#151;&#145;a young man singularly well learned both in the Latin and Greek tongue&#146;  (Becon, 424)&#151;and in 1550 Roger Ascham paid a celebrated visit. His account of his last meeting with Lady Jane purports to enshrine a conversation during which she contrasted the harsh treatment she received from her parents with the scholarly blandishments of Aylmer, who taught her &#145;so gently, so pleasantly, with such fair alluments to learning, that &hellip; when I am called from him I fall on weeping because, whatsoever I do else &hellip; is full of grief&#146;  (Ascham, 47). Ascham's encomium must be treated with caution, however. Even if he recorded these remarks verbatim they were not committed to cold print until 1570, when Aylmer was a candidate for the bishopric of London. Nor, surely, can he have overlooked (even if convention did not allow him to express) the obvious possibility that Jane had developed an adolescent crush on a young man who treated her with consideration and necessarily with deference.<br>
<br>Aylmer's earliest surviving letters, dating from May and December 1551 and both addressed to Bullinger, suggest a regime more austere than the romantic idyll conjured by later writers from Ascham's narrative. In the latter Aylmer asked that &#145;with the kindness we have so long experienced, you will instruct my pupil in your next letter as to what embellishment and adornment of person is becoming in young women professing godliness&#146;  (Robinson, <span class="italic">Original Letters</span>, 1.278).<br>
<br>As the Grey family moved closer to power under Edward VI Aylmer's services were rewarded. Although unordained he received ecclesiastical promotion. No institution records survive but he compounded for the first fruits of the rectory of Pimperne, Dorset, in December 1549; for those of Nailstone, Leicestershire, in July 1552; and, resigning Pimperne, for those of Bosworth, Leicestershire, in April 1553. On 15 June 1553, three weeks before Edward's death, he was installed archdeacon of Stow in Lincoln Cathedral, on the presentation of Thomas Ashton of Old Weston, Huntingdonshire.<br>
<br>Whilst Aylmer never seems to have recorded his reaction to Northumberland's attempt to place Lady Jane on the throne in July 1553 he grimly endured the consequences, appearing at the first convocation of Mary's reign in October to argue against transubstantiation. His loyalty to the Greys kept him in England for a while thereafter. Implicated in Wyatt's rebellion in January 1554 he was amongst those supporters of Suffolk who on 17 September were indicted for having raised rebellion at Leicester. He was by then in Strasbourg, having been deprived of all his preferments for marriage in March. The identity of his wife is unknown but she was presumably the mother of an (unnamed) daughter who during the 1570s married Adam Squire. She died before December 1561.<br>
<br>Like many leading exiles Aylmer is credited with a &#145;miraculous escape&#146;: according to Thomas Fuller, when those sent to apprehend Aylmer boarded the vessel in which he was to cross the channel he was hidden in a large wine-vat with a secret compartment.<br>
<br>Although John Strype asserted that it was Aylmer who in Strasbourg published a letter of Lady Jane Grey's it is more likely that its preserver and publisher was James Haddon, another of her tutors, who died there in 1556. Because Aylmer's name never occurs in the correspondence between the exiles of Frankfurt, Strasbourg, and Z&uuml;rich the historian of the Marian exile wondered if his Grey connections &#145;made him think it advisable to remain hidden&#146;  (Garrett, 76). This was to overlook his own account of his travels abroad, sent years later to Thomas Cooper when Aylmer was stung into refuting the libels of Martin Marprelate. According to this he visited &#145;almost all Universities in <i>Italie</i> and <i>Germanie</i>, having great conference with the most and best learned men&#146; and finally reaching Jena, Saxony, in 1558  (Cooper, 47). Here, but for the accession of Elizabeth, he would have taken up a lectureship in Hebrew. A testimonial from Johann Friedrich II, elector of Saxony, surviving amongst the state papers, seems to bear out the assertion.<br>
<br>During his wanderings Aylmer supported himself by taking pupils. One such was Robert Beale, who migrated with him from Strasbourg to Z&uuml;rich in 1557 and later claimed that although he had acted as Aylmer's servant in lieu of fees Aylmer had nevertheless exacted payment for his studies and thereafter ignored him. On 10 December John Foxe, gathering material which would emerge into print in the first edition of his <span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span> (1563), wrote to Aylmer from Basel requesting information about Lady Jane. In reply Aylmer assured him of a warm welcome in Z&uuml;rich and promised help with his researches.<br>
<br>At the beginning of Elizabeth's reign Aylmer attempted to repair the damage inflicted by John Knox's disastrously timed <span class="italic">First Blast of the Trumpet</span>: his own <span class="italic">An harborowe for faithfull and trewe subjectes, against the late blowne blaste, concerning the government of women</span> was published anonymously, and ostensibly in Strasbourg. In fact it was issued in London by John Day in April 1559. As a defence of the queen's title it was scarcely felicitous, observing that women were &#145;weake in nature, feable in bodie, softe in courage, unskilfull in practise&#146;  (sig. B2<i>v</i>) and thereafter flat-footedly insisting upon Elizabeth's <i>personal</i> credentials as a ruler: here was no empty-headed, chattering gossip. The most scathing of Aylmer's later critics wittily took leave to doubt &#145;whether any man ever recommended himself to a woman by complimenting her at the expense of her sex&#146;  (Maitland, 214&#150;15).<br>
<br>Elizabeth may also have taken note of the assertion that in England government by a woman could be tolerated because it would be less <i>her</i> government than government in her name and on her behalf. Yet probably more damaging to Aylmer's own immediate prospects was his demand for an end to episcopal lordliness and the equitable distribution of ecclesiastical revenues on behalf of educational projects and the provision of competent preachers throughout the realm. Whilst in choosing her leading advisers Elizabeth wisely overlooked the d&eacute;b&acirc;cle of Lady Jane she had no intention of making any fundamental alteration of the episcopal order. Aylmer quickly learned his lesson: when after his consecration opponents twitted him with his former iconoclasm he retorted that when he was a child he spake as a child.<h2>
<a name="AmisquaredstoneexileinEngland15591577"></a>A misquared stone: &#145;exile&#146; in England, 1559&#150;1577</h2>Back in England by March 1559 Aylmer was one of the delegates to the Westminster disputation, intended to discredit the Catholic resistance which was delaying a satisfactory religious settlement in parliament. Thereafter he remained in London with Lord John Grey, principal survivor of Mary's destruction of Lady Jane's family, to whom Elizabeth had restored their property in the Minories. A memorandum of late June or early July indicates that he was being considered by William Cecil for the episcopal bench, but he was passed over and from the Minories on 12 August applied to Lord Robert Dudley for help in recovering property in Norfolk which an &#145;unthrifty nephew&#146; had illegally sold during the time of his &#145;grievous exile&#146;; and also for the deanery of Winchester or else Durham &#145;for now as a misquared stone (I know not by what means) I serve her highness in no part of her building, which is no small grief to me&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 32091, fol. 172<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>No deanery was forthcoming. Aylmer therefore returned to Lincoln, where during the royal visitation he was restored to Nailstone, Bosworth, and the archdeaconry of Stow. At the beginning of 1560 he was back in London, where on 25 January he was finally ordained deacon by Edmund Grindal. Thereafter he was in some way embroiled in the &#145;foolish subject&#146; of the crucifix remaining in the queen's chapel, an issue over which several of the newly appointed bishops threatened to resign or else submit to removal  (Robinson, <span class="italic">Zurich Letters</span>, 1.67&#150;9). Later that year he was ordained priest by Nicholas Bullingham, bishop of Lincoln.<br>
<br>On 20 November 1561 Aylmer was instituted rector of Cossington, Leicestershire, on the presentation of Thomas Burdett of Bramcote, Warwickshire, another survivor of Wyatt's rebellion. Next month he was one of eight married men suggested by Grindal for the provostship of Eton. The post went to one of the six unmarried candidates, William Day, who would survive to be considered as his successor in London. Thus Aylmer had by this point married his second wife, Judith Bures alias King of Suffolk, daughter of Robert King and widow of Nathaniel Treherne, with whom she appears to have had no children. Her funeral monument specifically states that she married Treherne in Mary's reign and Aylmer during Elizabeth's. They had eight sons and two daughters, the elder of whom, Judith, was born in September 1562.<br>
<br>On 20 April 1562 Aylmer received letters patent for the archdeaconry of Lincoln and was installed on 6 November. Despite their future differences Aylmer always acknowledged that he was indebted to Cecil for this promotion. It represented a huge increase both in his workload and in his financial status: at almost &pound;200 per annum it was worth more than three of the four Welsh bishoprics and henceforth his personal financial worries can have been few. The fragmentary evidence which survives for his tenure suggests an increasingly stern, conforming administrator&#151;it is notable that he abstained from the debate on liturgical reform during the convocation of 1563&#151;who had displeased his masters and was being kept at arm's length. In the account of himself submitted to Cooper he claimed that he had reformed Lincoln's chapter&#151;&#145;a neast of uncleane birdes&#146;&#151;and that, as both preacher and ecclesiastical commissioner, he had ensured that at his departure there was &#145;not one recusant &hellip; left in the countrey&#146;  (Cooper, 48). If this was special pleading he undoubtedly laboured tirelessly on behalf of Elizabeth's settlement, and whilst efforts to evangelize the city itself met with only partial success because of the poverty of its fourteen livings he was a leading light in the reorganization of its two grammar schools and their projected amalgamation during the 1560s.<br>
<br>With the archdeaconry of Lincoln came capitular duties. Bullingham collated Aylmer to the prebend of St Martin in December 1562. Installed in person on 6 September 1564, during which month he became a canon residentiary, he remained in residence thereafter. In September 1567 he exchanged St Martin for the prebend of Decem Librarum, retaining it until his consecration. Summoned to court to preach at Easter 1565, Aylmer renewed an old friendship with Sir Nicholas Throckmorton. Their meeting prompted his only personal letter to survive from the 1560s and it hints obscurely at a crisis in both their flagging careers. Convinced that Dudley (now earl of Leicester) was his only friend at court and that Cecil was blocking his advancement, Throckmorton seems to have warned Aylmer that his archdeaconry was as much as he could expect from Cecil: higher preferment depended on a new patron. At any rate, Aylmer asserted in reply that he believed that Leicester and Throckmorton were now his &#145;chiefest friends &hellip; in England as God knoweth&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 15/12/54). Throckmorton probably, if unintentionally, misled him: Leicester's &#145;friendship&#146; never seems to have produced any tangible result.<h2>
<a name="Ascendingtheladder"></a>Ascending the ladder</h2>In 1567 Matthew Parker, archbishop of Canterbury, asked Aylmer to locate manuscripts in Lincoln Cathedral Library and thereafter it was he who attempted to further Aylmer's career. Some months later he suggested to Leicester that if Grindal were promoted to York, Aylmer would prove &#145;a good, fast, earnest servitor&#146; in London and &#145;fit for that busy governance, specially as these times be, when papists &hellip; have gotten such courage&#146;  (Bruce and Perowne, 350). Addressing Cecil thereafter Parker nevertheless doubted&#151;perhaps on the basis of Leicester's reaction&#151;whether Aylmer would be acceptable, and indeed London went to Edwin Sandys, bishop of Worcester, through the joint efforts of Cecil and Leicester.<br>
<br>Although Aylmer was destined for seven more years in the wilderness Parker had made his point. Aylmer's administrative abilities were increasingly recognized. At about this time he was appointed a JP for Lincolnshire and was perhaps as responsible as Bullingham for the form of clerical subscription introduced into Lincoln diocese in 1570: the articles foreshadow those which John Whitgift would attempt to enforce in 1583&#150;4 on his elevation to Canterbury. In 1571 Aylmer was appointed to the quorum of the long-delayed commission responsible for putting the <span class="roman">Acts of Uniformity and Supremacy</span> into full execution in Lincoln and Peterborough dioceses. In 1572, when membership was increased from twenty-seven to seventy, he became an ecclesiastical commissioner.<br>
<br>Lincoln's affairs came under Parker's scrutiny during the brief vacancy that followed Bullingham's translation to Worcester in January 1571. One Richard Taylor had been presented to the valuable prebend of Corringham by virtue of a grant from Bullingham's predecessor and Parker duly admitted him on 3 February. The chapter, however, headed by its subdean, Michael Renniger, ignored his mandate to induct. Parker dispatched an angry missive threatening Renniger, Aylmer, and two other prebendaries with a summons for contempt of his jurisdiction.<br>
<br>Thomas Cooper's first act as bishop of Lincoln was to collate Aylmer to Corringham <i>pleno jure</i> (26 April). Despite a further archiepiscopal mandate for Taylor's induction on 2 May Renniger and the chapter inducted Aylmer three days later. Thereafter, in circumstances which remain obscure, resistance to Parker collapsed and in May 1573 Aylmer's bonds for Corringham's first fruits were cancelled on the grounds that Taylor was in possession. In the interim, in November 1571, Aylmer had resigned Nailstone.<br>
<br>It is difficult to divine whether Cooper was an accomplice in this peculiar episode or in some way the dupe of the chapter. In any event it was an odd baptism of fire and there followed a serious rift between Aylmer and Cooper over their relative jurisdiction within the archdeaconry. In mid-1572 they submitted their respective rights to the determination of Parker and Robert Horne, bishop of Winchester, who on 1 July proposed a judicious division of the spoils whereby Aylmer and Cooper should hold court jointly and so determine all causes except those which were indisputably the prerogative of the bishop. All fees and profits were to be divided except during episcopal visitations. Aylmer proceeded DTh at Cambridge this year and on 10 October 1573 was incorporated BTh and DTh at Oxford after twenty years' study.<br>
<br>Following Grindal's elevation to Canterbury in February 1576 Elizabeth's long-expressed distrust of &#145;prophesyings&#146;, clerical exercises designed to educate less able clergy, reached crisis point. Widely established throughout the southern province, they were broadly supported by bishops of the stamp of Sandys and Cooper. Although under pressure Cooper had virtually suppressed them in the south of his diocese they survived in Lincolnshire and Leicestershire and alarming reports about them began reaching court. Elizabeth confronted Grindal with an ultimatum: to convince her of their utility and orderliness or else to suppress them totally. Grindal rallied his forces, writing to his diocesans in mid-June for their opinions.<br>
<br>Cooper's reply voiced some dark suspicions. Elizabeth had apparently been informed that those under his aegis were &#145;riotous assemblies&#146; where &#145;unlearned and base persons&#146; were permitted to speak freely. If so he had:<blockquote>great cause to fear falsehood in fellowship, that information is made by some by whom in charity it ought not to be &hellip; I suspect there be some that seek to creep in favour, not only by their own well-doings but by the discrediting of others' well-doings, and so to suspect, I have greater cause than I can conveniently put in writing. (LPL, MS 2003, fols. 29<i>r</i>&#150;30<i>r</i>)</blockquote>Grindal evidently instructed Cooper to investigate further and report back. Evidence of the flurry of activity which followed survives in an unsolicited letter of Aylmer's&#151;the only one Grindal apparently received on the subject that did not come from one of his diocesans. Dated from Cossington on 25 September it spoke of &#145;a rank of rangers and posting apostles that go from shire to shire, from exercise to exercise&#146;, naming Eusebius Paget and Anthony Gilby amongst others. As for Grindal's demand for a report on the exercises, Cooper had committed it &#145;to one Spark and Willock&#146;, who themselves refused the surplice and countenanced other liturgical irregularities: &#145;therefore your Grace had need take heed how you credit the certificate&#146;  (LPL, MS 3470, fol. 22<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Quite apart from his contemptuous dismissal of John Willock, an old comrade-in-arms from Bradgate days, Aylmer was effectively accusing Cooper of dishonesty. Grindal must surely have surmised that it was Aylmer above all whom Cooper suspected of seeking to &#145;creep in favour&#146; and that he now regarded himself as a bishop-in-waiting, effectively beyond Cooper's reach. It was widely rumoured that he had been marked out by Christopher Hatton for promotion, whilst only months later Edmund Spenser in his <span class="italic">Shepheardes Calender</span> characterized him as Morrell&#151;a goatherd, not a true pastor&#151;whose chief motivation was to reach the top of the greasy pole and whose motto was <i>In summo foelicitas</i>. Here he was contrasted with Grindal (Algrind), who preferred the &#145;lowe degree&#146; but, having accepted the higher, was struck down by a glancing blow and now lay &#145;in lingring payne&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poetical Works</span>, 446).<h2>
<a name="Thedefactoprimacy15771583"></a>The de facto primacy, 1577&#150;1583</h2>Whether or not Hatton abetted this apparently blatant attempt to sabotage Cooper's credibility it was undoubtedly Hatton's spectacular rise during the 1570s that provided Aylmer with what he had hitherto conspicuously lacked, a powerful patron. In the wake of Grindal's fatal letter to Elizabeth in December 1576, refusing to suppress the prophesyings, Aylmer's advancement was assured, and only two days after Sandys's confirmation to York on 8 March 1577 the chapter of St Paul's was instructed to elect Aylmer in his stead. He was consecrated by Grindal, Sandys, and John Piers of Rochester on 24 March.<br>
<br>Since his precipitate elevation meant that it would be impossible to grant him London's revenues retrospectively out of the <i>sede vacante</i> profits&#151;standard procedure&#151;Cecil (Lord Burghley since 1572) proposed that Sandys cede them to Aylmer from Michaelmas 1576 as he himself was to receive those of York from the same date. Sandys angrily refused. Aylmer conducted a personal investigation into Sandys's financial affairs, sending Burghley the result and tactlessly attempting to justify his claim to London's revenues on the grounds that otherwise he would be &#145;naked&#146; and Sandys &#145;so well left&#146; at York. Burghley&#151;with malice aforethought?&#151;passed the letter on to Sandys, whose fury knew no bounds. His rejoinder spoke of &#145;an envious heart covered with the coat of dissimulation &hellip; So soon as [I] had holpen him on with his rochet he was transformed and showed himself in his own nature&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/112/45).<br>
<br>Compromise, if not harmony, was effected: on 10 May Aylmer duly received the temporalities from Michaelmas 1576, but without favourable terms of composition. Required to compound strictly according to the terms of the <span class="roman">Act for First Fruits and Tenths</span> (1559) he had to produce five sureties. Since Hatton's other prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, John Whitgift of Worcester and John Piers of Rochester, were similarly penalized at this time it is probable that their elevation had been steadily opposed by Burghley, whose own prot&eacute;g&eacute;s (including Sandys) were not obliged to find sureties.<br>
<br>In May 1577 Elizabeth suspended Grindal from office for refusing to suppress the prophesyings. In a dramatic reversal of their fortunes the new bishop of London, as dean of the southern province, immediately assumed his functions, exercising a <i>de facto</i> primacy which in the event lasted until Grindal's death.<br>
<br>It imposed a huge, triple burden&#151;Aylmer also became chief commissioner for ecclesiastical causes&#151;and the strain soon began to tell. His naturally pugnacious temper, evidently soured by his years in the wilderness, quickly brought him into conflict with many whose support he could ill afford to forgo. Within weeks he had offended the earl of Lincoln and begun an acrimonious struggle with Sandys over dilapidations for London&#151;a titanic battle which proved one of the most disreputable episodes of the reign. By 1578 he was in bad odour with Hatton and Elizabeth (who had instructed him to pay equal attention to Catholic recusants and protestant nonconformists) for what they regarded as his over-harsh dealings with the former. By early 1579 Burghley was prepared to listen to reports that Aylmer was despoiling his see by overmuch felling of timber and he was called before the privy council. Encountering dark hints of deprivation Aylmer dispatched a violently intemperate letter, accusing Burghley of deliberately seeking to undermine his authority.<br>
<br>Despite Burghley's tactful reply Aylmer's future clearly hung in the balance. By December it was rumoured that he was to be translated and he himself frequently requested removal. At first he proposed himself for Ely, which Richard Cox wished to resign, and in March 1580 applied for vacant Winchester. He continued to hanker after Ely following Cox's death in 1581, but in the event the see remained vacant until 1599. Even after Whitgift's elevation to Canterbury he continued to seek translation on the grounds that London needed a younger man.<h2>
<a name="Thedrivetowardsconformity"></a>The drive towards conformity</h2>Although during these years Aylmer's episcopal duties took third place to his other commitments he instantly made his mark on diocesan administration, appointing as vicar-general the able Edward Stanhope, later characterized by Marprelate as &#145;Tarquinius Superbus&#146;. Others appointed to his diocesan establishment were William Cotton, future bishop of Exeter, William Hutchinson, and the bishop's own son-in-law Adam Squire, collated archdeacon of Middlesex in June 1577.<br>
<br>Aylmer conducted his primary visitation in late 1577. Although according to the diarist Thomas Earle he urged a form of subscription which a substantial minority of clergy refused, surviving evidence does not suggest a witch-hunt at this early juncture in the interests of conformity. Those granted preaching licences in the visitation's aftermath included a dozen or so &#145;moderate puritans&#146; with whom he would clash over the next decade, including Edmund Chapman, George Gifford, Giles Whiting, and Arthur Dent.<br>
<br>His visitors' findings, however, undoubtedly alerted Aylmer to the circumstance that, as in Lincoln, the strict provisions of the prayer book were widely ignored and even openly flouted. If further proof were needed he soon discovered it at Rochford Hall, the Thames-side seat of Robert, second Lord Rich, Essex's most influential protestant patron. Encouraged by his bastard brother Richard, Lord Rich had been displaying increasing sympathy towards radical preachers, even to the point of promoting quasi-congregational exercises at Rochford. Aylmer later asserted that he had had &#145;many great storms at his hand for the staying of them&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 33, fol. 48<i>r</i>), but to no avail.<br>
<br>Aylmer's response to the endemic radicalism of his vast diocese was to abandon the policy of <i>laissez-faire</i> towards nonconformist practices by means of which Elizabeth's first bench of bishops&#151;innately sympathetic or else merely grateful for evangelical support&#151;had sought to implement her settlement. In the summer of 1578 he took the draconian step of placing under an interdict the two radical city of London liberties, Holy Trinity Minories and St Anne Blackfriars, until their ministers and churchwardens should pledge themselves to observe the prayer book ceremonies. William Hutchinson's appointment as archdeacon of St Albans in July 1581 would likewise mark the beginning of the end of that ancient liberty's semi-independent status: ceded to London diocese in 1550 it had hitherto effectively remained a self-regulating outpost under archidiaconal control, its affairs seldom attracting the attention of the bishop.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Aylmer had struck decisively at the unbeneficed preachers and lecturers of the city, led by the single-minded John Field. Preachers were not obliged to wear the surplice in the pulpit but Aylmer's stipulation in January 1580 that all clergy must administer the sacraments four times a year presented them with a dilemma: either to accept the provisions of the prayer book by using the surplice at administration or to risk suspension. One direct consequence of this policy of divide-and-rule was that he alienated the city fathers, always more sympathetic towards radical than towards conformist courses. In March 1582 Aylmer dispatched a stinging rebuke to the incumbent lord mayor, Sir James Harvey, for indiscreet words used against himself and the late Bishop Horne, as well as for contemptuous behaviour towards conforming city clergy. Within months, he acidly observed, Harvey would be plain Sir James whilst he himself would still be John London.<br>
<br>Whilst the surviving evidence of his second visitation in 1580 suggests that Aylmer was still placing as much emphasis on recusancy as on protestant nonconformity, he had begun to cast a baleful eye on radical activities in and around Essex's two ancient boroughs, Colchester and Maldon. Colchester's poorly endowed, badly served parishes were subjected to tighter regulation whilst Timothy Fitzallen, vicar of nearby Dedham, was suspended in January 1581, thereafter resigning. A similar intervention in Maldon that year led to the resignation of Fabian Withers (although here Aylmer made what could be construed as a severe tactical blunder, agreeing to institute George Gifford in his place). Probably in equal and opposite reaction to these developments, clandestine clerical conferences were established (probably at Field's direct instigation) as a species of self-help and self-regulation. That which first met in 1582 under the leadership of Edmund Chapman, lecturer of Dedham, drew its membership from southern Suffolk as well as from the environs of Colchester. Another, centred on Braintree, was led by Gifford and Richard Rogers, lecturer of Wethersfield.<br>
<br>Despite these early skirmishes into radical strongholds it was as senior commissioner for ecclesiastical causes that Aylmer initially gained his reputation as the hammer of the puritans. Although R. G. Usher argued that it was not until the 1580s, under the guidance of Whitgift and Richard Bancroft, that the ecclesiastical commissioners' proceedings developed into a &#145;court of high commission&#146;, it was actually during Aylmer's <i>de facto</i> primacy that it emerged as a fully-fledged court of first instance. In 1580 Aylmer effectively widened its scope by procuring a privy council letter extending to the whole province his diocesan order that all clergy must regularly administer the sacraments. Robert Beale, now clerk of the council, claimed that Aylmer was guilty of sharp practice in securing signatures to the letter, which had never been fully debated, and then issued it under the commission's seal, which closely resembled the council's.<br>
<br>The high commission's encroaching powers were most forcefully challenged by the Riches, one of whose prot&eacute;g&eacute;s was Robert Wright. After Lord Rich's death in February 1581 Wright briefly departed for Antwerp, where he was ordained according to a presbyterian rite. On his return Richard Rich and his nephew Robert, the 21-year-old third baron, personally solicited a preaching licence for him, bearding Aylmer in his study at Fulham in September. Aylmer refused to grant one unless fully informed of the nature of Wright's orders and assured that he would subscribe the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>. At that point Richard Rich physically assaulted him. The affair led to the trial of Richard Rich and Wright before the high commission and the imprisonment of both in November.<br>
<br>Unfortunately for Aylmer, Lord Rich had just married Penelope Devereux, sister of Robert, earl of Essex, and could thus count on powerful support at court. In any case Burghley was unhappy on technical grounds with the conduct of the trial. It had turned finally on sworn depositions&#151;accepted as proven evidence without the possibility of further defence&#151;that Wright had denounced celebratory sermons on Elizabeth's accession day as tantamount to idolatry. All this, Burghley seems to have reasoned, was to have ridden roughshod over the basic principles of common law and also to have exceeded the commissioners' brief to take cognizance only of cases which specifically concerned breaches of the strict provisions of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. By March 1582 Aylmer, under pressure from the council, released Richard Rich on bail. Elizabeth (who had sided firmly with the commissioners) was furious and Aylmer hastened to justify himself in what was perhaps, Grindal's act of epistolatory self-annihilation excepted, the most remarkable letter she ever received from one of her bishops. He informed her bluntly that there were limits to the commission's authority. &#145;Your highness thinketh that the Bishop of London may do what he will &hellip; wherein I beseech your Majesty to inform yourself better, and not to suppose my authority under you greater than it is&#146;  (Nicolas, 246). To instruct Elizabeth that she misunderstood the nature of the legal powers which she had delegated to him was a brave action but Aylmer subsequently assured Leicester that his letter had pacified her. The affair nevertheless dragged on until September when the council finally had the better of the argument: Rich and Wright were both released on promises of good behaviour.<h2>
<a name="Adioceseincrisis"></a>A diocese in crisis</h2>Although Whitgift's accession to the primacy after Grindal's death on 6 July 1583 must have come as an immense relief Aylmer remained under intense personal pressure. On 2 November he wrote to Leicester of the &#145;unhappy paroxysm&#146; which had soured relations between them  (Nicolas, 348&#150;9). Five days later, nervous about rumours that he was again to be called before the council, he solicited Burghley's unequivocal support: otherwise he must &#145;give over&#146; sitting as a commissioner: &#145;I would to God my L. of Cant were in the commission, that I might have some ease for I am deadly weary&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 38/86). A new commission, naming Whitgift as primate, was finally issued in January 1584.<br>
<br>Henceforth Aylmer had more time for diocesan affairs. He had conducted his third visitation in July 1583. The visitors, led by William Hutchinson, carefully scrutinized preaching licences and came down heavily upon those who omitted weekday services&#151;a shorthand method of browbeating incumbents who placed more emphasis on preaching than upon the prayer book&#151;and yet, considering what was to follow, the visitors took surprisingly little cognizance of nonconformist practices. Despite further regulation of Colchester's affairs its new town preacher, George Northey, absented himself and was not immediately penalized, whilst of Essex's many radical incumbents only four, including Gifford of Maldon, were called into consistory for refusing the surplice.<br>
<br>These diocesan measures were swiftly overtaken by national events. Aylmer proved to be Whitgift's principal coadjutor in his drive for conformity following his enthronement&#151;was this the &#145;unhappy paroxysm&#146; which had alienated Leicester?&#151;and the archbishop's divisive articles, enshrining the proposition that the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> contained nothing contrary to the word of God, were instantly introduced into London diocese. They first appear in the record in October 1583, when Aylmer made use of them in advance of their official promulgation to pounce on, and suspend, Northey of Colchester. Strenuous attempts by the Colchester authorities to have Northey restored included an appeal to Aylmer's old friend William Cole&#151;their former town preacher and now president of Corpus Christi College, Oxford&#151;to intercede with him on Northey's behalf. Cole found Aylmer inflexible and flatly advised that Northey should capitulate.<br>
<br>In early March 1584 Aylmer summoned eight leading Essex nonconformists&#151;Gifford and Arthur Dent amongst them&#151;to Fulham. All were shown the articles and asked if they were prepared to subscribe. Two unbeneficed men, Nicholas Ward and Thomas Carew, were immediately suspended upon refusal. The remainder were given time to deliberate.<br>
<br>If the subscription crisis of 1584 was not quite a storm in a teacup&#151;it marked the beginning of the end of moderate puritan aspirations for the liberalization of Elizabeth's settlement&#151;the evidence of John Field's papers argues that only thirteen other Essex incumbents were subsequently disciplined. The principal casualties proved to be Northey and George Gifford, deprived of his benefice in May or June. By September, however, Whitgift's campaign, steadily opposed by Burghley and the majority of the privy council, had collapsed and the case of Richard Rogers of Wethersfield was probably typical: Aylmer restored him after thirty weeks' suspension, apparently without demanding subscription.<br>
<br>Whilst they remained available as a cat-and-mouse tactic it must be doubted that Whitgift's articles were ever again fully implemented within the diocese of London. Compromise was probably effected by means of a form of limited subscription or else promises of good behaviour on the part of those whom Aylmer chose to pursue. Although never again beneficed Gifford was soon restored to his ministry in Maldon and remained there as town preacher until his death in 1600. Northey was released from suspension in late 1584, dying as Colchester's town preacher in 1593.<br>
<br>Altogether Aylmer's efforts to subdue his recalcitrant clergy during the 1580s were considerably less successful than was once supposed. John Field's papers, comprehensively quarried by early historians of nonconformity, appeared, for tactical reasons, to paint a picture of nonconformist defeat at every turn. It was one which John Strype, charting Aylmer's progress via his self-justifying letters to Burghley, was content broadly to endorse. Yet Strype failed to recognize that whenever Aylmer was forced to defend himself he had almost invariably lost the battle in advance, however long it may have taken Burghley to wear him down. Essentially Aylmer's efforts boil down to a persistent crusade against about thirty entrenched nonconformists&#151;the members of the two clerical conferences and their close associates. Most remained in place until their deaths.<br>
<br>Despite strenuous attempts to alter the 1559 settlement in the parliament which met in November 1584 there appears to have been no sustained, constructive attempt to pursue the supporters of parliamentary puritanism in the rural parishes. During 1585 only half a dozen unbeneficed men&#151;including Robert Wright, now preaching at Fryerning&#151;continued under threat in the name of full subscription, and whilst a new tactic was introduced of indicting beneficed nonconformists at assize this policy seems to have been abandoned during 1586. The only other men to draw attention to themselves in these months were William Tunstall, vicar of Great Totham, summoned to answer charges in October 1585; Thomas Carew of Hatfield Peverel; Mark Wiersdale of Maldon; and William Dyke, suspended as preacher of St Albans in June 1586 despite the best efforts of Lady Bacon, Burghley's sister-in-law.<br>
<br>If 1585 provided a lull before a further storm it was perhaps because in mid-career Aylmer had made a serious political blunder: in April 1585 he fell foul of Elizabeth, Burghley, and Leicester by arresting Thomas Cartwright on his return to England and by August was again defending himself against charges of despoiling his see.<br>
<br>Aylmer conducted his 1586 visitation himself, narrowly escaping ridicule in Maldon when the authorities foiled a plot to snatch his cap and toss it around the crowd. Otherwise, with uncharacteristic restraint, he reported that &#145;disorders &hellip; were not so great as was feared (though more than is to be wished)&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 50, fol. 88<i>r</i>). In London, Walter Travers, Thomas Barber, and Field were all suspended and in Essex no fewer than twenty-eight men, &#145;the painfullest ministers in Essex, whom the Bp. threatneth to deprive, sayinge we shalbe white with him or he wilbe black with us&#146;  (Peel, <span class="italic">Register</span>, 2.260&#150;61). They included Gifford, Wiersdale, Tunstall, Carew, Rogers, and Dyke, as well as Northey of Colchester and several members of the Dedham conference, including Chapman.<br>
<br>Important also was the re-establishment at this visitation of clerical exercises for the supervision of the less able clergy, strictly under diocesan control: thus, at Whitgift's behest, the &#145;prophesyings&#146; which had toppled Grindal were reintroduced in a modified form. Yet Aylmer soon discovered that there were those who had managed to obtain preaching licences in order to avoid attending them. This probably accounts for an obscure episode in October 1586, when George Withers was inhibited as archdeacon of Colchester for violating his privilege of granting licences.<br>
<br>Although a flurry of petitions to the privy council and to parliament followed the suspensions of 1586&#150;7 Aylmer scored two decisive victories. Whilst no specific details of their cases are known, Tunstall of Great Totham, under threat since 1585, and Giles Whiting, rector of Panfield, were deprived by the high commission in May 1587. Later that year, however, Aylmer suffered another personal set-back when his son-in-law Adam Squire, archdeacon of Middlesex, was discovered to be an adulterer.<br>
<br>Continuing as Whitgift's senior coadjutor on the high commission Aylmer took final responsibility for the deprivation that year of Robert Cawdrey, rector of Luffenham, Rutland. In this crucial test-case Cawdrey brought an action in queen's bench which in essence challenged the commission's competence under the strict provisions of the <span class="roman">Act of Supremacy</span>. His defeat &#145;in effect established the Court of High Commission as a proper and lawful court&#146;  (Elton, 221).<br>
<br>In March 1588 Aylmer again suspended Chapman of Dedham, this time for refusing to take part in an ordination at Fulham. On 6 July 1588 he ordered Stephen Egerton and his churchwardens in Blackfriars not to admit strangers to communion. He also suspended &#145;silver-tongued&#146; Henry Smith, lecturer at St Clement Danes, inviting yet another head-on collision with Burghley, Smith's kinsman by marriage. Smith was restored. In 1591 Aylmer clashed with his dean, Alexander Nowell, who declined to induct the bishop's son Theophilus as archdeacon of London on the grounds that he was too young for such promotion. Instead Aylmer issued a special mandate to four senior prebendaries, headed by Lancelot Andrewes. Theophilus, only thirty-one at the time, was duly installed.<br>
<br>Meanwhile the puritan cause in parliament and the conference movement had alike collapsed. The death of Field, and then of Leicester, in 1588 shattered the cohesiveness of the moderate puritan party, and the appearance shortly afterwards of the Martin Marprelate tracts inadvertently tolled its death knell. The pursuit of Martinists and separatists thereafter by Whitgift and Richard Bancroft overwhelmed all organized opposition to their policies as long as Elizabeth lived. Yet the Marprelate tracts themselves bid fair to overwhelm Aylmer, principal butt of their relentless, satirical invective. He was characterized as Dumb John of London for his infrequent preaching and as Mar-elm for that tin-can always tied to his tail, his purported over-exploitation of his timber. Thus the visitation of 1589 took place in a strangely ambivalent atmosphere. The visitors do not appear to have wished to stir up any hornets' nests in the city. Of only three clergymen cited for failing to use the surplice, Stephen Egerton of Blackfriars was enjoined (rather than ordered) to do so but ignored the court's further monitions. Thomas Gataker later claimed that he had never received a summons to attend and ostentatiously left court without petitioning for release from excommunication. Neither seems to have been subsequently pursued.<br>
<br>In Essex the demise of the Dedham conference had left its members and supporters in disarray. Richard Parker, vicar of Dedham, had been exposed as an adulterer and resigned in 1590. William Tey of Peldon was now suspended by the high commission and Thomas Farrar of Langham threatened with sequestration. George Northey and Stephen Beamont of Easthorpe again came under pressure. Outside this Colchester circle Aylmer's principal target was Ezekiel Culverwell, preacher at Felsted and spiritual mentor to Lord Rich in succession to Robert Wright. Culverwell was now at loggerheads with the vicar of Felsted, William Rust, and accordingly fell victim to Aylmer's continuing feud with the Rich family. At St Albans William Dyke was again suspended.<br>
<br>All survived, but there is as much evidence of accommodation on both sides as of capitulation by the nonconformists. Edward Stanhope refused to turn the case against Culverwell into a witch-hunt and, mindful of his canonical duty, achieved an ostensible reconciliation between him and Rust. Richard Rogers of Wethersfield, whilst admitting that he had not administered the sacraments, was dismissed on production of a letter from Ambrose, earl of Warwick (whom he never once mentions in his diary), stating that Rogers was the earl's chaplain.<h2>
<a name="Lastyears15901594"></a>Last years, 1590&#150;1594</h2>With the death of Edmund Freake of Worcester in March 1591 the seventy-year-old Aylmer glimpsed a final prospect of escape from London. Within weeks Hatton informed Bancroft that Elizabeth had agreed to translate Aylmer to Worcester and to promote Bancroft in his place. Nothing came of the proposal but, according to Whitgift, Aylmer &#145;offred thrice, in two years&#146; to resign in Bancroft's favour &#145;upon certain conditions, w<sup><i>ch</i></sup> he refused&#146;  (Peel, <span class="italic">Tracts</span>, xx).<br>
<br>In the summer of 1592 Aylmer conducted his final visitation. The act book of office does not survive but in the wake of recent events&#151;eight nonconformist leaders, including Cartwright, had been tried in Star Chamber during the winter of 1590&#150;91&#151;there are signs that Aylmer may have been disposed to pour oil on troubled waters. In February 1592 Stanhope had granted a preaching licence to Richard Greenham without any form of subscription or obligation on his part because Thomas Fanshaw, queen's remembrancer, had promised that he would not preach contentiously. It is also instructive that, amongst the thirty-seven preachers described as <i>concionator notus</i>, there were some strange bedfellows: Bancroft and archdeacons Hutchinson and Theophilus Aylmer from amongst the hierarchs; long-lived Marian exiles such as Thomas Upcher and Robert Harrington; and nonconformists recently pursued by Aylmer, including Richard Rogers and Northey.<br>
<br>The 1592 call book also provides evidence of Aylmer's wider achievement in his efforts to promote an educated ministry. After the abuses of 1586 the granting of preaching licences had presumably been strictly monitored and some withdrawn. Yet by 1592 only 146 incumbents outside the city (including all 56 absentees) were not listed as holding one. Of the 90 men actually present 14 were ordered or invited to apply for a diocesan licence whilst only 29 remained &#145;tied to the exercises&#146;, most of them long-serving survivors from the first half of the reign. Many of the absentees can be added to the list of qualified preachers. Although the steady advance of a university-trained ministry was one of the hallmarks of Elizabeth's reign this represents a notable achievement. During his visitation in 1595 Aylmer's successor, Richard Fletcher, declared himself favourably impressed with the overall quality of the country clergy.<br>
<br>Yet until the end Aylmer remained <i>persona non grata</i> at court. In June 1592, suggesting candidates for the bishopric of Oxford, he sourly observed that he had seldom had any luck in recommending his friends for promotion. It appears to have been the last time he addressed Burghley in writing and his health may have suddenly collapsed, since the government thereafter took the unusual step of providing him with a coadjutor: on 12 November John Sterne was consecrated bishop of Colchester, the last of only three suffragans appointed under Elizabeth, and the last until 1870.<br>
<br>Aylmer died at Fulham Palace on 3 June 1594 and was buried at St Paul's Cathedral. According to Whitgift he &#145;signify'd the day before his death&#146; his regret that he had not written to Elizabeth recommending Bancroft as his successor  (Peel, <span class="italic">Tracts</span>, xx). Aylmer's dying voice would have cut little ice with Burghley, who espoused the claims of William Day, or with Essex, who successfully promoted those of Fletcher. &#145;Many a drye eye for the Byshopp of London&#146;, wrote Philip Gawdy to his brother, &#145;who is deade and buryed, and I feare me not ascended into heaven (saving my charity)&#146;. He added that Aylmer had left &pound;1500 a year to his children  (<span class="italic">Seventh Report</span>, HMC, 524), an assessment which must have been close to the truth. In his will, dated 22 April 1594, his three eldest sons, Samuel, Theophilus, and John, received substantial property in Essex, Suffolk, and Lincolnshire respectively. Yet there were also large charitable bequests: &pound;300 for the better maintenance of the Paul's Cross sermons; and to the poor of London (&pound;100) and Fulham (&pound;40).<br>
<br>Although Fletcher never mentioned the subject, Bancroft, finally consecrated to London in 1597 after Essex lent his support to Whitgift's long-waged campaign on Bancroft's behalf, penned a damning report on Aylmer's stewardship of the bishopric. Since 1576 he had purchased land to the value of &pound;16,000 for his family's benefit whilst surveyors had set dilapidations of episcopal properties at &pound;6500, of which &pound;4000 needed to be spent on St Paul's Cathedral. Aylmer had also profited from timber during his time to the tune of &pound;6000. Bancroft had begun a process against Samuel Aylmer in the court of arches for the recovery of &pound;4210 only to discover that the late bishop had carefully disposed of his liquid assets before his death and that Samuel refused to part with what he naturally claimed was his patrimony. The result was a detailed exchequer inquiry into the relative liability of Samuel and of a corrupt sub-collector for these and other debts, to the tune of &pound;1500. During the course of it Samuel found himself incarcerated in a debtors' prison.<h2>
<a name="AylmerandtheElizabethanchurch"></a>Aylmer and the Elizabethan church</h2>John Aylmer was small of stature, compact, vigorous, and aggressive. With the understandable exception of John Strype (whose publisher, Brabazon Aylmer, was the bishop's direct descendant) historians have united in concluding that Aylmer's pugnacity made him ill-fitted for the second most politically sensitive post in the Church of England during the heart of Elizabeth's reign. Not for nothing did his funeral monument in St Paul's proclaim him &#145;bis pugil in causa religionis&#146; (&#145;twice a fighter in the cause of religion&#146;). Vetting or omitting the nastier remarks in the letters which he paraphrased, Strype laboured to present a diligent, learned chief pastor whose only care was for the good of the church-state. Yet he could not conceal the fact that Aylmer had a genius for antagonizing supporters and opponents alike and was in many respects a typical bully: usually sycophantic to superiors, unmerciful with inferiors. Technically a formidable administrator, he never learned the true art of administration itself: that of handling those with whom he had to deal with a modicum of tact or consideration. As late as December 1592, bemoaning the decayed state of the Paul's Cross sermons to the privy council, he laid all the blame on his chaplain of twelve years' standing, William Cotton.<br>
<br>Although an able and respected scholar Aylmer exhibited no inclination to make a contribution to the major controversies of his time. George Orwell admired the <span class="italic">Harborowe</span> as a landmark in the history of political literature (it contains the striking marginal note &#145;God is English&#146;), but when Walter Travers's <span class="italic">De disciplina</span> appeared in early 1574 to pump iron into presbyterian muscles, Aylmer refused Parker's request to answer it and failed to return the copy Parker had sent him. In 1581, pleading ill health, he declined to answer Edmund Campion.<br>
<br>Strype bent over backwards to emphasize those passages in his letters which spoke of his friendship with and dependence upon Burghley but they were largely drawn from those which show him at his most grovelling. There can be little doubt that in fact Burghley regarded his elevation as an unmitigated disaster, and his long-drawn game of cat-and-mouse with Aylmer must be accounted one of the least glorious strands in his career. It also involves a conundrum. Given Aylmer's divisiveness and his frequent requests for translation to a less burdensome diocese, why was Burghley unable or unwilling to engineer it?<br>
