<span class="headword">Smith,  Michael Holroyd</span>  (1847&#150;1932), <span class="occ">engineer</span>, was born on 22 December 1847 at Wade Street, Halifax, Yorkshire, the second of six sons, and the fourth of the eleven children of Matthew Smith (1819&#150;1880), wire manufacturer, and his wife, Mary Sutcliffe, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Holroyd, daughter of Richard Holroyd of Halifax. His paternal ancestors were Yorkshire dissenting ministers who had settled in Halifax in the eighteenth century. His father managed a wire mill in Birmingham before returning to Halifax in 1864 to enter into partnership in the wire manufacturing firm of Frederick Smith &amp; Co. founded by his younger brother in 1859. He died during his term of office as mayor of Halifax in 1880. His mother, renowned for her beauty, was a Halifax watchmaker and jeweller's daughter. He was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham. After serving an apprenticeship with Francis Berry &amp; Sons, machine tool makers of Sowerby Bridge, Yorkshire, he worked with the family firm in Halifax before embarking on a career as a consultant engineer, designing mills, testing engines, and investigating the causes of industrial accidents. He then became a partner in Smith, Baker &amp; Co., of Cornbrook, Manchester, and made some of the earliest telephones, telephone exchanges, and phonographs in Britain. On 22 June 1874 he married, at the English Presbyterian Chapel, Tywyn, Machynlleth, Montgomeryshire, Anne Williams (1848&#150;1934), the daughter of Ebenezer Williams, a Welsh nonconformist minister. He and his wife lived in Wales after their marriage, at Maenan Hall, Llanrwst, Denbighshire. Their eldest daughter was the writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56910/', "Naomi Gwladys Royde-Smith")</script>.<br>
<br>Smith was considered within the family to have lacked the business acumen of his elder brother, Sir George Henry Fisher-Smith, but he was a brilliant and prolific inventor, who became a pioneer of the electric tramway, earning the sobriquet &#145;the father of electric traction&#146;  (<span class="italic">Halifax Courier</span>, 6 July 1932). By 1882 he recognized the potential advantages of electric traction over cable traction. In 1883 he built three experimental narrow-gauge electric tramways, one in his father's warehouse, the other two in the grounds of Moorside, Skircoat Green, Halifax, the home of a friend, the carpet manufacturer Louis John Crossley, who had installed a private electrical laboratory in his home. From his experimental work in Halifax Smith arranged a demonstration of a standard-gauge conduit tramway line at his Manchester works and then at the winter gardens, Blackpool. This led to the formation of the Blackpool Electric Tramway Company in 1885 and the commissioning of a 2 mile service along the promenade from Claremont Park to South Shore. This was the first electric tramway for public use in Britain, powered by a conduit in the track which was later superseded by overhead power transmission. Six of the ten directors of the tramway company were from Halifax, including the chairman, Richard Horsfall, and the tramway was constructed by Halifax engineers.<br>
<br>Smith was later responsible for the electrification of the City and South London Railway. He also developed an early interest in aviation, delivering in 1879 a lecture to the Halifax Literary and Philosophical Society illustrated with airborne models, and he contributed to the design of the aeroplane propeller blade. He also designed his own reel for engaging in his favourite sport of angling. He was a prolific lecturer and conducted pioneering evening classes in engineering at the Halifax Mechanics' Institute until 1885, contributing to the development of technical education. He was described by Sir Hiram S. Maxim as &#145;a very clever and scientific engineer&#146;  (Bond, <span class="italic">Transactions of the Halifax Antiquarian Society</span>, 133). He was affable by nature and regarded by one of his friends as &#145;the most lovable man I know&#146;  (Smith, 88). A photograph of him in middle age reveals a man of slim build with receding fair hair, an aquiline nose, and neatly trimmed moustache. He was deeply religious, attending regularly Sion Congregational Chapel in Halifax, where he became Sunday school superintendent, until his move to Wales. He died at his home, Maenan Hall, Llanrwst, Denbighshire, on 6 July 1932, from gastric influenza and kidney failure.<br>
