<span class="headword">Portman, Sir  William</span>, sixth baronet  (1643&#150;1690), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 5 September 1643, the only son of Sir William Portman (<i>d</i>. 1645) of Orchard Portman, Somerset, the fifth baronet, and Anna Colles of Barton, Pitminster, Somerset. The family was strongly royalist, his father being expelled from parliament in 1644. Taken prisoner at Naseby, his father had died in the Tower of London. By the Restoration the family's losses were calculated at &pound;30,000, over and above a delinquency fine of &pound;7000 paid by the elder Portman's executors.<br>
<br>Portman inherited the title on his father's death in August 1645. He matriculated from All Souls College, Oxford, in 1659, was made a knight of the Bath in April 1661, and took his father's old seat of Taunton in the same month. He held it until his death in 1690, with interludes in the October 1679 and 1681 parliaments when he sat as one of Somerset's two knights of the shire. The family fortunes were repaired, enabling him to become one of the most influential gentry in the south-west: partly by the financial retrenchment allowed by his long minority, partly by three lucrative marriages. His marriage on 14 November 1661 to Elizabeth Cutler, daughter and coheir of Sir John Cutler of Westminster, brought with it a marriage portion of &pound;30,000. After her death in 1673 he married, on 23 October 1674, Elizabeth Southcote (<i>d</i>. 1680), daughter of Sir Thomas Southcote of Buckland All Saints, Devon, heir to her brother George. Finally, on 19 April 1682 he married, with a portion of &pound;10,000, Mary Holman, the daughter and coheir of Sir John Holman of Banbury; she too seems to have died before him. Portman was able to add to his Somerset property the estate of Bryanston in east Dorset. He became an early fellow of the Royal Society in 1664, though nothing is known of his scientific interests.<br>
<br>Portman's family seat at Orchard Portman lay just to the south of Taunton, and despite the town's reputation for faction and disloyalty during (and after) the civil war he did his duty as its MP, working energetically in the bitter struggle for the restoration of its charter, lost at the Restoration. When depression struck the town's cloth trade hundreds of workers and their families marched out to Portman's house to claim relief. In 1679 he was a loyal and respected figure both locally and nationally, a deputy lieutenant for both Somerset and Dorset, and colonel of a regiment of the latter county's militia. By then, however, Titus Oates's allegations of a popish plot to kill Charles II and place on the throne his Catholic brother James, duke of York, had gained widespread credence, and Portman was one of the many moderate royalist gentry who for some time believed in the plot. He spoke against the duke of York in the House of Commons, associated with whig radicals in Somerset, and was expected to entertain the duke of Monmouth during the latter's tour of the west in 1680. His support for action over the plot and for the exclusion of the duke of York was, however, always qualified by his basic royalism. In the March election of 1679 he was &#145;not Fanatic enough&#146; for many voters, just scraping in ahead of John Trenchard, while a friend warned radicals in the same year that though Portman was &#145;against Popery and the Duke of York, yet he is firm to King and Church&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1679&#150;80</i>, 77, 514). This firmness grew as the exclusion crisis deepened, and by 1681 Portman had begun to drink the health of the duke of York and repented of his Commons' speech against him. Government investigations into the Rye House plot of 1683 gave him the opportunity to prove his loyalty, and none was more zealous in examining suspects, searching houses, checking the books of local gunsmiths, and scrutinizing the loads of local waggoners. He earned frequent and warm praise from the secretary of state, but uncovered no real conspiracy in the west.<br>
<br>On 3 June 1685 Portman received an anonymous letter warning of the duke of Monmouth's intention to invade, and reacted with characteristic vigour, searching coaches and mails throughout Somerset. During the rebellion he displayed judgement and ability, and his Dorset troops were the only militia to emerge with credit from the campaign. He captured Monmouth and his associate Ford, Lord Grey, near Ringwood in the New Forest three days after the battle of Sedgemoor, and personally escorted them to London. He disapproved, however, of James II's subsequent Catholicizing campaign and withdrew from public life: he was dismissed as deputy lieutenant and JP when he replied in the negative to the canvass of support for the repeal of the <span class="roman">Penal and Test Acts</span>. When William invaded in 1688 Portman was among the gentry who waited on him at Exeter and was busy in raising a loan for him. His early support for William served him well at the 1689 election: at Taunton he triumphed over John Trenchard, who had collaborated with James. Portman then destroyed his chance of office by opposing the motion to make William and Mary king and queen. By then, however, he was in poor health. He died suddenly in March 1690.<br>
<br>The bequests in Portman's will locate him firmly within the networks of west country gentry: the list of his godchildren alone includes the names of Stawell, Erle, Wallop, Windham, and Speke, the last named the son of his cousin, the whig <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26099/', "George Speke")</script> of White Lackington. Practically, he requested no funeral sermon, &#145;seing it will hinder my friends from returning to their homes in good time&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/401, fol. 253<i>r</i>). Bequests to his servants and his day labourers confirmed a reputation for paternalist charity. He laid down that he should be buried within the family vault at Orchard Portman within a fortnight of his death, if he died there, and within three weeks if he died at his other seat of Bryanston. Despite his three marriages he remained childless, bequeathing name, title, and estate (worth &pound;8000 p.a.) to his nephew Edward Seymour, who died in 1728.<br>
