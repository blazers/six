<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Disney,  John</span>  (1746&#150;1816), <span class="occ">Unitarian minister</span>, the third son of John Disney of Lincoln and his wife, Frances Cartwright of Ossington, Nottinghamshire, was born on 28 September 1746 at Swinderby in Lincolnshire. His grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7684/', "John Disney (1677&#150;1730)")</script> was rector of St Mary's, Nottingham, but his ancestors were zealous nonconformists. Disney was educated at Wakefield grammar school under John Clark, and then at Lincoln grammar school. He was intended for the bar, but his health broke down under preliminary studies and he turned to the church. He entered Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1764, and after graduation was ordained in 1768; in 1770 he proceeded LLB. His sympathies with the latitudinarians within the Church of England quickly became evident; he appeared as a writer in April 1768 in defence of Archdeacon Francis Blackburne's <span class="italic">The Confessional</span> (1766). Immediately after his ordination he was appointed honorary chaplain to Edmund Law, master of Peterhouse, bishop of Carlisle, and a latitudinarian whig. In 1769 he was presented to the vicarage of Swinderby, Lincolnshire, and soon afterwards to the rectory of Panton, in another part of the same county; he held both livings, residing at Swinderby. On 17 November 1774 he married Jane (<i>d</i>. 1809), the eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2513/', "Archdeacon Francis Blackburne")</script>.<br>
<br>Disney became an active member of the Feathers Tavern Association formed on 17 July 1771 to promote a petition to parliament for relief of the clergy from subscription to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> of the Church of England [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93823', "Feathers tavern petitioners")</script>]. The petition was rejected by the House of Commons on 6 February 1772. Disney did not immediately follow the example of his friend Theophilus Lindsey, who resigned his benefice in the following year (on his way to London in December 1773, Lindsey stayed for more than a week at Swinderby). Like some others, Disney chose to accommodate the public service to suit his special views. The Athanasian creed he had always ignored; he now omitted the Nicene creed and the <span class="roman">litany</span>, and made other changes in reading the common prayer. On 5 June 1775 the University of Edinburgh made him DD, through the influence of Bishop Law with the principal, William Robertson; in 1778 he was admitted a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries.<br>
<br>Temporarily Disney found in secular duties and political action a sedative for his religious scruples. He was an energetic magistrate, and while staying at Flintham Hall, near Newark, the seat of his eldest brother, he joined in 1780 the Nottingham county committee for retrenchment and parliamentary reform. But in November 1782 he resigned his preferments, and offered his services as colleague to his friend Lindsey at the Unitarian chapel in Essex Street, London. At the end of December he moved to London with his family, having been engaged at a stipend of &pound;150. He justified his decision in <span class="italic">Reasons for resigning the rectory of Panton and vicarage of Swinderby, in Lincolnshire, and quitting the Church of England</span> (1782). In 1783 Disney became the first secretary of a Unitarian Society for Promoting the Knowledge of the Scriptures. On the retirement of Lindsey from active duty in July 1793, Disney became sole minister. The services at Essex Street had been conducted by means of a modified common prayer book, on the basis of a revision made by Samuel Clarke (1675&#150;1729). In 1802 Disney introduced a new form of his own composition, but the congregation, on his retirement, immediately reverted to the old version.<br>
<br>Disney's resignation of office was occasioned by a large bequest of property, which reached him in a curious way. Thomas Hollis (<i>d</i>. 1774) had left his estates in Dorset to his friend Thomas Brand of The Hyde, near Ingatestone, Essex, who took the name of Hollis. Brand Hollis (<i>d</i>. 1804), by a will dated 1792, left both estates, worth about &pound;5000 a year, to Disney, who resigned his ministry on 25 March 1805 on the grounds of ill health, and in the following June left London and took up his residence at The Hyde. He was succeeded at Essex Street by Thomas Belsham. The rest of his life was spent in the literary and agricultural pursuits of a country gentleman. He took part in various representations to parliament which resulted in the act of 1813 &#145;to relieve persons who impugn the doctrine of the Holy Trinity from certain penalties&#146;. He continued to support political reform: in 1806 he declined to advise his Dorset tenants as to how they should vote in the county election, commenting only &#145;I know of no recommendation more important or pressing, or more constitutional than that of the candidate's being well disposed towards a legal reform in the constitution of that parliament of which they solicit to become members&#146;  (Disney to E. Patten, 29 Oct 1806, Wyvill of Constable Burton MSS).<br>
<br>Disney was a prolific author, with some forty-five separate works to his credit; they included memoirs of latitudinarians such as Arthur Ashley (1785) and Edmund Law (1800) and Unitarians such as John Jebb (1787) and Michael Dodson (1800). Two volumes of his sermons were published in 1793 and two more in 1816: Socinian in their theology, they show his extreme anti-trinitarianism, which went as far as the denial of even the pre-existence of Christ.<br>
<br>In his later years Disney lived for some time in Bath, attempting to recover his declining health and withdrawing from political involvements. He died at The Hyde on 26 December 1816, and was buried in the churchyard of Fryerning, Essex. He left three children, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7686/', "John Disney")</script>, Algernon, who entered the army, and Frances Mary, wife of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14797/', "Thomas Jervis")</script>. A collection of literature related to <span class="italic">The Confessional</span> controversy, which had been arranged by Disney in fourteen volumes, was deposited at Dr Williams's Library, of which he had been a trustee from 1796 to 1806. As a minister, memoirist, and a religious and political writer Disney was an important, if secondary, figure in the development of English Unitarianism.<br>
