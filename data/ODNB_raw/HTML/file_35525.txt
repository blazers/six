<span class="headword">Pickford,  William</span>, Baron Sterndale  (1848&#150;1923), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 1 October 1848 in Manchester, the second son of Thomas Edward Pickford, a merchant there, and his wife, Georgina, daughter of Jeremiah Todd-Naylor, of Liverpool. The Pickfords came from Prestbury in Cheshire: James Pickford, who died in 1768, was a waggoner between Manchester and London; his son Matthew, and his grandson Thomas (Pickford's grandfather) developed a big carrier's business, and the latter took Joseph Baxendale into partnership. The Baxendales eventually took over but retained the name, Pickford's.<br>
<br>Pickford's father died in 1859 and his mother moved to Liverpool soon after. Pickford was educated at Liverpool College before going in 1867 to Exeter College, Oxford, where he obtained second classes in classical moderations (1870) and in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1872). He was elected an honorary fellow in 1916. In 1871 he entered as a student of the Inner Temple, where he was taught by Thomas Henry Baylis and was called to the bar in 1874. In 1875 he joined the northern circuit, and began at the local bar at Liverpool, having his chambers for a few years at 22 North John Street, and from 1879 at Commerce Chambers, Harrington Street. He had to wait some years before he acquired a practice, largely in commercial affairs, but with the usual mix of work common to a provincial practice. In 1889 he was counsel at the police court and junior counsel at the assizes for Mrs Maybrick in her sensational case.<br>
<br>In 1880 Pickford married Alice Mary, daughter of John William Brooke, of Sibton Park, Yoxford, Suffolk; she died in 1884, leaving two daughters, including the politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50058/', "Mary Ada Pickford")</script>, for him to bring up alone. In 1892 Pickford moved to London, where he had begun to spend an increasing amount of time, in particular in the Admiralty court where he conducted almost all the collision and salvage cases for Liverpool shipowners or solicitors. He made London his headquarters with chambers at 2 Mitre Court Buildings, Temple. In 1893 he became queen's counsel, at the same time as Charles Swinfen Eady (afterwards first baron Swinfen), whom he was to succeed as master of the rolls twenty-six years later.<br>
<br>Pickford continued to work on the northern circuit and soon became its <i>de facto</i> leader. But the growth of his business in London made his visits to the north less and less frequent. As an advocate he never had the brilliance of more famous colleagues, but he could get what he wanted from a jury as well as, or better than, even the most renowned nineteenth- and early twentieth-century judges. Nor was he merely a jury advocate. The earlier volumes of the <span class="italic">Commercial Cases</span> show that he had a large share of the work of the commercial court during its busiest days from its foundation in 1895 until he became a judge.<br>
<br>In 1901 Pickford was made recorder of Oldham, and in 1904 recorder of Liverpool. In 1902 he became a bencher of the Inner Temple. In 1905 he was leading counsel for Great Britain at the inquiry held in Paris into the attack by the Russian fleet on the Hull trawlers at the Dogger Bank. In 1905 he was sent as commissioner of assize on the north-eastern circuit, the usual prelude to promotion to the King's Bench.<br>
<br>Following parliament's sanction of the appointment of an additional judge of the High Court, King's Bench Division, Pickford was selected for the post by the lord chancellor, Lord Loreburn, in 1907 and received the usual knighthood. It was Loreburn's first judicial appointment and met with general approval. Pickford proved an ideal judge: he was not a very learned lawyer, and he had no brilliance of style or expression; but in the substance of his decisions he was almost invariably right. He possessed that quality which makes for efficiency in a judge and happiness in the individual: he could make up his mind without being worried whether he was right and could forget all about a case as soon as it was over. He was equally successful in trying criminals or civil cases, and in working with a jury or sitting alone in the commercial court.<br>
<br>As a young lawyer, Pickford had been active in the proceedings of the International Maritime Committee and other movements for the unification of maritime law. In 1905, while still at the bar, he had been the senior British representative at the Brussels conference which formulated the conventions as to collision and salvage, given legal force in England by the <span class="roman">Maritime Conventions Act</span> of 1911. As a judge, he took a prominent part in the later conferences which formulated conventions about limitation of liability and mortgages and maritime liens. He also presided in 1923 over a select committee of both houses of parliament to consider the bill which became the <span class="roman">Carriage of Goods by Sea Act</span> of 1924.<br>
<br>In 1914, on the resignation of Sir Roland Bowdler Vaughan Williams, Pickford was promoted to the Court of Appeal as lord justice and sworn of the privy council. Although he had little of the erudition of his predecessor, he was a much more efficient judge, and proved successful in the Court of Appeal.<br>
<br>In July 1916 the bill to set up a commission &#145;to inquire into the origin, inception, and conduct of operations in the Dardanelles&#146; was introduced. In the House of Lords Lord Cromer, the designated chairman, proposed that someone of judicial experience should be added to the commissioners named in the bill as it came from the Commons, and, as a result, Pickford attended the laborious meetings of the commission. An interim report was issued before the death of Lord Cromer, on 29 January 1917, when Lord Justice Pickford was selected by his colleagues to succeed as chairman. The final report signed by him was published on 8 March 1917. Pickford also presided over a &#145;conscientious objectors&#146; tribunal in Chelsea. Unlike some others, he did the work judicially.<br>
<br>On the death in September 1918 of Sir Samuel Thomas Evans, Pickford with some reluctance accepted the post of president of the Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty Division of the High Court. He was then raised to the peerage as a baron. He took the title Lord Sterndale after a small estate at King Sterndale, near Buxton, in Derbyshire, which had been purchased by his great-grandfather. In London he lived first at 92 Elm Park Gardens, and from 1910 onwards at Queen's House, a fine Queen Anne house in Cheyne Walk. The First World War ended about two months after Sterndale's appointment to the Admiralty court, and in a year he had disposed of most of the important prize cases. In October 1919, on the resignation of Swinfen Eady very shortly before his death, he was appointed master of the rolls. He was thus spared the trial of divorce suits and collision and salvage cases, and gladly returned to the Court of Appeal as its president.<br>
<br>After spending an active day in a hayfield at King Sterndale, and going to bed seemingly in the excellent health which he had always enjoyed, Sterndale was found dead the following morning, 17 August 1923. He was buried at King Sterndale on 22 August. Since he did not have a son, the barony became extinct.<br>
<br>Pickford was described as a tall, handsome man. He was a prominent freemason but never took part in politics, and had no ambitions to stand for parliament. He was also quite a sportsman, having been a keen cyclist, cricketer, and beagler in his youth, and was an active member of the Alpine Club, to which he was elected in 1894, serving as president from 1914 to 1916. He was also said to have been a good judge of port, and was a member of the Athenaeum and United Oxford and Cambridge clubs.<br>
