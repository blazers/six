<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Quin,  Windham Thomas  Wyndham-</span>, fourth earl of Dunraven and Mount Earl  (1841&#150;1926), <span class="occ">politician and yachtsman</span>, was born at Adare Manor, co. Limerick, on 12 February 1841. He was the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22959/', "Edwin Richard Windham Wyndham-Quin, third earl (1812&#150;1871)")</script>, and his first wife, Augusta (<i>d</i>. 1866), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11009/', "Thomas Goold")</script>, master in chancery in Ireland. During his boyhood his father, who had been under the influence of the Tractarian movement, joined the Roman Catholic church. Lady Dunraven, however, remained strongly protestant; the boy was sent to Rome for education, and forbidden to communicate with his mother. This produced an obstinate resistance. Lord Adare, as he then was, after some tuition in Paris, went to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1858.<br>
<br>After three idle years at Oxford, Adare entered the army in 1862, as cornet in the first Life Guards, and with his troop saw the &#145;battle of Hyde Park&#146; on 23 July 1866, when the crowd threw down the railings as a protest against the cabinet's prohibition of a meeting of the Reform League. He rode steeplechases, being a very light weight, and raced a little; but already the passion of his life was sailing, and his leaves were mostly spent on a yacht. In 1867, when the military expedition to Abyssinia was announced, Adare contrived to get the post of war correspondent for the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, and was present at the capture of Magdala. He again acted for the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> in the war of 1870 between France and Prussia, and witnessed the earlier battles from the Prussian crown prince's headquarters. He spent the winter of 1870&#150;71 at Versailles, and was present when the king of Prussia was proclaimed German emperor. There, in 1919, he saw the signing of the peace between the allies and defeated Germany: he was the only person who was present on both occasions.<br>
<br>Adare married on 29 April 1869 Florence Elizabeth (1841&#150;1916), second daughter of Lord Charles Lennox Kerr; they had three daughters, two of whom predeceased him. In 1871 he succeeded to the peerage, taking his seat in the House of Lords as second Baron Kenry, a United Kingdom title granted to his father in 1866; he inherited estates in county Limerick, but his wealth was mostly derived from his lands in south Wales. He went to America (which he had visited with his wife in 1869) for big game shooting. He was introduced by General Sheridan to Buffalo Bill (William Cody) and Texas Jack, and with these famous scouts he shot buffalo and wapiti about the Platte River during the Indian wars. He purchased a ranch in Colorado, which was later neglected and a troublesome incubus to its owner. In 1874 he again went to the United States, accompanied Dr George Henry Kingsley, and explored the Yellowstone region. His observations were published as <span class="italic">The Great Divide</span> (1876). From this time on for sixteen years he yearly crossed to North America for sport, especially in Canada and Newfoundland.<br>
<br>Unlike his predecessors, who had lived chiefly at Dunraven Castle, Glamorgan, Dunraven made his home at Adare, co. Limerick. In 1880 he wrote to the American press in defence of Irish landlords, and published the first of his many pamphlets on Irish public affairs, <span class="italic">The Irish Question</span>. In politics, Dunraven became closely associated with Lord Randolph Churchill. He was president of the Fair Trade League (whose views he represented in the royal commission on the depression of trade in 1885) and in April 1883 published in the <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span> a tory-democratic manifesto with Churchill's support. This document called for the reorganization of the Conservative Party along Chamberlainite lines, denounced radicalism as essentially &#145;communistic&#146;, and advocated protectionism and imperialism. In 1885&#150;6 and again in 1886&#150;7 he was under-secretary for the colonies in Lord Salisbury's administration but resigned, ostensibly because he thought the government unfair to Newfoundland in the controversy with France over the fishery question, but really in support of Lord Randolph Churchill. In 1889 he was offered but declined the governorship of Cape Colony.<br>
<br>Turning his attention to social subjects, Dunraven moved in the House of Lords for the appointment of a committee on sweated labour, carried his motion, and was appointed chairman (1888&#150;90). He considered that much later legislation sprang from its recommendations. In 1895 he was elected a London county councillor for Wandsworth, and took a particular interest in the provision of working-class housing. A different task was the chairmanship in 1896 of the commission on Irish horse breeding. His stud at Adare was famous and successful. He raced a good deal, but his interest lay chiefly in breeding: Desmond was the most famous of his sires.<br>
<br>In the years before 1900, however, Dunraven was chiefly known to the public as a yachtsman and faced criticism for neglecting his political duty for this sport. He competed for the America's Cup in 1893 and 1895 with two specially built yachts, <i>Valkyrie II</i> and <i>Valkyrie III</i>&#151;both times unsuccessfully. In the second contest against the American <i>Defender</i> he withdrew from the third race, being dissatisfied with the keeping of the course. His subsequent protest in a pamphlet created much acrimony, and he was struck off the membership of the New York yacht club. Dunraven took out his certificate as master and extra master, and in 1900 published <span class="italic">Self-Instruction in the Practice and Theory of Navigation</span>, primarily for the use of yachtsmen. This training enabled him in the First World War to take command of the steam yacht <i>Grianaig</i> (bought and run at his own expense) for service as a hospital ship.<br>
<br>Dunraven's interest in Ireland revived in the early 1900s. In 1902 George Wyndham, as chief secretary, was contending with a renewed outburst of land agitation, when the idea of a conference between representatives of landlords and tenants was suggested in a public letter by Captain John Shawe-Taylor, a young Galway squire. Wyndham recognized the political usefulness of the idea and gave it official endorsement. It was also accepted by the nationalist leaders, but repudiated by the Irish Landlords' Convention. However, a group of landlords, of whom Dunraven was chief, set up an organization which polled the lieutenants and deputy lieutenants of Ireland on the question and secured 103 votes for conference against 33 opposing. After further proceedings, the landlords' convention having renewed its refusal, a poll of individual landlords nominated four representatives, Lord Mayo, Colonel Sir Hutcheson Poe, Colonel Nugent Everard, and Lord Dunraven. When the conference of eight assembled, Dunraven was named chairman on the motion of John Redmond. After long and difficult negotiation a unanimous report recommended a general policy of land purchase, and specified terms. This became the basis of the <span class="roman">Wyndham Land Act</span> (1903), which settled the policy that Irish landlords should, without exception, be bought out and the occupier become the owner. The actual terms agreed at the conference were less important to Dunraven than the opportunity it provided for presenting the bill as a &#145;final solution&#146; to the land question, reached by conciliatory means.<br>
<br>This achievement was the great success of Dunraven's life, and naturally led him to attempt more. However, his hopes received a setback when William O'Brien, the foremost nationalist advocate of &#145;conciliation&#146;, resigned from the party in November 1903. In 1904 the Land Conference was revived as the Irish Reform Association, which advocated the policy of &#145;devolution&#146;, a partial transfer of Irish administration and legislation to an Irish assembly. Dunraven hoped that such self-government within the UK would restore the landlords to their natural place as architects of Irish social regeneration. Sir Antony MacDonnell, the under-secretary, helped to draft the proposals which, when published in 1905, were denounced by extreme nationalists and unionists alike, with the result that the scheme broke down and Wyndham was forced into resigning the chief secretaryship. Dunraven did not abandon his hopes for conciliation, and when O'Brien returned to active political life and launched a new organization, the All-for-Ireland League, in 1909, he gave it public support.<br>
<br>In the struggle over the <span class="roman">Home Rule Bill</span> and the <span class="roman">Parliament Act</span>, Dunraven played a cross-bench part. His last opportunity to forward what he always believed in, a settlement of the Irish difficulty by conciliation between different sections of the Irish community, came with the Irish Convention in 1917, in which he advocated a solution on federal lines. But there, as elsewhere, he lacked one of the main qualifications of a political leader: he had neither the equipment nor the temperament of an orator. Dunraven was saddened by partition and by the violence of 1919&#150;21, but he supported the Anglo-Irish treaty of 1921. In January 1922 he urged southern unionists to recognize the Irish provisional government and support its efforts to restore order. He was among the members nominated by President Cosgrave to serve on the first senate of the Irish Free State in June 1921.<br>
<br>Physically, Dunraven was a small, sturdy man with a weathered face. Few of his contemporaries touched life at more points, and although he experimented in many directions, he dropped nothing that interested him, while his physical endurance permitted. A large experiment in tobacco-growing at Adare was checked by the accidental burning of his factory in 1916; but even so he continued to grow as much Turkish leaf as would supply the cigarette factory that he had established. He also constantly advocated the serious development of fish supply by hatcheries, both freshwater and marine, for the British Isles. Politically, his career was eccentric and unsuccessful. His early adherence to Lord Randolph Churchill ruled out any significant role in British politics after 1887. In Ireland the &#145;Dunravenites&#146; were always a small minority of protestant landowners, dependent on the sympathetic ear of Dublin Castle for success. Their weakness was compounded particularly in 1904&#150;5 by ineptitude in political tactics and their limited strategic vision. The failure to resolve the contradiction between unionism and devolution had disastrous political consequences for the advocates of &#145;constructive unionism&#146;. In the course of his life Dunraven published a number of pamphlets defending his political opinions. His memoirs were published in 1922 as <span class="italic">Past Times and Pastimes</span>. He died at his home, 22 Norfolk Street, Park Lane, London, on 14 June 1926, and was succeeded by his cousin Windham Henry Wyndham-Quin.<br>
