<span class="headword">Coward,  Thomas Alfred</span>  (1867&#150;1933), <span class="occ">ornithologist and journalist</span>, was born on 8 January 1867, at Higher Downs Road, Bowdon, Cheshire, the youngest of the four children of Thomas and Sarah Coward. His father, who was engaged in textile bleaching, was also a much respected Congregational minister at Rusholme Road Chapel. He was educated at a school in Sale, Cheshire, before entering the family firm of Melland and Coward, bleachers, where he worked for about nineteen years. When the firm was taken over by a larger enterprise he gave up the career of a businessman and devoted himself to natural history, supplementing his private income by writing articles for a variety of journals and newspapers. His interest in natural history had been encouraged by a neighbour, Joseph Sidebotham, a noted lepidopterist, and by his father, who had been a founder of the Manchester Natural History Society and had helped to establish its collection, later transferred to the Manchester Museum.<br>
<br>Coward's many writings on natural history appeared in magazines of general interest, such as <span class="italic">Chambers Journal</span>, <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span>, <span class="italic">The Field</span>, and <span class="italic">Country Life</span>; and in journals devoted to particular interests, such as <span class="italic">The Zoologist</span>, <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Zoological Society</span>, <span class="italic">British Birds</span>, and <span class="italic">Memoirs and Proceedings of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society</span>. He also wrote articles for newspapers, including the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>; later in his life he became a successful broadcaster. Coward's literary style was notably clear and his lectures had the same quality. His first book, <span class="italic">The Birds of Cheshire</span>, written in collaboration with a former schoolfellow, was published in 1900. <span class="italic">Vertebrate Fauna of Cheshire</span> came out in 1910. In 1912 he wrote <span class="italic">The Migration of Birds</span> for the <span class="roman">Cambridge Manuals of Science and Literature</span> (2nd edn, 1929). Best-known among his many works, however, is his <span class="italic">Birds of the British Isles and their Eggs</span>, in three volumes, which was first published in 1919. He also published works on local history, including <span class="italic">Picturesque Cheshire</span> (1903), and <span class="italic">Cheshire Traditions and History</span> (1932).<br>
<br>In 1904 Coward married his cousin, Mary Constance Milne; the two made frequent long journeys together in their studies of natural history. Coward was closely associated with the Manchester Museum. In 1913 he was on the museum committee, and from March 1916 to January 1919 he was acting keeper. In 1922 he was again acting keeper for a short time. Coward was long a member of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, which he joined in 1906 and of which he was president in 1921&#150;3. Coward was a gentle, friendly man, who abhorred cruelty in all its forms. He died following a heart attack on 29 January 1933 at his home, Brentwood, Grange Road, Lower Bowdon, Cheshire: his wife survived him. Two nature reserves, Cotterill Clough and Marbury reed-bed, are dedicated to his memory.<br>
