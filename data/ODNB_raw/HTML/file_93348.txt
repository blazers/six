<div class="para">
<span class="headword">West,  Henry William <span class="st"> [Harry]</span></span>  (1917&#150;2004), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 27 March 1917 at Mullaghmeen, Enniskillen, co. Fermanagh, the son of William Henry West, farmer and secretary of the county council, and his wife, Harriet Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Spence. He attended Enniskillen Model School and Portora Royal School, where he was a keen sportsman and captained the rugby, rowing, and boxing teams. (Later he was a governor of Portora, in which capacity he once tried to sack a history master who had taught his pupils about the Easter rising.) Plans to study agriculture at Queen's University, Belfast, had to be shelved when his father died and, at the age of seventeen, he had to leave school to run the family farm. He became active in the agricultural world, and was a member of the British Wool Marketing Board from 1950 to 1958 and president of the Ulster Farmers' Union from 1955 to 1956. On 22 August 1956 he married Maureen Elizabeth Hall, a 24-year-old schoolteacher, and daughter of George Hall, civil servant. They had four sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>West entered politics in 1954 when he was asked to stand as Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) candidate for the Enniskillen constituency at Stormont on the death of the sitting Unionist member, T. C. Nelson. At the time he had no political experience, being neither a local councillor nor even a member of the Orange order&#151;which may be explained by his Presbyterianism, the order's membership in Fermanagh being largely drawn from the Church of Ireland, which was by far the largest protestant denomination in that county. However, he was linked by marriage to the Coopers and Fergusons, two of the leading families in Fermanagh Unionism. He was elected unopposed at the by-election and at subsequent general elections in 1958 and 1962. In 1965 he defeated a Liberal candidate and in 1969 won against candidates from the student radical organization, People's Democracy, and O'Neillite Unionism.<br>
<br>At Stormont West became parliamentary secretary to the minister of agriculture in 1958, and was himself appointed minister of agriculture in 1960. It was the Fermanagh man Lord Brookeborough who gave him both positions, and West regarded Brookeborough as his best friend. There was little warmth in his relationship with Brookeborough's successor as prime minister from 1963, Terence O'Neill. Like many other Unionists in border areas West distrusted O'Neill's modernizing and reformist approach, which they feared would undermine Unionist control of counties like Fermanagh and Tyrone, where Catholic majorities were nullified by gerrymandering and a property-based franchise for local government elections. When O'Neill invited the Irish taoiseach to Stormont in January 1965 West refused to meet him on the grounds that the prime minister had not informed the cabinet in advance of the visit. However, despite growing grassroots criticism of O'Neill, when in 1966 a number of Unionist MPs urged the prominent right-wing minister Brian Faulkner to stand against O'Neill, West urged Faulkner not to stand.<br>
<br>Nevertheless in April 1967 O'Neill forced West to resign over a land deal he had made in 1964 when he bought a farm from his cousin at Rossahilly. His purchase became an issue because the farm bordered a small airfield at St Angelo that was being considered for development by Fermanagh council, and part of the Rossahilly land was suitable for the extension. West was sacked not for the original purchase but for ignoring advice by the attorney-general that, if he sold part of the land to the council, he should abide by any price set by the commissioner of valuation. West considered the valuation too low and appealed to the lands tribunal without informing the attorney-general or O'Neill. In his statement justifying the dismissal O'Neill claimed that while there was no question of dishonesty West had violated the code recently introduced to govern ministers' business interests. West maintained that O'Neill had unjustly blackened his character and that he was being sacked for his political opposition to O'Neill's reforms, an argument supported not just by Brian Faulkner but by the Republican Labour MP Harry Diamond.<br>
<br>Many Unionists in border areas saw West's dismissal as part of an O'Neillite strategy to buy off nationalists by sacrificing the west of the province. O'Neill's resignation in April 1969 did not lead to a lessening of such complaints. In the election to choose a successor West supported Faulkner, who lost by one vote to James Chichester-Clark. In the aftermath of serious communal violence in Belfast in August 1969 Chichester-Clark was impelled into a more radical reformist agenda by Harold Wilson and the home secretary, James Callaghan. The report of the advisory committee on police in Northern Ireland, chaired by Lord Hunt, recommended radical reform of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the abolition of the B special constabulary. A major reform of local government was undertaken together with the creation of a new central housing authority. West was in the vanguard of those opposing the Hunt committee's proposals and the local government reforms and accusing the government of being supine in the face of pressure from London. He and other dissidents formed the West Ulster Unionist Council to oppose any reform of local government, and in 1970 he attacked Faulkner who, as minister of development, had accepted the proposals of Sir Patrick Macrory for a streamlining of local government. In March 1970 he and four other prominent dissidents were expelled from the parliamentary party for voting against the government's <span class="roman">Police Bill</span>, which was introducing the Hunt reforms.<br>
<br>In March 1971 West was recalled to office as minister of agriculture when Faulkner became prime minister. He subsequently resigned from the West Ulster Unionist Council when it passed a motion of no confidence in the government. In March 1972, when Edward Heath asked Faulkner to cede control of security to Westminster, West advised against the government resigning but was ignored by Faulkner who resigned on 24 March, allowing Heath to impose direct rule and inaugurating a radically new phase in the history of Ulster Unionism. Deprived of control of the state, the party appeared for a while to totter on the brink of disintegration, losing support to the more radical alternatives of Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and from 1973 William Craig's Vanguard Progressive Unionist Party and on the liberal left to the Alliance Party.<br>
<br>West opposed the British government's 1973 white paper setting out its proposals for power-sharing in Northern Ireland and for a council of Ireland. He fought the subsequent elections for the short-lived Northern Ireland Assembly as an &#145;unpledged Unionist&#146;: one of those who refused to sign a pledge to support Faulkner's policy of accepting the white paper. As Faulkner entered into negotiations with the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), which led to the formation of a power-sharing government at the beginning of 1974, West and the right of the UUP joined with Paisley, Craig, and the Orange order to form the United Ulster Unionist Council to oppose power-sharing or any council of Ireland. At the Sunningdale conference at the end of 1973 Faulkner was pressurized by Heath into agreeing a council of Ireland. But on 4 January 1974 the Ulster Unionist Council rejected a council of Ireland and Faulkner resigned.<br>
<br>On 22 January 1974 the Ulster Unionist Party's standing committee elected West as leader by eighty-five votes to forty-three for James Molyneaux. In the Westminster general election of February 1974 eleven of the twelve Ulster seats went to anti-Sunningdale candidates. West won the Fermanagh and South Tyrone seat, due to a split nationalist vote. West, Paisley, and Craig were all co-opted members of the Ulster Workers' Council, the alliance of protestant trade unionists and paramilitaries that called a strike against the power-sharing government. Like many conservative Unionists, West, who had not been consulted about the strike, had little sympathy with the action and was surprised by its success in bringing an end to the executive. His own position as leader of the UUP was dealt a major blow when he lost his Westminster seat at the general election in October 1974. Subsequently his only elected position was as a member of the constitutional convention established by the secretary of state, Merlyn Rees, in 1975.<br>
<br>James Molyneaux, Unionist MP for South Antrim, became leader of the Unionist Parliamentary Party at Westminster, while West remained as leader of the party. Molyneaux had little sympathy for the convention or for West's hope for a deal with the SDLP. He correctly estimated that devolution was only possible on the basis of power-sharing and that West's search for a form of devolution without power-sharing was doomed to failure. Molyneaux came under the influence of the former Conservative politician Enoch Powell, who became Unionist MP for South Down in 1974. West had urged Powell to join the UUP and even said he was willing to cede the leadership to him. However, after the collapse of the convention in 1976 there was growing tension between West, who remained a convinced devolutionist, and Molyneaux and Powell, who supported integration as the best constitutional option for Ulster. In 1979 the UUP put up two candidates in the first direct elections to the European parliament. There were three seats and Paisley (standing for the DUP) won more first preference votes than the two UUP candidates, West and John Taylor, put together. Taylor was elected on Paisley's transfers but the election finished West's leadership. Even his supporters admitted that his lack of an elected position and his low-key approach were severely disadvantaging the party in its competition with the DUP. He resigned in July 1979 and was succeeded by Molyneaux.<br>
<br>In 1981 West contested the Fermanagh and South Tyrone by-election against the sole nationalist candidate, the IRA hunger-striker Bobby Sands. Paisley, who was exploiting protestant anger over the IRA's killing of local part-time members of the Ulster Defence Regiment suggested one of its Fermanagh members who had been targeted by the IRA as a &#145;unity&#146; Unionist candidate but the UUP refused his overtures. The result was a narrow victory for the IRA man: Sands obtained 30,492 votes to West's 29,046. There were 3280 spoiled votes, many of which had &#145;DUP&#146; or the name of the Ulster Defence Regiment man written upon them. Not unreasonably West blamed Paisley for providing the IRA with its biggest propaganda victory since &#145;bloody Sunday&#146;. West continued to play a role in Unionist politics by helping to found the pro-devolution Charter Group, which attacked Molyneaux for his lack of support for devolution. The group was only a marginal influence but West later supported David Trimble and endorsed the Good Friday agreement.<br>
<br>West has often been portrayed as a reactionary but he is better seen as a typical border Unionist, as suspicious of the Unionist establishment in the east of the province as he was of the political ambitions of Ulster Catholics. Lacking in imagination, he failed to see early enough that after 1972 devolution would return to Ulster only on the basis of power-sharing. But although a limited and uninspiring Unionist leader he was no religious bigot. His attendance in 1970 at the requiem mass for the nationalist politician Cahir Healy left him open to criticism from many of his own Orange brethren and from Ian Paisley. Even his political opponents agreed that he was an affable and personable individual. He died on 5 February 2004 at the Erne Hospital, Enniskillen, of heart failure, and was survived by his wife and their seven children.<br>
