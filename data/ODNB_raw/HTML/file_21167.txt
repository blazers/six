<span class="headword">Palliser,  William</span>  (1646&#150;1727), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland archbishop of Cashel</span>, was born at Kirby Wiske in Yorkshire, the son of John Palliser. He received his early education at Northallerton, probably under Thomas Smelt. Having entered Trinity College, Dublin, as a pensioner on 13 January 1661, he became a fellow in 1668 and graduated BD in 1674 and DD in 1679. He married Mary Wheeler, a granddaughter of Jonah Wheeler, bishop of Ossory and son-in-law of Sir Philip Perceval, at an unknown date.<br>
<br>Palliser received deacon's orders at Wexford in November 1669, and priest's orders on the 28th of the following January in St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. He was elected <i>medicus</i> in Trinity College in October 1670, and appointed professor of divinity there in 1678. In the same year he delivered a Latin oration at the funeral of James Margetson, archbishop of Armagh. In October 1681 Palliser resigned his fellowship in Trinity College for the rectory of Clonfeacle, co. Tyrone. However, four days after his resignation he was readmitted as a fellow to Trinity College by dispensation, on his resigning Clonfeacle.<br>
<br>By patent dated 14 February 1693 Palliser was appointed bishop of Cloyne, and was consecrated in the chapel of Trinity College on 5th March. In 1694, on the orders of the government, he prepared an account of the diocese of Cloyne in 1693&#150;4, and supplied with it a plan for union of parishes. He was translated to the archbishopric of Cashel on 26 June 1694, and continued to occupy it until his death at Rathfarnham, Dublin, on 1 January 1727. He was buried in St Andrew's Church, Dublin, later that month. The great wealth which he accumulated was inherited by his only son, William. Archbishop Palliser made a gift of communion plate to the cathedral of Cashel. He donated &pound;1500 to Trinity College, to which he also bequeathed a selection of 4000 of his books, on condition that they should be always kept together as a collection in the college library and designated Bibliotheca Palliseriana.<br>
