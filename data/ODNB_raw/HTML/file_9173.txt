<span class="headword">Farnaby,  Thomas</span>  (1574/5&#150;1647), <span class="occ">schoolteacher and grammarian</span>, was the son of a London carpenter, also named Thomas, and his wife, Dorothy Foxcroft; he was probably the Thomas Fernabye baptized at St Michael Bassishaw, London, on 21 September 1575. According to Wood, he was a relative of the composer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9172/', "Giles Farnaby")</script>, whose father was a London joiner. Farnaby matriculated from Merton College, Oxford, on 26 June 1590, aged fifteen. Thereafter he became a postmaster, or scholar, of the college, but rebelled against his religious antecedents and fled to Spain, where he entered a Jesuit college and converted to Catholicism.<br>
<br>Farnaby was in England once more by 1595 and, &#145;being minded to take a ramble&#146;, obtained a place on the West Indies voyage of Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Hawkins  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.105). Unlike his commanders Farnaby survived the voyage, though his wandering spirit was not quite sated by the experience. According to Wood, he served briefly as a mercenary in the Dutch revolt (it is not known whether he was employed by the rebels or his co-religionists) before returning, penniless, to Cornwall, where he taught in a local school for a number of years under the name Thomas Bainrafe (an anagram of Farnabie). There he met and married a local woman, Susan Pierce, with whom he had two daughters and a son. He then moved to an establishment in Martock, Somerset, where &#145;his distresses made him stoop so low, as to be an Abcdarian&#146;  (ibid., 2.105). He appears to have recovered both reputation and a degree of estate there; in the early years of the new century he moved to London to establish a fee-paying school in Goldsmiths' Rents, off Redcross Street, Cripplegate. Sir John Bramston, a former pupil, called it &#145;a fine airie place; he had joyned two or three gardens and houses togeather, and had a great manie boarders and towne schollars; soe manie that he had 2, sometymes three, ushers besides himselfe&#146;. Describing his own first day there, Bramston recalled Farnaby as a man of some kindness and wit:<blockquote>he gave me pen, ink, and paper, and bid me make a theame on &#145;<i>Ex argill&acirc; quidvis imitaberis ud&acirc;</i>&#146;. I sayd I used to have a weeke to make a theame. I doe not desire much, sayes he, but let me see what thou canst doe. I sett my-selfe to it, and did as well as I could. He came at xj of the clock to see what I had done; and, reading it, cryed out &#145;Oh Heavens! where hast thou binn bred?&#146; &hellip; but I thinke he was unwillinge to discourage me too much. (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 101&#150;2)</blockquote>Farnaby's reputation thrived. According to J. T. Cliffe, he was &#145;[p]erhaps the most celebrated private schoolmaster in England&#146;. He was incorporated at Oxford in 1616 as &#145;M.A. Cambridge&#146;, and he was a minor canon at St Paul's in London from 1626 to 1629. Wood claimed that &#145;more Churchmen and Statesmen issued thence, than from any School taught by one man in <i>England</i>&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.106). Other than Bramston, its pupils included the diplomat Sir Richard Fanshawe, courtier Thomas Henshawe, and the clergyman Henry Killigrew. The success of his establishment allowed Farnaby to devote himself to a long-held obsession: the systemization of the grammatical principles of classical Latin and Greek in print. Commencing with the satires of Juvenal and Persius (1612), he annotated many of the classical authors&#151;Seneca, Martial, Lucan, Ovid, Virgil, and Terence&#151;in a manner intended to render their works intelligible to schoolboys. From 1625, with the publication of his <span class="italic">Index rhetoricus</span> (incorporating the rules of his <span class="italic">Figur&aelig;, tropi et schemata</span> of 1616), he established a European reputation in the rhetorical tradition, and numerous foreign editions appeared. A Greek florilegium followed in 1631, and a compilation of words and phrases utilized in Latin poetry, the <span class="italic">Index poeticus, etc</span>, in 1634. However, despite the financial success he enjoyed (which allowed him to purchase country houses at Otford and Kippington in Kent in the early 1630s), Farnaby remained very sensitive to his former penury, as his jealous defence of his rights indicates. The reimportation from Europe of a great number of his works published inexpensively there reduced his copyright income, and in a series of suits and purchases he reacquired the rights thereon. In April 1632, having petitioned Charles I and the privy council, he obtained a 21-year patent which gave him exclusive rights to publish his own works and prohibited the importation of foreign editions.<br>
<br>Plague and &#145;some underhand dealing of his landlords&#146; forced the removal of Farnaby's school from London to his Otford house in 1636  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.106). By this time his first wife had died. He then married Anne (<i>d</i>. after 1647), daughter of John Howson, bishop of Durham, with whom he had a further two sons. His success continued, and a house and lands at Horsham, Sussex, were added to his estate. Upon the king's personal request Farnaby wrote his final grammarian work, <span class="italic">Systema grammaticum</span>, in 1641 to supersede William Lily's outdated standard. In the same year, civil war broke out; Farnaby's strongly royalist sympathies, and his alleged involvement in a royalist uprising in Kent in 1643, resulted in his imprisonment without charge in Newgate gaol and thereafter upon a prison hulk. Briefly, the Commons considered transporting him to New England (an ironic anticipation of his influence there, as his <span class="italic">Index rhetoricus</span> was later to be one of the first texts used at Harvard). Their inclination, according to Wood, was &#145;further'd by some of his good neighbours in Kent, nay and by some that had been his Scholars &hellip; who sate in the two houses&#146;  (ibid.). However, subsequently given into informal detention at Ely Place, Holborn, Farnaby was allowed to return to Sevenoaks, Kent, in 1645. He was working there on his annotation of Terence's comedies when death intervened on 12 June 1647. He was buried in the chancel of the church at Sevenoaks.<br>
<br>To his wife, Anne, and upon her death to their son, Frances, Farnaby bequeathed his Kippington estate and a third part of the income from lands at Otford, which, like the schoolhouse, he held in leasehold with a number of London merchants and which he stipulated should continue under his name &#145;soe long as it shall please Almighty God&#146;  (will, fol. 148<i>r</i>). John, his eldest son, received the lands and house at Horsham. The evidence of his bequests suggests that only three children&#151;John, Judith, and Frances&#151;survived their father.<br>
<br>Farnaby's connections reflected his reputation. He long enjoyed royal patronage, and among his close friends were the lawyer&#150;historian John Selden, the leading Greek scholar and bishop of Hereford Augustus Lindsell, and the playwright Ben Jonson (whom Farnaby sued in 1634 for the recovery of a debt of &pound;120). He also corresponded with the Dutch intellectuals Gerardus Johannes Vossius and Daniel Heinsius, both of whom acknowledged their own debts to his learning. An eminent teacher of pupils of all levels of ability, but litigious and a dangerous creditor, Farnaby was acclaimed by Wood as &#145;the chief Grammarian, Rhetorician, Poet, Latinist and Grecian of his time&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.106).<br>
