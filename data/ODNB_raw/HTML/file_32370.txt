<span class="headword">Charles,  Robert Henry</span>  (1855&#150;1931), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and biblical scholar</span>, was born on 6 August 1855 at Cookstown, co. Tyrone, the fifth of seven sons of David Hughes Charles MD JP, of Cookstown, an eminent doctor, and his wife, Annie Elizabeth, second daughter of John Allen. He was educated at a private school near his home, and then at his own request was sent to the Belfast Academy, where he prospered. In 1874 he went to Queen's College, Belfast, to read classics; he won five scholarships, and graduated BA (1877) and MA (1880), both with first-class honours. Following a spiritual crisis during his time at Queen's, Charles went to Trinity College, Dublin, where he read classics and theology and trained for the ministry. After he had completed his studies there, he went to Germany and Switzerland for a holiday with some friends, and met his future wife, Mary, at Heidelberg.<br>
<br>Charles was ordained deacon in 1883 and priested in 1884, and between 1883 and 1889 served three London curacies. He made a conscious decision to make straight for a difficult parish, namely Whitechapel, where he met with some success, but the strain on his health was great and after a brief rest he moved to much less demanding work at Kensington. In 1886 he married Mary Lilias, daughter of William Bence-Jones of Lisselan, co. Cork, whom he had been courting for three years. They had no children of their own, but brought up some nieces and thereby enjoyed a family life. After some time in Kennington, Charles was obliged to abandon his ministry in London for a period of prolonged rest, and he and Mary spent the year 1889&#150;90 in Germany.<br>
<br>Charles returned to work in 1891 and moved to Exeter College, Oxford, where he was extremely happy. It was there that his most significant academic work was done, centring on apocryphal and pseudepigraphic literature of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>. There is a gap of several centuries between the bulk of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> material and that of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. The material on which Charles was expert filled this gap, and therefore provided the immediate background to the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. His work on the pseudepigrapha was controlled by his view of it as an (inadequate) stage <i>en route</i> for the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, and he usually commented on the worth of the texts about which he wrote by looking to see how much influence they had on the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. These ideas of progressive revelation in Israel's history are still current in some biblical scholarship but there are very few scholars who would be so self-conscious in their privileging of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> over other texts. Charles's work throughout his life was achieved despite a constant struggle against illness; towards the end of his life he was able to say that he had not enjoyed three consecutive nights of proper sleep for forty years.<br>
<br>Charles produced a new English translation of <span class="roman">Enoch</span> in 1893, and shortly after (1895) a version of the book of <span class="roman">Jubilees</span>, translated from Ethiopic, which was Charles's area of individual brilliance. Indeed, in H. F. D. Spark's 1984 volume of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> <span class="roman">Apocrypha</span>, the translation of <span class="roman">Jubilees</span> is merely a revision of Charles's 1895 translation. In 1898 Charles was made professor of biblical Greek at Trinity College, Dublin (a post he retained until 1906), and Jowett lecturer, and he published his lectures, &#145;The doctrine of a future life in Israel, in Judaism and Christianity&#146;. For the years 1905&#150;11 Charles was Grinfield lecturer on the <span class="roman">Septuagint</span> (the ancient Greek translation of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>), during which time he produced a text of the Ethiopic <span class="roman">Enoch</span> (1906), a huge work of scholarship, and became a fellow of the British Academy (1906). In 1908 his edition of <span class="italic">The Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs</span> (Greek text) was published. In 1910 he became both a fellow of Merton College, Oxford, and speaker's lecturer in biblical studies at Oxford, which post he held for four years. He became DD of Dublin in 1898, and DLitt of Oxford in 1907.<br>
<br>In 1913 Charles returned to London, where he was appointed canon of Westminster Abbey, where he emptied the pews by delivering scholarly lectures rather than sermons. He learned from this, however, and, though never a demagogue, managed to adapt to his new surroundings. He continued his academic studies and in 1913 he produced the Oxford edition of <span class="italic">The Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha of the Old Testament</span>. In 1914 his <span class="italic">Religious Development between Old and New Testaments</span> came out, and this represents the best summary of his thought on the role of his studies within his faith, to which his own work always remained subservient. In 1919 Charles became archdeacon of Westminster, Warburton lecturer at Lincoln's Inn chapel, and Schweich lecturer at the British Academy. The academy honoured him further when in 1925 he became the first winner of its medal for biblical studies. In 1920 he published on the <span class="roman">Revelation</span> of St John, and in 1929 he produced a commentary on the book of <span class="roman">Daniel</span>. He contributed to the tenth and eleventh editions of <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>, and also published on gambling and on divorce. He listed his recreations as golf and light literature.<br>
<br>In 1929 Charles was involved in a serious road accident, which left him disabled. He died at his home, 4 Little Cloisters, Westminster Abbey, on 30 January 1931, survived by his wife. He left his library to Ripon Hall, Oxford, of which he had been a benefactor. Charles's career was one of outstanding academic brilliance and his achievement was monumental. Despite the discovery of the Dead Sea scrolls in 1947, his contribution is still considered valuable.<br>
