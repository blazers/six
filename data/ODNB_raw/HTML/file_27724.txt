<span class="headword">Trevor,  Arthur  Hill-</span>, third Viscount Dungannon  (1798&#150;1862), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in Berkeley Square, London, on 9 November 1798. He was the only surviving son of Arthur Hill-Trevor, second viscount (1763&#150;1837), and his wife, Charlotte, third daughter of Charles Fitzroy, first Baron Southampton.<br>
<br>Trevor's great-grandfather, <a name="cosubject_55428"></a><span class="headword">Arthur  Hill-Trevor</span>, first Viscount Dungannon  (<em>d.</em> 1771), of Belvoir, co. Down, and Brynkinalt, Denbighshire, was the second son of Michael Hill of Hillsborough, and Anne, the daughter and heir of Sir John Trevor (1637&#150;1717). He inherited the Trevor property from his father's half-brother, Marcus Hill (<i>d</i>. 1751), who was son of William Hill and Mary, daughter of Marcus Trevor, first Viscount Dungannon of the first creation. He was chancellor of the Irish exchequer in 1754&#150;5. On 17 February 1766 he was created Viscount Dungannon and Baron Hill of Olderfleet. He died in Dublin on 30 January 1771, and was buried at Belvoir. His second wife, whom he married in January 1737, was Anne, (1715&#150;1799), daughter and heir of Edmund Francis Stafford of Brownstown, co. Meath. She died on 13 January 1799. Their daughter, Anne, married in February 1759 the earl of Mornington, and was mother of the first duke of Wellington and of Marquess Wellesley. There were two other daughters and a son, Arthur, who was father, with Letitia, eldest daughter of Hervey, first Viscount Mountmorres, of Arthur Hill-Trevor, second Viscount Dungannon; he succeeded his grandfather in the title, and died at Brynkinalt on 14 December 1837.<br>
<br>His son, Arthur Hill-Trevor, was educated at Harrow, and matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, on 17 October 1817, graduating BA in 1820 and MA in 1825. He married, on 10 September 1821, at Leghorn, Sophia, fourth daughter of Colonel Gorges Marcus Irvine of Castle Irvine, co. Fermanagh. She died on 21 March 1880.<br>
<br>In 1830 Hill-Trevor was elected as MP for New Romney, and in the following year for the city of Durham. He was a vigorous opponent of the reform bills of 1831&#150;2, both in the house and outside it. On 30 August 1831 he moved an amendment to the effect that the existing non-resident freemen should keep their votes during their lives. In the course of the year Hill-Trevor issued an anti-reform pamphlet in the guise of a <span class="italic">Letter to the Duke of Rutland</span>. When the bill was reintroduced he again contested it, and published another pamphlet exhorting the peers to stand firm. At the dissolution he lost his seat, but was re-elected at Durham in the election of 1835. He vigorously opposed municipal corporation reform, regarding it as an attempt to extend the parliamentary franchise indirectly, and put himself forward as the defender of the freemen, moving to omit the clause disfranchising them (23 June 1835); he was defeated by a majority of forty-six. In February 1837 he obtained the rejection of the motion of Sir William Molesworth for the repeal of the property qualification for members of parliament. He seconded the motion of Peter Borthwick for the revival of convocation (3 May), and also his proposal for the establishment of a system of national education in connection with the church (2 June). During this parliament he several times introduced a measure for the control of beershops, but met with little support. He forbade any of his tenants to set one up. In the session of 1839 he opposed the <span class="roman">Irish Municipal Corporation Bill</span> as an attempt to put down protestantism. In 1841 he joined Sir Robert Harry Inglis in opposing the further restriction of capital punishment, which he thought should still be inflicted in cases of arson, midnight burglary, and some other offences. While a member of the Commons he always singled out for attack the radical section of his opponents. He was more than once denounced by O'Connell, who on one occasion referred to him ironically as &#145;the meek and modest representative of the clergy of Durham&#146;.<br>
<br>Hill-Trevor, who had succeeded his father as third Viscount Dungannon in 1837, was defeated at the general election of that year and, though elected at a by-election in April 1843 for his former constituency, was immediately afterwards unseated on petition. In September 1855 he was elected a representative peer for Ireland, and henceforth took an active part in the proceedings of the House of Lords. His strongest efforts were directed against legislation dealing with the marriage laws. He himself led the opposition to the <span class="roman">Divorce Bill</span> of 1857, and two years later (22 March 1859) moved the rejection of Lord Wodehouse's <span class="roman">Marriage Law Amendment (Deceased Wife's Sister) Bill</span>. His speech on the latter bill was printed the same year. On 27 May 1862 he led the opposition to Lord Ebury's motion for the abolition of clerical subscription.<br>
<br>Dungannon was a member of several learned societies. He published, besides several pamphlets, <span class="italic">The Life and Times of William III</span> (2 vols., 1835&#150;6), dedicated to Edward Nares, regius professor of modern history at Oxford; the book was written with the assistance of Henry John Todd, archdeacon of Cleveland, and with access to the documents at Stowe, but is of slight historical value. Dungannon died at his London home, 3 Grafton Street, on 11 August 1862 and, having no male children, his titles became extinct.<br>
