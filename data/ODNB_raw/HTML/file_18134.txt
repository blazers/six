<span class="headword">Marshall <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Martin]</span>,  Emma</span>  (1828&#150;1899), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 29 September 1828 at Northrepps Hill House, near Cromer, Norfolk, the youngest of the eight children of Simon Martin (1774&#150;1839) and his wife, Hannah Ransome, a Quaker. Although a partner in Gurney &amp; Co., a Quaker family bank based in Norwich, Simon Martin was not a member of the Society of Friends, in which denomination the Martin children were apparently brought up. During her happy (although rather solitary) childhood, Emma Martin was educated by a governess in the family home in Norwich. She later depicted her early youth in <span class="italic">The Dawn of Life</span> (1867), in which she relived the pain of her father's death when she was ten years old. The family subsequently moved to Thorpe, a village on the outskirts of the city, and Emma Martin was sent to a boarding-school where she received &#145;a sound education of the old-fashioned kind&#146;  (Marshall, 29). A keen musician, she afterwards took organ lessons with Zachariah Buck, the cathedral organist.<br>
<br>About 1849 the Martin household moved to Clifton, near Bristol, where their new friends included John Addington Symonds, a physician, who cultivated Emma's literary, artistic, and musical tastes. She also struck up a correspondence with the American poet Longfellow, which continued until his death. In March 1850 she was baptized into the Church of England by James Marshall (1796&#150;1855): this may have been the prelude to her marriage, on 5 October 1854, to his son Hugh (<i>c</i>.1825&#150;1899), a clerk in the West of England Bank. In 1855, when Marshall was appointed manager of the West of England branch there, the young couple moved to Wells. Seven of their nine children were born in Wells, but Emma Marshall's &#145;almost passionate maternity&#146;  (Marshall, 65&#150;6) did not prevent her from embarking upon a career as a novelist; <span class="italic">Happy Days at Fernbank</span> (1861) was the first of nearly 200 tales. The story of the moral education of two little girls, it drew on Emma Marshall's own experience of everyday family life, as many of her works were to do. From 1868 she reached a wide audience with contributions to the evangelical periodicals edited by the Revd Charles Bullock (1829&#150;1911), such as <span class="italic">Home Words</span> and the <span class="italic">Fireside News</span>.<br>
<br>In 1869 Hugh Marshall got a new post at Exeter and the family moved again. Here Emma Marshall began to visit the penitentiary every week to read to the girls and women there, and with the assistance of Jennetta Temple, sister of the bishop of Exeter, she established lectures for the higher education of women. It was at Temple's house that she met Charles E. Moberly (<i>d</i>. 1893), a master at Rugby School, who later featured as Mr Buchanan, the unusually elderly hero of <span class="italic">Life's Aftermath</span> (1876). In 1874 the Marshalls moved to Gloucester, following Hugh Marshall's appointment to a post there. Emma Marshall continued to arrange lectures for women (lecturers included T. H. Ward and J. A. Symonds) and enjoyed the triennial music festivals. Family finances had been tight for some time, following some unlucky investments, but upon the failure of the West of England Bank in 1878, Hugh Marshall lost his job and was left with large debts. Friends undertook to fund the education of the Marshall children, and the family moved to lodgings in Weston-super-Mare.<br>
<br>Emma Marshall, determined to clear the debts, now wrote at &#145;a white heat&#146;  (Marshall, 151). In 1880 she published the first of her historical romances, <span class="italic">Memories of Troublous Times</span>, in which the civil war reminiscences of the imaginary royalist Dame Alicia Chamberlayne were interspersed with the genuine seventeenth-century autobiography of a Quaker ancestor, Mary Penington. This literary experiment was not well received, and Emma Marshall returned to the publication of domestic tales until her leading publisher, Richard Seeley, suggested a romance based on the life of the seventeenth-century Bristol philanthropist Edward Colston. Published in 1884, this established the pattern for a series of historical novels, such as <span class="italic">Under Salisbury Spire</span> (1890) and <span class="italic">Penshurst Castle</span> (1894). She regarded her historical romances as the most important of her publications, but the amount of time and effort which they demanded was made possible only by a continued output of her domestic tales. These seem to have remained the more popular of her works with her considerable adolescent following: her works were read in translation as far away as Russia, and Tauchnitz was to include thirty of her novels in his <span class="roman">library</span>.<br>
<br>In the early 1880s, after Hugh Marshall found clerical work, the family moved to Bristol. In this area Emma Marshall lived for the rest of her life. Several of her daughters attended Clifton High School for Girls, and Emma Marshall received boarders from the school. A keen promoter of women's education (her daughter Christabel [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57057/', "St John, Christopher Marie")</script>] read history at Somerville College, Oxford), she was also a supporter of women's suffrage: in 1886 she published a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Thoughts on Women's Suffrage</span>, in which she argued persuasively for &#145;the true womanly element&#146; which a female voter could bring to bear on party politics. When the central conference of the National Union of Women Workers was held in Bristol in 1892, she chaired a meeting and attended other sessions. Emma Marshall died on 4 May 1899 at Woodside, Leigh Woods, near Clifton, after an attack of influenza; she was buried in Long Ashton parish churchyard, Somerset, on 9 May. Hugh Marshall died later that year and was buried beside her.<br>
<br>For nearly forty years Emma Marshall was the consistently popular writer of tales for a range of juvenile audiences. The family sagas of C. M. Yonge were her strongest literary influence; like Yonge, she found her forte in depicting the moral education of a child or young adult within a family setting. Written in a straightforward and readable style, with plenty of incident, Marshall's tales lack in-depth psychological analysis of character. Her own liberal and optimistic religious faith prevented her from adopting fully the traditions of evangelical children's literature: bad ends, dramatic conversions, and pious deathbeds are few in Marshall's tales. Despite her ability to adapt to changing literary tastes (passages of moralizing grew fewer in her later works) and her keen eye for a topical theme&#151;such as women's education in <span class="italic">Lady Alice</span> (1878) and the plight of street arabs in <span class="italic">Eastwood Ho!</span> (1890)&#151;Marshall's central educative message remains much the same: self-knowledge and Christian care of others are portrayed as essential for a useful and happy life.<br>
