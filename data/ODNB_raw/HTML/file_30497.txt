<span class="headword">Atthill,  Lombe</span>  (1827&#150;1910), <span class="occ">obstetrician and gynaecologist</span>, born on 3 December 1827 at Ardess, Magheraculmoney, co. Fermanagh, Ireland, was the youngest of ten surviving children of William Atthill (1774&#150;1847) and his wife, Henrietta Margaret Eyre, eldest daughter of George Maunsell, dean of Leighlin. Atthill's elder brother, John Henry Grey Atthill, became chief justice of St Lucia. His father, from a Norfolk family, after graduating in 1795 as second wrangler and Smith's prizeman, became a fellow of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, acted as chaplain (1798&#150;1804) to his relative, John Porter, bishop of Clogher, and was thenceforth beneficed in Ireland.<br>
<br>After attending the grammar school in Maidstone, Kent (1839&#150;41), Atthill returned to Ireland to prepare for Trinity College, Dublin. In June 1844 he was apprenticed to Maurice Colles, a surgeon to the Meath Hospital, Dublin, and in July he entered Trinity. In July 1847, while under twenty, he obtained the licence of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, and in 1849 he graduated BA and MB of Dublin University, and in 1865 MD.<br>
<br>In 1847 Atthill became honorary surgeon to a charitable dispensary in Fleet Street, Dublin, where he gained valuable experience of typhus, smallpox, and other infectious diseases, and during the following winter was assistant demonstrator in the Park Street school of medicine. From 1848 to 1850 he was dispensary doctor of the district of Geashill in King's county.<br>
<br>Atthill married in April 1850 Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1870), daughter of James Dudgeon of Dublin, with whom he had one son and nine daughters. On 1 June 1872 he married Mary, daughter of Robert Christie of Manchester, and widow of John Duffey of Dublin, mother of Sir George Duffey, a president of the King and Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland. In 1850 Atthill settled in Dublin and was made assistant physician to the Rotunda Hospital in 1851. While in the Rotunda Hospital for the usual period of three years he endeavoured, without much success, to build up a private practice. A period of pecuniary struggle followed. In 1860 he was elected a fellow of the King and Queen's College of Physicians, and from that year to 1868 was registrar of the college. In 1868 there was a turn of fortune. He joined the staff of the Adelaide Hospital and was given charge of a ward for the treatment of diseases peculiar to women, the first appointment of the kind in any Dublin hospital. Gynaecology was practically a new specialism, and Atthill, by his teaching and writings, did much for its development. His <span class="italic">Clinical Lectures on Diseases Peculiar to Women</span> (1871) was reprinted in the United States, translated into French and Spanish, and was long regarded as the best textbook in English on the subject. He was one of the first in Ireland successfully to perform the operation of ovariotomy, his first two cases being successful. In November 1875 he was elected master of the Rotunda Hospital, and he gave gynaecology a place almost as important as midwifery. He reorganized the working of that institution by the introduction of Listerian principles, and practically drove puerperal sepsis from the wards. From 1874 to 1876 he was president of the Dublin Obstetrical Society. He was president of the obstetric section of the Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland in 1884&#150;5, and again in 1895&#150;7, and was president of the Academy 1900&#150;03. In 1888 he was elected president of the King and Queen's College of Physicians (the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland after 1890), and from 1889 to 1903 represented the college on the General Medical Council. In 1898 he retired from practice, in which he had finally achieved great success. According to the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span>, &#145;He had a fine business capacity, and was a reliable guide in the disposal of money. His generosity was unostentatious but real&#146;  (<span class="italic">BMJ</span>, 24 Sept 1910, 918). He died suddenly while counting his change on the platform of Strood railway station near Rochester, Kent, on 14 September 1910. He was buried on 17 September at Mount Jerome cemetery, Dublin. His wife survived him. In 1910 he had published in the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span> &#145;Recollections of a long professional life&#146;, afterwards reprinted for private circulation. Posthumously in 1911 there appeared his <span class="italic">Recollections of an Irish Doctor</span>, an interesting reminiscence of Irish life prior to the famine, and a modest description of Atthill's early struggles.<br>
