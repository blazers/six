</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ranjitsinhji Vibhaji</span>, maharaja jam sahib of Navanagar <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Ranjitsinhji or Ranji]</span>  (1872&#150;1933), <span class="occ">ruler in India and cricketer</span>, was born on 10 September 1872 in Sarodar, a village on the Kathiawar peninsula in north-west India, the first son of Jiwansinhji, a farmer, and his second wife. The family was related to ruling houses in the region&#151;including Navanagar, in whose territory Sarodar lay&#151;but had fallen on hard times. Ranjitsinhji was physically frail and suffered from smallpox as a child; his father sought relief in alcohol and tyrannizing those around him. Perhaps because of this, Ranjitsinhji was lodged as a small boy with an uncle, the raja sahib of Dhrangadhara, who gave him the rudiments of his education. Ranjitsinhji was six when he experienced a great, though short-lived, stroke of fortune. It proved the seminal event of his life. He was selected as temporary heir to his distant relative Vibhaji, the jam sahib of Navanagar, as a precaution against the ruler's failure to produce a successor. However, Vibhaji and Ranjitsinhji's father soon fell out and the jam sahib shrank from formally endorsing the adoption. Four years later an heir, Jaswantsinhji, was born and the matter, as far as the ruler was concerned, was at an end.<br>
<br>It was not at an end for Ranjitsinhji's family, who had almost been within a heartbeat of the throne. They sought to discredit the alliance between Vibhaji and Jaswantsinhji's Muslim mother and gathered the support of Hindu fundamentalist relations in nearby states. The seeds of a dispute were sown, a dispute that underpinned much that Ranjitsinhji later did. The need to prove that he would have been a worthy heir found expression in his determination to make himself the prince of cricket; the need to extract reparation for what had been denied him found a less pleasant outlet in his brazen accumulation of debts and relentless pursuit of the Navanagar throne. Fully formed, Ranjitsinhji's personality was complex. A steely resolve was wrapped in clothes of charm. Some who dealt with claimant and ruler thought him ruthless and uncompromising; many who encountered the famous batsman found him enchanting and generous. Pleading poverty to some, he lavished gifts on others. Essentially, he was a solitary man. His childhood was rootless and lonely, his formative years in England scarred with racial injustice, and the facts told in his emotional insecurity. He achieved his broader aims but not happiness, as fear at offending sensibilities prevented him from following Vibhaji into forming a mixed marriage, in his case to a Westerner.<br>
<br>All hopes might have been derailed had Ranjitsinhji not enjoyed a second stroke of fortune. Even after the jam sahib fell foul of his father, Ranjitsinhji was allowed to continue his education along lines set out by the ruler. It was a demanding and friendless routine, but one that benefited him. From the age of six he spent eighteen months living and receiving personal tuition in a Rajkot bungalow before entering the princes' college, Rajkumar College, at Rajkot. He showed sporting and academic promise at the college, run by an Englishman, Chester Macnaghten, on the lines of an English public school, and by the time Ranjitsinhji left in 1888 Macnaghten, who said that &#145;a better or manlier boy has never resided within this college&#146;, had arranged for him to go to Cambridge, supported by an allowance from the Navanagar state.<h2>
<a name="RanjicricketforCambridgeSussexandEngland"></a>Ranji: cricket for Cambridge, Sussex, and England</h2>Ranjitsinhji entered Trinity College in November 1889. Concentrating his energies on sport, he became fascinated by cricket, which he had learned in Rajkot from the age of eleven. He joined the university club but few took his early, faltering steps seriously and for three summers he played mainly for local clubs on Parker's Piece. After hours of practice against some of the best bowlers in the country, and armed with a stroke of his own invention, the leg glance, he scored heavily for town sides in 1892. In the following year he forced his way into the Cambridge eleven, where he proved a valuable team member with his capable batting and outstanding fielding. He became the first Indian to win a cricket blue. Though there is no contemporary evidence supporting the claim that he once scored three centuries in three matches on the same day, his enthusiasm was apparent and he won the hearts of fellow undergraduates. Their interest was heightened by the impression, which he did nothing to scotch, that royal blood coursed his veins (Ranjitsinhji had attached the princely prefix Kumar Shri after reaching England). It was at this time that he gained his lasting nickname, Ranji.<br>
<br>Ranjitsinhji had been expected to return to India after sitting bar examinations but, burdened by debt, left Cambridge in 1894 and chose to stay in England, even though his Navanagar allowance was stopped. He was friendly with some Sussex cricketers and began playing for the county in 1895, despite not having fulfilled the two-year residential qualification. His first appearance, against MCC at Lord's, was such a sensational success&#151;with audacious strokeplay he scored 77 not out and 150&#151;that no one made an issue of the matter. The season was a triumph, as he amassed 1775 runs at an average of 49.31, exceeded by only three players. Ranjitsinhji's sporting rise was now swift, testimony to his mastery of the art of batsmanship. Within five years of first playing seriously, he had become the world's leading batsman and forced a general reappraisal of tactics. In 1896 he scored 2780 runs, then a record for an English season, and his average of 57.91 was the highest of the summer. His ten centuries&#151;two of which, uniquely, came on the same day of the match against Yorkshire at Brighton&#151;equalled the existing record. Controversially, he was chosen for England against Australia in the second test match at Old Trafford after being omitted, no less contentiously, from the first at Lord's. The team was then selected by ground authorities and opinion was divided as to whether he should be regarded as eligible. The brilliance of his batting again silenced debate as he narrowly failed to turn the match in England's favour with innings of 62 and 154 not out.<br>
<br>The following year Ranjitsinhji published a technical treatise, <span class="italic">The Jubilee Book of Cricket</span>, which rapidly went through several editions and survives with its reputation intact. Ranjitsinhji's explanation of the book's production in the <span class="italic">Windsor Magazine</span> (October 1897) suggests later speculation that he was substantially assisted in the project was incorrect. Publicly, Ranjitsinhji built on his reputation steadily over the following years, continuing to set new standards in run-scoring which were unsurpassed until the era of Donald Bradman and Walter Hammond. He never finished outside the top five in the averages between 1895 and 1904, when he stopped playing regular county cricket. He visited Australia with Andrew Stoddart's team in 1897&#150;8 and on an unsuccessful mission was one of the few individual successes, amassing 1157 runs, 457 of them in the five tests. He scored 189 in his first match against South Australia and a heroic 175 in the first test in Sydney (December 1897) while recovering from illness. He did not play in 1898 but in 1899, when he became Sussex captain, became the first player to score 3000 runs in a season and repeated the feat in 1900 (when his average was 87.57), at which stage the three highest aggregates stood to his name. His nearest rival was C. B. Fry, a close friend and Sussex team-mate, with whom he formed one of the most effective and famous sporting partnerships.<br>
<br>Ranjitsinhji's approach to the Englishman's summer game was significantly different from that of his predecessors. He felt no compunction to follow convention or style. Like Arthur Shrewsbury, the Nottinghamshire and England professional, but unlike W. G. Grace, who had set standards that appeared unbeatable, he based his technique on back-foot play, which he felt inherently safest. Other key components were placement, control of the strike, and economy of effort, which more than compensated for his lack of physical robustness (he stood about 5 feet 10 inches). The lateness with which he executed his swift, explosive cuts and glances caused general wonder&#151;batsmen had not scored runs behind the wicket with such facility before&#151;and gave life to the legend of an oriental magician. &#145;No man now living has ever seen finer batting than Ranjitsinhji showed us in this match&#146;, the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> (20 July 1896) reported after his England d&eacute;but. &#145;Grace has nothing to teach him as a batsman; and none of the men of renown of 30 years ago could have exhibited a more thorough mastery of every point in the game&#146;. He became more orthodox later, as opponents countered his original methods.<br>
<br>Ranjitsinhji's achievements were the greater for the fact that he played, for the most part, on the brink of poor health and penury. But the man who put India on the map for many Englishmen knew that sporting success would assist his prospects of successfully contesting the Navanagar throne. He thought his chance had come after the tour of Australia in 1897&#150;8, when he formally applied to the government of India for a review of his case, but after much debate&#151;and questions in the House of Commons&#151;his application was rejected. Four years later the struggle had nearly got the better of him. He only narrowly avoided being declared bankrupt and the strain showed during the 1902 season, when his batting wore a distracted air and he contributed only 19 runs in four test innings against Australia before being dropped. He had played fifteen times for England but never appeared again. With help from friends and relations he bought himself two years' grace but in 1904 was forced to return to India, where he was kept by threats of legal action from an old schoolfriend who had given him &pound;10,000.<h2>
<a name="RulerofNavanagar"></a>Ruler of Navanagar</h2>Then, in August 1906, Ranjitsinhji had his third and greatest stroke of luck&#151;or was it luck?&#151;when Vibhaji's son, who had become the new jam sahib on the death of his father in 1895, died mysteriously and unexpectedly, without an heir. His death was attributed in some quarters to typhoid but there were rumours of foul play. With the assistance of Devisinhji, a half-brother, Ranjitsinhji had long prepared for such an opportunity and after an inordinate six months of deliberations was chosen ahead of other claimants by the government of India as the next jam sahib. As ruler, he took to terming himself Ranjitsinhji Vibhaji; years later, after lobbying, he was permitted by the government to use the term maharaja.<br>
<br>Ill-equipped for his new role and having spent little time in his native land since his youth, Ranjitsinhji found the early years of his reign demanding. As ruler of a small princely state, he was expected to exhibit loyalty towards Britain, and was disposed to do so, but in return wanted licence to live extravagantly. That Navanagar was crippled by drought, poverty, and disease did not deter him and he made full use of an agreement that he could visit Europe every four years. Both in 1908 and 1912 he delighted his cricket admirers by turning out for Sussex and, despite his increased weight by the second occasion, showing glimpses of his old magic, but created intense ill feeling by using diplomatic privilege to renege on debts. His levels of spending led the government of India to attach an administrator, Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Berthon, to his court. The British authorities encouraged Ranjitsinhji to stabilize his regime by marrying and producing an heir, but his talk on this subject came to nothing. Unbeknown to them, he had since 1902 been engaged tacitly, if not formally, to Edith Borissow (1873&#150;1942), one of the daughters of his guardian at Cambridge, and their relationship continued clandestinely and possibly incompletely for long afterwards. It was eventually broken off by her a few years after the death in 1917 of her father, Louis Borissow, a clergyman, whose feelings had been one of the chief reasons for their secrecy. Late in life Ranjitsinhji embarked on another relationship with an Irish woman. In the absence of children, he took under his wing his many nephews and nieces.<br>
<br>When war came in Europe in 1914 Ranjitsinhji put the resources of his state at the empire's disposal. These included a house in Staines, purchased for &pound;30,000 two years earlier, that was converted into a hospital for wounded officers. Ranjitsinhji went to the front but, like other Indian princes, was given frustratingly little to do. It was during one of several spells of leave that, on the last day of August 1915, he lost his right eye in a shooting accident on the Yorkshire moors. He returned to India a few months later and did not revisit Europe until the war ended; he played his last game for Sussex in 1920. His career figures in first-class cricket (1893&#150;1920) were 24,692 runs scored (average 56.37), including seventy-two centuries; as a slow right-arm bowler he took 133 wickets (average 34.59). He was appointed KCSI in 1917, GBE in 1919, and GCSI in 1923.<br>
<br>Under Berthon's stewardship, and with Ranjitsinhji growing into his responsibilities, Navanagar slowly moved towards prosperity. Irrigation schemes were put in place, railways laid, and a rebuilding programme undertaken in the capital, Jamnagar. Most importantly, a port was developed at Bedi, which the British launched by suspending its customs line. Bedi proved so successful at taking trade from the imperial ports of Bombay and Karachi that the line was reinstated, causing a long-running dispute, but Bedi remained highly profitable. Thus were the conditions of his people improved and Ranjitsinhji guaranteed his opulent lifestyle, if one more in tune with occident than orient. At one time or another he owned in India two main palaces in Jamnagar&#151;he invariably lived in the smaller one, Vibha Villas&#151;a summer house and shooting lodge; in Britain he had a house in Staines and a lakeside castle at Ballynahinch, on the west coast of Ireland, ideal for another of his hobbies, fishing. He also possessed a yacht. He delighted in entertaining friends from the tweedy British aristocracy and his preferences were further apparent when he encouraged Duleepsinhji, the best cricketer among his nephews, to play for England rather than help India to form its first national team.<br>
<br>This was not a time to invite resentment among fellow Indians, and as one of the British empire's best-known figures Ranjitsinhji presented an easy target for Congress in its campaign for a democratic and independent country. In 1927 it issued a pamphlet attacking his performance as ruler. Alive to the threats, Ranjitsinhji played an active part in the formation and affairs of the chamber of princes, formed in 1920; he twice represented India at the League of Nations assembly at Geneva, and was a delegate to the earlier sessions of the round-table conference (1930) on the government of India. He also published detailed but unconvincing defences of his record in India and England. One of these was a biography, commissioned shortly before his death, in which he was closely involved. Written by Roland Wild and published in 1934, it told a fanciful account of the route by which he came to his throne. His incomplete adoption and his father's true character were ignored, and his financial misdemeanours suppressed. It was accepted as the definitive biography for more than fifty years.<br>
<br>Ranjitsinhji died of heart failure on 2 April 1933 in Vibha Villas, five days after returning from Delhi. He had suffered from heart and bronchial trouble for several years but his final illness was sudden; preparations for a trip to Britain were advanced. Later in the day, the people of Jamnagar lined the 4 mile route to his funeral pyre; five months later his ashes were scattered on the Ganges near Allahabad. He was succeeded by another nephew, Digvijaysinhji. His bedroom in Vibha Villas is preserved as it was the day he died.<br>
