<span class="headword">Evans,  Richard</span>  (1783?&#150;1871), <span class="occ">portrait painter and copyist</span>, was born in Shrewsbury, Shropshire. He was possibly the Richard Evans who was baptized on 1 August 1783 at St Mary's, Shrewsbury, the son of Robert Evans and his wife, Elizabeth. About 1804 he followed his friend David Cox from Birmingham to London, taking lodgings near him. Evans was poor in those days and Cox, who was more proficient in landscape painting, lent him many of his Indian ink sketches to copy and sell in order to support himself. Eventually he turned to portrait painting and worked as an assistant to Sir Thomas Lawrence making duplicate copies of his master's portraits of members of the royal family. In 1814 Evans visited the Louvre in Paris and was one of the first Englishmen to copy the pictures there collected. He exhibited at the Royal Academy for the first time in 1816 from 26 Southampton Street, London, sending a portrait entitled <span class="italic">Mr Sadler the Aeronaught</span>. In all he exhibited forty-two pictures at the academy and six at the British Institution. From 86 Newman Street, London, he exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1818 a portrait <span class="italic">His Majesty Henry Christophe, King of Haiti</span> (who in 1820 was deposed and committed suicide) and another of his son Prince Victor Henry, prince royal of Haiti (who with others was bayoneted to death).<br>
<br>In 1821 Joseph Farington recorded in his diary that the architect John Nash had &#145;employed an English painter [Evans] to copy the works of Raphael in the Logio at Rome. Evans is now in the city proceeding on the work &hellip; the copies &hellip; are meant to embellish Mr. Nash's Gallery&#146; in Regent Street  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 16.5745). He also copied pictures by old masters and painted portraits. On giving up his studio he gave one of his fresco studies to the attendant who swept his studio. Years afterwards, he was astonished to find this identical work hanging in the South Kensington Museum. It was described as a genuine piece of antique fresco painting depicting <span class="italic">Ganymede Feeding the Eagle</span>, from a tomb in the neighbourhood of Rome. He examined his original sketch of the subject, made a special journey to London, and convinced Mr Redgrave, the director-general for art, that the work was really his and not antique.<br>
<br>From about 1826 Evans was living at 15 Newman Street (remaining there until after 1845), sending to the Royal Academy a portrait, <span class="italic">Admiral Sir Edward Owen KCB</span>, which had been commissioned by the corporation of Shrewsbury (Evans's birthplace). Other portraits of important sitters he exhibited at the Royal Academy include in 1828 the Russian ambassador Count Vorontsov; Alderman Carden in his ninetieth year, painted for the corporation of Worcester in 1834, and Nelson's captain, Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Masterman Hardy. His portrait of Harriet Martineau (National Portrait Gallery, London) exhibited in the same year received such &#145;brutal comment&#146; by a notorious critic of the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> that the critic was dismissed. The National Portrait Gallery also hold his portraits of the radical politician Sir Francis Burdett, the poet Thomas Campbell, his master, Sir Thomas Lawrence, John Nash, and the architect Sir Jeffry Wyatville.<br>
<br>After 1845 Evans seems to have ceased portrait painting. His wife, Margaret Bridger (<i>c</i>.1782&#150;1857), a British subject, was born in America. By 1851 they had moved to Southampton, and were living at Bugle Street. From there he sent two pictures to the British Institution in 1856, <span class="italic">Gipsies by Moonlight</span>, 30 guineas, and <span class="italic">A Monk of Val Ombrosa</span>, 40 guineas. When more than eighty-five years old he executed a large picture, <span class="italic">The Death of Aesculapius</span>, whom he had depicted in two other paintings: one at the Royal Academy in 1830 and another in 1832 at the British Institution.<br>
<br>After being stricken with paralysis for eighteen days Evans died on 9 November 1871 at his home, 5 Bugle Street, Southampton, Hampshire, aged eighty-seven. Other examples of his work are in the British Museum, and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, and Southampton City Art Gallery.<br>
