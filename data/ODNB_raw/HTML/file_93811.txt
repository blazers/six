<span class="headword">Hamilton,  Margaret</span>, Lady Belhaven and Stenton  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1625, <em>d.</em> in or after 1694), <span class="occ">royalist heroine and medical practitioner</span>, was the illegitimate daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12085/', "James Hamilton, second marquess of Hamilton (1589&#150;1625)")</script>. It has been plausibly suggested that her mother was Anne, widow of John Abernethy, eighth Lord Saltoun, and daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26513/', "Walter Stewart, first Lord Blantyre")</script>, but the evidence for this claim is unclear. The marquess spent a good deal of time in London at the court of King James VI and I, but since Margaret seems always to have lived in Scotland the assumption is that she was born there. As was the custom in the seventeenth century, she was acknowledged by her father, who presumably arranged her marriage to his distant relative Sir John Hamilton (<i>d</i>. 1679) of the Biel, Haddingtonshire, descendant of an illegitimate son of James Hamilton, first Lord Hamilton (<i>d</i>. 1479).<br>
<br>During the civil war Sir John was a faithful supporter of Charles I, who on 15 December 1647 created him Lord Belhaven and Stenton. The following year, when Margaret's half-brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12087/', "James Hamilton, first duke of Hamilton")</script>, launched an expedition into England to try to rescue the king, Belhaven participated, lending his kinsman considerable sums of money. After the duke's execution in 1649 Belhaven feared that his creditors would have him arrested but his wife came up with a daring plan to save him. Following her instructions, he announced that he was travelling to England and set off to cross the estuary of the River Solway, notorious for its treacherous tides. Shortly afterwards his distraught servant returned, leading his horse and carrying his hat. Lord Belhaven, it seemed, had been swept away and drowned. The Lyon king of arms recorded death as having taken place on 3 July 1652, and an admonition relating to the administration of his goods was granted on 11 November 1656, the deceased being described as having lived at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Middlesex.<br>
<br>Lady Belhaven mourned her husband's death very publicly, and if neighbours were sometimes surprised when she received occasional visits from a mysterious stranger, no one suspected the truth. It was not until Charles II had been safely restored to the throne that Lord Belhaven miraculously reappeared, explaining that for the past six years he had been working as a gardener in England. Some of his contemporaries criticized him for feigning death, and when his only son, &#145;a verie hopeful youth and prettie scholar&#146;, contracted a fever and died about 1661, the minister Robert Baillie noted grimly, &#145;In this reall death by God's hand, who will not be mocked, the hope of that house perished&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals</span>, 3.436). When Belhaven in fact died, on 17 June 1679, his title passed by prior agreement to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12107/', "John Hamilton (1656&#150;1708)")</script>, son-in-law of one of the Belhavens' three daughters.<br>
<br>The loss of her son was all the more poignant because Lady Belhaven was well known for her skill in medical matters. Ailing relatives would invite themselves to stay with her so that they could enjoy the benefits of her nursing, and she made up her own herbal remedies. In the 1690s she tried very hard to help her great-niece, Margaret Hamilton, countess of Panmure (<i>d</i>. 1731), to avoid miscarriages. She collected helpful recipes from friends and acquaintances like Lady Lauderdale and Lady Ranelagh, sensibly advised against bleeding as a treatment, and told Margaret, &#145;If my infirm old age could permit me to go from my chamber to the place where I make my [astringent] plasters at this season, no other should be employed&#146;  (NA Scot., Dalhousie muniments, GD45/26/131). Lady Belhaven's date of death has not been found but this, her last known letter, was written on 3 January 1694.<br>
