<span class="headword">Dawes,  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1709, <em>d.</em> 1766), <span class="occ">classical scholar and schoolmaster</span>, was baptized on 27 June 1709 at Market Bosworth, Leicestershire, the son of Richard Dawes, a maltster. He was educated at Market Bosworth grammar school, where the classicist Anthony Blackwell became headmaster in 1722. He matriculated from Emmanuel College, Cambridge, as sizar, in 1726 and took his BA, as twelfth wrangler, in 1730; he proceeded MA in 1733. Elected fellow in 1731, he resided in his college and built up a reputation as a formidable scholar. His quick temper and eccentricity also gained him a reputation, which may have cost him the election in 1734 for the office of esquire bedell, when he was defeated by Burrowes, of Trinity College. He spent his free time ringing the bells at Great St Mary's and drinking with his fellow bell-ringers. During his time in Cambridge he published two Greek poems on royal subjects: the first on the death of George I, in 1727, and the second on the marriage of Frederick, prince of Wales, in 1734. In 1736 he issued proposals for a translation of Milton's <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span> into Greek verse, with a specimen from book 1, but never completed the project. <br>
<br>As Dawes was reluctant to take holy orders he faced losing his fellowship. On 10 July 1738 he accepted the post of master at the grammar school in Newcastle upon Tyne; three months later the corporation appointed him master of the neighbouring St Mary's Hospital. The school had not prospered under the previous headmaster, Edmund Lodge, and pupil numbers initially rose on news of Dawes's appointment. It was not long, however, before Dawes's failings as a teacher and his belligerence towards the corporation affected the school. Though a ready flogger he was unable to maintain discipline; the boys rioted in 1740, and the disorder worsened at the time of the Jacobite rising of 1745. He quarrelled with the corporation when they meddled in school affairs and the two parties traded many insults. Dawes published an extraordinary diatribe against the aldermen in the pamphlet <span class="italic">Extracts from a MS Pamphlet Entitled The Tittle-Tattle Mongers</span> (1746), in which he attacked his principal foe, the wealthy physician Adam Askew, and his son Anthony Askew, a former pupil. Dawes tendered his resignation on 22 September 1746, but when offered a pension of &pound;80 p.a. he returned to his duties and did not relinquish his post until June 1749, when there were scarcely any pupils left in the school. He accepted the pension of &pound;80 on condition that he was also paid other fees that he was owed, and retired to Heworth Shore, on the south bank of the Tyne. <br>
<br>Despite the failure of his career as headmaster Dawes made his mark as a Greek scholar by the publication in Cambridge of <span class="italic">Miscellanea critica</span> (1745; new edn, 1781). Although this book contains regrettable, yet characteristic, polemic against Richard Bentley its positive contribution derives from his uncommonly good understanding of the grammar, syntax, and metre of classical Greek, which enabled him to make a number of convincing improvements to the texts of ancient authors. His scholarly labours on this work doubtless had caused him to neglect his school duties. The <span class="italic">Miscellanea critica</span> earned him a place in Charles Burney's pantheon of seven &#145;Magnanimi heroes&#146;, and he was admired by A. E. Housman for his &#145;preternatural alertness and insight in the two fields of metre and grammar&#146;  (FitzPatrick, 207). <br>
<br>Dawes published nothing more in his retirement and contented himself with rowing on the Tyne, brewing ale, and drinking with the local blacksmith. He may have suffered from mental illness in his last years. He died, unmarried, at his house in Heworth Shore on 21 March 1766, aged fifty-seven, and was buried in the churchyard.<br>
