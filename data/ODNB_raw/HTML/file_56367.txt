<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hackenschmidt,  George</span>  (1877&#150;1968), <span class="occ">wrestler and philosopher</span>, was born on 20 July 1877 at Dorpat, Estonia (then part of the Russian empire). Little is known about his parents, other than that his father was a dyer, and despite his Germanic-sounding name, was of Swedish origin. Hackenschmidt trained as an engineer's draughtsman, but excelled in weightlifting, and became Russian champion in 1899. His strength became apparent in 1896, when he reputedly picked up a milkman's horse and carried it around on his shoulders.<br>
<br>However, it was as a wrestler that Hackenschmidt became famous. His first big tournament was in Vienna, in 1898, when he won the amateur heavyweight championship of the world, wrestling in the Graeco-Roman style. He soon established a reputation as one of the strongest and most skilful wrestlers in Europe. In 1900 he turned professional, and until his retirement in 1911, he was never defeated in this style.<br>
<br>In 1902, speaking little English, Hackenschmidt arrived in Britain to advance his career in music-hall wrestling, and met the impresario C. B. Cochran, who became his manager. With Cochran's guidance, he became &#145;the Russian Lion&#146;, and introduced showmanship into his performances, which usually involved allowing local wrestlers to look good for a while before throwing them, or using a paid &#145;villain&#146; before throwing him. As he fought every challenger, he claimed the championship of the world, since there was no international wrestling body to award titles. Within a year he and Cochran had between them created a music-hall boom in wrestling, with wrestlers arriving in Britain from around the world.<br>
<br>Hackenschmidt's most famous match, which elevated him to hero status, was against Ahmad Madrali, &#145;the Terrible Turk&#146;, at Kensington Olympia, London, on 30 January 1904. With Cochran's flair for publicity the match became the sporting event of the year, although the outcome itself was an anticlimax; Madrali was thrown in forty-four seconds, dislocating his arm in the process.<br>
<br>With his popularity at its zenith, Hackenschmidt toured Britain drawing huge houses wherever he went, wrestling five challengers a night, and defeating them all in twenty minutes. He had now adopted the free or catch-as-catch-can style, which the public favoured over the Graeco-Roman style, and was twice defeated by the American wrestler Frank Gotch, in 1908 and September 1911, in Chicago. The latter defeat prompted his retirement.<br>
<br>After retiring from wrestling Hackenschmidt lived for a short time at Lancing, Sussex, and then travelled internationally, giving exhibitions. In 1913 he married a Frenchwoman, Rachel Marie Lucienne (1892/3&#150;1987) and took French citizenship. He was in Berlin at the start of the First World War, when he was interned by the Germans as an enemy subject, and at the end of the war returned to his French home in Nice. Turning to writing and lecturing on physical culture, psychology, and philosophy, he occasionally visited Britain. In 1935 he published <span class="italic">Man and Cosmic Antagonism to Mind and Spirit</span>, the first of several books describing his system of personal philosophy, which he formulated during his wartime internment. His ideas influenced many sportsmen, particularly the Australian athletics coach Percy Cerutty.<br>
<br>In 1945 Hackenschmidt came to Britain from France, and was living at Adelaide Road, Hampstead, when he won a libel action in October 1950. In July 1950 he became a naturalized British subject and in 1951 he settled at 21 Chestnut Road, West Norwood, where he lived until his death. He successfully ran a physical culture school. He abstained from both alcohol and tobacco, and after his retirement became a strict vegetarian. He died in St Francis Hospital, East Dulwich, London, on 19 February 1968, following a short illness, at the age of ninety. He was cremated at Norwood cemetery, where his ashes were scattered. His papers, given by his widow, form part of the Todd-McLean library at the H. J. Lutcher Stark Center, University of Texas at Austin.<br>
