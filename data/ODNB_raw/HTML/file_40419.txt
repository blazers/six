<span class="headword">Wright,  Phoebe</span>  (1710s?&#150;1778), <span class="occ">embroiderer and designer</span>, may have been, according to evidence from her will, the sister of Benjamin Holmes, hosier and glover of Bishopsgate Street Without in Spitalfields, London, and of Joseph Holmes, silk and gauze weaver of Milk Street, off Cheapside, who was married at Christ Church, Spitalfields, in 1742. The will, made after Phoebe separated from her husband, about whom nothing is known apart from his surname, Wright, is undated but it must have been made before the birth of her niece Nancy Wilton in 1752 as she is not mentioned in it. That Phoebe Wright was already a woman of substance at the time is evident from her reference to her mahogany chairs and dining table and a steel grate, all of which, plus the bed she used herself, she left to her brother Benjamin. That her maiden name was Holmes is further suggested by the bequest of &#145;my best drawing table&#146; to her niece, and presumably namesake, Phoebe Holmes.<br>
<br>In the <span class="italic">Universal Dictionary of Trade and Commerce</span> by Malachy Postlethwayt, first published in London in 1751, Phoebe Wright is mentioned, among a number of English designers of woven silks who came to the fore about 1744, as having &#145;eminently distinguished herself by the correctness and elegancy of her drawing and her colouring&#146;  (Postlethwayt, 1.736). No designs on paper by her are known, but at Wardour Castle, Wiltshire, is preserved a set of church vestments embroidered in Rome in 1777 for the eighth Baron Arundell of Wardour after designs by her. That on the chasuble incorporates trailing stems with flower sprigs very close to those on contemporary silks. Phoebe Wright was also a professional embroiderer. The earliest reference to her, in a letter of 29 November 1742 from Mary Pendarves, later Delany, to her sister, states that the finest clothes at court on the birthday of the prince of Wales were &#145;Lady Caroline Lenox's, gold and colours on white, embroidered by Mrs Wright&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography &hellip; Mrs Delany</span>, 3.250). It was most unusual for the two skills to be combined in a single person, professional embroiderers generally having to rely on professional artists or pattern drawers for their designs.<br>
<br>Phoebe Wright lived on Great Newport Street in Soho, still quite a fashionable district in her day as well as being the home of various artists and engravers, including Sir Joshua Reynolds (1725&#150;1793), a neighbour on Great Newport Street from 1753 to 1760. While Phoebe Wright would doubtless have trained apprentices in the usual way of an embroiderer she was singled out for royal patronage by Queen Charlotte, who, probably from the late 1760s onwards, made her a yearly grant of &pound;500 to enable her to run a school for training indigent girls of good family in embroidery. Six pupils aged fifteen were admitted at any one time and their training appears to have lasted for two to three years.<br>
<br>In 1770 Phoebe Wright exhibited &#145;A specimen of needlework now executing for her Majesty&#146; at the Royal Incorporated Society of Artists of Great Britain. This was part of the largest project undertaken by the embroidery school in her day, namely the hangings for a state bed at Windsor Castle and matching covers for two armchairs and eight stools. This embroidery, which is still extant though now at Hampton Court and applied to a new ground, is described in <span class="italic">The Windsor Guide</span> of 1783 as featuring &#145;a variety of the most curious flowers, the colours of which are beautiful, and disposed with the greatest accuracy and judgement&#146;  (p. 14). The design was by Phoebe Wright herself, while the embroidery was in coloured silks with a little chenille, in accordance with the fashion of the day. She lived to see the completion of the bed but not its installation at Windsor, as she died suddenly at Great Newport Street in November 1778; she was buried at St Anne's, Soho. Her school was taken over by her niece Nancy, whom she had also trained and who had married Joseph Pawsey in 1774, but from the time of her death onwards, while it continued to execute many royal commissions, it had to rely for its designs on the flower painter Mary Moser. It remained in existence, though no longer in London, until Queen Charlotte died, and eventually it came to be associated solely with Nancy Pawsey, Phoebe Wright's name having been forgotten.<br>
<br>As a gifted and independent woman Phoebe Wright was on dining-out terms with such contemporaries as the bluestocking Elizabeth Montagu and Thomas Bentley, the business partner of Josiah Wedgwood. Her designs and embroideries, which seem to have included some of the embroidered pictures popular in her day, were treasured after her death by admirers such as Margaret Cavendish Bentinck, duchess of Portland, and Jemima, Marchioness Grey, who wrote on 23 November 1778: &#145;She is a great loss indeed to an Art which she has brought to an amazing degree of Perfection and with a sense of taste unknown before&#146;  (Phillips, 93).<br>
