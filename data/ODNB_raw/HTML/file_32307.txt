<span class="headword">Carrington, Sir  Frederick</span>  (1844&#150;1913), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Cheltenham on 23 August 1844, the second son of Edmund Carrington JP, and his wife, Louisa Sarah Henney. After education at Cheltenham College, he entered the 24th foot (South Wales Borderers) in 1864. He quickly made himself expert in musketry, and became instructor to his regiment in 1870; in 1875 a rebellion in Griqualand West, northern Cape Colony, collapsed before a small force commanded by Lieutenant Carrington, who had been selected for the duty on the strength of this special qualification. For the Transkei War (1877&#150;8) he raised and commanded the frontier light horse, which he led with great success.<br>
<br>Early in 1878 Carrington was promoted captain, and in the same year commanded the Transvaal volunteer force against Sekukuni in the Transvaal. For his services he was gazetted brevet major, and later (1880) given a step in brevet rank and the CMG. He commanded the African levies against the Zulu. In the Basuto War, while in command of the colonial forces, he was surrounded at Mafeteng for nearly a month (September&#150;October 1880) by 5000 Sotho. Though rations were so reduced that horse-flesh had to be eaten, he and his little force held out until relieved by Brigadier-General Charles Mansfield Clarke.<br>
<br>Carrington was promoted colonel in 1884, and in the following year accompanied Sir Charles Warren's expedition to Bechuanaland in command of the 2nd mounted infantry, known as Carrington's Horse. Subsequently he raised and commanded the Bechuanaland border police (1885&#150;93). He was created KCMG in 1887, and, in the Matabele (Ndebele) campaign of 1893 was military adviser to the high commissioner.<br>
<br>In 1895, on promotion to major-general, Carrington took command of the infantry at Gibraltar, then was again sent to southern Africa, where he played an important part in quelling the Matabele uprising (1896), for which he was created KCB (1897). On the outbreak of the South African War his unique experience of irregular warfare in southern Africa made his appointment to a high command natural; with the temporary rank of lieutenant-general, he was selected to organize and lead an expedition which, starting from the east coast and marching through Rhodesia, entered the Transvaal soon after Roberts had captured Pretoria (5 June 1900).<br>
<br>In 1904 Carrington retired from the army, and pursued his favourite recreations&#151;hunting, shooting, and fishing. He had married in 1897 Susan Margaret (1870/71&#150;1921), only daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33019/', "Henry John Elwes")</script> of Colesborne, Cheltenham, with whom he had two daughters, the younger of whom was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76636/', "Dorothy Violet Carrington (1910&#150;2002)")</script>, historian and writer on Corsica. He died of pneumonia at Colesborne Park, Cheltenham, on 22 March 1913, and was buried at Cheltenham cemetery.<br>
