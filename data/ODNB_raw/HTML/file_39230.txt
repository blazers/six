<span class="headword">Ecgwine</span> <span class="st"> [St Ecgwine]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 717?), <span class="occ">bishop of Worcester</span>, is a figure of whom almost nothing is known. He is not mentioned by Bede or in the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span>. The early twelfth-century historian John of Worcester recorded that Ecgwine succeeded Oftfor as the third bishop of Worcester in 692; that a few years later he began to construct the monastery known as Evesham; and that he died on 30 December 717. The sources of John's information are unknown, and even the bare facts which he records are not beyond suspicion (it is uncertain, for example, that Oftfor died in 692; he may have died some years later, perhaps between 693 and 699). Ecgwine's name is recorded in the witness lists of seven charters issued between 692 and 717 (but not outside these dates), and he is named as beneficiary, on Evesham's behalf, of three others. Although none of these charters is authentic in its present form (and several are manifest forgeries), some seem to have an authentic basis, and may be considered broadly trustworthy. Depending on how much reliance one wishes to place on these various charters (and omitting the manifestly spurious ones), they reveal Ecgwine as an active promoter of Evesham's interests, building up a substantial endowment from royal and lay patronage, including estates at Ombersley, Stratford upon Avon, Abbots Morton, Oldberrow, and Droitwich. Ecgwine's last datable act as bishop was his appearance at the council of &#145;Clofesho&#146; in July 716.<br>
<br>It was approximately three centuries later that the first life of Ecgwine was composed (<i>c</i>.1016) by Byrhtferth, a monk of Ramsey who may at the time have been resident at Evesham. By the early eleventh century all memory of Ecgwine had passed away, and there was very little documentary record of his bishopric. In order to compose his <span class="italic">Vita sancti Ecgwini</span> Byrhtferth was obliged to resort to hagiographical fiction. The life is set out in four parts, corresponding to the four ages of man, and Ecgwine is described proceeding through the seven ecclesiastical grades and then being appointed bishop of Worcester in the days of King &AElig;thelred of the Mercians (675&#150;704). As a result of his stern preaching to the people of his diocese (Byrhtferth puts the text of Bede's <span class="italic">De die judicii</span> into Ecgwine's mouth), Ecgwine was forced by the people to leave his see and go to Rome. Before setting off, he shackled himself and threw the key to his shackles into the River Avon; when he reached Rome, one of his companions caught a fish in the Tiber which miraculously was found to contain the key to the shackles (Byrhtferth has here adapted an international folk-tale widely attested in western literature from Herodotus onwards). When he returned home, Ecgwine founded the monastery of Evesham on a site revealed to him in a vision; he subsequently went to Rome with kings Offa of the East Saxons and Coenred of the Mercians (whose trip is described by Bede, though Ecgwine is nowhere mentioned) in order to secure a papal privilege for his foundation. On his return, the privilege was endorsed at a synod (otherwise unrecorded) at Alcester under the presidency of Archbishop Berhtwald (<i>d</i>. 731). Byrhtferth takes the opportunity here to list some of the estates in Evesham's endowment, including Stratford and Twyford; his source for this information was apparently charters preserved at Evesham, spurious or otherwise. The life closes with various miracles which took place at tenth-century Evesham through the divine agency of St Ecgwine.<br>
<br>Byrhtferth's account of Ecgwine's life is largely fiction, but it served as the basis for all subsequent hagiography, including a life by Dominic of Evesham written <i>c</i>.1100, an anonymous recension of Dominic's life compiled in the early twelfth century and known as the Digby-Gotha recension, and a further recension of Dominic's text by Thomas of Marlborough (<i>d</i>. 1236) in the early thirteenth century. A Middle English verse life of St Ecgwine is included in the popular south English legendary, produced at Worcester between 1270 and 1285. These various works supply no further information about the historical Ecgwine, but give some indication of the extent to which his cult had grown, particularly at Evesham and in its environs. From the eleventh century onwards, St Ecgwine's deposition is recorded in liturgical calendars (particularly from Evesham and Worcester) against 30 December, and his name is frequently invoked in litanies of the saints.<br>
