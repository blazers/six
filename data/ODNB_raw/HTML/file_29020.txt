<span class="headword">Wells,  William Charles</span>  (1757&#150;1817), <span class="occ">physician</span>, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65051/', "Robert Wells (1727/8&#150;1794)")</script>, and Mary Wells, who had emigrated from Scotland, was born in Charles Town, South Carolina, on 24 May 1757. The author <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45790/', "Helena Wells (1761?&#150;1824)")</script> was his sister. His father, who had settled in Carolina in 1753, was a printer and bookseller. A fervent loyalist, he made his son wear a tartan coat and blue bonnet, so that he might be known to be a Scot at heart and not an American. Wells was sent to school at Dumfries in 1768, and then went to the University of Edinburgh in 1770, but in 1771 returned to Carolina, and was apprenticed to Alexander Garden, a physician and botanist in Charles Town, with whom he remained until the American War of Independence broke out in 1775. Wells then returned to Britain and began regular medical studies at Edinburgh, where he lived until 1778. He attended William Hunter's lectures on anatomy and midwifery in London, and became a student of St Bartholomew's Hospital. He went to the Netherlands in 1779 as surgeon to a Scottish regiment in the Dutch service, but resigned, owing to a disagreement with the colonel. He studied medicine at Leiden in 1780 for three months, and prepared a thesis, &#145;De frigore&#146;, before graduating MD at Edinburgh on 24 July 1780.<br>
<br>Wells returned to Carolina in 1781 to look after his father's property, and went from there in December 1782 to St Augustine, East Florida, where he put together a press, which he had brought in pieces, and published a weekly newspaper. He was also a volunteer captain, and acted, from his recollection of Garrick's performance of the role, the part of Lusignan in <span class="italic">Zara</span>.<br>
<br>Wells returned to England in May 1784, and, after three months in Paris in 1785, borrowed money to set up a practice in London. He passed several years without receiving a fee, and at the end of ten years had an income of &pound;250. He was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians in 1788, was elected physician to the Finsbury Dispensary in 1789, and held office until 11 December 1799. In 1795 he was elected assistant physician to St Thomas's Hospital and in 1800 physician, an office which he held until his death. Wells published in 1792 <span class="italic">An Essay upon Single Vision with Two Eyes</span>, and in November 1793 he was elected FRS, becoming a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1814.<br>
<br>Wells published widely, including <span class="italic">An Essay on Dew</span> in 1814, for which he received the Rumford medal of the Royal Society, and in 1818, an <span class="italic">Account of a Female of the White Race of Mankind, Part of whose Skin Resembles that of a Negro</span>, in which he has been thought to anticipate Darwin.<br>
<br>The largest annual income Wells received was &pound;764. He never had a bank account and left about &pound;600, including his books, furniture, and gold medal. Wells's struggle to build a practice meant that he lived very frugally, but he managed to maintain a keen interest in his research. Astley Cooper considered him to be &#145;ingenious but irritable&#146;  (Cooper, 307). Wells had a difference with the College of Physicians, the grounds of which he explained in a published letter to Lord Kenyon, and never became a fellow. However, Matthew Baillie, David Pitcairn, and William Lister, all fellows of the college, were his friends, and they helped him as much as was possible in practice.<br>
<br>Wells died of hydrothorax on 18 September 1817 in London, at his lodgings in Serjeants' Inn, Chancery Lane, and was buried in St Bride's, Fleet Street, where a tablet was erected to his memory. He was unmarried. During his final illness he dictated to his friend Samuel Patrick an autobiography, which was published with his chief works in 1818.<br>
