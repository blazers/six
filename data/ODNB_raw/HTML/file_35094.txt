<span class="headword">Moran,  Patrick Francis</span>  (1830&#150;1911), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic archbishop of Sydney</span>, was born on 16 September 1830 at Leighlinbridge, co. Carlow, Ireland, youngest of the five children of Patrick Moran (<i>d</i>. 1841/2), businessman, and his wife, Alicia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cullen (<i>d</i>. 1831/2); for both parents it was their second marriage. His mother died when he was a year old, his father when he was eleven; his mother's Cullen relatives took care of him until in 1842, aged twelve, he was sent to Rome in the charge of his mother's half-brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6872/', "Paul Cullen")</script>, then rector of the Irish College. Cullen was to be the decisive and continuing influence on the direction and style of his nephew's life: &#145;more than a father to me&#146;, said Moran. As a student in Rome, Moran gave immediate evidence of extraordinary capacity and diligence, initially in languages: by his early twenties he had mastered eight. His theological studies led to a doctorate from the Urban College of Propaganda Fide in 1852: the future Pope Leo XIII was among the examiners who acclaimed the brilliance of his work.<br>
<br>Ordained priest at the age of twenty-three on 19 March 1853, Moran's position at the Irish College, of which he was made vice-rector in 1856, placed him at the hub of an Irish missionary world with a Roman bureaucratic centre. His experience there brought him close familiarity with Vatican officials and their procedures which he used on behalf of Irish interests worldwide. Moreover, his involvement in furthering Irish overseas missions fostered a personal disposition in favour of the missionary vocation.<br>
<br>In Rome in 1857 Moran embarked on an academic career as professor of Hebrew in Propaganda College, where he also taught scripture; here too began his lifelong study of the early history of the Irish church. This issued in a procession of major publications which won him an international reputation in that area. His period of greatest productivity was between 1862, when he published his <span class="italic">Historical sketch of the persecutions suffered by the Catholics of Ireland under the rule of Cromwell and the puritans</span>, and 1884, when the third volume of his collection of Irish ecclesiastical documents, <span class="italic">Spicilegium Ossoriense</span>, was published. This work betokens prodigious industry and erudition and may be properly deemed scholarly, indeed pioneering, in the context of its time. But its bias was antiquarian and its general purpose that of disputing the protestant dominance then exercised over Irish history by Trinity College, Dublin. Moran made no attempt to disguise his Catholic purposes, which at times degenerated into polemic. Much later, his sole Australasian book, the enormous <span class="italic">History of the Catholic Church in Australasia</span> (1895), represented his achievement at its worst. It was a vast compilation of more than a thousand pages, an undigested assemblage of borrowed materials presented in a spirit of triumphalist edification. Yet despite their shortcomings and apologetic bias, Moran's histories and his embracing of scholarly and cultural pursuits in general played an important role in conditioning his church towards valuing such matters, a function of particular importance in the young Australian society.<br>
<br>In 1866 Moran went to Ireland as Cardinal Cullen's secretary. Since 1850 Cullen had enjoyed supreme influence over the Irish church, asserting the power of Roman-oriented religion over organization, discipline, education, public affairs, politics, and nationalism. Moran implemented Cullen's policies, first as Cullen's secretary in Ireland and then with appropriate adaptations in Australia, though not before mirroring them in Ireland itself. In 1872 he was appointed bishop of Ossory, a diocese centred on Kilkenny. From 1869 that diocese had been the centre of a celebrated and spectacular challenge to episcopal authority by Father Robert O'Keefe, which was expressed in his (unsuccessful) libel case against Cullen and Moran and which ended in 1875. Dealing with the case and the subsequent disturbance, and coping with the &#145;land war&#146;, a rural agitation to which Moran was initially opposed, absorbed much of his energies. Conversion to a nationalist viewpoint came too late to redeem a reputation as weak on Irish causes which was to cling to him for the rest of his life. In part it was merited, in that he remained a cautious constitutionalist, with a snobbish contempt for the underclass and its causes. Nor did his personality and demeanour attract confidence. Tall, shy, seeming to his fellow bishops colourless and of small ability, a pale shadow of his respected if disliked patron, Cullen, Moran appeared a virtual caricature of the typical Roman churchman. His popular reputation in the 1880s was that of an ecclesiastical autocrat servile to Rome, reactionary and pro-English in politics.<br>
<br>Moran's appointment as archbishop of Sydney in 1884 seemed appropriate in Ireland, where Australian affairs were regarded as of very minor importance: a dull man for a distant, inconsequential job. But Australian Catholics welcomed Moran with enthusiasm, as triumphal affirmation of their Irishness: he represented victory for those who had opposed the ecclesiastical governance of the English Benedictines under archbishops Polding, between 1835 and 1877, and Vaughan, between 1877 and 1883. Nor was Moran to disappoint them. He blended Irishness with his Australian environment. His first public words were, &#145;Becoming today an Australian among Australians&#146;. At fifty-four Moran showed remarkable adaptability, determined to provide his church with integrationist leadership, its Irishness and Catholicity fitting harmoniously into national life; his ideal was a great national society enriched by religion. Within, his church would be marked by clerical control and lay pursuit of respectability. In all this he took a personal lead, supporting the movement for the federation of the Australian colonies, to the extent of standing, in 1897, in the public election of delegates to the Australian constitutional convention: he was defeated but polled significantly. From the maritime strike of 1890 he showed himself sympathetic to trade unionism, and by 1901 his support for the Labor Party was evident and increasing. He minimized the importance of that party's socialism, accepted it as the party natural to his working-class flock, and saw it as the only party above religious prejudice.<br>
<br>Moran's policy of community integration and harmony nevertheless conflicted with his determination to enhance the public status of Catholics and his capacity to rouse strong sectarian opposition. His frequent visits to Rome and his ambitious and energetic building programme, begun on his arrival and seen at its most grandiose in the seminary of St Patrick's College, Manly, opened in 1889, were inescapable witnesses to a Catholicism on the march&#151;the cause of either delight or dismay. Similarly divisive was Moran's elevation to the cardinalate on 27 July 1885. Alarmed protestant elements saw Catholicism as advancing in power and prestige in Australia. Nor was Moran, despite his calls for harmony, above provocative and sectarian point-scoring. Conflict came to a spectacular head in the citing of Moran's secretary, Mgr D. O'Haran, as co-respondent in the Coningham divorce case of 1900&#150;01. O'Haran was acquitted but Moran's plans to make him coadjutor were frustrated. However, the major contradictions to Moran's integrationist ambitions were long-term. The greatest was the continued&#151;and prodigious&#151;building of a Catholic education system: 102 schools in 1884 and 306 in 1911, with a tripling in numbers in religious teaching orders. Moran envisaged this system as an adjunct to that of the state, the religious instruction only being Catholic, and thus as simply waiting for financing by a reasonable state. Such recognition was not forthcoming, and his passive policy generated Catholic impatience. Catholic protest was silenced by those characteristics of Moran's that also alienated protestants&#151;his triumphalist style, air of rectitude, and autocratic personal bearing.<br>
<br>Moran ruled not only the Sydney but the Australian church, through force of personality and various centralizing initiatives. He constantly made his presence felt, visiting other centres and colonies. There were plenary councils of bishops, in 1885, 1895, and 1905, aimed at standardizing the governance of the Australasian church under Moran's reign. Major Catholic cultural initiatives, involving clergy and laity, were designed to affirm Catholic elements within national life&#151;the Australian Catholic conferences of 1900, 1904, and 1911. Moran's ideas and presence were central and decisive in all this activity and he also made himself available to the press on the public issues of the day: he swiftly became a well-known public person. Behind the scenes he was the key figure in the appointment of bishops and other important church personnel save in the case of a coadjutor. Unable to have O'Haran, Moran was saddled with Michael Kelly (consecrated in August 1901), for whom he had virtual contempt.<br>
<br>Moran exercised power despotically, being a harsh master with an eye to unity achieved through prayer, discipline, and order, and working through emphasis on complete deference to the clergy and the organization of pious sodalities. A prayerful man, he was also tirelessly efficient in the administration which made his dominance possible. Yet despite his remarkable achievements in building&#151;in both fabric and stature&#151;he invites criticism as a mindless pragmatist, devoted to the short-term and obvious problems of his day. He seems to have been oblivious to deeper trends towards unbelief, and blind to fundamental neglects of the life of the mind. His greatness lay in attention to the immediate and to the outward show. His legacy was that style whose essentials&#151;conformity as against confrontation&#151;have underlain the major debates which have troubled Australian Catholism ever since.<br>
<br>Resting at his palace at Manly after a trip to Perth in Western Australia, Moran was found dead in his room on 16 August 1911. After an enormous public funeral he was buried in the crypt of St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney.<br>
