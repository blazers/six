<span class="headword">Napier,  Montague Stanley</span>  (1870&#150;1931), <span class="occ">motor car and aero-engine manufacturer</span>, was born on 14 April 1870 at 68 York Road, Lambeth, London, the youngest of the four sons of James Murdoch Napier, mechanical engineer, and his wife, Fanny Jemima, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mackenzie. His Scottish grandfather moved from Scotland and had founded a business in York Road, Lambeth, by 1836, specializing in making printing machinery for the newspaper industry. Under James Murdoch Napier the firm made coin-weighing machines for the Royal Mint, but by his death in 1895 the business of D. Napier &amp; Son was in decline. Nothing is known about Napier's education, but although he started working for his father at an early age, he was not doing so at the time of his father's death. He bought the family business from the executors and expanded into making machine tools for the cycle industry.<br>
<br>Napier turned to making motor cars in 1899, after Selwyn Edge, like Napier a keen racing cyclist and former member of the Bath Road Club, asked him to modify the Panhard et Levassor car which he had bought after it came second in the 1896 Paris&#150;Marseilles race. Edge was so impressed with the new two-cylinder engine that Napier designed that he contracted to buy six cars from him, setting up the Motor Vehicle Company, with a showroom in Regent Street, to sell them. The first cars, ready in 1900, were so successful that Napier moved his works to larger premises in Acton in 1903, and in 1904 produced the first commercially successful six-cylinder car. While Napier concentrated on the technical side, Edge was attracting publicity for Napier cars with spectacular successes in races and competitions, winning the Gordon Bennett international trophy in 1902. Thanks to the marketing skills of Edge, Napier cars dominated the luxury car trade in Britain until challenged by Rolls-Royce Ltd after 1906.<br>
<br>Unlike Rolls and Royce, who formed a single company to make and market Rolls-Royce cars, Napier and Edge converted their private firms into public companies, D. Napier &amp; Son Ltd in 1906, followed by S. F. Edge (1907) Ltd in 1907, and Edge's company agreed to buy &pound;120,000 worth of Napier cars every year until 1921. In 1912, Napier and Edge parted company, and S. F. Edge Ltd was wound up. Napier's health began to break down in 1915, and following an operation for the removal of a kidney he moved permanently to Cannes, in the south of France, in 1917. He set up a design office there, however, remaining managing director of the firm, and, from 1924, joint managing director. He realized that his firm could not compete with the large manufacturers of mass-produced cheap cars, and although he designed one new car, which came on the market in 1920, there was little demand, and the last Napier car was sold in 1924.<br>
<br>Napier began to make aeroplane engines in response to the Air Ministry's need at the beginning of the First World War, and he started work on his own water-cooled engine in 1916. This engine, the 450 hp Lion, was in use by the end of the war, and in 1918 the government placed an order worth &pound;2.5 million. The Lion became the most widely used British engine, with a larger share of the aircraft business than its rivals Rolls-Royce, Armstrong Siddeley, and Bristol, and it built up a reputation for reliability over long distances. By 1926 Imperial Airways had flown over 2 million miles with the engines, and in 1926 a Lion-powered flying boat made the first non-stop flight across the south Atlantic, from Spain to Argentina. As early as 1919 Napier realized the need to have a new design ready to replace the Lion, and began work on the 1000 hp Cub, which was eventually rejected by the government, in 1925. But throughout the 1920s the Lion continued to be successful: in 1927 Napier employed 1600 men, making fifty engines a month. After the failure of the Cub, he worked on a 250 hp engine, but the Air Ministry and Imperial Airways were more interested in the new large radial engines being developed by his rivals. By the end of 1929 Napier was producing only twelve engines a month. An attempt to take over Bentley in 1931 was thwarted by Rolls-Royce, but D. Napier &amp; Son survived until 1942, when it was taken over by the English Electric Company. Napier's great successes had been the pre-war six-cylinder luxury cars, and the Lion aeroplane engine, but in both instances he was overtaken by Rolls-Royce.<br>
<br>Napier was a tall, bearded, quiet man, &#145;with a face not unlike an apostle&#146;  (Edge, 263), with none of the flamboyance of racing drivers such as Edge. He was not a keen motorist himself, and never drove a racing car. In 1903 he married Alice Caroline Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Paterson, a school governess. They had two sons and two daughters. Napier and his wife were legally separated in 1922. He died at his home, Villa des Cistes, Cannes, France, on 22 January 1931, leaving over &pound;1 million. The chief beneficiary of the will was Norah Mary Fryer (wife of Dr Edwin Fryer), with whom he had lived since 1915.<br>
