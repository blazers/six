<span class="headword">Jocelyn,  Robert</span>, third earl of Roden  (1788&#150;1870), <span class="occ">politician and religious leader</span>, was born at Brockley Park, Queen's county, Ireland, on 27 October 1788, the eldest son of Robert Jocelyn, second earl of Roden (<i>d</i>. 1820), and his wife, Frances Theodosia, eldest daughter of Robert Bligh, dean of Elphin. He was educated at Harrow School between 1801 and 1805. In 1806 he was returned as MP for co. Louth. He was still a minor, however, and in the event the seat was taken over by his uncle until 1810, at which date Viscount Jocelyn, as he was styled during his father's lifetime, took the seat in the Commons and served there until his father's death in 1820 elevated him to the peerage as third earl of Roden. He showed strong tory views, and regularly voted against Roman Catholic relief.<br>
<br>Jocelyn married on 9 January 1813 Maria Frances Catherine Stapleton (1794&#150;1861), second daughter of Thomas Stapleton, Lord le Despencer; they were to have three sons and three daughters. Both he and his wife became staunch adherents of the evangelical movement in the Church of Ireland, and their home at Tollymore Park, co. Down, was run on strongly spiritual lines, with the earl himself regularly leading services in his private chapel and teaching in Sunday schools on his estates. Tollymore became something of a haven for Roden's co-religionists, while its owner took a prominent role in the network of societies which promoted the &#145;second Reformation&#146; in Ireland. He saw his devotional and religious life as the mainspring of his political endeavours. His faith was also reflected in his conscientiousness as a landlord, which inspired affection among his Roman Catholic as well as his protestant tenants. He was a vigorous critic of absentee Irish proprietors.<br>
<br>In the meantime Roden held several appointments in the royal household, as treasurer in 1812, vice-chamberlain from 1812 to 1821, and a lord of the bedchamber from 1828 to 1831. Despite his piety, he got on well with George IV, who at his coronation in 1821 created him Baron Clanbrassill in the peerage of the United Kingdom, thereby giving him an automatic seat in the House of Lords. Roden was auditor-general of the exchequer in Ireland from 1820 to 1822, when the office was abolished, leaving him with a handsome pension for life. He was <i>custos rotulorum</i> for co. Louth from 1820 to 1849, and a member of both the English and Irish privy councils.<br>
<br>In the Lords, Roden became a leader of the Irish tory peers, a position which was confirmed by his election in 1831 as president of the Irish Protestant Conservative Society. During the 1830s he played a central role in mobilizing protestant opinion on both sides of the Irish Sea to defend the Church of Ireland, notably through great public meetings in 1834 and 1837, and was instrumental in the Conservative leadership's maintenance of a robustly anti-Catholic stance. In 1834 Peel offered him the post of lord steward of the household, but he turned it down in order to preserve his independence of action.<br>
<br>After their accession to power in 1841 Peel and Wellington found it less necessary to cultivate the Irish protestant lobby, and Roden's influence waned. In 1849 he was accused of partiality in dealing with an Orange procession at Dolly's Brae in co. Down, which led to an affray with Roman Catholics and consequent fatalities. Roden firmly defended the integrity of his conduct, but the whig government nevertheless dismissed him from the commission of the peace. Despite this indignity, Roden's commitment to the protestant cause remained intense. He took a strong interest in the conditions of protestants on the continent, having visited Piedmont in 1844. He led a delegation to Florence in 1852 to urge the release of Francesco and Rosa Madiai, imprisoned by the Tuscan government for holding a protestant religious meeting in their home. In Ireland he was grand master of the Orange order, and was a steadfast opponent of the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland.<br>
<br>Lady Roden died in 1861, and on 16 August 1862 Roden married Clementine Janet (<i>d</i>. 1903), daughter of Thomas Andrewes of Greenknowes, Dumfriesshire, and widow of Captain Robert Lushington Reilly of Scarvagh, co. Down; there were no children from this marriage. Roden became very infirm at the end of his life, died in Edinburgh on 20 March 1870, and was interred on 29 March in the family vault at Bryansford, co. Down.<br>
<br>Roden was well over 6 feet tall, and in his prime had a commanding and energetic presence with a fluent oratorical style. He was especially effective in addressing Irish protestant audiences, for he well knew &#145;how to call to his aid every feeling and recollection dear to their inmost souls&#146;  (<span class="italic">Random Recollections of Exeter Hall</span>, 31&#150;6). Although by the time of his death the political and religious creed he espoused could be dismissed as &#145;somewhat narrow and antiquated&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>), he was nevertheless an effective ambassador for his beliefs, with a fearless consistency which commanded respect even from his opponents.<br>
