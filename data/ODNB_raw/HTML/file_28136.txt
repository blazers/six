<span class="headword">Vaughan, Sir  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1731&#150;1795), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the second son of Wilmot Vaughan, third Viscount Lisburne (<i>d</i>. 1766), of Crosswood (Trawscoed), Cardiganshire, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1764), daughter of Thomas Watson of Berwick upon Tweed and Grindon Ridge, Northumberland. Without prospects, as the younger son of an impecunious holder of an Irish peerage, Vaughan embarked early on a military career, becoming a second lieutenant in the marines in 1746. The political connections of his whig family, his own military aptitude, and the opportunities of wartime ensured his steady promotion. He became a cornet of dragoons in 1748, lieutenant in 1751, and captain in 1754, and served in Germany early in the Seven Years' War. In 1759 he raised the 94th foot, becoming its lieutenant-colonel in 1760. This regiment, the Royal Welsh volunteers, served in North America and the West Indies, where Vaughan distinguished himself at the capture of Martinique in 1762. When the regiment disbanded later that year Vaughan transferred to the command of the 16th foot, serving in North America until 1767 and then in Ireland; he was promoted colonel in 1772. In 1775 he became colonel of the 46th foot and took them to America. In 1774 he had entered parliament as MP for the venal freeman borough of Berwick upon Tweed, where the Vaughan brothers had inherited the interest of their childless uncle, another Thomas Watson; he represented that constituency until his death. Military duties in the American War restricted his attendance in parliament, where, like his brother Wilmot, the fourth viscount and first earl of Lisburne, who sat on the Admiralty board from 1770 to 1782, he was a supporter of Lord North's ministry. He also sat in the Irish parliament for St Johnstown from 1776 to 1783.<br>
<br>Vaughan rose to military prominence during the American War of Independence, making a name for himself as a bold battlefield commander. In 1776 he led attacks at the battles of Brooklyn Heights and Manhattan Island prior to the capture of New York city. Later that year he was wounded at the battle of White Plains. Promoted major-general in August 1777, Vaughan had a horse shot from under him when storming Fort Montgomery two months later. He was commended for his bravery by General Sir Henry Clinton, who suggested that the fort should be renamed Fort Vaughan. Vaughan then commanded the small army of 2000 men dispatched by Clinton in a vain attempt to reach General Burgoyne before his surrender at Saratoga. His burning of the town of Aesopus (later Kingston, New York)&#151;which he alleged was &#145;a Nursery for almost every Villain in the Country&#146;  (Hurst, 29)&#151;outraged the Americans, who called him General Aesopus. His force burned and destroyed farms until within 46 miles of Albany, then returned to New York city. George III in 1778 ordered that Vaughan be informed of royal approbation of his spirited behaviour. In 1779 Vaughan commanded part of Clinton's second expedition up the Hudson River, and left New York in December. He returned to Britain, and was given a dormant commission to succeed Lord Cornwallis as commander in the southern American colonies in case Cornwallis declined to return there. When Cornwallis did go back, Vaughan was sent to command in the Leeward Islands, arriving in Barbados in February 1780. He promptly reversed the previous defensive strategy of scattered garrisons by collecting a force of 5000 men to attack French islands, but his plans were foiled by Admiral Rodney's inability to win control of West Indian waters. Vaughan had to remain inactive until, on news of the war with the United Provinces, he initiated the capture in February 1781 by Rodney and himself of the Dutch island of St Eustatius, an international entrep&ocirc;t and the main supply base for the American war. Both Vaughan and Rodney busied themselves for some months in arranging the disposal of the vast plunder; Vaughan's share was 9.2 per cent, &pound;150,000. Much of what was sent back to England was intercepted by the French fleet. Sixty-four civil claims were lodged against the two commanders by British merchants who contended that the confiscation of their goods on St Eustatius was illegal, cases which dragged on until 1793. In Vaughan's only known speech in parliament, on 4 December 1781, he defended himself against Edmund Burke's charge that he had made a personal fortune from St Eustatius. He claimed that &#145;neither directly nor indirectly &hellip; had he made a single shilling from the business&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1754&#150;90</span>, 3.576).<br>
<br>After the war Vaughan, who was promoted to lieutenant-general on 20 November 1782, retired from active military service. Among his rewards was the governorship of Berwick Castle, bestowed in 1780 after he had held that of Fort William for a year. Both this post and the colonelcy of the 46th foot he retained until his death. Such sources of income do not explain the considerable wealth he acquired. As early as 1773 he paid &pound;10,000 for an estate in Cardiganshire, and he now made other purchases and gave large loans to his brother. This circumstance puts into perspective his 1781 parliamentary denial that he had profited from the St Eustatius booty. In parliament Vaughan supported the Shelburne ministry of 1782&#150;3, apparently in the hope of being appointed governor of Canada or Gibraltar. Disappointed, he joined his brother Lord Lisburne in support of the 1783 Fox&#150;North coalition, and later opposed the ministry of the younger Pitt. However, in 1788 he admitted personal respect for the prime minister, and made it known that some mark of royal approval of his military services would secure his political allegiance. Pitt demurred, in view of his previous hostility, and Vaughan remained in opposition until won over by being made KB in 1792. In the French Revolutionary Wars he was recalled to army duties. In 1794 he was appointed to succeed Sir John Grey as army commander-in-chief in the Windward Islands. It was a thankless task, as he was beset by slave risings and Carib uprisings instigated by French revolutionaries, and was denied the soldiers needed to reinforce his fever-ridden troops. His proposal to raise black regiments was vetoed by the secretary for war, Henry Dundas, at the behest of the British plantation-owners, a decision against which Vaughan protested vigorously as the subordination of the national interest to private advantage, and which he partly defied. He died, unmarried, reportedly of a bowel complaint, though poison was also suspected, in Martinique on 30 June 1795, with the military conflict still unresolved; he was buried at Mamhead, Devon.<br>
