<span class="headword">Davies,  Myles</span>  (<em>b. </em>1662, <em>d.</em> in or after 1719), <span class="occ">bibliographer</span>, was born at Tre'r Abad, in the parish of Whitford, Flintshire, the son of George Davies and Elizabeth Blount. The family were Roman Catholics, and on 28 September 1686 Davies was admitted into the English College at Rome; he took the oath on 10 May 1687 and was ordained priest on 17 April 1688. He left on 15 October 1688 with a letter from Cardinal Philip Howard, protector of the college, to the bishop who had jurisdiction in Wales. According to the dedication of his recantation of 1705, he had been educated in the seminaries of St Omer, Douai, Li&egrave;ge, Paris, and Rome; after his return he acted as &#145;missioner and popish emissary in Worcestershire, Glocestershire, Herefordshire, Flintshire, &amp;c. and popish confessor and chaplain to the Roman catholick families at Hill-End, at Malvern and Blackmore Park, and others, near the city of Worcester&#146;  (Davies, <span class="italic">Recantation</span>, title-page). He explains in the preface that when abroad he had gone under his mother's family name of Blount, but that in Britain he had been known as Pollet. The recantation, embodying a sermon on <span class="roman">Revelation</span> 18:4, is dedicated to William Beveridge, later bishop of St Asaph, as a result of whose ministry at St Peter Cornhill Davies eventually conformed to the Church of England. His career for the next ten years is obscure, but he seems to have taught French and Italian, and taken part in religious controversy (from an extreme anti-Catholic and anti-Jesuit angle), though this gained him no advancement in the church. He also refers to himself on the title-pages of his later publications as a barrister-at-law or a counsellor, but there is no evidence that he was a member of any of the inns of court. His education had, however, equipped him to write adulatory verse in Latin, which, like his later books, he dedicated to persons of eminence (including royalty after 1715), often without receiving any money in return, but rather ridicule and humiliation.<br>
<br>Davies began the series of volumes later entitled <span class="italic">Athenae Britannicae</span> in 1715, with <span class="italic"><i>Eik&#333;n mikro-biblik&#275;</i>, sive, Icon libellorum, or, A Critical History of Pamphlets &hellip; by a Gentleman of the Inns of Court</span>. It was reissued in the following year under the author's name, with the title <span class="italic">Athenae Britannicae</span>, and this title, an allusion perhaps to the author's origins, recurs spasmodically in the subsequent volumes. In total there are six volumes, all except volume 4 in octavo format; the imprint suggests that they were issued at Davies's expense, from the corner of Little Queen Street, Holborn, London, which was perhaps where the author was living. They contain a great deal of bibliographical information about pamphlets and controversial writings, evidently gleaned from libraries in London, and perhaps Oxford, which Davies frequented. Rancour against the Church of Rome, and against the Jesuits in particular, is omnipresent. The fourth volume, in substantial quarto format, collects several series of educational &#145;posts&#146;, in the newly popular periodical form, notably a <span class="italic">Lawyer's Post</span> in fourteen numbers, though whether these were separately distributed is unclear. Volume 6, &#145;Containing the present and former state of physick, diseases, patients, quacks and doctors&#146;, with dedications to eminent members of the profession, may indicate that Davies, having exhausted the benevolence of the church and the law, was cultivating medicine. The latest date in any part of the <span class="italic">Athenae Britannicae</span> is 1719, and Davies may have died about that time or shortly after, presumably in London.<br>
<br>The incoherence of Davies's method and presentation have obscured the true bibliographical merits and lively style of his books, which are not as rare as they have been thought to be. Isaac D'Israeli, to whom Davies's biography was otherwise unknown, drew a colourful picture of Davies as a &#145;Mendicant Author, the hawker of his own works&#146;  (D'Israeli, 1.67), whose life was passed in the study of languages and the sciences, who was &#145;not only surrounded by his books, but with the more urgent companions of a wife and family&#146;  (ibid., 1.70), &#145;while his faculties appear to have been disordered from the simplicity of his nature, and driven to madness by indigence and insult&#146;  (ibid., 1.67).<br>
