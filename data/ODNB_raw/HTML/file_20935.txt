</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Otter,  William</span>  (1768&#150;1840), <span class="occ">bishop of Chichester</span>, born on 23 October 1768 at Cuckney, Nottinghamshire, was the fourth son of the seven children of Edward Otter (1724&#150;1785), vicar of Cuckney, and also of the Derbyshire parishes of Bolsover, Scarcliffe, and Upper Langwith. His mother was Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1772), daughter of John Wright of North Anston, Yorkshire. He went up to Jesus College, Cambridge, in 1785, where he was Rustat scholar, graduating BA as fourth wrangler in 1790. Otter was tutored by William Frend and, like his brother Edward (1764&#150;1837), a fellow of the college, supported Frend in his dispute with the college in 1793. In that year Otter proceeded MA, and later, in 1836, BD and DD. In 1791 he was ordained to the curacy of Helston, Cornwall, where he was also master of the grammar school. Otter returned to Jesus College as a fellow in 1796, remaining until 1804, and for a time served as a committee member of the Cambridge Volunteers.<br>
<br>As an undergraduate Otter befriended Edward Daniel Clarke (of whom he published a <span class="italic">Life</span> in 1824) and Thomas Robert Malthus. Together with John Marten Cripps, they travelled to the continent in 1799. Otter alone accompanied Malthus onwards from Lake V&auml;nern as he gathered supporting evidence for his <span class="italic">Essay on Population</span> in Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Russia, while Otter occupied himself with botanizing (he was later a fellow of the Linnean Society). Otter's memoir of Malthus, prefixed to the second edition of <span class="italic">The Principles of Political Economy</span> (1836), sought to create a more receptive climate for Malthus's works by highlighting his personal qualities, and remains an important source for Malthus's life.<br>
<br>Otter resigned his fellowship on his marriage in 1804 to Nancy Sadleir (<i>d</i>. 1860), daughter of William Bruere of Leatherhead, former secretary to the government and member of the supreme court of Calcutta. The couple had three sons and five daughters: among them William Bruere became archdeacon of Chichester after his father's death; his eldest daughter, Sophia, married Malthus's son, Henry; his second daughter, Caroline, married John (later the first Lord) Romilly; the fourth, Maria, married Lord Justice Sir William Milbourne James; and the fifth, Emily, married Edward Strutt, the first Lord Belper. Shortly before his own marriage Otter was presented by Bruere to the rectory of Colmworth, Bedfordshire. He resigned this living along with that of Sturmer, Essex, which he had held for only one year, on his appointment as rector of Chetwynd, Shropshire, in 1811, to which he added the vicarage of Kinlet in 1814. Otter supplemented his income through tutoring, numbering among his pupils sons of Sir Samuel Romilly, Sir John St Aubin, and Sir Roger Newdigate; in 1822 he moved his family to Oxford and acted as private tutor to the third Lord Ongley. In 1825 Otter acquired a third benefice, the vicarage of St Mark's, Kennington, through the patronage of George D'Oyly, the husband of his wife's sister.<br>
<br>Possibly through his association with D'Oyly, Otter was chosen as first principal of King's College, London (after John Lonsdale declined the post), in June 1831, and resigned Kennington on his appointment; his whig connections helped prevent the college appearing too partisan. He was simultaneously appointed divinity lecturer, delivering weekly sermons and Monday discourses on theology throughout his tenure. Since the principal was excluded from the governing council, Otter's authority over the college was limited. While he won the confidence of his staff and safely saw the college through its first years, he did not develop any particular affection for the institution, having little contact with it after his resignation in 1836, and instead joining the senate of the University of London from that year.<br>
<br>Otter resigned from King's College and his Shropshire parishes when he was chosen by Lord Melbourne for the bishopric of Chichester: &#145;exactly the place for me&#146;, he observed to Samuel Butler  (BL, Add. MS 34590, fols. 309&#150;10). He was consecrated at Lambeth on 2 October 1836. Although Otter was already in indifferent health when appointed, he was an active and reforming diocesan. His most notable innovation was the diocesan association established in January 1838, intended to support the provision of church accommodation and to both augment endowments and fund the stipends of additional clergy. By December the association had raised &pound;2732 for accommodation and &pound;2085 for additional clergy, with another &pound;1120 subscribed for special purposes. In 1839 the association absorbed a diocesan board of education founded earlier in the year, while the ruridecanal system was reinvigorated in order to provide support, with Otter encouraging his deans to revive the ruridecanal chapters. The training school for masters in parochial schools which began modest operations at Otter's initiative in 1840 provided the focus for a memorial subscription proposed by Julius Hare, which in 1849&#150;50 bore fruit in the building of Bishop Otter College, Chichester.<br>
<br>Otter's commitment and lack of partisanship won him the affection and co-operation of both clergy and laity. He worked closely with the earl of Chichester and especially with the duke of Richmond. Most strikingly he took an interest in the careers of both Julius Hare and Henry Manning. In 1840 Otter appointed Hare archdeacon of Lewes, dismissing Hare's reservations regarding the liturgy and creed with the observation that &#145;my opinions on these points are just the same as your own&#146;  (N. M. Distall, <span class="italic">Guessing at Truth</span>, 1979, 138&#150;9). Otter acknowledged Manning's promise in appointing him rural dean and secretary of the diocesan association, although he deplored his more controversial publications as liable to alienate evangelicals in the diocese, warning that &#145;the peace of the Church is of much more advantage than any advance even to a good cause, which can only be obtained at the expense of peace&#146;  (E. S. Purcell, <span class="italic">Life of Cardinal Manning</span>, 1895, 7.136). Otter's success in allaying doctrinal tensions in the diocese is apparent from the absence of controversy associated with the foundation at Chichester in 1838 of a theological college with the Tractarian Charles Marriott as principal, for which Otter shared responsibility with Manning and the dean of Chichester, George Chandler.<br>
<br>A tall, thin man, &#145;of very mild and amiable manners&#146;  (W. Sussex RO, Goodwood MS 1576), Otter was a liberal in theology and a moderate whig in politics; at times, however, both as a diocesan reformer and, at the end of his life, in his defence of cathedral institutions against the proposed reforms of the ecclesiastical commissioners, he stood comfortably alongside decided high-churchmen. Otter's first publications appeared in 1812, vindicating the British and Foreign Bible Society from the strictures of Herbert Marsh. After this date his writings mostly concerned pastoralia, notably the posthumously published <span class="italic">Pastoral Addresses</span>, which he had delivered while bishop. He advised his clergy to maintain their studies and reflect on their reading (his own favourite author was Robert Leighton, archbishop of Glasgow 1611&#150;1684), and called on them to revive the practice of catechism as part of a wider stress on making Christian instruction more demanding in the light of the spread of education. Otter frequently referred to the works of his friend Malthus, and emphasized their implications for devising approaches to the problem of pauperism&#151;in 1818 he described the provident society established in his own parish, and later welcomed the new poor law. Otter placed most stress on the importance of popular education in bringing the poor to an understanding of their own condition. He looked for close co-operation between the National Society and the government, and in 1839 took a more moderate position than most of his episcopal colleagues on the government plan for tighter control of the distribution of public subsidies for education. He was one of three bishops who did not support Archbishop Howley's resolution on the subject in parliament on 5 July 1839, although he remained opposed to many features of the government scheme as it developed. Otter died at Broadstairs, Kent, on 20 August 1840, and was buried in the retrochoir of Chichester Cathedral.<br>
