<span class="headword">Reade,  Thomas Mellard</span>  (1832&#150;1909), <span class="occ">architect and geologist</span>, was born on 27 May 1832 at 31 Mill Street, Toxteth Park, Liverpool, where his father, William James Reade (1794&#150;1867), ran a small private school. The Reade family, formerly Staffordshire yeomen, included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23227/', "Joseph Bancroft Reade")</script> and Sir Thomas Reade, deputy adjutant-general at St Helena during Napoleon's captivity. Reade's mother was Mary Mellard (1790&#150;1866) of Newcastle under Lyme, who was aunt to the novelist Dinah Maria Mulock [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19519/', "Craik, Dinah Maria")</script>].<br>
<br>Reade was educated in private schools before beginning work at the age of twelve in the offices of Edward Eyes &amp; Sons, architects and surveyors in Liverpool. In 1853 he became a draughtsman for the London and North Western Railway Company, initially based in Warrington, subsequently in Liverpool. In 1860 he successfully set up in private practice as architect and civil engineer, working in and around Liverpool. He laid out the Blundellsands estate in 1865 and, from 1868 onwards, lived there in a house he had himself designed. On 19 May 1866 he married Emma Eliza Taylor, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fox (<i>d</i>. 1895), the widow of his long-standing friend Alfred Taylor. They had three sons and a daughter. Reade became architect to the Liverpool school board in 1870 and thereafter designed most of their school buildings, until 1902 when the board was taken over by the city council. In 1890, while president of the Liverpool Architectural Society, he helped to found the school of architecture at University College, Liverpool.<br>
<br>As a result of his engineering work, Reade became interested in geology. He joined the Liverpool Geological Society in 1870 and subsequently published almost 200 scientific papers. Much of his early work concerned the local glacial and post-glacial deposits; it remains of great value since many of the sites and sections described are now built over and inaccessible for study.<br>
<br>In 1873, when the proposal to build a rail tunnel under the Mersey was being considered, Reade predicted the existence of a deep buried channel beneath the river. When the project was approved, the engineers prudently modified their plans so that the tunnel ran through bedrock below the supposed channel. Reade later had the satisfaction of visiting the tunnel works and seeing the bottom of the channel he had predicted in the roof overhead. However, some of Reade's other scientific work was less successful, including an attempt to estimate the age of the earth from the amount of lime carried in solution by rivers. In 1886 he published <span class="italic">The Origin of the Mountain Ranges</span> which was well received by his contemporaries. However, Reade's theories therein have not stood the test of time and are now of only historic interest. What is still of interest is an unusual geological memorial. In 1898 Reade persuaded Crosby district council to excavate an 18 ton erratic boulder from the glacial clays being worked in a local quarry. The boulder, which consisted of white gypsum, was then placed on public display. Now somewhat weatherworn, it still stands in Coronation Park, Great Crosby.<br>
<br>An illness in early childhood severely impaired Reade's hearing and the resulting deafness became increasingly pronounced in middle age. Consequently he found large meetings difficult to follow and rarely attended them. Nevertheless he became a fellow of the Geological Society of London in 1872 and was awarded its Murchison medal in 1896. He was president of the Liverpool Geological Society three times, president of the Liverpool Architectural Society, a fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and an associate member of the Institution of Civil Engineers. Reade died at his home, Park Corner, Blundellsands, on 26 May 1909; he was buried at Sefton, Lancashire.<br>
