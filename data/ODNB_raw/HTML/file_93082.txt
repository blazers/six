<span class="headword">Darwin,  Anne Elizabeth <span class="st"> [Annie]</span></span>  (1841&#150;1851), <span class="occ">daughter of Charles Darwin and subject of a memorial essay</span>, was born on 2 March 1841 at 12 Upper Gower Street, London, the first daughter and second of the ten children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7176/', "Charles Robert Darwin (1809&#150;1882)")</script>, naturalist, geologist, and originator of the theory of natural selection, and Emma (1808&#150;1896), daughter of Josiah Wedgwood of Maer, Staffordshire. Anne Elizabeth was known in the family as Annie. Her elder brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/94741/', "William Erasmus Darwin (1839&#150;1914)")</script> who, like Annie, was in early life the subject of their father's scientific observation. Among her younger sisters and brothers were Henrietta Emma 
    (later Henrietta Litchfield; 1843&#150;1927)
  , <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32718/', "George Howard Darwin (1845&#150;1912)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32717/', "Francis Darwin (1848&#150;1925)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54078/', "Leonard Darwin (1850&#150;1943)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32719/', "Horace Darwin (1851&#150;1928)")</script>. Annie was baptized at St Peter's Church, Maer, on 4 June 1842. For the first eighteen months of her life the family lived at 12 Upper Gower Street. Annie and William were looked after by Jessie Brodie, a Scottish nurse, who had previously cared for Anne Isabella Thackeray 
    (later Lady Ritchie; 1837&#150;1919)
   and her sisters, daughters of the novelist William Makepeace Thackeray.<br>
<br>During Annie's first three years Darwin observed her behaviour and expressions for a scientific comparison with her elder brother, William, and a young orang-utan Darwin had observed at London Zoo in 1838. When Annie was a year old, he noted how she stared without blinking at an unfamiliar face while older children and adults would shift their gaze. He conjectured that Annie might lack shyness because she had not yet grasped that the people she saw could have their own awareness and be thinking about her. Darwin also repeated an experiment he had carried out on the orang-utan and William. He observed that Annie was perplexed by the image of a person in a mirror approaching her from behind, and commented that the ape had shown more sense by placing its hand behind the glass. He included both points in his &#145;Biographical sketch of an infant&#146;, which was published in the journal <span class="italic">Mind</span> (July 1877) and is one of the founding texts of child psychology.<br>
<br>In September 1842 Darwin moved with his family to Down House in Downe, Kent, and during the years that followed Annie grew into an outgoing, affectionate, and demonstrative child, loved by her parents and popular in the wider family circle. Emma Darwin&#151;a devout Unitarian who nevertheless took her family to the village church&#151;read the <span class="roman">Bible</span> with her daughter and taught her a &#145;simple Unitarian creed&#146;  (Litchfield, 2.173). Annie was educated at home by a governess, Catherine Thorley, and the village school teacher. From early childhood she developed a special bond with her father, petting him while he sat with her and pirouetting ahead of him when he paced along the Sand-walk, his &#145;thinking path&#146;. He particularly valued her affection and high spirits because he was at the time in poor health and under pressure with his work.<br>
<br>In Annie's tenth year, Emma noticed signs of illness and Darwin sought advice from the physician and hydropath, James Manby Gully of Malvern, who was already providing, with some success, his controversial water treatment for Darwin's ailments. Gully proposed a course of soakings, sweatings, and rubbings for Annie, and Darwin oversaw her care between January and March 1851. He logged the treatment given each morning and recorded Annie's condition during the day and night, using his meticulous experimental method in a desperate attempt to find a cure. At the end of March he took her to Gully's clinic in Malvern; Emma had to remain at Down House because she was heavily pregnant with their ninth child. Ten days after arriving in Malvern, Annie developed a bilious fever; she died on 23 April 1851, aged ten years and one month. Her father, Jessie Brodie, and Catherine Thorley were with her during the last days, and Darwin's daily letters to Emma provide an exceptionally detailed account of three carers' experiences of a child's fatal illness before the advances of modern medicine. Annie was buried in the churchyard of the priory church, Malvern, on 25 April 1851. James Gully certified the cause of death as &#145;bilious fever with typhoid character&#146;. From what is known about the course of her illness, it is probable that she died from tuberculosis.<br>
<br>In the days after Annie's death, Darwin composed a twelve-page memorial of her for the family. Writing with utter fluency and directness about his deepest feelings as her father, he dwelt on her lively and affectionate nature while she had been well. Darwin ended the memorial: <blockquote>We have lost the joy of the household, and the solace of our old age: she must have known how we loved her; oh that she could now know how deeply, how tenderly we do still and shall ever love her dear joyous face. Blessings on her. (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Charles Darwin</span>, 5.542)</blockquote>In the remaining thirty years of his life he never spoke about Annie to his other children, but referred briefly to her in a number of letters to friends and acquaintances who had suffered similar losses. His comments show that his grief remained intense for some years but was eventually softened by his lasting memories of &#145;her sweet ways&#146;  (Darwin, <span class="italic">Autobiographies</span>, 57). Extracts from the memorial were published by Darwin's son Francis in his <span class="italic">Life and Letters of Charles Darwin</span> (1887) and in <span class="italic">Emma Darwin: A Century of Family Letters</span> (1915) by his daughter Henrietta Litchfield, who added excerpts from the correspondence between Charles and Emma while he was in Malvern.<br>
<br>Darwin's experience of his daughter's life and his bereavement had a double significance for his thinking. Recent scholarship (Moore) has shown that it was probably the final factor in his gradual rejection of Christian faith, while Pat Jalland notes how the Darwins stood out among middle- and upper-class families of the time for their non-reliance on the standard Victorian consolations of faith. Darwin's feelings for his daughter were almost certainly a factor in his developing view of the natural strength of the human affections. This became a key element in his treatment of the basis of co-operation in animal and human groups, and of the evolution of the moral sense, as set out in <span class="italic">The Descent of Man</span> (1871). The now widespread idea that Darwinism sees natural life as an endless selfish struggle for survival misses this central element in his thinking. Darwin put his own view of the value of human affection most clearly in a private comment to his close friend, the botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker, at a time when Hooker was coming to terms with the death of his own daughter and worried about his son who had scarlet fever: &#145;Much love, much trial, but what an utter desert is life without love&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Charles Darwin</span>, 11.682).<br>
