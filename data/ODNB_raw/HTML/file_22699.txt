<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pratt,  Charles</span>, first Earl Camden  (1714&#150;1794), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was born in Kensington, London, and baptized there on 21 March 1714, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22701/', "Sir John Pratt (1657&#150;1725)")</script>, MP and later lord chief justice of king's bench, and his second wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1728), daughter of the Revd Hugh Wilson, vicar of Trefeglwys and a canon of Bangor Cathedral. He was educated at Eton College (1725&#150;31) and King's College, Cambridge (BA, 1736; MA, 1740), and developed an early interest in the constitution as a safeguard of liberty which was to characterize his life. Always destined for the law, in accordance with his father's wishes, he was entered at the Inner Temple in 1728 and was called to the bar in 1738. He so failed to prosper at king's bench and on the western circuit that he despaired of his profession and thought of the church, until in the mid-1740s his career was given a much-needed boost by a friendly senior counsel, Robert Henley, later as Lord Northington his predecessor as lord chancellor. Once established in his profession Pratt made an advantageous marriage on 4 October 1749 to Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1779), daughter of Nicholas Jeffreys and eventually heir of Brecon Priory, an estate that commanded a leading political interest in Brecknockshire: they had a son, the politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22705/', "John Jeffreys Pratt")</script>, and four daughters.<h2>
<a name="Championofliberty"></a>Champion of liberty</h2>By the 1750s Pratt was involved in cases of political import before the House of Commons and at Westminster Hall, notably the prosecution in 1752 of Alexander Murray for libel, when he first argued, successfully for the defence, that the jury rather than the judge should assess the intent of a libel and not merely the fact of publication, a legal contention he helped to bring to a triumphant conclusion forty years later. Appointed a king's counsel in 1755, Pratt was drawn into politics by William Pitt, a friend at Eton who often consulted him on legal and constitutional issues. Pitt's connection with the opposition Leicester House court of the young prince of Wales led in 1756 to Pratt's appointment as attorney-general to the prince, in preference to a judgeship offered him by the duke of Newcastle, the prime minister. In July 1757 Pitt, when forming his famous wartime coalition with Newcastle, insisted on the appointment of Pratt as attorney-general over the head of the solicitor-general, Charles Yorke, son of Newcastle's ally Lord Hardwicke, the former lord chancellor, who earlier had hindered the career of Yorke's perceived rival.<br>
<br>The two men perforce had to work together in the routine legal business of government, and the Pratt&#150;Yorke judgment of 24 December 1757 was a landmark in imperial history. The crown's law officers distinguished between territories acquired by conquest, where the property as well as the dominion was vested in the crown, and those acquired by private treaty, where the crown enjoyed only sovereignty: this opinion, which related to the East India Company, was subsequently applied elsewhere in the British empire.<br>
<br>Pratt was brought into the House of Commons as MP for the burgage borough of Downton, but was rarely called upon to defend the successful war ministry in parliamentary debate. He sponsored the <span class="roman">Habeas Corpus Amendment Bill</span> of 1758, designed to extend that measure to cover civil and political as well as criminal cases. It was favoured by Pitt but rejected by the House of Lords. In the same year Pratt as attorney-general successfully prosecuted both Florence Hensey, an Irishman who was a French spy, and the libeller John Shebbeare when, though not defence counsel, he still maintained that the decision be taken by the jury. In 1760 Pratt led the famous prosecution of Lord Ferrers, a peer convicted and hanged for murdering a servant, to the astonishment of European high society. But Pratt's chief activity in these years was the development of a flourishing practice in the court of chancery which gave him financial security, and about this time he bought the estate of Camden Place in Kent.<br>
<br>The time of quiet prosperity and growing reputation ended in 1761. Pratt's political predicament when his mentor, Pitt, left the ministry in October proved to be brief, for the death on 15 December of the lord chief justice of common pleas opened a vacancy to which he could retreat from the political scene. Resigning his parliamentary seat, accepting the concomitant honours of a knighthood on 28 December, and being sworn of the privy council, Pratt took the judicial post in January 1762. The court of common pleas, by contrast with that of king's bench, seldom dealt with cases of political import, and Pratt may well have thought his brief political career to be over. But when John Wilkes was arrested on 30 April 1763 under a general warrant for an alleged seditious libel in the forty-fifth number of the <span class="italic">North Briton</span>, it was to the obviously sympathetic judge at common pleas that application was made for his release. Judge Pratt freed Wilkes, declaring him immune as an MP from arrest on such a charge. The popularity Pratt thereby acquired with the London mob went to his head, encouraging him during the summer of 1763 to incite juries into awarding excessive damages, quite disproportionate to any inconvenience suffered, to printers mistakenly arrested in the same case. On 6 December, Pratt followed up this behaviour by condemning the use of general warrants for the search of houses and other buildings, Wilkes being awarded &pound;1000 in damages by the jury. The contemporary press celebrated this victory for liberty. &#145;By this important decision, every Englishman has the satisfaction of seeing that his home is his castle&#146;  (<span class="italic">St James's Chronicle</span>, 8 Dec 1763). Two years later he confirmed and strengthened this ruling by his judgment in the landmark <i>Entinck v. Carrington</i> case. This arose not, as is often stated, out of the <span class="italic">North Briton</span> affair, but from a ministerial attempt in 1762 to prosecute the weekly periodical <span class="italic">Monitor</span>. On 27 November 1765 he condemned as &#145;contrary to law&#146; the use of a general warrant to search for and seize papers in charges of seditious libel. Of greater significance even than the verdict was the reason for his decision. He refuted &#145;the argument for state necessity&#146; by declaring that &#145;the common law does not understand that kind of reasoning&#146;, thereby confirming the common law as the best defence against arbitrary government  (Holdsworth, <span class="italic">Eng. law</span>, 670).<br>
<br>By then Pratt had re-entered parliament, being created Baron Camden on 17 July 1765. His peerage was one of the measures by which the incoming ministry of Lord Rockingham vainly sought to win the support of William Pitt. Camden declined to speak in the first Lords debate on the American <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span> crisis, but attended the Commons debate of 14 January 1766 to ascertain Pitt's line. The subsequent speeches of the two men on 3 February were so similar that contemporaries thought they had been prepared together. In his maiden Lords speech that day Camden argued that taxation was founded on consent, and therefore depended on representation. He was one of the minority of five peers who then voted against the ministerial resolution asserting what was the generally accepted right of parliament to tax all British territories. But Camden logically supported the administration in the Lords debate of 11 March over repeal of the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span>, when he claimed that the colonial resistance had been aroused by hardship caused by that taxation, an unconvincing contention in the light even of contemporary knowledge.<h2>
<a name="Lordchancellor"></a>Lord chancellor</h2>It was from Camden that George III in May 1766 ascertained that Pitt was willing to form a ministry, but Camden was absent on the midland circuit when the change of administration took place in July. It was generally assumed that Pitt, now to become earl of Chatham, would make Camden his lord chancellor, and he accepted the office when he returned to London, stipulating an additional allowance of &pound;1500 and the reversion of a lucrative exchequer tellership for his elder son John Jeffreys Pratt, to whom the office reverted in May 1780. Camden became lord chancellor on 30 July 1766. It was a post that, as well as sitting on the woolsack as <i>de facto</i> speaker of the House of Lords, involved several discrete legal functions. He presided over the court of chancery, and although his speciality was common law, his judgments in the equity cases that now came before him have been deemed sound, if not innovative. As head of the law lords Camden also presided over appeals and other legal cases referred to the House of Lords. In 1767 he secured unanimous approval for the opinion of Lord Mansfield that the City of London should not fine dissenters for refusing to serve as corporate officials when they were disqualified by the <span class="roman">Corporation Act</span>, a reinforcement of religious liberty. Camden's political impartiality was demonstrated when in 1768 a complaint of John Wilkes about serving two prison sentences as consecutive and not concurrent was dismissed. In 1769 he overrode both public opinion and evidential probability when finding for the mother in his judgment on the notorious Douglas legitimacy case. Camden continued to play a leading role in such cases even after leaving the woolsack. Of long-term significance was his decisive 1774 opinion that authors had no perpetual literary copyright, since that would handicap the advance of knowledge, and he played a part in rejecting a <span class="roman">Copyright Bill</span> of the same year.<br>
<br>As a politician the new lord chancellor was soon exposed to criticism that questioned his role as a champion of liberty against state power. A parliamentary ban on the export of corn expired on 26 August 1766, and the combination of a poor harvest and the resumption of exports provoked widespread disorder through fears of high prices and of possible starvation. The Chatham ministry, acting through the privy council and with the support of Lord Chancellor Camden, decided upon a royal proclamation of 26 September prohibiting corn exports until after parliament met on 11 November. But this action breached the 1689 <span class="roman">Bill of Rights</span> provision that forbade the crown to suspend laws, and the matter was promptly raised in both houses of parliament. Camden found Chatham and himself accused of tyrannical behaviour. The plea of necessity, so contrary to Camden's own famous legal opinion of the previous year, did not allay parliamentary resentment, especially when Camden unwisely claimed that it had been only &#145;a forty days tyranny&#146;, and the ministry had to pacify criticism by the humiliation of an act of indemnity.<br>
<br>Camden's reputation as a champion of liberty was soon further weakened over the American problem. Although the Chatham group [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95095', "Chathamites")</script>] had opposed the 1766 <span class="roman">Declaratory Act</span> they now accepted it as the law, and sundry acts of colonial defiance hardened Chatham's attitude to America. Camden as usual followed his lead, his Lords speeches of 1767 urging a firm but prudent stance. On the key issue of colonial taxation the lord chancellor was a member of the cabinet that endorsed Charles Townshend's 1767 scheme of taxation by port duties, as meeting the supposed American distinction of internal and external taxes. Edmund Burke later recalled that &#145;Lord Camden &hellip; contended that these were external&#146; and so acceptable to the colonies  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 1.280n.). Yet when in 1768 the American challenge to all parliamentary taxation showed that claim to have been a delusion, Camden promptly adopted the view that colonial taxation was &#145;inexpedient&#146;. A letter of 4 October 1768 to the acting prime minister the duke of Grafton reeked of indecision:<blockquote>I do not know what to advise &hellip; I submit to the declaratory law, and have thought it my duty, upon that ground, as a minister, to exert my constitutional power to carry out the duty act into execution. But as a member of the legislature I cannot bring myself to advise violent measures.</blockquote>The American crisis coincided with the final end of the Chatham ministry, and Camden promptly transferred his allegiance. &#145;You are my Pole Star, Lord Chatham being eclipsed. I had rather see your Grace at the head of government than any other man in the kingdom&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography &hellip; of Grafton</span>, 215&#150;17). Since Chatham gave ill health as the reason for his resignation in October 1768, Camden and others of his followers could continue in office under the Grafton ministry without embarrassment. The reshuffled cabinet was finely balanced on America between advocates of coercion and conciliation. Camden was foremost among the latter, opposing hardline proposals of the American secretary, Hillsborough, and playing an important role in devising the tax concessions decided upon by the cabinet on 1 May 1769. He was deemed personally responsible for the public promise that no future taxes would be levied on the colonies, and he voted in the cabinet minority that vainly sought to include the tea duty with the other Townshend duties to be repealed. Those concessions sufficed to allay the colonial discontent in 1770, but the tea tax remained a hostage to fortune.<br>
<br>By that time America had long been eclipsed as a political issue by the second Wilkes case of the Middlesex election. The return of John Wilkes for Middlesex on 28 March 1768 was a shock to the ministry. Camden, absent in Bath, commented to Grafton that &#145;the event is disagreeable, and unforeseen&#146;. He was as aghast as his colleagues that &#145;a convict and an outlaw&#146; could be elected. Although Camden stated that expulsion might be according to precedent he feared the consequences if Wilkes should then be re-elected, and advised that the best tactic would be to ignore him  (<span class="italic">Autobiography &hellip; of Grafton</span>, 199&#150;200). When the ministry decided on expulsion Camden, whether through timidity, love of popularity, or knowledge of Chatham's opinion, parted company with Grafton on the issue, writing on 9 January 1769: &#145;Your Grace and I have unfortunately differed &hellip; I had rather pardon Wilkes than punish him. This is a political opinion independent of the case&#146;  (ibid., 201). Camden thereafter distanced himself from his colleagues on the matter, seemingly being absent from cabinet and silent in parliament.<h2>
<a name="Inopposition"></a>In opposition</h2>In July 1769 Camden's political allegiance reverted to Chatham, whose return then to health was marked by denunciation of ministerial policies on Wilkes and America. Only royal pressure kept Camden in office until the end of 1769, with the lord chancellor generally being considered as in open opposition. When the new parliamentary session began on 9 January 1770 Chatham moved in the Lords an opposition amendment to the address. The lord chancellor thereupon left the woolsack to break his self-imposed silence:<blockquote>I have often drooped and hung down my head in Council, and disapproved by my looks those steps which I knew my avowed opposition could not prevent &hellip; I now proclaim to the world, that I entirely coincide in the opinion expressed by my noble friend &hellip; respecting this unconstitutional and illegal vote of the House of Commons. (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. Hist.</span>, 16.644)</blockquote>Camden, on the advice of his friends, did not resign, but George III was scandalized that a lord chancellor should oppose the king's government, and insisted upon his dismissal, on 17 January 1770.<br>
<br>Camden may well have expected a prompt return to that office if, as expected, the combined opposition parties of Chatham, Rockingham, and Grenville brought down the king's ministry: but although Grafton resigned, Lord North successfully took over, and Camden began twelve years of opposition to his administration. Since after early 1770 Chatham seldom attended parliament for some years, and Camden's relationship with his deputy, Lord Shelburne, was on the cool side, Camden often found himself playing a lone hand. Much of the parliamentary session of 1770&#150;71 was taken up by a dispute over the law of libel, highlighted by a personal controversy between Camden and an old legal adversary, Lord Chief Justice Mansfield of king's bench. The issue was again whether a jury should decide whether an alleged libel was criminal or innocent or, as Mansfield maintained, merely the fact of publication: but a much-anticipated Lords confrontation between the two lawyers never took place. During the next two sessions Camden adopted a low political profile, although in 1772 he did oppose the provision of the <span class="roman">Royal Family Marriage Act</span> extending it to all descendants of George II, pointing out the future impracticability of the clause.<br>
<br>The American crisis of 1774 brought Camden back into the forefront of politics. When the Lords debated the <span class="roman">Boston Port Bill</span> on 28 March he criticized as mischievous the tea duty that had led to the defiance of the Boston Tea Party. Although this view was consistent with his cabinet opinion of 1769 he was continually reminded afterwards that he had been lord chancellor when the tax was first introduced. In reply he maintained that he had personally never consented to any American taxation, resorting in 1776 to the quibble that he had been absent from the relevant cabinet meeting of 1767. The Chathamite group at first supported the coercive legislation of 1774, and on 11 May Camden sided with the ministry over the <span class="roman">Massachusetts Government Bill</span>. &#145;I am too much of an Englishman not to pray for the success of this country let her cause be good or bad&#146;  (Lord Camden's speech in the House of Lords, BL, Add. MS 35912, fols. 221&#150;2). But Chathamite fears that the <span class="roman">Massachusetts Justice Bill</span> would provoke colonial resistance led Camden into opposing that measure on 18 May. Thereafter the Chathamite group opposed ministerial policy on America, and Camden played a full part in parliamentary debates. His major speech on America, timed at ninety minutes, was on 16 February 1775 against the <span class="roman">New England Trade and Fishery Bill</span>, designed to coerce the northern colonies by crippling their economy. The speech was widely thought to have been concocted with Benjamin Franklin for American consumption. The former Massachusetts governor Thomas Hutchinson scornfully commented: &#145;I never heard a greater flow of words, but my knowledge of facts in this controversy caused his misrepresentations and glosses to appear in a very strong light.&#146; Camden admitted that both parliament and public opinion were behind government policy, which he condemned as being not a trade bill but &#145;a bill of war; it draws the sword, and in its necessary consequences plunges the empire into civil and unnatural war&#146;. He quoted John Locke's opinion that resistance to tyranny was justified, and declared the military conquest of America, a free people in a vast country, to be impossible:<blockquote>My lords, it is evident that England must one day lose the dominion of America. It is impossible that this petty island can continue in dependence that mighty continent &hellip; To protract the time of separation to a distant day is all that can be hoped. (Simmons and Thomas, 5.540&#150;52)</blockquote>Later in the session Camden, responding to a petition from a minority of British settlers, on 17 May 1775 moved the repeal of the <span class="roman">Quebec Act</span> as incompatible with the religion and constitution of Britain: it is not known whether he had opposed its passage in 1774, for no reports of relevant Lords debates survive. Camden now gave vent to deep prejudices, claiming the secret purpose was to create a popish army in Canada to subdue the protestant British colonies, an accusation so absurd as to be deemed unworthy of a reply. The motion was defeated by eighty-eight votes to twenty-eight after proxies had been called for.<br>
<br>The outbreak of the American War of Independence reduced the Chathamite group to despair, and Camden withdrew from parliament for a while. &#145;America is lost and the war afoot&#146; he wrote on 24 January 1776 to Grafton, whose personal friendship he had retained since their political split in 1770 and who had now quit government for opposition  (<span class="italic">Autobiography &hellip; of Grafton</span>, 279). The Chathamite line during the war was to advocate conciliation, deploring equally the idea of American independence and the attempt to prevent it. Camden spoke often and at length in parliament on these themes, although less so from 1778 after the death of Chatham and French intervention in the conflict. He remained in the forefront of the political battle, and his speech on 27 November 1781 was rated excellent even by political opponents. But, nearing seventy, Camden did not claim his old post of lord chancellor when Lord North's fall in March 1782 was followed by a coalition ministry of the two former opposition factions led by Rockingham and Shelburne. He became lord president of the council, a cabinet post of high rank and little work. In Lords debates Camden supported both the programme of economical reform, designed to reduce government corruption of parliament, and the legislative independence of Ireland. But the ministry was an uneasy alliance, and Prime Minister Rockingham's death on 1 July merely precipitated its collapse. Camden continued in office, as Shelburne's new administration essentially had a Chathamite base; but after Commons defeats in February 1783 over the American peace terms Camden advised Shelburne to resign, emphasizing the point by doing so himself. Camden went into active opposition to the ensuing Fox&#150;North coalition ministry and, denouncing the measure as a patronage job, played a leading role in the Lords debate of 9 December 1783 on Fox's <span class="roman">India Bill</span> that resulted in its defeat and the dismissal of the ministry. Camden then waived his claim to office to facilitate the ministerial arrangements of the younger William Pitt, son of his old political mentor. But a year later he accepted once more the post of lord president, which he retained until his death nearly a decade later, being raised to Earl Camden on 13 May 1786, with an additional peerage of Viscount Bayham so that his son could enjoy that courtesy title. Camden favoured Pitt's <span class="roman">Parliamentary Reform Bill</span> of 1785, and defended in Lords debates his Irish trade proposals of the same year. Then, as his parliamentary career was beginning to fade away, Camden was suddenly propelled to the forefront of the political scene by the prevarication of Lord Chancellor Thurlow in the Regency crisis, when George III in November 1788 suffered the illness then thought to be insanity and subsequently diagnosed as porphyria. As lord president he conducted the privy council examination of the king's doctors. It was then Camden who, because of Thurlow's behaviour, had to put forward in the House of Lords the ministerial contention that parliament should appoint the regent, as against the opposition's claim for the immediate right of the prince of Wales, their ally, so to act. Camden's resolution to that effect was carried in the Lords by ninety-nine votes to sixty-six on 23 December 1788; and on 22 January 1789 he carried by ninety-four to sixty-eight another that the prince should be appointed regent only under restrictions, so as to avoid inconvenience if the king should recover. George III did so the next month, obviating the need for that arrangement.<br>
<br>Thereafter Camden took little part in parliamentary debate, with the notable exception of his support for Fox's <span class="roman">Libel Act</span> of 1792, that established as law one of his own long-cherished opinions: that the jury, not the judges, should decide whether or not a publication was a libel. In the Lords debate of 16 May 1792 on the second reading Camden argued that the issue was intention, and a jury should decide that, as it did in murder cases. Moving from legal to political argument, he then said that the people of England, represented by a jury, must take care of the liberty of the press, not judges, who were possibly susceptible to government influence. Camden's speech was deemed instrumental in securing a Lords majority of fifty-seven to thirty-two, despite the unanimous opinion of the judges to the contrary. Camden maintained a regular attendance at cabinet, which was sometimes held at his own house to allow for the ill health that led him to move from Camden Place in Kent to his town house in Hill Street, Berkeley Square, London, where he died on 18 April 1794. He was buried at Seal, Kent, near the Pratt family home of The Wildernesse.<h2>
<a name="Significance"></a>Significance</h2>Legal historians have acclaimed Lord Camden as a great lord chancellor, Lord Campbell perhaps because he allowed his whig and even radical prejudices to sway his judicial opinions. Sir William Holdsworth, in his magisterial <span class="italic">History of English Law</span>, rated Camden as &#145;a great constitutional lawyer, a great legal historian, and a great common lawyer&#151;a worthy successor, by virtue both of his learning and his principles, of such predecessors as Coke and Hale and Holt&#146;  (Holdsworth, <span class="italic">Eng. law</span>, 10.672). But a cynical view more recently propounded is that Camden's legal opinions were delivered to accord with Chatham's political views. Certainly in parliament he faithfully followed Chatham's views on Wilkes and America, and a town in Maine, USA, was named after him in 1791. His loyalty to Chatham, too, was tempered by a propensity, evinced in 1761 and 1768, to cling to office after Chatham had resigned. Altogether he served fifteen years in cabinet, under five different premiers.<br>
<br>In appearance Camden was a small, well-made man, with a pleasant face. He eschewed the vices of lechery and gambling characteristic of his time, but had a reputation for physical laziness and gluttony. His modes of relaxation were music, the theatre, romantic fiction, conversation, and food: that he was an epicure is shown by his scathing criticism of French cuisine, after a visit to France in 1783, for the use of sauces to disguise the poor quality of the meat. Camden, a younger son of a second marriage, died a man of wealth, derived from his legal career and his wife's inheritance, which included the area of London later known as Camden Town.<br>
