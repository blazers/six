<span class="headword">Agar,  Augustus Willington Shelton</span>  (1890&#150;1968), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born in Kandy, Ceylon, on 4 January 1890, the son of John Shelton Agar, an Irish tea planter from co. Kerry. He was the youngest of thirteen children, and his Austrian mother, whose maiden name was Cruwell, died shortly after his birth. He was sent to England when he was eight years old. He was educated at Framlingham College, Suffolk, and at Eastman's naval academy, Southsea, Hampshire, and entered the training ship <i>Britannia</i> as a cadet in May 1905.<br>
<br>In September 1906 Agar was appointed midshipman to the battleship <i>Prince of Wales</i>, with the Mediterranean Fleet. Successive appointments as midshipman to battleships followed. In January 1910 he was promoted sub-lieutenant, and he continued training and examinations at Portsmouth and at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich. In April 1911 he joined the destroyer <i>Ruby</i>, with the Home Fleet. In June 1912 he was promoted lieutenant, and in April 1913 he attended the Central Flying School at Upavon, where he gained his pilot's licence.<br>
<br>In August 1913 Agar was appointed to the battleship <i>Hibernia</i>, which formed part of the 3rd battle squadron, the Grand Fleet, at the outbreak of war in August 1914. In 1915 <i>Hibernia</i> was deployed to the Dardanelles, and ultimately covered the Gallipoli evacuations in January 1916. In December of that year Agar joined the old cruiser <i>Iphigenia</i>, which had been converted into a headquarters and repair ship for minesweeping trawlers covering the approaches and supply routes to Murmansk and Archangel in north Russia. <i>Iphigenia</i> arrived at Busta Voe in late February 1917, remained on station for a year, and returned to Chatham in February 1918.<br>
<br>By May 1918 Agar was operating from Osea Island, Essex, with a flotilla of light coastal motor boats (CMBs), armed with torpedoes or mines and capable of nearly 40 knots. After the armistice he was employed by the Admiralty, in conjunction with the Foreign Office and MI5, on intelligence duties against Bolshevik Russia. Operating as agent ST 34 he contacted other British agents in Helsinki. Communications were maintained by two 40 foot CMBs based at Terijoki, near the Finnish border and 25 miles by sea from St Petersburg. Agar's CMBs ran a courier service to and from St Petersburg, linking with British agents who included ST 25, Paul Dukes, who became famous after he published a book about his experiences.<br>
<br>Agar participated in more orthodox naval operations with units of the Baltic fleet commanded by Rear-Admiral Sir Walter Cowan. On the night of 17 June 1919 Agar penetrated Kronstadt harbour in CMB 4 and sank the 6650 ton Bolshevik cruiser <i>Oleg</i> with a single torpedo. The CMB's three-man crew were decorated, Agar himself being awarded the Victoria Cross. He resumed his courier duties but also, on the night of 18 August 1919, participated in operation RK, the raid by eight CMBs on Kronstadt. This brilliant but hazardous action resulted in the sinking of two Bolshevik battleships and a submarine depot ship. All the CMB crews were decorated; two VCs were awarded and Agar received the DSO.<br>
<br>In September 1919 Agar returned to England, and in January 1920 he was again posted to Osea Island. On 20 July 1920 he married Mary Frances Katherine Petre, seventeenth Baroness Furnivall (1900&#150;1968), daughter of Bernard Henry Philip Petre, fourteenth Baron Petre. In September he was appointed to the cruiser HMS <i>Chatham</i>, New Zealand station, and promoted lieutenant-commander. In December 1923, after his return to England, he was appointed to the royal yacht <i>Victoria and Albert</i> for two years, and promoted commander in December 1925. In April 1926 he was appointed to the destroyer <i>Witch</i>, division leader of the third destroyer flotilla, Mediterranean Fleet, commanded by Admiral Sir Roger Keyes. In September 1927 he attended the Royal Naval Staff College, Greenwich, followed by a course at the Army Staff College, Camberley. He also separated from his wife, who initiated divorce proceedings. The couple were formally divorced in 1931. In January 1930 he was selected as naval adviser to the high commissioner for New Zealand, who was attending the London naval conference, and in September he was appointed to command the new sloop <i>Scarborough</i> on the North American and West Indies station, for a three-year commission. In February 1932 he married Ina Margaret Lindner in Bermuda.<br>
<br>Agar returned to England in 1933, and in October attended the senior officers' war course at Greenwich. Having been promoted captain in December 1933 he undertook a short course at the tactical school at Portsmouth, and then studied at the Imperial Defence College for a year. His next seagoing appointment was to the anti-aircraft cruiser <i>Curlew</i>, in January 1936. The following January he was appointed to the cruiser <i>Emerald</i>, his favourite ship, which sailed in June from Chatham to the East India station, and returned in July 1938. The ship was prepared for the Reserve Fleet, a process briefly interrupted by the Munich crisis in September 1938. Agar remained on <i>Emerald</i> for six months, and was next appointed captain of the Royal Naval College, Greenwich.<br>
<br>In July 1939 Agar was reappointed to <i>Emerald</i>, joining the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow in August. After the outbreak of the Second World War, on 3 September, the ship was assigned to the northern patrol, to carry out blockade duties against Nazi Germany. In October, with her sister ship <i>Enterprise</i>, she transported 5 tons of gold bullion from England to Nova Scotia, to pay for war materials. She was subsequently deployed on gruelling Atlantic convoy duties during the harsh winter of 1939&#150;40. In June 1940 Agar was appointed to command the sixteenth destroyer flotilla at Harwich, escorting coastal convoys. A succession of shore appointments followed, culminating in his appointment as chief staff officer, coastal forces.<br>
<br>In August 1941 Agar was made captain of the cruiser <i>Dorsetshire</i>, which was deployed to the south Atlantic on search and escort duties. After Japan's invasion of Malaya on 8 December <i>Dorsetshire</i> was engaged in various duties, including escorting the last convoys from doomed Singapore and Rangoon (which fell on 15 February and 8 March 1942 respectively). On 5 April she and the cruiser <i>Cornwall</i>, ordered to rendezvous with Admiral Sir James Somerville's Eastern Fleet, were caught and sunk in the Indian Ocean by a powerful force of Japanese naval dive-bombers. This was Agar's last seagoing command; in 1943 he was declared unfit for further active sea service. Placed on the retired list, he was offered, as commodore, the combined office of president and captain of the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, a position that he held until 1946. In retirement he took up farming at Alton, Hampshire.<br>
<br>Agar never achieved flag rank. He states in his biography, <span class="italic">Footprints in the Sea</span> (1959), that he was not driven by ambition, and his divorce may have led to prejudice in certain quarters. Yet he epitomized the &#145;sea dog&#146; of British naval tradition: honourable, extremely brave, and totally dedicated to king, country, and the Royal Navy. He was appointed a younger brother of Trinity House (1936) and vice-president of the Sailors' Home and Red Ensign Club (1957); his clubs included the Athenaeum and the Royal Yacht Squadron (naval member). He died at his home, Anstey Park House, Alton, on 30 December 1968. He had at least one stepdaughter, who registered his death.<br>
