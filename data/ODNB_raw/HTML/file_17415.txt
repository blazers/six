<span class="headword">MacCurtin,  Andrew</span> <span class="st"> [Aindrias Mac Cruit&iacute;n]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1670&#150;1738), <span class="occ">poet and scribe</span>, was born in the townland of Moyglass, about 5 miles south of Milltown Malbay, in the parish of Kilmurry, co. Clare. His father, Roland Mac Cruit&iacute;n, is reputed to have been a prosperous farmer but nothing else is known about his immediate family. MacCurtin's work displays a familiarity with older forms of the Irish language and with the syllabic metres employed by the professional bardic poets of earlier centuries&#151;suggesting that his education included elements of the curriculum of the bardic schools which had disappeared in the early seventeenth century. This is consistent both with the cultural conservatism of Clare, a region which was partially sheltered from the rapid social change that affected most of Ireland in the seventeenth century, and also with the MacCurtins' status as members of the hereditary learned caste of medieval Ireland.<br>
<br>The MacCurtins had acted as hereditary antiquaries to the O'Briens, lords of Thomond, since the fourteenth century, a role which had evolved into that of scribes and notaries by the early seventeenth century. Andrew MacCurtin maintained the scholarly tradition of his ancestors by establishing a school in his native parish, where he appears to have resided throughout his life. The extant manuscripts in his hand contain copies of several long texts, including devotional works such as Geoffrey Keating's <span class="italic">Tr&iacute; Bior-Ghaoithe an Bh&aacute;is</span> and <span class="italic">Eochair Sgiath an Aifrinn</span>; linguistic works such as M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh's <span class="italic">Focl&oacute;ir n&oacute; Sanas&aacute;n Nua</span> and Hugh MacCurtin's <span class="italic">Elements of the Irish Language Grammatically Explained in English</span>; and historical works such as <span class="italic">Caithr&eacute;im Thoirdhealbhaigh</span> and Geoffrey Keating's <span class="italic">Foras Feasa ar &Eacute;irinn</span>. The fact that at least five copies of the last work survive in MacCurtin's hand leaves little doubt that he supplemented his income from teaching by copying manuscripts. MacCurtin wrote a modernized version of <span class="italic">Beatha Shean&aacute;in</span>, the life of St Sen&aacute;n, and a holograph copy (St Patrick's College, Maynooth, MS C41) dating from 1721 was the exemplar used by several later scribes.<br>
<br>More than forty of MacCurtin's poems are extant. Several are written in the older syllabic metres and extol the virtues or lament the deaths of members of the co. Clare gentry, particularly the O'Briens of Leamaneh and Ennistimon, the MacDonnells of Kilkee, and the O'Loghlens of Burren. A <i>duanaire</i> or compendium of encomiastic verse (Royal Irish Academy, MS E iv 3) that MacCurtin wrote for one of the O'Loghlens in 1727, contains poems by himself and other authors, and is one of the last such volumes to have been compiled.<br>
<br>While Andrew MacCurtin's <i>&#339;uvre</i> is not as politicized as that of his relative, fellow poet, and contemporary Hugh MacCurtin, a composition which begins &#145;<i>Ar mbeith sealad domhsa in aicis mh&oacute;r cois taoide</i>&#146; and appears to date from 1718&#150;19 is an early example of a Jacobite <i>aisling</i> or vision poem, a genre which became popular with Munster poets from the middle of the eighteenth century onwards. Another of his political poems, the work beginning &#145;<i>Go c&uacute;ig roimh luis d&aacute; dtugadh gr&aacute;saibh D&eacute;</i>&#146;, has been dated to 1735 and is noteworthy for its prediction that an invasion of Britain would take place in 1745. But MacCurtin's best-known poem is probably a more personal composition beginning &#145;<i>Beann&uacute; doimhin duit, a Dhoinn na Duimhche</i>&#146; in which the aged poet appealed to Donn, the fairy king of a range of sandhills in west Clare, for hospitality at a time when no patronage was forthcoming from members of the gentry.<br>
<br>The date of MacCurtin's death is given as 1738 in a manuscript  (TCD, MS H.6.11, 23) written in 1754, and this seems more likely than the alternative date of 1749 which is mentioned in later sources. He was buried in Kilfarboy churchyard, near Milltown Malbay, and was lamented by Hugh MacCurtin in a poem beginning &#145;<i>N&iacute; buan br&oacute;n go b&aacute;s ollaimh</i>&#146;.<br>
