<span class="headword">Payne, Sir  Peter</span>, <i>de jure</i> third baronet  (1763&#150;1843), <span class="occ">radical</span>, was born at Blunham House, Bedfordshire, in February 1763, the third son of Sir Gillies Payne, second baronet, of Tempsford, Bedfordshire. His grandfather Sir Charles (<i>d</i>. 1746) had inherited from his wife a large property in St Kitts, West Indies, and had been created a baronet on 31 October 1737.<br>
<br>Sir Gillies Payne (<i>d</i>. 1801) was high sheriff of Bedfordshire in 1771. He formed in his youth a liaison with Maria Keeling, daughter of a farmer at Potton, Bedfordshire, but delayed marriage with her until the death of his mother in 1761. Peter was the first child born subsequently. Nevertheless on the death of his father in 1801 he allowed his elder brother, John, to succeed to the title, and, when John died two years later, acted as guardian to his young children. It was not until 1828 that Payne, having vainly offered to submit his claims and those of his brother's heir to a court of arbitration, was induced to allow the matter to be raised incidentally in the chancery suit <i>Glascott v. Bridges</i>. In the course of the trial Sir John's widow made affidavit that she and her sister had burned the marriage certificate of Sir Gillies, but evidence brought forward convinced the court of its existence, and Sir Peter was declared the eldest son born in wedlock. This decision was however reversed by the lord chancellor in January 1829, and an issue was directed to be tried as to the legitimacy of John and Peter Payne. The question never again came before the courts, but during his lifetime Sir Peter's claim to the baronetcy was acknowledged. He refused, however, to register himself as a baronet.<br>
<br>Payne was educated at Hackney and at Queens' College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1784 and MA in 1787. A handsome youth, though delicate, he took an active part in field sports, was a captain in the Bedfordshire militia, and was a deputy lieutenant for the county for more than half a century. In politics he was a strong whig, and he exerted much political influence in the midlands. In 1810 he published two pamphlets, entitled respectively <span class="italic">England the Cause of Europe's subjugation, Addressed to the British Parliament</span>, and <span class="italic">The Character and Conduct of British Ministers in War and Negotiation Illustrated by Facts</span>. In 1812 he attacked Pitt and attempted to convict Wilberforce of inconsistency in <span class="italic">Mr. Pitt the grand political delinquent; with a dedication to the solemnisers of his birthday, and an address to Wm. Wilberforce, esq., M.P</span>. In the same year he issued at Birmingham, under the pseudonym &#145;Philagathos&#146;, <span class="italic">Seven short and plain letters to the inhabitants of Birmingham on the leading points connected with the orders in council</span>.<br>
<br>Payne was intimate with the political reformer Major John Cartwright, for whom he stood bail when Cartwright was charged with sedition in August 1819. Among other friends were Sir Herbert Taylor and Dr Samuel Parr. In 1819 Payne published at Birmingham a <span class="italic">Letter to Lord Erskine in Defence of the Whigs</span>. On 5 May 1831 he was returned, with Lord Tavistock, as a whig member for Bedfordshire, but he retired at the dissolution in December 1832. He printed at Bedford in 1832 a pamphlet advocating repeal of the corn laws. He was also a strong opponent of the slave trade, and an advocate of higher education for women. In favour of the latter cause he wrote a pamphlet, which was published in 1811, under the title <span class="italic">Trial between the governess of a ladies' boarding school and the mother of a pupil committed to her charge</span>.<br>
<br>Payne married, in August 1789, Elizabeth Sarah, the only daughter of Samuel Steward of Stourton Castle, Staffordshire; they had two sons and four daughters. She died on 12 April 1832. Their grandson, Charles Robert Salusbury Payne, claimed the baronetcy in 1893, but the claim was not recognized. Sir Bernard Burke, after giving particulars of the separate claims in the editions of his <span class="italic">Peerage and Baronetage</span> between 1868 and 1878, thenceforth ignored the title. Foster's <span class="italic">Baronetage</span> of 1882 relegates it to the appendix &#145;Chaos&#146;. Payne died at Blunham House, Bedfordshire, on 23 January 1843.<br>
