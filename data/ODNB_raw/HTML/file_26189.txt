<span class="headword">Spurstowe,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1666), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was the son of William Spurstowe, a citizen and mercer of London, whose family had moved there from Shropshire; he had a brother, Henry, perhaps the Henry son of William baptized at St Stephen, Coleman Street, on 6 February 1613. He was admitted a pensioner at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1623, graduated BA in 1627 (incorporated at Oxford 1628), and proceeded MA from St Catharine's College in 1630. In August 1637, following the death of Egeon Askew, he began to officiate in the parish of Great Hampden, Buckinghamshire, and on the presentation of John Hampden, was installed as rector on 30 June 1638. That year he was also elected fellow of St Catharine's College, Cambridge, a puritan stronghold.<br>
<br>With Stephen Marshall, Edmund Calamy, Thomas Young, and Matthew Newcomen, Spurstowe was one of the co-authors of the anti-episcopal tract <span class="italic">Smectymnuus</span> (1641), a pamphlet defended by John Milton; the initials of his name provided the last letters (uus) of the authorial acronym [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94600', "Smectymnuus")</script>]. He was elected to the Westminster assembly, as a representative for Merioneth, on 25 April 1642. He served as chaplain to his patron John Hampden's regiment of foot, the &#145;green coats&#146; in Essex's army, a regiment mainly recruited in Buckinghamshire, and was paid from 30 July to 30 September 1642. In 1643 he preached at Hampden's funeral. He resigned from Great Hampden that year and was installed on 3 May as rector of Hackney, Middlesex, succeeding Calybute Downing. With the other Smectymnuuans he was included in the original summons (12 June 1643) to the Westminster assembly of divines, and took the solemn league and covenant the following September.<br>
<br>Spurstowe preached four or five parliamentary fast sermons and thanksgiving sermons including one delivered on 21 July 1643 and published as <span class="italic">Englands Patterne and Duty</span>, in which he assessed the monthly fast programme. Preaching before both houses of parliament, he admonished them that fasting had not been sufficiently effective, &#145;our teares have not been reforming teares&#146;  (p. 17). On 5 November 1644 he preached to parliament in commemoration of the Gunpowder Plot, timely enough as it also celebrated the delivery by parliamentarian forces of Newcastle and Tynemouth Castle. In that sermon, published as <span class="italic">Englands Eminent Judgements</span> (1644), he urged England to remember God's deliverance in both instances:<blockquote>Oh let it never be said that Englands Nobles, Governours and people, who have enjoyed <i>such a deliverance as this</i>, have been careless in preserving its memory; and that in a small tract and revolution of time, all that remaines of it, is like the writing upon some old monument that is wel-nigh worne out, of which little is to be read or knowne. It is a deliverance upon the had of which may be truly written: <i>such</i> as the present age may admire; <i>such</i> as posterity will scarcely believe; <i>such</i> as story cannot parallel. And therefore ought the memory of it to be deare unto every one,</blockquote>but he also warned the House of Lords to guard against popery and sectarianism, and urging further zeal &#145;in suppressing of those monstrous births of opinions which every day multiply&#146;  (pp. 10&#150;11, 27). Spurstowe also preached parliamentary fast sermons on 24 June 1646 and 25 August 1647, and several of his fast sermons were printed. He was approved as master of Clare College, Cambridge, on 22 April 1645 but this office was given to Ralph Cudworth. In 1645 he succeeded Ralph Brownrigg (who was deprived) as master of St Catharine's, but continued to serve as rector of Hackney. In or before 1644 he married Sarah, whose other name is unknown. A son, William, was baptized at Hackney on 7 November that year. Spurstowe was a member of the provincial assembly of London (1647) and at its first meeting (3 May 1647) was placed on its committee; he served on the eighth London classis, with Thomas Manton.<br>
<br>Acting as a commissioner to Charles I during negotiations on the Isle of Wight (September&#150;November 1648), Spurstowe strongly opposed the trial and execution of the king, and in opposition he signed <span class="italic">A Vindication of the Ministers of the Gospel in, and about London</span> at the end of 1648. With the establishment of the Commonwealth, he refused to take the engagement, and as a result in 1650 was deprived of his mastership of St Catharine's, which in November was given to John Lightfoot. On 30 October 1653, when the Independents sought assistance against the Fifth Monarchists, Spurstowe preached at St Paul's to the aldermen of London and the new lord mayor, Thomas Viner; the sermon was published as <span class="italic">The Magistrate's Dignity and Duty</span> (1653). Taking as his text <span class="roman">Psalm 82</span>, verse 2, he warned against the dangers of a &#145;self-seeking Magistrate&#146; as well as against the &#145;Monster of <i>Anarchie</i>&#146;  (pp. 2, 16), referring to the dangers of the millenarian faction in the Barebone's Parliament, and to the example of German Anabaptists. He was assistant to the Middlesex commission of triers and ejectors in 1654. Gradually reconciled to the regimes of the 1650s, like other leading presbyterians he supported Richard Cromwell. He was appointed commissioner for the approbation of ministers in March 1660, a committee disbanded that April with the Convention Parliament.<br>
<br>On 22 April Spurstowe preached a sermon at Hackney in favour of the king's restoration, urging from <span class="roman">Psalm 2</span>:12, &#145;Kiss the Son, lest he be angry&#146;, and quoting <span class="roman">Zechariah</span> 9:9, &#145;Behold thy King cometh unto thee&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1659&#150;60</i>, 420). On 11 May he set off for the Netherlands in a delegation which included Calamy, to meet with Charles II and negotiate over comprehension for presbyterians and the king's return. Like nine or ten leading presbyterians, Spurstowe became chaplain-in-ordinary to Charles II, and he once preached before the king. Samuel Pepys records on 6 October 1660 hearing Spurstowe preach to the king &#145;a poor dry sermon&#146;  (Pepys, 1.260). Spurstowe took part in the Savoy conference (April&#150;July 1661), which under a royal commission attempted to bring together episcopalian and presbyterian ministers to settle the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. Supporters of episcopacy and presbyterianism each had twelve representatives, but the orthodox, led by Bishop Gilbert Sheldon, overcame the presbyterians, led by Richard Baxter, conceding only a few of their recommendations, including the requirement of the Authorized Version of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> at all readings. When the conference failed so too did the cause of comprehension and a wider national church.<br>
<br>When the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> became effective in August 1662, Spurstowe resigned his living in Hackney, in which he was succeeded on 22 September by Thomas Jeamson. Henceforth he lived in retirement in the parish, where Baxter spent a week visiting while preparing the answer to the episcopal defence of the prayer book. Spurstowe visited Cambridge in 1664 and dined at St Catharine's. Baxter describes him as an &#145;ancient, calm, reverend minister&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 3.97), while Edmund Calamy (1671&#150;1732) spoke of his charity and the agreeableness of his conversation  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Spurstowe established six almshouses for six poor widows at Hackney, with endowment from his brother and heir, Henry, who had become a London merchant and alderman and had married Susanna Renoler at St John's in 1646. Spurstowe also published two substantial prose tracts, a religious meditation, <span class="italic">The Spiritual Chymist</span> (1666), and a fiery admonishment, <span class="italic">The Wiles of Satan</span> (1666). Having survived the plague he died suddenly in Hackney in 1666. The ejected minister Thomas Woodcock, who also lived at Hackney, recorded among his papers that Spurstowe and William Bates were persuaded:<blockquote>to take the Oxford oath at the Sessions &hellip; before Judge Keeling, who told them that took it they were now forsworn if ever they kept meetings and did not conforme. This confounds them all, but God prevented this. Honest Dr. Spurstow dyed sudainly the night before. (<span class="italic">Camden Miscellany</span>, 74)</blockquote>He died intestate, and was buried at Hackney on 8 February 1666. His only child, William, had died at Hackney in March 1654 at the age of nine; Simeon Ashe had preached the funeral sermon. Spurstowe's widow, Sarah, married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27794/', "Anthony Tuckney (1599&#150;1670)")</script> on 30 September 1668. Having been granted administration of Spurstowe's estate, valued at &pound;600 a year, she was still involved in chancery proceedings over it in 1675.<br>
<br>Spurstowe's life shows the trials of presbyterianism through the currents and shifts of the civil war, Commonwealth, and Restoration eras, as he sought a brace against disorders within the church and state while attempting to reform the moral character of the nation, its leaders, and its king. Author of polemics, writing and publishing sermons and devotional works, and active in his ministerial duties, working with eminent presbyterian leaders, Spurstowe sought a middle course of reform for the nation. A fanciful fiction appeared in London in 1847, <span class="italic">Tract entitled true and faithful relation of a worthy discourse, between Colonel John Hampden and Colonel Oliver Cromwell</span>, purporting to be a transcription by &#145;the Reverend William Spurstowe&#146;, and brought to light by George Nugent Grenville.<br>
