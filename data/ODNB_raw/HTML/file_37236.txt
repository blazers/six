<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Brunner, Sir  John Tomlinson</span>, first baronet  (1842&#150;1919), <span class="occ">chemical manufacturer and politician</span>, was born on 8 February 1842 in Everton, Liverpool, the second of the three sons and the fourth of the five children of John Brunner, a Swiss protestant minister, who migrated to Lancashire in 1832 and became a Unitarian and a schoolmaster, and his wife, Margaret Curphey, from the Isle of Man. Brunner's mother died in 1847 and in 1851 his father married Nancy Inman, who had run a successful school near Birkenhead. He was educated at his father's school, St George's House, Everton, until, at the age of fifteen, of his own volition, he decided to pursue a commercial career. The young Brunner had been greatly influenced by both his father's liberal Unitarian teaching and his affectionate stepmother's businesslike principles of household management.<br>
<br>Brunner spent four years at a Liverpool shipping house and then in 1861 obtained a clerical post at Hutchinson's alkali works in Widnes. During the next twelve years he rose to the position of general manager, in charge of finance and personnel, and during this time established a reputation in the business community for ability and honest dealing. Here, about 1862, he first met and befriended <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35065/', "Ludwig Mond")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51124/', "Mond family (per. 1867&#150;1973)")</script>], born at Kassel in 1839, a chemist educated at Heidelberg.<br>
<br>In 1864 Brunner married Salome, daughter of James Davies, a Liverpool merchant. She died in 1874 leaving a family of three sons and three daughters. In 1875 he married his children's governess, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1910), daughter of William Sanderson Wyman, a Kettering physician. They had three daughters.<br>
<br>The bond struck between Brunner and Mond, both ambitious men, was to endure. In 1873 they formed a partnership, born of mutual respect and trust, to manufacture soda ash at Winnington in Cheshire. Having little money they required financial backing and Brunner's high business reputation, no less than Mond's scientific eminence, was crucial for their success. After two years of grinding work they produced a small profit, which was to herald the creation of wealth unsurpassed in the British chemical industry of the nineteenth century. A managing partner from the start, Brunner was chairman of Brunner, Mond &amp; Co. from 1891 until 1918. When the company became a founder member of ICI in 1926 the enterprise, which had been launched in 1873 with less than &pound;20,000, had a capitalization of more than &pound;18 million.<br>
<br>In 1885 Brunner became Liberal MP for Northwich and held the seat, with one short break, until he resigned in 1909. His eldest son, John Fowler Leece Brunner, sat with him in the House of Commons from 1906. In the management of their chemical business Brunner and Mond were ahead of their times in introducing such socially enlightened measures as sickness and injury insurance, apprentice education, shorter working hours, and holidays with pay. As an MP Brunner could now promote his philanthropic principles through parliament. A supporter of home rule, trade unions, and free trade, he was an influential back-bencher and a prominent Liberal advocate, whose wide business experience informed his sometimes humorous but always cogent participations in debate. Before 1914 he earned himself obloquy in some quarters by urging a less provocative British stance towards Germany. He was created baronet in 1895 and sworn of the privy council in 1906. He declined several offers of a peerage.<br>
<br>Brunner was a generous benefactor. In Cheshire alone he provided schools, guildhalls, and social clubs, and he gave Northwich a free library. He endowed three chairs at Liverpool University and funded many scholarships. His benefactions included gifts to the Landesmuseum in Z&uuml;rich and a hospital, now the Spital B&uuml;lach, for the town of his father's birth in canton Z&uuml;rich. In the political field he supplied munificent financial support to the Liberal Party and its numerous causes. Dubbed by <span class="italic">The Times</span> a &#145;chemical Croesus&#146;, he rejoiced in using his wealth for philanthropic ends. Brunner died on 1 July 1919 at his home, Silverlands, Chertsey, Surrey.<br>
