<span class="headword">Birks,  Thomas Rawson</span>  (1810&#150;1883), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and theologian</span>, was born on 28 September 1810 at Staveley, Derbyshire, the younger son of Thomas Birks, a tenant farmer of the duke of Devonshire. The family were Baptists, and after first attending the village school and then a boarding-school in Chesterfield, Birks was sent at the age of sixteen to the dissenting academy at Mill Hill, near London, where he later became an assistant master. Funds were provided to send him to Cambridge, and in 1830 he matriculated at Trinity College, having in the same year joined the Church of England. Three years later he won a scholarship and gained the chief English declamation prize for his oration &#145;Mathematical and moral certainty&#146;, earning high praise from William Whewell, the master of Trinity. In 1834 he took his BA as second wrangler and second Smith's prizeman and became a fellow of Trinity. In 1843 and again in 1844 he won the Seatonian prize for religious poetry.<br>
<br>Birks was ordained deacon in 1837 and priest in 1841, and for some years was tutor and then curate to Edward Bickersteth, the rector of Watton, Hertfordshire, and former secretary of the Church Missionary Society, whose memoir he compiled in 1851. In 1844 Birks resigned his Trinity fellowship to marry Bickersteth's eldest daughter, Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1820), and moved to Kelshall, Hertfordshire, as rector. There were eight children, of whom the eldest son, Edward Bickersteth Birks, also became a fellow of Trinity. Birks's first wife died in 1856, and on 17 May 1866 he married Georgina Agnes, daughter of Colonel Beresford and widow of Major James Douglas. He had just returned to Cambridge as incumbent of Holy Trinity Church, and soon became active in university affairs, giving <span class="roman">Bible</span> readings for both undergraduates and more senior members and preaching before the university on a number of occasions. He was a member of the board of theological studies and in 1867&#150;8 an examiner for the theological tripos. In 1871 he was appointed an honorary canon of Ely Cathedral.<br>
<br>Throughout his ministry Birks was a scholarly and wide-ranging apologist for evangelicalism, being the author of more than fifty books and pamphlets, many of them originally delivered as lectures. He was increasingly concerned to respond thoughtfully but critically to the theological, philosophical, and scientific challenges of his day, and this sometimes led him to adopt positions at variance with contemporary evangelical orthodoxy. At Watton he engaged in a close study of biblical prophecy and, like his rector and future father-in-law, became a convinced champion of the premillennial position. He expounded his views in a series of lengthy treatises, commencing with <span class="italic">First Elements of Sacred Prophecy</span> (1843) and <span class="italic">The Four Prophetic Empires</span> (1844), and he edited a volume of lectures by twelve Anglican clergy entitled <span class="italic">The Hope of the Apostolic Church</span> (1845).<br>
<br>Birks was a pioneer among evangelicals in seeking to provide answers to the doubts raised by biblical critics and scientists over the authority of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. In 1850 he published an edition of William Paley's <span class="italic">Horae Paulinae</span>; two years later his own <span class="italic">Horae evangelicae</span> defended the historicity and consistency of the gospel narratives, and this was followed by <span class="italic">Modern Rationalism and the Inspiration of the Scriptures</span> (1853), which rejected the dogma of absolute inerrancy. Even before Darwin's <span class="italic">Origin of Species</span> had appeared in 1859 Birks was tackling some of the issues highlighted by modern science in <span class="italic">The Treasures of Wisdom, or, Thoughts on the Connection between Natural Science and Revealed Truth</span> and <span class="italic">The Difficulties of Belief in Connexion with the Creation and the Fall</span>, both of which were published in 1855. As a riposte to <span class="italic">Essays and Reviews</span> (1859) he wrote <span class="italic">The Bible and Modern Thought</span> (1861), one of his most important contributions to theological debate, while in reply to J. W. Colenso and other <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> scholars he published <span class="italic">The Exodus of Israel</span> (1863) and <span class="italic">The Pentateuch and its Anatomists</span> (1869).<br>
<br>In common with most other Anglican evangelicals of the Victorian age Birks sought to maintain the protestant character of both the institutions of government and the established church and to warn against the inroads of Roman Catholicism and secular thought. Many of his lectures and articles in religious periodicals focused on these concerns, as did more substantial studies such as <span class="italic">The Christian State</span> (1847) and <span class="italic">Church and State</span> (1869), the second dealing in particular with the question of the disestablishment of the Irish church.<br>
<br>During the 1860s Birks developed his thinking on the nature of redemption and eternal punishment, first in <span class="italic">The Ways of God</span> (1863) and more especially in <span class="italic">The Victory of Divine Goodness</span> (1867). The latter book, while rejecting both universalism and annihilationism, denied that the wicked would suffer everlasting misery, but instead asserted that God's grace and mercy would compel them to acknowledge the divine goodness as displayed in a redeemed world. In the ensuing controversy Birks was widely criticized by other evangelicals for his novel views, notably by the Free Church of Scotland theologian R. S. Candlish, to whom he replied in <span class="italic">The Atonement and the Judgment</span> (1870). However, in November 1869 he considered it expedient to resign his position as an honorary secretary of the Evangelical Alliance, having held that office since 1850.<br>
<br>In 1872, following the death of F. D. Maurice, Birks was appointed Knightbridge professor of moral philosophy at Cambridge, a position he held until his death. Followers of Maurice protested that the selection of a pronounced evangelical for this post was a retrograde step, though ironically Maurice was dismissed from his chair at King's College, London, in 1853 for teaching a doctrine of eternal punishment not unlike that espoused in Birks's <span class="italic">The Victory of Divine Goodness</span>. His first course of lectures to undergraduates was published as <span class="italic">First Principles of Moral Science</span> (1873), and the following year his <span class="italic">Modern Utilitarianism</span> compared the systems of Paley, Bentham, and J. S. Mill. The evolutionary theories of Darwin and Herbert Spencer were assailed in three works: <span class="italic">The Scripture Doctrine of Creation</span> (1872), <span class="italic">Modern Physical Fatalism and the Doctrine of Evolution</span> (1876), and <span class="italic">Supernatural Revelation</span> (1879). Meanwhile his literary output in other fields continued unabated. In 1874, for example, his <span class="italic">Companion Psalter</span> appeared, containing 450 versions of the psalms (a quarter of them composed by Birks himself) and intended to supplement the hymnbooks of the day.<br>
<br>A succession of strokes from 1875 onwards compelled Birks to resign from Holy Trinity in 1877, but he did not significantly curtail his intellectual endeavours until a fourth stroke in 1880 caused lasting paralysis. Birks died at his Cambridge home, 6 Salisbury Villas, on 19 July 1883, and was survived by his second wife and several children from his first marriage. He was buried in Cambridge cemetery five days later.<br>
