<span class="headword">Cotton,  Jack</span>  (1903&#150;1964), <span class="occ">property developer</span>, was born at Edgbaston, Birmingham, on 1 January 1903, the third son of Benjamin Marcus Cotton and his wife, Caroline Josephine Rudelsheim. His father was an import&#150;export merchant with a flourishing trade in silver plate cutlery to South Africa, and treasurer of Birmingham's chief synagogue. Cotton was educated at King Edward VI's Grammar School, Birmingham, and afterwards in the Jewish house at Cheltenham College. At the age of eighteen he was articled to a firm of Birmingham estate agents, and subsequently passed the examinations of the Auctioneers' Institute. Against his father's wishes his mother lent him &pound;50, and on his twenty-first birthday he opened his own estate agency in Birmingham. He worked single-handedly as agent, auctioneer, rent collector, and typist until 1926, when he hired his first staff. Cotton married in 1928 Marjorie Rachel, daughter of Moss Mindelsohn. They had three sons and one daughter before separating in the 1940s.<br>
<br>In the early 1930s Cotton laid the basis of his fortune by acting as a middleman between farmers and speculative builders interested in suburban ribbon development around Birmingham. He also often acted for the builders in selling these houses. His first great development (undertaken with a Birmingham solicitor, Joseph Cohen) was the demolition of the grammar school in New Street where he had been a pupil, and its replacement with the office block called King Edward House. His redevelopment of the site of the Midland Conservative Club was another such scheme. Cotton and Cohen also led a syndicate which developed Birmingham's first block of luxury flats, Kenilworth Court, in 1935, but the market proved sluggish, and thereafter Cotton avoided residential developments. He became a rich man with a strong local reputation: when the Air Ministry needed a shadow armaments factory in the Birmingham area in 1938, it approached Cotton for help.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Cotton served in the Home Guard and was employed by the government in factory building. He was a British delegate of the World Jewish Congress in 1945, and visited the USA in the cause of Zionist emigration to Palestine. He was a benefactor of many Jewish charities, endowing chairs of architecture and fine arts at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and the chair of biochemistry at Israel's Weizmann Institute. He also gave &pound;250,000 to the zoological gardens in Regent's Park, and &pound;100,000 to the Royal College of Surgeons. He was nevertheless disappointed in his hopes of a knighthood.<br>
<br>Cotton moved to London after the war, living in a suite at the Dorchester Hotel on Park Lane, and operating in the London property market. After forming the City of Birmingham Real Property Company to redevelop blitzed sites in the midlands and elsewhere, he bought control in 1947 of a shell company with a quotation on the London stock exchange, Mansion House Chambers Ltd, and appointed his accountant as chairman. During the early 1950s he bought, sold, and reconstructed several property companies before consolidating his interests in 1955 in a company called City Centre Properties. Although he conceived and implemented all the deals, and was City Centre's major shareholder, he preferred to act through nominees and for many years kept off the boards of his companies. In 1958, at the insistence of institutional shareholders, he became chairman of City Centre.<br>
<br>Building restrictions imposed during the war were enforced until 1954, and Cotton made a fortune out of the shortage of office space. After he had built several office blocks for the civil service his schemes became so big that he could not finance them by himself. In 1955 he took Legal and General Assurance as a partner for a proposed &pound;7 million development of the Monico site in Piccadilly, and in the following year initiated a development partnership with Pearl Insurance. This type of arrangement was widely copied. Cotton was also the first developer to realize that pension funds were ideal partners for property companies because their investment managers could take a longer view than those in insurance companies, especially as their investments were tax-free. In the early 1960s Cotton undertook major developments in association with the pension funds of companies such as ICI, Imperial Tobacco, and Unilever.<br>
<br>In 1958&#150;9 Cotton launched a programme of developments in South Africa and the West Indies in which Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial, and Overseas) had a holding of 20 per cent. In 1959 City Centre took a half-interest in the $100 million scheme for the 59-storey Pan Am tower over Grand Central Station in New York. During 1960&#150;61 City Centre merged with Walter Flack's Murrayfield Properties and Charles Clore's City and Central Investments to create the biggest property company in the world, called City Centre, with a stock market valuation (somewhat inflated) of &pound;65 million. Cotton remained chairman.<br>
<br>Cotton's business methods proved inadequate for these new conditions. His staff had hitherto comprised only a few accountants, clerks, and typists who were seldom privy to his confidence. He kept the details of his deals in his head, or in a few files which were heaped on the spare bed in his suite at the Dorchester. After clashes with both Clore and institutional shareholders, Cotton relinquished City Centre's chairmanship in July 1963. His shares in the company (held by family trusts) were sold in November for about &pound;8.5 million to a consortium headed by Kenneth Keith and Sir Isaac Wolfson. A month after leaving City Centre's board in February 1964, Cotton died of heart disease at Frilsham House, New Providence, Nassau, in the Bahamas, on 21 March 1964.<br>
<br>In business Cotton was quick, sharp, calculating, and opportunistic. His private character was ebullient and noisy. He disliked solitude and drank heavily in his later years. Having always shunned publicity, he was the object of intense journalistic interest after 1955, and often treated as a new King Midas. His suite at the Dorchester was a gathering place from which his truer friends were gradually driven away by sly sycophants, who would ply him with drink and tempt him to indiscretions. His consuming interest in life was property development; although he collected Impressionist paintings, his inspiration was chiefly pecuniary. Apart from the potential profit, the governing criterion of his developments was size, and even when he employed an architect such as Walter Gropius the results were seldom pleasing. Having disfigured many prime sites in London, Cotton conceived a need to redevelop Piccadilly, and from 1960 brought forward a series of grandiose proposals which fortunately were rejected. His most enduring monuments are therefore eyesores like the Big Top complex in Birmingham or the shopping centre at Notting Hill Gate in London.<br>
