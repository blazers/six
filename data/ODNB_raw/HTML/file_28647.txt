<span class="headword">Waldef <span class="st"> [Waltheof]</span></span>  (<em>c.</em>1095&#150;1159), <span class="occ">abbot of Melrose</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49353/', "Maud, also called Matilda (d. 1131)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7208/', "David I")</script>], eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28646/', "Waltheof (d. 1076)")</script>, and her first husband, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25091/', "Simon (I) de Senlis, earl of Northampton and Huntingdon (d. 1111x13)")</script>. Maud's second marriage, to David, earl of Huntingdon, the future <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7208/', "David I, king of Scots")</script>, produced one child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12956/', "Henry (d. 1152)")</script>. The outlines of Waldef's career are clear, if imprecise. At their father's death, Waldef, his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25092/', "Simon (II) de Senlis")</script>, and his sister Matilda were not yet of marriageable age. His mother's second marriage brought Waldef into David's comital and then royal household, together with the much younger Ailred of Rievaulx (<i>d</i>. 1167) and Henry, but there were differences: Henry was witnessing charters by the age of six (<i>c</i>.1120) and Ailred early achieved household office. Waldef, however, was still simply &#145;the son of the queen&#146; <i>c</i>.1126&#150;1131, and witnessed only once in David's reign. About 1128&#150;1131 Waldef entered the remote Yorkshire house of Augustinian canons at Nostell (founded between 1113 and 1122) to escape, it was said, David's plan to make him a bishop. He quickly achieved minor office there, and then was made prior of Augustinian Kirkham, founded <i>c</i>.1122 by Walter Espec. On the death of Archbishop Thurstan of York in 1140, Waldef was the first to be proposed as his successor. Rejected by Stephen because of his relationship to David, Waldef figures prominently among those opposing the election of William Fitzherbert (<i>d</i>. 1154). In 1143, however, he abandoned his allies, house, and office to join the Cistercians at Rievaulx. In 1148 he was appointed abbot of Melrose (founded 1136), daughter house of Rievaulx. He died there on 3 August 1159, having refused, it is said, episcopal preferment.<br>
<br>Waldef's burial at Melrose was followed by miracles, a popular cult, demonstrations of incorruption at the opening of his tomb in 1170 and 1206, and a campaign for his canonization. Jocelin of Furness's life  (<span class="italic">Acta sanctorum</span>, Aug, 1) is virtually the only source. It was commissioned by Patrick, tenth abbot of Melrose (1206&#150;7), and completed by 1214. There had been an earlier, lapsed process for canonization, and an earlier, now lost, life by Everard, Waldef's companion at Kirkham and Melrose. Jocelin, who never knew Waldef, used Everard as his principal source to demonstrate the abbot's sanctity: the Bollandists later accepted Waldef's miracles and cult, but rejected his canonization (he has never been officially canonized). Jocelin's apologetic life is inevitably misleading. While Waldef associated with the great figures in the northern regular revival, he cannot be ranked with them. His spirituality was homely and his advancement was the consequence of his connections. The flight to Nostell was a fiction. David had early, strong, and continuing connections with Nostell; he was the associate of Thurstan and of Espec, who founded Kirkham and Rievaulx, and himself founded Melrose. Clearly the partner in Thurstan's policies, David had his own objectives in church and state as well, and Waldef's career is indicative here. So too, perhaps, is that of Ailred, like Waldef sent to Yorkshire, to become another apparently unexpected recruit to an Espec foundation. In life, Waldef was, according to Jocelin, an approachable and familiar spiritual father, but he was also the instrument of his stepfather's ambitions.<br>
