<span class="headword">Cumming,  Barbara Theresa</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Hildelith Cumming]</span>  (1909&#150;1991), <span class="occ">nun, printer, and musician</span>, was born on 15 December 1909 at 61 Thurleigh Road, Battersea, the third daughter of Frederick Mann Cumming (1869&#150;1931), a civil engineer's assistant, and his wife, Emma Georgiana Love (1868&#150;1935). Barbara was effectively an only child, as both her sisters died before she was born. She was educated at the county secondary school, Clapham (1920&#150;27) and at the Royal Academy of Music (1927&#150;31). A prize-winning student who gained diplomas and teaching qualifications in piano and elocution, she was appointed sub-professor for piano at the academy in September 1932. She relinquished this post in January 1933, on becoming resident music mistress at the Collegiate School for Girls, Wentworth, Bournemouth, a position that she retained until 1941.<br>
<br>Barbara Cumming first came into contact with the Oxford Group (later Moral Re-Armament) about 1930, and by 1932 was a fully committed member. She fell in love with another member but the leader of the group refused them permission to marry. Her first professional engagement as a pianist was in London, at the Wigmore Hall in April 1939. Beethoven and Brahms were her great loves, and she became well-known as a player of Brahms. In 1940 her school was evacuated to Llangollen; a Christmas spent at Le Bon Sauveur Convent, Holyhead, led to her conversion to Roman Catholicism. She entered Stanbrook Abbey, near Worcester, an enclosed community of Benedictine nuns, on 18 December 1941, at the age of thirty-two, and remained there until her death. She was named Hildelith after the second abbess of Barking.<br>
<br>Dame Hildelith became a full member of the community on 15 August 1946. Many of her monastic duties drew on her musical abilities. She was assistant organist from 1943 to 1979, and director of the choir and director of music from 1969 to 1982. She was cellarer from 1951 to 1955, with responsibility for the business side of the abbey and its properties, at a time of financial crisis for the community. To raise money she recommended the closure of the printing press, founded in 1876. Instead the abbess, Dame Elizabeth Sumner, appointed her printer, in November 1955, a post that she held with great distinction for thirty-five years.<br>
<br>The Stanbrook Abbey Press under Dame Hildelith quickly became one of the leading private presses, renowned for the quality of its book design and press work. She initially sought advice from printers and typographers, notably Jan van Krimpen, whose types were used in the majority of fine books from 1958 onwards. The combination of handmade papers and distinguished types, with the calligraphy and decorations of Margaret Adams, characterized much of Stanbrook's output. The press produced some eighty titles between 1956 and 1988, including Siegfried Sassoon's <span class="italic">The Path to Peace</span> (1960), the <span class="italic">Rituale abbatum</span> (1963), and Russell Flint's <span class="italic">The Lisping Goddess</span> (1968). Dame Hildelith herself wrote <span class="italic">The Stanbrook Abbey Press: Ninety-Two Years of its History</span>, which was published in 1970.<br>
<br>Dame Hildelith made a significant contribution musically at a time of transition to the vernacular liturgy. She was a founder member of the Panel of Monastic Musicians and edited several books, notably <span class="italic">The Stanbrook Abbey Hymnal</span> (1974). Appointed an associate of the Royal Academy of Music in 1984, she influenced the establishment of its pioneering postgraduate course in church music studies. It was her friendship with the musicologist, writer, and broadcaster Alec Robertson that led her to set up a memorial fund that provided a church-music scholarship at the Royal Academy of Music in 1988. She unified the apparently divergent worlds of typography and music: &#145;There is a strange affinity in their respective spheres between plainsong and typography, so that the deep study of one may enrich the understanding of the other&#146;  (Cumming, <span class="italic">Stanbrook Abbey Press</span>, 145&#150;6). To her, typography was &#145;silent song&#146;.<br>
<br>Dame Hildelith was a warm-hearted and generous person who made time for people and their requests; her enthusiasm and good humour are apparent in the spirit of joy that infused her work. Her gift for friendship brought her a wide range of contacts outside the community. She suffered a heart attack in 1982, and deteriorating health made large-scale printing projects impossible for the last eight years of her life. She died in Evesham Community Hospital on 19 April 1991, and was buried at Stanbrook on 23 April. She was a fine musician and a first-rate private press printer, but these achievements were expressions of her Benedictine vocation, to which she devoted the major part of her life.<br>
