<span class="headword">Crossman, Sir  William</span>  (1830&#150;1901), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born at Isleworth, Middlesex, on 30 June 1830, was the eldest son of Robert Crossman of Cheswick House, Beal, and Holy Island, Northumberland, and his wife, Sarah, daughter of E. Douglas of Kingston upon Thames. After education at Berwick upon Tweed grammar school and Mr Jeffery's at Woolwich, he entered the Royal Military Academy at the head of his batch in January 1847. He was commissioned second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 19 December 1848. After serving at Woolwich, he was employed on the organization of the Great Exhibition of 1851, and the next year was sent to Western Australia to superintend the construction of public works by convicts. He was a police magistrate there and visiting magistrate for the ticket-of-leave stations, being stationed principally at Albany in King George's Sound and at Perth. He was promoted lieutenant on 17 February 1854. He married at Albany, on 3 March 1855, Catherine Josephine (<i>d</i>. 1878), daughter of John Lawrence Morley of Albany; they had two sons and three daughters. His services were commended by the governor, but the Crimean War necessitated his recall in February 1856.<br>
<br>After employment at Aldershot and Chatham, Crossman served at the War Office under the inspector-general of fortifications, working on surveys and designs for new defences of dockyards and naval bases (nicknamed Palmerston's Follies). He designed several of the coastal defences of Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight, of Hilsea lines and the detached forts of the Gosport advanced line, of the Verne Citadel at Portland, and Scraesdon and Tregantle forts at Plymouth. Meanwhile he was promoted captain on 12 May 1858, and was a member of the committee on the equipment of coast batteries (January 1860). In December 1861 he went to Canada to help with military preparations at the time of the <i>Trent</i> crisis, and afterwards was secretary to the royal commission, led by Sir J. W. Gordon, on the defences of Canada, visiting every post on the frontier.<br>
<br>Between 1866 and 1870 Crossman was engaged by the Treasury to report on the legation and consular buildings in Japan and China, and to arrange for new buildings where necessary. In the course of his mission he secured for the Admiralty the site for a new dockyard at Shanghai; he accompanied both the naval expedition to Nanking (Nanjing) and Lingling in 1869 and the force of sailors and marines which was landed in Taiwan and at Swatow (Shantou) in 1868 and 1869. Varied service occupied him after his return to England. Promoted major on 5 July 1872 and lieutenant-colonel on 11 December 1873, he became assistant director of works for fortifications at the War Office on 1 April 1875, but on 6 September he joined a special commission appointed by the Colonial Office to inquire into the resources and finances of the western Griqua country, South Africa. He was made CMG in May 1877. From 1876 to 1881 he served as the first inspector of submarine mining defences and as member of the Royal Engineers committee for submarine experiments and stores, visiting all the defended harbours at home and some overseas. Under his auspices mines became an important part of harbour defence. During 1879 and 1880 he was also president of an important committee on siege operations, which conducted many experiments with a view to remodelling siege operations in line with improved artillery. In 1881&#150;2 he visited Esquimalt and various colonies and reported on their defences. On his return (July 1882) he was commanding royal engineer of the southern military district, but was absent in 1883 on a commission of inquiry with Sir George Smyth Baden-Powell into the financial condition of Jamaica and other West Indian islands. The report was published in March 1884, and in May he was made KCMG.<br>
<br>Crossman, who had been promoted brevet colonel on 11 December 1878 and colonel on 6 May 1885, resigned his command to stand for parliament. In June 1885 he was elected Liberal MP for Portsmouth. Rejecting home rule he joined the Liberal Unionists, and retained the seat until 1892. He retired from the army with the honorary rank of major-general (6 January 1886). In January 1883 he had succeeded to his father's estate in Northumberland, and was a JP and alderman for the county, and served as sheriff in 1894&#150;5 and as chairman of the River Tweed commission. He married in London, on 29 June 1899, Annie, eldest daughter of Lieutenant-General R. Richards, Bombay staff corps, who survived him. Crossman died at the Hotel Belgravia, in London, on 19 April 1901.<br>
