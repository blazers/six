<span class="headword">O'Conor,  Charles</span>  (1764&#150;1828), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and scholar</span>, was born on 15 March 1764 at Belanagare, co. Roscommon, the second of the six sons of Denis O'Conor (1732&#150;1804), landowner, and his wife, Catherine Browne, daughter of Martin Browne of Cloonfad, co. Roscommon. His grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20525/', "Charles O'Conor (1710&#150;1791)")</script> of Belanagare was a greatly esteemed scholar and collector of Irish manuscripts. In 1760 he had handed over Belanagare to his son Denis, and during his grandson's childhood he lived nearby at the Hermitage. The grandson was intended for the church and in 1779 he was sent to the Irish College in Rome, where he was ordained and received a doctorate in divinity, before returning to Ireland in 1789. While in Rome he developed his scholarly tastes by working on the Vatican manuscripts and was commissioned to search out Irish manuscripts in Italy for the Royal Irish Academy. Presentation to the parish of Kilkeevan (Castlerea) lay with O'Conor Don, the head of his family, and in 1792 O'Conor was installed as parish priest there. He initiated the building of the first Roman Catholic chapel in the town of Castlerea. In 1796 he published the first volume of a life of his grandfather, <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life and Writings of the Late Charles O'Conor</span>. It was an outspoken work, as well as a confused and inaccurate one, and he quickly suppressed it.<br>
<br>In 1788 the marquess of Buckingham, when he was lord lieutenant of Ireland, had promised O'Conor's grandfather a pension if he would give his manuscripts to the Royal Irish Academy. He wrote to his friend Charles Vallancey that he would bequeath them to the academy, but they passed to his second son, another Charles. However, O'Conor got his grandfather's books and papers. Buckingham did not forget the Irish manuscripts and in 1798 persuaded the family to give them to him, but against O'Conor's wishes. Eventually he too was persuaded, but so that he could continue his scholarly work on them it was arranged that he would accompany the manuscripts to Stowe in the guise of chaplain to the marchioness, Mary Elizabeth Buckingham. Initially his bishop gave him eighteen months' leave of absence from his parish and this was later extended, but by 1803 the bishop was referring to O'Conor as &#145;the late incumbent&#146;.<br>
<br>Life at Stowe was an escape for O'Conor from the grinding poverty of his flock at Castlerea and at least for a time moving among the great had its attractions. Besides this, O'Conor seems to have been very much attached to the Buckinghams. Several times the possibility of an Irish bishopric loomed&#151;Achonry twice (in 1803 and again in 1808) and Elphin (in 1810)&#151;but despite vigorous pressing by his family he disapproved of the methods of appointment and seems to have preferred the luxurious and scholarly life he led at Stowe. When the marchioness died in 1812 he lost his chapel, which returned to being a dressing-room, but by then he was well installed as librarian. The first marquess had built up a very large collection of important manuscripts and Sir John Soane was employed to remodel the library room into a magnificent gothick chamber.<br>
<br>Residence at Stowe not only gave O'Conor access to his grandfather's Irish manuscripts but also made it relatively easy for him to use those in the British Museum and the Bodleian. His work <span class="italic">Rerum Hibernicarum scriptores veteres</span> appeared in four volumes between 1814 and 1826. The first volume was devoted to a general survey of early Irish manuscripts, the others to the first edition in a Latin translation of the main Irish annals. O'Conor's scholarship was not equal to the task and by the later nineteenth century these volumes were no longer consulted, their value becoming historiographical. But for the first half of the nineteenth century their importance was considerable as the only gateway to early Irish history. The first volume, which revealed the existence of the early Irish manuscripts, included the first facsimile of the <span class="roman">Book of Durrow</span> and initiated the controversy, which raged through most of the twentieth century, as to which manuscripts are Irish and which Anglo-Saxon. In 1818 O'Conor published a catalogue of the manuscript collection at Stowe in two volumes: <span class="italic">Bibliotheca MS. Stowensis</span>. The manuscripts were sold to the fourth earl of Ashburnham in 1849. The fifth earl in turn sold them to the government in 1883, when they were divided: the Irish element went to the Royal Irish Academy, finally fulfilling the elder Charles O'Conor's promise of 1788, and the rest to the British Museum.<br>
<br>Because the O'Conors were one of the few Irish Roman Catholic landed families to survive the seventeenth-century confiscations, they were expected to, and did, take an active part in the effort to achieve Catholic emancipation. O'Conor's grandfather was a prolific pamphleteer in the cause and even his father, Denis, who had no taste for politics, played his part; his older brother Owen, who succeeded to the headship of the family and the title O'Conor Don, was also very active. In O'Conor's time the subject of greatest controversy was whether the government could be allowed a veto in the appointment of bishops. In 1810, just at the time when his family had begun a serious campaign to have O'Conor appointed bishop of Elphin, he published the first of a series of seven letters in which he took a different line on this matter from his family, the bishops, and most of the Irish Roman Catholic laity, by decrying papal influence in appointments. The pamphlets entitled <span class="italic">Columbanus ad Hibernos</span>, some of book size, appeared successively between 1810 and 1816. Only the first was anonymous; later he did not hesitate to subscribe himself &#145;Rev. C. O'Conor D.D.&#146;. The pamphlets involve lengthy disquisitions on Irish history, particularly in relation to the 1641 rebellion, where he took the side of Ormond and Clanricarde against Rinuccini, the papal nuncio. Such was the stir he created that John Douglass, vicar-general of the London district, his immediate ecclesiastical superior in England, withdrew his priestly faculties. And when he arrived in Ireland, to see about his publications and to work in Trinity College Library, John Troy, the archbishop of Dublin, did likewise. He appealed to the pope and eventually the interdict was lifted.<br>
<br>O'Conor remained at Stowe for the rest of his active life, but when, in 1827, senility set in, he was moved to a Dublin asylum and finally to his old home at Belanagare, where he died on 29 July 1828. He was buried with his ancestors at Ballintubber Abbey, co. Roscommon.<br>
