<span class="headword">Dimock,  James Francis</span>  (1810&#150;1876), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and historian</span>, second son in the family of three sons and five daughters of John Giles Dimock (1773&#150;1858), rector of Uppingham, Rutland, and his wife, Sarah (1781/2&#150;1851), daughter of William Humphries of Baldock, Hertfordshire, was born at Stonehouse, Gloucestershire, where his father owned land, on 22 November 1810. He was educated at Uppingham School under Dr Josiah Buckland, was admitted pensioner of St John's College, Cambridge, in 1829, and was elected Bell's scholar in 1830. He graduated BA as twenty-eighth wrangler in 1833, and MA in 1837. Having been ordained deacon (1836) and priest (1837) by the bishop of Lincoln, he published a commentary on the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> (1843) and a sermon on the holy communion (1844). In 1846 he was appointed minor canon of Southwell; he gave up the canonry in 1863 on his appointment as rector of Barnborough, near Doncaster, a living in the gift of Southwell collegiate church. In 1869 he was made prebendary of Lincoln, and he held the prebend with his rectory until his death. Dimock married in 1841 Caroline (<i>d</i>. 1890), daughter of John Tatam of Moulton, Lincolnshire, with whom he had eight sons and six daughters. He died at Barnborough on 22 April 1876, and was buried there on 26 April.<br>
<br>Dimock was deeply interested in ecclesiastical and medieval history; his earliest work was <span class="italic">Illustrations of the Collegiate Church of Southwell</span> (1854). In 1860 he published at Lincoln an edition of the <span class="italic">Metrical Life of St Hugh</span>, and in 1864 he edited for the <span class="roman">Rolls Series</span> the <span class="italic">Magna vita S. Hugonis, episcopi Lincolniensis</span> (1864). This was the first complete text of the life of St Hugh to be published and, although later superseded, Dimock's work received favourable notice from the editors of a subsequent standard edition (2 vols., 1985; eds D. L. Douie and D. H. Farmer). His most important work remains his edition of part of the works of Giraldus Cambrensis (Gerald of Wales) for the <span class="roman">Rolls Series</span>; the first four volumes were edited by J. S. Brewer, and volumes 5&#150;8, which appeared between 1867 and 1877, by Dimock. The edition was completed with an eighth volume by Sir G. F. Warner.<br>
