<span class="headword">Dalrymple, Sir  Adolphus John</span>, second baronet  (1784&#150;1866), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was born on 3 February 1784, probably at his parents' house, 29 Somerset Street, St Marylebone, Middlesex. He was the first child and eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7049/', "Sir Hew Whitefoord Dalrymple (1750&#150;1830)")</script>, army officer, and his wife, Frances, Lady Dalrymple (1753&#150;1835), daughter of Lieutenant-General Francis Leighton (1696&#150;1773) and his wife, Renea, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pinfold. At the time of his birth Dalrymple's father was a captain and lieutenant-colonel in the 1st regiment of foot guards. Adolphus was christened in March 1784 in the parish church of St Mary in Marylebone High Street, and was educated at Harrow School from September 1796 until the spring of 1799.<br>
<br>Dalrymple was connected by birth to both military and political society in southern Scotland. His father procured his first commission and his first promotion, and a family friend provided a safe and decorative posting. When his military career faltered, his father-in-law set him on a parliamentary career, one furthered by his family connections in East Lothian. Once out of parliament, sheer longevity secured him a steady progress to the rank of general.<br>
<br>On 25 October 1799 Dalrymple was gazetted ensign in the 55th (Westmorland) regiment of foot, the regiment having its headquarters on Guernsey, of which Sir Hew Dalrymple was lieutenant-governor. On 12 June 1800 he was promoted lieutenant in the 37th (North Hampshire) regiment of foot, of which Sir Hew was colonel. He served as aide-de-camp to his father, then a lieutenant-general, on Guernsey from being first commissioned until 5 February 1801, when he exchanged to the 1st (King's) dragoon guards.<br>
<br>Dalrymple served with the 1st dragoon guards in England until being appointed, in July 1802, aide-de-camp to Lieutenant-General Sir James Craig (1748&#150;1812), who was then commanding the eastern district of England. He obtained his captaincy in the 18th (light) dragoons on 7 January 1803 and served with that regiment in England until being reappointed aide-de-camp to Craig on 24 July 1803. On 19 May 1803 he and his younger brother, Leighton Cathcart Dalrymple&#151;a lieutenant in the 15th (King's) regiment of (light) dragoons&#151;served as esquires to Craig at his installation as a knight companion in the Order of the Bath. Dalrymple remained Craig's aide-de-camp until May 1806, serving with him in Malta, Sicily, and Naples as part of the force sent under Craig's command to reinforce the kingdom of Naples against France. In June 1806 he was appointed military secretary to his father, who had been ordered to Gibraltar as lieutenant-governor. He served with Sir Hew as military secretary on Gibraltar and in Portugal in 1808 when Sir Hew was appointed to command the British expeditionary force there. Following the armistice, or convention, agreed at Cintra at the end of August 1808, Dalrymple brought home his father's dispatches announcing the news to government. He obtained a majority in the 3rd (East Kent) regiment of foot (the Buffs) on 15 September 1808 and exchanged to the 19th (light) dragoons on 17 November 1808. He may have been stigmatized by his association with the convention of Cintra, and his father's subsequent disgrace, because he never saw active service again.<br>
<br>On 23 June 1812 he married Anne (1782&#150;1858), only daughter of Sir James Graham, bt, MP, of Kirkstall, Yorkshire (1753&#150;1825); they had no children. On 1 June 1814 he obtained a lieutenant-colonelcy in the 60th (Royal American) regiment of foot, soon afterwards transferring to the half-pay list of the 2nd garrison battalion; he remained on the half-pay list until 1841.<br>
<br>On 14 February 1817 Dalrymple began his parliamentary career, coming temporarily into parliament for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis with the assistance of his father-in-law. He lost his seat at the general election of 1818 but returned to the Commons on 5 April 1819 as member for Appleby, a borough of which his father-in-law was recorder. He represented Appleby until 1826, when he was elected to the Haddington burghs, a seat previously represented by his kinsman Sir Hew Hamilton Dalrymple (later Dalrymple Hamilton), bt (1774&#150;1834); he remained MP for Haddington until 1832. On 9 April 1830 he succeeded his father as second baronet and inherited the property at High Mark, Wigtownshire, that Sir Hew had inherited in 1753 from his father, Captain John Dalrymple (1692&#150;1753), late 6th dragoons. On 22 July 1830 he was promoted colonel and appointed aide-de-camp to William IV. Losing his seat in 1832, he was elected to represent Brighton in 1837 and appointed aide-de-camp to Queen Victoria, an appointment and seat which he retained until 1841. He left parliament in 1841 and was promoted major-general on 23 November 1841. On 11 November 1851 he was promoted lieutenant-general, and on 11 April 1860 general. As well as Delrow House and High Mark, which he inherited from his father, Dalrymple owned or occupied houses at 129 Park Street, Grosvenor Square, London, and in Brunswick Terrace, Brighton. He was also a founder member of the United Services Club. He died at Delrow House, Aldenham, Hertfordshire, on 3 March 1866, and was buried in the family vault in the churchyard of the church of St John the Baptist, Aldenham.<br>
