<span class="headword">Waismann,  Friedrich</span>  (1896&#150;1959), <span class="occ">philosopher</span>, was born on 21 March 1896 in Vienna, the son of Leopold Waismann (<i>d</i>. 1931), a manufacturer of hardware who was a naturalized Austrian of Russian origin, and his wife, Clara Schwarz (<i>d</i>. 1929). Having taken his <i>Matura</i> in 1917 as an external applicant, he entered Vienna University as a foreign student of Russian nationality. He took a degree in physics in 1922. In 1937 he received a doctorate for his philosophical publications.<br>
<br>From 1922 to 1936 Waismann had a precarious career under the patronage of Moritz Schlick, professor of philosophy and founder of the Vienna circle. He taught at the Volkshochschule, from 1929 he was librarian of the philosophy faculty, and he gave private tuition. Throughout he served as Schlick's unofficial assistant, running his graduate seminar.<br>
<br>Realizing that the conception of logic presented in the <span class="italic">Tractatus logico-philosophicus</span> was of fundamental importance to logical empiricism, Schlick made contact with Ludwig Wittgenstein in 1927. Schlick came to envisage a more accessible presentation of Wittgenstein's ideas, and assigned this task to Waismann. From 1928 Waismann's efforts centred on gathering and expounding Wittgenstein's ideas under Schlick's general supervision. Waismann acted as the spokesman for Wittgenstein's point of view (notably at the Second Congress for Scientific Philosophy at K&ouml;nigsberg in September 1930). Within the Vienna circle, Waismann sided with Schlick, who represented the conservative wing, against the radicals headed by Otto Neurath. The conservatives wanted the work of the circle to be politically neutral and to focus on the analysis of logic, mathematics, and the natural sciences, whereas the radicals urged active political engagement along Marxist lines, and directed attention to the social sciences. This split led to intellectual conflict and personal animosity.<br>
<br>From shorthand notes of conversations with Wittgenstein, supplemented by dictations and typescripts, Waismann wrote lectures and articles on Wittgenstein's conception of mathematics, his view of logic, and his treatment of identity and probability. The culmination was to be a systematic presentation of his ideas on logic, language, and philosophy. Advertised in 1930 under the title <span class="italic">Logik, Sprache, Philosophie</span>, this book was to be the initial volume in the series <span class="roman">Schriften zur Wissenschaftlichen Weltauffassung</span> (the series envisaged as a systematic exposition of the philosophy of the Vienna circle). Schlick wanted the book to give a perspicuous account of the conception of logic presented in the <span class="italic">Tractatus</span>, since he regarded that conception as the basis of logical empiricism. The project generated tension with Wittgenstein. He worried about its misrepresenting his current, rapidly evolving position. As a consequence he decided in 1932 to become co-author with Waismann, but then withdrew from co-authorship in 1934, promising to Schlick to continue to assist Waismann in the project.<br>
<br>Deprivation of the librarianship and Schlick's murder in 1936 made Waismann's position untenable. He desperately needed to publish to obtain a secure post. He compiled a collection of Schlick's later papers (<span class="italic">Gesammelte Aufs&auml;tze</span>, 1938). He completed <span class="italic">Einf&uuml;hrung in das mathematische Denken</span> (1936), which developed some of Wittgenstein's leading ideas into an overview of the nature of mathematics. He signed a contract with Springer in October 1936 to publish <span class="italic">Logik, Sprache, Philosophie</span>. Although it was finished in 1937, the text remained unpublished (probably because of the <i>Anschluss</i>). A second attempt to publish it in the Netherlands was frustrated by the outbreak of war.<br>
<br>Waismann went temporarily to Cambridge in October 1937. One term's funding was extended to two, whereupon the <i>Anschluss</i> made him a permanent refugee. This created awkwardness when Wittgenstein himself returned to Cambridge from leave in Norway, since Waismann's lectures, based on his own two completed texts, expounded Wittgenstein's earlier ideas. Wittgenstein did nothing to soften the difficulties, allegedly banning his students from attending Waismann's lectures. Waismann felt bitter and depressed.<br>
<br>In February 1940 Waismann moved to Oxford, where he remained permanently apart from a brief period of internment (as an enemy alien) at Paignton, Devon, from 22 July to 3 October 1940. Supported by funding for refugees and grants from Magdalen and All Souls colleges, he gave miscellaneous lectures. Eventually he became lecturer in the philosophy of science and mathematics in 1946, then successively senior lecturer (1948) and reader (1950) in the philosophy of mathematics, and finally reader in the philosophy of science in 1955. He took British nationality in 1950, and he was elected a fellow of the British Academy in July 1955.<br>
<br>Waismann had close contact with some leading Oxford philosophers&#151;especially Henry Price, Isaiah Berlin, Stuart Hampshire, Herbert Hart, and Gilbert Ryle. His lectures and classes were a focus of excitement. One seminar saw the first exposition by J. L. Austin of his doctrine of performative utterances. Having, like Ryle, &#145;learned much from Wittgenstein&#146;, Waismann played a leading role in the post-war transformation of logical empiricism into &#145;Oxford philosophy&#146;. In this way he was a protagonist in both main developments within analytic philosophy in his lifetime.<br>
<br>Outside Oxford, Waismann's reputation rested on three papers, subsequently reprinted in <span class="italic">How I See Philosophy</span> (ed. R. Harr&eacute;, 1968). &#145;Verifiability&#146; (1945) suggested modifications of the principle of verification to accommodate the essential indeterminacy of symbolism (&#145;open texture&#146;). This influential doctrine (prominent in Hart's legal theory) is that no empirical concept can be so precisely defined as to exclude all possible doubt about how it is to be applied in bizarre circumstances. &#145;Language-strata&#146; (1953) explored the &#145;loose&#146; logical relations between different domains of discourse (for example, between psychological concepts and descriptions of behaviour). &#145;How I see philosophy&#146; (1956) distinguished philosophical arguments from demonstrations of theses, instead illustrating how to treat philosophical problems on the model of psychoanalysis: the patient must be led to acknowledge his own difficulties and to view things in new ways.<br>
<br>All this work shows ambivalence towards Wittgenstein, deep indebtedness together with critical distance. Waismann built much on ideas that Wittgenstein later discarded (especially the concept of a &#145;hypothesis&#146;), and he directed Wittgenstein's method of clarifying &#145;the grammar of our language&#146; primarily to investigating changes in mathematical and scientific concepts where appeals to everyday use played no role.<br>
<br>There are major posthumous publications. Transcriptions of shorthand notes of Wittgenstein's conversations with Waismann and Schlick in 1929&#150;32 were published in 1967 as <span class="italic">Ludwig Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle</span>. Some later dictations and early drafts for <span class="italic">Logik, Sprache, Philosophie</span> were being prepared for publication at the end of the twentieth century. An English translation of that book was completed in 1939, at least partly by Margaret (Ramsey) Paul, but it was first published only in 1965 under the title <span class="italic">The Principles of Linguistic Philosophy</span>. This was presented (and misunderstood) as a secondhand rehash of Wittgenstein's work rather than the precipitate of seven years of co-authorship and collaboration. A reconstruction of the original German text appeared in 1970, with a fuller and more accurate account of its origins.<br>
<br>Other publications include <span class="italic">Philosophical Papers</span> (1977); <span class="italic">Lectures on the Philosophy of Mathematics</span> (1982), which was reconstructed from notes and manuscripts; and <span class="italic">Wille und Motiv</span> (1988; translated as <span class="italic">Ethics and Will</span>, 1994). Much remains unpublished: a book on the concept of causality, some early lectures and drafts of parts of <span class="italic">Logik, Sprache, Philosophie</span>, and a quantity of poems and aphorisms.<br>
<br>Waismann's wife, Hermine Antscherl (born in Vienna in 1894), whom he married in 1929, committed suicide in 1943. So too, nine years later, did his only son, Thomas (born in Vienna in 1935). Waismann died at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, on 4 November 1959.<br>
