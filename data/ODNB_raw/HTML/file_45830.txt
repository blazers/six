<span class="headword">Trye <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>O'Dowde]</span>,  Mary</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1675), <span class="occ">medical practitioner</span>, daughter of the physician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57248/', "Thomas O'Dowde (d. 1665)")</script>, took up her pen in 1674 to defend the reputation of her father, and so was one of the few early modern women medical practitioners to publish a book. The dedication of her <span class="italic">Medicatrix, or, The Woman-Physician</span> (1675), written to Lady Fisher of Packington Hall in Warwickshire, is dated 1 December 1674, and gives Trye's address as &#145;the Feathers&#146; in &#145;Old Pell-Mell&#146; near St James's. In it she says that she had moved to London from Warwick &#145;October last&#146;, where she became aware of the published attacks of Henry Stubbe on her father. Trye, like Stubbe, had practised in and around Warwick before moving to London, and she not only felt compelled to defend her father's reputation but to lambast Stubbe. Her father was not only a medical chemist but a well-born and loyal royalist who had lost his fortune during the troubles in Ireland of the 1640s, and who died during the plague of 1665. Trained by her father in medicine and medical chemistry she had continued to sell his medicines to the poor in Warwick &#145;more out of Charity then my private Interest&#146;. While she says little about herself, she does claim in the introduction to her book to be &#145;satisfied there is Ability enough in my Sex, both to discourse [Stubbe's] envy, and equal the Arguments of his Pen in those things that are proper for a woman to engage&#146;.<br>
<br>Apart from defending her father and attacking Stubbe, Trye mounts a defence of her medical views and remedies. Like most other medical chemists, she attacks the practice of phlebotomy. Like many of them, too, she declares that she esteems &#145;real Learning, and the Foundation, Promoters, and Doctors thereof&#146;, but that academic dress had too often become a shield for laziness and arrogance. Only in conjunction with the humility that comes from both practising among ordinary people and wrestling with nature in the laboratory could medical learning be perfected, she claims. Trye does quote from French sources, but has no citations from Latin or Greek, suggesting that she was no more academically educated than her father. It is clear, however, that Trye's book was in part intended to advance her own interests, for (like so many other medical tracts of the day) it concludes with an eight-page &#145;Advertisement of Dr. O'Dowdes Medicines, and the Authors&#146;.<br>
