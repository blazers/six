<span class="headword">Child,  Robert</span>  (1613&#150;1654), <span class="occ">physician and agriculturist</span>, was born in Northfleet, Kent, the son of John Child. His brother Major John Child was commander of a Kentish regiment, and was one of the commissioned officers who took part in the Kentish insurrection of 1648. Child matriculated at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, in 1628 and graduated BA in 1631/2 and MA in 1635. He also attended the universities of Leiden and Padua, graduating MD in 1638. He made two visits to New England, the first between 1638 and 1641, the second between 1645 and 1647. Between these two trips Child travelled across Europe visiting Spain, Flanders, Germany, and France, where he met the alchemist Pierre Jean Fabre. During his second visit to America, Child became involved in the ironworks of John Winthrop junior at Braintree and Lynn, New England. He advised Winthrop on metallurgical matters and became an investor in the Company of Undertakers of Iron Works in New England. After Winthrop was succeeded by Richard Leader as director of the company in 1645, Child helped run the ironworks.<br>
<br>Child was also a central figure in the Massachusetts remonstrance of 1646. As an ardent presbyterian he was critical of the Congregational administration of Massachusetts, and was one of the co-signatories of the remonstrance and humble petition which argued that a solemn league and covenant be imposed on its inhabitants to establish presbyterianism as a state religion. &#145;All things would prosper in this place&#146;, Child wrote in December 1645, &#145;if they would give liberty of Conscience&#146;. Child desired to see the colony &#145;better ordred in Church and Commonwealth&#146; and to this end he involved himself in an attempt to revoke the original Massachusetts charter. He incurred the displeasure of the president and in November 1646 was tried at open court, where he was accused of attempting to &#145;undermyne the libertyes of Gods people&#146;, defaming the government, and slandering the church, and was fined &pound;50 for refusing to retract his &#145;contemptuous speeches and behaviour&#146; towards the colony. After his trial Child prepared to sail back to England but was arrested in March 1647 after he was found in possession of compromising documents including a draft appeal to the English parliament. He was sentenced to a brief period of imprisonment by the general court on 9 June 1647 but was allowed to remain under house arrest in the home of his friend Leader. On his release some time before 27 October 1647, Child returned to England.<br>
<br>By May 1648 Child was lodging with a Dr Garbet in Hogsdon, near Gravesend, Kent, and busying himself with chemical experiments and medical practice. He was well known as an alchemist, possessed a personal library of over a hundred &#145;Chymicall books&#146;, and corresponded regularly with Winthrop and others on alchemical matters. Some contemporaries suspected that he was responsible for the influential alchemical tracts written under the pseudonym Eirenaeus Philalethes, but the actual author was his friend George Starkey, whom Child encouraged to emigrate from New England. On Starkey's arrival in 1650 Child introduced him to Robert Boyle and other chemists. In the same year Child, together with Thomas Vaughan, Thomas Henshaw, and William Webbe, proposed to establish a &#145;chymical club&#146; to collect, translate, and publish significant alchemical books and manuscripts and promote open communication of alchemical secrets. From 1641 until his death Child was a regular correspondent and then close associate of Samuel Hartlib in London. He was also an acquaintance of Elias Ashmole, whom he thought &#145;a very good &amp; publicke spirited man&#146;. Hartlib published letters from Child on agriculture in his <span class="italic">Legacy of Husbandry</span>, published between 1651 and 1655. Child advocated the systematic study of scientific agricultural methods and proposed schemes for state implementation of forest management and the cultivation of potatoes, flax, and hemp. Child left London to settle in Lisburn, co. Antrim, in Ireland in May 1651. On his arrival he began a botanical and entomological survey of the locality (sending specimens to his friend, a Mr Morgan, keeper of a &#145;kind of Botanicke garden&#146; close to Westminster Abbey, and an entomologist, Mr Marshall). Child encouraged innovation among the local farmers, recommending the settlement of Dutch experts on agriculture.<br>
<br>Child was actively involved in preparations for an extended edition of <span class="italic">Ireland's Natural History</span>, a preliminary survey by Gerard Boate, published by Hartlib in 1652. At first Child collaborated with Gerard's brother, Arnold Boate, but after the latter's death in 1653 Child became solely responsible. This ambitious project was still incomplete when Child died at Lisburn in the early part of 1654.<br>
