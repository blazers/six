<span class="headword">Ballard,  George</span>  (1705/6&#150;1755), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was baptized on 14 February 1706 at Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire, one of five sons and three daughters of Samuel Ballard (<i>bap</i>. 1663, <i>d</i>. 1710), a chandler, and his wife, Elizabeth Willis (<i>d</i>. 1744), a midwife. His father died, aged forty-six, in July 1710, when George was only four years old, but his mother lived for another thirty-four years, and died on 10 July 1744 at the age of seventy-three. Ballard was a sickly child, deemed unsuited for any trade which involved bodily strength. He was, as a consequence, apprenticed as a maker of female clothing and was thereafter referred to variously as a staymaker, tailor, habit-maker, or mantua-maker. Thomas Hearne, to whom Ballard was introduced in 1726 by Richard Graves, reported that his antiquarian interests were first aroused by &#145;the little historical twelve-penny pieces put out under the name of Richard Burton [Nathaniel Crouch], in which are abundance of pretty diverting delightfull stories, which have made the books to be in great vogue among the Vulgar&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 11.219). Both Ballard and his elder sister, Elizabeth (who, like their mother, was a midwife), developed early in life an absorbing interest in coins and books, and Ballard, &#145;stealing a few hours from sleep, after the business of the day was over&#146;  (Walker, 2.93), taught himself Old English. He further recorded that before reaching the age of fourteen he had read many of the polemical writers on religion who &#145;gave me the greatest abhorrence to Popery&#146; and &#145;almost as bad an opinion of the Dissenters&#146;  (ibid., 2.143&#150;4). He subsequently learned Latin and, according to Hearne, was by 1729 spending much of his time travelling about on foot, collecting coins, and, forsaking his trade, living &#145;chiefly upon his mother&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 10.118).<br>
<br>Ballard gradually built up a wide circle of correspondents including many of the foremost antiquaries of the day, and was admitted to read in the Bodleian Library on 9 December 1747. Three years later on the recommendation of the Revd William Talbot of Kineton, Warwickshire, and of Browne Willis, he was admitted to Magdalen College, Oxford, as one of the clerks on 1 November 1750 and was matriculated by the university on 15 December at the age of forty-four. Finances were provided by an annuity of &pound;100 offered by Lord Chedworth and the members of his hunt at Chipping Campden, though this was reduced to &pound;60 at Ballard's request.<br>
<br>Ballard wrote a historical account of Campden church in 1731 which was read to the Society of Antiquaries in 1771, but his principal literary work was his <span class="italic">Memoirs of Several Ladies of Great Britain, who have been Celebrated for their Writings or Skill in the Learned Languages, Arts and Sciences</span> (1752). The preface is dated at Magdalen College on 23 November 1752 and Edward Gibbon, who was there at that time, was one of the book's 400 subscribers, 143 of whom were women. The section of the work which covers the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is dedicated to the wife of the Revd William Talbot &#145;as a small testimony of gratitude for extraordinary favours&#146; conferred on Ballard by herself and her husband; the section covering later centuries is dedicated to Mrs Mary Delany, &#145;the truest judge and brightest pattern of all the accomplishments which adorn her sex&#146;.<br>
<br>Perhaps because of the nature of his trade Ballard was acquainted with many women in the Chipping Campden area, and he is credited with rescuing his fellow Saxonist Elizabeth Elstob from penury in Evesham by introducing her to another Gloucestershire acquaintance, Sarah Chapone, who succeeded in raising an annuity for her.<br>
<br>Ballard never married. He died on 24 June 1755 owing, according to John Nichols  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 2.470), to &#145;too intense application to his studies&#146;, though William Talbot in a letter to John Loveday on 2 July reported that &#145;the stone&#146; was the cause of his painful death  (Markham, 395). He was buried at Chipping Campden on 27 June. Nichols gives the text of a memorial in Latin, but bearing the date 1740, said to be from a monument erected in the church there. No other evidence survives, however, that this monument ever existed. Under his will of April 1754 the Bodleian received coins, as well as manuscripts and correspondence (MSS Ballard 1&#150;73) including forty-four volumes of letters chiefly addressed to Dr Arthur Charlett, master of University College, Oxford. Many of the letters were published by the Revd John Walker in <span class="italic">Letters Written by Eminent Persons in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries</span> (1813).<br>
