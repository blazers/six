<span class="headword">Wright,  Edward Perceval</span>  (1834&#150;1910), <span class="occ">naturalist</span>, was born on 27 December 1834 at Dublin, the eldest son of Edward Wright, barrister, of Floraville, Donnybrook, and his wife, Charlotte, daughter of Joseph Wright of Beech Hill, Donnybrook. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37033/', "Charles Henry Hamilton Wright")</script> was his younger brother. Edward was educated at home, and began to study natural history under Professor George James Allman before he entered Trinity College, Dublin, at the end of 1852. He graduated BA in 1857 and proceeded MA in 1859, taking an MA <i>ad eundem</i> at Oxford. Wright continued his medical studies and graduated MD in 1862; he then visited the medical schools of Berlin, Vienna, and Paris to study ophthalmology.<br>
<br>Although he wished to practise ophthalmic surgery, Wright spent almost his entire career within the University of Dublin. In 1857 he was appointed curator of the university museum and, the following year, lecturer in zoology, a not very exacting post which he held for ten years. While holding this position Wright simultaneously continued his medical studies and lectured in botany at the medical school of Dr Steevens's Hospital, Dublin. In 1865 and 1866, at the university, he also acted as deputy to the ailing professor of botany, William Henry Harvey (1811&#150;1866).<br>
<br>By 1866 Wright seems to have abandoned ideas of becoming an ophthalmic surgeon. In 1867 he paid a six-month visit to the Seychelles and, although his collecting apparatus was lost by shipwreck on the way out, he brought back an important collection of plants and animals. He spent the spring of 1868 in Sicily and the autumn of the same year in dredging off the coast of Portugal. In 1869 Wright was appointed professor of botany in the University of Dublin, succeeding Professor Alexander Dickson (1836&#150;1887) who had resigned the chair in 1868 to move to Glasgow. After a little while the university also appointed Wright as keeper of the herbarium.<br>
<br>Wright was a fluent, thorough, and conscientious teacher. He was &#145;a man of unspeculative mind&#146;  (McDowell and Webb, 242) so, while he devoted most of his energies to the arrangement of the herbarium, he did not use the collections for taxonomic studies. He spent many vacations on the continent of Europe, when evidently he collected specimens for the herbarium, and was lamed for life in a carriage accident in Switzerland. In 1872 he married Emily Shaw, second daughter of Colonel Ponsonby Shaw. The couple had no children.<br>
<br>Wright was a prolific author in zoology and botany. His principal research lay in marine zoology and an early indication of this was his participation in the meetings of the British Association for the Advancement of Science; at Leeds in 1858, he, in conjunction with Joseph Reay Greene, presented a report on the marine fauna of the south and west coasts of Ireland.<br>
<br>In 1854, while an undergraduate, Wright founded the quarterly <span class="italic">Natural History Review</span> which he edited until 1866. His earliest papers, published in this journal, illustrate his diverse interests; they deal with rare Irish birds, fungi parasitic upon insects, the collecting of molluscs, and a disease of the minnow. In subsequent papers Wright covered topics as varied as native filmy ferns and the flora of the Aran Islands in Galway Bay, Irish sea anemones, sponges, and sea slugs (nudibranchs). With Alexander Henry Haliday (1806&#150;1870), Wright described the troglodyte animals of the Mitchelstown caves, co. Kilkenny, Ireland, where they discovered three blind species including the springtail <i>Lipura wrightii</i>. With Dr Theophil Studer he reported on the corals (<i>Alcyonaria</i>) of the <i>Challenger</i> expedition. In conjunction with Thomas Henry Huxley, Wright described the fossil Amphibia in the Kilkenny (Jarrow) coal measures. His books included English editions of Figuier's <span class="italic">Ocean World</span> (1872) and <span class="italic">Mammalia</span> (1875). While pursuing ophthalmological studies, Wright translated from F. C. Donders's <span class="italic">The Pathogeny of Squint</span> (1864), and in 1865 published a paper entitled &#145;A modification of Liebreich's ophthalmoscope&#146;.<br>
<br>Wright was an energetic supporter of Dublin's scientific societies; he served, at various times, as secretary to the Dublin University Zoological and Botanical Association and to the Royal Geological Society of Ireland. He was a member of the Dublin Microscopical Club, the first president of the Dublin Naturalists' Field Club (1886&#150;7), and, because he took a keen interest in archaeology, president of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland (1900&#150;02). He became a member of the Royal Irish Academy in 1857, and, having been elected to its council in 1870, was secretary from 1874 to 1877, and from 1883 to 1899, carefully supervising the publications. In 1883 he was awarded the Cunningham gold medal.<br>
<br>After his wife's death in 1886 Wright moved into rooms in Trinity College, close to the herbarium. Owing to heart disease, he resigned as professor of botany in 1904, but continued with his post as keeper of the herbarium. He died of bronchitis at Trinity College on 2 March 1910, and was buried at Mount Jerome cemetery, Dublin.<br>
