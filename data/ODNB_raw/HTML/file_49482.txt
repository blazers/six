<span class="headword">Everard,  Frederick Thomas</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Friedrich Thomas Eberhardt]</span>  (1858/9&#150;1929), <span class="occ">shipowner</span>, was of German origins, beginning life with the surname Eberhardt, which he prudently changed in the First World War. He became foreman shipwright for A. H. Keep, a barge builder at Greenhithe, in Swanscombe, Kent, after a period in its Battersea yard. He was so successful that by 1880 he was yard manager, and bought the site to operate it himself. About a decade later he moved into barge owning, though not with one of his own construction, but perhaps as payment for a debt from the cement makers Knight and Bevan.<br>
<br>The fleet was built up until, by his death in 1929, it numbered about fifty vessels. Although Everard started with sailing barges, and throughout his life retained a strong belief in their utility and profitability, he was not immune from changes around him and encouraged the shift to powered craft, which Everards began just before the First World War. The firm went into both steam and motor coasters. Interestingly, given the criticisms usually levelled at British shipowners for being slow to adopt diesel technology, Everards owned a motorship before it did a steam-engined vessel, and operated more motorships than steamers throughout the inter-war period. By 1939 its fleet comprised nearly forty motor coasters as against about ten steamships and twenty-five sailing ships. Thus the firm was able to compete against the Dutch motor coasters which began to appear in the British coastal trade.<br>
<br>Everard married Susan Ann Spooner (1862&#150;1944), daughter of William Martin Spooner, mariner, on 8 March 1885. They had three sons and one daughter, all of whom were encouraged to take an interest in the firm. Everard ensured his two eldest sons received a thorough technical training at the Greenhithe yard and in the shipyard of Fellows at Great Yarmouth. His youngest son was trained as an engineer at the firm of Plenty &amp; Son at Newbury, which made marine diesel engines, and which was acquired by Everards in 1932. His daughter, Alice Ethel, the eldest of the four children, also helped with the business, especially on the bookkeeping and office management side, remaining undistracted by marriage. By the First World War all four children were playing an active part in the firm with William taking the lead in strategy and the operational side, Frederick in the construction and repair of barges. When the private firm was converted to a limited liability company in 1922 Everard was governing director, and the other four directors were his children; the shares were split equally among these five.<br>
<br>One of Everards' strengths in the 1920s was its enterprise. Apart from being among the first British firms to operate diesel ships, it also sought and found new trades, such as coastal tankers with steam heating coils, which allowed it to carry edible fish and vegetable oils at the correct temperature for easy pumping. It also spread its risks by operating in a wide range of trades such as coal, clay for cement making, china clay, and grains. The firm was also good at fostering a spirit of friendly rivalry among its skippers, encouraging them to make fast passages and paying them a form of piece rate&#151;on shares&#151;to ensure the minimum time spent in harbour. The founder was also careful with the finances, ensuring profits were ploughed back into more vessels, and employing external sources of finance, such as the Midland Bank, using the fleet as collateral. During the First World War the firm received &#145;financial help&#146;  (Wilson, 173) from Van den Berghs in return for carrying oils to the Netherlands and margarine back to the UK. The association lasted into the Unilever era and beyond the Second World War.<br>
<br>Everards has been described as &#145;a paternalistic company demanding acquiescence, in return for which they looked after their own&#146;  (Durham, 111). At times this meant the skippers were driven to improve productivity or were subject to sarcastic comment if they were slow on a passage. The good side was small unexplained gifts and thoughtfulness to the crews, and the provision of over fifty houses in Greenhithe for the crews' occupation, appropriately in Port and Starboard Avenues. Everards also used barge racing as a method of motivating its crews and advertising its services. The founder of the firm was a keen supporter of the Thames and Medway races, and his sons kept up this tradition until well into the 1960s. Although never as large scale as the largest barge owners, such as E. and J. Goldsmith of Grays or the London and Rochester Trading Company of Kent, Everards was built on stronger foundations and endured.<br>
<br>Everard has been described as calm and restrained, a gentleman of the old school, genuinely concerned for his crews. He was active in the local community, presenting a flagstaff to celebrate the relief of Mafeking in 1900 to St Mary's Greenhithe, the local parish church, of which he was a churchwarden from 1909 to 1920. In 1925 he donated land on which to build a rectory. He was widely liked and respected. He died on 8 June 1929, aged seventy, at his house, The Warren, High Street, Greenhithe, and was probably buried in St Mary's.<br>
