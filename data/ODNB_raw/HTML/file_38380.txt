<span class="headword">Bevington <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Guggenberger]</span>,  Louisa Sarah</span>  (1845&#150;1895), <span class="occ">poet and anarchist</span>, was born on 14 May 1845 in St John's Hill, Battersea, Surrey, to Louisa and Alexander Bevington. The eldest of eight children (seven of whom were girls), she was brought up a Quaker. An early enthusiasm for science was fostered by her father. Later, interested by evolutionism, she became a friend of Herbert Spencer. Both her philosophical essays and her poems, which question religion and its moral authority, betray the influence of his ideas.<br>
<br>Bevington's first volume of poetry, <span class="italic">Key Notes</span>, was published in 1876 under the pseudonym Arbor Leigh (recalling Elizabeth Barrett Browning's eponymous heroine, Aurora Leigh) and was reprinted under her own name in 1879. It has the unusual distinction of having captured the interest of the apparently poetry-weary Charles Darwin, who is said to have read it in 1879 &#145;after not having opened a volume of verse for fifteen years&#146;  (Miles, 261).<br>
<br>In 1881 Spencer solicited an article from Bevington defending scientific philosophy against critics who harped on its &#145;moral shortcomings&#146;. Her reply, &#145;The moral colour of rationalism&#146;, appeared in the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span>. A second volume of poetry, <span class="italic">Poems, Lyrics and Sonnets</span>, was published in 1882, and in 1883 she went to Germany, where she met and married the Munich artist Ignatz Felix Guggenberger. By the early 1890s she had returned to London alone. Little is known about the circumstances surrounding the breakdown of her marriage. Obituaries tentatively report that the couple soon found themselves &#145;out of tune with one another&#146;  (<span class="italic">Liberty</span>, 188).<br>
<br>On her return to London, Bevington became an active member of the anarchist movement. By this time London had become the &#145;headquarters of continental communist activity&#146;  (Oliver, vii), and she belonged to the circle which included the exiled Russian Prince Peter Kropotkin and the communard Louise Michel, whose work <span class="italic">Commune de Paris</span> she translated. As well as contributing articles to anarchist journals (among them <span class="italic">Liberty</span>, <span class="italic">Commonweal</span>, and <span class="italic">Freedom</span>) she lectured regularly at the Autonomie Club and favoured the &#145;short hair&#146; and &#145;sensible short skirts and boots&#146;  (ibid., 153) worn by its female members. The detail contained in a letter written by Bevington about the Greenwich observatory explosion of 1894, in which an anarchist, Martial Bourdin, was killed (the incident on which Joseph Conrad based his 1907 novel, <span class="italic">The Secret Agent</span>), reveals her close involvement with the movement.<br>
<br>Louisa Sarah Bevington died, aged fifty, at her home, 25 Lechmere Road, Willesden Green, London, on 28 November 1895, having suffered for some years from heart disease. <span class="italic">Liberty</span> recorded that among the mourners at her funeral were Kropotkin and his wife. She was buried on 3 December in St Pancras cemetery, Finchley, without &#145;any religious ceremony whatever&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Torch of Anarchy</span>, 104). Many of her poems, written in short rhyming stanzas, demonstrate the insignificance of human concerns in the face of the vast scheme of evolution. Others engage with current social issues, most notably &#145;One More Bruised Heart&#146;, which deals movingly with the subject of child abuse.<br>
