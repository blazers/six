<span class="headword">Bonnor,  Charles</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1829?), <span class="occ">actor and civil servant</span>, was the son of a distiller in Bristol. After commencing his working life as apprentice to a coachmaker, he appeared on the Bath stage on 4 October 1777 as Belcour, in Richard Cumberland's comedy <span class="italic">The West Indian</span>. He remained at Bath until the close of the 1782&#150;3 season, playing such characters as Charles Surface in <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span>, Ranger in Benjamin Hoadley's <span class="italic">The Suspicious Husband</span>, and Touchstone in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>. He also made his first attempts at writing, and supplied successful prologues, epilogues, and occasional addresses. On 7 July 1783 he appeared for his farewell benefit as Mercutio in <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span> and Puff in <span class="italic">The Critic</span>, and announced his forthcoming departure for London. He made his d&eacute;but there on 19 September 1783 at Covent Garden, as Brazen in <span class="italic">The Recruiting Officer</span>. In London, as in Bath, his reception was favourable.<br>
<br>In 1784 Bonnor was sent by Thomas Harris, the manager of Covent Garden, to Paris to establish an English theatre there. Initially it seemed as if the mission would be successful, and a theatre in the Tuileries was taken. However, when the queen of France withdrew her patronage the scheme failed, and all Bonnor and the others realized was an opportunity to perform in Paris for a while. On his return from France, Bonnor produced for his benefit, at Covent Garden on 6 May 1785, an interlude called <span class="italic">The Manager in Spite of himself</span>, translated by Bonnor himself from Dorvigny's <span class="italic">La f&ecirc;te de campagne</span>, in which he played all but one of the characters in the play. Meanwhile he also performed a variety of other parts, including Petulant in Congreve's <span class="italic">The Way of the World</span>, Lovelace in Arthur Murphy's <span class="italic">Three Weeks after Marriage</span>, and the title role in <span class="italic">The Marriage of Figaro</span>. Bonnor's last appearance at Covent Garden was in May 1785, as Lord Sparkle in <span class="italic">Which is the Man?</span> and Robin in <span class="italic">The Contrivances</span>. His only other connection with this theatre was in December 1790, when his pantomime adapted from the French, <span class="italic">Picture of Paris</span>, was produced there. Neither of Bonnor's plays was ever printed.<br>
<br>Soon afterwards John Palmer, the owner of the Bath theatre, and the first proprietor of mail coaches, who had been appointed comptroller-general, of the Post Office, availed himself of Bonnor's organizational abilities in his scheme for the establishment of a mail-coach service. This led to Bonnor's appointment as deputy comptroller of the Post Office, and his consequent retirement from the stage. In 1788 he became resident surveyor, as well as deputy surveyor and comptroller-general, of the General Post Office. When Palmer became involved in a dispute with the postmaster-general and vacated his post in 1793, Bonnor displayed his political astuteness by dissociating himself from his erstwhile benefactor and getting himself appointed to the comptrollership of the inland department of the Post Office. This position he held for two years. Changes were then made in the Post Office, the comptrollership was abolished, and Bonnor retired on a pension. Between 1797 and 1800 he published three pamphlets in connection with Palmer's claims. He was apparently still living in 1827, and was very possibly the Charles Bonnor of Gloucester whose death the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> recorded in August 1829.<br>
