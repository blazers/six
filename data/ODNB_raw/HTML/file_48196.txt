<span class="headword">Smith, Sir  Allan MacGregor</span>  (1871&#150;1941), <span class="occ">employers' leader and politician</span>, was born on 19 May 1871 at 236 Dumbarton Road, Glasgow, the second of eight children of Alexander Smith, master house-painter and a native of Elgin, and his wife, Agnes Welsh Campbell, from Glen Orchy in Inverness-shire. He was educated at Glasgow Academy and at the University of Glasgow, where he took an MA ordinary degree in 1890. He went on to read law, graduating LLB in 1896. His subsequent career, initially as a practising solicitor, and then as the leading figure in the Engineering Employers' Federation (EEF) and as a member of parliament, was to take him to the very centre of industrial politics in Britain.<br>
<br>Smith's apprenticeship began in Glasgow, when he joined the legal practice of Biggart and Lumsden as a managing clerk. Through this firm, which acted for the EEF and some of the chief engineering and shipbuilding companies on Clydeside, Smith was introduced to the world of employers' organizations and to the politics of labour relations. In 1901 his legal and administrative capabilities were recognized when he was made a partner in the firm. In the same year he was named as parliamentary solicitor to the EEF, and he also became assistant secretary to the North-West of Scotland Engineering Employers' Federation and to the Clyde Shipbuilders' Association. In 1908 Smith was made joint assistant secretary to the EEF and two years later, when the federation moved to new headquarters in London, he was appointed sole secretary and treasurer.<br>
<br>Smith first attracted public notice in 1912 when he presented the federation's evidence on trade union agreements to the Industrial Council, a government-sponsored body designed to promote industrial peace. However, with the outbreak of war in 1914, he rose rapidly to national prominence as an employers' leader. In 1916 he was appointed chairman of the EEF's newly formed management committee, effectively becoming the federation's chief executive. During the war Smith served on more than thirty official government committees and acted as an adviser to various ministries and departments, notably the Ministry of Munitions and the ministries of Labour and Reconstruction. At the end of 1918 he was created KBE for his wartime services, and further official recognition soon followed, which confirmed his authority in industry. In February 1919 he was appointed spokesman for the employers' delegation at the National Industrial Conference; in April 1919 he joined the Sankey coal enquiry and a few months later he was chosen as the British employers' delegate on the governing body of the newly formed International Labour Organization, which he served until 1922.<br>
<br>During and immediately after the First World War Smith made several important and lasting contributions to the organization of employers in Britain. Under his efficient direction the EEF increased its membership and influence in the metal industries to become one of the premier employers' organizations in the country and a major force in industrial affairs. Smith was also the leading personality behind the setting up of the National Confederation of Employers' Organizations in April 1919, of which he was chairman between 1919 and 1922 and then an active ex-officio member of its executive council. In addition he played an instrumental role in the establishment in March 1920 of the International Organization of Industrial Employers, based in Brussels, in which he held the post of president during 1921 and 1922. In February 1923 he was elected a companion member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in recognition of his services to industry.<br>
<br>Smith's work for the EEF, and on behalf of the employers' movement generally, drew him into active politics. During these years he was a prominent and influential member of several political bodies, notably the British Commonwealth Union (BCU) and the Economic League. In December 1919, with the support of the BCU, he was elected as the Conservative MP for Croydon South; he held the seat until the general election in 1923, when he chose to stand down. Subsequently, he stood unsuccessfully for the Partick division of Glasgow. In the House of Commons, Smith was a member of the parliamentary industrial group, an influential back-bench organization sponsored by the BCU, and served as its chairman between 1921 and 1923. In this role Smith spoke on trade and industrial matters and enjoyed the intimacy of some of the important political figures of the day, including David Lloyd George (his chief political patron), Winston Churchill, and Sir Robert Horne. After the war Smith was also able to continue his role as a government adviser, joining the British delegation to the Cannes conference in 1922 as an industrial expert, serving on the Balfour committee on industry and trade between 1924 and 1929, and providing the second Labour government of 1929&#150;31 with advice on trade and employment policy matters. In October 1934 he resigned from the EEF on the grounds of ill health and retired from public life.<br>
<br>In 1919 Smith, at the height of his powers, had been described by one contemporary as a &#145;star among the professional representatives of capitalism&#146;  (Cole, 160&#150;61), and he remained wholly dedicated to this cause. Throughout his career his approach to economic issues was guided by a deep-seated belief in free enterprise and by a ferocious determination to assert the interests of Britain's staple heavy industries. In the arena of industrial relations, where his influence was strongly felt, notably in the engineering dispute of 1922 and in the events surrounding the 1926 general strike and its aftermath, he was opposed to all forms of government intervention and vigorously expounded an approach to labour relations based on the principle of the employer's &#145;right to manage&#146;. His firm and frequently heard views on these issues, in numerous speeches and in print, earned him a reputation for clear thinking and honesty but also for inflexibility; they also brought him into disagreement with some of the more consensus-minded employers of his day, as well as with Labour leaders and the trade union movement.<br>
<br>A religious and intense man, short in stature but physically strong &#145;with a face of granite and steel-blue eyes&#146;  (Wigham, 291), Smith commanded attention from those around him, if not affection. His closest friends and associates, who were drawn mainly from the engineering industry and from business circles, included Lord Weir, Sir Andrew Duncan, and Patrick Hannon. In December 1901 Smith married Isabella Clow (1869&#150;1933), the daughter of John A. McCallum, one of Scotland's chief coalmasters, and they had a son and two daughters. Smith's social and leisure activities reflected his strong and continuing links with Scotland, which he visited regularly. His interests included music&#151;he was a bagpiper&#151;and sailing, on the west coast of Scotland and as a member of the Royal Thames Yacht Club, as well as deerstalking and fishing. For most of his active career Smith lived with his family in Hampstead, London. He died there on 21 February 1941 at 9 Greenaway Gardens, Hampstead, from coronary failure, and was buried on 26 February at St Andrew's Presbytery Church, Frognal, London.<br>
<br>A pioneering and controversial employers' leader, Sir Allan MacGregor Smith was one of several outstanding business figures from Scottish backgrounds who made a mark upon industrial and political affairs in Britain during and after the First World War.<br>
