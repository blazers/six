<span class="headword">Trevenen,  James</span>  (1760&#150;1790), <span class="occ">naval officer in the British and Russian services</span>, was born at Rosewarne, near Camborne, Cornwall, on 1 January 1760, the third son of John Trevenen, curate of Camborne, and Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Tellam (<i>d</i>. 1799). He was educated at Helston grammar school and from 1773 at the Royal Naval Academy at Portsmouth, where he studied for three years.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1776 Trevenen was appointed to the <i>Resolution</i>, then fitting out for the last voyage of Captain James Cook. From her, in August 1779, he followed Captain James King to the <i>Discovery</i>. On 28 October 1780, on the return of the expedition to Britain, he was promoted lieutenant, and early in the following year he was appointed to the <i>Crocodile</i>, then commanded by King, in the North Sea and in the channel. In the summer of 1782 he again followed King to the <i>Resistance</i>, which went out to the West Indies in charge of convoy. On 2 March 1783 she fell in with and captured the French frigate <i>Coquette</i>, then returning from taking possession of Turk's Island. A few days later the <i>Resistance</i> and some smaller vessels under the orders of Captain Horatio Nelson in the <i>Albemarle</i>, attempted to recapture Turk's Island, but without success. Trevenen returned home in July 1783, and spent most of the next two years in Italy.<br>
<br>In 1786 Trevenen had an idea for a merchant voyage to Nootka Sound, and a small company was discussed, but the project fell through. He considered service in the East India Company and also applied to the Admiralty for employment in connection with the new settlement at Botany Bay. However, opportunities &#145;out of the common routine of sea duty&#146; as he put it, were limited; thereafter Trevenen developed a disgust for the Admiralty that he thought slow to recognize his&#151;as yet unproved&#151;merit.<br>
<br>In February 1787 Trevenen discussed a scheme to voyage to the north Pacific with the Russian ambassador in London. After approval by the Russian government, Trevenen was ordered to St Petersburg, as he believed, to take command of the project. Before his departure he was warned by friends, including his brother-in-law, Charles Vinicombe Penrose, that should he accept the post he would be required to serve in the Russian navy in the event of war with Turkey. On reaching St Petersburg Trevenen discovered that the Turks had indeed declared war against Russia, that the expedition was postponed, and that he was expected to serve in the navy with the rank of second captain. He agreed to this, subject to the consent of the English Admiralty. Assuming that this would be given, he accepted the command of a ship intended for the Mediterranean. In late 1787 he received the Admiralty's refusal. Considering himself bound to the Russians, he sent a letter in which he resigned his commission. However, his friends did not forward his letter, and it does not appear that the Admiralty ever knew officially of his disobedience.<br>
<br>The outbreak of the war with Sweden in 1788 prevented Trevenen's being sent to the Mediterranean, and in July he took command of the <i>Rodislav</i> (64 guns) in the fleet of another British officer in Russian service, Admiral Samuel Greig. In late July Trevenen was involved in the Russians' disappointing engagement with the Swedes near H&ouml;gland. In the following month he was sent in command of a small squadron to Hang&ouml; Head, cutting the communication between Stockholm and the Swedish ports in the Gulf of Finland. This blockade he maintained until the close of the season, and on his return to Kronstadt he was promoted to captain of the first class. In May 1789 Trevenen was again sent to his station off Hang&ouml; Head, but during the winter the Swedes had thrown up several batteries. He was therefore recalled, and joined Admiral Chichagoff at Reval. In mid-July they joined a division of the fleet which had wintered at Copenhagen, but on 25 July they found themselves in the presence of the Swedish fleet. A desultory engagement followed, the fleets separated without any result, and Chichagoff joined the Copenhagen squadron and returned to Reval. Trevenen was then sent to occupy Porkala Point and to destroy the batteries in Bar&ouml; Sound. On his return to Reval at the end of October the <i>Rodislav</i> was run on a submerged reef and became a total wreck. A court martial decided that the pilot alone was to blame, and Trevenen was appointed to the <i>Ne Tron Menya</i> at Kronstadt under the command of Admiral Kruse. At Kronstadt in February 1789 Trevenen married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1845), daughter of John Farquharson; they had one daughter.<br>
<br>In May 1790 Admiral Kruse put to sea with sixteen ships of the line, wishing to effect a junction with Chichagoff at Reval. The Swedish fleet of twenty-two sail of the line interposed, and on 3 June a sharp action was fought, renewed on the following day, without any decided advantage to either side. Kruse was able to join with Chichagoff, and the Swedes fell back into Viborg Bay. On 3 July 1790 they made an ineffectual attempt to force their way out, but in the action Trevenen received wounds from which he died on board his ship at Kronstadt on 9 July. He was survived by his wife, who later married the editor Thomas Bowdler.<br>
