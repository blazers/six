<span class="headword">La Motte,  John</span>  (1577&#150;1655), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was born in Colchester on 1 May 1577, the son of Francis La Motte, a weaver and cloth merchant who had fled to the town in 1564 from Ypres in Flanders. Presumably he was apprenticed in his father's craft. By the second decade of the seventeenth century, during which he moved to London, he had become a highly successful merchant. In 1615 he was residing in the parish of St Bartholomew by the Exchange; by 1618 he lived in Broad Street and had become a freeman of the Weavers' Company. About this time he married Anne Tivelyn from the Dutch/Walloon community in Canterbury; the couple had two daughters, Hester and Elizabeth.<br>
<br>Initially La Motte joined his local parish church, and throughout his life he continued to attend godly lectures there. After having served as constable in 1619, he became church warden in 1621. Five years later he was elected an elder of the Dutch church in London, unusually without having first served the community as a deacon. By that time La Motte had become a widower, and in 1626 he married the extremely wealthy Elizabeth van Poele, widow of the former clerk of the signet, Sir Levinius Munk (<i>d</i>. 1623), who had been a prominent member of the London Dutch church. La Motte's business acumen and financially astute marriages guaranteed him a place among the London merchant &eacute;lite, and in 1629 he was elected upper bailiff of the Weavers' Company. He was also able to play a leading part in one of the major charitable causes of his age, the collections for the Reformed refugees from the Rhine Palatinate, which commenced in England in 1628. Among his many business ventures was an interest in the East India Association, organized by another member of the Dutch church, Sir William Courten, to compete with the East India Company, and licensed in 1635. In this capacity he collaborated closely not only with a group of wealthy Dutch and Walloon merchants resident in London, but also with a group of &#145;new&#146; English merchants in the City, of whom the most prominent was Maurice Thomson.<br>
<br>In March 1648 La Motte was elected an alderman of the City of London, but, pleading old age and infirmity, he was discharged the following month on payment of a fine of &pound;600. Despite his frailty, he lived another seven years and continued to serve as an elder of the Dutch church. He died in Broad Street, London, on 13 July 1655 and was buried at St Bartholomew by the Exchange. By this time he owned the manors of Ramsey and Brudwell, in Essex, and lands at Fowlmer, in Cambridgeshire. His will, proved on 8 August 1655, divided his considerable estate, half going to his grandson Maurice Abbot, son of Elizabeth La Motte and Sir Maurice Abbot, and the other half to his surviving daughter, Hester, who had married Sir Thomas Honeywood, and her family and other relatives and friends. La Motte's deep concern for Christian charity, evident in his funeral sermon and in many donations during his lifetime to the Dutch community in London, was also reflected in his will. He left bequests for the inmates of Bridewell, of which he was a governor, and for the poor in Christ's Hospital; to the Dutch churches of London, Colchester, Sandwich, and Canterbury; and to the parishes of Fowlmer and St James, Colchester; as well as to the Weavers' Company. La Motte's piety and godliness impressed his contemporaries: while John Goodwin, minister of Coleman Street, had dedicated one of his early works to him, Samuel Clarke included him in his hagiography of great puritan men and women.<br>
