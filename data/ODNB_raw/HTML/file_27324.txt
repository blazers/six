</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thomson,  Thomas</span>  (1768&#150;1852), <span class="occ">record scholar and advocate</span>, was born on 10 November 1768 at the manse in Dailly, Ayrshire, the eldest son of the Revd Thomas Thomson, the parish minister, and his second wife, Mary Hay, daughter of Francis Hay in Lochside, Ayrshire. He was educated in the parish school until 1782, when he matriculated at Glasgow University, aged fourteen. During three sessions he distinguished himself in the Greek and other classes. Through his father's patron, Sir Adam Fergusson of Kilkerran, he gained a Dundonald bursary in 1785, and graduated MA on 27 April 1789. While sometimes assisting with the education of his younger brothers at Dailly, he spent two more years attending theology and philosophy classes, as well as law and political science under John Millar, who influenced his decision to enter the law rather than the church. He moved to Edinburgh, where he passed his first civil law trial in November 1792 and was admitted as advocate on 10 December 1793. In 1797 he set up house in Castle Street with his brothers Adam and John, who later became well known as a landscape painter.<br>
<br>Thomson built a solid practice at the bar, including important cases such as the Craigingillan case (1807), appeals to the House of Lords such as the Bargany case (1797), and peerage cases. His strength lay in written pleadings, for his easy and conversational delivery in court lacked oratorical force. Freehold and entail cases particularly attracted him because of his study of feudal law, inspired perhaps by his early acquaintance with Lord Hailes. Although he abandoned a commission from Hailes's family to write a memoir and edit his works and letters, Thomson was drawn to the study of original records and charters, of which Hailes had been a pioneer. His profound acquaintance with the complexities of feudal tenure was best shown in his memorial &#145;on old extent&#146; of 1816, written for the case of <i>Cranstoun v. Gibson</i> over a disputed vote in the Midlothian election of 1812, which minutely interpreted historical forms of land taxation.<br>
<br>During his studies and early practice Thomson formed lifelong friendships with his contemporaries at the bar Walter Scott, Francis Jeffrey, George Cranstoun, Thomas Kennedy, Francis Horner, Henry Cockburn, and other Edinburgh luminaries. They accepted him as their equal, admired his legal and historical learning, and cherished the genial hospitality of his supper parties. He was interested in politics, but his own activities were mainly confined to faculty affairs. As one of the whig literati who planned the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, he contributed three articles in 1803&#150;4, and edited the spring 1804 number. His painstaking writing method decided him against contributing again, but he obliged Jeffrey by editing three issues in 1813&#150;15.<br>
<br>A growing reputation for legal antiquities led Thomson to be consulted in 1804 by the lord clerk register, Lord Frederick Campbell, about the unpublished edition of the records of the Scottish parliaments in Register House prepared by William Robertson in terms of the record commission of 1800. The commissioners accepted Thomson's recommendation for the suppression of the whole work because it used flawed texts and omitted authentic ones, and in December 1804 they appointed him their Scottish subcommissioner. During 1805 he persuaded the commissioners to adopt his own larger publication scheme. At the same period they became convinced of the need to place Thomson in charge of Scotland's public records, particularly to stop irregularities in the framing of registers. Following Treasury approval for a post in March 1806, the king granted a warrant on 19 June, and on 30 June Thomson was appointed the first deputy clerk register, at an annual salary of &pound;500. In July he was recommended to be a confidential adviser to Grenville's government, on account of his moderate whig politics, but nothing came of it, and he began his commission at General Register House to draft regulations for the formation, custody, and transmission of all the public records under the clerk register's authority.<br>
<br>Reforms in Thomson's report to the commissioners on the state of the records were recommended to the Scottish law officers and keepers of registers and records in July 1807, and most of them were enacted by the court of session in 1808&#150;11, and by parliament in 1809 (49 Geo. III.c. 42). They included improvements in the methods of compiling the registers of the great seal, deeds, sasines, and diligence. Thenceforward the register volumes issued by himself were a standard size and more uniformly filled, and by degrees Thomson established regular transmissions of registers from their keepers. Most of the reforms had been proposed by his predecessor, Robertson, but Thomson's achievement was to execute a series of well-planned measures which overcame the vested interests of the keepers and clerks.<br>
<br>Beside these changes, Thomson initiated an overdue conservation programme, personally inspecting the bindings and condition of volumes, and bringing a specialist paper repairer from London, Mrs Weir, to work and to train assistants. Between 1807 and 1816 repairs were carried out on many of the almost 12,000 volumes in Register House, including the rebinding of 6500 and the inlaying of 30,000 leaves in 180 of them. His other innovations included repertories of the records in Register House, and, more importantly, abridgements and indexes sanctioned and financed by the record commissioners, to facilitate searching of the records. The first series covered were the retours up to 1700, the records of chancery dealing with heirs inheriting property, which Thomson abridged and indexed in three volumes under the title <span class="italic">Inquisitionum ad capellam domini regis retornatarum &hellip; abbreviatio</span> (1811&#150;16). Although he continued the abridgements from 1701, they lacked the intended indexes, and were not published in his lifetime. In order to ease searching and reduce fees, he compiled and printed abridgements and indexes to the registers of sasines, inhibitions, and adjudications for 1781&#150;1830.<br>
<br>Another project was an abstract of royal charters in the great seal and elsewhere in the public records, authorized by the commissioners in May 1806, and resulting in <span class="italic">Registrum magni sigilli</span> (1814), which covered the period 1306&#150;1424. It set a high standard of accuracy, but was only published after pressure by the commissioners, who were alarmed at the slow progress of Thomson's multiplying editorial schemes. Since 1806 he had also been transcribing crown charters in burgh and private muniments which were not among the public records. After being suspended between 1812 and 1824, transcribing resumed, and by 1831 over 1500 charters from before Mary's reign had been copied. Thomson's abridgements and transcriptions laid the foundations of later editions of charters.<br>
<br>Of all Thomson's editing projects and achievements, the greatest was the <span class="italic">Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland</span>, starting with the second volume, published in 1814, and concluding with volume 11 in 1824. Thomson drew on the official records of parliament and supplemented them with other sources to compile what he held to be authoritative texts. However, there were gaps in the record which caused him considerable problems. Fresh discoveries of manuscripts in 1826 rendered volumes 5 and 6 obsolete, but he was unable to produce new editions. For the years before 1424 the lack of official records posed special difficulties. In trying to overcome them Thomson delayed publication of volume 1 year after year, acutely aware of the need to surpass the standards of Robertson's text, which he had condemned in 1804. His labour was immense and his scholarship exacting, but he failed to make a definitive selection of texts or to write an introduction, owing to what his friend Cosmo Innes described as his &#145;grand defect &hellip;, a morbid reluctance to commit his opinions to paper&#146;  (Innes, 184). The work was taken from him in 1841, printed but still unpublished. Innes edited and amplified it for publication in 1844, acknowledging his mentor's immense achievement. Thomson's edition has remained the standard one, but its main weakness, unlike Robertson's work, lies in the failure to identify the sources blended and presented as definitive versions. Further criticisms have attached to his decision, based on mistaken interpretations of their nature, to publish records of parliament's judicial proceedings separately as the <span class="italic">Acts of the Lords Auditors</span> and <span class="italic">Acts of the Lords of Council in Civil Causes</span>. The official pressure to publish them in 1839 prevented Thomson from writing a substantial introduction.<br>
<br>Besides official works, Thomson edited prolifically for the Bannatyne Club, formed in 1823 to publish historical texts, of which he issued fourteen, including <span class="italic">The History and Life of James the Sext</span> (1825). Having been the club's vice-president from 1823, he succeeded Scott as its president in 1832 and became &#145;our master and our guide&#146;, in Henry Cockburn's words  (Laing, 7). He made up for not writing a historical work by generously imparting his knowledge to many other scholars. At his own expense he edited and published privately several other texts, ranging from medieval accounts to eighteenth-century memoirs. He also subscribed to the Maitland and Spalding clubs, and with Scott, Cockburn, Jeffrey, and others, belonged to convivial clubs such as the Friday Club and the Blair Adam Club. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1807, and of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland in 1817, and he was the latter's vice-president from 1828 to 1836. Probably through his friendship with the mathematician John Playfair, he was a founding director of the Edinburgh Astronomical Institution in 1812, and he also served as a curator of the Advocates' Library.<br>
<br>In 1822&#150;3 Thomson acted in appeal cases in London while lobbying for funds to complete the Register House work, but he was practising law less than formerly. He considered a place on the Scottish bench in 1827 but in January 1828, largely in order to continue his record work, he chose instead to be appointed a principal clerk of session, at a salary of &pound;1000. Like Walter Scott, Thomson was able to fulfil his court duties with time to spare for his main interests, including the Bannatyne Club. Scott shared a passion for books with his close friend &#145;Mr Register Thomson&#146;, and sought his advice on legal as well as historical matters. Thomson served on the committees for Scott's monument from 1832, as he had for his friend Dugald Stewart's from 1828.<br>
<br>Thomson married Ann Reed, daughter of Thomas Reed, a former army contractor of Dublin, at St Pancras parish church in London on 25 October 1836. They had no children. At this period financial problems beset him as a result of his admitted dilatoriness regarding money, his zeal for the public records, and generosity to a needy relation. After the record commissioners suspended payments for the sasine abridgements in June 1831, he had continued to employ twelve clerks at his own expense rather than lose their experienced skill. He obtained loans of &pound;4000 on the security of his own and of his deputy's salaries in 1834&#150;5. By 1836 the irregularity of payments to Thomson's assistants became known through the complaints of Robert Pitcairn, writer to the signet, hired to work on the great seal, but not until 1839 did the exchequer repeatedly demand the production of the Register House annual accounts from 1824. Thomson was reluctant to face his growing predicament, arising from the entanglement of his private and official finances, but eventually responded.<br>
<br>The conclusion in November 1840 was that &pound;8570 was owing to the crown, but Thomson avoided prosecution by convincing the government that the money had been applied to record work and not for his private use. A secret attempt by Jeffrey and other friends, who were to subscribe &pound;1000 each to help repay the crown first, failed when Thomson's private creditor sought to recover the loans and the matter became public. The lord clerk register, being personally responsible for his deputy's mismanagement, dismissed and replaced Thomson on 19 April 1841. However, Thomson retained his clerkship and, like Scott, insisted on paying all his debts, applying most of his salary to them until he resigned in February 1852. The sale of his fine library in 3339 lots over twelve days in 1841 liquidated somewhat under half of the readjusted debt to the crown of &pound;7000.<br>
<br>After 1839 Thomson did no substantial editing work and largely withdrew from view, although he continued to preside over the Bannatyne Club and to enjoy the friendship of Cockburn and others who believed he had acted unwisely but not corruptly. In 1841 he left his house at 127 George Street, Edinburgh, for a series of smaller ones, and made several trips to London; in 1847 he even visited the continent. Following bronchial trouble he died at Shrubhill, Edinburgh, on 2 October 1852, and was buried in the Dean cemetery on 8 October.<br>
