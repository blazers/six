<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Willett,  William</span>  (1856&#150;1915), <span class="occ">builder and inventor of daylight saving</span>, was born at Farnham on 10 August 1856, one of three sons of <a name="cosubject_54027"></a><span class="headword">William Willett</span>  (1837&#150;1913)<span class="occ"></span> and his wife, Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Box. The two William Willetts established the leading firm of speculative housebuilders in late Victorian London, constructing over a thousand substantial middle-class homes.<br>
<br>William Willett senior, the son of a coal merchant in Colchester, where he was born, was apprenticed to a local stonemason in 1850. By the 1860s he was in some way of business as a monumental mason in St Marylebone, London, specializing in chimney-pieces, and in 1868 he ventured upon his first speculation, a street of brick-and-stucco houses on land in Belsize Crescent, Hampstead, left vacant by a bankrupt builder. The Willetts were to build steadily on estates in Belsize Park and South Hampstead throughout their career. By the mid-1870s Willett senior had abandoned his trade and started on a second development that kept the firm busy for over thirty years, the West Brighton estate at Hove. He retired there in 1903, and died at his home, 64 The Drive, on 9 November 1913.<br>
<br>The younger Willett attended Marylebone grammar school and acquired commercial experience before joining his father about 1880. Soon afterwards the firm's work became distinctive. The Italianate style of town house propagated all over Kensington had at last run its course, and the popularity of the larger London terrace house was in sharp decline. Though the Willetts continued to build some terrace housing, for instance south of Sloane Square, Chelsea, on the Cadogan estate, they specialized in big, solidly built detached houses with high standards of plumbing, wiring, and internal joinery. Such developments required more elaboration and individuality than had been common hitherto, so the Willetts had to be well capitalized and to attend to cash flow. Despite a few difficulties in the building slump of the early 1890s they seem never to have suffered serious setbacks.<br>
<br>The Willetts toyed briefly with a French idiom for their houses, but were soon converted to the fashionable Queen Anne domestic style and then, in the 1890s, to the quieter vernacular revival. The gamut of &#145;Willett homes&#146;, passing from force and flamboyance to an opulent charm with a hint of the stockbroker Tudor style to come, was demonstrated in streets such as Lyndhurst Gardens, Eton Avenue, and Elsworthy Road in Hampstead, as well as in The Drive and Eaton Gardens, Hove. These houses were very influential, and the promoters of Hampstead Garden Suburb acknowledged the impact of &#145;Elsworthy Village&#146; upon their own development. Architecture of this variable type required designers with some flair for each house. In consequence, the Willetts normally employed in-house architects under their control, and those so contracted were, successively, James Trant Smith (<i>c</i>.1880&#150;83), Harry Measures (1883&#150;91), and Amos Faulkner (from 1891 onwards).<br>
<br>William Willett junior's personal approach lay behind much of the thrust of the firm's work after 1890. On the Camden Park and Wildernesse estates, developed on his own freehold in Chislehurst, he brought in Ernest Newton (1856&#150;1922) to design his own house (The Cedars) and a few others; the influence of Newton's idiom is pervasive in later Willett homes. He also built a smattering of large houses on the great West End estates to independent architects' designs. Willett married Maria Mills (1857/8&#150;1905) on 14 April 1879; they had five daughters and two sons. After her death, on 15 February 1910 he married Florence Mary Ann Strickland (1884&#150;1957), with whom he had another two daughters and a son.<br>
<br>After William Willett senior retired in 1903, his son diversified his interests. He dabbled in pure property speculation, established an estate agency business with headquarters in Sloane Square, bought brickworks and a welding firm, patented a lighting generator, and took shares in a Spanish consortium for mining bauxite, the Matallana Company. Willett's greatest claim to fame is his promotion of daylight saving; in 1907 he published a pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Waste of Daylight</span>, conceived, claimed Willett, after riding in Petts Wood near his Chislehurst home early one summer morning and noticing how many blinds were still down. The result of his advocacy was the first <span class="roman">Daylight Saving Bill</span>, whereby the clocks would be changed by one hour according to the season. It failed when introduced into the House of Commons in 1908, but Willett persisted, gaining institutional support for his idea both in Britain and abroad. The bill was several times reintroduced before the First World War but never attracted quite enough support to be passed. Daylight saving was eventually enacted as a wartime production-boosting device in 1916, under the <span class="roman">Defence of the Realm Act</span>. It was subsequently adopted in many other countries.<br>
<br>William Willett junior did not live to see daylight saving become law. Early in 1915, hearing of fraud in the Matallana Company, he travelled to Spain to unravel its difficulties. He caught a chill on the journey home, developed influenza, and rallied long enough to be taken home to The Cedars, Camden Park, Chislehurst; he died there on 4 March 1915. He left over &pound;500,000, but his sudden death so soon after his father's, coupled with an unsatisfactory will, left his affairs entangled. His son Herbert Willett took over the business but died in 1917. A memorial to William Willett junior was erected in Petts Wood.<br>
<br>The standing of urban speculative builders diminished in the second half of nineteenth-century Britain, but the Willetts were exceptions to this rule. In a construction world dominated by building contractors and professional architects, they turned out high-class houses of dignity, comfort, and real architectural merit by an old-fashioned method. They were the last of the great Victorian speculative builders.<br>
