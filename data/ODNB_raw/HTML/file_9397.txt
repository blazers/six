<span class="headword">Field,  William</span>  (1768&#150;1851), <span class="occ">Unitarian minister</span>, was born at Stoke Newington on 6 January 1768, the fifth son of eleven children born to John (1718/19&#150;1796) and Anne Field (1730/31&#150;1797). John Field was a prosperous medical practitioner in London, an active member of the Society of Apothecaries of London, and founder of the London Annuity Society. In 1753 he had married Anne, daughter of Thomas Cromwell, a grocer, and sister of Oliver Cromwell (1742?&#150;1821), solicitor and biographer of the lord protector. Another of John Field's sons was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9386/', "Henry Field (1755&#150;1837)")</script>. William Field got a good classical education, and while at school corresponded with his father in Latin. He studied for the ministry first at Homerton Academy in London, but left that institution for doctrinal reasons soon after the appointment of John Fell, whose assumption of the classical tutorship touched off a student rebellion and nearly a decade of intramural wrangling. In 1788 Field moved to Daventry Academy under Thomas Belsham, but left there when Belsham resigned in June 1789 after declaring his Unitarianism. Field thus completed the transition from his father's Calvinism.<br>
<br>In 1789 Field succeeded James Kettle as minister of the Presbyterian congregation at High Street Chapel, Warwick, where he was ordained on 12 July 1790. On this occasion Belsham gave the charge, and Joseph Priestley preached. Samuel Parr attended the service and the ordination dinner and met Priestley for the first time. Thus began also Field's close intimacy with Parr, a connection fostered by their common enthusiasm for classical studies. In 1791 he started a Sunday school, the first in Warwick, which led to a squabble with some local clergy, in which he was accused of bribing the children of Anglicans to attend his school. Always ready for a pamphlet war, he issued the first of many incisive polemics in which the dignity of style and the profusion of literary and classical illustration contrast curiously with the pettiness of the disputes. In the mid-1820s he added the charge of an old Presbyterian meeting-house at Kenilworth, conducting afternoon service there in addition to his Warwick duties. He remained in active duty for nearly sixty years, resigning Warwick in 1843 and Kenilworth in 1850.<br>
<br>In 1803 Field married Mary Wilkins (1784?&#150;1848), the daughter of a Baptist minister who had previously married one of Field's sisters. They had fourteen children, of whom eleven survived their parents. The eldest son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9382/', "Edwin Wilkins Field (1804&#150;1871)")</script>, solicitor and legal reformer, who played a central part in the passage of the <span class="roman">Dissenters' Chapels Act</span> of 1844, which secured Unitarian possession of buildings and endowments from orthodox challenge; when a testimonial of &pound;530 was given him for his service he applied it to the rebuilding of his father's chapel in Kenilworth.<br>
<br>Field's extensive correspondence was both erudite and racy; he was a genial host, and his conversation was very enjoyable, despite a constitutional deafness which was said to make his pulpit delivery eccentric, with &#145;singular, and sometimes unnatural tones&#146;  (<span class="italic">Royal Leamington Spa Courier</span>, 6 Sept 1851). He was a small man whom a perhaps prejudiced Samuel Parr, to whom Field was something of a Boswell, called &#145;a dwarf in stature but a giant in literature&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Inquirer</span>). Some of Field's published works grew out of the boarding-school he long maintained at Leam, where he lived, among them a textbook on the use of globes (1798; 7th edn, 1829) and a catechetical history of the four gospels and the book of <span class="roman">Acts</span>, with references to the scriptures in place of answers; this was first published in 1816 and was widely reprinted and admired across denominational boundaries. His principal works were his <span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; Samuel Parr</span> (1828), highly praised by Parr's modern biographer  (Derry, xv), and <span class="italic">An Historical and Descriptive Account of the Town and Castle of Warwick and &hellip; Leamington</span>, published anonymously in 1815; a modern editor of the work, Philip Styles, praised it for its depiction of a town undergoing profound economic and social transformation and for the Romantic sensibility of its topographical guidance.<br>
<br>Field died in Newbold Road, South Leamington, on 17 August 1851. He was buried on 22 August in a vault near the north front of the chapel in Warwick.<br>
