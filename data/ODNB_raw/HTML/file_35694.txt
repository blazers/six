<span class="headword">Read,  Clare Sewell</span>  (1826&#150;1905), <span class="occ">agriculturist and politician</span>, the eldest son of George Read of Barton Bendish Hall, Norfolk, and Sarah Ann, daughter of Clare Sewell, was born at Ketteringham on 6 November 1826. His ancestors had been tenant farmers in Norfolk since the end of the sixteenth century. He was educated privately at King's Lynn and from the age of fifteen until he was twenty learned practical agriculture on his father's farm. Before he was twenty-one he was managing the large farm of Kilpaison in Pembrokeshire, and was afterwards resident agent on the earl of Macclesfield's Oxfordshire estates. On returning to Norfolk in 1854, he took his father's farm at Plumstead, near Norwich, until 1865, when he succeeded a relative at Honingham Thorpe, and farmed about 800 acres there until Michaelmas 1896. In 1859 he married Sarah Maria, only daughter of J. Watson, former sheriff of Norwich; they had four daughters.<br>
<br>Read represented East Norfolk as a Conservative from July 1865 until the <span class="roman">Reform Act</span> of 1867, when Norfolk was divided into three constituencies. He sat for South Norfolk from 1868 to 1880, losing at the general election by one vote. He then declined to stand for North Lincolnshire and for Cambridgeshire, but in February 1884 was returned unopposed for West Norfolk; he retired from that seat in 1885, and in July 1886 unsuccessfully contested Norwich.<br>
<br>Read was an old-fashioned high-churchman who expressed the need for caution on the question of further extension of the parliamentary franchise. His object in entering parliament, however, was to represent the interests of farmers, especially tenant farmers, and in his speeches he confined himself to agricultural issues on which he was recognized as a distinguished authority. He commanded the attention of the house, and Gladstone made a point of listening to him and of himself referring to Read's views. In his first speech in parliament, in 1866, in support of Sir Fitzroy Kelly's motion for the repeal of the malt tax, Read suggested, as an alternative, a beer tax of 1<i>d</i>. per gallon on all beer that was sold; he also proposed that a licence should be paid by private brewers, and that all cottagers should be free to brew their own beer&#151;a concession later granted. He strenuously supported and promoted all the acts of parliament passed for the suppression of cattle plague and all other imported diseases among livestock; advocated the inalienable right of the occupier of the land to destroy ground game; persistently contended for the compulsory payment by landowners for tenant farmers' improvements to the land; argued that all property, and not land and buildings alone, should contribute to local as well as national taxes; and in 1876 carried a unanimous resolution in the House of Commons in favour of representative county boards.<br>
<br>In 1865 Read served on the cattle plague commission, and for twenty years sat on almost every agricultural committee of the House of Commons. In February 1874 he was appointed by Disraeli parliamentary secretary to the Local Government Board, but resigned in January 1876, when the government refused to extend the <span class="roman">Cattle Diseases Act</span> to Ireland. This, however, soon afterwards became law. On resigning his government appointment, he was presented by the farmers of England with a silver salver and a purse of &pound;5500 at a dinner given at the Cannon Street Hotel on 2 May 1876. When the duke of Richmond's royal commission on agriculture was appointed in June 1879, Read and Albert Pell were made assistant commissioners to visit the United States and Canada to inquire into and report on the conditions of agriculture there, particularly as related to the production of wheat for export to Europe. They were away six months and travelled 16,000 miles.<br>
<br>In 1848 Read won the Royal Agricultural Society's prize with an essay on the farming of south Wales, and in 1854 and 1856 obtained the society's prizes for similar reports on Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire. He contributed numerous other papers to the Royal Agricultural Society's <span class="italic">Journal</span>, and acted frequently as judge at the Royal, Smithfield, Bath and West of England, and other agricultural shows. He also wrote on Norfolk agriculture for the fourth edition of White's <span class="italic">History, Gazetteer and Directory</span> of that county (1883). In January 1866 he joined the Farmers' Club (founded in 1842), and was an active member until his death, frequently reading papers at meetings, serving on the committee, and acting as chairman for two years, once in 1868 and again in 1892 (the club's jubilee year). He was a member of the council of the central chamber of agriculture (of which he was chairman in 1869) and of the Smithfield Club. He also served as a Norfolk magistrate.<br>
<br>When his intention to give up farming in Norfolk was made known, a county committee organized a fund for presenting Read with his portrait. In his later years he lived in London at 91 Kensington Gardens Square, where he died on 21 August 1905, but he was buried in his native soil at Barton Bendish.<br>
<br>Read was excellent company and a well-known and genial figure in farming circles. He was fond of the country, and particularly of shooting, and was said to detest town life and late hours. With his practical experience of farming and of land management he was one of the first members of parliament to speak with authority on agricultural matters, although his own background was more that of the squirearchy than of the ordinary farmers.<br>
