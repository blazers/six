<span class="headword">Falle,  Philip</span>  (1656&#150;1742), <span class="occ">historian and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in St Saviour, Jersey, the son of Thomas Falle (1629&#150;1673), farmer, centenier or parish constable of St Saviour from 1658 to 1660, and his wife, Marie Dumaresq (<i>d</i>. before 1670). The eldest of four surviving brothers and half-brothers and two sisters descended from an old Jersey family, Falle was sent to England at an early age, and educated at a school kept by a Transylvanian in Great Queen Street in London and then by a Mr Dalgarno, probably George Dalgarno, in Oxford. Late in 1669 he was entered at Exeter College, Oxford, but he followed his tutor at Exeter, Narcissus Marsh, to St Alban's Hall on Marsh's becoming principal there in 1673. He proceeded MA from St Alban's Hall in 1676, and was ordained deacon by Bishop Ralph Brideoake of Chichester in 1677, and priest by Brideoake's successor, Dr Guy Carleton, in 1679.<br>
<br>In 1681 Falle was presented to Trinity parish in Jersey by the governor, Sir John Lanier. The stipend was about &pound;40 a year. Falle also inherited an estate from his father and served the religious needs of the island's garrison, then without a chaplain. In 1687 Lord Jermyn, Lanier's successor, took Falle back to England with him as tutor for his only son. Falle lived at Rusbrook, Suffolk, Jermyn's country seat, until he returned to Jersey in 1689. In 1690 he received the appointment of St Saviour's.<br>
<br>As a clergyman Falle was a member of the states of Jersey, where he played an active role. A zealous English patriot and francophobe, he was an obvious choice for the delegation sent by the states to beg assistance of William III against French raiders in 1692. He may have drafted the address as well. Falle and Nicholas Durrell, the advocate-general of Jersey, introduced by Jermyn, waited on William at Kensington on 6 February 1693 and also called upon government officials to press their case, succeeding in gaining more military supplies for Jersey. Falle was appointed chaplain-in-ordinary to the king in 1694, and in that capacity preached a sermon on 20 December on Queen Mary's death. He eventually settled in England, and his Jersey parishioners were served by a series of curates. He received a stall at Durham Cathedral in January 1700 and a living at Shenley, near St Albans, in 1709, upon which he resigned his living in Jersey.<br>
<br>During his mission in 1692 and 1693, Falle was struck by the ignorance of Jersey shown by the English people he met at the court and in London. Determining to make the island, and what he considered to be its fierce loyalty to the English crown, better known to public opinion, he wrote his most significant work, <span class="italic">An account of the Isle of Jersey, the greatest of the islands that are now the only remainder of the English dominions in France, with a new and accurate map of that island</span>. It appeared in two editions during his life, in 1694, dedicated to William, then greatly expanded with a substantial documentary appendix in 1734. It was based on materials collected by Falle's friend and parishioner the Jersey magistrate John Poingdestre and also benefited from contributions by Phillip Dumaresq, including the map. The 1734 edition included a letter from Falle's friend Philip Morant refuting the argument of John Selden's <span class="italic">Mare clausus</span> (1635) that the Channel Islands had always been an English possession. <span class="italic">An account of the Isle of Jersey</span> was strongly providentialist, emphasizing how God had defended Jersey from the French and in latter years from Catholicism. Falle also argued that Jersey and the Channel Islands generally were great economic and military assets to England in its struggle with France. Although undistinguished in style and marred by credulity, Falle's work, which included discussion of the island's institutions and natural history, was the first and for a long time the standard work on Jersey, reprinted as late as 1837. Falle contributed an account of the Channel Islands to Edmund Gibson's edition of William Camden's <span class="italic">Britannia</span> in 1722, and published several sermons, including one in Jersaise, mostly during the reign of William III. He also saw through the press <span class="italic">The History of the Last Campagne in the Spanish Netherlands, anno. Dom. 1693</span> (1693) by his friend and fellow Jerseyman the Revd Edward Dauvergne, contributing a fulsome letter of dedication to the duke of Ormond.<br>
<br>Falle travelled to France, and to the United Provinces as one of William's chaplains. On the continent he collected many printed music books. His music manuscripts included the only surviving works of Sainte-Colombe the younger, the French violist resident in Britain, of whom he may have been a student. Falle donated his printed music books, 266 items with substantial representation of music published in Antwerp, Amsterdam, and Venice, and his musical manuscripts, together with his catalogue, to the library of the dean and chapter of Durham. His other books he presented to the people of Jersey in 1736 together with money to build a library, although it was not built until 1742. Along with other donations, they have developed into the Jersey Library in St Helier.<br>
<br>Falle never married. His will reveals that he maintained a household in Durham, supervised by &#145;my agent and steward there &hellip; Mrs Elizabeth Robinson, wife of Mr Michael Robinson&#146;, who had &#145;been faithfull and diligent in my Business during many years&#146;, but that he lived at Shenley with his niece Judith Aubin  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/719, fols. 230<i>r</i>&#150;232<i>r</i>). He died at Shenley on 7 May 1742 and was buried on 12 May at St Botolph's, Shenley.<br>
