<span class="headword">Rathbone <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Reynolds]</span>,  Hannah Mary</span>  (1798&#150;1878), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born into a Quaker family at Ketley, near Wellington, Shropshire, on 5 July 1798, the fourth of seven children of Joseph Reynolds (<i>b</i>. 1768, <i>d</i>. after 1857), an ironmaster, who had married his own master's niece Deborah Dearman (1770&#150;1803). After their mother's death in childbirth the children were cared for by her sister Ann Dearman; Hannah Mary and her two sisters were educated at Mrs Herrick's school in Leicester. Hannah Mary Reynolds had been named after and was close to her father's half-sister Hannah Mary (1761&#150;1839), who in 1786 had married the prominent Liverpool Quaker cotton merchant <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23160/', "William Rathbone (1757&#150;1809)")</script>. The familial connections were strong, and on 8 April 1817 the young Hannah Mary Reynolds married the Rathbones' second son, Richard (1788&#150;1860). Nearly ten years older, he was now helping to run the family firm, and Hannah Mary initially felt isolated because of the long hours that her husband worked. The couple had three sons and three daughters, born over twenty years. The family lived first in Liverpool, and then outside the city.<br>
<br>Hannah Mary Rathbone was a talented artist. In the early 1830s she published drawings from Pinelli's etchings of Italian peasantry and contributed twenty paintings of birds to <span class="italic">The Poetry of Birds</span> (1833). Later she edited a poetry anthology on childhood: it featured many writers&#151;including Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, Hemans, &#145;L. E. L.&#146;, Scott, Tennyson, and Barrett&#151;as well as Rathbone herself. It was published in 1840 as &#145;by a lady&#146;, and in 1841 with a preface over Rathbone's own name. In 1858 she would bring out a collection of her own original but indifferent poetry.<br>
<br>Mother&#150;child relations were also central to Rathbone's most important publication, <span class="italic">The Diary of Lady Willoughby</span>. She had read many histories and memoirs of the civil war and adjacent periods, and in 1844 produced a diary&#151;fictitious, but based on the life of Elizabeth, Lady Willoughby, whose husband had supported parliament and then the royalists during the civil war and its aftermath. This covered the period from 1635 to 1648; a second volume (1848) took the story into the 1660s. Rathbone's Lady Willoughby is characterized by her devotion to her mother, husband, and children, as well as to her (moderate Anglican) faith; she takes a humanitarian rather than a partisan approach to political and religious conflict. While her personality reflects her creator's strong family ties and Quaker outlook, Rathbone also skilfully shows Lady Willoughby self-censoring some potential criticism of others.<br>
<br>The 1844 <span class="italic">Diary</span> came out anonymously, and the publisher, Thomas Longman, presented it with seventeenth-century typeface and binding. Some assumed it was a genuine diary, others attributed it to Southey, Lord John Manners, or John Murray, but a preface to the third edition (1845) explained its fictitious nature. The <span class="italic">Diary</span> went into several editions, the last in 1873. It fostered a minor vogue for first-person historical narratives in contemporary typefaces, notably Anne Manning's 1850 account of Mary Powell (Milton's first wife), and Thackeray's <span class="italic">Henry Esmond</span> (1852).<br>
<br>Rathbone said in 1845 that she wrote for relaxation. In 1852 she produced a life and letters of her paternal grandfather, the philanthropist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23433/', "Richard Reynolds (1735&#150;1816)")</script>, partly as a respite from family troubles. Financial difficulties in the mid-1840s had forced a return to Liverpool, but this had also aggravated the always fragile health of both Rathbone and her eldest daughter. Meanwhile the Rathbones' son Basil's business failures and drinking caused anguish and shame to his parents. By late 1853 both the invalid daughter and the long-estranged Basil were dead. On the other hand, financial improvements, helped by the profits from the <span class="italic">Diary</span>, had enabled the family to buy a country property, Woodcote. Rathbone lost her husband in 1860, and later moved to Garston in Liverpool. She died at her home there, Ivy Lodge in Aigburth, aged seventy-nine, of paralysis aggravated by apoplexy, on 26 March 1878.<br>
