<span class="headword">Cunningham, Sir  Hugh</span>  (1642/3&#150;1710), <span class="occ">local politician and merchant</span>, was apparently a descendant of one of the Ayrshire Cunninghams. However, since there are no references to his birth, and because contemporary sources and his coat of arms as recorded in the Lyon court allude to both the Craigend and the Cunninghamhead families, it has not been possible to identify his lineage. Cunningham was known in the city of Edinburgh from at least 1674, when, upon payment of &#145;fourscore ten pund Scots&#146;  (Edinburgh Guild register, 1675), he became an Edinburgh dean of guild. Burgess Hugh Cunningham quickly established himself as a successful Edinburgh merchant who, in middle age, embarked upon what was to become a notable political career, culminating in his service as lord provost. It is plain from the numerous documents recorded in the registers of deeds that Hugh or Hew Cunningham, merchant&#151;not to be confused with his Edinburgh contemporary and associate Hugh Cunningham, lawyer (witness to the subject's son Alexander's baptism in 1685)&#151;was already a relatively wealthy man when he settled in the city. From the evidence of personal bonds issued to notables such as Sir David Dunbar, Sir Godfrey McIntosh, and Sir John Ramsay, from numerous transactions relating to the import, processing, and sale of tobacco, his interest in a Leith comb manufactory, and references to his partnership with Sir James and William Dick of Braid, woollen merchants, it is plain that Cunningham prospered during the last years of pre-union Scotland.<br>
<br>Edinburgh merchants were the most influential local political figures in the community and it is hardly surprising that at the same time Cunningham was developing his business portfolio he also nurtured a political career. In November 1689 he was elected as one of the masters of Paul's Work (by this time the erstwhile pre-Reformation charitable institute had become a linen manufactory). In 1692 he was selected as one of two merchant councillors. By September of the following year he was not only a bailie of the city but also master of the Company of Merchants of the city of Edinburgh. A water bailie of Leith in 1694, his influential civic positions also involved him in perennial matters such as the appointment of two &#145;toune officers weekly for keeping the streits free from beggars&#146;  (Edinburgh town council minutes, 1 Nov 1693, Armet, <span class="italic">Extracts &hellip; 1689&#150;1701</span>). During this period the city's finances were none too healthy and to pay creditors the authority borrowed money from some of its more affluent citizens, Hugh Cunningham offering a bond of &pound;4000  (Edinburgh town council minutes, 16 May 1694, Armet, <span class="italic">Extracts &hellip; 1689&#150;1701</span>). It was in this same year that the Canongate recorded his free entry as one of its burgesses &#145;for most generous and good deeds&#146;. By 1698 he had risen to the significant position of first bailie of Edinburgh and, following his second year (1701) as master of the Merchant Company, he achieved the pinnacle of his political career when he became lord provost of Edinburgh on 6 October 1702.<br>
<br>The period of his tenure as lord provost was not a momentous one for the city, then a &#145;dull deflated capital, burdened with debts and poor&#146;  (Armet, <span class="italic">Extracts &hellip; 1701&#150;1718</span>, vii). However, his term did see several turbulent events. The successful resolution of a dispute with the professors of Edinburgh University was contrasted by riots in 1703 and again in 1704. The latter tumult arose from the legal decision to release the crew of the English vessel the <i>Worcester</i> (convicted of piracy upon a Scottish ship), and resulted in the mob lynching of the ship's captain and his two mates. Although Scotland and Edinburgh were shortly to embark upon the adventure of the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> and then the Jacobite rising of 1715, there is nothing to indicate that Cunningham was other than a loyal Scottish merchant, keen to exploit commercial opportunity and happy to serve his fellow citizens. To that end, in addition to his public offices which also included service as baron of Easter and Wester Portsburgh and commissioner to the general assembly of the Church of Scotland, he acted as treasurer to the Scottish Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge, was credited with the foundation of the Merchant Maiden Hospital which opened in 1707, and endowed the Kilmaurs parish school in Ayrshire with a tenement of land.<br>
<br>On 15 December 1681 Cunningham married Anna Moncrieff (<i>c</i>.1660&#150;1734) in Edinburgh. By 1697 the couple had five children (Alexander, Helen, Catherine, Hew, and Mathew). By the same year he had subscribed &pound;500 to the ill-fated Darien scheme and was on his way to establishing the financial base that a decade later allowed him to purchase a six-room house in Lothians Land, off Edinburgh's High Street, and lend Edinburgh town council &pound;24,000 Scots to service the authority's debt. In the light of these achievements it is little wonder that he received a knighthood, in 1702; the only curiosity is that he was installed as &#145;of Milcraig and Livingstone&#146;, was freely referred to as &#145;of Craigend&#146;, yet lived his last year or so and was finally interred as Sir Hugh Cunningham of Bonniton.<br>
<br>In October 1704 Sir Hugh petitioned the town council &#145;ernestlie&#146;, desiring that he be the first to be granted a burial plot in a newly established section of Greyfriars burial-ground now known as the Covenanters' Prison. Upon his death at the age of sixty-seven on 16 December 1710, he was interred in the desired ground. The man and his passing are marked by a suitably ornate and substantial 30-foot stone monument that dominates the avenue and southern wall of the kirkyard.<br>
