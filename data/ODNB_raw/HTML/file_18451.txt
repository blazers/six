<span class="headword">Mayo,  Charles</span>  (1792&#150;1846), <span class="occ">educational reformer</span>, was born at 1 Hammett Street, Aldgate, London, on 9 June 1792, the eldest son in the family of four sons and one daughter of Charles Mayo (1754&#150;1814), a solicitor who practised in London, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1837), daughter of William Knowlys and sister of Newman Knowlys, recorder of London. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18455/', "Elizabeth Mayo")</script> was his sister; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18452/', "Charles Mayo (1767&#150;1858)")</script>, the Anglo-Saxon scholar, was his cousin. Educated at Henley-on-Thames grammar school and Merchant Taylors' School, he proceeded to St John's College, Oxford, where he held a scholarship from 1810 to 1813. Taking second class honours in classics, he was elected to a law fellowship in 1813, graduating BA in 1814, BCL in 1817, and DCL in 1822. He was admitted at Gray's Inn in 1814 but deafness forced him to give up his intention to read for the bar. In August 1817 he became headmaster of Bridgnorth grammar school, Shropshire. He was ordained deacon by the bishop of Oxford later in that year and priest in June 1819, resigning from his headmastership in July 1819.<br>
<br>A friendship with John Synge of Glanmore Castle, co. Wicklow (1788&#150;1845), an Irish landowner and, like Mayo, an evangelical in religion, was to be crucial in forming Mayo's life's work. Synge's favourable impression of the model school run by the Swiss educationist Pestalozzi, which he had visited during his grand tour, encouraged Mayo to see the establishment for himself. In 1819 he joined Pestalozzi at Yverdun, near Lake Geneva, as English chaplain, bringing with him a number of pupils. Although Pestalozzi's school was then past its peak, the experience convinced Mayo of the value of both the man and his methods. He returned to London in 1822 determined to promote Pestalozzi's ideas in England. An early subscriber and committee member of the London Infant School Society (founded in 1824), he delivered two lectures at the Royal Institution in May 1826 on the life of Pestalozzi (later published as a memoir, 2nd edn 1828) and on infant schools, <span class="italic">Observations on the Establishment and Direction of Infants' Schools</span> (1827). In the latter he commented that &#145;infancy is a rich but unclaimed waste&#146;; learning began with the child's own experiences and could be developed before children entered the monitorial schools which at that time provided elementary education. Object lessons, a method widely popularized by his sister, were central to his principles for teaching young children, which he later described in a treatise produced in collaboration with his sister, <span class="italic">Practical Remarks on Infant Education for the Use of Schools and Private Families</span> (1837).<br>
<br>In 1822 Mayo opened a school in Epsom, which his mother helped him to run, to demonstrate how Pestalozzi's ideas could be applied to the teaching of children from the upper classes. In September 1826 he became headmaster of Cheam School, a well-established private boarding-school for boys aged between seven and eighteen, in succession to James Wilding (1781&#150;1863). Mayo initially ran the school in association with his mother and sister as a family enterprise; the creation of a domestic environment, headed by a father figure, was regarded as a necessary aspect of moral education. In the early years of his headmastership he was remembered as a kindly figure who maintained affectionate, informal relations with the boys, admitting them to his family circle. &#145;The method of Pestalozzi is, in essence, the application of Christianity to the business of education&#146;, Mayo stated  (Mayo, <span class="italic">Memoir of Pestalozzi</span>, 1828, 28), and religious instruction was an essential part of the curriculum. During the late 1820s and early 1830s Cheam School enjoyed notable patronage from aristocratic parents of evangelical views, who disliked the absence of vital religion in the traditional public schools. Among those who sent sons there were the Glyn, Pakenham, Ryder, and Waldegrave families. Opposing the mere mechanical inculcation of factual knowledge, Mayo tried to carry out Pestalozzi's ideal of developing all the faculties. Gymnastics, which he considered essential to physical health, were part of the curriculum. A school magazine established in 1832 testified to the self-expression which was encouraged among the boys. Charles Reiner, a German and former assistant to Pestalozzi, who taught at Cheam until 1849, was mainly responsible for the innovative teaching of mathematics and natural sciences.<br>
<br>In June 1831 Mayo married Mary Shepheard (1799&#150;1877), who with her younger sisters ran a school for girls in Notting Hill after the death in 1824 of their father, Edward Walwyn Shepheard, left them in straitened circumstances. Soon after his marriage Mayo's mother and sister left Cheam, the latter going on to run the Home and Colonial Infant School Society's training college, in which Mayo took a close interest. Either through poor health or, it was said, the influence of his wife, Mayo presented a sterner figure to the boys in the later years of his headmastership. There had always been an inherent conflict between Pestalozzi's optimistic view of young children and the evangelical sense of their sinfulness. Mayo's free use of the cane was remarked upon by later generations of his pupils; and Hugh Childers, who entered the school in 1836, remembered a regime whose obsession with the wickedness of boys promoted sneaking and spying among them. It was suggested that he was not always a good judge of assistant masters. The choice of his brother-in-law, Henry Shepheard (1809&#150;1878), as his successor was not a fortunate one. Mayo died at Cheam on 23 February 1846, leaving a widow, daughter, and two sons. He was buried at Cheam, and a tablet erected by his pupils and friends described his work as illustrating &#145;both in theory and practice, the blessings of an education based upon Intellectual Development, Scriptural Teaching, and Christian Influence&#146;.<br>
