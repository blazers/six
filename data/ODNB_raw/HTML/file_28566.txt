<span class="headword">Wallingford,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1492), <span class="occ">abbot of St Albans</span>, was almost certainly born at Wallingford, Berkshire, where the Benedictine priory was a dependent cell of St Albans. It was probably under Prior John Stoke's patronage that he entered St Albans as a novice, during the 1430s. Following his profession he was sent to Oxford to study at Gloucester College. It appears he was intended to study canon law&#151;later he demonstrated considerable legal knowledge when defending himself against charges of embezzlement&#151;but he remained at the university for no more than five years and left without taking a degree: Abbot John Whethamstede later observed that all Wallingford had acquired at Oxford was &#145;a taste for money&#146;  (Riley, 2.130). Wallingford returned to St Albans in the early 1440s and under John Stoke, newly elected abbot, was promoted to a succession of senior obedientiary posts: by 1445 he held five offices simultaneously, including archdeacon, cellarer, bursar, forester, and sub-cellarer, and before 1451 he had also been appointed official-general. Following Stoke's death in December 1451, Wallingford was one of three candidates proposed for the abbacy. However, when it became clear that the former abbot, John Whethamstede, was prepared to resume office he withdrew his candidacy.<br>
<br>During the vacancy following Stoke's death, Wallingford and his brother Thomas were investigated for their involvement in the embezzlement of 1000 marks from conventual funds, a crime to which Stoke himself had confessed shortly before his death. Stoke claimed he had entrusted the brothers with the money and that they had concealed it in a chest in the dormitory. The chest was recovered, but it was found to contain no more than 250 marks. Wallingford's suspected dishonesty was recalled in 1453, when he was required to render accounts for his various offices. These revealed significant losses, and suggested that Stoke and his officials had been guilty of widespread mismanagement. Wallingford withdrew in disgrace, and Whethamstede began an investigation into his predecessor's administration. His findings confirmed that so substantial a fall in income could have occurred only through maladministration or outright embezzlement. Wallingford responded with the scholarly but evasive argument that it was inevitable for a monk charged with such worldly responsibilities to fall in with the &#145;unrighteous followers of Mammon&#146;  (Riley, 2.111&#150;12). He also secured the support of other senior monks, and the protection of some distinguished noble patrons, including Edmund Tudor, earl of Richmond, and Lord and Lady Sudeley, who prevailed upon Whethamstede to judge him leniently. Presenting new accounts to Whethamstede, Wallingford appears to have made a partial admission of guilt, but claimed that the amount lost was considerably less than had been alleged. Whethamstede again seems to have been persuaded, and even commended Wallingford for his business skills. However, in 1454, when Whethamstede requested a contribution from Wallingford towards a clerical tenth, Wallingford now denied that he had any money at all, although in his own revised accounts he had claimed to hold over &pound;160. Whethamstede accused him of perjury, but once again Wallingford seems to have been saved from any punitive actions by the intercession of others. Whethamstede was persuaded to maintain Wallingford in his offices, provided that he raised at least &pound;200 or &pound;300 from them within the next two years.<br>
<br>Despite these repeated allegations, Wallingford remained in office throughout the 1450s and 1460s. He was again proposed as a candidate for the abbacy following Whethamstede's death in 1465, but the prior, William Albon, was preferred. Under Albon, Wallingford himself became prior, an office he held for over eleven years. Then, following Albon's death in 1476, he again declared his candidacy and this time was elected abbot on 5 August.<br>
<br>Wallingford's rule as abbot has long been seen as indicative of the corruption and decadence into which English monasteries fell in the century before the dissolution. His register reveals that he misappropriated conventual resources, maintained his own liveried retainers at the community's expense, and granted offices and rents to friends, family, and members of the local nobility. His register also suggests he frequently abused his ecclesiastical authority in the local community, making fraudulent charges against testators, granting a licence for mass to be celebrated in an alehouse, and deposing the prioress of Sopwell on false grounds of heresy. Moreover Cardinal John Morton, in a monition issued on 5 July 1490, accused Wallingford of wide-ranging financial mismanagement, simony, usury, and wasting the goods of the monastery to the value of 8000 marks. He claimed Wallingford had misgoverned St Albans and its dependent communities, attacking those monks who wished to lead a religious life, and interfering in the elections of the nunneries and priories under his jurisdiction, and he made serious allegations concerning Wallingford's sexual corruption and his tolerance of moral laxity in others, accusing the abbot of soliciting the wife of a St Albans man, and tolerating the affair between a local woman and Thomas Sudbury, formerly a monk of St Albans who was now prior of St Andrew's, Northampton. Although it is difficult to substantiate many of these claims, a number of the documents in Wallingford's register give credence to the accusations surrounding his management of the dependent cells.<br>
<br>The evidence of Wallingford's misrule should not, however, be allowed to obscure his wider achievements as abbot. His relationship with his nunneries may have broken down, but he seems to have maintained a stable relationship with the other cells, and was credited with settling a long-standing dispute between the mother house and the priory at Tynemouth. He also made significant improvements to the abbey buildings, spending over &pound;8000 in the completion of the new bakehouse, chapter house, and library which had been begun under Whethamstede; and adding costly new decorations to the interior of the abbey church. He also developed a considerable public reputation as spokesman for his order and even, surprisingly, as a reformer. A leading figure in the Benedictine general chapters, he presided at their meetings, and at least once, in 1480, served as visitor for all the Benedictine houses in the diocese of Lincoln. Wallingford also appears to have been a generous patron of education and scholarship. He increased the number of his own monks who studied at Oxford and Cambridge, and supported as many as a dozen local boys through school and university. He seems also to have encouraged the work of the so-called &#145;St Albans printer&#146;, who established a press&#151;the earliest outside Westminster&#151;perhaps within the abbey precincts, <i>c</i>.1480.<br>
<br>Perhaps most significant, however, were Wallingford's efforts to defend and extend St Albans' privileges and exemptions from episcopal and royal control. Although the independence of the religious orders was coming under increasing criticism, Wallingford successfully blocked all efforts to interfere in the management of his community or its endowments. Throughout the 1480s he had maintained representatives at the curia, and secured a number of significant new privileges, including the right to assume episcopal orders for himself and his successors. Between 1487 and 1492 he also successfully defended the abbey from the efforts of Henry VII and Morton to deprive it of its exempt status and subject it to archiepiscopal visitation. In 1487 the king had secured the bull <span class="italic">Quantas in Dei ecclesias</span> from Innocent VIII empowering Morton to visit all exempt communities. Wallingford immediately dispatched a representative to the curia to secure confirmation of the abbey's exemptions and privileges&#151;on 6 February 1490 Morton received a bull warning him not to allow St Albans to suffer any further &#145;molestation&#146;. The archbishop then sent his own delegation to Rome, which apparently presented the pope with allegations of Wallingford's corruption and misrule. Consequently on 6 March 1490 Innocent issued another bull, declaring that it had recently been brought to his attention that in &#145;certain houses&#146; the monks &#145;are leading a wanton and most dissolute life&#146;  (Coulton, 4.515&#150;16), and ordering that these houses be subject to immediate visitation, without recourse to earlier exemptions. Morton received this bull on 24 April and appears to have made preparations for a visitation. However, Wallingford also responded quickly, dispatching another delegation to the curia to renew his appeal for confirmation of the abbey's privileges. Innocent appears to have responded verbally to both parties between 30 June and 4 July, remarkably giving his assent to the claims of each. Despite his bull of 6 March, Innocent seems to have offered the St Albans monks full confirmation of their privileges, and at the same time offered Morton notional support for his planned visitation. Consequently on 5 July, Morton issued Wallingford with his <span class="italic">Monitio</span>, detailing the allegations of corruption made in the curia, and calling upon him to reform his own house and the nunneries within thirty days, and his other communities within sixty days, or face archiepiscopal visitation. It appears that Wallingford then made further appeals to the pope, for on 30 July, Morton received notification that the monks' claims to exemption were under consideration by a committee of papal chaplains. This seems to have been enough to halt an immediate visitation, and in spite of a further bull from Innocent issued on the same day, declaring his support for monastic reform, there is no evidence to suggest that a visitation took place. With Thomas Sudbury's death in 1490, and Wallingford's own death two years later, Morton perhaps considered the imperative for reform at St Albans had been removed.<br>
<br>Wallingford died at St Albans between 23 May and 5 June 1492, and was probably buried in St Albans Abbey church.<br>
