<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Waller, Sir  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1598?, <em>d.</em> 1668), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer</span>, was born at Knole House, Kent, the son of Sir Thomas Waller (<i>d</i>. 1613) and his wife, Margaret Lennard. The parish register of Sevenoaks records his baptism as having taken place on 3 December 1598. Given sixteenth-century practice, Waller would almost certainly have been baptized no more than a few weeks after birth, but a little doubt is cast on the accuracy of the register by Waller's recorded age at matriculation at Oxford, which suggests that he was born in 1597 or even 1596, rather than 1598.<br>
<br>The Wallers, long established in Kent and of Norman descent, had been seated at Groombridge, near Tunbridge Wells, since the early fifteenth century. Sir Thomas, a younger son, had an active official career in the county and in 1604, through the patronage of the earl of Northampton, became lieutenant of Dover Castle. His wife, Margaret, was the daughter of Sampson Lennard of Chevening, Kent, and the lessee of Knole, whose wife, Margaret Fiennes, became Baroness Dacre in her own right in 1604. William Waller was thus part of a well-connected upper gentry family with aristocratic links which the Wallers were&#151;to judge from the name of Waller's sister, Fenes&#151;anxious to preserve. His cousins, close or more distant, included the parliamentarians <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28557/', "Sir Hardress Waller")</script> and Lord Dacre, and the royalist and poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28556/', "Edmund Waller")</script>.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsandeducation"></a>Early years and education</h2>The &#145;stormy sea&#146;  (&#145;Recollections&#146;, 103) of Waller's life was filled with escapes from danger that he saw as evidence of God's protecting providence and as signs that he had been preserved to be an active instrument of God's purpose. As a child he had narrow escapes from a casually discharged bullet, from drowning, and in a fall from his horse. Later, as he was about to leave for Oxford, he fell dangerously ill with pleurisy and &#145;hardly escaped the danger of itt&#146;  (&#145;Experiences&#146;, Wadham College, Oxford, 9). He nevertheless matriculated safely at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, on 2 December 1612, when his age was recorded as fifteen, but shortly afterwards migrated to Hart Hall. He left without taking a degree, and on his return home was again providentially preserved when, after he contracted smallpox, an eminent doctor intervened to prevent the administration of potentially lethal medicine.<br>
<br>Waller's education continued in Paris, where he learned fencing and the management of &#145;the great horse&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.814). Later he went to Italy, where his practical military formation began. He served with the English volunteers who arrived in late 1617 to aid the Venetians in their siege of Gradisca, near Trieste, in their war against piratical Christian refugees from the Turks. His fellows in the enterprise included representatives of old English military families, notably Sir John Vere, with whom he shared another providential delivery when a &#145;neere shotte&#146; fell between them as they &#145;sate close together by the battery&#146;  (&#145;Recollections&#146;, 108). Waller's Italian travels took him beyond battlefields to Venice, Florence, Padua, and Bologna, and it has been suggested that his later &#145;vanity in furniture&#146; (ibid., 131; Adair, 7) was formed on this Italian expedition, while in 1645 the connection was recalled by an abortive proposal that he return to Venetian service. Waller's Italian venture had thus grounded his military education and introduced him to English professional soldiers, and had also widened his cultural horizons.<br>
<br>In 1620 Waller left England again, one of the small band of Englishmen who actively rallied to the support of James I's daughter Elizabeth, the &#145;winter queen&#146; of Bohemia. For Waller she was to remain &#145;that queen of women &hellip; whom I had the honour to serve at Prague in the first breaking out of the German warr&#146;  (<span class="italic">Vindication</span>, 213&#150;14). He and Ralph Hopton, the future royalist commander, were members of the troop of horse sent to Prague to act as her life guard. After the defeat of the Bohemian army at the battle of the White Mountain (8 November 1620) they escorted the pregnant queen through the snow in her flight to Frankfurt. On this expedition too Waller had providential escapes, from Cossacks of the imperial army and from shipwreck on his way home to England. The episode had furthered his military education and demonstrated his commitment to an active protestantism.<h2>
<a name="Adomesticinterval"></a>A domestic interval</h2>When Waller came of age he inherited a substantial income from the prisage and butlerage on wine entering the kingdom, a grant previously held by his grandmother and his father which brought him between &pound;1000 and &pound;3000 a year. He was thus already comfortably established economically, and his standing was reinforced when on 20 June 1622 he was knighted by James I. He was then described as of Brenchley, Kent, where his mother held the manor of Barnes, some 10 miles from Groombridge.<br>
<br>On 12 August 1622 Waller married Jane Reynell (<i>d</i>. 1633), the only daughter and heir of Sir Richard Reynell of the Middle Temple and Forde House, Wolborough, Devon, and his godly wife, Lucy Brandon (<i>d</i>. 1652). The Reynells were an old Devon family, and Sir Richard devoted much of the proceeds of his profitable career at the exchequer to extending his estates in the county. The young couple lived at Forde House, and in 1622 Reynell granted Waller an annuity of &pound;133 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>., and settled land on them after his and his wife's deaths. Jane gave birth to a son, Richard, in 1631, and a daughter, Margaret, in 1633 before dying in Bath in May 1633. Waller commissioned a splendid monument to her in Bath Abbey in which he himself was represented in armour beside her. She was, he said, &#145;a vertuous discreet loving and beloved wife&#146;  (&#145;Experiences&#146;, Wadham College, Oxford, 55). Sir Richard Reynell died the next year, and was followed in 1636 by the child Richard.<br>
<br>In his wife and son Waller had lost &#145;very deare blessings&#146;  (&#145;Recollections&#146;, 127), but he resolved to marry again and moved to London to seek &#145;a religious woman, or none&#146;, a wife who would be &#145;an help to me in the way of [God's] service&#146;  (ibid.). God in his providence directed him to Anne Finch, a daughter of Thomas Finch, first earl of Winchilsea, an intrepid and aggressively puritan young woman. At her suggestion they &#145;sett a day apart to seeke God&#146; to assure themselves of His blessing, and indeed after a somewhat troubled start arising from &#145;some little differences in &hellip; natures, and judgments&#146;, the marriage proved happy. She was &#145;a deare and sweet Comforter&#146;, said Waller: &#145;I may say wee were but as one soul, in two bodyes&#146;  (ibid., 128, 131). Four children were born to them, two sons who lived to unsatisfactory adulthood and two daughters.<br>
<br>At first Sir William and Lady Waller lived in London, but on 23 May 1638 he acquired Winchester Castle and forest lands in Hampshire, and they thereupon set about repairing the castle; more providential deliverances ensued, in the shape of escapes from falling masonry. Waller also demonstrated a keen eye for his own property rights. In later life he admitted to &#145;a covetuous desire to gaine a good bargaine&#146;  (&#145;Recollections&#146;, 130), and saw God's chastising hand in the troubles that arose from such covetously inspired ventures as his attempt to supplant, by legal but sharp practice, the previous possessor of the market of Newton Abbot, Devon, which led to &#145;all that trouble &hellip; in Kings Bench&#146;  (ibid.). He was soon embroiled in similar trouble in Hampshire. In 1639 he instigated twenty-eight suits against local people who had cut wood from his forest at West Bere, as they had customarily done, to fulfil their obligation to repair a nearby beacon. They petitioned the privy council for relief, and met with a sympathetic reception  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1639</i>, 215).<br>
<br>Before the civil war Waller's life seems to have been confined to personal and domestic matters, although on 21 November 1632 he had been admitted to Gray's Inn. He was not a member of parliament nor, apparently, active with the county militia; he was an inactive justice of the peace; and he played no part in the Scottish wars. When in later life he looked back on his &#145;retired way&#146; in these years he observed with some complacency,<blockquote>I &hellip; desired no greater preferment than to be mine own man. GOD hath blessed me with a competent fortune, and given me a minde (it is his gift) fitted to enjoy that blessing. In that retired way, I enjoyed myself freely. (<span class="italic">Vindication</span>, 107)</blockquote>That this was no false boast is suggested by the depth of feeling with which he later wrote of the pleasures of country life: the goods that earth and wealth brought were to be enjoyed so long, he said, as we do not &#145;bottom &hellip; our selves&#146; on them or abandon responsibilities  (<span class="italic">Divine Meditations</span>, 88&#150;9). Only in November 1640 did he seek&#151;and at first fail to achieve&#151;election to parliament, and not until 3 May 1642, after a successful challenge to his opponent's election, was he finally approved as member for Andover  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 2.554).<h2>
<a name="Civilwar"></a>Civil war</h2>Once on the public stage Waller showed no uncertainty about the side he would choose in the imminent conflict. Royalists attributed his choice of parliament to his wife's influence or to resentment at a fine of &pound;1500 imposed on him in Star Chamber following a quarrel and exchange of blows with a kinsman of his first wife who, unfortunately for Waller, was a royal servant. In fact his grounds were religious and constitutional, although his intentions were unrevolutionary.<br>
<br>The religious background of the Waller family remains obscure, but Jane Reynell's mother, Lucy, was notably pious, while Anne Finch's puritan sympathies went beyond private prayer over their marriage to public support in 1640 of the reformer John Durie (whom Waller also supported). She was later to become notorious as a &#145;Wonderfull Lady&#146; who accompanied Waller on his campaigns (she was &#145;his pretty portable Armie&#146;) and preached to sometimes ungrateful troops who accused her of usurping &#145;the general's baton&#146; (<span class="italic">Mercurius Aulicus</span>, 6 Sept 1644, 1147; <span class="italic">CSP Venice</span>, <i>1643&#150;7</i>, 135). Waller's providential account of his own life, in which God preserved him to &#145;arise, and be doing&#146; in his cause  (<span class="italic">Divine Meditations</span>, 16&#150;17), was no retrospective construct but represented the guiding principle of his conduct once open conflict broke out. Yet his puritanism also appears to have been less aggressive and unshaded than his wife's. He was suspicious of outward displays of religiosity for public effect, scenting hypocrisy; he was not always an enthusiastic sermon-goer; and he later regretted that he had allowed professional criteria to outweigh godliness in appointing officers.<br>
<br>Politically, once in parliament Waller was &#145;an active person against the prerogative&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.814). Even in later disillusion he reaffirmed &#145;the constancy of [his] affection to the service of the Parliament&#146;  (<span class="italic">Vindication</span>, 317). He &#145;abhorred&#146; the war, but<blockquote>acted in it, as upon the defensive (which I thought justifiable), &hellip; ever with a wish &hellip; that the difference might end, rather in a peace than a conquest; &hellip; with saving of honour to King and Parliament, whereby both might have best. (ibid., 7&#150;8)</blockquote>He wanted to preserve the monarchy &#145;according to our laws and fundamental constitutions&#146;  (ibid., 316), and he hoped that &#145;GOD might have &hellip; his fear; the King his honour; the Houses of Parliament their priviledges; the people of the kingdome their liberties and proprieties&#146;  (ibid., 304). To defend this conservative equilibrium, however, it was necessary to resort to arms in 1642.<br>
<br>Waller quickly emerged as an active member of the House of Commons. Within days of taking his seat he was appointed to the committee to raise money for the war against the Irish rebels, a cause which he supported generously, and in June he contributed to an appeal to raise a parliamentary army. In July he volunteered to raise his own regiment of horse, and in August he was listed as colonel of one of parliament's six cavalry regiments. Yet this willingness is not enough to explain his speedy rise to military eminence. His own limited soldiering was twenty years in the past, nor did he come from a family with a strong military tradition. Wood attributed the authority so quickly granted to him to &#145;his great knowledge in martial affairs&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.814). This, taken in conjunction with Waller's insistence that his serious reading was such as would &#145;fit [him] for <i>action</i>, which is <i>the true end of all learning</i>, and for <i>the service of God</i>, which is <i>the true end of all action</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Divine Meditations</span>, 31), suggests that he profited from the ample supply of books on modern military practice available in England in the decades before the war. His &#145;Military discourse of the ordering of soldiers&#146; (a manuscript now lost) indicates an interest in military theory. That he chose to be represented in armour on his first wife's tomb in 1633, ten years after his palatine expedition, also suggests that he wished to retain his military persona. There is thus circumstantial evidence to explain his readiness for action in 1642. Thereafter his early successes undoubtedly contributed to his rapid rise.<br>
<br>In August 1642 Waller led his fledgeling forces to besiege the important arsenal and port of Portsmouth, then in royalist hands, and on 7 September the town surrendered. It was the first of his &#145;prosperous successes&#146;  (&#145;Recollections&#146;, 120), and one in which his talents for speed, night actions, and choice of ground were already manifest. Less happily, he was present at Edgehill on 23 October, where he fled with the rest of the cavalry when it broke under royalist attack. It has been suggested that this experience convinced him of the need to train a body of horse equal to that of the cavaliers, and also of the inadequacy of a passive defence against a cavalry charge, and hence to his practice of trotting forward to meet such an attack  (Adair, 39).<br>
<br>A string of successes now followed. On 1 December Waller took Farnham Castle, Surrey, strategically situated between Winchester and London. Then, with a substantial force of six mounted regiments, he advanced towards Winchester which he entered on 12 December after breaching the town walls; the next day the castle itself surrendered. Some 600 prisoners were taken and Waller yielded to the demands of his soldiers to sack the town. Technically he was justified, on the ground that its resistance had forced a storm, but he came to regret his decision and to see the destruction of his own house there as God's punishment for allowing the plunder of a city which, as one of its freemen, he should have protected. Winchester was soon recovered by the royalists but other successes followed. By the end of December Waller had also captured the town and castle of Arundel on his way to Chichester, which surrendered on 27 December. His reputation as &#145;William the Conqueror&#146; was established  (Clarendon, 2.215).<br>
<br>At the beginning of 1643 royalist successes in the west threatened the Severn valley and Bristol. On 11 February 1643 the earl of Essex appointed Waller major-general of the west. He reached Bristol after rapid night marches but with only 2000 men: this lack of men was to be a continuing source of friction between him and Essex. In late March, after another night march, he had a &#145;great victory&#146; when he took Malmesbury in Wiltshire, where the enemy quickly surrendered, in part persuaded by Waller's noisy pretended preparations for an assault under cover of darkness  (<span class="italic">A Letter from Sir William Waller &hellip; to &hellip; Essex &hellip; of a Great Victory &hellip; at Malmesbury, 23 Martii</span>, 1643). He had suffered, however, from the half-heartedness of some of his men and a shortage of ammunition, and it was a costly victory. Nevertheless his successes continued and on 24 March, after ferrying his men across the Severn, he and Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Massey demolished Lord Herbert's newly raised Welsh army at Highnam. Frustrated in his intention of moving on to Devon and Cornwall by a pacification treaty between both parties that he thought ill judged, Waller advanced into Monmouthshire, taking Monmouth and Chepstow. He then returned to Gloucester and from there supervised the taking of Tewkesbury by Massey on 12 April 1643.<br>
<br>These &#145;Victorious &hellip; Proceedings&#146;  (W. Waller, <span class="italic">The Victorious and Fortunate Proceedings of Sir William Waller</span>, 1643) were immediately followed by a sharp setback at Ripple Field at the hands of Prince Maurice, but Waller, though outmanned and outgunned, made a skilful retreat to Gloucester. He next advanced on Hereford and the city quickly fell on 25 April. Then, contrary to Essex's instructions to prevent the junction of the two royalist western armies, he besieged Worcester in order to consolidate control of the region, but he was forced to retire again to Gloucester at the end of May. Hereford too quickly returned to royalist hands, and Waller devoted himself to building up forces to confront the now combined royalist armies. He was hampered by shortages of men and lack of pay for those he had, by mutinous troops, and by a terrain unsuitable for action by his able cavalry. On 22 June 1643 he wrote from Bath to the speaker of the House of Commons,<blockquote>[I]t grieves our souls we dare not attempt what we desire. We must not hazard your trust like fools. Neither can we stay here and starve. We have long and often supplicated you for money find us but a way to live without it or else we humbly beg a present supply if not this horse will certainly disband which thought makes our hearts to bleed. (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 62/1A, fol. 128)</blockquote>Exasperation at the failure to provide money to enable his army to perform the services required of it was joined to worsening relations with the lord-general; henceforth the &#145;jealousies and peeks&#146; between Waller and Essex were public knowledge and a constant irritant from which, Waller observed, &#145;the country did suffer&#146; (B. Whitelocke, <span class="italic">Memorials of the English Affairs</span>, 1732, 90; &#145;Recollections&#146;, 120&#150;21). &#145;[T]he General thought himself undervalued&#146;, observed Whitelocke, &#145;and <i>Waller</i> was high enough. Nor did there want Pick-thanks to blow those Coals of jealousy; and this proved unhappy to the Parliament Affairs&#146;  (B. Whitelocke, <span class="italic">Memorials of the English Affairs</span>, 1732, 90).<br>
<br>Waller's uncomplicated record of successes was now over. The war's operations and demands grew more complex, and in the south and west the royalists had a very capable general in his friend Hopton. On 5 July 1643 they faced each other in an inconclusive battle at Lansdown, near Bath, which left the royalists in possession of the field but badly mauled, while Waller conducted another a skilful retreat. He pursued the royalists to Devizes, Wiltshire, but his army was in a deplorable condition, prone to panic, flight, and confusion. On 13 July Waller was unequivocally beaten at nearby Roundway Down and a &#145;miserable rout&#146; ensued. Losses of men, arms, and baggage were severe. It was, Waller said, &#145;the most heavy stroke of any that did ever befall me&#146; (Adair, 96; &#145;Recollections&#146;, 131). His army was effectively destroyed. He had been sure of success, and attributed his &#145;dismal defeat&#146; to Essex's &#145;heartburnings and jealoucies&#146; and failure to support him. It had &#145;pleas'd the Lord to turn my victory into mourning, and my glory into shame&#146;  (ibid., 123, 124).<br>
<br>Despite this disaster Waller made a triumphal entry into London on 25 July. His achievements were magnified, the Venetian envoy wrote sceptically, to raise civilian morale  (<span class="italic">CSP Venice</span>, <i>1643&#150;7</i>, 2). He had the support of the citizens and was allied with the Independents and others in the House of Commons anxious for active prosecution of the war and suspicious that Essex sought a soft peace with the king. On 27 July he was thanked by the house and recommended to Essex for command of a new army in the west, but the earl successfully dragged his feet for a month before granting the extensive authority requested by parliament on 26 August.<br>
<br>Waller meanwhile had taken the solemn league and covenant on 1 August, had been appointed to the new council of war designed to exercise unified oversight over operations, and had been ordered to send a force to relieve Gloucester. On 9 August his horse&#151;&#145;Waller's dogs&#146;  (Adair, 114)&#151;had brutally suppressed a demonstration for peace by London women. After a summer of acerbic political manoeuvring by the two generals and their supporters Essex's reputation revived, and on 7 October he threatened to resign and leave the country, claiming that Waller's commission was inconsistent with his authority. Parliament thereupon cancelled Waller's independent command, but on 4 November 1643, threatened by a new royalist army under Hopton in the west, they named him major-general of the troops raised by the newly associated counties of Hampshire, Sussex, Surrey, and Kent.<br>
<br>Waller was already prepared for action, and on 7 November he marched from Farnham to the royalist stronghold of Basing House. After several expensive assaults he was forced to abandon the siege by bad weather, the approach of royalist forces, and soldiers who, blaming him for heavy casualties, mutinied or deserted, leaving him &#145;enfeebled and abandoned&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Venice</span>, <i>1643&#150;7</i>, 46). On 13 December, however, he attacked royalist forces at Alton, and in a brutal fight centred around the church the royalist commander Colonel Bolles and at least forty of his men were killed and over 700 prisoners taken. On 6 January 1644 he took Arundel Castle, and then retired to winter quarters.<br>
<br>In late March 1644, now with some 8000 men, Waller advanced towards Winchester by way of Alresford. Confused though it was, the battle of Cheriton that followed on 29 March counted as a major parliamentarian victory, and although the royalists made an orderly retreat their casualties were severe. The battle demonstrated that parliament's cavalry was now the equal of the enemy's, and left parliamentarian forces in control of Hampshire and Wiltshire. Several months of marches and counter-marches by the armies of both sides followed until Essex and Waller parted angrily and Essex marched towards the west. On 29 June Waller, attempting to prevent the king from advancing into the eastern counties, faced him at Cropredy Bridge, near Banbury, and was decisively beaten. His London troops, with &#145;their old song of home, home&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1644</i>, 301), were mutinous. This hindered his pursuit of the victorious royalists, but Waller followed them on their circuitous march as best he could. &#145;I am of opinion&#146;, he wrote to the committee of both kingdoms, &#145;before this business be done, we shall be the longest winded army in England&#146;  (ibid., 303). Meanwhile he continued to beg parliament for men, money, and supplies. After the humiliating surrender of Essex's army at Lostwithiel, Cornwall, on 2 September he was too weak to prevent the king's return to Oxford. On 27 October, however, his men performed with distinction at the second battle of Newbury. After the ensuing winter lull he campaigned again in the west where he and Cromwell, who served under him, had some success, notably at Devizes in March 1645, but he was still beset by mutinous and disorderly troops and a shortage of money.<br>
<br>It was Waller's last campaign. The ordinance of 17 February 1645 creating the New Model Army under the command of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9092/', "Sir Thomas Fairfax")</script> largely abolished the old structure of divided armies under competing and quarrelling commanders, and the self-denying ordinance of 3 April required members of parliament to resign their military offices. Waller left the army disillusioned. He felt &#145;slighted and disesteemed&#146; by his mutinous troops and frustrated by the &#145;discouragements&#146; of parliament (Gardiner, 2.192; <span class="italic">Egmont MSS</span>, 1.237).<h2>
<a name="Disillusiondisgraceandrevival"></a>Disillusion, disgrace, and revival</h2>Waller, now increasingly identified with the presbyterians, continued to be an active member of the committee of both kingdoms, of which he was a founding member, and of the council of state. He had not abandoned all hopes of a revived military career. Although he refused to consider command in Ireland when it was mooted in December 1645, citing his previous &#145;discouragements&#146;, he was at the same time, from October 1645 to March 1646, engaged in detailed negotiations with the Venetians to raise and command a substantial force for amphibious operations in the eastern Mediterranean. Nothing came of these plans, and for a time prosperity returned at home. Waller was again able to enjoy his &#145;estate, and the comforts of [his] family&#146;. Winchester Castle was restored to him; in December 1645 the House of Commons voted him an annuity of &pound;2500 and a barony was suggested; and in July 1646 parliament voted payment of &pound;7307 due in wages. He was, he confessed, &#145;puffed upp&#146; and felt unduly secure (&#145;Recollections&#146;, 132; B. Whitelocke, <span class="italic">Memorials of the English Affairs</span>, 1732, 182; <span class="italic">Calendar of the &hellip; Committee for Compounding</span>, 1.794). As a member of parliament's committee for Irish affairs he sought to persuade disbanding soldiers to re-enlist for Irish service, and in March and April 1647 he was one of the commissioners dispatched by parliament to Saffron Walden to persuade the restive soldiers to do so. As tension between army and parliament escalated Waller was one of the eleven members of the House of Commons accused on 16 June of attacking the rights of subjects and soldiers and fomenting a new war. When the Independent members of both houses left London to take refuge with the army in July, Waller remained behind with the presbyterian majority and was appointed to its committee of safety. After the triumphant return of the Independents he fled to France. His ship was intercepted by a parliamentarian frigate but he nevertheless reached Calais safely on 17 August 1647, whence he sailed to Flushing with &pound;46 in his pocket. He had already prudently sent household goods to Rotterdam. Later he received some of his English rents, and when his wife and family joined him they brought &pound;500. They settled first at Leiden and then at The Hague, where he was able to wait once again on Elizabeth of Bohemia.<br>
<br>&#145;Banishment&#146; was only the first of the &#145;chastisements&#146; that God visited on Waller's &#145;puffed upp &hellip; presumption&#146; of good fortune: &#145;imprisonment, sickness, the death of [his] wife, poverty&#146; followed  (&#145;Recollections&#146;, 132). A vote of 27 January 1648 disabled him from sitting in parliament, but it was annulled on 3 June and he returned prematurely to England. Excluded and confined after Pride's Purge on 6 December, he was arrested on 12 December on charges of inviting the Scots into England and conspiring with Queen Henrietta Maria.<br>
<br>For Waller, politics had become a &#145;labyrinth&#146;  (<span class="italic">Vindication</span>, 224). He passed the next ten years &#145;[i]n prisons frequent&#146; and in trying to negotiate his way past suspicion and entrapment in &#145;so insnaring a time&#146;  (&#145;Recollections&#146;, 104, 120). He spent eighteen months as a prisoner at St James's Palace before being moved to Windsor Castle and finally to Denbigh Castle in north Wales. He was not ill-treated, and he successfully evaded attempts by &#145;false brethren&#146;  (ibid., 116) to trap him into criminal indiscretion. Thanks to God's special mercy, he said, &#145;I came off with an intire innocency, not only uncondemned, but unaccused&#146;  (ibid., 105). He asserted the integrity and freedom of the captive whose soul, abandoning worldly ambition, walked with God, yet he felt the disgrace of imprisonment and the affront to status keenly: the language of ignominy, of being in &#145;an obscure base condition&#146;, of being the prey of malice and jealousy, is pervasive  (<span class="italic">Divine Meditations</span>, 66). One of the few consolations of his imprisonment was the resource and courage of Lady Anne, who found her way over the Welsh mountains to Denbigh &#145;disguised in mean apparell&#146; and whose &#145;sweet converse and behaviour&#146; lightened his sufferings  (&#145;Recollections&#146;, 104&#150;5). He employed his time in writing his <span class="italic">Vindication &hellip; of Sir William Waller</span> (1793), in which he defended himself against charges of deserting his &#145;first principles&#146; and aligning himself with &#145;malignants&#146;, of attempting to &#145;break the Army&#146; and ignite a new war, of transporting &#145;great summs of mony&#146; to the Netherlands and accepting a commission from the prince of Wales, and of implication in the second civil war  (<span class="italic">Vindication</span>, 5&#150;6). The catalogue reveals the distrust in which he was now held by non-presbyterians. Even after his release in early 1652 he remained at risk.<br>
<br>Lady Anne died in Wales and Waller sought a third wife. He found a &#145;rich &hellip; blessing&#146; in Anne, Lady Harcourt (<i>d</i>. 1661) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70274/', "Waller, Anne, Lady Waller")</script>], widow of Sir Simon Harcourt, who was killed in Ireland in 1643. They married on 13 April 1652 and were, Waller said, &#145;not only one flesh, but one spirit; one in our affections, judgments, wayes, ends, (as if wee had been cut out of one and the same peece)&#146;  (&#145;Experiences&#146;, Wadham College, Oxford, 59). His material fortunes also improved, although in the 1650s he was embroiled for years in proceedings against the customs commissioners over his grant of prisage. Nevertheless he now had access both to that income and to his rents. In 1656 he sold the slighted ruins of Winchester Castle to the town corporation. In 1654 he had bought Osterley House, Middlesex, with some 758 acres. He raised &pound;5000 by mortgages on the property, but in 1663 he sold half his acreage for &pound;5250 with which he paid off much of the debt. He had thus not abandoned his entrepreneurial ways, although he had also made a vow in thanksgiving on his third marriage to devote a tenth of the income from his estate to &#145;pious uses&#146;  (&#145;Recollections&#146;, 133). His failure to observe this vow led God, who would &#145;never suffer [him] to sin prosperously&#146;, justly to punish him by taking Lady Anne from him  (&#145;Experiences&#146;, Wadham College, Oxford, 62). She died in 1661; in the nine years of their marriage she bore Waller three children, cared solicitously for the children of his second marriage, and was an intelligent and godly partner to her husband, to whom she brought &#145;blessing and happiness&#146;  (&#145;Recollections&#146;, 133).<br>
<br>In the uncertain 1650s Waller evaded implication in Penruddock's rising in 1655, but on 22 March 1658 his house was searched and he was taken to Whitehall to be questioned by Cromwell. Nothing could be proved against him and he was promptly released, but Waller recorded that Cromwell, although courteous, examined him &#145;as a stranger, not as one whome he had aforetime &hellip; obeyed&#146;  (&#145;Recollections&#146;, 116). He was suspected, probably correctly, of implication in Booth's abortive rising of 1659 and spent ten weeks as a prisoner in the Tower of London, where he and his wife found kindness and reasonable comfort until their release on 31 October 1659. On 27 December he courageously joined other old parliamentarians at the door of the House of Commons seeking admission to the reconstituted Rump, and in January and February he was active in the negotiations for the return of Charles II. On 21 February 1660 he re-entered the House of Commons, but farce mingled with triumph. In the procession of formerly secluded members William Prynne's long basket-hilt sword &#145;got between Sir W. Waller's short legs and threw him down, which caused laughter&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Edmund Ludlow &hellip; 1625&#150;1672</span>, ed. C. H. Firth, 2 vols., 1894, 2.235). Two days later he was appointed a member of the new council of state. He was elected to the Convention Parliament as member for Westminster in 1660 but did not sit in the next parliament. Henceforth he retired from public life. Unlike some of his fellow presbyterians he neither sought nor received reward.<br>
<br>By 1660 Waller had already fallen out with his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28562/', "William Waller")</script>, and his hopes of the second, Thomas, were not high. His two older daughters married in 1648 and 1649, and Anne, the daughter of Anne Finch, married Sir Philip Harcourt, son of Waller's third wife, in 1661 and died in 1664. His three youngest children had predeceased their mother, Anne. In his retirement he wrote his <span class="italic">Divine Meditations</span> (published posthumously in 1680). He apparently maintained old religious associations, for at his death he left &pound;10 each to two ejected London ministers, Thomas Case and Gabriel Sangar, as well as &pound;200 to be disbursed at their discretion for charitable uses. A close friend was Dr Thomas Coxe, who had previously served in the parliamentarian army, a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, an original member of the Royal Society, and Waller's &#145;faythfull and dearlie respected friend&#146;, who was one of the executors of his will and to whom, in thanks for his &#145;inviolable friendship both to mee and mine&#146;, Waller left &pound;250  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/330, sig. 78). Meanwhile relations with his heir deteriorated further, and in 1666 the younger William brought an unsuccessful suit in chancery against his in-laws and his father over his wife's portion. In his will Waller directed that Osterley House and park be sold and the proceeds used to buy lands to enable his executors to discharge William's debts and pay him an annuity. In the event of the failure of William's male line the annuity would go to Thomas and his heirs. The will is notable both for the control exerted over his sons' wayward financial propensities and for the absence of any affective language applied to them, in contrast to the warmth of his reference to Coxe.<br>
<br>Waller died at Osterley House on 19 September 1668 and was buried with pomp on 9 October in the New Chapel in Tothill Street, Westminster. On 17 October, however, the heralds removed the heraldic displays, either because they were &#145;false and beyond his quality&#146; or because his son, to save money, had employed counterfeit heralds (Adair, 274; Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.817).<h2>
<a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>Waller's public reputation derives from his part as parliament's &#145;famous and fortunate Commander&#146; of the first phases of the civil war  (J. Vicars, <span class="italic">Jehovah-Jireh</span>, 1644, 375). Anthony Wood dismissed many of his victories as &#145;little, or inconsiderable&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.815) but cumulatively, transitory as the fruits of victory sometimes were, his campaigns were crucial to parliament's ultimate control of south-central England and the approaches to the Welsh border. His military talents are difficult to assess beyond his well-known tactical skills for &#145;nimble and successful marches&#146;, exploitation of darkness, and choice of ground  (Clarendon, 2.179). His comments are always sensible, if defensively self-serving, but there is no evidence of a wider strategic grasp. In this, however, he did not differ from other commanders in a fluid, reactive, and fragmented war. His efforts were undoubtedly undercut by chronic shortages of men and money and by what an observer called Essex's &#145;inertia or malice&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Venice</span>, <i>1643&#150;7</i>, 2). Although Waller marched in Essex's magnificent funeral procession in October 1646 his retrospective writings still breathed resentment. He was a victim of the splintered command structure and imperfect system of taxation and disbursement of the early war years. As he said, &#145;Possibly I might have made more brick, if I had had more straw&#146;  (<span class="italic">Vindication</span>, 317). Yet although soldiers on both sides were notoriously volatile, the frequency of references to Waller's troops as mutinous, disorderly, and unwilling to follow him suggests that he lacked the touch that generals like Fairfax and Cromwell and other lesser commanders had in dealing with their soldiers.<br>
<br>Waller was notably short&#151;&#145;little in person&#146; but a &#145;brave little spark&#146; (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.814; Adair, x). Portraits show a thoughtful and determined face with a long nose and direct gaze. He was a sociable friend, an uxorious husband, a disappointed father, and a vivid and pithy writer. His writings provide invaluable evidence of gentry life in peace and war. His was, in part from the circumstances of enforced retirement, an examined life, and through his reflections it is possible to discern the views of many of the substantial conservative revolutionaries of 1642 without whom there could have been no civil war. His sociability, humour, and intense pleasure in the comfortable material world of books, gardens, and pictures (the &#145;long gallery&#146; at Osterley held twenty-four at his death), notably revealed in his <span class="italic">Divine Meditations</span> (1680), tell us much not only about Waller's mind and milieu but also about the texture of other gentry lives. The importance of a sense of personal worth and social status is illuminated by his response to the demeaning conditions of imprisonment, while the fragility of seventeenth-century health and the need for stoicism in bearing afflictions are evident in his references to attacks of the stone and other illnesses and in the vivid intensity of his account of his gout, that &#145;terrible disease&#146; of seventeenth-century men  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4.270). &#145;I am <i>an infirmity of the world</i>&#146;, he wrote, &#145;a <i>living Hospital</i> &hellip; <i>the Ghost of my departed self</i> &hellip; <i>My pain is my life</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Divine Meditations</span>, 49&#150;50). Through it all ran his conviction that all life was a manifestation of God's purpose and that the most trivial events as well as the greatest were evidence of God's oversight and intentions: God expected action from his instruments and he corrected and encouraged them on the way to his ends. Waller saw everything&#151;even defeat, his wives' deaths, his gout&#151;as sent from God for his ultimate good. The real terror, he believed, would come if it seemed that God did not care and that one was outside &#145;<i>the pale of his providence</i>&#146;. He prayed, &#145;Lord, do <i>any thing</i> to me, rather <i>then nothing</i>: Let thy pruning knife be never <i>so sharp</i>, and <i>cutting</i>, it can do me no <i>hurt</i>, so long as it <i>tends to make me good</i>&#146;  (ibid., 119).<br>
<br>In his disappointed later years Waller was to &#145;humbly acquiesce in the good Providence of GOD&#146;, but it was a sad acquiescence for &#145;GOD had determined a judgment upon the land&#146;  (<span class="italic">Vindication</span>, 197, 125 [<i>recte</i> 325]). He remained a moderate parliamentarian and constitutionalist and a moderate presbyterian. He had wished to tame the king but not to destroy him:&#145;I was borne under a monarchy; and I desire to dy under it&#146;  (ibid., 317). He had preserved the &#145;integrity of [his] heart according to the principles upon which [he] first engaged&#146;  (ibid., 225): his allegiance to parliament remained constant, and he rebuffed approaches from the king during the war. Parliaments, like kings, however, could decline from the ideal, and as parliament bowed before the &#145;incendiaries of the state&#146; Waller became alienated and disillusioned  (ibid., 11). In religion too he faced threats to the moderate reform he had hoped for. His puritanism was neither austere nor intolerant. He denied that &#145;Religion is a dull flat melancholy thing&#146;; instead the &#145;Communion of Saints&#146; brought &#145;merry hearts&#146; together  (<span class="italic">Divine Meditations</span>, 32, 34). Adherence to the solemn league and covenant allowed moderate toleration given agreement on the essentials of faith, for though there could be no compromise on these there could be flexibility on its indifferent aspects. Nevertheless God required &#145;<i>decency</i> and <i>order</i>&#146;; &#145;the <i>Garden of his Church</i>&#146; must not be &#145;overgrown with <i>errours</i> or <i>prophaneness</i>&#146;. When that threatened, &#145;weeding&#146;, &#145;lopping, and cutting&#146; were required  (ibid., 118). As he confronted the &#145;labyrinth&#146; of the interregnum Waller clung to the belief that it was the world and his former allies, not he, who had changed. &#145;This change is not in me, but in others&#146;, he said  (<span class="italic">Vindication</span>, 9&#150;10).<br>
<br>Yet Waller still believed that there were &#145;many saints&#146; among his &#145;former brethren&#146;, and he found it &#145;a misery to think &hellip; that there should be saints on two sides&#146;  (<span class="italic">Vindication</span>, 10). To his former enemies too he had tried to extend all the &#145;civilities&#146; he could, and had endeavoured to fight the war in such a way &#145;that so our differences might be kept in a reconcileable condition; and we might still look upon one another &hellip; as enemies that might live to be friends&#146;  (ibid., 8). He combined principled parliamentarianism, godliness, and active and committed conduct of hostilities with hope for restoration of a socially and politically conservative, religiously reformed, but unrevolutionary society. In this Waller was typical of many who started a revolution without hesitation in 1642, were alarmed and disillusioned by its progress, and looked for the return of the monarchy in 1660 as the solution to the dangers, personal and public, that it had unleashed.<br>
