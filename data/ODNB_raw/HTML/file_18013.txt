<span class="headword">Manwood, Sir  Peter</span>  (1571&#150;1625), <span class="occ">judge and antiquary</span>, was born at Hackington, Kent, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18014/', "Sir Roger Manwood (1524/5&#150;1592)")</script>, a judge, and his first wife, Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1575), daughter of John Theobald, of Seal. His younger brothers John and Thomas died childless, while his two sisters married into the county's judicial &eacute;lite: Margaret to John Leveson, of Halling, and Anne to Percival Hart, heir of Sir George Hart. Sir Roger Manwood was a revered judge of great legal learning who was accused of using judicial offices for personal gain. Peter followed his father's intellectual pursuits but not his profession, as he declined being called to the bar. He entered as a student of the Inner Temple on 20 November 1583, his father having arranged a room for him over benchers' chambers at Serjeants' Inn in 1587. He spent much time at the Inner Temple, where he pursued antiquarian interests throughout his life, and had his own four sons specially admitted to the inn. He married in January 1588 Frances (1573&#150;1638), daughter of Sir George Hart, of Lullingstone.<br>
<br>Manwood inherited his father's Kent, Essex, and London properties in 1592, and leased land from the archbishop of Canterbury. By 1600 he had the manors of Hackington, Ash, Chislet, and Raynhurst, Flint Castle, and houses in Sandwich and St Bartholomew's, London. The Manwoods had six sons and four daughters. Their eldest son, Thomas, graduated BA from Lincoln College, Oxford, in 1611, was a student at the Inner Temple, and drowned in France in 1613; their second, John (<i>d</i>. 1653), became Manwood's heir. The couple were also generous benefactors to local schools, churches, and hospitals. Their legacy was a lease of many lands in trust for charitable uses in 1615.<br>
<br>Manwood was senior MP for Sandwich in 1588&#150;9, 1592&#150;3, 1597, and 1601; for Saltash, Cornwall, in 1603&#150;4; for Kent in 1614; and for New Romney in 1620&#150;21. Though he sat in parliament and was appointed to a few committees concerned with legislation, he did not participate in debates. His political allegiance was anti-Catholic, anti-Spanish, and pro-puritan. A &#145;moderate Sabbatarian&#146;  (Clark, 345), he devoted his public interests to his county as a justice of the peace, where he was a member of the quorum of the court of quarter sessions (1593&#150;1620). He was appointed commander of Dover haven by 1591; a commissioner for grain in 1596, for musters by 1597, and for the oyster fisheries in 1598; deputy lieutenant of the Cinque Ports (1600), and of Kent (1601); sheriff of Kent (1602&#150;3); mayor of Canterbury (1605); and commissioner of sewers for Kent (1619&#150;23). After being knighted at the coronation of James I on 25 July 1603, by the 1620s he was the only one of three Elizabethan governors still prominent in Kent.<br>
<br>As a public official, Manwood was a patron of learned men as well as a scholar in his own right. He collected notes on English affairs from Edward the Confessor to Henry VIII and Cardinal Wolsey in the 1590s, which he exchanged with John Stow, and on Kent topology. He also collected transcripts of state papers between 1564 and 1618, and political tracts on Ireland, France, the Low Countries, north Africa, and Asia Minor. He had a licence to travel beyond the seas &#145;for his increase in good knowledge and learning&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1598&#150;1601</i>, 132). Manwood liked to gather scholars at his family seat of St Stephen's, Hackington, near Canterbury, and patronized the translators Edward Grimstone and Richard Knollys. His commonplace books were unique, combining letter-books for the governments of England, Ireland, and the Low Countries and proclamations for kings and sultans. Mentioned with great respect by William Camden in 1607, Manwood became a member of the Society of Antiquaries in 1617. He gave part of the manuscript of Sir Roger Williams's <span class="italic">The Actions of the Lowe Countries</span> to Sir John Hayward for revision; it was published in 1618 with a dedication to Sir Francis Bacon as &#145;good history&#146; designed to excite men to take up arms for good causes  (Williams, xlv&#150;xlvi). He gave many of his books to the Bodleian Library in 1620.<br>
<br>Manwood's large family, his inattention to his properties, and his lavish style of living brought financial difficulties which caused him to leave the country in August 1621. He had net liabilities of about &pound;3000 in 1593, a total estate valued at only &pound;1500 in 1614, and nothing left in current funds by the early 1620s. After returning to Dover in April 1623, he made arrangements with his creditors that allowed him to remain, and he was steward of the Inner Temple Christmas feast that winter. Lord Zouche, his lifelong friend, had written to Secretary Conway begging him to use his influence with the king for his protection. James complied because Manwood was one of those long-suffering county governors who served in numerous local offices at his own expense. He advised his son John to &#145;keep a good house within the proportion of his living&#146; but his lessons to wife and son in household management were insufficient, and the family fortune was in disarray at the time of his death at Sandwich in 1625. He was buried in St Stephen's Church, Hackington, Kent.<br>
