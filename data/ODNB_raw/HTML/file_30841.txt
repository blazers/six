</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bowra, Sir  (Cecil) Maurice</span>  (1898&#150;1971), <span class="occ">classical scholar and university administrator</span>, was born in Kiukiang, China, on 8 April 1898, the son of Cecil Arthur Verner Bowra (1869&#150;1947), a senior official in the Chinese customs service, and his wife, Ethel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lovibond. His childhood was exotic. Chinese servants, carousing Russian soldiers, and the endless prospect of a Japanese invasion made for a colourful upbringing. In later life he admitted that he had been &#145;spoiled&#146; as a child, but thought &#145;it was well worth it, and I have nothing but gratitude to those who did it&#146;  (Bowra, 5). He had one elder brother, Edward, and two younger sisters, Norah and Francesca, but he was never close to any of his siblings and rather kept them at arm's length. Such a beginning made Bowra a stranger to mainstream English life. He later described himself as a &#145;nationalist with regard to the past, and to English tradition&#146; only  (E. Kantorowicz to C. M. Bowra, 27 April 1949, Bowra MSS). He was not moved by the patriotism of his contemporaries. In 1910 he returned home to take up a scholarship at Cheltenham College, but an English public school was not to his liking. Some masters were kind, but he had few friends, and survived by exploiting his talents to amuse and mimic.<br>
<br>Bowra could not share the euphoria which greeted the outbreak of war in 1914, but dutifully joined the Royal Field Artillery, in which he was commissioned, and served on the western front from August 1917 until the armistice. The grim experiences of these months haunted his imagination ever after, and left him with a detestation of all things military. He long remembered:<blockquote>
<div>Boys bayonetted in the night<br>
</div>
<div>To keep official buttons bright.<br>
</div> (poem, Bowra MSS)</blockquote>The war also left Bowra with an abiding hatred of all things German, except that country's classical scholarship. In the 1930s he made frequent visits to Austria and Germany, one of which included an interview with Hitler. He never had any doubts about the nature of Nazism, and actively opposed all appeasement policies. As the situation deteriorated, he busily assisted the escape of German friends like Ernst Kantorowicz and Baroness Wangermann. Being as he put it &#145;very Germanophobe&#146;, he could not even enjoy entertaining Konrad Adenauer, deciding not to &#145;give him a good lunch&#146; and to invite only &#145;a few old shits&#146;  (Bowra to I. Berlin, n.d., Bowra MSS). For the whole of his life, he was sympathetic to the moderate left, a preference confirmed by his friendship with and respect for Hugh Gaitskell.<br>
<br>In 1919 Bowra went up to New College, Oxford. His undergraduate years were in every way successful, except in the tuition offered by the distinguished philosopher H. W. B. Joseph, whose teaching methods &#145;paralysed&#146; Bowra, and convinced him that he had no future in philosophy  (Bowra to Berlin, 20 Nov 1945, Bowra MSS). Joseph insisted that the nuances of every word should be measured, and that precision was more important than imagination. He deeply impressed Bowra, who was left with a feeling that his own writings represented a lesser scholarship, even though they had infinitely more colour and range. Gilbert Murray, not Joseph, became Bowra's patron, and it was largely due to his efforts that Bowra was elected a fellow of Wadham College in 1922, having taken firsts in both classical honour moderations (1920) and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1922). Candidly, Bowra expressed pleasure at being able to attend Joseph's funeral.<br>
<br>Bowra was a fellow of Wadham from 1922 to 1938, and warden from 1938 to 1970. The college became the only permanent home he ever knew. It was also a community he transformed, a court he ruled, and a forum in which he established a national reputation. His ideas about the purpose of a university could not have been clearer. He saw an ongoing struggle between those who loved life and those who were interested only in undermining its wonderful possibilities. Jokingly, he declared himself &#145;anti-prig, anti-&eacute;litist, anti-solemn, anti-Balliol&#146;. In a university young people should be invited to break through barriers of class, convention, and national feeling, and to revel in the uninhibited exercise of the mind. He described himself as a member of &#145;the Immoral Front&#146;  (Bowra to Berlin, n.d., Bowra MSS).<br>
<br>In this war between the civilized and the philistine Bowra was at his most combative. Everyone who came within range would be labelled friend or foe. He found it easy to make lists of allies and enemies. Among the first were Isaiah Berlin, John Sparrow, A. J. Ayer, and George (Dadie) Rylands; among the latter C. P. Snow and A. J. P. Taylor. Once a friend had been identified, his career was to be aggressively advanced. Few things pleased Bowra more than the manipulation of elections. The appointment of the right man was reason for celebration. His circle was consciously a band of brothers embattled against the anti-intellectualism so evident on &#145;Baldwinite faces&#146;  (Bowra to Berlin, 20 Jan 1963, Bowra MSS). Loyalty to each other was at a premium. There was no more terrible word in the Bowra vocabulary than &#145;disloyal&#146;. Those judged guilty of this offence could face crushing anathemas and silences.<br>
<br>In this campaign, Oxford in general and Wadham in particular should become bastions of right thinking. The transformation of Wadham in his time was almost an act of creation. As he put it, &#145;All Colleges taken in the lump are dim &hellip; It does not matter. It is up to oneself to make it enjoyable and reasonably distinguished&#146;  (Bowra to Berlin, 11 Nov 1953, Bowra MSS). Talent was to be searched out and encouraged. Grammar-school boys and the beneficiaries of the 1944 <span class="roman">Education Act</span> were particularly welcome. Equally, there was to be no provincialism. Bowra's contacts and friendships with members of Ottoline Morrell's circle at Garsington, the Bloomsbury set, and the Sitwell network broadened Oxford's range and enriched it. In England scholarly life lived in Oxford has often been quite separate from the intellectual life lived in London and certain country houses. In Bowra's Wadham the two came together in pleasant and profitable companionship.<br>
<br>Bowra the impresario never overwhelmed Bowra the scholar, however. Parties ended promptly at 10.30, to allow for the possibility of a full day's work on the morrow. His scholarly output was prodigious. Yet it was in one sense personally unsatisfying. He had a clear notion of a hierarchy of classical scholars. At the summit stood Wilamowitz and Fraenkel. Next came Gilbert Murray and J. D. Denniston. Bowra never felt himself the equal of these men. He could never match their meticulous attention to detail in deciphering an inscription or in editing a text, though his own edition (1935) of Pindar's works stands up well. Nor could he, in the last decades of his life, sympathize with new forms of literary criticism coming from France and Germany. In 1936, when he was passed over for the regius professorship of Greek in favour of E. R. Dodds, he was bitterly disappointed but hardly surprised. He was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1938.<br>
<br>Bowra's classical scholarship was defined by two objectives. First it was &#145;the task of a Greek scholar &hellip; to revive as best he could for the modern world the inner life of the Greeks by a close examination of their literature&#146;  (Bowra, 257). He hoped to be an interpreter, making the spirit of Greece intelligible, and he had no doubt about what that spirit was. He told a Cambridge audience just before his death that the essence of Greek thought was &#145;that man is an individual, who lives among other men in his own right and for his own worth&#146;  (speech on Greek Freedom, 21 March 1971, Bowra MSS). The military coup in Greece in 1967 deeply distressed him, and he was happy to allow Wadham to become a base for those trying to restore democracy. His major works included <span class="italic">Ancient Greek Literature</span> (1933), <span class="italic">Greek Lyric Poetry</span> (1936), <span class="italic">Periclean Athens</span> (1971), and <span class="italic">The Greek Experience</span> (1957).<br>
<br>Bowra's second aim in writing was to shed light on classical literature by comparing it to that of other cultures. His cultural and linguistic range allowed him to do this with effect. He wrote on Val&eacute;ry and Blok as well as Homer, and he brought new poets like Cavafy and Seferis to the attention of intelligent Englishmen. Works such as <span class="italic">The Heritage of Symbolism</span> (1943) and <span class="italic">The Romantic Imagination</span> (1950) broke new ground. Not unreasonably, Edith Sitwell hailed his role as a critic, because he was &#145;doing a great work in making poetry universal, and abolishing frontiers&#146;  (E. Sitwell to Bowra, 17 March 1945, Bowra MSS). Greek literature was never to be assessed as though it stood alone. It was rather to be evaluated as part of an ongoing human experience that transcended particular cultural borders. In making comparisons, what was distinctive about the Greeks would be highlighted, and what they shared with later generations would be underlined. From 1946 to 1951, he held the chair of poetry in Oxford, a position which gave him particular pleasure.<br>
<br>The talents of the scholar were more than matched by those of a formidable administrator. In addition to presiding over the affairs of Wadham, Bowra was vice-chancellor of Oxford University from 1951 to 1954 and president of the British Academy from 1958 to 1962. He claimed that such roles were uncongenial, most of the work being &#145;dull and difficult, statutes, science, finance, etc.&#146;  (Bowra to Berlin, 11 Nov 1953, Bowra MSS). But this was false modesty for the most part. Science and scientists, it is true, presented problems. He never understood the language of scientists and never sympathized with their aims. Relations with Lord Cherwell and Cyril Hinshelwood could be frosty. But, on the other hand, the conducting of campaigns, the marshalling of votes by flattery and bullying, and the securing of favourite projects were all intensely enjoyable.<br>
<br>In coming to a meeting, Bowra was always well prepared and very clear in his own mind about what decisions should be taken. The tempo at which business was taken increased dramatically in university councils. Matters were &#145;dispatched at high speed and in a loud voice&#146;  (Lloyd-Jones, <span class="italic">Bowra</span>, 123). It was not unusual for other members of committees which he chaired to complain that this breathless approach left them insufficient time to reflect or suggest amendments. But Bowra would assume that such protestations were only further evidence of his methods working. He was not given to doubting. In talking to colleagues he was sure that his instincts were right. In representing Oxford to the University Grants Committee, or to the outside world generally, he was equally sure that Oxford and its values should not be challenged. Such confidence made him formidable in college or university politics. He never feared making enemies or &#145;making bad blood&#146;. Such things were inevitable in a war against philistinism in all its forms.<br>
<br>Force of argument was matched by force of personality. Short of stature, Bowra yet had bulk. Thickset, bull-necked, and rounding with the years, he was compact and seemingly muscled. His nickname, the Rhino, bore witness to form and character. Yet in one respect it was misleading. No skin was thinner. He was deeply sensitive to criticism and to rejection. He once remarked, &#145;I create rebuffs before I am rebuffed&#146;  (Bowra to Berlin, n.d., Bowra MSS). In particular his homosexuality was always a matter of anxiety. Close friendships with Philip Ritchie, Adrian Bishop, and Ernst Kantorowicz were marred by fears about exposure and blackmail. Although he enjoyed the companionship of many women, among them Iris Murdoch, Elizabeth Bowen, and Penelope Betjeman, he was essentially a member of what he called &#145;the Homintern&#146;  (ibid., 11 Aug [1937]). When his engagement to Audrey Beecham was called off, he reflected that &#145;it seems that God has decided that I [am] seldom to get what I want and am to be punished for my good actions&#146;  (ibid.). Hard work, the loyalty of friends, and wit enunciated in a bittern-booming voice with strange cadences were compensations for emotional disappointment.<br>
<br>In later life Bowra was much honoured. The German government made him a member of the order of merit, and the Sorbonne gave him an honorary doctorate for his writing on French poetry. He once remarked that he collected honorary degrees as a schoolboy collected stamps. He was knighted in 1951 and appointed CH in 1971.<br>
<br>Bowra was not a religious man in any conventional sense, and he detested puritanism in any of its disguises. In the First World War a reluctance to shell Noyon Cathedral was overcome by the recollection that Calvin had been closely associated with the town. Yet he assiduously attended college chapel, and took pleasure in the stateliness of an ordered Anglicanism. It was, in his phrase, &#145;all marvellous rot&#146;. He died, unmarried, in Wadham College on 4 July 1971, and was buried in St Cross churchyard, Oxford.<br>
<br>In January 1937 Harvard offered Bowra a chair, and he affected to take the matter seriously. His hesitation produced letters from every classicist of note in Oxford begging him not to leave. These appeals not only recognized the value of his scholarship, but also his astonishing capacity to transform the lives of young people. Isaiah Berlin acknowledged, among many others, that his own thinking and behaviour had been moulded by the warden. Young men who arrived in Oxford &#145;suppressed, un self-expressed, unventilated&#146;  (R. Harrod to Bowra, 17 Jan 1937, Bowra MSS) were recast into individuals with something to say. And that, as far as Bowra was concerned, was what a university was for. As a friend remarked, Oxford without Bowra was &#145;a mutton chop without any chutney&#146;  (Mary [?] to Bowra, 16 Dec 1936, Bowra MSS).<br>
