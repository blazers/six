<span class="headword">Cochrane, Sir  Thomas John</span>  (1789&#150;1872), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, eldest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5749/', "Admiral Sir Alexander Inglis Cochrane (1758&#150;1832)")</script> and his wife, Maria (<i>d</i>. 18 March 1856), daughter of David Shaw and widow of Captain Sir Jacob Wheate RN, fifth baronet, was born in Edinburgh on 5 February 1789. He was entered as a volunteer on board the <i>Thetis</i>, commanded by his father, in June 1796, and continued to serve under his father's pennant, or flag&#151;including on the expeditions to Quiberon, Belle &Icirc;sle, Ferrol, and Egypt&#151;until June 1805, when he was made lieutenant into the frigate <i>Jason</i> (32 guns). In September 1805 he was advanced to be commander of the sloop <i>Nimrod</i> (18 guns), on 23 January 1806 to be acting captain of the <i>Jason</i>, and his rank was confirmed on 23 April 1806, when only two months over seventeen. This rapid promotion, by the commander-in-chief, of a foreign station for his son was gross jobbery. There were few instances so flagrant of a practice then not uncommon. Off the coast of Surinam on 27 January 1807 Cochrane captured the French warship <i>La Favorite</i>, and in December served at the capture of the Danish West Indian islands. He continued in the West Indies until 1809, and after two years on half pay commanded the frigate <i>Surprise</i> (38 guns) on the coast of North America&#151;capturing on 16 January 1813 the American privateer <i>Decatur</i>, and serving in the operations against Washington and Baltimore and on the Georgia coast&#151;until the peace. From 1820 to 1824 he commanded the <i>Forte</i> (44 guns) on the same station, from 1825 to 1834 he was governor of Newfoundland, and on 23 November 1841 he became rear-admiral. He was knighted (29 May 1812) as proxy for his father at his installation as KB. He was himself made CB on 18 April 1839, KCB on 2 November 1847, and GCB on 18 May 1860. He was Conservative MP for Ipswich in 1839&#150;41, and unsuccessfully contested Greenock in July 1841.<br>
<br>From 1842 to 1845 Cochrane was second in command in China, with his flag in the <i>Agincourt</i>, and he was commander-in-chief from 1844 to 1846. In August 1845 and July 1846 he punished Brunei pirates by destroying their forts and other buildings. He supported J. F. Davis's policy of conciliation at Canton (Guangzhou), with a minimal naval presence there so as not to inflame Chinese hostility. British merchants criticized him for ineffectiveness against Chinese pirates, but he was limited by government instructions. He was commander-in-chief at Portsmouth from December 1852 to January 1856. In due course of seniority he became vice-admiral on 14 January 1850, admiral on 31 January 1856, and admiral of the fleet on 12 September 1865.<br>
<br>Cochrane married on 6 January 1812 Matilda, eldest daughter of Lieutenant-General Sir Charles Ross, seventh baronet, and they had two sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5760/', "Alexander Cochrane-Wishart-Baillie, first Baron Lamington (1816&#150;1890)")</script>, and two daughters; she assumed the additional name of Wishart and died on 4 September 1819. He married on 8 January 1853 Rosetta (<i>d</i>. 27 May 1901), daughter of Sir J. D. Wheeler-Cuffe, first baronet, and they had children. He died at his residence, Quarr Abbey House, Ryde, Isle of Wight, on 19 October 1872, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery, London, on 25 October.<br>
