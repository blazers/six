<span class="headword">Clissold,  Augustus</span>  (1797&#150;1882), <span class="occ">Swedenborgian activist</span>, was born on 13 May 1797 at Stonehouse, near Stroud, Gloucestershire, the fifth son in the family of thirteen children (only seven of whom reached adulthood) of Stephen Clissold (1764&#150;1834), founder of the Ebley Cloth Mills in Stroud which supplied army clothing contracts during the Napoleonic wars, and his wife, Diana Mortimer (1765&#150;1840). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5690/', "Stephen Clissold")</script> was his elder brother. Augustus matriculated from Exeter College, Oxford, on 6 December 1814, the same day as his elder brother, Henry Clissold. He took the ordinary BA degree in 1818, proceeding MA in 1821. He was ordained deacon in 1821 and priest in 1823. He held for some time the curacies of St Martin-in-the-Fields and St Mary, Stoke Newington, where he began a courtship with Eliza Crawshay (1790&#150;1877), who lived at Newington Park House. Her father, the ironmaster <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47475/', "William Crawshay (1764&#150;1834)")</script>, strongly disapproved of the relationship. After his death the estate passed to Eliza and the couple married. They had no children.<br>
<br>Clissold withdrew from the ministry about 1840, although he remained nominally connected with the Church of England to the end of his life. Having become an enthusiastic student of the writings of Emanuel Swedenborg, he joined, in 1838, the Swedenborg Society as a life member, and in the same year was placed on the committee. In 1840 he was elected chairman of the annual meeting. In addition to publishing numerous theological and eschatological works of his own, Clissold translated and printed at his own expense Swedenborg's <span class="italic">Principia rerum naturalium</span> (2 vols., 1845&#150;6) and <span class="italic">Oeconomia regni animalis</span> (edited by J. J. Garth Wilkinson, 2 vols., 1846), both of which he presented to the Swedenborg Association. The association, of which he was chosen president, was founded in 1845 for the publication of Swedenborg's scientific works, and later merged with the larger Swedenborg Society.<br>
<br>In 1854 Clissold purchased for the use of the society a seventy years' lease of a house at 36 Bloomsbury Street, London, which later became the depot of New Church literature. During the stormy time through which the Swedenborg Society passed in 1859 and 1860 Clissold assisted it liberally with money, and by his will he bequeathed to it the sum of &pound;4000. In 1870 he assisted financially in the publication of <span class="italic">Documents Concerning the Life and Character of Emanuel Swedenborg</span>, translated and edited by R. L. Tafel (2 vols., 1875&#150;7), and during the last two years of his life he similarly made possible the publication of Swedenborg's posthumous work <span class="italic">The Brain</span> (1882), which formed a portion of the <span class="italic">Regnum animale perlustratum</span>. After resigning his second curacy Clissold continued to live at Stoke Newington, making occasional visits to his country house at 4 Broadwater Down, Frant, Sussex, near Tunbridge Wells. He died there on 30 October 1882. Following his death, the Stoke Newington estate reverted to the Crawshay family and was sold. A campaign by the Commons Preservation Society saved it from development, and in 1889 Clissold Park was secured as a public park.<br>
