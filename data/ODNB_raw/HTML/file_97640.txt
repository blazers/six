<span class="headword">Bowen,  Denis Arthur</span>  (1921&#150;2006), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born on 5 April 1921 at Zantespans Drift Farm, near Kimberley, South Africa, one of two sons and two daughters of Alan Bowen, a farmer originally from Cardigan, and his wife, Bertha, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jones. Orphaned young, he went to England with his brother and sisters in 1926. From then until 1933 he lived first with his maternal grandmother then with an aunt in Manchester. Thereafter he lived under the protection of a paternal aunt in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, and completed his schooling at King James I Grammar School in Almondbury. His artistic talent was already apparent and in 1938 he entered Huddersfield School of Art, where he was encouraged by the local painter Reginald Napier, a former Royal College of Art student who pointed his charge towards further studies at the college.<br>
<br>As with many of his generation, Bowen's education was put on hold by the Second World War. He served in the navy, travelling on Atlantic convoys to Canada as well as sailing to Africa and the Far East. Experience at sea was seminal for Bowen's developing iconography and early informalism. In particular, the mercurial energy of the sea inspired his loose, gestural, and liquid paint handling, which exploited chance, accident, and the &#145;organic&#146; processes of painterly image formation. From the deck of his frigate in Portsmouth harbour at night Bowen was intrigued by searchlight beams that unified the sky with the mysterious dark waters below. In his work vertical abstract marks deriving from these experiences countered the lateral orientation of most landscape-derived compositions.<br>
<br>Bowen resumed his studies in 1946, entering the Royal College of Art with a borough scholarship from Huddersfield. His benign tutor, Kenneth Rowntree, together with charismatic teachers like Carel Weight and John Minton, saw him develop notable tonal skills that instilled even into gestural abstraction a naturalism related either to landscape or, in later work, to an extra-terrestrial cosmological vision. He took his diploma in 1949. What became a lifelong teaching career ensued; after graduating he taught part-time in the interior design department at Kingston School of Art. This was followed by teaching stints on the intermediate course at Hammersmith during the early 1950s and in the school of industrial design first at the Central School of Art (1953&#150;6) and then at the Royal College of Art (1956&#150;61). Not only did Bowen create in these colleges a network of professional contacts among staff and students that would last a lifetime, but the experimental tenor of his work was consolidated within a climate of radical innovation informed by the Bauhaus-inspired teaching methods introduced by Victor Pasmore and others.<br>
<br>While Bowen's emerging abstract style was influenced by New York abstract expressionism and by contemporary French &#145;tachism&#146;, gleaned from the magazines <span class="italic">Cimaise</span> and <span class="italic">Art d'Aujourd'hui</span>, a more direct spur to his evolving language came through meeting in London artists he admired, such as Alberto Giacometti, Pierre Soulages, Georges Mathieu, and later Mark Rothko. He also stayed in Paris with Yves Klein. An intrepid gallery-goer, he became a well-informed artist whose talents extended beyond his own artistic practice to embrace exhibition organizing and critical writing. Accordingly he opened his own gallery, the avant-garde New Vision Centre Gallery, with help from Halima Nalecz and Frank Avray Wilson, in April 1956.<br>
<br>Both inspired by, and a reaction to, the Institute of Contemporary Art, founded in 1948, the New Vision Centre Gallery formed itself out of the Free Painters Group. As its title implies, this group represented a more open, democratic forum than the institute and during its decade-long existence (1956&#150;66) the gallery devoted itself to promoting a broad spectrum of both hard-edged, geometric and informal abstract art by British, continental, and international artists. Among the many distinguished exhibitors were Peter Blake, Paul Feiler, Roy Turner Durrant, Piero Manzoni, Robert Goodnough, and the comedian Charlie Drake. Meanwhile Bowen's own exhibition career blossomed beyond the walls of the subterranean New Vision Centre Gallery to take in such prestigious West End galleries as the Redfern, O'Hana, Tooth, and Grabowski. Always an internationalist, he also exhibited in Paris, New York, Rome, and other major cities. He participated in the Redfern Gallery's landmark &#145;Metavisual, Tachist, Abstract&#146; exhibition (1957) alongside leading young abstract artists like Gillan Ayres, Robyn Denny, and Roger Hilton. The <span class="roman">Atomic Landscape</span> series, produced during a furious two-day burst of spontaneous production, frequently made up his gallery displays.<br>
<br>During the early 1960s Bowen was inspired by space exploration, and his painterliness was formalized into geometrical symbols and stellar or planetry discs. <span class="italic">Re-entry Colonel Glenn</span> (1962) and <span class="italic">Triptych for a Venusian</span> (1963) epitomized these developments. By 1965 his output had peaked and he latterly refined the explosive gestures, as in the <span class="roman">Projectile</span> series based on rocket launches, and the astronomical symbols. There were, however, innovations like his passing flirtation with &#145;op&#146; and kinetic art, where he experimented with relief and with new, optically vibrant, fluorescent or luminous paints.<br>
<br>Bowen married twice: first, on 7 April 1949, Eve Elizabeth Reinhardt, an 18-year-old art student, and daughter of Ernest Joseph Reinhardt, button manufacturer, and second, on 11 August 1962, Judith Ann Stapleton, a 22-year-old art teacher, and daughter of John William Stapleton, secondary school teacher. Both marriages were brief and ended in divorce. He became a British citizen in 1962. Although his teaching career took him to the University of Victoria, British Columbia, in 1969&#150;72, he kept his rented flat at 4 Seymour Place, Marble Arch, above what had been the New Vision Centre Gallery. Latterly he taught at High Wycombe and devoted more time to writing art criticism for <span class="italic">Arts Review</span> and <span class="italic">Art International</span>. He was an active member of the Association of International Art Critics and travelled to their conferences across Europe. His penchant for travel took him regularly to the Venice Biennale and to workshops in Macedonia during the 1980s and 1990s. Finally, alongside younger artists he participated in the Celtic Vision, Cosmopolis, and Sharing a View painting groups during the 1990s and 2000s. A burst aorta suffered in his flat in March 2005 led to months in St Mary's Hospital, Paddington. Although he recovered he died from pneumonia at the same hospital on 23 March 2006. He was survived by a daughter, Amanda Groome. He was cremated at Golders Green crematorium.<br>
