<span class="headword">Butler, Sir  Edwin John</span>  (1874&#150;1943), <span class="occ">plant pathologist and mycologist</span>, was born on 13 August 1874 in Kilkee, co. Clare, the youngest of three sons of Thomas Butler, of Suirville, co. Tipperary, resident magistrate, and his wife, Annie Barry. He was educated first in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, and from 1897, owing to illness, at home where he had the run of a large library. In 1890 he went to the Christian Brothers' School in Cork, after which he studied medicine at Queen's College, Cork. In 1898 he took the degrees of MB, BCh, and BAO of the Royal University of Ireland, but he never practised. His main interest lay in botanical research and especially in aquatic phycomycetes. Awarded an 1851 Exhibition two-year travelling scholarship, from 1899 he worked in Paris, Antibes, Freiburg, and finally the Jodrell Laboratory of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.<br>
<br>At the end of 1900 Butler was appointed to the new post of cryptogamic botanist to the government of India. Before leaving England he married, in February 1901, Nina, daughter of Alfred John Le Mesurier, head of an old Guernsey family. They had one son and two daughters. On arrival in India Butler's first posting was to Calcutta. In 1902 he was transferred to Dehra Dun, and in 1905 he became the first imperial mycologist at the new agricultural research station at Pusa, Bengal. While in India he published some forty scientific papers on diseases of tropical crops, investigations which provided an authoritative background for his textbook, <span class="italic">Fungi and Disease in Plants</span> (1918), a landmark for tropical plant pathologists. He also published his classic account of the genus <i>Pythium</i> (1907). At the same time, he and his Indian staff, in collaboration with European taxonomic mycologists, began the census which culminated in Butler and G. R. Bisby's <span class="italic">The Fungi of India</span> (1931).<br>
<br>In 1920 Butler left India to become director of the newly founded Imperial Bureau of Mycology at Kew. After assembling a small staff and laying plans for the abstracting journal, the <span class="italic">Review of Applied Mycology</span>, Butler visited plant pathologists in the United States and Commonwealth countries to obtain support for the bureau, which flourished. In 1927 it became a unit of the Imperial Agricultural Bureaux as the Imperial Mycological Institute and in 1930 moved into purpose-built accommodation on land leased from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.<br>
<br>In 1935 Butler resigned from the institute in order to join the Agricultural Research Council, of which he became the first paid secretary. After leaving the institute, where he retained a small laboratory which he visited at weekends, Butler's administrative duties were so heavy that he had little time for mycological research. He did, however, find time to complete, with S. G. Jones, the general part of the textbook, <span class="italic">Plant Pathology</span>, published in 1949.<br>
<br>Butler had an easy manner but his searching cross-questioning gave him a reputation as a somewhat intimidating examiner or assessor for appointments. He was also a practised diplomat, often getting his own way by inducing others to propose the course of action he desired. He was appointed CIE in 1921 and CMG in 1932; he was knighted in 1939, and was elected FRS in 1926. He was president of the British Mycological Society in 1927 and the Association of Economic Biologists in 1928&#150;9, and in 1938, the University of Aberdeen awarded him an honorary LLD. Butler died in the Shiel Nursing Home, Elgin Road, Weybridge, following an attack of influenza, on 4 April 1943.<br>
