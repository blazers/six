<span class="headword">Baylis,  Thomas Henry</span>  (1817&#150;1908), <span class="occ">lawyer and author</span>, was born in London on 22 June 1817, the second son of Edward Baylis, deputy lieutenant and JP for Middlesex. He was educated at Harrow School (1825&#150;34) before matriculating in 1835 as a scholar at Brasenose College, Oxford, where he graduated BA in 1838 and MA in 1841. Although he entered as a student of the Inner Temple in 1834, he practised for some time as a special pleader. He was called to the bar in 1856, when he joined the northern circuit. He became QC in 1875, and two years later a bencher of the Inner Temple. From 1876 to 1903 he was judge of the court of passage at Liverpool, an ancient court of record with local jurisdiction wider than that of a county court.<br>
<br>On 14 August 1841 Baylis married Louisa Lord (<i>d</i>. 1900), the youngest daughter of John Ingle, deputy lieutenant and JP for Devon. They had several children, and their third son, Thomas Erskine, was called to the bar in 1874.<br>
<br>Baylis was an officer in the Army Volunteer Reserve, retiring in 1882 with the volunteer decoration as lieutenant-colonel of the 18th Middlesex rifles. He was a vice-president of the Royal United Services Institution to which he presented an autograph letter from the signal officer on board the flagship <i>Victory</i> at Trafalgar, explaining the substitution of &#145;expects&#146; for &#145;confides&#146; in Nelson's famous signal: &#145;England expects every man to do his duty.&#146; In his pamphlet, <span class="italic">The True Account of Nelson's Famous Signal</span> (1905), he discussed whether Nelson had permanently lost the sight of one eye. He was also one of the founders of the Egypt Exploration Fund, drafting the original articles of association.<br>
<br>As a lawyer, Baylis was chiefly known for a treatise on domestic servants, <span class="italic">The Rights, Duties, and Relations of Domestic Servants and their Masters and Mistresses</span> (1857). Other works included <span class="italic">Fire Hints</span> (1884), <span class="italic">Introductory Address on the Office of Reader or Lector and Lecture on Treasure Trove</span>, delivered in the Inner Temple Hall, Michaelmas 1898 (1901), and <span class="italic">Workmen's Compensation Act</span> (1902). Baylis also published <span class="italic">The Temple Church and Chapel of St Anne</span>, a guidebook to the Inner Temple Church (1893). He died on 4 October 1908 at Lucknow, Wellington Road, Bournemouth, and was buried in Bournemouth cemetery.<br>
