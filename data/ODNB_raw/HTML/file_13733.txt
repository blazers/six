<span class="headword">Hope,  John</span>  (1794&#150;1858), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 26 May 1794, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13717/', "Charles Hope (1763&#150;1851)")</script>, lord president and lord justice-general of the court of session, and his wife, Charlotte (1771&#150;1834), daughter of John Hope, second earl of Hopetoun. The lawyer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/72752/', "James Hope")</script> was his younger brother, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53690/', "Louisa Hope")</script> was his sister. His grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13729/', "John Hope (1739&#150;1785)")</script>, MP for Linlithgowshire. He was educated partly at Edinburgh high school and he was admitted as an advocate in November 1816. Hope married Jessie Scott (<i>d</i>. 1872), daughter of Thomas and Isabella Irving of Shetland, in 1824 or 1825, and they had a son who survived to maturity.<br>
<br>Appointed an advocate-depute under Sir William Rae, Hope came early to prominence as a defender of the then tory administration of justice in Scotland. On 25 June 1822 James Abercromby moved (unsuccessfully) in the House of Commons for the appointment of a committee of inquiry into the conduct of the lord advocate and the other law officers of the crown in Scotland in relation to their connections with the press. Specifically it was felt that an article in the <span class="italic">Glasgow Sentinel</span> attacking James Stuart of Dunearn, a whig, had shown too strong a link between the law officers and the tory press. This article had resulted in the death of the author in a duel and the trial of Stuart at the insistence of the lord advocate. Together with a colleague Hope sent Abercromby a letter of protest couched in such terms that only a warrant for their, and Abercromby's, arrest prevented further bloodshed. Hope was subsequently heard at the bar of the House of Commons in his own defence, on 17 July 1822, but, though found guilty of a breach of the privileges of the house, no further proceedings were taken in the matter.<br>
<br>This early incident contains good indications of Hope's character. Sir Walter Scott described Hope as &#145;the most hopeful young man of his time&#146;  (Lockhart, 587), talented, ambitious, and popular. On the other hand Scott commented on Hope's hot and rather hasty manner, which would get him into difficulties if not amended. In November 1822 Hope, after only a few years at the bar, was appointed solicitor-general for Scotland in Lord Liverpool's administration. He held this post until the formation of Lord Grey's ministry in 1830, when he was succeeded by Henry Cockburn.<br>
<br>In December 1830 Hope was elected dean of the Faculty of Advocates in succession to Francis Jeffrey, in whose favour Hope had waived his claims to this position in the previous year. As an advocate, therefore, Hope appears to have been popular among his contemporaries at the bar. He enjoyed a high reputation and a successful practice. His powerful memory, however, appears to have been used to accumulate a mass of detail. As a pleader he was not nimble, but rather a traditionalist who favoured overwhelming an opponent's argument with a battery of precedents. On paper he was accused of a lack of clarity and of being verbose. Cockburn, on a visit to an English court, made the following comparative comment on Hope's style as an advocate:<blockquote>I heard no voice strained, and did not see a drop of sweat at the bar in these eight days. Our high-pressure Dean screams and gesticulates and perspires more in any forenoon than the whole Bar of England (I say nothing of Ireland) in a reign. (<span class="italic">Journal of Henry Cockburn</span>, 1.114)</blockquote>Hope's importance in Scottish history lies in the role he played in the conflict in the Church of Scotland in the period leading up to the Disruption of 1843, a role which earned him much negative comment. He was described by the Free Churchman Robert Buchanan as &#145;the author of the Disruption&#146;  (Buchanan, 1.315). A stout defender of the established church, whose rights and privileges he regarded as having been conferred by the state, Hope was the solitary elder who tabled fourteen reasons for dissenting against the <span class="roman">Veto Act</span> at the general assembly of 1834. This act gave parishioners in Scotland the power to block a patron's presentee to a vacant parish. At this point Hope apparently questioned neither the church's right to pass the act, nor its jurisdiction over spiritual appointments, but rather its right to determine who might receive a civil benefice. In 1835 Hope became legal adviser to Robert Young, the rejected presentee at Auchterarder, in a test case on the act. He then took matters on to the much more dangerous and contentious plane of church&#150;state relations by asking the court of session to declare that the assembly's <span class="roman">Veto Act</span> was illegal, and that if a presentee was found to be qualified then the presbytery was bound to admit him in spite of any objections raised at parish level. The case was heard in late 1837, and the court&#151;presided over by his father, Lord Justice-General Charles Hope&#151;decided in early 1838 by a majority of eight to five in favour of Hope's arguments.<br>
<br>Hope intervened at other points in this continuing controversy, always to argue that the established church was subject to the civil authority. He achieved most public attention with the publication in 1839 of his pamphlet <span class="italic">A letter to the lord chancellor, on the claims of the Church of Scotland in regard to its jurisdiction, and, on the proposed changes in its polity</span>. Described by W. E. Gladstone as fearfully long (it ran to 290 pages), it nevertheless reached a wide and influential audience both within and outside Scotland, including key figures in the Conservative Party to whom Thomas Chalmers, Hope's leading non-intrusionist opponent in the church, was increasingly looking. Gladstone told Sir James Graham that it convinced him of the threatening nature of the Scottish church question. Graham, who was home secretary at the time of the Disruption, for his part appears to have been influenced by Hope's pamphlet into thinking that the church was affected by an undesirable democratic excitement.<br>
<br>Less publicly, but more effectively, Hope increasingly had the ear of Lord Aberdeen, who in 1839 and 1840 was involved in discussions with Thomas Chalmers to try to find a legislative solution to the church's problems that would save it from the interference of the civil courts. In a voluminous correspondence and in personal meetings with Aberdeen, Hope was responsible behind the scenes for souring relations between Aberdeen and Chalmers. Aberdeen, in fact, was making Hope privy to the correspondence which he was conducting with the non-intrusionist leader. Hope apparently also tried to isolate Aberdeen from other church contacts and played a part in blocking changes to his proposed legislative measure of 1840, which Robert Buchanan claimed would have averted the Disruption. Furthermore, in the months immediately preceding the Disruption in 1843, Hope continued mistakenly to advise Aberdeen, and through him the prime minister, Sir Robert Peel, that any secession from the Church of Scotland would be insignificant in size. This may have played a part in ensuring government inactivity in the matter. Small wonder that epithets such as &#145;mole&#146; and &#145;wily and devious Kirk agent&#146;  (Maciver, 93, 110) have been applied to Hope.<br>
<br>These more negative views of Hope continued after he became a judge in 1841, succeeding David Boyle as lord justice-clerk and president of the second division of the court of session. This very rapid elevation excited some comment. One explanation was that Hope at the outset of his career had been offered the post of lord advocate by Canning, but had stepped aside at that point in favour of Sir William Rae. As a judge Hope was regarded as having a contempt for public opinion and a love of precedent. He was known for an arrogant manner and for making his personal dislikes obvious. His decisions were questioned on equitable if not on legal grounds. Even so, his opinions on civil questions and in medical jurisprudence enjoyed a firm reputation. <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span> thought that as a judge Hope was neither hard-hearted nor unable to pity misfortune. He also presided at nearly all the criminal trials of importance which took place in the high court of justiciary during his seventeen years in office. These included the celebrated trial of Madeline Smith for murder in 1857.<br>
<br>Hope died at his home, 20 Moray Place, Edinburgh, on 14 June 1858, from a sudden attack of paralysis, and was buried five days later at Ormiston Hall, near Tranent, in East Lothian. His widow died on 26 January 1872.<br>
