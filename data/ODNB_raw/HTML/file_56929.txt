<span class="headword">Whitaker,  William</span>  (1836&#150;1925), <span class="occ">geologist</span>, was born on 4 May 1836 at 69 Hatton Garden, London, the only child of William Whitaker (<i>d</i>. 1893), perfumerer and wine merchant, and Margaret Burgess Michie (<i>bap</i>. 1806, <i>d</i>. 1894), both Londoners. He was educated at a school in St John's Wood and at St Albans grammar school, and took a BA in chemistry from University College, London, in 1855.<br>
<br>Following a short period at the Geological Society, Whitaker joined the geological survey as an assistant geologist in 1857, being promoted to geologist in 1863. On 25 August 1869 he married Mary (1846&#150;1916), daughter of Thomas Keogh, publisher, at the consul's office, Calais. They later had three children, but had separated by 1891. By this time Whitaker had, in 1882, been promoted to district surveyor, despite a superior's report in 1880 which described him as lazy, obstinate, obstructive, controversial, mutinous, and stubborn.<br>
<br>Most of Whitaker's time at the survey was taken up with applied geology in surveying, mapping, and writing of district memoirs and water supply papers that confirmed and greatly expanded the pioneering work of Professor Joseph Prestwich. However, his 1867 publication on subaerial denudation, which finally ended the belief that escarpments were formed by marine erosion, was more theoretical, original, and closely researched; it was highly praised by Charles Darwin. As early as 1889 Whitaker correctly predicted the occurrence of workable coal deposits in the south-east of England. Although he personally surveyed the major part of Essex, Suffolk, parts of Norfolk, and Cambridgeshire, his most important work was centred on London and the Thames valley, resulting in the publication of two major works in 1872 and 1889. Aubrey Strahan (1852&#150;1928) described the latter, <span class="italic">The Geology of London and of Part of the Thames Valley</span>, as probably the most detailed account of the geology of any region that had ever been published.<br>
<br>In addition to his fieldwork Whitaker meticulously compiled bibliographies on the geology of English counties and carefully collected details of wells and borings which then appeared as appendices to official publications. He has been described as the father of English hydrogeology. On his official retirement in 1896 he moved to 3 Campden Road, Croydon, Surrey, and worked as a water engineer. His knowledge of every deep well and boring from Hertfordshire to the English Channel ensured there was no better opinion on the site for any building, housing development, or sewer. Even in retirement he found time to write or assist in the production of fifteen major official water supply publications.<br>
<br>Whitaker made a great contribution to many national societies. He was elected a fellow of the Geological Society in 1859, was awarded its Murchison medal (1886), Prestwich medal (1906), and Wollaston medal (1923), and served as president (1898&#150;1900). He was elected FRS in 1887 and served on the Royal Society's council (1907&#150;9). He became an honorary member of the Geologists' Association in 1875, served two terms as president (1900&#150;02 and 1920&#150;22), and led fifty-two excursions. For two weeks in 1900 he was president of the Geological Society and the Geologists' Association, a unique achievement. In addition he was at one time delegate to the yearly meetings of the British Association, an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers, and a fellow of the Royal Sanitary Institute, and in 1890 received a silver medal from the Society of Arts. He was president of several local societies including the South Eastern Union of Scientific Societies in 1899, the Croydon Natural History Society in 1899, 1900, and 1911, and the Essex Field Club in 1911&#150;14. Whitaker was a member of the Belgian, Liverpool, Manchester, Norwich, and Yorkshire geological societies, the Hampshire Literary and Philosophical Society, Hampshire Field Club, and Hertfordshire Natural History Society. For twenty years he was co-opted vice-chairman of Croydon libraries committee. He was a staunch liberal and a member of the National Liberal Club and Croydon Liberal Association.<br>
<br>In his later years Whitaker's appearance was dominated by his long white hair and beard. He was regarded as a kind, good-tempered, unaffected, and honest gentleman. Strahan, who knew Whitaker for more than fifty years, never heard him utter an unkind word, and did not believe he ever had an unkind thought, stated: &#145;Probably no one has rendered better service to his fellow men than Whitaker in the applications of geology to the needs of civilised life&#146;  (Strahan, <span class="italic">PRS</span>, xi). Whitaker died of cancer at his home in Wellesley Court, Croydon, on 15 January 1925 and was buried in Croydon cemetery, Mitcham Road, on 19 January. He was survived by his son Harry Lynn Whitaker and a daughter, Mary de Fraine Skeats, who was living in Australia.<br>
