<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Deverell, Sir  Cyril John</span>  (1874&#150;1947), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born in St Peter Port, Guernsey, on 9 November 1874, the son of Lieutenant (later Major) John Baines Seddon Deverell and his wife, Harriet Strappini Roberts. He was educated at Bedford School and in 1895 was gazetted a second lieutenant in the 2nd battalion, the West Yorkshire regiment. In autumn 1895 he accompanied the regiment to west Africa where he took part in the bloodless Asante expedition. Shortly afterwards he transferred to the 1st battalion in India and as a result missed involvement in the South African War of 1899&#150;1902. On 31 March 1902 he married Hilda, daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Gerald Grant-Dalton, who was then his commanding officer. In 1906 he was chosen to attend the Staff College at Quetta; afterwards he held a number of staff appointments in India in which he was judged to have performed well.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of war in 1914 Deverell was back in England. He was appointed a brigade major in the 28th division, one of the first of the &#145;Kitchener's Army&#146; divisions. Deverell proceeded to France with this division early in 1915. He was constitutionally and temperamentally well suited to meeting the challenge of war, and on the western front his career flourished. Tall, broad-shouldered, and therefore physically imposing, he was also decisive and mentally robust. This combination of qualities inspired confidence in those around him and he rose from captain to major-general in two years. During the war as a whole he received three brevets and seven mentions in dispatches.<br>
<br>After serving as a brigade major throughout the second battle of Ypres in the spring of 1915, Deverell was given command of the 4th battalion of the East Yorkshire regiment with which he served for four months before being given command of the 20th brigade of the 4th division. He commanded this brigade in the early stages of the great Somme offensive of 1916 before being promoted once again&#151;this time to command the 3rd division, an appointment he held until the armistice. The 3rd division fought under his command in the latter part of the 1916 Somme offensive. It also took part in the battle of Arras (1917), in the third battle of Ypres (1917), and at Cambrai in the following year. In the last year of the war it fought in Picardy and Flanders during the German spring offensives and with General Sir Julian Byng's Third Army in the allied offensives of August to November 1918, which brought the war to an end. The 3rd division was generally regarded as a good division and Deverell as an excellent divisional commander. The 3rd division and Deverell personally particularly distinguished themselves during the final campaign.<br>
<br>After the armistice Deverell, who was appointed CB in 1918 and KBE in 1926, commanded the Welsh division of the Territorial Army for two years before going to India, where he commanded the United Provinces district for four years. In 1927 he was appointed quartermaster-general in India, and after three years in that post he was appointed chief of the general staff in Delhi. In 1931 he returned to England to take over the western command. Two years later he was promoted general and transferred to the eastern command. Deverell thus had even more experience of senior staff appointments in peacetime than he had of field commands in war. His success in both kinds of employment made it increasingly likely that he would rise to the very top of his profession. His success in commanding one of two opposing corps in large scale manoeuvres held in 1935, winning his victory by a particularly subtle operation, made him the obvious candidate to succeed Sir Archibald Montgomery-Massingberd as chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS). In 1936 he thus rose to the most senior position in the British army and was promoted field marshal. He was appointed KCB in 1929 and GCB in 1935.<br>
<br>The army in which Deverell now held the top post was in a somewhat dilapidated condition. Both regular and territorial units were desperately short of recruits and much of the equipment was obsolete. The international situation was increasingly threatening and the army of National Socialist Germany was growing fast. A rearmament programme for the regular army (though not for the Territorial Army) had been approved by the cabinet before Deverell took office. This programme had been conceived by the general staff under Montgomery-Massingberd on the basis that the British army was likely to have to fight alongside the French against the Germans, as in 1914&#150;18. But Neville Chamberlain, then chancellor of the exchequer, wished to place the main emphasis on developing British airpower, considering that this might deter war. When Chamberlain became prime minister in May 1937 he appointed a new secretary of state for war, Leslie Hore-Belisha, and Deverell came under pressure to make fundamental changes in military policy. The government decided to give a much lower priority to preparing the British army to fight on the continent, making it almost exclusively a force for home and imperial defence. A large part of the object of this new army policy was to limit expenditure on the army, particularly on tanks. As a good soldier Deverell could not and did not refuse to implement the military policy of his government. But he did not believe that it was realistic to try to check German expansion on the continent without preparing the British army to fight there. Because of Deverell's evident lack of enthusiasm for the new policy, and reluctance to contemplate radical changes in army organization, Hore-Belisha sacked him in December 1937.<br>
<br>Few would now doubt that Deverell was in the right on the policy issue at stake. Indeed the government tacitly admitted as much when it began actively preparing a field force for the continent a little over a year later. The dismissal, moreover, was handled shabbily. In public Hore-Belisha indicated that he was sacking Deverell because the ageing CIGS had become a drag on the army's rearmament. The secretary of state for war made no public reference to the fundamental difference over strategic policy which, as he admitted in private correspondence with the prime minister, was the real motive for the dismissal. Deverell was furious at the contemptuous tone which Hore-Belisha adopted in the letter dismissing him. In a written reply he indicated that his conscience was clear as to his duty to the army and as to its rearmament, and that he regarded Hore-Belisha's comments on his performance as both unjust and cruel.<br>
<br>In retirement Deverell lived at Lymington, Hampshire, where he took a prominent part in local affairs, serving on the borough council and chairing the local defence committee during the Second World War. He died at Court Lodge, Lymington, on 12 May 1947. His wife and a son and a daughter survived him. For thirteen years before his death he had been colonel of his old regiment, the West Yorkshire.<br>
