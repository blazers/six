<span class="headword">Kilvert,  Francis</span>  (1793&#150;1863), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and writer</span>, was born at 7 Caroline Buildings, Westgate Street, Bath, on 29 March 1793. He was the eldest of the seven sons and one daughter of Francis Kilvert (1757&#150;1817), a coach builder, and his wife, Anna Falkner (1764&#150;1817/18). His uncle the Revd Richard Kilvert was examining chaplain to Bishop Richard Hurd. His grandfather Robert Kilvert, yeoman, of Candover, Shropshire, was first cousin to the bishop; the Kilverts had lived in Shropshire since the twelfth century.<br>
<br>Around 1802 Kilvert's father and grandmother Elizabeth lost money in a bank failure which blighted the family fortunes. He received, however, a good education: he was tutored by Dr Rowlandson at Hungerford, and then attended King Edward's Grammar School, Bath, where he became an assistant master before leaving in 1816. He entered Worcester College, Oxford, on 6 November 1811, graduated BA in 1819, and proceeded MA in 1824. He was ordained deacon by Bishop Richard Beadon in 1816 and priest in 1817. From 1816 until his death Kilvert tutored students, initially in 5 Caroline Buildings, the home of Elizabeth Kilvert, his grandmother, to whom he was much attached and for whom he later composed a long memorial. His father died in 1817, followed by his uncle the Revd Robert Kilvert, then by his mother, and in 1821 by his grandmother. Francis Kilvert, according to his brother Robert, &#145;well discharged a parent's duty, and was the mainstay of us all&#146;  (R. Kilvert, 44).<br>
<br>In 1817 Kilvert became curate at Claverton, near which his cousins William and Frederick Falkner were farmers. He also became minister of St Mary Magdalen's Chapel, Bath, chaplain of Bath Hospital, and evening lecturer at St Mary's, Bathwick. His students&#151;&#145;a sacred trust&#146;  (F. Kilvert, xix)&#151;followed him to Claverton; in the mid-1850s these included his nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37634/', "(Robert) Francis Kilvert (1840&#150;1879)")</script>, whose diary was to become a classic a century later. Initially shy and sensitive, the boy flourished under his uncle's kind and learned guidance. In 1822 Francis Kilvert married Eleonora Adelaide Sophia Leopoldina de Chi&egrave;vre (<i>c</i>.1791&#150;1870). Serious-minded and well-read, she was French and noble by birth; as a child she had escaped to Britain from the revolution, and had lived with a Quaker family. The couple had three daughters: Anna Sophia (<i>b</i>. 1828), Elizabeth Frances Maria (<i>b</i>. 1829), and Adelaide Mary (<i>b</i>. 1830). In 1842 Mrs Kilvert published a book, <span class="italic">Home Discipline</span>, which she dedicated to her husband and children, &#145;the chief joy and happiness of my life&#146;. Kilvert himself had several publications to his name by this date: sermons preached at Christ Church before the national schools had appeared in 1827, and his sermons at St Mary's Church were published in 1837, in which year he became rector of Claverton.<br>
<br>Also in 1837 Kilvert moved into Claverton Lodge, an old and commodious house, with a library lined with glass-fronted bookcases, and with distant views across the hills. His life was filled by tutorial work, clerical duties, his family, and frequent attendances at the Bath Literary Club. Nothing ever tempted him to leave Bath. He wrote and lectured on its history, and after the publication of his <span class="italic">Ralph Allen and Prior Park</span> (1857), Joseph Hunter of the Record Office described him as &#145;the Bath biographer&#146;  (F. Kilvert, 179). His biography of <span class="italic">Richard Graves of Claverton</span> followed in 1858. Kilvert's local histories were pleasantly nostalgic descriptions of late eighteenth-century Bath of no lasting value. His literary and learned interests ranged widely. A lover of Latin poetry, especially that of Horace, in 1848 he published <span class="italic">Pinacothecae historicae specimen</span>, sprightly Latin verses on famous people, starting with the patriarch Abraham and ending with the hymn writer Isaac Watts; he included, among others, Salome, Lord Byron, Joan of Arc, and Horace Walpole. His <span class="italic">Selections from Unpublished Papers of Bishop Warburton</span> (1841) and <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life and Writings of Bishop Hurd</span> (1860) reflected his fascination with eighteenth-century scholarly bishops; Hurd had died in 1808, and Kilvert's book was the first to commemorate him. From time to time Kilvert's literary queries appeared in <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span>. After the posthumous publication in 1866 of his <span class="italic">Remains in Verse and Prose</span>, he was recalled in that journal as &#145;an accomplished scholar and pious and enlightened clergyman&#146;  (Markland, 188). Kilvert died at Claverton Lodge on 16 September 1863 and was buried in the old Widcombe churchyard, Bath. His widow moved to Bath, where she died on 10 January 1870.<br>
