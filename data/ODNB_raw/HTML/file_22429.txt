<span class="headword">Pocock,  William Innes</span>  (1783&#150;1836), <span class="occ">naval officer and artist</span>, second surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22425/', "Nicholas Pocock (1740&#150;1821)")</script>, marine painter, and his wife, Ann, who died on 27 December 1827, aged seventy-five, daughter of John Evans of Bristol, younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22422/', "Isaac Pocock")</script>, artist and dramatist, was born at Bristol in June 1783. He entered the navy in 1795, served in the East and West Indies, and from 1807 to 1810 made three voyages to the Cape of Good Hope, St Helena, and China, in the <i>St Albans</i>. In the last of these the convoy was much damaged in a storm off the Cape of Good Hope, and stayed at St Helena to refit. Pocock made several sketches of the island, which, with an account of its history, he published as <span class="italic">Five Views of the Island of St Helena</span> in 1815, Napoleon's residence on the island having made it famous. On 1 August 1811 Pocock was promoted lieutenant of the <i>Eagle</i> (74 guns), with Captain Rowley, and saw much boat-service in the Adriatic, serving with distinction and gaining significant prize-money. She was paid off in 1814, and Pocock had no further employment afloat.<br>
<br>Pocock apparently read, wrote, and painted; he was a good linguist, and reportedly published in 1815 <span class="italic">Naval records: consisting of a series of engravings from original designs by Nicholas Pocock, illustrative of the principal engagements at sea since the commencement of the war in 1793, with an account of each action</span> and also pamphlets on naval subjects. In his last year, despite ill health, he worked on a plan for using steam vessels in war, for which he had a model steam tug constructed.<br>
<br>Pocock was twice married. His first wife was Anne, only daughter of Thomas Wilson, of Ives Place, near Maidenhead: they had three daughters. His second wife was Elizabeth Anne, only daughter of Dr Richard Pearson (1765&#150;1836), the eminent physician: they had one son and three daughters, and she survived him. He died at Reading on 13 March 1836, and was interred at Bray church, Berkshire. He has been confused with William Fuller Pocock, architect and artist.<br>
