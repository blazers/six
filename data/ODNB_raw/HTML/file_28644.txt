<span class="headword">Walters,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1721, <em>d.</em> 1797), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and lexicographer</span>, was baptized on 22 August 1721 in Llanedi, Carmarthenshire, the son of John Walters (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1734), timber merchant. Local tradition claims that he was born in a small house in the hamlet of Fforest, near Llanedi  (Rowlands, 528). His parents died during his adolescence. He kept a school in Basaleg, Monmouthshire, and then went to Cowbridge School to improve his Greek and Latin. This enabled him to obtain a post as a schoolmaster at Margam, Glamorgan, and there he won the support of the Mansel Talbot family. He was ordained priest in 1750, obtained the curacy of Baglan, Glamorgan, and was appointed perpetual curate in Michaelston, Glamorgan, in 1754.<br>
<br>Walters married Hannah Clark, housekeeper to the Talbot family, on 14 September 1758, and they had five sons: John (1760&#150;1789), Daniel (1762&#150;1787), Henry (1766&#150;1829), William (1770&#150;1789), Lewis (1772&#150;1844). The Welsh bard Edward Williams 
    (Iolo Morganwg; 1747&#150;1826)
   admired Walters's scholarship but described him as being &#145;a severe Father&#146; and claimed that he &#145;kept his Children at too great a distance&#146;. He was &#145;fastidious, Extremely formal, punctilious, squeamish rather than [having] fine Taste, had an eye more microscopic than Telescopic, very much afraid of going to law&#146;  (Williams, 146).<br>
<br>On 1 March 1759 Walters obtained the rectory of Llandough and on 10 August the same year the vicarage of St Hilary, near Cowbridge, Glamorgan. He also served in the adjacent parish of St Mary, was made chaplain to the high sheriff of Glamorgan in 1783 and prebendary to Llandaff Cathedral in 1795, and served as domestic chaplain to the Mansel family  (<span class="italic">Archaeologia Cambrensis</span>, 238).<br>
<br>Walters's earliest literary work appears to be the unpublished &#145;The history of the noble family of the Mansels&#146; (1752), now in the National Library of Wales. His &#145;Dissertation on the Welsh language&#146;, first published in 1771, was appended to each edition of his dictionary. He was also the author of <span class="italic">Dwy bregeth ar Ezec. xxxiii. &#150; 11, etc.</span> (&#145;Two sermons on Ezek. xxxiii. &#150; 11, etc.&#146;) (1772) and &#145;An Ode to Humanity&#146;, which was appended to <span class="italic">An Ode on the Immortality of the Soul</span> (1786) by his eldest son, <a href="#cosubject_28643">John Walters [<i>see below</i>]</a>.<br>
<br>Walters's most important work was <span class="italic">An English&#150;Welsh Dictionary</span>, which was published in fifteen parts between 1770 and 1794. From 1770 to 1776 the parts came out regularly, but by 1776 progress had slowed down owing to financial difficulties. Walters complained that many of the subscribers (who included Samuel Johnson, William Seward, and Mrs Thrale) did not pay for the parts as they were published. Moreover Rhys Thomas, the printer, who had moved from Llandovery to print the dictionary and thereby establish the first printing press in Glamorgan, was also in deep financial trouble. Only four parts were published between 1778 and 1783, and the final parts were published in London in 1794 by Owen Jones 
    (Owain Myfyr; 1741&#150;1814)
  .<br>
<br>Walters had obtained the manuscript of William Gambold's unpublished English&#150;Welsh dictionary and used it in compiling his own work. Walters's dictionary, like Gambold's, not only gives translations for individual words but also translates English idioms. Its aim was to enable Welsh writers to discuss all branches of knowledge and the arts in Welsh, and Walters accomplished this by drawing on the resources of the literary language and the spoken language, as well as coining many new words, many of which gained currency and are still used today. Two other editions of the dictionary were published, one in 1815 and the other by Walters's granddaughter Hannah, in 1828. Walters died on 1 June 1797 at Cowbridge, leaving a widow and two sons, and was buried at Llandough on 4 June 1797.<br>
<br>His eldest son, <a name="cosubject_28643"></a><span class="headword">John Walters</span>  (1760&#150;1789), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and scholar</span>, was born on 11 June 1760 at Llandough parsonage, Glamorgan. He was educated at Cowbridge School, where he later became headmaster (1783), and at Jesus College, Oxford, which he entered on 17 December 1777. He served for a time as sub-librarian in the Bodleian Library, and proceeded BA on 21 June 1781 and MA on 10 July 1784. He became headmaster of Ruthin School in 1784, and subsequently rector of Efenechdid, Denbighshire. He married Jane Davies (<i>b</i>. 1766) on 23 February 1785.<br>
<br>The younger John Walters is chiefly remembered as a poet, and in his day was regarded as a promising young scholar. He published his volume of poems, <span class="italic">Poems with Notes</span> (1780), while at Jesus College and a volume of metrical translations of old Welsh poems, <span class="italic">Translated Specimens of Welsh Poetry</span> (1782). His edition of Llywarch Hen's poems with a literal English translation were included in the Revd W. Warrington's <span class="italic">The History of Wales</span> (1788) and he also supplied notes for Edward Jones's <span class="italic">Musical and Poetical Relicks of the Welsh Bards</span> (1784). He published several other works, including a reprint of Roger Ascham's <span class="italic">Toxophilus</span> (1778), as well as a number of sermons. Walters died on 28 June 1789 in Ruthin, possibly of tuberculosis, leaving a widow and two daughters. He was buried on 1 July at Efenechdid, where a monument, with a long Latin inscription by his father, was erected to his memory.<br>
