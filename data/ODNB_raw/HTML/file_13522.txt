<span class="headword">Holland,  Henry</span>  (1550&#150;1625), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest</span>, was a native of Daventry, Northamptonshire, of whose family nothing is recorded except that he was related to the last abbot of Westminster, John Feckenham (1518&#150;1585). Brought up at Worcester, he was sent for his further education to Eton College and on 24 March 1566 was admitted as scholar to St John's College, Oxford, where he was a contemporary of his future colleagues Edmund Campion and Gregory Martin. His education is aptly summed up in the epitaph recorded by Wood,<blockquote>Dantria me genuit, me clara Vigornia fovit,/Aetona me docuit, post docet Oxonium (Daventry bore me, famous Worcester reared me, Eton taught me, and now Oxford teaches me) (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.386)</blockquote>After receiving his BA in 1569 Holland was converted to Rome and made his way to the English College, Douai, in 1573. There, after studying theology, he was ordained deacon on 6 April 1577, graduated BD at the University of Douai in 1578 and, after the difficulties involved in moving the college from Douai to Rheims that year, was eventually ordained priest on 19 March 1580. He went on to win some fame as preacher there, while collaborating with Gregory Martin in the Rheims translation of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, which was published in 1582.<br>
<br>Once his task of translation was over Holland was sent on the English mission, where he laboured for several years while living with his sister at Cleeve, Gloucestershire. By 1587 he was back at Douai to receive a licentiate of theology from the university there. On again venturing into England, however, he was arrested in January 1600 at the house of a Mr Sweating in Yorkshire and was imprisoned for a time in York Castle.<br>
<br>From then on Holland seems to have spent the rest of his life in Flanders as divinity reader at the two monasteries of Marchiennes in Hainault and Anchine near Douai. To this period belong various Latin writings, notably his <span class="italic">Urna aurea, vel, In sacrosanctam missam &hellip; expositio</span>, which was published at Douai in 1612. Another issue, with the altered title of <span class="italic">Arca novi foederis in sacrosanctae missae canone representata</span>, was published at Antwerp in 1615. In the title he is accorded the rank of canon. He probably edited the collected works of Thomas Stapleton, with his own <span class="italic">Vita Thomae Stapletonii</span>; they appeared in four volumes at Paris in 1620, being the one substantial achievement of the group of Catholic controversialists at the college of Arras (founded in 1611). It was finally at the monastery of Anchine that, as Wood remarks, Holland &#145;gave way to fate in good old age&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.386) and died on 28 September 1625.<br>
