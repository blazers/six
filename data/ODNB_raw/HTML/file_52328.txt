<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Latham,  Baldwin</span>  (1836&#150;1917), <span class="occ">civil engineer and meteorologist</span>, was born on 6 December 1836 in Nantwich, Cheshire, the son of George Latham, architect and surveyor. After attending Nantwich grammar school he entered his father's office in 1851, and served the usual three-year pupillage as a civil engineer. He then moved to Sandiway, Cheshire, to work for three years with the contractors Douglas and Beckett before joining Joseph Glyn, a civil engineer and fellow of the Royal Society, in the fens at Ely. In 1860 Latham went into business on his own account in Ely, and on 24 November 1863 he married Ann Elizabeth, daughter of William Neal, draper, of Ely, with whom he moved to Croydon and raised a large family.<br>
<br>In 1865 John Rennie proposed Latham for associate membership of the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE). The proposal form gave details of the many vestries, local boards, and town councils for which he had already worked, including Dorking, Merton, Rugby, Warwick, Reigate, and Croydon. By 1868 Latham had designed the sewerage, irrigation, and water works for fifteen English towns. He had also begun a series of nearly forty papers reporting on these and related matters. The minutes of the ICE <span class="italic">Proceedings</span> show him to have been a regular attender of and lively contributor to the institution meetings.<br>
<br>His professional interest in water, its supply, management, and disposal, led to Latham's involvement with many of the scientific societies of the day. He joined the British Association in 1870 and in 1876 he was elected a member of the Royal Sanitary Institute. In the same year he joined the Geological Society and the Royal Meteorological Society, becoming president of the latter in 1890 and 1891. He was particularly interested in rainfall, and encouraged many members of the Croydon Natural History and Philosophical Society to set up rain gauges. They sent the resulting reports to the British Rainfall Organisation set up by G. J. Symons. Latham was the first to devise a recording rain gauge. Latham became a well-known personality in the Croydon area, and his civic involvement extended to becoming a member of the Guild of Playing Card Manufacturers. His meteorological friends were startled to receive packs of playing cards instead of Christmas cards one year, with a portrait of their friend in the full regalia of the master of the guild set in the centre of the ace of spades. He belonged to the guild for forty-two years, being master twice. The guild assessed playing card design in an annual competition, and met regularly to dine together. More usefully, they acted as a source of help for families of members and, during the First World War, arranged for thousands of packs of cards to be distributed to hospitals for soldiers both in Britain and overseas.<br>
<br>Latham is best remembered for his contributions to public water supply, particularly in the Croydon area. His book, <span class="italic">Sanitary Engineering, a Guide to the Construction of Sewerage and House Drainage</span> (1873, 2nd edn, 1878) was regarded as a classic in its day. In the latter part of his life, he analysed the parish records of Croydon from their commencement in 1538 to identify deaths caused by water-borne diseases. He constructed from this a summary of the state of Croydon's water year by year to 1900. His interest in the characteristics of the district's hydrology continued undiminished, and they formed the subject of the last paper he gave, to the Croydon Natural History and Philosophical Society. It was in press when Latham died, on 13 March 1917, at his home, Park Hill House, Stanhope Road, Croydon, aged eighty-one; he suffered from phlebitis and a pulmonary embolism. He was buried at Croydon cemetery on 19 March. He was survived by his wife.<br>
