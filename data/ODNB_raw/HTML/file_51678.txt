<span class="headword">Macdonald,  George</span>  (1903&#150;1967), <span class="occ">malariologist</span>, was born at 7 Summerfield, Ecclesall, Bierlow, Sheffield, on 22 June 1903, the son of John Smyth Macdonald (1867&#150;1941), professor of physiology at Sheffield University and later at Liverpool, and his wife, Katherine Mary Stewart of Stornoway, Isle of Lewis. He was educated at the King Edward VII School in Sheffield, and, after the family moved to Liverpool in 1914, at the Liverpool Institute and the University of Liverpool, where he graduated MB ChB in 1924; in the same year he took the diploma of tropical medicine at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.<br>
<br>In 1925 Macdonald was appointed research assistant at the Sir Alfred Jones Research Laboratory at Freetown, Sierra Leone, the Liverpool school's field station. He was there for four years, during which he carried out important research into the epidemiology of malaria in children, noticing that parasitaemia in African children was mathematically related to the number of infective bites in the population. He then went to India and, after two years as a malaria research officer with the Malaria Survey of India, was appointed medical officer for the Mariani Medical Association in Assam in 1932. It was also in 1932 that he obtained the degree of MD from Liverpool and the diploma in public health from London. On 27 July that year he married Mary (<i>b</i>. 1906/7), daughter of Sir Roger Gaskell Hetherington (1876&#150;1952), chief engineering inspector at the Ministry of Health; they had one son and two daughters.<br>
<br>In 1937 Sir Malcolm Watson offered Macdonald the post of assistant director at the Ross Institute for Tropical Hygiene. As a result, Macdonald spent eighteen months in Ceylon as malariologist to the Ross Institute's malaria control scheme for tea and rubber estates. Soon after his return to Britain in 1939 war broke out and he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps, where he soon was promoted to the rank of brigadier. In 1940 the War Office appointed him to form and command successively nos. 1, 2, and 3 malaria field laboratories in the Middle East and central Mediterranean, and it was claimed that the low incidence of malaria among the British troops was the result of his influence. In 1943 he was mentioned in dispatches. He returned to the Ross Institute as director in 1945.<br>
<br>Macdonald was next appointed to the chair of tropical hygiene in the University of London, in 1946. He became MRCP in 1948 and was appointed a member of the expert panel on malaria of the World Health Organization (WHO). In 1952 he led the WHO mission to Korea and in 1954 he was awarded the Darling foundation medal and prize by the World Health Assembly for his work on the epidemiology of malaria. Macdonald had been appointed CMG in 1953 and he was elected FRCP two years later. His classic work, <span class="italic">The Epidemiology and Control of Malaria</span>, was published in 1957. However, though he worked extensively in the field of malaria control, Macdonald's methods were not compatible with that of some of the other malariologists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. His epidemiological approach was based on mathematical work to establish biological models which could be understood by non-mathematicians. Professor P. C. C. Garnham, professor of protozoology at the school, differed from Macdonald, concentrating on the parasitology of malaria. This led to an unfortunate diversification of effort within the school and a considerable amount of ill feeling, as both men could be scathing in their comments.<br>
<br>In 1964 Macdonald transferred his attention to schistosomiasis, applying his mathematical analysis to its epidemiology, so that work according to his models run on a computer showed a striking similarity to that done in the field. Macdonald was elected president of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in 1965, a position that he held until shortly before his death. He was diagnosed with lung cancer in late 1966 and died in University College Hospital, London, on 10 December 1967. Until a few weeks before his death he was working on the application of mathematical models to the epidemiology of insect-borne diseases. His funeral at St Michael's Church, Highgate, London, on 12 December, was followed by cremation.<br>
<br>George Macdonald's work on the epidemiology of malaria expanded the initial work of Sir Ronald Ross and provided a basis from which subsequent developments have stemmed. Despite his acerbic tongue and intolerance of sub-standard work, he was helpful and kind to those who turned to him for assistance. The <span class="italic">Times</span> obituary of 15 December stated, &#145;he was not apt to display himself as a great man. But he had the qualities of greatness, and his friends miss him&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>).<br>
