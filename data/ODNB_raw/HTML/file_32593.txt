<span class="headword">Cowans, Sir  John Steven</span>  (1862&#150;1921), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 11 March 1862, at Woodbank, St Cuthbert Without, Carlisle, the eldest son of John Cowans and his wife, Jeannie (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Steven). His father was a prominent civil engineer, who founded Cowans, Sheldon &amp; Co., cranemakers, at Carlisle, before retiring to a mansion and parkland, Hartland, at Cranford, Middlesex. John, who was known to his family and friends as Jack, was sent to Dr Burney's academy at Gosport, to prepare for the entrance examination for the navy. In 1878 he failed and went instead to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, where he passed out near the top of the list in 1880 and joined the rifle brigade. This was one of the most socially prestigious infantry regiments, and he joined it in the same year as Henry Wilson and Charles &agrave; Court Repington, the latter a lifelong friend who, as a journalist in the First World War, staunchly defended Cowans's career and reputation. In 1881 Cowans became an aide-de-camp to Sir John Ross, who commanded the Poona division of the Bombay army. On 14 February 1884 Cowans married Eva Mary (<i>b</i>. 1858/9), daughter of John Edward Coulson, vicar of Long Preston, Yorkshire. They had no children. Cowans passed the Staff College course with distinction in 1890.<h2>
<a name="Earlystaffcareer"></a>Early staff career</h2>Shortly afterwards Cowans made an impact as an industrious staff captain at the newly created mobilization section, where the development of improved procedures for the dispatch of forces overseas remained at an elementary stage in the aftermath of the Khartoum fiasco of 1886. Despite earnestly volunteering for active service Cowans arrived in India shortly after the conclusion of the Burma campaign in 1890 and too soon for action on the north-west frontier in 1897. In 1898 he became deputy assistant quartermaster-general and supervised transport for the expedition to Egypt; he was promoted major in 1898 and lieutenant-colonel in 1900. He remained on staff duties in London throughout the South African War and, afterwards, having been gazetted colonel in 1903, he reviewed the mobilization plans of the 2nd division at Aldershot. In 1906 he returned to India as director of military education, a post he held until 1907 and in which he investigated the professional education of the officer corps at Lord Kitchener's behest. He served in India as director of staff duties (1907&#150;8) and commanded the Bengal presidency brigade (1908&#150;10). In 1910 Cowans returned to the War Office in London as director-general of the Territorial Force, and his commitment to the strengthening of the reservists, in numbers and equipment, reinforced the important role which they were expected to play if a continental commitment became necessary. In 1912 his crucial role in the mobilization plans for the British expeditionary force was confirmed by his appointment as quartermaster-general. In this post he was the supreme administrator of the supply services of the army, including accommodation, food, horses, clothing, and equipment, with responsibility for liaising with the Admiralty for their transport to the operational theatre. On the outbreak of war in 1914 Cowans was, by virtue of this appointment, the third military member of the army council. Lord Kitchener, who recognized his growing reputation for administrative ability, forbade him to go to France, but Cowans's route to high office clearly offended some military commentators. He was created KCB in 1913.<h2>
<a name="FirstWorldWar"></a>First World War</h2>In August 1914 it soon became clear that the quartermaster-general's branch would have to enlarge its functions dramatically to cope with the supply implications of mass industrialized war. Cowans managed the expansion of his department's work through a mixture of judicious personal intervention, excellent appointments which facilitated substantial delegation, patience in the face of the unprecedented task, and, in the early years, the maximizing of voluntary patriotic activity. Billeting provides an example of the scale of Cowans's problems and a measure of his success. The pre-war capacity of barrack accommodation was 175,000 men, yet by January 1915, 1,185,000 men had enlisted. In harsh, wintry conditions, large hutted camps were rapidly constructed to billet the recruits, although much depended on local raisers of manpower, who funded and employed labour, to construct the camps. This decentralized process was not the answer to the provision of divisional training centres in 1915, and the delays which ensued were more problematic than Cowans suggested in his post-war report on the supply services. The arrival of Dominion and, later, American troops, the growth of the technical arms of the army, and the expected evacuation of many services from France in March 1918 ensured that the availability of military accommodation in the United Kingdom (which was serving 1,750,000 men and women in 1918) remained a problem that never went away.<br>
<br>The pre-war horse census that Cowans had conducted ensured their rapid mobilization in 1914. He was also alert to the relatively novel value of motor lorries for carrying food, ammunition, and stores; they were eventually co-ordinated by the establishment of the Mechanical Transport Board in 1917. In semi-official correspondence with Edith, marchioness of Londonderry, founder of the Women's Legion, he accepted the employment of uniformed women for military-related work, and was more sympathetic to the practice of releasing men for front-line service by employing women to fill their former positions than were most general officers. He appointed quartermaster inspectors to control waste and promote salvage in 1915, and had a high regard for the work of voluntary organizations, such as the YMCA, which provided rest and recreation facilities for the forces both in Britain and on the fighting fronts. Cowans was instrumental in making valuable resources available to the YMCA, and its director, Arthur Yapp, referred to him in thankful terms as a &#145;genial autocrat&#146;  (Chapman-Huston and Rutter, 250).<br>
<br>Unlike some military administrators who operated in tightly focused departments and thought in &#145;pennyworths&#146;, Cowans understood that civil and military responsibilities, if well defined, were complementary in conditions of total war, and he had the capacity of &#145;going large&#146;  (Chapman-Huston and Rutter, 310) to ensure the availability of sufficient quantities of materials, whether entrenching tools or frost-bite ointment. The efficiency of the army postal service, the army veterinary corps, and army clothing department all bore testimony to his willingness to use civilian improvisers, albeit in roles subordinate to the military chain of command. But for all his willingness to maintain a wider perspective and to employ outside experts, Cowans was not a modernizer. His department's vulnerability to political interference stemmed from his adherence to the social presuppositions of the old regular army, and, in November 1916, threatened to bring about his downfall. Under new statutory provisions a court of enquiry admonished his &#145;departure from official propriety&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reports</span>, 4.327, 16 Nov 1916). When Mrs Cornwallis-West (better known as the actress Mrs Patrick Campbell) pursued a grievance against a young subaltern, which resulted in his peremptory transfer and unfair treatment, Cowans lent her his support, agreeing to &#145;fight for her if he had time&#146;  (ibid.). His intervention conveyed the impression that upholding the interests of the privileged social &eacute;lite remained paramount at the unreconstructed War Office. Furthermore, in a separate case, Mrs Cornwallis-West corresponded with Cowans to recommend for promotion an infantry colonel of her acquaintance, at the same time criticizing another officer, and the court of inquiry found that Cowans had intervened in an issue far beyond his department's jurisdiction. Apart from the question of &#145;petticoat influence&#146; at the War Office, Lloyd George, then secretary of state for war, reflected unfavourably on the adverse effects of this interference for &#145;the man at the bottom&#146;  (Taylor, 125), and the king's intervention merely increased Lloyd George's resolve to remove Cowans from the War Office. He owed the retention of his office to the political crisis of December 1916. Prime minister Lloyd George decided that continuity of office was more important than a demonstration of his power over the generals by a round of dismissals. The government's displeasure with Cowans was stated in the House of Commons on 22 December 1916, but its impact was limited by Lloyd George's knowledge that significant improvements had taken place in the administration of supply services for the Mesopotamian campaign, which came under Cowans's direction after July 1916.<br>
<br>Unsurprisingly Cowans regarded Asquith's resignation as the greatest blow to the British war effort after the death of Kitchener. Cowans was a warm admirer of Asquith, and, unlike many of his colleagues at the War Office, in March 1914 had been intent on &#145;damage limitation&#146; during the Curragh mutiny  (Beckett, 23). In return Asquith had respected the soldier's quest for autonomy in strategic and supply policy formulation. After 1916 the necessity for more collaborative inter-allied schemes to conserve scarce manpower and resources worried Cowans. Along with the adjutant-general, General Sir Nevil Macready, he resisted the plans for a common pool of manpower and material resources on the western front in 1918 and opposed the principle of unity of stores as a corollary of unity of command. Throughout the war the quartermaster's branch (or Q) remained a lively intersection of civil&#150;military relations. For example, the survey and expansion of military railways in all theatres of war that in 1917 came under the supervision of businessman Sir Eric Geddes provided a constant reminder that the Q side of the War Office would be &#145;civilianized&#146;. Cowans's old friend and ally, Charles Repington, vociferously opposed such a scheme in the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> in September 1918.<h2>
<a name="Reputation"></a>Reputation</h2>Remarkably, therefore, Cowans was the only military member of the army council to remain in place throughout the war. He was a successful administrator within a hierarchical decision-making process with well-defined functions. He worked hard and late into the night, but not to the exclusion of social lunches and dinners. He depended on six hours' sleep a night, but left London every weekend for country house parties or to play golf. He demonstrated unostentatious efficiency and much adaptability in an army which desperately needed such unfashionable skills. Although Cowans and Lloyd George were personally incompatible, in his <span class="italic">War Memoirs</span> (1938) Lloyd George commended Cowans as &#145;the most capable soldier thrown up by the War in our Army&#146;  (Lloyd George, 1.493), excluding him from his otherwise comprehensive condemnation of &#145;brass hats&#146; in London and on the western front. Many tributes included in Chapman-Huston and Rutter's two-volume hagiography (1924) noted Cowans's good humour, hearty laugh, and lurid story-telling. Asquith and George V agreed that if victory was attributable to any individuals, it was to Cowans and Sir Maurice Hankey  (Roskill, 1.631), but few subsequent studies of Britain's war effort have troubled to acknowledge or assess the significance of this pre-eminent military administrator.<h2>
<a name="Retirementanddeath"></a>Retirement and death</h2>Cowans finally reached the rank of general in 1919, and received the GCB. He abruptly left the War Office in March 1919 to accept an invitation from Shell Transport and Trading Company to visit Mesopotamia and survey its progress in oil exploration prior to joining the company. He looked forward to inaugurating a business career which would bring new challenges and increased remuneration. Moreover, leaving the army gave him the freedom to express his disgust at the absence of any reference to the work of the administrative services of the army in parliament's expression of thanks to the armed forces in July 1919. His letter of protest to Lloyd George was followed by a speech accepting the freedom of his home city, Carlisle, on 18 September 1919, in which he informed his audience that the war was essentially a contest of administration, rather than strategy, and asserted that the Q department had succeeded in meeting all demands placed upon it.<br>
<br>In 1920 Cowans's health declined quickly. He had an operation for a kidney condition in November 1920, but died on 16 April 1921 at the Villa Louise, Garavan, Menton, in the south of France, where he had gone to convalesce. He had been received into the Roman Catholic church five days earlier. He lay in state in Westminster Cathedral, and his funeral procession, in which many battalions of infantry took part, on 25 April, followed the long route of 5 miles to Kensal Green cemetery. The sombre spectacle reflected the endeavour to come to terms with a new type of military leader, the great departmental chief who had little experience of the battlefield. Cowans had been extravagant in many ways, and debt consumed his estate. To the king's chagrin his widow declined a pension, and to his consternation Cowans's orders and decorations were put up for sale shortly after his death. They were bought privately by his service friends and were subsequently placed in the United Services Museum. Cowans survived the blandishments of Mrs Cornwallis-West with his reputation intact and accusations of jobbery unproven, but four years after his death &#145;his name was dragged into one of the most lurid court cases of the post-war period&#146;  (Grigg, 369). In the early stages of the <i>Dennistoun v. Dennistoun</i> (1925) case mention was made of &#145;General X&#146; as the lover of Mrs Dorothy Dennistoun in the years 1916&#150;1920. During this alimony case she revealed, in the witness box, that he was Cowans, which caused a sensation.<br>
