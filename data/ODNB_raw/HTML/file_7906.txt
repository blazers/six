<span class="headword">Douglas,  Janet</span>, Lady Glamis  (<em>c.</em>1504&#150;1537), <span class="occ">noblewoman</span>, was the daughter of George Douglas, master of Douglas, who was killed at Flodden in 1513 and so predeceased his father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7864/', "Archibald Douglas, fifth earl of Angus")</script>, by a few weeks, and of his wife Elizabeth Drummond. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7866/', "Archibald Douglas, sixth earl of Angus")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7885/', "Sir George Douglas of Pittendriech")</script> were her brothers; she also had at least one other brother and four sisters. In 1520, when she was probably aged about sixteen, she married John Lyon, sixth Lord Glamis. He died on 17 September 1528, leaving a minor as his heir, and three other children. In the same year James V succeeded in escaping from the control of his stepfather, the sixth earl of Angus, who had married James IV's widow Margaret Tudor and established his own authority. James had come to loathe his guardian, a development evident in the proclamation made at Stirling on 29 June that year, that Angus should not come within 7 miles of the king, ostensibly because of his misrule and failure to maintain justice. Within a year Angus was in exile in England.<br>
<br>The king's antagonism extended to other members of the Douglas family, and particularly to Janet, who in December 1528 and again in January 1529 was summoned to appear before parliament to answer the charge of art and part assistance to her brothers given at Edinburgh the previous June. Her husband had made his final appearance on the council early in July 1528, so it is certainly possible that his wife could have been in Edinburgh at that time. Patrick Charteris of Cuthilgurdy, Hugh Kennedy of Girvanmains, and John Hume of Blackadder were summoned for the same offence, but Kennedy and Hume received a remission, whereas (perhaps as an alternative to remission) Janet and Charteris were granted licence to go overseas on pilgrimage on 20 September 1529, being given respite from actions against them until their return. However, Janet does not appear to have left the country, as she was pursuing a legal action against John Lyon of Knockany through the winter of 1529&#150;30.<br>
<br>Janet Douglas had come under suspicion again by June 1531, when she was described as &#145;fugitive fra the law and at the horne &hellip; for intercommonying with our soverane lordis rebellis&#146;  (Livingstone, no. 951). By 31 January 1532 she was being prosecuted for the alleged poisoning of her late husband, whose early death was obviously now being viewed as suspicious. However, the assizes which followed in January and February were drawn from the localities of Forfar, Perth, Aberdeen, and Fife, areas where the Lyon family held estates, and the reluctance of local lairds to serve on them is reflected in the numerous fines which were levied for default. The prosecution against Janet was dropped, and James V's suspicions against her seem to have been allayed, since by July 1532 she had contracted a second marriage, to Archibald Campbell of Skipness (<i>d</i>. 1537), the younger son of Archibald Campbell, second earl of Argyll, and uncle of the fourth earl. They had no children.<br>
<br>In the years which followed Janet brought several legal actions concerning rents and payments, mostly with success, but events were to turn against her in 1537. On 15 June her son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17277/', "John Lyon, the young seventh Lord Glamis")</script>, was ordered to remain in ward in Edinburgh Castle, and on 17 July Janet Douglas herself was convicted on two points of treason: conspiring and imagining the death of the king by poison, and assisting and communicating with her brothers. This assize was mixed in composition, with no overwhelming local bias; the sentence which followed, that Janet should be burned on Edinburgh's castle hill, was carried out at once. Her husband, who had been imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle, broke his neck while trying to escape on the following day. Her son was convicted, also on 18 July, of concealing his mother's conspiracy to poison the king, though the sentence of hanging and drawing was commuted to imprisonment. On 22 August John Lyon of Knockany was convicted of concealing Janet's conspiracy, and of plotting to use the same poison to kill the earl of Rothes. One Alexander Mackie was convicted of supplying the poison, and was sentenced to be banished to Aberdeenshire, while Lyon was hanged and beheaded. After the death of James V, Lord Lyon claimed that he had been tortured into confessing to a poison plot, and in any case, given the king's obvious suspicion of Janet, it is difficult to see how she could have been in a position to poison him, as she does not appear to have attended court. It is possible that the antipathy felt by the earl of Rothes to the Glamis family played some part in the poison allegations, as he certainly stood to benefit from their downfall, though in the event he profited less than he would have liked: the king's annexation of the Glamis estates, of Janet's terce in Aberdeenshire, and of the estate of John Lyon of Knockany raised &pound;5770 for the exchequer between 1538 and the end of James's reign.<br>
<br>The real motive behind the king's pursuit of the case against Janet Douglas is far more likely to have been implicit in the second part of the charge, the assistance she had allegedly given to her brothers. The popular sympathy said to have been felt for her as a beautiful young woman, taken together with the fact that she was the highest-ranking person to be executed during the personal rule of James V, may obscure the fact that the king genuinely detested the Angus faction and had just returned from a nine-month absence in France during which various potentially treasonable plots had been reported. Unlike her sisters Janet had always been suspected by the king of close links with her brothers, and he was anxious to underline his supremacy on his return and to emphasize the end of Angus influence, not least by his commitment to a French alliance, rejecting the foreign policy once pursued by his stepfather. Notwithstanding its brutality the public execution of Janet Douglas was not without a rationale, in that it sent an unmistakable message not only to the Douglases but also to any other potential rebels.<br>
