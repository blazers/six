<span class="headword">Tinling,  Cuthbert Collingwood <span class="st"> [Teddy]</span></span>  (1910&#150;1990), <span class="occ">fashion designer</span>, was born on 23 June 1910 in Eastbourne, Sussex, the youngest of the three sons of James Alexander Tinling, chartered accountant, and his wife, Florence Mary Elizabeth Buckland. He was christened Cuthbert after his great-grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5930/', "Admiral Cuthbert (first Baron) Collingwood")</script>, but his parents changed his name to Teddy during the First World War because Cuthbert was the name given to conscientious objectors in cartoons in the <span class="italic">Evening News</span>. Much later he shortened this to Ted, on the advice of his agent, when he became a popular guest on television chat shows in the United States. Because of his chronic asthma the family moved to the French riviera after the war, and he spent the rest of his childhood in Nice, on his own with his mother after his father had to return to England. He attended a Roman Catholic day school.<br>
<br>As a schoolboy Tinling joined the Nice tennis club; he umpired a match for Suzanne Lenglen at the age of thirteen, and became a devoted member of her entourage. He mixed with high society on the French riviera while still in his teens, umpiring and refereeing matches and organizing tournaments. Suzanne Lenglen, with her flowing pure silk dresses and silk bandeau around her head, became his idol and inspiration. His first tennis dress was designed for her, in 1937, for her last world tour.<br>
<br>In 1927 Tinling was sent to London to study dress designing, and when he set up his own business there in 1931 many of his clients were friends he had made in the south of France. Within a year he had expanded into premises in Mayfair and shown his first collection. He soon had a reputation in haute couture to rival that of Hardy Amies and Norman Hartnell, and in 1938 he made fourteen wedding dresses for society weddings at St Margaret's, Westminster.<br>
<br>At the same time Tinling remained involved in the world of tennis, especially at Wimbledon, where he worked from 1927 to 1949 during the two weeks of the championships as the &#145;call boy&#146;, responsible for escorting players from their dressing-rooms to the centre court and court no. 1 for their matches. In 1928 he was also asked to act as a liaison between the Wimbledon committee and the players, and he did this until 1949. A keen amateur player himself, Tinling played on the amateur circuit from 1935 until 1950, captaining Sussex for many years, and he first played at Wimbledon in 1948.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Tinling served in the intelligence corps in Algiers and Germany, and he remained in the army until 1947. He reached the rank of lieutenant-colonel.<br>
<br>Having resumed his career as a couturier in 1947, Tinling became known as a designer of tennis dresses. He believed that women tennis players should wear clothes that stressed their femininity. He designed his first Wimbledon tennis dress for Joy Gannon in 1947, and became famous in 1949 when &#145;Gorgeous Gussy&#146; Moran asked him to design her tennis dresses for Wimbledon, and the underwear to go with them. The lace-trimmed panties he made for her caused a sensation, and, told he had put vulgarity and sin into tennis, he was barred from working at Wimbledon for many years. However, he continued to design tennis dresses for the leading women players. For ten successive years, from 1952 to 1961, he dressed the winner of the Wimbledon women's singles title, and in 1973 the five major championships in the world were won by players wearing his dresses. In 1970 he was appointed official designer to the Virginia Slims women's professional circuit, and in eight years he created more than 1000 different dresses, embroidered with sequins, woven with silver threads, and covered with frills and bows. However, in the late 1970s the top players were attracted by large sponsorship contracts to wear sportswear separates designed by large manufacturers, and Tinling gave up designing tennis dresses. He settled in Philadelphia in the USA in 1976.<br>
<br>Tinling made fourteen wedding dresses for tennis stars, including a dress for &#145;Little Mo&#146; Connolly for her wedding in California in 1955, and ones for Christine Truman and Chris Evert. In June 1986, as part of the celebration of the centenary of the Wimbledon championships, an exhibition of Tinling's tennis creations was mounted at the Victoria and Albert Museum. The exhibits included some of the coloured dresses he had designed during the war, when the all-white rule was suspended, such as Kay Stammers's pink dress of 1941. Also on display were Maria Bueno's dress with its &#145;Cleopatra&#146; embroidery, Rosie Casals's black-sequinned dress, and Billie Jean King's rhinestone-studded dress of 1973. In the 1980s he admired the ice dancer Jayne Torville, and always said that the movements of a good tennis player were as beautiful and graceful as those of an ice skater or ballerina. In 1982 Tinling became assistant to the president of the International Tennis Federation in Paris, and shortly afterwards he was invited to become head of the Wimbledon liaison committee once again, a job he continued to do until his death.<br>
<br>Very tall (6 feet 6 inches), with a shining bald head, shaved on the advice of Vidal Sassoon, Tinling wore a large diamond in one ear and several bracelets on his wrists. He was witty and outrageous, and was often compared with Oscar Wilde and Sir No&euml;l Coward. Apart from tennis and fashion, his other enthusiasms included the music of Richard Wagner and tenpin bowling. Tinling died on 23 May 1990 in Cambridge. He was unmarried. Many tennis stars attended his memorial service at St James's, Piccadilly, London, on 24 June 1990, the eve of Wimbledon.<br>
