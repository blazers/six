<span class="headword">Goossens,  (Annie) Sidonie <span class="st"> [Sid]</span></span>  (1899&#150;2004), <span class="occ">harpist</span>, was born at 78 Seaview Road, Liscard, Cheshire, on 19 October 1899, the fifth and youngest surviving child of Eug&egrave;ne Goossens (1867&#150;1958), violinist and conductor, and his wife, Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cook (1860&#150;1946), opera singer. Her father was conductor of the Carl Rosa Opera Company, as had been his father, also Eug&egrave;ne; her mother was the daughter of Aynsley Cook, operatic bass singer. She was known throughout her life as Sid. There were other Sidonies in the family: her grandmother was a dancer whose stage name was Madame Sidonie, and her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33458/', "Sir Eug&#232;ne Aynsley Goossens (1893&#150;1962)")</script> in 1932 became the father of Sidonie, also a harpist, usually known (to avoid confusion) as Donie. Her other surviving siblings were a sister, Marie Henriette (1894&#150;1991), and two brothers, Adolphe (1896&#150;1916) and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39907/', "L&#233;on Jean Goossens (1897&#150;1988)")</script>. An elder sister (a twin to Eug&egrave;ne, also called Sidonie) had died in infancy. The children were all intended to enter the music profession. Apart from Adolphe, a most promising horn-player who was killed in the battle of the Somme, they all went on to achieve distinction in that profession.<br>
<br>Sidonie Goossens's first harp teachers (and Marie's, for they were to run largely parallel lives) were a Mr Evans of the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and Edith Mason, sister of Gwendolen Mason. All the children studied at the Royal College of Music, Sidonie for one year only, 1915&#150;16, where Miriam Timothy, harpist of the London Symphony Orchestra from its inception, taught both sisters. At that time the college did not award degrees. A very glamorous figure, Sidonie Goossens had a strong leaning towards the stage, but was dissuaded by her father from pursuing an uncertain and probably briefer career than that which he had intended for her. However, she later made appearances as a member of the BBC Amateur Dramatic Society, where she was acclaimed as a singer and dancer.<br>
<br>Goossens's professional career began in London theatres, notably in <span class="italic">Chu Chin Chow</span> (from 1918), and James Elroy Flecker's <span class="italic">Hassan</span> (1923), with music by Frederick Delius, conducted by her brother Eug&egrave;ne, with her oboist brother L&eacute;on also in the orchestra. She played alongside her sister in some performances of Diaghilev's Ballets Russes and made her symphonic d&eacute;but in 1921, playing second to Marie, at a Promenade Concert under Sir Henry Wood.<br>
<br>The new medium of radio beckoned, and Goossens joined the British Broadcasting Company in 1923, playing a wide range of music with the Wireless Orchestra and the Wireless Quartette for station 2LO. She was increasingly in demand elsewhere, with Sir Thomas Beecham and the London Symphony Orchestra, and in Wagner's <span class="roman">Ring</span> cycle at Covent Garden under Bruno Walter. From 1924 she made gramophone recordings both under her own name and, for contractual reasons, as Gwynneth Evans, appropriately in arrangements of Welsh traditional airs. Later she took part in television experiments with John Logie Baird, and was the first solo harpist to appear on television, in 1936. Much later she wrote about her career in early broadcasting in an article published in the United Kingdom Harp Association magazine in 1981. On 26 April 1924 she married Hyam (Bumps) Greenbaum (1901&#150;1942), a highly regarded musician who became the first director of music for BBC television; he was the son of Solomon Greenbaum, tailor. Their only child died at birth.<br>
<br>In 1930 the BBC established its symphony orchestra, and Goossens was appointed to the position of harpist, which she was to hold until her belated retirement in 1981: a record of longevity rarely equalled by any other orchestral harpist. From its earliest times the orchestra was committed to espousing the cause of new music, as well as maintaining the classic repertoire. This suited Goossens, who worked with leading modernists from Schoenberg to Boulez, and she enjoyed a reputation as one who was able to surmount all technical challenges. During later years she was much in demand for advanced and experimental work with ensembles such as the London Sinfonietta and the Fires of London. She was in the orchestra at Westminster Abbey for the coronations of both George VI and Elizabeth II, and played many concerti for the BBC, including William Alwyn's <span class="italic">Lyra Angelica</span>, written for her in 1954, and in 1958 with Marie and L&eacute;on under her brother's direction, Eug&egrave;ne Goossens's <span class="italic">Concert Piece</span> for solo oboe, two harps, and orchestra. It was perhaps the last time their father was to hear them all together.<br>
<br>Goossens's life was not without its darker moments. On holiday in Spain in 1936, when that country's civil war broke out, she was rescued and brought home by HMS <i>Gallant</i>. War was soon closer to home, and for safety in 1939 the BBC moved its symphony orchestra to Bristol. There many of her possessions (but not her harp) were destroyed by bombing, while she was sheltering elsewhere. On 13 May 1942 she was widowed, but on 19 December 1945 she married Major Norman Kinnaird Millar (1906&#150;1991) of the Black Watch, who had been wounded at El Alamein. The son of James Myles Millar, joiner, he had been an insurance official before the war, and after the war was involved in arts management, working for Sir Thomas Beecham and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, and later at the Old Vic Theatre. From 1949 they lived in a sixteenth-century farmhouse near Reigate, with two pigs (a gift from Beecham) and poultry. For many years Sidonie would rise daily at 5.30 to collect the eggs, which she would then take to her customers in the orchestra, before long days of rehearsing and performing.<br>
<br>From 1960 until 1990 Goossens was professor of harp at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, producing some outstanding pupils. In 1971 she was made a fellow of the Guildhall School, and she was the recipient of a number of further honours, including the MBE (1974) and OBE (1980). In 1981 she received a specially commissioned Salvador Dali statuette from Krug Champagne as an award of excellence. She was president for life of the United Kingdom Harp Association (from 1988) and received the Cobbett medal from the Worshipful Company of Musicians (1990). Her final playing engagement was at the last night of the Proms at the Royal Albert Hall in 1991, when Dame Gwyneth Jones sang &#145;The Last Rose of Summer&#146; accompanied by Goossens playing her own arrangement. Her 100th birthday was marked by two concerts, which she attended. One, in the Wigmore Hall, reflected every stage of her life and career, while from the royal box at the Royal Festival Hall she listened to a concert dedicated to her by her old orchestra, in a specially chosen programme of music by Schoenberg, Berg, and Webern.<br>
<br>Goossens remained true to the Roman Catholic church of her Belgian forefathers, and despite a series of illnesses retained her incisive mind and amazing recall until the last few weeks of her life. She died on 15 December 2004 at her home, Woodstock Farm, Gadbrook Road, Betchworth, Surrey. After a requiem mass at St Joseph's Church, Dorking, on 30 December, her remains were cremated and the ashes scattered in Betchworth, where she had lived for the previous fifty-five years. The feelings which her friends and colleagues had for her were summed up by Pierre Boulez, writing in the 100th anniversary concert programme:<blockquote>She loved her m&eacute;tier, her instrument, devoted her whole existence to it; this could be felt every time she played &hellip; All this, really, was the reflection of her personality for which I have had from the first instant not only the greatest admiration, but also an immense affection.</blockquote>
