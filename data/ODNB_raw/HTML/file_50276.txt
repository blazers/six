<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Parkes,  Edmund Samuel</span>  (1834&#150;1887), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born on 11 July 1834 in Devonport, Devon, the youngest son of Edward Parkes, and his wife, Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Robert and Elizabeth Tozer. On the death of his mother in 1836 Parkes was adopted by Captain James Considine, 22nd light dragoons and lieutenant-governor of Pendennis Castle, Falmouth, Cornwall, where Parkes spent his boyhood. He was educated at Hyde Side House, a boarding-school at Edmonton, Middlesex, where he was a prizewinner in 1847. He began work with a hop merchant, and then with a firm of London shipbrokers.<br>
<br>On 16 December 1852 Parkes was appointed as a teller with the important London and Westminster Bank, becoming assistant chief clerk in 1859. He resigned in 1862 to join the newly formed Alliance Bank of London and Liverpool Limited as manager at Southwark, subsequently becoming joint manager of that bank's head office. In 1867 the Alliance Bank, which rapidly emerged as one of England's largest joint-stock banks, was in difficulties, and in July the chairman reported to shareholders that Parkes had resigned to save the cost of his salary. While in London Parkes met and married Nancy Penrose Lawry (1831&#150;1886), twin daughter of John Lawry, farmer, of Cornwall, and Mary Penrose. Parkes was recruited to the Bank of Australasia in 1867, and he, Nancy, six children, mother-in-law, and two sisters-in-law arrived in Melbourne on board the <i>Damascus</i> on 17 November 1867. A further four children were born in Australia.<br>
<br>The appointment of Parkes was not popular with the colonial staff of the bank, who resented the entry of an outsider. As chief inspector, the bank's second most senior official, Parkes was brought into the bank to strengthen the colonial administration, and was seen as the man to introduce &#145;best practice&#146; technique and procedure learned in British branch banking. Appointed initially for five years, his contract was renewed until, in 1876, he was appointed superintendent of the bank in Australasia. Following years of indecisive management by his predecessor, Parkes was seen as a &#145;severe martinet dealing with the whole service as a chess player does with his pieces&#146;  (Turner, 191). A strict disciplinarian with high standards, he was intelligent and capable, with great force of character. He was well educated and widely read, with a large private library, and his extensive knowledge of banking law and practice was applied unstintingly both in the bank and as an adviser on banking generally. He emerged as a major figure in Australian banking, playing a key role in the Associated Banks (Victoria). Yet he never formally held the chair of that organization, becoming acting chairman only, for five months in 1884&#150;5.<br>
<br>Parkes's time as head of his bank coincided with the development of a boom in the Australian economy. His concern over the dangers implicit in the boom did not, however, inhibit cautious expansion; seventy-nine new branches were opened, deposits and advances more than doubled, and his bank's deposit position improved relative to other Australian banks, raising it, by the time of his death, to the second largest in Australia and one of the largest British-controlled overseas banks. A constant search for efficiency led him to introduce electricity to the bank's Melbourne head office. He also installed typewriters and appointed Australia's first woman bank employee.<br>
<br>In private life Parkes was genial and hospitable and a keen and skilful tennis player, who enjoyed riding a tricycle in the morning between six and seven when nobody was about. Outside the bank he was a member of the influential Melbourne Club and a staunch member and vestry man of Holy Trinity Church of England, Balaclava, Victoria. He was also a member of the council of the Melbourne Church of England grammar school, where four of his sons were educated.<br>
<br>In 1881 Parkes and his Melbourne manager were involved in a railway accident in which they came close to death. The death of his wife in 1886 was a severe blow, and he often expressed a wish to follow her to the afterlife. Ironically, his own death came less than a year later, when he was critically injured in a second railway accident. He died at his home, Irona, Carlisle Street, Balaclava, Victoria, on 11 May 1887, from complications following surgery to amputate his legs, and was buried on the 13th in the St Kilda cemetery, Victoria.<br>
