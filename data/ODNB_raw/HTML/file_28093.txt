<span class="headword">Laun,  Henri  van</span>  (1820&#150;1896), <span class="occ">author and French scholar</span>, was born in the Netherlands. He was educated in France, and settled permanently in England in 1848. At first he sought to make his fortune as a journalist, but soon came to prefer the less precarious business of teaching. He was successively French master at King William's College, Isle of Man, at Cheltenham College, and at the Edinburgh Academy, where he became friends with Professor Blackie, Lord Neaves, Sir Alexander Grant, and many other noted intellectuals. Settling afterwards in London, he acted for twenty consecutive years as French examiner for the civil service commission and for the War Office. He was also at this time involved in literary and artistic circles in London, and his first publication, <span class="italic">A Grammar of the French Language</span>, in three volumes (1863&#150;4), was followed by <span class="italic">The Adventures of Gil Blas</span> (1866), a translation of Alain-Ren&eacute; Lesage's <span class="italic">Histoire de Gil Blas de Santillane</span>, and <span class="italic">Selections from Modern French Authors</span> (1869&#150;88). In 1871 a <span class="italic">History of English Literature</span>, a translation of the work by his friend Hippolyte-Adolphe Taine, was first published in Edinburgh in two volumes. It ran through four or five editions, and was then published in four volumes in London in 1886. The <span class="italic">Dramatic Works of Moli&egrave;re</span>, translated by van Laun in six volumes, was published in Edinburgh in 1875&#150;6, with illustrations by Lalauze. It included much out-of-the-way information, derived from Langbaine and other sources, concerning seventeenth- and eighteenth-century translations and plagiarisms, both acknowledged and unacknowledged, of separate plays.<br>
<br>In 1876&#150;7 van Laun produced his own <span class="italic">History of French Literature</span>. The first volume covered the period &#145;from its origin to the Renaissance&#146;; the second covered the period to &#145;the end of the Reign of Louis Phillipe [<i>sic</i>]&#146;. It was reprinted in 1883. He next published his <span class="italic">French Revolutionary Epoch</span> (1878), a history of France in two volumes from the beginning of the first revolution to the end of the Second Empire. This was followed in 1885 by <span class="italic">The Characters of J. de La Bruy&egrave;re, Newly Rendered into English</span>.<br>
<br>Van Laun was for some years confidential adviser to John C. Nimmo, a London publisher. He also occasionally wrote critical pieces for the press, and contributed to such journals as <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span>. He was widely read in English dramatic literature, and possessed a great knowledge of French and English idioms as well as a large amount of scholarly erudition. He was described in his obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span> as a &#145;bibliophile of exacting taste, [whose] acquaintance with <i>&eacute;ditions de luxe</i> and book illustrations could scarcely be rivalled&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 22 Jan 1896, 10). He died of cirrhosis of the liver at 174 Lancaster Road, London, on 19 January 1896, and was buried in Brookwood cemetery, Woking, on the 23rd.<br>
