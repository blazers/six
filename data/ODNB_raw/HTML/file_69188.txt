<span class="headword">Bucker,  George</span> <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>Adam Damplip]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1543), <span class="occ">religious radical</span>, is first recorded in 1536 when he was in Padua with Reginald Pole and Alvise Priuli. He then tried to attach himself to Cosmo Gheri, bishop of Fano. He claimed to have been John Fisher's mass priest, and told Priuli many of Fisher's sayings. Bucker had begun by expressing &#145;certain depraved and heretical opinions especially against the unity of the church and the authority of the Roman pontiff&#146; as well as condemning the reason Fisher had died, but when he saw that Pole and Priuli disapproved, he changed his opinion and gave them a &#145;discourse on both sides [<i>in utramque partem</i>] on papal authority&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., Bodl. MS Ital. C. 25, fol. 147<i>r</i>) that Pole thought he must have heard from Fisher. Gheri regarded Bucker's arrival in Fano as providential, since Pole had just asked Gheri to write Fisher's life. Bucker set down Fisher's opinions <span class="italic">De oratione</span> (&#145;On prayer&#146;), <span class="italic">De predestinatione et libero arbitrio</span> (&#145;On predestination and free will&#146;), and <span class="italic">De potestate pontificis</span> (&#145;On papal power&#146;), the last only in a copy which Bucker had hidden in his house in England. Only the first of these is known, but many of Fisher's works were destroyed by his enemies. Along with discussions of the late bishop, Bucker spoke on the Pauline epistles. He told Gheri that after Fisher's imprisonment he adhered to Henry VIII but repented after the bishop's death, inspired by a vision of Fisher asking him about his desertion. He undertook a pilgrimage to Rome, where he attached himself to an Englishman, one of whose servants he killed. Gheri offered to secure absolution for him, and Bucker tried to enlist Ludevico Beccadelli's assistance.<br>
<br>Bucker next appeared in Calais about the end of April 1538, looking for passage to England and calling himself Adam Damplip or perhaps just Adams. He was persuaded to stay and preach. Damplip alleged that he could have had a good living from Pole had he stayed in Rome&#151;Pole wished him to read there three times a week and sent money after him to get him back. This gift would become the fatal French crown that according to John Foxe led to Damplip's execution for treason. Foxe is one of the most important sources for the rest of Damplip's story, but his tale changed between the first edition of 1563 and that of 1570. Despite the alterations, Foxe's main story agrees well enough with Ellis Gruffudd's contemporary chronicle and other sources to make it possible to reconstruct Damplip's actions in Calais with fair confidence.<br>
<br>Lord Lisle, the deputy of Calais, gave Damplip money and strong support, subsequently denying only that he had known that Damplip came from Pole. Lisle pronounced Damplip's sermon on the epistle to the <span class="roman">Romans</span> the best he had heard, and he recommended Damplip to Archbishop Thomas Cranmer. The Carmelite prior John Dove by contrast attacked Damplip for saying that each Christian should understand the significance of the mass. On Whitsunday (9 June), Damplip preached at the destroyed site called Resurrection where a supposedly miraculous host had been exposed by royal commissioners. The council of Calais warned Cranmer's commissary John Butler on 19 June 1538 that Damplip should preach nothing on Corpus Christi (20 June) contrary to royal ordinances, and shortly thereafter he was summoned to England. He allegedly responded that he had a licence (from Butler) &#145;to tarry there as long as he would and to depart when he would&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lisle Letters</span>, 5.186). A month later Thomas Cromwell ordered an investigation.<br>
<br>No sooner had Damplip sent in a written opinion than he was taken to England by a member of Lisle's household, with a letter of recommendation from Butler to Cranmer. As soon as he arrived, Cranmer sent him first to Cromwell with a letter asking that he be allowed to return to Calais, and then to a committee of bishops. Warned by Cranmer that he was in danger of imprisonment, Damplip submitted a written statement of his opinions and escaped (according to Foxe), but nothing more happened until 1539. In the interval, Damplip may have taken service with Nicholas Shaxton, bishop of Salisbury, while Foxe asserts that he kept a school in the west country for one or two years. Then on 27 May 1539 Cromwell told the council of Calais that the allegations against Damplip did not amount to much. The council rejoined to Cranmer that Damplip &#145;preached here directly against the sacraments of the altar and baptism&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lisle Letters</span>, 5.516), and a few days later Cromwell himself wrote that, if true, the articles against Damplip were &#145;very pestilent&#146; and &#145;most detestable and cankered heresy&#146;  (ibid., 5.523). On 27 June Lisle and the council informed bishops Clerk, Sampson, and Rugg that Damplip had caused recent disturbances in Calais. They were especially concerned to discover whether anyone had heard him preach that &#145;the very body of God was not really and substantially contained in the sacrament &hellip; And the priest with his mumming cannot make a god&#146;  (ibid., 5.567).<br>
<br>Almost another year passed, and then a royal commission was dispatched to Calais. It took sixty depositions and reported on 5 April 1540 that Damplip had engendered division. Lisle asked William, Lord Sandys, who was hearing depositions along with Sampson, to have Dove brought over to London to testify, and Sandys agreed. On 22 July Damplip was attainted of treason for his contacts with Pole. Most of the d&eacute;nouement comes from the 1570 edition of Foxe, drawing on the letters of John Marbeck who had been imprisoned in the Marshalsea with Damplip for about a month (Foxe says a year). Foxe's chronology is out by a year overall and by about a week in its essential details, but much of his narrative seems plausible. After Damplip had been in prison for about two years, at Easter (25 March) 1543 he decided Stephen Gardiner had forgotten him and wrote offering his submission. Gardiner replied by having him sent back to Calais. When the news arrived, Damplip discerned that it meant his death. Nevertheless he ate a hearty dinner, asking the keeper &#145;Do you think I have been God's prisoner so long in the Marshalsea and have not yet learned to die?&#146;  (Foxe, <span class="italic">Actes and Monuments</span>, 1583 edn, 1229). On 2 May he was taken to Calais, following orders from the privy council on 22 and 29 April about the manner of his execution. On 5 May he was hanged, drawn, and quartered. The parson of Notre Dame preached as directed, and Sir Ralph Ellerker prevented Damplip from speaking in his own defence.<br>
<br>Volatile in his opinions in a way far from untypical of this period, Damplip illustrates the pervasiveness of Pauline Christianity in the early Reformation, as well as the degree to which it turned on questions of ecclesiology. His arguments in his interrogation of 1538 also had a significant impact on Cranmer's eucharistic theology.<br>
