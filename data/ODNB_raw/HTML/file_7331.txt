<span class="headword">Dawes,  Lancelot</span>  (1579/80&#150;1655), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Barton Kirk, Westmorland. He attended Queen's College, Oxford, first as a poor serving child, then as a taberdar; he matriculated on 14 October 1597, aged seventeen. Despite parental penury, Wood tells us, through &#145;studious retiredness and a severe discipline&#146; he became an &#145;ornament&#146; of the college  (Wood, 3.349&#150;50). He graduated BA on 30 June 1602 and MA on 6 June 1605; he became a fellow of Queen's in 1605.<br>
<br>In 1608, on the death of John Hudson, Dawes was nominated by John Fetherston to the vicarage of Barton Kirk, and though a second candidate for the living, George Hudson, was presented, it was Dawes who was instituted. He also bought land in the nearby parish of Crosby Ravensworth, including Regill Grange and half the demesne in the manor of Regill. On 25 June 1609 he preached a sermon at Paul's Cross in London. His discourse later appeared as <span class="italic">Gods Mercies and Jerusalems Miseries</span> (1609) with an epistle, dated 27 June, dedicated to Henry Robinson, bishop of Carlisle. Following his collation to the rectory of Great Asby, Westmorland, in 1617 a complaint led to his being charged with simony and this may have been connected in some way with the contest for the vicarage of Barton. The charge being rejected, he was instituted on 3 July 1619 to the third prebendial stall of Carlisle Cathedral, an appointment widely approved among the clergy of the diocese. At about this time, Wood reports, he was awarded the degree of doctor of divinity at St Andrews University.<br>
<br>Nothing is known of Dawes's life in the 1620s and 1630s. He represented Carlisle at the convocation of April&#150;May 1640 as procurator of the clergy and for the chapter. On 21 April 1642 he was approved by the House of Commons as a representative in the Westminster assembly. His <span class="italic">Sermons Preached upon Severall Occasions</span> was published in 1653. When, on 23 February 1647, the committee for plundered ministers offered him a choice between the two livings then in his possession he opted to keep the vicarage of Barton. Here, it is thought, he remained until about 1655, when he died, having served there for more than forty-five years.<br>
<br>Walker conceded that Dawes was &#145;a person of a comprehensive and orthodox judgement, adorned with all variety of learning&#146;, recording sadly that he &#145;submitted to the men of the times; and by that means continued in the possessions of his livings until the time of his death&#146;  (Walker, <span class="italic">Sufferings</span>, 2.10). The date of his death has been the subject of some confusion, understandably since his son of the same name also died about this time and is also known to have had a brother, William, who survived him. A William, brother of Lancelot Dawes, was granted the administration of the latter's estate in March 1654. The deceased was not therefore the vicar of Barton, as Wood assumed, but his son. The father, however, did not live long after, and Le Neve's date of 18 May 1655 is likely to be right either for his death, or burial at Barton Kirk; his will, drawn up in 1650, and unquestionably that of Lancelot senior, was proved on 14 July 1655.<br>
