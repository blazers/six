<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Obolensky, Alexander <span class="st"> [Aleksandr]</span></span>  (1916&#150;1940), <span class="occ">rugby player</span>, was born in Petrograd on 17 February 1916, the first son of Prince Sergey Obolensky, captain in the imperial horse guards, and his wife, Lubov Aleksandrovna Naryshkina. His family escaped from Russia in 1919, travelling from Riga on the <i>Princess Margaret</i>. He was educated at Trent College and in 1934 entered Brasenose College, Oxford, where he took a fourth in philosophy, politics, and economics in 1938.<br>
<br>Obolensky's talent for rugby was first recognized at Trent College, where he scored forty-nine tries in one season. At Oxford he won blues in 1935 and 1937, but missed the 1936 game against Cambridge University owing to injury. He won four England caps in 1936 and played club rugby for Rosslyn Park from 1936.<br>
<br>Obolensky's fame, far greater and more enduring than that of many players with much longer international careers, rests firmly on a single match. His international d&eacute;but, against New Zealand at Twickenham on 2 January 1936, is remembered as &#145;Obolensky's match&#146;  (Morgan and Nicholson, 217) for his two tries in a 13&#150;0 victory: England's first ever win over New Zealand and its last until 1973. His second try, when he ran at an angle from his position on the right wing to score near the opposite corner, was called by his team-mate Peter Cranmer &#145;the most talked-about of my generation&#146;  (Cranmer, 10). Obolensky was still to be naturalized as a British citizen, a process completed a few weeks later. This led to an icy pre-match conversation with the prince of Wales (later Edward VIII), who asked him what qualified him to play for England. Obolensky replied: &#145;I am a student at Oxford University &hellip; <i>sir</i>&#146;  (ibid.). After taking British nationality he requested no longer to be known as &#145;prince&#146;.<br>
<br>The rest of Obolensky's international career was, by comparison, an anticlimax. He received hardly a pass in three more matches in 1936 and, in spite of scoring seventeen tries&#151;believed to be a record for senior rugby&#151;against Brazil at Niter&oacute;i on a tour of South America in August 1936, was not selected in subsequent seasons. He remained a favourite with crowds at Rosslyn Park, who encouraged team-mates to &#145;give it to Obo&#146;  (Alston).<br>
<br>The enduring image of Obolensky as &#145;a romantic figure capable of doing almost incredible things&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 1 April 1940) rests in part on his exotic background, but also on the pace and unorthodoxy demonstrated by his famous try at Twickenham. E. H. D. Sewell wrote that &#145;for a right wing to touch down several yards wide of the left-hand post was just one of those things that were not done&#146;  (Sewell, 232). Wilfred Wooller, who played against him for Cambridge, described Obolensky as &#145;a strongly built wing, with a low centre of gravity, [who] could move with breath-taking speed down the touchline&#146;  (Arlott, Wooller, and Edelston, 131). He was exceptionally fast&#151;timed at 10.6 sec. for the 100 yards&#151;and a pioneer in the use of lightweight boots. While not renowned as a defender, he saved a draw for Oxford in the 1935 varsity match with a tackle on the opposite wing. The Welsh international Vivian Jenkins called him &#145;a real White Russian Parisian type who loved to celebrate&#151;truly one of the lads&#146;  (Frost, 79). He was reported to prepare for matches by consuming a dozen oysters. A more serious side was reflected in his contribution to the book <span class="italic">Be Still and Know: Oxford in Search of God</span> (ed. K. Briant and G. Joseph, 1936) and his disagreement with the Oxford Union's vote not to &#145;Fight for King and Country&#146;.<br>
<br>Commissioned in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve in May 1938, Obolensky was called up on the outbreak of war in 1939. He died when his plane crashed at Martlesham, Suffolk, on 29 March 1940. The first England rugby international to die in the Second World War, he was buried in Ipswich cemetery on 2 April 1940. He was unmarried.<br>
