<span class="headword">Boevey <span class="st"> [Bovey; <em>n&eacute;e </em>Riches]</span>,  Catherina <span class="st"> [Catharina]</span></span>  (<em>bap. </em>1670, <em>d.</em> 1726), <span class="occ">benefactor</span>, was baptized on 1 May 1670 in the parish of St Laurence Pountney, London, the first child of John Riches (1628&#150;1718), a merchant and landowner, and his wife, Anne, daughter of Thomas Davall (1619&#150;1663), a merchant, and Anne Potts (1620&#150;1700), daughter of Thomas Potts, gentleman. Catherina's father was a naturalized Dutchman, originally from Amsterdam. The most notable member of her mother's family was Catherina's uncle, the MP Sir Thomas Davall. Catherina had one sister, Anne 
    (Hannah; 1671&#150;1689)
  , and one brother, John Riches (<i>d</i>. 1676).<br>
<br>As a child, Catherina Riches lived in St Laurence Pountney, the London parish in which her father was active and to which she was assigned the grant and demise of the rectory, tithes, advowson, and hereditaments in 1704  (Crawley-Boevey, 70). In 1685, aged only fifteen (though officially claiming to be &#145;about eighteen&#146;), she married William Boevey (1657&#150;1692), merchant, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70859/', "James Boevey (1622&#150;1696)")</script>, an Anglo-Dutch merchant and lawyer, and his wife, Izabella de Visscher. Thereafter Catherina lived out her life on William's estate at Flaxley Abbey, Gloucestershire, while also keeping a town house in Duke Street, Westminster.<br>
<br>Little is known of Boevey's brief married life. The couple had at least two servants, Rachel Vergo and Matthew Stephens. A female friend of Richard Steele claimed that Catherina suffered her husband's &#145;excesses both in debauch and ill-humour like a martyr, cheerful under her very feelings&#146;  (Manley, 3.209). In 1692, when Catherina was twenty-two, William died of dropsy. In the inscription on his tomb in Flaxley church, Catherina described him as &#145;a man most distinguished for faithfulness and good repute; not sparing of aught that was his own; not covetous of aught that was another's; known to no one by wrong done, known to countless persons by kindness wrought&#146;. They had no children.<br>
<br>The sole heir to her father's considerable wealth, and left &pound;1000 in trust by her stepgrandfather, the military engineer Sir Bernard de Gomme, in 1685, Boevey inherited on her husband's death the Flaxley estate, despite the fact that her father-in-law, James Boevey, contested the will. When her own father died in 1718 Catherina also inherited his &#145;real and personal estate in the counties of Kent, Surrey, London, and Middlesex&#146;.<br>
<br>Although well acquainted with one of her neighbours, John Kyrle (Pope's &#145;Man of Ross&#146;), and often courted, Catherina never remarried. Instead she devoted her life to charitable work and so &#145;in every minute particular fulfilled the character of a woman of nice honour and strict virtue&#146;  (Manley). She was the centre of a circle of female philanthropic friends, such as Mrs Cowling, Margaret Barrow, Grace Butler, and in particular Mary Pope of Twickenham, with whom Boevey had agreed to be buried in the same vault after their deaths. Other members of her circle included Dorothy Bayley (<i>d</i>. 1727), of Fretherne, Gloucestershire, and Susanna Lloyd, wife of John (friends of Catherina's distant relation Bishop Thomas Ken), who was godmother to Marie Renouard, wife of Colonel St Pierre of the Royal dragoon guards.<br>
<br>Boevey's charity extended from lending money to those in distress to inviting six poor children to her house every Sunday for dinner and religious instruction. By 1695 her philanthropic activities had involved her with the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK) founded by Thomas Bray. Like Bishop Ken, she founded and maintained one of the earliest catechetical schools in the parish of Flaxley. With Bishop Robert Frampton she helped the mission of the Revd John Talbot and the Revd George Keith in New England, including the endowment of St Mary's Church at Burlington, New Jersey. The silver chalice Boevey presented to the church in 1708 was still in use in 1876. In addition she contributed a subscription of &pound;500 to a college established to train missionaries in the Bermudas, following Dean Berkeley's <span class="italic">Proposal for the better supplying of churches in our foreign plantations, and for converting the savages to Christianity</span> (1724). This sum was originally donated by &#145;a Lady who desires to be unknown&#146;  (Anderson, 3.476), and the identity of the benefactor was only disclosed by Mary Pope after Boevey's death. Her religious sympathies lay with the nonjuring bishops of the Church of England, like Thomas Ken. Two who accepted her offer of shelter at Flaxley Abbey were Frampton and George Hickes, the titular bishop of Thetford, whose <span class="italic">Linguarum septentrionalium thesaurus</span> (1705) was written with Boevey's financial support. Other beneficiaries included the Three Choirs Festival, of which she was a founder, held at Hereford, Worcester, and Gloucester from 1715.<br>
<br>Boevey's philanthropy and widowhood went hand in hand with a love of fashionable clothes. Her female servant, who was also her milliner and mantua maker, claimed that &#145;Mrs Boevey frequently called for her charity account book to see if it kept pace with her expenses in dress, which was always very handsome&#146;  (Crawley-Boevey, 113&#150;14). Certainly she was well known for her fine appearance and beauty. Hickes, for example, described her as the &#145;Christian Hypatia of our England&#146;  (Hickes, 1.xlvii). To Delarivier Manley she was Portia in the third volume of her <span class="italic">The New Atalantis: Memoirs of Europe towards the Close of the Eighth Century</span>. Manley saw her as:<blockquote>one of those lofty black and lasting beauties that strikes with reverence, and yet delight. There is no feature in her face, nor anything in her person, her air and manner, that could be exchanged for any others, and she not prove a loser. Then as to her mind and conduct, her judgment, her sense, her stedfastness, her reading, her wit, and conversation, they are admirable, so much above what is lovely in the sex; shut but your eyes, and allow for the music of her voice, your mind would be charmed as thinking yourself conversing with the most knowing, the most refined of ours. Free from all levity and superficialness her sense is solid and perspicuous. She is so neat, so perfect an economist, that in taking all the greater beauties of life she does not disdain to stoop to the most inferior. In short, she knows all that a man can know without despising what as a woman she should not be ignorant of. (quoted in Crawley-Boevey, 86)</blockquote>Richard Steele likewise praised her:<blockquote>aspect and mien which draw the attention and expectation of all who converse with you, and a wit and good sense which surmount the great conceptions your person raises in your beholders, [yet] those perfections are enjoyed by you like gifts of common acceptation; that lovely and affable air expresses only the humility of a great and generous heart; and the most shining accomplishments, used by others to attract vulgar admiration, are serviceable to you only as they adorn piety and charity. (<span class="italic">Lady's Library</span>, vol. 2, 21 July 1714, dedication)</blockquote>Three years earlier Boevey's combination of virtue, piety, and beauty had placed her at the centre of a series of articles about Platonic love which appeared in Steele's and Addison's <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> (nos. 113, 115, 118, 517). According to Arthur W. Crawley-Boevey, Catherina was the inspiration for the character of the &#145;perverse widow&#146;&#151;beautiful, confident, but inaccessible&#151;sought by the lovelorn Sir Roger de Coverley.<br>
<br>In the words of Mary Pope's half-sister, Margaret Barrow, Boevey was taken &#145;with a most violent colick&#146; on 18 January 1726  (Fosbrooke, 2.179). She died between 11 a.m. and noon on 21 January 1726 from, according to her servant Rachel Vergo, a bowel complaint  (Crawley-Boevey, 115). She was buried on 23 January at Flaxley church alongside her friend Mrs Cowling (<i>d</i>. 1719), and later her friends Grace Butler (<i>d</i>. 1763) and Mary Pope (<i>d</i>. 1747). A few years after Catherina's death Mary Pope had a monument, designed by James Gibbs, erected to her in Westminster Abbey; this formed the backdrop to Sir Elton John's rendition of &#145;Goodbye England's Rose&#146; at the funeral of Diana, princess of Wales, in September 1997.<br>
