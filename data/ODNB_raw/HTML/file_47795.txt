<span class="headword">Simcoe <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Gwillim]</span>,  Elizabeth Postuma</span>  (1762&#150;1850), <span class="occ">diarist and artist</span>, was born in September 1762 and baptized on 22 September at Aldwincle, Northamptonshire, the only child of Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Gwillim (<i>bap</i>. 1726, <i>d</i>. 1762?) and Elizabeth Spinckes (<i>bap</i>. 1723, <i>d</i>. 1762). Her father died before her birth and her mother in childbirth. The orphaned heir to land in Northamptonshire and Herefordshire was given the name of Postuma in recognition of her situation. She was not, however, alone in the world. Her childhood was spent with loving grandparents and aunts on both sides of the family, principally her mother's younger sister, Margaret, who, when she married Admiral Samuel Graves in 1769, took Elizabeth to live with her in Honiton, Devon. The admiral seems to have been responsible for her unusually broad education. It was at his home that she met his godson, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25554/', "Lieutenant-Colonel John Graves Simcoe (1752&#150;1806)")</script>, whom she married on 30 December 1782. The couple had eleven children. Although the match between her property and his impecunious ability was logical, it seems also to have been a marriage of genuine affection.<br>
<br>The Simcoes built Wolford Lodge on the Devon estate that Elizabeth inherited, and set about improving and extending the estate, all the while seeking a military or colonial appointment for Simcoe, who had field rank but no regiment. Finally, in 1791 he was appointed lieutenant-governor of the new colony of Upper Canada. With the two youngest of their six children, the Simcoes sailed from Weymouth in September 1791.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Simcoe's renown in Canada is based on the diaries she began keeping on that trip. Until she returned to England five years later she kept daily notes, which were later expanded into longer diary entries and incorporated into letters to family and friends. Until early in the twentieth century the diaries remained unpublished and Canadian interest was centred on her husband as the first governor. Her diaries are attractive because of their infectious enthusiasm. Where other women in the colony complained of hardship, Elizabeth saw only adventure. Despite her involvement in her husband's activities she rarely mentioned politics. The people who appear in her diaries tended to be social contacts of her own class: the governor's military colleagues, visiting dignitaries, and women who maintained rounds of visits as if still in England. Her enjoyment of her role as the governor's wife no doubt added to her delight in all that she saw and did. In addition to the diaries Elizabeth, a talented artist, made many sketches, later turned into watercolours, which are frequently reproduced today as the most accurate records of a time and place. On their return to England, a set of thirty-two watercolours was presented to George III. She was particularly attracted to &#145;sublime&#146; scenery, but she also made detailed drawings of flora and fauna, of aboriginal peoples, and of local curiosities. A number of maps from this period are also attributed to her drawing ability. The exception to the happy accounts of her life in Canada was the death of a daughter, born at Niagara, who lived only a year. Although she had now borne seven children, this was the first infant death.<br>
<br>Governor Simcoe, who had been seriously wounded during the American War of Independence, found that the climate of Upper Canada adversely affected his health and requested leave to return to England. According to her diary (21 July 1796), Elizabeth Simcoe &#145;cried all the day&#146; when they left Upper Canada.<br>
<br>As soon as her husband's health was restored, Elizabeth was involved in the process of finding him another appointment. In 1798 he was gazetted lieutenant-general, and given command of the western district, which was vulnerable to the expected attack from France. A surviving diary records a journey of inspection on which she accompanied the general that year. In July 1806 Simcoe was appointed commander-in-chief in India, with a knighthood promised, but while Elizabeth was purchasing her wardrobe Simcoe was sent on a special mission to Portugal. He took ill aboard ship, returned to England, and died at Exeter a few days after his return. Elizabeth, who by now had nine living children, seven of whom were daughters, lost her natural ebullience. She had no financial problems, and she was an educated, intelligent woman with a large circle of friends and relatives, but her life had lost its focus.<br>
<br>Elizabeth's childhood friend, the naturalist Mary Ann Burges, had purchased a home near Wolford and was her principal emotional support in this period. Almost immediately her maternal duty required that she turn her attention to launching her eldest son, Francis, in a career. In the family tradition, he chose the military and, sponsored by Lord Moira, was commissioned in 1807. He was killed at Badajoz in 1812. The next year Mary Ann Burges died.<br>
<br>Elizabeth and her husband had always been devout members of the Church of England. Governor Simcoe had built a chapel at Wolford, and had been assiduous in seeing to the establishment of the Anglican church in Upper Canada. After the loss of husband, friend, and favourite child, Elizabeth turned increasingly to the evangelical wing of the Church of England, which she supported financially and with personal activity, since she considered it the best means of counteracting what she saw as the dangerously democratic tendencies of the period. Determined that her only surviving son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25553/', "Henry Addington Simcoe (1800&#150;1868)")</script>, would not enter the army, she destined him for the church and campaigned for his advancement.<br>
<br>As a widow, Elizabeth Simcoe did not withdraw from society. With her daughters, she wintered at Bath and Cheltenham, where they had many friends. When they were not receiving guests at Wolford, all the female family members seem to have gone on rounds of visits to titled friends. Although she never again travelled outside Britain, diaries survive for visits to Wales in 1814 and 1831. They reveal the same delight in awe-inspiring scenery, and the same determination to sketch what she saw, found in the Canadian diaries. In Wales she also looked for traces of her Gwillim ancestors.<br>
<br>A notable aspect of Elizabeth Simcoe's life, and that of her daughters, is the intensity of female friendships revealed in their journals and correspondence. The women in these networks lived in the country, were all highly intelligent, interested in science, art, and languages, and seem to have been in control of their lives.<br>
<br>Contact with Upper Canada was maintained. The Simcoe family owned property there, managed by an agent, until 1826. Sir Frances Head, a later lieutenant-governor, was a family connection, whose wife kept them abreast of political developments. Elizabeth Simcoe helped pay for the Cambridge education of the Revd Henry Scadding, the son of their agent, and also for at least one of the sons of John Strachan, first bishop of Upper Canada. After her mother's death the eldest daughter, Eliza, was still donating money for missionary activities in Upper Canada and writing to ecclesiastical authorities in England on behalf of the Canadian church.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Simcoe died at Wolford on 17 January 1850, aged eighty-seven, and was buried on 27 January at the chapel there beside the husband she had survived for forty-four years. She had complained of declining health for some time, but was still active well into her eighties. It was Eliza who preserved her mother's diaries, drawings, and correspondence. Had it not been for her, Elizabeth Simcoe would be known only as the shadowy wife of a colonial governor, and a beneficent member of the Devon gentry, instead of her present status as one of the most admired founders of modern Ontario.<br>
