<span class="headword">Henniker, Sir  Mark Chandos Auberon</span>, eighth baronet  (1906&#150;1991), <span class="occ">army officer and author</span>, was born at Northmoor, Minehead, Somerset, on 23 January 1906, the only son and older of the two children of Frederick Chandos Henniker (1866&#150;1953) of the Indian Civil Service, and his wife, Ada Russell (<i>d</i>. 1958), daughter of Arthur Pearce Howell, also of the Indian Civil Service. He was educated at Marlborough College, the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and King's College, Cambridge, and was commissioned into the Royal Engineers in 1926. He was in India from 1928 to 1934 and was awarded an MC in the campaign against the Mohmands in 1933 when serving with the Bengal Sappers and Miners, for his skill and courage while supervising the building of a road up the Karappa Pass from the Vale of Peshawar, a distance of some 20 miles in conditions of considerable danger. In 1939 he went to France as adjutant of 2nd divisional engineers. In the retreat to Dunkirk he was given command of a field company in 3rd division and defended a sector of the perimeter of the port. With the evacuation virtually completed he set off back to England with the remainder of his company in two rowing boats. On the way they encountered an abandoned, damaged naval pinnace which they boarded and from which they were picked up by a British gunboat, which landed them at Dover.<br>
<br>Back in Britain, Henniker was selected to command the sapper element in the 1st airborne division, which was in the process of formation. In this capacity he trained the sappers and took part in the Bruneval raid. Bruneval, near Le Havre, was known to be the site of a radar unit which was using new equipment and thus causing heavy losses among British bombers. A force of 120 from the parachute regiment of Royal Engineers parachuted in, escorting a radar expert who knew what to take out; the raid was successful, as were also the resultant counter-measures the RAF adopted. Henniker subsequently served in north Africa and then took part in the invasion of Sicily in July 1943. He crash-landed by glider near Syracuse, but was unhurt. Later he was wounded in seven places and also sustained a broken arm, but he managed to take part in the capture of the important bridges at Ponte Grande and Primasole, though swathed in bandages. He was with 1st airborne in their landing and occupation of Taranto, which he subsequently organized into a base for the future campaign in Italy. He was appointed OBE in 1944.<br>
<br>In 1944 Henniker was appointed commander, Royal Engineers, in 43rd (Welsh) division and distinguished himself in the aftermath of the Arnhem disaster of September 1944, when he rescued many of the survivors of 1st airborne division by ferrying them across the Rhine in assault boats, a process that the Germans were doing their best to prevent. He was immediately appointed DSO. Subsequently he fought through the remainder of the north-west Europe campaign, including the Rhine crossing, the Ardennes, and the capture of Bremen and Cuxhaven. At Nijmegen he drove over a bridge five minutes before it was blown up by German frogmen. On 5 September 1945, three days after the formal conclusion of hostilities in the Far East, Henniker married Kathleen Denys Anderson (<i>b</i>. 1909/10), second daughter of John Cousmaker Anderson, barrister, of Pilgrim's Way, Farnham, Surrey. They had two children, Adrian Chandos (<i>b</i>. 1946) and Fiona Jane (<i>b</i>. 1951).<br>
<br>In 1946 Henniker returned to India and in 1947 he was engaged in trying to preserve lives in the turbulence which followed partition. He was then posted to Malaya as commander of 63rd Gurkha infantry brigade, a period about which he subsequently wrote a book entitled <span class="italic">Red Shadow over Malaya</span> (1955), in which he described the brigade's successful operations against elusive communist terrorists. He was appointed CBE in 1955. In the same year he returned to Europe to be commander, Royal Engineers in 1st (British) corps, and was involved in the Suez operation, for which he was mentioned in dispatches. He retired from the army in 1958, and on 19 February became eighth baronet on the death of his cousin Sir Robert John Aldborough Henniker.<br>
<br>Honker was no ordinary soldier. A brisk, enquiring mind, and a tendency to reject the first or obvious solution to a problem, enabled him to tackle numerous problems successfully, often to the irritation of his contemporaries, who thought along more orthodox lines. With red hair and a piercing gaze he was not a person to suffer fools gladly, but he had a philosophic sense of humour. He published four volumes of autobiography. <span class="italic">Memoirs of a Junior Officer</span> (1951) was followed by <span class="italic">Red Shadow over Malaya</span> in 1955. <span class="italic">Life in the Army Today</span> came in 1957, and <span class="italic">An Image of War</span> in 1987. He also contributed regularly to <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span>.<br>
<br>After retiring from the army Henniker founded a private oil company, from which he retired in 1977. He was honorary colonel of the parachute engineer regiment (Territorial Army) from 1939 to 1968, and honorary colonel of the Corps of Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (Territorial Army) from 1964 to 1968. He was deputy lieutenant, Monmouthshire, in 1963. He died of a cerebrovascular haemorrhage at the Avenue Road Nursing Home, Avenue Road, Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, on 18 October 1991. He was survived by his wife and two children, and was succeeded as baronet by his son.<br>
