<span class="headword">Kinnaird,  Charles</span>, eighth Lord Kinnaird of Inchture  (1780&#150;1826), <span class="occ">politician and art collector</span>, was the eldest surviving son of George, seventh Lord Kinnaird of Inchture (<i>d</i>. 1805), and his wife, Elizabeth, only daughter of Griffin Ransom, banker, of Westminster, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Andrew Jelf, architect. He was born on 12 April 1780, and was copiously educated at Eton College and at the universities of Edinburgh (where he was president of the Speculative Society), Cambridge (Trinity College, 1798&#150;1800), and Glasgow. He was admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1799. He also studied at Geneva in 1800&#150;02. His father's connection with the whigs enabled him to obtain a seat in the House of Commons, as member for Leominster in 1802. From that time until the death of his father in 1805 he voted consistently with the Foxite whigs, and rendered valuable aid to the party in the repeated attacks made upon the Addington ministry. On his reluctant succession to the title he was a Scottish representative peer from December 1806 to June 1807. Despite his usefulness as an adviser on Scottish affairs, he failed to persuade his friends to obtain a British title for him and he was reduced to &#145;whispering, gesticulating and prophecizing&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons</span>). On 8 May 1806 he married Lady Olivia Letitia Catherine Fitzgerald (1787&#150;1858), youngest daughter of the second duke of Leinster and his wife, Emilia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Usher. They had three sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15635/', "George William Fox Kinnaird")</script>, and two daughters. In 1807 he began the construction of Rossie Priory in the Carse of Gowrie, Perthshire.<br>
<br>Kinnaird travelled much on the continent and was an avaricious buyer of works of art dispersed during the Napoleonic wars; in particular he bought much of the collection of Philippe &Eacute;galit&eacute;, duke of Orl&eacute;ans, and important Greek, Roman, and Egyptian sculptures. He was said to have given extravagant sums for what he regarded as his best pictures (which included works by Titian, Poussin, Teniers, and Rubens), with the result that in 1813 he was forced to sell his London possessions  (Whitley, 2.212&#150;13). Some of the remnant of the collection he sold to the National Gallery and the rest were brought together at Rossie Priory. Kinnaird died on 12 December 1826 in Regency Square, Brighton.<br>
