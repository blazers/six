<span class="headword">Tagore, Dwarkanath</span>  (1794&#150;1846), <span class="occ">businessman and philanthropist</span>, was born in Calcutta, Bengal, India, the second son of Rammani Tagore (1759&#150;1833), police officer, and his first wife, Menaka, daughter of Ramakanta Roy of Jessore. At the age of five he was adopted by the childless older brother of Rammani, Ramlochan, and his wife, Alakasundari, the elder sister of Menaka. Ramlochan was a man of liberal views and a patron of the arts. Rammani and Ramlochan, sons of Nilmani Tagore, were from the Jorasanko branch of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/94946/', "Tagore family")</script>. Dwarkanath's large extended family belonged to a subcaste of Brahmans known as Pirali, who were considered &#145;ritually impure&#146; by other Bengali Brahmans, a social rejection that perhaps made them more open to European influences. After learning to read and write Bengali, Dwarkanath attended Mr Sherbourne's English school for upper-class Indian boys. At the age of seventeen he married Digambari Rai (1802&#150;1839), a nine-year-old girl from Jessore. They had five sons, four of whom survived infancy: Debendranath (1817&#150;1905), Girendranath (1820&#150;1858), Bupendranath (1826&#150;1839), and Nagendranath (1829&#150;1858). <br>
<br>Ramlochan Tagore died in 1807, and a few years later Dwarkanath Tagore assumed the management of his landed estates. Under the tutelage of Robert Cutlar Fergusson, a prominent Calcutta attorney, he mastered complex <i>zamindari</i> law and soon became a legal adviser to other <i>zamindars</i> of Bengal. Although he continued to practise his family's Vaishnava Hinduism, he became a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the religious and social reformer Rammohun Roy and joined him in his campaigns to outlaw suttee (the self-immolation of a woman on her husband's funeral pyre) and to restore and extend freedom of the press in India. From 1822 to 1828 he served as <i>sheristadar</i> or head Indian officer of the salt agency of the twenty-four parganas (north-east of Calcutta) and, from 1828 to 1834, held the important post of <i>diwan</i> of the board of customs, salt, and opium. During this period he began his business career, investing in overseas trading ventures, developing indigo and sugar production on his estates, and lending money at interest. In 1829 he led a group of British and Indian merchants in establishing the first joint-stock commercial bank in India, the Union Bank of Calcutta. When the major agency houses of Calcutta were devastated by a commercial crisis in 1830&#150;33 Tagore emerged unscathed and formed his own agency house in partnership with William Carr and William Prinsep. Between 1836 and 1844 Carr, Tagore &amp; Co. was unique among the houses in organizing and serving as managing agents for several joint stock companies based on the newly introduced steam technology&#151;the Bengal Coal Company, the Calcutta Steam Tug Association, the India General Steam Navigation Company, and the Steam Ferry Bridge Company&#151;in addition to the Bengal Salt Company and the Bengal Tea Company. <br>
<br>In the 1830s and 1840s Tagore was acknowledged as the most prominent citizen of Calcutta. He financed the city's two leading English-language daily newspapers and supported the city's English-language theatre. His considerable philanthropic activities were directed towards endowing hospitals, supporting medical education, and helping the poor and blind to lead dignified lives. Although he believed that his country benefited greatly from British rule, he helped found India's two earliest political organizations, the Landholders' Society (1832) and the Bengal British Indian Society (1843). He also developed a large elegant estate at Belgachia, north of Calcutta, to which he regularly invited the city's European and Indian &eacute;lites. Invitations to Belgachia were valued second only to those of the governor-general of India and earned him the nickname Prince Dwarkanath. <br>
<br>On 9 January 1842 Tagore fulfilled his life's ambition and, like Rammohun Roy before him, sailed to Britain. <i>En route</i> he met national leaders elsewhere in Europe and was the first Indian to have a papal audience. In England he mixed with political and cultural &eacute;lites, was invited to Buckingham Palace more than once, and became a devotee of the London theatre. Contemporaries described him as handsome, charming, and knowledgeable. He returned home in October 1842 after a visit to Paris and the French royal family. On 18 March 1845 he again sailed to Europe, this time accompanied by four medical students, two of whom he sponsored. They were the first Indians to study medicine in Europe and returned home to successful careers. In the summer of 1846 Dwarkanath became seriously ill, probably of dengue fever. He died surrounded by friends in his room at St George's Hotel, Albemarle Street, London, on 1 August and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery on 5 August. At a large memorial meeting held in Calcutta he was eulogized as the greatest Indian of his time. Soon after he died the commercial crisis of 1847 wiped out many of the Calcutta agency houses along with most of his fortune, but wisely he had arranged for his extensive landed estates to be placed in trust for his sons. His remaining partners continued his firm under a new name, and four of their original joint stock companies survived for many years, three well into the twentieth century. Tagore's dream of a British-Indian imperial partnership was not to be, but he did succeed in introducing new business forms and new enterprises to India. His numerous illustrious descendants, including his grandson <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36404/', "Rabindranath Tagore")</script>, inherited his love of the arts, his broad views, and his genius for innovation.<br>
