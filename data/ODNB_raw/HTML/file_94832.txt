<span class="headword">Mackenzie,  Colin</span>  (1697/8&#150;1775), <span class="occ">physician and man-midwife</span>, was probably born at Muirton, Ross-shire, the second son of Kenneth Alexander Mackenzie of Muirton and his wife, Mary Mackenzie, daughter of Charles Mackenzie of Cullen; his parents were second cousins. His paternal grandfather, Colin Mackenzie of Muirton (<i>d</i>. 1724), was a writer to the signet in Edinburgh. The Mackenzies of Muirton were cadets of the Mackenzies of Kintail, who were headed by the earl of Seaforth. Details of his early education are unknown. The first record of Mackenzie is his attendance, as Calenus Makenje, Scotus  (Morris, 769) at the medical courses of Herman Boerhaave at the University of Leiden, which commenced on 10 November 1722; Mackenzie's stated age at that time was twenty-four. The second reference to him is his name on the class lists of Alexander Monro primus in Edinburgh in 1740 and 1742. William Wadd's suggestion that Mackenzie served in the British navy about this time cannot be confirmed from naval records. Despite the involvement of his Mackenzie kinsman George Mackenzie, third earl of Cromarty, in the Jacobite rising of 1745, there is no evidence to suggest that Mackenzie was anything other than loyal to the Hanoverian succession. He came to London and became part of the group of Scottish medical practitioners who exploited the lucrative opportunity of developing the speciality of obstetrics that had been left aside by English physicians.<br>
<br>The first comment on Mackenzie's accomplishments as an obstetrician is the citing of him in the third volume of William Smellie's <span class="italic">Treatise on Midwifery</span> (1764). Mackenzie is cited in collection 35, case 8 (case 387 in McClintock's 1878 edition), where he is described as Smellie's senior pupil. There is no detail on how Mackenzie became so skilled in obstetrics that he was employed in such a significant position. A rift between Smellie and Mackenzie is said to have arisen in May 1754 because Mackenzie dissected, without Smellie's knowledge, the body of a woman who had died undelivered in the last stages of pregnancy. This dissection was performed at Mackenzie's address in St Saviour's Churchyard, Southwark, after he had injected the veins and arteries with different coloured wax. In the first part of the dissection Mackenzie identified for the first time the precise relationship between the maternal and foetal blood supplies. He asked his friend John Hunter to assist in the second part of the dissection to confirm his findings. Hunter, realizing that this was significant new obstetric knowledge, brought his brother William to observe the findings of the dissection. William Hunter later assumed the credit for this discovery, although a pupil of Mackenzie, William Shippen, wrote an Edinburgh MD thesis in 1761 on this subject, extensively quoting Mackenzie's findings. Mackenzie was not publicly credited with this discovery until January 1780 when John Hunter wrote a letter to the Royal Society stating the exact details of Mackenzie's part in the dissection. Hunter said that he had intended to publish the details earlier and had discussed the possibility with George Fordyce. John Hunter's letter, which was not published by the Royal Society, drew a vehement response from his brother William and was said to have been the cause of the irresolvable rift between the Hunter brothers.<br>
<br>From 1754 onwards Mackenzie began to teach obstetrics from his address in St Saviour's Churchyard, and he also maintained a private lying-in establishment in Crucifix Lane, Southwark. Both addresses were close to the hospitals of St Thomas's and Guy's. He advertised his midwifery courses continuously until his death in 1775. On 6 April 1759 Mackenzie was granted the degree of MD by the University of St Andrews on testimonials by John Rutherford and John Alves. On 19 April 1765 Mackenzie was one of eight medical practitioners summoned to appear at the next meeting of the censor board of the Royal College of Physicians accused of practising physic. Of the eight practitioners so summoned only Mackenzie and John Harvie, Smellie's successor, were excused on the grounds that they confined themselves entirely to the practice of midwifery. Mackenzie never sought either a licentiate or a fellowship of the Royal College of Physicians, nor did he hold an institutional appointment.<br>
<br>Four sets of Mackenzie's midwifery lecture notes survive. These reveal that he developed a comprehensive syllabus, with extensive use of the &#145;phantom&#146; or &#145;machine&#146; to demonstrate the use of forceps and praeternatural deliveries. The midwifery archives of William Hey of Leeds, a pupil from January to April 1759, reveal that Mackenzie redesigned a set of forceps, which was in general use by his pupils. His &#145;touching lectures&#146;, an early form of antenatal care, were taught together with the recognition of natural gestational disturbances and evaluations on the midwifery publications of the period. Other obstetric pupils of Mackenzie included the American William Shippen, who took Mackenzie's courses from August to October 1759, and on Shippen's recommendation Thomas Parke, who attended Mackenzie's courses in 1771. William Perfect, another pupil, continued to correspond on obstetric complications with Mackenzie after he completed his course, and published Mackenzie's replies.<br>
<br>Mackenzie was invited to observe several Caesarean operations and subsequent dissections by other leading medical practitioners. His own eminence was recognized in the published accounts of these operations. Wadd described Mackenzie's personal life as generous and hospitable. He remained close friends with John Hunter and appears to have had an uncontroversial nature that endeared him to colleagues and pupils alike. His death on 31 January 1775 at his premises in St Saviour's Churchyard, Southwark, seemed unexpected because his courses of lectures were still being advertised when he died. His brother Alexander Mackenzie of Muirton obtained letters of administration and inherited his estate of &pound;12,000. David Orme purchased Mackenzie's collection of obstetric specimens, teaching equipment, and books for 1000 guineas and is known to have taught at St Saviour's Churchyard after Mackenzie's death. Mackenzie's teaching had spanned the period between the era of Smellie and that of Thomas Denman. During these two decades Mackenzie had little competition from other teachers outside the hospitals. He had no publications, and no archives or likenesses survive.<br>
