<span class="headword">Langton,  Walter</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1321), <span class="occ">administrator and bishop of Coventry and Lichfield</span>, was probably born in Langton West within Church Langton parish, Leicestershire, where in 1306 he received a grant of free warren. At his death he still held 3 acres there. By his own account he was the son of Simon Peverel (<i>d</i>. in or before 1304) and Amicia Peverel (<i>d</i>. in or before 1297); he was the elder brother of Sir Robert Peverel. When Walter died, his heir was Robert's son Edmund. The idea that he was a nephew of William Langton of Rotherfield, dean of York, arose from confusion with another Walter. It is tempting to suggest a relationship between Walter and Edward I's chancellor John Langton, but the latter name seems to have been a common one, and it is impossible to make any secure identification among the John Langtons with whom Walter Langton was associated.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareerinchurchandstate"></a>Early career in church and state</h2>Guisborough describes Langton as a poor clerk; elsewhere he is said to have been in Edward I's service from his youth. Appearing first as a wardrobe clerk in 1281&#150;2, he presented the account roll for the Welsh war of 1282&#150;4 in lieu of the controller, Thomas Gunneys. He was in Gascony with the king in 1286 and 1289. By 1287 he was acting as cofferer of the wardrobe, by 1290 as its controller&#151;the year in which, after some months as temporary lieutenant, he succeeded William Louth, created bishop of Ely, as keeper of the wardrobe. In that position he was responsible for improving the wardrobe's methods of accounting for its expenditure and receipts. After Chancellor Robert Burnell's death in 1292, he had temporary custody of the great seal before John Langton's appointment, while in 1295 he followed William of March (<i>d</i>. 1302) as treasurer of the exchequer, an office he was to retain until 22 August 1307&#151;just over a month into Edward II's reign.<br>
<br>Thanks to Edward I, Langton became a notable pluralist, and when on 7 January 1296 the Lichfield chapter sought licence to elect a bishop he was chosen (19 February). Archbishop Robert Winchelsey (<i>d</i>. 1313) gave his assent on 11 June; the spiritualities were restored the same day. Immediately afterwards he took the oath of fealty to the vicegerent of the king and received livery of the temporalities on the 16th. His consecration by B&eacute;raud de Got, cardinal-bishop of Albano, took place on 23 December at Cambrai, where he was engaged in peace negotiations with the papal nuncios. This was irritating to a metropolitan concerned to uphold his chapter's claim to license the ceremony's performance <i>alibi</i>. On his return he had to make his profession of obedience to Winchelsey before the high altar at Canterbury, and again at the archiepiscopal manor of Teynham, an elaboration which&#151;the continuator of Gervase of Canterbury implied&#151;was a conscious attempt to underline the priory's rights. As might be expected he had little time for his diocese. His episcopal register contains sections for his vicars-general: Master Robert Redeswell, archdeacon of Chester, for the period 1298&#150;1308, Master Ralph Leicester for 1312&#150;13&#151;there were others. Only slight indications of visitatorial activity can be traced, and many episcopal mandates emanate from outside the diocese.<h2>
<a name="Politicsanddiplomacy"></a>Politics and diplomacy</h2>He attended the marriage of Edward I to Margaret of France in September 1299, and on the following Saturday in the chapel of the archbishop's palace at Canterbury he celebrated mass for the queen, who received the customary gift of wax at his hands, afterwards deposited at the shrine of St Thomas. By the end of the reign he was regarded by Walter of Guisborough as the man specially favoured by the king, dealing with the burdensome business of the entire realm, and overshadowing Chancellor Langton. Queen Margaret described Langton as &#145;the king's right eye&#146;  (<span class="italic">Liber epistolaris</span>, 317), and it was he, so the story goes, who was chosen by Prince Edward to present the case to his father for giving Gaveston the county of Ponthieu. This so enraged the king that, losing his temper, he pulled out tufts of his son's hair.<br>
<br>It has been assumed that as a curialist&#151;a secularly minded clerk, devoted to royal service regardless of ecclesiastical susceptibilities&#151;Langton was in bitter conflict with Winchelsey at least from 1301, when the archbishop is said by Langtoft to have demanded Langton's dismissal as treasurer at the Lincoln parliament. It has even been alleged that an accusation by John de Lovetot in that year, to the effect that Langton was living in adultery with his stepmother and had murdered her husband, the accuser's father, was brought at Winchelsey's instigation. Other charges, such as pluralism and simony may have been close to the mark, but that of communicating with the devil was a common fabrication. Winchelsey himself claimed that he knew nothing of such matters before receiving a papal mandate. In May 1301 Langton was cited to respond and suspended from episcopal office. At this as at other times the king stood by his treasurer, making him a member of an embassy at the curia, where he had gone to plead his case. Following an inquiry by Winchelsey and the Dominican Thomas Jorz (<i>d</i>. 1310) he was cleared of all charges, although Boniface VIII's formal absolution was delayed until 8 June 1303. Lovetot was imprisoned for homicide and died in detention. J. H. Denton, Winchelsey's biographer, repudiates the notion that the archbishop bore any animus against Langton at this time, arguing that he promoted the accused's absolution and return to England. To what extent the treasurer in his turn disliked the archbishop, or contributed personally to his suspension in 1306 by a co-operative Clement V (<i>r</i>. 1305&#150;13), is difficult to assess, but it is credible that Langton would have felt that the primate's removal smoothed the path of royal policy.<br>
<br>In the early 1290s Langton was closely concerned with political and diplomatic affairs, being one of the judges in the Great Cause, the succession to the Scottish throne, which in November 1292 was decided in favour of John Balliol. Two years later, with the earl of Lincoln, he counselled Edward to make a temporary surrender of Gascony to Philippe IV, who found occasion to retain it until 1303. In 1305 he was a member of an embassy sent to Lyons to secure papal absolution from Edward's oath to maintain the charters, and attended Clement V's consecration on 14 November. On 2 July 1306, jointly with Archbishop William Greenfield of York (<i>d</i>. 1315), Langton was appointed keeper of the realm during Edward I's absence in Scotland. Before long, however, he deputed William Carleton (<i>d</i>. 1309) to act for him in the treasury. He was instructed to open the parliament of January 1307 at Carlisle, where John Ferrers, claimant to the earldom of Derby, accused him of champarty&#151;supporting a plaintiff in the courts for reward. Langton produced a royal pardon, which Ferrers alleged to be a forgery. He was not at Edward I's deathbed on 7 July, but heard the news at Wentworth in Yorkshire. By 23 July he had reached Burgh by Sands to commence his duties as the late king's executor.<h2>
<a name="Trialsandtribulations"></a>Trials and tribulations</h2>On his way to Westminster to arrange the funeral he was arrested and imprisoned, variously in the Tower of London, at Windsor, and at Wallingford. The Pauline annalist gives the date of his arrest as three days after the funeral cort&egrave;ge's arrival at Waltham on 4 August. On 22 August Walter Reynolds replaced him as treasurer. Nevertheless, a chancery warrant dated 1 October ordered the delivery of 20,000 marks to Langton and his fellow executors for royal funeral expenses. Gaveston may be assumed to have had a hand in Langton's disgrace and he benefited financially from the confiscation of the treasurer's assets, although the exaggerated claims made concerning these by some chroniclers are contradicted by the evidence of the wardrobe books and enrolled accounts of Langton's lands. Edward, according to the bulk of chronicle opinion, was bent on revenge.<br>
<br>Although Langton had alienated many and shared in the unpopularity of Edward I's final years, there were those, including Thomas of Lancaster (<i>d</i>. 1322), who had reason to be grateful for his help and shared his dislike of Gaveston. But in Winchelsey's absence the young king's violations of ecclesiastical privilege&#151;the impeding of an executor's functions, the seizure of clerical goods, and the imprisonment of a bishop&#151;passed without repercussion. Langton was ordered to appear before a panel of justices to answer for trespass, misprision, and losses inflicted on the king and others. Treasurer Reynolds and the barons of the exchequer were to search the memoranda for evidence of extortions, false enrolments, the securing of wrongful judgments, and the diversion of treasure from the exchequer to his own household. Other charges concern the sale of woods and land, appointment of inadequate sheriffs, and grants by chancery writ in Edward's absence. Proceedings at the exchequer between 1307 and 1311, for the collection of debts owed to him, and also before the justices at Windsor between 1307 and 1310, are extant. Many charges he admitted. His unscrupulous manipulation of statute merchant is revealed by the existence of some eighty-five extant recognizances in his favour, while income from his property contributed over &pound;2400 to the exchequer in 1308.<br>
<br>The king postponed the trial until after his coronation, for which he had hoped to enjoy Winchelsey's ministrations. By April 1308 Clement V was urging Langton's release, and Edward, in his efforts to secure the recall of Gaveston (now in exile for the second time), the rescinding of the latter's contingent sentence of excommunication, and other favours, on 3 October relinquished the bishop's temporalities. Finally, on 9 November, a date carefully noted in his episcopal register, Langton was set at liberty, being summoned to the parliament of March 1309. In August he received absolution for an unspecified offence against the papacy. June 1311 saw him imprisoned in York Castle for alleged involvement in a homicide, but in deference to clerical privilege he was transferred to the archbishop's custody, and by October he was free again. In January 1312 all charges were dropped, his lands were finally released, and he was permitted to pursue those that had been alienated as well as debts still unpaid, a task that was to occupy him and his executors for some fifty years.<h2>
<a name="Rehabilitationandlastyears"></a>Rehabilitation and last years</h2>Too able an administrator to be ignored, on 23 January 1312 he resumed the treasurership. One anonymous correspondent described him as the closest man to Edward after Gaveston, though Trokelowe thought he attained only a partial grace. He may have been behind the policy of calling in judicial estreats, cancelling atterminations, and pressurizing sheriffs to collect arrears. However, the ordainers, claiming that he had been appointed contrary to the ordinances, forcibly disrupted his work at the exchequer, and on 17 May 1312 secured his removal. According to Murimuth, Winchelsey excommunicated Langton during that year for ignoring a summons to a provincial council, arising from his reluctance to observe the ordinances. Langton defended himself at Avignon, where Winchelsey's case was promoted by Murimuth. The archbishop's death in May 1313 ensured Langton's rehabilitation, and he became a member of Edward's council, only to be removed as &#145;undesirable&#146; in 1315 during the Westminster parliament. He played a conciliatory part with other bishops in the negotiations preceding the treaty of Leake and was a member of the standing council. In 1318 he was unsuccessfully claiming compensation of &pound;20,000. He died at his residence in the Strand, London, on 9 November 1321.<br>
<br>Langton gave vestments, a gold chalice and two phials (worth &pound;80), and a bejewelled gold cross (worth &pound;200) to Lichfield Cathedral, enfeoffed the vicars choral with houses, and provided 20<i>s</i>. a year for their commons. He commenced the building of the &#145;decorated&#146; lady chapel, to the east of the chancel, and bequeathed money to complete it, though Edward II temporarily requisitioned this for his Scottish campaign of 1322. Within the chapel he erected a shrine for the relics of St Ceadda (Chad) at a cost of &pound;2000, and was buried nearby on 5 December 1321. What is said to be his defaced effigy in Derbyshire marble rests in the south aisle of the choir. Following Bishop Burnell's example at Wells, Langton built and crenellated a wall round the close with fortified gates, and he constructed a new palace on the edge of the enclosure. Within the town he built &#145;the great bridge&#146; and secured a grant of pavage. He repaired his London house, and completely rebuilt his residences at Eccleshall Castle and Haywood.<br>
