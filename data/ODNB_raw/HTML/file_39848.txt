<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Acland, Sir  Richard Thomas  Dyke</span>, fifteenth baronet  (1906&#150;1990), <span class="occ">politician and benefactor</span>, was born on 26 November 1906 at Broadclyst, Devon, his ancestral home, the eldest in the family of three sons and one daughter of Sir Francis Dyke Acland, fourteenth baronet (1874&#150;1939), landowner and liberal politician, and his wife, Eleanor Margaret, the outspoken anti-war daughter of Charles James Cropper, of Ellergreen, Westmorland, landowner and grandee. He was educated at Rugby School and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he received a second class in philosophy, politics, and economics in 1927. His career epitomized a family tradition of reformist public service, both nationally and in the west country.<br>
<br>Acland stood unsuccessfully as a Liberal for Torquay in 1929 and Barnstaple in 1931, capturing the latter seat in 1935. Radical by temperament, he became involved in the efforts of the Left Book Club to create a progressive alliance, and by the beginning of the Second World War he had moved from conventional, secular Liberalism towards a Christian socialist concern for the transformation of the privileged world in which he grew up. His Penguin best-seller of 1940, <span class="italic">Unser Kampf</span>, eloquently summed up the aspirations of many who saw the war as an opportunity to escape from the disillusionments of the 1920s and 1930s and establish a more egalitarian, less class-ridden society. This message was repeated in <span class="italic">The Forward March</span> (1941) and <span class="italic">What it will be like</span> (1942), and then elaborated, after the proposals of the social reformer Sir William Beveridge, in <span class="italic">How it can be done</span> (1943). Acland married, in 1936, the architect Anne Stella Alford, daughter of Robert Greenwood Alford, of Cheyne Walk, London. They had four sons, the youngest of whom died in 1945 when he was five days old. In 1939 Acland succeeded his father in the baronetcy upon the latter's death.<br>
<br>Having served briefly as a lieutenant in the Royal North Devon yeomanry, initially as a ranker, Acland returned to politics and brought together Forward March, a loose alliance of the discontented but hopeful, and the dissident intellectuals of the 1941 Committee under the writer J. B. Priestley, to found the Common Wealth Party in July 1942. Sheltered by the electoral truce between the major parties, the Common Wealth Party was active in wartime by-elections, and by 1945 had four MPs. Its appeal was essentially to the more modest, professional middle classes, notably in London and on Merseyside; although its membership was never more than 15,000, the party was organized with panache by R. W. G. Mackay, and the evangelistic Acland proved himself a master of electioneering tactics. For funding they could also rely upon sympathetic businessmen such as Alan Good and Denis Kendall.<br>
<br>In the general election of 1945 the Common Wealth Party lost all its MPs and the deposits of every candidate, as politics reverted to the familiar two-party pattern. Nevertheless, Acland's creation had helped to prepare the way for Labour's victory, and in this he was the crucial element. Rarely effective in the House of Commons, he was an inspired and tireless propagandist who packed wartime meetings across the country; tall, gangling, and intense, with hawklike features, and always putting his case in a rasping voice in simple, moralistic terms but with a socialist slant, he was seen by many as the true prophet of a better future. As an earnest of his personal commitment to common ownership, he made over his family's vast Killerton estates in Devon to the National Trust in 1943 and always lived frugally if generously. But Labour's first attainment of full power meant that his moment of historical importance had passed.<br>
<br>Acland returned to the House of Commons in 1947 as MP for Gravesend in Kent under the sponsorship of the Labour politician Herbert Morrison, and he remained committed to Labour for the rest of his life. Increasingly a maverick, divorced from mainstream politics, he resigned his seat in 1955 in protest against the development of the H-bomb and never returned to parliament. More and more his interests had become one-dimensional. A devout Anglican since 1940, he served as a church estates commissioner in 1950&#150;51 and maintained his friendship with left-wing bishops thereafter; but his attention came to centre upon education, a traditional concern of both his father and his grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30327/', "Sir A. H. D. Acland")</script>. Abandoning Westminster, he was senior lecturer at St Luke's College of Education, Exeter, from 1959 to 1974.<br>
<br>In retirement Acland wrote freely on educational matters, the problems of securing world peace, and, in his last years, the difficulties facing the &#145;third world&#146;. Now that he was a figure of the past, having outlived his period of influence during the Second World War, he had few readers. He continued to cherish his beloved Devon countryside and protect its traditions, including&#151;somewhat surprisingly&#151;stag-hunting. Acland died at his home, Broadclyst, on 24 November 1990 and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest son, John Dyke Acland (<i>b</i>. 1939).<br>
