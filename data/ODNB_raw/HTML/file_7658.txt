<span class="headword">Dillon,  John Talbot</span>  (1734&#150;1806), <span class="occ">traveller and historian</span>, was the elder son of Francis Dillon (<i>d</i>. 1767), whose father was William Dillon of Proudstown, Ireland, and Mary, daughter of Sir Mervyn Wingfield, sixth and last baronet, of Letheringham in Suffolk (the Wingfield baronetcy, granted by Charles I, could not pass through the female line). He was educated at Westminster School from about 1742 to 1747. In the latter year, at the age of thirteen, he joined the Royal Navy under the protection of Captain Dennis of the 28-gun frigate the <i>Mermaid</i>. He is not to be confused with <a href="#cosubject_71425">Sir John Talbot Dillon [<i>see below</i>]</a> of Lismullen, co. Meath, Ireland. The confusion, perpetuated by the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, arose not only from the two men having the same names and their each having a son named William, but also from the curious coincidence of their both being barons of the Holy Roman empire. The two men knew each other and their branches of the Dillon family were certainly related, but distantly. Clarification of their separate identities came in 1953&#150;6 when the Navy Records Society published <span class="italic">A Narrative of my Professional Adventures (1790&#150;1839)</span> (2 vols.) by Sir William Henry Dillon, illegitimate son of John Talbot Dillon: the introduction and notes by M. A. Lewis provide essential information.<br>
<br>Only two years after entering the navy Dillon seems to have peremptorily engineered his own discharge following a perceived insult in Portsmouth when he was evicted from the Parade Coffee House, an establishment reserved for naval captains. Thereafter, he seems to have spent much of his life abroad, particularly in Spain where he travelled extensively and learned the language and literature. His son's <span class="italic">Narrative</span> records that Dillon married first into a noble family from Namur, that his first wife died in childbirth, and that he had a network of friends and relatives in France. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7668/', "Sir William Henry Dillon (1780&#150;1857)")</script> was born to Dillon and Elizabeth, daughter of Henry Collins, but the couple do not seem to have married.<br>
<br>Dillon was clearly proud to be a baron of the Holy Roman empire&#151;a title conferred on his father, Francis, and passed down on his death in 1767&#151;since it is emblazoned on the title-page of his first publication, <span class="italic">Travels through Spain, with a view to illustrate the natural history and physical geography of that kingdom, in a series of letters</span> (1780). The preface makes clear that the <span class="italic">Travels</span> are the fruit of three separate visits to Spain. Much of the text is lifted (and acknowledged as such) from the <span class="italic">Introduction to the Natural History and Physical Geography of Spain</span> by William Bowles, published in Spanish at Madrid in 1775. Dillon weaves his own commentary and itinerary into Bowles's account and he also incorporates some of the observations of Don Antonio Ponz, secretary of the Royal Academy of San Fernando. The resulting work offered one of the most complete pictures of Spain then available to the British reading public and it was favourably reviewed, although its focus on natural history and antiquity made it old-fashioned at a time when travelogues were increasingly concerned with politics and cultural anthropology. In 1781 Dillon published <span class="italic">Letters from an English traveller in Spain, in 1778, on the origin and progress of poetry in that kingdom</span>. This text integrates personal anecdote with a comprehensive literary history that can be related to other mid-eighteenth-century explorations of the origins of national poetry (by, for example, Thomas Percy and Thomas Warton).<br>
<br>Dillon was soon regarded as an authority on the Spanish language. In 1781 John Bowles published an edition of <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span> in which he acknowledged Dillon's expertise. In 1786 Joseph Baretti published <span class="italic">Tolondron</span>, a ferocious attack on the inaccuracies of Bowles's edition; he related a meeting in a Holborn tavern with Dillon and Bowles in which Bowles had boasted that &#145;he could not utter a syllable of Spanish, nor understand a word of it, when spoken&#146;  (p. 6), Baretti wonders why Bowles had not consulted &#145;Baron Dillon&#146; for advice on his edition, since &#145;he speaks Spanish fluently&#146;  (ibid., 231). In the summer of 1781 Dillon corresponded briefly with Thomas Percy (the letters are reprinted in Nichols's <span class="italic">Illustrations</span>), who had read Dillon's account of Spanish poetry. Clearly emboldened by Percy's interest, Dillon wrote to ask for his help in requesting permission from the duke of Northumberland to be the dedicatee for his forthcoming history of the Holy Roman empire. Despite Percy's efforts this request was not granted. Dillon seems at this time to have been living on the proceeds of his literary labours: he writes to Percy that &#145;Though in my commercial occupations I have very limited prospects, very much so at present, I endeavour to occupy my mind and time with literary pursuits&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Illustrations</span>, 8.194). His literary output in the following years was substantial, if miscellaneous, and seems to reflect both his need to generate income and his genuine interest in European culture, liberty, and toleration. In 1782 he published <span class="italic">Sketches on the Art of Painting</span>, a translation from the Spanish of Anthony Raphael Mengs, painter to the Spanish king, and in 1783 <span class="italic">A Political Survey of the Roman Empire</span>. In 1788 appeared <span class="italic">The History of the Reign of Peter the Cruel, King of Castile and Leon</span>, in which Dillon attempted to acquit that ruler from charges of tyranny, somewhat to the scepticism of contemporary reviewers. A similar, though more romanticized work appeared in 1800, <span class="italic">Alphonso and Eleonora, or, The Triumphs of Valour and Virtue</span>, in which Dillon attempted to redeem the reputation of Alfonso VIII of Castile: the book's novelistic title seems calculated to attract a wide readership. In 1790 Dillon published a rather rushed compilation entitled <span class="italic">Historical and Critical Memoirs of the General Revolution in France in the Year 1789</span>, which is condemned for its opportunism, but praised for its editor's &#145;rational attachment to the cause of liberty&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, new ser., 10, Jan 1793, 84&#150;7). Perhaps surprisingly, Dillon speaks out against extending the right of liberty to slaves in the West-Indian plantations, maintaining that freedom would not improve their condition. Overall Dillon's works project a mixture of enlightened cosmopolitanism and aristocratic paternalism.<br>
<br>In later years Dillon resided in different parts of London with Mary Barbara, whom he had married in 1797 when he was sixty-three. Dillon's son describes her as his father's &#145;third wife&#146;, though she was probably only his second if, as seems likely, he never married his son's mother. Dillon was engaged in a protracted lawsuit over a property in Suffolk, which he eventually lost, and he seems to have had some connection with Manchester since he left to the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society some of his works on agriculture. He encouraged his son's active and successful naval career, and was acquainted with such diverse persons as Lord George Gordon, William Wilberforce, and the travel writer and agriculturist Arthur Young (Dillon was under-secretary to the board of agriculture when Young was secretary). His son describes his visits to Dillon's London residences as &#145;one continued round of dinners and entertainments&#146;  (W. H. Dillon, 1.157).<br>
<br>Dillon died at Brompton on 19 March 1806. In his will, he bequeathed to his &#145;beloved wife&#146; the:<blockquote>two Imperial Diplomas of Nobility granted by the most serene Emperors of Germany, Francis I and Joseph II to my Father and family &hellip; for her to keep and preserve in memory of her affection for me and to be disposed of by her according to her own discretion. (M. A. Lewis, &#145;Introduction&#146; to W. H. Dillon, <span class="italic">Narrative</span>, 1.x)</blockquote>This suggests that he had no legitimate issue. Although the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> obituary notice refers to him as &#145;Bart&#146; and his son's <span class="italic">Narrative</span> as &#145;Sir&#146;, he seems to have had no legitimate title save that of baron of the Holy Roman empire.<br>
<br>Dillon's namesake, <a name="cosubject_71425"></a><span class="headword">Sir John Talbot Dillon</span>, first baronet  (1740?&#150;1805)<span class="occ"></span>, of Lismullen, co. Meath, Ireland, was the son of Arthur Dillon (whose own father was Sir John Dillon of Lismullen, MP for County Meath) and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Dr Ralph Lambert, bishop of Meath. In 1767 he married Millicent (<i>d</i>. 1788), daughter of George Drake of Fernhill, Berkshire, and they had six sons and three daughters. Dillon sat in the Irish parliament representing co. Wicklow from 1771 and then Blessington, 1776&#150;83. He seems to have resided for some time at Vienna, and in 1782 Emperor Joseph II created Dillon and his heirs free barons of the Holy Roman empire in recognition of his &#145;exertions in Parliament to serve his country, by granting liberty to Roman Catholics to realize property in their native land&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 75, 1805, 878). He was a member of the Royal Irish Academy and was created a baronet on 31 July 1801. He died in Dublin in August 1805, &#145;much lamented by his acquaintance and numerous tenantry&#146;  (ibid.). He was succeeded as baronet by his eldest son, Sir Charles Drake Dillon (1770&#150;1840).<br>
