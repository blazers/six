<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mills,  Frederick Percival <span class="st"> [Freddie]</span></span>  (1919&#150;1965), <span class="occ">boxer</span>, was born on 26 June 1919 at 7 Terrace Road, the poorest street in Bournemouth, the youngest of the four children of Thomas James Mills, totter and marine store dealer, and his wife, Lottie Hilda (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Gray). At the age of eleven he received a pair of boxing gloves and would regularly spar with his brother Charlie. He left St Michael's School, Poole Hill, Bournemouth, at the age of fourteen and began work as an apprentice milkman. On 26 February 1936 he had his first match at Bournemouth's Westover ice rink. He won by a knockout in the first round. Shortly afterwards he was signed up by Bob Turner and began boxing full-time in fairground booths and at south coast venues.<br>
<br>By the end of 1940 (excluding fairground matches) Mills had fought fifty-eight professional fights, of which forty-six were wins. Although he never developed a great boxing style in these early fights, his two-fisted aggression, powerful left hooks, ability to take punishment, tenacity in pressing forward, and an exceptional courage became his well-established fistic characteristics. He was called up to the Royal Air Force in 1939 and spent the majority of his war years at various camps in England, first as a corporal and then as a sergeant instructor (physical training). He was allowed some time during his service to box professionally and on 7 August 1940 hitch-hiked to Liverpool (from Netheravon camp, Wiltshire) to fight, on the next day, the British middleweight champion, Jack McAvoy (1908&#150;1971). The match went its full ten rounds and, although McAvoy was not at his best, Mills boxed fluently and achieved a clear victory. The fight was not a title bout but its significance lay in its putting Mills firmly into the big league. Shortly afterwards Ted Broadribb, an ex-boxer and well-known boxing promoter, became his manager.<br>
<br>After important victories over Jack London (<i>b</i>. 1913) and again McAvoy, Mills was matched for a British and empire light heavyweight match against Len Harvey (1907&#150;1976) at White Hart Lane, Tottenham, on 20 June 1942. Although wartime restrictions were in force, a crowd of 40,000 assembled in north London for the afternoon fight. It proved, however, a short affair. During the second round Mills, with a withering left hook, floored Harvey for a count of nine, which he then followed with a left uppercut and a knockout. Throughout his career it was as a light heavyweight boxer that Mills proved his excellence. On the important occasions that he fought above his weight for major titles he either lost bravely or achieved unsatisfactory victories.<br>
<br>Towards the end of 1944 Mills was posted to India as part of the Inter-Services Sports and Entertainments Control Committee (ISSECC). Here he proved a popular light entertainer&#151;a career he subsequently continued, most notably, with BBC television. When he returned to Britain, he was not in condition to take on the world light heavyweight champion, the American Gus Lesnevich (1915&#150;1964), but Broadribb and the promoter Jack Solomons none the less arranged a match for 14 May 1946 at the Harringay arena. The beating Mills took was the worst he was ever to suffer and, although he went on to win the light heavyweight crown, he never fully recovered from it. In the second round, Lesnevich, with a right to the chin, knocked the contender down for a count of six. To general astonishment Mills came back in the third and punch for punch could claim the round. There ensued a fierce battle for the next six rounds with Mills probably ahead on points. However, in the tenth round the punishment of the second and Mills's unpreparedness for the fight showed. Lesnevich, brought down Mills twice with flurries of powerful blows to the head and body and the referee was forced to stop the fight. (In the September of the following year Mills beat the Belgian Pol Goffaux in four rounds for the vacant European light heavyweight title.)<br>
<br>If the first Lesnevich fight was the worst night of Mills's boxing career, the return bout was to be the best. When he stepped in the ring at the White City stadium on 26 July 1948 after a regime of hard training he looked in excellent physical shape. The fight went the full fifteen rounds and Mills, his chin often (characteristically) tucked in well behind his left shoulder, fought and won the coolest and best-judged fight of his career. Later that year, on 30 September 1948, he married Chrissie Marie McCorkindale (1914&#150;1994), daughter of his manager, Ted Broadribb, and the ex-wife of the boxer Donald McCorkindale. Mills had two natural children (daughters) with Chrissie, and a stepson from her previous marriage.<br>
<br>Mills defended his world light heavyweight title against the American Joey Maxim (<i>b</i>. 1922) at Earls Court on 24 January 1950. He dominated Maxim during the first three rounds, but during the next six the contender began to take the measure of the champion, and in the tenth floored Mills with a quick-fire round of blows to the head. Some weeks later, at the prompting of his wife, he retired from the ring.<br>
<br>In retirement Freddie Mills occupied himself with business interests, some boxing promotion, charity work, and frequent BBC television appearances as a light entertainer and celebrity guest (for which his craggy good looks well suited him). He was a keen family man and enjoyed spending time at the family home, Joggi Villa, 186 Denmark Hill, Camberwell, London. His business ventures, most notably a Charing Cross Road Chinese restaurant which later became a nightclub, after initial success began to fail. Mills was not the first boxer, nor has he been the last, to be taken advantage of by the unscrupulous fraternity that can sometimes be found close to the fight game. He died in the Middlesex Hospital, London, on 25 July 1965 after sustaining a gunshot wound to the head in Goslett Yard, behind his nightclub, the previous night. He was buried in St Giles's churchyard, Camberwell. The inquest verdict on his death was suicide, a finding that has been strongly contested. Whether he committed suicide or was murdered cannot be established, but what can be averred is that police corruption and gangland protection rackets were rife in the West End of the time.<br>
