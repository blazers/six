<span class="headword">Burrows,  Ronald Montagu</span>  (1867&#150;1920), <span class="occ">classical scholar and university principal</span>, was born in Rugby, Warwickshire, on 16 August 1867, the youngest of the three sons of the Revd Leonard Francis Burrows, a master at Rugby School and later rector of Limington, Somerset, and his wife, Mary Vicars (<i>d</i>. 1886). He was educated at Charterhouse School and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he held a scholarship and took firsts in classical honour moderations (1888) and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1890). From 1891 to 1897 he was assistant to the professor of Greek at Glasgow University. In 1892 he married Una Geraldine, daughter of Charles John Ridgeway, later bishop of Chichester. They had no children.<br>
<br>In 1898 Burrows was appointed professor of Greek at University College, Cardiff, moving to Manchester University as Hulme professor of Greek in 1908. In 1907 he published <span class="italic">The Discoveries in Crete and their Bearing on the History of Ancient Civilization</span>, which was well received by contemporary scholars, including Arthur Evans. A Christian socialist (and lifelong speculator on the stock exchange), Burrows, during his travels and archaeological expeditions, acquired a fascination for the history and politics of modern Greece. He became an Oxford DLitt in 1910.<br>
<br>Like many of his contemporaries Burrows was bowled over by the charismatic personality of Eleutherios Venizelos, the Greek politician. His enthusiastic championing of the Greek, and more particularly the Venizelist, cause found its fullest expression during his energetic and popular principalship of King's College, London, between 1913 and 1920. A founder in 1913 of the Anglo-Hellenic League, he wrote numerous articles supporting Greek territorial claims and upholding Venizelos in his feud with King Constantine I. With R. W. Seton-Watson, a colleague at King's, Burrows formulated in the autumn of 1915 the unsuccessful scheme, which was taken up by the Foreign Office, to lure Greece into the First World War on the side of the entente through the offer of Cyprus. So closely did Burrows identify with Venizelos that the Greek statesman invited him in 1916 to act as the &#145;semi-official&#146; representative in London of his breakaway provisional government in Salonika.<br>
<br>With Seton-Watson, Burrows was instrumental in the establishment in 1915 of the School of Slavonic Studies (subsequently the School of Slavonic and East European Studies of the University of London). This became a powerhouse of academic propaganda in favour of self-determination for the peoples of eastern Europe. Thomas Garrigue Masaryk (subsequently president of Czechoslovakia) was appointed a professor in the school and, in October 1915, delivered a highly influential lecture entitled &#145;The problem of small nations in the European crisis&#146;.<br>
<br>Besides his pioneering support for Russian and east European studies, Burrows was also responsible for the establishment of the Cervantes chair of Spanish and the Camoens chair of Portuguese. His most cherished foundation, however, was the Koraes chair of modern Greek and Byzantine history, language, and literature which was endowed by well-to-do Anglo-Greeks, by Venizelos himself, and by the Greek government. Burrows lived long enough to secure the appointment of Arnold Toynbee to the chair in 1919. But his death in the principal's residence at King's College, Strand, London, on 14 May 1920, at the early age of fifty-two, spared him the furious controversy that arose when the donors sought Toynbee's removal on political grounds.<br>
<br>A romantic philhellene to the end, in a letter written on his deathbed Burrows expressed his &#145;boundless faith&#146; in Venizelos (&#145;my Pericles&#146;) and his love for Hellas. Burrows was one of the progenitors of &#145;area studies&#146; in Britain. His enthusiastic and entrepreneurial promotion of these studies, however, was combined with a political na&iuml;vety that blinded him to the problems that can arise from reliance on external sources of funding in politically charged fields of study.<br>
