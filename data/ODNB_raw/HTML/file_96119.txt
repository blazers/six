<span class="headword">Mobbs, Sir  (Gerald) Nigel</span>  (1937&#150;2005), <span class="occ">property developer and businessman</span>, was born on 22 September 1937 at 38 Wake Green Road, Moseley, Birmingham, the only son of Lieutenant-Colonel Gerald Aubrey Mobbs (1911&#150;1976), property developer, and his wife, Elizabeth, younger daughter of Frank Lanchester, of Kenilworth, Warwickshire. He was born into considerable wealth, the family fortunes being based on the 600 acre Slough trading estate to the west of London, which had been founded by his grandfather Sir (Arthur) Noel Mobbs (1880&#150;1959), a Northamptonshire businessman who had amassed his first fortune in the motor trade. His father, Gerald Mobbs, served with the airborne division during the Second World War, and was wounded and taken prisoner at Arnhem in 1944. (He became managing director of Slough Estates in 1956 and chairman in 1971.) Mobbs's great-uncle, Edgar Mobbs, was a legendary rugby player, killed at Passchendaele in 1917.<br>
<br>Mobbs was educated at Marlborough College and Christ Church, Oxford, where he failed to obtain a degree in his chosen subject, engineering. He attributed this failure to engineering being &#145;extremely boring&#146;, and to being himself no more than &#145;academically average&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 29 Sept 1990). On leaving college he was given a job at Hillier Parker, the Mayfair estate agents, to learn the ropes of the property business, and after nine months was brought into the family firm, in 1960. That was the year his grandfather died, and he inherited his grandfather's secretary, an experience he later described as &#145;very frightening&#146;  (ibid.). He was always destined to reach the top, despite starting, as he admitted, &#145;with no qualifications whatsoever&#146;  (ibid.). In 1963 he was made a director, and in 1971 he became managing director. Five years later, on the death of his father, he became both chief executive and chairman, and continued in both roles for the next twenty years, and as chairman until shortly before his death.<br>
<br>The Mobbs family combined hard business with a country lifestyle, and a year after starting at Slough Estates, on 14 September 1961, Mobbs married (Pamela) Jane Marguerite Berry (<i>b</i>. 1937), the second of four daughters of (Geoffrey) Lionel Berry, second Viscount Kemsley, the newspaper baron whose family at that time owned both the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> and the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>. The two had met at a hunt. They had a son, Christopher, and twin daughters, Virginia and Penelope.<br>
<br>The origins of the Mobbs family's fortune lay in an area of some 600 acres of land, originally farmland, which had been used by the War Office as a depot for repairing and ultimately dumping government vehicles used during the First World War. In 1920 it was put up for sale and was bought for &pound;7 million by a group of motor trade entrepreneurs headed by Sir Percival Perry (who later set up Ford's UK operations) and Mobbs's grandfather Noel, who initially invested just &pound;20,000 in the venture. The former government vehicles were gradually repaired and sold off, releasing land and funds to begin developing the huge buildings on the estate for letting to various manufacturers. By 1960 the Slough estate was one of Britain's first and largest industrial parks, with some 240 manufacturers represented. It even boasted its own power station.<br>
<br>Mobbs was said to show more of the entrepreneurial spirit of his grandfather than his father, and when he took control of the company in 1976 he pursued a policy of direct and active management of the Slough estate alongside the acquisition of other property in order to diversify the group's assets outside the Slough area, which had by then become known as the popular &#145;M4 corridor&#146;. By the time he stepped down as chief executive, Slough Estates' properties were worth an estimated &pound;1.8 billion. He was a man of robust opinions and convictions, straightforward and decisive, who did not take kindly to being either crossed or criticized. He managed down to matters of detail that in most other companies of the size of Slough Estates would have been delegated. Few, however, questioned his undoubted &#145;feel&#146; for business, and he became sought after to fill non-executive roles in other major boardrooms. He had a thirty-year association with Barclays Bank, of which he became a director in 1979 and served as chairman for two years. He was chairman of Charterhouse Banking Group from 1977 to 1983 and deputy chairman of the retailer Kingfisher (owner of Woolworths, Superdrug, and B&amp;Q) from 1990 to 1995, in the latter year playing the leading role in demoting the then chairman Geoff Mulcahy, who had fallen out with his chief executive, and (after an interim period in which he himself served as chairman) bringing in a replacement. He was chairman of Bovis Homes for nine years until the year of his death. At various times he was a director of Cookson, the electronics group, and of the Howard de Walden estate, one of London's largest commercial and residential landowners.<br>
<br>A convinced free-marketeer, Mobbs served Margaret Thatcher's government as an adviser on property affairs from 1980 to 1986. He was chairman of the libertarian pressure group Aims of Industry from 1985 until 2002, and a member of the advisory panel on deregulation at the Department of Trade and Industry from 1988 to 1994. He was variously chairman of the Conservative Party (1993&#150;6), vice-president of the Association of British Chambers of Commerce (1976&#150;90), and lord lieutenant of Buckinghamshire (1997&#150;2005). He was chairman of the Historic Royal Palaces from 2003. He was knighted in 1986.<br>
<br>Despite all his public commitments, Mobbs maintained a determined grip on the management and affairs of Slough Estates, and this led to a split in 1996 with Roger Carey, who had been Slough's managing director for eighteen years, and who resigned in protest at Mobbs's controlling manner. Under pressure from investors Mobbs reluctantly agreed to split the roles of chairman and chief executive, but continued as executive chairman until he was forced, through ill health, to retire in August 2005.<br>
<br>Although Mobbs's skills as a businessman were widely sought after in industry and the City, and he accepted boardroom posts at several other substantial businesses, he was said to be happiest when at what he described as his &#145;modest&#146; Buckinghamshire estate near Princes Risborough, surrounded by his family, horses, dogs, and sheep. He was an imposing man, more than 6 feet tall, an accomplished fox-hunter, skier, and golfer. He was once compared by a City journalist to &#145;a slightly lumbering but affectionate and appealing Great Dane&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 29 Sept 1990). He died of cancer of the kidney at his home, Widmer Lodge, Pink Road, Parslows Hillock, Princes Risborough, Buckinghamshire, on 21 October 2005. A memorial service held on 16 February 2006 at the chapel of the Royal Hospital, Chelsea, of which he was a commissioner, was attended by numerous representatives of government, the royal family, and business. He was survived by his wife, Pamela, and their three children.<br>
