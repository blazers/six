<span class="headword">Bayeux,  Serlo  of</span>  (<em>c.</em>1050&#150;1113<span class="mult">x</span>22), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born about the middle of the eleventh century as the son of an unknown married priest, possibly at Bretteville-sur-Odon in Normandy. He should not be confused with his contemporary, Serlo, abbot of Gloucester (<i>d</i>. 1104). The little that is known about Serlo of Bayeux's career comes primarily from his poems. He was a canon of Bayeux Cathedral who lost his paternal possessions on account of the fact that he was the son of a priest. Six of his eight known poems are concerned with his predicament as a priest's son, his fight to regain his lost property, and his appeal to Odo, bishop of Bayeux. They are (in chronological order): two invectives against anonymous knights, written probably before 1079 or 1080; two invectives against St &Eacute;tienne at Caen (one to the monks and one to Abbot Gilbert) composed in 1079 or 1080; an encomium to his patron, Bishop Odo, written after 1087; and his sixth poem &#145;On the Defence of the Sons of Priests&#146; dated to 1095 or 1096. A seventh poem is addressed to the English poet Muriel, a nun of Wilton, whose own work has not survived; it is one of a series of poems dedicated to her by Serlo, Baudri of Bourgueil, and Hildebert de Lavardin. Serlo's eighth poem is historically the most interesting, for it contains his eyewitness account of the English conquest of Bayeux by Henry I in 1105, which led to the defeat in the following year of the king's brother, Duke Robert Curthose, at Tinchebray. Apart from the horror and destruction inflicted by the Anglo-Norman assault, Serlo, as a ducal supporter, describes the city as having eleven churches (the cathedral being the largest), Bishop Odo's beautifully decorated court, and the house of the rich burgher Conan, as well as the precious chapter house and the ducal castle. The main occupation of the inhabitants was trade, a statement which leads Serlo to reproach his fellow citizens for crimes like robbery, false moneying, and oppressing widows and orphans. He ends his poem with an apostrophe to his new benefactor, an unidentified member of the ruling family who had given him a mantle.<br>
<br>Serlo does not appear in the mortuary roll of Matilda, abbess of La Trinit&eacute; at Caen, compiled in 1113, and was therefore probably still alive at that date. He had died by 1122, however, since his name appears in the mortuary roll of Vital, abbot of Savigny, compiled in that year. The position of his name there in third place, after Bishop Odo and the burgher Conan, indicates that he was a prominent inhabitant of Bayeux.<br>
