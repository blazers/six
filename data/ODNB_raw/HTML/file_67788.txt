<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Enoch ap Evan</span>  (<em>c.</em>1599&#150;1633), <span class="occ">murderer</span>, was born at Clun, Shropshire, the elder son of Edward ap Evan (<i>d</i>. 1633), yeoman, and his wife, Joan (<i>c</i>.1561&#150;1633). Enoch and his brother John (<i>c</i>.1602&#150;1633) helped their father farm his holding, and Enoch served in the trained bands in 1631. The family, including Enoch's five sisters, was pious, reading the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> twice daily. He purchased a <span class="roman">Bible</span>, which he carried with him, attended weekday lectures, and sometimes rode three or four miles to hear sermons. About 1631 he became dissatisfied with episcopal polity, kneeling at communion, and the sign of the cross in baptism, probably owing to his exposure to the network of puritan ministers centred around Julines Herring, a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Arthur Hildersham and lecturer at St Alkmund, Shrewsbury, from 1618 to 1635. A year later he ceased to kneel at communion, believing this posture &#145;thrust the heeles and legges behind the bodie&#146; and thus impeded the flow of spiritual nourishment. &#145;By inspiration&#146; he came to the conclusion that the Lord's supper should be received while sitting or standing and bowing  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/244/67). Convinced that he was one of the elect, he believed the Holy Spirit guided him.<br>
<br>Enoch's mother and brother attempted to dissuade him from such views, and during a discussion about kneeling on 30 June 1633 she reputedly told him he was &#145;a very sorry fellow&#146;  (Studley, <span class="italic">Looking-Glasse</span>, 36&#150;7). After being jilted on the night of 4 July by the woman he expected to marry he got little sleep. About one o'clock the next afternoon, feeling called to &#145;vindicate the cause of God &hellip; by effusion of his owne brothers bloud&#146;  (ibid., 35), he hit John in the head with the blunt end of a hatchet as the latter napped with his head on the kitchen table, knocking him to the floor, and then decapitated him with two more blows. When his mother entered the room, shrieked, and rebuked him, he hit her in the face, though he had not planned to harm her. In the ensuing struggle he struck her with the hatchet between the left shoulder and the neck, slicing into her breast and pushing her to the floor, and then decapitated her. After knocking a hole in the wall to create the impression of a break-in, he carried the heads, wrapped in linen and a jerkin, into a meadow and secreted them under a pile of ferns to be burnt. He then went to his cousin's house, read <span class="roman">Isaiah</span> 1, and borrowed a copy of Lewis Bayly's <span class="italic">The Practise of Pietie</span>. As the two men walked toward Enoch's house two maids and some neighbours apprehended him and turned him over to a local magistrate, Sir Robert Howard.<br>
<br>At first Enoch professed his innocence, but he finally confessed to Erasmus Powell, vicar of Clun, who had baptized him. According to the record of his examination, &#145;the divill being strong with him at that instan[t] tempted him to doe this&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/242/39). As he was transported to the county gaol at Shrewsbury his sister confronted him, asking why he had committed the murders. &#145;Peace foole&#146;, he reportedly replied, &#145;hold thy tongue, wee live in a false Church, and thou shalt see a change shortly&#146;  (Studley, <span class="italic">Looking-Glasse</span>, 53). At his trial he manifested neither &#145;distraction&#146; nor a remorseful countenance, though he expressed sorrow for the crimes  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/244/67). Numerous ministers visited him in prison, hoping to obtain his repentance, and the puritans also wanted him to blame his actions on something other than the family argument over kneeling, which he had cited. Mental illness would have been a better explanation in their judgement, and there were unsubstantiated rumours that he was an Anabaptist. Determined to use the murders to tarnish puritans, Peter Studley, Arminian-inclined minister of St Chad's, Shrewsbury, visited him eighteen times, concluding that he was not insane, that he continued to hold Calvinist tenets, and that he believed Satan could not prevail over God's children. However, he told Gervase Needham, vicar of Bishop's Castle, Shropshire, that he had experienced visions of a dove.<br>
<br>Prior to his execution, on 20 August, ap Evan allegedly told other prisoners that killing the hangman would not be sinful. In order to take communion before his execution he received it kneeling, and on the gallows at Bishop's Castle he cried to God for mercy and exhorted the audience to heed his example. Bound in chains, his corpse remained on the gibbet for more than two weeks before unknown persons secretly buried it.<br>
<br>Accounts of the murders appeared in several penny dreadful pamphlets, <span class="italic">A True Relation of a Barbarous and most Cruel Murder</span> (1633) and <span class="italic">A Mirror for Murders</span> (1633), as well as Studley's tract, <span class="italic">The Looking-Glasse of Schisme</span> (1634), which Archbishop William Laud's chaplain licensed. Although he refused to approve a rival account by another local magistrate, Richard More, <span class="italic">A True Relation of the Murders</span>, which deemed ap Evan insane, it circulated in manuscript and was rebutted by Studley in <span class="italic">A Refutation of such Calumnies</span> (1635). In 1636 the puritan Henry Burton cited Studley's book as evidence of a Jesuit conspiracy to defame puritans, and its publication was noted in a list of grievances presented to the Short Parliament by Sir Robert Harley. The refusal of Laud's chaplain to license More's account, eventually published in 1641, was the subject of a complaint to the Long Parliament. Robert Wright, bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, was interested in the case, and Augustine Lindsell, bishop of Hereford, responded to the affair by restricting the combination lecture at Bishop's Castle to conformist ministers. The author of <span class="italic">The Ranters Ranting</span> (1650) retold the story with gross inaccuracies to conclude his sensationalist pamphlet.<br>
