<span class="headword">&Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh,  C&uacute; Choigcr&iacute;che</span> <span class="st"> [Cucogry O'Clery]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1624&#150;1664), <span class="occ">scholar and scribe</span>, was the son of Diarmuid &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh, in turn the son of An Cosnamhach &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh. There has been considerable confusion between this C&uacute; Choigcr&iacute;che and a supposed son of Lughaidh &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh (author of <span class="italic">Beatha Aodha Ruaidh</span>, the life of Aodh Ruadh &Oacute; Domhnaill) bearing the same name. Attempts to disentangle the two seem to lead to the conclusion that all, or virtually all, of the work ascribed to the son of Lughaidh was actually written by the son of Diarmuid. Indeed, the existence of the supposed &#145;son of Lughaidh&#146; may be in doubt and it has been suggested that the son of Diarmuid may have been wrongly affiliated to Lughaidh in a nineteenth-century pedigree. (The matter is contentious and still awaits resolution.) Lughaidh &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh, in turn, had a brother named C&uacute; Choigcr&iacute;che (son of Mac Con) who left behind a number of poems. There seems to be no way of knowing whether the &#145;Coochogery O'Clery&#146; who held land in the parish of Killybegs Lower in 1632 is to be identified with any of the aforementioned bearers of the name of C&uacute; Choigcr&iacute;che &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh.<br>
<br>C&uacute; Choigcr&iacute;che, son of Diarmuid, is associated above all with the great work of scholarship which culminated in the production of the &#145;Annals of the kingdom of Ireland&#146; (popularly known as the annals of the four masters), compiled between 1632 and 1636. He is named among the compilers as one of the principal assistants to his kinsman, the scholar and Franciscan lay brother M&iacute;ch&eacute;l &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh. Even before M&iacute;ch&eacute;l &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh's return to Ireland in 1626, C&uacute; Choigcr&iacute;che was involved in that great enterprise. As early as 1624 he had been engaged by the Franciscans of Donegal, in their place of refuge along the River Drowes, to arrange the martyrologies of Aonghus and &Oacute; Gorm&aacute;in in the style of the Roman martyrology. He is mentioned in relation to the &#145;Seanchas r&iacute;ogh &Eacute;reann accus genealuighi na Naomh n&Eacute;reannach&#146;, penned in Athlone in 1630 and concerned with the lives and pedigrees of the kings and saints of Ireland, and the revised version of the traditional accounts of successive settlement of Ireland, the <span class="italic">Leabhar gabh&aacute;la &Eacute;ireann</span> (&#145;Book of invasions&#146;) written in Lisgoole, near Enniskillen, in October 1631. In August 1633 &#145;in the convent of Donegal&#146; (on the banks of the River Drowes) he testified to the reliability of Brother M&iacute;ch&eacute;l's copy of the martyrology of &Oacute; Gorm&aacute;in. Some years after M&iacute;ch&eacute;l &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh's return to Louvain (July 1637) C&uacute; Choigcr&iacute;che &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh and his fellow worker, Fear Feasa &Oacute; Maoil Chonaire, appeared in August 1641 before a general chapter of the Franciscan order in Multyfarnham, co. Westmeath, and defended their work against the rather petty strictures of the young Franciscan Tuileagna &Oacute; Maoil Chonaire.<br>
<br>One C&uacute; Choigcr&iacute;che &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh composed poems about 1655 for Toirdhealbhach mac Cathbhairr and Calbhach Rua &Oacute; Domhnaill, and C&uacute; Choigcr&iacute;che, son of Diarmuid, is known to have composed a poem in 1662 on the death of M&aacute;ire, sister of Aodh Ruadh &Oacute; Domhnaill. Manuscript works ascribed to C&uacute; Choigcr&iacute;che &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh, son of Lughaidh, but which may possibly be the work of the son of Diarmuid, consist of a copy of the &#145;topographical poems&#146; of Sea&aacute;n &Oacute; Dubhag&aacute;in and Giolla na Naomh &Oacute; hUidhr&iacute;n; the unique manuscript copy of Lughaidh &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh's life of Aodh Ruadh; a copy of the four masters' recension of <span class="italic">Leabhar gabh&aacute;la &Eacute;ireann</span>, the O'Clery book of genealogies; an important collection of verse and prose preserved in the National Library of Ireland  (NL Ire., MS G 131); and manuscripts 2542&#150;2543 in the Biblioth&egrave;que Royale, Brussels.<br>
<br>Towards the end of his life C&uacute; Choigcr&iacute;che &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh was living in west Mayo, where, at Corr na hEilte (Gortnaheltia, parish of Addergoole), near Burrishoole, he penned his will in or about the year 1664. Now largely indecipherable and prefixed to his book of genealogies, his will recorded his intention to leave his possessions to his sons Diarmuid and Se&aacute;n and directed that he be buried in Burrishoole friary, co. Mayo. There is no indication of the date of his death, but it probably occurred some time in the 1660s.<br>
