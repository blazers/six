<span class="headword">Pope <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Campion]</span>,  Maria Ann</span> <span class="st"> [<em>performing name </em>Mrs Spencer]</span>  (1775&#150;1803), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born in Waterford, Ireland, the second daughter of a merchant named Campion, of an old Cork family. Her mother died in the same year as her daughter. After her father's death she was brought up by a relative. She started to read many plays and attend the Waterford Theatre. This gave her a taste for the stage, and her relative took her for an audition in Dublin with Richard Daly. However, she was considered too young to be taken on; indeed the manager at first thought he was auditioning the older woman. But she persisted and was eventually engaged by Hitchcock, on behalf of Daly, for the Crow Street Theatre in Dublin, where she made her d&eacute;but on 13 February 1790, as Monimia in Thomas Otway's <span class="italic">The Orphan</span>. She was very nervous and had to be propelled on to the stage by Hitchcock and promptly fainted. After a rapid recovery she went on eventually to become the heroine of the Irish stage.<br>
<br>Maria Ann Campion appeared with G. F. Cooke as Desdemona to his Othello at Crow Street on 19 November 1794 and next played with F. E. Jones at the theatre in Fishamble Street. She soon adopted the name Mrs Spencer at the behest of some relatives. Although she had hoped to go to America, the move came to nothing, and on 13 April 1795 she received admiring reviews as Juliet in Belfast. She moved to England for a brief spell in Liverpool and in York with Williams, where a benefit was held for her on 9 April 1796. She then moved between Ireland and England, being in Kilkenny later in 1796 and in York again for the 1796&#150;7 season, where on 31 January she recited Collins's &#145;Ode to the Passions&#146;. In Dublin she met W. T. Lewis, who procured for her an engagement at Covent Garden. There she played Monimia again for three nights, and gained enthusiastic reviews from the <span class="italic">True Briton</span>, the <span class="italic">European Magazine</span>, and the <span class="italic">Monthly Mirror</span>. She played Juliet to the Romeo of H. E. Johnston and the Mercutio of Lewis, followed by Cordelia with C. Murray, by Jane Shore, and by Indiana. On 24 January 1798 she married, at St George's, Hanover Square, the actor and painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22528/', "Alexander Pope (1763&#150;1835)")</script>, a widower of some ten months, and two days later she was announced as &#145;Mrs Pope, late Mrs Spencer&#146; in Thomas Morton's <span class="italic">Secrets Worth Knowing</span>. On 13 February she was the original Maria in Thomas Holcroft's <span class="italic">He's Much to Blame</span>.<br>
<br>Mrs Pope played a variety of parts during the season, including an original role in <span class="italic">Curiosity</span> for Holman's benefit performance. She was the first Princess of Mantua in <span class="italic">Disinterested Love</span>. In the summer of 1798 she and her husband both played in Edinburgh, and by 15 October she was back at Covent Garden on a salary of &pound;8 a week as Desdemona, followed by the first Lady Julia in Thomas Dibdin's <span class="italic">Five Thousand a Year</span>. She played Elizabeth in <span class="italic">The Count of Burgundy</span>, written by her husband for his benefit. For her own benefit she played the Queen in <span class="italic">King Henry VIII</span>, which earned &pound;391 gross. The next season saw her as Cordelia and as Juliana in Frederick Reynolds's <span class="italic">Management</span>, and on 7 November 1799 as Jane Shore, which received hostile notices. The following summer she spent in Birmingham, with a return to Covent Garden and a tour to Manchester, Hull, Sheffield, and Liverpool. In 1801 she accompanied her husband to Drury Lane, making her first appearance there as Juliet on 1 February. On 2 March she was Lady Caroline Malcolm in the first production of Richard Cumberland's <span class="italic">Serious Resolution</span>, and later that year visited Nottingham and Brighton. Other important roles followed, but on 10 June 1803, while playing Desdemona for Cooper's benefit, she was taken ill. On 18 June she had a stroke and died, at 5 Half Moon Street, Piccadilly, where she had lived for several years, leaving a daughter, born in 1801 (a son, born in 1799, died soon after birth). She was buried on 25 June in the same grave as Elizabeth Pope, her husband's first wife, in the west cloister in Westminster Abbey. Maria Ann Pope was slender in figure, with a sweet face and expression and a retentive memory.<br>
