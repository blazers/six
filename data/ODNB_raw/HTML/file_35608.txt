<span class="headword">Orton,  Charles William  Previt&eacute;-</span>  (1877&#150;1947), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born at Arnesby in Leicestershire on 16 January 1877. He was the younger son of the vicar there, the Revd William Previt&eacute;-Orton (1837&#150;1912), and his wife, Eliza Swaffield Orton. The latter, whose maiden surname of Orton was adopted by her husband in 1870 when they married, was of Sicilian descent; but the future historian showed few traces of his Italian ancestry in either appearance or temperament. Shy and diffident by nature, he was forced to terminate his school career at Franklin's Preparatory School, Leicester, at the age of fourteen after chronic sight problems led to the removal of his left eye; he was afterwards taught at home. Only in 1905, when he was twenty-eight, did Previt&eacute;-Orton's health recover sufficiently to enable him to enter his father's old college of St John's, Cambridge. His academic career there was one of unbroken success. After obtaining a first class in both parts of the historical tripos (1907, 1908) and being awarded the Gladstone and members' prizes in the same years, he was elected a fellow of St John's in 1911. He was devoted to the welfare of his college for the rest of his life. In 1913 Previt&eacute;-Orton married his first cousin, Ellery Swaffield, daughter of the Revd John Swaffield Orton. Throughout their long married life the couple lived in a large house, 55 Bateman Street, Cambridge; and for over thirty years it was there that Previt&eacute; (as he was universally known) was most often to be found, vigorously engaged in a ceaseless round of writing, teaching, and&#151;above all&#151;editing the work of other medieval historians.<br>
<br>Although little read now, Previt&eacute;-Orton's first book, <span class="italic">The Early History of the House of Savoy</span> (1912), immediately established his reputation as a leading English exponent of the exact scholarship and exhaustive attention to sources exemplified by the influential German historical scholarship of the period. Though not a deeply imaginative historian himself, he displayed an exceptional range of detailed knowledge. Somewhat surprisingly, perhaps, his essays on Marsiglio of Padua and his critical edition of the latter's <span class="italic">Defensor pacis</span> (1928) have proved to be the most enduringly important of his works. Inevitably the more popular and general historical enterprises to which Previt&eacute; devoted so much of his formidable industry and editorial skills now seem considerably more ephemeral. In sometimes slightly uneasy partnership with his Cambridge colleague Zachary Brooke, he was responsible for supervising the later stages of the most ambitious and demanding English collaborative venture yet attempted in the field of medieval European history: only in 1937 were the eight volumes of <span class="italic">The Cambridge Medieval History</span> finally brought to a more or less satisfactory close&#151;to Previt&eacute;'s own intense relief. However, Previt&eacute;-Orton's own historical influence was greatest among the many readers of his three general textbooks. Only after the 1950s did his <span class="italic">Outlines of Medieval History</span> (1916), his Methuens textbook <span class="italic">A History of Europe, 1198&#150;1378</span> (1937), and his posthumously published <span class="italic">Shorter Cambridge Medieval History</span> (2 vols., 1952) gradually cease to hold their place among the most widely read of all popular introductions to medieval European history.<br>
<br>Previt&eacute;-Orton's wide erudition and extraordinary editorial energies naturally received recognition outside Cambridge. In 1925 he was invited to become joint editor, and from January 1927 to January 1938 sole editor, of the <span class="italic">English Historical Review</span>. After receiving the degree of LittD from his own university in 1928, he was elected FBA in 1929. When a chair of medieval history was at last founded in Cambridge in 1937, he was a natural choice as the first professor. Most unfortunately, a haemorrhage in his remaining eye during the Christmas vacation of 1937&#150;8 caused him temporary blindness; he was obliged to resign the editorship of the <span class="italic">English Historical Review</span> and to relinquish many of his other responsibilities. However, he continued to work strenuously to the very end. Even after his retirement from his chair in September 1942, he agreed to undertake a certain amount of supervision for St John's. It was while teaching a student at his home on 11 March 1947 that he died suddenly of a heart attack. In the opinion of those who knew him personally, as a scholar Previt&eacute; was lucid and accurate but passionless rather than original. As an editor, however, he was critical, shrewd, painstaking, and generous: few scholars made so sustained a contribution to the reputation of medieval studies at Cambridge during the first half of the twentieth century.<br>
