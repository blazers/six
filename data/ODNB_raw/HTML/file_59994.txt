<span class="headword">Stephen <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Thackeray]</span>,  Harriet Marian <span class="st"> [Minny]</span></span>  (1840&#150;1875), <span class="occ">wife of Leslie Stephen</span>, was born in London on 27 May 1840, the youngest of the three daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27155/', "William Makepeace Thackeray (1811&#150;1863)")</script> and his wife, Isabella Gethin Creagh, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Shawe (1816&#150;1893). One of her sisters, Jane, had died in infancy in 1839, but Minny (as she was always known) was very close to her older sister, Anne [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35761/', "Ritchie, Anne Isabella")</script>]. Shortly after Minny's birth, her mother sank into a deep post-partum depression, the gravity of which her father did not wholly appreciate. The depression developed into a more serious mental illness, and Isabella Thackeray was subsequently confined in a private asylum in 1842. Thackeray then put his daughters in the care of his mother in Paris for the next four years, and reclaimed them when he moved to 13 Young Street, London. <br>
<br>The unusual circumstances of their childhood meant that Minny and her sister were closer to their famous father than might otherwise have been the case. In London they were brought up in the midst of literary visitors and guests&#151;Tennyson recalled a young Minny looking up from a book that she was reading and asking her father: &#145;Papa, why don't you write books like <span class="italic">Nicholas Nickleby</span>?&#146;  (G&eacute;rin, 31). Minny's education, like that of Anne, was not rigorous&#151;it was conducted by a series of governesses, visiting masters, the occasional attendance at lectures, and the experience of foreign travel. Unlike her sister, however, Minny demonstrated no particular gift for writing, although her letters demonstrate &#145;a capacity for shrewd and witty commentary on the people she met&#146;  (Peters, 140). Thackeray seems to have worried that his youngest daughter might have inherited the mental fragility of her mother, and was very careful to shield her from worrying or depressing situations; part of the reason for the move to Young Street had been to remove Minny from the constant influence of his mother's severe Calvinism. But he also felt that Minny represented &#145;the balance wheel in the family&#146;  (<span class="italic">Selected Letters of Leslie Stephen</span>, 1.280), her practical intelligence and sweetness of personality counteracting the sometimes fiery creativity of Thackeray and Anne. <br>
<br>In 1860 Thackeray was finally financially secure enough to buy an impressive house at 2 Palace Green, near Kensington Palace. Mrs M. C. M. Simpson recalled the cooking parties and amateur theatricals that the family held there, saying that Minny was a &#145;first-rate actress&#146;  (Simpson, 107), and commenting more generally on her appearance and character:<blockquote>No one who knew intimately Thackeray's younger daughter &hellip; could ever forget her. The heroine in her sister's novel <span class="italic">Old Kensington</span> must have been drawn from her. Her beautiful bronze hair, brilliantly white teeth and delicate complexion one minute with the soft tint of the china rose and then again white as a lily, gave one the impression of the most exquisite freshness. One day she would look like the young girl she really was and, on the next, twenty years older, so varying were her moods and expression. (ibid., 109)</blockquote>The death of their father in 1863 left both his daughters desolate, and they went to live with their gloomily Calvinistic grandmother, who insisted on casting doubts on the salvation of Thackeray's soul. She died a year later, and by 1865 Minny and Anne were entering into company again. Thackeray had died intestate, but Minny and Anne were left in comfortable financial circumstances, and they bought and shared a house at 16 Onslow Gardens. Here they divided the household duties, Minny acting as housekeeper and Anne as hostess, each finding the occupation of the other distasteful. <br>
<br>It was at a dinner party held by Lady Stephen that Minny first met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36271/', "Leslie Stephen (1832&#150;1904)")</script>. Elizabeth Gaskell had also been present, and told Stephen afterwards that she had foreseen that Minny would become his wife. Stephen took his time over the courtship, however: &#145;I was shy, diffident, and fully impressed with the conviction acquired at Cambridge that I was an old don&#151;a superannuated bachelor standing apart from all thought of domestic happiness&#146;  (Stephen, <span class="italic">Mausoleum Book</span>, 9&#150;10). Nevertheless, Minny and Stephen were engaged in December 1866, and married in St Paul's, Onslow Square, on 19 June 1867 at eight o'clock in the morning. After the wedding, which was small and informal, they continued to live in the Onslow Gardens house with Anne. <br>
<br>Minny and Stephen had a very successful marriage. Stephen adored his loving, sincere, and unaffected wife, and Minny was quick to interest herself in his pursuits and views. She accompanied him on his tour of America in 1868 and, although no great walker, she shared in his love of mountains and mountaineering. They had honeymooned in Switzerland, and Minny's interest in the subject meant that she later prevented Stephen from being part of the tragic expedition in 1874 on which James Marshall was killed in Courmayeur&#151;Stephen, in this case, had deferred to her opinion: &#145;Minny fancied him [Marshall] to be an unsafe walker&#146;  (Stephen, <span class="italic">Mausoleum Book</span>, 21). She was also interested in Stephen's intellectual views, even in his most controversial opinions. Of his &#145;Broad church&#146; article in <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span> (March 1870) she wrote to her brother that she was &#145;very thankful that he has written it, &amp; that I belong to a man who can speak the bare truth &amp; who tries to make others do the same&#146;  (<span class="italic">Selected Letters of Leslie Stephen</span>, 1.18). <br>
<br>Minny suffered two miscarriages before giving birth prematurely to her daughter, Laura Makepeace (1870&#150;1945), on 7 December 1870. In 1873 the couple moved to their new home at 8 Southwell Gardens, and in summer 1875 Minny was pregnant again, but on 27 November 1875 she was taken ill in the night with convulsions and did not regain consciousness, dying of eclampsia on 28 November 1875, Stephen's forty-third birthday. He never celebrated his birthday again. Minny was buried at Kensal Green cemetery. Their daughter, Laura, was later diagnosed as mentally handicapped and after much soul-searching on Stephen's part was placed in an institution for the mentally infirm in 1891. <br>
<br>Minny seems to have been somewhat sentimentalized by Stephen and his contemporaries as the perfectly gentle, sweet-tempered, and motherly Victorian woman. Stephen's view of her accords well with his pre-feminist outlook. Wary of emancipated women, he felt that they lacked the education needed for the vote, and as a young Cambridge radical he had opposed the reform for fear that &#145;it might save the Church of England for a quarter of a century&#146;  (Annan, 110). Harriet Stephen's letters, however, reveal aspects of her character which have been glossed over: &#145;Like her father, she had an acute sense of human ridiculousness, which she could pillory in a phrase, and she had a rod of iron in her character&#146;  (<span class="italic">Selected Letters of Leslie Stephen</span>, 1.18). She certainly helped to inspire a new sense of confidence and assertiveness in her husband. Though Stephen later remarried, he was devastated by the loss of his first wife and continued to respect her memory; she features prominently in the first section of his <span class="italic">Mausoleum Book</span>, a memoir of his domestic life, which suggests that, while he felt guilty about leaving domestic arrangements to his second wife, Julia, he had been less distanced from them in his life with Harriet.<br>
