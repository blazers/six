<span class="headword">Gurney,  Samuel</span>  (1816&#150;1882), <span class="occ">philanthropist and banker</span>, was born on 3 February 1816, at Upton, Essex, the second of three sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11775/', "Samuel Gurney (1786&#150;1856)")</script>, Quaker philanthropist and discount banker, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sheppard (<i>d</i>. 1855). He had six sisters.<br>
<br>Educated at the Friends' school, Rochester, and at Grove House, Tottenham, Gurney married young in 1837. His wife was Ellen (1814&#150;1892), daughter of William Foster Reynolds, of Carshalton House, Surrey. Gurney lived for many years at The Culvers, Carshalton, near the Reynolds property. He became a Surrey magistrate and was high sheriff of the county in 1861. Subsequently he moved to 20 Hanover Terrace, Regent's Park, and took a house at Brighton.<br>
<br>His father was a partner in Gurney's Bank of Norwich and in Overend, Gurney &amp; Co., bill brokers of Lombard Street. When as a young man Gurney became a partner in the latter business it was already the leading discount house in the City of London. After his father's death in 1856 a new generation of partners made a series of bold and ill-judged investments before floating the business to the public in 1865. In the most notorious bankruptcy of the mid-Victorian period, Overend Gurney stopped payment on 10 May 1866, leaving debts of some &pound;11 million. Other businesses were sunk in its wake and the limited liability company was temporarily discredited as a device. Samuel Gurney junior's reputation was less damaged by this fiasco than those of some colleagues: he remained on the board of companies interested in marine and life assurance, and in submarine telegraphy in the Mediterranean and elsewhere.<br>
<br>As befitted a Quaker, Gurney's chief contributions were public and philanthropic. The abolition of the slave trade in British colonies in 1833 had fissured the British anti-slavery movement. One new campaigning organization was the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society, formed in 1839 chiefly by whig radicals; Gurney joined its committee in 1846, and served as its president for eighteen years. Older generations of abolitionists considered that the society was antagonistic to anti-slavery's traditional religious and political ecumenicism. The society was riven by policy disputes. At its annual meeting in 1855, for example, Gurney left the chair in anger when speakers criticized Anthony Ashley Cooper, earl of Shaftesbury, and the Turkish Aid Mission Society of the USA for associating with slave owners. Gurney's relations with American merchants and financiers gave him a realistic sense of the prospects of American abolitionists. Like his father, Gurney was active in the peace movement, but felt alienated by the growing sectarian militancy of campaigners like Richard Cobden and John Bright.<br>
<br>From 1857 until 1865 Gurney was MP for the small borough of Penryn and Falmouth (which seat he represented jointly with the whig banker Thomas Baring, afterwards first earl of Northbrook). He was an independent Palmerstonian Liberal who supported religious liberty and the extension of free trade but made no parliamentary mark. He was one of a group of rich, influential Quakers nicknamed &#145;weighty Friends&#146;.<br>
<br>Gurney served on committees for penal reform and for public amenities in London, and against the opium trade. He was a founder of the Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association in 1859 which relieved alike the thirst of Londoners and the suffering of dumb beasts. The Linnean and Royal Geographic societies elected him to fellowships. Gurney died from diabetes at Bishop's Down, Grove Spa, Tunbridge Wells, on 4 April 1882.<br>
