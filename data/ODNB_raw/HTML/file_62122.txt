<span class="headword">Cosgrave <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Daly]</span>,  Mary Josephine</span>  (<em>c.</em>1877&#150;1941), <span class="occ">local administrator and social worker</span>, was born in Naas, co. Kildare, the daughter of James William Daly and his wife, Jane. She was educated at the Convent of Mercy in Naas and later studied at St Andrews University, where she was awarded an LLA. From 1896 she taught in the training college of Our Lady of Mercy in Baggot Street, Dublin. She also worked as an examiner in English under the intermediate board of education, Ireland. On 9 July 1901 she married the barrister and journalist Maurice Joseph Cosgrave.<br>
<br>In 1922 Mary Cosgrave was elected to Rathmines urban district council, and she was a member of Dublin corporation from 1933 until her death. She sat on numerous committees, including the housing committee, the City of Dublin welfare committee, and the City of Dublin vocational education committee. She was also a committee member of the Cheeverstown Convalescent Home for Little Children and the National Children's Hospital. She was chairman of the Meath Hospital committee and the county libraries committee, and vice-chairman of Dublin county council until 1930. She also played a leading role in the Civics Institute. Cosgrave was a key figure in the Irish Women Citizens' Association, of which she was also chairman. She represented the National Council of Ireland at international congresses.<br>
<br>Cosgrave was interested in social work, particularly maternity and child welfare work. She was active in the Women's National Health Association of Ireland and served as president of that association from 1939. The association's campaign against TB led to her association with Peamount Sanatorium and she became president of the sanatorium committee in 1939. Cosgrave died at her home, Woodside, 17 Park Drive, Cowper Gardens, Rathmines, Dublin, on 17 November 1941.<br>
