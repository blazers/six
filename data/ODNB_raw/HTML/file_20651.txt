<span class="headword">O'Hurley,  Dermot</span>  (<em>c.</em>1530&#150;1584), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic archbishop of Cashel and martyr</span>, the son of William O'Hurley, gentleman, and his wife, Honora O'Brien, was born near Emly, co. Tipperary. At a later date, following his father's acquisition of the estate, he moved to Lickadoon Castle, co. Limerick. Some time before 1551, destined for a learned profession, he was sent to study at Louvain, where he took his master of arts degree at the Coll&egrave;ge du Lis, and in 1559 he was appointed professor of philosophy there. In all he spent about fifteen years at Louvain, pursuing legal studies with great success, becoming a doctor of civil and canon law and dean of the college of St Ivo. About 1574, on the recommendation of Cardinal Guise, he left to take up a position at Rheims, where he remained for four years. According to Stanihurst, some time before 1577 he wrote a Latin treatise, <span class="italic">In Aristotelis Physica</span>, which secured his reputation as a &#145;commendable philosopher&#146;. By 1580 he was in Rome. A Latin poem composed there in his honour in 1581 mentions that he taught law in the city; presumably he did so as a professor at the Sapienza. He was also connected with the Roman Inquisition, probably, it has been suggested, as a legal expert to whom problems were submitted.<br>
<br>Once in Rome, O'Hurley's career changed forever. Apparently at the request of Cardinal Como he was encouraged to involve himself in the planning of papal policy for Ireland. While serving in this capacity he sometimes acted as an interpreter between Como and the representatives of rebel Irish lords who appeared in Rome seeking aid. He was almost certainly the author of a report written for Como in 1580 outlining the conditions under which Catholics toiled in Ireland and providing a list of Irish clergy on the continent who could be called upon to return home to forward the papal interest. Curiously, the wider and implicitly political importance of this report has been somewhat ignored by Catholic historians. It offered a markedly positive vision of the prospect of the papacy succeeding in securing the allegiance of Ireland's predominantly Catholic population in the face of only a small force of English heretics. In so doing, it and other reports modelled on it helped to persuade the pope, Gregory XIII, to commit men and money to a combined Italian / Spanish landing in the south of Ireland in support of the rebellion of Gerald Fitzgerald, fourteenth earl of Desmond, an enterprise that was doomed to failure and ended with the slaughter at Smerwick, co. Kerry, of all those involved. Given these circumstances, it is difficult to accept without reservation the opinion of some scholars that O'Hurley may have had nothing to do with Irish Catholic plots against English protestant power. This is no mere quibble, as his eventual beatification at the end of the twentieth century rested on the supposition that he was a purely religious martyr, his career untainted by involvement in political affairs.<br>
<br>After 1580, the invasion d&eacute;b&acirc;cle notwithstanding, the papacy continued to pursue an aggressive policy towards English rule in Ireland, and it was towards this end that O'Hurley was promoted to the vacant archbishopric of Cashel in 1581. That he was a layman&#151;&#145;scholaris Limericensis&#146;&#151;was no barrier to his advancement: extant documents in Rome show that he was admitted to the clerical state, given the four minor orders, and advanced to subdiaconate, diaconate, and priesthood within just sixteen days, between 29 July and 13 August 1581, the pope issuing a special papal brief in his favour. O'Hurley received his tonsure and orders from the Marian bishop of St Asaph, Thomas Goldwell, and during the papal consistory of 11 September 1581 he was proposed for Cashel by the archbishop of Sens, a close associate of Pope Gregory who was unofficially supervising Irish ecclesiastical affairs at this time.<br>
<br>The pope's eagerness to appoint him to Cashel is explained by O'Hurley's family background. The O'Hurleys were a well connected clerical dynasty in Munster. More particularly, Dermot's father had been a servant of the earls of Desmond, acting about 1540 as steward of Glenogra, a Desmond manor, and other sources reveal that William Oge O'Hurley of &#145;Lyckadowne&#146;, Dermot's half-brother, was likewise a Desmond associate at the time of the Desmond revolt. In 1581, with the rebellion still alive, there was no one in Rome better suited to represent the papal cause in Munster. Early the following year the pope entrusted him with a letter to Desmond, in which the earl and his allies were encouraged to continue their resistance to the heretical rule of Elizabeth; the archbishop of Sens, as &#145;Protector of Ireland&#146;, also gave him letters for Desmond.<br>
<br>O'Hurley left Rome to take possession of his diocese in the summer of 1582, proceeding via Rheims, where he stayed with the rector of the university, William Allen, and where in August he contracted a severe illness. He made a slow recovery, and it was not until August 1583 that he resumed his homeward journey. Having boarded a Drogheda ship at Le Croisic in Brittany, he put ashore on the east coast of Ireland later that month, disembarking at Holmpatrick, a small harbour at Skerries, co. Dublin. The Ireland to which he returned bore no resemblance to the country he had imagined while abroad. Far from being on the brink of overthrowing English rule, it lay covered by a blanket of government repression, the last embers of Catholic rebellion for the moment all but extinguished, with the main rebel, Desmond, holed up in the mountains of Munster in fear of his life. O'Hurley was soon a fugitive too. Shortly before his arrival the government had been forewarned of his coming. It set its spies to work, so that after an abortive journey towards Waterford he was forced to abandon temporarily his plans for reaching Desmond. When next he left Dublin, O'Hurley turned north instead of south in order to evade his pursuers. Even so he was nearly captured in Drogheda, and for refuge he had to turn to those he could not fully trust, the Catholic nobility of the pale who had remained loyal to the English crown throughout the recent unrest. Having stayed with &#145;some others of good account within the Pale&#146;, he made his way to Slane Castle, co. Louth, where, at the behest of Catherine, Lady Slane, he was hidden for a time in a secret chamber in the castle. While there he ventured into Cavan to meet local priests, but when he returned to Slane he had an uncomfortable encounter with another guest, Sir Robert Dillon, the chief justice of the queen's bench, and he was soon on the run again. Suspecting his arrest was imminent he decided to set out for Munster without delay, and he departed Slane in the company of Piers Butler, the bastard son of Desmond's chief tormentor, the queen's general in Munster, Thomas Butler, tenth earl of Ormond. By September he had arrived at Carrick-on-Suir Castle, co. Tipperary, Ormond's home, where through Piers Butler's introduction he had a face-to-face meeting with the earl.<br>
<br>The protestant overlord of a Catholic territory, Ormond was anxious not to arouse sympathy for O'Hurley by moving against him; moreover, he was probably curious to discover if the archbishop could be convinced to encourage Desmond to surrender. For his own part, O'Hurley hoped to persuade Ormond to spare Desmond's life. With so little common ground between them O'Hurley and Ormond could only agree that the archbishop could have the benefit of the earl's protection so long as he remained within the boundaries of his diocese, where the earl could have him watched. In the ensuing days O'Hurley paid a pilgrimage to Holy Cross Abbey, where he may have held mass: a government captain reported on 15 September that &#145;pilgrims from all parts&#146; were repairing to the abbey, seemingly aware of the arrival there of the new papal archbishop. By 20 September he was back under Ormond's roof in Carrick, where such was his confidence in the earl's powers of protection that he decided to try to arrive at an arrangement with his ecclesiastical rival Miler Magrath, the Church of Ireland archbishop of Cashel, so that the two might share the same diocese without friction. To further this objective he wrote Magrath a brief letter, signing it Dermitius Hurrileus, his only known autograph letter. As a record of an age of religious conflict it is a curious artefact, full of pleasant platitudes from one foe to another, but it also reveals something of O'Hurley's political sense. Addressing Magrath as &#145;Most Reverend Lord&#146;, he promised to be a good neighbour&#151;&#145;I desire to plant and foster friendship and peace&#146;&#151;and he offered his rival an important concession, being prepared not to dispute Magrath's claim to the title of archbishop: &#145;For myself I am content with the academic title [Dr O'Hurley] or to be called by my own name&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Carte 55, fol. 546). Behind this apparent moderation, however, lay a more uncompromising message. With Ormond as his protector O'Hurley felt he was beyond the reach of Magrath and the state authorities. He hoped Magrath would appreciate that it might be better to reach a mutually advantageous arrangement rather than become embroiled in a potentially damaging tussle for position.<br>
<br>The writing of this letter is O'Hurley's last recorded act as a free man. Shortly afterwards Ormond bowed to the request of his kinsman, Lord Slane, who had come down to Carrick to request that O'Hurley be handed over into his custody to be taken to Dublin. The circumstances behind this episode have never been adequately explained. According to a Catholic account of his life composed early in the seventeenth century, O'Hurley acquiesced in his own arrest, hastening to Dublin to appear before the Irish council so that he could defend Slane against allegations of conspiracy and convince the government &#145;that he himself had come to Ireland with a true ecclesiastical spirit and [only] to preach the faith&#146;  (<span class="italic">Analecta of David Rothe</span>, 429&#150;31). If true, it proved a fatal miscalculation. The same source records that Slane had him put in chains, and on reaching Kilkenny, the main overnight stop on the journey to Dublin, he was locked up in the public gaol. Once in the capital he was imprisoned in Dublin Castle.<br>
<br>For the Dublin government, headed by the lords justices, Adam Loftus, archbishop of Dublin, and Sir Henry Wallop, O'Hurley's arrest and incarceration had as many drawbacks as benefits. Ideally they wished to see him transferred to the Tower of London, lest his continued presence in Dublin spark unrest. Their anxiety to wash their hands of him was all the greater as the decision had been taken at Whitehall before December 1583 to put him to torture, in order &#145;to gain his knowledge of all foreign practices against her majesty's state&#146;  (O'Reilly, 70&#150;73). On 10 December they tried to effect his removal to London by claiming&#151;untruthfully&#151;that there were no instruments of torture in Dublin. After further prevarication, and acting on the advice of Secretary Walsingham, in March 1584 they issued a commission to Sir Edward Waterhouse and Sir Geoffrey Fenton to proceed against O'Hurley, and he was mercilessly tortured in Dublin Castle dungeon, among other things having his feet toasted against a fire while encased in tin boots. On 7 March they reported the outcome. Despite an offer of pardon should he confess all, he denied any involvement in political intrigue, utterly refusing to reveal the details of his mission or to implicate others. To his abusers his defiance was proof of his guilt, demonstrating &#145;with what bad mind he came to Ireland instructed from Rome to poison the hearts of the people with disobedience&#146;  (Brady, <span class="italic">State Papers</span>, 74&#150;6).<br>
<br>The following day the lords justices again became agitated about O'Hurley's presence in their care on discovering that on the eve of his torture he had written a letter to Ormond, his &#145;patron and favourer&#146;, and another since, to a kinsman living in Dublin. Both letters were seized&#151;they no longer exist&#151;but Loftus and Wallop were concerned that he may have succeeded in smuggling others out, especially to Ormond, whom they feared greatly because of his influence with the queen. Accordingly they determined to do away with O'Hurley as quickly as possible, and Walsingham's approval was sought to have him executed by martial law, thus avoiding the thorny problem of putting his case before a Dublin jury. Although favouring this course of action, Walsingham could not readily accede to their request without first seeking the queen's opinion, for by this time the use of martial law in Ireland was under review, a matter of mounting controversy. Elizabeth I for her part gave a typically evasive response, in April sending instructions through an intermediary that if the desired verdict could be secured by ordinary course of law, O'Hurley should be put on trial; only if not should he be executed by martial law. Still the lords justices prevaricated, but eventually, on 20 June 1584, as a new lord deputy was due to arrive to take up office, and before the earl of Ormond landed in Dublin following a visit to court, O'Hurley was hanged under royal warrant. Far from being killed as an example to others, as Loftus and Wallop had once advocated, his execution was carried out quietly, occurring early in the morning at Hoggen's Green, a stretch of open ground outside the city walls. It was entirely counter-productive, generating more sympathy for him in his native country in death than he had ever enjoyed in life. He was at once hailed as a martyr by the citizens of Dublin, who rescued his remains for burial, and among women of the city a cult formed to venerate his memory. On the continent the enemies of Elizabeth I exploited to the full the propaganda potential of his violent death. In 1587 a woodcut illustration of his torture and execution appeared in a book printed in Antwerp, and subsequently more exaggerated accounts of his sufferings were published, so that in time his name became synonymous across Europe with the harsh plight of Ireland's Catholics.<br>
<br>In the 1970s O'Hurley's case as the principal Irish martyr of the sixteenth century was revived by the Dublin Diocesan Commission on Causes, and his beatification took place in Rome on 27 September 1992.<br>
