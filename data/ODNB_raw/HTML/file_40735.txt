<span class="headword">Charteris <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Wyndham]</span>,  Mary Constance</span>, countess of Wemyss  (1862&#150;1937), <span class="occ">hostess</span>, was born on 3 August 1862 at 44 Belgrave Square, London, the eldest of the five children of the Hon. Percy Wyndham (1835&#150;1911), second son of the first Lord Leconfield, and his wife, Madeline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Campbell (<i>d</i>. 1920).<br>
<br>Mary Wyndham was brought up in an unconventional household that was both aristocratic and artistic. Her father, an MP and master of fox hounds, was an important patron of the Pre-Raphaelites; her mother, a talented decorative artist herself, filled her house with artists and writers. Mary was educated at home by a German governess. Her looks were outstanding. In 1886 she was painted by Edward Poynter as a dark, thoughtful beauty, and in 1899, famously, by Sargent as one of the three Wyndham sisters: above the swirl of satin and tulle, her face is that of a woman of distinction and intelligence with chiselled features and large dark eyes.<br>
<br>On 9 August 1883 Mary Wyndham, persuaded by her mother, married Hugo Richard Charteris, Lord Elcho (1857&#150;1937), heir to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36833/', "Francis Wemyss-Charteris-Douglas, eighth earl of Wemyss")</script>. It was a good match, but not a happy marriage. Lord Elcho could be brilliantly amusing, but he was a tricky character, a compulsive gambler on the stock exchange, and flagrantly unfaithful. His father, an attractive but overbearing man who despised his son, owned Gosford, a grand Georgian house with an extensive estate in East Lothian. His other house, Stanway, in Gloucestershire, he gave to his son on his marriage. Mary Elcho fell in love, not with her husband, but with his house.<br>
<br>Stanway, built in the seventeenth century of golden Cotswold stone, with a great tithe barn in the garden and a gatehouse that might be, but isn't, by Inigo Jones, was, and remains, a house of immense romantic charm. Mary Elcho decorated it with William Morris wallpapers in the arts and crafts manner, helped by her mother, who was simultaneously moving into Clouds, perhaps the most famous of all the arts and crafts houses. The Elchos' seven children (one died in infancy) were born between 1884 and 1902. Hugo Elcho was often absent, and his gambling left her short of money, but at Stanway his wife ruled as squire, filling the cold house with warmth and life.<br>
<br>Mary Elcho was the least rank-conscious of the great Edwardian hostesses. At Stanway she mixed Fabians with fashionable young men, working writers with cabinet ministers; but most of her closest friends were members of the group known as the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42005', "Souls")</script>, of which Arthur Balfour (1848&#150;1930) was the central figure. Others were Margot Asquith, Ettie Desborough, Lord Curzon, and Mary's brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37052/', "George Wyndham")</script>. The Souls were literary, intellectual, and above all conversationalists. The hostess acted as conductor, with the most brilliant male guest playing first violin. In these roles Mary and Arthur excelled.<br>
<br>For all his charm Balfour found communicating at a deeper level nearly impossible; he needed Lady Elcho's warmth and zest and she became a safety valve, the only person in whom he could even partly confide. The friendship helped Mary Elcho to withstand the difficulties of her marriage, and they corresponded for forty years. Balfour's letters are full of politics, friends, social life, philosophy, and the books he was reading or writing; hers&#151;and she was the more natural letter writer&#151;swoop from subject to subject, funny, appreciative, self-mocking, knowing how to entertain.<br>
<br>But Mary Elcho's warm-bloodedness had its hazards. In 1895, accompanied by her children and their governess, she went to stay in Egypt with her cousin, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31938/', "Wilfrid Scawen Blunt")</script>, the poet, drawing-room revolutionary, and notorious philanderer. They camped in the desert and in his diary Blunt noted proudly that between her tent and his &#145;there were Mary's naked tell-tale footsteps in the sand&#146;  (Longford, 312). Mary returned to England pregnant by Blunt, but Hugo behaved according to the conventions of the day and accepted the child as his own.<br>
<br>In June 1914 Hugo Elcho succeeded his father as ninth earl of Wemyss, and he decided to let Stanway and move to Gosford, where he lived in comfort with his mistress, Lady Angela Forbes. Mary was saved from exile from her beloved Stanway by James Barrie, the playwright, who employed her daughter, the author <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30480/', "Lady Cynthia Asquith")</script>, as his secretary, and who took over Stanway, with the family in it, every summer.<br>
<br>In the 1914&#150;18 war the Wemysses lost two sons: the eldest, Ego, in Egypt in 1916, the youngest, Yvo, in France in 1915, when he was just nineteen. To their memory their mother wrote the story of their lives. <span class="italic">A Family Record</span> (1932) consists of letters to and from the two sons, skilfully linked by Mary Wemyss's cool, well-written prose. It is a moving work.<br>
<br>Mary Wemyss's last years were spent at Stanway where, &#145;dowdily dressed, unconscious of the distinction that ever accompanied her&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 3 May 1937), she recreated the Stanway magic for another generation of Charteris children. In the spring of 1937 she was taken ill at Stanway and died in a Cheltenham nursing home on 29 April. Her burial took place at Stanway on 1 May.<br>
