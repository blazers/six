<span class="headword">Farewell,  Francis George</span>  (1793&#150;1829), <span class="occ">naval officer and settler in Natal</span>, was born in Wincanton, Somerset, the second son of Samuel Farewell (<i>d</i>. 1801), rector of Wincanton. After his father's death the family moved to Tiverton, where he was educated at Blundell's School from 1802 until 1807. He joined the frigate <i>Amphion</i> as a midshipman, commanded by Sir William Hoste, and was promoted lieutenant in February 1815. Following the end of the war with France he was put on half pay and travelled to India from where he intended to trade with the newly established British Cape Colony and other British East India Company ports. He became manager and owner of the <i>Frances Charlotte</i>, registered in Bengal. On 17 August 1822 he married Elizabeth Catherina Schmidt, a resident of Algoa Bay.<br>
<br>Through his wife and other contacts at the Cape, Farewell gained the idea of an expedition to the Natal coast and interior to obtain ivory for trading. In early 1823 an official British expedition under the command of William Fitzwilliam Owen travelled to Delagoa Bay with instructions to survey the coastal region of Natal; Owen's vessels the <i>Leven</i>, the <i>Barracouta</i>, and the <i>Cockburn</i> were joined in this by the <i>Jane</i>, owned by the Cape trader Henry Nourse. However, the British government was not prepared to sponsor any further official survey trips and on his own account Farewell, with the backing of the merchant John R. Thomson, hired the sloop <i>Julia</i> from James Gosling, a trader in the Stellenbosch district.<br>
<br>In 1823 Farewell decided to investigate the ivory trading possibilities at Port Natal rather than Delagoa Bay, and it was with this project in mind that he included in his party as supercargo, Henry Francis Fynn, who had formerly been employed by Nourse. Fynn together with a small party of five people left Cape Town in May 1824 in the <i>Julia</i>. Farewell's main trading party included John Cane, a former sailor who had come to the Cape in 1813 in the hope of finding employment, as well as Farewell's father-in-law, Schmidt: this party left Cape Town in the <i>Antelope</i> in July 1824.<br>
<br>Having arrived at Port Natal, Farewell was quick to portray himself as negotiating with the person whom he perceived as the main indigenous authority, Shaka ka Senzangakhona, and wrote back to the Cape authorities in August 1824 pointing out that Shaka had given him a land grant at Port Natal for 35 miles along the coast, as well as hunting rights which extended 100 miles into the interior. Farewell's dispatches, which reached the Cape in September 1824, can be seen as the earliest settler writing on Port Natal. Farewell attempted to send the <i>Julia</i> with a cargo of ivory back to Cape Town in December 1824, but the vessel was lost at sea and Farewell's trading party was then isolated at Port Natal. A rival trading party arrived in October 1825 under the command of the former naval officer James Saunders King and including Nathaniel Isaacs and Charles Rawden Maclean, also known as John Ross. The two European groups did not live peacefully at Port Natal and by the time of King's death in 1828 had split up into rival parties with separate small settlements.<br>
<br>In October 1826 Farewell brought his wife to Port Natal and she was the first white woman to reside at the settlement, before returning to Algoa Bay the following year. Farewell made several trips back to the Cape to obtain goods for trade at Port Natal. In 1828 the British admiralty warned Farewell that his alliance with Shaka was unofficial and that European participation as mercenaries against Shaka's rivals was discouraged. It is likely however that both Fynn and Farewell fought for Shaka against the Ndwandwe in 1826 and against Faku's Mpondo in 1828. Farewell was not present at the assassination of Shaka in September 1828 since he was away in the Cape at that time. From 1824 the overland route to the Cape from Port Natal was controlled by Fynn but Farewell decided to use this route while returning from Uitenhage. Farewell, an unknown European, and five mixed-race employees were killed in September 1829 when their party was attacked at Pondoland, near the Umzimvubu River, by the Qwabe under the leadership of Nqetho. Farewell was later commemorated as one of the founders of the permanent European settlement at Durban (as Port Natal was renamed in 1835).<br>
