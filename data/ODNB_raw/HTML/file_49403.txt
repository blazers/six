<span class="headword">Mitchell,  John Murray</span>  (1815&#150;1904), <span class="occ">missionary and orientalist</span>, was born in Aberdeen on 19 August 1815, the fourth of five sons and three daughters of James Mitchell, burgess of Aberdeen, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gordon. His brothers James (1808&#150;1884), Gordon (1809&#150;1893), and Alexander (1822&#150;1901) also became ministers of the Church of Scotland. He was educated at the parish school of Kinneff, Kincardineshire, and entered Aberdeen grammar school for a final year before going on to Marischal College, Aberdeen, in 1829; he secured the second highest bursary on the strength of his Latin prose. On the completion of his MA in 1833 he began to study for the ministry, first at Aberdeen and then for the 1837&#150;8 session at Edinburgh, where he gained a gold medal offered by Professor Welsh for the best essay on Eusebius. He also returned for a time to Aberdeen grammar school as a teacher at the request of the rector, the Latin scholar James Melvin.<br>
<br>Much influenced by Alexander Duff, Murray Mitchell would gladly have joined Duff in Calcutta but, after being ordained in Aberdeen in July 1838, he was sent instead to Bombay, where he joined fellow missionaries John Wilson and Robert Nesbit in November of that year. His facility with languages enabled him quickly to master Marathi and he also studied Sanskrit and Zend. He was greatly interested in Marathi literature and in particular the poet Tukaram. At the end of 1842 he was joined by his fianc&eacute;e <a href="#cosubject_49403">Maria Hay Mackenzie Flyter [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and they were married in Bombay on 22 December. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>On the Disruption of the Church of Scotland in 1843 Murray Mitchell was one of the many missionaries who opted to join the Free Church of Scotland. In 1844 he accompanied Stephen Hislop on the long and arduous journey to Nagpur in order to establish a new mission station there. He made frequent tours in inland districts, usually in the cool season, and often spoke to his audiences in Marathi from the back of his pony. His wife's illness prompted a return to Scotland and he addressed the church general assembly in 1846, before returning to India alone at the end of the year. His wife did not rejoin him until October 1849 and her health was to remain a source of concern. In 1854 he moved to Poona to relieve another missionary, James Mitchell, and he remained there until Mitchell's return in 1856. His wife's health again took her back to Europe and Murray Mitchell followed in January 1857. He was thus away from India during the time of the mutiny and did not return until November 1859. While in Scotland he was awarded an LLD degree from Marischal College, in December 1858. On his return to India he once again deputized at Poona for James Mitchell until the latter was restored to health. His wife left India in October 1862 and he finally followed from Bombay in April 1863.<br>
<br>From 1863 to 1867 Murray Mitchell ministered to a Free Church congregation at Broughty Ferry, near Dundee. A crisis in the mission at Calcutta led to his leaving this charge and going out to Bengal in January 1868, where he became principal of Duff College. During his time there he was instrumental in setting up a European congregation, the Simla Union Church, and he also assisted Andrew Campbell in establishing a mission among the Santals, reflecting his interest in aboriginal peoples. In 1873 he returned to Scotland and acted as secretary of his church's foreign mission committee. In 1880, as part of a wider tour, he returned to India for a further two years. He reached his ministerial jubilee in 1888, and thereafter undertook a further ten years in the service of the Scotch Church at Nice in France, thus achieving the unusual distinction of serving his church at home, in the mission field, and on the continent. As the oldest minister of the Free Church, it fell to him to move the adoption of the <span class="roman">Uniting Act</span> of 1900 which brought about the union of the Free Church of Scotland with the United Presbyterian church. In spite of his advancing years he gave the Duff lectures in 1903, published posthumously as <span class="italic">The Great Religions of India</span> (1905). He died, at his home, 44 Heriot Row, Edinburgh on 14 November 1904 and was buried there, in the Dean cemetery, four days later.<br>
<br>Murray Mitchell was thoughtful, scholarly, gentle, and guileless, with a gift for languages and exposition which fitted him for his long missionary career. His <span class="italic">Letters to Indian Youth</span> passed through many editions, and he published a <span class="italic">Memoir</span> (1858) of his missionary colleague Robert Nesbit. His other works included <span class="italic">Hinduism, Past and Present</span> (1885), as well as a partial autobiography, <span class="italic">In Western India</span> (1899).<br>
<br>His wife, <a name="cosubject_49403"></a><span class="headword">Maria Hay Mackenzie Mitchell <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Flyter]</span></span>  (1820&#150;1907)<span class="occ"></span>, was born on 5 December 1820, daughter of Alexander Flyter (1782&#150;1866), minister of Alness in Ross-shire, and his wife, Elizabeth Bayne (<i>d</i>. 1863). She was naturally obliged to share her husband's calling to an unusual degree but their marriage was recognized as being a true missionary partnership. Repeated and serious ill health did not deter her and she set down her own and their shared experiences in <span class="italic">A Missionary's Wife among the Wild Tribes of South Bengal</span> (1871); <span class="italic">In India</span> (1876); <span class="italic">In Southern India</span> (1885); and <span class="italic">Sixty Years Ago</span> (1905). She died on 31 March 1907.<br>
