<span class="headword">Morgan,  Walter Thomas James</span>  (1900&#150;2003), <span class="occ">biochemist</span>, was born on 5 October 1900 at 28 Windsor Road, Ilford, Essex, the second child of Walter Morgan, a solicitor's clerk at the Royal Courts of Justice, and his wife, Annie Edith, <i>n&eacute;e</i> James. He attended the local primary school until the family moved to Little Ilford and he then went to Raine's Foundation School in Whitechapel. There he developed an interest in mechanical engineering, and isometric drawings became his hobby. He left school in 1916 and took a junior technician post with a gas company, where he learned analytical methods for coal tar products. He then moved to a government factory in Greenwich that was producing synthetic phenol. In 1918 he volunteered for the Royal Navy and was posted to a shore-based research and manufacturing station in east London, but his tasks were menial and he became a stoker on a steam-powered truck.<br>
<br>Morgan's father died in the influenza pandemic in 1918 leaving his mother in precarious financial straits, but he got a government grant for a degree course in chemistry at the East London College. At the London Hospital medical school he learned about the synthetic and degradation pathways of the known organic compounds. To help with the family finances he took a job with a gas company and was asked to find the means to produce gas more efficiently from coal than the method then in use. This he succeeded in doing. The discovery of insulin in 1922 encouraged him to aim for a higher qualification and he worked in the evenings at West Ham Municipal College on the amino acid composition of proteins. After his examination for the MSc one of the examiners, Professor Arthur Harden, wrote suggesting he apply for a studentship at the Lister Institute. He was successful in obtaining a Grocers' Company scholarship, and began work at the institute. His first task was to establish the structure of hexose diphosphonate, and his study of the phosphoric esters was the subject of his PhD thesis in 1927. At Harden's suggestion he then attended a practical course on the microanalysis of organic substances at the University of Graz, as a Beit memorial medical research fellow. In 1928 he was appointed biochemist at the Lister serum and vaccine department at Elstree, where he took up immunology and problems in the production and testing of antisera and bacterial toxins. Over the next ten years he prepared bacterial antigens that were far more suitable for use than the crude preparations used hitherto. On 25 April 1930 he married Dorothy Irene Price (1900/01&#150;1993), also from Little Ilford. She was the daughter of Harold James Price, upholsterer. They had two daughters and one son.<br>
<br>In 1937 Morgan obtained a Rockefeller research fellowship to study with Professor Tadeusz Reichstein in Zurich. When he returned to the Lister Institute in 1938 he became reader in biochemistry. The outbreak of the Second World War and fears about the dangers of large-scale bacterial cultures in a bomb-threatened city combined with the introduction of the sulphonamides and penicillin to alter his career. Casualties and antibody antigen reactions with incompatible blood transfusions made him think that his experience with bacterial antigens could be usefully applied. Although it was forty years after the ABO blood groups had been established, little was known about their chemical structure. Morgan realized the need to use samples from individual human subjects and the finding, with Ruth van Heyningen, that ovarian cyst fluid was a source of secreted blood group substances was an important breakthrough. By the early 1950s, working with a series of colleagues (notably <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/94805/', "Winifred Watkins")</script>, who joined him in 1942), Morgan had obtained purified preparations of A, B, H, and Lewis blood-group substances and identified them as carbohydrate&#150;amino acid complexes. The complete sequences of the A and B substances were characterized by 1965 and those of the related blood group substances followed. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1949 and served as vice-president of the society from 1961 to 1964, having become professor of biochemistry in 1951 and deputy director of the Lister Institute the following year. He was a member of the Scientific Advisory Council from 1956 to 1960 and of the Medical Research Council from 1966 to 1970.<br>
<br>Morgan retired as head of the biochemistry department in 1968 and stayed on as a guest worker but was appointed director of the Lister Institute in 1972 when its financial status was insecure. In 1975 he had the sad duty of seeing its closure. Winifred Watkins moved to the clinical research centre at Northwick Park Hospital and Morgan joined her as a guest worker until her retirement in 1989. He continued to work at the bench on blood group substances until he was eighty-nine and remained an active participant at scientific meetings until he was ninety-seven. He received numerous honours and awards in the UK and abroad including the royal medal of the Royal Society (1968), the Landsteiner award of the American Association of Blood Banks (1967), and honorary fellowship of the Royal College of Physicians (1982). He had been appointed CBE in 1959. He remained alert and interested in scientific matters until his death from bronchopneumonia at Woodlands Nursing Home, 38 Smitham Bottom Lane, Purley, Surrey, on 10 February 2003. He was survived by his three children. Among colleagues he was renowned for his meticulous standards and his demands for rigorous scientific proof. He made many lifelong friendships, and all who worked with him admired his modesty and generosity, as well as the originality that made him an outstanding pioneer in the field of immunochemistry.<br>
