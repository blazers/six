<span class="headword">Andrade,  Edward Neville da Costa</span>  (1887&#150;1971), <span class="occ">physicist</span>, was born on 27 December 1887, in London, the second child in the family of four sons and one daughter of Henry da Costa Andrade, solicitor, and his wife, Amy Eliza Davis. In 1897 he went to St Dunstan's College, Catford, where he was strongly encouraged by his headmaster, C. M. Stuart, who had been a research scientist. In 1905 he won a scholarship to study physics under F. T. Trouton at University College, London, where he gained first-class honours in physics in 1907. He stayed on to do research on the flow of solid metals under stress, a subject which remained a lifelong interest. His first paper, entitled &#145;The viscous flow in metals, and allied phenomena&#146;, published in the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Society</span> in 1910, was a landmark in the science of the mechanical properties of solids.<br>
<br>An 1851 Exhibition scholarship took Andrade to Heidelberg in 1910, to work under Philipp Lenard and Carl Ramsauer on the electrical properties of flames. That year in Germany was a supremely happy time for him, where in the light-hearted company of Ramsauer and other friends, Andrade enjoyed the coffee-shops and inns and weekends in the countryside, as well as very active science. He took his PhD at Heidelberg in 1911 and returned to England. In 1913 he went to Manchester to study under Ernest Rutherford. There he began work on the measurement of the wavelength of gamma rays from radium, but on the outbreak of war in 1914 left to become an officer in the Royal Garrison Artillery; he eventually became a captain. He served in France in 1915&#150;17 and was mentioned in dispatches, and from 1917 worked in munitions. In 1917 he married Katherine Barbara, daughter of Thomas T. Evans, a tea merchant in Manchester; they had two sons, Trevor John, who became a group captain in the RAF, and Edward Anthony, who became a doctor of medicine but died in a car accident in 1967.<br>
<br>At the end of the war Andrade was awarded a DSc of London University. In 1920, on Rutherford's recommendation, he became professor of physics at the Ordnance College, Woolwich (later the Military College of Science). Eight years later he became Quain professor of physics at University College, London and the central period of his scientific life began, during which he built up and sustained for many years an outstanding research school in the physics of solids and liquids, which produced many classic papers on the growth and plastic glide of metal single crystals, on the origin of cracks in glass, and on the viscosity of liquids. Among his many students were Francis Crick and Leonard Rotherham. In 1923 Andrade published <span class="italic">The Structure of the Atom</span>, which ran to several editions. He was elected into the fellowship of the Royal Society in 1935.<br>
<br>In 1936 Andrade's first marriage broke up and in 1938 he married (Kathleen) Mona, daughter of W. D. Martin and widow of Clennell Anstruther Wilkinson, the biographer and great friend of Andrade, who had died in 1936. Andrade had strong literary interests which brought him into contact with T. S. Eliot, W. Somerset Maugham, and Walter de la Mare. He wrote and published poetry, and began a second major career as a historian of science, especially of the work of Robert Hooke, and as a collector of historic scientific books.<br>
<br>Much of Andrade's time in the Second World War was taken up with work for the Ministry of Supply, where he became known as an &#145;inverted Micawber&#146;&#151;waiting for something to turn down&#151;in the face of all the odd inventions that were then flooding into the ministry for his attention. But he also found time to appear on the BBC's <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/57624', "The Brains Trust")</script>, with C. E. M. Joad and Commander A. B. Campbell, which he greatly enjoyed. After the war Andrade returned at first to his position at University College, but then, in 1950, accepted a directorship in the Royal Institution. This was an unfortunate appointment for him and a series of bitter disputes led him to resign in 1952.<br>
<br>Subsequent to his resignation Andrade returned to his researches on the flow of metals, working from 1957 as a senior research fellow at Imperial College, where he continued at full pace. Even in the weeks immediately before his death he was busy drafting a paper for the Royal Society describing his latest results. The flow of matter remained his major lifelong scientific interest and he produced some remarkable mathematical expressions which represent these processes much as Hooke's law represents elastic deformation. The discovery of these mathematical equations of viscosity and creep must have been a great satisfaction to him, not least because Robert Hooke was the admired hero in Andrade's own memorable Wilkins lecture, given before the Royal Society in 1949.<br>
<br>Known as Percy to many in the scientific world, Andrade was of smallish build, very neat, and always impeccably dressed in a fairly formal style. He enjoyed dinner parties, provided that the wines were excellent, and was a most witty, occasionally sharp-tongued, conversationalist.<br>
<br>Andrade received an honorary LLD from Edinburgh (1950) and honorary degrees of DSc from Durham (1952) and Manchester (1956). He was a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur. From 1943 to 1945 he was president of the Physical Society. He was the editor for physics for the fourteenth edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> and from 1945 to 1952 was science correspondent of <span class="italic">The Times</span>.<br>
<br>Andrade died in a nursing home in London on 6 June 1971.<br>
