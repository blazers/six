<span class="headword">Marriott,  William <span class="st"> [John, Ben]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> 1653), <span class="occ">reputed gourmand and lawyer</span>, was the son of John Marriott of Ashton, Northamptonshire. He is known variously as John (the name given him in the pamphlets which made him notorious) and Ben (the name under which he appears in the anecdotes retailed in Will Oldys's commonplace book in 1718). But it was as William Marriott, gentleman, that he was admitted to Gray's Inn on 3 August 1605. He was called to the bar there six years later, on 8 November 1611, and at the time of his death in 1653 was its eldest member.<br>
<br>Marriott was thrust into the public limelight in 1652 with the publication of a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">The great eater of Graye's Inn, or, The life of Mr. Marriot the cormorant, wherein is set forth all the exploits and actions by him performed, with many pleasant stories of his travells into Kent and other places</span>. The author was listed only as &#145;G. F., gent.&#146;, but is now generally accepted to be George Fidge, writer of many titillating pamphlets. The forty-page work is highly entertaining and wholly libellous. Grotesque accounts of how Marriott devoured a meal for twenty men, voided a worm, and consumed dogs and monkeys baked in pies are all colourfully related. Outlandish recipes, claiming to be Marriott's own, form the latter section of the pamphlet. These recipes were reprinted separately in the same year under the title <span class="italic">The English Mountebank, or, A Physical Dispensatory</span>. Its purported author was J. Marriott himself. These, and the charge that Marriott knew &#145;better how to handle a chin of beef than a cause&#146;, provoked his friends to rise to his defence. <span class="italic">A letter to Mr. Marriot from a friend of his, wherein his name is redeemed from that detraction G. F., gent., hath endeavoured to fasten upon him by a scandalous and defamatory libel</span> was published &#145;for the friends of Mr. Marriott&#146; in 1652. It deplored the &#145;libel of lies, scandal and defamation&#146; of the previous works, and lauded Marriott as the &#145;most ancient&#146; member of Gray's Inn whose forty-seven years' experience, abilities, and knowledge of the law were widely reputed.<br>
<br>This rebuttal was not sufficient to save Marriott's name from infamy. Charles Cotton's <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span> (1689) include two on Marriott, entitled &#145;The Greater Eater of Gray's Inn&#146; and &#145;On Marriott&#146;. Both revile the man and celebrate his death. Recording further Marriott lore, Oldys relates in his commonplace book how the infant Marriott &#145;sucked his Mother and a half dozen Nurses Dry&#146; and how, at the age of fifteen, he &#145;could Master a Turkey at a Meal&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 4245, fol. 97<i>r</i>). Such tales made Marriott's name synonymous with gluttony, and John Dunton mentioned in his <span class="italic">Life and Errors</span> (1705) how the brisk New England air made him eat &#145;like a second Marriott&#146;  (Dunton, 90). The motivation for Fidge's original attack on Marriott is lost, though it is possible that he had either pecuniary gain or revenge for some ill deed in mind. There is little to suggest that the tales of Marriott had any foundation in fact. In spite of this, the pamphlet endured and was reprinted in a limited edition in 1871 &#145;for subscribers only&#146;. Marriott's burial in London on 25 November 1653 is recorded in Richard Smyth's <span class="italic">Obituary</span>. He died unmarried and, according to George Fidge, penniless.<br>
