<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Laurie,  (Robert) Douglas</span>  (1874&#150;1953), <span class="occ">founder and first president of the Association of University Teachers</span>, was born at 10 Laurel Road, Tranmere, Cheshire, on 27 October 1874, the only son of Robert Laurie, a bookkeeper, and his wife, Eleanor (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Ord). He was educated at Birkenhead School and subsequently took a job at the Bank of Liverpool, where he remained until 1899. What prompted him to resume his studies is unknown; however, in 1899 Laurie left his job and enrolled as a student at University College, Liverpool. In 1901, at the comparatively late age of twenty-six, he matriculated at Oxford University, where he was an exhibitioner of Merton College, obtaining third-class honours in zoology. After taking his degree in 1905 he was appointed assistant demonstrator in the department of comparative anatomy at Oxford. In 1906 he became demonstrator and assistant lecturer in zoology at the University of Liverpool, where he remained until 1918; from 1911 onwards he was also lecturer in embryology and genetics. On 9 July 1912 in Wythburn, Cumberland, he married Elinor Beatrice, daughter of George Ord, architect, of Durham; they had one daughter.<br>
<br>In 1909 Laurie and a fellow zoologist called a meeting of junior academic staff at Liverpool with the idea of forming an association. Laurie remarked that junior staff seldom had an opportunity to meet their counterparts from other departments, that, in fact, they were less well organized than the students. Originally conceived as a dining club, the association, like others forming at the other civic universities, soon turned its attention to the question of lecturers' pay. During the First World War the issue acquired great urgency as wartime inflation eroded already inadequate salaries. In 1917 Laurie, in his capacity as secretary of the junior staff association, called a meeting and, as an afterthought, invited representatives of other universities to come and help draft a memorandum to the Board of Education. These meetings, coupled with the refusal of H. A. L. Fisher, president of the board, to meet with junior staff, promoted unity among the university organizations and provided an opportunity for Laurie to demonstrate those powers of persuasion and tenacity for which he became legendary. In his role as chairman of the conference of university lecturers, Laurie compiled a detailed survey of the existing remuneration of university lecturers which he submitted to the Board of Education. Meanwhile, increasing dissatisfaction with the newly created pension scheme for university teachers added fuel to a move within the conference to include professors in its membership. In June 1919 the Association of University Teachers (AUT) was created with Laurie as its first president. Although he served for only a year, Laurie continued to run the AUT virtually single-handed as its honorary general secretary from 1920 to his death in 1953.<br>
<br>In 1918 Laurie moved to the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, initially as an independent lecturer and head of department in zoology. In his first year the able and energetic Laurie impressed his superiors as deserving of a professorship, although he had to wait until 1922, when a private donation made possible the creation of his chair in zoology. The principal remarked that Laurie was: &#145;a man who knows what he wants and usually gets it&#146;  (Ellis, 220). In 1919 Laurie annexed space for his inadequately housed department in buildings recently acquired by the college which had formerly housed a slate works. In the absence of funding to make the structure usable Laurie, his staff, and students set out to remodel the buildings themselves, a task to which they evidently brought more enthusiasm than skill. By 1929 the college capitulated and agreed to finish the job. &#145;A thing of beauty it is not&#146;, wrote the principal, &#145;but as a triumph of enthusiasm over mere finance it merits great respect&#146;  (Ellis, 220).<br>
<br>A man of formidable energy, Laurie was greatly respected both for his enthusiasm as a teacher and for his contributions to his own field. A former student remembered him as a friend who was always willing to help students and to find graduates posts most suited to their skills. She wrote that &#145;he was a keen field naturalist and some of us recall delightful days spent with him exploring the polluted waters of some of the north Cardiganshire rivers&#146;  (Newton, <span class="italic">Universities Review</span>, 36). His research interests included a study of the fauna of the sea floor of Cardigan Bay, collected using an apparatus known as the &#145;Petersen grab&#146; which was worked from a motor boat. As a zoologist Laurie was interested in the application of science to social problems, he promoted the teaching of zoology in schools, and he taught summer courses in biology for teachers. He was an enthusiastic member of the Eugenics Society and vice-president of the Universities' Federation for Animal Welfare. From 1921 to 1923 he served as recorder of the zoology section of the British Association. He travelled widely both as a zoologist and as a representative of the AUT.<br>
<br>In the inter-war period Laurie continued to serve the AUT, visiting universities abroad and participating in delegations to the government protesting against the recurrent grant cuts which bedevilled the universities in those years. The historian of the AUT points out that Laurie was largely responsible for its development as a professional association rather than as an academic trades union, although pay and pensions formed such a large part of its agenda in the early years. In 1940 Laurie retired from teaching but in 1943 he became honorary secretary of the International Association of University Professors and Lecturers (IAUPL), an interest which gave him &#145;great joy in the later years of his life&#146;  (Newton, <span class="italic">Universities Review</span>, 36). Laurie died in Amsterdam on 7 April 1953 while attending the conference of the IAUPL.<br>
<br>Douglas Laurie has been described as the greatest amateur in an amateur professional body, and certainly the AUT was a personal project of Laurie's throughout his lifetime  (Perkin, 51). It operated out of two rooms of his house in Aberystwyth, Tyn-y-gongl, and was staffed by Laurie and his devoted secretary; only after his death did it take on professional staff. This arrangement worked because Laurie possessed the skills necessary to run it: he coupled utter single-mindedness and tenacity with an appealing, tolerant friendliness that converted potential adversaries into allies, allowing him to rule with no serious challenge to his authority. One historian has called him a &#145;bonny, good-humoured fighter&#146;, an adversary whom no one could dislike  (Ellis, 220). Laurie's modesty was such that he effaced himself from his own history of the AUT but he will be remembered as the association's single founder.<br>
