<span class="headword">Powys, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1649&#150;1719), <span class="occ">judge and politician</span>, was born at Lilford, Northamptonshire, the second son of Thomas Powys, serjeant-at-law, of Henley, Shropshire, and Anne (<i>c</i>.1622&#150;1655), daughter of Sir Adam Littleton, chief justice of north Wales, and younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22678/', "Sir Littleton Powys")</script>. He was educated at Shrewsbury School, matriculated at Queen's College, Oxford, on 20 May 1664, and was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 19 February 1666. He was called to the bar on 24 April 1673, elected a bencher of his inn on 27 April 1686, and served as treasurer during 1687, the year in which he was appointed attorney-general to James II. He had been appointed solicitor-general and knighted on 23 April 1686. He was created serjeant-at-law in 1702 and held the office of queen's serjeant from 1702 to 1713. In 1710 he wrote to Robert Harley expressing his desire to be appointed attorney-general if Sir Simon Harcourt should be appointed lord chancellor. In recommending himself to his patron, Powys told Harley that the office was a &#145;place [he] could make easy, by wholly applying [himself] to the execution of [the] office&#146;  (Powys to Harley, 16 Oct 1710, <span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 4.614&#150;15). Powys never became a law officer under Queen Anne but on 8 June 1713 he was appointed a judge of the queen's bench, an office he held only until George I's accession, being removed on 14 October 1714 on Lord Chancellor Cowper's advice. However, a series of letters of appeal to the lord chancellor led to his appointment as king's serjeant on 28 October 1714  (Powys to Cowper, 21, 23, and 25 Oct 1714, Panshanger MSS, D/EP F149/12&#150;16). The reason for his removal from the bench seems to have been that he had held the office of attorney-general to James II until the abdication and during that period had been &#145;zealously instrumental in most of the steps which ruined that prince and brought &hellip; great dangers on the kingdom&#146;. From 1717 he held the office of prime serjeant. He became a freeman of Ludlow in 1677 and of Portsmouth in 1700. He was appointed recorder of Ludlow in 1707.<br>
<br>During the reign of James II Powys was active in promoting the king's policies, a role which may justify Burnet's writing of him as &#145;a compliant young aspiring lawyer&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 3.97). He appeared for the crown in <i>Godden v. Hales</i>, a test case in which the king sought to establish the legality of the dispensing power. In this instance Sir Edward Hales, a Roman Catholic officer, was prosecuted for holding office contrary to law but invoked in his defence the king's dispensing power. As an officer of his inn, Powys encouraged his fellow benchers in sponsoring the call of Roman Catholics to the bar. As attorney-general he prosecuted in June 1688 for seditious libel the seven bishops who, on the ground that it was an exercise of the disputed dispensing power, had opposed the reading in churches of the declaration of indulgence extending religious toleration to dissenters. The unpopularity of the proceedings and the acquittal of the defendants were no reflection upon Powys, for he was said to have &#145;acted his part in this trial as fairly as his post could admit of&#146;  (ibid., 3.234). Powys's practice at the bar mirrored the loyalty he had displayed towards James II. During the reign of William III he built up his practice by defending state prisoners, among them Sir John Fenwick, the author of the Jacobite plot of 1696, and his practice developed such that in the last years of Queen Anne's reign Powys's fees were said to amount to nearly &pound;4000 a year. That sum was augmented by investment in the financial markets when he held no legal office.<br>
<br>Powys stood for parliament for the first time in January 1701 and was returned at the top of the poll as member for Ludlow after a three-cornered contest with two tories, one of whom had questioned his loyalty to the government. He was nominated for Truro at the general election of 1702 as his fate in his native Shropshire seemed uncertain  (BL, Add. MS 28055, fols. 3&#150;4). He was, however, returned at both Truro and Ludlow but chose to serve for the latter. Powys's prominence and his legal ability were reflected in his activities in parliament so that many of his numerous committee appointments were to committees of address and to drafting committees. Powys supported the ministry after its reorganization in 1704, was listed as a placeman in 1705, and was re-elected in that year for Ludlow. His attitude to the speakership vote on 25 October 1705 was neutral such that he would vote neither for the court candidate nor for the tory, withdrawing from the house before the question was put. On the resignation of Harley and his supporters in February 1708, Powys reverted to opposition and spoke on 9 March against the bishop of Carlisle's <span class="roman">Cathedrals Bill</span>, which was widely regarded as a party cause. Powys's restoration to the rank of king's serjeant in 1714 marked the end of his parliamentary career as he returned to his practice at the bar and did not stand again.<br>
<br>Historians have disagreed sharply about Powys. Macaulay, in a passage in which his whig sympathies are all too apparent, describes him as &#145;an obscure barrister, who had no qualification for high employment except servility&#146;  (Macaulay, 2.736), a judgement not qualified by Burnet's comment on his lack of ill nature  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 3.97). A modern historian on the other hand speaks of him as &#145;[a barrister] in the very highest flight&#146;  (Holmes, <span class="italic">Augustan England</span>, 125). Less contrasting are the estimates of Powys's abilities supplied by two of his near-contemporaries. Arthur Onslow as a young man heard Powys when in December 1711 he appeared as counsel with Serjeant Pratt for the duke of Hamilton in the House of Lords. Powys and Pratt were instructed by Hamilton to advance the legal argument which preceded the debate on whether the English title of duke of Brandon conferred on him by the queen in September 1711 entitled him to sit in the House of Lords: the vote went against the duke but Onslow recorded that Powys's speech &#145;was deemed a great performance. He exerted all his strength and left very little for Pratt to say although one of the most able advocates of that time&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 6.86n.). Peter Wentworth was less impressed, saying that &#145;they both [Powys and Pratt] seem'd as if they lay under difficulty, that they had no lawyers to answer, but was to suppose what objections were to be made&#146;  (Cartwright, 226&#150;7). That observation may perhaps have been more a comment upon the constraints under which counsel were labouring than an estimate of their oratorical powers.<br>
<br>Powys married twice: on 4 June 1685 he married Sarah, daughter of Ambrose Holbech of Mollington, Warwickshire, who died in March 1694; on 2 October 1698 he married Elizabeth, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18479/', "Sir Philip Meadows")</script>, of Chattisham, Suffolk. He had three sons and three daughters with his first wife and two sons with his second. He died on 3 or 4 April 1719 and was buried at Lilford. His tomb, which bears an effigy in robes and an inscription by Matthew Prior, was moved to St John Baptist Church, Thorpe Achurch, also in Northamptonshire, in 1778.<br>
