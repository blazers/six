<span class="headword">Culpeper, Sir  Cheney</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1601, <em>d.</em> 1663), <span class="occ">advocate of political reform and technological innovation</span>, was born into a respectable family whose seat was at Greenway Court, Hollingbourne, Kent, and baptized at All Saints, Hollingbourne, on 15 April 1601. He was the elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6883/', "Sir Thomas Culpeper (1577/8&#150;1662)")</script> and Elizabeth Cheney (1582&#150;1638). He followed his father to Hart Hall, Oxford, where he matriculated on 6 November 1618 and graduated BA on 7 February 1620, and thereafter, a year later, to the Middle Temple. He left chambers on 10 February 1625 and was knighted by Charles I at Farnham on 8 September 1628. The following year he was sent to Elizabeth of Bohemia at The Hague with the official letter of condolence on the death of her eldest son. He probably remained there until 1631 when he became a gentleman in her service. He may well have been among the young men at the Middle Temple a decade earlier who, to James I's annoyance, swore an oath to live and die in the service of the winter queen when Habsburg forces invaded the Palatinate.<br>
<br>On 24 October 1632 Culpeper married Elizabeth Stede, the granddaughter of William Stede of Harrietsham, Kent, half-brother to his uncle; the couple had five children. At the time of the marriage his father settled the recently purchased house and estate at Leeds Castle on the couple. Cheney's own estimate that he was worth about &pound;500 per annum at about this time is entirely plausible, but from 1641 onwards unexpected events radically reshaped his life. At some point that year he became gravely ill and was not expected to live, and he assigned the control of his estates to his father. He recovered from his illness, but, in the winter of 1641&#150;2, just as his father's royalism was reinforced by the appointment of his son-in-law and distant kinsman, Sir John Colepeper, as Charles I's chancellor of the exchequer and privy councillor, Sir Cheney's support for the Long Parliament became more pronounced and so Sir Thomas refused to relinquish the estates to his son. Thereafter Culpeper tried to recover his property, sequestered because of his father's royalism. He had to fend off family creditors and sue for relief from parliamentary forced loans, levied from him on the basis of estates which he did not possess and whose revenues he did not enjoy. After the civil war he mortgaged his way out of his immediate difficulties, but his financial stability was compromised and his insecure legal title to his properties was exploited by his brother-in-law. Culpeper eventually surrendered his claims to the Leeds Castle estate and died intestate with debts in London; he was buried at the entrance to the north aisle of the Middle Temple Church on 2 April 1663. His widow was still alive in 1674, when her will was drawn up.<br>
<br>The year 1641 was also fundamental in another respect. Culpeper read by chance the published text of John Gawden's fast sermon, preached before the Long Parliament on Sunday 29 November 1640 on <span class="roman">Zechariah</span> 8: 19 (&#145;I will turn your fasts into feasts; therefore love the truth and peace&#146;). It contained an enthusiastic endorsement of the singular promoter of educational change, scientific advancement, and social welfare, Samuel Hartlib, and commended the endeavours of the Moravian educationist Jan Amos Comenius (Komensk&yacute;). According to Hartlib's diary he met Culpeper for the first time on 3 April 1641, the latter contributing the first of many regular payments to support him. Culpeper's surviving correspondence among Hartlib's papers documents his reactions to, and engagement with, Hartlib's diverse plans for a fundamental reformation of state and society  (&#145;Letters&#146;, ed. Braddick).<br>
<br>Culpeper emerges from this correspondence as an intriguing virtuoso with a fascination for technical change. During the civil war he experimented with leathern guns and supported the development of Edmund Felton's &#145;engine&#146; (a form of tank). He was interested in pump technology and new mechanica and used convertible husbandry on his Romney Marsh estate, introduced clover, and concentrated on improved methods of sowing corn by means of a mechanical seed drill as well as exploring the possibilities for a mechanical thresher. He described himself as one of those &#145;whose spirit God hathe raysed out of this mudde of custom&#146; and who must deploy his &#145;talents towards others&#146;  (&#145;Letters&#146;, ed. Braddick, 287). He had carefully considered notions for reforming the patents system to allow the wider distribution of innovations and served as one of the fifteen commissioners for the advancing and regulating of trade established by the Rump in August 1650. As his comments on a proposed &#145;bank of lands&#146;, published by Samuel Hartlib as <span class="italic">An Essay upon Master W. Potters Designe</span> (1653), indicate, Culpeper was well informed on the example for economic prosperity afforded by the Netherlands.<br>
<br>Culpeper had an abiding interest in chemistry, attempted a translation of the first part of Rudolf Glauber's <span class="italic">Furni novi</span>, and adopted the notions of the natural world of Nuysement and Vigen&egrave;re. The purpose of natural philosophy was to discover the &#145;hidden and inwarde motion&#146; represented by the growing forces encouraged by the sun but forever constrained by the grossness in nature. The art of the chemist was to release the latter from the former, without brutalizing nature. He applied these notions in turn to political events, where he emerges as a committed parliamentarian with a radical political agenda. Political instability (&#145;motion&#146;), like chemical change, involved releasing human energies from the &#145;gross matter&#146; of &#145;custome&#146; and the &#145;dark corners of prescription&#146;. Ecclesiastical monopoly, the aristocratic interest, even the tyranny of kings must eventually be cast down in order to release the light of human reason, the way of public good, and the &#145;slow motion towards the happines of a nation whether in religion or liberty&#146;. Culpeper's letters reveal his eschatological excitement in the later 1640s. In March 1647, for example, he wrote:<blockquote>I have still a super confidence that God will finally breake those linsy woolsy packinges up of thinges, which our ecclesiasticall &amp; civill Aristocracies must make for their owne defence, &amp; that the stone (now in full motion) will not ly still till it come to the bottome of the hill. (&#145;Letters&#146;, ed. Braddick, 292&#150;3)</blockquote>Of Culpeper's reactions at the close of the Commonwealth and protectorate very little is known, but it is not surprising to find him among the supporters for Harrington's <span class="italic">Proposition in Order to the Proposing of a Commonwealth or Democracie</span>. Perhaps anticipating the age of Elias Artista (predicted by Paracelsus as occurring in 1658), Culpeper's Good Old Cause was one to be worked for and waited for with patience, and whose time was only just nigh.<br>
