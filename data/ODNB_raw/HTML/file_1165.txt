<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Baldwin,  George</span>  (1744&#150;1826), <span class="occ">diplomatist and writer</span>, son of William Baldwin, hop merchant, was born, in the Borough, near London, in May 1744 according to his own account, though others give 1743 as the date. In 1760 he went to Cyprus (where his brother was consul) and in 1763 to Acre. Increasingly aware of the political structure and commercial potential of the area, he returned to England in 1768 to obtain leave to explore possible connections between India and Egypt by way of the Red Sea, a route in theory blocked to non-Muslims to protect the holy cities and trade through Jiddah but in fact open to them provided enough profit accrued to the beys. Baldwin returned to Cyprus to settle his late brother's affairs and acted as consul there. In 1773, in Cairo, Mehemed Bey promised him &#145;if you bring the India ships to Suez, I will lay an aqueduct from the Nile to Suez, and you shall drink of the Nile water&#146;  (Baldwin, <span class="italic">Political Recollections</span>, 3&#150;4). He was favourably received too in Constantinople by Britain's ambassador.<br>
<br>In 1774 Baldwin returned to Cairo with the holy caravan from Mecca, and thence to England. Learning that John Shaw had successfully reached Suez up the Red Sea from Bengal, he offered his services to the East India Company, whose ships were to come up the Red Sea to Suez for trans-shipment. His offer was accepted. Back in Egypt in 1775, as the only English merchant, and a fluent Arabic speaker, he set up commerce with England, and began linking this trade to Suez and India, organizing schedules and quick turnarounds. Between 1776 and 1778, with ships arriving both at Alexandria and Suez, Baldwin reputedly drank prosperity to England with the combined waters of the Nile, Thames, and Ganges atop the pyramid. The success of his business competed with the trade of the Porte and the East India Company's trade around the Cape; the sultan issued a prohibitory firman, and threatened reprisals. In May 1779 a caravan from Suez to Cairo was attacked; some merchants died, others were imprisoned. In July Baldwin became a hostage or &#145;prisoner at large&#146; to secure their release. In November he escaped and reached Izmir. There he married Jane (1763&#150;1839), the strikingly beautiful daughter of his agent, William Maltass.<br>
<br>Baldwin set out for India, hoping to restore his fortunes, but was robbed and wounded and quickly returned. He then set off, with his wife, for Europe in 1780, where she drew much attention from rich and powerful men. In Vienna, the sculptor Cerroschi executed her bust for the emperor, and her full-length portrait was painted for Count Kaunitz, the foreign minister. In London, Joshua Reynolds, William Pyne, and Richard Cosway all painted her. Cosway's portrait entitled <span class="italic">A Grecian Lady</span> (1782) was engraved by Bartolozzi. The Baldwins' marriage was tempestuous and unhappy. She died in 1839 leaving a daughter.<br>
<br>Baldwin was welcomed into London society as an exotic newcomer. He was described by Wright as &#145;lolling on oriental cushions, amid strange hangings&#146;  (T. Wright, <span class="italic">Life of William Blake</span>, 1929, 2.31) and had some interesting pictures to share. Baldwin became intrigued by Cosway's keen interest in the therapeutic powers of magnetism as expounded by John de Mainauduc. Baldwin's presence was noted in William Blake's lines:<blockquote>
<div>Cosway, Frazer and Baldwin of Egypt's lake,<br>
</div>
<div>Fear to associate with Blake,<br>
</div>
<div>This life is a warfare against evils,<br>
</div>
<div>They heal the sick, he [Blake] casts out devils.<br>
</div> (ibid.)</blockquote>Baldwin presented the India board with his <span class="italic">Narrative of Facts Relating to the Plunder of the English Merchants by the Arabs &hellip; in 1779</span> (1780) and at the board's request prepared the memorial &#145;Speculations on the resources of Egypt&#146; (written between 1773 and 1785 but published in 1801 in his <span class="italic">Political Recollections</span>), in which he pointed to Egypt's pivotal position and trading potential (&#145;She is the resort of all traders of the world&#146;), and the instability of the government. He advised that, with no English presence, Mediterranean trade would go to France, and English trade should be supported by political means. Very few senior officials in London, however, found his argument about the strategic importance of Egypt convincing.<br>
<br>In 1785 an envoy signed agreements for safe French transit through Egypt and the Red Sea. To counter-balance this influence, in June 1786 Baldwin was appointed to Egypt as consul-general with a brief to obtain a similar agreement for Britain, to discover &#145;the motions of the French&#146; and keep the English in India advised  (TNA: PRO, FO 78, 24/1). In 1790 he published <span class="italic">A Memorial Relating to the Slave Trade in Egypt</span> at the request of the privy council. In 1792 he sent news to India of the declaration of war on France, enabling British forces to expel the French from Pondicherry. In 1796 another agent came &#145;to inveigle the Beys of Egypt into the designs of the French&#146;, and to obtain consent to pass an army through Egypt to annihilate British dominion in India  (Baldwin, <span class="italic">Political Recollections</span>, 30).<br>
<br>While in Egypt, Baldwin's interest in magnetism continued; he believed the cures effected to be &#145;many and marvellous&#146;. He created a special room in the form of a temple at his consulary mansion at Alexandria. Here, between 1795 and 1797 he held more than fifty sessions with an itinerant Italian poet who sank easily into a &#145;magnetic sleep&#146; and responded in verse. Baldwin collected these responses and published them privately as <span class="italic">Investigation into Principles</span> (1801) and <span class="italic">La prima musa</span> (1802). He also conducted research on the powers of sweet olive oil to combat plague, described in &#145;An essay on the plague&#146;, written in 1791 and published in his <span class="italic">Political Recollections</span> (1801).<br>
<br>In 1793 Britain, dissatisfied with Baldwin's progress with a treaty, abolished his post. The letter dismissing him did not arrive until 1796 and he continued to act as consul-general until that date. In 1794 he agreed a commercial treaty with the beys which acknowledged the right of the British to navigate all ports of the Ottoman empire. In March 1798, ill and disillusioned, he left Cairo. That May Napoleon sailed for Egypt, took Alexandria and marched south, vindicating Baldwin's repeated insistence on the region's strategic importance.<br>
<br>Baldwin moved around war-torn Europe, but after the battle of Marengo in June 1800 left Florence, and eventually reached Naples. There, in December 1800, he was asked to join the British expedition at Malta to advise them on Egypt. He recommended they land on the Red Sea, make a direct assault on Alexandria, or land at Abu Qir. Attached to Admiral Lord Keith, he also advised the military commander, Sir Ralph Abercromby. In his <span class="italic">Political Recollections</span> Baldwin provides eyewitness accounts of the preparations for and landing at Abu Qir on 8 March 1801, and of Abercromby's last hours. He used his local knowledge to set up supplies for the army. By May he was back in London reporting on the invasion.<br>
<br>Baldwin's interest in magnetism was now &#145;cried down&#146; and its supporters &#145;held up to derision&#146;  (Baldwin, <span class="italic">Legacy</span>, xxxix), and he did not publish on the subject again until 1811, when the privately printed <span class="italic">Legacy to his Daughter</span> commented on, among other matters, the present and past state of magnetism as he saw it and repeated his records of the sessions with the Italian poet.<br>
<br>Baldwin died in Earls Court, Brompton, London, on 19 February 1826. His collection of classical cameos and busts, illustrated in his privately printed, undated collection of sixty lithographs (BL), was sold at Christies in London on 8 and 9 May 1828.<br>
