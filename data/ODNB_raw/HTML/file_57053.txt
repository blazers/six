<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Richardson,  Marion Elaine</span>  (1892&#150;1946), <span class="occ">art teacher</span>, was born on 9 October 1892 at 10 Wellesley Villas, Ashford, Kent, the second daughter of six children of Walter Marshall Richardson (1859&#150;<i>c</i>.1907), a master brewer, and his wife, Ellen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dyer (<i>b</i>. 1860). She was educated at Winchester high school, Uplands School, and Milham Ford School in Oxford. Talented at art, she was encouraged to sit for a teacher-training scholarship at Birmingham Municipal School of Arts and Crafts; her father's death meant that the award of a scholarship could not be ignored, despite her reluctance. She studied at Birmingham from 1908 to 1912, obtaining an art class teacher's certificate and participating in the experiments of its principal, Robert Catterson-Smith, in memory drawing.<br>
<br>In 1912 Richardson was appointed art mistress at Dudley Girls' High School, in the Black Country, where she worked full-time until 1923. She developed methods of teaching art that were far removed from the traditional emphasis on copying and technical skill. Instead she aimed to arouse children's visual awareness, to encourage self-expression, and enable pupils to evaluate their own work. Her pupils would sit with closed eyes, perhaps listening to a description, and waited for images to appear in &#145;the mind's eye&#146;. This resulted in vibrant, colourful, and expressive paintings, contrasting starkly with more traditional pencil drawings.<br>
<br>In 1917 Richardson met Roger Fry at his exhibition &#145;Children's art&#146; (Omega Workshops, London) and showed him a portfolio of works by her Dudley pupils. Impressed, Fry included some of them in the exhibition and began to promote her work, bringing her to critical and public attention. Fry thought her &#145;remarkable&#151;she really has found out how to <i>educate</i> and not to teach, which I thought was impossible&#146;  (letter to Margery Fry, 2&#150;3 May 1917, <span class="italic">Letters of Roger Fry</span>, 2, 410), and arranged an interview with the minister of education, H. A. L. Fisher. Through Roger Fry, she also renewed her acquaintance with his sister Margery Fry, and the two remained close friends throughout her life. It was Margery who suggested the then innovative idea of teaching art in prisons and from 1921 to 1923 Richardson voluntarily taught embroidery and crafts at Winson Green prison in Birmingham.<br>
<br>Looking for new challenges, Richardson moved to London in 1923, initially staying with Margery and Roger Fry. She took private pupils and taught voluntarily at Holloway prison. During the winter of 1923&#150;4 she organized an exhibition of her Dudley high school pupils' work at the Independent Gallery in London, which attracted considerable press interest, and in January 1924 the magazine <span class="italic">Vogue</span> nominated her for its hall of fame. Such publicity created an increasing demand for her pupils' work to be exhibited across the country and for her to give lectures to organizations and societies. In the spring of 1924 she travelled to Russia through Sweden and Finland, visiting schools and prisons to study their artwork. In September 1924 she returned to teaching at Dudley Girls' High School part-time and also took up a post with the London Day Training College as lecturer in art on the new course for trainee art teachers. She continued her private teaching and taught part-time at Benenden and Hayes Court schools in Kent.<br>
<br>From 1930 Richardson was inspector of art to the London county council; she also held surgeries for teachers, ran courses for them, visited schools, and gave lectures. Her courses were extremely popular: applications for the forty places on the 1934&#150;5 course &#145;Art in infant schools&#146; were closed when the number exceeded a thousand. In 1934 she toured Canada at the invitation of the Carnegie Trust and also visited the United States, giving lectures for the public, teachers, and university audiences. In 1935 she published <span class="italic">Writing and Writing Patterns</span>, a set of hinged cards and booklets (developed from her <span class="italic">Dudley Writing Cards</span>, 1928) for teaching handwriting based on patterns and natural movements, enabling each child to make a gradual transition to a personal style. In 1938 she organized a large and successful exhibition of children's art at County Hall in London. With works by over 500 children from schools across London it was opened by Kenneth Clark and visited by over 24,000 people including Queen Elizabeth and her two daughters, the princesses Elizabeth and Margaret.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Marion Richardson supervised children evacuated to Oxfordshire. Unfortunately her health was deteriorating; in 1938 she had suffered a nervous breakdown and developed rheumatoid arthritis. She retired due to ill health in 1942. In September 1945 she returned to Dudley, where she completed the manuscript for her long-planned book <span class="italic">Art and the Child</span>. On 12 November 1946, the day after writing the book's dedication, she died of a heart attack, rheumatoid arthritis, and anaemia at 27 Highfield Road, Dudley, Worcestershire, the home of a friend. She was buried in Dudley. She had never married. Her illness was attributed to &#145;her utter devotion to her work&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dudley Herald</span>, 16 Nov 1946).<br>
<br>Published posthumously in 1948, Marion Richardson's <span class="italic">Art and the Child</span> contained a foreword by Kenneth Clark who discerned saintly qualities in the author. Her achievement, Clark wrote, was to recognize that the power of vivid imaginative expression &#145;could be developed in almost every child as part of his education&#146;  (Richardson, 7). Although written during her terminal illness, and often sentimental and inaccurate, the book was a great success, being reprinted in 1951, 1954, 1957, and 1964, and translated into Japanese in 1958. <span class="italic">Writing and Writing Patterns</span> remained in print and in use in schools in the United Kingdom until the 1980s. Her pupils' work was included in the British Council's &#145;Art of British children&#146; exhibitions which toured North and South America, Australia and New Zealand, and southern Africa in the 1940s.<br>
<br>Marion Richardson had pioneered a child-centred approach to the teaching of art in schools and her methods changed both the atmosphere and environment of school art rooms. Her ideas influenced other critics and educational theorists and her publications achieved international acclaim. After her death Herbert Read wrote, &#145;as she moved from school to school, she left oases of happiness and enlightenment, and an enduring influence which has literally transformed the lives of thousand of children&#146;  (<span class="italic">Athene</span>, 1947, 2). In the 1980s the Department of Education and Science funded a series of fellowships enabling teachers to experiment with her ideas in the classroom once again, proving their continuing relevance.<br>
