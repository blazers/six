<span class="headword">Warrington,  William</span>  (1796&#150;1869), <span class="occ">stained-glass artist</span>, was born at New Romney, Kent, the son of William and Sarah Warrington. He was baptized in St Nicholas's Church, New Romney, on 4 March 1796. Little is known of his family background. <span class="italic">The Journal of the British Society of Master Glass-Painters</span> (1961&#150;2, 521) suggests that a William Warrington, described in the <span class="italic">Universal British Directory</span> of 1797 as a glazier, in business in Deptford Green, could be his father. The United Kingdom census returns for 1861 reveal that Warrington's wife was two years his junior, that her name was Elizabeth, and that she was born at Tottenham, Middlesex.<br>
<br>Footnotes in Warrington's <span class="italic">The history of stained glass from the earliest period of the art to the present time illustrated by coloured examples of entire windows in the various styles</span> (1848) record that at one time, Warrington worked for the heraldic artist Thomas Willement, and that in 1833 he restored a medieval window for Mr Pratt in Bond Street&#151;perhaps Samuel Pratt of Samuel Pratt &amp; Son, trunk makers and upholsterers, 47 New Bond Street  (Warrington, 33, 37). The first reference to Warrington in the <span class="italic">Post Office London Directory</span> (1839), was as an &#145;Artist in Stained Glass, Heraldic and Decorative Painter, Plumber, Glazier and Paperhanger&#146;  (Harrison, 84). His first major work was, however, earlier. In 1837, he made the apse window for St Mary's College chapel, Oscott, near Birmingham, working under the direction of A. W. N. Pugin, who was then starting to revive the medieval principles of stained-glass design. The window exhibits these principles to a high degree, although, unusually for Pugin, it was in the sixteenth-century style, with pictorial elements. It was very well received. A contemporary noted that it was &#145;scarcely surpassed by any modern production of the kind&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, Aug 1838, 171), and another anticipated that it would establish, &#145;the little known Warrington&#146;, high in the public esteem  (<span class="italic">Birmingham Journal</span>, 16 Jan 1838, cited in <span class="italic">London and Dublin Weekly Orthodox Journal</span>, 1838, 90&#150;91). He was then working from premises at 42 Upper Berkeley Street, Marylebone, which he carried on using until 1856, when he moved to 35 Connaught Terrace, Hyde Park (from 1863 onwards his work address was given as Polygon Mews, west London). Warrington may have met Pugin through Willement, who had worked (possibly with Warrington) in the early 1830s, at Alton Towers in Staffordshire, for Pugin's later patron the earl of Shrewsbury. Warrington and Pugin continued to work together until about 1841, during which time windows were made for Pugin's first church, St Mary's, Derby, in 1839, and for his Roman Catholic cathedral&#151;the first in Britain since the Reformation&#151;St Chad's, Birmingham, <i>c</i>.1841. At this time it appears that Warrington became financially embarrassed: a letter from Pugin to Lord Shrewsbury mentioned Warrington being on the point of arrest, with Pugin, seemingly, alleviating the situation by paying on account for glass for St Chad's (cited in P. Stanton, &#145;Welby Pugin and the Gothic Revival&#146;, PhD diss., University of London, 1950, 202). Warrington's manner and his prices led to a break with Pugin, the latter writing to Lord Shrewsbury on 25 August 1841: &#145;The reason I did not give Warrington the window at the hospital [of St John, Alton] is that he has become lately so conceited, got nearly as expensive as Willement&#146;  (Parl. Arch., historical collection no. 339, letter 71).<br>
<br>Warrington's combative nature was demonstrated publicly in his letters to <span class="italic">The Builder</span> over the window for St James, Piccadilly, for which, in 1845, he had been considered among others, but passed over in favour of William Wailes (1808&#150;1881). On 25 August 1845 he lambasted the selection committee for acting &#145;ignorantly and unjustly&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Builder</span>, 3, 1845, 415), and on 15 July 1846 severely criticized the completed work, remarking: &#145;For I fearlessly state, that there is not a single artistic feeling in the whole window&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Builder</span>, 4, 1846, 353). The letters engendered strong rebuke from Charles Mayhew, the honorary secretary of the committee, on 26 July 1846, who accused Warrington of behaving unprofessionally, while <span class="italic">The Ecclesiologist</span> expressed surprise at his advocacy of pictorial windows: &#145;in our ignorance we had fancied Mr Warrington a plodding and over-minutely careful copyist of the glass of Romanesque and First pointed days; he speaks for himself, and turns out a reformer, a Rubens-worshipper, an uncompromising developer&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Ecclesiologist</span>, 6, 1846, 104&#150;5). Undaunted, Warrington replied in the January 1847 issue, accepting as a compliment the reference to being a careful copyist&#151;overlooking the fact that it pointed to his tendency to &#145;antiquate&#146; or exaggerate the contorted poses and features, drawn by some of the ancient artists&#151;and claiming propriety as the basis for his choice of style.<br>
<br>In 1848 Warrington courted further controversy when he published his <span class="italic">The History of Stained Glass</span>. Curiously, and inadvisably, he had used illustrations of his own work, rather than those of ancient examples, to demonstrate the styles. The reviewer of <span class="italic">The Ecclesiologist</span>, was merciless:<blockquote>Our literary glazier proves what twelfth century glass is by depicting choice specimens from &#145;Bromley S. Leonard, Stepney S. Peter and Brompton Holy Trinity, designed and executed by W. Warrington Esq. in the year of grace 1841. And if we seek to know how Tudor artists painted glass, Mr Warrington courteously points to his own rejected &#145;design for some of the windows of the House of Lords [1844]&#146; we ask for medieval facts; and we are put off with nineteenth century competition-sketches. We think this hardly fair. If Mr Warrington wished to put forth the largest and most expensive advertisement upon record, there is no need to dub it a &#145;History&#146; of the past. (<span class="italic">The Ecclesiologist</span>, 10, 1849&#150;50, 81&#150;2)</blockquote>Warrington's text was also heavily criticized for inaccuracy in its literary references, interpretation of medieval arrangement of subject matter and use of sacred forms. The book, however, remains a useful indicator of the 1840s work of Warrington and is a source of information regarding some early nineteenth-century glass-painters.<br>
<br>Writers in <span class="italic">The Ecclesiologist</span> continued to criticize Warrington's work. His window in Ely Cathedral was regarded, in the October 1850 issue, as the worst of all the new windows there, while, later, one in St Mary's, Ottery St Mary, Devon, was described as being: &#145;deficient in beauty, refinement and dignity&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Ecclesiologist</span>, 13, 1852, 85). Again Warrington responded spiritedly, replying in the journal to the Ely criticisms in a letter dated 4 October 1850 that included a letter of defence by the dean of Ely, against the &#145;very unfair and offensive criticism&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Ecclesiologist</span>, 11, 1850, 266&#150;7). Indeed, it is clear that however much Warrington inspired hostility from within stained-glass circles he could still attract country-wide patronage. Much of his work is recorded, by county, in his manuscript &#145;A list of some of the principal works in stained glass&#146; (V&amp;A). His importance resides in his being among the first of the English Gothic revival stained-glass artists. His early work with Pugin was perhaps his most notable and might be seen as potential unrealized, but he continued to make windows until 1866. He died on 4 June 1869 at Martello Cottages, Folkestone, Kent, aged seventy-three, and was buried six days later at SS Mary and Eanswythe Church in Folkestone. His son, James Perry Warrington, carried on the business for about another ten years.<br>
