<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mather,  Increase</span>  (1639&#150;1723), <span class="occ">Congregational minister</span>, was born in Dorchester, Massachusetts, on 21 June 1639, the youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18324/', "Richard Mather (1596&#150;1669)")</script>, minister, and Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1655), daughter of Edmund Holt, who had migrated to New England from Lancashire, England, in 1635. At the age of twelve he went to live and study with the Revd John Norton in Boston, and then attended Harvard College, graduating BA in 1656. In 1657 he followed his brothers <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18326/', "Samuel Mather")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18323/', "Nathaniel Mather")</script> to England, and then settled briefly in Ireland, graduating MA from Trinity College, Dublin, in 1658 and preaching in Magherafelt and Ballyscullion, co. Derry.<br>
<br>Mather moved to England in 1659 where he substituted for his brother Nathaniel's friend John Howe as minister at Great Torrington, Devon. When Howe returned from London in 1659 Mather moved on, serving briefly as a minister in Guernsey and Gloucester. With no settled congregation, he was not one of the ministers ejected from their posts after the Restoration of 1660 but clearly his religious views were incompatible with the new regime and he returned to Massachusetts in 1661.<br>
<br>On 6 March 1662 Mather married Maria (1642&#150;1714), daughter of the New England minister John Cotton. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18321/', "Cotton Mather")</script> was their first child. Nine others survived childhood. At the same time Mather was engaged in the controversy over the half-way covenant, opposing the proposed expansion of membership by relaxing the rules concerning religious conversion. In 1664 he was ordained teacher of the North Church in Boston, Massachusetts, and over the next twenty-five years he emerged as the foremost figure in American puritanism. During the next two decades he published nearly fifty books, including sermons and works of theology, natural science, and history. He criticized what he saw as a decline from the standards of the founders and was the key figure in the reforming synod of 1679 which called for a moral cleansing of the society and covenant renewals. He was involved in the affairs of Harvard College and accepted the presidency in 1685 but continued in his post at North Church and to live in Boston.<br>
<br>Part of Mather's stature derived from his key role in maintaining the link between English and American puritanism through his continuing connection with English dissenters such as Thomas Jollie. He both gave and received advice and assistance and aided others in their correspondence with transatlantic friends. When New Englanders were criticized by English dissenters for their treatment of Baptists, Mather defended the colonists. He argued that the colonial Baptists were not Calvinists and did not value a learned ministry and were therefore different from the Particular Baptists with whom English congregationalists (and he himself when he had been in England) found it possible to co-operate.<br>
<br>In 1684, when the government of Charles II demanded that Massachusetts surrender its charter, Mather urged the citizens of Boston to resist, but without success. The Bay colony was incorporated, along with the other New England colonies and then New York, into the dominion of New England. In 1688, distressed with Sir Edmund Andros's policies as governor-general of the dominion, Mather slipped away from Boston and sailed to England to seek redress for the colonists. Initially he had three audiences with James II in which he pleaded for restoration of the old charter. Following the revolution of 1688 he was granted access to King William through the intercession of English friends and attempted to gain royal acceptance of the colonial revolt that had overthrown the dominion in reaction to news of England's revolution, and to gain a return of the old Massachusetts charter. At the same time he immersed himself in the affairs of the English dissenters, preaching to their congregations, associating with their leaders such as Richard Baxter, and playing an active role in the short-lived &#145;heads of agreement&#146; that united congregational and presbyterian clergymen.<br>
<br>Mather failed to gain restoration of the old charter but was instrumental in obtaining a new charter for the colony in 1691. He was also allowed to nominate the first royal governor and member of the governor's council. On his return to Boston he found the colony embroiled in the Salem witchcraft hysteria. Mather certainly had done his share to warn people of the dangers of the devil, but he was disturbed by the nature of the court proceedings. Though he was slow to make public his concerns, his publication, <span class="italic">Cases of Conscience Concerning Evil Spirits</span> (1692), criticizing the use of spectral evidence, played a key role in bringing the trials to a close.<br>
<br>Over the remaining decades of his life Mather's star was in the decline. He was criticized, though not as much as his son Cotton, for his role in the witchcraft episodes. His efforts to curtail the spread of liberal and latitudinarian influences in New England led to his losing the Harvard presidency in 1701. Though a believer in ministerial associations he was critical of a movement to create regional clerical boards that he felt impinged too much on congregational autonomy. Those dissatisfied with aspects of the new charter government criticized him unrealistically for not having achieved a restoration of the old. His support of his son Cotton's promotion of inoculation during a smallpox epidemic in 1721 was also unpopular. Yet he continued to publish&#151;forty new volumes in the first two decades of the new century&#151;and was recognized as the region's greatest link to the founding generation. His wife, Maria, died on 4 April 1714 and the following year he married Anne (1663&#150;1739), widow of Maria's nephew John Cotton of Hampton and daughter of Thomas Lake, a merchant of Boston. Following his death on 23 August 1723 an immense procession followed Mather's coffin to its burial place on Copps Hill, not far from the North Church that he had served for over half a century. His wife, Anne, survived him; she died on 29 March 1739.<br>
