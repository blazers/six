<span class="headword">Wadeson,  Richard</span>  (1826&#150;1885), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Gaythorse, near Lancaster, on 31 July 1826. On 17 November 1843 he enlisted at Plymouth in the 75th (Stirlingshire) regiment (later 1st battalion, Gordon Highlanders). He was promoted corporal on 27 August 1846 and sergeant on 7 November 1848, and went to India in 1849. He was promoted regimental sergeant-major on 24 February 1854. Then the Indian mutiny broke out. The 75th made forced marches from Kasauli in the Himalayas to Ambala where, in May, it was part of the force ordered to Delhi, then held by the mutineers. On 2 June 1857 Wadeson was commissioned ensign in the regiment, without purchase, and was promoted lieutenant on 19 September. He served with the regiment throughout the mutiny campaign, including the battle of Badli-ki-sarai and at the siege of Delhi, after which he was mentioned in dispatches, and awarded the Victoria Cross. He was with the regiment and was wounded at the assault of Delhi on 14 September 1857.<br>
<br>On 11 March 1859 he was appointed adjutant of the regiment, which position he retained until promoted captain on 9 December 1864. He was with the 75th during the Fenian disturbances of 1866&#150;7, and served in Gibraltar, Singapore, Hong Kong, Mauritius, and the Cape, until promoted major on 11 July 1872. In 1873 the 75th returned home, and was quartered in England and Ireland, and there, on 18 December 1875, he was promoted to the command of the regiment, which he held at home and in the Channel Islands until his promotion to a brevet colonelcy on 18 December 1880. On 26 March 1881 he was appointed major and lieutenant-governor of the Royal Hospital, Chelsea, London, where he died on 24 January 1885, survived by his widow, Susan. He was buried with military honours at Brompton cemetery.<br>
