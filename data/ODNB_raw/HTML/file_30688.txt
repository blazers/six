<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bell, Sir  Henry Hesketh Joudou</span>  (1864&#150;1952), <span class="occ">colonial governor and author</span>, was born on 17 December 1864 in the West Indies, the eldest son of Henry A. J. Bell. Little is known of his early life other than that he was said to be of French extraction, and he lived for extended periods with his father in Belgium and France where he received only a limited education. However, he spoke French perfectly. In 1882 he began his career as a third-class clerk working in the office of the governor of Barbados and the Windward Islands. His financial acumen was soon recognized and he was transferred to the treasury department of Grenada where he served successfully for seven years. Given long-standing local sensitivities about revenue collection, Bell must have gained a good grounding in the art of stretching very limited resources a long way.<br>
<br>In 1890 Bell joined the colonial service and was posted to the Gold Coast as supervisor of customs. He served here for four years in both financial and administrative positions, being promoted several times. This was not a happy period as he particularly feared the climate of tropical Africa, and was therefore relieved to return to the Bahamas to take up the post of receiver-general in 1894. Several good appointments followed, including administrator of Dominica and acting governor of the Leeward Islands, between 1895 and 1905. His service during this period impressed the Colonial Office, as well as Joseph Chamberlain, and his career advanced rapidly thereafter. Bell was particularly aided in his dealings with the Colonial Office by his ability to write lucid and interesting accounts of his activities. He was appointed CMG in 1903 and more importantly in 1905 was offered the post of high commissioner to Uganda, his first major appointment. In spite of his reservations about the climate, Bell felt that he could not reject such a promising offer. One of the first major problems that he had to deal with in Uganda were epidemics of sleeping sickness that claimed many lives. Having ascertained that cases of the sickness were generally confined to areas within 2 miles of open water, he sought permission from the Colonial Office to move all communities living by the tsetse-fly infested shores and islands of Lake Victoria to new plots on crown land further away. While the Colonial Office demurred at the political implications of forcibly moving large sections of the population, Bell ordered the moves to be carried out regardless. As a consequence many lives were saved and no unrest was reported. His actions in this matter were recognized with advancement to KCMG in 1908.<br>
<br>During his time in Uganda, Bell continued to develop his ideas on economic development, believing that the region would be best served through nurturing the interests and improving the agricultural methods of the local farmers. He was also determined that the activities of the European planters should be curtailed as far as possible. The role of government, he argued, was to provide leadership, set standards, and bear the cost of agricultural experiments as well as to provide scientific advice, particularly in relation to the development of cash crops. To these ends he introduced the 1908 Uganda cotton ordinance which gave the governor wide powers to control the quality of cotton produced, and wrote his own useful report on the subject in 1909 for the Colonial Office. He worked very hard to improve the transport infrastructure, steering every available penny into the construction of new roads.<br>
<br>In 1909 Bell was promoted to the post of governor of Northern Nigeria and it was at this point that his career began to falter. The permanent officials at the Colonial Office, particularly Charles Strachey, felt that he had too little knowledge of Nigerian affairs to cope unaided. Charles Temple was appointed chief secretary, with a dormant commission, to shore up Bell's administration. Temple was a ruthlessly determined, ambitious, and very skilful officer who had been in Nigeria since 1901 and had been one of Sir Frederick Lugard's pioneering administrators. Bell arrived in the protectorate already seriously handicapped in his dealings with the tough and independently minded Northern Nigerian political officers. It was hoped that he would have some impact on the economic development of the region, but in practice his influence was so limited that he could do little more than occasionally delay and question the actions of his senior officers who were convinced proponents of the policy of indirect rule. These officers had little time for Bell, decrying his lack of social background, his fear of the climate, and, above all, his apparent lack of credibility when compared to Temple. Events came to a head when a satirical doggerel verse outlining the many faults of Bell was passed around the protectorate until, inevitably, someone could not resist placing it on his desk. Bell unwisely made a great play to find the culprit, even taking the matter up with the Colonial Office. It was thought that this ditty explained his departure from Nigeria in 1912, nearly a year earlier than expected. Lugard was appointed as his successor.<br>
<br>After Nigeria, Bell returned to the Caribbean, serving as the governor of the Leeward Islands from 1912, and was then posted to Mauritius in 1916. Once again he was able to demonstrate his skill in fostering economic development, and he took a frank pleasure in the trappings of his office. He retired in 1925 and was made a GCMG the following year. Immediately after retiring he travelled extensively throughout Java and French Indo-China, and on his return wrote <span class="italic">Foreign Colonial Administration in the Far East</span> (1928), which won the Royal Empire Society's gold medal. In all he published ten books on various subjects including the occult. His first book, a study of witchcraft, appeared in 1889; his last, <span class="italic">Witches and Fishes</span>, appeared in 1948. He continued to travel for the rest of his life, sojourning in the Bahamas during the Second World War. Bell did not make a home in England after his retirement but he frequently visited London (where he was a member of the Athenaeum). He died, unmarried, on 1 August 1952, at 92 Redcliffe Gardens, Kensington, London.<br>
