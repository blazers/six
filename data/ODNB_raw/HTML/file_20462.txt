<span class="headword">O'Brien,  Murrough</span>, first earl of Thomond  (<em>d.</em> 1551), <span class="occ">chieftain and rebel</span>, was the third son of Turlough Donn O'Brien (<i>d</i>. 1528), lord of Thomond, and Raghnailt, daughter of John MacNamara, chief of Clancullen. In 1531 Murrough became tanist to his older brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20445/', "Conor O'Brien")</script>, the O'Brien chief, filling the vacancy left by the death of his brother Donough. Murrough lived in Inchiquin, co. Clare, from 1531. He controlled the strategically important lands near the Shannon, including O'Brien's bridge. The bridge&#151;constructed by his father in 1506 to facilitate the movement of goods and supplies across the Shannon&#151;was a symbol of O'Brien strength and its destruction the objective of repeated government expeditions. In the summer of 1538 Lord Leonard Grey, the lord deputy, secured a year-long truce with Conor who subsequently aided the deputy in an invasion of Murrough's country and presided over the bridge's destruction. Conor's independent negotiations with Grey coupled with his belated attempt to divert the succession to his sons with his second wife, Ellice, daughter of Maurice Fitzgerald, ninth earl of Desmond, alienated Murrough and many clansmen. Conor died in 1539 and Murrough succeeded by custom of tanistry.<br>
<br>Grey's aggressive behaviour and his suspected complicity with Conor pushed Murrough O'Brien into confederacy with Con Bacach O'Neill and Manus O'Donnell, whose nominal aim was the restoration of Thomas Fitzgerald, tenth earl of Kildare. O'Brien's entry broadened the Geraldine league's support outside Ulster. This rare mustering of Gaelic strength was a worrying development for the government and demanded immediate action. Grey was consequently summoned to court in April. He was replaced by Sir Anthony St Leger who, shortly after his arrival in July, embarked on a markedly more conciliatory initiative to defuse the confederacy. O'Brien proved receptive and met St Leger at Limerick in early 1541.<br>
<br>St Leger spoke plainly to O'Brien, offering him peace and future stability in exchange for his acknowledgement of Henry VIII's laws and sovereignty. He insisted, moreover, that O'Brien's authority be confined to west of the Shannon and assured him that failure to comply would result in war. The submission of other nobles and chieftains left O'Brien with little choice; he asked for time to consider, however, and retired to Thomond in Munster. In November he wrote directly to Henry professing his loyalty and requested a pardon. He also expressed an interest in personally submitting to the king whom he desired to see &#145;above all creatures on yerthe lyvinge, now in myne old days; whiche sight I dowbt not but shall prolonge my lyff&#146;  (<span class="italic">State Papers, Henry VIII</span>, 3.345). Yet O'Brien failed to include his decision regarding the limitation of his authority. In February 1542 he attended the lord deputy in Limerick and finally agreed to the limitation of his authority to west of the Shannon. Though St Leger described O'Brien as &#145;a very sobre man, and very like to contynewe Your Majesties trewe subjecte&#146;, he recognized that O'Neill's submission two months earlier had exercised a profound effect upon his decision  (ibid., 3.363).<br>
<br>The application for a peerage&#151;the next stage of submission in St Leger's policy of surrender and regrant&#151;presented several problems. O'Brien was married to Eleanor, daughter of Sir Thomas Fitzgerald, knight of Glyn, with whom he had four sons and three daughters. He had succeeded by tanistry and under English law his legitimate male descendants would inherit his peerage. This, however, would deny Donough O'Brien&#151;Conor's eldest son and ally to the crown&#151;any possibility of succession. To avoid a succession dispute upon O'Brien's death St Leger devised a far-sighted solution: O'Brien would be created earl of Thomond and Baron Inchiquin for life with the latter title reverting to his eldest son, Dermod; his nephew Donough would concurrently be created baron of Ibrackan until Murrough's death when he would become earl of Thomond. The king accepted the unorthodox solution but warned that &#145;the heire of thErle of Thomond, from hensforth, must abide his tyme to be admitted as a member of our Parlyment, till his father or parent shalbe decessed&#146;  (<span class="italic">State Papers, Henry VIII</span>, 3.395). O'Brien, accompanied by Ulick Burke and Donough, repaired to England&#151;their expenses covered by Ir&pound;100 loaned by St Leger&#151;where they were on 1 July 1543 created earl of Thomond, earl of Clanricarde, and Baron Ibrackan respectively. Their acceptance of English titles, however, was not wholly welcomed:<blockquote>Banbha's S&iacute;ol mBriain under Murrough's chieftaincy are covenanted to the King of England; they have turned their backs on their ancestral inheritance&#151;it is a pitiful surrender. (&Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, 272)</blockquote>Thomond maintained the peace for the duration of the 1540s, functioning as an extension of the government in Munster, which was seldom touched by the Tudor regime. In the late 1540s he settled disputes among the O'Carrolls and Burkes on behalf of the lord deputy and lent his protection to several towns in Munster. In reward he received all the suppressed religious houses in Thomond, property near Dublin, and, in August 1543, a place on the Irish privy council. He remained a close supporter of St Leger's regime. He died, probably at Inchiquin, some time between 26 June and 28 October 1551.<br>
<br>Despite his compliance with Tudor rule, the annals recorded that Thomond was a brave and wealthy man. His nephew Donough succeeded as earl of Thomond while his son Dermod succeeded as Lord Inchiquin; but despite St Leger's ingenious statecraft the factions arising from Conor O'Brien's two marriages reared their head when in 1553 the second earl died following an attack launched by his stepbrothers. Murrough O'Brien's ostensibly successful transformation from Gaelic chief to English earl was not universally accepted and the next generation inherited the divisive legacy of surrender and regrant.<br>
