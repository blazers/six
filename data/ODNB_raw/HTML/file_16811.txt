<span class="headword">Livingston,  William</span>, sixth Lord Livingston  (<em>d.</em> 1592), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the second son of Alexander Livingston, fifth Lord Livingston (<i>d</i>. in or before 1553), and his wife, Lady Agnes Douglas, daughter of John Douglas, second earl of Morton. His parents were guardians of Mary, queen of Scots, when she was a child, and his sister Mary Livingston became one of the queen's famous attendants, the four <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69949/', "Queen's Maries")</script>. The Livingston lands lay in Linlithgowshire and Stirlingshire and included Kilsyth and Falkirk, as well as Callendar House, the family's principal residence. William succeeded to these, and to his father's titles in 1553, and about that time married Agnes, daughter of Malcolm Fleming, third Lord Fleming. Their eldest son was the politician and courtier <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16801/', "Alexander Livingstone")</script>. Livingston was a protestant, but nevertheless when Mary, queen of Scots, returned to Scotland from France in 1561 he became one of her most loyal supporters, entertaining her at Callendar House on various occasions. On Sunday 1 July 1565, for instance, Mary was present at the christening of one of his seven children there, and although he declined to attend her mass on 2 February 1566, he was one of the few protestants to accept an invitation to the Roman Catholic baptism of her son, the future James VI and I, at Stirling on 17 December 1566.<br>
<br>Livingston was present during many of the dramatic events of Mary's life. He was with her in the little supper room in the palace of Holyroodhouse on the evening of 9 March 1566 when her husband, Lord Darnley, and his fellow conspirators burst in to murder her secretary, David Riccio. On 13 January 1567 Mary spent the night at Callendar House on her way from Stirling to Edinburgh with her infant son, and she was back less than a fortnight later, when she rode to Glasgow to visit Darnley, who was lying ill there. One of the notorious casket letters describes how Livingston teased her that evening. She allegedly wrote that Livingston:<blockquote>at supper sayd softly to me when I was leaning upon him and warming myself, &#145;You may well go and see sick folk, yet can you not be so welcome unto them as you have this day left somebody in pain&#146;. (Henderson, 135)</blockquote>The letters are generally believed to be forgeries but even so, this passage with its unpleasant innuendo was probably not a complete invention, but rather an exaggerated account of a relationship which, while entirely innocent, was indeed one of close and friendly informality.Three days later Mary and her husband spent the night at Callendar on their way back to Kirk o'Field, just outside Edinburgh's city walls, where Darnley was to convalesce. When he was murdered shortly afterwards Mary's enemies alleged that she had deliberately lured him to his death, and she made matters worse by marrying James Hepburn, fourth earl of Bothwell, generally believed to be the principal assassin. Livingston was a guest at their wedding on 15 May 1567. He may have been unhappy with its disastrous consequences, for he was not with the queen when she surrendered to her rebellious lords at Carberry Hill. During her imprisonment in Lochleven Castle, however, Livingston was one of a deputation who went to the regent Moray to plead for her release. The request was refused, but when Mary finally managed to escape from Lochleven, Livingston rode at once with his vassals to join her at Niddrie Castle, and accompanied her to Hamilton. Present in her army at the battle of Langside in 1568, he was one of the three lords who led her away when it became obvious that her forces would be defeated, and he went with her when she escaped to England.<br>
<br>Livingston remained with Mary in England for almost two years, and his wife, Agnes Fleming, was allowed to join him. He was one of Mary's commissioners at her first trial in York in October 1568, and throughout her years of imprisonment he continued to be active in her cause. He was in Scotland in July 1570 on her behalf, and in 1571 he visited France, staying in Paris during the St Bartholomew's day massacre in the following year. Lady Livingston was allowed to return to Callendar House in 1572, and took the opportunity of passing on secret correspondence between the queen's various friends. As a result, she was imprisoned for two months.<br>
<br>Livingston was finally allowed to go home to Scotland after Edinburgh Castle fell to James VI's supporters in May 1573. He was made a member of the Scottish privy council in March 1575, but his influence had waned because of his identification with Mary's cause. He was among the lords who advised the young James VI to start ruling for himself in 1577, became a friend of James's favourite, Esm&eacute; Stewart, first duke of Lennox, and was rumoured to be a Roman Catholic in his later years. His last known public act was to serve on the jury which convicted the first earl of Gowrie of treason in 1584. Livingston's signature appears on a family charter dated 18 October 1592, but he was dead by 29 November. He was buried in the churchyard at Falkirk.<br>
