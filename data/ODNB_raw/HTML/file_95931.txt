<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Trapp,  Joseph Burney</span>  (1925&#150;2005), <span class="occ">librarian, historian, and literary scholar</span>, was born at Carterton in the southern part of North Island, New Zealand, on 16 July 1925, the son of (Henry Mansfield) Burney Trapp and his wife, Frances Melanie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wolters. His maternal grandfather had founded the agency for distributing and registering land tenure, which his father had joined. As a boy he went to Dannevirke high school, a small state boarding-school further north of Carterton, where his elder sister was head of English. From there he went with a national scholarship to Victoria University College, Wellington, in 1943. Already fascinated by the classics and with a good grounding in Latin, he now added Greek, its rudiments firmly implanted by his elder sister, Phyllis, but afterwards largely self-taught.<br>
<br>Trapp graduated BA in English and Greek from Victoria in 1945, adding an MA in English and English literature with honours (there was then no doctoral system) in 1946. In the following year he started work at the Alexander Turnbull Library in Wellington, an independent institution with an outstandingly good collection, notably of Milton. The four years that he spent there taught him a lot about libraries and the way they work, but he was still thinking of an academic career, and was glad to return to Victoria as a junior lecturer in 1950. There he had to teach a wide range of subjects, including a course on the classical background for English students. He might have remained at Victoria, but for an unexpected chance. Donald Gordon, professor of English at Reading University, decided to advertise in New Zealand a new short-term post as an assistant lecturer in his own department. Trapp saw the advertisement, applied for the post, and was appointed.<br>
<br>Trapp arrived at Reading for the new academic year in 1951. He was one of a number of notable immigrants from New Zealand who arrived in Britain, still in the grip of post-war austerity, at this time, including Robert Burchfield and Donald McKenzie. The colleagues he met at Reading, among them John Wain and Frank Kermode, remained friends. To Gordon he remained more than grateful, gratitude reciprocated in the dedication of Gordon's <span class="italic">The Renaissance Imagination</span> (1976). While at Reading he married, at the parish church in Mapledurham on 9 June 1953, Elayne Margaret Falla, the daughter of Sir Robert Alexander Falla, ornithologist and director of the Dominion Museum, Wellington. They had two sons.<br>
<br>Before Trapp's contract at Reading expired, another post, as assistant librarian at the Warburg Institute, came up. Gordon, who had greatly admired its director, Fritz Saxl, urged him to apply: &#145;it's just your sort of place&#146;, he said. So Trapp left Reading, not without regret. He arrived in London in 1953, becoming librarian in 1966, a post he held for ten more years. They were, perhaps, the happiest working years of his life. He took easily to the Warburg's eclectic system of arranging its books (he became an expert, perhaps the last surviving, on the &#145;Prussian instructions&#146; of 1899 on which it was based), and through it to the institute itself.<br>
<br>Over these years Trapp became the guide, philosopher, and friend of all who used the library, not least the staff. His knowledge of its books was encyclopaedic, due not least to the fact that he handled most of them when the institute moved from South Kensington to Woburn Square in 1958. He opened the parcels of new acquisitions, as well as cataloguing them. He made a point of introducing himself to readers, in turn introducing them to books they had never heard of. He and his wife kept open house for the staff, taking in Leopold Ettlinger, head of the photographic collection, when he was bereft of his wife in 1956. Others, graduating from pupil to the staff, found that he continued to look after their interests, in and outside the institute. To all he offered the same courtesy and help, unawed by the great but especially tender to the tyro.<br>
<br>Trapp also took to the Warburg's equally eclectic scholarly objectives, linking the sources of imagery and literature. He was joint editor of the <span class="italic">Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes</span> from 1956 to 1976. His first major article (published in C. A. Patrides, ed., <span class="italic">Approaches to &#145;Paradise Lost&#146;</span>, 1958) was &#145;The iconography of the fall of man&#146;. He had an abiding interest in poetic garlands, the portraits and tombs of classical authors, and their counterparts in modern literature. &#145;Ovid's tomb: the growth of a legend from Eusebius to Laurence Sterne, Chateaubriand and George Richmond&#146; (published in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes</span> in 1973) artfully linked Renaissance and Enlightenment. He developed a special interest in the English followers of the Italian Renaissance, and was early associated with the Yale edition of the complete works of Thomas More. He undertook the volume devoted to <span class="italic">The Apology of Sir Thomas More</span>. It was not completed until 1979 but it remains a model of its kind, as sound on More's English as on the classical and biblical allusions, pursued with patient care. This led to a visiting professorship at the University of Toronto in 1969, and a hectic but enjoyable visit to Dartmouth College, where the American <span class="italic">Oxford Anthology of English Literature</span> (he was responsible for the medieval volume, published in 1973) was planned.<br>
<br>To succeed Ernst Gombrich as director of the institute in 1979 was a surprise to Trapp, as also to some others. The sequence of continental predecessors, Saxl, Henri Frankfort, Gertrud Bing, and Gombrich himself, seemed to predicate another in that mould. But Gombrich and others in the institute had had time to observe not only how efficiently the library ran, how seamlessly new acquisitions had added to its original strength and amplified its scope, but also the real scholarship in Trapp's work, his articles, short or long, carefully and imaginatively expressed. More important than all these, they recognized one on whom they could rely to maintain the old Warburg tradition, but lead it into closer connection with the University of London. This was not an easy task. It needed all Trapp's patience and diplomacy, suffering long meetings (which he could not bear) in a good cause, overcoming obstacles laid in the path by acquisitive or disapproving forces in the surrounding university, rallying the very varied troops on his own side, to bring this off. But he did it. The Warburg's staff and work were as richly diverse as they had been when he took over, but both were deployed in a way that fused gently with the rest of the university, by now hardly less various. The staff held positions within the university (Trapp was himself professor of the history of the classical tradition).<br>
<br>Trapp was never one to be overwhelmed by mere administration; if he knew that time could be better spent (and that prompted the odd outburst, more endearing than alarming), he always found time for what mattered, whether his own or other people's work. They benefited immediately; he read their manuscripts, invited them to lecture, and introduced them to audience or colleagues with equal sympathy. His own work was collected in <span class="italic">Essays on the Renaissance and the Classical Tradition</span> (1990) and <span class="italic">Studies of Petrarch and his Influence</span> (2003). The rise of &#145;the portrait of the author&#146; became his Gray lectures at Cambridge in 1990, and as Lyell reader at Oxford (1994) he dealt as vividly with the illustration of Petrarch. This was followed by his Panizzi lectures at the British Library, published as <span class="italic">Erasmus, Colet and More</span> (1991). With Lotte Hellinga he edited the <span class="italic">Cambridge History of the Book in Britain, 1400&#150;1557</span> (1999). &#145;Illustrations of Petrarch: an iconographic survey&#146; (with Elizabeth McGrath) was in preparation at the time of his death.<br>
<br>Trapp also found time for other public duties. He was on the advisory boards of the Victoria and Albert Museum (1977&#150;83) and the British Library (1980&#150;87), and on the council of the British School at Rome (1984&#150;95); he was chairman and trustee of Lambeth Palace Library (1987&#150;98). Elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1980, he was its vice-president (1983&#150;5) and foreign secretary (1988&#150;95). He was a visiting professor at the University of Melbourne in 1980, and at Iowa State and Princeton universities in 1984. To all these institutions he gave the same degree of care and thought as he had to the Warburg. On his retirement in 1990 he was appointed CBE.<br>
<br>Retirement, however, was only the signal for more work, happily free of other entanglements. Although he was increasingly lame from arthritis, most days saw Trapp's little car parked outside the Warburg; he never intruded on his successor, but welcomed the many who called to ask for advice and help. He was always glad to see them, even if they interrupted his work. They always got more than they asked for: facts unknown, drawn from his vast reading, advice on organizing work, sympathy and encouragement. Humanity came naturally to one to whom the humanities were second nature.<br>
<br>He died at Ravenscourt Park Hospital, Hammersmith, on 13 July 2005; he was survived by his wife and two sons.<br>
