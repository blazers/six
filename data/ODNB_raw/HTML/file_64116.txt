<span class="headword">Goode, Sir  William Allmond Codrington</span>  (1907&#150;1986), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was born at 5 Riverdale Road, Twickenham, on 8 June 1907, eldest son of Sir Richard Allmond Goode (1873&#150;1953), colonial administrator, and his wife, Agnes Codrington. Goode was educated at Oakham School (1920&#150;26) and at Worcester College, Oxford (1926&#150;30), where he held a classical exhibition and graduated with second-class honours. In the civil service entrance examinations of 1931 he was placed high enough to have a choice of joining the UK civil service or taking a Far Eastern cadetship. He decided to follow his father's example of service overseas and joined the Malayan civil service. A spare, athletic figure he had played in his school first fifteen and was captain of his college boat club at Oxford. In 1936 he was called to the bar by Gray's Inn. In 1938 he married Mary Armstrong Harding, who died in 1947. In 1950 he married Ena Mary McLaren, and they had one daughter.<br>
<br>From 1931 to 1940 Goode held district posts, mainly in the rural, predominantly Malay, east coast of Malaya. In 1940 he became assistant commissioner for civil defence in Singapore. As a serving member of the Singapore volunteer corps he was mobilized in 1941 as a lance-corporal; he became a prisoner of war in 1942 and was sent by the Japanese to work on the Burma&#150;Siam railway project. On returning to Malaya after the war he was appointed deputy economic secretary and in 1949 went to Aden as chief secretary (and acting governor in 1950&#150;51). In 1953 he returned to Singapore as chief secretary (1953&#150;7) and then governor (1957&#150;9). He was then governor of North Borneo (Sabah) (1960&#150;63) and finally, on returning to the UK, became chairman of the Water Resources Board, a post he held from 1964 to 1974.<br>
<br>Goode was a very able and quietly decisive administrator, who was also trusted and well liked both by political leaders and by the local business community. The post-war years in Singapore, 1953 to 1959, were the most demanding test of his career. By fortunate chance he had served in the volunteers with David Marshall who became chief minister in 1955. In his memoirs Goode remembered Marshall as a &#145;flamboyant and exciting personality. &hellip; not a very good soldier [but] a lovable person [with] incredible courage under fire&#146;. As chief minister Marshall wanted to move very fast, which was his downfall. Then came Lim Yew Hock, who &#145;steadied affairs in Singapore&#146; in the face of forceful opposition from the People's Action Party leader, Lee Kuan Yew. Lee obviously had the full support of the underground communist movement but Goode believed him&#151;and made it plain that he did&#151;when he said that he would not allow Singapore to go communist. Later on, when Lee had become prime minister, he accepted Goode's invitation to weekly sessions at Government House to talk things over. After independence, when Goode was temporarily UK high commissioner, Lee invited him to act also as Singapore's head of state, a unique distinction for a former colonial governor. Of his dealings with the Singapore leaders Goode recalled that &#145;we could explain things to them, we could advise them, but it was always our policy to make them take the decisions; it was their show&#146;. It had not been possible, during his time in Aden, to bridge the gap created by implacable Arab hostility to British rule, but when he went on to North Borneo, Goode was able to make a friend of Donald Stephens, the Kadazan leader who became the first chief minister of Sabah (North Borneo) in 1963.<br>
<br>In Aden, Goode had worked hard, and with fair success, to improve the quality and performance of the local administration, and to secure funds for much needed development. When he went to North Borneo in 1960, it was prosperous but still had serious arrears in the development of social services such as education. To remedy these deficiencies took time, and Goode deplored the undue haste with which North Borneo was propelled into an association with Malaya for which it was ill-prepared.<br>
<br>However, looking back in retirement, Goode felt that he could take pride in having laboured so that &#145;the new nations had made it all work&#146;  (Heussler, <span class="italic">Completing a Stewardship</span>, 215). It was the pride of an unassuming man, but in his memoirs he rejected as &#145;quite unjustified&#146; the widespread criticism of civil defence in the d&eacute;b&acirc;cle of 1941&#150;2. He gave active support and help to the project for a history of the Malayan civil service.<br>
<br>Goode was deputy lieutenant of Berkshire (1975), and a knight of the order of St John (1958). He became CMG in 1952, KCMG in 1957, and finally GCMG in 1963. He died of cancer on 15 September 1986 at Thames Bank, Goring.<br>
