<span class="headword">Greenham,  Peter George</span>  (1909&#150;1992), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born on 9 September 1909 at 11 Conyers Road, Streatham, London, the second son of George Frederick Greenham (1874&#150;1950), telephone engineer, and his wife, Isabel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Duckworth (1878&#150;1961). He was educated at Streatham and Dulwich College. From there he gained a demyship at Magdalen College, Oxford, to read history, but later changed to English. At Oxford, where C. S. Lewis was his tutor, he was not happy, and he later said that he would have much preferred to go to Cambridge and be taught by F. R. Leavis. After graduating with a fourth-class degree in 1931 he became a schoolmaster, first at Thame and later at Marylebone grammar schools. However, he had always wanted to be a painter and at the age of twenty-six he became an art student at the Byam Shaw School of Drawing and Painting, run by F. E. Jackson, a great teacher of drawing. Jackson's teaching, in which a classical approach to form was realized through a searching and sensitive touch, was exactly suited to Greenham, as was the free but dedicated atmosphere of the school. Greenham became a fine draughtsman who ever afterwards acknowledged the influence of Jackson.<br>
<br>When the Second World War came the Byam Shaw closed, and Greenham had to take to teaching again, this time at Magdalen College School, Oxford. By now he was exhibiting landscapes and portraits at the Royal Academy and other venues. His reputation grew quickly and in 1951 he was elected an associate of the Royal Academy. He became a full academician in 1960. In 1964 he was made keeper and took over the running of the Royal Academy Schools. Until the end of his life he was closely involved with the Royal Academy, an institution he valued as much for its personalities and eccentricities as for its history. He had for some time been teaching drawing, both at the reopened Byam Shaw and at the Royal Academy Schools, and he now had full scope for his beliefs about art teaching&#151;unassertive, yet deeply convinced of the paramount importance of drawing. Though sympathetic to his students of whatever leaning, he insisted that they should all spend time in the life room. Such were his good relations with them that he was able to do this at a period of turmoil in art education. His attitude to teaching was very typical of the way his apparently easy-going manner was based on strong conviction; in his painting, too, his beautiful touch had nothing merely sensitive or vague about it, but was always a means towards greater precision of structure.<br>
<br>On 21 August 1964, the year he took over the schools, Greenham married a fellow painter, Irene Mary (Jane) Dowling (<i>b</i>. 1925), daughter of Geoffrey Barrow Dowling, physician. The years that followed were particularly fulfilling, with his happy marriage, many commissions, a daughter, Mary, and a son, David, and a move to the Oxfordshire village of Charlton-on-Otmoor. His portraits during these years included ambitious full lengths, but he was most truly himself in the more intimate studies in which his qualities of sympathy and sensitivity of observation came out. Two of the most memorable were those of Lady Bonham Carter, a tender evocation of old age, and of F. R. Leavis. To be painted by Greenham was to accept that sittings might go on a long time, sometimes indeed for years; but his sitters seem to have enjoyed the experience, and he once said that he grew very fond of them all&#151;except a certain general. But it would be a mistake to think of Greenham as primarily a portrait painter. His landscapes were equally important to him, and the late seascapes and beach scenes, with their pearly, iridescent colour, are very beautiful.<br>
<br>Greenham had a comfortable presence, his clothes well worn, his manner sympathetic. He had a warm and humorous sociability, his humour often self-deprecatory; but under this easy-going manner was always an incisive and watchful mind. He loved music, and the English language, which he wrote with style and relish. He only published one book, <span class="italic">Velasquez</span> (1969), but his short articles, even the annual Royal Academy keeper's report, were composed and polished with equal care. He was appointed CBE in 1978. He died of prostatic cancer in Oxford on 11 July 1992, having been converted <i>in extremis</i> to the Roman Catholic church, and was buried at Charlton-on-Otmoor on 15 July. He was survived by his wife and two children.<br>
