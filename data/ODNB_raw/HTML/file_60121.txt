<span class="headword">Mary</span> <span class="st"> [Mary of Woodstock]</span>  (1278&#150;<em>c.</em>1332), <span class="occ">princess and Benedictine nun</span>, was born at Woodstock, Oxfordshire, on 11 or 12 March 1278, the sixth daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8517/', "Edward I (1239&#150;1307)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8619/', "Eleanor of Castile (1241&#150;1290)")</script>. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14821/', "Joan, countess of Hertford and Gloucester")</script> was her sister. She took the veil at Amesbury Priory, Wiltshire, in 1285 at the insistence of her grandmother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8620/', "Eleanor of Provence")</script>, who resided there, and to the annoyance of her mother. As a daughter house of Fontevrault, the burial place of the Angevin kings, Amesbury had a strong connection with the English royal house. Although a nun, Mary enjoyed a lifestyle appropriate to her rank. She was granted &pound;100 p.a. for life in 1285, and this was doubled after the death of her grandmother in 1291. In 1292 she was granted forty oaks a year from royal forests, and twenty tuns of wine from Southampton. Plans that she should go to Fontevrault on Eleanor of Provence's death were cancelled, probably at Edward I's insistence.<br>
<br>Mary was not confined to a cloistered life at Amesbury. Accounts testify to her frequent presence at court. In 1293 she spent some time with her brother Edward. In 1297 she was at court for five weeks, making her farewells to her sister Elizabeth who was about to go to join her husband in Holland. In 1302 her financial provision was changed; she received a number of manors and the borough of Wilton in place of the &pound;200 p.a., to hold as long as she remained in England. Her income, however, proved insufficient for her needs. By 1305 she was substantially in debt, and the escheator south of the Trent was ordered to pay her &pound;200 so that she could pay off her creditors. She had an extravagant entourage; one account shows that she came to court with twenty-four horses to transport her household, while gambling at dice must have added to her costs. After her death, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28735/', "John de Warenne, earl of Surrey (1286&#150;1347)")</script>, arguing for a divorce, claimed to have had an affair with Mary. While her presence at court makes this possible, there is no corroboration for the story.<br>
<br>
<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8518/', "Edward II")</script> continued his father's support of his sister Mary, and she continued to visit court regularly. She also went on frequent pilgrimages. A request from Edward in 1317 that she should conduct a visitation of the English daughter houses of Fontevrault was unsuccessful; although her high birth gave her some influence within the order, she never obtained significant office. She did, however, have custody of several young aristocratic nuns at Amesbury. Her cultural interests are testified to by Nicholas Trevet's dedication of his chronicle to her. She died about 1332 and was buried at Amesbury.<br>
