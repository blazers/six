<span class="headword">Cowley,  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1568?, <em>d.</em> 1619), <span class="occ">actor</span>, may be the Richard, son of Robert Coolie, who was baptized on 9 October 1568 at St Albans, Hertfordshire, married Elizabeth Davies on 28 January 1592 in Bromyard, Herefordshire, and had a kinsman named Cuthbert (<i>b</i>. 1570). The actor had a wife named Elizabeth and children named Robert, Cuthbert, Richard, and Elizabeth, and his name was spelled Coolye in 1598. However, a marriage in Herefordshire in 1592 is uncomfortably close to the start of the actor's London theatrical career, and the identification must remain speculative.<br>
<br>In any case, Richard Cowley first surfaces as an actor in the early 1590s as a member of Strange's Men. In July 1593 he delivered letters from London to Strange's Men in Bristol, where they were on tour; in a letter of 1 August Edward Alleyn tells his wife: &#145;I reseved your Letter att bristo by richard couley&#146;  (Rutter, 75). Presumably he followed others of Strange's Men into the Lord Chamberlain's Men when that company was formed in 1594. He appears in the &#145;plot&#146; (a theatre document whose precise function is uncertain) of the play <span class="italic">Seven Deadly Sins</span> as &#145;R Cowly&#146;, playing several minor male parts: the Lieutenant of the Tower in the Induction, a soldier and a lord in Envy, Giraldus and a musician in Sloth, and a lord in Lechery. This &#145;plot&#146;, traditionally thought to belong to Strange's Men <i>c</i>.1590, probably belonged instead to the Lord Chamberlain's Men in 1597&#150;8. The use of &#145;Cowley&#146; in the speech prefixes of both the Quarto (1600) and Folio (1623) versions of Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</span> reveals that he played Verges alongside Will Kempe's Dogberry around 1598.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Cowley and his wife, Elizabeth, had settled in Holywell Street, in the parish of St Leonard, Shoreditch, London. Four of their children were baptized there: Robert (8 March 1596; buried 20 March 1597), Cuthbert (8 May 1597), Richard (29 April 1598; buried 26 February 1603), and Elizabeth (2 February 1602). In 1598 Richard Coolye of Holywell Street was assessed on &pound;3 of goods, a respectable sum  (Eccles, 45). In 1597 his wife consulted with Simon Forman, the famous astrologer, and apparently had an affair with him. On 20 August 1597 Forman recorded in his diary that he could not decide whether or not to visit her, and when he finally did the assignation was foiled when her husband arrived home. Forman wrote: &#145;If I had gone presently, I had found her alone&#146;  (Cerasano, 157).<br>
<br>In 1601 Cowley appears for the only time as payee for the court performances of the Chamberlain's Men, along with John Heminges. In 1603 he appears last in a list of nine players in the licence which created the King's Men, and in 1604 he occupies the same position in a list of nine King's Men who received red cloth for King James's procession through London. His position in these lists, and the fact that he appears in none of the cast lists of King's Men in either the Ben Jonson or the Beaumont and Fletcher folios, suggests that he was not a leading member of the company. In 1605 he was a legatee in the will of King's Man Augustine Phillips, who left 20<i>s</i>. in gold &#145;To my Fellowe Richard Coweley&#146;  (Honigmann and Brock, 73).<br>
<br>Cowley's wife was buried on 28 September 1616 at St Leonard's, and he himself was buried there on 12 March 1619. Six weeks earlier, on 28 January, his daughter Elizabeth, not quite seventeen years old, had married George Birch of the King's Men. Cowley's nuncupative will, dated 13 January 1618, appoints his daughter executor; it was witnessed by three of the King's Men&#151;John Heminges, Cuthbert Burbage, and John Shank&#151;and Thomas Ravenscroft, possibly the madrigalist.<br>
