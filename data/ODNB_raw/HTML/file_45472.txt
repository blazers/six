<span class="headword">Langridge,  Edith</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Mother Edith]</span>  (1864&#150;1959), <span class="occ">settlement worker and missionary in India</span>, was born at 36 Marlborough Hill, Marylebone, London, on 21 March 1864, the first daughter and second of seven children (four girls and three boys) of Henry Langridge, a merchant, and his wife, Flora Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pope. She was educated at Queen's College, Harley Street, and at Lady Margaret Hall (LMH), Oxford, where she was awarded a scholarship and read classics (1885&#150;8), obtaining second-class honours in honour moderations. Although mathematics had been her best subject at school Miss Wordsworth, the principal of LMH, decided &#145;Not mathematics, you simply can't come to Oxford and do mathematics&#146;  (Mother Edith, &#145;LMH, 1885&#150;8&#146;, 48), and arranged for her to learn Latin from scratch to take the university's responsions examination just six weeks later. She was tall, moved swiftly, and had striking grey-green eyes. Fellow students regarded her as an accomplished all-rounder&#151;academic, athletic, and practical. She enjoyed the informality of LMH life, and was thoroughly at home in its high Anglican ethos, while displaying a taste for silence that friends often attributed to the influence of her maternal grandmother, a Quaker.<br>
<br>In 1895 Edith returned briefly to LMH as acting vice-principal (student warden) for one term. In 1897 she was appointed first warden of the Lady Margaret Hall Settlement at 129 Kennington Road, Lambeth, a post she held until 1902. She had first discussed this project with a fellow LMH student, Maggie Benson, in 1886, two years after the opening of Toynbee Hall. They and others continued to work towards its realization even after the opening of the non-denominational Women's University Settlement in Southwark in 1887, and the former students of LMH formally adopted the specifically Anglican initiative in 1896. The bishop of Rochester, Edward Talbot, founder of Lady Margaret Hall, decided to found the proposed LMH Settlement in his diocese, which then included parts of south London now in the diocese of Southwark. Edith gained experience of church and secular social work agencies in the area in preparation for the new project. More than anyone else she established its early character, organization, and range of work among the poor of Lambeth.<br>
<br>Edith decided that she had a missionary vocation, and studied Swahili with a view to serving with the Universities' Mission to Central Africa. Through Bishop Talbot and Canon Charles Gore she was directed instead towards the Oxford Mission Brotherhood of the Epiphany, founded by Edmund Linwood Strong, to work with them in India and to found a sisterhood. She began to learn Bengali, she and three other volunteers were blessed by Bishop Talbot on 15 October 1902, and they sailed for India soon afterwards. Despite initial health problems she spent the rest of her life with the Oxford Mission Sisterhood of the Epiphany in India, apart from occasional periods of leave in England, including one in the summer of 1928 when she attended the golden jubilee celebrations of LMH in Oxford, and was presented to the duchess of York. She was elected an honorary fellow of LMH in 1933.<br>
<br>For thirty-two years Edith Langridge lived in Barisal, east of Calcutta. The bishop of Calcutta appointed her sister superior in 1903. She designed the sisters' habit, and helped devise the rule, based on Benedictine principles, which was adopted in 1907, and which placed the sisterhood under the direct religious and financial control of a warden from the brotherhood. She took final vows on 12 January 1913 and was immediately elected mother of the sisterhood, a position she retained until 1943. The community's task at Barisal was to help the brotherhood build up the Christian church in the district, through a girls' boarding-school, a home for needy girls and women, medical work, and outreach in the locality, often by boat. Mother Edith's responsibility, however, was the spiritual, personal, and practical development of the community. Her style was quiet, reserved, and non-authoritarian, but for some of the sisters, too austerely remote and impersonal. In 1928 and 1931 the regular election of the mother superior was deadlocked, with Edith being reinstated only by the action of the warden, followed up by a change in the constitution.<br>
<br>Mother Edith visited the foundations made elsewhere by the community, including one guiding the early development of a sisterhood in the Orthodox Syrian church, in Malabar. Other projects faced insuperable cultural problems. An equivalent of the Oxford Mission Sisterhood, for Indian women, failed. When instead the original community was opened to Indian women, only two persevered in Mother Edith's long lifetime. In a refuge for girls in Calcutta, the Christian influence of the sisters was mistrusted by the local community. But the sisterhood gradually grew modestly, attracting, among others, two former students of LMH. In 1934 Edith moved to a new venture, a student hostel in Calcutta, then in 1938 to a home for women and small boys in Behala on the city's outskirts. The Calcutta hostel closed in 1940. Political and religious circumstances in the final years of British India prevented the sisters' proposed women's college there from ever finding favour with the authorities, ending Mother Edith's hopes of involvement in higher education in India. In 1943, a new mother superior was elected, and had to face the effects of independence and partition in 1947.<br>
<br>Mother Edith spent her last years, 1952&#150;9, in Shillong, high in the Assam hills, the final eighteen months in a hospital there run by a Welsh Presbyterian mission. She died at the hospital on 6 May 1959. She compiled some devotional works and wrote some articles on missionary themes.<br>
