<span class="headword">Marsh <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Caldwell; <em>later </em>Marsh-Caldwell]</span>,  Anne</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1791, <em>d.</em> 1874), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born at her father's estate, Linley Wood, Staffordshire, and baptized at Newcastle under Lyme, Staffordshire, on 9 January 1791, the third daughter and fourth child of James Caldwell (<i>d</i>. 1838), lawyer and recorder of Newcastle under Lyme, and deputy lieutenant of Staffordshire, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Stamford of Derby. On 30 July 1817, at St James's, Audley, Staffordshire, she married Arthur Cuthbert Marsh (<i>d</i>. 1849), of Eastbury Lodge, Hertfordshire, son of William Marsh, senior partner in the London bank Marsh &amp; Co. of Berners Street. The bank was ruined in 1824 as a result of the depredations of a junior partner, Henry Fauntleroy, who was subsequently hanged for forgery. Anne and Arthur Marsh had eight children: two sons, both of whom died young, and six daughters. Given that her first book was not published until ten years after the collapse of Marsh &amp; Co., there is probably no foundation for the commonly held belief that she turned to authorship in order to help support her large family and, for the same reason, had to redouble her literary efforts after her husband's death in December 1849. Her mother had been an heiress.<br>
<br>The publication of Marsh's first volume of fiction, <span class="italic">Two Old Men's Tales</span> (&#145;The Deformed&#146; and &#145;The Admiral's Daughter&#146;, 1834), was arranged by Harriet Martineau, an old friend. Marsh had read &#145;The Admiral's Daughter&#146; to her one night after dinner, and Martineau had been moved to tears by the penitential miseries and sacrifices of its adulterous heroine. Marsh's husband, fearing that the book might injure their daughters' marriage prospects if it attracted unfavourable criticism, insisted that it be published anonymously. &#145;The Admiral's Daughter&#146; became perhaps her best-loved story. Her second book, <span class="italic">Tales of the Woods and Fields</span> (1836), was a sequel to the first, comprising further tales by the &#145;two old men&#146;; she continued to refer to herself as &#145;the Old Man&#146; for long afterwards. Eight years elapsed before her first and most popular full-length novels began to appear: <span class="italic">The Triumphs of Time</span> (1844), <span class="italic">Mount Sorel</span> (1845), <span class="italic">Father Darcy</span> (1846), <span class="italic">Emilia Wyndham</span>, her best-known novel (1846), <span class="italic">Norman's Bridge</span> (1847), and <span class="italic">Angela</span> (1848). At least twelve more novels followed, not counting two&#151;<span class="italic">Adelaide Lindsay</span> (1850) and <span class="italic">Heathside Farm</span> (1863)&#151;which were described as having been &#145;edited&#146; by her but were probably her own work, and one&#151;<span class="italic">The Longwoods of the Grange</span> (1853)&#151;described as by &#145;the author of <span class="italic">Adelaide Lindsay</span>&#146;. She also published a further volume of shorter tales, <span class="italic">Chronicles of Dartmoor</span> (1866); two translations from the French; a two-volume historical work, <span class="italic">The Protestant Reformation in France</span> (1847); and probably two stories for children, again described as by &#145;the author of <span class="italic">Adelaide Lindsay</span>&#146;. Five anonymously published novels by Julia Stretton were mistakenly attributed to Marsh in both the <span class="italic">Cambridge</span> and the <span class="italic">New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature</span>.<br>
<br>At the peak of her reputation Marsh was hailed by the <span class="italic">London Weekly Chronicle</span> as &#145;the best lady novelist of the day&#146;  (Allibone, <span class="italic">Dict.</span>). In &#145;Modern novelists&#151;great and small&#146;, an article in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span> (May 1855), Margaret Oliphant grouped her with Catherine Gore and Frances Trollope as &#145;the respectable elder sisters of the literary corporation&#146;, contrasting &#145;the goodness that lies in her old-fashioned moral&#146; with the passionate rebelliousness given free rein in the novels of Charlotte Bront&euml;, Elizabeth Gaskell, and other younger writers. After her death <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> (17 October 1874, 513) remarked that &#145;No writer had greater power than she of compelling tears&#146;. Her explicit didacticism was extreme even by early Victorian standards, and her heroines, of whom Emilia Wyndham was the best-known, were seemingly devoid of sexual desires, living only for self-sacrifice. She protested vehemently at the demeaning view of married women presented in the <span class="italic">Punch</span> series &#145;Mrs. Caudle's Curtain Lectures&#146;, branding the anonymous author (Douglas Jerrold) a &#145;vulgar penny-a-liner&#146; and suggesting that <span class="italic">Punch</span> might, for a change, try teaching husbands to &#145;correct themselves as well as their wives&#146;  (<span class="italic">Emilia Wyndham</span>, chap. 4, chap. 57).<br>
<br>Little information seems to have survived about Marsh's private life, or about her character and appearance. From their childhood she and her siblings were on intimate terms with the children of other notable Staffordshire families, including the Wedgwoods. Her sister (Margaret) Emma was the first wife of Dr Henry Holland, a relative of the Wedgwoods and cousin of Elizabeth Gaskell. Holland later became Queen Victoria's physician, and he and his family remained part of Marsh's social circle after her sister's death in 1834. In February 1838 Harriet Martineau quoted a mutual friend's report that Marsh was &#145;sadly excited and restless&#146;, with an &#145;uncontrollable&#146; nervous disorder which Martineau evidently attributed to excessive self-absorption  (<span class="italic">Harriet Martineau's Letters</span>, 11). Many years later, in February 1860, Martineau complained to the same correspondent, Fanny Wedgwood, that Marsh had never learned &#145;self-knowledge or modesty&#146;  (ibid., 186).<br>
<br>By this time Marsh had succeeded to her father's estate, Linley Wood, following the death of her brother James Stamford Caldwell on 17 November 1858, but was involved in litigation to have her three unmarried daughters, Eliza Louisa, Georgina Amelia, and Rosamond Jane, recognized as the reversionary heirs to the estate in preference to the heir-at-law, Henry Thurston Holland, her sister Emma's son (who later became a tory cabinet minister and was created Viscount Knutsford). On 18 May 1860, after the case was decided in her daughters' favour, she changed her surname to Marsh-Caldwell by royal licence. She died at Linley Wood on 5 October 1874.<br>
