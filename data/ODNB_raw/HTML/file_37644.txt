<span class="headword">Koops,  Matthias</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1789&#150;1805), <span class="occ">paper manufacturer</span>, was born in Pomerania, the son of Matthias and Katharine Dorothea Koops, both also of Pomerania. Very little is known of his early life, though he stated that he had &#145;for several years served in different distinguished military characters, under the late Emperor of Germany, and King of Prussia&#146;. By 1789 Koops was in England. On 12 September his marriage to Elizabeth Jane Austin (<i>d</i>. 1815) took place in London. His application for naturalization was accepted on 1 April 1790 and in June, as a merchant of Edmonton, Koops was made bankrupt. He eventually capitalized on his knowledge of Europe by publishing in 1796 both a set of five maps of the Rhine, Meuse, and Scheldt, and a survey entitled <span class="italic">A Developement of the Views and Designs of the French Nation</span>, which sought to warn the English of certain French activities. In the following year Koops set up the Minerva Universal Insurance Office in Pall Mall, Westminster. This enterprise lasted less than a year.<br>
<br>Koops then became interested in the long-standing problem of making paper from materials other than linen and cotton. His work on it led him to prove that paper made from straw, wood, and recycled waste paper could be produced commercially; this achievement earns him a place in the history of paper making. By 1800 Koops had experience of manufacturing from waste paper at Neckinger mill in Bermondsey, and in 1800&#150;01 three patents were granted to him: one for extracting inks from printed and written paper before pulping, and the other two for making paper fit for printing from straw, hay, thistles, waste, and refuse of hemp and flax. In 1800 his <span class="italic">Historical Account of the Substances which have been Used to Describe Events</span> was printed on straw paper.<br>
<br>Having proved the possibility of making good paper from such materials, Koops set up a company, the Straw Paper Manufactory, raised over &pound;70,000 by issue of shares, and in 1801 erected a paper-making mill at Millbank in Westminster. Contractors for the machinery included John Rennie, the engineer, and the firm of Boulton and Watt. This paper mill was easily the largest in the country. The enterprise, however, was over-ambitious and under-capitalized. Koops himself was the principal shareholder in the venture and on the strength of this offered to satisfy his creditors. His failure to discharge his bankruptcy by 1802 compelled Koops's creditors to issue a writ, <i>inter alia</i>, for seizure of the Straw Paper Manufactory's assets, and in the end its proprietors could not keep the enterprise solvent. The Millbank paper mill and its equipment were eventually offered for sale by auction in October 1804, thereby ending the possibility of England challenging the European paper industry by using more easily available materials for making paper. Koops himself, optimistic to the end, is last heard of in 1805 soliciting subscriptions for his river maps; his widow died in 1815.<br>
