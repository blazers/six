<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kenrick,  Daniel</span>  (<em>b. </em>1649/50), <span class="occ">poet and physician</span>, the son of Samuel Kenrick (<i>b</i>. 1602/3), rector of St Mary de Crypt, Gloucester, was born in Gloucestershire, matriculated aged sixteen at Christ Church, Oxford, on 30 May 1666, took his BA in 1670, became MA in 1674, and was later vicar of Kempsey in Worcestershire. His brother Christian was educated at New Hall, Oxford (BA 1679), and later took up the position of vicar of Eckington, Worcestershire, in 1681. It appears that Daniel Kenrick also practised as a physician in Worcester for some time. Kenrick's reputation rests on the poems collected in <span class="italic">The Grove</span> (1721), which also includes some biographical information:<blockquote>Dr Kenrick took his degrees both in Divinity and Physick, and being a Person of Vivacity and wit, entertain'd his Leisure Hours in Poetical Compositions. His Talents seem equal in Panegyrick, satire, and Lyric: There is a Fire and Sprightliness of Thinking which runs thro' all his Copies, and to this, perhaps, he ow'd that haste in his Writing, which made him sometimes negligent of Harmony both in Rhimes and Numbers.</blockquote>Kenrick had a wide circle of friends including Aphra Behn and Henry Purcell. Some of his work is closely associated with Henry Hall, and it is likely that Kenrick was a high-churchman, and perhaps, Jacobite sympathizer. This would account for the sermon of 1688 (though a difficult attribution to prove beyond all doubt), the argument of which was developed from <span class="roman">Romans</span> 31.1, &#145;Let every Soul be Subject to the Higher Powers&#146;. It is divided into the following arguments:<blockquote>
<div>I. &#145;Of the Necessity of our Subjection to the Higher Powers: And then more particularly.&#146;<br>
</div>
<div>II. &#145;Of the strick Obedience we owe to the higher Powers, or the Kings of this Realm.&#146;<br>
</div>
<div>III. &#145;Of the Reasonableness of our Obedience to the King in the present juncture of Affairs.&#146;<br>
</div>
</blockquote>According to Kenrick, religion was for some:<blockquote>the specious Cry, when alas all his Religion is either Pride, Interest, Revenge for lost Honour, or a wild humour for innovation. For 'tis utterly impossible that any Man can have a serious awe of his Maker &hellip; and disturb the Peace of the Kingdom in which he lives. (Kenrick, <span class="italic">Sermon</span>)</blockquote>It is a skilfully argued sermon which follows a basically tory stance, yet seeks a religious and political tolerance for Catholics. Kenrick's sermon should be read in the context of the fears concerning the potential for Catholic monarchy and attendant political resurgency in England, which occupied Kenrick's years as a priest, following James II's <span class="italic">His Majesty's Gracious Declaration to All his Loving Subjects for Liberty of Conscience</span>, issued on 4 April 1687. This allowed Catholics to reassume public office, and permitted them the freedom of religious assembly. Many Anglicans were repulsed by James's use of the royal prerogative to appoint Catholics to positions in the army and the universities. In conclusion Kenrick asks &#145;Are we afraid of Popery?&#146;:<blockquote>The King assures us, 'Tis possible to be happy, without being pernicious &hellip; Tho seeming clouds appear, let our Fears and Jealousies be laid aside, and fear no Darkness, since God and the King say, <i>Let there be Light</i>. (ibid.)</blockquote>Kenrick's reputation as a poet rests on work published in <span class="italic">The Grove</span>, though other poems can be found in manuscript (Harvard UL, MS Eng. 614). As a whole, <span class="italic">The Grove</span> contains work stretching over a considerable period of time. Kenrick's most widely known work is &#145;A New Session of Poets. Occasion'd by the Death of Mr John Dryden&#146;, first published in the year of Dryden's death, 1700. It is a playful piece which names many contemporary poets as successors to Dryden, yet finds fault with all of them when judged against Dryden's towering stature. Apollo, called upon as judge, returns to heaven saying:<blockquote>
<div>Ye sons of Wit, 'tis by your God decreed,<br>
</div>
<div>Till One arise to match the mighty Dead,<br>
</div>
<div>The Wreath shall stay on the De Facto's Head.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>There was, however, a sting in the tail since Dryden was criticized for having attempted to consider religion in <span class="italic">The Hind and the Panther</span> (1687). Kenrick's other work found in <span class="italic">The Grove</span> is mostly devoted to his muse Sylvia, one of which, &#145;Upon Visiting Sylvia, on her Death-Bed, as her Physician. An Ode&#146; is a rare, perhaps dramatized, reference to his professional life.<br>
