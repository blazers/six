<div class="para">
<span class="headword">FitzGerald <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Purcell]</span>,  Edward</span>  (1809&#150;1883), <span class="occ">writer and translator</span>, was born on 31 March 1809 at the White House (later known as Bredfield House), between Bredfield village and the town of Woodbridge in Suffolk, the seventh of eight children and the youngest of three sons of John Purcell (1775&#150;1852), country gentleman and MP, and his wife, Mary Frances (1779&#150;1855), the daughter of the wealthy Irish landowner John FitzGerald and his wife, Mary. His parents were first cousins and both came from wealthy Irish families. On his mother's side he was descended from the earls of Kildare. In 1818 his mother inherited her father's fortune and the family changed its name to FitzGerald; Edward disliked his new name, saying in later life that he found it &#145;distasteful&#146;  (Martin, 23).<br>
<br>FitzGerald's father, usually described as ineffectual and impractical, trained as a lawyer but never practised. In his later years, he made an unfortunate investment in a mine near Manchester which resulted in his bankruptcy. This did not affect his wife's fortune, however, and thus did not cause much more than inconvenience for Edward, who all his life had enough money not to have to work for a living.<br>
<br>FitzGerald's mother is often described as a beauty, but FitzGerald himself said she looked like the duke of Wellington  (Martin, 29). Commentators usually describe her as imperious and lacking in affection for her family. FitzGerald once said of her: &#145;My Mother used to come up sometimes [to the nursery], and we Children were not much comforted&#146;  (Terhune, 7). She and her husband increasingly lived apart, and for many years it was FitzGerald's duty to escort her to the opera and the theatre and to attend her at formal dinners.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlyworks"></a>Education and early works</h2>FitzGerald was educated first at a private school in Woodbridge. When the family moved to France for two years (1816&#150;18) he was taught French, fencing, and dancing by private tutors, and was said to be &#145;a beautiful dancer&#146;  (Terhune, 10). In France the family lived first at St Germain-en-Laye and then in Paris in a house in the rue d'Angoul&ecirc;me that had reportedly been occupied by Robespierre. On the family's return from France, FitzGerald was sent to King Edward VI Grammar School in Bury St Edmunds, which was notable at the time for its emphasis on English literature and composition. In 1826 he proceeded to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he showed little interest in mathematics and the rest of the required curriculum, instead devoting himself to studying literature. He befriended William Makepeace Thackeray and also several members of the Cambridge Apostles, but never became a member himself. He did join the musical society Camus at Cambridge, and throughout his life he enjoyed playing the piano and the organ as well as singing; he also composed music and arranged works by others.<br>
<br>Although he took only an ordinary degree and did not distinguish himself academically, finishing 106th in his class, FitzGerald enjoyed the intellectual camaraderie of undergraduate life so much that for several years after he graduated he returned each year to Cambridge to spend up to a term in his old lodgings at 19 King's Parade. Indeed, for much of his life, despite his wealth FitzGerald tended to live in rented lodgings, usually being content with two rooms: one to sleep in and one&#151;containing a disorganized mass of books, papers, and paintings&#151;which served as a study.<br>
<br>Between 1830, when he graduated from Cambridge, and 1837 FitzGerald lived the life of a &#145;genteel gipsy&#146;  (Terhune, 38) with no real fixed address. He lived some of the time in lodgings in London so he could attend his mother, and spent the rest of his time in Cambridge, at his sister's house at Geldestone Hall in Norfolk, at the homes of friends, and at his family's new residence, Wherstead Lodge, near Ipswich, which they had moved into in 1825.<br>
<br>In 1831 FitzGerald anonymously published a poem, &#145;The Meadows in Spring&#146;; it appeared in two separate publications, <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> and William Hone's <span class="italic">Year Book</span>, and was praised by Charles Lamb. However, despite this promising start, FitzGerald wrote only a few more original poems throughout the rest of his life, saying:<blockquote>I know that I could write volume after volume as well as others of the mob of gentlemen who write with ease: but I think unless a man can do better, he had best not do at all; I have not the strong inward call &hellip; (Jewett, 38)</blockquote>In 1837, two years after the family moved from Wherstead Lodge to Boulge Hall, near Bredfield village, FitzGerald moved into the nearby Boulge Cottage, where he stayed for the next sixteen years; he still, however, spent much of his time wandering around England visiting friends and relatives. In 1842 FitzGerald visited one of his family's estates, Naseby Wooleys, in Northamptonshire, site of the battle of Naseby, in part to do research for a new friend, Thomas Carlyle, who was investigating the battle for his book on Oliver Cromwell. FitzGerald corrected an error Carlyle had made about the location of the battle and had some soldiers' graves dug up on the battlefield; he sent Carlyle some teeth and a bone.<br>
<br>In 1849, on the death of his friend the &#145;Quaker poet&#146; Bernard Barton, FitzGerald prepared an edition of Barton's works along with a prefatory memoir. In 1851 he published an original prose composition, <span class="italic">Euphranor</span>, a philosophical dialogue about education in which he argued for a balance between academic and athletic pursuits, and in 1852 he published <span class="italic">Polonius</span>, a collection of aphorisms taken from the works of other authors.<br>
<br>Inspired by his friend Edward Cowell, a self-taught linguist, FitzGerald began studying Spanish about 1850, and by 1853 he was proficient enough to publish a translation of six dramas by Calder&oacute;n. Usually insisting on anonymity, FitzGerald allowed his name to appear on the title-page to distinguish his translation from another appearing at the same time; this was the only time he allowed his name to appear on any of his publications. FitzGerald's book came in for criticism for its very free translation, something FitzGerald himself openly admitted. His policy in this and later translations was not to aim for a literal rendering but to create an English equivalent in the spirit of the original. &#145;I suppose very few People have ever taken such pains in Translation as I have&#146;, he wrote, &#145;though certainly not to be literal. But at all Cost, a Thing must <i>live</i>: with a transfusion of one's own worse Life if one can't retain the Original's better. Better a live Sparrow than a stuffed Eagle&#146;  (Martin, 204).<h2>
<a name="TheRubiyt"></a>The Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t</h2>In 1852 Cowell introduced FitzGerald to Persian, and by 1854 FitzGerald was at work on a translation of J&aacute;m&iacute;'s allegorical Persian poem <span class="italic">Sal&aacute;m&aacute;n and Abs&aacute;l</span>, which he arranged to have printed at his own expense in 1856. Also in 1856 Cowell introduced FitzGerald to a collection of quatrains (or <i>rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t</i>) attributed to the eleventh-century Persian poet &#145;Umar Khayyam. FitzGerald found himself attracted to them, declaring himself to be &#145;akin&#146; to Omar; he even used the signature Edward FitzOmar at least once  (Jewett, 79, 92).<br>
<br>Wright has suggested that FitzGerald was drawn to Omar because of the agnosticism in his verses  (Wright, 2.15). Though a member of the Church of England, FitzGerald often expressed doubts about religion, and in his later years rarely attended church. It has also been suggested that FitzGerald was attracted by the hedonism and the melancholy in the original (Benson, 114&#150;15; Jewett 158). FitzGerald himself said the verses expressed an &#145;Epicurean Pathos&#146;, adding that they embodied an attitude that could be summed up by the statement, &#145;Drink&#151;for the Moon will often come round to look for us in this Garden and find us not&#146;  (Terhune, 204).<br>
<br>Early in 1858 FitzGerald sent thirty-five of the &#145;less wicked&#146; verses he had translated from Omar to <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span>  (Terhune, 205). <span class="italic">Fraser's</span> would not publish them, however, so in 1859, after adding forty more verses, FitzGerald issued the collection of seventy-five as a book published anonymously at his own expense. This first edition of <span class="italic">The Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t of Omar Khayy&aacute;m</span> did not sell well at first, but in 1861 Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Algernon Swinburne discovered it and helped to make it better known. This led to the publication of a second edition (1868), which especially won favour in the United States, where it was reviewed in glowing terms by Charles Eliot Norton. Soon there was, as FitzGerald put it, &#145;a little <i>Craze</i>&#146; over the <span class="italic">Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t</span> in America  (ibid., 209). By the 1870s rumours about the <span class="italic">Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t</span>'s authorship were confirmed, and FitzGerald was upset when his publisher Bernard Quaritch made his identity known in an advertisement in 1875.<br>
<br>FitzGerald produced four editions of the <span class="italic">Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t</span> altogether, continuing to add and subtract stanzas and to refine his language (the only two fragments extant of any <span class="italic">Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t</span> manuscript are in the Rosenbach Museum and Library, Philadelphia). The last edition in his lifetime, in 1879, contained 101 stanzas and most of the work's best-known lines, such as:<blockquote>
<div>The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,<br>
</div>
<div>Moves on<br>
</div>
</blockquote>and<blockquote>
<div>A Book of Verses underneath the Bough,<br>
</div>
<div>A Jug of Wine, a Loaf of Bread&#151;and Thou.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>There has been much discussion of how much of the <span class="italic">Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t</span> is FitzGerald and how much Omar. One study demonstrated that about half of the stanzas paraphrase specific stanzas in the Persian manuscripts, another 45 per cent are, as FitzGerald put it, two or more stanzas &#145;mashed up&#146; into one  (Terhune, 229), and the rest are more generally inspired by Omar's poetry, other Persian poetry, and FitzGerald's own ideas. FitzGerald did not use all the stanzas available to him, and he imposed order on the ones he did use, creating a narrative pattern that moves from morning to night, a pattern not seen in the original. The result is generally seen as being in some ways an original English poem, one that is much better known than Omar's poem is in Persian.<h2>
<a name="Marriageandlaterlife"></a>Marriage and later life</h2>On 4 November 1856, when he was just beginning to study &#145;Umar Khayyam's poetry, the 47-year-old FitzGerald married Lucy Barton (1808?&#150;1898), writer and governess, and daughter of his old friend <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1595/', "Bernard Barton")</script>. The marriage seems to have come about as a result of Bernard Barton's deathbed request that FitzGerald look after Lucy. However, she and FitzGerald, though about the same age, were incompatible in character: FitzGerald lived an unconventional, somewhat isolated life in rural Suffolk, while his wife wished for the conventional high society life which FitzGerald had known and rejected in his youth. They were &#145;very differently complexioned and educated&#146;, he said  (Terhune, 196), and too set in their different ways. The tone was set at the wedding, for which FitzGerald refused to dress up, and at which almost his only words were an expression of disgust when offered some blancmange. &#145;Ugh!&#146; he said, &#145;congealed bridesmaid&#146;  (Martin, 193). The marriage was a complete disaster and lasted less than a year, ending in separation.<br>
<br>FitzGerald's biographers agree that he felt no physical or emotional attraction for Lucy. Terhune says that FitzGerald's true love was Elizabeth Charlesworth, a woman he had known in his twenties and who later married his friend Cowell  (Terhune, 138&#150;40). There is one story that when Cowell told him he was marrying Elizabeth, FitzGerald replied, &#145;The deuce you are! Why, you have taken my Lady!&#146;  (ibid., 138). He also said Elizabeth &#145;would have been my Poetry if I had had wit enough&#146;  (ibid., 140). It has also been suggested that FitzGerald was in love at various times with two other young women: Mary Lynn of Aldeburgh, whom he knew in his teens, and Caroline Crabbe, the granddaughter of the poet George Crabbe and daughter of FitzGerald's friend George Crabbe, the vicar of Bredfield.<br>
<br>On the other hand, Havelock Ellis, in his book <span class="italic">Sexual Inversion</span>, said FitzGerald was one in whom &#145;it is easy to trace an element of homosexuality&#146;  (Ellis, 50), and his later biographer Martin strongly suggests that FitzGerald's passions were directed primarily towards young men, notably William K. Browne, Joseph (&#145;Posh&#146;) Fletcher, and to a lesser extent Cowell. FitzGerald sometimes embarrassed his friends with his enthusiastic praise for Browne. After Browne's death in a riding accident in 1859, FitzGerald frequented the fishing village of Lowestoft in Suffolk and, as he put it, &#145;used to wander about the shore at night looking for some fellow to accost me who might give some promise of filling up a very vacant place in my heart&#146;  (Martin, 216). Eventually, he befriended Fletcher, a sailor half his age, and provided him with financial backing in a herring fishery business.<br>
<br>FitzGerald spent a good deal of time in his later years among the sailors of Suffolk, seeing them as &#145;the old English Stuff&#146;, much superior to the &#145;decayed Race&#146; found in London  (Terhune, 241). He admired their way of speaking so much that he wrote articles about their dialect. He also hired them to take him out on his boat, the <i>Scandal</i>, one of his favourite activities: he would lie on deck reading Dante or Homer while the sailors worked. At least one time he was so immersed in his reading that he failed to notice the boom shifting and was swept overboard.<br>
<br>FitzGerald was a tall man, stooped a bit in later life and balding, though with a fringe of long grey hair; he typically walked about wearing a plaid shawl and an old tall hat, and was described as having a melancholy expression. His eyesight began deteriorating fairly early in his life, and he often hired boys to read to him; one such incident of being read to during a time of drought, as described by A. C. Benson  (Benson, 142), gave T. S. Eliot the inspiration for the opening of his poem &#145;Gerontion&#146;, about the<blockquote>
<div class="indent">old man in a dry month,<br>
</div>
<div>Being read to by a boy, waiting for rain.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>For most of his life he kept to a vegetarian diet, subsisting mostly on bread and fruit, and he was seen by his Suffolk neighbours as rather eccentric.<br>
<br>FitzGerald was also something of a curmudgeon, complaining about social and literary decline, and full of what his friends called &#145;crotchets&#146;  (Terhune, 118). He could be quite caustic about the literary works of his friends and of others, for instance saying that Alfred Tennyson, who had been his friend since the 1830s and dedicated &#145;Tiresias&#146; to him, should have &#145;left King Arthur alone &hellip; instead of turning him into Prince Albert&#146; in <span class="italic">Idylls of the King</span>  (Martin, 257). He also said Tennyson's <span class="italic">In Memoriam</span> seemed to have been written by a &#145;Poetical Machine&#146;  (Terhune, 126), and he fell asleep when Tennyson read him <span class="italic">The Princess</span>.<br>
<br>FitzGerald's most notorious literary comment was directed at a writer he did not know personally: Elizabeth Barrett Browning. When she died, he wrote in a letter: &#145;Mrs. Browning's Death is rather a relief to me, I must say: no more Aurora Leighs, thank God!&#146;  (Terhune, 255). When Robert Browning read this in FitzGerald's posthumously published correspondence, he wrote an angry poem in response.<br>
<br>After years of living in rented lodgings in and around Woodbridge in Suffolk, FitzGerald finally moved in his last decade into his own house, Little Grange, in Woodbridge. In his later years FitzGerald translated Aeschylus's <span class="italic">Agamemnon</span>, issued privately and then published anonymously in 1876. A few years before his death he completed translations of Sophocles's <span class="italic">Oedipus tyrannus</span> and <span class="italic">Oedipus Coloneus</span>, as well as translating two more dramas by Calder&oacute;n. But none of these translations matched his achievement in the <span class="italic">Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t</span>. His work on Calder&oacute;n did, however, earn him a medal from the Spanish Royal Academy in 1881. In 1882 he published <span class="italic">Readings in Crabbe</span>, an abridged version of the <span class="italic">Tales of the Hall</span>.<br>
<br>FitzGerald never entirely gave up his &#145;genteel gipsy&#146; wanderings, and it is perhaps fitting that he died away from home, while visiting his friends the Crabbes in Merton, in Norfolk. He died in his sleep on 14 June 1883, of heart disease, having previously been suffering from bronchitis. He was buried in Boulge churchyard on 19 June 1883, and left the bulk of his money to his nieces and nephews.<h2>
<a name="Historicalsignificance"></a>Historical significance</h2>FitzGerald produced only a small body of literary work, leading some commentators to say he did not fulfil his potential, out of indolence, lack of confidence, or lack of direction; Benson called him &#145;a practised craftsman without a subject&#146;, at least until he discovered &#145;Umar Khayyam  (Benson, 96). FitzGerald himself said: &#145;I have been all my life apprentice to this heavy business of idleness&#146;  (Terhune, 94). FitzGerald also called himself &#145;one of the &#147;most translatingest&#148; men alive&#146;  (Martin, 275), and much of the work he did produce consisted of translations, adaptations, or editions. His collected writings were edited by W. Aldis Wright, with selections from his letters, in 1889; further collections of correspondence followed in 1895 and 1901. A four-volume collection edited by Alfred McKinley appeared in 1980. FitzGerald's correspondence has been generally praised for its stylishness and interesting observations. Martin has even called it his greatest literary achievement, though that prize is usually awarded to the <span class="italic">Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t</span>.<br>
<br>Although praised for his letters and his friendships, FitzGerald is still remembered primarily for the <span class="italic">Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t</span>, which stands out from all his other works: the Persian verses struck a chord with him, and his English adaptation of them in turn struck a chord with generations of readers. One commentator says all his other translations and editions &#145;seem quite unrelated to the warmth, the ecstasy and burning imagery of the Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t&#146;  (Polnay, 211). The <span class="italic">Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t</span> became increasingly popular after FitzGerald's death, perhaps because its &#145;poignant sadness&#146; and &#145;Oriental fabric&#146; appealed to readers living in a time of &#145;outworn faith and restless dissatisfaction&#146;  (Benson, 97). One commentator has called it &#145;the most popular verse translation into English ever made&#146;  (Decker, xiv), and another has said that with its &#145;combination of deep truth and lyrical beauty&#146; the <span class="italic">Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t</span> seems certain to assure FitzGerald &#145;a prominent place among the immortals of English literature&#146;  (Jewett, 159, 157).<br>
