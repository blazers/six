<span class="headword">Ramsay <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Venniker]</span>,  Margaret Francesca <span class="st"> [Peggy]</span></span>  (1908&#150;1991), <span class="occ">play agent</span>, was born on 27 May 1908 in Bank Street, Molong, New South Wales, Australia, the first of the two children of John Charles (Jack) Venniker (1869&#150;1958), doctor and army officer, and Annie Rhoda, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Adams (1882&#150;1963), known as Nancy, who were on a trip abroad when Peggy was born. Her parents were both English but had emigrated to South Africa, where Jack converted from Judaism to Christianity and changed his surname from Velenski. Peggy's brother, Tony (1921&#150;1989), became a popular radio doctor in South Africa. Peggy attended the Collegiate School, Port Elizabeth, Girton School, Johannesburg, and Rhodes University, Grahamstown, where she studied zoology, botany, English, and psychology but left within a year without completing her BSc. Nine months later, on 29 September 1927, she married&#151;disastrously&#151;the university's senior lecturer in psychology, (Charles) Norman Matheson Ramsay (<i>b</i>. 1891), and the following year they left for England. The marriage collapsed as soon as they arrived and Peggy Ramsay had to start a new life from scratch.<br>
<br>It was like the story-books Ramsay had avidly devoured in the Great Karoo: she took singing lessons, joined a touring opera company, and then turned to acting. She had many affairs, and in the cast of one production she met matin&eacute;e idol William Roderick, who later lived with her and took care of all her domestic arrangements for the final three decades of her life. She stumbled on the path that would ultimately lead her to becoming Britain's most powerful play agent when, in 1945, she became the director Hugh Hunt's right-hand woman at the newly created Bristol Old Vic Theatre. She helped him in many tasks, including that of choosing the repertory, and so began her move away from performing towards being a &#145;backstage&#146; influence. In the early 1950s, with two others, she briefly ran the west London Q Theatre, one of the capital's leading little theatres, and there developed her interest in new plays while demonstrating a rare ability to judge a script on the page.<br>
<br>Disillusioned with acting, Ramsay was reading plays for several theatre managers, and when it became apparent to friends that she had recommended a number of West End successes but without receiving any commission, they offered to set her up in her own play agency. After an initial refusal, she agreed and by the end of 1953 had founded Margaret Ramsay Ltd in a converted brothel in Goodwin's Court, one of the oldest alleyways in the city of Westminster, off St Martin's Lane. Her immediate problem was to find clients; she represented playwrights she knew from her play-reading days and took on the then little known Romanian-French absurdist Eug&egrave;ne Ionesco when he left his previous agent. She built a reputation for herself quickly because of her unconventional and uncompromising behaviour. (She was known to shock many a prospective client by pointing to the chaise longue on which they were sitting and declaiming, &#145;That's where Ionesco fucked me.&#146;)<br>
<br>Writers and their art came first, before managers, directors, actors, and even the writers' partners and families. Although Ramsay enjoyed the cut-and-thrust of negotiating and the gamble of the box office, the business side of the firm was secondary. She would turn work down for clients&#151;often without recourse to the playwrights themselves&#151;if she felt it was not right for them. Developing talent was what ignited her, and she was a practical yet hard taskmistress. The first writer to come to prominence through her &#145;tough love&#146; was Robert Bolt, whom she first met when he was a teacher writing radio dramas. She tackled the structural shortcomings of his writing and after several efforts which she rejected she secured an Oxford Playhouse production of one of his plays. This was followed by his triumphant West End d&eacute;but, <span class="italic">Flowering Cherry</span> (1957). Ironically, the commercial success of this and subsequent of his plays such as <span class="italic">A Man for All Seasons</span> (1960) secured the future of the agency, allowing Ramsay's anti-materialistic approach to flourish and make its unique contribution to British playwriting.<br>
<br>Ramsay was a confidante of the director Peter Hall from the mid-1950s when he was running the Arts Theatre and sought her advice about the author of <span class="italic">Waiting for Godot</span>, the English-language premi&egrave;re of which he was about to direct, through his creation of the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) to his stewardship of the National Theatre (NT) which he invited her&#151;unsuccessfully&#151;to join as his literary manager. Her clients John Whiting and David Rudkin featured in the early RSC repertory and Howard Brenton, David Hare, Edward Bond, Alan Ayckbourn, and Stephen Poliakoff were prominent at the NT, a list that reveals her catholic taste which could embrace John Arden as well as Willy Russell. She enjoyed a close and long association with Britain's main new writing theatre, the Royal Court, which promoted numerous clients of hers, such as Ann Jellicoe, Christopher Hampton, and Caryl Churchill. In commercial theatre she found a kindred spirit in the producer Michael Codron; among her clients whose work he presented were John Mortimer, Henry Livings, Frank Marcus, Charles Wood, James Saunders, David Mercer, and Joe Orton, who, through his infamous death at the hand of his male lover, was the most notorious of her prot&eacute;g&eacute;s. Ramsay figures in the film based on Orton's diaries, <span class="italic">Prick up your Ears</span> (1987), played by Vanessa Redgrave, and in 1999 she was brought to life by Maureen Lipman in the play <span class="italic">Peggy for you</span>, written by her client Alan Plater. Several of her authors used aspects of her personality in the make-up of their own fictional characters, most notably Marion in Ayckbourn's <span class="italic">Absurd Person Singular</span> (1972), Valentina Nrovka in Hare's <span class="italic">The Bay at Nice</span> (1986), and Nancy Fraser in Peter Nichols's <span class="italic">A Piece of my Mind</span> (1987). In recognition of the wider impact of her writers, the British Film Institute in 1984 gave her an award for her contribution to the film and television industries.<br>
<br>A swift and cutting intelligence combined with excoriating candour, legendary indiscretion, and a swooping voice that could deliver wisdom and profanity in equal measure made Ramsay's presence as formidable as it was alluring. She <i>was</i> the firm, and, battling through Alzheimer's disease, she went to work every day until shortly before her death at a central London hospital on 4 September 1991 at the age of eighty-three. She was cremated at Golders Green on 10 September.<br>
<br>Ramsay's executors used her wealth to establish the Peggy Ramsay Foundation to nurture new playwriting. With Ramsay gone, the agency merged with another and finally moved out of Goodwin's Court, nearly forty years after this idiosyncratic, indefatigable lady with piercing, hawk-like eyes, a gangling, lolloping walk, and a fondness for flowing hats had taken a gamble there that turned her dilapidated offices festooned with posters of clients' successes into one of the most influential addresses in the British theatrical landscape.<br>
