<span class="headword">Irby,  (Adeline) Paulina</span>  (1831&#150;1911), <span class="occ">traveller and Balkan sympathizer</span>, was the youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14444/', "Rear-Admiral the Hon. Frederick Paul Irby (1779&#150;1844)")</script> of Long Stratton, Norfolk, and his second wife, Frances Wright (<i>d</i>. 1852), daughter of Ichabod Wright of Mapperley Hall, Nottinghamshire; she was the granddaughter of the second Baron Boston. Her long life, as traveller, relief worker, educationist, and Serbian patriot, was shaped by two events, one personal&#151;she was arrested as a spy in 1859&#151;the other of public concern&#151;the &#145;Bulgarian atrocities&#146; of 1876. In the first incident, she and her companion, Georgina Muir Mackenzie, while travelling in the Austrian Carpathians, were accused of showing &#145;pan-Slavistic tendencies&#146;. Neither understood the term, knowing little of the Slav nationalities in Europe. In the next four years they remedied that ignorance through extensive journeys across Turkey in Europe, examining the conditions of the south Slavs, talking to Turkish authorities, and discussing the position and education of Christian women and girls. The evidence they obtained convinced them of Turkish misrule and made them advocates of Serbia and the south Slavs. They reported on their travels in some articles and speeches, and finally in 1867 in <span class="italic">The Turks, the Greeks and the Slavons: Travels in the Slavonic Provinces of Turkey-in-Europe</span>, a substantial and authoritative publication.<br>
<br>In 1865 Paulina Irby and Georgina Muir Mackenzie established an association to promote education among the Slavonic Christians, appealing for funds to set up a training school for Bosnian girls. The school was opened in Sarajevo, and in 1871 Paulina Irby, with a new companion, Priscilla Johnston (the granddaughter of the first Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, the anti-slavery leader, of Northrepps, Norfolk), took over its management. The pattern of her life, nine months in Sarajevo followed by a summer of recuperation and fund-raising in England, was broken in 1875 by the uprising of the Christian population. She closed the school and set up a relief fund for Bosnian refugees fleeing into Austrian Slavonia, undertaking food distribution and the establishment of schools for refugee children. By June 1876 seven schools were operating, and 3000 women and children had been fed, clothed, and vaccinated. She was in England in July 1876 when the &#145;Bulgarian atrocities&#146; agitation swept the country: Turkish misrule and the condition of its subject Christian nationalities became the focus of public debate and practical action. Her relief fund was one among many that benefited from the generosity of the British public; she was recognized as an expert on Turkish matters, and relatives and influential friends, including Florence Nightingale, became active on behalf of the fund. References were made to her in parliament, and W. E. Gladstone wrote the introduction to the second edition of <span class="italic">Travels</span> (published in 1877).<br>
<br>During 1877 and 1878 in Dalmatia and Slavonia, Paulina Irby continued to administer relief, establishing twenty-one schools for 2000 pupils and distributing food, clothes, and pickaxes (for road building). Vivid descriptions of her work, written by Arthur Evans, appeared in the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>. Under the Berlin Congress of June 1878 Austria was given the mandate of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but the Austrian authorities were reluctant, because of her Serbian sympathies, to grant permission for her return to Sarajevo. Finally, in June 1879, the school was reopened. After Priscilla Johnston returned to England in 1885, Paulina Irby continued to maintain the school, which remained small, for Orthodox Christian girls only, an increasing number of whom were Slav and Serbian. Edith Durham, visiting in 1906, believed the school was the centre of the pro-Serb party. On 15 September 1911 Paulina Irby died, and her death was an occasion for public mourning in Belgrade as well as Sarajevo. As she had requested, her letters and papers were destroyed, but her work for the south Slav people became a legend. On the occasion of the centenary of her birth (postponed to 1934) there were celebrations throughout Yugoslavia in her honour. For some years there was an annual commemoration at her gravestone in Sarajevo of the day in June 1914 when the shot was fired that started the First World War.<br>
