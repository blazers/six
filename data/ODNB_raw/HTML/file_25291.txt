<span class="headword">Sheres, Sir  Henry</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1641, <em>d.</em> 1710), <span class="occ">military engineer and author</span>, was baptized on 17 June 1641 at St Nicholas's, Deptford Green, a son of Henry Sheres (<i>d</i>. in or after 1675) of Deptford, a captain in the interregnum navy, and his wife, Susan Pelly (<i>b</i>. 1613). His early years are unknown but in 1666 he went to Spain in the service of the ambassador-extraordinary Edward Montagu, earl of Sandwich, and was the &#145;trusty and ingenious&#146; messenger employed in September 1667 to carry back to England Sandwich's treaty with the Spanish. On his return to England he became acquainted with Pepys, who found him &#145;a good engenious man, but doth talk a little too much of his travels&#146;  (Pepys, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 8.444). In the following spring Pepys became jealous of Sheres's attentions to his wife, Elizabeth, despite his realization that his fears were groundless and that Sheres was &#145;a very civil and worthy man&#146;  (ibid., 9.533). Any potential conflict was averted when Sheres left for Tangier in May 1669. He had been employed in the previous autumn on surveying the fortifications and harbour there, and now became partly responsible for building the great breakwater or &#145;mole&#146; that was intended to turn the English colony into a great entrep&ocirc;t for Mediterranean trade. Sheres initially held the position of &#145;clerk examiner&#146; under the chief engineer, Sir Hugh Cholmley, and in 1669 travelled to Genoa to view the mole there, which he favoured as a model for that at Tangier.<br>
<br>Sheres returned briefly to England in 1675, where he became a fellow of the Royal Society. John Evelyn encountered him at a Royal Society dinner on 4 March; Sheres was evidently still fond of regaling others with tales of his travels, on this occasion holding forth on the subjects of scorpions, locusts, elephants, and chameleons. Damage to the mole over the winter of 1674&#150;5 discredited Cholmley, and Sheres's proposal for completing it by a different (and significantly cheaper) method, which relied on sinking large stone-filled chests, won official approval. Consequently he succeeded Cholmley as surveyor-general, and began work in July 1676. Despite shortages of money and incessant difficulties with the weather, the Moors, the technology, and his enemies in England and Tangier&#151;especially the disgruntled Cholmley and the local naval commander, Arthur Herbert&#151;Sheres gradually extended the mole to its final length of 479 yards. He played a key role during the siege of Tangier in 1680, organizing the artillery defences and subsequently rebuilding the fortifications.<br>
<br>Sheres also played a significant part in the counter-attack from Pole Fort on 27 October, &#145;a very hott and bloody piece of service&#146; in which Sheres was &#145;a principal instrument both by his valour and advice of the victory we obtained&#146;  (Routh, 194, 197). When the colony was evacuated in 1683 he wrote the report that condemned his own handiwork, the mole, and oversaw its demolition. Sheres was well aware of the charge of hypocrisy that might be levelled at him: when he showed Pepys his report, the latter commented that &#145;he did show me his foul draft of the ordinary objections made against the Mole improved the most he could to justify the King's destroying of it, though he did tell me privately that he is able to answer them all&#146;  (Chappell, 36&#150;7). By this time Sheres had established or restored a close friendship with Pepys, and had also gained the confidence of the navy's commander, Lord Dartmouth. Indeed in 1682 Pepys had recommended Sheres to Dartmouth in the most fulsome terms as a man possessing &#145;uprightness of mind, universality of knowledge in all useful learning, particularly mathematics, and of them those parts especially which relate to gunnery and fortifications&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and the Second Diary</span>, 144&#150;5).<br>
<br>In 1685 Sheres served with the artillery in the Sedgemoor campaign, but disliked the experience: he argued with other officers over the status and deployment of the artillery, and told Dartmouth that &#145;in plain English I have seen too much violence and wickedness practised to be fond of this trade &hellip; for what we every day practise among this poor people cannot be supported by any man of the least morality&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dartmouth MSS</span>, 3.126). Nevertheless he was rewarded in July with a knighthood and the position of surveyor of the ordnance. During the revolution of 1688 he was recovering from a serious illness, but on 1 November he assured James II that he was well enough to campaign and belatedly set off with an artillery train of 250 carriages, reaching Basingstoke by 14 November. He was regarded afterwards as a potential Jacobite, and was arrested twice, in June 1690 and February 1696. He was in Ireland in 1700; on 30 March he was appointed a trustee to regulate the king's Irish grants, and in March 1701 he was summoned to the House of Lords to explain the proceedings of the trustees. He received a ring at Pepys's funeral in 1703.<br>
<br>Sheres wrote extensively. He composed poetry (one of the attributes that had attracted Elizabeth Pepys to him) and translated some of the classics, especially Polybius and Lucian. He also published <span class="italic">A Discourse on the Mediterranean Sea</span> in 1703, in which he still bemoaned the loss of Tangier, &#145;a jewel fit only to adorn the crown that wears it, whose value I can better conceive than write&#146;  (Sheres, 20). Sheres edited for publication two works by Sir Walter Ralegh: <span class="italic">A Discourse on Seaports</span> (1700) and <span class="italic">An Essay on Ways and Means to Maintain the Honour of England</span> (1701). Several other discourses circulated only in manuscript: these included &#145;A discourse touching the decay of our naval discipline&#146; (1694), a damning indictment of faction-fighting, and &#145;Some directions for my Lord Nottingham's building&#146;, which included his thoughts on architecture.<br>
<br>By 1706&#150;7 Sheres was increasingly troubled by illness, particularly gout, and he died on 21 April 1710. He seems never to have married, but Pepys recorded that he had kept a mistress in Tangier. By his will, made in September 1709, he left &pound;1000 to his servant Martha Scarlett, and his library to Henry Overton of Trinity College, Oxford, the son of another former servant. His estate might have been greater if his own claims relating to the mole had been satisfied: in 1700 he calculated that he was still owed &pound;14,000 in arrears of salary and disbursements on stores from his time as surveyor-general. Pepys consulted him on many matters, from gunnery to Noah's Ark, and thought that in comparison with all the other engineers and gunners in England, &#145;Mr Sheres by his experience exceeds them all&#146;  (Chappell, 150).<br>
