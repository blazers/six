<span class="headword">Ostrogorski,  Moisei Yakovlevich</span>  (1854&#150;1919), <span class="occ">political analyst</span>, was born in Semicatrez, in the district of Bielsk, Grodno, in Belorussia, on 3 March 1854, the eldest of the three children of Yakolev Ostrogorski, who belonged to a landowning family of Jewish origin. He studied law at the University of St Petersburg and, after obtaining his degree, took up employment in the legislative department of the ministry of justice where, in 1882, he became head of department. In 1884 the authoritarianism that gripped Russia following the murder of Alexander II caused him to emigrate to France. In Paris he enrolled in the &Eacute;cole Libre des Sciences Politiques, the private university founded in 1871 by Emile Boutmy and Hippolyte Taine. Ostrogorski's Parisian period saw him passionately committed to democratic militancy in defence of Dreyfus but, above all, it marked the beginning of his career as an expert in public law. In 1892 his study, <span class="italic">Les femmes au point de vue du droit public</span>, was published in France, soon to be followed by translations published in England (<span class="italic">The Rights of Women: a Comparative Study in History and Legislation</span>, 1893) and Germany.<br>
<br>In 1887 Ostrogorski began his research into political parties, at first confining himself to American parties. In 1889, on the advice of James Bryce, whom he knew by correspondence, Ostrogorski went to London to extend his inquiry to British political parties. This was to be the first of a long series of visits to the United Kingdom, during which Ostrogorski stayed in a hotel in Russell Square, close to the British Museum, where he spent his days studying. Frequently he organized trips to areas outside London to round out his bibliographical research with direct observation of the new parties in operation and to ask questions of the organizers of the political machines. He concluded his research on Britain in 1895. The following year he went to the United States to observe American parties at first hand.<br>
<br>Preparation for the publication of this research lasted until December 1902, when Macmillan published <span class="italic">Democracy and the Organisation of Political Parties</span>, which was followed a few months later by a French edition. The work consisted of two volumes, the first on the subject of British parties and the second on American parties. It was the first book to be dedicated entirely to extra-parliamentary political parties. It aimed to show how the development of modern political machines would inevitably come into conflict with the principles and institutions of liberal democracies. The vicissitudes of the British parties had strengthened Ostrogorski's conviction of this. He maintained that, from the development of the caucus system in Birmingham in the 1870s, British parties had taken the same path as American parties. The caucus system, in Ostrogorski's view, severely diminished the role of the individual in politics: instead of a lively dispute about ideas and policies, organizations accompanied by material and moral corruption would predominate. To save democracy Ostrogorski proposed replacing the permanent parties with one-issue leagues which would unite individuals for a limited period on the basis of specific objectives. The collective life of the masses would thus be given merely short-term and non-constricting organization, compatible with the theory and practice of democratic liberalism. Ostrogorski's book was based on wide-ranging research in periodicals, newspapers, and local libraries, which makes it a fertile source of information. While his condemnation of the caucus seems exaggerated in the light of the twentieth-century party bureaucracies which succeeded it, many of his detailed observations of the British political system&#151;for example, the role of local government&#151;were, and remain, original.<br>
<br>On completion of his book, in March 1903 Ostrogorski returned to Russia. In 1906 he was elected to the first Duma&#151;the first experiment in representative institutions in Russia&#151;for the constituency of Grodno. In keeping with the ideas expressed in his academic works, he refused to belong to a party. However, he became a leading member of the Duma, and was influential on questions of constitutional law and parliamentary procedure. When the crisis of the first Duma took place in July 1906, he was in London as a member of the Russian delegation to the inter-parliamentary conference. He tried to get himself re-elected to the second Duma (February 1907) and the third (October 1907) as a representative of the opposition coalition, but he failed both times.<br>
<br>Political defeat brought Ostrogorski back to his studies, and his attention turned again to Britain. He had visited England in August 1905 to revise and update his analysis of British politics. On that occasion the fame of his researches won him the honorary title of temporary member of the National Liberal Club. He went back to England again in June 1908, in July 1909, and finally for a longer period in April 1910. He was convinced that in the years since his book had come out many things had changed in British politics and that his analysis needed radical revision, although he felt that his section on American politics was much more sound and still relevant. Therefore in 1910 he published <span class="italic">Democracy and the party system in the United States: a study in extra-constitutional government</span>, a revised and abbreviated version of the 1902 edition, exclusively concerned with American parties. The new research on the British situation became part of the French edition of 1912 entitled <span class="italic">La d&eacute;mocratie et les parties politiques</span>, which gave a revised and abbreviated version of the whole work. Ostrogorski examined the Labour Party at some length, whereas he had merely made passing reference to it in the 1902 edition, and made significant changes to his final assessment. In general, however, his interpretation was unchanged. He remained convinced that the extra-parliamentary parties had destroyed the classic constitutional balance, by destroying the model of virtue and temperance that European liberals had admired for so long. The details of this analysis were set out again in a series of four articles on the evolution of British institutions that he began to write in 1912 and which were published the following year in the Russian periodical, the <span class="italic">European Herald</span>, whose editor was the liberal jurist Maxime Kovalevski. Ostrogorski was invited to put the four articles together to form a book to be published in France, but, although tempted by the proposal, he declined because of his precarious health.<br>
<br>In September 1913 Ostrogorski was struck down with vascular thrombosis which paralysed the left side of his body. Despite a long and difficult convalescence he made a miraculous recovery. In 1916 he took up a post at the University of St Petersburg, teaching constitutional law. In the same year he put the four articles on Britain together into one volume, aimed at a Russian readership, under the title <span class="italic">Konstitutsionnaya evolyutsia Anglii</span> (&#145;The evolution of the British constitution&#146;). In the introduction he defined his objective once and for all: to declare Bagehot's classic analysis of the British system out of date from the moment the extra-parliamentary parties appeared. In Ostrogorski's view the new parties had destroyed the traditional balance and produced an intolerable supremacy of the executive over the other powers. The British model was thus rejected in favour of a system of assembly in which the theory of organized parties would not find room for manoeuvre. This was his last work. Moisei Ostrogorski died in Petrograd during 1919, although the exact date has been obscured by the revolution.<br>
