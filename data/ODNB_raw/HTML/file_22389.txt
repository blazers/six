<span class="headword">Plowden,  Edmund</span>  (<em>c.</em>1518&#150;1585), <span class="occ">law reporter</span>, was most probably born at Blunden Hall in Bishop's Castle, Shropshire. He was the eldest son of Humphrey Plowden (<i>d</i>. 1558), a local landowner, and his wife, Elizabeth Wollascot, daughter of John Sturry of Ross Hall, Shropshire. Virtually nothing is known about Plowden's upbringing and early education, or about the origins of the unwavering, but deeply private, adherence to the Catholic faith that was such a conspicuous feature of his life. He seems likely to have spent three years at Cambridge University without taking a degree, but Anthony Wood's assertion that he also studied medicine at Oxford is improbable. Although the dates of his admission to the Middle Temple and call to the bar are uncertain, by his own account Plowden began his legal education in 1538, tradition having it that he was so studious that he did not leave the inn once during the space of three years. He began recording cases he heard in court from at least 1550, the same year in which he gave law readings (on entails and replevins) at New Inn.<br>
<br>Having acted in a legal capacity for John Winchcombe in 1548 and become steward of his estate at Greenham in 1550, Plowden may already have begun establishing himself in Berkshire and Oxfordshire, where he later resided when not in London. His public career blossomed in the reign of Queen Mary, probably owing in part to his friendship with Sir Francis Englefield, who became a privy councillor and master of the court of wards in 1553. Plowden was appointed to the council in the marches of Wales in 1553, and was also made a member of the commission of the peace for Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Shropshire, and Worcestershire. He was returned for Wallingford to the parliament that assembled in October 1553, for Reading in November 1554, and for Wootton Bassett in 1555, the latter two being places where Englefield is known to have had influence. Plowden was one of a number of MPs against whom informations were laid for contempt for being absent without licence when the house was called in early January 1555. It has sometimes been argued that the accused MPs were protesting against the reintroduction of heresy laws, but the true cause of the incident remains obscure; in any case Plowden pleaded that he had not been absent, and the charges were eventually withdrawn. In 1557 he was raised to the bench and appointed autumn reader at the Middle Temple; his reading on dower was postponed to 1558. On the death of his father on 21 March 1558 he succeeded to the family estate at Plowden, Shropshire. In 1554 he had purchased, in conjunction with the London merchant, John White, other lands in Shropshire, including former monastic property at Lydbury North. On 27 October 1558 he received a writ calling him to the degree of serjeant-at-law in the following Easter term, but the writ abated with the death of Queen Mary, and it was not renewed by Queen Elizabeth.<br>
<br>The family tradition that Elizabeth once offered Plowden the office of lord chancellor if he would renounce Catholicism is probably unfounded, but it is a fair reflection of his reputation as a lawyer, despite the disabilities caused by his faith. His defence of Edmund Bonner, the deprived Marian bishop of London who refused the oath of supremacy, was sufficiently successful in calling into question the consecration of all the Elizabethan bishops that it required an act of parliament to remedy the defect. In 1566, and possibly at the instigation of the duke of Norfolk, Plowden wrote a well-known defence of the claim of Mary of Scotland to the throne of England. This argued that the English crown descended by inheritance, and since the maxims of the common law, which applied to natural bodies, did not apply to political bodies, Mary's foreign birth did not invalidate her claim. At the same time Plowden held that the crown of Scotland was historically &#145;in homage&#146; to the crown of England. Hence it was &#145;folly&#146; to suggest that Mary herself (as opposed to the Scots in general) was out of allegiance to, and therefore incapable of holding, the English throne. Referring to an opinion of Henry VII that was retailed by Polydore Vergil, he predicted that a Scottish succession would not lead to the oppression of England by Scotland, because the Scottish monarch would naturally be inclined to come to England, &#145;the head of the island&#146;. He made a point of praying that God would &#145;blesse oure Soueraigne quene Elizabeth with long lyffe and many Childerne&#146;, thereby rendering all his arguments unnecessary. He also noted that in &#145;silence there is saufftie but in speache there is perill and in wryting more&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 849, fols. 1<i>v</i>, 31<i>v</i>), and in general he appears to have been politically circumspect.<br>
<br>Plowden continued to hold office in the duchy of Lancaster, was on the Berkshire commission of the peace, and was appointed to the commission of sewers in 1567. He attended Church of England services until 1569, when, after some delay, he declared himself unable to sign a declaration that obliged justices of the peace to acknowledge their duty to observe the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span>, although the real sticking point for him was a requirement that he promise to attend services according to the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. He was obliged to enter into a bond for his good behaviour, but seems to have suffered no further difficulty, despite the fact that he ceased attending church, subsequently acted as counsel for known Catholics, and was regularly returned as a recusant during the government's periodic attempts to ferret out Catholics at the inns of court. Plowden was named a head burgess when Bishop's Castle, Shropshire, was granted its first charter in 1574, and he may have helped to secure the borough's parliamentary enfranchisement ten years later. He also continued to thrive as a lawyer and member of the Middle Temple. Having served as Lent reader in 1561, he was treasurer of the inn from 20 June 1561 until May 1567. In this capacity, and afterwards, he raised money and supervised the erection of a new hall, one of the windows of which contains his arms with an inscription to the effect that his great care had brought the work to completion for the benefit of all those who cultivated the laws.<br>
<br>In 1571 Plowden published <span class="italic">Les commentaries, ou, Les reportes &hellip; de divers cases &hellip; en les temps des raignes le Roy Ed. le size, le Roigne Mary, le Roy &amp; Roigne Philip &amp; Mary, &amp; le Roigne Elizabeth</span>, a volume of law reports that decisively broke out of the older year-book tradition, and was the first to be published by the author in his own lifetime and under his own name. The keys to Plowden's approach were two resolutions he claims to have made at the beginning of his law studies. The first was:<blockquote>[to] be present at, and to give diligent attention to, the debates and questions of law, and particularly to the arguments of those who were men of the greatest note and reputation for learning. The second was, to commit to writing what I heard, and the judgment thereupon, which seemed to me to be much better than to rely on treacherous memory. (<span class="italic">Les commentaries</span>, preface)</blockquote>Concentrating on demurrers or special verdicts, which threw up particularly problematic points in law, he did not quote verbatim, but he did preface each report with a transcription of the pleadings from the court record, and he verified the accuracy of the arguments presented by consulting the judges and other lawyers who had made them, sometimes showing them his version for approval. Although the book contains some of his own cases, there are only one or two lengthy expositions of his own views, most notably that in connection with the application of principles of equity to the interpretation of statutes. Plowden claimed that he published in the first place because manuscript versions, some of them corrupt, were circulating widely, and he appears always to have had an eye on the needs of law students. The second edition, which included additional cases, was printed in 1578, along with an analytical index compiled by Recorder William Fleetwood. The work was subsequently reissued many times, with some later editions containing in addition Plowden's <span class="italic">Queries</span>, a collection of moot points that was published from manuscript for the first time in 1620. Highly respected in his lifetime, Plowden's name is frequently associated with well-known legal aphorisms; Camden praised him for his learning and &#145;integrity of life&#146;  (Camden, 270). Sir Edward Coke approvingly referred to him in his <span class="italic">Institutes</span> as a &#145;sage of the law&#146;.<br>
<br>Plowden's will, dated 2 January 1582, gives his residences as Burghfield, Berkshire, and Shiplake, Oxfordshire. The latter house was leased to him in connection with his wardship of the young Francis Englefield, whose father had fled into exile at the accession of Queen Elizabeth, entrusting his estates to Plowden. Probably towards the end of the 1550s Plowden had married Katherine, daughter of William Sheldon of Beoley, Worcestershire. Their first-born son, Humphrey, seems to have died in infancy. The elder surviving son, Edmund, died in August 1587 (aged at least twenty-four); the younger, Francis, lived until 1652. One daughter, Ann, married Francis Parkins in 1581; another, Mary, became the wife of Richard White, and her son Thomas White became principal of the English College at Lisbon. Plowden died in London on 6 February 1585, leaving bequests for the poor and money to cover the unpaid tithes he owed to vicars in the parishes where he held land. He requested burial either in the Middle Temple Church, where there is a monument depicting him in his lawyer's robes, or at Burghfield.<br>
