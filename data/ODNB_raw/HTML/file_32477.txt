<span class="headword">Coghlan, Sir  Charles Patrick John</span>  (1863&#150;1927), <span class="occ">premier of Southern Rhodesia</span>, was born at King William's Town, Cape Colony, on 24 June 1863, the third son of James Coghlan JP of Cypherfontein and later of Clocolan, Orange Free State, soldier, civil servant, and farmer, and his wife, Isabella Mary MacLaren, of Alice, Cape Colony. His early education was supervised by a &#145;resident schoolmaster&#146;, a rifleman named Broomhall. Subsequently he was educated at the Jesuit-run St Aidan's College, Grahamstown (1875&#150;81), and the South African College, Cape Town. In 1882 he was articled to his brother James, a solicitor in Kimberley, where he remained until 1900, when he moved to Bulawayo in Southern Rhodesia. He was widely regarded as an outstanding lawyer.<br>
<br>Coghlan's political development was crucially influenced by his Catholicism, inherited from his Irish father and Scottish highland mother, his legal training, and eastern Cape upbringing. In 1891 a St Patrick's day dinner in Kimberley provided him with his first public platform, when he called for vengeance on British politicians for their coercive Irish policy. This fiery and persuasive brand of oratory, together with personal innuendo that was often unscrupulous, proved to be enduring characteristics of his political style. He combined Irish home rule and Gladstonian Liberal sympathies with a deep attachment to the crown and a Burkean reverence for the British constitution. In 1897 he joined the pro-imperial South African League and strengthened his imperial and eastern Cape connections with his marriage in 1899 to Gertrude Mary Schermbr&uuml;cker, daughter of Colonel Frederick Xavier Schermbr&uuml;cker, ex-German legionary, MP for King William's Town, sometime eastern Cape separatist, and an avowed imperialist.<br>
<br>After arriving in Bulawayo he became legal adviser to the municipality and to the Chamber of Mines and junior partner to P. D. Frames, a prominent settler leader. By this time Coghlan's political outlook, based on his experience of the eastern Cape and Kimberley, had become rooted in a deep antipathy to the parliament at Cape Town, and a conviction that no settler community should depend on a monopoly capitalist company. He regarded the western Cape as remote and unsympathetic to the economic, racial, and security anxieties of the &#145;frontier&#146;. These beliefs were greatly strengthened in Bulawayo. He soon developed a strong provincial loyalty to Matabeleland, regarding Salisbury as neglectful and dominated by civil servants, capitalists, and farmers. Rhodesian politics at this time were highly localized, based on a handful of elected members of the legislative council who were subject to pressure from various interest groups, including miners, farmers, merchants, and artisans. Political debate concentrated on the form of government which might succeed the British South Africa Company. The options included amending or abrogating the company's charter, representative or responsible government, amalgamating with Northern Rhodesia or the Transvaal, and, after 1910, integrating as a fifth province with the Union of South Africa. Coghlan never believed it was his role to guide public opinion. He distrusted grand geopolitical schemes such as those which motivated Cecil Rhodes and, later, General Jan Christian Smuts. Coghlan remained a follower, rather than a leader, of public opinion, reacting quickly to settler anxieties which transcended sectional interests, including the fear of African uprising and of sexual attack by black men on white women&#151;the so-called &#145;black peril&#146;. On several occasions he championed the settlers' right to resort to lynch law in such cases, if the government did not make attempted and actual rape capital offences.<br>
<br>Coghlan entered politics in 1901 in support of the movement for abrogation of the company's charter, and, as an acknowledged settler leader, he attended a conference in Salisbury in 1904 to discuss proposals for a financial settlement with the company. Sensing the public mood, he rejected the scheme, excusing himself from further discussions in London on the pretext of unavoidable professional duties. He also refused offers of the Matabeleland Political Association vice-presidency and nomination as candidate for the legislative council. In 1907, however, he represented Southern Rhodesia in negotiations with the company. A year later he was elected to the legislative council for the western division. His legal expertise and argumentative parliamentary style became highly valued in attacking the company's claim to own all unalienated land.<br>
<br>Coghlan was one of the Southern Rhodesian delegates to the South African National Convention of 1908&#150;9, where he helped to draw up the clause of the union constitution which provided for the future accession of Southern Rhodesia, but he reluctantly accepted the union's unitary constitution, with Cape Town as its legislative capital. The erosion of provincial powers at the convention's committee stage further weakened his early enthusiasm for union. In 1912 he resisted the campaign of the Rhodesian League for a crown colony form of government as a preliminary to full responsible government. He also strongly opposed amalgamation with Northern Rhodesia as an alternative to the union, proposed by the company in 1916, on the ground that this would frustrate Southern Rhodesian ambitions to remain a &#145;white man's country&#146;. He soon sensed a change in public opinion after the establishment in 1917 of the Responsible Government Association (RGA) by Mrs Ethel Tawse Jollie and John (Jock) McChlery. Essentially a representative of townsmen and small miners, Coghlan accepted the RGA presidency in 1919, by which time it had become clear that it had outgrown its farming connections. He echoed a widespread settler fear that union might bring a large influx of poor white Afrikaners and thus dilute and destroy the territory's Britishness. Strengthened by the privy council judgment against the company on the question of unalienated land, the RGA was victorious in the 1920 general election, but it still faced a powerful coalition of Rhodesian unionists, including the company and leading mining corporations. The British and South African governments regarded Southern Rhodesian accession as essential to bolster the pro-Commonwealth interest led by Smuts against General Hertzog's nationalists and the emerging power of labour. Coghlan rejected these appeals to a wider patriotism, along with Smuts's offer of cabinet rank in the union, and in 1922, in a campaign marked by widespread anti-Afrikaner xenophobia, the responsible government cause was carried by a majority of three to two. The victory owed much to Coghlan's oratory and the votes of artisans, merchants, and minor civil servants who felt threatened by union. Also crucial was the efficient running of the RGA by Mrs Tawse Jollie, for Coghlan preferred the convivial political atmosphere of the hotel lounge and the clubhouse to the tedium of party organization.<br>
<br>In 1923 Coghlan became premier, and his Rhodesia Party, formerly the RGA, proved in government to be more conservative and deferential to the administrative and economic inheritance of the British South Africa Company than its earlier populist and anti-capitalist character had suggested. He came to regret his earlier statements on native affairs and sought, in inter-racial cases, to preserve judicial independence against settler prejudice. He neglected his legal career and remained financially, in his own words, a &#145;poor man&#146;. He had lived all his adult life in hotels, and never owned a house of his own. His political achievements were widely recognized. In 1910 he was created knight bachelor for his services in the South African convention, and in 1925 he was made a KCMG. Trinity College, Dublin, honoured him with an LLD in 1926, by which time he had become disillusioned with Ireland's separatist course. He died suddenly at home in Salisbury on 28 August 1927 and was buried two days later in the Roman Catholic section of the Bulawayo cemetery. In a written request, opened after his death, he asked the legislative assembly to provide for his widow and daughter. In 1930 the legislative assembly decided that he was one who had, in terms of Rhodes's will, &#145;deserved well of his country&#146;, and his remains were reinterred at World's View, in the Matopo Hills, near to the graves of Rhodes and Jameson. He was survived by his wife and daughter.<br>
