<span class="headword">Bonwicke,  Ambrose</span>  (1652&#150;1722), <span class="occ">nonjuring Church of England clergyman and schoolmaster</span>, son of the Revd John Bonwicke BD (1622&#150;1698), later rector of East Horsley and of Mickleham in Surrey, was born on 29 April 1652 at East Horsley. On 11 September 1663 he entered Merchant Taylors' School, where the headmaster was John Goad, later dismissed for his sympathy towards the Roman Catholic church. Bonwicke matriculated at St John's College, Oxford, on 2 May 1668 and was elected fellow in 1669, graduating BA in 1673 and proceeding MA in 1676 (incorporated at Cambridge in 1678) and BD in 1682. His time as an undergraduate was vividly described by Bonwicke in a series of letters written to his father, many of which were later published with notes by John Nichols in his edition of the printer William Bowyer's <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Tracts</span> (1785). These letters make frequent allusion to acute shortage of money, a problem which was allayed when Bonwicke became tutor to Lord Stawell through the interest of Dr Peter Mews, president of St John's College from 1667 to 1673.<br>
<br>Having been ordained deacon in 1676 and priest in 1680, Bonwicke retained his fellowship at St John's until 1686, when, after the Merchant Taylors' Company had successfully resisted an attempt by James II to intrude his own nominee, Mr Lee, he was appointed to the headmastership of Merchant Taylors' School. Bonwicke proved a successful schoolmaster, and his pupils at this time included two future archbishops: Hugh Boulter (Armagh) and Sir William Dawes (York). In these years he married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1722), daughter of Philip Stubbs, citizen and vintner of London, and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26738/', "Philip Stubbs")</script>, later a prominent high-churchman and noted supporter of Henry Sacheverell at the time of his trial in 1710. Ambrose and Elizabeth had twelve children, of whom their eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2861/', "Ambrose Bonwicke the younger")</script>, was born on 30 September 1691.<br>
<br>Unwilling to take the oath of allegiance to William and Mary, Bonwicke was dismissed from his post as a nonjuror on 5 August 1691. His letters at this time to Richard Blechynden, a prebendary of Peterborough Cathedral and fellow of St John's College, who had conformed to the new regime, provide a concise statement of nonjuring scruples, echoing the doctrine of the <span class="italic">Oxford Decrees</span> (1683) and <span class="italic">The Whole Duty of Man</span>:<blockquote>I suppose &hellip; that King <i>James</i> had a right to my allegiance, and that secured by an oath; and unless he has given away this right or forfeited it, it is still in him. Now to me it does not appear that he has done either, therefore I dare not give it to another. (Bonwicke to Blechynden, 11 Aug 1691, cited in Mayor, 131)</blockquote>
<blockquote>I am to consider how I am to behave myself under a king that has possession and not right &hellip; if it were barely submitting to him in power, I suppose we should have no great dispute. (20 Aug 1691, ibid., 132)</blockquote>
<blockquote>The sons of the Church of England (by their general defection) have brought an indelible scandal upon her; and it is not to be wiped off by the constancy of a small party &hellip; if every man must be the judge of the actions of his prince, and quit his allegiance whenever he thinks the coronation oath broken, there can be no such thing as peace. (16 Sept 1691, ibid., 135)</blockquote>Following deprivation Bonwicke opened a private school at Headley, near his father's parish of Mickleham in Surrey. The poet Elijah Fenton served as usher there for a brief period during Queen Anne's reign, and the younger William Bowyer, a pupil <i>c</i>.1711&#150;1716, recalled Bonwicke's teaching ability and personal generosity with affection  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 1.63&#150;6). Following the death of his eldest son, Ambrose, in 1714 Bonwicke was persuaded to write an anonymous account of his life by Bowyer's father, William the elder. In this memoir, published posthumously in 1729 as <span class="italic">A Pattern for Young Students in the University</span>, Bonwicke movingly presented his son as an exemplar of devotion and conscience.<br>
<br>Bonwicke died on 20 October 1722, and was buried six days later in the chancel of the parish church at Mickleham. In his will, dated 26 July 1722, he left personal bequests amounting to more than &pound;3000. His wife died soon afterwards, on 3 December 1722.<br>
