<span class="headword">Eustace,  John Chetwode</span>  (1761&#150;1815), <span class="occ">travel writer and Roman Catholic priest</span>, was born in Kildare, the son of Maurice Eustace and his wife, Katherine Keegan. His father's family was of Anglo-Norman descent and also claimed a connection with the Chetwodes, a family of Cheshire origin settled in Queen's county. After early education at Sedgeley Park, a Roman Catholic school in Staffordshire, he spent seven years as a novice in the English Benedictine monastery of St Gregory's, Douai, but did not make his final profession. He subsequently found employment as tutor to the sons of the marquis de Foucaut and the duke of Ursell. Ordained priest for the diocese of Kildare and Leighlin, he was appointed in 1795, at the recommendation of Sir Edward Bellew, to the chair of rhetoric at the newly established college of Maynooth. In October 1796 he presented Edmund Burke with a copy of the verses he had composed for the inauguration of the college by the lord lieutenant, Lord Camden, whom he declined to eulogize. Burke found the piece full of spirit, evidence that &#145;bad as things are in Ireland, principle is not quite dead&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 102).<br>
<br>From 1798 Eustace served for two years as chaplain to Sir William Jerningham at Costessey, Norfolk, and henceforth made his career in England. In 1801&#150;2 he travelled in Italy as tutor and companion to three young gentlemen who included John Cust (later Lord Brownlow). In 1805 he moved to Cambridge to act as tutor&#150;companion to George Petre, nephew of the tenth Lord Petre, the first Roman Catholic to attend the university (as a member of Jesus College) since the Reformation&#151;though barred from taking a degree, and liable to fines for non-attendance at chapel. Eustace moved in Cambridge literary circles, and was encouraged by the antiquary and traveller Edward Daniel Clarke, a fellow of Jesus, to prepare the journal of his Italian tour for publication. He later accompanied Petre on a further tour of Dalmatia, western Greece, Sicily, and Malta. His moderate whig principles are evident in the <span class="italic">Political Catechism</span> which he published anonymously in 1810. By now he had settled at Great Chesterford, Essex.<br>
<br>When Eustace's two-volume <span class="italic">Tour through Italy</span> was eventually published in 1813, it won him instant celebrity, and the work (from 1815, entitled <span class="italic">A Classical Tour through Italy and Sicily</span>) went through eight editions between 1813 and 1841, becoming the standard vade-mecum of classical tourists. While the guide was antiquarian in tone, with an aesthetic preference for pure classicism over the Gothic and baroque styles, it was eloquent in its denunciation of contemporary absolutism and its championship of Italian liberty. Rejecting papal infallibility as &#145;absurd&#146;, and sceptical in his attitude towards miracles and relics, Eustace was ahead of his time in advocating a vernacular liturgy and urging the adoption within the Papal States of the principles of constitutional government. John Cam Hobhouse, in his annotations to <span class="italic">Childe Harold</span>, dismissed the <span class="italic">Tour</span> as inaccurate and derivative  (<span class="italic">Byron: Complete Poetical Works</span>, 2.262&#150;3)&#151;a judgement which is ungenerous and unjust.<br>
<br>In June 1814 Eustace accompanied lords Carrington and Essex on a visit to Paris. His <span class="italic">Letter from Paris to George Petre, Esquire</span> (1814), which was reprinted eight times in its year of publication, depicted the effect on Parisian society of war and &#145;revolutionary madness&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letter from Paris</span>, 1).<br>
<br>Eustace wore his learning lightly, and his polish and conversational charm made him popular in English aristocratic and literary society. Though he maintained friendly relations with Anglican clergymen, he was an eloquent champion of Roman Catholic liberties, which he defended in a celebrated exchange with the bishop of Lincoln in 1812. However, his ecumenism and attachment to the Cisalpine party earned him the hostility of his ecclesiastical superior Joseph Milner, who delated him to Rome as a latitudinarian. Milner was later to write that &#145;instead of gadding with Protestants through classical scenes, he [Eustace] ought to have been teaching Irish Catholics their catechism&#146;  (<span class="italic">Orthodox Journal</span>, August 1819, 303).<br>
<br>Eustace returned to Italy in 1815, and was collecting material for a supplement to the <span class="italic">Classical Tour</span> when he contracted malaria at Naples, where he died on 1 August 1815. He was interred in Naples in the church of the &#145;Crocelle&#146;, where a Latin inscription by the <i>abate</i> Campbell marked his monument  (Clayton). His projected supplement was completed by Sir Richard Colt Hoare and published in 1819. At the time of his death Eustace's literary reputation was such that he was said to have been offered an advance of &pound;2000 by his publisher, John Murray, for a didactic poem on &#145;the culture of the youthful mind&#146;  (<span class="italic">Byron's Letters and Journals</span>, 5.263).<br>
