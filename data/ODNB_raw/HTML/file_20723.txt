<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Oliver,  Isaac</span>  (<em>c.</em>1565&#150;1617), <span class="occ">miniature painter</span>, was apparently the only child of Pierre Olivier, goldsmith of Rouen in Normandy, and his wife, Epiphane. Olivier was among a group of Huguenot refugees from Paris and Rouen, many of them goldsmiths, who were admitted to Geneva on 15 October 1557. Many English protestants had fled to the continent for safety during the reign of the Roman Catholic Queen Mary I (daughter of Henry VIII); one group arrived in Geneva somewhat earlier than the Frenchmen, and in June 1557 were admitted to the English congregation there. Among them was Nicholas Hilliard, then about ten years old, who would soon have met and learned from the French artists. The English exiles returned home in 1559, soon after the accession of the protestant Elizabeth I, and at some unknown date Pierre Olivier returned to Rouen. It was presumably there that he met and married Epiphane (about whom nothing is known), and Isaac was born there. In the eighteenth century George Vertue and Horace Walpole tried, but failed, to establish Oliver's date of birth, and it remains unknown.<h2>
<a name="EarlyyearsinLondoninstructionbyHilliard"></a>Early years in London: instruction by Hilliard</h2>The earliest information about the Oliviers' presence in London appears in aliens' returns, which were made at irregular intervals. Two (of 1571) say that they had arrived about three years earlier. Oliver is entered as &#145;chylde&#146;, perhaps indicating a very young one, so that <i>c</i>.1565 seems to be a reasonable suggested date of birth. Since he always remained firmly within the large community of immigrant artists in London details of his early life are elusive and have been sketched mainly from incomplete manuscript sources and by way of informed guesswork. From <i>c</i>.1568 the Oliviers lodged with a pewterer called Harrison in Fleet Lane, just to the east of the Fleet River, close to its confluence with the Thames, and to Blackfriars, where Isaac was to spend much of his professional life. Pierre no doubt soon sought out Hilliard, whom he had known as a boy in Geneva and who, in 1568, was nearing the end of his apprenticeship. Olivier would have noted the quality of his work, as both limner and goldsmith, and probably then discussed the possibility of instruction for Isaac when he was old enough. They could converse in French, which Hilliard had learned during his continental exile.<br>
<br>The wills, dated 1570 and 1588, of two members of a Netherlandish family from Breda called Matheeusen or Matheeus (soon Anglicized to Mathewe) contain references to the Olivier family. Jacob (James) Matheeusen, painter, settled in Holborn and became a parishioner of St Sepulchre without Newgate. This area was always popular with immigrants; being outside the city wall it escaped the jurisdiction of the authorities and it provided more space for those who needed studios and workshops. On 12 June 1562 Matheeusen became a denizen, and by 1564 he was living in Seacoal Lane. He would have been buried at St Sepulchre's and his only son, Pieter, baptized there. Dates are unknown since the early registers were lost in the great fire of 1666. Pieter was very young when his father died. He had hoped to become an artist but in 1588, when he was apparently lodging in the city parish of St Helen, Bishopsgate, he became seriously ill. He made his will on 17 October and was buried at St Helen's on 6 November. He was a youth of means, having inherited property in Breda from his father, and he left sums ranging from &pound;3 to &pound;10 to many Dutch relatives and friends who had looked after him; his cousin Adrian Van Son, painter to James VI of Scotland, was to have three &#145;pictures&#146;, probably miniatures, of Pieter's late parents and himself (his two sisters had predeceased him). There were also bequests of &pound;3 each to &#145;Isac Olivier&#146; and his mother, Epiphane (Pierre is not mentioned and had presumably died); his &#145;bookes of Artes and that which concerneth the same arte&#146; were left to &#145;my twoe fellowes Isac Olivyer and Rouland Lacq&#146;. The will seems to imply that the three young men were still being instructed by Hilliard in the autumn of 1588. &#145;Rouland Lacq&#146; (Rowland Lockey) certainly was; he had started an eight-year apprenticeship under Hilliard on 29 September 1581 and would probably have become free some time in 1589. By sore mischance the Goldsmiths' court minute book covering 1579 to 1592, which might have answered some questions, was lost in a fire&#151;not that of 1666, which badly damaged the company's hall, but a much smaller one in 1681, when repair work was going on. The fragments of information now assembled establish that the three young &#145;fellows&#146; had been very near neighbours from boyhood. Pieter was born in Seacoal Lane <i>c</i>.1569 (Seacoal Lane ran down to Fleet Lane, where the Oliviers lodged from <i>c</i>.1568) and Rowland was born <i>c</i>.1567 at the south end of Fleet Lane, the only part of it within his family parish of St Bride, Fleet Street, for which registers do not survive so far back.<h2>
<a name="MaturityrivaltoHilliard"></a>Maturity: rival to Hilliard</h2>Hilliard and his celebrated pupil Isaac Oliver probably began their professional careers at the age of about twenty-two. Oliver's first known portrait miniature is of a twenty-year-old middle-class woman, and is of unusual three-quarters length; it looks experimental and is dated 1587. In 1588 Oliver emerged as an assured and accomplished artist, with miniatures <span class="italic">A Youth Aged 19</span> (priv. coll.), <span class="italic">A Man of 71</span> (AM Oxf.), and of a fifty-nine-year-old Dutchman, now known to be Colonel Diederik Sonoy (Royal Collection, the Netherlands). Oliver was always responsive to Netherlandish, French, and Italian influences and it has sometimes been suggested that he had returned to the continent during his youth and that the Sonoy miniature was done there. However, there is compelling evidence that Sonoy sat for him in London. Sonoy was a prominent protestant and anglophile, and in 1588 he was permitted to take refuge in England from the Spanish Netherlands. A letter from Sir William Russell, governor of Flushing, commending him to the queen's principal secretary, Sir Francis Walsingham, is endorsed &#145;17 October 1588 &hellip; by Colonel Sonoy&#146;, meaning that he delivered it himself  (state papers, SP 84/27/122<i>v</i>, Netherlands). Hilliard had spent two years and more in Geneva as a boy and two years in France in the 1570s but there is as yet no hard evidence either way about Oliver. Unlike Hilliard he did not practise as a jeweller, goldsmith, or engraver; he did do a number of drawings but he could have learnt techniques and styles from members of the immigrant community in London.<br>
<br>Oliver continued to do small oval portrait miniatures from time to time during his career but he employed the techniques learnt from Hilliard in very different ways. Hilliard favoured daylight for his sitter and was against shadowing the face; if necessary, he used a deeper tone of the same basic flesh colour&#151;&#145;limning is but a shadowing of the same colour your ground is of&#146;, as he writes in his <span class="italic">Treatise Concerning the Arte of Limning</span>  (1981, p. 7). Oliver chose a restricted source of light, casting deep shadows, for which he used darker pigments. In 1590 he did a fine limning <span class="italic">Unknown Man, Aged 27</span> (V&amp;A); similar in handling, and probably of about the same date, is a self-portrait in the Royal Collection, showing the artist at three-quarters length, bearded and wearing a tall hat. Limnings of girls aged four and five (V&amp;A), dated 1590, display Oliver's marked talent, rare at the time, for depicting young children as sentient humans rather than as wooden dolls. During the decade his renown steadily increased and with it the status of the patrons he could attract. His talent and comparative youth appealed to the avant-garde. Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex, who had succeeded Lord Leicester as the queen's favourite, sought out the younger man in 1596 on his return from the expedition to Cadiz. He had grown a beard during his absence; a fine limning by Oliver resulted (Royal Collection) and was much copied. A miniature of an unidentified Sir Arundel Talbot (V&amp;A) provides evidence that Oliver visited Italy in the same year; on the reverse he inscribed: &#145;13. Magio. 1596./In Venetia./Fecit m. Isacq Oli&#365;iero/Francese&#146; with his monogram (resembling the Greek phi). Larger miniatures include one often called <span class="italic">Unknown Melancholy Young Man</span> (Royal Collection), at one time wrongly identified as of Sir Philip Sidney, and a striking work, dated 1598, <span class="italic">The Three Brothers Browne</span> (priv. coll.), portraying the grandsons of the first Viscount Montague, dressed identically in black and with arms entwined.<br>
<br>Oliver benefited at this period from an absence of competition; Queen Elizabeth had never liked the second great seal of the realm, designed by Hilliard, which came into use in 1586, and in 1591 she required him to try again. This caused Hilliard much trouble and expense&#151;ultimately to no avail&#151;and on 2 June 1599 he told Sir Robert Cecil that only one instalment of a &pound;40 annuity, promised in 1591, had been paid: &#145;throughe missing of so many sutes [commissions] as I have had W<sup>th</sup>in this 8. yeres&#146;, he wrote, he was now in &#145;great extremes&#146;  (Cecil MSS, Hatfield House, Hertfordshire, 70/76). A striking unfinished and undated limning of the queen (V&amp;A) was probably intended for the guidance of foreign engravers; it is an uncompromising portrayal of an ageing woman and is confidently attributed to Isaac Oliver. Hilliard's monopoly status as the sovereign's limner was reaffirmed by warrant dated 17 August 1599, probably thanks to pressure from Cecil; it is very difficult to believe that Elizabeth would actually have granted a sitting to anyone else. It has been suggested that the unfinished limning of her was a copy done from a Hilliard.<h2>
<a name="FirstandsecondwivesandsonPeter"></a>First and second wives and son Peter</h2>Isaac Oliver married three times. His first wife, known only as Elizabeth, was buried, aged twenty-eight, at St Peter, Cornhill (near the French church in Threadneedle Street), on 6 September 1599. It was common practice for a man to marry soon after completing an apprenticeship or other training and Oliver may well have married towards the end of 1588, when Elizabeth would have been seventeen or eighteen, at that time a popular age for brides. Thus their son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20729/', "Peter Oliver")</script> could have been born in 1589. If Elizabeth was French, as is probable, the marriage would have been at the French church, for which no registers survive before 1600, and Peter would have been baptized there (as was Isaac's eldest son by his third marriage, also to a young bride of seventeen).<br>
<br>On 9 February 1602, at the Dutch church, Austin Friars, Oliver married, second, Sara Gheeraerts (<i>bap</i>. 1575, <i>d</i>. 1605), thereby involving himself with the intricate network of leading families of portrait painters from the Netherlands: specifically, Gheeraerts from Bruges and de Critz from Antwerp. Sara had been baptized at the Dutch church on 12 May 1575 and was a daughter of the portrait painter Marcus Gheeraerts I, who had arrived in London from Bruges in 1567&#150;8; on 9 September 1571, at the same church, Gheeraerts had married, as his second wife, Susanna de Critz, elder sister of John de Critz, who became serjeant-painter at court in 1605. Sara Oliver was half-sister to Marcus Gheeraerts II, the most fashionable portrait painter in England from <i>c</i>.1590; he was a son&#151;born in Bruges&#151;of Marcus Gheeraerts I and his first wife. To add to the complexities Isaac Oliver became briefly a brother-in-law of the sculptor Maximilian Colt, from Arras in northern France; Colt married Sara Oliver's younger sister Susanna Gheeraerts in 1604 and was appointed master sculptor at court in 1608.<h2>
<a name="LimnertoQueenAnneofDenmark"></a>Limner to Queen Anne of Denmark</h2>Nicholas Hilliard retained the monopoly as sovereign's limner on the accession of King James VI of Scotland to the English throne in 1603. His queen, Anne of Denmark&#151;who was genuinely interested in the visual arts&#151;soon had her own household at Somerset House in the Strand (renamed Denmark House during her lifetime); on 22 June 1605 she appointed Isaac Oliver her limner, again at &pound;40 a year. Her elder son, Prince Henry, a precocious and gifted youth, began to employ Oliver in 1608, when he was only fourteen, but these moves should not be seen as a rejection of Hilliard; his official appointment was to the monarch, and he and his assistants (including his son Laurence Hilliard) were fully engaged in providing portrait miniatures and gold presentation medals. It has to be remembered, too, that Hilliard reached the then advanced age of sixty about 1607.<br>
<br>The Olivers had no children and, a month after Isaac's royal appointment, Sara died; she was buried on 27 July 1605 at St Anne Blackfriars. The couple had probably settled in the parish at their marriage. St Anne's still enjoyed certain privileges as a &#145;precinct&#146; or &#145;liberty&#146;, surviving from the days of its monastic status, and it was much favoured by successful immigrant artists with court connections. It was easy to travel by water from Blackfriars Stairs, upstream to Westminster or downstream to Greenwich Palace. (Van Dyck spent his last years in a house on the riverbank with a garden.)<h2>
<a name="Thirdmarriage"></a>Third marriage</h2>In 1606 Isaac Oliver married for the third and last time; his bride, Elizabeth (<i>bap</i>. 1589, <i>d</i>. 1628&times;40), was a daughter of Jacques or James Harden or Harding, a court flautist and composer of French origin. The Hardings were parishioners of Holy Trinity Minories near the Tower of London, and also had a country place at the then fashionable riverside village of Isleworth. Eight children of James Harding and his wife, Ann, were baptized at the Minories between 1579 and 1591; most of them were very short-lived. The seventh, Elizabeth, survived to become the wife of Isaac Oliver. (The ninth and last, Anne, future wife of Isaac's eldest son, Peter, was baptized at Isleworth on 11 April 1593; the family had probably moved out of London because of the major outbreak of plague in 1592&#150;4.) All Saints, Isleworth, and its registers were badly damaged in a fire in 1943 but it is just possible to make out that &#145;Isaac Oliver and Elizabeth Hardinge&#146; were married on 23 (or 29) July 1606. A charmingly informal limning of Elizabeth by her husband (priv. coll.), probably a family possession, portrays her half smiling; she wears a winged cap, a white smock with the collar open and turned down, and a jacket embroidered with flowers.<br>
<br>It must now have become clear to Oliver that his future lay in England, and at the end of 1606&#151;on 6 December&#151;he secured the right of denization, thirty-eight years after his arrival as a child. Four sons and two daughters of Isaac and Elizabeth were baptized at Blackfriars between 1608 and 1617, and their grandmother Epiphane was buried there on 6 March 1610. Two sons survived: the first, James&#151;baptized at Blackfriars on 18 December 1608 and on the following 8 January at the French church&#151;married Alice Thurston on 25 November 1634, and they had at least two sons, William (<i>b</i>. 1635) and John (<i>b</i>. 1636). Isaac junior, baptized on 11 December 1610, was still living in 1672 in the house at Isleworth of his aunt Anne, Peter's widow, and she made careful provision for him in her will.<br>
<br>Isaac Oliver did many limnings of Queen Anne of Denmark, including a profile in masque costume (Royal Collection); she was a leading promoter of these lavish court entertainments, in which she and her ladies sometimes took part. The main focus was on the heir to the throne, Prince Henry, who was well on the way to becoming a major patron of the arts at his untimely death in November 1612, aged eighteen. He had his household at St James's Palace, to which Oliver was attached; one of his finest limnings portrays the prince in gilt armour against a background of an encampment (Royal Collection), of which many copies and variants were produced. Roy Strong suggests a link with his appearance as a chivalric champion in the court entertainment <span class="italic">The Barriers</span>, put on in 1610, the year of Henry's creation as prince of Wales. &#145;Mr Isacke&#146; attended the prince's funeral on 7 December 1612.<br>
<br>In general Oliver's works show a remarkable diversity of subjects and styles. He was responsive to the dictates of his patrons; in 1616, the year before his death, he did both a small, austere oval of John Donne (Royal Collection), poet and theologian, in the style of the early 1590s, and a large, highly-coloured full-length of Richard Sackville, third earl of Dorset (V&amp;A), every detail of his extravagant dress painstakingly portrayed. There is no certainty about identities of sitters in two fine and unusually large, 5 inch diameter roundels of exquisitely dressed ladies, and suggested dates have ranged from 1595 to 1613. One (Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge) is of a lady, formerly called &#145;Lucy Harington, countess of Bedford&#146;; the other is of a lady, formerly called &#145;Frances Howard, countess of Essex and Somerset&#146; (V&amp;A). Also impossible to date are a number of complex limnings and drawings ranging from an erotic <span class="italic">Nymphs and Satyrs</span> (Royal Collection) to religious subjects. The most ambitious limning, <span class="italic">Entombment</span>, or <span class="italic">Burial of Christ</span>, was completed by Peter Oliver after his father's death; a carefully finished preliminary drawing in ink and black chalk is in the British Museum.<br>
<br>Oliver probably died at the end of September 1617, since he was buried at St Anne Blackfriars on 2 October. He bequeathed to Peter Oliver all his finished and unfinished drawings, and his unfinished limnings&#151;historical scenes and narratives as well as portraits. St Anne Blackfriars and all its contents, including the artist's monument and marble bust, were destroyed in the fire of 1666.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Oliver married, second, Pierce Morgan, a gentleman of Blackfriars and Isleworth and a freeman of the premier city livery company, the Mercers. He was a wealthy widower with five daughters, and he and Elizabeth had a sixth, called Jane; a seventh, Katherine, was baptized at Blackfriars on 6 April 1628 and buried six days later. Elizabeth predeceased her husband and was presumably buried at Isleworth, a fact obliterated in the fire of 1943.<br>
<br>A licence was secured on 30 May 1636 for Jane, daughter of Pierce and Elizabeth, to be married to a young nephew of Pierce, and the marriage took place at Twickenham on 1 June. This was evidently a close and affectionate family group, and Pierce Morgan&#151;who was buried at Blackfriars on 9 April 1640&#151;left a will with many references to Olivers. He had built a &#145;new brick howse&#146; at Isleworth, and he bequeathed to his daughter Jane a &#145;little dwelling house&#146; there, with grounds, orchards, stable, and coach house; also two pictures at the family home in Blackfriars of her grandfather and grandmother, presumably Isaac Oliver's in-laws, the Hardings. Morgan bequeathed to his &#145;sonne in law [stepson] Mr Isaack Oliver his Fathers picture in liewe of a silver Cupp he had given him by his godfather or one of his Witnesses &hellip; this being his desire&#146;  (Edmond, <span class="italic">Walpole Society</span>, 47.81&#150;3 and pedigree 74).<br>
<br>A major exhibition, entitled &#145;Nicholas Hilliard and Isaac Oliver&#146;, was mounted at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, in 1947, marking the quatercentenary of Hilliard's probable date of birth; one of its main aims was to establish a clear line of demarcation between the works of the two men, which had become much confused. They were brilliantly gifted but utterly different&#151;Hilliard English, Oliver determinedly French (although he spent most of his life in England)&#151;and they were divided in age by almost a generation. Hilliard believed that the portrait miniature was the highest form of art, although he also practised as a goldsmith, engraver, jeweller, and calligrapher; Oliver used limning for a much wider range of subjects and, unlike Hilliard, was a prolific draughtsman. Judging from the self-portraits each had a good conceit of himself. Oliver left no writings so there is nothing to set beside Hilliard's remarkably self-revealing <span class="italic">Treatise</span>.<br>
