<span class="headword">Lollius Urbicus,  Quintus</span>  (<em>b. </em>after 100?, <em>d.</em> after 150), <span class="occ">Roman governor of Britain</span>, was born near Cirta in the province of Numidia (eastern Algeria), in north Africa, probably shortly after 100. He appears to have been the second of the three known sons of Marcus Lollius Senecio and Grania Honorata. His career can be calculated as starting soon after the accession of Hadrian in 118 and he served as: <i>quattuorvir viarum curandarum</i> (one of the officials in charge of the streets of Rome); <i>tribunus laticlavius</i> (senior tribune) in legion XXII Primigenia, stationed at Moguntiacum (Mainz) in Upper Germany; quaestor of the city of Rome; legate (adjutant) of the proconsul of Asia; tribune of the plebs and praetor, both as the emperor's candidate; legate (commanding officer) of the X Gemina at Vindobona (Vienna), in Upper Pannonia (Hungary); legate (staff officer) in the Jewish War of Hadrian (132&#150;5), in which he was decorated; consul, probably in 135 or 136; <i>fetialis</i> (a member of one of the colleges of priests in Rome); governor of Lower Germany; governor of Britain from 139 to 142 or 143; and prefect of Rome, probably from 146 to at least 150.<br>
<br>Urbicus does not appear to have been the son of a senator; he was thus one of the new men who came into the aristocracy during the empire from the provinces. His early career is not distinguished, but it clearly acquired imperial support after his service as legate of the proconsul of Asia. Here he may have acquired a patron who helped further his career and this may have been Pompeius Falco, formerly governor of Britain. Urbicus held a staff post during the Jewish War of 132 to 135, serving under Sextus Julius Severus, also a former governor of Britain. At the end of the decade Urbicus was specially chosen by Antoninus Pius to reverse the frontier policy of his predecessor in Britain by conducting a new campaign to subdue the Britons north of Hadrian's Wall. It may be presumed that Urbicus had acquired some background knowledge of the province through his service with previous governors.<br>
<br>The emperor Hadrian died in July 138. The biography of his successor, Antoninus Pius, states that &#145;he conquered the Britons through the governor Lollius Urbicus and after driving back the barbarians built a new wall of turf&#146;  (Magie, v.4). An inscription from Corbridge demonstrates that Urbicus was governor of Britain by 139. In 142, following the end of the campaign, Pius was acclaimed <i>imperator</i> (&#145;conqueror&#146;: the traditional acclamation by soldiers on the field of battle to their victorious commander was given under the empire to the emperor when his generals won victories in his name).<br>
<br>The reasons for the reconquest of southern Scotland are not known. The phrase &#145;drive back the barbarians&#146; seems to imply that forcible action was necessary and this receives some support from an aside by Pausanias in his <span class="italic">Description of Greece</span>: &#145;Antoninus deprived the Brigantes in Britain of most of their territory because they too had taken up arms and invaded the Genunian district, the people of which are subject to Rome&#146;  (Pausanias, viii.43, 4). The passage as it stands makes little sense; nevertheless it presumably relates to the northward advance in the early 140s. Hence modern scholars have suggested that the reason for the reconquest of southern Scotland was that the northern tribes were causing trouble. A more subtle explanation is that Hadrian's Wall was a tactical success but a strategic failure, in that it was too distant from the main enemy in the north, the Caledonians, and that it was therefore necessary to move the frontier northwards. More recently the necessity for the new emperor to gain a military triumph to secure his position on the throne has been emphasized, with Britain chosen as the location of this imperial triumph. Certainly the invasion of southern Scotland would have been the decision of the emperor, not of Urbicus, as the life of Antoninus Pius and a comment by Cornelius Fronto both imply.<br>
<br>Urbicus was clearly responsible for the preparations for the reconquest of southern Scotland, as the inscription from Corbridge indicates, and the preparations continued into the following season, as demonstrated by a second inscription from Corbridge. He is also recorded on two building inscriptions at the Roman fort at Balmuildy, one of the first forts to be constructed on the Antonine Wall. His name, however, does not appear on other inscriptions on that wall, which suggests that he left Britain during the building of the frontier, leaving completion of the task to his unknown successor. He is also recorded on a building stone at High Rochester on Dere Street to the south of the Antonine Wall. Clearly, Urbicus left his governorship only when work on securing its success through construction of the frontier and its attendant forts was well advanced. The close density of the forts and fortlets in southern Scotland was presumably ordered by Urbicus and may reflect his determination to ensure the enduring success of his military action. Nevertheless, the occupation of the Antonine Wall does not appear to have outlasted Antoninus Pius by many years. Modern opinion considers that it was abandoned within a decade of his death in 161.<br>
<br>Urbicus's career is further recorded on two inscriptions from Numidia. He left no known descendants and the author &#145;Lollius Urbicus&#146; cited by the <span class="italic">Scriptores historiae Augustae</span> is now known to have been bogus.<br>
