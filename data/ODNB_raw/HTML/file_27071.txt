<span class="headword">Taylor,  Philip</span>  (1786&#150;1870), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was the fourth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27055/', "John Taylor (1750&#150;1826)")</script>, hymn writer of Norwich, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27082/', "Susanna Taylor (1755&#150;1823)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27055/', "Taylor, John (1750&#150;1826)")</script>], essayist and daughter of John Cook of Norwich. He was the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27074/', "Richard Taylor (1781&#150;1858)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27025/', "Edward Taylor (1784&#150;1863)")</script>, and the better-known <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27059/', "John Taylor (1779&#150;1863)")</script>, a mining engineer. Philip was educated at Dr Houghton's school in Norwich, and at fifteen was sent to live with his brother John and to study surgery under Dr Harness, a relative of John's wife, at Tavistock. However, having a horror of witnessing or causing pain, he returned to Norwich, where he joined a Mr Fitch in business as a chemist and druggist, and set up a factory for making wooden pillboxes by machine. In 1812 he and his brother John started a chemical works at Stratford, east London.<br>
<br>In 1813 Taylor married Sarah, daughter of Robert Fitch, surgeon, of Ipswich. They settled at Bromley by Bow, adjoining Stratford, where the brothers' visitors included many of the famous engineers and chemists of the day, both English and French. In 1816 and 1818 Taylor patented the application of high-pressure steam to evaporation, a process which was taken up in Whitbread's brewery and by various sugar refiners. He then devised a method of making gas from oil (that is, naphtha) and was able to light public and private buildings by naphtha, which was at first cheaper and more efficient than coal gas. Covent Garden Theatre, Mile End Road, the Imperial Library at St Petersburg, and the city of Bristol were lighted by his process; but when the gas companies lowered their prices, Taylor was driven out of business.<br>
<br>Between 1816 and 1825 Taylor's inventive nature led him to apply for several engineering patents, and in 1822 he made his first visit to Paris. He assisted Marc Isambard Brunel in 1821 in his debt crisis, and he was a director of the Thames Tunnel Company. In 1824 he moved his family to south Wales when he became connected with the British Iron Company and took out a patent for making iron. Involved in the company's ruin, and with his chemical works rendered unprofitable by the bad management of his partners, he went in 1828 to Paris, founded engineering works, and patented the hot-blast process in the manufacture of iron, which two other engineers simultaneously patented in London. The validity of the French patent was disputed, and was not established until 1839, just before its expiration. In 1834 Taylor submitted to King Louis-Philippe a scheme for supplying Paris with water by a tunnel from the Marne to a hill at Ivry, just as he had previously proposed for London a 9 mile tunnel to Hampstead Hill; but the expense was too great and nothing came of it.<br>
<br>In 1834, moving south for the benefit of his wife's health, Taylor erected machinery for a flour mill at Marseilles and became a partner in the business, which, however, under protectionist pressure, was soon deprived of the privilege of grinding in bond. Taylor thereupon, with his sons Philip Meadows and Robert, founded in 1836 engineering works at Marseilles, and in 1845 he bought a shipbuilding yard at La Seyne, near Toulon, which became a large and flourishing concern employing 2000 men. Papa Taylor, as he was called, was very popular with his workmen. From 1847 to 1852 he resided at San Pier d'Arena, near Genoa, where the Sardinian government had invited him to establish engineering works; but the political troubles induced him to return to Marseilles. The sudden loss of four of his eight children having affected his health, he disposed of his business in 1855 to the Compagnie des Forges et Chantiers de la M&eacute;diterran&eacute;e.<br>
<br>Taylor prided himself on having taken part in the first steamboat trip at sea, on having seen the start of the first steam engine, and on having witnessed Sir Charles Wheatstone's first electric telegraph experiments, at Somerset House. He was made a knight of the French L&eacute;gion d'honneur in 1846 and was awarded the Sardinian order of St Maurice and St Lazarus. He died at his home at St Marguerite, near Marseilles, on 1 July 1870.<br>
