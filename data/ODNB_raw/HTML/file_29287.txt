<span class="headword">Whitehead,  George</span>  (1637&#150;1724), <span class="occ">Quaker leader and writer</span>, was born at Sunbiggin in the parish of Orton, Westmorland, in 1637, the son of poor farmers. He attended the free school at Blencoe, Cumberland, and when he was fourteen rejected the presbyterianism of his parents. At some point during the next eighteen months he was converted to Quakerism by George Fox, whom he first heard preaching at Henry Ward's house at Sunny Bank, Grayrigg, about 8 miles to the south-west of Sunbiggin. Whitehead was active as a Quaker proselyte in disputes with the local clergy until 1654. He then moved south and evangelized through Yorkshire and Lincolnshire into East Anglia and Kent, principally with the Quaker Richard Hubberthorne, but also at times with Fox, John Stubbs, John Rous, and Alexander Parker. Despite his youth, Whitehead was notable as a leader in clashes with clergymen, claiming that God enabled him to identify false syllogisms.<br>
<br>In December 1654 Whitehead endured the first of many periods of imprisonment for the sake of his faith. Having spoken against a sermon at St Peter's Church, Norwich, he was examined and imprisoned for eight weeks; this was followed by a further spell of three weeks in prison in March 1655 when he visited Quakers imprisoned in Norwich Castle. In July he was committed for trial at Bury St Edmunds after defending a paper affixed to the church door of Bures, Suffolk, by another Quaker, Richard Clayton; he was held for three months. On refusing to pay a fine, Whitehead was imprisoned and was released in October 1656 only following direct appeals to Oliver Cromwell, including one by Mary Saunders, a servant of the Cromwell family. Over the following months Whitehead endured harsh physical punishment: he was set in the stocks in Saffron Walden and was publicly whipped at Nayland.<br>
<br>Whitehead's first two works, <span class="italic">Davids Enemies Discovered</span> and <span class="italic">Cain's Generation Discover'd</span>, both attacks on Jonathan Clapham's defence of psalm singing, were published in 1655. These marked the beginning of a redoubtable publishing career: by the time of Whitehead's death, over 100 separate printed items had appeared. Most were controversial works, but some were spiritual testimonies, epistles, and printed sermons. (Sermons of his were also included in the Quaker collections of sermons <span class="italic">Harmony of Divine and Heavenly Doctrines</span> of 1696 and <span class="italic">The Concurrence and Unanimity; of the People called Quakers</span> of 1711.)<br>
<br>In 1657 Whitehead made a visit home to Westmorland, by way of the west of England, and was reconciled with his parents (his mother and sister eventually became Quakers); he is also said to have met the Quaker schismatic James Nayler at Great Strickland, although the latter's imprisonment from 1656 to 1659 casts doubt on this. While in the north Whitehead also made successful proselytizing journeys into Northumberland, visiting Newcastle, Berwick, Alnwick, and Holy Island. On his return south he was imprisoned for more than four months at Ipswich on the evidence of a clergyman with whom he had talked on the road south; while imprisoned, he wrote an open letter, &#145;To the inhabitants of Ipswich, both teachers and people&#146;, which does not seem to have been published. His repeated encounters with the law from the mid-1650s onwards helped him amass a vast legal knowledge, which proved especially helpful in defending himself against charges of vagrancy and disturbing religious services. At Ipswich, for example, he caused a sensation in court by pointing out the illegality of the accusation he faced; however, on this occasion he was returned to gaol and freed only following the death of Cromwell in September 1658. Notwithstanding such setbacks, it was to Whitehead that the responsibility fell for showing Friends how to assert their rights in law, something readily observable in the relish with which Whitehead produced many protracted published accounts of his legal battles.<br>
<br>Whitehead later remarked that although there was much &#145;Pulpit-Noise against us&#146; the Friends &#145;had some Respite and Ease from open Persecution &hellip; after <i>Richard Cromwel</i> was set up for <i>Protector</i>&#146;  (Whitehead, 144). During the hiatus between the collapse of Richard Cromwell's regime and the return of Charles II, Whitehead held public disputes on 29 August 1659 with the Cambridge divine Thomas Smith (who argued that he was a heretic) and on 15 September with the universalists Thomas Moor and John Horn at King's Lynn; both encounters were recorded in pamphlet publications. Similar disputes took place at Fulham and Bluntisford. In the first month of the Restoration, Whitehead had to be protected from a mob in Peterborough by some of John Lambert's soldiers quartered in the town. Charles's proclamation against conventicles led to Whitehead's imprisonment for sixteen weeks in Norwich Castle, where in March 1661 he almost died of ague and fever. Later in the same year he appeared before parliamentary committees and the bar of the House of Commons, with Hubberthorne and Edward Burrough, to protest against anti-Quaker legislation then being drafted by parliament. The three were imprisoned in Newgate; only Whitehead survived the incarceration.<br>
<br>Whitehead spent most of the next decade in prison. On his release from Norwich Castle in 1661 he was again immediately active, this time leading protests against oaths (especially the oath of allegiance). In July 1664 he was arrested for preaching at a Quaker meeting in Surrey and imprisoned at Southwark; while incarcerated he was also accused of involvement in the Westmorland Kipper-Rigg plot of 1663&#150;4. In October he was one of forty-five arrested at a meeting at the Bull and Mouth, London, and was imprisoned in Newgate. When not in prison he lodged with the Quaker Rebecca Travers in London and was active in the city, holding meetings on transport ships at Gravesend and visiting prisoners during the great plague.<br>
<br>The summer of 1670 was an eventful time for Whitehead. On 13 May 1670 he married at the Peel meeting of Quakers in Clerkenwell; his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69080/', "Anne Whitehead (c.1624&#150;1686)")</script>, was the daughter of Thomas Downer, vicar of Charlbury, and the widow of Benjamin Greenwell (who had died in Newgate in 1665). An early convert to Quakerism and a prominent preacher, Anne was considerably older than George, who later described her as &#145;like a Tender Mother&#146; to him  (Whitehead, 322). They apparently had no children. In June and July 1670 the city authorities seem to have mounted a sustained campaign against the Quaker meeting in Gracechurch Street. Whitehead was arrested and examined several times; on each occasion he protested that the actions of the meeting had not been illegal under the terms of the <span class="roman">Conventicle Act</span>. &#145;I desire you would not go about to ensnare us, for the Law was not made to make Men Transgressors, but to punish them where it finds such&#146;, he warned one of the judges  (Besse, 1.414). In spring 1672 he and Thomas Moor negotiated with Charles II a royal indulgence for the release of almost 500 prisoners, not all of them Quakers and many of them dissenters who were in fact enemies of the Friends. This was the first of Whitehead's many interviews with Charles II; in 1673, for example, he pleaded with the king for Fox's liberation from Worcester gaol.<br>
<br>Although Whitehead still toured the countryside preaching and attending meetings&#151;he preached at Erith, Huntingdonshire, in April 1676&#151;the 1670s saw him otherwise settled in the capital, working as a grocer in Houndsditch. When he was arrested with Thomas Burr at a meeting at Norwich in March 1680 and imprisoned, a certificate, signed by two London common councilmen, two churchwardens, and a constable among others, was issued testifying that Whitehead had been a resident of the parish of St Botolph without Bishopgate in London for about ten years; he was &#145;in Good Repute, and is esteemed a man of a Competent Estate&#146; and &#145;hath demeaned himself peaceably in his Conversation&#146;  (Whitehead, 417). The certificate was never read at the ensuing trial but both men were nevertheless discharged in July. Whitehead's relative youth, his presence in the Quaker movement since the earliest days, and the death of most of the prominent founding Friends by the 1670s meant that he was effectively the most important Friend in the capital by this date. He helped arbitrate in the so-called Wilkinson&#150;Story controversy that threatened the movement in the 1670s, and was also a key figure in the weekly meeting for sufferings which was established by London Quakers in 1676 and eventually became the &#145;executive committee&#146; for the movement as a whole  (Ingle, 257). Although undoubtedly a resolute follower and close associate of Fox (he had attended Fox's marriage to Margaret Fell in October 1669), Whitehead possessed a patient temperament which was highly effective in dealing with internal dissent and acted as a useful counterbalance to Fox's singular approach.<br>
<br>Whitehead continued to meet Charles II: in January 1680 he presented evidence to the king about how the Friends were confused with Roman Catholics. The following year he was part of a group that attempted unsuccessfully to persuade Charles to free Quakers imprisoned at Bristol. Undaunted, he kept the king informed of the sufferings of Friends in the provinces at meetings in February 1682 and February 1683, defended Quaker language and dress policy in April 1683, and denied Quaker complicity in the Rye House plot in August. The succession of James II in 1685 did not impede Whitehead's access to the monarch: he was impressing on James the extent of Quaker imprisonments and distraints at meetings with the king in early 1686. By June that year Whitehead had helped secure from James warrants for the release of Quaker prisoners and relaxations of the economic and other judicial penalties and prejudices against Quakers. The following April, James issued a declaration of indulgence (granting liberty of conscience) after a further series of interviews in which Whitehead played a major role. Whitehead's conferences with the crown, however, did not mean he was not still subject to arrests and imprisonments for his activities. In 1682&#150;3 he had goods seized to the value of &pound;40 following non-payment of fines for breaching the <span class="roman">Conventicles Act</span>; in August 1683 he was arrested for preaching at Westminster; and in August 1684 alone he had &pound;32 worth of goods seized, was arrested for preaching at Southwark, and was convicted following an arrest at a meeting in White Hart Lane, resulting in imprisonment in Newgate for ten days.<br>
<br>The death of his wife, Anne, on 28 July 1686 prompted Whitehead to publish a collection of personal testimonies to her memory, <span class="italic">Piety Promoted by Faithfulness</span> (1686). Two years later he married Ann Goddard, a shopkeeper in Whitechapel and the daughter of Captain Richard Goddard, a clothier; the ceremony took place at Devonshire House on 19 July 1688. Whitehead later described her as &#145;an ingenious and careful Wife&#146;  (Whitehead, 323). They had only one child, who died at birth. The change of monarch at the end of 1688 presented further opportunities for Whitehead's skills as a lobbyist, allowing him to secure the passing of the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span> in 1689. However, further petitioning was needed in order to gain legal recognition of the fact that, since Quakers refused to take oaths, they were exempt from most of the benefits of the act: namely, rights to take legal action, prove or administer wills, and take up freedoms in cities and corporations, and, in some places, electoral rights. Following the deaths of Fox in 1691 (at whose funeral Whitehead was one of five Quakers who testified) and another leading Quaker, Stephen Crisp, in 1692, Whitehead became the acknowledged leader of the Quaker movement. He continued his campaign for toleration, with his comparison of the Quakers to the tolerated Dutch Mennonites moving William III to such an extent that the king ordered the release of another wave of Quakers from prison. Whitehead was also principally responsible for the <span class="roman">Affirmation Act</span> of 1696, a compromise over the issue of oath-taking that in itself offended many Friends, who then implicitly directed much of their criticism at Whitehead. (The issue was not resolved until twenty years later, when parliament finally legislated an acceptable form of affirmation.) Whitehead also succeeded in having the Friends exempted from an act requiring that every dissenting preacher buy a licence for 20<i>s</i>. a quarter.<br>
<br>In addition to his lobbying activities, Whitehead promoted the Quakers in print. In a series of tracts between 1699 and 1712 he defended the principles of the Friends several times, usually against hostile attacks. His health began to fail in 1711 but he continued to address successive monarchs on behalf of the Friends: Queen Anne, George I, and even the future George II. Whitehead died on 8 March 1724 and was buried in the Quaker burial-ground at Bunhill Fields on 13 March. His monthly meeting issued a testimony celebrating him as an &#145;Elder worthy of double honour&#146;  (Beck, 120). Whitehead's own account of his life up to 1711 (the bulk of which concerned his activities before 1689) was published posthumously in 1725 as <span class="italic">The Christian Progress of that Ancient Servant and Minister of Jesus Christ, George Whitehead</span>. The early twentieth-century Quaker historian William Braithwaite was unimpressed by Whitehead's leadership, describing him as &#145;cautious and pedestrian &hellip; the embodiment of worthy and drab respectability, devoid of genius, and of little humour&#146;  (Braithwaite, 177&#150;8). However, as a legal expert and someone who was evidently skilled at gaining, maintaining, and exploiting effectively access to no fewer than seven monarchs, Whitehead was crucial to the development, establishment, and recognition of the Quaker movement.<br>
