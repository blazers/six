<span class="headword">Hill,  George</span>  (1750&#150;1819), <span class="occ">theologian and college head</span>, was born in St Andrews on 22 May 1750, the eldest of the eight children of the Revd John Hill (<i>d</i>. 1765) and his second wife, Jean McCormick (<i>d</i>. 1796), daughter of his colleague John McCormick and a great-niece of William Carstares, the former principal of Edinburgh University. He was educated at the grammar school and university of St Andrews, graduating MA in 1765. During his second session of divinity studies at St Mary's College, Hill's scholastic ability attracted the patronage of the eighth earl of Kinnoul, then university chancellor and a key supporter of the moderate party in the Church of Scotland. Kinnoul encouraged Hill's uncle Joseph McCormick, the principal of the United College, to introduce Hill to the historian William Robertson, who subsequently recommended him as tutor to the eldest son of Pryse Campbell MP, one of the lords of the Treasury. In this capacity he travelled to London in 1767 and to Edinburgh in 1768, where he concluded his studies in divinity. During that time Hill became Robertson's prot&eacute;g&eacute;, and was introduced to various ecclesiastical and literary figures, including David Hume. Hill became a member of the Edinburgh Speculative Society and a frequent visitor in the home of Henry Dundas.<br>
<br>In 1772 Kinnoul made it possible for Hill to purchase the Greek professorship at St Andrews, a post which he held for the next sixteen years. Licensed to preach in 1775, he served as assistant at St Leonard's until he was appointed minister of the second charge of St Andrews by the town council in May 1780. On 7 June 1782 he married Harriet Scott (<i>d</i>. 1825); they had twelve children, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13268/', "Alexander Hill (1785&#150;1867)")</script>, later divinity professor at Glasgow.<br>
<br>Highly esteemed as a preacher and as a lecturer, Hill zealously discharged his pastoral and academic duties for the balance of his career. In 1787 he was made DD by the University of St Andrews and was appointed dean of the Order of the Thistle. He became professor of divinity at St Mary's College in 1788 and principal in 1791. Hill was elected moderator of the general assembly in 1789, and was appointed one of the king's chaplains for Scotland in 1791 and a dean of the Chapel Royal in 1799. He became minister of the first charge of St Andrews in 1808.<br>
<br>Hill's initial rise to national prominence was based on his management of Scottish ecclesiastical affairs on behalf of the Dundas interest. Upon Robertson's unexpected retirement from church politics in 1780 Hill quickly assumed the leadership of the moderate party in the general assembly, a role which he earned through his ability as a speaker, his business capacity, understanding of church law, and his conciliatory spirit. These powers of oratory and persuasion, coupled with the support of Dundas, enabled the moderate party to dominate the assembly for another generation. In spite of his spirited defence of patronage, Hill was also widely respected by evangelical leaders, and disputes over the practice subsided until after his death.<br>
<br>While other moderate clergymen turned their abilities to &#145;improvements&#146; in literature and science Hill devoted himself to the advancement of theology and theological education. <span class="italic">Lectures in Divinity</span> (1821), which he prepared for publication prior to his death, became the standard textbook in Presbyterian seminaries in Scotland and America until after the mid-nineteenth century. In addition Hill also published <span class="italic">The Advantages of Searching the Scriptures</span> (1787), <span class="italic">Theological Institutes</span> (1803), <span class="italic">Lectures upon Portions of the Old Testament</span> (1812), and a number of sermons.<br>
<br>Hill's theology continued in the moderate common sense tradition by emphasizing the need for a rigorous defence of traditional Christianity in the face of Enlightenment scepticism, represented by Socinianism and deism. At the same time the <span class="italic">Lectures</span> presented a concise, orderly exposition of Calvinism and endeavoured to limit the moderate tendency to rely upon natural theology by stressing the reliability and primacy of biblical revelation. In grappling with the claims of traditional orthodoxy and the priorities of the Enlightenment, Hill formulated a theology which increased the common ground between the moderate and evangelical factions and strengthened the church as a whole. This rapprochement was further enhanced by Hill's commitment to excellence in theological training and his encouragement of preaching that emphasized both doctrine and practical morality.<br>
<br>While in many respects Hill was responsible for the dominance of the moderates during his lifetime, other aspects of his legacy furthered the demise of his party. His rigid social conservatism, his ecclesiology, which in many ways subordinated the church to the state, and his uniting of the fortunes of his party with the Dundas interest allowed the moderates to dominate the Church of Scotland during the reactionary Napoleonic era, but did little to prepare them for the evolution in social thinking which would follow. Theologically, his resistance to the notion that only naturalistic explanations of the origins and contents of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> were acceptable may also help to explain why such liberal thought found little foothold in Scotland until well after 1850. It was the popularity of his <span class="italic">Lectures</span> which may in part have helped to stem criticism during the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Hill died from a series of strokes on 19 December 1819 and was buried in the cemetery at St Andrews Cathedral.<br>
