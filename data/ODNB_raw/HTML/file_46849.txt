<span class="headword">Cowlin, Sir  Francis Nicholas</span>  (1868&#150;1945), <span class="occ">building contractor</span>, was born on 23 September 1868 in Bristol, the second eldest of ten children of William Henry Cowlin (1841&#150;1890), building contractor, and Annie (<i>b</i>. 1844), said to be the daughter of a plumbing contractor. He was educated privately and at nineteen joined his father's firm. In 1889 he enrolled at University College, Bristol, while remaining in the firm. Upon William Cowlin's death in 1890, control of the firm passed to the sons, of whom the eldest died in 1896.<br>
<br>Frank Cowlin, as he was known, was the senior of two partners and brothers (a third joined later) running a substantial business. Under their management the firm, William Cowlin &amp; Son, enhanced its local reputation for progressiveness, and it carried out a succession of prestigious works including the 1892 restoration of Bristol Cathedral. In 1889 Cowlin diversified by acquiring an estate agency. He became a member, and sometime chairman, of the local branch of the Building Employers' Federation. Despite the Edwardian building recession the firm expanded in 1906 and began building a series of technically innovative reinforced concrete buildings. Cowlin's liberal political outlook found expression in 1908 in founder membership of Bristol Garden Suburb Association, and again in 1910 in the instigation of a small pension fund for some employees. The following year he was appointed a director (later he became chairman) of what was to become the Bristol and West Building Society. He further extended his firm in 1915 with decorating and warehousing services.<br>
<br>Important building works included numerous churches and prominent public and commercial buildings, largely in the Bristol area. Overseas works included the treasury in Kingston, Jamaica (after earthquake damage), and buildings in Toronto, Moose Jaw, and Winnipeg, Canada, and in Brazil. From presidency of the local commercial rooms in 1917, Cowlin progressed to the local chamber of commerce and, in 1921, he became sheriff of Bristol. In 1924, following ventures in housebuilding and quarrying, his firm became a private limited company, with Cowlin as chairman of the board. During his lifetime he transformed the business&#151;its working capital multiplied nearly sixfold between 1900 (&pound;36,000) and 1946 (&pound;212,000). He was also chairman of the Bristol Waterworks Company and in 1929 became a director of the local gas company. Widening business interests contrasted with more geographically confined building works, although their scale and diversity remained undiminished. With his career at its peak, he was knighted in 1935. He was elected to the board of Eagle Star Insurance in 1940. He was also elected a fellow of the Institute of Builders, and FRSA.<br>
<br>Cowlin contributed unstintingly to a great variety of local concerns in sport, philanthropy, and the arts. In 1904 he was granted honorary life membership of Bristol Rugby Football Club, and his generous patronage led to its presidency, and, late in life, recognition as the &#145;grand old man of Bristol rugby&#146;. He acted as president of three local charities, chairman of the local branch of the National Playing Fields Association and the council of the Royal West of England Academy, was a director of the local YMCA, and served on two hospital boards. A contemporary caricature depicted him in his mid-fifties as a handsome, warm, and open-looking golf player with moustache and pipe. Although a widely popular character, flourishing in public and civic life, he appears to have disliked publicity. A rare trait was his balance of high business acumen, sociability, public spiritedness, and appreciation of the arts. For his last thirty-five years he lived at Rodborough House, Ivywell Road, Sneyd Park, Bristol. He died a bachelor, aged seventy-six, on 26 July 1945 at Park Cottage, Cleeve, Somerset, and his ashes were buried on 30 July at Stoke Bishop parish church, Bristol, after a funeral service in Bristol Cathedral.<br>
