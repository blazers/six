<span class="headword">Jaggard,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1568&#150;1623), <span class="occ">printer and bookseller</span>, was the son of John Jaggard, a London barber&#150;surgeon, and his wife, Bridget. On 20 August 1584 he was apprenticed for eight years from 29 September to the distinguished printer Henry Denham; his brother John was apprenticed to another printer, Richard Tottel, on 29 October. William became a freeman of the Stationers' Company on 6 December 1591. He set up shop as a publisher and on 26 August 1594 married Jayne (or Jane) Uriane 
    (or Vriane; <i>d</i>. 1625)
  ; a son, Isaac, was baptized on 19 April 1595; three other children, Thomas, Joan, and Alice, figure in his will.<br>
<br>Jaggard's first book was registered with the Stationers' Company on 4 March 1595; he rapidly became a successful businessman. Ill feeling followed his publication in 1599 of <span class="italic">The Passionate Pilgrim</span>. Ascribed to Shakespeare, this poetical anthology includes versions of sonnets 138 and 144, three extracts from <span class="italic">Love's Labour's Lost</span>, and other short poems, some by writers other than Shakespeare, others of unknown authorship. In a third edition of 1612 Jaggard added without authority nine poems from <span class="italic">Troia Britannica</span> (1609) by Thomas Heywood. Heywood, in his <span class="italic">Apology for Actors</span> (1612), protested and declared Shakespeare &#145;much offended with M. <i>Iaggard</i> (that altogether unknowne to him) presumed to make so bold with his name&#146;  (sig. G4<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>). The original title-page was replaced with one that did not mention Shakespeare's name.<br>
<br>Jaggard's career prospered. He seems to have taken at least nine apprentices, the last in November 1622; one, bound in 1610, was John Shakespeare, son of a Warwick butcher. In 1601 Jaggard collaborated with Thomas Pavier to publish the only book of his own composition, a summary history of the lord mayors of London from Elizabeth's accession until 1601. In the following year he received permission to print playbills (none survive) for Worcester's Men, paying a royalty of 4<i>s</i>. a month to James Roberts, who held the monopoly. In 1604 Jaggard received a lucrative royal commission to print the ten commandments for use in churches throughout the country. In the same year he set up a small printing house of his own in the Barbican. About this time he entered into partnership with Roberts, and two years later he bought and moved into Roberts's larger establishment when Roberts retired from active trade. On 17 December 1610 Jaggard became official printer to the City of London. About 1612 he became blind as a result of syphilis; an account of his treatment is preserved in the British Library (BL, Sloane MS 640). On 23 June 1613 Isaac Jaggard was admitted freeman of the company by patrimony, doubtless to help his father.<br>
<br>In 1619 Jaggard was hired by Pavier (probably in association with Nathaniel Butter and Arthur Johnson) to print a quarto collection of ten plays by and attributed to Shakespeare. He had printed four volumes before the lord chamberlain attempted to stop the venture by ordering the Stationers' Company that no plays belonging to the King's Men were to be printed or reprinted without permission. Pavier and his associates, however, persuaded Jaggard to print the remaining plays with false dates so that they could be passed off as remainders of earlier editions. This fraud caused much editorial confusion until it was exposed as the result of bibliographical detective work by A. W. Pollard, Sir W. W. Greg, and others.<br>
<br>Jaggard is best remembered as printer of the first folio of Shakespeare; printing was completed in late October or early November of 1623, about the time of his death. The colophon names him among those at whose charges the volume was printed, but the title-page (probably printed last) names Isaac, who on 4 November became printer to the City of London &#145;in the place of William Jaggard his late Father deceased&#146;  (CLRO, letter book JJ, fol. 51). Jaggard's will, made on 28 March 1623, appointed his wife, Jane, as executor and Thomas Pavier as one of the overseers of his substantial estate. It was proved on 17 November.<br>
