<span class="headword">Thomson,  Henry William <span class="st"> [<em>later </em>Henry Byerley]</span></span>  (1822&#150;1867), <span class="occ">judge in Ceylon</span>, was born in Chelsea, London, in May 1822, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27293/', "Anthony Todd Thomson (1778&#150;1849)")</script>, physician, and his second wife, Katherine Byerley (1797&#150;1862) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27319/', "Thomson, Katherine")</script>], novelist and biographer, of an old Durham family (in 1846 he changed his second forename to Byerley). He was educated at University College, London, and at Jesus College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1841, was a scholar in 1844, and graduated BA as senior optime in 1846. He was admitted at the Inner Temple on 25 April 1846, called to the bar on 14 May 1849, and practised on the northern circuit.<br>
<br>Thomson specialized in military and international law, and published <span class="italic">Laws of War Affecting Commerce and Shipping</span> (1854), <span class="italic">The military forces and institutions of Great Britain and Ireland: their constitution, administration, and government, military and civil</span> (1855), based on much unused material from parliamentary blue books and similar sources, and <span class="italic">The choice of a profession: a concise account and comparative review of the English professions</span> (1857).<br>
<br>Thomson was then living at 8 Serjeants' Inn, Temple, and professional success seemed distant when, in May 1858, he was appointed queen's advocate in Ceylon by the colonial secretary, Lord Stanley [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26266/', "Stanley, Edward Henry, fifteenth earl of Derby")</script>]. The same year Thomson married Mlle Sarita Beaumont; they had two sons, Henry Byerley, who took orders in 1888, and Arthur Byerley. In 1861 Thomson was promoted puisne judge of the supreme court of Colombo. He soon started work on a digest of the law as administered in Ceylon, and in 1866 he was in London superintending the publication of his most permanent memorial, <span class="italic">Institutes of the Laws of Ceylon</span> (2 vols., 1866), which ranked as an authority together with the judgments of Sir Charles Marshall, and which, as the chief justice of Ceylon Sir Edward Creasy said at Thomson's death, &#145;will long be cited with admiration and gratitude&#146;. Thomson died at Colombo, as the result of an apoplectic seizure, on 5 January 1867. He was buried that month, probably in Colombo, and was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>The judge's younger brother <a name="cosubject_27317"></a><span class="headword">John Cockburn Thomson</span>  (1834&#150;1860), <span class="occ">Sanskritist</span>, was born in London, and after studying at Bonn matriculated from Trinity College, Oxford, on 7 June 1852 and graduated BA from St Mary Hall (later incorporated into Oriel College) in 1857. At Oxford he worked at Sanskrit (continuing studies begun at Munich) under Horace Hayman Wilson, and before he graduated, when only twenty-one, he published <span class="italic">The Bhagavad-gita, or, A discourse between Krishna and Arjuna on divine matters: a Sanskrit philosophical poem, translated [into English prose] with copious notes, an introduction on Sanskrit philosophy, and other matter</span> (2 vols., 1855). This was praised by Wilson and by foreign scholars and was used in the East India College, Haileybury. In 1857 Thomson won the Boden Sanskrit scholarship at Oxford, and was awarded a gold medal by Maximilian of Bavaria. He was a member of the Asiatic Society of Paris and the Antiquarian Society of Normandy. Under the pseudonym Philip Wharton he was joint author with his mother of <span class="italic">Queens of Society</span> (1860) and <span class="italic">Wits and Beaux of Society</span> (1860), two anecdotal volumes well received by the public. Following Wilson's death in 1860 Thomson became a candidate for the India Office librarianship but he was accidentally drowned when swimming at Tenby, Pembrokeshire, on 26 May 1860. He was unmarried.<br>
