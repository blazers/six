<span class="headword">Hill,  Frederic</span>  (1803&#150;1896), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born on 29 June 1803 at Hill Top School, Gough Street, Birmingham, the sixth of the eight children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13313/', "Thomas Wright Hill (1763&#150;1851)")</script>, schoolmaster, and his wife, Sarah Lea (1765&#150;1842). Two of his five brothers achieved professional eminence, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13299/', "Rowland Hill")</script> as a postal reformer and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13286/', "Matthew Davenport Hill")</script> as a criminologist and penal reformer; another brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13272/', "Edwin Hill")</script>. Frederic was educated at his family's school which, under the name Hazelwood (from 1819), gained an international reputation for its progressive regime. At the age of thirteen he became an assistant teacher at the school. In the early 1830s he was an active <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> campaigner, becoming a member, later a council member, of the Birmingham Political Union. With the passing of the <span class="roman">Reform Act</span> he turned his attention to educational questions and published <span class="italic">National Education: its Present State and Prospects</span> (1836). Between 1832 and 1856 he was investment manager of the Hill family fund, which was created to provide financial support to any of the siblings who encountered straitened circumstances.<br>
<br>When, in 1833, Hazelwood was sold, Hill's teaching career came to an end. He had long cherished the idea of entering the civil service, and his brother Matthew advised him, as a preliminary, to study the law. On 25 November 1834 Hill was admitted a student of Lincoln's Inn. He was called to the bar on 29 January 1840, but never practised as a barrister. In 1834 he was appointed parliamentary secretary to Matthew's friend Sergeant Wilde (later Lord Truro). In the following year he obtained one of the newly created prison inspectorships. The home secretary, Lord John Russell, appointed him to the Scottish district, which also comprised Northumberland and Durham, on the grounds that &#145;there is most work to be done there and I know you will do it&#146;  (Hill, 116). Hill's initial salary of &pound;600 per annum was raised to &pound;700 in 1841. Hill was shocked by the state of the Scottish prisons: he found most of them insanitary, insecure, cold, and damp. Inadequately supervised, the prisoners were indolent, drunken, overfed, foul-mouthed gamblers. In his first report (1836) Hill proposed numerous reforms.<br>
<br>Hill helped prepare the <span class="roman">Act to Improve Prisons and Prison Discipline in Scotland</span> (2 &amp; 3 Vict. c. 42) which created a board of directors of Scottish prisons, on which Hill served from September 1839. He was then able to influence policy and practice in the Scottish prison system. He was especially concerned to achieve the abolition of the treadmill and handcrank and the introduction of useful labour for which prisoners would be paid at market rates for the voluntary performance of work in excess of ten hours a day. He also presided over the abolition of flogging and the introduction of the &#145;separate system&#146; of prison discipline. In April 1840 Hill married Martha Cowper (<i>b</i>. 1802/3), a sister of the inventor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6504/', "Edward Shickle Cowper")</script>. They had three daughters.<br>
<br>In 1847, partly on the grounds that his work in Scotland was finished, but also because he wished to live nearer to his brothers and aged father, Hill obtained a transfer to the inspectorship of an English prison district (initially northern England and north Wales). He found the English prisons in his charge to be largely unreformed. His attempts to change them were hampered by county justices, and the resulting frustration was a factor in his resignation of the inspectorship in 1851. Although Hill's professional association with prisons ceased at this point, he remained actively interested in questions of crime and punishment, especially through his membership of such bodies as the Law Amendment Society, the Reformatory and Refuge Union, and the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science. In 1853 he published <span class="italic">Crime: its Amount, Causes and Remedies</span>, in which he set out his criminological and penological ideas. Among these were opposition to the death penalty (he thought murderers should be permanently imprisoned), support for indeterminate sentences from which prisoners could obtain their release only by giving evidence of reformation, and the imposition of charges on parents whose children were incarcerated.<br>
<br>In June 1851 Hill was appointed assistant secretary to the postmaster-general and, therefore, deputy to his brother Rowland. Although this position was probably inferior to that of prison inspector, Hill remained in it until its abolition in 1875. His salary on retirement was &pound;1400 per annum, at which point he was granted a civil service pension of &pound;1000 per annum. Hill's achievements at the Post Office included several reforms of postal practice along with the introduction of new systems of ventilation and fire precautions. It was at his suggestion, in 1854, that the postmaster-general began to submit an annual report to parliament. Hill compiled the first fourteen of these himself. Hill's last years at the Post Office were marked by policy disagreements with heads of departments. After his retirement articles in the Post Office's magazine described him as &#145;somewhat reserved and silent&#146; and intensely conservative in his attitude towards personnel aspects of civil service reform  (<span class="italic">St Martin's-le-Grand</span>, vols. 4 and 7).<br>
<br>In addition to the books already mentioned Hill wrote newspaper articles and pamphlets on a variety of subjects including punishment, local government, and civil defence. Between 1836 and 1847 he compiled annual reports as an inspector of prisons. Between 1847 and the mid-1860s he gave evidence to official inquiries on crime, punishment, and railways. He continued to lecture and write on public issues until late in life. In retirement he was also active in charitable work, being a co-founder of the Hampstead branch of the Charity Organization Society and a member of Hampstead's board of guardians. His autobiography, <span class="italic">Frederic Hill: an Autobiography of Fifty Years in Times of Reform</span> (1893), was completed and edited by his daughter Constance. Hill died on 17 November 1896 at his home, Inverleith House, 27 Thurlow Road, Hampstead. His body was cremated.<br>
