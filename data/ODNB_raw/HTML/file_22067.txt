<span class="headword">Petto,  Samuel</span>  (<em>c.</em>1624&#150;1711), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, may possibly have been connected with the Peyto family of Chesterton, near Leamington, Warwickshire. He was admitted as a sizar at St Catharine's College, Cambridge, on 15 June 1644, matriculated on 19 March 1645, and graduated MA. In 1648 he was admitted as rector of Sandcroft, in the deanery of South Elmham, Suffolk. Perhaps a little later he married; his wife's name was Mary, and they baptized a son, Samuel, at South Elmham St Cross on 27 April 1654, but Mary died the next year. In the summer of 1654 Petto was reported to be paid &pound;36 a year for his services at Sandcroft, and to give a sermon every second Sunday at nearby Homersfield. He was at Sandcroft when on 4 May 1658 the council of state recommended that he be granted an augmentation of &pound;50 per annum. In a letter of 17 August 1658 to Samuel Slater, of the Independent church at St Katharine by the Tower, Petto reported that while many Suffolk Independents opposed or doubted infant baptism, none had themselves been rebaptized and all were happily in communion with the majority who differed in the matter. His own congregational views embraced the practice of lay preaching, and on this subject he engaged in 1658&#150;9 with Frederick Woodall of Woodbridge, Suffolk, and John Martin of Edgfield, Nottinghamshire, against Matthew Pool's <span class="italic">Quo warranto</span>, a work commissioned by the London Provincial Assembly, and <span class="italic">Vindiciae ministerii evangelici revindicate</span> (1658) by John Collinges, who conceded in his foreword that their efforts were the work of &#145;grave and sober persons, with a good show of argument&#146;. After ejection from Sandcroft in 1660 Petto moved to nearby Wortwell-cum-Alburgh, Norfolk, and continued his ministry in the area. In 1669 he was preaching in Norfolk at Yarmouth, at Denton, and to an auditory of over 300 at Gillingham. On 8 May 1672 he was licensed as a congregational teacher at his own house at Wortwell, and at the house of John Wesgate at Redenhall. About two years later Petto began his long association with the town of Sudbury, Suffolk.<br>
<br>A Sudbury corporation document of 5 October 1669 reported that &#145;there is no settled minister&#146; in the town and that services depended &#145;upon the goodwill and benevolence of the people&#146; of whom the greater part &#145;meet in conventicles and absent themselves&#146;  (<span class="italic">Short History</span>, 152&#150;3); it was resolved to seek an act of parliament to provide proper maintenance. This evidently this did not materialize for in 1684 local tories alleged that the former mayor John Catesby had so favoured dissenters, that &#145;Mr Petto the Nonconformist preacher in the barn&#146; had been unmolested there for ten years, only once having been brought before the quarter sessions, and then not punished. Petto had, moreover, with his wife and family &#145;constantly lived within the said Corporation for ten years last past, in no more private place than in the Vicarage House belonging to All Saints Church&#146;  (Hodson, <span class="italic">Independents</span>, 53&#150;4). Petto had other problems at Sudbury. On 31 August 1677 he wrote to Increase Mather that:<blockquote>lately one of my daughters is become a prodigal, &amp; about 10 dayes ago resolved to go beyond sea, hath obscured herself in order to that end, so as I have been searching for her all this week in London &amp; cannot find her; she was a sempster in the city and might have lived well, but on a suddain is bent to ramble and hath sinned greatly against the Lord by falsehoods. (&#145;Letters of Samuel Petto&#146;, 341)</blockquote>Before the following 14 May the prodigal had returned. In 1690 Petto was reported still to be a preacher at Sudbury, with his second wife, Martha, and twelve children to support and in receipt of &pound;45 per annum.<br>
<br>Petto was a firm believer in the power of witchcraft and in 1693 published <span class="italic">A faithful narrative of the wonderful and extraordinary fits, which Mr Thomas Spatchett, minister of Dunwich and Cockley, was under by witchcraft</span>, in which he claimed that despite hearing her confession in 1665 the justices refused to punish the alleged culprit because she bewitched only Spatchett and another local puritan, one Manning. Petto did not see his belief in occult powers as incompatible with his interest in science. He wrote in <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> of the appearance in the sky over Sudbury on 28 December 1698 of three &#145;suns&#146;, and was aware that these were &#145;really one true sun; the reflections of its beams cause such images&#146;  (<span class="italic">PTRS</span>, 21, 1699, 107). Petto was greatly respected by dissenters in the district. He died in Sudbury in 1711 and was buried in the churchyard of All Saints, Sudbury, on 21 September. His son-in-law, the Revd Josias Maultby, had been appointed as his copastor in 1707; after Petto's death he continued as pastor until emigrating to Rotterdam in 1719.<br>
