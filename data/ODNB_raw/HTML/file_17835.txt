<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Maitland, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1760&#150;1824), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial official</span>, was born on 10 March 1760, probably at the family seat, Hatton House, Ratho, Edinburghshire, the second surviving son of James Maitland, seventh earl of Lauderdale (1718&#150;1789), and his wife, Mary Turner (1733/4&#150;1789), daughter and coheir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16956/', "Alderman Sir Thomas Lombe (1685&#150;1739)")</script> of Old Jewry, London. He was the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17825/', "James Maitland")</script>, the eighth earl. He was educated at Lincoln's Inn (1774) and Edinburgh (1775&#150;7). He retained his Scottish accent all his life. Shortly after his birth, he was appointed lieutenant in the old Scots 17th light dragoons or Edinburgh light horse, and after it was disbanded in 1763, drew half pay of his rank until 1778.<h2>
<a name="ArmyandIndia17781790"></a>Army and India, 1778&#150;1790</h2>In 1778 Maitland took up his commission (captain, 14 January 1778) and raised a company for the Seaforth regiment or 78th (from 1786 72nd) Highlanders. With the regiment, in which his younger brother William also held a commission, Maitland served some years in India, ashore against Haidar Ali and Tipu Sultan of Mysore, and afloat under Admiral Sir Edward Hughes against the French under Pierre Andr&eacute; de Suffren. In June 1783 he was wounded in Hughes's action with Suffren off Cuddalore on the Coromandel coast. He distinguished himself at the capture of the Mysorean fortress of Palicatchery in November 1784. Later he was brigade major of the king's troops at Calcutta, and was transferred by Lord Cornwallis to a similar post at Madras, at his own request, when war was imminent in 1790.<h2>
<a name="Memberofparliament17901813"></a>Member of parliament, 1790&#150;1813</h2>Maitland's brother, the eighth earl, a relatively radical whig with strong electoral interest in the Haddington burghs, decided to return Maitland for them. Following a contested election in 1790 with blatant corruption by both sides, Maitland was elected. He was MP from July 1790 to 1796, from March 1802 to February 1805, and from October 1812 to July 1813. An opposition whig, he supported Charles Grey. In his maiden speech (28 February 1791) he criticized the war with Tipu Sultan, and in April he supported Grey's motion against the Russian armament. His late Victorian biographer, Walter Frewen Lord, wrote that he was &#145;what we now call a Little Englander&#146;  (Lord, 9). In May 1791 he was admitted to the Whig Club and in June to Brooks's. In February and March 1792 he brought in motions against the war with Tipu. One of the Society of the Friends of the People, in 1792 he supported parliamentary reform. On 21 February 1793 he seconded Grey's motion against war with revolutionary France. In 1794 and 1795 he criticized the government's conduct of the war, opposed barrack-building as conducive to military despotism, opposed commissions to French &eacute;migr&eacute;s&#151;Lord wrote of his xenophobic &#145;ravings&#146;&#151;and criticized the Toulon expedition and the occupation of Corsica. He continued to vote against the government until June 1795, after which he was sent to St Domingue.<br>
<br>After the Belle &Icirc;le expedition of 1800 Maitland, disappointed at failing to gain further military employment, resumed his seat, vacated for him by the sitting member Robert Baird, in March 1802. W. F. Lord wrote that he &#145;never appeared again as an obstructionist, or a Little Englander &hellip; he rarely spoke, and always as an imperialist&#146;  (Lord, 18). He supported the Addington ministry and its defence policy against critics including Pitt. Pitt's return to power in May 1804 left Maitland in the political wilderness, but apparently there were ministerialist hopes of detaching him from the opposition. That winter he accepted the governorship of Ceylon and persuaded his brother to agree to his seat being occupied by a friend of the ministry. Following the 1812 general election he resumed his seat. He advocated suppression of sedition in Yorkshire, and in May 1813 voted for Roman Catholic relief. Soon after, disillusioned with politics and &#145;not liking to quarrel with Lauderdale and yet neither liking his friends Grey or Grenville&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1790&#150;1820</span>, 529), he accepted the governorship of Malta.<h2>
<a name="StDomingue17951798"></a>St Domingue, 1795&#150;1798</h2>In the 1780s St Domingue (later Haiti), exporting sugar and over half the world's coffee, was the most lucrative French colony, producing more than the entire British West Indies and with more trade than the United States. In 1791 slaves revolted, and some of the colonists requested British intervention. Following the outbreak of war between Britain and revolutionary France (February 1793), Pitt and Dundas's strategy was to destroy France's naval and commercial power by capturing its West Indian colonies. In September 1793 Sir Charles Grey's expeditionary force landed at St Domingue, in co-operation with royalist colonists. They captured Mole St Nicholas, &#145;the Gibraltar of the West Indies&#146;  (Fortescue, <span class="italic">Brit. army</span>, 330), a key naval base, and the capital, Port au Prince, and occupied about a third of the colony. Opposing them were French republican, ex-slave, and mulatto forces, commanded by Toussaint l'Ouverture and others. Although reinforced by the 1796 &#145;great expedition&#146;, the British, weakened by disease, were unable to decisively defeat their enemies and capture the interior and north. They suffered catastrophic losses from yellow fever, malaria, dysentery, and other diseases, exacerbated by lead-contaminated rum. The majority, at least three-fifths, of British troops there died: it was &#145;among the greatest disasters in British military history&#146;  (Geggus, &#145;British government&#146;, 285).<br>
<br>Maitland was appointed major in the 62nd foot in 1790, and promoted lieutenant-colonel in the army in March 1794 and in the regiment in August 1794. From 1795 he commanded a half-battalion of it in St Domingue. A well-connected Scottish aristocrat, he was able to communicate his views to Dundas. Pessimistic and critical of the British intervention and doubting it could succeed, he wrote in July 1796 emphasizing British mortality, alleging that &#145;St. Domingo will end in being a Brigand Republick&#146;  (Geggus, <span class="italic">Slavery, War, and Revolution</span>, 205), and arguing that if the occupation had to be continued it should be minimal and defensive. He served under General John Graves Simcoe (1752&#150;1806) but reported separately to Whitehall, continuing pessimistic and critical of the French colonists. Appointed brigadier-general at St Domingue (18 April), in August 1797 he returned to England.<br>
<br>The British government, lacking resources, in January 1798 ordered the new commander for St Domingue, Major-General Nesbitt, to implement a partial evacuation, but he died at Madeira. Maitland, appointed brigadier-general in the West Indies (1 January 1798), designated Nesbitt's chief of staff, and informed of the government's intentions, had travelled ahead, leaving England in January and arriving in St Domingue in March. The senior officer there, Major-General John Whyte, &#145;tacitly abdicated&#146;  (Fortescue, <span class="italic">Brit. army</span>, 555) to Maitland and eventually returned home. Maitland, whose still effective troops and naval blockade enabled him to bargain, negotiated with Toussaint l'Ouverture&#151;whom he considered cunning but not very able or determined&#151;the British surrender of the western province, including the capital, and in May implemented a successful evacuation of it. Reporting to Dundas he emphasized British mortality&#151;&#145;the British force may now be truly said to be in a galloping consumption&#146;  (Lord, 43)&#151;and advocated total evacuation. After the government's instructions to Nesbitt arrived in late July, permitting total evacuation, Maitland seized his opportunity. Despite opposition from Major-General Alexander Lindsay, sixth earl of Balcarres (1752&#150;1825), the governor of Jamaica, and Vice-Admiral Sir Hyde Parker (1739&#150;1807), the naval commander, who both favoured retention of the Mole to defend Jamaica, Maitland, though ill probably with dysentery&#151;he wrote &#145;I shall never recover the shock to my health&#146;  (Lord, 47)&#151;in August negotiated separately with Toussaint and Andr&eacute; Rigaud. He secured an agreement with Toussaint for an unmolested evacuation, a guarantee for French colonists remaining, and future non-aggression and trade. He wrote, &#145;Thank God I have at length got Great Britain rid of the whole of the incumbrance in this Island&#146;  (Duffy, 309). Hostilities ceased on 20 August 1798 and he carried out a successful evacuation, taking artillery, stores, and almost everything of military value. He sailed on 31 August, and the evacuation of the Mole was completed by Colonel Spencer on 3 October. Meanwhile in London the government had changed policy, deciding to hold the last strongpoints on St Domingue to defend Jamaica: but, with seaborne communications, they were too late. On his own initiative Maitland had extricated Britain from the St Domingue imbroglio. Later historians criticized Sir John Fortescue's scathing account in his <span class="italic">History of the British Army</span> of the British involvement in St Domingue. Nevertheless his praise of Maitland arguably remains valid: &#145;by the supreme strength and courage of a single subordinate officer, England was plucked from the awful morass of confusion, extravagance, death and disaster&#146;  (Fortescue, <span class="italic">Brit. army</span>, 565).<h2>
<a name="Variedemployment17991805"></a>Varied employment, 1799&#150;1805</h2>In 1799 Maitland went on an unsuccessful mission to the United States, arriving in April to negotiate an agreement on trade with St Domingue. In August he returned to England. He went to Cheltenham, then Berkeley Square, London. He was subsequently employed in supporting French royalist military attempts, and in September 1799 was promoted major-general (local rank). He was appointed to command an expedition to capture Belle &Icirc;le, off the coast of Brittany. As Maitland wished, the naval command was given to Sir Edward Pellew (1757&#150;1833), later Viscount Exmouth. Great difficulty was experienced in finding the required 4000 troops. The expedition, inadequately prepared and equipped&#151;W. F. Lord called it &#145;this burlesque army&#146;  (Lord, 63)&#151;sailed from Cork in May 1800, and destroyed the forts on the south end of Quiberon on 4 June, and on 6 June captured some vessels and prisoners. Maitland's royalist force camped on Ile Houat. Reports of the strength of the garrison of Belle &Icirc;le, reinforced apparently because of British lack of pre-operational secrecy, caused Maitland to delay his attack until his entire force had arrived. On 21 June he received orders from Dundas to send his troops to Minorca as reinforcements for the Mediterranean. On 4 July Dundas ordered him home. Fortescue later condemned the expedition as &#145;eminently foolish &hellip; a wanton and wicked waste&#146;  (Fortescue, <span class="italic">Brit. army</span>, 779&#150;80).<br>
<br>In 1803 Maitland was appointed colonel of a battalion of the army of reserve. From November 1803, resigning his parliamentary seat, to May 1804, he was a member (at a salary of &pound;1500 p.a.) of the Board of Control for India, under Addington's ministry, and was sworn of the privy council in November 1803. He was promoted major-general in August 1804, appointed colonel in the third garrison battalion in February 1805, and for a short time had a brigade command in Sussex.<h2>
<a name="Ceylon18051811"></a>Ceylon, 1805&#150;1811</h2>In 1805 Maitland was appointed governor and officer commanding the troops in the crown colony of Ceylon, his exceptional dual appointment presumably resulting from the Colonial Office perception of the problems there. Ceylon government had been troubled under the previous and first British governor, Frederick North (1766&#150;1827), from 1817 fifth earl of Guilford, a well-meaning reformer &#145;of the most pestilent type&#146;  (Lord, 73), under whose lax control finances were disordered and abuses flourished. The previous commander, Major-General David Wemyss, formerly Douglas (1760&#150;1839), was incompetent and extravagant and quarrelled with North and the judges of the supreme court. Moreover, from 1803 a disastrous and expensive war was fought against the inland kingdom of Kandy.<br>
<br>On 18 July 1805 Maitland arrived at Colombo and assumed office. A hard-working, shrewd, and capable administrator, he was a masterful, overbearing, bad-tempered, sometimes unscrupulous autocrat who decided policy, dominated his council, and was disliked by subordinates. In his first six months he investigated the situation, writing a long report. He criticized North's administration as &#145;in many points totally inefficient&#146;  (de Silva, 240), and especially attacked the laxity of his control over the civil service and his tenurial changes. He condemned Wemyss's conduct as &#145;utterly reprehensible&#146;  (de Silva, 239) and his military expenditure as extravagant and often unnecessary, and alleged that the army had &#145;grown far too independent&#146;  (Mills, 47). Realizing the government then lacked the resources to defeat Kandy, and wanting to reduce expenditure, he attempted to make peace. He ended the North&#150;Wemyss policy of economic blockade and military reprisals, remained on the defensive, offered peace terms, and tried to secure them by bribery. The Kandyans refused terms, demanding cession of a sea port, but by tacit agreement hostilities ceased from 1805 to 1815, and Maitland acted largely as if the two states were at peace. He vigorously subordinated the military to the civil authority, suppressed the military board, and reduced military expenditure. He advocated the adequate fortification of Trincomalee, which he claimed was the &#145;real key&#146; to the &#145;naval superiority of India&#146;  (Lord, 96). Following the July 1806 Vellore Sepoy mutiny in Madras, in August he sent troops thither, and subsequently wrote to Gilbert Elliot, Baron Minto (1751&#150;1814), the new governor-general of India, scathingly criticizing the Madras government. Following the 1809 Seringapatam mutiny of company European officers he again sent troops, and he proposed a scheme for the reorganization of the East India Company's army.<br>
<br>Maitland declared, &#145;the sole object of Government is &hellip; to ensure the prosperity of the island solely through the medium of generally increasing the prosperity and happiness of the natives&#146;  (Mills, 57). He paid off debt, introduced rigorous control of expenditure, stopping large leakages, and attempted to balance the budget. He reorganized the civil service and purged it of corruption, increased salaries, and in 1805 forbade civil servants to trade. He offered rewards for proficiency in Sinhalese. He reorganized the central administration&#151;in 1806 abolishing the board of revenue and commerce and substituting a commissioner of revenue under direct orders of the governor&#151;and the provincial administration, replacing the agents of revenue and commerce by collectors under control of the commissioner of revenue. He retained and tightened the profitable government salt monopoly and introduced stamped paper duties. He tried to prevent native officials oppressing the people, and improved policing. He increased the number and powers of magistrates' courts, extended supreme court jurisdiction, and appointed minor courts of appeal. He also instigated juries in criminal cases, introduced by the 1810 charter. The chief justice, Edmund Henry Lushington, interfered with courts martial and executive decisions and quarrelled with Maitland. In 1808 Maitland suspended him from the council, and early in 1809 threatened to suspend him from judicial office. Lushington resigned in February 1809.<br>
<br>Maitland encouraged agriculture, ending North's restrictions on cinnamon production, and increased the area under cultivation. Hoping to increase coffee production, he persuaded the secretary of state in 1810 to permit Europeans to acquire land anywhere in Ceylon. In 1806 he removed the Dutch-imposed disabilities of Roman Catholics, and he conciliated the Buddhists. He did not favour missionaries. His critics in England called him a pagan, and in 1808 Wilberforce criticized his education policy. In the autumn of 1810 Maitland suffered an attack of fever and his health, seriously affected by the climate, suddenly deteriorated. He returned to England in March 1811. His governorship favourably impressed the British government, and according to the Ceylon historian Colvin de Silva was &#145;an outstanding success &hellip; five years of sound and efficient government&#146;  (de Silva, 254).<br>
<br>Maitland was promoted lieutenant-general in June 1811 and appointed colonel of the 10th foot in July. He recuperated in England, taking the waters at Cheltenham. On his recall he was &#145;perhaps worth &pound;25,000 clear&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1790&#150;1820</span>, 529) but lost by the discount on Ceylon paper currency when paying his debts. He wanted employment on the staff, according to the duke of York's secretary, James Willoughby Gordon (1773&#150;1851), who described him as &#145;a very clever man, but he inclines to be prosy&#146;  (ibid.). In 1813 he was proposed as governor of Java.<h2>
<a name="MaltaandtheIonianIslands18131824"></a>Malta and the Ionian Islands, 1813&#150;1824</h2>In July 1813 Maitland was appointed the first governor of Malta, and landed at Valletta on 3 October. Reportedly when offered the post it was proposed that a council be established, but he declared, &#145;Aweel, ye'll just send somebody else, for I'll na be bottle holder for ony mon&#146;  (Hedderwick, 80). He insisted on the &#145;free and unfettered power of the Governor&#146;  (Dixon, 137). A benevolent despot, nicknamed &#145;King Tom&#146;, he imposed reforms, including practices he had tried in Ceylon. On arrival he acted rigorously and apparently effectively against the plague, imposing isolation, quarantine, and disinfection of buildings. He centralized finances under his control, reformed local administration, and reduced corruption. He abolished the Universita, an ancient guild which controlled imports of some foodstuffs and, he wrote, &#145;the most troublesome dunghill of corruption I ever met with&#146;  (Lord, 155). He arranged grain purchase from the Black Sea region, and in 1818 established commissioners of the board of supply, directly responsible to the governor. He found &#145;pure judicial tyranny&#146;  (Dixon, 146) and reformed the judicial system. He introduced trial by jury and forbade judges to interfere with the executive or legislation. He tactfully limited the powers of the Roman Catholic church and, concerned for Maltese susceptibilities, prevented the Board of Ordnance moving Maltese armour from Valletta to England.<br>
<br>From 1815 until 1864 when ceded to Greece, the Ionian islands were a British protectorate. In December 1815 Maitland was appointed, in addition to his Malta post, lord high commissioner of the Ionian islands and commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean, excluding Gibraltar. Also in 1815 British consulates on the Barbary coast, excluding Morocco, were placed under him, and he was made a GCB (2 January). The British then dominated the Mediterranean, and W. F. Lord wrote of Maitland, &#145;He bestrode the Mediterranean like a Colossus&#146;  (Lord, 241). He was paid &pound;5000 as governor of Malta, &pound;3500 as commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean, &pound;1000 as high commissioner, and &pound;1000 as former governor of Ceylon. He went to Ionia in February 1816, and thenceforth spent much more time there than at Malta, for which he was criticized.<br>
<br>Maitland was no philhellene, criticizing their &#145;classic imaginings&#146;  (Lord, 217), and dismissing &#145;fools looking for old stones&#146;  (Young, 106). He formed a low opinion of the Ionians, and wrote of their &#145;duplicity, chicanery and want of principle&#146;  (Dixon, 181). He believed that a representative assembly would fail, as it had in Sicily. He wrote that &#145;if we gave such a people a real constitution, they would simply violate it&#146;  (Lord, 186) and that &#145;a free Government is incompatible with the existence of a strong one&#146;  (Dixon, 185). Required by the British government to establish a constitution, he consulted Ionians and drafted a bicameral one, introduced in 1817, which reserved extensive powers to the high commissioner. According to W. F. Lord its only function was &#145;to throw a decent veil over the despotism of Thomas Maitland&#146;  (Lord, 193). Sir Charles James Napier (1782&#150;1853), who served under Maitland at Cephalonia, described him as &#145;a rough old despot&#146;  (Lord, 114). He ruled despotically and vigorously, preventing liberty of the press, and imposing reforms. He disarmed the islanders, improved administration, increased official salaries, attempted to end bribery and corruption, abolished tax-farming, systematized customs duties, and improved the judicial system and the treatment of Jews. He forbade usurious landlord advances to tenants, and established government banks. He built roads and lighthouses. He resisted expansion of papal prerogatives. However, himself reportedly minimally educated, he took little interest in education and resisted the philhellene project of a university. Made a GCH in 1817, he established in 1818 the Order of St Michael and St George for services in Malta and Ionia. In April 1818 he was appointed its first grand master and GCMG, and he accepted the cross in diamonds. However, he wrote privately of the order with a Swiftian cynicism which later shocked his biographer, and used it to gain influence &#145;as a mere means of corruption&#146;  (Lord, 230). He built the neo-classical palace of St Michael and St George in Corfu town, as headquarters for the order and a residence for the high commissioner.<br>
<br>Despite reforms and prosperity, many Ionians were discontented, and Maitland had to counter the intrigues of local nobles and others, including the Russophile Corfiot Count Ioannis Kapodistrias (later first president of Greece, assassinated 1831). Maitland was required by earlier treaty to cede the formerly Venetian Greek town of Parga, on the Albanian coast, to the Ottoman empire. Privately he opposed cession, and he negotiated relatively favourable terms with the Turks. The cession in March 1819 caused much criticism of him in Britain and elsewhere. During the Greek war of independence he privately sympathized with the Porte as standing for established government, whereas he saw little prospect of the Greeks achieving a successful state. His policy of enforcing the British government's policy of Ionian neutrality and preventing Ionian support for the Greek war was most unpopular. Controversial, he had political enemies also in Britain. Joseph Hume (1777&#150;1855) repeatedly attacked him in the House of Commons. In 1821 he denounced him as a tyrant, and his rule as &#145;a disgrace to England &hellip; a system of misrule&#146;  (Lord, 263), and alleged jobbery and financial abuses. The government defended Maitland.<br>
<br>Maitland was capable and hard-working, but also arrogant, imperious, querulous, bad-tempered, and ill-mannered. Napier wrote of him, &#145;Narrow-minded, he saw many things under false lights, was constantly drunk, and surrounded by sycophants&#146;  (Napier, 285). His coarse behaviour and slovenly appearance offended officers and others. According to Napier he was &#145;insufferably rude&#146; and &#145;particularly dirty in his person&#146;  (Young, 157). Thomas Collings wrote of his &#145;contempt of all propriety in regard to dress &hellip; he looked nothing better than a well to do shopkeeper, and even then not of the superior class&#146;  (Hedderwick, 80). He once received the senate in his night attire and told them to &#145;go to hell!&#146;  (Bruce, 83). When visiting a papal official his clothes were shabby, his shirt and waistcoat stained with snuff, and his cap greasy. Though economical in public finance, in private he lived lavishly. W. F. Lord wrote that &#145;his diversion, his solace, was gross indulgence&#146;  (Lord, xiv). He enjoyed &#145;the pleasures of the table&#146;, reportedly &#145;indulging to excess&#146;  (Hedderwick, 80). He indulged in drinking bouts, &#145;being frequently invisible for several days altogether&#146;  (ibid.). Apparently his health was poor, presumably from his tropical service, exacerbated by his lifestyle. He frequently visited the baths at Lucca, Tuscany, for his health, and his enemies scoffed at his valetudinarianism. He never married.<br>
<br>A sick man, Maitland late in 1823 returned to Malta. On 17 January 1824 he visited the forces chaplain's house at Floriana, suffered an apoplectic stroke at half past one, and had died by half past ten that evening. He was buried on 21 January in the Upper Barracca, Valletta, and a simple monument marked his grave. Commemorative services were held in Ionian churches and at one the eulogy by Count Spiridian Bulgaris praised him as like &#145;a guardian angel&#146;, just, humane, and generous, causing &#145;the progressive improvement of all useful institutions&#146; and entitled to &#145;the lasting veneration of the Ionian people&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 371&#150;2). He was commemorated by a small Ionic rotunda at the Esplanade, Corfu town. The biography by Walter Frewen Lord, <span class="italic">Sir Thomas Maitland: the Mastery of the Mediterranean</span>, was published in 1897. Lord wrote that although some considered Maitland a &#145;gross bully&#146; and &#145;brutal tyrant&#146;, &#145;his labours were Herculean &hellip; his life was illuminated and dignified by his unbending devotion to duty&#146;  (Lord, 87, xiv&#150;xv).<br>
