<span class="headword">Willcocks, Sir  James</span>  (1857&#150;1926), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 1 April 1857 at Baraut in Meerut district, United Provinces, India, the fourth son of Captain William Willcocks (<i>c</i>.1817&#150;1878), of the East India Company's service, and his wife, Mary Martin. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40872/', "Sir William Willcocks")</script> was his elder brother. He was educated privately in England, chiefly at Easton in Somerset. He was twice unsuccessful for the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and was nearly twenty-one when he left it and was gazetted in January 1878 to the 100th foot, which he joined in the Punjab. Owing to a cholera epidemic his regiment was not in the Second Anglo-Afghan War, but when its second stage began after the murder of Sir Louis Cavagnari in September 1879, Willcocks determined to get to the front. He audaciously telegraphed headquarters at Simla, offering his services. Normally such action would have led to a reprimand. However, he received a telegram ordering him to the front.<br>
<br>Willcocks served as a transport officer and learned many lessons later useful to him. Early in 1881 he served as transport officer in the Mahsud Waziri expedition, rejoining the 100th foot at Ambala in the following year. In 1884 he was appointed to the new army transport department, and was soon put in charge of army transport in the eastern frontier districts with headquarters in Assam. Captain Willcocks was selected for transport duties with the small Indian contingent in the Sudan. He served briefly at the Suakin base of Major-General Graham's force, in 1885&#150;6. He returned to Assam, then was selected for transport duties in the Burmese frontier expedition of 1886. At its conclusion in December 1887 he was offered a permanent appointment in the amalgamated commissariat&#150;transport department, and at the same time received an offer from his regimental commanding officer of the adjutancy of the 1st battalion Prince of Wales's Leinster regiment (Royal Canadians).<br>
<br>Although it entailed pecuniary loss, Willcocks wisely rejoined his battalion. He arrived with five &#145;ribbons&#146;, including the DSO (awarded in 1887), then a remarkable number for a comparatively junior officer. He married in 1889 Winifred, second daughter of Colonel George Augustus Way, 7th Bengal infantry, and they had one son. She survived her husband. In 1889 he served as intelligence officer in the Chin-Lushai expedition, and in 1891 in the Manipur expedition.<br>
<br>For the next five years, leave, polo, big game shooting, and staff appointments in India occupied Willcocks until, in June 1897, he was appointed assistant adjutant-general of the field force being formed in the Tochi valley in Baluchistan. On the conclusion of that campaign in November he was offered by the War Office the post of second in command of the new force about to be raised by Major F. J. D. Lugard in west Africa. Willcocks accepted, and arrived at Sierra Leone in March 1898.<br>
<br>In 1898 Willcocks took part in the Borgu campaign, and in 1899 became colonel-commandant of the West African Frontier Force. His first real chance as a commander came when he commanded the Asante field force for the relief of Kumasi. Despite many difficulties Willcocks relieved it on 15 July 1900. He was created KCMG, and given the freedom of the City of London with a sword of honour.<br>
<br>In 1902 Willcocks joined the army in South Africa, but he had no opportunity to display his skill in organization. He returned to India, was promoted major-general in 1906, and commanded two expeditions on the north-west frontier in 1908. Such was his rapidity of action that <span class="italic">Punch</span> wrote of &#145;Willcocks's Week-End Wars&#146;. In 1908 he was promoted lieutenant-general, and in 1910 he was appointed to the command of the northern army in India. In 1913 he was appointed KCSI.<br>
<br>Willcocks reached the zenith of his career when, in 1914, he was ordered to France in command of the Indian army corps. Everything pointed to his ultimate appointment as commander-in-chief in India. But it did not happen. Although Willcocks was awarded the GCMG in 1915, friction developed between him and Sir Douglas Haig, formerly junior to him, who had been promoted general in November 1914 and became commander of the newly formed First Army at the beginning of 1915. Willcocks resigned in September 1915. He had been promoted full general in May. In April 1916 he was appointed colonel of the Loyal regiment (North Lancashire). He was appointed GCB in 1921.<br>
<br>Willcocks's military career was over, and he was governor of Bermuda from June 1916 to 1922. Willcocks was a readable author. Of his three books <span class="italic">From Kabul to Kumassi</span> (1904) was probably most popular. He died at Bharatpur, India, on 18 December 1926.<br>
