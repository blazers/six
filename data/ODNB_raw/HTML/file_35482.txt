<span class="headword">Perowne,  Edward Henry</span>  (1826&#150;1906), <span class="occ">college head</span>, third son of the Revd John Perowne and his wife, Eliza Scott, and younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35483/', "John James Stewart Perowne")</script>, was born at Burdwan, Bengal, where his parents were missionaries, on 8 January 1826. His family was of Huguenot descent. After private education, partly by his father, he was admitted pensioner of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, in 1846 and scholar in 1847; he was Porson prizeman in 1848, members' prizeman in 1849 and 1852, and senior classic in 1850. He graduated BA in 1850, proceeding MA in 1853, BD in 1860, and DD in 1873. He was admitted <i>ad eundem</i> (MA) at Oxford in 1857. Ordained deacon in 1850 and priest in 1851, he was curate of Maddermarket, Norfolk (1850&#150;51). He examined in the classical tripos several times between 1854 and 1863 and served as senior proctor in 1871&#150;2. W. H. Thompson, master of Trinity, is alleged to have remarked, &#145;I presume God created Perowne in order to keep Senior Classics humble.&#146; He was an unsuccessful candidate for the post of orator in 1857, when Joseph Romilly described him as &#145;a shy cold person&#146;.<br>
<br>Perowne was elected fellow and tutor of Corpus in 1858 and became master in 1879. He was Whitehall preacher (1864&#150;6); Hulsean lecturer in 1866; examining chaplain to the bishop of St Asaph (1874&#150;88); prebendary of St Asaph (1877&#150;90); vice-chancellor of Cambridge University (1879&#150;81); honorary chaplain to Queen Victoria (1898&#150;1900), and chaplain-in-ordinary (1900&#150;01); examining chaplain to his brother the bishop of Worcester (1891&#150;1901). Devoted to his college and university, a sound disciplinarian, a man of many friendships and wide interests, Perowne refused preferment to the deanery of Chester in 1886, despite a fondness for &#145;state and circumstance&#146;, and was long one of the most conspicuous figures in the academic and social life of Cambridge. He was a strong evangelical, and in politics a rigid Conservative. Under him the college became a nursery of bishops and missionaries; but its numbers diminished and it declined academically. Perowne resisted all change in the university, and as master and vice-chancellor vainly obstructed the royal commissioners in 1879&#150;81. When they were done he wrote, &#145;My heart is very very sad, well-nigh broken. I could wish myself far away from Cambridge and its imminent evils&#146;  (Browne, 225).<br>
<br>Although, according to tradition, Perowne proposed more than once to Mrs Colvin Hutchinson, his successor's sister who became his residuary legatee, he died unmarried at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, after a long illness, on 5 February 1906, and was buried at Grantchester on the 7th.<br>
<br>His principal works were: <span class="italic">The Christian's Daily Life, a Life of Faith</span> (1860); <span class="italic">Corporate Responsibility</span> (1862); <span class="italic">Counsel to Undergraduates on Entering the University</span> (1863); <span class="italic">The Godhead of Jesus</span> (1867); <span class="italic">Commentary on Galatians</span> in the <span class="roman">Cambridge Bible for Schools</span> series (1890); <span class="italic">Savonarola</span> (1900).<br>
