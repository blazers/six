<span class="headword">Clery, Sir  Cornelius Francis</span>  (1838&#150;1926), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at 2 Sidney Place, Cork, on 13 February 1838, the fourth son of James Clery, wine merchant, of Cork, and his wife, Catherine Walsh. After being educated at Dublin and at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, he was commissioned ensign in the 32nd foot in March 1858. He was promoted lieutenant in June 1859 and captain in January 1866. From 1868 to 1870 he studied at the Staff College. In 1871 he was appointed an instructor of tactics at Sandhurst, where he proved an immediate success, and in September 1872 was appointed professor of tactics. On completing his term of office in May 1875 he published <span class="italic">Minor Tactics</span>, the result of his Sandhurst teaching, which for thirty years was a leading and influential textbook.<br>
<br>Clery left Sandhurst in 1875 in order to join the administrative staff at army headquarters in Ireland; from there he was transferred to Aldershot in April 1877. A year later he was sent to the Cape on special service as a major on half pay. On the outbreak of the Anglo-Zulu War in January 1879 he was appointed operational staff officer to Colonel R. T. Glynn's column, and later adjutant-general to the flying column. He was present at the battle of Ulundi (4 July). After the war he returned home, and was promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel for his services. In August 1882 he went to Egypt as brigade major in Wolseley's army. After the battle of Tell al-Kebir (13 September), Clery remained in Egypt on the headquarters staff, and subsequently acted as chief of staff in the Suakin expedition under Major-General Sir Gerald Graham in 1884, taking part in the actions at al-Teb (29 February) and Tamai (13 March). In these he was conspicuous, as he refused to wear the new khaki uniform, choosing instead a smartly cut scarlet jacket. For his services he was promoted brevet colonel in May 1884 and was made CB.<br>
<br>Clery served as deputy adjutant and quartermaster-general in the Gordon relief expedition, and was appointed chief of staff of the army of occupation in Egypt in March 1886. Having shown he was a fighting soldier, and no mere theorist, Clery was appointed commandant of the Staff College in August 1888. After five years there he reverted to half pay until promoted major-general in December 1894. In 1896 he was appointed deputy adjutant-general at the War Office.<br>
<br>Clery remained there until, on the outbreak of the South African War in October 1899, he was appointed to command the 2nd division in Natal. This he led throughout the campaign to relieve Ladysmith (28 February 1900) and the subsequent invasion of the eastern Transvaal. In October 1900 the Natal army was broken up to garrison the territory it had captured. Without a command Clery, like many others, returned to England. The reason for his recall was the subject of many rumours: indecisiveness in command, ill health, or personal considerations in high places that had no connection with his professional ability. He was created KCB in 1899 and KCMG in 1900, and retired in February 1901. A dandy of the old school, who dyed his whiskers and dressed impeccably even on campaign, Clery was a brave soldier. He died, unmarried, at his home, 4 Whitehall Court, Westminster, London, on 25 June 1926.<br>
