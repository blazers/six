<span class="headword">Christison,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1599), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, was born in Fife. Having become a friar, possibly at Aberdeen, he went to Scandinavia, where he may have studied theology at the universities of Copenhagen and Rostock; he certainly lived for a time in Bergen, where his patron was the protestant reformer Geble Pederss&oslash;n, bishop of Bergen from 1536 to 1557. He also learnt Danish, and in 1560 translated a letter from a cleric at Lund to the St Andrews kirk session regarding spousal desertion. By March 1558 he had returned to Scotland to preach reformed doctrines. After Paul Methven left St Mary's, Dundee, for Jedburgh, the protestant lords of the congregation appointed Christison minister of St Mary's, on 19 July 1560. When the first general assembly met in December 1560, Christison represented Dundee, along with two laymen, and he took an active part in its subsequent meetings, attending at least thirty-eight of the next sixty. In June 1564 he was one of the delegates appointed by the assembly to confer with a group of nobles and courtiers concerning John Knox's hostility to Queen Mary and the right of subjects to resist idolatrous rulers. Six times between December 1565 and October 1577 he served on committees to resolve questions and complaints posed to general assemblies.<br>
<br>After the rebellion against Queen Mary of August&#150;September 1565, known as the chaseabout raid, Christison tried to assist its protestant leaders, forwarding their letter to his fellow ministers in September 1565 with a recommendation that they support the rebel lords. When the queen discovered this Christison and others in Dundee were put on trial, but most of the offenders escaped with fines. A year later, on 4 September 1566, Christison was one of seven ministers from Angus (Forfarshire) who subscribed the second Helvetic confession, though the Scots refused to celebrate the holy days associated with Christ's life, owing to the absence of biblical precepts. In July 1569 Christison was elected moderator of the general assembly, and was also appointed to the delegation that presented the regent Moray with a statement concerning clerical stipends, relief of the poor, and opposition to pluralism in the church. Four months later he was presented to the vicarage of St Mary's, which had been vacated by the forfeiture for treason of John Hamilton of Samuelston, a supporter of Queen Mary. While he was minister in Dundee, Christison seems to have worked closely with the burgess Roger Melville, James Melville's uncle, for when Roger died, Christison told his nephew that Roger had been &#145;the carefulest father that ever Dondie haid&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Diary</span>, 38).<br>
<br>During the 1570s Christison continued to be a leader in the reformed kirk. In March 1570 the general assembly asked him, along with Knox, John Row, and John Craig, to determine its agenda (an assignment he also undertook in October 1577), and in March 1572 the assembly appointed him to a committee to consider the position of bishops. Its eventual report objected to the use of the terms archbishop, dean, archdeacon, chancellor, and chapter. In the meantime Christison had become involved in the detention of Maurice MacGibbon, archbishop of Cashel, who was arrested at Dundee in April 1572 <i>en route</i> for Flanders with letters to the pope and Philip II seeking their intervention to restore the three kingdoms to Roman Catholicism.<br>
<br>Christison's ministerial duties increased in 1574 as he assumed responsibility for the church at Ballumbie, which he seems to have retained until 1585. In April 1576 the general assembly asked him and four others to determine the best procedure for visitations in Angus and Mearns, and he was also named a visitor for the University of St Andrews. The same assembly appointed him to a commission to examine church polity, and the appointment was renewed in October. In response to an inquiry from Queen Elizabeth the general assembly in October 1577 recommended Christison, Andrew Melville, and six others to the regent Morton as possible delegates to an assembly in Magdeburg to draft a confession of faith; Melville and George Hay were nominated but did not go. The following year Christison helped to draft the second <span class="roman">Book of Discipline</span>, and the general assembly appointed him a visitor for Angus and Mearns in 1578&#150;80 and for Mar in 1578. Six times between July 1579 and April 1593 he served on committees advising moderators of the general assembly, and in October 1580 he was appointed by the assembly to see that Andrew Melville was installed as principal of St Mary's College, St Andrews. The following year the assembly made Christison a commissioner for the establishment of elderships (presbyteries) in Angus, and appointed him to committees to review procedures for the trial and ordination of ministers and to select a pastor for St Andrews. Later assemblies appointed him a commissioner to visit the universities in October 1582, and specifically St Andrews in October 1583. In May 1586 he was again designated a commissioner for the erection of presbyteries in Angus. With others he was authorized in May 1586 to oversee the commissioners for Angus and Mearns, and in June 1587 to review their records.<br>
<br>In February 1590 Christison became a commissioner to take subscriptions from Jesuits, seminary priests, and excommunicated persons in Angus. The same year his church at Dundee obtained another minister to assist him, probably because advancing age was rendering him unable to fulfil all his responsibilities. Nevertheless, in the autumn of 1592 he took his place in a ministerial network established to monitor Roman Catholic activities; the ministers of Mearns, Brechin, Arbroath, and Meigle reported to him, and he in turn reported to Adam Mitchell at Coupar. By March 1598, however, Christison was too frail to continue his work as a commissioner, and the general assembly thereupon named Robert Howie, principal of New College, Aberdeen, to succeed him as minister of Dundee. Christison died on 16 October 1599 and was survived by his wife, Anna, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wynton.<br>
