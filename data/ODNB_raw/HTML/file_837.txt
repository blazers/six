<span class="headword">Atherton, Sir  William</span>  (1806&#150;1864), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was born at Glasgow in October 1806, the son of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/836/', "Revd William Atherton (1775&#150;1850)")</script>, a Wesleyan minister, and Margaret, daughter of Walter Morison, a minister of the established Church of Scotland. He was educated in England, and was admitted to the Inner Temple on 11 November 1829. He practised from 1832 to 1839 as a special pleader below the bar. In 1833 he published <span class="italic">An elementary and practical treatise on the commencement of personal actions, and the proceedings therein to declaration, in the superior courts at Westminster</span>, which was commended at the time as &#145;very useful&#146; and &#145;well executed&#146;  (Allibone, <span class="italic">Dict.</span>), and on 22 November 1839 he was called to the bar. He practised on the northern circuit, where he secured a high reputation. On 15 April 1843 he married Agnes Mary (<i>d</i>. 1866), the daughter of Mr Thomas James Hall, chief magistrate at Bow Street.<br>
<br>Atherton was returned to parliament as one of the members for the city of Durham in 1852, and was re-elected by the same constituency in 1857 and 1859. In politics he was an advanced Liberal, being in favour of vote by ballot and an extension of the suffrage, and he opposed the repeal of the grant to the Catholic college of Maynooth, and supported the removal of all religious disabilities. Unsurprisingly, most of his reported speeches were on legal matters.<br>
<br>Atherton was appointed a queen's counsel in July 1851, and became a bencher of his inn the same year. He was judge-advocate of the fleet and standing counsel to the Admiralty from 1855 until 16 December 1859, when he succeeded Sir H. S. Keatinge as solicitor-general, and received the honour of knighthood (23 February 1860). In June 1861, on the elevation of Sir Richard Bethell to the lord chancellorship as Lord Westbury, Sir William Atherton succeeded to the vacant post of attorney-general. He was the first Methodist to hold the position, which he resigned in September 1863 on account of ill health; he was reported to have rallied in late November, but died at his residence, 13 Westbourne Terrace, Hyde Park, London, on 22 January 1864. He was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
