<span class="headword">Stayley,  George</span>  (<em>b. </em>1727, <em>d.</em> before 1780), <span class="occ">actor and playwright</span>, was born at Burton upon Trent on 1 March 1727, the son of William Stayley and his wife, Elizabeth Monk. He was baptized at St Modwen's Church, Burton, on 10 March 1727. According to his <span class="italic">Life and Opinions of an Actor</span>, in 1745 he was adopted by his mother's brother, an attorney, who wished him to study law; however, after five years his kinsman, perceiving that he had no aptitude in that direction, left him to his own devices.<br>
<br>After two years of idleness Stayley landed in Ireland on 29 May 1752, and became an actor at the Smock Alley Theatre in Dublin. There he wrote several short pieces as well as full-length comedies, which included <span class="italic">The Court of Nassau</span> (1753) and <span class="italic">The Rival Theatres</span> (1759), which mocked the rivalry between Sheridan at Smock Alley and Barry and Woodward at Crow Street. Although a good actor, he was inordinately vain and had an unfortunate knack of irritating people. In 1760 Henry Mossop, the new lessee at Smock Alley, discharged him for giving political toasts while playing Lovel in James Townley's farce <span class="italic">High Life</span>. Shunned by the Dublin managers, Stayley sought to vindicate himself with <span class="italic">The Life and Opinions of an Actor</span> (1762), part autobiography, part anthology of interludes, interspersed with tall stories and comic patter, all wrapped up as a parody of Sterne's <span class="italic">Tristram Shandy</span>.<br>
<br>Unable to re-establish himself in Ireland, Stayley moved to Scotland. At the beginning of 1766 he proceeded to Edinburgh, where he joined the Canongate Theatre. He staged a successful production of Allan Ramsay's <span class="italic">The Gentle Shepherd</span> there, but the manager, David Beatt, refused to re-engage him the next year despite his popularity. The so-called Stayley riot ensued on 24 January 1767, and the theatre was wrecked. Although disliked by managers, Stayley continued to write and perform where he could, and he also taught elocution. He died in obscurity before 1780.<br>
