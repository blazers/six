<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Schr&ouml;der,  (Rudolph) Bruno</span>, Baron Schr&ouml;der in the Prussian nobility <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Baron Bruno]</span>  (1867&#150;1940), <span class="occ">merchant banker</span>, was born on 14 March 1867 in Hamburg, Germany, the eighth of the nine children of Johann Rudolph Schr&ouml;der (1821&#150;1887), merchant and merchant banker, and his wife, Clara Louise, a daughter of John Henry Schr&ouml;der (1784&#150;1883), who in 1818 founded the London merchant bank J. Henry Schroder &amp; Co. Bruno was educated in Hamburg and performed his military service in the second Mecklenburg dragoons, achieving the rank of captain.<h2>
<a name="Apprenticeship"></a>Apprenticeship</h2>In 1888, aged twenty-one, Schr&ouml;der began his training with the family firm, Schr&ouml;der Gebr&uuml;der. Established in 1846 by his father and uncle, it was a Hamburg merchant and merchant-banking firm, specializing in trade in sugar, coffee, and saltpetre. For three years he worked as an unpaid &#145;volunteer&#146; at J. Henry Schroder &amp; Co., London, by then one of the City's leading merchant banks and the most important of the international nexus of Schr&ouml;der family firms. In 1891&#150;2 he toured the USA and Central America, familiarizing himself with clients and conditions. After his return to Hamburg in July 1892 he joined Schr&ouml;der Gebr&uuml;der, but a few months later &#145;the exceptional chance of a lifetime&#146;, as a nephew put it, came his way  (<span class="italic">DBB</span>, 71). His childless uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48948/', "Baron Sir John Henry William Schr&#246;der (1825&#150;1910)")</script>, the senior partner of J. Henry Schroder &amp; Co., invited him to join the London firm with a view to succeeding him as senior partner.<br>
<br>Schr&ouml;der's move revitalized the bonds between the Schroder firms and families in Hamburg and London. For half a century thereafter, years when the ties to Germany of other Anglo-German houses loosened and the younger generation was distracted from business by politics and society, Schroders continued to be strongly committed to German clients. When the senior partner was not at his desk, inspired by his uncle's example he devoted himself to family and private pastimes, orchid cultivation, and art collection, notably German Renaissance silver. He regarded himself as a trustee charged on behalf of his ancestors and family with a duty to continue the firm and its traditions and to enhance its standing. He was a devout Lutheran and a staunch supporter of London's Lutheran churches and their charitable works, especially the German Hospital at Dalston. For these works and for his charitable activities in his native Hamburg, he was made a Prussian baron (<i>Freiherr</i>) in July 1904, and henceforth was known as Baron Bruno.<br>
<br>Bruno Schr&ouml;der started at J. Henry Schroder &amp; Co. on 1 January 1893. Two years later, aged twenty-seven, he joined his uncle and Henry Tiarks in the partnership. Both these partners were in their sixties and executive management of the firm was soon assumed by Bruno Schr&ouml;der. He was joined in the partnership in 1902 by Frank Tiarks (1874&#150;1952), the son of Henry Tiarks, thereby continuing the business association of their families for a second generation. Bruno Schr&ouml;der and Frank Tiarks, though in many ways temperamentally opposites, made a formidable team. So thoroughly had the younger generation taken control of the firm that the retirement of Henry Tiarks in 1905 and Baron Sir John Henry William Schr&ouml;der in 1909 made almost no difference to the day-to-day conduct of business.<h2>
<a name="Merchantbankerparexcellence"></a>Merchant banker par excellence</h2>The 1890s and 1900s were prosperous times for City firms, especially Schroders. The volume of the firm's core international trade finance business more than doubled in these decades, and balance sheet acceptances outstanding at year end rose from &pound;5 million in 1893 to &pound;11 million in 1913, the second largest level of activity in the City. Underlying the expansion was the rapid growth of German international trade, though Schroders' success in winning business owed much to Bruno Schr&ouml;der's outstanding capabilities as a commercial banker. His strengths were his ability to make sound judgements regarding people and propositions, and his mastery of the technicalities of the bill of exchange. Above all he had an expert knowledge of the trades that Schroders financed, and he kept a careful eye on the business of clients. The tale is told of his meeting with Caesar Czarnikow, the sugar magnate, when he insisted that Czarnikow should accept a larger credit line than he had asked for and was proved justified by developments in the sugar market. Such was his standing as a money market expert that in the 1920s he was consulted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Banque de France for advice on the development of discount markets in New York and Paris.<br>
<br>Schr&ouml;der's personality inspired faith in his judgement and dependability. He was quiet and sober in manner, but possessed of such dignity and authority that his very presence commanded respect. His integrity was beyond question and he was tempted neither by an apparently easy profit nor to compromise on a strict standard of straightforwardness. He was outraged, for instance, when in the 1920s it was suggested that the firm might very profitably join an issuing syndicate for a new bond issue for the Romanian government before compensation had been arranged for the holders of pre-war bonds, and he flatly refused to add a first-class name to the prospectus of a second-class borrower. His practice in business was to listen carefully and courteously to the requests of clients and to make an immediate decision upon which a client could rely with absolute confidence. &#145;I do not think it can have occurred to anyone&#146;, wrote Henry Andrews, a manager at Schroders between the wars:<blockquote>that Baron Schr&ouml;der could let him down &hellip; he was a great gentleman and without doubt one of the very small company on whom depended the good name of London in the world of finance and the leadership of London in that world. (<span class="italic">DBB</span>, 73)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Boomyears19051914"></a>Boom years, 1905&#150;1914</h2>Schroders was already well-established as an issuing house specializing in finance for overseas railway construction and for Latin American governments. Under Baron Bruno's leadership, the firm participated energetically and profitably in London's issuing boom of the years 1905&#150;14. Schr&ouml;der became closely involved in some of the enterprises, notably in devising the San Paulo coffee valorization scheme of 1908, and he became chairman of the committee responsible for the sale of the collateral coffee. The sovereign bond issues that the firm made for Bulgaria and Romania just before the First World War marked the extension of Schroders' issuing business into central Europe, a development resulting from Baron Bruno's contacts with continental cousins and friends which was to be taken much further after 1919.<br>
<br>Baron Bruno's ties to Germany remained strong despite his move to England. On 5 April 1894 he had married Emma, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Deichmann, the daughter of a Cologne banker; they had two sons and two daughters. His principal interest apart from business was the extensive and largely German Schr&ouml;der family. Both at his Hamburg home, which he visited each July, and at Dell Park, Englefield Green (near Windsor), the estate he purchased in 1900, the visitors were predominantly relatives. In the inter-war period, especially during the inflation of 1923 and the depression of the 1930s, he gave financial assistance to family members, and in October 1931 he created the Rudolph&#150;Clara Schr&ouml;der Stiftung, a charitable foundation designed to help impoverished descendants of his parents. He continued to support the charities established by his uncle to care for indigent Germans in London. His charitable work was publicly acknowledged not only when he was made a baron in 1904, but again in 1937 when on his seventieth birthday he was awarded an honorary DMed by the University of Hamburg.<br>
<br>As the antagonism between Britain and Germany intensified during the decade prior to 1914, Baron Bruno remained resolutely Anglo-German and actively fostered understanding between the two nations; in 1905 he joined with other Anglo-German financiers including Sir Ernest Cassel, Alfred Beit, and Edgar Speyer to found the Anglo-German Union Club; in 1907 he entertained a group of visiting British journalists at his mother's home in Hamburg; in 1910 he endowed a chair in German at Cambridge University.<h2>
<a name="Naturalization"></a>Naturalization</h2>The outbreak of war between Britain and Germany in August 1914 posed not only commercial problems for Schroders but an immediate threat to the firm's continued existence. Schr&ouml;der himself was a German citizen, raising the danger that the firm would be seized as enemy property. He was promptly naturalized by the home secretary, Reginald McKenna, who had received urgent representations to do so from the governor of the Bank of England. McKenna explained to the House of Commons that prompt action was essential because:<blockquote>It is a very large, I believe the largest, accepting house in the City of London, and the very highest commercial authority in the City represented to me that it would be a disaster&#151;no less a word was used&#151;if the doors of Baron Schr&ouml;der did not open on the following morning, and, unless he had been naturalised at once, they would not have opened. (<span class="italic">DBB</span>, 74)</blockquote>Anti-German sentiment ran high in England during the war and Schr&ouml;der and his family suffered much abuse and even threats. The court of aldermen of the City of London protested against his naturalization as did a number of MPs, some of whom called for his internment. Schr&ouml;der's position as a trustee for various German charities, particularly the Kaiser Jubilee Fund, established in 1913, and his contributions to the funds of the emergency committee formed to relieve the plight of German nationals interned in England were cited as evidence of his disloyalty. Another purported justification for suspicion was that his eldest son, who was on holiday in Germany when war broke out, was called up into the German army. The news of his disappearance on the Russian front in 1915 was a cruel blow. When challenged to reveal his loyalties in the conflict he replied, &#145;I feel as if my father and my mother have had a quarrel&#146;  (<span class="italic">DBB</span>, 74).<br>
<br>If the German connections of firm and family led to difficulty and tragedy during the hostilities, in the post-war period they once again created opportunities. The seizure of the City subsidiaries of German banks by the British authorities during the war created problems for the clearance of their transactions in London after 1919, particularly during the period of the German hyperinflation. Much of this business came to Schroders, briefly swelling the firm's staff from some 200 to more than 600 in 1924.<h2>
<a name="Recoveryanddepression"></a>Recovery and depression</h2>Baron Bruno's close connections with central European banks led Schroders to participate in the placement of their shares during the 1920s, and to his appointment to the board of the &Ouml;sterreichische Boden Creditanstalt. His links with the Deutsche Bank led to the controversial episode in 1923 when a British syndicate led by Schroders took control of the Baghdad Railway through the acquisition of the Deutsche Bank's interest. The following year, Baron Bruno played a crucial part in the re-establishment of the creditworthiness of the Deutsche Bank after the devastation of its balance sheet during the period of inflation.<br>
<br>Schroders worked closely with other leading City firms both before and after the war. The celebrated Barings&#150;Rothschild&#150;Schroders syndicate started in 1921, though issues continued with other merchant banks. Baron Bruno, like his uncle, preferred to keep distractions from Schroder business to a minimum. Outside directorships were taken only in firms with which Schroders had close commercial connections, such as the North British Mercantile Insurance Company or the New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency. Unlike his partner, Frank Tiarks, Schr&ouml;der did not play a prominent part in the institutions of the City or in public life.<br>
<br>The early 1920s saw the emergence of New York as an important centre for international trade finance and the international capital market. In October 1923 Schr&ouml;der and Tiarks established a New York bank with a capital of $3 million, the J. Henry Schroder Banking Corporation, the only London merchant bank to take such an initiative. Baron Bruno became chairman of the board, and he visited the concern annually in the 1920s. The Schroder banks specialized in fund-raising for clients in Germany and in the other countries of central Europe. Schr&ouml;der's name became particularly closely associated with the rationalization of the German potash industry and Schroders made several large issues for the German potash syndicate in the years between the wars.<br>
<br>As German trade revived after 1924 German merchants turned once again to London for trade finance. The volume of Schroders' German acceptances grew rapidly and by the end of the 1920s it had the biggest international trade finance business in the City. Working capital for German industry was also in short supply as a result of the depredations of the hyper-inflation of 1923. In 1924 Baron Bruno organized the formation of the Continental and Industrial Trust to meet the demand for equity and loan capital to medium-sized industrial firms in Germany.<br>
<br>While the international economy remained buoyant Schroders prospered. However, the virtual collapse of the central European banking system in the summer of 1931 and the ensuing suspension of the settlement of international obligations posed a grave threat, since the amount owing was several times the firm's capital. The &#145;standstill agreements&#146; of the 1930s, in which the leading negotiator on the part of the creditors was Frank Tiarks, averted the immediate danger of failure, but it was not until the early 1950s that the funds were recovered, severely curtailing the business of the firm in the 1930s and 1940s.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>Although remaining senior partner until his death, Baron Bruno played a less active part in the firm in the 1930s. While consulted on major matters, he left the day-to-day running of the business to his partners, who since 1926 had included his son, Helmut (1901&#150;1969), and Frank Tiarks's son, Henry (1900&#150;1995). Baron Bruno died on 10 December 1940 at his home, Dell Park, Englefield Green, Surrey, being laid to rest at St Jude's, Englefield Green. He was succeeded in the firm as senior partner by his son Helmut.<br>
