<span class="headword">Temple, Sir  John</span>  (1632&#150;1705), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was born on 25 March 1632, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27114/', "Sir John Temple (1600&#150;1677)")</script> of Dublin and Ballycrath, co. Carlow, master of the rolls in Ireland, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1638), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12160/', "Dr John Hammond")</script>. He was probably educated at Bishop's Stortford grammar school and then entered Pembroke College, Cambridge, on 30 January 1647, and Gray's Inn on 4 May 1650. He returned to Ireland in 1653 and from 1654 he practised in the Irish court of chancery. In 1657 he spent over three months in England, during which time he was called to the bar, on 17 November 1657. Following the Restoration, on 10 July 1660, he was appointed solicitor-general for Ireland. In the elections to the Irish parliament in 1661 Temple was returned for the borough of Carlow, and on 6 September 1661 he was chosen temporary speaker of the Irish House of Commons in the absence of Sir Audley Mervin.<br>
<br>Temple married, on 4 August 1663, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1708), daughter of Sir Abraham Yarner of Dublin, the muster-master general. They had four sons and seven daughters. He was knighted on 15 August 1663 and in January 1664 Lord Lieutenant Ormond wrote that he was a young man of &#145;extraordinary parts&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1663&#150;5</i>, 349). His legal career was now well established, and after 1664 his combined earnings from chancery and the solicitor-general's office did not fall below &pound;1000 p.a. until 1687. In 1666&#150;9 his income benefited from work generated by the Irish land settlement. Temple was now settled in Ireland as the confidante of Irish politicians like Ormond. He rented a house near the King's Inns and built a house at Palmerston, near to the lord lieutenant's residence. Temple was rarely away from Ireland, visiting England in winter 1670&#150;71 and summer 1675. In 1678 Ormond wrote that Sir John &#145;gives us very usefully very much of his pains, and I think must afford us more in the quality of Speaker&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ormonde MSS</span>, new ser., 4.167), should the Irish parliament be summoned, but that he was reluctant to take on the office. Lord Orrery described him in July 1679 as &#145;one of the ablest and honestest lawyers in his majesties dominions&#146;  (MacLysaght, 218). Temple was again in England in August&#150;October 1679 when there were rumours that he would be appointed attorney-general in England &#145;at the mediation of my Lord of Essex&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ormonde MSS</span>, new ser., 5.225). This appointment fell through, according to one account, because Charles II &#145;would never trust any of the blood of a rebel&#146;  (Thompson, 198&#150;9), a reference to his father.<br>
<br>In 1680 Lord Chamberlain Arlington reportedly feared that Temple's links with whig politicians such as the earl of Essex, and his failure to obtain the attorney's post would make him obstructive. Judging from his correspondence with Ormond this does not seem to have been the case. Temple was reappointed solicitor-general following the accession of James II, but the gradual introduction of more Roman Catholics into legal office saw him isolated. The appointment of a more vigorous attorney-general, Sir Richard Nagle, also cut into his employment. With an annual rent roll of &pound;1960 Temple was now in a position to enjoy the fruits of astutely invested profits from his legal career. In late July 1687 he left for England and did not return until May 1688. The revolution saw him back in England as a key adviser on Irish policy to William III. Temple was attainted by the Irish parliament of James II, but on 30 October 1690 he was named attorney-general in Ireland. He did not resume his Irish practice, but he was resident in Ireland in 1691&#150;2. Ill health and business apparently made him return to England in autumn 1692, although others thought this a ruse to avoid involvement in the new Irish parliament. Temple continued in office until he was removed in summer 1695.<br>
<br>Despite rumours to the contrary, Temple did not become master of the rolls in Ireland, an office which his brother, Sir William, held under a life patent. Sir William instead surrendered the office in 1696 and it was granted to William Berkeley, the future fourth Lord Berkeley of Stratton, who that same year married Sir John's youngest daughter. One of her elder sisters married the third Baron Berkeley of Stratton and then the first earl of Portland, while another married Sir Basil Dixwell, second baronet. In retirement Temple lived at East Sheen, Surrey, where he died on 10 March 1705. He was buried at Mortlake, Surrey, on 16 March. He was survived by his wife, who died on 25 June 1708, two sons, and four daughters. Most of his estates in England and Ireland were settled on his two sons, the elder of whom, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27110/', "Henry Temple")</script>, was created Viscount Palmerston on 12 March 1723.<br>
