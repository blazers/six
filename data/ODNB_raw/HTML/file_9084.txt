<span class="headword">Fairfax,  Henry</span>  (1588&#150;1665), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 14 January 1588 at Denton Hall, in the parish of Otley in the West Riding of Yorkshire; he was the fourth but second surviving son of Thomas Fairfax (1560&#150;1640), later first Baron Fairfax of Cameron, and his wife, Ellen (<i>d</i>. 1620), daughter of Robert Aske, esquire, of Aughton and his wife, Elizabeth. Henry's warlike father had been a soldier in the Low Countries and in France, and purchased the peerage for &pound;1500 in 1627. From 1602 Henry was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge. Tutored by a Dr Duckett, he was awarded the degrees of BA and MA and was a fellow of the college from 1608 to 1616. He was a close friend of George Herbert, orator of the university until his death in 1634. Ordained a deacon in 1614 and a priest in 1616, Fairfax served briefly as rector of Newton Kyme in Yorkshire, a living in his father's gift, before Sir George Booth procured his appointment as rector of Ashton under Lyne, Lancashire, in 1619.<br>
<br>On 4 February 1627, at St Helen's in York, Fairfax married Mary (<i>c</i>.1593&#150;1650), daughter of Sir Henry Cholmley of Whitby and his wife, Margaret, daughter of Sir William Babthorpe. Noted for her zeal, Mary committed to writing her pious meditations on <span class="roman">Matthew</span> 6. The couple returned to Yorkshire in 1633, when Fairfax was reinstated as rector of Newton Kyme. He was active in attempts to establish a university in the north, either at York or at Manchester. On 20 March 1641 he wrote to his brother Ferdinando, second Baron Fairfax, requesting his aid in the design, enclosing in his letter a petition advocating the choice of Manchester. His son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9075/', "Brian Fairfax")</script> recalled that during the civil wars Fairfax was brought before Prince Rupert at York in 1644 and asked if he had taken the covenant; having replied that he had not he was released and sent home with a note of protection. Brian remarked that his parents' house at Newton Kyme was &#145;a refuge and sanctuary to their friends and relations on both sides&#146;. He further recalled of his father:<blockquote>I have heard say that King James bid my Grandfather make him a Scollar, and he would make him a Bishop: but the storme that fell upon Church and State made him incapable of that dignety, liveing quietly like Lot in Zoar, from whence he saw Sodome all in flames. (Markham, <span class="italic">Life of Robert Fairfax</span>, 134&#150;5)</blockquote>Fairfax had inherited estates in nearby Oglethorpe, and in 1646 he was made rector of the larger and more prosperous living at Bolton Percy. He was also a canon of York and prebendary of Fridaythorpe from 1615 to 1665.<br>
<br>Mary Fairfax died of pleurisy on 24 December 1649 and was buried the following day in Bolton Percy church. Fairfax mourned for her so passionately, it was said, that he lost the sight in one of his eyes. His son recalled his religious zeal and how he &#145;was ever lifting up his eyes and hands to Heaven&#146;  (Markham, <span class="italic">Life of Robert Fairfax</span>, 135&#150;6). Among his parishioners during the 1650s was his nephew the retired general Thomas, third Baron Fairfax. At the Restoration Fairfax resigned as rector in favour of Mr Wickham, and in 1662 he retired to his estate at Oglethorpe. His recreations included the study of antiquities and heraldry, while he spent much time meditating, reading the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, and taking notes. His brother, the antiquarian Charles Fairfax, frequently quoted from these notes in compiling his &#145;Analecta Fairfaxiana&#146;, where some of Henry's anagrams and epigrams may be found.<br>
<br>Having enjoyed good health throughout his life Fairfax died &#145;of a kind of lethargy&#146; at Oglethorpe on 6 April 1665  (Markham, <span class="italic">Life of Robert Fairfax</span>, 138). He was buried two days later, beside his wife, under a flagstone within the altar rails of Bolton Percy church, where a monumental inscription remains. His eldest surviving son, Henry, succeeded as fourth Baron Fairfax in 1671.<br>
