<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Baxter,  William Alexander</span>  (1877&#150;1973), <span class="occ">food manufacturer</span>, was born on 25 September 1877 at George Lane, Fochabers, Moray, the eldest son of George Baxter (<i>d</i>. 1925), master grocer, and his wife, Margaret Duncan. He made his reputation by supplying relatively simple foods of high quality to a wide clientele, including the royal household.<br>
<br>Baxter's formal education at Alexander Milne's Free School, Fochabers, ended at the age of thirteen, when he joined his father in the family's Spey Street grocery business in Fochabers. His training in business had begun much earlier, however: when he was six his father wrapped him in the shop foreman's apron and set him to work weighing tea and sugar. Later, when he graduated to collecting orders after school on Friday afternoons, George Baxter greeted his son's return with the same question, &#145;Well, did ye get any <i>new</i> customers today?&#146;. This paternal dictum guided his business life.<br>
<br>The Spey Street shop was already established as a supplier of groceries to local great houses, in large part because Baxter's father had been a gardener to the duke of Richmond and Gordon at nearby Gordon Castle before setting up shop in 1868. The duke encouraged the venture by lending his custom, and the local gentry soon followed. George Baxter supplied Gordon Castle with continental wines, cheeses, and other delicacies. He visited Speyside distilleries to select fine malt whiskies for the ducal table, and also blended them under the trade name of Baxter's Pure Malt Scotch Whisky. Baxter's mother, Margaret, also employed a small staff to produce preserves made from local soft fruits taken as part payment for groceries from village women. These preserves sold well, and were appreciated by Gordon Castle visitors, who sent orders from London. The duke provided the Baxters with a recipe for marmalade used at the castle since 1837, which they marketed as Castle Marmalade.<br>
<br>Baxter, who was often known as WAB, was the family's travelling salesman, whose sales technique was enhanced by a genial disposition and a flair for marketing. With his sample-laden bicycle he would board the train for Wick, and cycle back to Fochabers, taking orders on the way. There were also, later, buying trips to London and Europe. When Baxter fell ill in 1914, he was nursed back to health at the family home, Highfield House, by a <span class="occ">nursing sister</span>, Ethelreda (Ethel) Adam [<a name="cosubject_54540"></a><span class="headword">Ethelreda Baxter</span>  (1883&#150;1963)], the daughter of Andrew Adam, a farm manager. She and William Baxter were married at Aberdeen on 11 November 1914; they had two sons.<br>
<br>Ethel Baxter subsequently took charge of the firm's preserve making, but her strong, independent views resulted in the newly married couple's embarking on a bold venture as preserve manufacturers in their own right, leaving the grocery business to William's younger brother, George. Family tradition records that Baxter met the duke of Richmond and Gordon one Sunday morning after church, and together they paced out Baxters' original half-acre site by the River Spey.<br>
<br>William and Ethel Baxter were partners in every sense of the word. Ethel ran the factory, bought the fruit, hired local labour, supervised production, and experimented with new recipes. William's forte was in securing new customers&#151;for example, Harrods in 1919. Fortnum and Mason's formidable buyer, Mr Reilly, failed to understand Baxter's Scottish accent, but bought his products on taste alone. The comptroller of the royal household bought several cases of Ethel's Little Scarlet Strawberry Jam, thus beginning the firm's long association with the royal household.<br>
<br>In the 1920s and 1930s, the Baxters identified market opportunities for the abundant local produce surrounding them in the rich Laich of Moray. Their product range extended into meat processing. Moray chickens weighing precisely 2&frac14; lb were used for one of their new products&#151;jars of whole chicken in natural jelly. Royal Game Soup&#151;probably Baxters' best-known product&#151;came into being when Baxter recognized that venison, then unpopular, could be utilized in soup making. Ethel mixed venison with pheasant, game, and seasoning, and canned soup became part of their range. Many other entrepreneurial examples followed. Expansion provided greater factory employment opportunities in the Fochabers area. In 1916 Ethel Baxter and a small group of women began full-time jam manufacture. In the 1930s employment increased gradually. Restrictions during the Second World War reduced staff and production to the minimum, but by the 1950s a steady payroll of 120 was achieved, rising to 500 during the fresh fruit season. By 1960 staffing levels rose to 300 and 900 respectively.<br>
<br>In 1945 the Baxter family formed a private limited company, W. A. Baxter &amp; Sons Ltd, with &pound;4000 capital in &pound;1 shares. By 1956 share capital had increased to &pound;26,000. William and Ethel's two sons, Gordon and Ian, and their wives, joined the firm; the business expanded overseas, opening offices in Chicago and Brussels. Ethel Baxter died at Dr Gray's Hospital, Elgin, on 15 August 1963. Her public role was largely taken on by Gordon Baxter's wife, Ena Baxter, whose kitchen and gourmet canned soups, their tins girdled with Gordon tartan, became the premier product of the firm. Shortly before his own death in 1973, William Baxter proudly claimed in his memoirs &#145;there has been a Mrs Baxter right at the heart of our family business for the last 105 years&#146;  (Baxter, 2).<br>
<br>Baxter lived at Highfield House, Fochabers, from 1904 until shortly before his death. He died at Dr Gray's Hospital, Elgin, aged ninety-six, on 15 October 1973. As president of W. A. Baxter &amp; Sons Ltd, he saw Baxters' share capital expand from &pound;70,000 in 1967 to &pound;500,000 in 1970. During his lifetime all shares were held in family hands and at the time of his death he himself held only 1400 ordinary shares. He was buried beside his wife in Bellie kirkyard, Fochabers, after a funeral service in the Gordon Chapel of the Scottish Episcopal Church, Fochabers, where he had been a long-standing lay elector and benefactor.<br>
