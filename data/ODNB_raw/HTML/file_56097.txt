<span class="headword">Benson,  Mary Eleanor <span class="st"> [Nelly]</span></span>  (1863&#150;1890), <span class="occ">social worker and writer</span>, was born on 16 October 1863 at Wellington College, Crowthorne, Berkshire, the elder daughter of the four sons and two daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2139/', "Edward White Benson (1829&#150;1896)")</script>, later archbishop of Canterbury, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sidgwick (1841&#150;1918). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30712/', "Arthur Christopher Benson (1862&#150;1925)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30713/', "Edward Frederic Benson (1867&#150;1940)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30718/', "Robert Hugh Benson (1871&#150;1914)")</script> were her brothers, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56291/', "Margaret Benson")</script> her younger sister. She was educated at Truro Girls' High School and Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford (1881&#150;3), where she took the equivalent of a second in modern languages. In 1887 she published an article on the poet George Crabbe in <span class="italic">Temple Bar</span>.<br>
<br>On going down from Oxford Nelly Benson (as she was known) had planned to concentrate on literature and art but, feeling overpowered by a passionate desire to &#145;do something for the poor&#146;, she turned to social work. Anxious to help the poorest women and girls to help themselves, she felt especially addressed by the struggle of &#145;respectable&#146; girls to stay &#145;respectable&#146;. No friend to socialism, Nelly Benson did not consider structural alternatives to the British economic system that might diminish, or even abolish, extreme poverty, concentrating instead on personal intervention in particular cases. She was a voluntary, unpaid social worker rather than a pioneer of the emerging new profession. She did play a pioneering role, however, as honorary treasurer, in helping to establish the Women's University Settlement in Southwark, 1886&#150;7, out of which courses in social work were later to develop at the London School of Economics. Her own personal approach to social work may be seen in the posthumous <span class="italic">Streets and Lanes of the City</span> (1891), printed privately for her friends. The book gives a detailed account of Nelly Benson's emotionally draining commitment to help the daughter of an alcoholic mother, among other cases.<br>
<br>Nelly Benson's writings include a schoolchildren's <span class="italic">History of Russia</span> up to the abolition of serfdom (1885), a novel entitled <span class="italic">At Sundry Times and in Divers Manners</span> (1891) about the growth of a woman's commitment to Christianity, and a long, surprisingly conservative article in the <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span> (28, 1890, 616&#150;26), &#145;In Defence of Domestic Service&#146;, in which she disputed the servants' need for two hours' leisure a day: &#145;They do not need or desire exercise and &hellip; as for going to entertainments &hellip; it would be giving them leisure such as hardly any of their class enjoy, and leisure that they have not yet learnt to use&#146;. That article was, admittedly, defensive polemic in answer to Ellen Darwin's vigorous attack on the life endured by domestic servants published in the <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span> the previous August.<br>
<br>On 21 October 1890 Nelly Benson contracted diphtheria, almost certainly from an infection afflicting the local poor, and died on 27 October at her home, Addington Park, Croydon. She was buried at Addington church on 29 October. Her family, in her memory and according to her wish, made a bequest to supply the training, outfit, and convalescence or holiday of poor girls in Lambeth, the first preference being given to her own <span class="roman">Bible</span> class girls (a clear indication that she did recognize the girls' need for recuperation and holidays after all). The Women's University Settlement established a nurseship for the poor in Southwark as her memorial.<br>
<br>Nelly Benson had a complex, even enigmatic personality: lively, humorous, yet depressive; enormously active and physically vigorous yet often prostrated by chronic illness; intensely sympathetic to poor women yet also extraordinarily unimaginative at times as to how the light fell for them; in some ways a &#145;new woman&#146;, in others deeply conservative. She was the only child not to be afraid of her father&#151;or not to seem so&#151;but she was careful to project for him an acceptable image of a good daughter that in turn produced a memoir of her by him in the preface to <span class="italic">Streets and Lanes of the City</span> which her siblings found unrecognizable. Her brother A. C. Benson presented her very differently in his preface to <span class="italic">At Sundry Times</span>. Like her extraordinary mother, who was a Christian version of Virginia Woolf's Mrs Ramsay, Nelly Benson's most passionate relationships were with women, above all with the composer Ethel Smyth, whom her father could not tolerate. It is probable that her most real self is to be found in that correspondence.<br>
