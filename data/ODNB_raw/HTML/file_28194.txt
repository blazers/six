<span class="headword">Venning,  Ralph</span>  (<em>c.</em>1622&#150;1674), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was born in Devon, the son of Francis Venning and his wife, Joan. As a youth he became the first convert of George Hughes (1603/4&#150;1667), vicar of Tavistock, whom Venning later recalled as &#145;gentle to me as a nurse which cherisheth her children&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mysteries and Revelations</span>, preface). He was educated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he entered as a sizar on 1 April 1643 and graduated BA in 1646. Continuing at Emmanuel, the following year he issued the two first of many publications, <span class="italic">Orthodox Paradoxes</span>, and <span class="italic">Mysteries and Revelations</span>, an explanation of scriptural names, allusions, and metaphors, dedicated to Captain Francis West, lieutenant of the Tower of London, from whom Venning had received &#145;many favours&#146;. On 16 February 1648 he was appointed chaplain at the Tower, but returned to Cambridge to proceed MA in 1650. He subsequently held a lectureship at St Olave's, Southwark, where he earned fame as a preacher and continued to publish sermons and devotional works such as <span class="italic">The New Command Renewed</span> (1650) and <span class="italic">Canaans Flowings</span> (1653).<br>
<br>During the protectorate Venning was one of those employed to examine candidates for chaplaincies in the navy. From 1654 he preached sermons at St Paul's before successive mayors of London. He was made an assistant to the Surrey commission of triers and ejectors on 29 September 1657 and lecturer at St Mary Magdalen, Milk Street, on 26 November 1658. On 14 December 1659 Richard Baxter advised an anxious John Greenborough that Venning was one of those &#145;godly orthodox men&#146; who, despite their congregational principles and possible lack of ordination, &#145;you may thanke God you have such to heare&#146;  (Keeble and Nuttall, 1.421). In January 1661 he signed the congregational and Baptist <span class="italic">Renunciation and Declaration</span> against Thomas Venner. By a licence of 8 January 1661, which gave his parish as St Botolph without Bishopsgate, he married Hannah, widow of John Cope of London.<br>
<br>Venning was ejected under the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> in 1662; he was reported to be preaching unofficially in Southwark in 1663 and at the Wild Man, Cannon Street, the following year. At Southwark, Calamy recorded, Venning was &#145;a most importunate and prevalent pleader for the poor&#146; who succeeded in raising &#145;some hundreds of pounds for them&#146; each year  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Abridgement</span>, 2.22&#150;3). Sermons preached there many years earlier appeared in his <span class="italic">Sin, the Plague of Plagues</span> (1669). Under the declaration of indulgence Venning took out a licence in St Clement Eastcheap on 30 April 1672. Earlier he had become the co-pastor with Robert Bragge (1627&#150;1704) of the Independent congregation at Pewterers' Hall, Fenchurch Street, and this charge he held until his death.<br>
<br>It seems that Venning and his wife had remained childless but that he had continued to hope that she might conceive. In an astoundingly laconic will, dated 8 January 1674, &#145;being in good health&#146;, he disposed in one short paragraph of much money. There were legacies amounting to &pound;240 for various relations, &pound;50 &#145;to Christ's hospital for the blew coat children&#146;, &pound;30 for poor ministers, and &pound;10 for &#145;my honoured Mother Johan&#146; and for his stepdaughter Hannah Cope; most of the rest went to his wife, then aged about forty, with one proviso: &#145;if I leave a child I give it &pound;1000&#146;. Less than two months later, while preaching at Joyners' Hall on Sunday afternoon, 1 March 1674, he was taken ill. He died on 10 March, aged about fifty-two, and was buried in Bunhill Fields; the funeral sermon was preached by his colleague Robert Bragge. <span class="italic">The Dead yet Speaking</span> (1674), <span class="italic">Venning's Remains, or, Christ's School</span> (1675), and <span class="italic">Mr Vennings Alarm to Unconverted Sinners</span> (1675) were the first of many posthumous editions of his works; some were still being reprinted even in the late nineteenth century.<br>
