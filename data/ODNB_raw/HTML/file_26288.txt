</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stansfeld, Sir  James</span>  (1820&#150;1898), <span class="occ">politician and social reformer</span>, was born at Moorlands, Halifax, on 5 March 1820, the only son of James Stansfeld (1792&#150;1872) and his wife, Emma (<i>bap</i>. 1793, <i>d</i>. 1851), daughter of the Revd John Ralph, minister of Northgate End Unitarian Chapel, Halifax. The family had long been connected with radical protestant dissent and the legal profession. Stansfeld senior was a solicitor and for some decades a county court judge in the Halifax area. James went to a dame-school at Gateacre, near Liverpool, in 1827, and later attended Mr Voelke's school at Everton, among the sons of leading Unitarian manufacturers. In 1837 he went to University College, London, and was one of the early graduates of the University of London (BA, 1840); he added a degree in law in 1844.<br>
<br>While at University College and attending South Place Chapel, Finsbury, Stansfeld met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/785/', "William Ashurst")</script>, the radical solicitor, and became associated not only with his practice but also with his family and friends, most of whom were Unitarians. On 27 July 1844 he married Ashurst's second daughter, Caroline (1816&#150;1885) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56461/', "Stansfeld, Caroline")</script>]. He was called to the bar (Inner Temple) in 1849 but never practised. He needed a source of regular income, especially after the birth in 1852 of his only son (named Joseph James after the Italian patriot Mazzini), and in 1850 he joined with his brother-in-law Sidney Hawkes in operating the Swan Brewery, Fulham. He took over completely in 1853 and ran the brewery successfully for some years. This gave him the financial independence to adopt radical stances on social issues in later years. He was the exception among radicals in refusing to come out against the drink trade and was dismissed by some temperance activists as the &#145;Unitarian brewer&#146;.<br>
<br>During the 1840s and 1850s Stansfeld's passion was the cause of Italian freedom and unity. This commitment he shared with the Ashursts and their friends, known as &#145;the Muswell Hill brigade&#146;, and members of the South Place Chapel, led by the charismatic Revd W. J. Fox. Stansfeld met many leading figures, including Mazzini and Garibaldi, and by 1849 he had become, with P. A. Taylor, their leading supporter in the Society of the Friends of Italy. Other causes engaged his interest and support: the Anti-Corn Law League, Chartism, anti-slavery. He was a supporter of the Northern Reform Union, founded by Joseph Cowen in 1858 to agitate for manhood suffrage and the ballot. In April 1859 he was elected unopposed as one of the two MPs for Halifax. By then he was already known as &#145;the faithful friend of oppressed nationalities, and a reformer of whatever was unjust and oppressive in his own country&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Inquirer</span>, 136).<br>
<br>Stansfeld's ability was soon noticed. In June 1862 he moved a resolution, supported by other radicals, in favour of reductions in government spending, and in February 1863 he moved a motion in support of Polish independence. In April 1863 Palmerston appointed him a junior lord of the Admiralty, on the recommendation of Sir Charles Wood, as part of the policy of linking radicals with his ministry. Stansfeld's acceptance of office led to an estrangement from his old ally P. A. Taylor, who thought it would restrict his expression of principle. He appeared destined for early promotion, but his involvement in clandestine fund-raising for Italian agitators proved his undoing. The Greco affair in France, involving the Tibaldi conspirators, led Disraeli to charge him on 17 March 1864 in the House of Commons with being &#145;in conjunction with the assassins of Europe&#146;. Although defended by Palmerston, Bright, and Foster, he felt obliged to resign in April 1864.<br>
<br>Stansfeld returned to office in April 1866 as under-secretary for India in Lord John Russell's short-lived administration. He was disappointed not to be included in Gladstone's first cabinet in December 1868 but was made third lord of the Treasury and became financial secretary in February 1869, a most appropriate appointment as Stansfeld had a strong belief in economy in national expenditure; he was also sworn of the privy council. He joined the cabinet in March 1871 as president of the poor-law board. He framed the <span class="roman">Local Government Act</span> of 1871, which transferred the board's powers, and much else, to a new Local Government Board, of which he became the first president in August 1871. The period to February 1874 was Stansfeld's notable contribution to administration. His conscience refused to allow him to appoint political friends to office, and in 1873 he appointed the first woman (Jane Senior) as a poor-law inspector, a permanent civil service post, in the teeth of strong opposition. His main task in government was to resist Conservative demands for more payments from the Treasury to reduce the burdens on local ratepayers.<br>
<br>Stansfeld held his Halifax seat in February 1874, at the fall of Gladstone's administration. Thereafter he campaigned for the repeal of the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Acts</span>, passed in the 1860s, which subjected women in seaports and garrison towns suspected of being prostitutes to compulsory examination. He joined the ranks of the repealers, led by Josephine Butler, and was subjected to press attacks for doing so. He argued against the acts both on the grounds that they infringed the women's liberty and because they implied state regulation and recognition of prostitution. He spoke for the first time in the Commons on the subject in June 1875. His oratory was of the old-fashioned type reminiscent of his mentor, W. J. Fox: &#145;There was the fervid utterance, the slightly impassioned gesture, the tone of rather vague generality&#146;  (<span class="italic">Christian Life</span>, 115). In June 1879 he became a member of the parliamentary committee on the acts appointed by the Conservative government. When the committee reported in August 1882, a majority favoured retaining the acts. Stansfeld prepared a dissenting minority report, signed by five other members of the committee, putting the case for repeal. By then his personal prospects of political promotion had ended. Gladstone did not include him in his cabinet formed in 1880 and Stansfeld declined the twice-repeated offer of the deputy speakership.<br>
<br>In April 1883 Stansfeld carried a resolution condemning compulsory examination of women under the 1866 act. His tactics, criticized by some in the repeal movement, worked; the Liberal government, surprised by the large majority in favour of the resolution, hastily announced their intention to end compulsory examination. Stansfeld himself moved the inevitable repeal bill in March 1886; it received the royal assent in the following month.<br>
<br>On 3 April 1886 Stansfeld, a supporter of Gladstone's Irish home rule policy, returned briefly to the cabinet as president of the Local Government Board and held office until Gladstone's defeat in July 1886. He was not included in the Liberal administration of 1892, when he declined the offer of a peerage. On Lord Rosebery's recommendation he was appointed GCB in May 1895, shortly before his retirement from parliament, when he was made a freeman of Halifax, the town he had represented for so long.<br>
<br>Following Caroline Stansfeld's death in March 1885, Stansfeld married again on 22 June 1887; his new wife was Frances (1836/7&#150;1926), daughter of Andrew Allan and widow of Henry Augustus Severn. He spent his remaining years at his home in Sussex enjoying the attractions of landscape gardening. Stansfeld died on 17 February 1898 at his home at Castle Hill, Rotherfield, Sussex, and was buried in the village five days later. On the day after his death the Italian parliament passed a flattering tribute, echoing Garibaldi, who had described him &#145;as the type of Englishman with courage, loyalty and consistency, the friend of Italy in her evil days, and the champion of the weak and oppressed abroad&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 18 Feb 1898, 14a).<br>
