<span class="headword">Petyt <span class="st"> [Petit]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1494, <em>d.</em> 1565/6), <span class="occ">printer and bookseller</span>, was born in England but may have been related to the Parisian printer John Petit, who is said to have had printed books &#145;in thaundes of Thomas Petytt&#146; in exchequer receipts  (Duff, <span class="italic">Century</span>, 120). Nothing further is known of Petyt's origins, although he had property in Greenstead and Stanford Rivers, Essex, and a kinswoman named Agnes Vincent, in Sheppey, Kent. In his will he also describes himself as kinsman to Anthony Kitson, a former apprentice and a fellow bookseller in London. Petyt was freed as a member of the Drapers' Company by John Hutton in 1519, and was the first member of that company to become a printer. His shop was at St Paul's Churchyard at the sign of the Maiden's Head, from which he issued books from 1536 until at least 1561. He may have leased the property as early as 1523, when he was assessed for &pound;10 in a lay subsidy as a resident of St Faith's parish. In 1547 he also freed the draper Thomas Raynald, who took over operation of his press while Petyt continued to publish and sell books from Maiden's Head. By 1548, some of his printing material had passed to William Hill.<br>
<br>Copies of fifty-nine editions printed by or for Petyt are extant. His name first appears in a 1536 edition of <span class="italic">The Rutter of the Sea</span>. His output was varied: he printed law books, including George Ferrers's translation of <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span> and royal proclamations; devotional material in Latin and English; and popular, vernacular works, including jest books, short chronicles, and herbals. He took a share in an edition of Chaucer's <span class="italic">Works</span> (1550?) with William Bonham, Richard Kele, and Robert Toy, and an edition of <span class="italic">Four Sons of Aymon</span> with Toy and John Walley (1554). These editions give some indication of his dealings with his close neighbours in Paul's Cross. His shop was next to that of Toy, who bequeathed property at the sign of the Bell &#145;adioinynge to Master Petitts house&#146; to his widow in 1556  (Plomer, 12). Petyt was among those present in 1526 when the bishop of London issued his second set of injunctions to the booksellers  (Reed, 173&#150;5). Petyt is named, along with Bonham, John Reynes, Thomas Dockwray, Henry Tab, and Henry Pepwell, as one of the booksellers in arrears for his Paul's Cross property in September 1539, and with Toy again in the 1543&#150;4 lay subsidy roll. More intriguing is a record of a case that came before the lord mayor in 1546, in which Petyt's servant Elizabeth Harwood confessed to attempting to murder her master and mistress by putting &#145;Ratsbane in her mast<i>er</i>'s potte&#146;  (CLRO, Rep. 11, fol. 282<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Petyt's career as a book producer began at the time of the Reformation, and his own religious affiliations apparently shifted with official policy. He printed Tyndale bibles for the king's printer, Thomas Berthelet, in 1539, and further editions under Edward IV, but issued works on behalf of the Catholic cause under Mary, including an edition of Richard Smith's <span class="italic">Brief Treatyse Settynge Forth Diuers Truthes</span>. In 1543 the privy council imprisoned a bookseller by the name of Petye with Edward Whitchurch, Richard Grafton, John Byddell, William Middleton, John Mayler, Richard Lant, and Kele in Poultry Compter for producing and distributing unlawful books. If this was Petyt there is no way of determining the specific nature of his transgression, as the lists of &#145;Englisshe bokes off ill matter&#146; each man was to produce have not survived  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, <i>1542&#150;7</i>, 117).<br>
<br>By the time of his death Petyt was a powerful member of the Drapers' Company. Among his apprentices was Christopher Munday, father of the writer Anthony Munday. He was admitted to its livery in 1535 and was warden of the company for 1545&#150;6, 1551&#150;2, 1554&#150;5, and 1561&#150;2. Between 1545 and 1561 his name frequently appears in the company's records of assessments for gifts, loans, and subsidies, usually as one of the wealthiest men assessed.<br>
<br>Petyt died at some point between 18 May 1565 when he drew up his will and 13 February 1566 when it was proved by his wife and sole executor, Joanne (whose previous married name was Wood). Gefferey Finche of Greenstead is named supervisor. Petyt makes bequests to his wife's children by a former marriage: Marie, Margaret, Dennys, Elizabeth, William, and John Wood. He also makes bequests to a number of London stationers in addition to Kitson: William Riddell's widow, Abraham Veale, John Wight (whom Petyt freed in 1540), Thomas Wight (John's son and Petyt's godson), and the queen's printer, John Cawood. Notable among his other legatees is Steven Tenaunte, the lord treasurer's chaplain.<br>
