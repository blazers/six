<span class="headword">Cross,  Letitia</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1682?, <em>d.</em> 1737), <span class="occ">singer and actress</span>, was, according to a statement in 1712, the daughter of Ann Cross; she may have been the daughter of Leonard and Ann Cross baptized on 6 March 1682 at St Martin's, Dorking, Surrey. A prologue which she spoke in spring 1696 included the words &#145;Look to't, ye Beaus, my Fifteen is a coming&#146;  (Danchin, <span class="italic">Restoration</span>, 3.289), which would place her birth in 1681 or 1682. She described herself as &#145;having from her Childhood been educated in the theatre&#146;  (Milhous and Hume, &#145;Theatrical politics&#146;, 428), and by 1694 she was a member of London's only theatre company. In spring 1695, when Thomas Betterton and other star players seceded, she remained with the Drury Lane / Dorset Garden company and was a leading performer of the music which Henry Purcell wrote in the last few months of his life. She sang new songs by him in <span class="italic">The Indian Queen</span>, by Robert Howard and John Dryden, <span class="italic">The Mock Marriage</span>, by Thomas Scott, <span class="italic">The Rival Sisters</span> by Robert Gould, and John Dryden's version of <span class="italic">The Tempest</span>, where she played Dorinda and sang &#145;Dear pretty youth&#146;. As the doomed young Bonvica in an anonymous adaptation of Fletcher's <span class="italic">Bonduca</span> she sang &#145;O lead me to some peaceful gloom&#146;, as Altisidora in Thomas D'Urfey's <span class="italic">Don Quixote Part 3</span> she performed Purcell's great mad song &#145;From rosy bowers&#146;, and in Thomas Southerne's <span class="italic">Oroonoko</span> she sang a <i>faux-na&iuml;f</i> dialogue with the boy Jemmy Bowen. The theatre exploited her youth and charm in teasing prologues and epilogues, and she became an accomplished comic actress. In <span class="italic">The Female Wits</span>, an anonymous theatrical satire performed in 1696, Mrs Cross appeared as herself. She was called &#145;pretty Miss&#146; and &#145;a little inconsiderable Creature&#146;, sang, danced, and threatened (aside) to kick an admiring fop &#145;i'th' Chops&#146;. In November 1696 she created Miss Hoyden in John Vanbrugh's <span class="italic">The Relapse</span>. When Peter the Great visited England early in 1698 he went to the theatre and she became his mistress; on his departure he sent her 500 guineas, which she thought insufficient. She gave a concert at York Buildings on 1 June 1698, but by the end of the year had left the stage for &#145;an Excursion into <i>France</i>, with a certain Baronet&#146;  (Egerton, 2).<br>
<br>On 2 January 1705 Mrs Cross, &#145;Famous for Singing and Acting in the last Reign&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diverting Post</span>), returned to Drury Lane to perform &#145;several Entertainments of Singing and Danceing&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Courant</span>, 2 Jan 1705). On 16 January she sang in the first all-sung English opera in the Italian style, Thomas Clayton's <span class="italic">Arsinoe</span>. On 8 February she appeared as Florimel, the role written for Nell Gwyn in Dryden's <span class="italic">Secret Love</span>, and in April she created Mrs Clerimont, a lady returned from the continent with French affectations, in Richard Steele's <span class="italic">The Tender Husband</span>. In <span class="italic">The Tempest</span> she sang &#145;her Original Song of Dear Pretty Youth&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Courant</span>, 1 Jan 1707), and later new roles included Miranda in the premi&egrave;re of Susanna Centlivre's <span class="italic">The Busybody</span>, on 12 May 1709. On 31 March 1706, at St Benet Paul's Wharf, she married Martin Weir, who died fighting in Flanders soon after. She signed a five-year contract with Owen Swiny in 1709, but a year later Swiny was joined in management by Colley Cibber, Robert Wilks, and Thomas Doggett, and the new managers refused to employ her. The following March they received a letter from seventy-three gentlemen, threatening to wreck Doggett's benefit if she was not reinstated. In a letter to the lord chamberlain she denied instigating this and claimed that she had dissuaded them. <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> of 6 April 1711 reported that Mrs Cross had visited Holland, where she was not computed as handsome as a Dutch soprano &#145;by near half a Tun&#146;. In 1712 she took out a lawsuit against Swiny, making a strong case, but he was in debt and fled abroad. Her return to the London stage came only in the 1714&#150;15 season, when a new theatre managed by John Rich opened at Lincoln's Inn Fields. She acted, spoke saucy prologues and epilogues, danced, and sang. Mrs Cross was away from the stage for three seasons (1717&#150;20) and after October 1725 made only a single appearance, as Monimia in Thomas Otway's <span class="italic">The Orphan</span>, for her benefit on 8 May 1732. She died at her lodgings in Leicester Fields on 4 April 1737, and was buried on 8 April at St James's, Piccadilly. She left mourning rings to a number of friends and the share in the Lincoln's Inn Fields theatre which she had inherited from her mother to her friend and residuary legatee Elizabeth Barker.<br>
