<span class="headword">Douglas,  William</span>, first duke of Queensberry  (1637&#150;1695), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7895/', "James Douglas, second earl of Queensberry (d. 1671)")</script>, and Lady Margaret Stewart (<i>d</i>. 1673), daughter of the first earl of Traquair. Born on the eve of the revolutionary upheavals of the 1640s and 1650s, he did not receive the usual education of a young nobleman, &#145;but being a Man of very good natural Parts, and of a clear Judgment, when he came to engage in publict Business, he made a good Figure, and managed Affairs with great Dexterity and Address&#146;  (Crawfurd, 419). He served a political apprenticeship locally in the 1660s, obtaining appointments as a commissioner of excise in 1661, as a justice of the peace in 1663, and as sheriff and coroner of Dumfriesshire in 1664 and 1667. In 1667 he also made his entry into national politics when he was appointed a privy councillor. It was during these years that he started a family. He married Lady Isabel Douglas (<i>bap</i>. 1642, <i>d</i>. 1691), daughter of the first marquess of Douglas, in 1657, and together they had four children. Their son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7897/', "James Douglas (1662&#150;1711)")</script> succeeded in due course as the second duke of Queensberry; William became the first earl of March; George, who died unmarried in 1693, left a valuable library which his father donated to the Faculty of Advocates; and their daughter, Anne, married the third earl of Wemyss in 1697.<br>
<br>Queensberry was well placed to benefit from the collapse of the Lauderdale regime at the end of the 1670s. He was appointed justice-general of Scotland on 1 June 1680, an extraordinary lord of session on 1 November 1681, and constable and governor of Edinburgh Castle on 21 September 1682. But it was as high treasurer of Scotland that he was to make his mark. After his father's death in 1671 he had demonstrated a gift for financial management in restoring his family's wealth, greatly depleted by the war and by the imposition of a severe financial penalty by Cromwell. On 12 May 1682 he was appointed high treasurer with instructions to raise &pound;40,000 per annum for the king and with permission to retain any surplus for himself. According to Sir John Lauder, &#145;he, like a new byssom, fell on sundry methods to inrich the Tresurie&#146;  (<span class="italic">Historical Notices</span>, 359). According to Gilbert Burnet, he &#145;was for every thing that would bring money into the treasury&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 378). Husbands were to be fined when their wives failed to attend church, dissidents were to be prevented from travelling to the colonies until every fine possible had been extracted from them, new powers were to be exercised in reviewing the financial administration of burghs and other bodies, and generally no opportunity was to be missed in recovering the payments due to the crown. Not surprisingly, both the king and the duke of York held Douglas in high esteem. He was created marquess of Queensberry on 11 February 1682 and duke of Queensberry on 3 February 1684. In 1685 he was appointed commissioner to the first session of the parliament of James VII and II, and the shires through which he passed on his journey from London to Edinburgh as the king's representative were ordered to wait upon him. He had reached the zenith of his political career.<br>
<br>Burnet noted that Queensberry was reckoned by his colleagues to be &#145;haughty&#146; and &#145;imperious&#146;, and his own view was that he had difficulty in maintaining an alliance with anyone because he &#145;loved to be absolute, and to direct every thing&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 418, 613). When he first came to office as treasurer he worked closely with the chancellor, the earl of Aberdeen, but a deep antipathy developed between them which manifested itself in a series of public confrontations. In December 1683 the power of the chancellor was curbed and in July 1684 he was ousted from office and replaced by the earl of Perth, who had contrived with Queensberry to bring about his downfall. For a few months Queensberry worked in harmony with the new chancellor, but within a year he was leading one faction in the privy council and the chancellor another. Although the chancellor failed in his attempt to gather evidence of malpractice in the Treasury and could only present the king with a series of complaints that were deemed to be lacking in substance, he did manage to undermine the king's confidence in Queensberry. He was not appointed royal commissioner to the second session of the 1685 parliament and in March 1686 he was deprived of overall control of the Treasury. Technically he became one of a commission of five treasurers, another of whom was the chancellor, and at the same time he was made president of the privy council, but as Lauder observed, this was &#145;first to break his head, and then to put on his kowll&#146;  (<span class="italic">Historical Notices</span>, 712). Little over a week later he was replaced as constable and governor of Edinburgh Castle by the duke of Gordon, and the cloak of continuing favour finally slipped away in June 1686 when he was deprived of his places in the Treasury, privy council, and session, under orders to remain in Edinburgh until the accounts of the Treasury could be audited.<br>
<br>During his brief period in high office Queensberry had concentrated his attention on financial administration and had gained and retained power partly by gathering in the king's revenues with exceptional efficiency, partly by paying the king's creditors with uncommon promptness, and partly by using government funds to buy influence. Ultimately, however, his survival had not been dependent on his financial dealings. If Queensberry's differences with the earl of Aberdeen over the treatment of conventiclers had been motivated by a desire to draw in as much revenue from the imposition of fines as he could, what had pleased Charles II was the firm line he appeared to be taking against religious dissent. Similarly, what had turned James VII and II against him had not been any malpractice in the management of the Treasury but his refusal to offer assistance in the promotion of Catholicism. When James first came to the throne Queensberry warned the king that he would be party to no assault on the established religion, and it was on the basis of an assurance from the king that no such assault was intended that he saw a series of acts through the parliament of 1685 to secure the revenues of the crown, to authorize the privy council to impose a religious test on all levels of society, and to clamp down further on religious dissent. In the following year the earl of Perth was able to suggest that the programme of legislation devised by the king could have been carried through the parliament without all the promises Queensberry made on behalf of the king that there would be no change in religious policy. Unlike the earl of Perth, Queensberry refused the attempts made to convert him, including, he claimed, an offer of some &pound;20,000, and he was praised for his public demonstration of commitment to the reformed faith.<br>
<br>Despite prolonged efforts to find fault with the Treasury accounts and a search for informants to testify to maladministration, Queensberry was able to retire quietly from public life until the arrival of William and Mary. He then equivocated, hoping on the one hand that if James survived he would turn again to his successful ministers, and on the other hand that if James was deposed the new monarchs would look favourably on the experienced father of the first notable Scot to join their ranks after the landing at Torbay. In fact, it was not until after the duke's death on 28 March 1695, at the age of fifty-eight, that his eldest son was able to obtain one of the major offices of state again for the family. Although Queensberry had been appointed an extraordinary lord of session once more in 1693, he had spent most of the early 1690s in retirement from political life, devoting his time to the construction of Drumlanrig Castle. He was laid to rest in the parish church of Durisdeer, Dumfriesshire.<br>
