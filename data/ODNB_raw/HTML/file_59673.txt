<span class="headword">Drury <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Warter]</span>,  Susanna</span>  (<em>b. </em>1698?, <em>d.</em> in or after 1770), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was, on her father's side, from a family of East Anglian origin which had been established in Ireland since Elizabethan times, a branch having settled in Dublin by 1675. Susanna was one of five children of Lieutenant Thomas Drury (who was baptized at St Peter and St Kevin, Aungier Street, Dublin, on 11 November 1683), the son of John Drury and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Leeson, who married there in 1675; Susanna's mother was Rebeckah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Franklin (buried at St Ann's, Dawson Street, Dublin, on 27 September 1732). Susanna's date of birth is not certain, but her parents were probably the Thomas Drury and Rebecca Franklin who were married on 28 August 1695 at North Elmham, Norfolk, where their two eldest children, Thomas and Rebecca, were also baptized. Their other children were Mary Drury (baptized at St Catherine's, Dublin, on 23 September 1714); the Revd John Drury (1716&#150;1791), vicar of Powerscourt, co. Wicklow; Franklin Drury, miniature painter, who died at Powerscourt, in 1771; and Elizabeth Drury, who married John Dudley at St Anne's, Dublin, on 6 November 1750 and by 1770 was a widow. Neither is it certain where Susanna was trained, but it may have been London, as her only dated work is <span class="italic">View of London from One-Tree Hill, Greenwich Park</span> (1733; sold in Dublin 1905; in Frank Sabin collection, London, in 1954).<br>
<br>A pair of landscapes or perspectives, <span class="italic">The Giant's Causeway</span>, won the &pound;25 premium of the Dublin Society in 1740, and Susanna Drury's identity was disclosed to the society by Gabriel Maturin, a Huguenot, then dean of Kildare and later Jonathan Swift's successor at St Patrick's, Dublin. Her views of the Giant's Causeway were engraved in London in 1743&#150;4 by Fran&ccedil;ois Vivar&egrave;s, another Huguenot. These engravings, the first-ever accurate views of the site, were circulated throughout Europe and provided the French geologist Nicolas Demarest with evidence to support his &#145;Vulcanist&#146; theory of the origin of basalt, against the current &#145;Neptunist&#146; theory held by Abraham Gottlob Werner. Mary Delany, Swift's friend, wrote to her sister on 8 October 1758: &#145;Mrs Drury, who took the draughts (of which you have the prints) lived three months near the place, and went almost every day. I can do nothing so exact and finished&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography &hellip; Mrs Delany</span>, 3.519). Two pairs of Susanna Drury's gouache paintings on vellum of the Giant's Causeway are known, one pair in the Ulster Museum, Belfast, and the other in the collection of the knight of Glin at Glin Castle, co. Limerick. Apart from her view of London, the only identified works by Susanna Drury are the views of the Giant's Causeway, which remain landmarks both in Irish topography and in European scientific illustration. Her married name was probably Warter, as a &#145;Susanna Warter &hellip; she a painter of landscape&#146; appears in her brother Franklin Drury's will of 1770.<br>
