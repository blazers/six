<span class="headword">Oengus <span class="st"> [Angus]</span> mac Forgusso</span> <span class="st"> [Onuist son of Uurguist]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 761), <span class="occ">king of Picts</span>, was also called Angus; both names are Celtic and have Pictish equivalents, Onuist and U(u)rguist. The name of his father, Forgus, however, is unrelated to the later name form Fergus. Since Oengus's brother, who succeeded him, is called king of Fortriu in 763, it may be supposed that Oengus also was primarily king of that Pictish province [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49277/', "Picts, kings of the")</script>]. In 724 the king Nechtan, Derile's son, had received <i>clericatus</i> (probably &#145;the monastic habit&#146;) and relinquished the kingship, perhaps unwillingly. There then followed five years of conflict. The first contestants for the kingship are named simply as Drust and Alpin, possibly Nechtan's nephews. In 728 Oengus, Forgus's son, now heard of for the first time, intervened. After a series of battles in which Drust was killed and Alpin driven out, Nechtan was apparently reinstated for some months of 729. But the end result was that Oengus became overking. His reign, however, was reckoned from 731, if the &#145;thirty years&#146; of the king-lists is to be believed. Nechtan died in 732.<br>
<br>In 731 comes the first mention of hostility between Oengus and a Talorg, son of Congus. The names suggest that Talorg's father was of royal D&aacute;l Riatan descent and his mother Pictish. He was engaged in battle, and routed, by a son of Oengus named Brude (or Bridei). It seems that Talorg possessed, or obtained soon after 731, support from D&uacute;ngal, Selvach's son, the head of the Lorne family of D&aacute;l Riata, who had held and then lost the overkingship of the D&aacute;l Riata [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49278/', "D&#225;l Riata, kings of")</script>]. In 733 D&uacute;ngal dragged Brude out of sanctuary in Tory Island, and in the next year Oengus took his revenge. A fortress of D&uacute;ngal's was destroyed and he fled, wounded, to Ireland, &#145;to be out of the power of Oengus&#146;  (Anderson, <span class="italic">Early Sources</span>, 1.232). In the same year Talorg was handed over to the Picts by his own &#145;brother&#146;, possibly the Alpin (by then part-king of the D&aacute;l Riata) who had once held the Pictish kingship. The Picts put Talorg to death by drowning. It is to be supposed that Oengus's son Brude had been set at liberty.<br>
<br>In this year 734 also a Talorgan, son of Drostan, was captured near the Lorne fortress of Dunollie. He too was drowned, by order of Oengus, five years later, when he is described as king of Atholl. Nothing more is known about him, unless he was the Talorg, son of Drostan, who had been imprisoned by Oengus's predecessor Nechtan in 713.<br>
<br>In 736 Oengus led a major attack on D&aacute;l Riatan territory. He himself took the great fortress of Dunadd, burnt an unidentified &#145;Creic&#146;, and captured D&uacute;ngal and his brother. A D&aacute;l Riatan army led by D&uacute;ngal's cousin Muredach was routed by Oengus's brother Talorgan, probably at Ederline near Loch Awe, in a district called Calathros. Rock-carvings at Dunadd, it has been suggested, may be evidence of a formal take-over by Oengus. There is no other evidence of him as an acknowledged king of D&aacute;l Riata. An annal entry of his &#145;smiting of Dalriada&#146;  (Anderson, <span class="italic">Kings and Kingship</span>, 186) as late as 741 suggests that he may not have gained immediate control of the whole country in 736.<br>
<br>Of the latter part of Oengus's reign little is known (the Iona annal source dries up about 740). In 750 a battle was fought between Picts and Britons at a place which Skene identified as Mugdock, a few miles east of Dumbarton, the Britons' chief fortress. Among the many Pictish dead was Oengus's brother Talorgan. In the same year an annalist in Ireland wrote of the &#145;ebbing of the sovereignty of Oengus&#146;  (Anderson, <span class="italic">Early Sources</span>, 1.240), perhaps referring to the Picts' recent defeat, but more directly to beginnings of D&aacute;l Riatan resurgence. In 756 Oengus joined Eadberht, king of Northumbria, in a successful expedition against Dumbarton.<br>
<br>Oengus died in 761. His son Brude had died in 736. A later Pictish king, Talorgen, son of Oengus, was possibly another son. A continuator of Bede's history says of Oengus that &#145;as a slaughtering tyrant he carried on his reign's beginning with bloody crime even to the end&#146;  (Anderson, <span class="italic">Scottish Annals</span>, 57). It is not possible to tell whether the Northumbrian writer had a special reason for this judgement, apart from what is known of Oengus's undoubtedly forceful career.<br>
