<span class="headword">Gilbey, Sir  Walter</span>, first baronet  (1831&#150;1914), <span class="occ">wine merchant and horse breeder</span>, was born on 2 May 1831 at Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, the sixth son of Henry Gilbey, coach proprietor, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of William Bailey of Stansted, Essex. Educated at Bishop's Stortford grammar school, Gilbey was briefly apprenticed to an estate agent cousin before taking employment with a parliamentary agent in London. At the outbreak of the Crimean War he joined his brother Alfred in applying for a civilian post in the War Office, and the two men travelled to the front, where they were engaged in administrative duties throughout the hostilities. In 1857, several years after their return to England, the brothers established themselves in the wine trade.<br>
<br>On the advice of their elder brother, Henry, himself a prosperous wine merchant, the junior Gilbeys acquired premises on the corner of Berwick Street and Oxford Street in London and, with the assistance of a generous injection of capital from their brother, embarked on a course which, by 1860, was to make them the third largest importers of wine in Britain. Despite Gladstone's equalization of duties on colonial and foreign wines (to the disadvantage of the Gilbeys, who dealt solely in colonial products), the business flourished by means of direct sales to retail grocers via a country-wide system of local agencies. By 1869 the Gilbey holdings included a warehouse complex and gin distillery in Camden Town, London, while the 1880s witnessed the purchase of whisky distilleries in Scotland and a vineyard complex in the M&eacute;doc.<br>
<br>The operation of this highly lucrative business was due in no small measure to Walter Gilbey's organizational skills. Intelligent delegation, allied to great care in staff selection and attention to market research, ensured a smoothly efficient business, whose financial returns afforded Gilbey the leisure to concentrate on cultivating his own interests. Indeed, by the late 1860s it was no longer necessary for him to be involved in day-to-day company affairs and, although he retained an active financial and management interest until his retirement in 1905, he became increasingly a country gentleman, and less of a wine merchant, as the years went by.<br>
<br>Six years after his marriage in 1858 to Ellen (<i>d</i>. 1896), daughter of John Parish of Bishop's Stortford, Gilbey purchased Hargrave Park, not far from his native town, and he lived there for the next ten years. By 1874 an increasing family and a growing interest in land management prompted the sale of Hargrave Park and the purchase of the 8000 acre Essex estate of Elsenham Hall, where Gilbey was to remain for the rest of his life. Here his restless, and apparently boundless, energies were expended in the development of the estate, establishing the celebrated Elsenham jams and promoting fruit and lavender growing on the home farm. He proved a characteristically generous landlord and a pillar of strength to many charities; at the same time, he was widely celebrated as a host, both at Elsenham and at his London residence, Cambridge House in Regent's Park. A staunchly anti-tory supporter of home rule, Gilbey resisted the blandishments of W. E. Gladstone and refused to stand for parliament, being content to restrict his public life to the magistracy and deputy lieutenancy of Middlesex. For all his professions of socialism in his later years (which were probably little more than contrived eccentricities), he appears to have had little genuine political interest.<br>
<br>Gilbey's tastes were essentially those of a country gentleman. He assembled one of the richest libraries of sporting and agricultural works in Britain, and was an avid collector of paintings and engravings reflecting his love of country life and, more especially, of the horse. His lengthy biographies of Moreland and Stubbs both attracted critical acclaim; he also wrote a variety of books, pamphlets, and articles, dealing primarily with equine matters, though not without the occasional foray into the worlds of cockfighting and poultry keeping. His general interest in rural affairs led to the endowment, in 1896, of the Gilbey lectureship in the history and economics of agriculture at the University of Cambridge.<br>
<br>Respected throughout the agricultural world for his enormous practical knowledge of animal husbandry, Gilbey had been one of the first to recognize the essential importance of breeding superior livestock to meet the needs of an agricultural economy which was assuming an increasingly pastoral character by the 1870s. Moreover, his speeches and writings on the dangers of over-reliance upon overseas supplies of cavalry-type horses did much to resuscitate British horse breeding from the doldrums into which it had recently descended. He was closely instrumental in the foundation of the Shire Horse Society and the Hackney Horse Society, respectively in 1878 and 1883, and of the Hunters Improvement Society in 1885, and in the establishment of the royal commission on horse breeding in 1888.<br>
<br>A practical man first and foremost, Gilbey built up his own stud of shire horses, and also set about assembling quality horses of the hackney breed. An exacting critic of horseflesh, his almost encyclopaedic knowledge of breeding and stud management and his unerring judgement brought him into personal contact with several members of the royal family. He regularly advised the prince of Wales on equine matters, and it was due largely to the intercession of the prince that he was created baronet in 1893. To his various honours, including the presidency of the Shire and Hackney Horse societies, was added the presidency of the Royal Agricultural Society of England in 1896.<br>
<br>Selfless service to the cause of agricultural and equine improvement over a period of some forty years was the hallmark of this tall, slim man, of genial and unaffected manner and fastidious tastes. His ample generosity, natural courtesy, and hatred of injustice endeared him to all with whom he came into contact. Although deeply distressed by the death of his wife in 1896, he continued to pursue his many interests and did not finally retire from the wine business until 1905. Walter Gilbey had never enjoyed the soundest of health, and a lower than normal body temperature meant that he was regularly the victim of colds, bronchitis, and kindred maladies. Laid low with bronchitis once again in late October 1914, he died on 12 November 1914 at his home, Elsenham Hall, Essex. He was buried in St Michael's Church, Bishop's Stortford, on 19 November, mourned by his four sons and four daughters. The baronetcy, and the bulk of his property passed to his eldest son, Walter.<br>
