<span class="headword">Bonnell,  James</span>  (1653&#150;1699), <span class="occ">government official</span>, was born in Genoa on 14 November 1653, the son of Samuel Bonnell, a merchant and ardent royalist (<i>d</i>. 1663), and his wife, Rebecca Sayer (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1691), daughter of Thomas Sayer of Norwich. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26690/', "John Strype")</script>, the ecclesiastical historian, was James's cousin and close friend. Samuel himself was the grandson of the protestant refugee Thomas Bonnell, originally &#145;a gentleman of good family near Ypres&#146;  (Hamilton, 1), who had fled Spanish persecutions and settled in Norwich, where he became mayor. Samuel made a promising beginning to his career. Apprenticed to the great London merchant Sir William Courteen he eventually settled at Leghorn, and by 1649 was said to be worth &pound;10,000. However, commercial misfortunes and generous subsidies to the exiled Charles II greatly reduced his circumstances, and in 1655 he returned to England. A belated recompense came in 1662 in the form of a grant of the office of accountant-general of Ireland, worth some &pound;800 a year, jointly to himself and his son. After Samuel's death in March 1663 the office was regranted to James Bonnell and Robert Wood. The benefits of the patent were enjoyed only until 1669: after the removal of the duke of Ormond from the viceroyalty a new Irish establishment was issued in which all remuneration for the accountant-generalship was effectively suspended.<br>
<br>By this time James Bonnell was at Cambridge, where he had been sent, as he put it, &#145;by the Duke of Ormond's orders&#146;  (Hamilton, 1). His mother, &#145;a woman of singular piety and prudence&#146;, had taken great care in his upbringing to &#145;give a right tincture to his mind, and season it with the love of virtue and religion&#146;  (Hamilton, 3). After early education in Dublin he had been sent to school at Trim, co. Meath, under the care of Richard Tennison, later bishop of Meath, who remembered him as &#145;a child of a most innocent and genteel behaviour, never inclined to any vice, but strictly religious, and extraordinarily ingenious&#146;  (Hamilton, 4); one who &#145;had the greatest sense of religion that ever I knew any boy in my life&#146;  (NL Ire., Smythe of Barbavilla MSS, P.C. 435, Tennison to Mrs Jane Bonnell, 21 April 1705). He then proceeded, about 1667, to a nonconformist academy at Nettlebed, Oxfordshire, run by Thomas Cole, former principal of St Mary's Hall, Oxford. The general atmosphere, and in particular the behaviour of his fellow pupils, was not conducive to piety, and he seems to have felt distinctly uncomfortable there. While refusing to find fault with Cole he admitted that the school possessed &#145;all the dangers and vices of the university without the advantages&#146;  (Hamilton, 11).<br>
<br>At St Catharine's College, Cambridge, where he was admitted pensioner in July 1669 and matriculated in 1672, his situation greatly improved: he was taught by Benjamin Calamy, son of the prominent nonconformist Edmund Calamy sen. and was surrounded by like-minded undergraduates, including Calamy's brother James, who became his particular friend, and Offspring Blackall, future bishop of Exeter. In this atmosphere of intense religiosity &#145;his advancement in learning kept equal pace with his improvements in piety&#146;  (Hamilton, 12). He formed habits of personal introspection, prayer, and devotional practice which stayed with him throughout his life, especially the frequent reception of holy communion, and regular observance of fast days. Having graduated BA in 1673, and proceeded MA three years later, he obtained a post as tutor to the young Ralph Freman, son of Ralph Freman of Aspenden in Hertfordshire and later tory MP for the county. Having failed in an application to the crown for an ecclesiastical appointment he accompanied his young charge to the continent in 1678 on a prolonged grand tour to the United Provinces, France, and Italy; and this despite chronic ill health, which he endured with fortitude. They were at Nijmegen in 1678 during the negotiation of the treaty, where Bonnell made a favourable impression on the English diplomat Sir Leoline Jenkins. He eventually returned to Ireland in 1684.<br>
<br>In the meantime his office had been re-established as &#145;comptroller- and accountant-general&#146;: Bonnell held first a half-share and then the whole patent until he was replaced in 1691. Even then he acted as his successor's deputy for more than three years. At some point he ceased to pursue actively his ambition of taking holy orders, declining an offer from his former pupil Freman to purchase an advowson for him, but in essence he remained a priest <i>manqu&eacute;</i>, and always regretted having followed a secular path.<br>
<br>Bonnell remained at his post throughout the revolution of 1688 and the ensuing war, but was subsequently critical of his own passivity, especially when contrasted with the more vigorous opposition to the Jacobites made by his friend William King, later bishop of Derry. At the time his prayers and meditations show not only a deep concern for the protestant cause in Ireland but sorrow for the sins which, he felt, had brought down this providential judgment. His joy and relief at the Williamite victory were tinged with anxiety for the security of the revolution settlement: this, he felt, required not only radical political measures, if possible an incorporating union between England and Ireland, but a thorough reformation in the religious and moral life of protestant Ireland, to propitiate divine providence.<br>
<br>Bonnell's Anglicanism was of a comprehensionist kind, as befitted a former associate of the Calamys, and although he was proud of the traditions of the established church, he was also conscious of the spiritual weaknesses of both clergy and laity. He helped to promote the religious societies which flourished in Dublin in the 1690s, bringing together pious young men to pray, sing psalms, and organize charity for the poor; and the societies for the reformation of manners, which sought to enforce the public observance of Christian precepts, notably sabbath observance (something always close to Bonnell's heart), and the rejection of blasphemy and sexual incontinence. In this work he was greatly encouraged by his marriage, in 1693, to Jane (<i>d</i>. 1754), daughter of Sir Albert Conyngham of Mount Charles, co. Donegal, who was both pious and exceedingly well connected (one of her sisters married William Conolly, a future speaker of the Irish House of Commons). She brought him unexpected domestic happiness relatively late in life, bore him a son and a daughter, and subsequently devoted herself to fostering his posthumous reputation. Bonnell left the accountant-general's office in March 1695 to take on the secretaryship of the revived forfeitures commission, and when, a year later, the commission was wound up and its functions transferred to the Irish revenue commission, a place was found for him under the revenue commission as registrar of forfeitures.<br>
<br>Bonnell died of a fever in April 1699 and was buried in St John's Church, Dublin, on 29 April. His funeral sermon, preached by one of his many episcopal friends and admirers, Edward Wetenhall of Kilmore, offered his life as &#145;a pattern of most universal virtue&#146;  (Wetenhall, 30&#150;31), and suggested that in earlier ages he would have been regarded as a saint. Another bishop, William King, composed the inscription for his funerary monument, and, in a somewhat proprietorial manner, proposed writing his life, but the formidable Mrs Bonnell arranged for this honour to pass instead to Archdeacon William Hamilton of Armagh. Published in 1703, the <span class="italic">Life</span> went through at least seven editions, the last in 1852. Bonnell himself studied and wrote extensively, leaving behind a corpus of manuscript meditations. His favourite authors, not surprisingly, were Thomas &agrave; Kempis and Richard Hooker. One work, <span class="italic">The Harmony of the Holy Gospels Digested into one History</span>, was published posthumously in 1705. Bonnell's widow was resident at Writtle, Essex, at her death in 1754  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/740, fols. 113<i>r</i>&#150;115<i>r</i>).<br>
