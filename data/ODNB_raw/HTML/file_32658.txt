<span class="headword">Cudlipp,  Percival Thomas James <span class="st"> [Percy]</span></span>  (1905&#150;1962), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born at 180 Arabella Street, Cardiff, on 10 November 1905, the eldest son of William Christopher Cudlipp, commercial clerk, and his wife, Bessie Amelia Kinsman. Cudlipp's mother, educated at an elementary school, was a woman of strong personality and considerable intelligence, very ambitious for her children. In addition to Percy and a daughter there were two younger sons, both of whom were to become editors of national newspapers. Cudlipp said that his mother chose the names Percival, Reginald, and Hubert for her sons because they would sound well with knighthoods. The story was probably one of Cudlipp's fabrications but it fairly represents his mother's confidence in her sons. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69790/', "Hubert (Hugh) Cudlipp (1913&#150;1998)")</script> was made a life peer in 1974. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/94859/', "Reginald William (Reg) Cudlipp (1910&#150;2005)")</script> became a distinguished director of the Anglo-Japanese Economic Institute, but always regarded himself as a journalist first and foremost.<br>
<br>Brought up in the Welsh nonconformist tradition the Cudlipp family attended the Wesleyan chapel at Crwys Street, Cardiff, although it seems that for Percy the most powerful magnet there was not religion but the chapel's flourishing dramatic society, for which, having a natural histrionic gift inherited from his mother, he played the part of Shylock in <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>. He was educated at Howard Gardens secondary school, which he left at the age of thirteen. His mother paid a fine so that before reaching school-leaving age Percy could begin work in the office of the <span class="italic">South Wales Echo</span>, where an opening had occurred which he was determined to fill. He had a precocious talent for rhyme and had already contributed a great deal of verse to the paper, which advertised him as the boy poet of Cardiff. His facility for dexterous and witty verse remained with him throughout his career.<br>
<br>After six years of apprenticeship, during which he had assimilated the techniques of the profession and had been assiduous in attendance at the local night school, Cudlipp went in 1924 to Manchester as a reporter on the <span class="italic">Evening Chronicle</span>. At the same time he was contributing articles and light verse to London newspapers. Cudlipp's next move was predictable, and predictably early. In 1925 he moved to London as drama critic and humorous columnist on the <span class="italic">Sunday News</span>. That would have been enough for most journalists but it was not enough for Cudlipp. Through a publicity agent he became a purveyor of topical lyrics to the Co-optimists' revue running in a London theatre. Every afternoon he went to the theatre with the latest edition of the evening newspaper, which provided him with the material for a few verses to add to the lyric. In 1927, when he married Gwendoline May James, the show ran so long that Cudlipp was compelled to cancel his honeymoon in order that the supply of topical rhymes could continue; he needed the money. He and his wife had one son, Michael, who also became a journalist.<br>
<br>By that time it was becoming known in Fleet Street that a brilliant and versatile talent had descended on it. In consequence in 1929, as Percy Cudlipp, he became a special writer on the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span>. He had arrived, at the age of twenty-four, where every ambitious young journalist of the time wished to be, not indeed at the top of the tree but within earshot of Lord Beaverbrook. By this time Cudlipp's free-ranging talent was in full flower. One morning he interviewed No&euml;l Coward; in the later editions of the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> that day there appeared a half-page interview with Coward by Cudlipp, in verse, that was a parody of Coward's style and which astonished even Coward himself.<br>
<br>In 1931 Cudlipp was appointed assistant editor of the <span class="italic">Standard</span>, and two years later editor. He was then twenty-seven, the youngest editor of a British national newspaper. In becoming an editor Cudlipp turned his back on the particular talent that had marked him out among popular journalists: his ability to write smooth and witty English. From then on he was to be an executive journalist, an editor. If this involved the sacrifice of something which he valued Cudlipp never showed it. At the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span>, however, he was not completely happy because of a temperamental clash between himself and the manager of the paper, Michael Wardell, who combined a strong personality with highly conservative views about the paper. In 1938 Cudlipp joined the <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span> as editorial manager. In 1940, when Francis Williams resigned, Cudlipp became editor in defiance of the veto of the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>, which thought that the paper should have a socialist editor. In fact Cudlipp had always been a convinced socialist. The change of newspaper disconcerted those of Cudlipp's associates who had not realized how heavy had been the strain of his editorship at the <span class="italic">Standard</span>. At the <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span> he found working conditions far more complicated, and demanding of all his very considerable powers of diplomacy.<br>
<br>The trade unions, the Labour Party, Odhams Press&#151;co-proprietors of the newspaper&#151;each had different views about how a Labour newspaper should be run. There were, too, personal rivalries to consider. Cudlipp was on friendly terms with Herbert Morrison and incurred the dislike of Ernest Bevin, who wished to dominate the newspaper. When Cudlipp left the editorship in November 1953 it seemed that his editorial career was ending in something like frustration. Nothing could have been further from the truth. After a period as columnist in the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span> he became founder editor in 1956 of the <span class="italic">New Scientist</span>, a weekly which sought to convey accurate, authoritative scientific information in language which the layman could understand. In inspiring scientists to become comprehensible Cudlipp performed a notable service and made a brilliant success of the journal. His last years were, therefore, years of triumph.<br>
<br>Cudlipp was a gregarious man of great charm, good-natured and lively minded, a master in speech as in writing of precise and elegant English. After journalism, music was the passion of his life. His wit was sharp and exuberant. Beaverbrook once said of him, &#145;Percy's spear knows no brother&#146;. But in fact his tongue was without malice. His most celebrated remark was made about one of Beaverbrook's lieutenants who, in describing a ride with Beaverbrook over snow-covered terrain in Surrey, said incautiously, &#145;It was like the retreat from Moscow. Beaverbrook was Napoleon; I was Marshal Ney&#146;. &#145;You mean Marshal Yea!&#146;, said Cudlipp. It was, however, the victim of the remark who spread its fame.<br>
<br>Cudlipp died at his home, 11 Falmouth House, Clarendon Place, London, on 5 November 1962 and was cremated at Golders Green four days later. He was survived by his wife.<br>
