<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thornborough,  John</span>  (1551?&#150;1641), <span class="occ">bishop of Worcester</span>, was probably the son of Giles Thornborough of Salisbury, Wiltshire. In 1569, aged seventeen, he was admitted a demy of Magdalen College, Oxford, as of Wiltshire. He led a raffish undergraduate life, employing as his servant the young Simon Forman, who recorded that among other dubious activities Thornborough jilted a daughter of Giles Lawrence, archdeacon of Wiltshire. He graduated BA on 1 April 1573, and proceeded MA on 27 June 1575.<br>
<br>Having become chaplain to Henry Herbert, second earl of Pembroke, Thornborough accumulated a series of west country rectories: Ockford Fitzpaine, Dorset, and Orcheston St Mary, Wiltshire, in 1575; Marnhull, Dorset, in 1577; and Chilmark, Wiltshire, in 1578. On 16 June 1576 he was installed prebendary of Netherbury in Salisbury Cathedral on the presentation of a local brewer. Probably by 1582 he had become chaplain-in-ordinary to Queen Elizabeth, and on 22 March that year proceeded BTh at Oxford. In January 1586 he received letters patent for the mastership of the Savoy Hospital, London. On 14 July following he exchanged Netherbury for the Salisbury prebend of Bedminster and Ratcliffe. On 12 June 1587 letters patent for the archdeaconry of Norfolk proved ineffective.<br>
<br>According to his own account Thornborough was in 1588 responsible for bringing &#145;that concealed land of the Dacres to her majesty's receipts of exchequer&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 75, fol. 32<i>r</i>). This financial coup, and perhaps other secret services, evidently rendered him <i>persona grata</i> at court and secured him Elizabeth's unwavering support. When in May 1589 she demanded his further preferment Sir Francis Walsingham suggested the bishopric of Salisbury. Archbishops John Whitgift and John Piers pronounced him too young and insufficiently learned for so senior a post, proposing a junior deanery (Peterborough or Rochester) instead. Elizabeth therefore ordered Walsingham to &#145;bring him to accept one of these &hellip; for a beginning to further advancing of him&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/224/39). Thornborough managed to drive a better bargain and in October was elected dean of York. On 17 March 1590 Archbishop Piers collated him to the prebend of Tockrington in York Minster.<br>
<br>Although the deanery yielded over &pound;300 per annum Thornborough quickly fell into debt. In July 1592 he applied in abject terms to the lord treasurer, Lord Burghley, for the bishopric of Limerick, to be held <i>in commendam</i> with his deanery. He was prepared to resign the Savoy and live in Ireland, solely on Limerick's revenues, until his debts were discharged. By July 1593 he and his sureties (his father and brother) had become liable to imprisonment for defaulting on payment of his first fruits. Desperate, he petitioned Elizabeth herself, offering to resign the deanery and live on an <i>ex gratia</i> pension. Elizabeth was predictably sympathetic and in September 1593 he was duly granted Limerick and allowed to hold his deanery <i>in commendam</i>.<br>
<br>For the next five years Thornborough shuttled between Ireland, London, and York, successfully petitioning for the regularization of Limerick's revenues, preaching there when in residence, and championing the cause of a government agent, William Udall, who had supplied information about the activities of Spanish spies and of the earl of Tyrone. In 1597 he was again a candidate for the bishopric of Salisbury.<br>
<br>Thornborough is last mentioned in the Irish state papers in December 1598 and in March 1599 he returned to York as a member of the council in the north. In 1601 and 1602 he obtained the Yorkshire rectories of Kirby Misperton and Brandesburton.<br>
<br>All this despite a scandal that would have destroyed a man who did not have the queen's entire backing. About 1582 Thornborough had married Elizabeth Bold. In 1594 or 1595, having reared several children, they were divorced, probably on the grounds of Elizabeth's adultery. Thornborough immediately remarried, even though as the law then stood divorce was no more than judicial separation and remarriage an impossibility. His new wife, Elizabeth Baynes, was moreover suspected to be pregnant at the time. Yet the queen seems to have condoned his actions: the second Mrs Thornborough was specifically mentioned in a deed of indenture which Elizabeth ordered to be drawn up to provide maintenance for Thornborough's former wife, and when he returned to York in 1599 it was with her &#145;special directions&#146; that the council in the north &#145;yield him such countenance as may be seeming for one of his sort&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 15/34/3).<br>
<br>Thornborough certainly required such countenance. As Archbishop Matthew Hutton observed to Robert Cecil, his remarriage was &#145;flat contrary&#146; to English law and &#145;much misliked by most of the clergy of this realm&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/270/75). Yet Hutton himself thought him the innocent party in the divorce case and, assured by Thornborough that he had not had sexual relations with his second wife before marriage, was prepared to consider it lawful.<br>
<br>Hutton may have come to regret his acquiescence. In 1601 the former Mrs Thornborough brought an action at common law, claiming that the bishop had defaulted on his alimony payments and invoking a penalty clause by which she was entitled to a lump-sum payment of &pound;250. He countered with a plea in the court of requests, accusing her of deliberate fraud: that having secretly remarried she then remained in hiding, circulating a rumour that she was dead in order to cause his default and liability to the penalty clause. The outcome of the case is unknown but on 17 November 1602 Thornborough preached what proved to be Elizabeth's last accession day sermon. John Chamberlain pronounced it dull but perhaps it was Elizabeth's way of demonstrating her continuing belief in him.<br>
<br>On resigning Limerick, but again retaining his deanery <i>in commendam</i>, Thornborough was enthroned bishop of Bristol on 23 August 1603. He perhaps owed his new sinecure to his wholehearted espousal of James I's plans for political union, for in 1604 he published <span class="italic">A discourse plainly proving the evident utilitie and urgent necessitie of the union of England and Scotland</span>. The House of Commons took immediate offence. Having emasculated James's proposals on the subject in April, they launched an attack on the book as violating the parliamentary privilege of secret debate. Their attempts to suppress it did not deter Thornborough, who returned to his theme in <span class="italic">The Joiefull and Blessed Reuniting the Two Kingdomes, England &amp; Scotland</span> (1605).<br>
<br>Never resident in Bristol, Thornborough remained an active dean of York. It was complained that his visits were usually infrequent and that he refused to allow important business to go forward in his absence but he was certainly preoccupied with the question of recusancy. Although his relations with archbishops Hutton and Toby Matthew are obscure he antagonized Edmund, third Lord Sheffield, president of the council in the north from 1603. In 1607, describing him as &#145;the unholy bishop of Bristol&#146;, Sheffield accused Thornborough of neglecting his preaching duties for his own gain and in order to curry favour with the government, &#145;for what time he could spare from bowling and carding&#146; he spent in hounding recusants  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 19.274). In fact Thornborough's efforts were more statesmanlike than Sheffield was prepared to admit. He was as concerned with recusant conformity as with extracting recusancy fines and after 1611 had the backing of the new primate, George Abbot.<br>
<br>Yet scandal was never far from Thornborough's door. In February 1612 an (unnamed) son committed suicide, apparently terrified of admitting to his stepmother that he had lost money at tennis. In 1615 Thornborough fell foul of the privy council for failing to provide a preaching minister in Pickering, capitulating only when summoned to London to answer charges. During the winter of 1615&#150;16 Mrs Thornborough was obscurely implicated in the <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i> of James's reign, the poisoning of Sir Thomas Overbury.<br>
<br>Still Thornborough prospered. After more than thirty years of government service and despite the candidature of Henry Beaumont, the duke of Buckingham's kinsman, he was elected bishop of Worcester on 25 January 1617 at the suit of William, third earl of Pembroke. Still vigorous, he immediately conducted a primary visitation, thereafter visiting triennially until 1636, proved an energetic Worcestershire magistrate, and seldom delegated episcopal functions to subordinates.<br>
<br>In 1621 Thornborough celebrated his lifelong interest in chemistry and alchemy by publishing, in Latin, <span class="italic">Lithotheorikos</span>. Parading his wide knowledge of ancient, medieval, and Renaissance authorities on the subject, it argues a deep, dark strain in his psyche. In 1627 he prepared for himself a grandiose tomb, decorated with obscure mottoes and astrological symbols rather than scriptural texts.<br>
<br>That year Thornborough secured the presentation of the next vacant prebend in the cathedral for his son Giles and in 1629 collated his son Edward to the archdeaconry of Worcester. In February 1630 Giles Thornborough recorded the sudden death of his stepmother. The bishop subsequently took a third wife, Anne (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Beswick), widow of Sir Henry Bromley of Holt Castle, Worcestershire.<br>
<br>Always at heart an Elizabethan Calvinist, Thornborough won the good opinion of Richard Baxter, who noted with approval that he never used the sign of the cross in baptism. Yet his one work of theology, <span class="italic">The last will and testament of Jesus Christ touching the blessed sacrament of his body and blood</span> (1630), was perhaps, like his later visitation articles, an attempt to move with the times. His last years were nevertheless overshadowed by an increasingly acrimonious relationship with his chapter and its Laudian dean, Christopher Potter, installed in 1636, as well as by further family scandals. He evidently recognized that Charles I's church was doomed and told the king not long before his death that, while he had outlived several men who had expected to succeed him, he was now afraid that he would outlive the bishopric itself. Among his manuscripts was a plea for unity and peace in the church, <span class="italic">Pax vobis</span>. He returned to an abiding theme in his last published work, <span class="italic">A Discourse &hellip; Advocating the Union of England and Scotland</span> &#145;into one Great Britain&#146; (1641).<br>
<br>Thornborough died at Hartlebury, Worcestershire, on 9 July 1641 and was duly buried in his tomb in Worcester Cathedral. His third wife predeceased him. In his will he provided for the children of his eldest son, Sir John, and his second, Sir Benjamin, who had both predeceased him. He made bequests to Edward and his family, and to the families of his daughters Jane Finch, Anne Smith, and Lady Elizabeth Willoughby. His son Giles, prebendary of Worcester (<i>d</i>. 1663), goes unmentioned. His son from his second marriage, Sir Thomas, already in receipt of a yearly annuity, received only a token bequest. One son-in-law, Francis Finch, was made overseer; another, Emmanuel Smith, his chaplain, witnessed the will.<br>
