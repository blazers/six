<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Story,  John</span>  (1503/4?&#150;1571), <span class="occ">civil lawyer and martyr</span>, was probably born in 1503 or 1504, in Salisbury, Wiltshire, the son of Nicholas Story (<i>d</i>. in or before 1552), and his wife, Joan (<i>d</i>. in or before 1552). He was perhaps connected to the Story family of Northumberland and co. Durham, an association confirmed by his relationship with Richard Norton, who took a namesake into exile after the northern uprising of 1569. His father was wealthy enough to provide him with a good education but the family was not sufficiently established to play a leading role in the affairs of the city.<h2>
<a name="Oxfordprincipalandprofessor15351545"></a>Oxford principal and professor, 1535&#150;1545</h2>Story may have been educated at the cathedral school in Salisbury. He was at Hinksey Hall, Oxford, from about 1530 to 1533, possibly earlier. He graduated BCL in 1531 and DCL in 1538, and was admitted as an advocate to Doctors' Commons the following year. He was a brilliant scholar and was appointed regius lecturer (1535) and professor of civil law (<i>c</i>.1541) at Oxford. This was confirmed for life in 1546 as a reward for his assistance to the lord marshal during the Boulogne campaign. His annual salary was &pound;40 by 1541. He was principal of Broadgates Hall, Oxford, which specialized in law, from 1537 to 1539.<br>
<br>A hostile account associated Story's departure from Oxford with a spell in the university prison, the Bocardo, when he attacked Nicholas Brierton, who was &#145;utterly without weapon&#146;, out of jealousy over a woman, and &#145;ran him thorowe both sydes, &amp; lefte him for dead&#146;  (<span class="italic">Declaration</span>, sig. A3). He certainly had a hot temper but this account is conveniently defamatory and was written shortly after his execution. According to John Ponet the woman in question may have been Margaret Bowyer of Oxford. At all events, by 1549 Story had married Joan Watts (<i>d</i>. in or after 1582). The couple had a daughter, Ellen, a son, John, and reportedly three other children. A more obvious reason for his departure from Broadgates Hall was his appointment as commissary-general to Edmund Bonner, bishop of London. He presided over a lower court than that of the bishop's chancellor. Robert Weston, who had been his deputy, replaced him at Broadgates Hall.<h2>
<a name="Unparliamentarybehaviourandexile15451553"></a>Unparliamentary behaviour and exile, 1545&#150;1553</h2>Story was first elected to parliament for the borough of Salisbury in 1545, apparently after pressure from John Capon (Salcot), bishop of Salisbury. In 1547 he was elected for Hindon, Wiltshire, one of the boroughs of Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester. Story's religious conservatism suited Gardiner&#151;in his will of 1552 Story regretted having taken the oath of supremacy. On 19 November 1548 the privy council confirmed Story as regius professor and ordered his arrears to be paid. Two months later, however, he landed himself in the Tower of London through tactless quotation of Solomon in the debate on the <span class="roman">Uniformity Bill</span>, &#145;Woe unto thee England when the king is a child&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1509&#150;58</span>), a dangerous action during Edward VI's reign. He was the first MP to be sent to prison on the orders of the House of Commons. He was released on 2 March, but John Zouche was elected to his seat instead.<br>
<br>Story retired to Louvain in the Netherlands about 1550. In February 1550 he made over to Sir William Herbert, gentleman of the privy chamber, a lease of the prebend of Tottenhall in St Paul's Cathedral. He continued to receive a salary, paid by the court of augmentations, until 29 September 1550. He was excepted from the king's general pardon in 1552, probably because he was a fugitive. Story made his will at Louvain in May 1552, naming as executor Anthony Bonvisi, the great friend of Sir Thomas More, whom Story called his &#145;second father and fautor of all good Catholic men&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Venice</span>, <i>1555&#150;6</i>, 111). Bonvisi controlled Joan Story's funds as additional insurance against her from returning to England with Story's daughter. Anthony Wood claimed that Story became a Franciscan lay brother&#151;this is unconfirmed, but his will requested burial by the order.<h2>
<a name="Mariannotoriety15531558"></a>Marian notoriety, 1553&#150;1558</h2>After Mary I's accession, Story was reappointed to his Oxford chair jointly with William Aubrey and was restored as commissary-general to Bonner. This second appointment led to his resignation as professor by early 1557. He was elected MP for East Grinstead, Sussex, in October 1553 and for Bramber, in the same county, in April 1554. He probably owed his election to the crown because of the control over these seats exercised through the duchy of Lancaster. His return for Bath in November 1554 and for Ludgershall, Wiltshire, in 1555 was probably due to the influence of Gilbert Bourne, bishop of Bath and Wells, and the earl of Pembroke respectively. Story sat on various committees, including the one in 1553 that decided the protestant Alexander Nowell could not be a member of both convocation and parliament, but in November 1555 he was reported to Mary for opposing the admission of papal licences to England. With Edmund Plowden, the common lawyer, he acted as counsel to John Feckenham, abbot of Westminster, against a bill of February 1558 to restrict the right of sanctuary, and succeeded in causing the bill to fall by the wayside.<br>
<br>Story was appointed chancellor of the dioceses of London and Oxford and JP and of the quorum for Middlesex in 1554. This put him at the forefront of the legal enforcement of the Marian religious reaction. Thomas Martin and he acted as queen's proctors for the trial of Thomas Cranmer, archbishop of Canterbury, at Oxford in September 1555. Cranmer floundered against &#145;two brilliant inquisitors&#146;  (Heinze, 267&#150;9) and Story turned against him his former statements on the royal supremacy.<br>
<br>Story lived in the former house of the grey friars in London. He also bought the lease of the parsonage of Chalfont St Giles, Buckinghamshire, as a family residence. He wrote in June 1555 to Edward Courtenay, earl of Devon, that in London, &#145;the spectacle of this realm&#146;, &#145;the sharpness of the sword, and other corrections, hath begun to bring forth that the word in stony hearts could not do, so that by discreet severity we have good hope of universal unity in religion&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Venice</span>, <i>1555&#150;6</i>, 111). John Foxe wrote of &#145;this bloody Nimrod&#146;  (<span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>, 8.745). This image may have been rather exaggerated&#151;and Foxe had to retract an allegation that Story had burnt a relative&#151;but it was of decisive importance for Story's future. Story was alleged to have claimed to John Philpot &#145;that there hath been yet never a one burnt but I have spoken with him, and have been a cause of his despatch&#146;. Philpot retorted &#145;You have the more to answer for, master doctor, as you shall find in another world, how much so ever you do now triumph of your proceedings&#146;  (ibid., 7.628). Foxe concluded from this that Story was &#145;by hys co[n]fession, the chefest cause and doer, in pursuyng most of the martyrs to death&#146;; &#145;In su[m]ma: Story worsse then Boner&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 109, fol. 52<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>According to Foxe, Story even bragged of devising a heatable iron cage on the Phalaris model to torture heretics to death. He insisted that even &#145;yff the world shuld alter&#146; and if he were &#145;sycke in his bedd&#146;, &#145;yett would he sett up to gyve sentence agaynst an hereti[c], and though he knew yt would turne the next day after&#146;  (<span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>, 7.608). His wife held similar views, according to Thomas Green, a protestant printer, examined by Story at home:<blockquote>Mistress Story flew into a rage, and sware a great oath, that it were a good deed to put a hundred or two of these heretic knaves in a house, &#145;and I myself&#146;, said she, &#145;would set it on fire&#146;. (ibid., 8.522)</blockquote>Catholic bishops were not immune to Story's criticism. In late 1555 he became impatient with Bonner's protracted reasoning with Philpot. When John Christopherson, bishop of Chichester, examined Richard Woodman, Story turned up late and barracked him, saying &#145;Why hear you him? &hellip; My lord, I will tell you how you shall tell a heretic by his words, because I have been more used to them than you have been&#146;  (ibid., 8.340&#150;41).<br>
<br>Story, according to Foxe, ensured prisoners were mistreated. Bonner's coalhouse, with &#145;monstrous and huge stocks&#146;  (<span class="italic">Declaration</span>, sig. B2<i>v</i>), seemed to become a standard recourse. When some youths found with bibles were sent to Bridewell prison to be whipped, Story was the man to see that this was not &#145;lightly handled&#146;  (<span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>, 8.724&#150;5). Perhaps the most famous example is that of the faggot cast in the face of John Denley, while he was being burnt at the stake at Uxbridge, Middlesex, to silence his psalms, an action Story allegedly &#145;impudently&#146; defended in the commons in 1559  (ibid., 8.694). He kept prisoners in his house, but stated that he treated them well and persuaded all but one of twenty-seven or twenty-eight to recant and receive pardons by October 1556. He recognized that it was futile to continue the persecutions and welcomed a halt to the Smithfield burnings in June 1558, &#145;for I saw well that it would not prevail&#146;  (<span class="italic">Declaration</span>, sig. D1<i>r</i>). However, he denied having much control over the general policy of persecution.<h2>
<a name="StoryandElizabethIsaccession15581571"></a>Story and Elizabeth I's accession, 1558&#150;1571</h2>Story was returned as MP for Downton, Wiltshire, a borough controlled by John White, bishop of Winchester, in 1559 and was reprimanded for advising his patron in the House of Lords. In February 1559 there were rumours current that he would be proceeded against for supporting Catholicism. Among Catholics, according to Nicholas Sander, he was praised for defending papal supremacy. This meant presumably his notorious remarks that Mary's persecutors had wasted time &#145;choping at twiggs, but I wished to have chopped at the root, which if they had done, this gere [the Supremacy Bill] had not now come in question&#146;  (<span class="italic">Declaration</span>, sig. B1<i>r</i>). William Fleetwood later noted in 1572 that Story appeared to enjoy more freedom than he had in 1548, not, this time, being immediately imprisoned. But the speech rankled enough to be periodically recalled even after more active treasons were manifest.<br>
<br>Only in May 1560 was Story taken to the Fleet prison, along with Bonner and John Feckenham, &#145;for having obstinately refused attendance on public worship, and everywhere declaiming and railing against that religion which we now profess&#146;  (Robinson, 1.77). Two years later, however, he had apparently escaped, only to be arrested again in the west country. Once the <span class="roman">Act for the Assurance of the Queen's Royal Power</span> (5 Eliz. I c. 1) had made repeated refusal of the oath of supremacy a capital offence, Story was one of the first four Catholics to whom it was proposed to administer it in April 1563. The Spanish ambassador, Alvaro de la Quadra, bishop of Aquila, feared &#145;the great danger the Catholic religion will suffer from the death of these men and still more if from faintheartedness some of them were to take the Oath&#146;. Elizabeth I delayed signing the commission and Story escaped in May, making his way to de Quadra's house. The ambassador denied any foreknowledge of the plan but helped Story to get to the Netherlands  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1558&#150;67</i>, 322&#150;3).<br>
<br>Story later claimed to have &#145;departed this realme freelye licensed therunto by the queene, who accompted mee an abject and castawaye&#146;  (<span class="italic">Declaration</span>, sig. B4<i>r</i>). Elizabeth certainly had not hurried to sign the commission that threatened to condemn him. While in the early months of 1563 the privy council had subjected the Spanish embassy to several raids as a result both of mass-gadders visiting the chapel and of a shooting incident, Story's visit there passed off with surprisingly little fuss.<br>
<br>Story reportedly regretted having lost the opportunity of martyrdom; Sander professed to having, among others, dissuaded him from returning. He lived &#145;adjoining the Charterhouse at Louvain&#146;; allegedly he would have joined the order but, being a married man, needed his wife to follow suit and she &#145;resolutely refused&#146;, so &#145;leading the life rather of a monk than of a man of the world, he frequented the Charterhouse more than his own house&#146;  (Sander, 712&#150;13). This unworldliness was unfortunately undermined by financial pressures, which impelled him to take his fatal position as searcher of ships, primarily for heretical literature.<h2>
<a name="Exileabductionandtrial1571"></a>Exile, abduction, and trial, 1571</h2>In July 1571 Fernando Alvarez de Toledo, duke of Alba, said that Story had &#145;taken an official oath of fealty seven years ago&#146;  (<span class="italic">Epistolario</span>, 2.642). As he was discussing the customs, this might date Story's duties in this field that early; but it also fits Story's matriculation at Louvain on 20 April 1564. A message from Alba to the English government claimed an interest in Story as Philip's &#145;minister or servant &hellip; and equally as a sworn doctor of the University of Louvain&#146;  (Lettenhove, 6.111). At his trial, Story seemingly alleged Spanish naturalization by the Louvain matriculation oath and by the grant of a crown office worth &pound;100 p.a., presumably as searcher  (<span class="italic">Declaration</span>, sigs. B4<i>r</i>, C3<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>English propaganda insisted that Story had been concerned with enforcing Alba's 1569 embargo on English merchandise and hinted that he had enriched himself out of confiscations. Even the early martyrologies admitted the implication. Alba thought the same thing but praised Story as formerly &#145;principal minister of the inquisition in England&#146;, who &#145;behaved with great zeal, not only concerning our holy faith but your majesty's service&#146; while in the Netherlands, undertaking &#145;to discover the deceits committed in passing through goods prohibited by the [embargo] decrees&#146;  (<span class="italic">Epistolario</span>, 2.642). Story's activities made it easy to capture him. John Lee, merchant and intelligencer at Antwerp, recruited Robert Ramsden, Martin Bragge, and Simon Jewkes to acquire a ship, and&#151;critically&#151;William Parker, a Catholic exile employed as searcher under Story, who decided he wanted to go home. Their &#145;practise had beene attempted at Andwarpe and there &hellip; utterly frustrate&#146;  (HMS, <span class="italic">Longleat</span>, 5.225); finally, Parker persuaded Story to go to the quieter port of Bergen op Zoom to search the ship in question. When they boarded, it raised anchor and carried them to Yarmouth on 14 August 1570. Story's obnoxiousness had been such that the shipowners claimed to have acted spontaneously in kidnapping him and presenting him to the surprised English government.<br>
<br>By the end of August 1570 Story was being kept at the house of Thomas Watts, archdeacon of Middlesex. Watts found that Story &#145;playnlie saieth that what he did in Quene Marye's tyme he did it lawfullye &hellip; and if the law were agayn, he might do the like&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/73/53). The government made an ironic point by refurbishing for him the Lollards' Tower, whose &#145;lockes &amp; boltes &hellip; were broken of at the death of Q. Mary&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/73/30). Story was taken to the Tower of London in December; he inscribed &#145;Jhon Store Dr&#146; in the Beauchamp Tower  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 3rd ser., 2, 1857, 199). His presence in the Tower was used to elicit confessions from Catholic conspirators. In April 1571 a courier concerned in the Ridolfi plot, Charles Bailly, was sent there and he was persuaded to recount his role in the conspiracy by somebody impersonating Story, possibly William Herle, although the versatile Parker is more likely. Story was tried on 26 May at Westminster Hall. He denied the court's jurisdication on the grounds that he was a Spanish subject. Despite this a plea of <i>nihil dicit</i> was entered and conviction rapidly followed  (Dyer, fol. 300<i>v</i>). Story expressed a rather anachronistic principle that &#145;every man is free borne, and he hath the whole face of the earth before him to dwell &amp; abyde in wherein he liketh best, and if he cannot lyve here, he may go elswhere&#146;  (<span class="italic">Copie of a Letter</span>, sigs. D2<i>v</i>&#150;3<i>r</i>). Roman law might indeed have influenced Story towards unconsciously contractarian theory, but Tudor convention was shocked by:<blockquote>howe horrible, traytorous, and monstruous a meanyng he had &hellip; by refusyng his naturall allegeaunce to the queene's majestie and this crowne, from which no lawe in the worlde coulde separate hym &hellip; a thyng of itselfe worthy of some monstruous death, accordyng to the monstruousnes of the thyng. (ibid., sigs. C2<i>v</i>&#150;3<i>r</i>)</blockquote>New legislation of 1571 (13 Eliz. I c. 1) confirmed the treasonable nature of stirring foreigners to invade the queen's dominions and of compassing war against her abroad. The judges believed Story was guilty of &#145;constructive&#146; treason. His indictment stressed his association with traitors, including Norton and John Prestall. Prestall had a complex and ambivalent relationship with the English government. It is difficult to tell now to what extent accounts of any of Story's conversations with him are true because most were works of populist propaganda written after the former's death. Prestall supposedly told Story &#145;that he had an art to poyson any body afarre of, beying not present with them, and that none coulde do it but he&#146;  (<span class="italic">Copie of a Letter</span>, sigs. A3&#150;A4). Both men spent more time talking about how to kill James VI than planning an invasion of England but they did discuss using violence or (allegedly) the supernatural against Elizabeth if she would not convert to Catholicism. The Spanish were keen to avoid a renewed trade war, having found to their cost that the embargo hurt their interest more than it hurt the English. The Spanish ambassador, Guerau de Spes, complained about Story's abduction but did not push it. The French ambassador, Bertrand de Salignac de la Mothe-F&eacute;n&eacute;lon, ascribed to Elizabeth a grim jest that she was willing to return Story's head but would keep the rest.<h2>
<a name="Executionandposthumousreputation"></a>Execution and posthumous reputation</h2>During the night before his execution Story was allowed the services of a Catholic priest, his old collaborator and current fellow prisoner, Feckenham. His execution at Tyburn on 1 June 1571 attracted leading peers, courtiers, and privy councillors, including Francis Russell, earl of Bedford, and Henry Carey, Baron Hunsdon, who barracked him on the subject of allegiance. To common spectators were ascribed the inevitable remarks recalling the fate of protestant martyrs. Edmund Campion was said to have attended Story's trial and to have been splashed with his blood at the execution but the latter is a tale told of other martyrs. Story was hanged, drawn, and quartered, and his head was set on London Bridge while his quarters were set on four of the city gates. Understandably, this ordeal was even worse for a man in his late sixties and Story &#145;did not only roare and cry like a helhound, but also strake the executioner doing his office, and resisted as long as strength did serve him, beinge kept downe by three or foure men, until he was deade&#146;  (W. Fulke, <span class="italic">A Retentive, to Stay Good Christians, Against the Motives of R. Bristowe</span>, 1580, 59).<br>
<br>Joan Story received small pensions from Philip and Alba. She went to the English seminary college at Rheims, where her son John was studying for the priesthood, but Cardinal William Allen described her in 1582 as &#145;a woman most poisonous in her tongue, and most unsuited to this place&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Letters and Memorials of William Cardinal Allen</span>, ed. T. F. Knox, 1882, 168). Though Story died more for maintaining allegiance to Philip than to the pope, it was assumed he would become a saint. Robert Horne, bishop of Winchester, and Richard Bristow believed that this would be the case. Story's status as martyr was propagated by his acquaintance with Sander, who wrote about him in his <span class="italic">De visibili monarchia ecclesiae</span> (1571). The 1592 edition of this work inspired Gregorio Pollini's <span class="italic">L'historia ecclesiastica della rivoluzion d'Inghilterra</span> (1594) and Diego de Yepes's <span class="italic">Historia particular de la persecucion de Inglaterra</span> (1599), and helped matters by claiming that Story had denied allegiance to Elizabeth because of her excommunication.<br>
<br>Story's pretensions to change his nationality as a refugee may now seem less &#145;monstrous&#146;. The more lurid plots ascribed to him are of little plausibility and are dwelt on only in the immediate pamphleteering effort, though his reception of the rebel Norton would have probably sealed his fate in any Tudor court. Arguably, &#145;whether or not Dr Story had a hand in murder plots is &hellip; beside the point. He was removed because he was suspected of it, and because he was able, and dangerous&#146;  (Ramsay, 161). He made a useful example to others, a feasible one as he was the exile most likely to board a strange ship. It was an ostentatious demonstration of &#145;amazing lengths &hellip; to destroy a relatively inconsequential enemy&#146;  (C. C. Breight, <span class="italic">Surveillance, Militarism, and Drama in the Elizabethan Era</span>, 1996, 197), and a warning to more important traitors in exile, like Charles Neville, sixth earl of Westmorland. Thirty years on, Catholic exiles such as Sir Robert Basset and Hugh Owen still feared abduction. The trouble taken to apprehend Story testifies to a peculiar obnoxiousness in the eyes of the new regime. Bonner having inconveniently died before the crisis for Elizabethan protestantism which began in 1569 with the northern uprising, Story's execution served as a partial act of exorcism of the past. His notoriety among protestants passed, but he was remembered by the Roman Catholic church. Leo XIII on 29 December 1886 authorized his veneration as a blessed martyr on the grounds of an existing cult. He thereby approved the idea that Story's death arose not from Anglo-Spanish but from religious conflict. Story's beatification was confirmed in 1929 but he was not included among the canonized English martyrs in 1970 because of his zealous persecution of protestants, because he was apprehended by force, and because he tried to defend himself by saying he was a Spanish subject rather than embrace martyrdom.<br>
