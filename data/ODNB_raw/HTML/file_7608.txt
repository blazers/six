<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dickinson,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1756, <em>d.</em> 1822), <span class="occ">antiquary and political manager</span>, was baptized William Dickinson Rastall at St Mary's, Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, on 15 June 1756, the only son of the Revd Dr William Rastall (1724&#150;1788) and his wife, Mary Allgood of Branton, Northumberland. His father, who in 1774 became vicar-general of the chapter of Southwell, Nottinghamshire, suffered from some debilitating physical infirmity, which may be the reason for his son's statement that he &#145;was induced early in life, by concurrence of circumstances somewhat out of the ordinary course, to embark on a tempestuous ocean&#146;  (Dickinson, i). He followed his father to Jesus College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1777 and MA in 1780. He studied law and by 1787/8 was described as &#145;of Lincoln's Inn&#146;. On 6 December 1787 he married Harriot (<i>b</i>. 1767), daughter of John Kenrick, lord of the manor and MP for the pocket borough of Bletchingley, Surrey, with whom he had six surviving children. He became a JP for Nottinghamshire in 1786 and at various dates also for Lincolnshire, Middlesex, Surrey, and Sussex. He published three treatises on the work of a JP in 1815, 1818, and 1822. In 1795 he was bequeathed property in &#145;the north&#146; by a very distant collateral relation, Mrs Henrietta Dickinson of &#145;Eastwood Hoo&#146; in Yorkshire, on the condition of his adoption of the Dickinson surname alone; the bequest was subsequently the subject of litigation. He expanded his Nottinghamshire estates by purchases at North Muskham and Sutton-on-Trent, including the mansion called Muskham Grange in 1789, which he subsequently enlarged and embellished.<br>
<br>Having over a hundred, tenants of his own within the town of Newark, Dickinson was drawn into the bitter political struggles between the ruling &#145;red&#146; party, mainly tenants of the two largest landlords, the dukes of Newcastle and of Rutland, and the independent opposition &#145;blue&#146; party, loosely affiliated to the duke of Portland. By 1790 Dickinson was leader of the blues, although he declined to stand as a parliamentary candidate for either of the two Newark seats in that year on the grounds of ill health. As a moderate he accepted &#145;that if great property united with great rank had a claim to the compliment of <i>one</i> member for the Borough of Newark&#146;, then it was only fair &#145;to prevent the further incroachment on the liberty of the inhabitants&#146; and to oppose the election of a <i>second</i> representative of &#145;those great families who have of late years represented the town&#146;  (<span class="italic">Complete Collection</span>, 40&#150;41). He published two political pamphlets in Newark in 1798 under the guise of &#145;a Nottinghamshire Magistrate&#146;. F. C. Laird, writing in 1812, believed that Dickinson's &#145;liberal character and conduct&#146; had &#145;prevented an overflow of party spirit on more occasions than one&#146;  (Laird, 244).<br>
<br>In 1788&#150;9 Dickinson entered into partnership with a distant cousin, Roger Pocklington, and others as bankers in Newark. However, the partnership was declared bankrupt in 1809. Most of Dickinson's property, including his family home, had to be sold for the benefit of over 3000 creditors; in 1810 he published in his defence a transcript of the proceedings of the commission of bankruptcy. In this he remarked that &#145;storms wholly unlooked for, and from a quarter in which all appeared perfect sunshine, have overtaken me, in which fame, fortune, health &hellip; have been wrecked&#146;  (Dickinson, i).<br>
<br>An additional cause of Dickinson's personal problems was the elopement to Gretna Green in 1807 of his sixteen-year-old daughter Harriot with the nineteen-year-old son of a wealthy Nottingham merchant hosier. The marriage was re-celebrated a month later in Balderton church at Dickinson's instigation &#145;in order to place the couple in the eyes of the world in a respectable situation&#146;  (Nottinghamshire Archives, DD. TB 1/20/3), but his firm's bankruptcy led to protracted legal suits over the marriage settlement. In addition his son-in-law proved a profligate rake, frequently moving around the country to avoid his creditors, and bringing up a family of two legitimate children alongside a second family of nine illegitimate offspring by his housekeeper.<br>
<br>A portrait by Joseph Wright of Derby, possibly of Dickinson as a young boy, shows a figure with his hand resting on a book of topographical drawings. Dickinson's antiquarian interests formed an escape from his personal problems throughout his life. At the age of thirty-one he published his <span class="italic">History of the Antiquities of the Town and Church of Southwell</span> (1787, with later editions to 1819). A companion <span class="italic">History and Antiquities of the Town of Newark</span> followed in 1805&#150;6 (also with later editions until 1819). The 1816 edition was prefaced with the apology for the delay in publication as he had been &#145;overwhelmed with calamities of unusual magnitude&#146;  (Dickinson, <span class="italic">History of Newark</span>, preface). Dickinson died on 13 October 1822 at 10 Cumberland Place, New Road, Middlesex, and was buried ten days later in the family vault in North Muskham church. An obituary appeared in the <span class="italic">Annual Register</span>. Because of the complications with his financial affairs his will was not proved in the province of York until 1843.<br>
