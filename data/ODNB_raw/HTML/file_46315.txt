<span class="headword">Bourke,  Ulick Joseph</span>  (1829&#150;1887), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and writer</span>, was born near Castlebar, co. Mayo, in December 1829. He was educated at Errew monastery, Castlebar, where he was said to have been taught Irish by James Hardiman. He then went to St Jarlath's College, Tuam, co. Galway, and to St Patrick's College, Maynooth, where he was ordained in 1858. He returned to St Jarlath's as professor of Irish, classics, and logic, and remained there for twenty years, thirteen of those as president. During this period, Bourke rebuilt the college and acted as private secretary to his cousin John MacHale, archbishop of Tuam. St Jarlath's received as pupils a number of the sons of men who were important figures in Irish nationalism; they included the sons of Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa, founder-member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, whose fees were paid by Richard Pigott. Bourke's influence as a tutor of young men preparing to enter a seminary, and his teaching of the Irish language and history, were remembered by future members of the Irish Republican Brotherhood. One of his students was Mark Ryan, Fenian and founder-member of the Gaelic League, who calculated that many of his contemporaries at St Jarlath's subsequently became members of the Fenian movement.<br>
<br>In December 1870 Bourke founded the <span class="italic">Tuam News</span>, a weekly paper that aimed to provide &#145;a popular exponent of national and local opinion &hellip;&#146;; it claimed to provide special information about the Roman Catholic church and circulated in Tuam and the province of Connaught. The newspaper had a regular column in Irish, for which Bourke had cast a special fount of type. Bourke also founded the <span class="italic">Keltic Journal and Educator</span> in 1869, but this was short-lived. However, this influenced the publication of <span class="italic">An Gaodhal</span>, a periodical published in Brooklyn, New York, which printed extracts from the <span class="italic">Tuam News</span> and articles by Bourke and John MacHale.<br>
<br>Bourke was a founder-member of the Society for the Preservation of Irish. In his <span class="italic">College Irish Grammar</span> (1856), written while still a student at Maynooth, he said: &#145;The language of a nation is the exponent of a people's antiquity; the index of their refinement; the mouthpiece of their history.&#146; His <span class="italic">Easy Lessons on Self-Instruction in Irish</span> (1867), written at the suggestion of A. M. Sullivan, was published in <span class="italic">The Nation</span> in weekly instalments during the 1860s. This work made Bourke's name known across Ireland and was regarded as a standard treatise on the subject. He was elected a member of the Royal Irish Academy in 1871 for his work on ethnology, which was embodied in his <span class="italic">Aryan Origin of the Gaelic Race and Language</span> (1879). He was critical of the more fanciful theories of some scholars on the origin of the Irish language, and this book and his <span class="italic">Pre-Christian Ireland</span> (1887) are serious attempts to dispel some of these myths. He also wrote a life of Archbishop MacHale.<br>
<br>On his retirement from St Jarlath's in the late 1870s, Bourke became parish priest of Claremorris, co. Mayo. Although he was sympathetic to Fenianism, Bourke was not himself a Fenian, but circumstances of time and place, and his influence as a teacher of the Irish language and history, made it inevitable that he was caught up in the politics of the land war. His founding of the <span class="italic">Tuam News</span> was in part motivated by his drive to give local feelings a voice. He had been influenced by the theories of John Stuart Mill and advocated a peasant proprietary. In 1879, immediately after the meeting in Irishtown, co. Galway, which was the beginning of the Land League, he presided reluctantly at a land meeting in Claremorris, addressed by Michael Davitt. This was the first such meeting to be chaired by a priest and addressed by priests&#151;an important element in the subsequent development of the Land League. Bourke's message was that they should be worthy of the title of free men and should not defy landlords and the government. He wrote a pamphlet addressed to Gladstone on the condition of evicted peasants in co. Mayo (1883).<br>
<br>Bourke died in Castlebar on 22 November 1887 and was buried at Claremorris. At his death he was working on an Irish&#150;English dictionary, which he left incomplete.<br>
