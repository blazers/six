<span class="headword">Stock,  Joseph</span>  (1740&#150;1813), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland bishop of Waterford and Lismore</span>, was born at 1 Dame Street, Dublin, on 22 December 1740 to Luke Stock, a hosier, and his wife, Ann. Having been educated at the Revd John Gast's school in Dublin, in October 1756 he entered Trinity College, Dublin, where he had a distinguished academic career. Awarded a scholarship in 1759 he graduated BA in 1761, MA in 1764, BD in 1771, and DD in 1776; he was also made a fellow of the college in 1763.<br>
<br>An accomplished classical scholar and excellent linguist, Stock published editions of works by Aeschines (1769), Demosthenes (1773), and Lucian (1773) and a life of George Berkeley (1776)&#151;subsequently republished in <span class="italic">Biographia Britannica</span>&#151;that is the only memoir of its subject based on contemporary information. Having taken holy orders he resigned his fellowship in 1779 for the college living of Conwell in the diocese of Raphoe. His publications diminished as a consequence, though he still found time to produce in 1787 an edition of Tacitus and a characteristically temperate endorsement of Bishop Richard Woodward's questioning of Presbyterian loyalty to the constitution, in the form of <span class="italic">A reply to the Rev Dr. Campbell's vindication of the principles and character of the Presbyterians of Ireland</span>. In 1793 he was collated prebendary of Lismore but he resigned this preferment in 1795 to become headmaster of Portora Royal School, Enniskillen. The headmastership was described by one visitor, Le Chevalier de la Tocnaye, as equivalent to a bishopric, and it brought Stock an annual income of about &pound;2000.<br>
<br>In January 1798 Stock was elevated to the episcopal bench as bishop of Killala, in succession to John Porter. He applied himself energetically. In June he and a number of magistrates formed a committee to administer the oath of allegiance to the local Catholic clergy and their congregations. It appeared that the area would escape serious disorder until the unexpected arrival, on 23 August, of a French expeditionary force under General Humbert, while Stock was holding his first episcopal visitation. He was captured and his episcopal residence commandeered as a military headquarters. Things could have been worse. Humbert threatened to send Stock to France when he failed to procure boats and cars for military service, and it was suggested that he should accompany the military as a hostage. Stock was spared this fate and, though his son was chosen instead and the French occupation resulted in his losing goods to the value of &pound;600, both his published and private accounts of his experience betray little evidence of bitterness. Indeed his <span class="italic">Narrative of what Passed at Killala &hellip; during the French Invasion &hellip; of 1798</span> (1800), which was published anonymously, was not only the most authentic published record of what transpired but was also written with an uncommon degree of impartiality. There is little doubt that Stock's decision to stay in the town when he could have fled, combined with his ability to communicate with the French officers in their own language, helped to keep the level of material destruction in the region within bounds, but it would be wrong to conclude that Stock was unaffected by the experience. His diary records his disappointment at the tardiness of the crown forces in delivering protestants &#145;from perpetual pillage and [the] daily and nightly expectation of murder&#146;  (TCD, MS 1690, p. 21) ten days after the French force was defeated at Ballinamuck.<br>
<br>Stock subsequently lost no opportunity to remind his political superiors of his experiences when he sought translation to another see. His request was regarded sympathetically and might well have been favoured in 1801 but for the opposition of the primate, Archbishop William Stuart, who alleged that Stock had entered into fraudulent leases when master of Portora Royal School and was &#145;a man of bad character who resided almost all of last year in England&#146;  (Brynn, 69). Both accusations were palpably unfair but the primate's opposition ensured that Stock remained bishop of Killala until 1810, when he was translated to Waterford and Lismore. He busied himself meanwhile with biblical scholarship. He published editions of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> books of <span class="roman">Isaiah</span> and <span class="roman">Job</span> in 1803 and 1805 respectively. He also endeavoured to promote church reform despite the problems posed by the alienation of glebe land by his predecessors.<br>
<br>Stock married twice. With his first wife, the widow of a Mr Palmer and sister of primate William Newcome, he had several children. She died in 1795 and in the same year Stock married another widow, Mary Obins. His death at Waterford on 13 August 1813 deprived the Church of Ireland of one of its most learned and reasonable voices.<br>
