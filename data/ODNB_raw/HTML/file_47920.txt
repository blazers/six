<span class="headword">Bradshaigh, Sir  Roger</span>, first baronet  (1628&#150;1684), <span class="occ">politician and colliery owner</span>, was born at Haigh Hall, Haigh near Wigan in Lancashire, on 13 January 1628, the eldest surviving son of James Bradshaigh (1598&#150;1631) of Haigh and his wife, Ann, fourth daughter of Sir William Norris of Speke. James Bradshaigh died before his father, whose estate was taken into crown wardship on his death in 1641, passing to Roger in 1649. The Bradshaighs were adamant Roman Catholics: four of Roger Bradshaigh's uncles were Jesuits in the English mission, and a fifth was a Carmelite; two aunts and a sister were nuns at Gravelines and Rouen. However the court of wards and liveries put Roger under the guardianship of protestants John Fleetwood of Penwortham and William Radcliffe of Manchester, and in 1641 he became an Anglican &#145;by his choice, not by his chance&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons</span>). He was entrusted to the earl of Derby, with whose son he was educated in the Isle of Man during the first civil war, when the parliamentarian sympathy of Radcliffe combined with the Bradshaighs' royalism to secure Haigh from any intrusion. In 1647 Bradshaigh married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1695), daughter of William Pennington of Muncaster. They were to have seven children, two of whom survived, including his heir, Sir Roger Bradshaigh, second baronet (1649&#150;1686). Bradshaigh's wife was devoutly Anglican, and &#145;his own religion is such that he is no friend at all to us [Roman Catholics]&#146;  (Nicholas Blundell, quoted in Hawkes, 39), but he was imprisoned at Chester on suspicion of royalist sympathies in 1651. Assurances given to secure his release prevented his joining the earl of Derby's support of the Pretender's invasion, crushed by Lilburne at the battle of Wigan Lane (on the Haigh estate) on 25 August 1651.<br>
<br>Bradshaigh was heavily engaged with the Lancashire commission of forfeited estates on behalf of kinsmen and other local families in the 1650s. Seven of his relatives or wards were threatened with or suffered dispossession, and Bradshaigh organized purchases for some of the latter. In 1660 he was elected to the pre-Restoration parliament, knighted on the accession of Charles II, and appointed a deputy to the earl of Derby as lord lieutenant of Lancashire. A fine soldier, he was an energetic captain of a troop of horse and responsible for reorganizing the county militia. His assiduity in pursuit of &#145;phanaticks&#146; and conventicles balanced Derby's firm action against papists, whom Derby accused Bradshaigh of protecting. Certainly he remained a close friend of a number of prominent Roman Catholics, including Viscount Molyneux of Croxteth, the &#145;popish recusant convict&#146; created lord lieutenant of Lancashire by James II in 1687, appointing twelve &#145;convicted papists&#146; as deputies  (Kenyon MS 611). The duplicity of the Lancashire lieutenancy in the 1660s and 1670s ensured reasonable order in a disaffected county renowned for extreme Catholic and puritan sympathies, continually unsettled by rumoured rebellions and plots. Bradshaigh's role in post-Restoration government was acknowledged in his appointment as high sheriff of Lancashire and to a baronetcy, pursued to indulge his courtier son, in 1679. He was MP for Lancashire from 1660 to 1678, and also served as mayor of Wigan in 1661 and 1681.<br>
<br>Bradshaigh's forebears included notable scholars, poets, and divines. However, although he had a good library and was an enthusiastic correspondent of Lancastrian friends in London, who sent him the latest fashions in books and clothes, Sir Roger was businesslike and practical. He leased a glassworks to John Blackburne of Westby; he had a pottery where John Dwight, who patented porcelain-making processes at the Fulham pottery in 1671 and 1684, worked for a time; and he built the forge and slitting mill which were the embryo of the Haigh ironworks (which, with the colliery, formed the nucleus of the gigantic Wigan Coal and Iron Company in the nineteenth century).<br>
<br>The colliery was the basis of Haigh's other industries and of the estate's fortunes. It was renowned for fuel from the cannel seam, which carried a high premium in the market. The seam was deep, given the current mining technology, and plagued by water and gas. Sir Roger was responsible for bringing it into secure and continuous heavy production, and for establishing Haigh colliery as one of the largest and the longest-worked in Lancashire. He formulated the Haigh colliery orders, which ensured that operations could be systematically supervised and developed and, according to subsequent testimony by the third baronet, he spent &#145;every shilling he could lay his hands on&#146; on the great Haigh sough, which he surveyed and engineered personally  (quoted in Cox, 124). Two-thirds of a mile long and 147 feet below ground at its deepest, this tunnel of 6 feet &times; 4 feet with ten ventilation pits took from 1652 to 1670 to construct and cost a great deal of money. It drained vast coal reserves and provided knowledge (meticulously recorded &#145;for my posterity&#146; in the orders) about many coal seams, including the cannel, &#145;the root, basis and stamina&#146; of Haigh  (earl of Crawford and Balcarres, 19).<br>
<br>Bradshaigh died at Chester on 31 March 1684, and was buried at Wigan. His wife survived him. His heir, the second baronet, died three years later. Despite Sir Roger's heavy capital investment, income from the colliery carried the estate through the deaths without financial jeopardy. Widows' jointures amounting to &pound;660 per annum were paid for many years by his grandson, who by 1729 was drawing an income of &pound;1900 a year from the Haigh estate, over half of which came from the cannel. The sough which made this possible was &#145;the greatest engineering achievement in England down to the building of the Eddystone lighthouse&#146;, according to the twenty-eighth earl of Crawford  (Hawkes, 19). It served collieries in Haigh and Aspull for 300 years until mining ceased, and still runs freely. The three generations of Bradshaighs who followed Sir Roger spent most of their time at court. The male line failed in 1770, when the Haigh estates and businesses passed through an heiress to Alexander Lindsay, sixth earl of Balcarres, in 1780.<br>
