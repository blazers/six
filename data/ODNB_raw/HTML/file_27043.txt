<span class="headword">Taylor,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1554), <span class="occ">bishop of Lincoln</span>, was probably born at the beginning of the sixteenth century, either a nephew or an illegitimate son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27042/', "John Taylor (d. 1534)")</script> of Barton, Staffordshire, who was extensively used by Henry VIII on diplomatic missions. The two Taylors had similar coats of arms. The younger was educated at Cambridge and eventually became DTh in 1538, but had spent some of his time as fellow of Queens' College (1523&#150;37) and proctor for the university (1532&#150;3). He was clearly known at court. He received his first living, that of St Peter Cornhill, London, from the king's physician, William Butts, and was appointed master of St John's in July 1538 by Henry VIII himself. He subsequently said that he owed everything to the king, &#145;he looked for nothing of the gift of any of the bishops&#146;  (Baker, 1.123). In the event, he was to need all the help that the king could give him. He quarrelled with the fellows of St John's, and the bishop of Ely was required to adjudicate as visitor between master and fellows in 1542. It was by grant of the king, to whom by 1543 he was a chaplain, rather than at the gift of John Longland, bishop of Lincoln, that Taylor was made dean of Lincoln early in 1539. Longland had wanted a conservative candidate who would be resident, and had expected the king to agree to his suggestion. He was outwitted. Taylor was inducted by proxy to the deanery on 29 March that year, but was not installed in person until August, and he did not reside in the close or preside at chapter until 1546.<br>
<br>While still master of St John's, Taylor began to make a name for himself as a preacher, though not without unsettling effect. When preaching in London in 1538 in his own church, he was questioned about his views on the sacrament by John Lambert, who had a history of heresy behind him. Taylor asked Lambert to put his views in writing. The result was that Lambert's views were referred successively to Robert Barnes, Cranmer, and Henry VIII, and Taylor was appointed with others to dispute them formally. Lambert was burnt. Taylor in this incident revealed his sympathy with the evangelicals of Lutheran persuasion, but he was clearly prepared to hand over to the stake a man like Lambert, whose sympathies lay with south German and Swiss protestantism. This was not time-serving, because in the following year he was one of two who had the courage in the lower house of convocation to oppose the decision to allow the king and bishops to answer the questions of faith which were ultimately enforced in the six articles; no doubt Taylor took the temperature of the king and house of bishops correctly.<br>
<br>In March 1547, after the death of Henry VIII, Taylor's conscientious dilemmas were to be resolved and his fortunes were to advance notably. He resigned the mastership of St John's, and on 3 March 1549 was presented to the lucrative prebend of Corringham to support his residence at Lincoln. What lay behind his resignation is not wholly clear. It may have been that he was compromised both in the college and at court by the outspoken opinions of a former fellow, Thomas Dobbe, who took issue with clerical celibacy and interrupted a sermon in St Paul's, so giving reforming evangelicals cause to fall out among themselves and a bad name. But it is also apparent that by the time Taylor protested major residence at Lincoln on 13 August 1546, and resided sufficiently to take chapter meetings, his relationship with Dobbe, if not Dobbe's memories of him, were a thing of the past. There was a need for strong leadership among the evangelicals to advance reform. This may have been easier for Taylor to undertake from Lincoln than from an acrimonious and somewhat conservative college in Cambridge. In any event he was well placed to promote change after the king's death, and in 1547 he was appointed a royal visitor for the dioceses of Peterborough, Lincoln, Oxford, and Coventry and Lichfield.<br>
<br>Taylor made no contribution as dean of Lincoln until he took up residence. Thereafter his tenure was marked by very generous grants of decanal property to his friends. The manor of Little Chester was granted to Thomas Smith, secretary to Protector Somerset, in whose house Taylor was eventually to die. The grant was for eighty years, and envisaged an increase in rent after the first five of &pound;1 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. Another grant of the lands of the rectory of Chesterfield was made, to commence in 1587 for fifty-nine years, when neither Taylor himself nor the other members of the chapter would be alive to face the consequences. In effect, the rectory had been granted away well into the next century at the same rent. He gave advowson grants, not just for one term, but always for two. But he was more careful in religious matters. His injunctions to his cathedral church in 1548 required of the chapter that they make sure that scripture was read daily and in the houses of the vicars and choristers, and that a rota for preaching was introduced. He also ordered that the library be checked for its holdings in the early fathers. He required that all anthems be sung in English, and this made his cathedral an obvious testing place for their eventual use. He was among the small group of reformers who helped Cranmer draw up the prayer book of 1549, and then defended <span class="italic">The Supper of the Lorde and the Holy Communion, Commonly called the Masse</span> during the debates about it in convocation and the House of Lords. He was also on commissions to examine Anabaptists, and he seems to have served for a time on the commission to reform the canon law.<br>
<br>Taylor had strong views against the celibacy of the clergy. He is reported when attending convocation in November 1547 to have said &#145;that the prystes of Englande are not votoryes, nor bounde with any vowe of single life, but that they maye frely and with good conscience marry&#146;  (Bailey, 57). It is not certain that Taylor married: he is one of many whose deprivation under Queen Mary was thought to have been due to his marital status, but actually seems to have had more to do with his appointment by letters patent on 13 May 1552 to be bishop of Lincoln, as well as with his views on the sacrament; these had impelled him to walk out of the House of Lords when mass was celebrated in the first year of Mary's reign. In the event he was imprisoned in the Tower on 5 October 1553, and although he was pardoned on 5 January 1554, he was deprived of his see on 20 March on the grounds of the nullity of his consecration and defect of his title.<br>
<br>Taylor's appointment as bishop of Lincoln, and his subsequent consecration on 26 June 1552, preceded the death of Edward VI by a single year, so his reforming zeal as bishop can only be inferred from sparse but significant details such as his appointment of Matthew Parker as dean. His diocesan register does not survive. He was clearly a friend of Thomas Cranmer as well as of his predecessor at Lincoln, Henry Holbeach. Fuller said that he had &#145;the merriest and pleasantest wit&#146;  (Fuller, 2.399); true, maybe, but not for those like Lambert who aroused his antagonism. He died in December 1554 at Ankerwick.<br>
