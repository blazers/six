<span class="headword">O'Kelly,  Patrick</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Bard O'Kelly]</span>  (1754&#150;<em>c.</em>1835), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born in Loughrea, co. Galway. O'Kelly gradually built up a local reputation as a poet in Ireland before publishing his first volume, <span class="italic">Killarney: a Poem</span>, in 1791. Thereafter, his fame rapidly spread and his subsequent volumes were issued by subscription. Admirers, many of whose eulogistic verses found a place in O'Kelly's own volumes, included the future King George IV of England, who, having ordered fifty copies of O'Kelly's second volume, met the poet at Phoenix Park in Dublin, while visiting Ireland. O'Kelly was also later to meet Sir Walter Scott at Limerick in 1825.<br>
<br>Despite having such famous admirers, O'Kelly could not live by subscription alone, and spent much of his life travelling throughout south-west Ireland selling his books. In July 1808, while visiting Doneraile, co. Cork, O'Kelly's watch and chain were, unfortunately, stolen. The mishap, however, led indirectly to his most popular verse, the &#145;Doneraile Litany&#146;, a string of curses in poetic form on the town and its people. O'Kelly made further poetic capital out of the locale, writing a sequel, &#145;The Palinode&#146;, which revoked all the previous curses, when Lady Doneraile herself, on reading the &#145;Litany&#146;, was inspired to replace his property. A less profitable relationship was that of O'Kelly's fellow poet Michael McCarthy, whose popular &#145;Lacas delectabilis&#146; (1816) was, according to O'Kelly, plagiarized from a poem he had earlier written. O'Kelly's other works are equally comic in nature, and include a so-called &#145;ethicographical survey of the Western parts of Ireland&#146;.<br>
<br>O'Kelly died about 1835, and his clever, but often plagiarizing, works, although frequently anthologized, largely fell into disrepute. At the turn of the twentieth century, for example, the esteemed Irish critic D. J. O'Donoghue, although in admiration of O'Kelly's &#145;extraordinary character&#146;, nevertheless characterized his verse as being, without exception, &#145;of a very pedestrian order&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). O'Kelly should not be confused with another Patrick O'Kelly of his era, who published <span class="italic">A General History of the Rebellion of 1798</span> (1842), and translated works by Abb&eacute; McGeoghegan and W. D. O'Kelly.<br>
