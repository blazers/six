<span class="headword">Boteler,  William Fuller</span>  (1777&#150;1845), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 5 January 1777, the only son of William Boteler FSA (1745/6&#150;1818) of Brook Street, Eastry, Kent, and his first wife, Sarah (1747/8&#150;1777), daughter of Thomas Fuller, of Statenborough, Kent, who died shortly after giving birth to him. The family had lived at Eastry for many generations and his father was a collector of antiquarian records relating to Kent. He had five half-brothers who rose to high office in the army and navy, and a sixth who was a clergyman. Boteler was educated under Dr Raine at Charterhouse from 1795. He went on to St John's College, Cambridge, where he was senior wrangler and first Smith's prizeman for 1799; the same year he graduated BA and was elected a fellow of Peterhouse, Cambridge. He proceeded MA in 1802. Admitted a student of Lincoln's Inn on 19 November 1801, he was called to the bar on 23 November 1804 and joined the home circuit; he also practised as an equity draftsman and conveyancer. Though his advancement at the equity bar was slow, he eventually became the leading tithe lawyer of the day.<br>
<br>Boteler attended the quarter sessions in Kent and in 1807 he became recorder of Canterbury; he was subsequently appointed recorder of Sandwich, Hythe, New Romney, and Deal, as well as high steward of Fordwich&#151;posts which he held until his death. He was made a king's counsel in Trinity term 1831, and became a bencher of his inn on 27 May 1831 and treasurer in 1843&#150;4. On 29 November 1808 at Betteshanger in Kent, he married Charlotte (1771/2&#150;1839), daughter of James Leigh Joynes, of Mount Pleasant, near Gravesend; they had three sons (William and Richard, the younger sons, died as infants), and six daughters.<br>
<br>On 16 December 1844 Boteler was appointed senior commissioner of the district court of bankruptcy at Leeds. He died on 23 October 1845 from injuries sustained in a railway accident at Masborough on 20 October 1845.<br>
