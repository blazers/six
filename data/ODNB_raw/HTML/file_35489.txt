<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Peterson, Sir  Maurice Drummond</span>  (1889&#150;1952), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born on 10 March 1889 in Dundee, the younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35490/', "Sir William Peterson (1856&#150;1921)")</script>, classical scholar and educationist, and his wife, Lisa Gibb, eldest daughter of William Ross, shipowner, of Glenearn, Perthshire. He was educated in Canada, after his father's appointment as principal of McGill University, and then at Rugby School and Magdalen College, Oxford, where he took a first in modern history in 1911. He entered the Foreign Office in December 1913, and between then and his retirement in June 1949 he had a varied career as a clerk and diplomatist, and particularly made his mark in Egypt and the Soviet Union and in the Foreign Office in London during part of the Second World War.<br>
<br>The high point of Peterson's early career in the Foreign Office came in May 1917, when he was appointed a member of Arthur Balfour's mission to Washington. Three years later, in January 1920, he was transferred to Washington as second secretary. In February 1921 he was promoted first secretary, and between October 1921 and February 1922 he was attached to the British delegation to the Washington naval conference, as Balfour's private secretary. He returned to London in October 1922, but was transferred to Prague in June 1923. There he acted at various times as charg&eacute; d'affaires. In December 1924 he was transferred to Tokyo, where he made a serious study of the Japanese language, and concluded that the Japanese ruling &eacute;lite was both jealous of and fundamentally hostile towards the British empire. On his return to England he married, on 27 April 1927, Eleanor Angel (<i>b</i>. 1903/4), the second daughter of the Revd Henry William Leycester O'Rorke, rector of Woodstock, Oxfordshire. They had three sons.<br>
<br>Shortly after his marriage, Peterson was transferred to Cairo, still as first secretary. After two years he was moved to Madrid, where he was promoted counsellor in November 1929 and remained until July 1931; he despised his ambassador, Sir George Grahame, admired Alfonso XIII, and witnessed with sadness the passing of the Spanish monarchy, not to be restored during his lifetime. From July 1931 to October 1936 he was head of the Egyptian department in the Foreign Office and was sent out to Cairo for four months in 1934 as acting high commissioner. A mission to Rome in late 1933 to negotiate a border agreement between Libya and the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, which failed in the face of excessive Italian demands, convinced him of Italian enmity to Britain. He was intimately involved in the negotiations surrounding the Abyssinian crisis in 1936, and although he was closely associated with what came to be known as the Hoare-Laval plan to stop the war in Abyssinia, he favoured a hard line against Mussolini during the later stages of the war, including barring the Suez Canal to Italian shipping.<br>
<br>Peterson's first headship of a mission was in Sofia from October 1936 to March 1938, as minister, to be followed by his first embassy, Baghdad, from March 1938 to March 1939. These years involved him in dealings with two royal autocrats: Boris III, for whom he had mixed feelings; and King Ghazi, who exasperated him and whose deposition by Britain he had come to regard as inevitable before Ghazi's death in a car accident accomplished the same purpose. Peterson was appointed KCMG in February 1938, having been made a CMG in January 1933. In February 1939 a meeting of senior officials decided that Peterson should become ambassador to Spain following the end of the civil war, as being &#145;our most energetic man: we hope to organise a regular drive&#151;commercial missions, propaganda, etc&#151;to get Franco over to our side or at least back to neutrality&#146;  (Harvey, 252). This was to lead to a humiliation that would blight the remainder of Peterson's life. His conviction that he was making a success of his mission was not shared by the Foreign Office, which decided in late April 1940 to replace him by Sir Samuel Hoare, bluntly informing Peterson that, in their estimation, he had failed. He spent most of the rest of the war in London, including six months during which the <span class="italic">Foreign Office List</span> described him as &#145;unemployed&#146;, before being placed in charge of the Egyptian, eastern and far eastern departments from January 1942 until September 1944. He worked hard to restore Anglo-American relations over the Middle East, but annoyed some by appearing too ready to endorse American views on the future of Palestine.<br>
<br>From September 1944 until May 1946 Peterson was ambassador to Turkey. In his memoirs, written when Turkey had become a cold war ally, he exaggerated his cordiality to the country. He went to Ankara feeling emotional contempt for Turkish neutrality in the war while understanding the intellectual case for it. In May 1946 Bevin offered him one of the most important embassies, Moscow, while informing him that for humane reasons he would only remain there for two years; it was a city where &#145;you can never have a night out&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diaries of Sir Robert Bruce Lockhart</span>, 532). In this case Peterson's memoirs provided a more reasonable guide to his stewardship. He was not convinced by the very pessimistic briefing about Soviet intentions provided by the Foreign Office before his departure; indeed, he went to Russia full of goodwill and gratitude for its part in defeating Hitler. His spurning in 1948 of the offer of a visit to Stalingrad was, in his words, &#145;a measure of the distance I had traversed since May 1946&#146;  (Peterson, 275). He had become convinced that Russia was not part of European civilization, and that its foreign policy was motivated by militant ideological communism in combination with revived tsarist imperialism. His specific advice could be bad, including the claim in 1947 that Stalin was a &#145;failing force&#146; within the Politburo, and the proposal that the west should launch &#145;political warfare against Communism&#146;  (TNA: PRO, FO 371) at the very time when western governments were trying to make it appear that Russia was sincerely being offered Marshall economic aid and was spurning the offer. Health troubles in the form of heart disease resulted in his retirement in June 1949. Afterwards he served on the board of the Midland Bank and wrote a volume of memoirs. He had been promoted GCMG in 1947.<br>
<br>Peterson's characteristics may be summarized under seven headings. The first was real eccentricity, exemplified by his use of dog biscuits for the cheese course when he was entertaining the foreign secretary in Moscow in 1947. The second was a high degree of touchiness and an inability to set aside a slight, especially if it emanated from the Foreign Office. This produced, third, a feeling of being in the Foreign Office but not of it. Fourth, he enjoyed exercising power and regretted that only once, in Egypt in 1934, was he able to bring about an important political change in the country to which he was accredited. Fifth, he was a passionate imperialist, a characteristic which, during the 1930s, caused him to regard Italy as a greater threat than Germany. Sixth, he could admire democracy abroad, as in Czechoslovakia in the 1920s, but saw no reason to object to autocracies &#145;so long as they did not become mere organisations for war&#146;  (Peterson, 42). Finally, he was a strong protestant and was convinced, <i>inter alia</i>, that intrigue by pro-Franco Anglo-Catholics had been an important factor in his recall from Madrid. He died at his home, Inglewood Lodge, Kintbury, Berkshire, on 15 March 1952.<br>
