<span class="headword">Cope,  Alan</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1578), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic ecclesiastic</span>, gave his origin as the diocese of London. He was educated at Magdalen College, Oxford; he matriculated in 1549, he received the degree of MA in 1552, and was unanimously chosen senior proctor of the university in 1558. He then studied civil law and graduated BCL in 1560, being &#145;esteemed for his great erudition&#146;  (Gillow, <span class="italic">Lit. biog. hist.</span>, 1.561). Some time after this, realizing that he would no longer be permitted to practise his Roman Catholic faith openly, he resigned his preferments and fled to Flanders. In 1561 his name appears, annotated as &#145;late scholar of Oxford&#146;, in a list of &#145;Recusants which are abroad and bounde to certayne places&#146; signed by Bishop Grindal of London and others. He entered the university at Louvain, where he matriculated in 1563, and he was still known to be in Flanders in February 1570. In 1566 he allowed his name to appear as author of the Antwerp-published <span class="italic">Dialogi sex contra summi pontificatus</span>, an attack on Bishop Jewel and others that had, in fact, been written by Nicholas Harpsfield during his imprisonment in the Tower of London. This subterfuge was to avoid further aggravation of Harpsfield's situation in England.<br>
<br>By 1570 Cope was in Rome and was ordained to the diaconate in the Lateran basilica by Bishop Goldwell on 23 December. There remains no record of his priestly ordination. He continued his studies, gaining doctorates in divinity and canon law and in 1572 published at Louvain his <span class="italic">Syntax historiae evangelicae</span>&#151;a life of Christ taken from the accounts of the evangelists. In 1576 he is listed for the first time as having rooms in the English Hospice, which was three years later to become the English College. In 1577 and 1578 he is also listed as one of the two <i>camerarii</i> (&#145;councillors&#146;) of the hospice. Pope Gregory XIII appointed him a canon of St Peter's and his finances were further augmented by a pension of 40 florins a year provided by Jane, the English-born duchess of Feria. He died at Rome in 1578 and was buried in the chapel of the English Hospice. The exact date of his death is uncertain. The college celebrated his anniversary with an annual mass on 16 June, while the Douai diaries record receiving news of his death on 14 October. He left his books to the English Hospice in Rome, and a number of volumes inscribed with his name are still to be found on the shelves of the college's library. He is recorded as &#145;leaving behind him a most admirable exemplar of virtue, which many did endeavour to follow, but could not accomplish their desires&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 1.456).<br>
