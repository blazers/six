<span class="headword">Toler,  John</span>, first earl of Norbury  (1745&#150;1831), <span class="occ">judge and politician</span>, was born at Beechwood, co. Tipperary, on 3 December 1745, the youngest son of Daniel Toler (<i>d</i>. 1754&times;6) and Letitia Otway (<i>d</i>. 1794), the Tolers being a Cromwellian family who came originally from Norfolk. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated BA in 1761 and MA in 1766. Admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 19 March 1761 he was called to the bar in Michaelmas 1770. On 2 June 1778 Toler married Grace (<i>d</i>. 21 July 1822), daughter of Hector Graham; they had two sons and two daughters. His father, on his deathbed, was said to have given him a case of silver mounted pistols and charged him &#145;never to omit the valour of an Irish gentleman in resorting to his weapons&#146;  (Sheil, 85&#150;6). Whatever may have been the truth of that story Toler certainly demonstrated throughout his career a readiness to challenge those with whom he clashed to a duel.<br>
<br>Toler's political career began in 1776, when he was returned to the Irish House of Commons as MP for Tralee. He made clear his support for the government from the beginning and was duly advanced in his profession to the rank of king's counsel in 1781. In 1783 he was returned for the borough of Philipstown in King's county, his elder brother Daniel (<i>d</i>. 1796) having been returned at the same time for Tipperary. He represented Gorey, East Wexford, from 1790 to 1800. Toler was vehement in his opposition in parliament to the proposals for reform urged by Grattan and others, which included their proposals for the relaxation of the laws against Catholics. He was further rewarded for his loyalty to the government on 12 August 1789, when he was appointed solicitor-general. One of his first actions in post was to oppose a motion by Grattan deprecating the sale of places and peerages by the viceroy.<br>
<br>Toler was a jovial figure, on the short side and increasingly corpulent, with a ribald and sometimes seriously misplaced sense of humour. He was also remarkably belligerent, even by the parliamentary standards of the era. In 1792 he in turn was challenged, by James Napper Tandy, secretary of the United Irishmen, to a duel which never took place, Tandy being imprisoned for contempt by the Commons. Tandy was notoriously ugly and, commenting on his election as secretary, Toler said that it was odd that they had been unable &#145;to set a better <i>face</i> on the matter&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), a characteristic example of the wit for which Toler was renowned.<br>
<br>Toler fell out of favour with the government when the liberal-minded Earl Fitzwilliam became viceroy in 1794, but the prime minister, William Pitt, only agreed to his being removed from the post of solicitor-general on the condition that another place would be found for him. Fitzwilliam was recalled after spending less than two months in Dublin, Toler's fortunes were restored, and his zealous denunciations of measures for Catholic relief handsomely rewarded. His wife was created a peeress of Ireland in her own right on 7 November 1797 with the title of Baroness Norwood of Knockalton, co. Tipperary; on 10 July 1798 Toler was appointed attorney-general, and he was sworn of the privy council on 2 August.<br>
<br>During and after the rising of 1798 Toler conducted some of the most important prosecutions in person with a ferocity which was unusual even by the standards of the time. In the most celebrated of the trials with which he was concerned, that of the brothers Sheares, his efforts to secure a conviction were helped by the fact that one of the counsel appearing for the brothers, Leonard McNally, was secretly in the pay of Dublin Castle and had disclosed one of the defence's legal strategies to Toler and his team, who were thus well prepared with their replying arguments. When the case had been at hearing for over fifteen hours one of the defence counsel, John Philpot Curran, who was described as &#145;fainting with exhaustion&#146;, pleaded for an adjournment, which was successfully opposed by Toler. The brothers were convicted and executed the following day, and Toler's anxiety that the sentence should be carried out as quickly as possible may have been due to his concern that the lord chancellor, Lord Clare, might be disposed to extend clemency to the brothers.<br>
<br>In the aftermath of the rising Toler was responsible for legislation which gave the viceroy a discretionary power to suspend the <span class="roman">Habeas Corpus Act</span> and establish martial law. These services and his support for the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> in 1800 led to his appointment as chief justice of the court of common pleas on 20 December 1800. He was elevated to the peerage as Baron Norbury of Ballyorenode, co. Tipperary, nine days later.<br>
<br>Toler had a poor reputation as a lawyer. As an advocate his style blended buffoonery with portentous gravity. These features of his personality moved Lord Clare to his reported comment: &#145;Make him a bishop or an archbishop but not a judge&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Such misgivings as to Toler's fitness for office were amply justified by his conduct on the bench. His liking for coarse humour and his constant altercations with leading counsel, notably O'Connell, resulted in his court's frequently being crowded to capacity. His jocular approach was even evident when those before him were being sentenced to death. One contemporary account said contemptuously that his performances &#145;were greatly preferred, in the decline of the Dublin stage, to any theatrical exhibition&#146;  (Sheil, 97). It was not suggested that he was corrupt in the ordinary sense. In civil suits, however, he almost invariably found for the plaintiff and this was attributed by his critics to the fact that, at that time, the judge and the registrar were paid an additional fee if there was a decree in favour of the plaintiff. There were reported to be two bags underneath Norbury's desk, one of silver coins for himself and one of copper coins for his registrar.<br>
<br>As it happened, in the most celebrated trial over which he presided, that of Robert Emmet, Norbury was not at his worst. Before reaching his famous peroration&#151;&#145;let no man write my epitaph&#146;  (Phillips, 359&#150;61)&#151;Emmet had sought to justify his leadership of the abortive foray in the streets of Dublin in terms which the judges were bound to regard as treasonable. Yet he was given considerable latitude by them and when Norbury eventually intervened he did so in reasonably measured terms. He expressed the concern of the judges that the 26-year-old Emmet, whose father had been physician to the viceroy and whose elder brother, Christopher, had been a most highly regarded member of the Irish bar until his early death, should have been associated in so desperate an enterprise, and his dismissive comment on Emmet's followers as lower class riff-raff is hardly surprising for its time. It has even been said, although there is no authoritative confirmation of the suggestion, that he was moved to tears by Emmet's plight as he passed the death sentence.<br>
<br>The most serious threat to Norbury's continued tenure of office resulted not from his behaviour in court but from the discovery and publication of a letter sent to him some years previously from William Saurin, then attorney-general. In the letter Saurin had urged Norbury, when travelling on circuit, to encourage in private the members of the grand juries to resist the campaign for Catholic emancipation. The letter was found on Ormond Quay in Dublin by a young Catholic attorney and then came into O'Connell's possession. The latter wrote indignantly to Earl Grey, the prime minister, that the letter was &#145;clear evidence of a conspiracy to pervert the judicial character into an engine of calumny and bigotry&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Daniel O'Connell</span>, 2.402). O'Connell enlisted the support of Henry Brougham, then a member of the House of Commons, in raising the matter there but it was brushed aside by the chief secretary for Ireland, Sir Robert Peel, who said that he thought the manner in which the letter was published baser than its contents. Norbury was infuriated by Brougham's actions and was reported to have said: &#145;I will resign to demand satisfaction. That Scottish Brougham wants to be made acquainted with an Irish stick&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>)&#151;another fair sample of the excruciating puns on which Norbury's reputation as a wit apparently rested. The chance finding of the letter on Ormond Quay was said to have been the result of Norbury having put it, along with other papers, in the stuffing of an armchair that had been sent to be upholstered, but this may be apocryphal.<br>
<br>Although he survived that episode Norbury's behaviour on the bench led to increasing pressure for his removal. In 1825 O'Connell presented a petition to parliament calling for his removal on the ground that he had fallen asleep during a murder trial and was unable to give any account of the evidence when his notes were called for (he was then aged eighty). Again Norbury survived but when Canning became prime minister in 1827 he was at last induced to retire. However, his departure was smoothed by his advancement in the peerage as Viscount Glandine and earl of Norbury, together with a retiring pension of &pound;3046. These titles were created with a special remainder in favour of Norbury's second son, Hector John (<i>d</i>. 1839), in consequence of the poor mental health of his eldest son, Daniel (<i>d</i>. 1832), second Baron Norwood in succession to his mother and later second Baron Norbury. O'Connell, in his private correspondence, described the departing chief justice as &#145;a sanguinary buffoon&#146;, who had been &#145;bought off the bench by a most shameful traffic&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Daniel O'Connell</span>, 3.323).<br>
<br>In private life Norbury was an amiable person, given to singing and declaiming poetry; he knew much of Shakespeare and Milton by heart. He was also reputed to be an excellent landlord and a kindly and thoughtful employer. In contrast O'Connell regarded Norbury's behaviour as a judge as symptomatic of the worst features of the post-Union Irish judiciary. It was not simply that his hostility towards Catholic emancipation remained undiminished; even in an age when there was a more relaxed attitude towards idiosyncratic behaviour by judges Norbury was conspicuous for his eccentricity. He died at Cabra, near Dublin, on 27 July 1831.<br>
