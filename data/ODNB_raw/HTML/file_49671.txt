<span class="headword">Caxton,  Jeremy  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1249), <span class="occ">sheriff and justice</span>, was probably a relative of Geoffrey of Caxton, a knight active in Cambridgeshire affairs in the 1230s and 1240s, perhaps a younger brother or cousin. Both took their name from the Cambridgeshire village of Caxton, where Jeremy was granted an estate by Geoffrey's sister Amphelisa and her husband in 1247, soon after Geoffrey's death. He was active by 1219, when he was the attorney of Geoffrey of Hatfield in a case in the bench. The early part of his career was apparently spent in administrative work in Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire, under Hatfield. The latter was sheriff of the two counties from 1224 to 1232; by 1231, and probably earlier, Jeremy was serving him as clerk or under-sheriff, and succeeded him as sheriff in 1232. He remained in office until 1236, although from later in 1232 until his fall in 1234 the titular sheriff was Peter de Rivaux, who held the same position in many other counties. After leaving office Caxton served as keeper of the temporalities of the bishopric of Norwich from 1237 to 1239, as well as performing other duties for the king, and then in 1240 served as a junior justice on the Norfolk eyre under William of York, Henry of Bath, and Roger of Thinkleby. Later that year he made an exhaustive inquiry into the chattels and debts of Jews in many counties in eastern England, before becoming a justice in the court <i>coram rege</i> early in 1241, possibly because of the ill health of Stephen of Segrave, who may have chosen him, since his interests in Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire probably meant that Caxton was known to him.<br>
<br>Despite minimal previous judicial experience, Caxton continued as a justice there until his death, as one of the most senior judges in England, and with only a few short absences to undertake other government work. The latter included the keepership of the archbishopric of Canterbury, further Jewish and some forest inquiries, and some assize commissions, mainly in Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire. William of York and later Henry of Bracton and Henry de la Mare were his regular colleagues in the court, and he also held a London eyre in 1244 with York and Bath. An ordained clerk, the benefices he is known to have held were the Ramsey Abbey living of Warboys in Huntingdonshire, which he acquired in 1237; East Dereham in Norfolk, a rich living of the bishopric of Ely, which he held by 1245; and Godmersham in Kent, a church of Christchurch Priory, received in 1241. He is not known to have had any higher ecclesiastical ambitions, nor indeed to have attempted to acquire more extensive estates. He died in late November or early December 1249. In his obituary Matthew Paris described him as &#145;the king's special counsellor&#146;  (Paris, 5.94), but significantly did not credit him with being especially learned in the law, as he did several other senior judges.<br>
