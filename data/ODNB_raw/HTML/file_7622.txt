<span class="headword">Dickson,  William Gillespie</span>  (1823&#150;1876), <span class="occ">advocate and legal writer</span>, was born on 9 April 1823, the second son of Henry Gordon Dickson, writer to the signet in Edinburgh. He was educated at the Edinburgh Academy and at Edinburgh University, and destined for the legal profession. On 9 March 1847 he was admitted a member of the Faculty of Advocates. He practised at the bar of the supreme court of Scotland in Edinburgh for some years. His success as an advocate was moderate, leaving him time, during his first years of practice, to prepare <span class="italic">A Treatise on the Law of Evidence in Scotland</span>, the first edition of which was published in July 1855. The work had immediate success. A second edition was published in 1864.<br>
<br>In July 1856 Dickson accepted the office of procureur and advocate-general of Mauritius, where he remained for the next ten years and was greatly liked. In 1867, on account of the failing health of his wife, he obtained leave of absence, and while in Britain in 1868 he was offered by Sheriff Glassford Bell, then sheriff-principal of Lanarkshire, the office of sheriff-substitute in Glasgow. Dickson accepted the post, and on Sheriff Bell's death in 1874 he succeeded him as sheriff-depute (or principal sheriff) of the county. He was installed on 21 January 1874, and in April 1874 he received the honorary degree of LLD from Edinburgh University.<br>
<br>In Glasgow as in Mauritius Dickson made himself a general favourite, with a reputation for diligence. His reputation rested, however, on his <span class="italic">Treatise on the Law of Evidence</span>, which was republished by John Skelton (2 vols., 1864) and P. J. Hamilton Gierson (2 vols., 1887); it was for long the standard work. Dickson's amiability and geniality made him popular in private life. He died suddenly on 19 October 1876, and was survived by his wife, Mary Clementina Dickson, formerly Tytler.<br>
