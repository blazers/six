<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lockhart,  George, of Carnwath</span>  (1681?&#150;1731), <span class="occ">Jacobite politician and memoirist</span>, was the elder of two children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16901/', "Sir George Lockhart of Carnwath (c.1630&#150;1689)")</script>, lord president of the court of session, and his second wife, Philadelphia (<i>b</i>. 1655, <i>d</i>. in or after 1717), daughter of Philip, fourth Baron Wharton. His father was a successful lawyer and state servant who was murdered as he left Greyfriars Kirk on 31 March 1689. Lord Wharton intervened soon afterwards to have Lockhart's episcopalian tutor removed, and sent George and his brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16906/', "Philip Lockhart")</script>, to be educated in the household of Archibald Campbell, tenth earl and later first duke of Argyll, with whose sons, John (later second duke of Argyll) and Archibald (later earl of Ilay and third duke of Argyll), he formed a lifelong friendship. His mother, meanwhile, contracted a secret marriage with John Mair, a former army officer who later turned out to be a bigamist, and subsequently married John Ramsey, son of the former bishop of Orkney, who, with one of Lockhart's guardians, James Lockhart of Cleghorn, embezzled substantial sums from their ward's estate. These experiences apparently estranged him from his mother. In 1695 George exercised his right under Scottish law to choose his own guardians and effectively took control of his estate. One of his first acts was to negotiate his marriage to Euphemia Montgomery (1678?&#150;1738), ninth child of Alexander, ninth earl of Eglinton, which was contracted on 13 April 1697. The marriage was apparently an affective one despite Euphemia's notorious pride and bad temper, and they had fifteen children, of whom eleven survived to adulthood. George managed his estates very ably and was a noted agricultural improver, as well as a modernizer of his main residence of Dryden in Edinburghshire. He also energetically exploited the coal on his estates and was one of the first Scottish mine owners to introduce a steam engine to pump water out of his coal pits. A haughty man assertive of his rights, he was neither an easy neighbour nor a popular landlord. None the less, his astute stewardship pushed the family's income up to &pound;3750 per annum by the 1720s, placing them in the top echelon of Scotland's landed &eacute;lite in terms of wealth. By 1700, if not earlier, he had also ceased to attend the kirk and become a committed episcopalian, inclining toward the anti-innovatory (later anti-usager) wing of that church.<br>
<br>Lockhart's ideological beliefs revolved around his conception of himself as a quintessential Scottish patriot; his Jacobitism flowed from his belief that only a Stuart restoration could secure Scotland's independence and put the Scottish nation back in charity with God. Throughout his political career he correspondingly pursued both the return of the exiled dynasty and (from 1707) the restoration of Scotland's independence as though they were one. In the 1702 election he successfully stood as one of the commissioners for Edinburghshire, and was appointed a Scots privy councillor through the influence of his uncle Thomas, fifth Baron Wharton, one of the leaders of the English whig party. In spite of this he increasingly voted against the court in the Scottish parliament and aligned himself with the cavalier (Jacobite) party and the second duke of Hamilton. In December 1704 he was correspondingly dropped from the new commission of the privy council. In 1705, however, his uncle's influence secured him a place on the Scots commission nominated by Queen Anne to negotiate the treaty of Union. Lockhart only reluctantly accepted in order to supply his political allies with information on its deliberations. During the last session of the Scottish parliament he spoke and protested frequently against the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span>, and by November 1706 was actively involved in conspiracies to oppose it by force. When these came to nothing he retired to his estates and busied himself with horse-racing, hunting, and drafting his <span class="italic">Memoirs Concerning the Affairs of Scotland</span>, an account of Scottish politics from 1703 to 1708. Despite Hamilton's tergiversations over the Union, Lockhart remained attached to him and was involved in the Hamilton's party's preparations for a Scottish uprising to support the abortive French invasion of 1708. When it failed he escaped imprisonment only through the intervention of Lord Wharton, by then one of Queen Anne's senior ministers.<br>
<br>In 1708 George successfully stood for Edinburghshire in the first elections to the British parliament and was one of only four Scottish MPs to align themselves with the tory minority at Westminster. Returned again in 1710, he was chosen by the Scots tories to represent them on the commission of accounts established by tory back-benchers in 1711 to expose graft and corruption under the previous whig ministry. Lockhart was a conscientious commissioner and fell out with several former allies as a result. He also played a leading role in lobbying English tory peers to vote in favour of the appeal by James Greenshields, an Episcopalian minister, against a sentence imposed by a kirk session in 1711, and in securing the passage of the <span class="roman">Episcopalian Toleration and Restoration of Patronages Acts</span> of 1712. By then Lockhart had established himself as a leader in his own right among the more extreme Jacobite Scottish tories, though he remained personally attached to the duke of Hamilton until his death. In that year Lockhart also first tried to organize an explicitly Jacobite group among the back-bench tories. Though he failed on this occasion, he was increasingly recognized as an important friend by the exiled Stuart court, and was considered for a peerage there in 1713. During the malt tax crisis of that year Lockhart, despite being threatened with imprisonment in the Tower of London by the ministry, sought to use the anger felt by Scottish MPs and peers on the issue to bring on the repeal of the Union, and led a breakaway group in attacks on government legislation in the Commons to support moves to this end in the Lords. He was eventually restrained by instructions to support the ministry from the Jacobite court. Returned again for Edinburghshire in the 1713 election, he refused to align himself with either the Oxford or the Bolingbroke factions struggling for control of the tory party in 1714, and instead tried to exploit the crisis created by the queen's declining health to bring about a Jacobite restoration. He obviously did not achieve this, but, together with Sir John Pakington, MP for Worcestershire, did succeed in drawing together an explicitly Jacobite club of politicians with this as their objective. At this point, however, Sir David Dalrymple of Hailes, a whig and long-standing political enemy, obtained a copy of Lockhart's draft <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>. George had loaned his manuscript to John Houston of Houston jun. who, without consulting him, arranged for it to be transcribed. The copyist then made an extra copy which he eventually sold to Dalrymple, who published it. Lockhart's acerbic character sketches, sedition, and indiscretions in the <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> alienated friend and foe alike, and he was shunned by his former comrades throughout the election campaign which followed the death of Queen Anne, though he was ultimately never prosecuted because of the difficulty in proving a connection between the illicit copy on which the published version was based and his original text. Facing certain defeat at the poll in 1715, he withdrew at the last minute and thereafter devoted himself to estate management, memoir writing, and Jacobite conspiracy.<br>
<br>Lockhart was consequently soon engaged in the preparations that preceded the 1715 rising, and, more owing to his public notoriety than his prominence in the Jacobites' plans, was one of the first to be arrested on 18 August. His friendship with the commander-in-chief in Scotland, the second duke of Argyll, secured his release on bail on 2 September, and he immediately resumed his plotting for a rising in the southern lowlands to take place when the Jacobite army at Perth advanced southwards. This resulted in his re-arrest on 13 October when William Mackintosh of Borlum's Jacobite force crossed the Forth, though Lockhart's brother Philip had by that time already led a troop of former officers, servants, and tenants out from Carnwath to join Viscount Kenmuir's rising at Moffat. George was then imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle until mid-January 1716, during which time he became seriously ill, and was released at the behest of the earl of Ilay.<br>
<br>Lockhart was once more involved in Jacobite plotting by the summer of 1716, but his experiences in 1715&#150;16 and the execution of his brother after the surrender at Preston henceforth made him so cautious about undertaking further attempts without substantial foreign support that he effectively contributed to the sabotaging of the Earl Marischal's rising of 1719 and aborting the projected campaigns of 1726 and 1727. Even so, with most of the leaders of the Scottish Jacobites imprisoned or in exile, he was one of the few active &eacute;lite Jacobites left, and so quickly became a recognized leader in the Jacobite underground. In 1720 he suggested that James Stuart, the Old Pretender, appoint a committee of trustees to oversee his affairs in Scotland. This was done and Lockhart became its <i>de facto</i> secretary. His main tasks were laying the groundwork for a future rising by fomenting popular discontent with the Union, for example after the Shawfield riots, and trying to keep the peace between rival Jacobite and Episcopalian factions, though he also played a leading role in Scottish tory efforts to negotiate an alliance with either the Argathelians or the squadrone to return tory candidates in the representative peers election of 1722. George tried to avoid becoming aligned with any of the numerous factions that plagued the Jacobite movement at this time, but his efforts to contain their rivalries were hampered by both their intransigence and his own gathering weariness of the twilight world of Jacobite conspiracy. This was further catalysed by Lockhart's distress at the very public quarrel between the Old Pretender and his wife, Clementina Sobieska, and correspondingly eased his passage out of active Jacobitism. This was finally occasioned by the interception of letters from the exiled court directed to him (possibly as a result of indiscretions by those opposed to him in concurrent disputes between usagers and anti-usagers in the Scottish Episcopalian community), followed by the capture of one of his couriers in March 1727. Forewarned by whig friends of his imminent arrest, Lockhart fled to the continent. There he was invited to take up a post at the exiled court, but declined and instead effectively severed his connections with the Jacobite cause by writing a scathing critique of the Old Pretender's conduct, which he directed to him personally.<br>
<br>Allowed to return to Britain in 1728 at the intercession of Argyll and Ilay, Lockhart spent the next three years putting the finishing touches to his memoirs. These were written up at different times in three books: the <span class="italic">Memoirs Concerning the Affairs of Scotland</span>; the <span class="italic">Commentarys of George Lockhart of Carnwath</span>, which covers the period 1708 to 1715; and <span class="italic">A Register of Letters twixt the King and George Lockhart of Carnwath</span>, which deals with 1716 to 1728. None was intended for publication within his lifetime, and all deal sharply with the politics and many of the personalities of the period. None the less, they have been found to be surprisingly accurate in almost all respects, and thus constitute one of the best sources for the politics of the era. All three were hidden after Lockhart's death, and came to light only in the early nineteenth century when the antiquary Anthony Aufrere, the husband of one of his descendants, published them in two volumes in 1817.<br>
<br>Lockhart died at his house in Niddry's Wynd, in Edinburgh, on 17 December 1731 as a result of wounds received in a duel fought on or about 14 December. The cause was not publicly known and his family kept it so secret that historians have no idea of its cause or the identity of his assailant. According to his wish, he was interred in the family vault at Carnwath. Euphemia survived him by seven years, but nothing is known of her life beyond 1731.<br>
