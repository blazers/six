<span class="headword">Griffiths,  Vincent Llewellyn</span>  (1902&#150;1984), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born on 18 January 1902 at the rectory in the village of Bix, Oxfordshire, the first of three children of James David Griffiths, rector of Bix, and his wife, Olive Arnold Chataway. He was educated at Denstone College (1916&#150;20) and at Keble College, Oxford (1920&#150;23), where he took a degree in history. From 1924 to 1928 he taught at St Andrew's College, Gorakhpur, India. Here he began to assimilate Gandhi's ideas about a practical, village-based education. In 1926 he made an adventurous journey into Tibet, walking with a cook-companion for 200 miles on the &#145;forbidden&#146; Lhasa road.<br>
<br>Back in England, Griffiths took a diploma in education at the London Day Training College, and in 1929 was appointed an education officer in the service of the Sudan government. He started as a teacher in the old Gordon College, Khartoum, still the country's main secondary school. It was an effective but stuffy institution, though twenty years later it blossomed into a fine university. At that time the Sudan government was unenterprising in its educational plans, which were adequate only to serve the general policy of indirect rule. This built on existing traditional tribal structures and was effectively supervised by district commissioners. It was a cheap, conservative system requiring only a few educated Sudanese officials to serve in it. When the 1929 slump came belts were tightened but there were still voices calling for more and better education.<br>
<br>Griffiths and one or two others&#151;notably G. C. Scott, Arabist and former district commissioner, and later &#145;Abdel Rahman &#145;Ali Taha&#151;saw that the policy of devolving power to tribal chiefs could be turned to advantage. Many chiefs had young relatives who needed more than limited local schooling. Griffiths saw that if a rural college could be created to meet this need it could also be used to spearhead a much wider reform: to free education from the domination of rote learning and from a discipline of fear. Teachers would be needed whose competence derived from integrity, understanding, and active skills, as well as from book learning.<br>
<br>In 1934 Griffiths and colleagues started their new educational centre in a few thatched huts and classrooms near Ed Dueim, a market town by the White Nile, 130 miles south of Khartoum. From this small beginning grew the famous educational village of Bakht al-Ruda, eventually Sudan's Institute of Education. For fifteen years Griffiths was principal. He had qualities of vision and pragmatism, spiced with a certain humorous guile, which enabled him to make small opportunistic gains but which also earned him a reputation for being favoured by the authorities. He recalled that it all took longer than they had hoped:<blockquote>We came to the task thinking of it mainly as a matter of improving a teacher's general education and &hellip; methods of teaching &hellip; It was only gradually that our eyes were opened and we began to realise the implications of a fact that had been staring us in the face. <i>There were no books</i>. It was useless to urge anything better than rote learning if the bare facts could not be clothed in enlivening detail. (Griffiths, <span class="italic">Teacher Centred</span>, 9)</blockquote>Griffiths's understanding of what was involved in becoming a teacher in a poor country came more and more to be shaped by the insight that a teacher's competence grows in and around the &#145;tools&#146; and materials of the craft. He worked from an understanding of apprenticeship, equipping both teacher and pupils with a basic tool kit of books, visual aids, and materials&#151;all experimentally and frugally designed. The first book produced at Bakht al-Ruda was a well-illustrated, witty, thoroughly tested Arabic reader for children. Many of the younger teachers soon realized just how much they needed this kind of teaching aid. Traditionalists remained sceptical. Griffiths was also making converts at a higher level. Douglas Newbold, soon to be head of the civil service, and Christopher Cox, the new, enterprising director of education, began to back him strongly.<br>
<br>Taffy Griffiths, as he was called by his colleagues, was a dedicated bachelor. He would sit at dawn in the tiny office of his mud brick house, thinking about plans, writing memoranda, or talking with Sudanese and British colleagues. Then a working breakfast and hours to be spent with a young farmers' club committee, visiting schools, organizing a team of textbook writers, or speaking at an in-service course for conservative headmasters on new methods. In the evening the lamp would be lit, the mosquitoes shut out, and the consolations of Mozart or Gracie Fields would be sought from a vast gramophone, visitors and colleagues crowding the narrow room.<br>
<br>By 1950 over 250 books and booklets had been written (mainly in Arabic). The experiments and the writing were the joint work of British and Sudanese teams. A teachers' postal library and a publications bureau to provide popular literature for school leavers ran successfully for many years. Before Griffiths retired two branch training colleges under the umbrella of the institute were started: one at Dilling in the Nuba Mountains and the other to serve the northern provinces. The effect of this enhancement of teachers' competence and resources was phenomenal; but it was not a mass system. Only about 25 per cent of the boy population could experience the reformed education. Before Sudan's independence such controlled, qualitative reform was possible; but after independence in 1956 the political pressures for vastly more education at all levels was irresistible and quality rapidly declined. When Griffiths revisited Sudan in 1970 his survey showed that good morale and openness to ideas endured, patchily, in the orbit of a few exceptional head teachers but that the supply of good young teachers and of books and materials had become seriously depleted.<br>
<br>On retirement from Sudan in 1950 Griffiths became a research fellow at Keble College, Oxford, and continued to do advisory work for the Colonial Office. He wrote an influential monograph for UNESCO, <span class="italic">The Problem of Rural Education</span> (1968). He also taught at Oxford University's department of education, where he created a course for teachers from developing countries. He was made an OBE in 1949 and a CBE in 1967. Griffiths lived in the village of Noke, near Oxford, where he taught himself to play the guitar, founded a local folk group, and created a garden. Between 1970 and 1973 he joined his brother Dr James Griffiths in the president's lodgings at Magdalen College, and while there, as at Keble, he redesigned corners of the college gardens with sensitivity and skill. The capacity to get things growing never quite left him. Griffiths died at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, on 31 July 1984. He never married.<br>
