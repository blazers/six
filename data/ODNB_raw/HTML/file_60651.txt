<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Milne,  Alan Alexander</span>  (1882&#150;1956), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 18 January 1882 at Henley House, Mortimer Road, Kilburn, in north London, the third son of John Vine Milne (1845&#150;1932) and his wife, (Sarah) Maria (1840&#150;1922), the daughter of Peter Heginbotham. J. V. Milne, who had been born in Jamaica, ran a private school, remarkable for having (briefly) H. G. Wells as a science master and Alfred Harmsworth, later Lord Northcliffe, as a pupil. Both were to have some influence on young Milne, but his father was his most important influence. Much praised and cherished as a child, A. A. Milne grew no protective coating and always found it hard to accept any form of criticism. At Henley House School, he said, &#145;it was natural to be interested; it was easy to be clever&#146;  (A. A. Milne, 43). The clever boy won a scholarship at the early age of eleven and joined his devoted brother, Kenneth, at Westminster School.<br>
<br>Milne became a public-school man and had the sort of life readers might assume from his books and plays, but his background was neither upper-class, Anglican, nor entirely English, and certainly not conventional. It is ironic that A. A. Milne should have been described by a fierce critic as &#145;metaphorically locked in the nursery&#146;. His own ideal of childhood had little to do with nannies and nursery tea and much to do with adventuring. As small boys he and his brothers were given an unusual degree of freedom for Victorian children. &#145;Almost as babies&#146;, Milne recalled, &#145;we were allowed to go walks&#146;, and, later, bicycle rides, &#145;by ourselves anywhere, in London or in the country&#146;  (A. A. Milne, 39). His father encouraged sympathy for the underdog, the idea that brains count more than money, the value of fresh air and manual work, and the distrust of class distinctions. The son was always an &#145;incurable dissident&#146;  (P. Fitzgerald, <span class="italic">The Knox Brothers</span>, 1977, 182), but also, as Frank Swinnerton would put it, someone who &#145;stands for virtue&#146;, not &#145;the prevailing social codes&#146;, but for real goodness  (F. Swinnerton, <span class="italic">Swinnerton: an Autobiography</span>, 1937, 323).<br>
<br>It was while at Westminster School that A. A. Milne developed his lifelong love of cricket, of Jane Austen, and of writing light verse, but it was his mathematics that won him a minor scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1900. It was at Trinity that Milne stopped being a mathematician and became a writer. He edited <span class="italic">Granta</span> and wrote a great deal of it himself. J. V. Milne wanted his son to become a schoolmaster, and eventually to take over his school. Milne was determined to earn his living as a writer. He was both modest and ambitious. It was <span class="italic">Granta</span>'s well-established links with <span class="italic">Punch</span> that encouraged him. No art is so difficult as that of being funny, but it was an art that came naturally to A. A. Milne. His first piece was published in <span class="italic">Punch</span> in 1904. In February 1906, he started work as assistant editor, and in 1910 the <span class="italic">Daily Graphic</span> painted a vivid picture of families up and down the land tearing <span class="italic">Punch</span> apart in eagerness &#145;to read of Dahlia and Simpson and the captivating Myra &hellip; very up-to-date young men and women&#146;, known as the Rabbits  (Thwaite, 142). &#145;Everyone loves A.A.M.&#146;, <span class="italic">The Observer</span> said. The <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span> commented that with Milne it was &#145;more than usually futile to try to explain what makes him so funny&#146;  (Thwaite, 158).<br>
<br>In 1913 the <span class="italic">Daily Citizen</span> described Milne, accurately according to his niece:<blockquote>He is shy but confident, nervous but by no means silent &hellip; He is tall, lean, and athletic. His face is brown, his hair light, his eyes blue. Like nearly all men of great humorous gifts, he is exceedingly sensitive and intuitive &hellip; Few men know their limitations better than he does. He knows precisely what is within his powers &hellip; conversing with him it is necessary to keep one's wits extremely active. (Thwaite, 142)</blockquote>On 4 June 1913 Milne married Dorothy (always known as Daphne; 1889&#150;1971), the daughter of Martin de S&eacute;lincourt, who became chairman of both Swan and Edgar and the <span class="italic">Geographical Magazine</span>. It was an interesting, clever family, but she herself was characterized by more brightness than depth. The marriage survived, but for long periods they led rather separate lives.<br>
<br>In 1915 Milne, in spite of strong pacifist convictions, eventually volunteered and was commissioned into the Warwickshire regiment. He became a signals officer and years later wrote: &#145;I never, as they say, fired a shot in anger&#146;  (A. A. Milne, <span class="italic">Behind the Lines</span>, 1940, 90). It was when he was stationed on the Isle of Wight that he wrote his first play, <span class="italic">The Two Wishes</span>, which was the germ of his first children's book, <span class="italic">Once on a Time</span> (1917). In July 1916 he was in France, on the Somme, in a &#145;nightmare of mental and moral degradation&#146;  (A. A. Milne, 211), about which he wrote very little. In November he left the front line, invalided out with trench fever. He spent the last part of the war in intelligence, but was glad he had known the real horror, as it gave him so much more right to speak out against it. His <span class="italic">Peace with Honour</span> was a best-seller when it was published in 1934, but in 1940 he realized Hitler had to be opposed, and <span class="italic">War with Honour</span> was the result.<br>
<br>In the course of a long writing life, A. A. Milne established three distinct reputations: as an essayist and light verse writer, as a playwright, and as the author of four famous children's books. His <span class="italic">Punch</span> pieces sold in huge quantities when they were collected and appeared between hard covers. His plays were extremely successful&#151;in 1924 he was earning &pound;2000 a year from the amateur rights alone. Some of the titles survive: <span class="italic">Mr Pim Passes by</span> (1919), <span class="italic">The Dover Road</span> (1921), <span class="italic">The Truth about Blayds</span> (1921). But even his most consistently popular play, <span class="italic">Toad of Toad Hall</span> (1929, his version of a book he loved, <span class="italic">The Wind in the Willows</span> by Kenneth Grahame), is now rarely performed.<br>
<br>Although Milne found in plays the most exciting form of writing, books were more straightforward. Milne's most successful piece of adult fiction was a detective story, <span class="italic">The Red House Mystery</span> (1922). It was much admired and much translated. His other novels were <span class="italic">Two People</span> (1931), <span class="italic">Four Days' Wonder</span> (1933), and <span class="italic">Chloe Marr</span> (1946). His American publisher hoped for another detective story after the first, but Milne had other things on his mind. In the summer of 1920 his son, <a href="#cosubject_60651">Christopher Robin, known as Billy [<i>see below</i>]</a>, was born and a year later a teddy bear from Harrods joined the family. It was natural that he would write about them. A great many of the poems which made up the first of Milne's four famous children's books were written on a wet holiday in Wales in 1923. <span class="italic">When we were Very Young</span> was published in 1924. It was a huge success and was acclaimed in <span class="italic">The Times</span> as &#145;the greatest children's book since <span class="italic">Alice</span>&#146;  (Thwaite, 286). In 1933 Compton Mackenzie saw it above all as a social document. &#145;It is not extravagant to surmise that a distant posterity may find in that volume of children's verse a key with which to unlock the present more easily than with any contemporary novel, poem or play&#146;  (Thwaite, 266). Yet without E. H. Shepard's illustrations, which contribute so much to the charm of the book, most of the poems have not dated. Many of them appeal as much to children today as they did when they were written. Milne's technical skill is both admirable and delightful in poems such as &#145;The Dormouse and the Doctor&#146;, &#145;The King's Breakfast&#146;, and &#145;Disobedience&#146; (&#145;James James Morrison Morrison&#146;).<br>
<br>At Christmas 1925 Milne was asked to write a story for the London <span class="italic">Evening News</span>. He decided to write down a bedtime story he had told his son about his bear, which had now acquired the name Winnie-the-Pooh, Winnie after a black Canadian bear in the zoo and Pooh for more mysterious reasons. The story became the first chapter of <span class="italic">Winnie-the-Pooh</span> (1926). Christopher Robin himself was at the centre of the stories and most of the other characters (Piglet, Eeyore, Kanga, and Roo) came from his toy cupboard. Tigger would join them in the second book. Only Owl and Rabbit (and his friends and relations) were not toys.<br>
<br>The Milnes had bought Cotchford Farm, near Hartfield, Sussex, on the edge of Ashdown Forest, in 1925 and the combination of toy animals and real forest was irresistible. A second book of children's poems, <span class="italic">Now we are Six</span>, followed in 1927 and further adventures in the forest, <span class="italic">The House at Pooh Corner</span>, in 1928. They sold and continue to sell in millions, their popularity apparently increased, not diminished, by Walt Disney's films, videos, and marketing. The Pooh books have now been translated into more than thirty languages, including Latin, Japanese, Catalan, Serbo-Croat, and Russian. Oslo and Warsaw both have streets named after Pooh.<br>
<br>In 1952 Milne wrote the following rather sad lines:<blockquote>
<div>If a writer, why not write<br>
</div>
<div>On whatever comes in sight?<br>
</div>
<div>So&#151;the Children's Books: a short<br>
</div>
<div>Intermezzo of a sort:<br>
</div>
<div>When I wrote them little thinking<br>
</div>
<div>All my years of pen-and-inking<br>
</div>
<div>Would be almost lost among<br>
</div>
<div>Those four trifles for the young.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>In <span class="italic">It's Too Late Now</span>, his autobiography (1939), Milne gives only a few pages to the children's books. But when his last book, <span class="italic">Year in, Year out</span>, appeared in 1952, a fan letter from a young journalist prompted him to show that he had come round to accepting Pooh almost as if he were &#145;the creation of one of my own favourite authors&#146;  (Thwaite, 479). A. A. Milne died, after a long illness, at his home, Cotchford Farm, on 31 January 1956, and was cremated at Downs crematorium, Brighton, on 3 February; he was survived by his wife and son. His characters survive not only in the books and films, on greetings cards, mugs, and so on, but also in the English language. It is taken for granted that people know what is meant by &#145;an Eeyore-like tone&#146; or &#145;behaving exactly like Tigger&#146;.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_60651"></a><span class="headword">Christopher Robin Milne</span>  (1920&#150;1996), <span class="occ">writer and bookseller</span>, the son of A. A. Milne and his wife, Dorothy de S&eacute;lincourt, was born on 21 August 1920 at 11 Mallord Street, Chelsea, London. At the time of his birth J. M. Barrie, mentor and friend, had written, &#145;May Billy be an everlasting joy to you&#146;  (Thwaite, 215). As it turned out he was not, but the fault was hardly his own. As a child he was extremely close to his father and &#145;quite liked &hellip; being famous&#146;, as he wrote himself in 1973  (C. Milne, <span class="italic">Enchanted Places</span>, 92). In 1931 he had been named by the American <span class="italic">Parents' Magazine</span> as one of the most famous children in the world. But the pleasure of it turned sour. A columnist in <span class="italic">The Observer</span> suggested that Christopher Milne had spent &#145;over forty years trying to get off his knees from saying his prayers&#146;. Certainly he had been teased during his time at Stowe School (1934&#150;9), and as a young man it had seemed to him that his father had got where he was &#145;by climbing upon my infant shoulders, that he had filched from me my good name and had left me with nothing but the empty fame of being his son&#146;  (C. Milne, <span class="italic">Enchanted Places</span>, 165). But the impression the papers gave at his death that the father had ruined the son's life was far from true. In <span class="italic">The Path through the Trees</span> (1979) he summed up his own life as a happy one.<br>
<br>Christopher Milne went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1939. His course of study was interrupted by his war service with the Royal Engineers, but he returned in 1946, and in 1947 took a degree in English. On 24 July 1948 he married his cousin, Lesley de S&eacute;lincourt, and the wedding represented the first meeting in more than twenty-five years between the parents of the bride and the groom, as a result of a long-standing estrangement between Dorothy Milne and her brother, Aubrey de S&eacute;lincourt. Christopher Milne's parents did not wholly approve of the match, but a courtship of shared walks and the &#145;discovery that though we were both solitaries, we liked being solitary in each other's company&#146;  (C. Milne, <span class="italic">Path</span>, 135) developed into a supportive and loving marriage. In 1951 they left London to start the Harbour Bookshop in Dartmouth, and Milne's determination to lead an independent life enabled him to come more fully to terms with his situation. The bookshop was a success, and in <span class="italic">The Path through the Trees</span> he wrote of the way in which he and his wife had learned the business as they worked.<br>
<br>Milne's autobiographical writing had begun, however, soon after his mother's death, with the best-selling <span class="italic">The Enchanted Places</span> (1974). He was in many ways very like his father; he was also an extremely good writer. Sadly he never found another subject as interesting to his readers as his own childhood. His only child, Clare, to whom he was devoted, was born severely disabled with cerebral palsy, and he set up a trust fund for her with his share of the Pooh money. Money had never interested him. He lived simply and gave much away. He died at Torbay Hospital, Devon, on 20 April 1996, survived by his wife and daughter; his cremation was followed by a service at the Quaker meeting-house, Totnes.<br>
