<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ferneley,  John</span>  (1782&#150;1860), <span class="occ">sporting painter</span>, was born on 18 May 1782 in the village of Thrussington, 6 miles from Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire. He was the ninth of ten children born to William Ferneley, wheelwright and wagon builder, and his wife, Ann. He received only minimal schooling, and to the end of his days his spelling was eccentric and his punctuation non-existent. At the age of twenty, although still working for his father, he was showing an increasing interest in decorating farm carts with his paintings and making primitive sketches of fox-hunting. His na&iuml;ve efforts came to the attention of the young John Henry Manners, fifth duke of Rutland (1778&#150;1857), whose seat was 15 miles away at Belvoir Castle and who, since coming of age, had taken control of his family pack of hounds. With the duke's encouragement Ferneley began in 1801 a three-year apprenticeship to the Leicestershire-born sporting artist Ben Marshall (1768&#150;1835), then living in Beaumont Street, London. As part of the agreement he was to be enrolled as a student at the Royal Academy; he never was.<br>
<br>In 1804, his apprenticeship completed and his friendship with Marshall intact, Ferneley received on the duke of Rutland's recommendation commissions from the officers of the Leicestershire yeomanry, then stationed at Dover under the duke's command. Moving on, he painted the young Thomas Assheton Smith (1776&#150;1856), his first sitter in a scarlet hunting coat. Smith was one of the foremost fox-hunters of his time who in 1806 was to take the Quorn hounds, in whose country lay Thrussington, and he became one of Ferneley's leading patrons. Two Irish noblemen also ordered paintings: Lord Lismore in 1805 and the Hon. George O'Callaghan in 1806; both were to employ him again when owing to ill health he visited Ireland in 1809. He made subsequent visits to that country in 1810 and 1812.<br>
<br>Within ten years of starting his apprenticeship Ferneley was earning in excess of &pound;200 a year, and he married Sarah (Sally) Kettle in 1809. The centre of the sporting world, the &#145;queen of the shires&#146;  (Brownlow), was Melton Mowbray, with its four adjacent hunts&#151;the Quorn, the Cottesmore, the Belvoir, and the South Nottinghamshire&#151;providing sport six days a week over fine country and with ample accommodation in its four clubs and neighbouring country houses. In 1813 John Ferneley took lodgings there and in the following year he built in the town first a studio and then a substantial house that he called Elgin Lodge in praise of the Elgin marbles (acquired by Lord Elgin in 1801&#150;3). From 1818 onwards he proudly signed his paintings &#145;John Ferneley, Melton Mowbray&#146; and never lacked commissions. Both husband and wife fitted perfectly into the ambience of the hunting set. In a society with few women, Sarah was good company, and John was a sportsman who kept his own hunter and enjoyed fishing, shooting, stalking, and yachting. He remained a modest, conservative countryman, not seduced by the high life around him. Unlike his richer and better-connected contemporaries Francis Grant, his one-time pupil, and Lorraine Smith, godfather of his son Claude Lorraine, he never wore a red coat (in his Quorn hunt painting of 1825 he is the only one of fourteen riders not wearing one) and was content to lodge with the huntsman when working away. In his letters home he worried about leading in the hay and feeding his hunter. On one occasion he accepted two bacon pigs in exchange for a painting. In 1810 he had increased his charge for a painting of a single horse from 5 guineas to 10, and this he never altered. The most he ever charged was 200 guineas for the large, imaginative <span class="italic">Council of Horses</span>, inspired by Gay's fables, now hanging in Calke Abbey.<br>
<br>John and Sally Ferneley had eight children, two of whom died in infancy and three of whom showed artistic ability. Sarah (1811&#150;1903) engraved some of her father's paintings and worked mainly in watercolours; John junior (1814&#150;1862) executed a rather weaker version of his father's style and settled in York about 1839; Claude Lorraine (1822&#150;1891), although a better artist than John junior, preferred music to art. Both Ferneley's letters to his wife and two paintings by him in Leicester Art Gallery (<span class="italic">The Ferneley Family Pew, Melton Mowbray Parish Church</span>, 1826, and <span class="italic">Portrait of the Artist and his Family in his Studio</span>, <i>c</i>.1822), attest to his love of his wife and children. Sally died in 1836 and Ferneley married second, in July 1838 at Ecclesfield, Ann Allen, with whom he had a son, Charles Allen, in 1844. Ann Ferneley died in 1854, after which Ferneley's widowed favourite daughter, Sarah, looked after him.<br>
<br>Ferneley made an annual pilgrimage to London and periodic expeditions to Scotland, Yorkshire, and other parts of England. He died at his home, Elgin Lodge, on 3 June 1860, having caught a chill on the coach journey from Sleaford, where he had just finished a painting for Sir Thomas Whichcote, bt. He was buried in Thrussington.<br>
<br>Ferneley was a prolific painter. Although there are probably no more than a handful of his pictures that do not contain either a horse or a dog, nevertheless there is within these limits a wide range of subjects: hunting, racing, shooting, stalking, horse and cattle fairs, portraits of dogs and farm animals. His definitive works were, however, his &#145;scurries&#146;, and hunting portraits. The &#145;hunt scurry&#146; was a panoramic view, up to 120 cm by 212 cm (the proportions deriving from his early work on farm carts), of a number of identifiable riders galloping at splittercokation pace across the large, recently enclosed, pastures of the midlands. In his portraits the relaxed rider is invariably immaculately turned out and sitting on a horse of some presence. Ferneley's images recreate for us a uniquely English lifestyle.<br>
<br>Between 1806 and 1853 Ferneley exhibited twenty-two pictures at the Royal Academy, four at the British Institution, and thirteen at Suffolk Street. Paget transcribed Ferneley's account book (now lost) which, with a few gaps, covers his working life; his average earnings were about &pound;400 a year. Ferneley's will was proved at less than &pound;300. Ten of his paintings are in Leicester Art Gallery.<br>
