<span class="headword">Thaarup,  Aage Gjerfing</span>  (1906&#150;1987), <span class="occ">milliner</span>, was born on 29 April 1906 in Copenhagen, Denmark, in a lower-middle-class family of moderate means. He was the second of four brothers. After a conventional high- and commercial-school education he was employed as a trainee salesman in the millinery department of Fornesbeck, the largest Copenhagen department store. He then received an educational grant, which he supplemented by extracurricular fashion drawing and English teaching, and worked for a brief period in Berlin and at a Paris couture milliner, Maison Lewis. He returned to Copenhagen but, unable to settle, left for London in 1928.<br>
<br>A period as a traveller with a wholesale hat firm having proved disappointing, Thaarup borrowed &pound;200 and went to India in 1929, accumulating during the voyage the basis of a smart society clientele associated with the viceregal court. On his return to London in 1932, with &pound;300 further borrowed capital, he opened a small salon at 4 Berkeley Street. By 1935 he was established as the most fashionable and innovative milliner in London with a royal and international society clientele. He also made hats for film and stage productions.<br>
<br>Thaarup's creativity lay in his sense of form and the suitability of the hat for the personality of the wearer, the outfit, and the occasion for which it was intended. His sewing skills were minimal and he consistently stressed his reliance on the craft of his assistants. Nevertheless, with an enterprise then unusual in the London fashion accessory trade, after becoming a limited company and moving to larger premises in Grosvenor Street, he began to export hats to Lord and Taylor in New York and, less successfully, to Paris. Publicity was sustained by fashion shows, such as a surrealist-inspired display in New York in 1936, as well as others in collaboration with the newly formed Fashion Group of London. The wit and originality of these shows inspired his nickname, the &#145;Mad Hatter&#146;. His house in Bywater Street, Chelsea, became a centre for the artistic intelligentsia, several of whom were to contribute to his artistically innovative magazine <span class="italic">Pinpoints</span>, of which four numbers were issued (1938&#150;9).<br>
<br>Being both lame and a Danish national, Thaarup was not directly involved in the war. However, the abnormal trading conditions forced his business into administration in 1940&#150;42. Hats were nevertheless unrationed and were popular accessories, and as trade revived Thaarup organized touring fashion exhibitions as well as beginning a small wholesale trade. Popular innovations were &#145;6 o'clock hats&#146; for semi-formal wartime entertaining and miniature hats as gift tokens. His post-war popularity was confirmed by hats made for Queen and Princess Elizabeth for prestige royal occasions such as the victory parade in 1946 and for the trooping of the colour in 1950, but Thaarup appears never to have become a royal warrant holder.<br>
<br>In 1947, participating in the post-war export drive, Thaarup launched Aage Thaarup (Export and Wholesale) Ltd. In 1948 he became president of the Associated Millinery Designers of London. Despite a series of worldwide promotional tours and the innovative introduction of a &#145;Teen and Twenty&#146; range of hats, the firm which had merged with Aage Thaarup Ltd was bankrupt by 1955 with debts of &pound;16,500 and assets of &pound;6500, which <span class="italic">The Times</span> ascribed to overtrading, the long credit customary in the fashion industry, and inadequate financial supervision; Thaarup's generosity to friends and family also probably played a part in the collapse. It is perhaps characteristic of his ebullient and optimistic personality that after the bankruptcy hearing, with help from friends, he spent the weekend at the Ritz.<br>
<br>Sponsored by friends, Thaarup continued to work for the next ten years. He was based first at 132 King's Road, Chelsea, where he was assisted by students, several of whom became successful milliners in their own right, and from 1960 in Hanover Square, where he remained until retirement in 1965. He then lived for some years at Flat 2, 104 Elm Park Gardens, Chelsea.<br>
<br>Small, spare, and sprightly, witty and articulate with a slight Danish accent, conventional in dress but with an enduring affection for flowing bow-ties, Thaarup remained on the fringes of the fashion world until he died of heart disease, on 11 December 1987 at St Stephen's Hospital, Chelsea. He never married. His autobiography, <span class="italic">Heads and Tales</span> (1956), outlined his career. Examples of his work have survived in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, and the Museum of Fashion, Bath, as well as other collections.<br>
