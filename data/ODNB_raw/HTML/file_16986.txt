<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Longland,  John</span>  (1473&#150;1547), <span class="occ">bishop of Lincoln</span>, was born at Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, the son of Thomas Longland (<i>d</i>. 1529) and Isabel Staveley, who had a shop in Henley. By the time of his mother's death in 1530, the family was clearly a prosperous one.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlypreferments"></a>Education and early preferments</h2>John Longland went to school in Henley, and his parents were said to have promoted his education: &#145;I was entrusted by my parents to a school of good and sound learning&#146;  (Longland, <span class="italic">Quinque sermones</span>, 4, fol. 88<i>v</i>). He may have gone from Henley to Eton College, a foundation of which he was very fond, and in which he was eventually to be buried. From Eton he went by 1491 to Oxford, where he became a scholar and fellow (and bursar) of Magdalen College, and was for a year (1506/7) principal of Magdalen Hall. By 1509 he was BTh, and DTh by 1511.<br>
<br>Longland was from the first a scholar, and by the time of his death had accumulated a very large library. He received his first preferments in 1505, but they were not of a particularly significant kind until he became dean of Salisbury in December 1514 and a canon and prebendary of St Stephen's Chapel, Westminster, in 1517 and of St George's Chapel, Windsor, in 1519. He was singled out for advancement by the quality of his preaching, which was admired by such serious churchmen as Thomas More, Richard Kidderminster, and William Warham. Warham wrote to Longland commending a published volume of his sermons, for his &#145;fervent zeal for reformation to be made as well of heretical doctrines as of misbehaviours in manners&#146;, and he assured him that his sermons would give Longland a &#145;perpetual memory&#146;  (Lincoln Archives Office, register 26, fols. 206&#150;206<i>v</i>). Longland was also in correspondence with Juan Luis Vives and with Erasmus on matters of church reform. So influential a preacher gained the notice of Henry VIII, perhaps partially because Thomas Wolsey had been at Magdalen with Longland. He was, therefore, a strong candidate for preferment, and on 20 March 1521 Longland was provided to the see of Lincoln; he was consecrated on 5 May and the temporalities were restored on 26 June. Almost immediately afterwards he became the king's almoner, and by 1524 the royal confessor.<br>
<br>Wolsey's hand may be seen in these marks of favour. Wolsey often used Longland to help him with his most cherished projects. It was Longland who in 1525 preached at the laying of the foundation stone of Cardinal College, who was Wolsey's agent in acquiring &#145;singing men&#146; for the college, and on whom Wolsey relied for his projected reformation of the statutes of the University of Oxford; and it was to Wolsey that Longland wrote some of his most personal letters. For Longland, unlike Wolsey, the combination of these posts meant that, like other bishops before him, he was always torn between his obligations to his diocese and those of the court. He had been present at the Field of Cloth of Gold in June 1520 and he was required to preach at court for most major festivals and in Lent. In 1525 he told Wolsey that he was at court for Trinity Sunday (11 June) and for Corpus Christi eve and day (14 and 15 June). On the eve &#145;the king his grace was shriven and on the morrow was shriven and houselled&#146;  (Ellis, 3/1, 251&#150;4). As though this were not enough, plague was raging and the bishop could not even find safe refuge at his favourite manor of Buckden, in Huntingdonshire.<h2>
<a name="BishopofLincoln"></a>Bishop of Lincoln</h2>His duties to his diocese Longland saw mainly in terms of dealing with the larger institutions within it, the monasteries and the cathedral church. He was installed in this latter in September 1522, and two years later began a personal visitation of it. He wrote new rules for the poor clerks, whose truancy had become legendary. In his requirements for them, some written in his own hand, he ordered them not to keep hawks, dogs, and ferrets, but a single dog for them all, and not to play cards or dice, or to hunt, or &#145;use any other unlawful or unhonest games or play&#146;. Fines were imposed for slander, drawing a knife, and for assault which &#145;God forbid &hellip; draw blood of any of his fellows&#146;  (Lincoln Archives Office, dean and chapter MSS, A.2.10[8]). There were other penalties for leaving gates open or using doors as privies. All to no avail, since a mere two years later the fines levied were finding their way back to the clerks themselves, whose games now included playing with loaded dice.<br>
<br>Longland also found that the religious houses of his diocese fell short of his exacting standards. Before he came to the see of Lincoln, he had preached to the monks of Westminster and had roundly condemned the laxity of the religious:<blockquote>Woe unto them who do not devote themselves to prayer and reading &hellip; but they give themselves over to gourmandising and self-indulgence. When they have filled their bellies, they belch, they sit idle, they laugh and pass most of the time in relaxation and idle vanities. The pure will see God and rejoice in the sight; the impure will neither rejoice nor see &hellip; Our true predecessors, both monks and secular clergy, led a holy and hard life, we a much easier and softer one, we who have stained her pristine beauty and devotion with worldly desires. (Longland, <span class="italic">Tres conciones</span>, 1, fols. 7<i>v</i>, 9&#150;10)</blockquote>In visiting some of the most severely disordered monasteries of his diocese, Longland showed that his view of them was not merely idealistic. He was apt to embellish his injunctions with quotations in his own hand from the rule of St Benedict. He confined his visitations to the most intransigent of the monastic orders in his diocese, and the houses he visited clearly shocked him. At the Augustinian priory of Dorchester he took the unusual step, in June 1529, of appointing a new prior. A year later, he found that his nominee did not read his injunctions to the community, and that he was dallying with a local lady. At Great Missenden, to which he made injunctions in 1531, he was forced to admit that the monks were uneducated, and he told them that &#145;ye be ignorant and have small understanding of Latin [so] we have drawn our said injunctions in our vulgar English tongue&#146;  (Lincoln Archives Office, register 26, fol. 212). Where monks and nuns could not feign ignorance of his wishes, they went behind his back to court, pretending that he was the cause of the undoing of a place. No amount of energy expended either by him or by his deputies appeared to make any difference. It is hardly surprising that when the monasteries were dissolved, Longland made no move to defend them.<h2>
<a name="Counteractingheresy"></a>Counteracting heresy</h2>Longland could not evade the enormous challenges that heresy posed to a diocese which certainly had a Lollard community in Buckinghamshire. Moreover, the diocese included the University of Oxford, where Luther's views, in whole or in part, were much debated. In Luther, Longland recognized a formidable adversary:<blockquote>You, Luther, already turn everything upside down and confound everything &hellip; You revile the holy sacraments from which we derive every remedy and help against all the diseases of the soul. You want everything to be in common, you want the human race to be a wanderer on the earth as it was in the beginning, without a leader, without a ruler &hellip; without authority &hellip; without virtue, without grace. (Bodl. Oxf., MS Arch.A.d.11, fol. 44)</blockquote>Within a week of his consecration, Longland was present at Paul's Cross for the condemnation of Luther, the public burning of his books, and a penetrating sermon against Luther preached by John Fisher in 1521. He followed this by ordering a search for Luther's books in Oxford and by a further examination of those Buckinghamshire Lollards, drawn mainly from Amersham, who came under suspicion of heresy as a result of having been required to abjure their opinions before his predecessors. Four of them were condemned to the stake and many more were imprisoned in monasteries as a form of penance. But by 1526 Longland's activities in Oxford went well beyond that. Booksellers were to be searched and scholars' rooms scoured for the works of Luther. But vigilant as he might be, the bishop's commissary in Oxford realized that Lutherans like Thomas Garrett had made contact with scholars who were &#145;given to Greek, Hebrew and the polite Latin tongue&#146;  (<span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>, 5, appendix 1). He could not stop the distribution of books. Like Bishop Nicholas West of Ely, between 1527 and 1532 Longland took the unusual measure of asking any priest suspected of heretical views for an oath of orthodoxy before he was admitted to a benefice. He also alerted the archdeacon of Lincoln to the danger that the Lincolnshire coast presented for the import of heretical books.<h2>
<a name="Thekingsdivorceandtheroyalsupremacy"></a>The king's divorce and the royal supremacy</h2>At the height of Longland's campaign against Lutheranism came another threat: it was that of the king's marriage. Wolsey's biographer, George Cavendish, thought that the king first raised doubts about the validity of his marriage with Longland, but others were of the opinion that the cardinal prompted Longland to raise the question. Certainly Longland was at the centre of the affair and at all times seems to have taken the king's side. He was the obvious person to solicit the views of the University of Oxford on the marriage, and though he encountered much hostility, he was selected by the king to be chancellor of the university in 1532. He accompanied Henry and Anne Boleyn to France in 1532 and was a strong candidate for the archbishopric of Canterbury on the death of William Warham in August 1532. Longland's favoured position was, however, weakened by the disgrace of his friend Thomas Wolsey, and still more by Wolsey's replacement at court, Thomas Cromwell. Longland's correspondence with Cromwell reveals the bishop's meticulous attention to detail, but clearly no love was lost between the two, and there are no references to the personal problems that he shared so readily with Wolsey.<br>
<br>If Longland had no doubts about the Boleyn marriage, he had some problems with its sequel. He was not, like John Fisher and Thomas More, in total opposition to the royal supremacy over the church, nor was he against the succession passing to the issue of Anne Boleyn. The challenge, however, to ecclesiastical jurisdiction posed by the threat to the clergy of <i>praemunire</i> and eventually of the delegation of the supremacy to Thomas Cromwell as vicegerent, was a different matter. In 1534 the Spanish ambassador reported &#145;the Bishop of Lincoln &hellip; has said several times since Christmas that he would rather be the poorest man in the world than ever have been the King's councillor and confessor&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 7, no. 14). That was but the beginning. Longland could and did argue with Cromwell about the extent of the invasion of his jurisdiction by archbishop or vicegerent or anyone else. He sent carefully worded letters and a well-chosen gift in order to safeguard the rights of future bishops of Lincoln, but it was not until 1538 that he actually made public his views on the supremacy of the bishop of Rome.<br>
<br>Preaching before the king at Greenwich on Good Friday 1538, Longland said that there is only one great bishop and:<blockquote>he did penetrate the heavens whose name is Jesus the Son of God &hellip; The bishop of Rome therefore ought &hellip; to be abashed, ashamed and to abhor his own pride. For &hellip; he outrageously doth offend God and blasphemeth him in that he presumeth to take this high name [<i>summus maximus</i> and <i>universalis pontifex</i>] from our bishop Christ &hellip; He is the mighty Bishop. We are not so. (<span class="italic">A Sermonde Made before King [Henry VIII]</span>)</blockquote>It was, however, one thing to accept a royal supremacy under Christ, but Longland was discriminating in his attitude to the various reforms of the church that resulted from it. Not surprisingly, he does not appear to have objected to the dissolution of the monasteries, and he seems to have remained consistently in favour of a vernacular scripture. In a sermon reminiscent of Erasmus, he said:<blockquote>We rejoice much that we have it in our own vulgar speech, that we hear it, that we read it, that we have it in our bosoms, and hanging at our girdles, and it is daily preached among us. But what shall this profit if we live not thereafter? If we live not well and Christianly? (ibid.)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Aconservativeprelate"></a>A conservative prelate</h2>For Longland, to live as a Christian was not necessarily to adopt the views of Cromwell, Cranmer, or Martin Luther, and he took very good care to control preaching in his diocese and to limit it to the uncontentious exposition of scripture. A printed copy of the agreed declaration about the royal supremacy was sent to all his clergy in 1535, and in the following year preaching on opinions which had no authority from king or bishop was forbidden. By 1540 he was keeping records of preachers and having an eye to what they preached. He was equally careful to control any spread of heresy, either through books smuggled into the University of Oxford, or through the network of Lollard communities. He wrote to his archdeacons to make sure that anybody transgressing his orders about preaching was to be reported to him at once.<br>
<br>But there were some changes that Longland disliked but could not stop. He clearly objected to the plunder of church treasure and the attempt by the crown to extend its control of the church by influencing bishops and deans and chapters of cathedrals in their grants of lands and advowsons. As early as 1534 he insisted that his dean and chapter should not allow any such grants to be made unless his explicit approval had been obtained. In his leasing of episcopal lands, he attempted after 1540 to concentrate them in a few hands, and these were mainly those of his family and most trusted servants. The charge of nepotism can obviously be made against him, but it was not nepotism in its usual derogatory sense, simply to benefit the family: he was attempting to keep the wealth of the church in conservative hands&#151;a purpose that is very marked in his will. In his later years he invested his money in building a chantry in Lincoln Cathedral, thereby placing his faith in the idea of intercession for the dead and its institutionalization which disappeared from England even as he lay dying. His last years were spent mainly at Wooburn, Buckinghamshire, and he began to visit some of his archdeaconries, notably that of Buckingham, in person. He recognized that the defence of the church in the 1540s lay in the hands of the secular clergy, whose welfare he had delegated to others in the early part of his episcopate.<h2>
<a name="Legacies"></a>Legacies</h2>Longland died at Wooburn on 7 May 1547. He asked that his body be buried at Eton College, and that his heart be taken to his cathedral church and buried before &#145;the most blessed sacrament at the high altar&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/31, fol. 305<i>v</i>). All parishes through which his body passed between his house at Wooburn and Eton were to receive 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. for the maintenance of their churches. His will reveals the scholar and theologian that he had been. To a Dr Roydon, he left his smaller astrolabe and a clock, with a small book about making dials. To many different people, he left a large quantity of books. From his library at Buckden &#145;[books of] the greatest and best sort&#146; were to go to Lincoln Cathedral, but the smaller ones were to be distributed among the rectors and vicars of the county. Additionally he left books to be chained in the libraries of Eton College and, at Oxford, in those of the colleges of Magdalen, Lincoln, Oriel, and Brasenose. He left to his nephew Edward Longland a commentary on the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and three of his best books of sermons from his study at Buckden. He was a wealthy man, and his servants and relatives received from him horses and harnesses, large quantities of bedding, and a considerable amount of silver. He pardoned the debts of those who owed him less than 40 shillings, and was extremely generous to another nephew, Thomas Longland, who was apparently setting up house and needed his linen and household utensils. To the dean and chapter of Lincoln he left a considerable number of copes and for his successors to the bishopric, his red silk gloves and episcopal sandals, together with books needed for giving orders and consecrating bishops. He also left to them a book of blessings for the use of future bishops of Lincoln, but with the prudent condition that it might not be taken away from the cathedral. The furnishings for his own chantry chapel were provided for, and a psalter was to be chained there.<br>
<br>Longland seemed at his death to be aware of his own humble origins as well as of his evangelical duty to care for the old and poor. He provided for an almshouse at Henley for five men and five women, and his own devotional rigour was in part demanded of them. They had, among other devotions, to be able, twice daily, to say (five times, in honour of the five wounds of Christ) the <span class="roman">Our Father</span> and the <span class="roman">Ave</span>, together with the creed. Most importantly of all, they were not to hold &#145;any erroneous opinions&#146; under pain of dismissal  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/31, fol. 306<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Longland may seem to have been a time-server who had the power to influence Henry VIII and did not use it. But as the royal confessor he had access to information which perforce is now lost. Henry VIII trusted his integrity, and that is most evident in his protection of Longland against another royal servant, Thomas Cromwell. Cromwell might bully Longland but did not oust him. Longland could not avoid the diminution of his diocese with the formation of the dioceses of Oxford and Peterborough, with all the loss of status and wealth that this implied. The Lincolnshire rebels in 1536 derided him and murdered his vicar-general, even though they were as doctrinally conservative as he was. His sermons reveal a rigorous attitude to his faith and a stern and somewhat joyless attitude to the gospel. His own death saved him from changes in royal policy of which he would not have approved. He remained throughout his life aware, almost too aware, that he would account for all his actions &#145;at that great day of examination&#146;  (&#145;A Sermonde Made be for the Kynges Hyghenes&#146;).<br>
