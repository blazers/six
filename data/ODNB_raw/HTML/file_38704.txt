<span class="headword">Wise,  Edward Frank</span>  (1885&#150;1933), <span class="occ">economist and politician</span>, was born at 13 Albert Street, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, on 3 July 1885, the elder son of Edward Wise, a fishmonger, and his wife, Ellen Clayton (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Peel). He was educated at Guildhall feoffment elementary school, King Edward VI School in Bury St Edmunds, and Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, where he graduated as second senior optime in the mathematical tripos (1906) and with a second in part one of the natural sciences tripos (1907). In 1907 he entered the civil service as a junior clerk in the House of Commons and he was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1911. In that year he became sub-warden at Toynbee Hall, which he gave as his residence when on 2 November 1912 at St Paul's Church, Hampstead, he married Dorothy Lilian (<i>b</i>. 1886), the daughter of William Shepperson Owen, a bank manager. Having studied at Royal Holloway College, she was a graduate of London University and a lecturer in English there. They had one son and three daughters.<br>
<br>In 1912 Wise became principal clerk to the National Health Insurance Commission and was subsequently secretary to the Anglo-Russian supplies committee of the War Office (1914&#150;15), assistant director of army contracts in charge of clothing and raw materials (1915&#150;17), and principal assistant secretary to the Ministry of Food (1917&#150;18). He was one of the British representatives on the Inter-Allied Supreme Economic Council (1919) and assistant secretary at the Board of Trade (1922). These last responsibilities involved work on wartime food rationing, the food supply position in post-war Europe, the Russian famine of the early 1920s, and discussions with Russian trade delegates. Wise also attended the post-war international economic conferences at San Remo (1920) and Genoa (1922). He was created CB in 1919 and resigned from the civil service in February 1923 before taking up a post as an economic adviser on foreign trade to the Russian co-operative movement during the period 1923&#150;9.<br>
<br>Wise's civil service experience with army contracts and the Ministry of Food, followed by his work with the Russian co-operative movement, helped to shape his thinking on economic questions, as did his socialism, which found expression in a membership of the Independent Labour Party that predated 1914. Like E. M. H. Lloyd, he saw the potential for translating aspects of wartime planning into socialist economic practice, as was apparent in his contribution to the formulation of the Independent Labour Party's policy on agriculture in the early 1920s. Influenced by Wise, an Independent Labour Party committee set up to report on agriculture and the land proposed the establishment of a board of supply for the bulk purchase of imports that, in regulating supply, would control prices of agricultural produce. The idea was subsequently embodied in H. N. Brailsford's <span class="italic">Socialist Policy for Agriculture</span> (1924) and had an impact on the agricultural policy of the Labour Party.<br>
<br>Similar views on the planning and regulation of the supply of basic commodities were articulated in <span class="italic">The Living Wage</span> (1926), which Wise co-wrote with J. A. Hobson, H. N. Brailsford, and A. Creech Jones. The decisive analytical and prescriptive inputs were those of Hobson and Brailsford, but a key element in it was its proposed control of the supply and prices of imported food and raw materials, and here one can certainly detect the mind of Wise. Such ideas were also to the fore in Wise's <span class="italic">Profiteering in bread: how to stop it: evidence given on behalf of the Independent Labour Party before the royal commission on food prices</span> (1926) and his sympathetic account, <span class="italic">The Russian Co-Operative Movement</span> (1926).<br>
<br>Having stood unsuccessfully for Bradford North in the general election of 1924, Wise was elected MP for Leicester East in 1929. Against the background of the global depression in the price of agricultural prices of the 1920s his maiden speech in the House of Commons favoured a state-financed and directed price stabilization scheme for wheat  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5C</span>, 231, 30 Oct 1929, 188&#150;95); it was subsequently published as an Independent Labour Party pamphlet, <span class="italic">Wheat: Dumping v. State Purchase</span> (1929). He was critical of the Labour Party leadership on a number of important policy issues and in particular Snowden's view in the late 1920s and early 1930s that the Bank of England and the conduct of monetary policy should be made impervious to political influences. As Wise saw it, the City, with the Bank of England at its heart, was infused with a capitalist bias and unless its power to create and direct investment was broken there was little hope of the Labour Party's implementing a radical economic strategy. He therefore advocated the nationalization of the Bank of England and the joint-stock banks and continued to press for this after the demise of the second minority Labour government in 1931. He also criticized that government's attempts to rationalize the coal industry through the <span class="roman">Coal Mines Reorganization Act</span>, 1930, making clear in his contributions to parliamentary debates that public ownership would alone provide a solution to the problems of the coal industry. He lost his seat at Leicester in the general election of 1931.<br>
<br>At the Labour Party conference of 1932 Wise successfully introduced an amendment to Hugh Dalton's resolutions on currency, banking, and finance. The amendment proposed the nationalization of the joint-stock banks and other financial institutions and was carried despite the objections of the leadership. After the conference he was invited by the party's finance and trade committee, along with Clement Attlee, to prepare a memorandum on the joint-stock banks. The result was a detailed plan for their nationalization which found expression in the Labour Party's <span class="italic">Socialism and the Condition of the People</span> (1933).<br>
<br>Though critical of many aspects of the 1929&#150;31 Labour government's conduct, Wise, in the aftermath of its demise, believed that the Labour Party's consequent leftward shift created the basis for the active involvement of the Independent Labour Party in the pursuit of a manifestly socialist strategy. However, in the early 1930s the Independent Labour Party became increasingly critical of the Labour leadership's position on many issues and Wise was caught up in the controversy over whether or not it should disaffiliate. As a persistent opponent of disaffiliation, arguing that outside the Labour Party the Independent Labour Party would degenerate into a sectarian minority, Wise rapidly found himself in a minority within its national administrative council (of which he had been a member since the early 1920s). When the decision to disaffiliate came, he helped to establish the Socialist League, comprising members of the Society for Socialist Inquiry and Propaganda and the Independent Labour Party affiliationists. He became its chairman shortly before his death. The Socialist League published two of his contributions to the early 1930s debate on the fate of the City and the conduct of monetary policy under a future Labour government: <span class="italic">The Control of Finance and the Financiers</span> (1932) and <span class="italic">The Socialisation of Banking</span> (1934).<br>
<br>Wise died suddenly of heart failure on 5 November 1933 in a field adjoining Wallington Hall, Morpeth, Northumberland, the home of C. P. Trevelyan; his wife survived him. He was buried at Wallington Hall.<br>
