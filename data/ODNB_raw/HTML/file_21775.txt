<span class="headword">Peerson,  Martin</span>  (1571&#150;1650/51), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born at March, Cambridgeshire, the son of Thomas and Margaret Peerson. His father probably died shortly afterwards, since his mother remarried in 1573. Peerson came under the influence of the poet Fulke Greville at an early stage in his career, composing a setting of &#145;See, O see, who is heere come a maying&#146; which was performed at the Highgate home of Sir William Cornwallis as part of Ben Jonson's &#145;Private Entertainment of the King and Queene&#146; on May day 1604. Evidently Peerson had Catholic sympathies, for in 1606 he was cited for recusancy. In 1609 he was living at Stoke Newington. In 1613 he graduated BMus at Lincoln College, Oxford. Possibly between 1623 and 1630 Peerson was sacrist at Westminster Abbey. Certainly at some point between June 1624 and June 1625 he became almoner and master of the choristers at St Paul's Cathedral; he lived in a dwelling nearby that was subsequently condemned to demolition before the repairing of the cathedral. Alternative accommodation large enough for Peerson and the choristers under his supervision was eventually found within the petty canons' college (perhaps he was made a petty canon before this removal).<br>
<br>Peerson's principal publications were <span class="italic">Private Musicke</span> (1620) and <span class="italic">Mottects, or, Grave Chamber Musique</span> (1630). The former, comprising secular vocal ayres (solos and duets) with viol accompaniment, is notable for its stylistic novelty, combining features of the madrigal, consort song, and anthem. The latter claims historical importance as the first known published musical collection in England to include a notated figured bass part, and is notable too for its largely melancholic idiom, in which the musical techniques (suggesting an awareness of declamatory possibilities imported from Italy) are devoted purely to the affective representation of rather sombre texts. Peerson also contributed three &#145;full&#146; anthems to Sir William Leighton's <span class="italic">The Teares or Lamentations of a Sorrowfull Soule</span> (1613) and a psalm tune to Thomas Ravenscroft's <span class="italic">The Whole Booke of Psalmes</span> (1621). A significant number of English anthems (mainly &#145;verse&#146; anthems, alternating soloists and full choir) survive in manuscript, principally in the British Library and the Bodleian Library, Oxford. They incorporate contemporary madrigalisms, including quite precisely crafted word-painting and affective use of chromatically inflected melody and harmony. Eleven Latin motets are preserved in a single manuscript (in the Bodleian Library), all lacking a treble part. Possibly Peerson's most famous compositions are the brief programmatic pieces for keyboard &#145;The Fall of the Leafe&#146; and &#145;The Primerose&#146; in the famous Fitzwilliam virginal book, compiled by Francis Tregian during the first two decades or so of the seventeenth century and containing music largely by Catholic composers (Peerson's keyboard music is found only in this source). There is also a small quantity of surviving music for consorts of viols, copied in manuscripts whose regional and chronological spread suggest that Peerson's work in this field enjoyed quite a wide currency during his lifetime and continued to be played after his death. These works are most impressive in their command of technical resource, featuring most prominently contrapuntal interplay between the different strands of the texture, regulated by canonic imitation.<br>
<br>Peerson, who was twice married, was buried in St Faith's under St Paul's on 15 January 1651. Among his legacies he left &pound;100 to the poor of March for the purchase of freehold land of the yearly value of &pound;4 or &pound;5, the proceeds to be distributed every Sunday in twopenny loaves to eight, nine, ten, eleven, or twelve poor persons. He held property in the parishes of St Giles-in-the-Fields and Walthamstow, Essex.<br>
