<span class="headword">Joseph,  Michael</span>  (1897&#150;1958), <span class="occ">publisher</span>, was born on 26 September 1897 at 123 Osbaldeston Road, Upper Clapton, Hackney, London, the elder of two sons of Moss Joseph, a diamond merchant, and Rebecca Davis. At eleven Joseph won a London county council scholarship to the City of London School, where he excelled in classics. He left in 1914 and had intended to go on to the University of London but the outbreak of the First World War disrupted this plan. Instead, he joined the University of London Officers' Training Corps and from there volunteered for service in the army. In 1915 he was gazetted to the Wiltshire regiment, and from 1916 to 1919 served as a lieutenant and a captain in the machine-gun corps. He then returned to the University of London to take a part-time course at University College for a diploma in journalism. He did not take the examination, however, as he found the course &#145;sadly academic and hopelessly unpractical&#146;  (M. Joseph, <span class="italic">Journalism for Profit</span>, 1924). By now Joseph had already started writing, and his first book, <span class="italic">Short Story Writing for Profit</span>, to which Stacy Aumonier contributed a foreword, was published in 1923. The directness of the title reflected the book's purposeful nature.<br>
<br>In 1918 Joseph married the actress <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39931/', "Hermione Ferdinanda Gingold (1897&#150;1987)")</script>; they had two sons: Leslie, born in 1919, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/106199/', "Stephen Joseph")</script>, founder of the Stephen Joseph Theatre in the Round in Scarborough. Michael Joseph started working for the literary agents Curtis Brown in 1924 and became a director in 1926. In the same year his first marriage was dissolved and on 11 March he married Edna Victoria Nellie Frost (1899/1900&#150;1949), daughter of Thomas Richard Frost, solicitor. They had a daughter, Shirley, born in 1927, and another son, Richard, born in 1940. Meanwhile, further books followed, among them <span class="italic">The Commercial Side of Literature</span> (1925) and <span class="italic">The Magazine Story</span> (1928). Joseph's lasting love of cats resulted in a quite different work, <span class="italic">Cat's Company</span> (1930).<br>
<br>On 5 September 1935 Joseph founded his own publishing house, Michael Joseph Ltd, as a subsidiary of Victor Gollancz, with Gollancz himself and Norman Collins as directors and Joseph as managing director. The enterprise was highly risky, as it fell in a difficult decade when many established publishers were closing or experiencing financial restraints. In his semi-autobiographical work <span class="italic">The Adventure of Publishing</span> (1949), Joseph recorded that he was one of the few young publishers who held on &#145;by the skin of their teeth&#146;. His firm not only survived but prospered, bringing out books by H. E. Bates and by a number of other well-known authors, among them C. S. Forester's <span class="italic">The General</span> (1936), Monica Dickens's <span class="italic">One Pair of Hands</span> (1939), and Richard Llewellyn's <span class="italic">How Green was my Valley</span> (1939). (Joseph persuaded Llewellyn to change his proposed title, &#145;The land of my fathers&#146;, to something more biblical and nostalgic.) Other authors &#145;discovered&#146; by Joseph include Paul Gallico, Richard Gordon, Vicki Baum, Joyce Cary, and Vita Sackville-West. Relations between Joseph and Gollancz were not always smooth, and the two were quite different in character. Gollancz was &#145;fiery &hellip; arrogant and excitable&#146;, while Joseph was &#145;cool, persuasive, charming and rather cautious&#146;  (Dudley Edwards, 197). Joseph was constrained by Gollancz's economic objectives, and the pair did not agree on many aspects of publishing. Joseph offended Gollancz by accepting &#145;lowbrow&#146; manuscripts such as <span class="italic">Pink and Blue: an Anthology of Babyhood</span>  (ibid.) while he resented Gollancz's interference and criticism. In 1938 Joseph bought Gollancz out when he attempted to censor Sir Philip Gibbs's <span class="italic">Across the Frontiers</span> on political grounds.<br>
<br>Although now a full-time publisher, Joseph continued as a writer. <span class="italic">This Writing Business</span> had already appeared in 1931, while cats resurfaced in two collaborations&#151;<span class="italic">Puss in Books</span> (1932), written with Elizabeth Drew, and <span class="italic">Heads or Tails</span> (1933), with Selwyn Jepson&#151;and in one of his most personal accounts, <span class="italic">Charles: the Story of a Friendship</span> (1943), about his beloved Burmese cat. A play, <span class="italic">Discovery</span>, followed in 1934, the plot centring on a woman who is capable of dreaming the future. In the Second World War, Joseph served as a lieutenant and captain in the Queen's Own Royal Kent regiment from 1940 to 1941. A further book, <span class="italic">The Sword in the Scabbard</span>, came out in 1942, based on Joseph's army experiences in both world wars.<br>
<br>On 15 November 1950, a year after Edna's death, Joseph married Anthea Esther Hodson (1924&#150;1981), his secretary and later a publisher, the daughter of Lord Justice Hodson, a High Court judge [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31211/', "Joseph, Anthea Esther")</script>]. They had two children, Charlotte in 1952 and Hugh in 1954, and settled at Brown's Farm, Old Basing, Hampshire.<br>
<br>Joseph was a member of the Savage Club and president of the Siamese Cat Society of the British Empire. He gave his recreation in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> as cats, but they were really much more than that. A heavy smoker from boyhood, Michael Joseph died of heart failure and a perforated duodenal ulcer on 15 March 1958 at 20 Devonshire Place, Marylebone, London. His business was plunged into a crisis that culminated in the resignation of most of the board. Only Anthea Joseph remained, together with one other director, and it was largely thanks to her determination that its reputation was restored.<br>
