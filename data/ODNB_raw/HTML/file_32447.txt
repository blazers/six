<span class="headword">Cleworth,  Thomas Ebenezer</span>  (1854&#150;1909), <span class="occ">religious educationist</span>, eldest survivor of the seven sons and five daughters of Enoch Cleworth of Tyldesley, near Manchester, and Mary Sykes of Heywood, was born at Westminster on 2 April 1854, his father at that date being a London city missionary. Cleworth was educated at the West Ham Pelly Memorial School, and was for some years a teacher there. About 1871 he began mission work under the Evangelisation Society and attached himself to the American missioner D. L. Moody, for whom he addressed meetings in Dublin and Cork. In 1874 his health broke down. In 1879 he entered St John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated as a passman in 1882. He was stroke of one of the college boats. Ordained deacon and priest in 1881, he served in the Cambridge long vacations as curate of Kirk German, Isle of Man.<br>
<br>In 1882 Cleworth joined the staff of the Church Parochial Mission Society under Canon Hay Aitken, and in 1884, on the nomination of the trustees, he became vicar of St Thomas, Nottingham. In the same year he married Edith Annie, daughter of Alfred Butterworth JP, of Oldham and Andover. Cleworth's father-in-law presented him in 1888 to the rectory of Middleton, Lancashire. In 1899 Dr James Moorhouse, bishop of Manchester, created him rural dean of Middleton and Prestwich, and in 1902 an honorary canon of Manchester. At Middleton he organized many missions and &#145;instruction services&#146; held after the Sunday evening service in Lent. His parochial schools, on which he spent much time as well as money, were of unusual efficiency. The renovation of the parish church was another focus of Cleworth's endeavours, and the chancel was restored in his memory after his death.<br>
<br>Convinced that the efficiency of church life ultimately depended on the schools, Cleworth actively devoted himself to educational controversy, especially resisting, during the discussion of the <span class="roman">Education Bill</span> of 1902, every proposal to diminish the absolute control of the church over the religious teaching of its schools. In November 1903 he formed the Church Schools Emergency League, for the maintenance of church schools as such and of religious education by church teachers and clergy in school and church during school hours. Cleworth acted as secretary and treasurer of the league, which opposed with effect much of the Board of Education's policy touching church schools, and attacked the passive attitude of the National Society. Ultimately Cleworth's policy, while maintaining the <i>status quo</i> of the church schools, claimed that church teaching should be given in council schools by a church teacher on the staff, with parallel rights for nonconformists. He was a member of the Middleton local education authority, a member of the standing committee of the National Society, and a leader of the &#145;no surrender&#146; party in 1906; he was largely responsible for the great demonstrations in Lancashire and London against the Liberal government's <span class="roman">Education Bill</span> of 1906, which the House of Lords rejected. A constant speaker throughout the country, he compiled the first eighty-four leaflets of the Emergency League (which were afterwards bound in seven volumes), besides contributing largely to the Manchester and London press, including <span class="italic">The Times</span> and the <span class="italic">Church Family Newspaper</span>. He published a volume on the education crisis in 1906 jointly with the Revd John Wakeford. Cleworth died on 5 April 1909 at Middleton rectory, Lancashire. &#145;In days of fluid convictions and wavering beliefs Canon Cleworth was pre-eminently &#147;justus ac tenax propositi vir&#148;&#146;  (Dr Knox, bishop of Manchester, in <span class="italic">Manchester Diocesan Magazine</span>, May 1909). He was survived by his wife, two sons, and two daughters.<br>
