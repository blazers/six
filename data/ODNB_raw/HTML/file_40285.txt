<span class="headword">Bannerman,  John Macdonald</span>, Baron Bannerman of Kildonan  (1901&#150;1969), <span class="occ">politician and rugby player</span>, was born at 71 Seymour Street, Crossmyloof, Glasgow, on 1 September 1901, the son of John Roderick Bannerman (<i>d</i>. 1938), who was originally from South Uist, and his wife, Mary Macdonald (<i>d</i>. 1914/15), whose family came from the Isle of Skye. His paternal great-grandfather's family had been evicted from the Strath of Kildonan during the highland clearances. He grew up in the highland community of Glasgow, where Gaelic was the native tongue, and to all intents and purposes he regarded himself as a highlander. His father had begun his working life as a telegraph boy, but after studying at evening classes rose through the clerical ranks of the General Post Office to become its superintendent in Glasgow, in charge of several hundred men. After the mother's death when he was thirteen, Bannerman's father, who had a great knowledge of Gaelic songs and literature and organized Gaelic cultural activities in Glasgow, was a major influence on him.<br>
<br>Bannerman was educated at Shawlands Academy until the age of thirteen and then at Glasgow high school, where he was captain of the rugby football fifteen (1919&#150;20), before studying at Glasgow University; there he graduated MA and BSc in agriculture in 1926. He then spent three years on a scholarship as a postgraduate in agricultural economics, first at Balliol College, Oxford (1927&#150;9), where he was a rugby blue, and then in the USA (1929&#150;30), mainly at Cornell University.<br>
<br>During the 1920s Bannerman was a celebrated international rugby player. A second-row forward weighing nearly 13 stone, with &#145;sturdy legs and well muscled shoulders&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 57), he won thirty-seven consecutive caps between 1921 and 1929 and was on the winning side on twenty-five occasions. This included the golden period for Scottish rugby in the mid-1920s, when Scotland won the triple crown in 1925; in that season he played in the inaugural match at Murrayfield in which Scotland beat England for the first time since 1912. In all he made nine appearances in the Calcutta cup against England, captaining Scotland in 1929. Throughout his rugby career, in which he later became president of the Scottish Rugby Football Union, he was a strong proponent of the amateur ethos, believing strongly that the game should be primarily for players rather than spectators.<br>
<br>In 1930 Bannerman became farm manager, and then factor, to James Graham, sixth duke of Montrose, the father of his Oxford friend the marquess of Graham, with the responsibility of managing the Graham estates around Loch Lomond. On 8 October 1931 he married Jenny Murray (Ray) Mundell (<i>b</i>. 1906/7), the daughter of Walter Mundell of Dalchork near Lairg in Sutherland; they had two sons and two daughters. Bannerman and Montrose were close, and their politics blended. They were Scottish patriots, though not of the republican and separatist kind found in the nationalist organizations of the late 1920s. Both had a liberal outlook, even though the duke took the tory whip in the House of Lords until 1936. It was the duke's involvement with the Scottish Party (formed in 1932 as a right-wing devolutionist counterweight to the more left-wing and separatist National Party of Scotland) that brought Bannerman into active politics. As Montrose's right-hand man, he took part in the public meetings and negotiations that eventually led to the creation of the Scottish National Party in 1934, and campaigned for John MacCormick, the party's leading figure, at Inverness-shire at the general election of 1935.<br>
<br>Like the duke of Montrose, Bannerman grew disillusioned with nationalist politics in the 1930s as interminable arguments about policy and strategy, coupled with poor discipline and organization, blocked electoral progress. Both men ended up in the Liberal Party, Bannerman being adopted as prospective candidate for the Conservative-held seat of Argyll in 1938. When a by-election for the seat arose in 1940, Conservatives in Argyll held out the prospect that he might run as a National Liberal, but negotiations broke down and he decided not to contest the election. At the general election of 1945 he stood for Argyll as a Liberal but came a poor third behind the Conservatives and Labour, a result which was repeated when he stood for the combined Scottish universities at a by-election in 1946. He was unsuccessful in four contests for Inverness (1950, 1954, 1955, and 1959), though he pushed up the Liberal vote (in 1955 he cut the Conservative majority to below 1000) and established a credible Liberal presence in the constituency. He narrowly failed to win Paisley against Labour at a by-election in 1961, but was defeated by an increased margin when he stood for the same seat at the general election of 1964, his final electoral contest.<br>
<br>Bannerman was chairman of the Scottish Liberal Party between 1956 and 1965, presiding over a period of improved fortunes for the organization. He did much to reinforce a distinctive identity for the party north of the border. Following his lead, the party reaffirmed its commitment to Scottish home rule at a time when both the tories and Labour opposed devolution. He was also keen to promote rural issues and highlight the concerns of small-town Scotland. Stress was laid on the need to have good candidates familiar with the locality where they were standing. The strategy paid dividends as, during his period as chairman, the Liberal Party in Scotland increased the number of parliamentary seats which it contested from five to twenty-six, while the number of its MPs rose from one to five, and its membership was boosted. In 1965 he became joint president of the party.<br>
<br>Bannerman ceased to be the duke of Montrose's factor in 1952 in order to concentrate on his own farming interests. He was appointed OBE in 1952 for his services to the Festival of Britain. In 1957 he was elected rector of Aberdeen University. A member of the Forestry Commission from 1942 to 1957 and an active commentator on highland affairs (he was president of An Comunn Galdhealach, the highland association of Scotland), he helped to promote the Highlands and Islands Development Board, which was established in 1965. He broadcast Gaelic programmes on BBC Scotland, regularly appeared on the radio discussion programme <span class="italic">Matter of Opinion</span>, and took part in fireside ceilidhs on Scottish television.<br>
<br>In December 1967 Bannerman was created a life peer. He used his position in the House of Lords to promote Scottish home rule and the welfare of the highlands and rural communities. One controversial issue was his refusal to vote with the Liberal Party for the renewal of sanctions against Rhodesia, as his old Oxford friend, now the seventh duke of Montrose, was a member of Ian Smith's cabinet. He died at Tidworth, Hampshire, on 10 May 1969. His daughter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/100054/', "(Janet) Ray Michie (1934&#150;2008)")</script> became a leading Scottish Liberal politician, and was herself made a life peer in 2001.<br>
