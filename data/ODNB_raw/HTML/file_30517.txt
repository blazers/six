<span class="headword">Badcock, Sir  Alexander Robert</span>  (1844&#150;1907), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born at Wheatleigh, Taunton, on 11 January 1844, was third son of Henry Badcock JP (<i>d</i>. 1888) of Wheatleigh, and Georgina <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jeffries. His father's family had long been connected with a bank in Taunton. Educated at Elstree School, Harrow School, and Addiscombe College, he was commissioned ensign on 1 October 1861, and promoted lieutenant on 1 October 1862 and captain on 1 October 1873. He married in 1865 Theophila Lowther, daughter of John Shore Dumergue of the Indian Civil Service, judge, of Aligarh. They had four sons, all of whom entered the army, and a daughter.<br>
<br>After a brief period of duty with the 38th regiment and then with the 29th Bengal native infantry, Badcock entered in 1864 the commissariat department, in which he remained until 1895, achieving notable success and rising to the post of commissary-general-in-chief in December 1890. In his three earliest campaigns, Bhutan (1864&#150;5), the Black Mountain expedition (1868), and Perak (1875&#150;6), he attracted notice for his organization, winning the thanks of government. He was principal commissariat officer under Sir Frederick Roberts in the Kurram field force (1878&#150;9), taking part in the forcing of the Paiwar Pass and other actions. Returning from furlough when operations were resumed, he joined the Kabul field force, and owing to his careful preparations Roberts found in Sherpur, when it was invested, supplies for men stored for nearly four months and for animals for six weeks. Badcock also assisted in recovering the guns abandoned near Bhagwana. When the Kabul-Kandahar field force, consisting of 9986 men and eighteen guns with 8000 followers and 2300 horses and mules, started on 9 August 1880 he relieved Roberts's &#145;greatest anxiety&#146;, and the force reached Kandahar, 313 miles from Kabul, on 31 August with a margin of supplies. For these services he received the brevets of major and lieutenant-colonel, and the CB. Roberts reported to government that he knew of no officer so well qualified to be placed at the head of the commissariat in the field. He was promoted brevet colonel on 2 March 1885, major-general on 1 April 1897, and lieutenant-general on 3 April 1900.<br>
<br>In 1885 Badcock collected transport for the Sudan campaign, and in 1895 was created a CSI and received the thanks of government for his services in connection with the Chitral relief force. He was appointed quartermaster-general in India on 7 November 1895. He also acted as secretary in the military department (1890&#150;91) and was president of a committee to consider the grant of compensation for the expense of provisions (October 1894). On his retirement at the expiration of his term of office as quartermaster-general in 1900, he took an active part in the organization of the imperial yeomanry for service in the South African War, and was appointed member of the Council of India, receiving on 26 June 1902 the KCB. He died at his home, 44 Grosvenor Road, Westminster, London, on 23 March 1907, while still holding that office, and was buried at Taunton.<br>
