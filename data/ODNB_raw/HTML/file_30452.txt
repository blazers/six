<span class="headword">Armstrong,  William</span>  (1882&#150;1952), <span class="occ">actor and theatre producer</span>, was born at Edinburgh on 30 November 1882, the eldest son of John Armstrong, a grocer, and his wife, Annie Tait. Descended from schoolmasters and ministers, young William was brought up to be a devout Baptist and a teetotaller, and as raconteur and humorist would recall singing at Band of Hope concerts: &#145;When the wine around you is passing, Have courage, my boy, to say No&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Leaving Heriot's School at fourteen, he studied music at Edinburgh University with help from the Carnegie Trust. He wanted to be a schoolmaster. He passed his first professional examination for the degree of MusB, but musical theory chilled him. He turned to the theatre. With J. M. Barrie as president he founded the university dramatic club and he also joined an amateur dramatic society. From the sixpenny gallery of the Lyceum Theatre he saw the best players on tour&#151;Sir Henry Irving, Herbert Beerbohm Tree, and Ellen Terry. After years as a schoolmaster Armstrong turned at twenty-six to professional acting. He joined Frank Benson's Shakespearian company at Stratford upon Avon as Jamy in <span class="italic">Henry V</span>.<br>
<br>Tall, willowy, with reddish fair hair and a Scottish accent, young Armstrong cut an impressive figure. His charm and humour were to win him many friends. He made his London d&eacute;but with Tree's company at His Majesty's in 1909 as Cinna in <span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span>, and after touring Germany with an English troupe he went back to Scotland for two seasons with Alfred Wareing's newly formed Glasgow repertory company, inspired by Annie Horniman's pioneering venture at Manchester. Back in London after a tour of the United States in Arnold Bennett's play <span class="italic">Milestones</span>, Armstrong partnered Madge McIntosh in a short one-acter, <span class="italic">The Music Cure</span> (Little Theatre, 1914), written for them by G. B. Shaw. The work was subtitled &#145;a piece of utter nonsense&#146;, but it was also seen in a London variety bill. That year Armstrong found sterner Shavian stuff as leading man at Liverpool repertory theatre. This was the start of a long and distinguished career, first as leading man and later as artistic director, at what became, with Armstrong at the helm, the country's most successful repertory theatre. He joined the theatre at a low point in its fortunes, as a member of a so-called &#145;commonwealth of actors&#146; formed to keep it going during the First World War. It provided him with more substantial Shavian parts than the absurd Lord Reginald Fitzambey. He played Marchbanks in <span class="italic">Candida</span>, Dubedat in <span class="italic">The Doctor's Dilemma</span>, and Hjalmar in Ibsen's <span class="italic">The Wild Duck</span>. He was also in two Galsworthy plays, one of which took him back to London with the company at the Kingsway for a season in 1915.<br>
<br>Armstrong was a busy actor at this time, not only at Liverpool and in the West End but also touring army camp theatres. In J. B. Fagan's company he played Aguecheek in <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span> and Crabtree in <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span>, and at the prestigious Everyman in Hampstead he played Octavius in <span class="italic">Man and Superman</span>. It was, however, his partnering of Mrs Pat Campbell in a tour of <span class="italic">Hedda Gabler</span> that in 1922 brought his acting career to a climax&#151;he beguiled listeners for years afterwards with memories of acting opposite the <i>monstre sacr&eacute;</i>&#151;and which launched him as an incomparable, influential, and much-loved director at what became the best repertory theatre in the country, the Liverpool Playhouse.<br>
<br>Unlike other repertory theatres, which depended on wealthy men such as Barry Jackson at Birmingham to run them or settled for the scramble of a weekly change of bill, Liverpool repertory theatre was owned by 1500 shareholders and it had 900 seats to fill nightly. Armstrong's regime ran from 1922 until 1941. With Maud Carpenter, his business manager, Armstrong was delighted to be able to pursue his own policy without having to consider what he called &#145;the jungle&#146; (the West End), beyond choosing whatever he fancied from London successes, or even failures if he thought that Liverpool would enjoy them, and restaging them for at least three weeks, and sometimes longer. Impulsive, sentimental, and generous, yet also shrewd, cautious, and businesslike, Armstrong was never tempted to impose his view of the play on the company as an intellectual might have done. It was his personality, his sense of humour, and above all his ability to create an affable atmosphere that brought him such success.<br>
<br>&#145;Steering firmly between the merely popular and the rashly adventurous&#146;, as Grace Wyndham Goldie, historian of the Playhouse, put it, Armstrong had what she called an &#145;almost overtender regard for the feelings of his company and of his staff&#146;  (Rowell and Jackson, 59). His zest and thoughtfulness kept rehearsals lively and entertaining. Actors had a loose rein as long as they remained in tune with the author's ideas and the other performers. &#145;When things are critical&#146;, wrote Wyndham Goldie in her history, &#145;he is at his best &hellip; soothing anybody who is ruffled; insinuating criticisms so that they do not sting; reassuring the nervous with praise; treating every crisis with humour&#146;  (Goldie, 202). Every season showed a profit. Playhouse audiences could count on a much better performance than a touring company could give. If the theatre did not achieve a new school of dramatic writing as was originally hoped&#151;and as Miss Horniman had achieved at Manchester&#151;many actors of the day owed their later eminence to Armstrong and the Liverpool Playhouse: Michael Redgrave, Rex Harrison, Diana Wynyard, Robert Donat, Cecil Parker, Harry Andrews, Herbert Lomas, Hugh Williams, Robert Flemyng, and Judy Campbell.<br>
<br>Before the 1941 season began German air raids forced the Playhouse to close. It later housed the exiled Old Vic Company. Armstrong became chief inspector of the Entertainments National Service Association at Drury Lane Theatre (1941&#150;2), and he was much in demand for the West End, where he directed Edith Evans in <span class="italic">The Rivals</span> and <span class="italic">Old Acquaintance</span>, John Gielgud in <span class="italic">The Circle</span>, Flora Robson in <span class="italic">A Man about the House</span>, Michael Redgrave in <span class="italic">Uncle Harry</span>, Pamela Brown in <span class="italic">Claudia</span>, and Dorothy Hyson in <span class="italic">Pink String and Sealing Wax</span>. He was back in the jungle. The West End was &#145;getting me down&#146;, he wrote to a colleague, the director Norman Marshall.<blockquote>My heart has always been in repertory and the theatre with a definite policy. I have had some unhappy experiences producing plays with stars who shall be nameless &hellip; In spite of the arduous work at Liverpool &hellip; it was the greatest and happiest experience of my life. I love working with young people, and moulding them into potential stars. There is a lovely spirit of adventure and excitement in repertory which one never gets elsewhere. (Marshall, 200)</blockquote>Armstrong moved out of the jungle in 1945. He returned to the provinces, which were later to be renamed the regions and officially subsidized, as assistant to Barry Jackson at Birmingham repertory theatre; he later took over as director. He was appointed CBE in 1951. As the editor of volumes of one-acters, Armstrong collaborated on two full-length plays: <span class="italic">The King of the Castle</span> with A. P. Herbert and <span class="italic">The Furnace</span> with Francis Brett Young. He died, unmarried, on 5 October 1952 at his home near Birmingham, 176 Oak Tree Lane, Bournville.<br>
