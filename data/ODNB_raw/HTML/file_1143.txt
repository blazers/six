<span class="headword">Baker,  William</span>  (1668&#150;1732), <span class="occ">bishop of Norwich</span>, was born on 20 December 1668 at Ilton, Somerset, the second, but first surviving, son of William Baker, vicar of Ilton (<i>d</i>. 1708), and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Baker (<i>fl</i>. 1666&#150;1683). He was educated first at Crewkerne School, and entered Wadham College, Oxford, in 1686. Baker is said to have &#145;lived freely in his youth and spoilt a good natural constitution&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diaries of Thomas Wilson</span>, 83). He was made fellow of Wadham in 1693, and was granted his DD in 1707 despite an attempt, possibly by Thomas Hearne, to block the degree  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 2.26). In 1719 he was elected warden of Wadham College; the election caused a stir, with stories of bribery and the spectacular contrition, and then madness, of John Leaves, the fellow whose vote turned the election.<br>
<br>Baker was successively rector of St Ebbe's in Oxford, Padworth in Berkshire, and, from 1712 to 1715, Bladon in Oxfordshire&#151;all three in the Oxford diocese. In 1715 he was collated to the archdeaconry of Oxford; during the same year he was made rector of St Giles-in-the-Fields, London, an incumbency which he held until his death. In September 1715 Baker had become a chaplain-in-ordinary to George I; he was deprived of a journey with the king to Hanover in 1722, but was made bishop of Bangor in 1723, and translated to Norwich in 1727. During his brief tenure of the see of Bangor he managed to make his only brother, Nicholas, treasurer of the church there; and his two nephews, John Baker and William Baker, were provided for by being made joint registrars of the diocese of Norwich.<br>
<br>Four of Baker's sermons were published, all demonstrating his strong whig principles, for which he earned the opprobrium of several tories. Dr William King included Baker in his list of whig churchmen &#145;who preach up Comprehension, Moderation &hellip; Occasional Conformity, Resistance &hellip; and all the detestable doctrines of Forty-one&#146;  (King, <span class="italic">Works</span>, 2.217); the earl of Oxford, in 1732, thought him &#145;a most worthless wretch&#146;  (<span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 6.156). Thomas Hearne, his erstwhile Oxford opponent, although allowing that he was &#145;a very personable man&#146;, and had been a &#145;great Tutor&#146; at Wadham College, called him a &#145;stinking Whigg&#146;, and &#145;a man of but little learning&#146; who, &#145;tho' a great drinker, was grown so miserably covetous and sordid at the last, as not to allow himself hardly necessaries&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 7.11; 11.137, 139). Baker died, unmarried, at Bath on 4 December 1732 and was buried in the abbey there.<br>
