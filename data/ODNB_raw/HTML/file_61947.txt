<span class="headword">Bell,  Ronald Percy</span>  (1907&#150;1996), <span class="occ">physical chemist</span>, was born on 24 November 1907 at Willowfield, Court House Road, Maidenhead, Berkshire, the eldest child of Edwin Alfred Bell (<i>d</i>. 1954) and his wife, Beatrice Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ash (<i>d</i>. 1929), elementary school teachers. He had a younger brother and an adopted younger sister. He was educated at Gordon Road School, Maidenhead, where his father was headmaster; Maidenhead County Boys' School, where he was influenced by Frank Sherwood Taylor; and Balliol College, Oxford, where he read chemistry under the tuition of H. B. Hartley. His Balliol open scholarship was won at the precocious age of sixteen. In 1927 he was awarded the Gibbs scholarship (<i>proxime accessit</i> 1926), and in 1928 he took a first-class honours degree. At Hartley's suggestion he then went to work with J. N. Br&oslash;nsted in Copenhagen, and spent four years there, with senior studentships from Oxford University (1928&#150;30) and the Goldsmiths' Company (1930&#150;32).<br>
<br>Association with Br&oslash;nsted determined the main line of Bell's future research: reaction kinetics in solution, especially acid-base catalysis. During his career he published more than 200 scientific papers and three important monographs: <span class="italic">Acid-Base Catalysis</span> (1941); <span class="italic">The Proton in Chemistry</span> (1959); and <span class="italic">The Tunnel Effect in Chemistry</span> (1980). His main achievement was to sharpen understanding over the whole range of reactions involving proton transfer. An ingenious experimentalist, for example using a tape recorder to follow fast reactions, he was also a perceptive theoretician, introducing the quantum mechanical tunnelling concept into chemistry. Languages came easily to him, and he was proficient in many: he translated three major physical chemistry books from Danish and one from German. On 16 April 1931 he married Margery Mary (1905&#150;1999), only daughter of Cornelius West, retired builder, of Maidenhead, and his wife, Elizabeth Martha, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Last; they had one son, born in 1936.<br>
<br>Hartley arranged for Bell to take over the physical chemistry teaching at Balliol in 1932, and in 1933 he was elected to a tutorial fellowship. His teaching methods were anachronistic, following Hartley's in starting with essays on the accurate determination of atomic weights. This drew caustic comment from his students, but did them no harm&#151;at least ten of them were elected later to the Royal Society. When H. C. Longuet-Higgins produced a speculative essay proposing a novel hydrogen-bridged structure for diborane, then a major conundrum, the idea was refined under Bell's guidance, and published jointly while Longuet-Higgins was still a second-year undergraduate.<br>
<br>In the 1930s Bell was involved in helping academic refugees from Hitler. During the war he worked half time on Scandinavian intelligence analysis&#151;mostly involving the study of newspapers, but including the debriefing of escapees, one of whom was Niels Bohr, in 1943. His scientific interests became increasingly theoretical at this time, and he initiated a collaboration with C. A. Coulson, who was then in Dundee. This led to Coulson's migration to Oxford in 1945, and was the seed from which the Oxford school of theoretical chemistry grew.<br>
<br>After the war Bell held many appointments in the university, on government bodies, and in learned societies, most notably the presidency of the Faraday Society (1956). In Balliol he chaired the committee which planned the Balliol&#150;St Anne's Graduate Institution (opened in 1967), the first venture into co-education by any of the traditional Oxford colleges. Historian Christopher Hill was elected master of Balliol in 1965 by a very narrow majority over Bell, who was appointed the first vice-master of the college. Two years later, however, he left to become professor of chemistry at the University of Stirling. The parting with Balliol was amicable: he was elected to an honorary fellowship. Although he enjoyed helping to build up a new university, his later years at Stirling were marred by student unrest, which caused him a lot of worry because he was a member of the disciplinary appeals committee.<br>
<br>Ronnie Bell was a small man, bespectacled, with somewhat prominent ears, trim in figure and in dress; he had a taste for good cigars, a discerning ear for music, and a love of hill-walking, especially in the Lake District, where he and his wife had a second home by Buttermere. He invariably expressed himself with precision, and was a stickler for accuracy in others, but he had an impish sense of humour. Elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1944, he acquired many distinctions, but was inclined to be self-effacing. He had abandoned plans to submit for a Copenhagen doctorate on election to his Balliol fellowship, and so for the greater part of his career stood out on official lists as a splendid oxymoron: &#145;<i>Mr</i> R. P. Bell <i>FRS</i>&#146;.<br>
<br>On retirement from Stirling in 1975 Bell moved to Leeds, where he was an honorary research professor of the university from 1976 to 1990. He had a disabling stroke on 30 October 1991, and died on 9 January 1996 at the Kingston Nursing Home in Leeds. He was cremated on 22 January at Lawnswood, Leeds.<br>
