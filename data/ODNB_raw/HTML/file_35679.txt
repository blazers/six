<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Rathbone,  William</span>  (1819&#150;1902), <span class="occ">merchant and philanthropist</span>, was born in Liverpool on 11 February 1819, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23161/', "William Rathbone (1787&#150;1868)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23160/', "Rathbone, William (1757&#150;1809)")</script>] and his wife, Elizabeth Rathbone, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Greg (1789/90&#150;1882). After passing through schools at Gateacre, Cheam, and Everton he was apprenticed (1835&#150;8) to Nicol, Duckworth &amp; Co., Bombay merchants, in Liverpool. In October 1838 he went with Thomas Ashton (1818&#150;1898), the father of Baron Ashton of Hyde, for a semester at the University of Heidelberg. From Heidelberg he toured Italy (1839), and on his return obtained a clerkship in the London firm of Baring Brothers. In April 1841 the senior partner, Joshua Bates, took him on a business tour to the United States; the impression of this visit and two later ones made him a committed free-trader.<br>
<br>At the end of 1841 Rathbone became a partner in his father's firm, Rathbone Brothers &amp; Co., which was then at a low point in its fortunes; by 1842 its capital had fallen to &pound;40,000. With his brother Samuel Greg Rathbone, who became a partner in 1847, he rebuilt the firm's position and diversified its operations, expanding the range of commodities handled, establishing branch houses in China and an agency in New York, increasing its consignment business, and building up a fleet of clippers. Although William Rathbone withdrew from active management of the firm after his entry into parliament, just as it was reaching the height of its prosperity, his partners continued to rely on his advice, especially during financial crises in the 1880s and 1890s. On 6 September 1847 he married Lucretia Wainwright Gair, the eldest daughter of his former partner at Baring Brothers, Samuel Gair; the couple had four sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Rathbone's high ideals of public duty were formed under the influences of his mother, Elizabeth Greg, the daughter of Samuel Greg of Quarry Bank and an authority on school management, and of John Hamilton Thom, minister of the Renshaw Street Unitarian Church in Liverpool, who had married his sister Hannah in 1838. Convinced that wealth was a &#145;trust&#146;, Rathbone determined at an early age to devote an ever-increasing proportion of his income to public objects. Three causes in particular absorbed his attention. First, he was closely concerned with the relief of poverty and the organization of philanthropic efforts in his native town. He worked as a collector for the District Provident Society from 1849, thus gaining some insight into the living conditions of the poor; he helped to raise and administer the &pound;100,000 that Liverpool contributed to the Cotton Famine Relief Fund in 1862&#150;3; he served on the executive of the Liverpool Central Relief and Charity Organization Society; and he was a member of the Liverpool select vestry from 1867 until his death. In his best-known work, <span class="italic">Social duties: Considered in Reference to the Organisation of Effort in Works of Benevolence and Public Utility</span> (1867), he denounced &#145;the desultory nature of much of our charity&#146;, and argued that philanthropic efforts must both be better organized and serve to rebuild &#145;relations of personal kindness and friendly intercourse&#146; between rich and poor. In 1871 and again in 1887 he persuaded the Local Government Board to investigate the system prevalent in Elberfeld and some German towns whereby volunteer almoners accepted responsibility for administering poor relief; while there was little national enthusiasm for this system, in the late 1880s he convinced the Liverpool Central Relief Society to set up district committees and enlist volunteer &#145;friendly visitors&#146; to investigate and manage cases.<br>
<br>Rathbone had greater success in a second field of endeavour, the establishment of district nursing. His first experiment in this area arose out of personal tragedy&#151;the death, on 27 May 1859, of his wife. Having witnessed the extent to which skilled nursing had eased her suffering, he engaged Mary Robinson, the nurse who had attended her, to work in the homes of the poor. Convinced of the extent of the need, and after consultation with Florence Nightingale, he established the Liverpool Training School and Home for Nurses, which began work on 1 July 1862. By the end of 1865 Liverpool had been divided into eighteen districts, each provided with nursing under the superintendence of ladies who made themselves responsible for expenses; for about a year Rathbone himself took the place of one of the superintendents during her absence. Rathbone also achieved the reform of nursing in the workhouses, by securing in 1865 the invaluable services of Agnes Elizabeth Jones (1832&#150;1868). For three years he bore the entire expenses. His nursing reforms were extended to Birmingham and Manchester, and to London in 1874, when the National Association for Providing Trained Nurses was formed, with Rathbone as chairman of its subcommittee for organizing district nursing. In 1888&#150;9 he was honorary secretary, and subsequently vice-president, of Queen Victoria's Jubilee Institute for Nurses, to which the queen had devoted &pound;70,000 out of the women's offering. In his work with district nursing he was greatly assisted by his second wife, Emily Acheson Lyle (1832&#150;1918), the daughter of Acheson Lyle of Londonderry (and a second cousin), whom he married on 6 February 1862, and with whom he had two daughters and four sons.<br>
<br>Rathbone also played a large part in efforts to improve educational provision. He helped to found the University College of Liverpool, which was opened in January 1882; with his two brothers he endowed the King Alfred chair of modern literature and English language; and he was president of the college from 1892. In addition he was very active in the movement for establishing the University College of North Wales (opened in October 1884), of which he was president from 1891. He was actively concerned in the <span class="roman">Welsh Intermediate Education Act</span> of 1889. Liverpool gave him the freedom of the city on 21 October 1891. In May 1895 he was made LLD by Victoria University.<br>
<br>The Rathbones were one of Liverpool's pre-eminent Liberal families: William's father and two brothers all served on the city council. His own political activity began in 1852, when he organized the Liberal election campaign in the north end of the city; subsequently he became chairman of the local party. Gladstone's election in 1865 for South Lancashire owed much to his energy. In November 1868 he was elected as one of the three members for Liverpool. Among other matters he took part in shaping the <span class="roman">Bankruptcy Bill</span> of 1869. He was especially interested in measures for local government, about which he published several essays, and in the licensing laws, opposing prohibition and demanding not more legislation but stricter administration. He sat for Liverpool until 1880, when, after declining to pledge to support the views of the Home Rule Association, he chose to stand aside in Liverpool and instead to contest South-West Lancashire. He was defeated, but was returned in the following November at a by-election for Caernarvonshire; he sat for the county until 1885, and from 1885 for North Caernarvonshire. He remained in the Gladstonian wing of the party, but refused to vote for the third reading of the <span class="roman">Home Rule Bill</span> in 1893. In 1895 Rathbone retired from parliament. He was deputy lieutenant for Lancashire.<br>
<br>Rathbone's contemporaries considered that &#145;straightforwardness and pertinacity, with entire unselfishness&#146;, were the essential features in his character. He lacked the bonhomie and humour of his father, but although his manner was dry, his actions witnessed to his deep humanity. His private correspondence reveals a man deeply devoted to his wife and full of anxious concern for the moral development of his children, several of whom sought to carry on his business, political, and philanthropic interests. His sons William Gair (1849&#150;1919), Thomas Ashton (1856&#150;1895), and Francis Warre (1875&#150;1939) became partners in Rathbone Brothers; his daughter Elizabeth Lucretia (1851&#150;1920) helped with the management of district nursing and became a poor-law guardian; another daughter, Emily Evelyn (1865&#150;1954), and her husband, Hugh Reynolds Rathbone (1862&#150;1940), were greatly concerned with the management of Liverpool University; his son Acheson Lyle (1868&#150;1923) served on the city council. But it was his youngest daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35678/', "Eleanor Rathbone (1872&#150;1946)")</script>, who most resembled him in character, became his assistant and confidante after his retirement from parliament, wrote his biography after his death, and succeeded him as a municipal reformer and in parliament. The conventions of biography seek to isolate individual contributions, but many of Rathbone's projects were collaborative and much of his influence lay in his ability to inspire and organize broader efforts. He died at his home, Greenbank, Toxteth Park, Liverpool, on 6 March 1902, and was buried in Toxteth cemetery.<br>
