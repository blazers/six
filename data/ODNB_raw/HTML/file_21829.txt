<span class="headword">Penda</span>  (<em>d.</em> 655), <span class="occ">king of the Mercians</span>, was the son of Pybba and (at least according to later genealogies) a scion of the Mercian royal dynasty which traced its origin back to Woden. The date at which Penda became king is far from certain. The <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> puts his accession in 626 and notes that his reign lasted thirty years (this last detail is roughly consistent, for he died in 655); it also says that he was fifty years of age when he became king, which seems unlikely and is perhaps a mistake for his age at death. The chronicle goes on to mention a battle which took place at Cirencester in 628 between Penda on the one hand and the West Saxon rulers Cynegils and Cwichelm on the other, after which the combatants &#145;came to terms&#146;; there is reason to think that these terms may have included an acknowledgement of Penda's overlordship over the southern part of the kingdom of the Hwicce (modern Gloucestershire), an area which would appear to have been under West Saxon control since 577. This picture of a flourishing start to Penda's reign is rather dashed by Bede's information about events in 633, when Penda allied with a (Christian) Welsh king, Cadwallon of Gwynedd, for a campaign against Northumbria. At the battle of Hatfield Chase on 12 October the Northumbrian army was routed and King Eadwine was killed, along with one of his sons; another son, Eadfrith, &#145;was compelled to desert to Penda&#146; and later met his death at Penda's hands. It is a problem that Bede appears to date the beginning of Penda's reign to the year of this successful campaign: he states that he was &#145;a most vigorous man from the royal stock of the Mercians, who from that time ruled his people for twenty-two years with varying success&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 2.20). To add to the complication, there is a third source that gives Penda a reign length of only ten years, starting apparently from 642, and which implies that his brother Eowa had been king of the Mercians before this point; this is the <span class="italic">Historia Brittonum</span>, which is a far less authoritative source than Bede and the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span>. It has been sensibly suggested that the key to these seemingly contradictory details about Penda's accession and reign length may be Bede's observation that he ruled &#145;with varying success&#146;; perhaps his reign was interrupted by reverses at various times, so that he had to re-establish his authority. There is also some possibility that Penda may have ruled jointly for some time with his brother Eowa, a situation which could have affected calculations of the length of his reign.<br>
<br>Nine years after dispatching King Eadwine, Penda returned to Northumbria and killed King Oswald at the battle of &#145;Maserfelth&#146;  (Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 3.9); it would seem that it was during this battle that Eowa met his death. Again the Mercian forces appear to have had Welsh support; a Welsh poem which may be as early as the ninth century claims that a king of Powys fought in the battle on Penda's side. These military alliances with the British kingdoms to the west of Mercia may provide some explanation for Penda's extraordinarily successful invasions of other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. He seems to have made several incursions deep into Northumbria: on one occasion (perhaps in the aftermath of his victory at &#145;Maserfelth&#146;) his forces reached as far north as the Northumbrian citadel at Bamburgh, and were only prevented from capturing it by a fortunate miracle  (Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 3.10); and at a later date, some time between 651 and 655, the Mercian army destroyed a church not far from Bamburgh where &Aacute;ed&aacute;n had died  (ibid., 3.17). Yet Penda's relations with Northumbria were not always on a bellicose level. There is a possibility that he helped Oswald's son &AElig;thelwald gain the throne of Deira; certainly &AElig;thelwald was ranged on Penda's side against Oswiu of Northumbria during the Mercian king's final campaign against Northumbria in 655 (his last-minute withdrawal may have contributed to Penda's catastrophic defeat). At some point before 653 Penda married his daughter Cyneburh to Oswiu's son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/286/', "Alchfrith")</script>, and in 653 he allowed his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21682/', "Peada")</script>, to make a reciprocal match with Oswiu's daughter. In Bede's carefully wrought narrative Penda fulfils the role of an implacable pagan warrior-king, who makes apocalyptic descents on vulnerable Christian kingdoms to wreak God's mysterious will and provide opportunities for martyrdom and miracles. But these dramatic episodes were only a facet of his reign; it is clear that he also interacted with neighbouring dynasties and kingdoms in other ways.<br>
<br>Bede's brief notices of Penda's onslaughts on East Anglia give an impression of motiveless aggression. His armies invaded; the East Anglians feared that they would be defeated and so sought to enlist divine support by dragging their saintly former king Sigeberht from his monastery; but both Sigeberht and the current king, Ecgric, were killed. Later Penda also killed the succeeding East Anglian king, Anna. The chronology of East Anglian history in the seventh century is very difficult to establish, but there is reason to think that Anna died in 654. It has been suggested that there could be a connection between this (perhaps second) invasion of East Anglia and Penda's establishment of his son Peada as ruler of the Middle Angles in the early 650s. &#145;Middle Anglia&#146; was a conglomeration of tribes and minor kingdoms located in the east midlands between Mercia proper and East Anglia. Overlordship of this region seems to have been contested between the Mercian and East Anglian rulers, so the appointment of Peada as king may mark Penda's final subjugation of Middle Anglia; certainly after this time the region remained firmly under Mercian control. It seems very likely that Penda's wars with the East Angles were prompted by strategic considerations.<br>
<br>There are some brief details about Penda's relations with the West Saxon rulers to the south. He married his sister to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4996/', "Cenwalh")</script>, who ruled Wessex between 641 and 672; this alliance may perhaps have been arranged about 628, after Penda had fought against Cenwalh's father and brother at Cirencester, and may indeed have formed part of the &#145;terms&#146; agreed by the antagonists. Shortly after Cenwalh's accession he repudiated his wife, prompting an angry Penda to invade and drive him from his kingdom, to take refuge with Anna of the East Angles; after three years' exile Cenwalh returned, apparently without opposition from the Mercian ruler  (Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 3.7). It seems very likely that both the initial repudiation and the insouciant return took place at times when Penda's power was on the wane, eclipsed by a Northumbrian resurgence or by internal difficulties within Mercia. Indeed, Penda's reign may have been punctuated by periods of domination over Southumbria alternating with periods when his influence was limited.<br>
<br>The last episode in Penda's career took place when his star was very much in the ascendant. Backed by a huge army he threatened Oswiu of Northumbria, who was forced to negotiate; at the time Oswiu's son Ecgfrith was a hostage at Penda's court. According to Bede, Oswiu offered the invader vast quantities of treasure if he agreed to return home and stop devastating Northumbria, but Penda refused, supposedly because he was determined to exterminate the whole Northumbrian people. The two forces met on the banks of the River &#145;Winw&aelig;d&#146; (a tributary of the Humber), almost certainly on 15 November 655. Oswiu's army was (allegedly) tiny. Penda, on the other hand, commanded a force which is supposed to have consisted of thirty &#145;legions&#146;, each commanded by a &#145;royal ealdorman&#146;. One of these allies was &AElig;thelhere, king of the East Angles, and another was &AElig;thelwald, sub-king of Deira: it seems that Penda's army included detachments from kingdoms which recognized his authority, and that the &#145;royal ealdormen&#146; leading them would in some instances have been recognized as kings in their own right. Penda's ability to raise such forces under his command is a measure of his dominant position in 655; the clash with Oswiu can probably be understood as a campaign to challenge Northumbrian overlordship over Southumbria (hence Penda's refusal to compromise and his avowed intention of decisively defeating the Northumbrian people). But it was the Mercian king who was defeated and killed at the &#145;Winw&aelig;d&#146;, along with most of his followers. Oswiu occupied Mercia for three years, until a Mercian revolt established Penda's son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30093/', "Wulfhere")</script> as king.<br>
<br>Of Penda's domestic policies in Mercia very little is known, although Bede provides an intriguing insight into his attitude to Christianity. He himself remained a committed pagan, but he allowed Christian missionaries to preach in Mercia, &#145;if anyone wished to listen&#146;  (Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 3.21): it seems unlikely that the priests had much success with the Mercians in the face of their ruler's disapproval, and it was not until after Penda's death that an episcopal structure was established in the midlands. According to Bede, Penda reserved his contempt, not for Christians as such, but for those who had accepted the Christian faith but did not live according to its precepts. It is impossible to discover whether this was indeed Penda's own view, or whether it was Bede's decision to attribute this didactic sentiment to the most celebrated of Anglo-Saxon pagans.<br>
<br>Penda's queen at the time of his death was Cynewise, whose antecedents are unknown. Perhaps with her, or perhaps from an earlier alliance, Penda had at least three sons: Peada, who was ruler of the Middle Angles from 653 until 655, and then very briefly king of the South Mercians under Oswiu's authority; Wulfhere, king of the Mercians from 658 until 675; and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52315/', "&#198;thelred (d. after 704)")</script>, who succeeded Wulfhere. Later tradition also identifies Penda as the father of Merewalh, ruler of the Magons&aelig;te (who lived in the area of modern Shropshire and Herefordshire). Opinions are divided on the validity of this suggestion; if correct, then it may be the case that Penda established Merewalh as sub-king of the western part of the Mercian confederation in the same way that he had made Peada his sub-king in Middle Anglia. One of Penda's daughters, Cyneburh, was married to Alchfrith, son of Oswiu and a Christian. She is supposed to have retired after her husband's death to a minster at Castor in Northamptonshire, where she was buried with her sister Cyneswith; their bodies are said to have been translated to the monastery at Peterborough in 963. A late hagiographical source states that Cyneswith had been married to Offa, king of the East Angles. Two further daughters of Penda are mentioned in hagiographical material connected with St Osgyth of Aylesbury: Wilburh (St Osgyth's mother) and Eadburh (probably the woman of that name associated with a minster at Bicester).<br>
<br>Penda was the last great pagan ruler of Anglo-Saxon England. He is remembered as a military leader of extraordinary effectiveness and a scourge of Christian kingdoms, responsible for the deaths in battle of two successive kings of Northumbria (Eadwine and Oswald), and of three East Anglian rulers (Ecgric, Anna, and the former king Sigeberht); but his greatest achievement seems to have been the establishment of a long-standing Mercian overlordship over the diverse tribes and kingdoms of the west midlands and Middle Anglia.<br>
