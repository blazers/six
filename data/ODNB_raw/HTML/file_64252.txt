<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Henderson,  Nigel Graeme</span>  (1917&#150;1985), <span class="occ">artist and photographer</span>, was born on 1 April 1917 in St John's Wood, London, the second of three children, born in successive years, of Captain Kenneth Henderson, contracting engineer, son of Lord Farringdon, and Winifred (Wyn) Ellen Lester, a former music hall artiste, the illegitimate child of an illegitimate mother. Married in 1915, his parents were divorced in 1924. His mother, an unconventional and creative woman, was to remain an important influence on her son. Henderson attended Stowe School, which he hated, and left after only two years in 1933. His schools, and unhappy holidays at his paternal grandparents' house in Wimbledon, induced a lifelong distaste for upper-class conventionality, and a romantic identification with outsiders. Happier times were spent in his mother's artistic circle in Bloomsbury. Informally adopted by Adrian Stephen, a well-known psychoanalyst, brother of Virginia Woolf, and his wife, Karin Stephen, he stayed frequently with them in Gordon Square and at Landermere Quay in Essex.<br>
<br>In his late teens Henderson pursued an erratic and peripatetic self-education. He joined the Group Theatre, meeting Rupert Doone, Robert Medley, Louis MacNeice, W. H. Auden, Christopher Isherwood, and others. He spent time in the company of scientists, including J. D. Bernal and Solly Zuckermann, and in 1935 he enrolled at Chelsea Polytechnic to study biology. Restless and indecisive, in 1936 he became a junior picture restorer at the National Gallery. He experimented with collage, a sympathetic medium for an obsessive collector of ephemera and discarded objects, and recognized in the collages of John Piper and Julian Trevelyan, and the poetic surrealism of Humphrey Jennings, a sympathetic challenge to aesthetic orthodoxy. His mother's management of the Guggenheim Jeune gallery (1938&#150;40) brought contacts with European artists, including Yves Tanguy, Laurence Vail, and Marcel Duchamp.<br>
<br>In 1939 Henderson joined Coastal Command as a pilot. Alternately exhilarated and terrified by flying, in 1942, after many sorties, he suffered a nervous breakdown and was moved to lighter duties. In 1943 he married (Karin) Judith Stephen (<i>d</i>. 1972), an anthropologist, daughter of Adrian and Karin, and moved with her to Bethnal Green, where they lived and worked (Judith as a social observer and teacher) until 1955, when they moved to Landermere Quay. They had four children. In 1945 Henderson enrolled at the Slade School of Fine Art on a former serviceman's grant. His art studies were haphazard and inconclusive, but it was there he met Eduardo Paolozzi, a formidable friend and collaborator. They shared enthusiasms for science, unregarded ephemera, children's drawings, popular magazines, folk art, and cinema. When Paolozzi left for Paris in 1947, the artist Richard Hamilton became a close companion. The ground was prepared for future collaborations.<br>
<br>After leaving the Slade in 1949, Henderson at last began to find himself as an artist. He started taking the documentary photographs of street life in Bethnal Green that remain among his most enduring work. With Paolozzi he experimented with photograms, placing degraded and unconventional materials (for example, rubbish, coffee grounds, and gouache) directly on to the negative. These he recombined in photo-collages, with what he called &#145;stressed&#146; photographs, to achieve chance expressive effects. From 1951 to 1954 he taught creative photography at the Central School of Arts and Crafts, undertaking at the same time commercial photography for <span class="italic">Vogue</span>, <span class="italic">Architectural Review</span>, and <span class="italic">Flair</span>. Through the 1950s he was an initiating participant in many influential Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) events. In 1951 he showed photograms at the ICA Festival of Britain exhibition &#145;Growth and form&#146;; in 1953 he organized, with Paolozzi and the architects Alison and Peter Smithson, the exhibition &#145;Parallel of life and art&#146;, for which he made several &#145;stressed&#146; photoworks; his contribution, with Paolozzi and the Smithsons, to the influential &#145;This is tomorrow&#146; exhibition in August 1956 was seen as a seminal contribution to the discussion of new brutalism; and he was a founder member, in 1952, of the Independent Group at the ICA, formed to promote interdisciplinary discussion. The relation of art to everyday life, and the environmental integration of architecture, design, technology, and art, were recurring themes in his work. In spite of his own aversion to formal education Henderson became a much admired teacher, at Colchester School of Art from 1957 to 1960, and at Norwich School of Art from 1965 to 1968, and from 1972 (the year of Judith's death) until 1982. His retirement in 1982 was marked by &#145;Heads eye Wyn&#146;, an exhibition of Dada-influenced photomontage images of his own head, an obsessive theme in his later work. In 1983 Henderson remarried; his new wife was Janet Allan (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Murray), a potter and noted amateur gardener. He died on 15 May 1985, survived by his second wife.<br>
