<span class="headword">Payne,  William</span>  (1649/50&#150;1697), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was the son of William Payne of Hutton, Essex. He attended Brentwood Free School, Essex, before being admitted sizar at Magdalene College, Cambridge, in May 1665, aged fifteen. He graduated BA in 1669, proceeding MA in 1672. On 6 July 1671 he became a fellow at Magdalene, and remained so until 1675 when he married Elisabeth Squire, daughter of the vicar of St Leonard, Shoreditch. He was ordained deacon at Ely on 19 March 1671 and priest at Peterborough on 22 September 1672. In 1673 Payne was appointed rector of Wormshill in Kent, to which he added the parish of Frinsted in the same county the following year. In June 1681 he became rector of St Mary, Whitechapel, and quickly established a reputation in London as a fine preacher. Owing to his interest in experimental philosophy he was also in that year admitted as a fellow of the Royal Society. He was granted a DD by Cambridge in 1689.<br>
<br>Payne's first works, published between 1685 and 1688, were a series of tracts against Catholic doctrines such as the adoration of the host, communion under one kind, and the celibacy of priests. All these tracts went through several editions and were subsequently collected in Edmund Gibson's <span class="italic">Preservative Against Popery</span> (1738). Following the revolution of 1688 Payne, a latitudinarian, strongly supported the so-called <span class="roman">Comprehension Bill</span> introduced into parliament in 1689. Thomas Long, however, was undoubtedly speaking for the majority of the clergy when he denounced the bill in his pamphlet <span class="italic">Vox cleri</span> (1690). In <span class="italic">An Answer to &#145;Vox cleri&#146;</span> (1690), Payne replied that far from bringing schismatics into the church comprehension would make dissenters friends; that it was a good thing for the church to make alterations &#145;as she thinks fit, whether the Dissenters propose or agree in them or not&#146;  (p. 7); and that those high-churchmen who threatened to go to Rome were putting too much stock in things indifferent.<br>
<br>Payne also became engaged in the controversy surrounding the oath of allegiance to William and Mary imposed in 1689 upon all beneficed clergy. Those who refused and were deprived of their livings were scathing in their denunciations of those clergy, like Payne, who had been preachers of the doctrine of non-resistance under James II and who were now supporters of the new monarchs. Payne published a defence of himself in 1691 entitled <span class="italic">An answer to a printed letter to Dr William Payne, concerning non-resistance and other reasons for not taking the oath</span>. While admitting that he had indeed preached non-resistance, he had not considered &#145;if any unseen and extraordinary Case should ever happen to be an exception against it&#146;  (p. 18). In the extraordinary case of King James positive law had had to give way to the &#145;greater Law of Necessity&#146;  (p. 10).<br>
<br>Possibly in reward for his support for royal policy and legitimacy after the revolution, in 1689 Payne was appointed lecturer at St Mildred Poultry, London, and chaplain-in-ordinary to William and Mary. In 1690 he was given a commission under the great seal to be visitor-royal over all London churches that were exempt from the jurisdiction of the bishop of London. Its purpose was to suppress clandestine marriages, especially in the notorious centres of St James, Duke's Place, and Holy Trinity Minories. More profitably for Payne he was authorized to appoint his own registrar and issue marriage licences for these places. However, in 1695 Archbishop Tenison and Bishop Compton of London complained of the threat that Payne's commission posed to episcopal jurisdiction and pointed out to the lords justices that he was abusing his position&#151;and depriving the crown of the revenue due to it under the <span class="roman">Marriage Duty Act</span>&#151;by issuing blank licences. The patent was revoked, and Payne failed in his attempts to bargain some compensation for his loss of income, which he estimated at &pound;500 per annum. In 1694 Payne was installed as a prebendary of Westminster.<br>
<br>Payne was also the author of <span class="italic">Family Religion</span> (1691) and <span class="italic">A Discourse of Repentance</span> (1693). A collection of his sermons, <span class="italic">Discourses upon Several Practical Subjects</span> (1698), was published posthumously by Joseph Powell. During the last two years of his life Payne preached a series of sermons on the Trinity in defence of William Sherlock. These sermons were published in 1696 under the title <span class="italic">The Mystery of the Christian Faith and Oft-Blessed Trinity Vindicated</span>. Payne was working on a book on the subject when he died in London on 20 February 1697. He was buried in St Mary, Whitechapel, four days later.<br>
