<span class="headword">Melchebourne,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1356), <span class="occ">merchant and financier</span>, was a native of Bishop's Lynn, for which he sat in the parliaments of 1319, 1328, 1330, 1336, 1337, and 1340, and of which he was mayor in 1338. Between 1319 and the beginning of the Hundred Years' War he is often mentioned in connection with mercantile or administrative affairs. He exported wheat and cloth to Gascony, and wool to Flanders, and his ships also traded with Norway and carried victuals for the king's forces in Scotland. In 1333 he was collector of customs on wine and wool at Bishop's Lynn.<br>
<br>With the beginning of the war in 1337 Melchebourne had other opportunities, and from this time was described as &#145;king's merchant&#146;. In 1336 he and his brother were already building a barge with sixty oars for the king at Bishop's Lynn, and in 1337 he was commissioned to make anchors. In 1338 he was collecting wool for the king in Norfolk, and was again a collector of customs at Bishop's Lynn and deputy chief butler. He purveyed victuals for the king's use, and in 1339 was one of those appointed to collect the moiety of wool in Norfolk. He sent ships carrying the king's envoys to Holland and Zeeland, and was empowered in 1341 both to arrest ships illegally exporting corn to Scotland, and to search for wool exported without payment of customs.<br>
<br>The opportunity for Melchebourne's major step into prominence, in connection with Edward III's financial schemes involving wool export and customs duties, came in 1343. On 2 June Melchebourne was elected mayor of the staple of Bruges by the community of English merchants, a position which he held until at least March 1345. On 8 July the king set up the English Company, replacing the aliens who had hitherto played a large part in war finance, with a moderately large group of merchants, who were entrusted with the farming of the customs and subsidies from midsummer 1343 until Michaelmas 1346. In return they were obliged to pay the wardrobe 1000 marks a month, and also to lend the king 10,000 marks per annum&#151;in all 22,000 marks a year, a sum easily obtainable from the normal yield of customs. Later documents show that the leading member of the English Company was William de la Pole (<i>d</i>. 1366), but he remained in the background, with Melchebourne as the most prominent representative of the company, and Melchebourne was still present when it was reorganized in 1344 as a smaller group of six members. The company did in fact advance more than &pound;60,000 to the crown between 1343 and 1345, but it was wound up in August 1345. Melchebourne was one of those involved in redeeming the king's small crown in 1343, and Queen Philippa's crown in March 1344, after these had been pledged for loans at Cologne.<br>
<br>For the years 1343&#150;5 Melchebourne had been in an absolutely central position in trade with the Netherlands and in war finance. After the winding-up of the company, apparently because it was unable to make the payments required, Melchebourne appears to have retained royal favour. In 1347 the king granted him and his brother three inns at Calais, and in 1349 he was exporting corn to Norway. He died in 1356, when he owned houses at Stokfysshrowe and Briggegate at Bishop's Lynn and land at Melchbourn and Beccles. His wife's name was Johanna, and he had a son, Peter, who also became a prominent merchant, and a daughter, Alice.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_52196"></a><span class="headword">William Melchebourne</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1360<span class="mult">x</span>62?), the brother of Thomas, was also an important merchant of Bishop's Lynn, who was associated with his brother in the business of exporting grain to Norway and wool to the Netherlands, in supplying the royal army's needs for victuals in the north, and as a member of the English Company of 1343. He is also sometimes named independently as carrying out these trading or financial functions. Likewise given the designation of king's merchant, William was appointed weigher of wools in the port of London in 1341, and collector of tunnage at Bishop's Lynn and butler at Boston in 1342. In 1344 he was rewarded for helping to recover the king's great crowns from Flanders, where they had been left as pledges for debts. His brother left him a house in Stokfysshrowe, Bishop's Lynn, for life. William died apparently between December 1360 and May 1362, leaving a widow named Deruegolda and a son, John.<br>
