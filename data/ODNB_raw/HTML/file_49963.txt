<span class="headword">Sargent,  John</span>  (1714&#150;1791), <span class="occ">merchant and politician</span>, was born on 12 June 1714, in St Dunstan-in-the-East parish, London, the younger of the two children of John Sargent (1690&#150;1762), a grocer from Plymouth who had moved to London to become the navy's accountant for stores at Deptford, and his wife, Mary Arnell (<i>b</i>. 1694), the daughter of John Arnell of Plymouth (1658&#150;1703). With their father always on the move with the navy, Sargent and his sister spent their childhood in Lisbon, Sheerness, Chatham, and Deptford, where their father worked as a clerk of the survey. Settling in Deptford in 1729, the Sargents apprenticed their son to the firm of Mary Sargent's first cousin George Arnold (1685&#150;1751), a London linen draper.<br>
<br>In Cheapside, Sargent served an apprenticeship from 1729 to 1735, received the freedom of the City in 1735, and for the next sixteen years traded as Arnold's junior partner. In 1749 he married Rosamund (1722&#150;1792), the daughter of John and Elizabeth Chambers. During the 1740s, Sargent brought to the cloth trade an extensive knowledge of naval supply and a desire to enter new geographical regions such as India and Africa, which were opening up to private traders. Prodded by Sargent, the firm became a large wholesaler of India goods and a large supplier to the Company of Merchants Trading to Africa. In addition the firm provisioned Bance Island, a slave trans-shipment factory in Sierra Leone, which Sargent had purchased with Richard Oswald, John Mill, Augustus and John Boyd, and Alexander Grant in 1748.<br>
<br>After Arnold's death in 1751 Sargent continued the business as Sargent, Birch &amp; Co. and, after 1754, as Sargent, Aufrere &amp; Co. when he joined forces with the Huguenot George Aufrere. Thereafter, Sargent's firms were always marked by a large number of partners, having three or four more partners than the typical London two- or three-man firm of the day. Yet, despite these changes, the basic thrust of enterprise persisted. Secure in the inheritance he had received from Arnold and the growth in his African and Indian business, Sargent pushed into new areas in the 1750s. Company politics was one. In 1753 he was elected to the directorate of the Bank of England and, for the next fifteen years, he helped to manage its affairs. Two years later, when the government decided to reinstate the private provision of packet services between England and the Caribbean, Sargent and Richard Stratton (1704&#150;1759) moved into contracting. Reaching an agreement with the Treasury and General Post Office, they signed formal articles on 6 November 1755. As the contract evolved they furnished five boats to carry the mail between Falmouth in Cornwall and the West Indies. From beginning to end, for eight years, the enterprise earned on average a profit of &pound;785 per month, in addition to the money made from other freight.<br>
<br>National parliamentary service was likewise a draw. In 1753, the same year as he joined the bank, Sargent was introduced to Lord Montagu, the patron of Midhurst, Sussex. After proffering Montagu a much needed loan of &pound;1500, he secured Montagu's recommendation to the constituency. After a contest over the results of the election, Sargent took his seat in the Commons in 1754. In parliament, he cared for the Montagus' business, and he sided with Henry Legge, Thomas Pelham, Thomas Walpole, Charles Yorke, and Richard Stratton, voting with them in support of the government. In 1760, when the Montagus decided to handle their own parliamentary affairs, Sargent found himself without a patron. Unsuccessful in his approaches to the duke of Newcastle and the earl of Bute, he was forced to step down. Not until 1765 did he again take a seat, this time as the representative of West Looe, Cornwall, and with the help of George Grenville. Throughout this term in the house, he remained loyal to Grenville, even after the minister's fall from power in June 1765. He was considered an expert on financial and colonial matters, and used his access to information to apply pressure behind the scenes. He advised administrative departments needing information on the intricacies of commercial practice, like the handling of bills of credit, and served as the agent of both Pennsylvania (1760&#150;66) and New York (1765&#150;6). Ultimately, however, Sargent disliked the work of a party politician and, unwilling to succumb to &#145;the venality of the times&#146;, he voluntarily stepped down in 1768.<br>
<br>The last years of his public service were dominated by a large-scale speculation in American lands, a fitting preoccupation for one of Benjamin Franklin's closest friends in Great Britain. Almost from its inception in 1766, Sargent was involved in the Illinois Company, which came to be called the Walpole Company, a concern for settling lands west of the Appalachian crest which he was lured into by Franklin. It took two years to organize the company and even more time to win a grant for 2.4 million acres. Not until August 1772 did the privy council issue the Walpole Company with an order for establishing such a colony west and south of Pennsylvania, but completion of the project was cut short by American independence.<br>
<br>The American War of Independence shattered Sargent's dreams of overseas speculation, in much the same way as it made his American cloth trade less profitable and attractive. As one of the oldest and most respected merchants in the transatlantic shipping community, Sargent struggled to keep his business intact through the calamitous 1770s, but it was an uphill fight. Before the end of the war, he expected to remain &#145;in the track&#146;, but his plans changed as he began to realize the significance of the geographical shift in transatlantic trade. He wound up his adventures in overseas shipping and turned over the affairs of the firm to his younger partners. He died at Tunbridge Wells on 20 September 1791. His wife died the following year, and was buried alongside him in St Margaret's churchyard, in Halstead. He left his business and one-third of his personal estate to his younger son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64132/', "John Sargent")</script>; the residue he bequeathed to his older son, George.<br>
