<span class="headword">Bonwick,  Theodora Ellen</span>  (1876&#150;1928), <span class="occ">educationist and women's rights activist</span>, was born on 27 December 1876 at 60 Coningham Road, Shepherd's Bush, London, the daughter of William Priessnitz Bonwick, a schoolteacher, and his wife, Sarah, formerly Beddow, an executive member of the Women's Liberal Federation, and a member of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. Like her mother, Theodora undertook temperance work and Sunday school teaching, which she gave up for the suffrage cause. She trained at Stockwell College and obtained a BA degree from the University of London. She taught in London elementary schools and was headteacher of Enfield Road School for Girls in Hackney before the First World War; in the 1920s she became headteacher of York Way Girls' School in King's Cross. Joining the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) in 1905, she was a popular speaker&#151;she spoke at the Woman's Sunday demonstration in Hyde Park on 21 June 1908 and became the secretary of Hornsey WSPU. She was an active campaigner for women's rights in the London Teachers' Association, and was particularly prominent in the movement before the war for equal pay. Even her opponents respected her powers of oratory. The National Union of Teachers (NUT) paper, <span class="italic">The Schoolmaster</span>, declared that her strong speech for equal pay, which was endorsed at a packed meeting in the Royal Albert Hall in 1913, was &#145;undoubtedly the speech of the day&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Schoolmaster</span>, 1913, 710).<br>
<br>Theodora Bonwick joined the London-based Women Teachers' Franchise Union (WTFU) and became its president in 1914. She encouraged the affiliation of teachers' organizations to the Labour Party when the NUT was conducting a referendum on the question, believing that sex distinction was as invidious as class distinction. Like many contemporary feminists and humanitarians, Theodora Bonwick became a theosophist and joined the central London lodge in 1909. A member of the Association for Moral and Social Hygiene, she became a strong advocate of sex education in schools and gained the support of parents to teach this as a class subject in her Enfield Road School. This was the only school in the London county council (LCC) area which undertook such teaching as a class topic. But when she advocated that this subject should be taught throughout LCC schools in her presentation to the LCC inquiry on the teaching of sex hygiene, it was rejected. Believing that sex education was necessary to safeguard the moral and physical health of the nation, she continued to give talks on sexual and moral conduct, particularly to the Women's Suffrage Federation in London's East End. She argued that if young people were given knowledge this would prevent them from being &#145;poisoned by ignorance or impurely minded persons&#146;. In common with the anti-regulationist strand of the social hygiene movement she argued for &#145;self protection&#146; rather than tighter laws. In the 1920s she developed her interest in educating children in moral behaviour through her work as organizer of the cinema group of the London unit of the National Union of Women Teachers (NUWT). She was the only British representative at the second European film conference in The Hague in 1928 and led a deputation to the Cinematograph Exhibitors' Association to encourage the making of healthy, wholesome, amusing, and instructive films for children  (<span class="italic">Woman Teacher</span>, 2 Jan 1928, 75).<br>
<br>Theodora Bonwick supported progressive ideas in education, opposing a competitive spirit in lessons and sports, and introduced the Dalton plan, a form of independent resource-based learning for older pupils, in her York Way school. Although the school's inspector, Dr Hayward, described her as &#145;an enterprising and devoted headteacher&#146;, he was critical of such methods  (TNA: PRO, Ed 21/57031, 1926). She opposed the teaching of domestic science to girls, since this encouraged a feeling of inferiority and trained a girl &#145;to be a household drudge and to spend herself submissively attending to the needs of the men-folk&#146;  (<span class="italic">Woman's Dreadnought</span>, 71). By the 1920s Theodora, like many other feminists, had left the London Teachers' Association and joined the NUWT. She was a member of its central council from 1925 and the incumbent president of the London unit on her death. Friends believed that her early death from heart failure on 10 November 1928 at Woodlands, Crouch End Hill, London, was attributable to a nervous breakdown caused by exhaustion from her political activities. At her request the flowers donated at her cremation at Golders Green crematorium were given to an infirmary, a workhouse, and Holloway prison, the site of suffragette imprisonment.<br>
<br>Theodora Bonwick was a committed schoolteacher who brought her feminist and progressive beliefs to bear upon her work with children in the classroom. Her support for equal rights for women was articulated in her trade union, suffrage, and professional activities.<br>
