</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cameron, Sir  Donald Charles</span>  (1872&#150;1948), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was born in British Guiana on 3 June 1872, the second son of Donald Charles Cameron, a sugar planter of Plantation Blankenberg and later of Georgetown, Demerara, and his wife, Mary Emily, daughter of Richard Brassington of Dublin. His mother died when he was a boy, and his father marrying again, Cameron was sent to England and later attended Rathmines School in Dublin, where he remained until he was eighteen. Unusually for one who rose so high in the ranks of the colonial service, he had no university or college education, and his sometime colleague Sir Philip Mitchell used to say he was largely self-educated.<br>
<br>Cameron returned to British Guiana and began his career modestly enough in 1890 as a clerk in the inland revenue department. His ability soon earned him promotion to private secretary to the governor, then in 1900 to secretary and clerk to both the executive and legislative councils. In the following year he became principal clerk to the secretariat, under the acting governor, Sir Cavendish Boyle. Cameron's marriage to Gertrude, daughter of Duncan Gittens, a sugar planter of Barbados, took place in 1903. They had a son. When Boyle was appointed governor of Mauritius in 1904, Cameron followed him there in the same year as assistant colonial secretary. Boyle clearly thought well of him and he was acting colonial secretary on various occasions. His outspokenness caused him to run into some trouble with local opinion: in a council of government meeting he made some critical remarks about a section of the Mauritian public service. A protest motion in the council caused a public demonstration, and the elected members of the council requested the secretary of state to remove him. The governor agreed to Cameron's offer to go on leave so as not to embarrass the administration. Thus he left rather under a cloud, the only negative episode in an otherwise brilliant career.<br>
<br>Cameron's next appointment, as assistant colonial secretary of the protectorate of Southern Nigeria in 1908, was something of a demotion. His ability soon showed through, however, and he acted as provincial commissioner on various occasions, and in 1912 twice acted as colonial secretary of Southern Nigeria. This was the time when Sir Frederick Lugard was bringing about the very important step of amalgamating the divisions of north and south administrations, as governor-general of Nigeria. He was a strong advocate of the practice of indirect rule, whereby the traditional rulers and native authorities were left with a considerable degree of autonomy in the day-to-day administration of their people, while colonial officers were intended to be advisers for the most part. Cameron became an ardent disciple of Lugard in this respect, and enthusiastically developed this policy in both Nigeria and Tanganyika. However, he was disappointed to be only made central secretary, a post which he thought gave him insufficient status, given his abilities and strong ambition. He became critical of Lugard's <i>ad hoc</i> methods and unwillingness to deputize. The situation changed for the better in 1919 when Sir Hugh Clifford became governor and Cameron enjoyed a period of close collaboration with him. They reorganized the central administrative system including its functions, staffing, and salaries, and Cameron's work was recognized when he was appointed chief secretary to the government and knighted in 1923. On the three occasions when Clifford was away, Cameron acted as governor.<br>
<br>The good record Cameron had built up was rewarded in 1924 when he was appointed governor and commander-in-chief of Tanganyika, arriving there in 1925. The former territory of German East Africa had been awarded to Britain by the League of Nations under mandate in 1922, but little development had taken place before Cameron took over. In developing indirect rule further, he gave the chiefs wide powers of administration, jurisdiction, and control of their own budgets, but at the same time he believed in firm central control of the main policy decision making process. Aware that indirect rule through chiefs might produce a static society, he also respected the terms of the mandate which stressed the need for social progress, education, and training for eventual self-determination. Thus he encouraged rapid growth in the education system through government schools and state-aided mission schools, and he supported the founding of Tabora School for the sons of chiefs, which became the leading secondary school, at which many future African leaders of Tanganyika received their education.<br>
<br>Cameron created a new post of secretary for native affairs, which he filled successively with two very able men&#151;Charles Dundas and later Philip Mitchell. They were to travel round the country and Cameron himself believed in travel as a way not only to gain knowledge of the people but also to &#145;show&#146; himself as governor (in full dress uniform) and talk to them&#151;a habit which gained him great popularity and respect. He established a legislative council in 1926 with twenty-three members, either officials or nominated members. British settlers and Indians were in it, though no Africans as yet, because Cameron considered their English insufficient. He believed in gradually building up a sense of responsibility in the native authorities, but distrusted ideas for more advanced ideas of democracy and &#145;exotic&#146; devices such as the ballot box. Instead he wanted the growing African educated &eacute;lite to gain experience first in the advisory councils of the chiefs&#151;a policy which critics might say ignored the possibility that the &eacute;lite might become impatient with the methods of traditional rule. His creation of an African civil service, however, provided at least one outlet for them.<br>
<br>Cameron successfully built up the economy of the country, improving harbour facilities, and extending the main railway from Tabora to Mwanza on the shore of Lake Victoria, to benefit the central and north-west districts. He established a labour department, abolished forced labour and manual porterage, and refused to give priority to European settlement, insisting that the mandate stressed the paramountcy of African interests. New crops were encouraged, and Cameron resisted pressure from settlers to ban Africans from growing coffee. However, he warned against too much dependence on cash crops and took care not to press Africans to grow more than they wished. When he left in 1931 revenues had been increased by 83 per cent, recurrent expenditure by 53 per cent, and there was a healthy government surplus. In addition, Tanganyika had purchased five aeroplanes in 1930 for survey work&#151;the first colonial or mandated territory to do so.<br>
<br>Cameron was less happy in his relationship with Kenya colony, the Uganda protectorate, and indeed with the Colonial Office. During his governorship he had to defend Tanganyika from the mounting pressure for &#145;closer union&#146; of these territories of British East Africa, and also possibly including central Africa. Cameron always maintained that Tanganyika, as a mandated territory, differed from Kenya or Uganda. This angered Sir Edward Grigg, governor of Kenya, and also the Colonial Office, which tended to treat Cameron as a colonial governor like any other. But Grigg, along with Lord Delamere, the influential Kenya settler, and the colonial secretary Leopold Amery envisaged a settler-dominated group of territories on the Kenya model. Cameron argued that this was entirely against African interests in Tanganyika as laid down in the mandate, and if it came to that he would resign on this issue.<br>
<br>When the first conference of governors was held in Nairobi, Cameron attended very reluctantly and left early, holding that its decisions would not be binding on Tanganyika. Later he was particularly annoyed at Kenyan opposition to his proposal to extend the railway to Mwanza, as it was argued that this would detract from the profits of the Kenya&#150;Uganda railway. It was partly a clash of personalities between Grigg and Cameron. When Amery called another governors' conference in London to press for closer union, Cameron again stood against it, and Amery sent out the Hilton Young commission in 1927 to inquire further into it. In the following year Cameron was again called to London to discuss their report, and he refused to support the type of union proposed. He utilized the support he had long enjoyed from the Labour Party, and they, and indeed some Conservatives and Liberals, joined him in opposing it. When the Labour government took power, another inquiry was sent to sound out opinions, but this time, apparently at Cameron's suggestion, it was a joint committee of both houses of parliament. This meant of course that it included some strong supporters for his view, and their recommendation was that there was no general agreement on closer union. Thus, for the time being at least, the matter was dropped.<br>
<br>In 1931 Cameron was appointed governor and commander-in-chief of Nigeria. At that time Nigeria faced many difficulties. Taxation and other grievances had caused riots, especially the women's riots of 1929 in the east, causing many deaths. In the west Yoruba chiefs had been given new and greater powers than they had traditionally wielded, while in Lagos the growing educated &eacute;lite&#151;many of them university trained&#151;were becoming increasingly impatient with the frustrations of indirect rule through traditional rulers. In the legislative council Herbert Macauley's National Democratic Party held all the elected seats and could be a political force. Cameron still favoured indirect rule but perceived that in the north the ruling emirs were almost heads of states within a state, and they were supported in this demeanour by the British officers there who tended to resent Cameron's efforts to exert some overall control from Lagos. Above all, the world depression was having serious effects, forcing Cameron to make severe cuts in staffing and budgets.<br>
<br>In his short governorship of four years, however, Cameron achieved much. By 1934 the prices of groundnuts and palm oil, the major exports, had starting rising again and he managed to balance the budget. Because of his ruthless economies in managing the revenues he could claim that, by 1935, 30 per cent of the revenue was spent on education and social services&#151;goals dear to his heart. By introducing new native authority and native courts ordinances he reformed and refined the indirect rule system, to be more flexible and adaptable to modern Western methods and the advances of technology. In the north, Cameron may have been biased against the rulers and their officers, and according to some, relations were not good, but he tried to introduce measured reforms. He tried to curb their separatist tendencies, and in particular, to free non-Muslims and followers of traditional African religions, of whom there were many in the north, from Muslim domination. He encouraged new developments in this region by increasing the power of technical departments in Lagos. In 1933 he appointed his ally in these policies, G. S. Browne, to be the new chief commissioner&#151;not lieutenant-governor, as he abolished this grander title. Further, he sought to reduce the entrenched position of the northern officers by ruling that no officer could serve more than three consecutive tours in one province. However, Cameron did not have time to grapple with the problems of Northern Nigeria, which remained troublesome for many years to come.<br>
<br>In 1935 his wife's illness forced Cameron to retire to England. Although he still took much interest in colonial affairs, for a former governor with such a reputation for administrative ability he was not used very much by the Colonial Office: he served as a member of the Colonial Office education advisory committee, and was vice-chairman of the governing body of the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture. In 1939 he published his autobiography under the curious title <span class="italic">My Tanganyika Service and some Nigeria</span>, suggesting that his real pride lay in his work in Tanganyika, where he indeed achieved much. The dominant theme of the book was his concern for African interests, and his total conviction that indirect rule through native authorities was the key to peaceful and purposeful colonial rule. Though he referred to the possible conflicts of interest between traditional chiefs and younger generations of educated Africans, he did not think this issue really serious. However, as governor he was popular with the masses and his departure from Tanganyika was regretted; scores of chiefs came all the way to Dar es Salaam to say goodbye. Julius Nyerere was an admirer, and said in a speech to the United Nations that all the British governors except Cameron had administered the country as if it were a colony and exploited the fear instilled into people by the Germans.<br>
<br>In appearance Cameron was tall and upstanding, with dark hair, and he had a magisterial and commanding presence. He was an indefatigable worker and expected the same level of commitment from his subordinates. A brilliant administrator, he could at the same time be aloof, brusque, abrasive, with a caustic wit that earned him some enemies. Above all, however, there was universal recognition that he had at heart the best interests of the peoples he governed. His only child, Geoffrey Valentine Cameron, who became legal secretary to the government of Malta, perished in an aircraft which disappeared at sea in May 1941. Towards the end of his life Cameron suffered from increasing blindness. He was appointed CMG in 1918, KBE in 1923, KCMG in 1926, and GCMG in 1932, and received the honorary degree of LLD from Cambridge University in 1937. He died at his home, 21 Grosvenor Court, Sloane Street, London, on 8 January 1948.<br>
