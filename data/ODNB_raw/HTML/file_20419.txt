<span class="headword">Nyndge,  Alexander</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1574), <span class="occ">demoniac</span>, was the son of William Nyndge, a gentleman of Herringswell, Suffolk. William was the wealthiest inhabitant of Herringswell, according to the subsidy assessment of 1568. What fame Alexander Nyndge has he owes to his brother, Edward, who not only directed the exorcism of Alexander but published an account of it. Edward, who was about thirty years old at the time of his brother's possession, had graduated MA from Christ's College, Cambridge, and was subsequently a fellow of Gonville and Caius College.<br>
<br>His education probably explains Edward's commanding role in his brother's exorcism, despite the presence of his parents and the town curate. On 20 January 1574, about 7 p.m., Alexander had a seizure. Edward was immediately convinced that this seizure was the work of an evil spirit. Edward addressed the spirit, telling him that he was a master of arts of Cambridge and ordering him by the death and passion of Christ to state why he was troubling Alexander. Getting no response, Edward had neighbours brought in and led them in prayer. Edward once again commanded the spirit, in the name of Jesus, to speak. A voice, deeper than Alexander's usual voice, issued from Edward's brother and said that he came for Alexander's soul. The people present began to pray to God and the Virgin Mary, whereupon Edward sharply rebuked them, declaring that such prayers &#145;offend God&#146;. In obedience to Edward's instructions pieces of paper with biblical verses written on them were laid on Alexander's body and the windows were left open. Alexander's convulsions ceased about 11 p.m., and Edward declared that the demon was cast out of his brother. But in the next nine hours, Alexander had two fits. Finally, Edward instructed the town curate to read from the <span class="roman">Bible</span> while the bystanders prayed. This time the exorcism was successful, though in a second edition of his account of his brother's possession, published in 1615, Edward stated that Alexander was tormented by demons for a further six months, until 23 July. Nothing further is known of either Alexander or Edward Nyndge.<br>
<br>The exorcism of Alexander Nyndge contained a mixture of folkloric elements (the placing of biblical verses on Alexander's body) and the characteristics of later puritan exorcisms (the reliance on group prayer to expel the demon). And Edward Nyndge, with his instant diagnosis of possession, his control of his brother's exorcism, and his concern to see that it did not involve practices which would &#145;offend God&#146;, was a precursor of such later puritan exorcists as John Foxe and John Darrell.<br>
