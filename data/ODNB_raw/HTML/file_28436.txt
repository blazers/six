<span class="headword">Waldegrave,  James</span>, first Earl Waldegrave  (1684&#150;1741), <span class="occ">diplomatist and politician</span>, was the eldest son of Lady Henrietta Fitzjames (1666/7&#150;1730), the eldest illegitimate daughter of James, duke of York (later <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14593/', "King James II")</script>), and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5394/', "Arabella Churchill")</script>, the sister of John Churchill, later first duke of Marlborough. His father was <a name="cosubject_28436"></a><span class="headword">Henry Waldegrave</span>, first Baron Waldegrave  (1661&#150;1690), <span class="occ">a court official</span>, the son of Sir Charles Waldegrave, third baronet (<i>d</i>. 1684), and Helen Englefield. Henry and Henrietta married on 29 November 1683, and in January 1686 Henry was created Baron Waldegrave of Chewton by his father-in-law, James II. A year later he was made comptroller of the royal household. From a staunchly Roman Catholic family, Henry was a zealous supporter of the king. In November 1688 he went as his envoy to France and remained there in exile, still as comptroller, until his death at Ch&acirc;teauvieux, St Germain-en-Laye, aged only twenty-eight, on 24 January 1690. He was survived by his wife, Henrietta, who later married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4200/', "Pierce Butler, third Viscount Galmoye and Jacobite earl of Newcastle")</script>. The validity of this marriage was contested by the Waldegrave family. She died, aged sixty-three, at the Waldegrave estate of Navestock, Essex, on 3 April 1730.<br>
<br>James, named after his royal grandfather, inherited the barony as a child, and was groomed to follow his father's path. He received a Catholic education in France, in the household of his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9610/', "James Fitzjames, duke of Berwick")</script>, and at the Jesuit college of La Fl&egrave;che in Anjou. His education was finished by a residence in Florence, at the court of Grand Duke Cosimo III, between 1704 and 1706. In May 1714 James married Mary Webb (1695/6&#150;1719), the second daughter of the nonjuring Jacobite Sir John Webb, bt, of Hatherop in Gloucestershire. In March the following year they had a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28438/', "James Waldegrave, later second Earl Waldegrave")</script>, who was followed by a daughter, Henrietta (1717&#150;1753), who married the actor and singer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1816/', "John Beard (1716/17&#150;1791)")</script>, and two brothers, both born in Ghent and both named John, as the first died within a day of his birth. They seemed set to perpetuate a recusant dynasty.<h2>
<a name="Conversionandearlypoliticalcareer"></a>Conversion and early political career</h2>Waldegrave, however, broke sharply with this tradition after his young wife died on the night on 21/2 January 1719, a few days after she suffered a miscarriage. He was prominent among the Catholic peers and gentry who negotiated to create for patriotic Catholics a <i>modus vivendi</i> with the Hanoverian regime. These talks had failed by December 1719, and Waldegrave now chose Hanover and a public career over Catholicism. On 12 February 1722 he declared himself a protestant, swore the oaths of allegiance to the crown, and took his seat in the House of Lords. His abjuration, which scandalized his family and connections, brought him the reward of a bedchamber post in George I's household in June 1723. Lord Townshend, along with Horace and Robert Walpole, seem to have seen Waldegrave as a promising colleague. Genteel, worldly, and pleasure-loving, he also had a great capacity for the intensive bursts of work and correspondence that punctuated a diplomat's life. His French education and intimate Jacobite connections were also potential assets. He remained on intimate terms with his uncle Berwick, a significant figure at the court of Louis XV, for whom even the elder Horace Walpole while at the Paris embassy acquired a &#145;particular attachment &amp; freindship&#146;  (Walpole to Waldegrave, 13 June 1734, <span class="smallcap">OS</span>, Waldegrave MSS). Late in August 1725 he was given credentials for a mission of compliment to Louis XV on his marriage. He arrived in Paris in mid-September and left once more a month later, having had, as Horace Walpole briskly said, &#145;no preparation to make besides a Suit of Cloaths&#146;  (Walpole to Newcastle, 4 Sept 1725 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>, Waldegrave MSS). He was assured by Townshend that this employment would be &#145;an Earnest of further favours to you from his Maty. which I shall be always desirous to promote&#146;  (25 Aug 1725, BL, Add. MS 46856, fol. 160<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>A full diplomatic appointment did not follow until May 1727, when Waldegrave was appointed ambassador-extraordinary and plenipotentiary to the emperor, to sign the preliminaries of peace. He was obliged to seize the opportunity and hurry away, leaving his &#145;private affairs in the greatest confusion&#146;, and relying heavily on the help of Townshend  (Waldegrave to Townshend, 5 July 1727 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>, Waldegrave MSS). Waldegrave reached Paris on 14 June 1727 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>, with instructions to go no further than Strasbourg until he was assured of a welcome in Vienna. These orders were overtaken by the death of George I on 11 June, when all appointments were plunged into uncertainty. Not only his ministerial friends but also his mother lobbied energetically on Waldegrave's behalf &#145;at a time when all the world was pushing for themselves or for those they had the most concern for&#146;  (Waldegrave to Townshend, 19 Nov 1727 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>, Waldegrave MSS). In the event, although he lost his bedchamber post, in exchange for which he received only a promise of a future governorship of Barbados, Waldegrave was repeatedly assured by Horace Walpole that the new king and queen spoke highly of him. He was directed to remain for the time being at Paris, and began his diplomatic career by acting together with Walpole in the embassy there. He at once began cultivating informants in a way that was to characterize his later tenure of the Paris embassy. It was here that he met Montesquieu, a friend of Berwick and soon a friend and dining companion of his own. In this city of diversion and intrigue, he also earned the dubious tribute of being known as a man of pleasure. In December 1727 he had already taken a formal leave of the French king, but when Walpole was needed in parliament he had Waldegrave placed in charge of affairs in Paris, from 22 January to 17 March 1728. Waldegrave was trusted and valued, and his conduct of the embassy was approved at home, but he was not yet truly established in his diplomatic career. Indeed, his position was highly tentative, George II having agreed to send him to Vienna only if the emperor nominated a minister of equal rank to come to Britain. On Cardinal Fleury's pressing to have Waldegrave sent to Vienna to exchange the ratifications, George II ordered him to go, &#145;out of regard to the Cardinal, and to facilitate the Conclusion of this Affair&#146;. However, he was to present his full credentials only if an imperial ambassador was named, &#145;that it may appear you were sent to Vienna for that purpose only, and that His Maty. had not made too great an Advance towards the Emperor&#146;  (Newcastle to Waldegrave, 15 Feb 1728, BL, Add. MS 32754, fols. 303&#150;4).<br>
<br>Waldegrave travelled in company with Montesquieu, arriving on 25 April in Vienna, where he was in fact able to present his credentials in form as ambassador. Waldegrave's assurances of the British ministry's support and goodwill for the empire secured the ratification of the preliminary articles of peace with Britain and France, and laid the ground of the better relations secured during the mission of his successor, Thomas Robinson. As throughout his service, Waldegrave's &#145;prudent and judicious Conduct&#146; was praised by the king, along with his &#145;Attention &amp; Diligence to give exact Accounts of what passes&#146;  (Townshend to Waldegrave, 23 Aug, 18 Oct 1728, Waldegrave MSS). Eager to keep himself in his royal master's eye, he obtained permission to attend the king in Hanover in summer 1729. His success in a strained and distrustful situation was rewarded on 13 September 1729, when he was created Viscount Chewton of Chewton and first Earl Waldegrave. In April 1730, when Townshend resigned from the ministry, Waldegrave was given the prestigious Paris embassy, although the appointment was at first kept secret. Horace Walpole suggested the appointment, acting on a recommendation from Berwick, though Newcastle was not slow to claim a share of the credit. Soon afterwards Waldegrave was given leave to return to England to attend to his family concerns, and Robinson was moved from Paris to take charge of affairs in Vienna. Waldegrave's personal business at home arose from the fact that his mother, Lady Henrietta, died intestate on 3 April 1730 and his grandmother Arabella a few days later. In effect, and despite the fact that he did not actually go back to England after all, this compassionate leave was the end of Waldegrave's Vienna mission, and he went to Paris, arriving on 21 June 1730 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>. Townshend had ordered Waldegrave not to take a formal leave at Vienna, and, in order not to arouse suspicion that he did not intend to return, he had to shoulder the expense of keeping a full &#145;family&#146; there for some months, even when he had actually taken up his duties at Paris.<h2>
<a name="AmbassadortoParis"></a>Ambassador to Paris</h2>In his new post Waldegrave met at first with suspicion and hostility from Cardinal Fleury and, especially, from the <i>garde des sceaux</i>, Germain Louis de Chauvelin. His task was to secure a general peace despite bitter European divisions and, if possible, to negotiate a new &#145;treaty of equilibre&#146; while preventing France from using it to dominate affairs and redistribute territories. Waldegrave's standing with George II was so high at this time that his bedchamber post was restored by the king in October 1730, unsolicited by and even unknown to the Walpoles. Paris was a crucial diplomatic centre for the exiled Stuart court, and from the outset Waldegrave closely followed Jacobite affairs, assiduously cultivating spies and diplomatic analysts such as the &#145;Sicilian abb&eacute;s&#146;, Caracciolo and Platania. In February 1731 he had the tricky diplomatic task of informing Fleury that Britain had conducted peace negotiations with the emperor without concerting plans with the French. He pleased George II by skilfully mollifying the French cardinal, and by promptly sending his servant to Madrid to contradict false reports, spread by the Spanish minister in Paris, about the British negotiation.<br>
<br>Working urbanely but persistently to build a personal relationship with Fleury and to persuade him of British goodwill, Waldegrave at the same time was forthright in countering the blustering antagonism of Chauvelin. He won the approval of the king for showing &#145;a Spirit becoming an English Ambassador&#146;  (Newcastle to Waldegrave, 9 Dec 1731, BL, Add. MS 32775, fol. 277<i>r</i>). Horace Walpole, however, frequently urged Waldegrave to give a sharper edge to his &#145;complaisance &amp; good nature&#146;. He deplored &#145;that <i>supplesse</i> wch is so natural to you, and makes you all things to all men, wch is always agreable to those you talk to, but is not always profitable or usefull on all occasions for ye publick interest&#146;  (28 March 1734, Waldegrave MSS). The ambassador's suavity and address, though, enabled him to take into his pay the needy and extravagant Fran&ccedil;ois Bussy, who had known Waldegrave in Vienna, and who now transcribed Chauvelin's letters. In October 1734 the king authorized Waldegrave to attempt this &#145;Affair of the greatest Consequence&#146;  (Newcastle to Waldegrave, 24 Oct 1734, BL, Add. MS 32786, fol. 59), which could have been seriously embarrassing if Bussy had refused, and divulged the approach. By the following summer, Bussy (codenamed 101) was in Waldegrave's pay, and he continued to supply the British ministry with information and diplomatic evaluations until the outbreak of war between the two countries ten years later.<br>
<br>Sir Robert Walpole's refusal to enter the War of the Polish Succession made it hard for any British diplomatist to influence Fleury's successful treaty making and reshaping of power relationships at the end of the conflict, and it was probably only Horace Walpole's customary impatience that led him to blame the French advantage on Waldegrave's &#145;supple &amp; mild temper&#146;  (Walpole to Lord Harrington, 2 Oct 1735 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>, Weston MSS, vol. 2). In October 1736 a great stroke of luck gave Waldegrave direct proof of Chauvelin's Jacobite dealings, when the French minister in error handed him a letter from James Edward Stuart, the Pretender, urging France to take the lead in a pro-Stuart alliance with the emperor. It gave him a lever to use against Chauvelin himself, but also allowed him, without betraying Chauvelin, to confront Fleury about France's encouragement of the Pretender. Queen Caroline praised Waldegrave's &#145;great Prudence and Discretion&#146; in making the most effective use of this diplomatic windfall  (Newcastle to Waldegrave, 8 Oct 1736, BL, Add. MS 32793, fol. 26). The incident stirred the regency council at home, and Walpole urged that only Britain's inclusion in a general renewal of treaties could scotch Jacobite intrigues overseas and popular disorders at home.<br>
<br>Notwithstanding his success in Paris, Waldegrave complained of the usual tendency of ministers to forget their absent friends. A preferment promised in 1731 for his chaplain and secretary Anthony Thompson had still not materialized six years later, and Waldegrave declared that to neglect Thompson, who had been with him since 1722, looked like a reproach to himself. His discontent was soon soothed with the promise of a Garter. At the French court, his favoured standing was shown when Louis XV invited Waldegrave to a day's hunting and made him a generous present of game, the first instance of such complaisance to a foreign ambassador, and much talked of at court. From February to late April 1738 he was on leave in England, and witnessed the popular agitation over Spanish depredations. While there, in February, he received the blue ribbon of a knight of the Garter.<br>
<br>Waldegrave's well-placed informants continued to bring diplomatic benefits, as when he secured early notice of an intended double marriage alliance between France and Spain, and later detected a new French agent, Silhouette, opening a ciphered correspondence with the British opposition. Waldegrave drew on Walpole directly for the funds that kept open these valuable channels. Bussy, however, became ever greedier, while the quality of his intelligence varied greatly. As the prospect approached of a war with Spain, and perhaps France also, Waldegrave dared not dispense with 101's information, but he registered increasing exasperation with his demands: &#145;surely&#146; as he put it to the duke of Newcastle on 29 January 1739 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>, &#145;there is not a more brazen-faced wretch&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 32800, fol. 54). He had to place a further spy, Guyot, to check on Bussy's reports. The Franco-Spanish rapprochement and prospect of war strengthened doubts at home about the value of such a very amiable and obliging ambassador at the French court. Horace Walpole senior once again murmured, in a letter to Robert Trevor, that &#145;his Lordship's credit has, I'm afraid, arisen from nothing else but because his Eminence [Fleury] found him too easy, and tractable&#146;  (28 April 1739 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>, <span class="italic">Buckinghamshire MSS</span>, 28).<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>Increasingly troubled with asthmatic symptoms, Waldegrave was in any case less able to perform his functions. In the dangerous state of European affairs, Newcastle feared that Waldegrave's disorder was obstructing business more than the ambassador himself realized, and he secretly approached Anthony Thompson to supplement the official dispatches. Thompson confirmed that his superior was indeed very ill, the physicians divided over both causes and cure. In early October 1740 Waldegrave begged leave to return to breathe his native air, and to consult physicians whom he could trust. He complained of experiencing asthma and convulsions on any exertion. He returned to London, leaving Thompson in charge of affairs in Paris, a post which he retained until his recall in 1744 on the eve of war with France. Waldegrave's own diplomatic career was over, and the air of England did not in the event restore his health. In November Waldegrave was in London, gravely ill and dropsical. He took himself to the house he had built in the 1720s at Navestock, Essex, where he died on 11 April 1741 and was buried seven days later.<br>
<br>Waldegrave, with his Catholic, Jacobite, and freemasonry connections, was a risky choice of ambassador to the court of France, and in 1742 one of the articles of Walpole's attempted impeachment charged him with placing a nephew of the Pretender in that post. English suspicions were always likely to revive when events drew attention to his Catholic background, as friends in the ministry reminded him. He found the truth of this in 1732, when he brought his sons over to have them under his eye and complete their education in Paris. He was obliged vigorously to counter rumours, fostered not least by his ambitious secretary of embassy Thomas Pelham, that he intended to bring them up in his old faith. On balance, however, the Hanoverian regime benefited from his relationships in Jacobite circles, and his intimate knowledge of their outlook and beliefs. His courtesy and noble demeanour secured acceptance in the &eacute;lite world of the French court, and his shrewd judgement and diplomatic skills may be seen in the quality of his ambassadorial letters. Thompson, succeeding him as charg&eacute;, had neither the flair of his master nor even the same caution in dealing with the Jacobites. Very soon after Waldegrave left, Thompson conversed freely with one of the Pretender's leading correspondents, giving him a detailed breakdown of the diplomatic analyses of &#145;those Lord Waldegrave most depended upon&#146;  (George Robinson to James Edward Stuart, 14 Nov 1740 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>, Royal Archives, Windsor Castle, Stuart MS 228, 129). By contrast, Waldegrave's own discretion and his judicious and sceptical evaluations of French intentions and the characters of the ministers and diplomats in Paris were of great value to his country, and his correspondence was both thoughtful and professional. He seems never to have wavered in his allegiance to the house of Hanover or in the protestant religious principles that he adopted. No surviving evidence supports the pious Catholic story, preserved at third hand into the following century, that on his deathbed Waldegrave put his hand on the tongue that had abjured his religion and cried: &#145;This bit of red rag has been my damnation&#146;  (G. Oliver, <span class="italic">Collections illustrating the history of the Catholic religion in the counties of Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Somerset, Wilts, and Gloucester</span>, 1857, 69&#150;70).<br>
