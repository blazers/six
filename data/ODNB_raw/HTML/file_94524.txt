<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cohen, Sir  (Benn) Jack Brunel</span>  (1886&#150;1965), <span class="occ">campaigner for former servicemen</span>, was born at Ethelstone, Alexandra Drive, Toxteth Park, Liverpool, on 5 October 1886, the sixth son of nine children (one of whom did not survive infancy) of Louis Samuel Cohen (1844/5&#150;1922) and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Levy (<i>d</i>. 1914). His maternal grandfather, Lewis Wolfe Levy (1815&#150;1885), was a businessman and politician in New South Wales, where his paternal grandfather, Samuel Cohen, was also an MP. His father was a prominent member of the Jewish community in Liverpool, where he was a Conservative councillor and in 1899&#150;1900 served as mayor. The family owned the Liverpool-based firm of Lewis's department stores, of which Cohen's father became head after the death of the founder, David Lewis (1823&#150;1885).<br>
<br>Cohen was educated at Cheltenham College (1899&#150;1903), where he boarded in the house for Jewish boys run by the Russian master Ivan Nestor-Schnurmann. He then joined the family retail business in Liverpool. On 22 April 1914, at the New West End Synagogue, London, he married Vera Evelyn (1894&#150;1994), daughter of Sir Stuart Montagu Samuel, first baronet, banker, and radical MP for Whitechapel; the Liberal politician Herbert Samuel was her uncle. They had two sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Cohen joined the 1st volunteer battalion of the King's Liverpool regiment in 1906, and remained in the territorials until the outbreak of war. Two of his elder brothers served in the regiment: George Hubert Cohen (1878&#150;1915) was killed in action, and Stanley Samuel Gilbert Cohen (1880&#150;1944) was wounded and later invalided out after being gassed. Cohen was disappointed by his sheltered posting to the depot battalion and, early in 1917, got himself sent to the western front. In June he was promoted to the rank of major. On 31 July 1917, during the third battle of Ypres, he was severely wounded by machine-gun fire and both his legs had to be amputated above the knee. Although he was able to walk short distances and drove a car, he spent most of his adult life in an electric wheelchair. He coped well with his disability and he became a champion and advocate for all disabled former servicemen, and indeed for all people with disabilities.<br>
<br>After a short stint in banking, and encouraged by his father and the Liverpool Conservative organizer Archibald Salvidge, Cohen stood for parliament at the general election of December 1918. He won the Liverpool (Fairfield) constituency as a Conservative, and held it against Labour opponents until 1931, when he decided not to contest the seat again. In his maiden speech, on 14 February 1919, he spoke on the need not only to teach disabled former servicemen a trade, but also to find them jobs. In July 1919 he raised a parliamentary question about the exclusion of wounded former servicemen from the peace procession held in that month; they were left to view the parade from the sidelines. He served on more than thirty government committees and voluntary bodies concerning the welfare of former servicemen and servicewomen and the disabled, including one concerning the design of artificial limbs.<br>
<br>As a representative of the Officers' Association Cohen attended the Unity Conferences held between the rival former service organizations in 1920&#150;21. In this capacity he helped to shape the constitution of the new, unified, body, the British Legion, which was agreed at a delegate conference on 15 May 1921, and which came into existence on 1 July 1921. Cohen became the first honorary treasurer of the British Legion, a post he held for twenty-five years until 1946 with only a two-year break in 1930&#150;32, when he served as vice-chairman.<br>
<br>Cohen became known as the British Legion's representative in the House of Commons. He served on the select committee of 1922, chaired by John Davidson, on the training and employment of disabled former servicemen, which recommended that if conditions did not improve, firms should be required to take a proportion of disabled former servicemen on their payrolls. He took up war-pension issues and in June 1923 threatened to vote against the Conservative government, and did so in May 1925. One of his most famous interventions concerned the legion's national public petition of 1925. This was an attempt by the legion to raise public awareness of the inequities contained in the 1919 war pensions warrant. The legion hoped that, after the delivery of 824,105 signatures in the largest petition since the Chartist petition of 1848, parliament might be persuaded to amend the pensions warrant. On 30 July 1925 Cohen presented the first page of the petition to the speaker of the House of Commons, followed by many large bundles of signatures, which were dumped on the floor of the house. The legion's campaign raised public awareness of the meagre provision and unfair regulations surrounding war pensions, but it had little direct effect on government policy.<br>
<br>After the end of his parliamentary career Cohen continued his work for the British Legion, war veterans, and the disabled. He served on numerous committees of the legion and was involved in a wide range of its activities for many years. He was a member of the board of the Poppy Factory, which employed disabled former servicemen at Richmond, Surrey, and served as chairman of the legion school that trained former servicemen to be taxi drivers. He was president of the Legion Village, Preston Hall, near Maidstone, Kent.<br>
<br>Cohen was also involved in the British Legion's attempts to bring peace and understanding through international meetings of former servicemen. At the first International Conference of the F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Interalli&eacute;e des Anciens Combattants in New Orleans in 1922 he suggested that the former servicemen of the allied nations needed to extend the hand of friendship to their former enemies in the cause of peace. Controversy arose when the legion renewed these attempts in 1935 with the new Nazi regime of Germany. While avoiding the league delegation's visit to Germany (he instead visited Austria, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia), he was criticized by the Jewish community for his endorsement of the legion's &#145;foreign policy&#146;, and in particular for receiving the reciprocal German delegation to Britain early in 1936 in his official capacity as the British Legion treasurer. He made a statement acknowledging the German government's mistreatment of Jews and other minorities, but insisted that exchange visits between former servicemen should be pursued as a means of preventing a future war  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 17 Feb 1936). He helped many German Jewish refugees who had managed to escape on their arrival in England.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Cohen served as an army welfare officer for the Auxiliary Territorial Service and was chairman of the national advisory council (Ministry of Labour) on employment for the disabled, which gave rise to the <span class="roman">Disabled Persons (Employment) Act</span> of 1944 and thus achieved his longstanding aim of requiring employers to have a quota of disabled people among their workforces. He became the chairman of the Ministry of Labour's national advisory council to oversee the working of the legislation. Cohen stood down as the British Legion's treasurer in 1946, but in that year became vice-chairman of Remploy Ltd, which grew out of the Disabled Persons Employment Corporation, founded in 1945, and was its chairman in 1955.<br>
<br>Cohen was also prominent in the politics of the Jewish community in Britain. In 1935 he had expressed his opposition to a separate organization for Jewish former servicemen. In 1944, after Zionists secured a majority on the Board of Deputies of British Jews, Cohen, along with Basil Henriques and others, established the Jewish Fellowship to promote their view that Jewish people constituted a religious rather than a political or national entity. He was founding president of the fellowship, which was dissolved in 1948 following the creation of the Jewish state. Cohen visited Israel in 1960.<br>
<br>In politics Cohen was generally known as Major Cohen, and in public life as Brunel Cohen; friends knew him as Jack, and he usually ordered his initials J. B. B. He was a member of the council for St Dunstan's for forty years and a governor of St Thomas's Hospital for thirty-three years. He was also a member of the council of Cheltenham College. His outstanding services for former servicemen and the disabled were recognized with a knighthood in 1943, and appointment as KBE in 1948. His autobiography, <span class="italic">Count Your Blessings</span>, appeared in 1956. He died at his home, 82 Portland Place, London, on 11 May 1965. A memorial service was held at the West London Synagogue.<br>
<br>In later life Cohen became a symbolic figure for the millions of people who watched the television broadcast of the British Legion marching past the Cenotaph every remembrance day. Riding alongside the leader of the parade in his electric wheelchair, Cohen was a visible reminder of the terrible cost of the conflict that had given birth to the rituals of remembrance and the British former service movement.<br>
