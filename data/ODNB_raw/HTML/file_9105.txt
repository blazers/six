<span class="headword">Falconbridge <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Horwood]</span>,  Anna Maria</span>  (<em>b. </em>1769, <em>d.</em> in or after 1802?), <span class="occ">traveller and writer</span>, was born in All Saints' Lane, Bristol, in July 1769, the daughter of Charles Horwood (<i>d</i>. 1787), a watchmaker and goldsmith, and his wife, Grace Roberts (<i>d</i>. 1774). After her parents' deaths, against her family's wishes, she married on 16 October 1788 <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9104/', "Alexander Falconbridge")</script>, formerly a surgeon employed in the slave trade, who had turned violently against it and given crucial help to Thomas Clarkson at the outset of the abolition campaign. Soon after their marriage he left his medical practice at Lodway, near Bristol, to return to the campaign as an employee of the Sierra Leone Company, a commercial company founded by Clarkson and other abolitionists to sponsor a settlement of free black people in Sierra Leone. A previous attempt, sponsored by Granville Sharp in 1787, had ended abruptly when the settlers quarrelled with a neighbouring Temne ruler, who burnt their town. Falconbridge's task was to reassemble the surviving settlers and negotiate with the Temne authorities for a new settlement.<br>
<br>Anna Maria accompanied her husband, and described her experiences in a series of lively, informative letters (witness to her good education) to a friend in Bristol, intended ultimately, she openly declared, for publication. Their port of destination was a slave-trading fort, Bance Island, in the Sierra Leone River, where they were politely received by the employees, whom she, coming from a family associated with the slave trade, found sympathetic. But Falconbridge, passionately opposed to the trade, refused to let her stay there, and forced her to live on board a tiny, filthy, single-masted boat. Protracted negotiations then began with Naimbana, styled king, though in fact regent, of the Koya Temne. Anna Maria accompanied Falconbridge on some of his visits, and recounted her experiences in her letters in a light-hearted way. Eventually it was agreed a new settlement might be founded, the former settlers were gathered, and a site was prepared. Once huts were built she moved in, making light of the difficulties, &#145;for I now find 'tis necessary to accommodate myself to whatever I meet with&#146;  (Falconbridge, 67).<br>
<br>During her stay Anna Maria observed all she could of the country and its people, their customs, religion, and economy, and wrote about what she saw with obvious enjoyment (&#145;there is such a variety here as to afford a continual zest to the sight&#146;; Falconbridge, 72) in a dispassionate, uncensorious way. As the heavy rains approached she and her husband embarked for England on the tiny boat. It took six weeks, through constant storms, to reach the Cape Verde Islands. Then, after nearly being shipwrecked, they were blown to the Azores, and finally reached Penzance in September 1791, seventy-eight days after embarking.<br>
<br>Meanwhile the directors of the Sierra Leone Company were investing heavily in the new settlement, and had sent Clarkson's naval officer brother John to Nova Scotia to recruit settlers among the self-liberated black American loyalists located there. Falconbridge was appointed commercial agent, and in December he and his wife set out again. On arrival they found confusion, with a governing council of eight, appointed by the directors, quarrelling and giving contradictory orders. Clarkson arrived soon after with more than a thousand settlers, who began laying out Freetown. But they had arrived at the start of the rainy season. Living without shelter, hundreds fell ill and died. Anna Maria, who had kept her health, wrote, &#145;It is quite customary of a morning to ask &#147;how many died last night?&#148;&#146;  (Falconbridge, 148). Then she too became ill with a violent fever but recovered. Falconbridge, who knew nothing about commerce and had taken heavily to drink, was dismissed by the directors, fell ill, and died on 19 December 1792. &#145;I will not be guilty of such meanness as to tell a falsehood on this occasion&#146;, wrote Anna Maria, &#145;by saying I regret his death, no! I really do not&#146;  (ibid., 169).<br>
<br>Within a fortnight, on 7 January 1793, Anna Maria had remarried, celebrating with a &#145;convivial gala &hellip; garnished with comfort and pleasantry&#146;  (Falconbridge, 200), with her brother-in-law Captain Morley, the captain of a passing slave ship, present. Her new husband, Isaac DuBois, was one of the company's employees, a ruined and uncompensated white American loyalist from North Carolina. Meanwhile mismanagement and acrimonious party strife, which Anna Maria reported in her letters in entertaining detail, continued. Clarkson went home on leave and was dismissed by the directors, who laid all the blame on him and the late Falconbridge. Anna Maria and DuBois then left for England, travelling via Jamaica on board Morley's slave ship. &#145;Having heard such a vast deal of the ill treatment of slaves,&#146; she wrote, &#145;I did not omit to make the nicest observations in my power, and &hellip; I had not the slightest reason to suspect any inhumanity or mal-practice was shown towards them&#146;  (ibid., 232&#150;3).<br>
<br>Having arrived in London, Anna Maria demanded from the directors money she claimed was due to Falconbridge. Her claims were summarily refused, so she published her letters denouncing the company, in particular the chairman, Henry Thornton. Three editions of her <span class="italic">Narrative of Two Voyages to the River Sierra Leone during the Years 1791&#150;1792&#150;1793</span> appeared during 1794 and 1795, but the directors remained obdurate. A further edition was issued in 1802 with a new title-page which mentioned the &#145;improbability&#146; of the total abolition of the slave trade, thus placing it firmly in the anti-abolitionist camp. All appeared under the name Falconbridge: DuBois's name appears nowhere in the book.<br>
<br>In 1807 parliament belatedly awarded DuBois some compensation for his losses as a loyalist. The subsequent careers of him and his wife have not been traced. Anna Maria's book, the first Englishwoman's narrative of a visit to Africa, remains as her memorial.<br>
