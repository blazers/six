<span class="headword">Finer,  Samuel Edward</span>  (1915&#150;1993), <span class="occ">political scientist</span>, was born at 17 Chapel Street, Clerkenwell, London, on 22 September 1915, the sixth and youngest child of Max Finer (1866/7&#150;1945) and his wife, Fanny Weiner (1872/3&#150;1945), immigrants from Romania who earned a living first as market traders and, by the time of Sammy's birth, as owners of a drapery shop. His life and career were significant in at least two ways. He was one of the many children of pre-1914 Jewish immigrants from eastern Europe who were to play such prominent roles in British economic, cultural, and political life. He became one of the pioneers of political science in Britain and, in his day, probably its internationally best-known practitioner. Through his teaching at three leading universities and his numerous books he helped to form a generation of students and academics in his chosen subject.<br>
<br>By winning scholarships to Holloway School in north London and then to Trinity College, Oxford, Finer was able to do justice to his intellectual promise and to follow the examples of his brothers, of whom the eldest, Herman, also became an eminent political scientist and the second a medical practitioner. At Oxford he took first-class honours in philosophy, politics, and economics in 1937, and in modern history in 1938. The war, in which he rose to the rank of captain in the Royal Corps of Signals, interrupted his academic career. He returned to Oxford in 1946 to resume his research, inspired by the now successful career of Herman, who had just been appointed to a professorship at Chicago, and whose <span class="italic">Theory and Practice of Modern Government</span>, first published in 1932, was a highly innovative and encyclopaedic work of comparative government. Its influence on the younger Finer's life's work and interests was manifest and openly acknowledged.<br>
<br>Having been a senior George Webb Medley scholar at Oxford from 1938 to 1940, Finer now became a lecturer at Balliol College and was elected to a junior research fellowship there in 1949. A year later he was appointed to the chair of local government and administration at the newly founded University College of North Staffordshire (later Keele University), a post that was changed shortly afterwards to the chair of political institutions. This inspired piece of patronage by A. D. Lindsay, the master of Balliol who became the University College's first principal, gave Finer the chance to transform his research into teaching. Though he was well versed in the history of political ideas and in modern social sciences other than politics, his central interest lay in the institutions of government. He wanted to know, and to explain to others, how power is exercised, by what type of person (&#145;the predominant decision-making personnel&#146;, as he later put it), through what instruments, and with what constraints. Though his writings ranged widely in both topic and geography, this single preoccupation ran like a scarlet thread through more than forty years of authorship.<br>
<br>By the time of his appointment to North Staffordshire, Finer had already published <span class="italic">A Primer of Public Administration</span> (1950) (&#145;my little primer&#146;) and was well advanced in his major project on the great Victorian local-government reformer Sir Edwin Chadwick (<span class="italic">The Life and Times of Sir Edwin Chadwick</span>, 1952). In parallel with this monograph he took the leading role in revising Sir John Maud's <span class="italic">Local Government in England and Wales</span> (2nd edn, 1953). These two books marked the end of a specialized interest in local government, though the theme he touched on&#151;the relations between central and local authorities&#151;is part of the bread-and-butter of all constitutional studies and one that he never lost sight of.<br>
<br>North Staffordshire in its early days was primarily a teaching university; its principal pedagogic innovation was the foundation year, which included a multidisciplinary course to which all departments contributed. Finer monopolized the politics slot and used his exceptional lecturing gifts to proselytize for his subject. The result was that a large number of students chose politics as an option for their honours course, which in turn enabled him to expand his department. This had effects beyond his own parish. Outside Oxford, the London School of Economics, and Manchester, political studies led a beggarly existence in the 1950s. Finer not only widened the field, but trained a new red-brick professoriate: of the six lecturers he recruited during his tenure, four went on to chairs at other British universities.<br>
<br>Finer's sixteen years at Keele also saw him embarking on topics up to then neglected in Britain. Though there was a considerable, if largely parochial, American literature on interest groups, they had in the main been despised as cuckoos in the political nest in Britain. Finer determined to show in <span class="italic">Anonymous Empire</span> (1958) that, whether good or bad, they were a feature of modern politics that had come to stay and needed to be studied. So, too, his more substantial study of the military in politics, <span class="italic">The Man on Horseback</span> (1962), broke new ground in British political studies, not least through his insistence on incorporating political structures outside the developed West into the mainstream of the discipline.<br>
<br>Finer's move to Manchester in 1966 marked a consolidation rather than a leap forward in his career. He joined a well-established department which offered less scope for top-down innovations. As at Keele, he lectured enthusiastically, especially to first-year students, and his research agenda became steadily more focused. Two visiting professorships in the United States&#151;at Cornell and Stanford&#151;gave him new perspectives and he distinguished more severely than before between the historical and comparative methods. While respectful of both, he now leaned more to the one that sought out patterns and regularities, rather than peculiarities and idiosyncrasies; at the same time he rejected the more extreme American behavioural and systems-based approaches, because they ignored the centrality of governmental institutions, and were ahistorical. This characteristic and individual approach became evident in his <span class="italic">Comparative Government</span> (1970), which quickly established itself as a standard student text, his extended introductory essay to <span class="italic">Five Constitutions</span> (1979), and in the crowning achievement of his life's work, <span class="italic">The History of Government from the Earliest Times</span>, published posthumously and discussed below.<br>
<br>In 1974, after eight years at Manchester, Finer was appointed to the Gladstone chair of government and public administration at Oxford and elected to the fellowship at All Souls College that goes with that post. Though he was gratified by this recognition, this was not academically an entirely happy period in his life. Oxford is, in Finer's taxonomy, a &#145;nobility polity&#146; in which the monarch counts for little. And though he felt that the Oxford politics sub-faculty&#151;the largest in the country and indeed in Europe&#151;was failing to make the necessary distinction between historical and social science approaches, its members had more confidence than he in the validity of their methods and their ability to renew and develop their teaching. As a result his attempts to change the philosophy, politics, and economics syllabus came to nothing. He retired in 1982 and in the same year was somewhat belatedly elected fellow of the British Academy. He was a founder member of the Political Studies Association of the United Kingdom and its chairman from 1965 to 1969, and was a vice-president of the International Political Science Association.<br>
<br>It is impossible to separate Finer the man from Finer the scholar. He was not only an academic animal, but a political one, as one who grew up in the 1930s could hardly help being. After an early brief flirtation with Marxism, he embraced the Keynesian Fabianism that was common among his generation of social scientists. This allegiance changed abruptly in the mid-1950s, for he had emotional ties beside British domestic ones. Though not a particularly pious Jew, he felt a strong ethnic pull and was a passionate supporter of Zionism and the state of Israel. He thought the Suez operation of 1956 was fully justified and never forgave the left for taking the opposite view. He helped to organize the reception of British citizens evacuated from Egypt after Suez, for which he was appointed OBE. He did not, however, become a partisan Conservative. In the 1970s he campaigned against the prevailing party system in favour of more consensual politics, editing a volume <span class="italic">Adversary Politics and Electoral Reform</span> (1975). After the 1979 election he became an admirer of Margaret Thatcher, less for the specific details of her policies than for the energy with which she pursued them.<br>
<br>Finer's missionary zeal for teaching was an expression of his exuberant personality. He was in permanent need of an audience. When that audience was voluntary, as in a lecture theatre, it appreciated the value of what he offered. When it was captive, as in a common room, reactions could be divided. His lifelong love affair with the sound of his voice, high in pitch and decibels, entertained many, but not all, of his colleagues. He was something of a peacock, who spent extravagantly on clothes and had a taste for lurid shirts and ties, though the photograph in the common room album at All Souls shows him without either of these accessories. He had a deep knowledge, reinforced with strong opinions, of a great range of culture, including opera and literature. He was a decent draughtsman and a translator of French poetry. As one of his Keele colleagues put it, &#145;more than a teacher, a scholar, an entrepreneur or a friend &hellip; Sammy was an experience&#146;  (Berrington, memorial address). His idea of hell would have been solitary confinement. Such enthusiasms brought their drawbacks. In his eagerness to paint the large picture, to reach a persuasive conclusion and to puncture the balloons of received wisdom, he sometimes neglected detail. He was not the world's most diligent verifier of references.<br>
<br>After his retirement from the Gladstone chair Finer continued to live in a modest house in Summertown, Oxford, most of which was given over to books and papers on sagging do-it-yourself shelves and&#151;a great source of pride&#151;his newly acquired computer. He now devoted his remaining eleven years to a project of staggering ambition that had been forming in his mind for some time and was the culmination of much of his earlier thinking&#151;<span class="italic">A History of Government from the Earliest Times</span>, that would be <span class="italic">Comparative Government</span> and <span class="italic">The Man on Horseback</span> writ large. It embedded three of his most important guiding principles: the use of history to lend perspective, the importance of studying non-modern and non-European political systems, and the centrality of the state as the instrument of rule. Basic to all states, he argued, were the military, a bureaucracy, and the capacity to collect taxes. Within these three components and in addition to them, wide variations were possible, but their number is limited and they can all be systematized. He remained faithful to the aim he had declared some years before as &#145;interpreting a body of knowledge &hellip; or, most simply and probably most comprehensively, making sense out of it&#146;  (S. E. Finer, &#145;Political science: an idiosyncratic retrospect of a putative discipline&#146;, <span class="italic">Government and Opposition</span>, 15, 1980, 363).<br>
<br>In the middle of this enterprise, in 1987, Finer suffered a near-fatal heart attack. This <i>memento mori</i> caused him to prepare his manuscript, and to store it on disc, in such a way that it could be completed after his death. In the event he was able to write thirty-four of the projected thirty-six chapters; the final version, edited by his widow, Catherine Jones Finer, and Professor Jack Hayward, running to 1701 pages in three volumes, appeared in 1997. &#145;It is likely to be read&#146;, one reviewer wrote, &#145;as long as Aristotle&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Economist</span>, 18 Oct 1997, 5). For the 5200 years covered by this study he constructed four main types of state, of which the commonest are the &#145;palace state&#146; (autocratic) and the &#145;forum polity&#146; (participatory), with a large number of sub-types and combinations. In common with one of his mentors, the Italian sociologist Vilfredo Pareto, he saw rulers moved by passions as well as interests; religion and ideology therefore feature as prominently as strategy and economics in his explanatory scheme. For Finer the history of government was neither one of meaningless contingency nor of predestined development. Though himself devoted to the principles of liberal democracy, he did not regard the modern constitutional nation state as necessarily the end-point of an evolution. His untimely death deprived us of his verdict on the prospects for government in the post-communist world.<br>
<br>Finer died on 9 June 1993 at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, and was buried in Wolvercote cemetery. He was twice married: on 19 July 1949 to Margaret Ann (<i>b</i>. 1925), a teacher, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31390/', "Sir Andrew McFadyean (1887&#150;1974)")</script> (the marriage was dissolved in 1975); and on 27 April 1977 to Dr Catherine Joy 
    (Kate; <i>b</i>. 1941)
  , university lecturer, daughter of Thomas Philip Jones, chemical storekeeper. There were three children of the first marriage, Jeremy (Jem), Jessica, and Josiah. Jem was a member of the Irish pop group the Pogues. At the All Souls commemoration the three children performed Jem's setting of his father's translation of Guillaume Apollinaire's <span class="italic">Sous le pont Mirabeau</span>.<br>
