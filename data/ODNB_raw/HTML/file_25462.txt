<span class="headword">Short,  Thomas Vowler</span>  (1790&#150;1872), <span class="occ">bishop of St Asaph</span>, was the eldest son of William Short (<i>d</i>. 1826), archdeacon of Cornwall, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of William Hodgkinson, headmaster of the grammar school at Exeter. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25457/', "Augustus Short")</script> was his cousin. He was born on 16 September 1790 at Vicarage House, Dawlish, Devon, where his father was curate. After spending a year at Exeter grammar school Short was sent to Westminster School in 1803, from where he passed with a studentship to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1809. He took a first class in classics and in mathematics in 1812, and in the following year was ordained deacon by the bishop of Oxford. He graduated BA in 1813, MA in 1815, BD in 1824, and DD in 1837. In 1814 Short became perpetual curate of Drayton, Oxfordshire, but he resigned this cure in 1815 in order to undertake academic offices in Christ Church. He became successively tutor and censor (1816&#150;29), librarian (1822), and catechist and Busby lecturer (1825); in 1823 he was proctor. Having served as an examiner at Oxford between 1820 and 1824 he published influential suggestions (1822) for the improvement of the examination system, but the changes he sought were not effected until 1830. He published <span class="italic">Twenty Sermons on the Fundamental Truths of Christianity</span> in 1829. Though Short left Christ Church before the Oxford Movement really began, he was well acquainted with most of its leaders. Pusey, a favourite pupil, always acknowledged his influence, and &#145;Short held a first place in his affection and respect to the last hour of his life&#146;  (Liddon, <span class="italic">Life of Pusey</span>, 1.24). Short examined Newman for his degree, and Keble he numbered among his close friends. W. E. Gladstone was one of his pupils. Short is to be distinguished from Thomas Short (1789&#150;1879), a celebrated contemporary and tutor of Trinity College.<br>
<br>Short's departure from Oxford in 1829 followed the fiasco of Sir Robert Peel's defeat in the university election, Short having been one of Peel's most energetic supporters. He had held the Christ Church living of Cowley from 1816 to 1823, when he was presented to the rectory of Stockleigh Pomeroy, Devon. In 1826 he succeeded his father to the rectory of King's Worthy, Hampshire, which was in the gift of his father's kinsman Sir Thomas Baring. He went to reside there in 1829, forming a household with his mother (the subject of his <span class="italic">Letters to an Aged Mother</span> published in 1841) and two sisters. A member of the National Society and of the Winchester Bible Society, he was a keen promoter of education, building a school in his parish in 1830. In 1832 he published a two-volume history of the Church of England to 1688, which went through several editions and was widely used by ordinands. He married on 26 February 1833 Mary, daughter of Revd Charles Davies of Pembroke College and widow of John Josias Conybeare.<br>
<br>In 1834 Short was presented by the lord chancellor, Brougham, to the rectory of St George's, Bloomsbury, where he acquired a reputation as a conscientious parish priest. He promoted benefit societies, a Sunday school, a lending library, and a visiting society, which he described in tracts published as <span class="italic">Parochialia</span> (1842) for the guidance of other clergy. Reckoned a serious-minded practical clergyman, tending to evangelicalism, though regarded by Richard Whately as being intellectually of &#145;third rate talents&#146;  (Brent, 130), he was in 1837 appointed deputy clerk to the closet to the queen. His former pupil Francis Baring advanced his claims as an earnest churchman, and Lord Melbourne appointed him bishop of Sodor and Man, where he was consecrated on 30 May 1841. His first charge (1842) lamented the widespread disaffection from the church and he set about visiting the parishes and improving the education of candidates for ordination. On 27 October 1846 he was translated, on the recommendation of Lord John Russell, to the see of St Asaph. He immediately established a diocesan board of education, building new schools, developing a reading method known as the &#145;look and say&#146; system, and providing textbooks in which lessons were printed in both English and Welsh. In a public controversy with one of his clergy Short was accused of the inability to read Welsh or conduct services in the language and of harbouring an animosity towards the Welsh people (<span class="italic">Correspondence and statement of facts, connected with the case of the Revd Richard Williams Morgan</span>, 1856). When he resigned the see on 22 February 1870 it was stated that every parish had a school and a resident incumbent, Short himself having for many years spent half of his episcopal income on diocesan purposes. Short died on 13 April 1872 at Gresford vicarage, Denbighshire, the home of his brother-in-law and former chaplain, Robert Wickham (<i>d</i>. 1880).<br>
