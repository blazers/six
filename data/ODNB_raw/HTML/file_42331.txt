<span class="headword">Barrie <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Barry]</span>,  Michael Maltman</span>  (1842&#150;1909), <span class="occ">journalist and tory-Marxist</span>, was born in Glasgow, the son of Edward Barry, a shoemaker. Little is known of his early life except that he was educated at Glasgow grammar school. In 1864 he moved to London and became a journalist on <span class="italic">The Standard</span>, a newspaper with which he was to be associated throughout his life, although he also worked for other papers. Barry reported from the parliamentary gallery and lobby as well as covering labour matters. On 19 July 1869 he married, at the Bloomsbury chapel, Julia Charlotte, daughter of Robert London, cheesemonger.<br>
<br>In the later 1860s Barry entered radical circles in London and became a friend of Karl Marx, who provided him with information for newspaper articles and who was to become his patron on the left. Barry stood out among radicals because of his hostility to the Gladstonian sympathies of most contemporary labour leaders. Barry was converted to Marx's views and on Marx's death he told Eleanor Marx that &#145;he was more than my master, he was my political maker&#146;  (C. Tsuzuki, <span class="italic">The Life of Eleanor Marx, 1855&#150;1898</span>, 1967, 71).<br>
<br>In October 1871 Barry became provisional chairman of the federal council of the International Working Men's Association (IWMA). His chairmanship was largely negative and the following year, after intriguing against other members, he was forced to leave amid accusations that he was a spy and an &#145;ultra moderate&#146;. He published (1873) a report of the IWMA's fifth annual congress, held at The Hague in September 1872. Despite his acrimonious relationship with the IWMA, Barry became a notable figure in London's radical clubs of the 1870s both as an activist and as a speaker at meetings. In 1876 he edited <span class="italic">The People's Advocate</span>, a radical paper that advocated land nationalization, republicanism, and Irish nationalism but which lasted only five issues.<br>
<br>In the later 1870s Barry apparently began his shift towards the Conservative Party without relinquishing his Marxism. This was partly because of his hostility to Liberalism, partly because of the Conservatives' record on social reform, and partly because of his support for Beaconsfield's foreign policy during the Eastern crisis of 1875&#150;8. Barry became an extreme Russophobe, and supported Turkish resistance to Russian intervention. He launched the small-scale radical anti-Russian movement that attempted to capitalize on the jingoism of these years. Barry actually claimed that Marx himself taught him to be a jingo. Barry became secretary of the National Society for the Resistance of Russian Aggression and the Protection of British Interests in the East and organized a series of meetings in 1876 and 1877, several of which ended in riot. He published <span class="italic">The Catechism of the Eastern Question</span> (1890).<br>
<br>In the early 1880s Barry became active in Conservative Party circles, and attended meetings of the National Union of Conservative Associations. At the same time he became an ally of Henry Hyde Champion in advocating the formation of an independent political party for working-class representation. The two were involved in the &#145;tory gold&#146; scandal of November 1885, in which Barry received &pound;340 from Conservative central office to fund two candidates of the Social Democratic Federation in the general election. The Conservatives hoped to split the Liberal&#150;radical vote but the candidates polled badly. The ensuing crisis harmed the reputation of the Social Democratic Federation but also reinforced Barry's reputation for untrustworthiness.<br>
<br>Barry had by this time become involved in the politics of his native Scotland and changed his name to the Scottish spelling, Barrie. In 1888 he edited <span class="italic">The Labour Elector</span> (which lasted for two years) and, with Champion, attempted to launch an anti-Liberal alliance of labour based in Aberdeen. In August 1890 he addressed the Aberdeen Trades Council, advocating an eight-hour day and a halt to alien immigration (he was an antisemite). In July 1892 he unsuccessfully contested Banffshire as a Conservative Democrat. <span class="italic">The Labour Elector</span> was revived in January 1893 with a local supplement for Aberdeen. It was as short-lived as its predecessor, and lasted only until July 1894. The paper supported the newly formed Independent Labour Party. Standing as a Conservative, Barrie contested Morpeth in 1895 and 1900, in opposition to Thomas Burt, and North Aberdeen in 1906. On each occasion he was defeated. He died of pneumonia on 5 April 1909 at his home, Roseneath, 51 Beauval Road, East Dulwich, London, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery. His wife, two sons, and two daughters survived him.<br>
<br>Barrie's tory-Marxism marks him out as an eccentric in the early labour movement, but he was not wholly unusual. Henry Hyndman among other early socialists also had strong tory leanings. Barrie is usually derided as an opportunist but his constant attachment to Marxism suggests he was more principled than his detractors allow. His main importance was as a journalist covering labour affairs and as an advocate of independent working-class representation.<br>
