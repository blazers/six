<span class="headword">Plummer,  Charles</span>  (1851&#150;1927), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born at St Leonards, Sussex, on 24 January 1851, the fifth son of the Revd Matthew Plummer (1808&#150;1898), vicar of Heworth, Durham, and his wife, Louisa, daughter of J. D. Powles. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/41036/', "Alfred Plummer (1841&#150;1926)")</script>, biblical scholar and master of University College, Durham, was his elder brother. Schooled at St Michael's College, Tenbury, and Magdalen College School, Oxford, Charles matriculated in 1869 at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he remained for fifty-eight years. He was awarded a first in classics moderations in 1871 and a first in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1873; in 1873 he graduated BA, and he took his MA in 1876.<br>
<br>Plummer was a fellow of Corpus from 1873 and college chaplain from 1875 until his death. He lectured in modern history only from 1875 to 1883 and, despite his great learning and best will, was quite ineffective (his lectures were thought not &#145;good for the Schools&#146;). Having been ordained deacon in 1875 he was never priested, &#145;from the conscientious but mistaken belief that his work in college was not pastoral enough to justify his seeking the priesthood&#146;, Blagden has commented  (Blagden, 75). Yet he performed his duties as chaplain with great seriousness: he was responsible for nearly all the college services; for Sunday evensong he played the organ; and he is remembered for his plaintive music. He also served as divinity lecturer for Corpus from 1878 to 1902, and as librarian, dean, and vice-president of the college. He was remembered (and once caricatured) as a little bearded man with a shabby black coat, and loved as one who valiantly, if fumblingly, tried to know most of the undergraduates, inviting each to &#145;lunch and walk&#146; with him, which comprised offering the student a Gold Flake cigarette after lunch and sherry and then taking them on a vigorous two-hour walk along Oxfordshire lanes. He was a university representative on the Cowley board of poor-law guardians, and for more than thirty years took a strong pastoral interest in the fatherless boys of the Cowley workhouse school, &#145;helping them, and following them when they went out into the world, with letters and gifts&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of P. S. Allen</span>, 252).<br>
<br>Plummer produced an unbroken series of distinguished contributions to Anglo-Saxon, Celtic, and medieval Latin scholarship. Most impressive and most permanent of Plummer's more than a dozen books and numerous scholarly articles is his edition of Bede's <span class="italic">Ecclesiastical History</span> in two volumes (1896; new edn, 1946). To commemorate the 1000th anniversary of the death of King Alfred, Plummer was invited to be Ford's lecturer in English history in 1901, and his lectures were published as <span class="italic">Life and Times of Alfred the Great</span> (1902). He moved early into the field of Icelandic literature, then added Old Irish to his field of studies, publishing a <span class="italic">Vitae sanctorum Hiberniae</span> in 1910 and writing on Irish litanies and scribes at the end of his life (1925, 1926). Elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1924, he was also honoured with honorary doctorates from Durham (1921), Dublin (1924), and the National University of Ireland (1925). He was made an honorary member of the Royal Irish Academy in 1925. A list of Plummer's writings is to be found in the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the British Academy</span>, 15 (1929), 463&#150;76.<br>
<br>Plummer, who never married, died in the Acland Nursing Home, Oxford, on 8 September 1927 following minor surgery, and was buried in Oxford. He was the last of the life fellows at Corpus. Much of the force of living tradition at Corpus in the twentieth century was owing to him; much of his learning found its way into the work of colleagues and former students whom he encouraged. One of these was Percy Stafford Allen, who in 1892 began his life's work on the letters of Erasmus in Plummer's rooms in college. In 1924 Plummer was the prime mover in Allen's election to the presidency of Corpus. Plummer's own editorial work in Anglo-Saxon, Celtic, and later medieval history, liturgy, palaeography, and law&#151;richly illuminated by his own rare breadth of learning&#151;is still relevant and valuable, even after a century of substantial scholarship in medieval studies. His text of Bede, especially, has been described as final. For his generation, which was such a pivotal one for the transition from Victorian to modern, Plummer exemplified uniquely Arnoldian sweetness and light.<br>
