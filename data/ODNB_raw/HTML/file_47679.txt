<span class="headword">Metcalfe, Sir  Thomas Theophilus</span>, fourth baronet  (1795&#150;1853), <span class="occ">East India Company servant</span>, was born on 2 January 1795, the fourth child of Sir Thomas Theophilus Metcalfe, first baronet (1745&#150;1813), a major in the Bengal army, and his wife, Susannah Sophia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Debonnaire (<i>d</i>. 1815), who was formerly married to Major John Smith. He was younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18617/', "Charles Theophilus Metcalfe, third baronet and Baron Metcalfe")</script>, successively governor in India, Jamaica, and Canada. Thomas's father, who had made a fortune in India, on his return to England was elected a director of the East India Company, a position which he held from 1789 until his death in 1813. In 1796 Thomas senior was elected a member of parliament, and he was created a baronet in 1802. Thomas junior attended elementary school at Bromley in Kent and may have followed his two older brothers to Eton College. In 1812, when he was seventeen, the family sent him to India. After several months' study at Fort William College, Calcutta, he proceeded to Delhi in October 1813 to work for his brother Charles, recently appointed resident at Delhi. He remained uninterruptedly in Delhi for the next forty years. From 1819 to 1822 he was assistant resident under Sir David Ochterlony; subsequently he served again under his brother Charles during the latter's second term as resident (1825&#150;7). In 1835, after the murder of William Fraser, he became himself civil commissioner and agent to the governor-general, as the post of resident was then called. In this position, which he retained until his death in 1853, he not only conducted the company's diplomatic relations with the Mughal court, but was responsible for the civil administration of the Delhi territory.<br>
<br>Metcalfe's early years were troubled by a series of personal crises. A spendthrift as a youth, he squandered an inheritance of &pound;10,000, and left his father and then his brother Charles to pay his bills. His first wife, Grace Clarke, whom he married on 7 June 1815, died in Delhi in 1824, and their two sons died in infancy. He then married, on 13 July 1826, Felicity Anne Browne, with whom he had two sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18623/', "Theophilus John Metcalfe")</script>, and four daughters, before her death at Simla on 26 September 1842. About 1830 Thomas built as his residence the famed Metcalfe House on the banks of the Jumna, adjacent to the old city of Delhi. The house was a spacious flat-roofed bungalow with a columned veranda and curved portico surrounded by lakes and gardens. Lavishly furnished, the house contained Metcalfe's extensive library and art collection, including an entire room devoted to memorabilia of Napoleon Bonaparte. At the extreme opposite end of Delhi, near the Qutb Minar, Metcalfe converted a small domed octagonal Muslim tomb into a country garden house. Beside it he erected a small guest house known as Dilkusha (&#145;heart's delight&#146;). Within these residences Metcalfe lived the life at once of nabob and of squire. His daughter <a href="#cosubject_47679">Emily Bayley [<i>see below</i>]</a> remembered him as a man meticulous in personal habits, who every morning, punctually at ten o'clock, on his way to his carriage, &#145;passed through a row of servants, one holding his hat, another his gloves, another his handkerchief, another his gold-headed cane, and another his despatch-box&#146;. A patron of Indian arts, and a student of Mughal architecture, Metcalfe in 1844 commissioned a Delhi artist to produce a set of illustrations entitled <span class="italic">Reminiscences of Imperial Dehlie</span> [<i>sic</i>]. When his brother Charles died in 1846, Metcalfe inherited the baronetcy and the family estate, but chose to remain at his post in Delhi. On 3 November 1853, aged fifty-eight, he died under mysterious circumstances. His family believed that he had been poisoned by the Mughal queen Zinat Mahal Begam in revenge for his part in the exclusion of her son Jivan Bahkt from the imperial title.<br>

<a name="cosubject_47679"></a><span class="headword">Emily Anne Theophila Bayley <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Metcalfe]</span></span>, Lady Bayley  (1830&#150;1911)<span class="occ"></span>, Metcalfe's eldest daughter, was born in Meerut. She was sent at the age of five to be brought up by relatives in England, where, with her sister Georgiana, she lived with various members of the family and at a boarding house in Suffolk under the care of a governess. In 1848 Emily returned to India, where she lived with her widowed father in Delhi for two years. On 6 March 1850 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1749/', "Sir Edward Clive Bayley (1821&#150;1884)")</script>, then under-secretary of the foreign department of the government of India. During their twenty-eight years together in India she bore her husband thirteen children, two of whom died in infancy. One of the family's periodic home leaves coincided with the outbreak of the Indian mutiny in May 1857, when Metcalfe House was sacked by rebel sepoys. After Sir Edward's retirement in 1878, Emily returned to England, where her husband died in 1884. She died at her home, The Wilderness, Ascot, Berkshire, on 6 March 1911. Her book of reminiscences, written in retirement and published in 1980 as <span class="italic">The Golden Calm</span>, provides a nostalgic account of her family life and personal experiences both in England and in India.<br>
