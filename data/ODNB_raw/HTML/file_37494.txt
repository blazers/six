<span class="headword">Grumbold,  Robert</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1639, <em>d.</em> 1720), <span class="occ">mason and architect</span>, was baptized in June 1639 at Raunds, Northamptonshire, the son of Edward and Mary Grumbold, and was a member of a family of masons originating at the quarry villages of Raunds and Weldon which was active in the Northamptonshire area over several generations. It is not known where he learned his trade, but if it was not in Raunds it could have been in Cambridge, where a Thomas Grumbold (<i>d</i>. 1657) had settled; and it was in Cambridge that he established himself, perhaps succeeding to Thomas Grumbold's business. In the course of a long career he became the leading locally based figure in the architecture of the town during the later seventeenth century and the beginning of the eighteenth, and was involved in many of the collegiate building projects of the period.<br>
<br>Like many other master masons, Grumbold worked as an executant of both his own and others' designs. His first recorded project in Cambridge was the building of the west range of Clare College (1669&#150;76), where Thomas Grumbold had worked previously and where the design was probably the joint work of Grumbold, a &#145;surveyor&#146; called Jackson, and the college authorities. Subsequent works designed by him include the north range at Clare (1682&#150;6) and probably the rebuilding of St Catharine's College (1674&#150;1704). The most important project on which he acted as contracting mason only was the building of the library at Trinity College (1676&#150;84) to the design of Sir Christopher Wren, and he was also associated with the latter over some work at Ely Cathedral (1699). The contact with Wren is of particular interest in that it provided an influence on Grumbold's own architectural style, to be seen, for example, in the Clare north range; but otherwise his designs display a pleasant artisan manner rather than a full understanding of the grammar of classical architecture.<br>
<br>Grumbold's will indicates that he accumulated considerable wealth, acquiring a substantial amount of leasehold property in Cambridge. He appears to have had one son and one daughter living at the time of his death, which occurred in Cambridge on 7 December 1720.<br>
