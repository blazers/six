<span class="headword">Lloyd, Sir  Richard</span>  (1696/7&#150;1761), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was baptized on 31 May 1697 at St Mary's Church, Lichfield, the elder son of Talbot Lloyd of Lichfield, a professional soldier who died a prisoner of war in France, and his wife, Elizabeth Savage, natural daughter of his commanding officer, Lord Rivers. He attended Lichfield grammar school, where four contemporary judges, William Noel, Sir Thomas Parker, Sir John Eardley Wilmot, and Sir John Willes, were also educated. From Lichfield he went at the age of sixteen, in 1713, to St John's College, Cambridge, where he was elected a fellow in 1718. The fellowship lasted until 1723, the year of his call to the bar by the Middle Temple, after which he devoted his time to the law.<br>
<br>During the 1720s Lloyd married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1788), daughter of William Field (or Feild) of St Osyth's Priory and of Crustwic Manor in Weeley, Essex, and Arabella Savage, another natural daughter of General Lord Rivers. The couple had two sons and two daughters, and they settled close to Elizabeth's home region, probably at Ipswich. Their eldest son was born there in 1730 and about this time Lloyd acted as deputy recorder of Harwich. He held in due course the recorderships of Harwich, Orford, and Ipswich, and in 1738 he was appointed king's counsel and elected a bencher of his inn. With others of his rank, he was knighted on the occasion of the loyal address after the Jacobite rising of 1745. The year 1745 also brought him great good fortune when the dowager countess of Winchilsea, aged ninety, inexplicably left him her entire estate. This legacy enabled him immediately to enter parliament, as member for St Michael; and he remained in parliament until he became a judge, representing Maldon from 1747 and Totnes from 1754. It also enabled him in 1747 to buy Hintlesham Hall, near Ipswich, which had recently been rebuilt by Richard Powys (<i>d</i>. 1743), member of parliament for Orford, who had died heavily in debt, and in 1752 to acquire the Powys estates in Hadleigh. The total outlay for these properties was more than &pound;35,000. Lloyd also maintained a London residence in Queen Square.<br>
<br>In 1754 Lloyd succeeded William Murray as solicitor-general, an office he held for five years. Although he expected to follow him as attorney-general, when this was discussed in 1754 the duke of Newcastle wrote to Lord Hardwicke that his character would not support him and that he would be &#145;a very improper one&#146;  (Yorke, 2.315). The duke said he would not oppose Lloyd's appointment as chief justice of Chester, though he correctly predicted that he would not take it, &#145;as I doubt the circuits would be incompatible with his views of the chair&#146;  (ibid.). Two years later Lloyd expected promotion in the alterations after the death of Chief Justice Ryder, but was opposed by Newcastle, who appointed Sir Robert Henley as attorney-general. Newcastle reported a &#145;very unpleasant conversation&#146;  (ibid.) with Lloyd touching his expectations, and Hardwicke replied, &#145;my wish is the same as yours, that he may be let fall gently&#146;  (ibid., 317). Since Lloyd was unwilling to serve under Henley, he resigned and had to content himself for three years with the bare expectation of a judicial appointment, looking now even to Chester if it should become available.<br>
<br>The first vacancy went to William Noel, much to Lloyd's disappointment, but Noel was plagued by illness and Lloyd had high hopes of succeeding him. In February 1759, when Noel's successor was under consideration, Hardwicke wrote to Newcastle:<blockquote>I really think Sir Richard Lloyd has the best pretension of any body; [he] has served the King a great many years, and once in an eminent Station, with great steadiness; and behaved extremely well the last Session of Parliament. The King promised to do something for him, and can do nothing so easily as this. If this should become vacant, and he should be disappointed of it, after all his other disappointments, especially a late one, He will despair, and I shall despair for Him. (BL, Add. MS 32888, fol. 260)</blockquote>Newcastle submitted his name to the king, but Noel survived, and in November 1759 Lloyd was &#145;let fall&#146; into the seat in the court of exchequer vacated by the death of Mr Baron Legge. On this occasion Lord Keeper Henley wrote to Hardwicke that there had been no other applications and that &#145;I think both of Sir R.'s abilities and behavior to the king's government are such as to render him as proper an object of his majesty's favor on this occasion as any I could name to him&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 35596, fol. 9). Lloyd's judicial career lasted less than two years, for on 6 September 1761 he died at Northallerton, Yorkshire, while returning from the northern circuit. He was buried at Hintlesham, where an inscribed stone was later removed from his monument and placed in the churchyard. His wife survived him, and his eldest son, Richard Savage Lloyd (1730&#150;1810), succeeded to the estates at Crustwic and Hintlesham, and also followed his father as member of parliament for Totnes.<br>
