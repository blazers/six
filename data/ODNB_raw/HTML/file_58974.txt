<span class="headword">Green,  Evelyn Ward  Everett-</span>  (1856&#150;1932), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 17 November 1856 at 7 Upper Gower Street, London, the second of the three surviving daughters of George Pycock Green (<i>c</i>.1811&#150;1893), portrait and landscape artist, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11395/', "Mary Anne Everett Green, n&#233;e Wood (1818&#150;1895)")</script>, historian; she had also one older brother. She was baptized at Great Queen Street Wesleyan Methodist Chapel on 22 February 1857 as Eveline; later she adopted the spelling Evelyn and, like the rest of her family, the additional surname Everett. She was educated at home until the age of twelve, then for three years attended Mrs Bolton's Gower Street preparatory school. From her earliest childhood she invented stories to tell her sisters, and while at school wrote a historical tale about Lady Jane Grey. In 1872&#150;3 she went to Bedford College, London, with a Reid scholarship, but found the curriculum undemanding, and, released from her mother's earlier restrictions on her reading, fell into the delights of fiction as supplied by Mudie's circulating library. She also had time to write her first novel, which failed to find a publisher. After her year at Bedford she studied at the London Academy of Music, and in addition to practising several hours a day, continued to write. At this time she hoped to go to India to keep house for her brother, an engineer, but his death in 1876 ended that scheme and she threw herself instead into &#145;good works&#146;&#151;district visiting, Sunday and night school teaching, and eventually hospital nursing, possibly at St George's Hospital.<br>
<br>In 1880 Everett-Green's first book, <span class="italic">Tom Tempest's Victory</span>, was published under the pseudonym H. F. E., and in the following two years four other books appeared. Finding time to write amid the pressures of home life was difficult, and London winters did not suit her health, but a friend, Catherine Mainwaring Sladen (1845&#150;1943), whose family home had recently been broken up, suggested that she come to live with her in the country. From 1883 the two lived together, possibly initially in Somerset, and from the early 1890s in Surrey, at Albury near Guildford (first at Vale Cottage and later at Albury House). In 1911 they went abroad, eventually settling on Madeira, though during the First World War they lived at Battramsley House near Lymington, Hampshire. Everett-Green came to England every year, visiting her sister Gertrude, wife of James Gow, and doing business with her publishers.<br>
<br>Everett-Green's works are more remarkable for their number&#151;about 350&#151;and their variety than their content. At first she wrote principally for children and boys, dispensing the piety inculcated by her Methodist upbringing, but she soon turned to the books for slightly older girls for which she is now best remembered, typically taking a houseful of girls and reviewing their development from the schoolroom to adulthood. Careers are mentioned without disapproval, but marriage was the inevitable ending. Between 1890 and 1909 she produced some fifty historical tales, occasionally making use of her mother's work and ranging widely through medieval and modern history. After two early three-volume novels she left adult fiction alone for nearly twenty years, returning to it shortly before her move abroad; after that romantic fiction gradually became her sole genre. In 1909 she adopted the pseudonym Cecil Adair for some of her fiction, and these books, remarkable for their chaste sensationalism, enjoyed a certain success. She had earlier sometimes used the pseudonyms E. (or Evelyn) Ward, and Evelyn Dare, and occasionally collaborated with Louisa Bedford and Emma and Beatrice Marshall.<br>
<br>Everett-Green died at her home, Quinta Pico de S&atilde;o Jo&atilde;o, Funchal, Madeira, on 23 April 1932. Although her books were sufficiently popular in their own day to bring her in an adequate income, they lack real distinction, and are now read, if at all, solely for the light they cast on their social background. That she wrote no series or sequels also told against her continuing popularity, and even before her death her girls' books had become the victims of changing times.<br>
