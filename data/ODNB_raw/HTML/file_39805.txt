<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ellmann,  Richard David</span>  (1918&#150;1987), <span class="occ">literary scholar and biographer</span>, was born on 15 March 1918 in Highland Park, Detroit, Michigan, the second of the three sons (there were no daughters) of James Isaac Ellmann, lawyer, a Jewish Romanian immigrant, and his wife, Jeanette Barsook, an immigrant from Kiev in Ukraine. He attended local schools before going to Yale University, where he graduated with exceptional distinction in English in 1939 and completed an MA dissertation in 1941.<br>
<br>On the entry of the United States into the Second World War in 1942 Ellmann joined the office of strategic services (OSS), but that August he began his academic career as an instructor at Harvard University. This was interrupted in 1943 when he enlisted in the American navy and was posted to a construction battalion. Although he disliked military service, he was to turn it to account in 1945 when he unexpectedly found himself seconded to the OSS in London. That September he visited the widow of William Butler Yeats in Dublin. Impressed by his knowledge of her husband's work, she gave him access to her immense archive. He returned to Ireland immediately on his discharge from the navy in May 1946 and wrote a LittB at Trinity College, Dublin, while simultaneously undertaking a Yale PhD on Yeats's life and writings. This, the first Yale doctorate on a twentieth-century writer, was published in 1949 as <span class="italic">Yeats: the Man and the Masks</span> and remains one of the best introductions to the poet's work.<br>
<br>In 1947 Ellmann returned to teach at Harvard, where he met, and in August 1949 married, a talented Irish-American feminist critic, Mary Donahue, the daughter of William Henry Donahue, baker, of Newburyport, Massachusetts. Two years later he was appointed professor of English at Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois. He had already begun research for his biography of James Joyce, but his next book was a sophisticated critical study of Yeats's poetry, <span class="italic">The Identity of Yeats</span> (1954). His magisterial <span class="italic">James Joyce</span> appeared in 1959 and immediately confirmed his reputation as the outstanding literary biographer of his generation, its research, narrative control, and wit setting new standards in the genre. His growing distinction was reflected in a series of academic honours, fellowships, and visiting professorships, and in 1963 by his promotion to the Franklin Bliss Snyder chair at Northwestern, which he held until 1968. Deeply involved in editing Joyce's writings and letters, he also found time to co-edit <span class="italic">The Modern Tradition</span> (1965), a collection of key modernist texts, as well as anthologies of modern poetry. In 1967 he published <span class="italic">Eminent Domain</span>, a series of elegant essays on Yeats's various literary relationships. The following year he moved to Yale as professor of English, and it was supposed that he would see out his career at his old alma mater. But after only two years he was invited to apply for the Goldsmiths' chair of English literature at Oxford and was duly elected (1970), with a fellowship at New College.<br>
<br>The move to Oxford was partly prompted by Ellmann's proposed biography of Oscar Wilde, but was also because, established at Yale, he could predict exactly which meetings he would be attending on any given day in the foreseeable future; Oxford offered no such predictability. The move was marred when his wife suffered a cerebral haemorrhage that permanently confined her to a wheelchair. Of their three children, the eldest, Stephen, remained in the United States while their two daughters, Maud and Lucy, settled in England with their parents. Ellmann delivered his inaugural lecture, &#145;Literary biography&#146;, on 4 May 1971, and in 1972 he published <span class="italic">Ulysses on the Liffey</span>, which examined the principles of construction of Joyce's novel. A book of essays in the following year, <span class="italic">Golden Codgers</span>, ranged from George Eliot to T. S. Eliot, and <span class="italic">The Consciousness of Joyce</span> appeared in 1977. Ellmann was at once bemused and delighted by Oxford; his forte was the seminar rather than the lecture, and he excelled in his supervision of graduate students.<br>
<br>In 1984 Ellmann retired as Goldsmiths' professor and took up the Woodruff chair at Emory University in Georgia. But he remained resident in Oxford, holding both an honorary fellowship at New College (1987) and an extraordinary fellowship at Wolfson College (1984), and he and his wife continued to keep open house at 39 St Giles' to a wide circle of friends. During this time he had been working on his biography of Oscar Wilde, garnering new information and drafting and redrafting the book. He was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1979, and had honorary degrees from several American universities and from G&ouml;teborg, Sweden.<br>
<br>Ellmann was a tall man, balding and bespectacled, and tending to plumpness, with a warm smile and an infectious laugh. It was in the summer of 1986 that his friends began to notice a slight slurring of speech and an awkwardness of posture. These symptoms became more pronounced and motor neurone disease was diagnosed. With typical fortitude he refused to be intimidated by this terrible illness, and when his speech finally failed he communicated through a ticker-tape machine, the messages showing that he had lost nothing of his intellectual edge and personal kindness. His final days were occupied with preparing <span class="italic">Oscar Wilde</span> (1987) for the press; he was able to read the proofs shortly before he died in Oxford on 13 May 1987.<br>
