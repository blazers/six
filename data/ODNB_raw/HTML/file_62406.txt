<span class="headword">Westaway,  Katharine Mary</span>  (1893&#150;1973), <span class="occ">classical scholar and headmistress</span>, was born on 8 February 1893 at School House, 128 Chapel Street, Dalton in Furness, Lancashire, the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/105218/', "Frederick William Westaway")</script>, headmaster and HM inspector of schools, and his wife, Mary Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Collar (1865&#150;1947), formerly of Hammersmith, London. Frederick Westaway was a teacher, specializing in mathematics and science, and at the time of Kate Westaway's birth he was a headmaster in Dalton. Her mother was also a teacher before her marriage. The pedagogic tradition was strong on both sides of the family.<br>
<br>By 1902 Frederick Westaway was a schools inspector in Bedford, where his daughter entered the high school, one of the two Harpur Trust girls' schools. As the only child of scholarly parents, Kate Westaway was close to both and the focus of attention particularly of her father, who coached her in mathematics. Fortunately, perhaps, she was an academically able child. Her early achievements included school exhibitions, honours in public examinations, and an open scholarship in classics to Newnham College, Cambridge, in 1912. She was well liked at school and a keen supporter of school societies, although her only attempt at sport was to play tennis and suffer ignominious defeat in her time as head girl of the school. Her own account of this was humorous and self-deprecating and none of her considerable academic success appeared to make her either boastful or the object of envy.<br>
<br>While at Cambridge Westaway studied for both the classical tripos (she was awarded a first in part two in 1915) and a London BA degree (1914, graduating MA in 1917). At Cambridge she entered fully into college life, becoming a well-liked president of the college debating society. Her sense of fun combined with a calm demeanour were to be lifetime characteristics. The war postponed a plan to study at Heidelberg and she began a course at the teacher training college at Cheltenham Ladies' College. She was quickly offered a teaching post in the school but by 1919 had been awarded the Marion Kennedy research fellowship at Newnham. She studied at Leiden and London, writing her thesis, &#145;The educational theory of Plutarch&#146; (DLitt, London, 1921), which was published in 1922. In 1920 she was appointed lecturer in classics at Royal Holloway College and seemed set for an academic career of teaching and research. Then in 1924 the headship of Bedford high school fell vacant. With the encouragement of her father and Bedford friends she applied and was appointed to the post at the age of thirty-one.<br>
<br>Westaway rapidly established herself with authority among both staff and pupils, despite the fact that some of the former had been her own teachers. Her aspirations as a scholar took second place to the educational, pedagogic, administrative, and social demands made upon the headmistress of a large, successful girls' school. She embarked on a highly successful scheme to provide new buildings for the school and to diversify the curriculum so as to cater for the less academically able girls. She developed facilities for teaching in science, built a new gymnasium and library, encouraged the teaching of domestic science, and introduced secretarial and pre-nursing courses for older girls. Meanwhile the school continued to send girls to Oxford, London, and Cambridge, and to other universities. She dealt firmly with staff, pupils, and governors alike while maintaining good relations and the respect of all. There was rejoicing when she refused appointment as head of Cheltenham Ladies' College in the mid-1930s.<br>
<br>Nationally, Kate Westaway served on the executive committee of the Association of Headmistresses and as a member of the Burnham committee. She decided to retire in 1949 and moved to the Yorkshire dales with her lifelong companion, Eleanor Osborne. In retirement she served a ten-year stint as a Harpur Trust girls' schools governor. She returned to Bedford in the 1960s and died at Clapham Hospital, Clapham, Bedfordshire, on 16 June 1973. Her ashes were buried at Renhold church.<br>
