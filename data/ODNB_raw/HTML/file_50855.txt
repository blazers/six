<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Briginshaw,  Richard William</span>, Baron Briginshaw  (1908&#150;1992), <span class="occ">trade union leader</span>, was born on 15 May 1908 at 183 Mayall Road, Brixton, London, the first son of Richard Briginshaw, newspaper worker, and his wife, Alice Jubilee, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Coates. He was educated at Stuart School, Brixton. Although his background was classic working class and he left elementary school at fourteen to take a job as a printer's devil, his early days were not poverty stricken: his father had a comparatively well-paid and secure job as a printer with Odhams Press. Even so there was a great deal of poverty in homes close to the Briginshaw family and in later years Briginshaw (Dick or Briggie, as he was universally known) vividly recalled the ambience of his childhood in Brixton&#151;children at his school without boots, often without food, widespread poverty because of unemployment, and a depression that was to colour and determine his political thinking and the course of his life.<br>
<br>Briginshaw's father encouraged him to read and through night school and his own ambitious drive he studied economics and law in his spare time, and eventually earned a diploma from University College, London. At the same time he worked his way from job to job as a trainee in the machine rooms of Fleet Street, not as a skilled compositor but as a machine hand. He found work in virtually every machine room in Fleet Street and as he moved from newspaper to newspaper he quickly acquired a reputation as an articulate union advocate. On 15 November 1931 he married Catherine Morritt (1910/11&#150;1989), daughter of Harry Morritt, a Covent Garden porter. They had three sons.<br>
<br>In 1938 Briginshaw was elected assistant secretary of the London machine branch of the National Society of Operative Printers and Assistants (NATSOPA), one of the most influential units in the union. He became the youngest official in the union. His election to secretary of the branch seemed to be a virtual formality&#151;a post that would have put him in line for the top job as the union's general secretary, then occupied by George Isaacs, later minister of labour in Attlee's government. But Briginshaw was already deeply radicalized and had joined the Communist Party. He was a leading organizer of the Printers' Anti-Fascist Movement, which Isaacs and the NATSOPA executive steadfastly refused to recognize. To the union hierarchy this was a communist &#145;front&#146; organization and beyond the fringe of acceptability. They ordered Briginshaw to withdraw from it. He refused and was dismissed from his union post. The period that followed was frequently a hard struggle for Briginshaw but he refused to yield to the union's anti-communist policy. He volunteered for the army shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War and was finally called up in 1941. He served in India, the Middle East, and western Europe, several times refusing a commission on the grounds of wanting to remain among the rank-and-file as an ordinary soldier.<br>
<br>Briginshaw returned to civilian life at the end of 1945, with no job prospect in the union and the need to return to any Fleet Street machine room that would employ him. By then he had joined the Labour Party, though he remained firmly on the left, and his relationship with the right-wing union establishment was still abrasive. Yet by 1948 he had re-established himself and was elected again as assistant secretary of the London machine branch. From then his rise was rapid. In 1949 he was elected a national officer of NATSOPA and in 1951 he was elected general secretary&#151;succeeding (after a brief interregnum) his old foe George Isaacs, who had held on to his union post despite being a minister in the Attlee cabinet. Briginshaw remained general secretary until his retirement at the end of 1974.<br>
<br>Briginshaw's twenty-three years as leader of the strongest print union in the country was a remarkable stint by any standards. His awkward, often almost disdainful, style brought him more enemies from among the other print union leaders than from among the newspaper barons themselves. Even his political friends on the left found him a difficult ally, since he was often more cavalier with them than with political opponents&#151;or with employers, some of whom became close enough to be regarded, almost, as friends. He often found himself alongside strange bedfellows, including Lord Beaverbrook, with whom he formed an &#145;unholy alliance&#146;&#151;as his critics claimed&#151;during the campaign opposing Britain's entry into the Common Market. Briginshaw regularly wrote feature articles for all the Express group, denouncing the government negotiations, and when Britain eventually joined the community he became a joint founder of the Get Britain Out campaign. In 1969 his support for Rupert Murdoch was a substantial factor in Murdoch's acquisition of <span class="italic">The Sun</span> (the former <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span>), which had been put on the market by the International Publishing Corporation. To the fury of his fellow print union leaders he made clear his preference for Murdoch over Robert Maxwell as a potential purchaser of the paper, on the grounds that Murdoch was a better guarantor of job security and higher wages for his members.<br>
<br>Briginshaw's reputation in the print industry was that of a tough negotiator and a ruthless, albeit extremely shrewd, campaigner for his members. He symbolized the uncompromising attitude of print workers in their demands for higher wages, job protection, and the closed shop. Yet he was also a modernizer and foresaw much of what was to transform the newspaper and print industry long before Murdoch performed his dramatic switch to Wapping. He predicted the revolution in print technology and privately admitted that the &#145;gravy train&#146; would hit the buffers before long. He always wanted one big union for the printing industry rather than a multitude of smaller, specialized craft unions. In 1966 he took a big step along that road by bringing about a merger between NATSOPA and the National Union of Printing, Bookbinding, and Paper Workers, to form the Society of Graphical and Allied Trades (SOGAT). Nevertheless, the two sections soon fell apart amid bitter recriminations, and remerged only after Briginshaw's retirement. He was a formidable opponent of all attempts at an incomes policy&#151;whether operated by Conservative or Labour governments. He resigned from the Labour Party in 1968 because he disagreed with the Wilson government's introduction of a statutory pay policy, though he soon rejoined. His membership of the TUC general council (1965&#150;75) was less significant than it might have been, considering his seniority as a union leader, and he was never a member of the TUC's &#145;inner circle&#146;. His constant opposition to TUC policy on incomes, and indeed to any co-operation with government that might limit trade union freedom, left him always on the margin of influence.<br>
<br>Briginshaw caused a mild sensation by accepting a life peerage as Baron Briginshaw of Southwark when he retired at the end of 1974. A year later he published <span class="italic">Abolish the House of Lords</span>&#151;denouncing the House of Lords as &#145;a creaking anachronism&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 31 March 1992). He served on the council of the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) from 1974 to 1976, and was a member of the British Overseas Trade Board (1975&#150;7) and the board of the British National Oil Corporation (1976&#150;9). He was a member of the court of Cranfield Institute of Technology and served for six years as a governor of Dulwich College. His retirement was marred by allegations of malpractice following the discovery that union funds had been moved into Swiss bank accounts in the wake of trade-union legislation by the Heath government in 1971. Members of the NATSOPA section of the merged union took legal action against Briginshaw and three colleagues, accusing them of misapplying funds. He was finally cleared of all charges in 1982, when he made it clear that his actions had been wholly concerned with protecting union funds against possible seizure under Heath's new legislation.<br>
<br>Briginshaw was a tall, powerfully built, handsome man, whose healthy bronzed appearance often persuaded his critics that he had just returned from holiday. As he grew older his carefully coiffed silver-grey hair crowned a strong, bespectacled face. His wife, Catherine, died in 1989, but by then he had formed relationships with several women and had one son with Kathleen Maybin and a son and daughter with his secretary and personal assistant, Joan Wing. He died at the Mayday Hospital, Croydon, on 26 March 1992, of a perforated duodenal ulcer. He was survived by his six children.<br>
