<span class="headword">Fitzgeffry <span class="st"> [Fitzgeffrey]</span>,  Charles</span>  (<em>c.</em>1575&#150;1638), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and poet</span>, was born in Fowey, Cornwall, the son of Alexander Fitzgeffry, a clergyman formerly of Bedfordshire. Fitzgeffry matriculated at Broadgates Hall, Oxford, in 1590 and was awarded a BA in January 1597 and an MA in July 1600. While at Oxford he published his poem, <span class="italic">Sir Francis Drake, his Honorable Lifes Commendation and his Tragical Deathes Lamentation</span> (1596), which he dedicated to Queen Elizabeth and to which commendatory verses were prefixed by, among others, his Broadgates friends, Thomas Mychelbourne and Richard and Francis Rous. The poem was favourably reviewed by Francis Meres in <span class="italic">Palladis tamia: Wits Treasury</span> (1598), with reference to &#145;yong Charles Fitz-Jeffrey, that high touring Falcon&#146;; and there are several quotations from the poem in <span class="italic">England's Parnassus</span> (1600). In 1601 Fitzgeffry published a volume of Latin epigrams and epitaphs, <span class="italic">Caroli Fitzgeofridi affaniae, sive, Epigrammatum libri tres, ejusdem cenotaphia</span>, which includes epigrams addressed to Michael Drayton, Samuel Daniel, Sir John Harrington, William Percy, and Thomas Campion, and epitaphs on Edmund Spenser, Richard Tarlton, and Thomas Nashe. An epigram &#145;To my Deare Freind Mr Charles Fitz-Jeffrey&#146; appears among the poems &#145;To Worthy Persons&#146;, appended to John Davies of Hereford's <span class="italic">Scourge of Folly</span> ([1610&#150;11]). By this time Fitzgeffry was ordained. In 1603, through friendship with the Rous brothers, he had been presented to the living of St Dominick, near Saltash, Cornwall, by their father, Sir Anthony Rous, a prominent Cornish puritan.<br>
<br>Born and (apparently) brought up in Fowey, Fitzgeffry maintained his connections with the town. Probably in 1625 Bevill Grenvile of Stow represented to &#145;the wife of the Chancellor of the Diocese&#146; the grievances of the inhabitants of Fowey against their &#145;very worthless Vicar&#146; and the town's wish &#145;to have a lecturer at their own charge &hellip; The man they have chosen is Mr F[itz]G[effry]&#146;  (Granville, 196). There is no record of Fitzgeffry's appointment, but his subsequent correspondence and his close association with the Rashleighs of Menabilly, the leading family in Fowey, suggests that he did become Fowey's lecturer. On 17 February 1629 Fitzgeffry dedicated to Mrs Anne Rashleigh a sermon entitled <span class="italic">A Preparative to Repentance</span>, preached before the House of Commons at the general fast on Ash Wednesday  (Cornwall RO, R(S) 1/460). Further, it was Fitzgeffry (rather than the vicar of Fowey, Edward Basill) who preached Anne Rashleigh's funeral sermon in 1631. Besides commending her wifely behaviour, private devotions, hospitality, and charity, Fitzgeffry praised Mrs Rashleigh for &#145;constantly repairing to the Temple &hellip; not only on the Lord's day, but on the Lecture day, and by her attention and devotion in the Temple&#146;  (Cornwall RO, R(S) 1/462). On 24 March 1634 Fitzgeffry wrote to Lord Robartes (whose sister had married Fitzgeffry's patron, William Rous) about a thunderstorm which had caused considerable damage in Fowey. Fitzgeffry, who had been residing in the town at the time, described how he &#145;lay waking &hellip; my chamber window being right opposite to that Pinnacle of the Church which suffered&#146;. Interpreting the storm in providential terms as &#145;that warning-piece from heaven&#146;, he had expected the wicked to be punished by it and was puzzled that the only injury was to Mrs Rashleigh's maid servant, &#145;whom for this seven years I have known to be of sober, modest, religious conversation&#146;. Fitzgeffry also complained to Robartes of a shortage of time due to &#145;my manifold employments&#146;, reinforcing the impression that he was lecturer of Fowey as well as rector of St Dominick  (Cornwall RO, FS/3/1032).<br>
<br>Fitzgeffry's sermon at the Cornish quarter sessions of 1630 was published the following year, with reference to &#145;Theese two yeeres of dearth&#146;. Condemning those who hoarded corn with the intention of selling it at a higher price, Fitzgeffry proclaimed, &#145;let Ministers (as his Majesty commandeth) joyne forces with the Magistrates against this Monster, Avarice&#146;. Going on to encourage JPs to demonstrate the important puritan virtues of charity and hospitality to the poor, Fitzgeffry tacitly supported the government's <span class="roman">Book of Orders</span> of January 1631, which may explain Cornish puritan zeal for the book  (C. Fitzgeffry, <span class="italic">Curse of the Corne-Horders</span>, 1631). In 1636, when the problem of Turkish piracy on the south coasts of Cornwall and Devon intensified, Fitzgeffry published a sermon urging charity towards those taken captive by the Turks and care for their dependants, both in prayer and generous giving. He dedicated the sermon, which was originally preached in Plymouth, to the mayor and brethren of the town and praised the people of Plymouth for their monthly collections for the cause  (C. Fitzgeffry, <span class="italic">Compassion towards Captives</span>, 1637).<br>
<br>In addition to his sermons, Fitzgeffry published numerous poems and epigrams. He prefixed commendatory verses to Storer's <span class="italic">Life and Death of Thomas, Earl Cromwell</span> (1599), Davies of Hereford's <span class="italic">Microcosmus</span> (1603), Sylvester's <span class="italic">Bartas, his Devine Weekes and Workes</span> (1605), and William Vaughan's <span class="italic">Golden Grove</span> (1608). In his devotional poem &#145;The blessed birth-day celebrated in some pious meditations on the angels anthem&#146;, published in 1634 and reprinted 1636 and 1651, Fitzgeffry reflected on Christ's nativity. He had resigned as rector of St Dominick by 3 March 1636 when John Fitzgeffry, presumably his son, was presented to the living. Charles Fitzgeffry died less than two years later, on 24 February 1638, and was buried under the communion table in St Dominick parish church.<br>
