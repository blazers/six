<span class="headword">Gardner,  (Alfred Thomas) Goldie</span>  (1890&#150;1958), <span class="occ">racing motorist and speed record breaker</span>, was born at East Dene, Charteris Road, Woodford, Essex, on 30 May 1890, the son of Alfred Gardner (1852/3&#150;1922), an East India broker, and his wife, Isabella McIntosh, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Goldie (1866/7&#150;1951). After preparatory school at Pelham House, Folkestone, he was educated at Uppingham School, where he acquired a motorcycle, and then in 1910 entered a broker's office in Colombo, Ceylon. This was followed in 1913 by a business position in northern Burma but typhoid and malaria forced his return to Britain early in 1914. On the outbreak of the First World War he was commissioned in the Royal Field Artillery and was posted to the western front in 1915, gaining the Military Cross in 1916. Badly wounded in his right leg in August 1917, he underwent twenty operations. He relinquished his commission on account of ill health in April 1919, and was discharged from the army in 1921 with the rank of major.<br>
<br>Gardner had become a car owner in 1915 and in 1924 began racing an Austin Seven at Brooklands, but then switched to French cars, a two-seater Salmson in 1926 and in 1929 an Amilcar, which he raced in the Irish international grand prix at Phoenix Park, Dublin, in 1929 and 1930. In 1930 he met Cecil Kimber, managing director of MG cars of Abingdon, with which he began an association that lasted over twenty years. He purchased one of the firm's new MG 750 cc C-type Montlh&eacute;ry Midget cars and took delivery for the Brooklands double twelve hour race in May 1931. In a bad accident at the Ulster tourist trophy race in 1932 his MG came off the road and somersaulted three times, throwing him out and fracturing his already disabled right leg. This was saved from amputation during the four months he spent in Newtonards hospital. He gave up road racing but returned to the track in September 1934 to take part in the 500 mile race at Brooklands, coming third in a 1100 cc MG K3 co-driven by J. D. Benjafield. He took part in the 1935 500 mile race, then went to the USA to compete in a stockcar event at Daytona early in 1936 in a Lincoln Zephyr saloon. While in Daytona he married, in March 1936, Mariel King, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Boalt, who returned with him to Britain but went back to the USA soon afterwards and divorced him in Florida in 1937.<br>
<br>In 1935 Lord Nuffield had instructed the MG works to give up direct involvement in racing, but Gardner persisted with record-breaking attempts. He purchased a 1100 cc single-seater MG K3 Magnette in which, at Brooklands on 28 August 1936, he established a new outer circuit class G (750 cc up to 1100 cc) record of 124.4 m.p.h., and went on to cover fifty miles at 119 m.p.h. With renewed support from MG, he set a class G record of 148.5 m.p.h. for the flying start mile on the autobahn at Frankfurt in June 1937. He followed this, later that month, with a series of records at Montlh&eacute;ry, though he failed to break the 150 m.p.h. barrier, which was his target. To push the speeds further Gardner bought the MG &#145;Magic Magnette&#146; EX 135 from its owner, the record breaker George Eyston, and this was adapted with an enclosed streamlined body designed by Reid Railton, and with an MG K3 engine, constructed at Abingdon with Nuffield's support and approval.<br>
<br>Gardner's modified MG Magnette was ready in June 1938 and achieved a 186.5 m.p.h. record for the flying mile on the Frankfurt autobahn in November 1938. At the end of that year he was awarded the RAC Segrave trophy. On his birthday, 30 May 1939, at the new Dessau autobahn in Germany which was closed to traffic for his attempt, Gardner broke the 200 m.p.h. barrier for a 1100 cc car, achieving a mean speed of 203.16 m.p.h. in two runs over the flying mile. On his return to Britain his car was displayed in MG showrooms.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Gardner rejoined the Royal Artillery and was posted to a mechanical transport training battery in Yorkshire, with the rank of major. He married at Bridlington register office, on 7 September 1940, Una (1914&#150;2008), daughter of Francis Eagle-Clarke, solicitor, of Saxton House, Willerby, Yorkshire. They had a daughter. Promoted to lieutenant-colonel in 1942, he was an instructor at a mechanical training school in Rhyl, and then in 1944 joined 21 Army group organizing transport for the allied civilian administration in the liberated countries of north-west Europe.<br>
<br>Before the war Gardner had planned attempts on the 750 cc record (class H). The chassis and body of his record-breaking car were removed from storage at the end of the war and fitted with a new 750 cc MG engine. A first attempt on the Milan autostrada in July 1946 was unsuccessful but a second attempt, on a straight stretch of motorway at Jabbeke, Belgium, in October 1946 pushed the 750 cc record (which had stood for ten years) to 159.2 m.p.h. for the flying mile. Frustrated by the lack of support from MG, he drove Jaguar cars in 1948, but returned to MG in 1949 when the firm resumed its support for motorsport. In the birthday honours list in May 1949 he was appointed OBE. At Jabbeke in September 1949 he recovered the 500 cc (class I) record with 154.2 m.p.h., and in July 1950 he broke the 120 m.p.h. barrier for class J engines (up to 350 cc) with a 121 m.p.h. flying mile. By 1950 Gardner, then in his sixtieth year, had achieved for MG five of the ten internationally recognized capacity class records. In that year MG production at Abingdon for the first time exceeded 10,000 cars. He published an autobiography in 1951.<br>
<br>North America was an important market for MG, and Gardner's final record attempts were at Bonneville Salt Flats, Utah, in August 1951 and 1952 with a supercharged MG TD engine. The first was thwarted by rain, and in the second his car spun and struck a marker pole, which in turn smashed into his helmet. Although his head injury was not considered severe at the time, its longer-term effects forced his retirement from further record attempts. He settled at Eastbourne, Sussex, and died there, from a cerebrovascular accident, at St Mary's Hospital, on 25 August 1958.<br>
<br>Gardner was known for his courage. As those who knew him well recognized, his appearance of calm before attempting a record masked an apprehension of the danger connected with each attempt. Rather than seeking small, incremental improvements in speeds, he went all out in each drive. His record breaking was undertaken as a private owner, though with backing from the companies which supplied his cars and their components. He justified his pursuit of light car speed records for their technical and advertising value, as indicated by the international publicity they received. His 1938 MG, which achieved the 200 m.p.h. record on the eve of the Second World War, is preserved at the Heritage Motor Centre, Gaydon.<br>
