<span class="headword">Davies <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Touchet; <em>other married name </em>Douglas]</span>, Lady  Eleanor</span>  (1590&#150;1652), <span class="occ">prophetess</span>, was the fifth daughter of George Touchet, eleventh Baron Audley (1550/51&#150;1617), and his first wife, Lucy Mervyn (<i>d</i>. 1609/10), daughter of Sir James Mervyn of Fonthill Gifford, Wiltshire. She had two younger brothers. Her father's barony was recalled in one of the variants of her name which she was to deploy in her writings: Eleanor Audeley. She was to be fluid in the use of the names which birth and marriage gave her, deploying them in pamphlet and petition according to context and the identity she was presenting. Audley was a soldier; he served successively as governor of Utrecht in the Netherlands and governor of Kells in co. Meath. In 1616 he was created Baron Audley of Orier, co. Armagh, and earl of Castlehaven, co. Cork. Eleanor Touchet probably spent much of her childhood at the family home in Stalbridge, Dorset. She was literate in Latin as well as English, and had a good understanding of theology and the law (she administered her father's estate after his death). Some time between the ages of ten and fifteen she moved with her family to Ulster.<br>
<br>At the age of nineteen, in March 1609, Touchet married the poet and attorney-general for Ireland <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7245/', "Sir John Davies (bap. 1569, d. 1626)")</script>, who was not only more than twice her age but also had a violent temper and was, according to his contemporaries, ugly and exceedingly overweight. The couple had three children. Their daughter Lucy Davies [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65147/', "Hastings, Lucy")</script>] was born in Dublin in 1613. In her eleventh year Lucy was married to the son and heir of the earl of Huntingdon, but continued to reside with her mother for another two years and remained her close friend and supporter throughout her life. Of the two sons, one, Richard, died in infancy, and the other, Jack, who may have been autistic, drowned in Ireland in 1617 or shortly thereafter. In 1619 Sir John Davies was relieved of his position by the king, and the family moved to London. Some three years later, Eleanor Davies became involved in at least two personal disputes, one of which was brought to Star Chamber. By 1623 she was living in the manor of Englefield in Berkshire.<br>
<br>In 1625 Davies took a thirteen-year-old Scottish boy, George Carr, into her protection. Carr, who was deaf and mute, had impressed London society by his fortune-telling abilities. Under Davies's care, he began to speak and to utter prophecies, but when his talents failed him he ran away to sea. None the less, he had a profound effect on his patron. On 28 July 1625 Davies was awakened by a heavenly voice which declared, &#145;There is Ninteene yeares and a halfe to the day of Judgement and you as the meek Virgin&#146;  (E. Douglas, <span class="italic">The Lady Eleanor, her Appeale to the High Court of Parliament</span>, 1641, 15). That same year of 1625 she published her first pamphlet, <span class="italic">A Warning to the Dragon and All his Angels</span>, in which she interpreted political developments in Europe as a fulfilment of the books of <span class="roman">Daniel</span> and <span class="roman">Revelation</span>. Her husband's anger at her activities prompted him to burn her prophecies. Davies responded by dressing in widow's weeds and predicting that he would die in less than three years. One day in December of the following year, she began to weep uncontrollably during dinner, and three days later her husband died. There followed a protracted legal dispute over Sir John Davies's estate between his widow and the family of their son-in-law, and Lady Eleanor temporarily lost possession of Englefield and also her estate at Pirton in Hertfordshire (purchased by her husband as her jointure). This was only the first of many court cases involving Davies's ownership of these properties.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1627 Davies remarried. Her second husband was a professional soldier, Sir Archibald Douglas (<i>d</i>. 1644). Lady Eleanor gained increasing renown for her prophecies, many of which were anagrammatic; she read into her own name of Eleanor Audelie the exhortation &#145;Reveale O Daniel&#146;. She was even consulted about Henrietta Maria's first pregnancy, first by a royal servant and then by the queen herself. However, she also encountered hostility from Charles I's household, especially for her prognostication concerning the death of the duke of Buckingham and her personal warnings to the king. Sir Archibald, possibly in the hope of regaining royal favour, proceeded to follow his predecessor's example in destroying her papers. On this occasion Lady Eleanor announced that her husband would be judged by God, arguing that the prophecy was fulfilled when he became afflicted by a mental disorder.<br>
<br>If the encounter with Carr signals one turning point in Lady Eleanor Davies's prophetic career, a second is marked by the trial of her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66794/', "Mervin Touchet, second earl of Castlehaven")</script>, in 1631. Castlehaven was indicted for sodomy and for abetting the rape of his wife by a servant. Sir Archibald and Lady Eleanor's sisters petitioned unsuccessfully for his release, while she continued to protest his innocence for many years. But the tide of public opinion was against him after he was found guilty and executed. In 1633 she travelled abroad on the pretence of accompanying her husband to the Spa. In Amsterdam she organized the printing of more of her prophecies, but after smuggling them back into England she presented a hand-written paper to Archbishop Laud, &#145;to give him a taste or warning of his judgment at hand, the hand writing (<i>Dan</i>. 5) served on him in his gallery&#146;  (Cope, <span class="italic">Handmaid</span>, 65). He had the illicitly printed books publicly burned. She was arrested, brought before high commission, fined &pound;3000, and imprisoned. At this point her second marriage effectively ended.<br>
<br>A year after her release from the Gatehouse in 1635 Davies, accompanied by two friends, Marie Noble and Susan Walker, caused a series of disturbances in Lichfield Cathedral by claiming the right to sit in the seats reserved for the wives of cathedral dignitaries. Then, on a subsequent occasion, Davies entered the cathedral, sat on the bishop's throne, and declared that she was primate and metropolitan. This gesture was followed by one equally shocking: she poured tar over the altar, telling worshippers that she was sprinkling it with holy water as preparation for their next communion. In her 1652 tract <span class="italic">Bethlehem Signifying the House of Bread</span>, Davies explained that she had been driven to her act by the erection of a giant crucifix in the cathedral and by the installation of a purple woollen altar hanging which obscured the ten commandments on the wall. She saw her spectacular attack on these profane objects as the fulfilment in the Last Age of <span class="roman">Exodus</span> 32:20, in which Moses destroyed the golden calf worshipped by the Israelites. She was immediately re-arrested and committed to Bethlem Hospital (Bedlam). In April 1638 she was moved to the Tower, from which she was released in September 1640. She was imprisoned for debt and infringements of the publishing laws on at least two more occasions, and in 1651, the year before her death, she was again gaoled for a short period.<br>
<br>Despite her imprisonments, Davies published extensively during the 1640s. She was convinced that the end of the world was imminent, originally claiming that the day of judgment would occur in 1644. Her periodization of history and her predictions of the apocalypse fit into established traditions of prophetic writing, and, indeed, her tract entitled <span class="italic">The Everlasting Gospel</span> (1649) takes its name from the famous work attributed to Joachim of Fiore. Despite her attacks on the authority and corruption of the church, and her opposition to Arminianism, ritual, and ceremony, which she described as sinful idolatry, Davies's religious beliefs bear some affiliation to not only Anglicanism but also Catholicism. She often dated her tracts according to the liturgical calendar, and increasingly her writings dwelled on the importance of the Virgin Mary, not only as intercessor but also as a new redeemer. She had, for a time, some sympathy with the Calvinist doctrine of absolute predestination, but later in her life she developed a strong belief in the ultimate salvation of all humankind. Davies does not seem to have been part of any specific religious sect or movement, and she formulated her own interpretations of scripture and opinions on theological matters. None the less, her writings reveal that she was acquainted with the ideas of the Coleman Street preacher John Goodwin and of the Digger leader, Gerrard Winstanley. She was as preoccupied with matters of politics as with matters of religion, denouncing the reign of Charles I and declaring her support for the protectorate of Oliver Cromwell. In her poem &#145;To Sion most Belov'd I Sing&#146;, which was first printed in 1633 and republished at least four more times before her death, she likened Charles to the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> king Belshazzar, whose downfall was predicted in the writing on the wall. However, her opinions on social matters, and especially the importance of hierarchy and property, were far from revolutionary and may be understood as a reflection of her aristocratic status (she was preoccupied with her own exalted lineage). She certainly did not share Winstanley's beliefs concerning communal ownership and the abolition of wage labour.<br>
<br>Throughout her life, Davies seems to have made enemies easily. In 1622 Christopher Brooke likened her to Jonson's Lady Wouldbe, calling her an &#145;abominable stinking greate Symnell face excrement&#146;, and describing her &#145;scurvy contracted purse mouth&#146;, &#145;black patches of ugly deformitie&#146;, and &#145;hoodwynkt and clouded&#146; eyes  (TNA: PRO, SP 14/130/135). This description is contradicted by the much more flattering portrait miniature of a young woman, identified as Davies, painted by Sir Isaac Oliver. Although her father settled &pound;6000 on her at the time of her wedding, the civil war, Irish rising, and her disputes with authority all had an impact on her personal wealth. Davies was an extremely litigious woman, who battled to see her properties restored to her possession. She repeatedly claimed to be destitute and refused to pay what she owed, coming into conflict with Gerrard Winstanley in 1650 after employing the Diggers to work her land. Up to her final months, she continued to rely on her daughter for financial assistance. She died in London on 5 July 1652 and was buried next to her first husband in St Martin-in-the-Fields.<br>
<br>In total, Davies published almost seventy tracts. Although her works are extremely difficult to read, recent historians and critics have reassessed her life and achievements, arguing for her importance as one of the most prolific seventeenth-century prophets, and as one of the first English women to see her works through the press.<br>
