<span class="headword">Petre,  Robert Edward</span>, ninth Baron Petre  (1742&#150;1801), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic leader</span>, was born about February 1742 in London, the only son (he had three older sisters) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53220/', "Robert James Petre, eighth Baron Petre (1713&#150;1742)")</script>, of Ingatestone, Essex, a botanist and garden designer, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74981/', "Anna Maria Barbara Petre (1716&#150;1760)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64188/', "Petre family")</script>], daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22983/', "James Radcliffe, third earl of Derwentwater")</script>. He succeeded to his barony as a minor in July 1742 and may have been educated at the English Jesuit college at St Omer in France.<br>
<br>Petre was the principal representative of an enlightened, tolerant, rather tepid English Catholicism shared by the small but powerful grouping of &#145;old&#146; Catholic families. His wealth made him one of the principal paymasters of the English Catholic community, and in political circles he was generally seen as the leader of Catholic opinion. He was one of the central figures in the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/73617', "Catholic Committee")</script>, a self-appointed body formed in 1778, predominately lay in character and noble in membership, which saw itself as speaking for &#145;informed&#146; Catholic opinion (Petre always protected radicals among the clergy, such as Alexander Geddes), and which agitated for the freeing of the English Catholics from civil disabilities. It had considerable influence in negotiating the <span class="roman">Catholic Relief Acts</span> of 1778 and 1791 and in preparing a new oath of allegiance.<br>
<br>The visit of George III to Thorndon in October 1778 gave a royal seal of approval to Petre's efforts. Not all his co-religionists were so enthusiastic. Petre paid little attention either to the Irish dimension of Catholic relief or to the changing constituency of English Catholicism. The Cisalpine Club, formed in 1792 from the leading members of the Catholic Committee, looked very out of date by 1830 when its meetings finished. Ultramontanism was becoming more vigorous, and initiative among the English Catholics was moving away from the old Catholic families to the increasing Catholic population of towns. It was priests, not peers, who were now providing leadership in the church. Many of the disputes in which the English Catholics were involved during Petre's lifetime were about the place of lay power in an increasingly clericalized church or, as John Milner, bishop of Castabala, one of Petre's most bitter critics, put it, &#145;whether the nomination of our Pastors shall be with <i>Lord Petre</i> or <i>the successors of</i> <i>St Peter</i>&#146;  (Duffy, &#145;Doctor Douglass&#146;, 249).<br>
<br>Petre married twice. In 1762 he married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1787), younger daughter and coheir of Philip Howard of Buckenham, Norfolk. They had four sons, two of whom died in infancy, and one daughter. In 1788 he married Juliana Barbara (<i>d</i>. 1833), sister of Bernard Edward Howard, later twelfth duke of Norfolk, and daughter of Henry Howard of Glossop, Derbyshire. They had one son and two daughters.<br>
<br>Elected FSA and FRS in 1780, Petre was also a leading freemason and grand master of the English freemasons in 1772&#150;6 (the last Catholic to hold that office). James Paine designed his new residence at Thorndon Hall, Essex, and Lancelot (Capability) Brown laid out the grounds. Lord Petre died at his home in Park Lane, London, on 2 July 1801. He was succeeded in the barony by his eldest son, Robert Edward (<i>b</i>. 1763).<br>
