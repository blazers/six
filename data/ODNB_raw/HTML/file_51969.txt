<span class="headword">Buller, Dame  (Audrey Charlotte) Georgiana</span>  (1883&#150;1953), <span class="occ">worker for the disabled</span>, was born on 4 August 1883 at Downes, Crediton, Devon, the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32165/', "Sir Redvers Henry Buller (1839&#150;1908)")</script>, landowner and army officer, and his wife, Lady Audrey Jane Charlotte (1844&#150;1926), youngest daughter of the fourth Marquess Townshend and widow of the Hon. Greville Howard. She was considerably influenced by her father, who was highly respected locally both as a landowner and for his leadership in the army. During the South African War he was responsible for organizing the relief of Ladysmith, in 1900, and he was regarded as a hero both locally and nationwide. Georgiana was educated at home and at the Phonetic Institute, Bath, where she gained a Pitman's shorthand certificate in 1907. She was actively involved with charitable organizations, especially the Voluntary Aid Organization (British Red Cross Society), and by 1914 she was deputy county director for Devon. She was very keen on hunting but injured her spine in a fall. In early 1914 it was thought that war was likely, and the Voluntary Aid Organization was asked to prepare hospital accommodation in Exeter. Georgiana Buller was asked to supervise this; she ended her convalescence and set to work.<br>
<br>It was originally estimated that 160 beds would be needed, but by August 1915 more than 1400 beds were in use. The Red Cross Voluntary Aided Hospital in Exeter, which Buller organized, was taken over by the War Office in 1915 as the Central Military Hospital with Georgiana Buller as administrator, the only woman to hold such a post. She was also responsible for forty-four affiliated auxiliary hospitals. During the war more than 35,000 patients passed through the hospital, staying on average twenty-five days. Georgiana Buller and her voluntary staff worked very hard. She had extremely high standards, and some found her demands unreasonable. On being demobbed in 1920 she was exhausted and went into a physical and mental decline. She was awarded the Royal Red Star (first class) by the British Red Cross Society in 1920 and was made a DBE on 24 December 1920.<br>
<br>Dame Georgiana Buller was next informed by two medical friends of the great need in Devon for an orthopaedic hospital for children. When she began to plan ways of raising money she quickly realized how acute the need was, as she discovered that many children were suffering at home from orthopaedic conditions simply because there was no hospital nearby. In 1927 the Princess Elizabeth Orthopaedic Hospital was opened in Exeter. Dame Georgiana also worked with the Central Council for the Care of Cripples and was chairman of the Devon Association for Cripples Aid. She then became aware of another problem in relation to disability: the lack of training facilities for those permanently disabled. From 1935 onwards she concentrated her energies on establishing two training colleges, the St Loyes Training Centre for Cripples in Exeter, and Queen Elizabeth College in Leatherhead. Dame Georgiana's aim was for each person with disabilities to become independent through learning a marketable skill. She met with opposition when insisting that disabled people deserved training, but then enlisted the support of the minister of labour Ernest Bevin. Bevin had gone to school in Crediton and had often stolen apples from her father's orchards which were next to the village school.<br>
<br>Dame Georgiana also established the British Council for Rehabilitation and believed that the resources of the state and the voluntary spirit could be combined for the benefit of the disabled. Funds were always needed for the training centres and she harnessed volunteers to run events as diverse as a flower ball in the Savoy Hotel in November 1947 and a &#145;Play-time work&#146; exhibition in Exeter. Portland College, near Nottingham, was founded on the same lines as the St Loyes centre, as were other centres throughout Britain.<br>
<br>Dame Georgiana was chairman at St Loyes for many years. She supported the Girl Guides, the Boy Scouts, and the St John Ambulance Brigade. She was a JP for twenty years. In 1947 she initiated preparatory training for those facing long stays in hospital and who could enjoy academic work. On 11 March 1953 she was interviewed on the BBC radio programme <span class="italic">Woman's Hour</span> about her life and her work for the disabled. She died from carcinoma on 22 June 1953 at her home, Bellair House, Topsham Road, Exeter, and was buried on 26 June at Holy Cross Church, Crediton, Devon.<br>
