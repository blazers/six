<span class="headword">White,  James</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1824, <em>d.</em> 1884), <span class="occ">maker of scientific instruments</span>, was baptized on 23 November 1824 in the parish of Kildalton in Islay, Argyll, the son of William White and his wife, Margaret Adam. His father subsequently moved to Glasgow, where he traded as a yarn merchant. The young White was apprenticed about 1839 to Gardner &amp; Co., mathematical, optical, and philosophical instrument makers. He probably worked for the firm as a journeyman until he was about twenty-five, when he set up on his own with &pound;160, partly borrowed from friends, at 14 Renfield Street, Glasgow, in March 1850.<br>
<br>White received early encouragement from William Thomson, professor of natural philosophy at Glasgow University, for whose laboratory he supplied materials and experimental teaching apparatus from 1854 onwards. Sometimes Thomson's scientific curiosity made unusual demands of the instrument maker. One day in 1868 he hurried White to a hairdresser's shop near his workshop in Buchanan Street to see a rubber drive-belt which was used for a rotatory hairbrush. He requested White to get one put up in the classroom immediately, and used it to demonstrate to students and colleagues the principle of kinetic rigidity by forcing it into kinks by hitting it with a stick. White helped to equip Thomson's pioneering new laboratory at Gilmorehill in 1870, and was appointed optician and philosophical instrument maker to the university. Although the two men formed a close relationship as instrument maker and inventor, they were not business partners; only after White's death did Thomson become a partner in the firm.<br>
<br>White's earliest known partner was John Haddin Barr, with whom he traded as White and Barr from 1857 until the dissolution of their partnership in the autumn of 1859, apparently because of Barr's emigration to New Zealand. Within two years a deficit of over &pound;1600 forced White to petition for sequestration, in August 1861. He attributed his losses to &#145;various unprofitable contracts&#146; and a patent connected with an improved sextant. His business as revealed by the bankruptcy papers was a broadly based retailing operation, involving the purchase of instruments and other items from many of the leading British wholesalers and manufacturers. His stock, by then including photographic apparatus, was thus similar to that of other contemporary instrument firms. After satisfying his creditors by December 1861, he resumed business, and later entered into partnership with Robert McCracken, a dentist; this was dissolved in December 1876.<br>
<br>White's business first became distinguished because of his crucial part in the development of Thomson's pioneering electrical instruments, particularly electrometers and electrical balances, from 1854. Thomson designed, and in 1858 patented, the mirror galvanometer for the Atlantic telegraph project, crediting White with the innovative substitution of lightweight silvered microscope glass for the usual metal mirror. Thomson's attachment to White as a maker was later attributed to the galvanometer's success in enabling the first transatlantic telegraphic contact. The firm also manufactured considerable numbers of the siphon recorder, which followed the galvanometer in 1867, and of other electrical instruments stemming from Thomson's twenty-four patents relating to electrical circuits. White also made specially commissioned instruments such as the portable electrometers which were constructed to Thomson's design for the German scientist J. F. G. Dellman in 1862&#150;3, and those for Lieutenant Alfred Parr and Lieutenant William May's Arctic expedition to measure atmospheric electricity in 1875.<br>
<br>White was an elder of St Matthew's Free Church, Glasgow, and was elected a member of the Glasgow Philosophical Society in 1876. On 5 September 1877 he married Jane Reid, sister of David Hay Reid, muslin manufacturer. There were no surviving children. By 1885 electrical apparatus accounted for less than one third of his company's sales income, which mostly derived from the production of Thomson's patented compasses after 1876, and to a lesser extent from his other marine instruments, including sounding machines. As well as entrusting White with the sole manufacture of almost all his instruments, Thomson relied on his craftsmanship and patience during the demanding stages of design as they refined successive versions of an instrument, from what often began as a rough sketch. Thomson closely supervised production, latterly helped by one of the earliest telephone lines in Britain, which linked his classroom to the workshop. He held the instrument maker in high esteem; after he allowed his tide predictor to be made by L&eacute;g&eacute; in 1872&#150;3, he regretted he had not used White, with &#145;his genius to help&#146;  (Wilson, <span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 2.454). According to one of Thomson's pupils, while White was &#145;no doubt a most skilful mechanic, he had further a singular aptitude in grasping Thomson's ideas and giving them practical shape&#146;. In his lecture room Thomson &#145;often spoke of and praised the excellence and exactness of White's work&#146;  (Murray, 137).<br>
<br>Before an expansion into larger workshops in 1883 White had taken as partners his assistants Mathew Edwards and David Reid (unrelated to his wife). They continued the firm after White's death at 20 Hamilton Drive, Glasgow, on 15 August 1884. The death certificate described the cause as a &#145;softening of the brain&#146;, from which he had suffered since 1880. White left &pound;5244 to his widow as his share of a successful business. In describing him as Sir William Thomson's &#145;highly-skilled coadjutor&#146;, his obituarist  (<span class="italic">Engineering</span>) caught the essence of his talent and achievement as a scientific instrument maker.<br>
