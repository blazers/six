<span class="headword">Douglas,  George</span>, first earl of Angus  (1378<span class="mult">x</span>80?&#150;1403?), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the illegitimate son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7924/', "William Douglas, first earl of Douglas (c.1330&#150;1384)")</script>, and Earl William's sister-in-law, Margaret Stewart (<i>b</i>. 1353&times;62, <i>d</i>. in or before 1418), eldest daughter and heir of Thomas Stewart, earl of Angus, and wife of Thomas, earl of Mar, whose sister, also Margaret, was Douglas's wife. The liaison between George's parents presumably began after the death of Thomas, earl of Mar, early in 1377. Thomas died childless, and his estates and titles passed to his sister's husband, George's father, who was made earl of Mar in July 1377. Margaret Stewart became Earl William's mistress and by January 1379 was residing in Douglas's fortress of Tantallon in Haddingtonshire. The relationship produced a son, George. Despite George's illegitimacy, Margaret Stewart was determined to arrange his succession to the estates and title of his maternal grandfather, the earl of Angus. In 1388&#150;9 she was able to exploit a political struggle for control of the kingdom between two of Robert II's sons, John, earl of Carrick, and Robert, earl of Fife, to obtain royal ratification of George's right to inherit his grandfather's earldom and lordships. On 10 April 1389 Robert II confirmed Countess Margaret's resignation of the earldom of Angus and the lordships of Abernethy and Bunkle in favour of her son, who became first earl of Angus of a new creation in 1397.<br>
<br>Between 24 May and 9 November 1397 Angus married Mary Stewart, a daughter of Robert III. As part of the marriage settlement the earl's lands in Forfar and his lordships of Abernethy and Bunkle were elevated to the status of a regality. Under the terms of the marriage contract Robert III was obliged to confirm all resignations of land made in George's favour by his half-sister Isabella Douglas, countess of Mar, and his cousin Sir James Sandilands of Calder. This arrangement gave Angus claims to many of the lordships which had been the property of his father. After the latter's death his estates and title had passed to his legitimate son, James, who, however, was killed at the battle of Otterburn in August 1388. The title of earl of Douglas and possession of many of Earl William's estates had passed, by means of an entail drawn up in 1342, to Earl James's illegitimate kinsman Archibald Douglas, lord of Galloway, who became third earl of Douglas in April 1389. Robert III seems to have encouraged George Douglas's claims to the wider Douglas inheritance in 1397 in order to undermine Earl Archibald and his allies, who were associated with the king's brother and political rival, Robert, earl of Fife. The arrangement made in 1397 essentially gave Angus rights to all the lordships not covered by the 1342 entail, including Liddesdale, Cavers, and Jedworth; his attempts to recover control of Liddesdale led to a serious feud with an alternative Douglas claimant, Sir James Douglas of Dalkeith.<br>
<br>Angus was briefly active in Anglo-Scottish diplomacy, but on 14 September 1402 he was among the Scottish noblemen captured by English forces at the battle of Hamildon Hill. He is said to have died in England shortly after his capture during an outbreak of plague. When his son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7926/', "William Douglas")</script>, was served as heir to his father in Liddesdale on 27 March 1409, it was noted that the lordship had been in the crown's hands for six years, suggesting that George died early in 1403. His widow, Mary, had certainly married Sir James Kennedy of Dunure before 25 January 1406. Angus and his wife had two children, William, who succeeded as earl of Angus and was the first of the so-called Red Douglases, and Elizabeth, who married Sir Alexander Forbes before 4 November 1423 and, surviving him, Sir David Hay of Yester. Mary Stewart was to remarry three times in all. After Kennedy's death in 1408 she became the spouse of Sir William Graham of Montrose, who died in 1424. Finally, widowed yet again, she married Sir William Edmonstone of Duntreath in 1425. She seems to have died some time after 1458, and is said to have been buried in the parish church of Strathblane. All her marriages produced children.<br>
