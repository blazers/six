<span class="headword">Hoadly,  Benjamin</span>  (1706&#150;1757), <span class="occ">physician and playwright</span>, was born on 10 February 1706 in Broad Street, London, the elder surviving son of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13375/', "Revd Benjamin Hoadly (1676&#150;1761)")</script>, who became bishop of Winchester, and his first wife, Sarah Curtis (1676?&#150;1743) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13379/', "Hoadly, Sarah")</script>]. His father was musical, and his mother a trained portrait painter. He was educated at Dr Newcome's academy, Hackney, Middlesex, and from 1722 at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. He read humanities and mathematics, and attended the lectures of the blind professor Nicholas Saunderson. He graduated MB in 1727, and MD in April 1728, having been elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1726. He was made registrar of Hereford by his father, who was bishop there from 1721 to 1723.<br>
<br>Hoadly was married twice: first, on 6 November 1733 to Elizabeth, daughter of Henry Betts, of Suffolk; they had one son, Benjamin, who died young. On 4 June 1747 he married Ann, daughter of General Armstrong; they had no children.<br>
<br>Settling in London, Hoadly was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1736 (censor, 1739); in 1737 he delivered uninteresting Goulstonian lectures on respiration, and in 1742 a commonplace Harveian oration, all of which were published. He was physician to St George's Hospital (1736&#150;46); in 1736 he also became physician to the Westminster Hospital. In 1742 he became physician to the king's household, and in 1746 physician to the household of the prince of Wales.<br>
<br>Hoadly was fond of the stage, as was his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13377/', "John Hoadly")</script>, and wrote a popular comedy, <span class="italic">The Suspicious Husband</span>, which was first acted at Covent Garden on 12 February 1747 and often repeated. There were at least twenty-four different printings and editions between 1747 and 1829. It is a comedy of lovers, muddles, escapes, ladders, and bedrooms, with a happy ending. Garrick wrote both the prologue and the epilogue, and acted the part of Ranger. Johnson said that Ranger was &#145;just a rake, and a mere rake, and a lively young fellow, but no <i>character</i>&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, quoted in <span class="italic">Medical Bookman</span>, 25). The play was dedicated to George II, who sent Hoadly &pound;100. The plot and style were widely, though not universally, praised. Hoadly's father the bishop did not go. A satire by Charles Macklin, <span class="italic">The Suspicious Husband Criticized, or, The Plague of Envy</span>, was acted in March 1747, but was a failure and not printed.<br>
<br>Hoadly wrote another comedy, <span class="italic">The Tatlers</span>, which was acted at Covent Garden on 29 April 1797, but was never printed, and also published <span class="italic">Observations on a Series of Electrical Experiments</span> (1756) with Benjamin Wilson FRS. He died on 10 August 1757 at his house at Chelsea, which he had built ten years before.<br>
