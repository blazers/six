<span class="headword">Bodie,  Walford</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Samuel Murphy Bodie]</span>  (1869&#150;1939), <span class="occ">music-hall entertainer</span>, was born on 11 June 1869 at 33 George Street, Aberdeen, the son of William Bodie, journeyman baker, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Murphy. Educated at Robert Gordon College, Aberdeen, he joined the National Telephone Company as an electrician in the mid-1880s. He reputedly made his stage d&eacute;but demonstrating electricity in an amateur show at Stonehaven in 1886, but his subsequent early career is hard to document, not least because of the variously embroidered accounts he later offered. In 1897 he began work as assistant manager of a Norwich music-hall run by his brother-in-law, H. Werner Walford, before briefly managing a hall at Macclesfield. As Dr Walford Bodie (he may have obtained an American qualification of dubious provenance) he then founded the Royal Magnets Variety Company, quickly establishing a reputation in Scotland and the English provinces. He probably made his London d&eacute;but at the Britannia, Hoxton, in 1903 and for the next few years was one of the biggest attractions ever seen on the British variety stage.<br>
<br>Tall, with piercing eyes and a large, dramatically pointed moustache, Bodie had tremendous stage presence. His act contained a number of elements of greater or lesser importance at different stages of his career. A renowned ventriloquist, he was also a highly gifted hypnotist, specializing in the physical and mental manipulation of his assistants and popularizing the hypnosis and subsequent embarrassment of audience members. Yet another element involved the carrying out of electrical exhibitions and experiments, often involving the passage of supposedly lethal doses of electricity through his body and that of volunteers. An endlessly inventive self-publicist, happy to refer to himself in his posters as the Most Remarkable Man on the Earth, his stunts included hypnotizing animals in Dundee Zoo in 1904 and exhibiting the original electric chair in the 1920s.<br>
<br>Walford Bodie's box-office success, however, was ultimately built upon his reputation as a healer through the deployment of what he termed &#145;bloodless surgery&#146;. More than 76,000 people were reputed to have seen his shows during a three-week run at the Bristol People's Palace music-hall in 1904, at which he claimed to have cured some fifty patients &#145;discharged as hopeless and incurable cases from the Royal Infirmary and the general Hospital&#146;  (<span class="italic">Era</span>, 7 July 1904). Bloodless surgery involved an amalgam of hypnotism, muscular manipulation, faith-healing, and what he termed &#145;Bodie-force&#146;, the intuitive direction of electrical currents via his hands and feet to the relevant parts of the patient's body. Whatever its validity and for whatever reason, his treatment clearly benefited some individuals. Unsurprisingly, Bodie was a constant target for the medical profession. Medical students heckled his performances while senior practitioners attacked him in the press: even a visit to his home town in 1904 was thus marked. Bodie deliberately courted the publicity that ensued, teasingly dedicating his &#145;textbook&#146; <span class="italic">The Bodie Book</span> (1905) to British doctors &#145;in the hope that it may lead them to a fuller understanding of the finer forces of which it treats&#146;. However, in November 1909, during the course of a successful court action brought against Bodie by a former assistant, many of his stage secrets, including selective choice of patients and the exaggeration of their symptoms, were exposed. His next engagement at the Glasgow Coliseum was disrupted for several nights by medical students and finally closed by a virtual riot on 12 November. Further demonstrations and an attack on his business premises followed the next week in London. Although Bodie remained an attraction&#151;his company's dramatic escape from the torpedoed SS <i>Arabia</i> on return from an Indian tour in 1916 gave valuable publicity&#151;he concentrated far less on healing and found it increasingly difficult to obtain bookings in leading halls.<br>
<br>Bodie invested his not inconsiderable earnings in a number of business ventures, owning a hotel, shops, and houses in Macduff, Banffshire, by 1903. He also ran the Bodie Electric Drug Company in London, which produced &#145;electric liniment&#146; and &#145;electric life pills&#146;. He wrote a body of literature to support his act and created the fictional detective Harley the hypnotist, with a book-length treatment published in 1910 enjoying some commercial success. In 1890 he married the eldest daughter of David Henry, a road surveyor from Macduff. As Princess Rubie, illusionist and thought-reader, she worked with him until her retirement in 1930. Four of her sisters also had spells with his company, as did his sister Marie Walford, who appeared as Mystic Marie, the Electric-Magnetic Floating Lady. In 1903, the Bodies built the Manor House, Macduff, with Bodie happily playing the role of local laird and enjoying golf and masonic activity. They were badly affected by the early deaths of their daughter, Jeannie, who worked in the family show, and son Albert who had managed his father for a period. A third child, Samuel, survived both parents.<br>
<br>On 15 February 1932, a year after the death of his first wife, Bodie married Florence Joan (Florrie) Robertshaw (<i>b</i>. 1909/10), a 22-year-old, Leeds-born dancer who worked in his show as La Tesla. He was taken ill while performing at the Blackpool Olympia in October 1939 and died in Blackpool Victoria Hospital on 19 October, six days after an unsuccessful operation on a perforated ulcer. He was buried in Macduff five days later. His obituarist declared: &#145;Whatever he was, he was an exquisite showman&#146;  (<span class="italic">Aberdeen Evening Express</span>, 20 Oct 1939); Bodie personified the diversity of twentieth-century variety and skilfully exploited the tensions between popular belief and scientific&#150;medical knowledge.<br>
