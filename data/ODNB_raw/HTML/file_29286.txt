<span class="headword">Whitehead,  David</span>  (<em>c.</em>1492&#150;1571), <span class="occ">evangelical preacher</span>, is said by Anthony Wood to have been a native of Hampshire, where the Whiteheads had some landed property. The same source reports that he is also said to have been educated at Brasenose or All Souls, Oxford, and, though his name does not appear in the defective registers of the period, there is evidence to suggest that during the early years of Henry VIII's reign he spent some time in Oxford, where he may also have been an Augustinian friar. Sir Henry Billingsley, then a student and later a collaborator with Whitehead in literary ventures, is reported to have developed his taste for mathematics from studying with Whitehead at Oxford. Whatever the truth of this, it is clear that during Henry's reign Whitehead became increasingly associated with a group of scholars and clerics sympathetic to the gospel. He is said to have been a chaplain to Anne Boleyn; later he was tutor to the young Charles Brandon, second duke of Suffolk. As a member of the party of reform in London he was peripherally involved in the affair of Anne Askew. After Anne's arrest in March 1546 she was examined by Bishop Edmund Bonner, who offered to summon men she esteemed as learned and of good judgement: Edward Crome, David Whitehead, and John Huntingdon. After Anne's destruction on 16 July some sixty protestants fled the city, Whitehead among them.<br>
<br>With the accession of Edward VI, Whitehead's close association with the evangelical party was turned from a liability into an asset. With the death of Charles Brandon in 1551 he retained his place in the household as chaplain to the duchess of Suffolk, a staunch supporter of the regime. He was also marked out for special service by a protestant leadership increasingly admiring of his talents. In 1549 he was one of three divines (with Thomas Leaver and Roger Hutchinson) delegated by Cranmer to the difficult task of effecting the conversion of the protestant radical Joan Bocher. Bocher proved obstinate and was ultimately burnt, one of only two to suffer this fate during the reign. In November 1551 Whitehead was one of a number of protestant divines called to take part in a formal debate on the doctrine of transubstantiation at the house of William Cecil. His presence, alongside Robert Horne and Edmund Grindal, among the young reformers ranged against the conservative champions, John Feckenham, John Young, and Thomas Watson, is an indication of his place in the Edwardian inner circle. The following year Whitehead was first on a list of those whom Cranmer named in a letter to William Cecil as suitable for raising to the episcopal bench as archbishop of Armagh: &#145;I take Mr. Whitehead for his good knowledge, special honesty, fervent zeal and politic wisdom to be most meet&#146;  (Strype, 2.670). Whitehead shared the general reluctance to serve in Ireland and on this occasion refused the promotion; but the reign of Edward VI drew to a close with Whitehead on the verge of episcopal office, having been nominated to the see of Rochester.<br>
<br>Soon after Mary's accession Whitehead fled to the continent; he was one of 175 who sailed with John &agrave; Lasco from Gravesend on 17 September 1553. Whitehead was in the smaller vessel which reached Copenhagen on 3 November; the exiles were soon expelled by order of the king on refusing to subscribe to the Lutheran confession. They then made their way to Rostock, where Whitehead pleaded their cause before the magistrates, whose Lutheran requirements they failed to satisfy, and they were compelled to leave in January. A similar fate befell them at Wismar, L&uuml;beck, and Hamburg, but they found a refuge at Emden in March. Here a separate English congregation was established, but Whitehead seems quickly to have decided not to settle in the northern town. He was not named as one of the leaders of the congregation, as his seniority and closeness to John &agrave; Lasco would otherwise have made almost certain; and he was not among the thirty or more Englishmen who took up the invitation to enrol as citizens of Emden. Meanwhile an attempt was being made to found a church of English exiles at Frankfurt, and on 2 August 1554 an invitation was sent to Whitehead and other exiles to join the church there: &#145;on 24 October came Maister Whitehead to Franckford, and at the requeste of the congregation he took the charge for a time and preached uppon the epistle to the Romans&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of John Knox</span>, 4.12).<br>
<br>Whitehead was one of those who wished to retain the use of the English prayer book of 1552, and in the famous &#145;troubles&#146; at Frankfurt took the side of Richard Cox against John Knox. After the expulsion of Knox (26 March 1555) Whitehead was chosen pastor of the congregation. On 20 September he and his colleagues wrote a letter to Calvin to justify their proceedings against Knox, and repudiating the charge of too rigorous adherence to the prayer book and using &#145;lights and crosses&#146;; their ceremonies, they pleaded, were really very few, and they went on to attack Knox's &#145;Admonition&#146; as an &#145;outrageous pamphlet&#146; which had added &#145;much oil to the flame of persecution in England&#146;  (Robinson, <span class="italic">Original Letters</span>, 755 ff.). In February 1556 Whitehead resigned his pastorate, being succeeded on 1 March by Robert Horne; the cause is said to have been his disappointment at not being made lecturer in divinity in succession to Bartholomew Traheron. He remained, however, at Frankfurt, signing a letter to Heinrich Bullinger on 27 September 1557.<br>
<br>On Elizabeth's accession Whitehead returned to England, preaching before the queen on 15 February 1559, taking part in the disputation with the Roman Catholic bishops on 3 April, and serving as a visitor of Oxford University, and on the commission for revising the liturgy. As a senior figure among the returning exiles, a former nominated bishop, and, furthermore, one who had championed the prayer book abroad, Whitehead could have relied on nomination to one of the most senior posts in the new church, and indeed he figures on every one of the lists drawn up by William Cecil of possible bishops. There is a persistent tradition that he was offered first the most senior position of all, as archbishop of Canterbury, though given Matthew Parker's closeness to the queen this seems unlikely. Instead he was marked out at one point for Salisbury; on Cecil's first list of bishops, dated June or July 1559, Whitehead appears third behind only William Bill and Parker.<br>
<br>Cecil's plans, however, now ran into an unexpected obstacle: the refusal of many of the nominated bishops to take positions if their incomes were to be further ravaged by the depredations anticipated under action expected to follow the 1559 <span class="roman">Act of Exchanges</span>. Whitehead's objections were of a different order: he steadfastly refused all office, including the plum post of the mastership of the Savoy, preferring instead the life of the roving preacher. On 17 September 1561 he wrote to Cecil acknowledging his obligations to him, but lamenting the necessity he was under of refusing the living he offered. &#145;So that whether he had any spiritualities of note conferr'd on him is yet doubtful, he being much delighted in travelling to and fro to preach the word of God in those parts where he thought it was wanting&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 1.396). Whitehead's pursuit of personal purity was not widely admired among his fellow church leaders and after his death the puritan leader John Field would write of him &#145;as a man that would have all well first, and then he would labour that all should be well&#146;  (Collinson, 46). His friends among the foreign exiles, however, remained faithful. In August 1562 Whitehead was one of three English divines, along with fellow exiles Robert Crowley and Miles Coverdale, consulted by the Dutch church in London over the problems caused by Adriaan van Haemstede. He is reported by Whitgift to have frequently deplored the excesses of some ministers, but his own leanings were puritan, and on 24 March 1564 he was sequestered for refusing to subscribe. Francis Bacon, who calls Whitehead a &#145;grave divine &hellip; of a blunt stoical nature&#146;, and says he was &#145;much esteemed by Queen Elizabeth, but not preferred because he was against the government of bishops&#146;, also relates that the queen once said to him &#145;I like thee better because thou livest unmarried&#146;, to which Whitehead replied: &#145;In troth, madame, I like you the worse for the same cause&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Francis Bacon</span>, 7.163). Richard Hilles, however, in announcing Whitehead's death in June 1571, stated that &#145;he lived about seven years a widower &hellip; but very lately, before the middle of this year, he married a young widow when he was himself about eighty&#146;  (Robinson, <span class="italic">Zurich Letters</span>, 1.242). An engraved portrait by Crispijn de Passe is given in Henry Holland's <span class="italic">Her&#333;ologia</span> of 1620  (173).<br>
<br>Fuller mentions Whitehead's &#145;many books still extant&#146;  (Fuller, <span class="italic">Worthies</span>, 1.411), but with the exception of some discourses printed in Whittingham's <span class="italic">Brieff Discours of Troubles at Frankfort</span> (1575) they have not been traced either in print or in manuscript. In 1568 there appeared an edition of Peter Martyr Vermigli's <span class="italic">Most Learned and Fruitfull Commentaries upon the Epistle to the Romanes</span>, translated by H. Billingsley, which is described as having been &#145;perused&#146; by David Whitehead  (STC 24672). The ascription to Whitehead of the translation of George Ripley's <span class="italic">Medulla alchymiae</span> contained in Bodl. Oxf., MS Ashmole 1480/3, fols. 9&#150;15<i>v</i>, remains uncertain.<br>
