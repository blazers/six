<span class="headword">Stewart, Sir  William, of Monkton</span>  (<em>c.</em>1550&#150;1588), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26460/', "Andrew Stewart, second Lord Ochiltree (1521?&#150;1594?)")</script>, and his first wife, Agnes, daughter of John Cunningham of Caprington. Details of William's early life are scarce but it is likely that he was well educated, before serving as a mercenary in France and Sweden. He married Helen Cunningham, widow of John Stewart, burgess of Ayr, and they had at least two sons and one daughter. Throughout his life he was associated with the activities of his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26481/', "James Stewart of Bothwellmuir (from 1581 earl of Arran)")</script>, and by 1582 the pair were considered to have &#145;committed sundry odious murders&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1581&#150;3</i>, 172). For his share in such deeds William was later known as William the Sticker  (ibid., <i>1585&#150;6</i>, 245). In August 1582 William commanded his brother's troops during the Ruthven raid while the earl rode alone to Ruthven Castle to confront his political opponents. Surprised by a force headed by the earl of Mar, William Stewart's troops were routed and he lost two fingers in the skirmish.<br>
<br>The period of Arran's political ascendancy was inevitably that of William Stewart's greatest prominence. A possible candidate for the provostship of Edinburgh in September 1583, he was knighted on 18 March 1584. With Andrew Keith, Lord Dingwall, Sir William went on embassy to the Swedish court and on his return acted in the king's name in an attempt to capture Lord John Hamilton, later marquess of Hamilton. After the fall of Arran, Stewart was himself captured in 1586 by Hamilton and imprisoned in Edinburgh. On his release he continued to work as close liaison between his banished brother and prominent nobles at court, notably Francis Stewart, first earl of Bothwell. He was active, too, in manoeuvres against Hamilton and also against the vice-chancellor, John Maitland. It was in Bothwell's train that Sir William attended negotiations for an Anglo-Scottish peace at Berwick in July 1586. On 26 March 1587, following the execution of Queen Mary, Stewart was sent to treat for a renewal of Scotland's league with France. On his return he accused Patrick, master of Gray, of spying, subversion of religion, and having consented to Queen Mary's death. Stewart and Gray were committed to ward in Edinburgh Castle, and when Gray was convicted Stewart was freed. In May 1588 Sir William was commissioned to pursue the Catholic John, seventh Lord Maxwell, who had been conspiring with Spain, and after capturing him in a cave on 5 June, obtained the surrender of his castle of Lochmaben.<br>
<br>On 10 July 1588 Sir William had a heated argument with Bothwell, in the king's presence, in the course of which &#145;eache one gave the other the lee [lie], Sir William bade Bothwell kisse his arse. Bothwell vowed to kisse his arse where few sould be to red [intervene]&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of the Kirk</span>, 4.680). On 30 July, after James had left his capital, the protagonists came to blows in the high street of Edinburgh. Stewart stabbed one of Bothwell's followers, and was himself attacked by the earl. Having been wounded with a rapier he fled into a cellar in Blackfriar's Wynd, where he was put to death.<br>
