<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Duncan,  John</span>  (1866&#150;1945), <span class="occ">painter and illustrator</span>, was born in Dundee on 19 July 1866, the second of six children of William Gardiner Duncan, grocer (he was later described as a schoolmaster and a cattle dealer), and his wife, Helen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Thomson, a power loom weaver. At the age of eleven he began his studies at the Dundee School of Art, then based at Dundee high school; he left, aged fourteen, in 1880, when he began his artistic career as an illustrator and etcher, working mainly for local periodicals like <span class="italic">The Wizard of the North</span>. In the 1880s he often signed himself as John T. Duncan, and a group of etchings (Dundee Art Gallery) bearing this signature has been confirmed as his work. Their dominant themes of fairies, demons, and mythological characters show his strong predilection for the fantastic and romantic. They also reflect his prodigious talent as a draughtsman. In 1887 he left Dundee for a two-year stint in London doing book illustrations.<br>
<br>Becoming disillusioned with what he later described as &#145;hack work&#146;, and wishing to become a painter, Duncan went abroad in 1890 and studied for several months at Antwerp School of Art under Verlat, whose naturalism repulsed him. After a short period at D&uuml;sseldorf Art School he returned to Dundee to paint portraits. His extended trip to Italy later that year aroused an enthusiasm for Botticelli, Fra Angelico, Crivelli, and other artists of the fifteenth-century Renaissance movement. The influence of the Italian quattrocento remained paramount for the rest of his life; he loved the pure translucent colours of its frescoes, its refined decorative qualities, and above all its spirituality.<br>
<br>Duncan is best known as the leading artist in the Celtic revival movement. On his return from Italy in 1890 he met Patrick Geddes, who was at the hub of the Celtic revival activities in both literature and art in Edinburgh. Geddes had a major influence on Duncan's career, involving him in his projects, notably the four-week summer meetings and the Old Edinburgh School of Art, of which Duncan was appointed director from 1893 to 1897. In the same period Duncan painted murals depicting the evolution of pipe music in Geddes's home in Ramsay Gardens, Edinburgh, as well as a series of murals of scenes from Scottish history and Celtic mythology, notably <span class="italic">The Awakening of Cuchulain</span> for the common room of University Hall, a student residence. Duncan's most important collaboration with Geddes was in producing <span class="italic">The Evergreen: a Northern Seasonal</span>, four books of essays, poetry, and artworks: <span class="italic">Spring</span> and <span class="italic">Autumn</span> appeared in 1895, followed by <span class="italic">Summer</span> in 1896 and <span class="italic">Winter</span> in 1897. As well as contributing poems and full-page illustrations, such as the much admired <span class="italic">Anima celtica</span>, Duncan was the chief designer of the series. The books are adorned throughout with inspired headpieces and tailpieces &#145;after the manner of Celtic Ornament&#146;, which were created by John Duncan himself and his young female pupils. Their bold and innovative designs reflected the international style of the moment, art nouveau; but at the same time they owed much to Duncan's research into such ancient artworks as Pictish symbol stones and the <span class="roman">Book of Kells</span>.<br>
<br>In 1900, again through the influence of Geddes, Duncan was appointed to the post of assistant professor of fine art at the Chicago Institute, where he taught art to schoolchildren. On his return to Scotland in 1903 he settled permanently in Edinburgh. The next fifteen years saw the production of many of his most important works in the field of painting. One of his most ambitious works, <span class="italic">The Riders of the Sidhe</span> (1911; Dundee Art Gallery) shows how much he was influenced by the European symbolist movement. The work depicts the sidhe, fairy folk in Celtic myth who each year on midsummer night ride forth to the sacred circle to initiate mortals into their mysteries. The frame is inscribed &#145;The Riders of the Sidhe, Lords of Life, bearing as symbols the Tree of Experience, the Love-Cup, the Sword of Will, and the Stone of Quietness&#146;. His notebook of the period reveals that he agonized over the exact meanings of his chosen symbols, which finally boil down to four words: &#145;to know&#146;, &#145;to love&#146;, &#145;to do&#146;, and &#145;to endure&#146;. His brilliance as a decorator is evident in his masterpiece, <span class="italic">St Bride</span> (1913; National Gallery of Scotland), which combines intricate, minute detail and glowing colours within a composition with two large angels bursting out of the frame. He had an ability imaginatively to recreate convincing Celtic and medieval costumes, armour, and other trappings. Other major works of the period depicting Celtic myths and legends include <span class="italic">Tristan and Isolde</span> (1912; Edinburgh City Art Centre) and <span class="italic">The Children of Lir</span> (1914; Edinburgh City Art Centre). In 1910 he was elected an associate member of the Royal Scottish Academy.<br>
<br>On 27 April 1912, aged forty-five, Duncan married (Alice) Christine (<i>b</i>. 1885), daughter of Thomas Isaac Allen, railway superintendent; she was nineteen years his junior. They had two daughters, Bunty (<i>b</i>. 1913) and Vivian (<i>b</i>. 1915). His elder daughter recalled the effects on their home life of his experiments with tempera, using egg yolk, water, and mastic varnish: &#145;The house stank of tempera, made with the egg yolks only. We ate meringues for breakfast, lunch and dinner [to use up the egg whites]&#146;  (private information). He adored his daughters and was grief-stricken when the marriage failed in 1925, and Christine departed for South Africa with both girls.<br>
<br>In 1923 Duncan was made a full member of the Royal Scottish Academy, his diploma work being non-Celtic, <span class="italic">Ivory, Apes and Peacocks</span>. He was a popular teacher at Edinburgh College of Art from 1919 until 1922, and from 1925 until his death he was the academy's librarian. He was elected a member of the Royal Scottish Society of Painters in Watercolour in 1930.<br>
<br>For the last three decades of his life Duncan concentrated on producing commissioned altarpieces and other artworks for churches, a typical work being the five painted panels, <span class="italic">Christ Enthroned with Four Archangels</span> (1917), set within a carved oak reredos in St Mary's Episcopalian church, Broughty Ferry. About 1930, attracted by the pure colours and luminosity of stained glass, he taught himself the craft of glass-cutting&#151;with spectacular results. His greatest achievements in this field were the three-light <span class="italic">Creation</span> window in North Morningside church, Edinburgh (later the Eric Liddell Centre), and the <span class="italic">Coats Memorial Window</span> in Paisley Abbey. Graphic and modern-looking with blues, aquamarines, and purples set off with flashes of crimson, Duncan's stained glass windows are among the finest that Scotland has produced.<br>
<br>One of Duncan's best friends described him as &#145;a man apart, living in a world of his imagination&#146;  (Herries, 253). He joined the Edinburgh Theosophical Society in 1909 and remained a keen member; he was an erudite and thoughtful man, who saw visions and heard fairy music while he painted. During his summers in the Outer Hebrides he learned Gaelic and painted the turquoise beaches of Iona and Barra long before Samuel Peploe and Francis Cadell discovered them&#151;at his instigation. He was popular and amusing, his Thursday afternoons &#145;at home&#146; in his studio attracting art students, literati, and visitors who enjoyed intellectual discussions.<br>
<br>In 1941, near the end of his life, Duncan was awarded the then unprecedented honour for a living artist of a major retrospective exhibition of over 100 works in the National Gallery of Scotland. He died of a cerebral thrombosis at his home, 29 St Bernard's Crescent, Edinburgh, on 23 November 1945. His trustees thereafter donated many of the larger paintings left in his studio to the principal Scottish museums.<br>
<br>In 1910 Duncan wrote in his notebook, &#145;Desiderata: Decorative Arrangement / Large scale of figures / Breadth of effect / Perfection of finish&#146;  (notebook 3, NL Scot., acc. 6866). Overall his style is outside the mainstream of Scottish art, his pictures being usually two-dimensional and static, rather like medieval tapestries. Illustrations in the best sense, they are concerned with ideas and content rather than realism, his consummate skill as draughtsman and decorator producing exquisite recreations of ancient Celtic legends.<br>
