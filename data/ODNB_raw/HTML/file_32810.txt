<span class="headword">Dibdin, Sir  Lewis Tonna</span>  (1852&#150;1938), <span class="occ">ecclesiastical lawyer and administrator</span>, was born in Bloomsbury, London, on 19 July 1852, the third son of the Revd Robert William Dibdin and his wife, Caroline, only child of William Thompson, barrister, of the Temple. He was grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7586/', "Charles Isaac Mungo Dibdin")</script> of Sadler's Wells Theatre, and great-grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7585/', "Charles Dibdin")</script>, the dramatist and songwriter. His uncles included the musician Henry Edward Dibdin and Lewis Hippolytus Joseph Tonna, author of ultra-protestant religious works. Dibdin's father enjoyed considerable popularity for many years as a preacher at West Street Chapel, Seven Dials, which, as La Tremblade, had been one of the earliest Huguenot churches in London and was later a regular preaching place of John Wesley.<br>
<br>Dibdin was educated at home before going in 1869 to St John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated as a senior optime in the mathematical tripos of 1874 and was awarded an MA in 1878. He was called to the bar by Lincoln's Inn in 1876. In 1881 he married Marianne Aubrey (<i>d</i>. 1927), eldest daughter of Humphrey Senhouse Pinder, rector of Bratton Fleming, Devon; they had five sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>From 1895 to 1901 Dibdin was official counsel to the attorney-general in charity matters. His main interest, however, had from an early date been ecclesiastical law and history, and he was appointed chancellor of the dioceses of Rochester (1886), Exeter (1888), and Durham (1891). In 1899 he was engaged in the Lambeth hearings on the use of incense and the reservation of the sacrament. He took silk in 1901. Next year he appeared for the crown in the proceedings arising out of the appointment of Charles Gore to the see of Worcester; his services had been sought by all four other parties. From 1903 to 1934 he was dean of the arches, master of the faculties, and official principal of the chancery court of York, and from 1925 to 1934 he was vicar-general of the province of Canterbury.<br>
<br>In 1907 the <span class="roman">Deceased Wife's Sister's Marriage Act</span> was passed; next year Dibdin had to decide its effect in the memorable litigation known as the &#145;deceased wife's sister&#146; case, which, in its various phases, lasted from 1908 to 1912. His judgment was upheld in the divisional court, the Court of Appeal, and the House of Lords, and the principle was settled that the <span class="roman">Deceased Wife's Sister's Marriage Act</span> of 1907 validates for all purposes a marriage between a man and his deceased wife's sister, wherever and whenever contracted. In view of his evangelical upbringing, several of his decisions in the court of arches came as a welcome surprise to the Anglo-Catholic party and strengthened its position.<br>
<br>Dibdin's main occupation, however, from his appointment as first church estates commissioner in 1905 until his resignation in 1930 was the direction of the business of the ecclesiastical commission. During that time he bore the chief responsibility for its policy and, with Lord Phillimore, for initiating the many schemes for the benefit of the clergy which eventually took statutory shape in the clergy and episcopal pension measures of 1926. To him, too, are largely attributable the numerous measures relating to the Ecclesiastical Commission and to patronage and episcopal endowments. He combined his office of commissioner with that of an active governor and chairman of committees of Queen Anne's Bounty, thus eliminating much of the overlapping of functions and the competition which had formerly existed.<br>
<br>Dibdin had taken a prominent part in the deliberations of the house of laymen of the convocation of Canterbury almost from the formation of the house in 1886 and he was for a time its vice-chairman. Immediately on the establishment of the church assembly in 1920 he took a very active share in its work, both in his personal capacity and as the spokesman of the ecclesiastical commissioners, and he was largely responsible for a great many of its measures. There is probably no one to whom the assembly was more heavily indebted for its procedure and for the spirit in which its business was conducted.<br>
<br>Dibdin served on many royal and other commissions and committees on church affairs. The report of the royal commission on ecclesiastical discipline (1904&#150;6) was mainly his work. As a signatory of the minority report of the royal commission on divorce (1909&#150;12) he, together with the archbishop of York (Cosmo Lang) and Sir William Anson, recommended no alteration in the existing law other than equality of treatment for the sexes. In 1914 he presided over the archbishops' ancient monuments (churches) committee, which led to the formation of the diocesan advisory committees. The historical section of the report of the archbishops' committee on church and state was prepared by Dibdin and A. L. Smith, master of Balliol College, Oxford, and published in 1916; on this report were based the constitution of the church assembly and the proposals which received statutory form in the <span class="roman">Church of England (Assembly) Powers Act</span>, commonly called the <span class="roman">Enabling Act</span>, of 1919. Between 1923 and 1926 he served on the ecclesiastical courts commission. In 1934 illness compelled his resignation from the commission on the relations between church and state, appointed in 1930 after the rejection by the House of Commons of the 1928 prayer book. At the same time he resigned all his offices, legal and administrative.<br>
<br>Dibdin was knighted in 1903; in 1891 he received the honorary degree of DCL from Durham University; he was elected a bencher of Lincoln's Inn in 1908 and an honorary fellow of St John's College, Cambridge, in 1923. Other honours were offered him and were refused. He died at his home, Nobles, Dormansland, Surrey, on 12 June 1938. His eldest son, Lewis George Dibdin, became secretary of the church assembly in 1939.<br>
<br>Dibdin combined in a rare degree the qualities of lawyer, judge, and administrator, and this, together with his great experience, gave him a unique position for a layman in church affairs. Archbishop Benson relied greatly upon him and Dibdin advised Archbishop Davidson almost daily on many topics. He wrote or edited a number of legal and other works including <span class="italic">The Livery Companies of London</span> (1886), <span class="italic">Monasticism in England</span> (1890), and <span class="italic">The Ecclesiastical Commission</span> (1919). His <span class="italic">Establishment in England</span> (1932), a collection of essays written over a period of fifty years, emphasizes his strong support of the established church.<br>
