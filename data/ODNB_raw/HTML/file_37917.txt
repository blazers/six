<span class="headword">Roth,  Cecil</span>  (1899&#150;1970), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born on 5 March 1899 in Dalston, London, the youngest of the four sons of Joseph Roth, manufacturer of builders' supplies, and his wife, Etty, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jacobs; his third brother, Leon, became a philosopher of distinction. Educated at the City of London School, he saw active service in France in 1918 and then read history at Merton College, Oxford, obtaining a first class in modern history in 1922, and a DPhil in 1924; his thesis was published in 1925 as <span class="italic">The Last Florentine Republic</span>. In 1928 he married Irene Rosalind, daughter of David Davis, property developer. They had no children.<br>
<br>Roth soon turned to Jewish studies, his interest from childhood, when he had a traditional religious education and learned Hebrew from the Cairo genizah scholar Jacob Mann. Roth supported himself by freelance writing until in 1939 he received a specially created readership in post-biblical Jewish studies at the University of Oxford, where he was also mentor and host to Jewish students. After retiring from Oxford in 1964, he settled in Israel and divided his last years between New York, where he was visiting professor at Queens' College in City University and Stern College, and Jerusalem.<br>
<br>Roth's output was immense: bibliographies in his Festschrift, <span class="italic">Remember the Days</span> (1966), and in <span class="italic">Transactions of the Jewish Historical Society</span>, 25 (1977), list 779 items by him, including translations of his works. Some were, of course, ephemeral, including books and articles written in the 1930s when he lived by his pen. But he wrote the definitive <span class="italic">History of the Jews in England</span> (1941) and <span class="italic">History of the Jews in Italy</span> (1946), <span class="italic">The History of the Marranos</span> (1932) and <span class="italic">The Jews in the Renaissance</span> (1959), and comprehensive, popular works such as <span class="italic">The Short History of the Jewish People</span> (1936) and <span class="italic">The Jewish Contribution to Civilization</span> (1938). His style was vivid, and he had a penchant for colourful, even shady, characters, and a zest for historical detection. He produced works of precise scholarship, especially bibliographical works and studies of painting, and he applied his historical skills to the Dead Sea scrolls, identifying the Qumran sect with the Zealots against the more commonly proposed Essene identification that is now generally accepted (1958, 1965). His approach to economics and sociology tended to concentrate on personalities or small groups, rather than broader analysis, and he took but a limited interest in the philosophical aspects of history.<br>
<br>Roth was always interested in art, and especially in Jewish incorporation or adaptation of the motifs of Western art forms in Jewish ceremonial contexts. He made a scientific study of illuminated medieval <span class="roman">Haggadot</span> (service books for the home on Passover eve); he also collaborated with the Polish artist Artur Szyk in the most sumptuous of modern printed editions of the <span class="roman">Haggadah</span> (1940). He was an avid collector, particularly of illuminated <i>ketubbot</i> (marriage contracts), silver ritual objects, rare printed books, and manuscripts. These collections, which formed the setting of his home in Oxford, are now in the university library at Leeds (books and manuscripts) and in a museum attached to the Beth Tzedec Synagogue, Toronto (art collection). Both reflect his abiding interest in Italy and its Jewish communities, among which, until the massacres attendant upon the Second World War, he was a familiar figure.<br>
<br>Roth's crowning achievement was the editorship of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Judaica</span>, which he held from 1965. The sixteen volumes of this appeared in the year of his death. He planned the allocation of space, edited contributions, and wrote much himself, displaying powers of leadership, administration, and editorial conciliation. Roth's influence was less as a teacher, there having been during his lifetime much less scope than later for Jewish studies in Britain, than as a writer and lecturer. He was much in demand for lecture tours in Europe, America, and Africa. With hair parted in the middle, he retained the appearance of a youthful student almost to the end.<br>
<br>The academic world in his youth was hardly prepared to acknowledge the presence of a specifically Jewish factor in European economic and political history. The fact that it was later more generally recognized is in part due to the attention which Roth's scholarly and semi-popular writings attracted; and that his findings have not always survived the scrutiny of able younger scholars itself attests to his own success in helping to put Jewish history on the academic map. Most of his contemporaries in Oxford and elsewhere assumed that the only appropriate approach to Jewish studies was through Semitic philology and biblical studies, and Roth never received in Britain the academic recognition that his publications and his international standing (especially in America and Israel) merited. A contributory factor, perhaps, was his concealment of a warm and generous nature behind a self-assertive manner. In 1969 the Italian government made him commander of the order of merit for services to Italian culture. Roth died in Jerusalem (where his home was 21 Balfour Street) on 21 June 1970; he was survived by his wife.<br>
