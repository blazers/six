<span class="headword">Pirie,  William Robinson</span>  (1804&#150;1885), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and university principal</span>, was born at the manse of Slains, Aberdeenshire, on 26 July 1804, the second son of George Pirie DD (1761&#150;1826) and his wife, Mary Forbes (<i>d</i>. 1835). He studied at King's College, Aberdeen, from 1817 to 1821 without graduating and, after briefly entertaining a career in law, proceeded to the study of divinity. Licensed by the presbytery of Ellon in November 1825, he was ordained to the parish of Dyce, Aberdeenshire, in April 1830. On 24 March 1842 Pirie married Margaret Chalmers (1821&#150;1900), daughter of Dr Lewis William Forbes, minister of Boharm, Banffshire. The couple had five daughters and five sons the eldest of whom, George William, later became professor of mathematics at Aberdeen University.<br>
<br>Pirie espoused the views of the moderate faction in church politics; the Disruption of 1843 opened the way for him to become professor of divinity at Marischal College, Aberdeen. He received the degree of DD from both Marischal and King's College in 1844. In September 1846 he was briefly minister of Greyfriars parish in Aberdeen, but he demitted the charge a year later due to opposition to pluralities. On the fusion of the colleges in 1860, Pirie became the professor of church history in Aberdeen University, though he was considered to teach &#145;with a maximum of philosophical theory and a minimum of historical fact&#146;  (Anderson, 172). In 1877 he became principal of the university, a post he retained until his death.<br>
<br>Pirie achieved prominence in the Church of Scotland, as convener of the business committee of the general assembly and as moderator in 1864. He managed to keep the church from the threat of further disruption over the issue of innovations in worship and finally achieved the abolition of lay patronage in 1874, although in the short run this did nothing to improve relations with the Free Church of Scotland. He remained a dominant figure in the assembly until shortly before his death.<br>
<br>In his speech Pirie exhibited his Aberdeenshire origins, and his debating skills were enhanced by a sharp sense of humour. One commentator recalled &#145;his short but compact figure, his erect and vigorous gait, his bold strong features surmounted by a heavy crown of tangled hair, his easy, confident manner, and his almost ostentatious carelessness of dress&#146;  (Anderson, 170). Pirie was the author of several substantial works, but it was his moderatorial address that proved to be his most influential publication. He died at Old Aberdeen on 3 November 1885 and was buried there in Nellfield cemetery on 7 November.<br>
