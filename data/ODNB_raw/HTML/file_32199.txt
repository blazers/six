<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Burrows,  Montagu</span>  (1819&#150;1905), <span class="occ">historian and university administrator</span>, born at Hadley, Middlesex, on 27 October 1819, was the third son of Lieutenant-General Montagu Burrows (1775&#150;1848) and his wife, Mary Anne Pafford, eldest daughter of Joseph Larcom, captain RN, and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16067/', "Sir Thomas Aiskew Larcom")</script>. After attending Kingsmills' Boys' School, Southampton, Burrows entered the Royal Naval College, Portsmouth, as a cadet in August 1832. Two years later, in October 1834, at the age of fifteen, he joined the <i>Andromache</i> as a midshipman, and in 1842 he passed through the college as a mate. During his period of active service (1834&#150;46) he was decorated for his part in the bombardment of Acre, in November 1840, which brought Mehmet Ali, the rebellious pasha of Egypt, to terms, and he served under Henry Ducie Chads in suppressing piracy in the Straits Settlements and slave-trading on the west coast of Africa.<br>
<br>In November 1846 Burrows was appointed gunnery lieutenant on the training ship <i>Excellent</i>, and, in 1852, he became commander. Immediately on his promotion he decided to study at Oxford. On 13 September 1849, he had married Mary Anna, third daughter of Sir James Whalley Smythe Gardiner, third baronet, of Roche Court, Fareham, and he therefore entered Magdalen Hall, one of the few societies that admitted married men at that time, in 1853. In Michaelmas term 1856 he was placed in the first class of <i>literae humaniores</i>, and after little more than four months' further reading and extensive private tuition took a first class in the newly created honour school of law and modern history (Easter term 1857). After graduating Burrows engaged with much success in private teaching, mainly in law and modern history. In 1860 he published <span class="italic">Pass and Class</span>, a useful handbook to all the Oxford schools (3rd edn, 1866). In 1862 he became a retired post captain, and gave up the navy, believing that his short-sightedness and slight deafness would have interfered seriously with his effectiveness as a ship's captain.<br>
<br>At Oxford, Burrows was always active in both church and political affairs. A devout, though moderate, churchman, he was a member of the English Church Union, acting as chairman of the Oxford branch until 1866. He was secretary to the Oxford branch of the Universities' Mission to Central Africa on its foundation in 1859, and acted as joint secretary of the church congress, which held its second meeting at Oxford in 1862. During the same year he materially assisted in the building of the church of Sts Philip and James in north Oxford. Later he actively fought the cause of church denominational schools in Oxford, was for many years president of the Church Schools Managers and Teachers Association, and had much to do with the establishment of the Oxford diocesan conference. He was a member of the committee that founded Keble College in 1870. He wrote regularly for <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, and founded two short-lived papers, the <span class="italic">Church and State Review</span> (1861) and <span class="italic">The Churchman</span> (1866), which he hoped would form a firmer platform for his views. Burrows's political affiliation was once described as &#145;militant conservative&#146;. He was a perennially active campaigner for the tory cause in Oxford.<br>
<br>In 1862 Burrows was elected to the Chichele professorship of modern history, which had been founded by the royal commission of 1852. His election was a surprise to himself and others. Stubbs, Freeman, and A. J. Froude, all established historians, were among the candidates. But his candidature was warmly supported by Samuel Wilberforce, bishop of Oxford, and apparently by Gladstone, who was still burgess for the University of Oxford. The school of law and modern history, founded on 23 April 1850, was relatively new and still not firmly established. None of the other more formidable candidates had had any experience of teaching, and in the developing academic context Burrows's reputation as a teacher and as the author of <span class="italic">Pass and Class</span> carried weight. In his new role, he was effective in helping to develop a pragmatic reassessment of the role of history in higher education, and the basis upon which it should be taught and studied. In his inaugural lecture on 30 October 1862, he argued that the Oxford practice of studying history in the manner of Greats, through commentary on set texts, was rendered anachronistic by the great explosion of historical research. He suggested that the real value of studying history lay not in &#145;mere acquaintance with a multitude of facts&#146;, but in comparing, contrasting, and weighing evidence, which developed a critical habit of mind. Burrows's views were instrumental in generating support for the examination statute of 1864, which enabled students in Oxford to read for the final school of law and modern history directly after moderations without first having to read for the final school of <i>literae humaniores</i>, and also for the hebdomadal council revisions of 1869, which separated law from modern history. By 1900 the school of modern history, of which Burrows was chairman between 1889 and 1893, was the largest of the Oxford schools.<br>
<br>Elected a fellow of All Souls in 1870, Burrows wrote and edited fifteen books, published six sets of his lectures, and contributed to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>. His published work falls into four main classes: first, general history, arising from his teaching and written predominantly for an undergraduate audience (<span class="italic">History of the Foreign Policy of Great Britain</span>, 1895); second, naval history (<span class="italic">Cinque Ports</span>, 1888); third, antiquarian studies (<span class="italic">The Worthies of All Souls</span>, 1874); and fourth, ecclesiastical polemic (<span class="italic">Parliament and the Church of England</span>, 1875). Although never regarded as an outstanding historian, Burrows did study original sources, and was created <i>officier de l'instruction publique</i> by the French government for his work on the Gascon rolls. Burrows served on the Oxford extension committee which led to the foundation of the society of non-collegiate students in 1868. Owing to increasing deafness, he transferred his professorial work to a deputy in the summer of 1900. He remained active in university, college, and city affairs until his death on 10 July 1905 at his home, 9 Norham Gardens, Oxford. His wife died soon after, on 3 June 1906. Of their six children, three sons survived their father: the eldest, Edward Henry Burrows (<i>b</i>. 1851), was inspector of schools until his death in 1910.<br>
