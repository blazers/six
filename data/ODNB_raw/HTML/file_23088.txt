<span class="headword">Ramsay,  James Andrew Broun</span>, first marquess of Dalhousie  (1812&#150;1860), <span class="occ">governor-general of India</span>, was born at Dalhousie Castle, Bonnyrigg, Midlothian, on 22 April 1812, the youngest of three sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54609/', "George Ramsay, ninth earl of Dalhousie (1770&#150;1838)")</script>, soldier, and colonial governor, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57840/', "Christian Ramsay (1786&#150;1839)")</script>, only daughter and heiress of Charles Broun of Colstoun in East Lothian.<h2>
<a name="Educationpoliticsandmarriage"></a>Education, politics, and marriage</h2>James accompanied his parents to Canada in 1816 but returned home in 1822 and entered Harrow School in 1825. In 1829 he went to Christ Church, Oxford, where his career was not outstanding. Gladstone, Canning, and Elgin were among his contemporaries. He showed some signs of youthful intolerance&#151;his diary notes, &#145;We certainly are immensely cocky but then, hang it, we have reason&#146;  (K. Fieling, <span class="italic">In Christ Church Hall</span>, 1960, 164)&#151;but was also prone to self-examination and the desire to do better. When he came of age he resolved &#145;to act solely by a consideration of what will most conduce to the interests and happiness of my countrymen &hellip; In my private life &hellip; I will hope and pray that I ever shall be all that an honest and good man could wish to see me&#146;  (Warner, 1.24). The death of his elder brother, Lord Ramsay, in 1832 (the second brother had died some years before) prevented him from obtaining honours although he was awarded an honorary fourth (then regarded as equivalent to a second class) at his examination a year later.<br>
<br>Ramsay's political views evolved along Conservative lines; in 1831 he was unhappy about the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> and the clamour of its partisans. At the 1835 general election as Lord Ramsay he stood as a tory candidate for Edinburgh with &#145;no wish to perpetuate abuses or to preserve blots&#146;  (Warner, 1.34). He was defeated, but his good humour, determination, and the spirit in which he accepted defeat were remembered, and the election served to introduce him to public life. He subsequently became a JP for Haddington, joined several political and philanthropic committees, and resisted calls to come forward for an English seat, preferring to remain in Scotland. On 21 January 1836 he married Lady Susan Georgiana Hay (1817&#150;1853), eldest daughter of the marquess of Tweeddale, a family friend. It was a love match and Ramsay came to depend much on his wife's support; her premature death at thirty-five overshadowed the remainder of his life. Their first child, Susan Georgiana, was born in 1837 and a second daughter, Edith Christian, in 1839.<br>
<br>In 1837 Ramsay was elected MP for East Lothian, but his father's death the following year called him to the Lords as the tenth earl of Dalhousie. It seems he saw little chance of early advancement in the upper house (where he joined the group of Peelite tory peers) and so devoted his energies to specifically Scottish issues. In 1839 he became a member of the general assembly of the Church of Scotland, representing the presbytery of Dalkeith, in which lay his own parish of Cockpen. He took an active part in the assembly at a time when the great questions which resulted in the Disruption four years later were already stirring. Dalhousie was in favour of church reform but later resigned his seat in disagreement that the assembly should persist with a measure against a ruling of the court of session confirmed by the House of Lords.<h2>
<a name="PresidentoftheBoardofTrade"></a>President of the Board of Trade</h2>Dalhousie soon attracted the notice of the duke of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel, who, after the fall of Melbourne in 1841, became Conservative prime minister. Dalhousie declined an appointment to the queen's household (although his wife briefly served as a lady of the bedchamber) and was considered for the governorships of Madras and Bombay. In 1843 his chance came with the offer of the post of vice-president of the Board of Trade when Gladstone became president.<br>
<br>Dalhousie took up office with a vigour that would become characteristic of his tenure in India; he was usually first and last at his desk each day, often working into the early hours. His appointment was soon followed by the onset of the &#145;railway mania&#146; which confronted the board with a huge workload. Gladstone gave Dalhousie a free hand, allowing him an insight into railway business of great value later when he dealt with schemes in India. In 1845 he succeeded Gladstone as president, and eventually joined the cabinet. If Dalhousie had had his way, he would have subjected the construction and management of railway schemes to the co-ordinating control of government. He failed, however, to win Peel's support and devised instead a mechanism for the close scrutiny of each new scheme before sanction was given.<br>
<br>Dalhousie, when president, also had to deal with a wide range of other issues including banking, the coal trade, land matters, and sugar duties. His abilities and capacity for work were recognized not only by his own party but also by the opposition. After Peel's fall in 1846 Lord John Russell tried and failed to secure Dalhousie for the whig cabinet.<h2>
<a name="GovernorgeneralofIndia"></a>Governor-general of India</h2>In the following year, however, Dalhousie accepted Russell's offer of the governor-generalship of India in succession to Viscount Hardinge, on the understanding that it would not compromise his political loyalties. A factor in his decision was the insecure financial position he inherited (a debt by now of &pound;48,000): the governor-general commanded a substantial salary. He sailed for India in November 1847 and was sworn as governor-general in Calcutta on 12 January 1848. At thirty-five he was the youngest man to have held the appointment; small and short but well made in stature, with dark brown hair and a rich resonant voice, he had a quiet dignity coupled with a nervous force backed by obvious strength of mind and character.<br>
<br>Dalhousie faced problems of consolidating East India Company rule without jeopardizing its essential dynamism. His policy came to have two closely interwoven strands: economic and administrative &#145;modernization&#146;, and strategic territorial expansion within India's &#145;natural frontiers&#146;. The two strands were linked by the immediate and practical need to strengthen the company's hold on India and to create a state capable of providing the resources both for its own occupation and for the underpinning of British economic and military power throughout the East. The problems were not new (the concerns of his predecessors such as Bentinck and Ellenborough show this), but Dalhousie's combination of political and administrative skills, energy, and sheer determination to become thoroughly acquainted with the Indian system of government and administration and its condition and resources was. The consistent pursuit of this dual policy has given Dalhousie the credit for laying the foundations of modern India through modernization and consolidation but also the blame for the most serious crisis of the whole period of British control&#151;the uprising of 1857.<h2>
<a name="DalhousiesstyleofgovernmentinIndia"></a>Dalhousie's style of government in India</h2>From the outset Dalhousie established a rigorous official routine in Calcutta. He rose at about 6 a.m., read a <span class="roman">Bible</span> chapter, and then devoted himself to office boxes until breakfast over the Indian newspapers at 8 a.m. At 9.30 a.m. he went to his desk and usually stayed there until 5.30 p.m., consuming lunch while at work. While away from Calcutta on tour he worked equally hard to keep up with the necessary business. As at the Board of Trade, he put immense effort into mastering the details of questions with which he had to deal and used this as a means of enforcing considerable personal authority throughout the entire Indian government. For example, only sixteen days after taking up his duties he refused to continue established practice of autographing blank dispatches for the government secretaries to draft over, so that in future &#145;I may see what I am signing&#146;  (Dalhousie MSS). His arduous days meant he preferred quiet evenings with his wife rounded off with another <span class="roman">Bible</span> chapter before bed; he much disliked the official functions, many of them after normal working hours, that were inseparable from his official position.<br>
<br>Dalhousie considered the governor-general &#145;the beginning, middle and end of all&#146;, and his style made it the more so; he confided to his diary in 1854 on the departure of Sir Henry Elliot, &#145;I have myself done the chief part of the work in his, as in every other, department of Govt.&#146; Dalhousie's almost obsessive attention to detail shows he saw this as the only safe way to get things done and his frustrations were revealed in another document of 1854 when he advised, &#145;if you want anything done which <i>must</i> be done, follow my plan viz Order it to be done, see that it is done and <i>circulate</i> the papers afterwards&#146;  (Dalhousie MSS).<br>
<br>Despite his forceful style it is equally clear, however, that Dalhousie accepted advice, did not generally allow personal considerations to influence his judgement (although he was involved in some acrimonious wrangles with other key figures, such as the commander-in-chief Sir Charles Napier, when this resolve was tested to the full), was prepared to forgive mistakes, and was keen to give credit to subordinates where credit was due. Overall, Dalhousie's example and efforts improved the conduct of the company's administration. Canning, his successor (1856&#150;62), observed that &#145;Dalhousie, though he did more than was necessary in some matters, made business shorter and smoother&#146;  (M. Maclagan, <span class="italic">Clemency Canning</span>, 1962, 47). Dalhousie's thoroughgoing administrative background was important in his selection as governor-general and, arriving after the defeat of the Sikhs, he seemed destined to undertake the final pacification of India. In April 1848, however, two events occurred that would mould the course of Dalhousie's incumbency: the death of the raja of Satara, which raised the question of the &#145;lapse&#146; of princely states to the direct rule of the East India Company, and the outbreak of revolt in Multan, which initiated a train of events leading to the annexation of the Punjab, the last of the major native powers within the &#145;natural frontiers&#146;.<h2>
<a name="ThelapseofSatara"></a>The lapse of Satara</h2>Dalhousie has been credited with invention of the doctrine of lapse, which featured so strongly in the territorial expansion of his years in India. The doctrine was, in fact, first promulgated in 1834 and formalized in 1841, and Dalhousie was not alone in India or in London in wishing to use it to give both order and legitimacy to the &#145;falling-in&#146; of princely states. In this way the company's rule could be extended gradually and methodically, with each case being carefully considered on its merits and its contribution to company resources, and in a way designed to avoid overstretching Calcutta's capacity to deal effectively with new acquisitions. Dalhousie later wrote that he was &#145;for the extension of territory by way of consolidation&#146;  (Wood MSS). He noted in relation to Satara that,<blockquote>while I would not seek to lay down any inflexible rule with respect to adoption, I hold that on all occasions where heirs natural shall fail, the territory shall be made to lapse and adoption should not be permitted, excepting in those cases in which some strong political reason may render it expedient to depart from this general rule. (S. N. Prasad, <span class="italic">Paramountcy under Dalhousie</span>, 1964, 106)</blockquote>Dalhousie hoped incorporation of princely states would rationalize administration, broaden company revenue, and consolidate its geographical hold on the subcontinent. Such reasoning was the reality of Indian politics, and talk of any moral responsibility for the welfare of the population at large was &#145;nothing else than ambitious and hypothetical humbug&#146;  (India home miscellaneous series, vol. 828). Satara, therefore, &#145;lapsed&#146; and established the outline of Dalhousie's policy towards the princely states, although its presentation was moulded, in each case, by reaction to the policy both at home and in India.<h2>
<a name="TheannexationofthePunjab"></a>The annexation of the Punjab</h2>The Punjab was even more crucial; it came to exemplify Dalhousie's concern to link strategic and improving policies in a co-ordinated way to consolidate company power and provide a model for effective administration elsewhere in the subcontinent. In 1848 the Punjab lay beyond formal British authority but within the company's sphere of interest. The revolt at Multan, therefore, presented Dalhousie with a major crisis within ten months of arriving in India; he saw that a solution must allow military savings and some addition to company revenue, although initially he resisted annexation. A second Anglo-Sikh war had not been unexpected, but the difficulties the company forces experienced in gaining a decisive victory were a surprise and it was not until January 1849 that Multan was taken.<br>
<br>In the meantime Dalhousie had left Calcutta for the Punjab and exercised close, though not unchallenged, supervision over Lord Gough, the commander-in-chief. Victory was achieved only after considerable effort, and in March 1849 Dalhousie decided to annex the Punjab to reinforce company standing against its enemies within India. Drawing on the advice of those with experience of the Punjab during its period of company supervision after 1846, he was convinced that the province would be a paying proposition. The young Sikh maharaja Duleep Singh was deposed, and the famous Koh-i-noor diamond was confiscated and sent to Queen Victoria (it remains part of the British crown jewels). Dalhousie was created a marquess in recognition of his role in the campaign and, characteristically, noted in his diary that &#145;I of course prefer to be a Scottish Earl of 1633 to being an English Marquis of 1849&#146;, although he was still &#145;most deeply grateful for it and gratified by it&#146;  (Warner, 1.230&#150;31).<h2>
<a name="ConsolidationandconciliationinthePunjab"></a>Consolidation and conciliation in the Punjab</h2>Dalhousie was fully aware that annexation was only the start of the Punjab problem; it was the largest and most powerful state to be absorbed by the company since the final defeat of the Marathas in 1818. Contemporaries drew a distinction between it and previous conquests; annexation had not just overturned a dynasty but clashed with a nationality, so British policy had to be more comprehensive, persuasive, and assertive than ever before. Dalhousie was, therefore, concerned to frame a civil policy pitched towards the local sources of influence while maintaining a firm grip on military security. His response was to devise a mixed form of military and civilian government under his own supervision, so the Punjab became a new form of non-regulation province under a board of administration until 1853. Boards, which divided authority and responsibility, were not generally favoured by Dalhousie, but it provided a way of managing Henry Lawrence (hitherto the British resident in Lahore), whom he thought &#145;plus Sikh que les Sikhs&#146;. The governor-general also wanted to make the best use of the available official talent, and made appointments without regard to the usual rules of seniority. In contrast to the older established territories, the new administration was to be &#145;rough and ready &hellip; until revenues mend&#146;  (Dalhousie MSS). Dalhousie also identified the need for a co-ordinated scheme of pacification and development to stitch the Sikhs to company rule, and was therefore keen to use &#145;Native Agency united with Europeans&#146; because &#145;policy would dictate our doing so, even if finance should not compel it&#146;  (Henry Lawrence MSS).<br>
<br>Dalhousie was equally keen that annexation should not mean full-scale, and therefore unsettling, change for the Punjab. The authority of the local chiefs (<i>sardars</i>) had already been undermined by the military and political changes that had swept the province since the death of Ranjit Singh in 1839. Where <i>sardars</i> were effective collaborators with company rule, they were retained. Where resumption by the new rulers of chiefly authority was deemed necessary, extremes of leniency or harshness were avoided and the decisions made with certainty and quietness to consolidate British control. The major problems facing the board were in the extraction of revenue from powerful village brotherhoods, which held sway in most of the province, and in settling the men of the defeated Sikh army back to the plough. Dalhousie was anxious to preserve village rights so far as possible and to establish effective arbitration procedures; settlement officers were vested with full civil and revenue powers. Revenue demands were cut by 25 per cent and it is clear that Dalhousie was carefully balancing immediate needs against longer-term political security. Mistakes occurred, but settlement officers trod as carefully as possible. John Lawrence was petitioned by some headmen in Butala; he sent them away but told the assessing officer that &#145;You might quietly take a look at your statements&#146;  (John Lawrence MSS). The care with which these detailed problems were approached owed much to the influence of the governor-general himself.<br>
<br>The Punjab pacification also necessitated dealing with about 40,000 Sikh soldiers. Dalhousie decided, despite misgivings from London, to recruit local corps and regarded &#145;the free enlistment of the young Sikhs from the Manjha [area] as a measure of great political value&#146;  (Dalhousie MSS), thereby establishing a key component of the future military history of India. The Manjha benefited from Dalhousie's blend of civil and military policy because he considered it<blockquote>of the utmost moment to provide means of subsistence and employment for the Sikhs of the Manjha who have been the most turbulent in the recent proceedings and have been most affected by the results of the war &hellip; To this end the opening of new branches from the Irrigation Canal which traverses the upper Manjha &hellip; was very early urged upon me on Political and Financial grounds. (Dalhousie MSS)</blockquote>This combined policy was crucial to the stability of the Punjab during the tumult of 1857.<h2>
<a name="TheannexationofPegu"></a>The annexation of Pegu</h2>The Punjab problem came early in Dalhousie's Indian career and did much to develop his ideas for consolidating company rule. Ideally, such consolidation would concentrate on civil and economic measures, but Dalhousie soon concluded that the company &#145;could not, consistently with its own safety, appear in an attitude of inferiority &hellip; among the numberless princes and peoples embraced within the vast circuit of the Empire&#146;  (Dalhousie MSS) in India. External difficulties always posed dangers. Trouble in Burma during 1851 was, therefore, unwelcome to Dalhousie; it gave no opportunity to consolidate within the natural frontiers, nor did it promise much for the company's coffers. The grievances of British mercantile interests in Rangoon were old and unproven, but they were skilfully manipulated. Dalhousie tried hard to avoid war but failed: the new province of Pegu was added to the empire on 20 December 1852. Dalhousie decided that Pegu should be entrusted to a commissioner with an administration similar to that developed for the Punjab. Initial optimism about a swift settlement proved unfounded, and the governor-general characteristically brought his direct authority to bear. The commissioner was asked to prepare a comprehensive plan for future government of the province; he was told that &#145;order internally I must have, and at whatever cost&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Dalhousie&#150;Phayre Correspondence, 1852&#150;56</span>, ed. D. G. E. Hall, 1932, 100). Effective British authority was gradually imposed from 1854, and Pegu also remained quiet in 1857.<h2>
<a name="AbsorptionofprincelystateswithinIndia"></a>Absorption of princely states within India</h2>Dalhousie had reservations about the annexation of both the Punjab and Pegu; both threatened to pose major problems for his concept of an ordered consolidation of company rule. This was not the case, however, in relation to the absorption of many of the &#145;internal&#146; princely states: he advocated<blockquote>taking advantage of every just opportunity which presents itself for consolidating the territories which already belong to us, by taking possession of States which may lapse in the midst of them; for getting rid of those petty intervening principalities which may be a means of annoyance, but which can never, I venture to think, be a source of strength. (Hunter, 128&#150;9)</blockquote>The outcome at Satara has been noted, as has the fact that Dalhousie did not invent the doctrine of lapse. It was typical of the man that he applied the doctrine in a more rigorous and uniform way than his predecessors; he presumed in favour of annexation if it could be done &#145;legitimately&#146;. Even so, not all princely states could have lapsed to company rule in this way; Dalhousie generally recognized the right to adopt of those rulers whose sovereignty predated company paramountcy.<br>
<br>Financial and security factors form a thread through Dalhousie's absorptions of internal princely states. The nizam of Hyderabad lost territory through the long-standing question of the financing of the Hyderabad contingent, a body of native troops provided for company use. Dalhousie, concerned as always to make the most of scarce resources, wished to see the contingent's cost cut and its troops used more flexibly. He did not want the full-scale annexation of Hyderabad; instead, he wanted a portion of Hyderabad to be held against the costs of the contingent. This was achieved in 1853. Nagpur was next to be absorbed, in 1854; Dalhousie wrote, &#145;To sum up in one sentence, the possession of Nagpur would combine our military strength and would enlarge our commercial resources&#151;and would materially tend to consolidate our power&#146;  (Dalhousie MSS). The lapse, however, did not take place without heirs coming forward, and a contemporary noted that &#145;the real law by which Nagpur was added to our dominions was the law of the strongest&#146;  (E. Arnold, <span class="italic">The Marquess of Dalhousie's Administration of British India</span>, 2 vols., 1862&#150;5, 2.164&#150;6). Nagpur was to Dalhousie a classic case of consolidation; it added 40 lakhs of rupees to the company's annual revenue and 80,000 square miles of valuable territory in central India, and it straddled the routes from Bombay to Calcutta and the north.<br>
<br>The same principle of lapse on failure of heirs was applied to several other princely states by Dalhousie. In Jhansi (1853) he decided that<blockquote>the British Government would not derive any material advantage from the annexation &hellip; for it was very small and its revenue inconsiderable; but since it lay in the midst of other British districts its possession &hellip; would tend to the improvement of the general internal administration of British possessions in Bundlekund, beside greatly benefiting the people of Jhansi. (Rahim, 210)</blockquote>Jaitpur and Sambalpur (1849), Baghpat (1850), and Udaipur (1852) were also incorporated under lapse. Absorption of these smaller states caused concern among some native rulers about the company's long-term intentions, and the home government refused Dalhousie's desire to absorb Karauli, one of the oldest Rajput states. After the mutiny the annexation of Baghpat and Udaipur was reversed. Dalhousie was convinced, however, that his policy was the correct way to consolidate the reality of company power behind its extended frontier.<br>
<br>Dalhousie also abolished several titular sovereignties that had ceased to have any real substance and yet remained as a distraction to company supremacy. In 1853 he supported the wish of the Madras government to avoid designating an heir as nawab of the Carnatic, and in 1855 the raj of Tanjore was suppressed. Dalhousie also contemplated abolishing the Mughal emperor's title at Delhi but was overruled by caution in London.<h2>
<a name="TheannexationofOudh"></a>The annexation of Oudh</h2>Just as Dalhousie's Indian career opened with exceptional events in the Punjab, so it closed with an exceptional problem in Oudh. The annexation of Oudh was not undertaken on the basis of conquest, lapse, or suppression of titular sovereignty. Since 1801 it had been a protected state with full internal autonomy but had become racked by increasing internal political strife. Dalhousie was reluctant to intervene if it would cost rather than raise company revenues. Yet Oudh was both economically productive and strategically important, straddling as it did the trading and military routes from Bengal to the north-west. The nawabs had also provided useful loans to the company during moments of crisis such as the First Anglo-Afghan War (1838&#150;42), and many of their wealthier citizens held company stock.<br>
<br>The loyalty of the nawabs over many years forced Dalhousie to admit that he could not &#145;find a pretext&#146; for annexation and to decide to preserve the nawab's title and royal status, a line inconsistent with his general views. In February 1856, however, the king refused to sign a new treaty, or to abdicate, thereby breaking the loyalty that had protected him for so long; Oudh was consequently annexed. The transition to British rule had all the appearance of ease and order backed by the co-operation of the nawab. It was decided that the new administration should be modelled on that of the Punjab, and the same attempts were made to balance company control with the adherence of locals with power and influence. Unlike the Punjab, however, the measures did not work as well, and arguably contributed to the uprising of 1857. The long-standing question of Oudh was tackled very late in the day by Dalhousie, and absorption of the province was rushed. Dalhousie was unable to devote the detailed attention he applied to the Punjab: he was preoccupied with handover arrangements for his successor, and was in increasingly poor health.<h2>
<a name="ThematerialimprovementofIndia"></a>The material improvement of India</h2>Traditionally, territorial acquisitions occupy centre stage of Dalhousie's Indian career. From his own perspective internal reforms were equally important, not as agents of deliberate &#145;Westernizing&#146;, but as practical steps for the consolidation of British power in India. Temperament and previous experience fitted him well for a career devoted to &#145;improvement&#146; in the mid-Victorian sense. As with India's external and princely state affairs, financial difficulties were also central to domestic policies. Dalhousie strove after the most cost-effective administration possible for India's development as a modern state. This would hinge as much on railways, posts and telegraphs, streamlined bureaucracy, and reformed education as on improved military and territorial measures.<br>
<br>Dalhousie's annexations added to revenue and, although charges initially increased in a higher proportion than income, strenuous efforts were made to keep costs to a minimum. Besides, he saw territorial accretion as an inevitable process to be regulated and assessed in the longer term; only when company rule was securely established on a wider revenue base throughout India could real returns be expected. His aim was not uniform centralization but local responsiveness. Ideally the government of India should not control local affairs, and fully centralized departments like the post office should be the exception rather than the rule. Dalhousie wanted secure administration and attacked what he saw as proven abuses. For instance, he said Bombay's administrative problems were worsened by the presidency government's tendency to correspond on little slips of paper &#145;like an electric telegraph&#146;  (Dalhousie MSS). He also reduced courses at Fort William College from twenty-two to six months, supplementing them with in-service training, and pressed for competitive entry designed to produce a more professional service. If India was not understood, she could not be administered safely: &#145;There never was a mutiny in this army except from our own injustice or ill management&#146;  (Dalhousie, <span class="italic">Letters</span>, 344). He also took steps to enlarge the legislative council and to include more expert opinion; there were already Indians who could contribute to policy. In 1854 the appointment of an Indian judge to the bench of the <i>sadr adalat</i> was recommended.<br>
<br>The changes made in the administration of the law sprang from the same desire for more effective, impartial, and therefore secure rule, for example by bringing Europeans within the jurisdiction of local criminal courts (they already came under local civil courts), although Indian law needed modification to be acceptable to Europeans. Dalhousie undertook some of the most important domestic reforms ever introduced into modern India. Most significant was probably his railway scheme, contained in a seminal minute of 1853 which drew much on his previous British ministerial experience and was heralded by the <span class="italic">Friend of India</span> newspaper as &#145;the text book for all future Railway projects in India&#146;  (8 Sept 1853). The minute also embodied proposals that had been impossible at home. Dalhousie wished to establish a strategic scheme for the whole country, embracing a rational assessment of political, military, and commercial needs and, while making the most of private capital, reserved the right of the government of India to take over lines after twenty-five or thirty years. He was also careful to decide on only one gauge&#151;of 5 ft 6 in.&#151;after careful weighing of the technical and financial arguments, rather than the standard of 4 ft 8&frac12; in. established after the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825. Dalhousie took care to make the best use possible of expert opinion and worked closely with Colonel John Pitt Kennedy, who had been appointed consulting engineer for railways in 1850. In 1853 the first line in India was opened over the 20 miles from Bombay to Thana. In 1855 Dalhousie himself inaugurated the first section of the East Indian Railway from Calcutta to Raniganj. By 1858 there were 400 miles of railway open and another 3600 planned throughout the subcontinent.<br>
<br>Dalhousie supplemented railways with the electric telegraph, which revolutionized the tempo of both commercial and official business. He also established a public works department and colleges of engineering, key agents in development policy, especially of roads and irrigation. Social measures included the initiation of a complete scheme of public education in both English and the vernaculars (framed before Sir Charles Wood's famous <span class="roman">Education Despatch</span> of 1854), action against thuggee, suttee, dacoity, and infanticide, concern to improve the lot of Indian women, and reform of prison administration. In social policy he was generally careful to avoid disturbing deeply held Indian beliefs; for example, it was &#145;the duty of the Government to maintain in Calcutta, as heretofore, the Seminaries of that peculiar oriental learning which is cultivated by the great sects of Hindus and Musalmans respectively&#146;  (S. C. Ghosh, &#145;The utilitarianism of Dalhousie and the material improvement of modern India&#146;, <span class="italic">Modern Asian Studies</span>, Feb 1978). He also held that &#145;no British subject should suffer penalties in his person or in his property by reason of the religious creed that he professes&#146;  (Dalhousie MSS), and he was keen that the Taj Mahal, as a symbol of historic India, should not have a railway viaduct built in too close proximity. Increased social change was fostered, nevertheless, and contributed to the outbreak of 1857.<br>
<br>The three quasi-autonomous presidency governments sometimes frustrated Dalhousie in his quest for efficiency although, as noted, he was aware of the dangers of over-centralization. He reorganized the workings of the central secretariat and the governor-general's council in Calcutta through the division of the work and the introduction of more specific accountability. He was also called upon to implement the changes required by the company's new charter passed by the British parliament in 1853 and to institute the new legislative council and the lieutenant-governorship of Bengal. One of his last acts was to put forward proposals for military reforms, including a case for increasing the company's European strength and reducing dependence on native troops. The Indian army had for a long time diverted some of its best officers to civil administration, and Dalhousie's concern increased when British troops withdrew for service in the Crimean War (1854&#150;6), despite his objections, because the European force was &#145;not more than adequate for preserving the Empire in security and tranquillity even in ordinary times&#146;  (C. Jackson, <span class="italic">A Vindication of the Marquis of Dalhousie's Indian Administration</span>, 1865, 160&#150;61). Again he was concerned that the responsibilities of company power fell short of the means to fulfil them.<h2>
<a name="AfterIndiaretirementanddeath"></a>After India: retirement and death</h2>Dalhousie's tenure as governor-general was twice extended, so that he served for three years beyond his allotted time. At a personal level his career in India was immensely stressful (he referred to it as a form of &#145;transportation&#146;), and his habit of hard work together with the climate soon took its toll on his health. From 1853 his life was also seriously overshadowed by the death of his wife <i>en route</i> to Britain to convalesce, although he received immense support from his elder daughter, Lady Susan, who joined him in 1854. In 1855 he spent time in the Nilgiri hills in a vain attempt to restore his energies and was glad to hand over his responsibilities to Canning on 29 February 1856, leaving India &#145;exhausted with fatigue, agitation and pain&#146;, telling his friend Couper that &#145;Opus exegi&#151;my work is done&#146;, and determined on retirement  (Dalhousie, <span class="italic">Letters</span>, 371).<br>
<br>He arrived at Spithead on 13 May 1856, having, typically, spent the voyage composing a major review of his Indian administration. Dalhousie travelled to London and, although very ill, received a number of friends at Claridge's, including Gladstone. Dalhousie received a letter of thanks for his services from Queen Victoria, and the directors of the East India Company voted him a pension of &pound;5000 per year. In August he moved north to Arrochar and from there to Edinburgh (Dalhousie Castle being in the hands of builders). His health remained precarious; in December 1856 he wrote, &#145;My progress is so slow and my condition such, that there is no probability of my return to public life, under any circumstances, for a long time to come, if ever&#146;  (Warner, 2.400). During 1857 his health was further eroded by the news of the mutiny in India; a sea cruise to Malta brought little improvement. In September 1857 he recorded that &#145;I can hardly bear to think of the horrible scenes that have been acted&#146;  (ibid., 401). A year later he was back in Edinburgh and, as the alterations to Dalhousie Castle were by then complete, he took an interest in the running of the estate. India was never far away, however, and the factor on the estate recorded how Dalhousie often talked of the mutiny and considered that, if he had still been in Calcutta, the turmoil would not have happened.<br>
<br>Dalhousie's health remained poor, and in 1860 he gave up the duties of lord warden of the Cinque Ports (assumed after the death of the duke of Wellington in 1852). In September he was presented with a granddaughter by Lady Edith, who had married Sir James Fergusson in 1859. His strength now declined steadily; he died peacefully at home on 19 December 1860 from Bright's disease of the kidney. He was buried next to his wife in the Dalhousie vault in the old churchyard at Cockpen.<h2>
<a name="Dalhousiescareerassessed"></a>Dalhousie's career assessed</h2>In 1865 the duke of Argyll concluded, &#145;When the records of our Empire in the East are closed, Lord Dalhousie's administration will be counted with the greatest that have gone before it&#146;  (Campbell). It is a measure of Dalhousie's achievement that this verdict still holds true, and his career is seen as crucially important both by historians of the British empire in the East and by those of the emergence of India as a modern nation. Fittingly, Dalhousie Road still remains in New Delhi as a reminder to both traditions.<br>
<br>Dalhousie was frustrated in developing a political career at home, and India gave him the opportunity to make his mark from a sense of both patriotic duty and ambition for his family tradition. He proved himself a superb, lucid, and indefatigable administrator who was at once a master of detail but also a strategic thinker. He did not set out for India with any preconceived ideas of &#145;modernization&#146;, &#145;Westernization&#146;, or &#145;annexation&#146;. Instead he used his immense skills and energy in a pragmatic way to tackle the fundamental problem of closing the gap between the reality and fragility of company power on the one hand and the expectations vested in it on the other. It is for this that Dalhousie should be remembered and not for the supposed application of abstract nostrums or for a <i>post hoc</i> responsibility for the mutiny.<br>
