<span class="headword">Hewitt,  John</span>  (1719&#150;1802), <span class="occ">magistrate</span>, was born in Coventry, Warwickshire, the son of John Hewitt, a city linen draper, a trade he was later to follow himself. He lived all his life in Coventry, from 1746 onwards in a newly built house in Cross Cheaping. He served as mayor in 1755, 1758, and 1760 and, as one of the city's ten aldermen, was a magistrate for some thirty years. He was probably the uncle of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13149/', "James Hewitt, first Viscount Lifford (d. 1789)")</script>, whom he assisted by providing a lavish banquet in 1754 when the latter contested a Coventry parliamentary seat. On 7 February 1768, at Hinckley, Leicestershire, he married Catherine Dyer, the daughter of the Revd Dyer, a descendant of a former lord chief justice, Sir James Dyer.<br>
<br>Hewitt was an exceedingly zealous magistrate, prosecuting felons and transporting criminals. He carried on lengthy exchanges of letters with leading government figures of the day, soliciting their support for his actions to keep the peace. The 1750s and 1760s undeniably were decades of widespread civil disorder in the midlands, especially on account of the price of bread, and Hewitt made a stand against the rioters. His experiences of the disorders seem to have encouraged him to publish in 1779 a journal of his proceedings as magistrate, which was a strange mixture of cases he had brought successfully to justice, explanations of criminal law, and descriptions of some notorious local murders and thefts. His chief ambition, however, was to catch the Coventry gang, a group of highly skilled and well-known coiners led by Thomas Lightoler, who ultimately turned king's evidence and fled to Austria, leaving his fellow criminals to be executed at Lancaster in 1768. Lightoler, originally a carpenter, and his brother, Timothy, a skilled carver, in 1752 had created a chimney-piece for Hewitt's Coventry house, after working at Warwick Castle. Hewitt also tried to stop prostitution in Coventry and to enforce appropriate behaviour on Sundays, and he published a handbook for the use of constables (1779). His writings have a distinct tone of his efforts being unappreciated by those in power, and he always seemed very anxious to contact influential contemporaries, such as Sir John Fielding. He was a trustee of several city charities and became chamberlain in 1747 and sheriff in 1750; he also served as master of the Weavers' Company (1759&#150;61).<br>
<br>Hewitt died at his home in Cross Cheaping, Coventry, on 20 April 1802, leaving no will. He was buried in the north aisle of Holy Trinity, Coventry, and was commemorated there by a flat stone that is no longer visible.<br>
