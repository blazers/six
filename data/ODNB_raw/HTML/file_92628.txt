<span class="headword">Fitzpatrick,  Anthony James <span class="st"> [Tony]</span></span>  (1951&#150;2003), <span class="occ">engineer</span>, was born on 9 June 1951 at Forest Gate Hospital, West Ham, London, the second child of James Matthew Anthony Fitzpatrick and his wife, Ornella Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Corti. His father was a machine operator at a works in Stratford following his army service in Italy. His mother was Italian, and the young Fitzpatrick spent vacations near Florence. His upbringing was Roman Catholic, and he was an altar boy. His secondary schooling, from 1962 to 1969, was at St Bonaventure's Grammar School, Forest Gate, where he took his A-level examinations in mathematics and physics, studying Spanish to supplement his Italian. He took part in school activities, including the debating society. He chose civil engineering as a career in the belief that it would offer tangible and visible measures of his abilities, and he went to Leeds University from 1969 to 1972, where he was an outstanding student. He was a voracious scholar, taking all the courses that timetabling allowed beyond examination requirements. He responded to the intellectual freedom that characterized the Leeds civil engineering department at that time. The rigour of structural design and analysis attracted him. He graduated with a first-class degree, winning the Holst prize for civil engineering in 1972. He married Janet (Jan) Turnbull (<i>b</i>. 1950), a Leeds graduate in history, and daughter of William Turnbull, coalminer, on 24 June 1972.<br>
<br>Fitzpatrick was recommended by Leeds to Duncan Michael at Ove Arup and Partners. Michael was to remain a mentor throughout his career. Fitzpatrick began work in 1972 full of potential as an engineer, working with Frank Atkinson and Michael Shears on the Vestey headquarters building at Smithfield. For family reasons he and his wife moved to Pity Me, co. Durham, in 1973, and he worked on designs in the Newcastle office, commuting to York from August 1974 to be the supervising engineer on the new building of York District General Hospital. Arup had won some very high profile projects in Iran in the 1960s and after the Arab&#150;Israeli War of 1973 used this platform for new business to replace the void of the collapsed UK property market. Fitzpatrick and his wife moved in 1976 to Tehran (Janet continuing her teaching work), where he worked under Nigel Thompson and then Richard Haryott. He thrived in that chaotic context of glamorous projects, powerful people, the world's talent on tap, and excess of ambition with disorganized delivery, all overlaid on the politics, commerce, and culture of the imperial Persian court. This unreality came to an abrupt end with the overthrow of the shah in 1979, and Fitzpatrick rejoined his colleagues in London. He worked with David Croft and Michael Glover on the engineering system for the new British Library at St Pancras. Their designs and construction methods proved robust enough physically and financially to survive the reluctance and delays surrounding the project.<br>
<br>As the consulting engineer to the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank for rebuilding its head office in 1978, Arup drew up the list of architects to take part in a competition. The Croft&#150;Glover&#150;Fitzpatrick team was assigned to assist Jack Zunz, the engineer supporting Norman Foster, who duly won and was appointed to the project. After the initial design work Fitzpatrick moved to Hong Kong in 1982 with Janet and their first child, Sarah (<i>b</i>. 1981), to be the Arup project manager and <i>de facto</i> project leader. Again he thrived in the highly charged context of the bank's ambitions, the architect's leadership, and the rapid growth of the Arup office. Soon he was engineer also for new hotels in Dalian and Shanghai, with the position of project director. He was called back to London by Zunz in 1987 to become a director of Ove Arup and Partners. This marked his transition to acceptance at world level as a principal engineer in his own right. The family, by now including three girls, Kristina having been born in 1984 and Alexandra in 1986, made a new home at Tewin Wood, Hertfordshire, where their fourth child, Nicholas, was born in 1991.<br>
<br>Fitzpatrick joined Arup's structural engineering business, based in London, to help rejuvenate it. By 1987 this original activity of the firm had been overtaken by its various new interests but it remained essential overall that Arup's structural engineering should be pre-eminent in quality. Fitzpatrick gathered round him talented young engineers and sought collaboration with the best architects operating in Europe. In this he was spectacularly successful. There was a stream of Foster projects, with Ken Shuttleworth particularly, including Independent Television News's headquarters in Gray's Inn Road, Century Tower in Tokyo, the headquarters of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation at Canary Wharf, and Swiss Re (popularly known as &#145;the gherkin&#146;) at St Mary Axe. Concurrently, Fitzpatrick worked with Richard Rogers and his colleagues on the Reuters headquarters at Isle of Dogs and terminal 5 for the British Airports Authority at Heathrow. He engineered the covered Velodrome in Berlin with Perrault, built by the city authority for its Olympic games bid. He also worked with Herzog and de Meuron on the conversion of Bankside power station into Tate Modern. Some projects, like the 400 m tall Tour Sans Fin in Paris with the architect Jean Nouvel, the Mori Tower in Shanghai with Kohn Pedersen Fox, and London Bridge Tower, where Fitzpatrick proposed and introduced Renzo Piano to the developer, never did get built, despite their fame. Jane Wernick, one of Fitzpatrick's staff, had been the engineer working with the architects David Marks and Julia Barfield in the invention of the Millennium Wheel (the London Eye). As its development progressed, Fitzpatrick took responsibility for the Arup engineering. British Airways, by now the part owner, opted to procure the wheel's engineering directly from manufacturers and Fitzpatrick ended the Arup connection. Among these next-generation constructs, the expansion of the Royal Opera House was an odd one for Fitzpatrick. Stuart Lipton greatly admired Fitzpatrick, employing him on his commercial developments. When asked to sort out the Opera House project he insisted on Fitzpatrick joining as engineer, with immediate results. Through this storm of activity Fitzpatrick joined the Arup main board in April 1993.<br>
<br>The idea for the form of the Millennium Bridge between St Paul's and Tate Modern came from Roger Ridsdill Smith and Chris Wise, two of Fitzpatrick's engineer colleagues. Their design was used for the competition by the team of Arup (Sir Jack Zunz), Sir Anthony Caro, and Lord Foster, who won and were appointed for the detailed design and procurement work. In June 2000 the bridge was opened to the public but some hours later was closed after developing a swing, caused by the huge crowd walking in rhythm with one of the bridge's natural lateral frequencies. Fitzpatrick reverted to being project chief for the remedial work, throwing his huge energies into the technical, financial, and relationship aspects, while almost all others backed away. The bridge reopened successfully in February 2002, the energy dispersing devices which were designed and installed looking as if they were intended. Fitzpatrick took this episode totally onto his own shoulders. Though he had sympathetic support from Lipton and key people within Arup, particularly its chairman, Bob Emmerson, who handled the reputational aspects, he put no dependence on anyone in his mission of restoring the bridge to the public.<br>
<br>Emotionally exhausted and looking for a new task, Fitzpatrick took up the leadership of Arup America in 2001 to develop the potential of the firm's work there, which had been only partly realized since it opened in 1984. Based in Tiburon, California, he commuted between California, New York, and the UK. He set out to be a good leader for the many talented engineers of Arup America and to improve their integration with the whole firm. In contrast to the field generalship of his approach in Europe (where he still carried on) he did not immediately engage with the owners or the project architects in the USA, instead reshaping the various offices and their leaders, preparing for a large, high-quality expansion. The USA was a discovery for Fitzpatrick. He was hugely in tune with what he found&#151;the opportunities, the openness, the people, the mountains, and the style.<br>
<br>Fitzpatrick joined the Institution of Structural Engineers in 1979, the Hong Kong Institution of Engineers in 1983 (becoming a registered structural engineer in the same year), the Royal Academy of Engineering in 1993, and the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1999. He was made an honorary fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 2002. He shared in the publication of papers about his projects, especially the bank in Hong Kong and the Millennium Bridge, and lectured on his work all over the world. He took no interest in further formal education for himself after Leeds, but acquired new knowledge, skills, and methods as he went.<br>
<br>Fitzpatrick had long had an interest in diet and in fitness. He extolled Italian cookery and practised it, though he would munch and talk through one apple for a business lunch. He had broken his leg badly on a railway platform and thereafter exercised frequently, on a machine early in his office and excitedly on a mountain bicycle whenever he could find time to visit rough terrain. It was a release. He was eloquent on the finer aspects of carbon and titanium in a bicycle. In California he joined the Marin Cyclists.<br>
<br>On the morning of 26 July 2003 Fresno Cycle Club held its annual climb to Kaiser Pass, a 160-mile round trip up to an elevation of 9200 feet in the Sierra and back down to Clovis, with 400 cyclists participating. Coming down Huntingdon Lake Road, on a steep right-hand bend, Fitzpatrick lost control of his bicycle and slid under a truck which was climbing up the incline, dying instantly in the impact. His funeral was held in St Peter's Church at Tewin on 14 August and a memorial celebration of his life was held at Tate Modern, Bankside, on 26 October. He was survived by his wife, Janet, and their four children.<br>
<br>Fitzpatrick embodied paradox, continually acting out dualities: he had no interest in sport but used mountain biking as his outlet; he wanted women to succeed in engineering but was paterfamilias at home; he had to be his own man but gave total loyalty to demanding architects; he was not athletic but was obsessive about fitness and strength; he cared for people but could not tolerate less than competence; he recognized engineering ability but found it hard to operate as an equal; he was forcefully noisy in argument but accepted a better case completely; and he had to be a name but threw in his lot totally with the Arup way. He identified talented people and lifted them. Quite often they were not as perfect as he then believed and he would find himself having to move back and remedy matters.<br>
<br>When he was a new graduate Fitzpatrick had little expectation of the prospects that lay ahead for him. He just wanted to learn his trade and take part in projects. That he had the potential to be much more than that was clear to his seniors and he had the wit to appreciate and take the unfolding opportunities. He was painfully honest, compelled to get to the heart of an issue without obfuscation. He tried to be rigorous intellectually, moving arguments on at alarming speed. He hated not getting to the point first. In all this he was consistent throughout his life. His religious and political views were not on display, and were probably not overt determinants for him. His relationship with his family was very intense but also intermittent, whisking some of the children off to a cycling Saturday in the Yorkshire dales, or taking others for a couple of days to European cities, or camping high and cold in the Pyrenees. They were all growing up and at schools and university when Fitzpatrick moved to California, and they had not yet moved to join him when he died. What he would have achieved in his next twenty years if he had lived is not clear, though it would have been leadership rooted in engineering in real, active contexts.<br>
