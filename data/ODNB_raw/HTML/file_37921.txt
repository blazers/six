<span class="headword">Rudd,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1498&#150;1579), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and cartographer</span>, was born in Yorkshire. In 1515 he entered Clare College, Cambridge, and by 1520 had taken the degrees of BA and MA. Ordained to the priesthood in 1521, he subsequently became a fellow of St John's College, Cambridge, and graduated BTh in 1530.<br>
<br>During the religious changes of the 1530s Rudd initially adopted a clear anti-reformist stance, and in 1534 he was briefly imprisoned on the order of Thomas Cromwell. However, with the ascendancy of the conservative faction in the 1540s Rudd began to achieve a modest prominence, being nominated clerk of the closet, which brought him into close personal contact with Henry VIII. Before 1547 he had become vicar of the collegiate church of Norton in co. Durham, and a prebendary of Beverley, Burton upon Trent, and St Stephen's in Westminster, appointments which (with the exception of Norton) were lost owing to the dissolution of these colleges in 1548. However, Rudd appears to have gained the patronage of John Dudley, later duke of Northumberland, and he was compensated with a royal chaplaincy and prebends in the cathedrals of Durham (1550) and Winchester (1551). In 1551 he demonstrated his increasing devotion to the new doctrines by taking a wife, though this was to ensure deprivation from all his livings under Mary in 1554. However, after confessing his fault at Paul's Cross he was once more rewarded, this time with three Yorkshire livings, the vicarages of Dewsbury (1554) and Hornsea-cum-Riston (1557), and the rectory of Thornhill (1558).<br>
<br>Elizabeth's accession allowed Rudd to receive back his wife, along with his Durham prebend and the vicarage of Norton, on the resignation of Hornsea. In 1570 he resigned Dewsbury, having been presented to the wealthy Richmondshire rectory of Romaldkirk in 1569. It is difficult to penetrate Rudd's religious views with any certainty. Whether his survival was that of a cynical trimmer or one who had a paramount belief in the idea of the royal supremacy is impossible to determine, but he cannot have been a good parochial pastor because of his persistent plurality.<br>
<br>Rudd's promotions were probably attempts to remunerate a man who was of more value to the Tudor state as a cartographer than as a cleric. While he was imprisoned in 1534 he was working on a map of the Holy Land which was sent to Cromwell's confidant, Rowland Lee, in an attempt to secure his release. Rudd claimed that it was more accurate than any that had been made before, and there is a strong possibility that it is to be identified with the map which appears in the 1535 English <span class="roman">Bible</span> of Miles Coverdale. Released from prison, Rudd travelled round the country undertaking surveys and checking information at first hand. In 1561 he received a royal dispensation to be absent from his Durham prebend to finalize a map of England &#145;both fairer and more perfect and truer than it hath been hitherto&#146;  (Durham chapter records, register B, fol. 135). One of his assistants in this task was Christopher Saxton, who came from Dunningley near Dewsbury and who was working as his servant in 1570. The completed work was possibly the map of the British Isles published by Gerardus Mercator in Duisburg in 1564.<br>
<br>Rudd married Isabel Whildon in 1551. They are known to have had three sons and three daughters. The eldest son, Edmund, died as a fellow of Clare College, Cambridge, in 1576. When an inventory was made of Edmund Rudd's possessions it included maps, and, perhaps significantly, an unfinished map and a drawing table, but it is not clear whether he was a cartographer in his own right, or was merely in possession of items &#145;on loan&#146; from his father. John Rudd died at Durham in 1579 and was buried in the cathedral: his wife died at Durham in 1582, her inventory recording &#145;three maps&#146; and &#145;one old map&#146; among her possessions.<br>
