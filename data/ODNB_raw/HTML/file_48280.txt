<span class="headword">Bacheler <span class="st"> [Bachiler]</span>,  Daniel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1572, <em>d.</em> 1619), <span class="occ">lutenist and composer</span>, was baptized on 16 March 1572 at Aston Clinton, Buckinghamshire, the fifth of the ten children of Richard Bacheler (1545&#150;1583) and his wife, Elizabeth Cardell. On 13 November 1579 he was apprenticed to his mother's brother Thomas Cardell, a lutenist and dancing-master to Queen Elizabeth, with whom he went to live in King's Street in the parish of St Margaret's, Westminster. In June 1586 his apprenticeship was signed over to Sir Francis Walsingham, principal secretary of state.<br>
<br>For the Walsingham family Bacheler composed several pieces for the broken consort, the ultra-modern music for mixed instruments of which he was one of the originators. Eight of these have survived, one dated as early as 1588, when he would have been only sixteen; three of the Walsingham consort books, thought to be in his hand, are in Hull University Library. In Thomas Lant's illustration of the funeral procession of Walsingham's son-in-law Sir Philip Sidney, Bacheler is depicted sitting on Sidney's war-horse. After Walsingham's death in 1590 he joined the household of Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex, on his marriage to the widowed Frances Sidney. There he was paid &pound;7 10<i>s</i>. a quarter and set to music Essex's poem &#145;To Plead my Faith&#146;. This is his only surviving song. In August 1599 Bacheler was entrusted with letters from Queen Elizabeth to the earl, who was then fighting in Ireland.<br>
<br>When Lady Essex, by this time married to her third husband, the earl of Clanricarde, was invited to the court of Anne of Denmark, consort of James I, Bacheler accompanied her. Coming to the notice of the queen, in 1603 he was appointed the highest paid groom of her privy chamber, receiving &pound;160 a year. Further rewards followed in return for such services as overseeing the maintenance of musical instruments at court and acting as a secretary, as when in 1606 he wrote on his mistress's behalf to the earl of Salisbury, thanking him for the present of a cup. In May 1604 Queen Anne granted to him and William Gomeldon &#145;a chest of arrows cast up as a wreck&#146; in her manor of Portland  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, 107); later he received the manor of Walton-cum-Trimley in Suffolk. In February 1607 he was granted a coat of arms bearing three dragons' heads, the dragon being the symbol of Denmark.<br>
<br>In his years at court Bacheler composed at least fifty pieces for the lute, the best known being &#145;Mounsiers Almaine&#146;. While his earlier lute music exhibits a traditional style, with a complex contrapuntal structure and much use of imitation, later pieces found in Lord Herbert of Cherbury's lute book (Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge) reveal that he developed a simpler, chordal style. Throughout, the complexity and sheer technical difficulty of his music point to a superlative lutenist and a composer of enormous talent, second only to the great John Dowland, whose son Robert described Bacheler as &#145;right perfect&#146;.<br>
<br>No record of a marriage has been found, but Cecily Bacheler of Twickenham, conveniently near Hampton Court, who died in 1610, was probably Bacheler's wife. In 1617 he witnessed the will of his uncle Thomas Cardell, who left him his chain of gold, but Bacheler died first, possibly of smallpox, which rampaged through the court in the winter of 1618&#150;19. He was buried on 29 January 1619 in St Margaret's churchyard, Lee, Kent. He died intestate and without widow or children, and his brothers William and John disputed with his nephew Samuel over his considerable property.<br>
