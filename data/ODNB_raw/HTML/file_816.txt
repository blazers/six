</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Astle,  Thomas</span>  (1735&#150;1803), <span class="occ">archivist and collector of books and manuscripts</span>, was born on 22 December 1735 at Yoxall, on the edge of Needwood Forest, Staffordshire, the eldest son of Daniel Astle (<i>d</i>. 1775), keeper of the forest, who was of a family long established at Fauld in Hanbury, Staffordshire, and his wife, Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1745&times;7). He was perhaps educated at Eton College. He was articled to an attorney at Yoxall, but, despite having lost one eye in an accident at school, chose instead to spend his life in the world of ancient manuscripts and records.<br>
<br>In 1761 Astle was engaged by the British Museum to compile the index to the catalogue of the Harley manuscripts; he was probably also responsible for the long and very useful preface. In the same year that this was published, 1763, he was elected FSA; he was elected FRS in 1766. On 18 December 1765 he married Anna Maria, the only daughter and heir of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19159/', "Revd Philip Morant (1700&#150;1770)")</script>, the historian of Essex, and his wife, Anne Stebbing (<i>d</i>. 1767). They had four sons and at least three daughters.<br>
<br>&#145;In the paper-office there is a wight, called Thomas Astle, who lives like moths on old parchments&#146;, wrote Horace Walpole in 1775  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 42.238), and it was no doubt true that Astle spent much of his time there. On 22 July 1763 George Grenville, who was then prime minister and chancellor of the exchequer, had nominated him, with Sir Joseph Ayloffe and Dr A. C. Ducarel, to report on the records in the state paper office; following their suggestion, a standing commission was set up (by warrant of 16 July 1764), paying them each &pound;100 p.a. to methodize, regulate, and digest the materials in that office. At almost the same time the same trio investigated the records in the augmentation office, and again, following their suggestion in a report, a standing commission was set up (by warrant of 12 June 1765), paying them each &pound;100 p.a. to methodize and digest all the exchequer records. Astle seems to have retained his part in these responsibilities until death, though in 1789 he renounced the income from the state paper office post (by then &pound;200 p.a., perhaps because the two commissions had been merged into one) in favour of his son, Thomas Astle junior, who joined him as commissioner. These were not sinecures: as Astle wrote to Lord (W. W.) Grenville earlier in 1789, &#145;Myself and Mr [John] Topham are the efficient officers in the State Paper Office, the business of Sir Stanier Porten the Keeper, and of Mr Ramsden the Transmitter of the State Papers being intirely done by us&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 59000, fol. 91<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>In 1766 Astle was consulted by a committee of the House of Lords about the publication of ancient parliamentary records: this led to the Lords' decision that the rolls of parliament should be printed. Philip Morant took the leading part in this work (having been suggested for it by his son-in-law) from 1768 until his death in 1770; Astle then took his place, dealing, apparently, with the years after 2 Henry VI. He made slow progress, and only finished the work of collating the printed sheets with the originals in 1776; the six volumes of <span class="italic">Rotuli parliamentorum, ut et petitiones, et placita in parliamento [1278&#150;1503]</span> were published only in 1783 (still without an index), though some sets were distributed in 1777. The work was accurate and respectable by the standards of the time, but was in no sense a critical edition of the texts: Astle and his fellow editors seem, for instance, to have been unaware of the survival of the original parliamentary petitions on which so many of the parliamentary rolls' texts were based (being responses to the petitions). A supplement of omitted materials was published in 1935, and in the 1990s it was decided that a new edition of the rolls should be prepared.<br>
<br>After the death in 1775 of Henry Rooke, chief clerk of the record office in the Tower, Astle was appointed to his place; on 30 December 1783, following the death of Sir John Shelley, keeper of the records, he was admitted to the higher office. Despite opposition from the prime minister, William Pitt, he retained the keeper's high salary of &pound;500 p.a. He was elected a trustee of the British Museum in 1787.<br>
<br>Astle produced a number of publications on his own account, generally drawing on manuscripts in his own collection. An article in <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span> (10, 1792) on his charter of King Edgar (now BL, Stowe Charter 31) was a careful demonstration that it is not of its purported date. In 1775 he printed, anonymously, <span class="italic">The Will of King Henry VII</span> from the original in the chapter house records at Westminster Abbey, with a short preface. He had a hand in the publication of Joseph Ayloffe's <span class="italic">Calendars of Ancient Charters</span> (1772) and <span class="italic">The Will of King Alfred</span> (1788), for each of which he wrote an anonymous preface, and in the compilation of Andrew Colt&eacute;e Ducarel's <span class="italic">History of the royal hospital and collegiate church of St. Katharine, near the Tower of London, from its foundation in 1273</span> (1782).<br>
<br>Astle's most substantial work was <span class="italic">The Origin and Progress of Writing</span> (1784); a second edition, slightly enlarged (notably by the addition of a portrait of the author), was published in 1803. It is a wide-ranging piece of scholarship, with excellent plates of facsimiles of scripts, engraved by B. T. Pouncy: universal in its scope, it includes a history of printing as well as accounts of the materials used for writing, numerals and the characters used for numerals, and secret writing and ciphers. It must have been inspired by Astle's continental books or acquaintances&#151;he is said to have been &#145;several times on the Continent on literary pursuits&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 3.203n.)&#151;though for its immediate sources he drew on his own collection of charters, manuscripts, and facsimiles (such as those in Stowe MSS 1060&#150;1061). It was an authoritative source for the history of writing well into the nineteenth century, and was last reprinted in 1876. Today it seems remarkable more for its out-of-the-way learning than for any methodological advance upon its continental precursors.<br>
<br>Astle formed an outstanding collection of charters and manuscripts, as well as a fine library of printed books. He certainly frequented the London salerooms, but it is not known how he acquired some of his greatest treasures, such as forty-two pre-conquest charters (BL, Stowe charters 1&#150;42; most of these had belonged to the Dering family of Kent), or an eleventh-century Latin psalter with interlinear Old English glosses (Stowe MS 2, called &#145;King Alfred's Psalter&#146; by Astle). In 1769 or 1770 Michael Lort presented to him the eleventh-century <span class="italic">Liber vitae</span> of Hyde Abbey, Winchester: this volume (Stowe MS 944), which contains the text (in Old English) of the will of King Alfred, he had handsomely bound in green morocco, stamped with the arms of Astley which he had assumed. Overall, the collection was especially rich in monastic cartularies, chronicles and other medieval texts, Tudor ceremonial and heraldic works, and catalogues and other works concerning the public records, but there was hardly an area of interest that was not represented. From the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, Astle had the &#145;Hanover state papers&#146; (Stowe MSS 222&#150;232), being the correspondence of Jean Robethon, who was private secretary to both William III and George I; he also had the entire collection of manuscripts and printed books of his father-in-law, Morant. Astle's manuscripts must have totalled over 250, quite apart from many dozens, or even hundreds, of medieval charters.<br>
<br>Astle died on 1 December 1803 at his home, Battersea Rise, Surrey, after suffering for some time from &#145;a dropsical complaint&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 3.203n.); his wife survived him. He was buried in St Mary's Church, Battersea. By his will he gave to his old patron's son, George Grenville, first marquess of Buckingham, an option to buy his manuscripts for the nominal sum of &pound;500: this was exercised (to what must have been the chagrin of the British Museum, which had second option), and a special room designed by John Soane was constructed for them at Grenville's seat, Stowe House, Buckinghamshire. In 1849 the manuscripts were catalogued for sale by auction, as 996 lots, but were purchased privately, for &pound;8000, by Bertram Ashburnham, fourth earl of Ashburnham, and were removed to Ashburnham Place, Sussex. Thirty years later, in 1879, his son, Bertram Asburnham, fifth earl of Ashburnham, sold the Stowe manuscripts to the government for &pound;45,000; ninety-five that are of Irish interest were given to the Royal Irish Academy, but the rest&#151;of which the most valuable and interesting are those that had once belonged to Astle&#151;were placed in the British Museum, and, still called the Stowe manuscripts, remain in the British Library's department of manuscripts. Astle's 1500 or more printed books, of which many had come to him from Morant, had their interest enhanced by the notes that both scholars were in the habit of adding to them. Almost all were purchased from Astle's executors in 1804, for &pound;1000, for the Royal Institution of Great Britain; most were dispersed by sale in the 1960s and 1970s.<br>
<br>The correspondence and some further papers and manuscripts of Morant and Astle descended through the Hills family (Astle's second son, Philip, having taken the name of Hills upon being left an estate in Essex worth &pound;50,000), and were sold by auction, by Puttick and Simpson, on 19 June 1894 (lots 103&#150;14), and by Sothebys, on 25 February 1901 (among lots 752&#150;986 and 998&#150;1121); they are now widely scattered.<br>
