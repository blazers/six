<span class="headword">Ascough,  Jesse</span>  (1823&#150;1897), <span class="occ">borax manufacturer</span>, was born on 6 March 1823 in Coventry, the only son and fifth child of Jesse Ascough (1780&#150;1857), ribbon manufacturer, and his wife, Sarah. He had qualified as a master chemist by the time he married Maria Agnes Fellows (1823&#150;1897), in Wolverhampton, on 21 July 1853. By 1860 the couple had moved to Handsworth, Birmingham. They had three daughters.<br>
<br>While acting as agent for a Liverpool soap manufacturer, Ascough worked at his own inventions and in the 1870s registered a number of patents, including one for a brush which had bristles treated with a compound of sodium borate. This led to Ascough's interest in the commercial possibilities of borax, from which sodium borate was derived, as a cleansing agent in personal hygiene. In 1874 Arthur Robottom, a prospector, bought 120 square miles of borax deposits at Lake Boron, in southern California. The crystals were shipped to Birmingham, where he established the Borax Company in 1876. Robottom voluntarily liquidated the company in July 1878, giving Ascough the opportunity to exploit his abilities. After the latter secured all Robottom's rights, the firm was renamed the Patent Borax Company.<br>
<br>Dry soaps and a variety of toilet preparations, including the &#145;Queen's Starch Glaze&#146;, were subsequently developed, and Ascough proved to be a pioneer in devising colourful, attractive labels for his products, printing many of his advertisements by chromolithography. An astute businessman, he adapted his soaps so as to reach the widest possible market. Aware of the lack of hygiene among the poor, he also had some of the merchandise packed in small but affordable containers to reach the humblest household. He obtained the endorsement of Lillie Langtry for toiletries and anticipated HMV by reproducing a painting of Jupp, his St Bernard dog, on a soap packet. This was painted by a daughter, Jessie, who frequently exhibited at the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists.<br>
<br>By 1892 Ascough had spent more than &pound;125,000 on the production of over a hundred labels and in advertising in more than 3000 newspapers. He vigorously protected his worldwide patents, establishing offices throughout Europe, Asia, Africa, America, and Australia. Within fifteen years, the Patent Borax Company won many international prizes at advertising exhibitions, including a medal from Tasmania in 1893. The demand for the Patent Borax products forced a move to larger premises, covering 2 acres, in Ladywood, Birmingham, into which led an arm of the Birmingham and Wolverhampton Canal. A model factory was built in 1893, with spacious working conditions and with canteen and recreation rooms for the employees, who also received free frequent medical examinations.<br>
<br>Ascough constantly improved his products and he registered his last patent, for an &#145;antiseptic preparation&#146;, less than a year before he died. He was an industrious Victorian entrepreneur, whose facial features resembled those of his dog Jupp, with a heavy, bewhiskered jowl. He was admired by his employees and was concerned for their welfare; and many of the factory workers remained with the company all their working lives. Locally he was liked, not least by those at Handsworth poorhouse, for whom he would carve the joint on Christmas day. Ascough died of pneumonia after a short illness, on 11 April 1897, at his home, The Grange, Laurel Road, Birmingham, where he had lived since 1878; he was buried on 14 April in St Mary's churchyard, Old Handsworth. His wife, who had been in poor health for some years, died three months later. Their grave, surmounted by a massive &#145;angel and child&#146;, is known as &#145;the Ascough memorial&#146;.<br>
<br>Jesse Ascough lived to see his Patent Borax products become internationally known and would have been delighted by the remark of a character in No&euml;l Coward's <span class="italic">Private Lives</span> (1930), who stated, &#145;I love borax&#146;. The company was appointed borax makers to Queen Victoria in August 1897, and was granted the royal warrant, held until the death of George V, in 1936.<br>
