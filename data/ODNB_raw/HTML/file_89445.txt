<span class="headword">Moiseiwitsch,  Tatiana Benita <span class="st"> [Tanya]</span></span>  (1914&#150;2003), <span class="occ">theatre designer</span>, was born on 3 December 1914 at The Grange, Church Road, Barnes, Surrey, the elder child of the Odessa-born pianist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76129/', "Benno Moiseiwitsch (1890&#150;1963)")</script> and his wife, the Australian violinist Daisy Fowler, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kennedy. Her sister, Sandra, was seven years her junior. Her parents divorced in 1924, and her mother married the poet, playwright, actor, and producer John Drinkwater, with whom she had another daughter. Moiseiwitsch learned of her father's remarriage through the pages of the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span>, and later gained a stepbrother through this union.<br>
<br>By the time she was six Moiseiwitsch had travelled to Australia and America, and in London her family's itinerant life meant that she attended a succession of private schools. Even before her parents' divorce, the demands of her father's international concert tours meant he was absent for long periods. The household was highly disciplined, with both parents assiduously following her progress on the Irish harp and piano. She &#145;shook like a jelly&#146;  (interview, BL NSA) when she had to play for her father and never forgot the occasion when, having listened intently to her recital, he embraced her warmly with the words, &#145;And that wasn't for your playing, darling&#146;  (ibid.). Her short-lived hopes of a career as a dancer were similarly disappointed. It was Drinkwater who suggested she enrol at the Central School of Arts and Crafts, where Jeanetta Cochrane and Ruth Keating were influential teachers and courses included costume history. Her mother and stepfather were friends of Lilian Baylis and, while sitting with them in the stalls at the Old Vic, Moiseiwitsch was plucked out by Baylis and asked if she would like to make hats at Sadler's Wells for a production designed by Madam Polunin. Thrown in at the deep end, she recalled, &#145;I realised you don't say you've never made a hat in your life. You ask, and you just do it. After I'd made one, she said, &#147;Well, now. We need eight&#148;&#146;  (interview, BL NSA). Her down-to-earth approach never left her. She spent a year at the Old Vic, making props and masks, painting scenery, and assisting in the wardrobe department.<br>
<br>When Keating was appointed designer for Hugh Hunt at the Westminster Theatre, Moiseiwitsch became her assistant, and it was there, in 1934, that she made her d&eacute;but as a professional designer. The following year Hunt invited her to work with him at the Abbey Theatre, Dublin. Nominally on a three-month trial period, she never lost the feeling that she might be asked to leave at any moment, despite designing over fifty productions during her three years at the Abbey. Yeats was a commanding presence: he would eat in total silence before rising with the words, &#145;I will now taking my chilling presence away&#146;  (BL NSA), and Moiseiwitsch was instructed that he must always be allowed to win at croquet. The period with Hunt established the director&#150;designer relationship with which she was most comfortable: &#145;What I did learn was to trust a director to know what he wanted and to try and give him what he wanted&#146;  (ibid.). A true collaborator, not the least of her talents lay in translating the often scant and impressionistic indications given by directors into three-dimensional sets and production styles. A keen researcher, she brought intelligence, invention, and dedication to the relationship, cloaking her immensely supportive qualities and flair with modesty and generosity, happy to leave others in the limelight. As Frith Banbury remembered from his later experience of working with her in London and New York on <span class="italic">The Deep Blue Sea</span> and <span class="italic">The Holly and the Ivy</span>, &#145;Your opinion was asked all along the line and followed. It was marvellous working with her&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>During the Second World War Moiseiwitsch honed her skills in London's West End and at the Q Theatre before moving to the Oxford Playhouse. On 19 December 1942 she married Felix Maurice Krish (1916&#150;1943), an actor then serving as a pilot officer in the RAF Volunteer Reserve. His death in a plane crash less than two months after their wedding was a devastating blow. She never remarried.<br>
<br>Moiseiwitsch embarked on the professional relationship which was to define her career when, in 1944, she accepted an invitation from the director Tyrone Guthrie to join the Liverpool Playhouse, where the Old Vic Company was temporarily based. Back in London they collaborated on, among other productions, the celebrated <span class="italic">Cyrano de Bergerac</span> (1946) starring Ralph Richardson, and (less successfully) <span class="italic">Peter Grimes</span> for the Royal Opera House (1947). At the Memorial Theatre, Stratford upon Avon, in 1950 Moiseiwitsch created a single wooden set for Guthrie's <span class="italic">Henry VIII</span>, with costumes richly inspired by Holbein, and when Guthrie staged a ground-breaking cycle of four of the histories in 1951 she gave him a permanent set which could be used for all the plays, freeing the action from cumbersome scene changes and encouraging the eye to focus on the actors' bodies, on carefully constructed essential props, and on the rich textures and colours of her textiles.<br>
<br>It was Moiseiwitsch who helped Guthrie realize his dream of liberating Shakespeare from the proscenium arch when in 1953, in a temporary tent structure, they created a thrust stage for the Festival Theatre, Stratford, Ontario, fundamentally altering the relationship between stage and audience and revolutionizing contemporary thought about the staging of the classics. Rooted in an understanding of how Shakespeare's plays might first have been performed, the solution Moiseiwitsch devised was nevertheless entirely modern and quickly proved itself adaptable to productions set in a wide range of periods. A permanent building on the same principles replaced the tent, and she returned regularly to work in Ontario. She and Guthrie developed their ideas further with the asymmetrical open stage at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis in 1963, where Moiseiwitsch stayed as principal designer until 1966. It was for this space that she designed her acclaimed <span class="italic">House of Atreus</span> (1967)&#151;described by <span class="italic">Newsweek</span> as &#145;awesome and timeless&#146;&#151;presenting the actors with masks one and a half times human size, enlarged hands, and heightened shoes.<br>
<br>Moiseiwitsch's career spanned half a century and took her to many countries. For Nick Thompson, architect of the Sheffield Crucible, who worked with her when she was consultant designer (1970&#150;71) on the building, she was &#145;My guru. I trusted her implicitly&#146;  (private information). Although she was sometimes wrongly credited with having influenced the design of the Chichester Festival Theatre, she was in fact highly critical of its auditorium. She sat on the building committee for the National Theatre, where in 1978 she designed <span class="italic">The Double Dealer</span> for the Olivier. In the 1970s she worked several times with John Dexter, both for the National Theatre company and at the Metropolitan Opera, New York. She was appointed CBE in 1976. Her last production was <span class="italic">The Government Inspector</span> in 1985 at Stratford, Ontario.<br>
<br>Describing her as &#145;a romantic firmly grounded in the classics&#146;, the novelist Robertson Davies, later a close friend, never forgot his first glimpse of the young Moiseiwitsch and &#145;the fixity and solemnity of her expression &hellip; Amazing also because of the beauty of her eyes, large and dark like those one sees in Russian icons&#146;  (Edelstein, 3). Moiseiwitsch had an unusual, heart-shaped face and was physically an unimposing figure yet capable of firmness when required. She relished human foible. Her last home was in Kensington, London, where she lived surrounded by many close friends. In 1994 a touring retrospective exhibition about her work was initiated at the University of Chicago. She died at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London, of breast cancer, on 19 February 2003.<br>
