<span class="headword">Thomas,  John</span>  (1696&#150;1781), <span class="occ">bishop of Winchester</span>, was born on 17 August 1696 at Westminster, the son of Stremer Thomas, a colonel in the guards, and his wife, Hester. He was educated at Charterhouse School, matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, on 28 March 1713, and graduated BA in 1716 before proceeding MA in 1719, BD in 1727 and DD in 1731.<br>
<br>In 1720 Thomas was elected fellow of All Souls College; disappointed of church preferment through a friend of his father, he took another route to promotion by establishing a reputation as a London preacher. He began as a curate and became a prebendary of St Paul's in 1731. Two years later he married Susan (<i>d</i>. 1778), daughter of Thomas Mulso of Twywell, Northamptonshire, and they had three daughters. Thomas gave up his All Souls fellowship on marriage, and in the same year was presented by the dean and chapter of St Paul's to the rectory of St Benet Paul's Wharf, a living he retained until 1757; in 1742 he obtained a canonry at St Paul's, which he held until 1748. More importantly he had won the favour of the prince of Wales, and, after the latter was crowned George II, Thomas became one of his chaplains. In 1742 he gave the Boyle lectures, but, as became his wont, did not publish them. He received his reward, however, in the bishopric of Peterborough to which he was consecrated on 4 October 1747.<br>
<br>The peak of Thomas's public career came in 1752 when he was appointed to succeed Thomas Hayter, bishop of Norwich, as preceptor to the young prince of Wales, who was to ascend the throne in 1760. The untimely death of Frederick, the prince's father, from a blow from a tennis ball in 1751, had given a sudden urgency to George's education, and to fears of the influence of his mother. Thomas came in as preceptor under Lord Waldegrave as governor, with George Scott, later a commissioner of excise, as sub-preceptor. The sudden shift in the reversionary interest guaranteed animosity against those in charge of the young prince; but while George III in later life charitably recalled Thomas and Scott &#145;as men of unexceptionable characters&#146; as distinct from &#145;Dr Hayter &hellip; an intriguing, unworthy man, more fitted to be a Jesuit than an English bishop&#146;, Waldegrave set them down as &#145;men of sense, men of learning, and worthy good men, [who] &hellip; had but little weight and influence&#146; and were no match for the dowager princess  (<span class="italic">Memoirs and Speeches</span>, 52). Thomas nevertheless had his reward; in a great reshuffle of the bench contrived by George II in 1757, he succeeded John Gilbert as bishop of Salisbury and clerk of the closet (the duke of Newcastle had intended him for York). From George III, Thomas received the succession to the notorious Benjamin Hoadly as bishop of Winchester in 1761, and remained fulsome in his expressions of gratitude for royal favour.<br>
<br>Thomas left almost as little trace of his activities as bishop as of his pulpit eloquence. Hurd made a snide remark about his patronage. His one visitation of the see of Winchester was the best designed of the eighteenth century, but was treated by many of the clergy with the same casualness as the replies were preserved by the bishop. He did nothing to redress the administrative laxity in his see which went back to the seventeenth century and had become deeply rooted in the time of his predecessor. Thomas died at his home, Winchester House, Chelsea, on 1 May 1781, and was buried in Winchester Cathedral. His wife died on 19 November 1778.<br>
