<span class="headword">Pierrepont,  Evelyn</span>, second duke of Kingston upon Hull  (1712&#150;1773), <span class="occ">landowner</span>, was born on 3 April 1712, probably in London, the only son of the two children of William Pierrepont, earl of Kingston (1692&#150;1713), and his wife, Rachel (<i>bap</i>. 1695, <i>d</i>. 1722), the daughter of Thomas Baynton of Little Chalfield, Wiltshire. He succeeded his grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22227/', "Evelyn Pierrepont, first duke of Kingston")</script>, on 5 March 1726. Known as the marquess of Dorchester from 1715, in 1725 he was inoculated against smallpox (from which his father had died) under the supervision of his aunt Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. She described his early education as deplorable, but he was at Eton College by 1725, and after succeeding to the dukedom was sent on the grand tour from 1726. His travels lasted ten years and gave him a scandalous reputation, along with a love of gambling, sport, and French tastes. He came of age in 1733, when he assumed control of his estates from three trustees. These included Thoresby Park and Holme Pierrepont Hall in Nottinghamshire, his principal residences, as well as property in Derbyshire, Somerset, Buckinghamshire, Wiltshire, Lincolnshire, Yorkshire, and Shropshire. The estates had been well managed during his minority, but Kingston cast aside prudence and used them to extend the extravagant lifestyle he enjoyed on the continent. By 1745 his debts exceeded &pound;66,000, four times his income.<br>
<br>Kingston returned from France in autumn 1736 with his mistress, Marie-Th&eacute;r&egrave;se de Fontaine de la Touche, who had been married for ten years and had three children when she met him. The relationship endured for about fourteen years; by 1741 de la Touche had been naturalized as a British subject and become a member of the Church of England, demonstrating the apparent permanence of the affair. However, it was not an exclusive one. In March 1737 Kingston was reported in Paris with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28084/', "Frances Anne Vane, Viscountess Vane")</script>, as his lover.<br>
<br>Kingston took little part in political or state activities. Installed as a knight of the Garter in 1741, he modestly folded back the front of his coat to hide the star. In the same year he became a lord of the bedchamber to George II, but by August 1742 he was begging to be allowed to resign on the grounds of ill health. His political correspondence consists mainly of deferential letters to the duke of Newcastle, from whom he frequently asked favours for friends and relations. He was consulted about Nottinghamshire parliamentary candidates but took little initiative in their selection. He is not recorded as speaking in the House of Lords, though he bore the staff of St Edward at George III's coronation in 1761.<br>
<br>However, he did collect a series of local offices appropriate to his rank. He became master of the staghounds north of the Trent in 1738, and served as head ranger of Sherwood Forest under Newcastle's stewardship. After the latter's dismissal he became lord lieutenant of Nottinghamshire and was steward of Sherwood Forest between 1763 and 1765. Following Newcastle's death in 1768 he was recorder of Nottingham from 1769.<br>
<br>The Jacobite rising of 1745 revealed that Kingston could be a man of action. Newcastle charged him with the preparation of Nottingham in case of a siege, and he raised a regiment of light cavalry, contributing &pound;1000 to the costs. Under his colonelcy his troops saw action at Culloden in 1746 and were subsequently involved in the seizure of cattle &#145;after having burnt every house they could find&#146;  (<span class="italic">Rutland MSS</span>, 2.199). Kingston became major-general in 1753, lieutenant-general in 1759, and general in 1772.<br>
<br>In April 1745 the hall at Thoresby Park was largely destroyed by fire, but most of Kingston's best furniture was saved along with essential estate papers. A new house, designed by John Carr of York, was built between 1767 and 1771 at a cost of &pound;17,000. The offices and contents brought the total to &pound;34,000. Thoresby Park was noted for the duke's venison, fishing, racehorses, lake, and boats.<br>
<br>Kingston's relationship with Marie-Th&eacute;r&egrave;se de la Touche ended about 1750 when he fell in love with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5380/', "Elizabeth Chudleigh (c.1720&#150;1788)")</script>, the notorious society figure who became his mistress. He, and the world at large, were unaware that Chudleigh had secretly married Augustus John Hervey, later third earl of Bristol, in 1744. Following a court case in which Hervey's claims to be married to Chudleigh were rejected, on 8 March 1769 Kingston married Chudleigh, either at St Margaret's, Westminster, or at his London home in Arlington Street. His valet claimed that he never enjoyed a week's happiness again.<br>
<br>Kingston died at his house in Bath on 23 September 1773, either from palsy or a paralytic stroke, and after an impressive funeral he was buried on 19 October at Holme Pierrepont, Nottinghamshire. The duke was summed up by Horace Walpole as a very weak man, but of the greatest beauty and the finest person in England. His titles became extinct, but the estates were left to the duchess of Kingston for her lifetime, as long as she remained a widow, and then to Charles, the younger son of Kingston's sister, Frances Medows. The House of Lords judged the duchess guilty of bigamy in April 1776, but Kingston's elder nephew Evelyn Medows failed in his attempt to use this ruling to overturn the will in his favour. The estates, as Kingston intended, were eventually inherited in 1788 by Charles Medows, who changed his name to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39303/', "Charles Pierrepont")</script>.<br>
