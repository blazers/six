<span class="headword">Beato,  Felice</span>  (<em>c.</em>1825&#150;<em>c.</em>1907), <span class="occ">photographer</span>, was, according to most biographies, born in Venice in 1830 and later became a naturalized British subject. However, little is known of his early life. Although he was undoubtedly of Italian ancestry, it is likely that he and his brother Antonio were born in Corfu about 1825. In the early part of the nineteenth century Corfu was a Venetian colony, but in 1814 it came under British rule; children born there could be registered as British subjects.<br>
<br>Beato is acknowledged to be the first photographer to specialize in war photography. He learned photography from his brother-in-law, James Robertson, who married Beato's sister in 1855. Robertson, a native of Britain who was appointed chief engraver of the mint in Constantinople in the 1840s, took up photography professionally in the early 1850s, travelling to the Crimea in 1855 to photograph the war between Britain and Russia. It is not clear whether Beato accompanied him at this time; however, a year later he was sent there by Robertson to photograph the aftermath of the war. At a time when most professional photographers employed the cumbersome wet-plate negative process, Robertson and Beato utilized a secret (and much simpler) dry-plate process which made battlefield photography practical.<br>
<br>In 1856 and 1857 Robertson and Beato travelled around the Mediterranean, photographing the sights at Constantinople, Malta, Egypt, and the Holy Land. In 1857 they established a formal partnership in Malta selling photographs to tourists. However, the partnership was short-lived for, when news of the Indian mutiny reached Malta, Beato set off for Calcutta. British policy had forbidden the photographing of dead bodies in the Crimea, but the prohibition did not apply to India. When Beato arrived in Lucknow in the summer of 1858, he was disappointed to discover that he had arrived too late to photograph the actual massacre of the rebels; undeterred, he had the skeletons of the rebels exhumed and scattered around the courtyard of the <i>sikandarabagh</i> to create one of his most dramatic photographs. Beato stayed in India, acting as a semi-official photographer for the army for the next two years, but a new war was in the wind.<br>
<br>In 1858 China took steps to end the British importation of Indian opium into their country; the British retaliated by occupying Canton (Guangzhou) and sinking a major part of the Chinese navy. Following their initial success, the British navy next attacked the Taku (Dagu) Fort complex guarding the river access to Peking (Beijing); here they were beaten off with heavy losses. The British response was to assemble an expeditionary force to invade China. Beato travelled with this army to Kowloon and Canton in the spring of 1860 and remained with it throughout the campaign. In August the army successfully stormed the Taku forts: in the heat of battle Beato followed the troops through the breach in the walls, imploring them not to touch the bodies until he had taken his pictures. He travelled with the army to Peking, where he was able to photograph the Summer Palace complex before it was looted and burned by British troops in retaliation for the torture and killing of allied prisoners. His approximately one hundred large-format photographs constitute the first and only major surviving images of China before the 1870s.<br>
<br>After a brief trip to London, Beato returned to the Far East and settled in Yokohama for the next twenty years. This was the most prolific period of his career: he produced several hundred images in Japan encompassing landscape, architecture, and ethnography. He is considered the father of Japanese photography, his work the only comprehensive view remaining of the country's life and culture during the 1860s. In 1864 he joined the British forces for the Shimonoseki military expedition in Japan; in 1871 he was appointed the official photographer for the United States Navy during the attack on Korea. He also claimed to have photographed the Mahdist rebellion against the British in the Sudan in 1884, but so far no surviving images of this work have been found. In the 1870s Beato turned away from photography to become a merchant, but in the 1880s he lost all his money speculating in the Yokohama silver exchange. His friends raised the money for his passage to London. In 1889 he settled in Mandalay, Burma, and opened up a photographic studio; he appears to have operated a mail-order export business, dealing in local arts and crafts on the side. He died in Burma about 1907. The most comprehensive collections of his photographs in Britain are in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, and the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television, Bradford (including the collection of the Royal Photographic Society).<br>
