<div class="para">
<span class="headword">McLachlan,  Laurentia Margaret</span>  (1866&#150;1953), <span class="occ">abbess of Stanbrook and scholar</span>, was born on 11 January 1866 at Coatbridge, Lanarkshire, and baptized Margaret at St Margaret's Church, Airdrie, the youngest of the seven children of Henry McLachlan (1828&#150;1890), accountant, and his wife, Mary McAleese (1828&#150;1900). From her father, a highlander, and a Huguenot born grandmother, McLachlan inherited French wit and charm; from her Irish mother, practicality and an ability to organize. These traits fused and developed into the extraordinary capacity for friendship and government she was to show as nun and abbess, inviting comparison with the twelfth-century Cistercian abbot, Ailred of Rievaulx, on the eve of whose feast she had been born. Like Ailred, Margaret did not enjoy robust health. Frail as a child (her father nicknamed her Bodle after the Scottish coin worth less than a ha'penny), her formal education was intermittent: spells at a dame-school in Coatbridge, and convent schools in Bothwell and Edinburgh comprised her primary schooling, while her secondary education was almost entirely at home directed by her clerical brother, James. Hers was not, however, an overly pious upbringing&#151;she later described herself in a letter to Sydney Cockerell as &#145;terribly fond of pleasure&#146;  (<span class="italic">In a Great Tradition</span>, 93) and, at the time of starting school at Stanbrook Abbey, near Worcester, on 6 September 1881, a &#145;hater of nuns&#146;  (ibid., 81). Exactly four years later she became a nun of that same Stanbrook Abbey, an enclosed Benedictine community where she would spend the next seventy years. The reasons for such a volte-face are not clear. &#145;The why is God's secret&#146;, she wrote in <span class="italic">Ad quid venisti</span>, her 1934 pamphlet on vocation. Her mother excepted, the family initially resented the decision from which, she said, her father never fully recovered. But there was no estrangement. She had entered the noviciate on 2 February 1884, receiving the name Laurentia after the martyr St Laurence and, more proximately, Father Laurence Shepherd, Ampleforth monk and from 1863 to 1885 chaplain and great benefactor of Stanbrook.<br>
<br>Interest in Gregorian chant sown in childhood, given impetus on a visit to the French Benedictine abbey of Solesmes in 1883, and nurtured in the daily singing of the divine office, flowered by 1914 when Dame Laurentia was widely acknowledged as the foremost authority on plainsong in English speaking countries. Organist from 1892 and precentress from 1893, she had caught the tide of nineteenth-century liturgical revival spearheaded at Solesmes and projected to Stanbrook by Laurence Shepherd, and became, herself, instrumental in that revival. In 1890 she had been asked to visit the nuns at Princethorpe Priory, the first of five such missions to foster the singing of plainsong. In touch with leading figures in plainsong such as Dom Mocquereau (Solesmes), she maintained an independent, pragmatic approach, detached from the musical controversies of the day. Her first published work, <span class="italic">Gregorian music, an outline of musical palaeography illustrated by facsimiles of ancient manuscripts</span> (1897) by the Benedictines of Stanbrook, is far more than an epitome of Dom Mocquereau's work in the volumes of <span class="italic">Pal&eacute;ographie musicale</span>, the material restructured to suit the English temperament. In 1899 she began research on the thirteenth-century Worcester antiphoner, later published as the introduction to volume 12 of the <span class="italic">Pal&eacute;ographie musicale</span> (1922&#150;5). Of more widespread influence was <span class="italic">A Grammar of Plainsong</span> (1905), written to implement Pius X's 1903 <span class="italic">Motu proprio</span> on church music. Translated into French, German, and Italian and running to four editions, the <span class="italic">Grammar</span> was prefaced by an autograph letter from Pius X in recognition of Stanbrook's work for the restoration of the chant. That work permeated to grassroots through <span class="italic">Plainsong for Schools</span> (1930). In 1927 Dame Laurentia was elected a vice-president of the Plainsong and Mediaeval Music Society and, from its inception in 1929, supported the Society of St Gregory, being listed among their patrons in 1937. However, the crowning achievement had come on 6 September 1934 when she was awarded the <i>bene merenti</i> by Pius XI for her work in church music.<br>
<br>Historical scholarship was an early interest: Dame Laurentia published <span class="italic">St Egwin and his Abbey of Evesham</span> (1904); <span class="italic">Stanbrook Abbey: a Sketch of its History, 1625&#150;1925</span> (1925) and, in 1929, contributed an article to the <span class="italic">Journal of Theological Studies</span> (30, 174&#150;6) on St Wulfstan's prayerbook. Such study grew alongside liturgical work, for which she often consulted original manuscripts, lent to Stanbrook through the good offices of friends like Canon Wilson, librarian of Worcester Cathedral, and Sir Sydney Cockerell, director of the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge. She brought to their study discipline, liturgical knowledge, and a certain monastic insight. From the rubrics in the Worcester antiphoner, she was able to reconstruct details of the medieval cathedral later confirmed by archaeology. To the six articles on medieval and musical subjects she published between 1904 and 1937 should be added the significant identification of an eighth-century fragment in Worcester Cathedral Library as the earliest manuscript of Paterius's <span class="italic">De expositione novi et veteris testamenti</span>.<br>
<br>The demands of the abbatial office, to which Dame Laurentia was elected on 24 November 1931, left little time for study; even so, in 1933 she became first woman vice-president of the Henry Bradshaw Society (founded in 1890 to edit rare liturgical texts) and helped produce two volumes for their proceedings in 1936 and 1937, her final contribution in this field&#151;a contribution none the less sufficient to elicit from Francis Wormald the encomium, &#145;a true daughter of St Benedict and Dom Jean Mabillon&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 24 Aug 1953).<br>
<br>There was little surprise at Dame Laurentia's being chosen abbess (she had been subprioress 1910&#150;25 and prioress 1925&#150;31), despite advanced years and increasing frailty. Some hold that such drawbacks, on the material plane, lent to her abbacy a deep spirit of trust, on her part, and an equally profound response of love from the community. In 1931 she was involved in reformulating the constitutions of the nuns of the English Benedictine congregation, while at Stanbrook she encouraged flexibility and personal initiative and recognized the need for leisure, allocating free time and an outdoor recreation area. To qualities of leadership she added those powers of sympathy and affection which had gained her a wide circle of friends, making her accessible to even the youngest sister. She is remembered giving correction with a twinkle in the grey-green eyes! Her last publications, six treatises based on conferences given to the nuns, bear witness to her spiritual wisdom. At her death, on 23 August 1953 in the abbey, she left a community remarkable for its unity and diversity&#151;a final echo of Ailred's Rievaulx and testament to her own influence.<br>
<br>That influence has extended through the story of her friendships with Sir Sydney Cockerell and George Bernard Shaw, told in <span class="italic">In a Great Tradition</span> (1956) by the Benedictines of Stanbrook, revised as <span class="italic">The Nun, the Infidel and the Superman</span> by Dame Felicitas Corrigan (1985), reprinted in 1990 as <span class="italic">Friends of a Lifetime</span>. Since 1988 she has been even more widely known through Hugh Whitemore's play, <span class="italic">The Best of Friends</span>, which, after a long West End run and national tour, enjoyed phenomenal success into the 1990s, touring eleven countries on four continents. The televising of the play brought the enclosed figure of Dame Laurentia into millions of homes. Such popularity suggests a shift in perception of her place in the national memory. Research on the chant has progressed and Dame Laurentia's contribution, historically significant as it will remain, plays little part in her enduring appeal. This lies rather in the &#145;enclosed nun with the unenclosed mind&#146;, as George Bernard Shaw described her  (Corrigan, <span class="italic">Friends of a Lifetime</span>, 8), whose greatness of personality matched the stature of the medieval abbesses described by Bede. She was buried on 26 August 1953 at Stanbrook Abbey.<br>
