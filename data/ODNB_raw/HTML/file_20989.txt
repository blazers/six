<span class="headword">Owen,  David</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1623), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious controversialist</span>, was born on the Isle of Anglesey. Rector of Yardley Hastings, Northamptonshire, from 3 November 1598, and vicar of neighbouring Preston Deanery from the same year, it was not until early 1599 that he graduated BA from St Catharine's College, Cambridge. He then became a fellow of Clare College, but his tenure may have been brief since on 17 June 1600, at All Saints', Northampton, he married Elizabeth Knight (<i>d</i>. 1617) of Geyding. He returned to Cambridge and proceeded MA from Clare in 1602 and BD in 1609, having been incorporated MA from Oxford on 14 June 1608. The possibility of some period of residence in the university is suggested by the fact that his two children, Mary and John, were baptized there respectively on 10 July 1608 and 31 March 1611; the latter was buried at Yardley Hastings on 6 July 1611.<br>
<br>At some point in the first decade of the seventeenth century Owen became part of a proto-Arminian grouping within the diocese of Peterborough, and served under Thomas Dove (bishop from 1601) and John Buckeridge (archdeacon from 1604) as a church court official. Closely identified with Dove's vigorous drive against nonconformity, Owen presented his own curate, Thomas Randleson, for preaching false doctrine, on the ground that Randleson had asserted that &#145;though baptism was necessary yet it was not necessary unto salvation, that they were popish preachers that taught that children were not ordinarily saved without baptism&#146;  (Fielding, 97).<br>
<br>On 1 May 1610 Owen completed a manuscript tract, &#145;The power of princes and the dutie of subjectes according to the scripture and the judgement of the auncient fathers for an antidote against the poyson of the late and lewde doctrine of papistes &amp; puritanes&#146; (BL, Royal MS 18 B v). At first sight this appears to be a standard contribution to the continuing debates over the oath of allegiance. Owen claimed to attack both the puritan church polity that had grown up at Geneva since 1536 and the Jesuits, whom he dated to 1537 at Rome. He roundly disputed the three presuppositions of Robert Bellarmine and the Romanists: that the pope had absolute power over all; that although the pope had no absolute power over kings directly, yet he had supreme authority to dispose of the temporalities of all Christians; and that the pope could excommunicate kings. However, the context of the tract suggests that there was more to it than met the eye. Owen was chaplain to John Ramsay, Viscount Haddington. In 1609&#150;10 court voices (including that of Bishop Lancelot Andrewes) were raised against the manner in which the king and his agent, Haddington, had quashed the Gowrie conspiracy of 1600. Topical in its implicit endorsement of the king's right to sanction extreme measures against Roman Catholic conspirators, it is likely Owen's piece was read at court. Published later in 1610, as <span class="italic">Herod and Pilate Reconciled</span>, at Cambridge, the printed version follows the manuscript text with a few minor corrections. These are in the concluding chapter, &#145;Puritan-Jesuitisme&#146;, which lists the &#145;generall consent of the principall Puritans and Jesuits against Kings, from the year 1536 untill the year 1602&#146;  (pp. 47&#150;53), among them John Knox, George Buchanan, Theodore Beza, Thomas Cartwright, Robert Rollock, and William Bucanus. The work retained its topicality, being republished in 1642, 1643, 1652, and 1663. A Dutch translation was published in 1660 by Johann Utenbogaert.<br>
<br>On 14 January 1614, in succession to Robert Catelin, &#145;a key figure in the local puritan campaign&#146;  (Fielding, 97), and presumably in a move to rein in the town's notorious nonconformity, Owen became vicar of All Saints', Northampton. He resigned in 1616, having in the meantime retained Yardley Hastings, where his wife was buried on 20 May 1617. Within the next three years he married another Elizabeth, whose other name is unknown; a daughter, Jane, was baptized on 13 May 1620. In 1618 he obtained his DD degree (incorporated at Oxford in July) from Cambridge; while there he is credited with having informed on Ralph Brownrigg for discussing, in his private rooms at Pembroke College, whether kings might be deposed for breaking fundamental laws. On 19 April 1619 he took part in a disputation in the Cambridge divinity schools in which he denounced the teachings on <span class="roman">Romans</span> 13 of the Heidelberg-based David Pareus, and defended the divine right of kings.<br>
<br>In July 1621 Owen sent to his patron, newly created earl of Holdernesse, a belated response to a papist tract of 1619, &#145;God and the king, against God and the king&#146;. Yielding to the persuasion of friends he had produced a &#145;plain and full answer&#146; over a six-week period; &#145;Detectio calumniarum, sophismatum, et impostuarum anonymi papistae&#146; (BL, Royal MS 10 B xiii, fol. 2<i>r</i>) was never published, presumably because events elsewhere came to overshadow it. As a result of the furore caused at Oxford and at court by a university sermon of 14 April 1622, in which one John Knight had not only offered a thorough defence of Pareus and his sanction of resistance by an inferior magistrate to his sovereign in matters of religion, but also specifically instanced the interference of James I in supporting the French Huguenots, an Oxford disputation was staged on 25 June to denounce Pareus and uphold royal authority. On 12 August the &#145;Directions to preachers&#146; were issued, and later that month Owen's 1619 Latin disputation was rushed into print. Published as <span class="italic">Anti-Pareus, sive, Determinatio de jure regio</span> and dedicated on 31 August to the king, it attacked both papists and &#145;disciplinarians&#146; for controverting royal authority. Conventionally, Owen saw the king as father of his country, and he conceded that &#145;subjects ought not to obey in those cases where the Prince commands against God&#146;  (Sommerville, 34), but he spelt out more explicitly than many the extent to which royal power was subject to no human authority. The volume concluded by quoting <span class="roman">1 Peter</span> 2: 17, &#145;Fear God, honour the king&#146;, in Welsh.<br>
<br>On 2 October 1622 Owen gained the vicarage of St Sepulchre, Northampton, but he died on 23 July 1623, and was buried at Yardley Hastings church on 25 July. His will, dated 21 July, divided his property between his wife and daughters, and was proved by his widow on 29 July. Twenty years later Robert Mossom, then an army chaplain and later bishop of Derry, published in York a translation of <span class="italic">Anti-Pareus</span> as a means of rallying royalists to the flag and of cautioning those who would offer resistance to the crown. In the preface to <span class="italic">Anti-Pareus, or, A Treatise in the Defence of the Royall Right of Kings</span> (1643) he saluted Owen as a &#145;man of so much piety as to write nothing but what his conscience told him was the Truth; and of so much Learning as to maintaine the Truth he writ&#146;  (p. A3*).<br>
