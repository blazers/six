<span class="headword">Buchanan,  Robert Ogilvie</span>  (1894&#150;1980), <span class="occ">geographer</span>, was born at Maheno, Otago, New Zealand, on 12 September 1894. His father, Duncan Buchanan, of Scottish origin, was an engine driver at the time of his marriage in Dunedin in 1887, but he then took his bride, Janet, to Maheno and farmed there. About 1898 they moved to Tapanui, West Otago, where Janet's brothers, who had accompanied pedigree sheep from Scotland, had settled. Buchanan started school in Tapanui in 1899, progressing, when fifteen, to the Otago Boys' High School. At the University of Otago, Dunedin, he studied history and economics but, after two years, during the First World War, enlisted in the 2nd Otago regiment and served with New Zealand forces in the Middle East and France. He was badly wounded in France in 1917 and in hospital for almost a year. He returned home in 1919, took his BA degree, and taught for a year at Whangarei, before returning to Dunedin for his MA honours degree in economics, which he received in 1921. He developed a strong interest in rugby football and a reputation as a coach.<br>
<br>A period as a schoolmaster at Mount Albert Grammar School, Auckland, from 1922 to 1925, brought Buchanan the opportunity to teach geography, a new subject. His interest led him to apply to the London School of Economics (LSE) to study geography for the BSc (Econ) degree. He obtained a first-class degree in 1927, then spent a further year as a research student supervised by Llewellyn Rodwell Jones. In 1928 he became an assistant lecturer in the subject at University College, London, under C. B. Fawcett, whom he admired. He became a lecturer in 1930. He married Kathleen Mary (Kay) Parnell (1900&#150;1990), daughter of Alexander James Parnell, merchant, at St Paul's Presbyterian Church, Croydon, on 18 July 1931. It was a happy marriage, and they had a son (Colin Buchanan, later bishop of Aston and of Woolwich) and two daughters.<br>
<br>Buchanan (who wrote as R. Ogilvie Buchanan) brought together his knowledge of economics and trade and his interest in the changing regional specialization of agriculture in <span class="italic">The Pastoral Industries of New Zealand</span>, an analytical study based on his PhD thesis of 1932. This was published as the first volume of the <span class="italic">Transactions and Papers of the Institute of British Geographers</span> (1935). He gave great energy to the development of the Institute of British Geographers, of which he was honorary secretary and treasurer (1939&#150;50) and president (1953). He was remembered as a trusted and inspiring leader. <span class="italic">An Economic Geography of the British Empire</span> appeared in 1936. Promotion to a readership came in 1938. War service during the Second World War, first as an RAF corporal in charge of a barrage balloon site near London and later as a squadron leader in charge of maps serving the Royal Air Force, again interrupted his academic career.<br>
<br>Buchanan's appointment as professor of geography at the London School of Economics in 1949 came at a crucial time, when L. Dudley Stamp was involved in international work and new regulations for the BSc (Econ) degree required a reorganization of teaching. Buchanan successfully found new colleagues and the department ran smoothly. Students enjoyed his informal, crisp, and conversational style of lecturing. He contributed substantially to the organization of the University of London as a member of senate (1951&#150;67), chairman of the academic council, and deputy vice-chancellor. The University of London's Institute of Education valued his membership of its management committee so highly that it named its chair of geography in his honour. He was a member of the delegacy of Goldsmiths' College, London, from 1954 until his death, &#145;readily identified by his merry smile and twinkling eyes and his broad brimmed hat&#146;  (Firth, 128); a portrait by John Mansbridge hangs there. He was an ideal choice as honorary treasurer of the Association of Commonwealth Universities (1961&#150;7), a member of the Nature Conservancy (1965&#150;71), and chairman of the Association of Agriculture (1964&#150;72). Contributions to the economic geography of agriculture, trade, air transport, and his home country continued to appear. <span class="italic">Industrial Activity and Economic Geography</span> (written jointly with R. C. Estall) was published in 1961, went through four editions, and was translated into many languages. His role as editor of Bell's long running series of <span class="roman">Advanced Economic Geographies</span> opened doors to younger colleagues to present their work to a wide audience. He was a meticulous research supervisor. Long after formal retirement in 1961 he went regularly to London School of Economics to edit and advise.<br>
<br>Buchanan's work was recognized by election to the presidency of section E of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (1952), the Institute of British Geographers (1954), and the Geographical Association (1958). The Royal Geographical Society elected him to honorary fellowship in 1966, as did the London School of Economics in 1970. He died at Queen Mary's Hospital, Roehampton, on 9 July 1980 after a stroke, and a memorial service was held at St Mary-le-Strand Church, London, on 9 October 1980. A book compiled in his honour, <span class="italic">R. O. Buchanan and Economic Geography</span>, appeared in 1973.<br>
