<span class="headword">Arnold,  William Delafield</span>  (1828&#150;1859), <span class="occ">army officer and novelist</span>, was born at Laleham, Middlesex, on 7 April 1828, the fourth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/686/', "Thomas Arnold (1795&#150;1842)")</script>, headmaster of Rugby School, and his wife, Mary (1791&#150;1873), daughter of the Revd John Penrose. He was educated at Rugby School and spent a year at Christ Church, Oxford, before proceeding to India in February 1848 as an ensign in the 39th Bengal native infantry. In December 1848 he was transferred to the 58th native infantry and served with its reserve division at Jagraon during the Second Anglo-Sikh War. Like his father he was an earnest liberal churchman but, unlike his father, beset by doubts. He thought only two professions untainted by worldliness&#151;holy orders and teaching&#151;but feared that he was fitted for neither. He languished in the army, homesick and lonely, until his marriage on 3 April 1850 to Frances Anne 
    (Fanny; 1824&#150;1858)
  , daughter of Major-General John Anthony Hodgson of the Bengal army. In 1851, having finally overcome his scruples about worldly success, Arnold accepted a desirable civilian appointment as assistant commissioner at Amritsar in the Punjab. He threw himself into the job, only to collapse from overwork, and at the end of 1852 he and Fanny returned home on three years' leave. Back in England he published <span class="italic">Oakfield, or, Fellowship in the East</span> (1853) under the pseudonym Punjabee. Largely autobiographical, the novel describes a young man's quest for duty and truth in a world of distractions and includes a solemn, laboured attack on the vulgarity of Arnold's former military companions in India. In spite of the book's setting, India features in it only as an exotic background against which to view the flaws of European society.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1855 Arnold was contemplating the editorship of <span class="italic">The Economist</span> when John Lawrence approached him to become the first director of public instruction in the Punjab. He returned to India with a new energy. Eschewing abstractions, over the next eighteen months he toiled assiduously to create a workable system of vernacular schools which would teach solid, uncontroversial learning. In 1857&#150;8 he published several articles in <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span> on the causes of the uprising. On 24 March 1858 Fanny died, having never fully recovered from the birth of their fourth child. Distraught, Arnold immersed himself in writing a <span class="italic">Memorandum on the Admission of the Bible as a Classbook into Government Schools</span>, a mature but impassioned argument against government-aided proselytization. He had never questioned that it was the duty of a Christian to seek the truth, but he could not be convinced that Christianity encompassed the whole truth of the world to the exclusion of other faiths. In February 1859, suffering from intermittent dysentery, he took a year's furlough and sailed for England. He died on 9 April 1859 at San Roque, Gibraltar, and was buried there. His two sons and two daughters were brought up by his eldest sister, Jane, and her husband W. E. Forster; in 1879 they took the name Arnold-Forster. Among them were Florence Arnold-Forster, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49722/', "Frances Egerton Arnold-Forster")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30459/', "Hugh Oakeley Arnold-Forster")</script>. Arnold's eldest brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/679/', "Matthew Arnold")</script>, composed the poem &#145;A Southern Night&#146; in his memory; he also alluded to him in <span class="italic">Stanzas from Carnac</span>.<br>
