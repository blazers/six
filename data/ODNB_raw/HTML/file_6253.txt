<span class="headword">Cope,  Edward Meredith</span>  (1818&#150;1873), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born on 28 July 1818 in Birmingham. He first went to school in Ludlow, but then moved to Shrewsbury, where his headmasters were Samuel Butler and B. H. Kennedy. Cope entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1837. He was elected a scholar in 1839 and won the Porson prize in the same year. He graduated BA (first classic) in 1841 and MA in 1844. In 1842 he was elected a fellow of Trinity, becoming a tutor and lecturer in Greek in 1845. He was a proctor in 1859. He was ordained deacon in 1848 and priest in 1850, but although he regularly assisted various Cambridge contemporaries with their parish duties, he found the work of the educational clergy more congenial than that of the parochial.<br>
<br>At Trinity, Cope was a conscientious and respected lecturer. His main subjects were the Greek tragedians, historians, and orators, although in later years he lectured regularly on Plato and Aristotle. His learning and industry were notable, but, as he confessed to friends, he found it impossible to rewrite material once he had made up his mind on a topic, and this led to a certain diffuseness and lack of clarity in his work.<br>
<br>In the vacations Cope was an indefatigable traveller with an excellent knowledge of European languages. He regularly spent the summer walking in the Alps, and kept extensive and detailed vacation journals which remain unpublished.<br>
<br>In 1854 and 1855 Cope contributed articles to the first two volumes of the <span class="italic">Journal of Philology</span> criticizing Grote's views on the sophists in his <span class="italic">History of Greece</span>. Notes and corrections by Cope were included by Grote in a later volume. In 1864 he published a literal translation of Plato's <span class="italic">Gorgias</span>, and a similar version of the <span class="italic">Phaedo</span> was edited after his death by H. Jackson.<br>
<br>Cope's most important works were on Aristotle's <span class="italic">Rhetoric</span>. He published an introduction in 1867, and an edition with an extensive commentary was completed by J. E. Sandys and published in 1877. This edition is unusual for its time in the detail of its explanatory notes, which include frequent translations. Cope carefully relates the ideas of the <span class="italic">Rhetoric</span> to other passages in Aristotle and to later writers on the subject, from whom he quotes extensively. His work remains one of the chief sources of information on ancient rhetoric after more than a century.<br>
<br>In 1867 Cope was a candidate for the professorship of Greek at Cambridge; the votes of the electors were divided and as the vice-chancellor and the master of Trinity, on whom the election then devolved, differed, the appointment lapsed to the chancellor, who gave the chair to B. H. Kennedy. There is no doubt that his disappointment on this occasion preyed on Cope's mind, and was one of the causes of the acute mental illness which led to his retirement in 1869. His mind gave way and he died, unmarried, at Ticehurst, Sussex, on 4 August 1873, and was buried on 14 August in Birmingham.<br>
