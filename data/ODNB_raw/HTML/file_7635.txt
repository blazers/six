<span class="headword">Digges, Sir  Dudley</span>  (1582/3&#150;1639), <span class="occ">politician and diplomat</span>, was the elder surviving son of the mathematician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7639/', "Thomas Digges (c.1546&#150;1595)")</script> of Digges Court, Barham, Kent, and his wife, Anne or Agnes (<i>d</i>. in or after 1595), daughter of Sir Warham St Leger of Leeds Castle, Kent. The poet and translator <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7638/', "Leonard Digges (1588&#150;1635)")</script> was his younger brother. Dudley's godfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8160/', "Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester")</script>, under whom his father had served in the Netherlands. On 18 July 1600 Digges matriculated from University College, Oxford, aged seventeen. He graduated BA in 1601. In 1602 the master of his college, George Abbot (later archbishop of Canterbury), introduced Digges to Sir Robert Cecil, who may have provided him with his introduction to political life. In 1604 Digges published his father's tract on military discipline, entitled <span class="italic">Four Paradoxes</span>. In 1605 he married Mary (<i>bap</i>. 1590, <i>d</i>. 1631), daughter and coheir of Sir Thomas Kempe of Olantigh, near Wye, Kent. He then went on his first trip to the continent. After he returned he was knighted at Whitehall on 29 April 1607. In 1610 he was elected to parliament to represent the newly enfranchised borough of Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire. Following the death of his wife's father that year, Mary's three sisters conveyed their shares in Chilham Castle and manor (Kent) to her and Sir Dudley, who became possessed of the entire fee of it. Digges proceeded to demolish the ancient mansion and built a magnificent new house, finally taking up residence there about 1616.<br>
<br>In 1611 Digges contributed a few lines to the collection of &#145;panegyrick verses&#146; which prefaced Thomas Coryats's <span class="italic">Coryats Crudities</span>. Much preoccupied with overseas trade, he was a shareholder in the Virginia Company and the East India Company. He also took a keen interest in the search for the much vaunted north-west passage. One of the founders of a company incorporated in 1612 for the purpose of trading by that route, he published an account of the ensuing exploration. In 1613 Digges was appointed to the high commission, a prerogative court with jurisdiction in church matters, and his appointment was renewed periodically thereafter. The following year he was candidate for the governorship of the East India Company. Also in 1614 he sat at Westminster for Tewkesbury again, taking an active role as a committee member and speaking out against papists and the impositions which he believed were responsible for putting English merchants out of business. His papers on the subject of impositions were requisitioned and burnt by order of the privy council at the dissolution of that assembly. It is said that he himself was even imprisoned for a short time. In 1615, in connection with investigations into the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury, Digges gave testimony which has been interpreted as having helped to incriminate the earl of Somerset. In the same year he published the treatise <span class="italic">The Defense of East India Trade</span>, an apology for the East India Company's monopoly.<br>
<br>In 1618 the tsar of Russia, who was then engaged in a war with Poland, approached James I for a loan. The king ordered the Muscovy and East India companies to furnish &pound;20,000, and Digges was dispatched to convey the money to Moscow. Years later, Digges claimed that he had been honoured by appointment to the service of the king's bedchamber in respect of this diplomatic mission. He left England in April, and on reaching Russia he sent his secretary, Finch, to Moscow, with half of the cash and letters from the king. Refusing the terms of the loan, the tsar extorted the money from the hapless Finch, and Digges returned to England with the balance in October. An account of this journey, written by John Tradescant, who accompanied Digges in the capacity of naturalist, is preserved in manuscript in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. In 1620 Digges and the president of the East India Company, Maurice Abbot, brother of Archbishop George Abbot, went to the United Provinces to negotiate a settlement of the company's disputes with its Dutch counterpart, but returned unsuccessful.<br>
<br>In 1621 Digges was returned for a third time by the electors of Tewkesbury. He spoke against monopolists and Catholics, and was a keen advocate of war with Spain. Initially popular in the lower house for his stance during the stand-off with the king at the end of the first session, later, in the dispute regarding privilege, he was hesitant in supporting the Commons and as a result lost his reputation with his fellow MPs. Digges's quest for favour at court had become all the more urgent as his financial position deteriorated. The cost of rebuilding Chilham forced him to request the withdrawal of his stock from the East India Company, but he was turned down, despite the grant of royal warrants in support of his request. In 1622 he was appointed to the commission sent to Ireland to investigate the kingdom's financial straits, a development which has been described inaccurately as a punishment for his behaviour in parliament. The commission had been conceived by Lord Treasurer Cranfield as a weapon against the marquess of Buckingham, whose exploitation of Irish resources was notorious. But having marked Digges as a potential client, Buckingham secured his appointment as a counterweight to those commissioners who might seek to damage his interests. Digges certainly saw his posting as a &#145;probation for promotion&#146; made honourable by his appointment as commission vice-president and Irish privy councillor  (Treadwell, 189).<br>
<br>By the autumn of 1622 Digges was back in England, trailing the court to Royston and Newmarket in the hope of pressing the case for his preferment. But as far as his intended patron was concerned, Digges mishandled his responsibilities by making a preliminary report on the commission's work which led to a moratorium on grants of royal bounty in Ireland, and his hopes of catching a ride on Buckingham's bandwagon were disappointed. His only appointment was to attend a welcoming ceremony for the Spanish ambassador in June 1623, which can hardly have been to his taste, given his publicly stated views on relations with Spain. Naturally it was these views which eventually made him useful once the tide of foreign policy turned, and there are suggestions that Digges was courted by the duke of Buckingham and the prince of Wales prior to the parliamentary elections of 1624. Certainly his rival for one of the county seats in Kent, Sir Edwin Sandys, was able to triumph over him by portraying him as a courtier, while colleagues in the house appear to have regarded Digges, the member for Tewkesbury once more, as a would-be &#145;undertaker&#146;.<br>
<br>But Digges, like many contemporaries, was always caught between his desire for a war with Spain and a reluctance to pay for it. When his hopes of reward once again came to nothing, his support for court policy began to wane. After the accession of Charles I he composed a long letter of advice to the new king in which he added his own voice to the calls for an &#145;advised council&#146; which were increasingly becoming the staple of the anti-Buckingham opposition. In the parliament of 1625 he was hesitant in his defence of the duke. By 1626 he had apparently become positively &#145;disgusted at the failure of his attempt to become a Buckingham man&#146;  (Russell, 33). Henceforth he was a leader of the attack on the king's favourite.<br>
<br>Digges was not motivated solely by the frustration of his quest for preferment. He argued that the duke should be held to account for the detention of the French merchant vessel the <i>St Peter</i>, and for the deleterious consequences for English merchants trading in France. These concerns doubtless reflected the nature of his constituency among the merchants of the London exchange, and probably indicate that he co-operated with the French ambassador, who was vehement in his prosecution of the same business. Digges may even have been involved in co-ordinating the attack on Buckingham with supporters of the king's new French wife, Henrietta Maria. Sir James Bagg wrote to the duke that Digges, &#145;being privately more dangerous than publicly, is thought to be wholly my Lord of Canterbury's&#146;, also indicating the strength of Digges's continuing association with George Abbot  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>addenda</i>, <i>1625&#150;49</i>, 113).<br>
<br>Pressing for the foundation of a West Indies Company, Digges clearly also continued to hanker after a freebooting war with Spain in the Caribbean which would avoid burdening the country with direct taxation, clearly setting him at odds with Buckingham's preferred strategy. He got into trouble for his introduction and preamble to the charges of impeachment against the duke, in which he compared him to a comet which, having appeared suddenly amid a firmament of fixed stars, demanded closer examination. Following Digges's speech, Sir John Eliot compared the duke to Sejanus, and by implication likened the king to the tyrant Tiberius. On 11 May both men were thrown into prison. Amid uproar over the implications for parliamentary privilege, Digges's release was secured four days later, and he kissed hands with the king. But whatever the hopes for a reconciliation, the slight in parliament to the king's favourite was evidently not forgotten.<br>
<br>In September 1626 Digges's appointment to the commission for the collection of the privy seal loan in Kent was rescinded by the privy council. He appears to have lost his place on the county bench about the same time. Summoned before the board in December, apparently for insisting that he be allowed to pay the forced loan in London rather than at home in Kent, he spoke out of place and was imprisoned for sharp words against Lord Tufton, and for showing disrespect to the council. He spent two months in gaol. Relations apparently improved by the time of his appointment to the Kent recusancy commission in November 1627, increasing the likelihood that, for fear of any further punishment, Digges had eventually complied with the demands that he offer the king a loan.<br>
<br>In 1628 Digges won the parliamentary seat to represent his home county. He was appointed chair of the committee of trade and consequently was in a position to forward legislation supporting the chartered companies, particularly the East India Company. He also sat on committees for drafting the petition of right and gave the introduction, subsequently printed, at the first major conference with the Lords on 7 April. In the first session of this parliament Digges spoke more than ninety times; in the second he addressed the matter of tonnage and poundage, called for an inquiry regarding the increase of Catholics in England, and vigorously supported parliamentary privilege for John Rolle, a merchant whose goods had been seized on his refusal to pay tonnage and poundage. He also spoke up against the burdens which military preparations were placing on his county. It has been said that he strongly disapproved of the violent scenes which preceded the dissolution of 1629. In 1630 hard cash finally obtained that which fortune had denied him hitherto when he obtained the reversion of the office of master of the rolls for a down payment of &pound;5000 and the promise of the same amount at the death of Sir Julius Caesar, the incumbent. Having obtained honorific admission to Gray's Inn by right of the house's lord of misrule, the prince of Purpoole, in 1618, Digges now had himself readmitted and was called to the bench with full voting rights five days later. He served as master of chancery from 1631 to 1637. In 1636 he assumed the mastership of the rolls. The judge Sir Richard Hutton wrote that Digges was &#145;an able and sufficient man of great understanding, very affable and courteous and gives good orders&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Sir Richard Hutton</span>, 107).<br>
<br>Digges retained his interest in the trading companies until the end of his life. In 1631 he was named as a commissioner for advancing the Virginia plantation, and in 1637 he was called upon to advise regarding the formation of a new company for the West Indies. He died on 18 March 1639 and was buried in the family mausoleum at Chilham, which he began constructing in 1620. In his will he charged his estate near Faversham, where he had much increased his water courts, with an annuity of &pound;20 to provide prizes for a foot-race, open to competitors of both sexes, to be run in the neighbourhood every 19 May. The annual competition was kept up until the end of the eighteenth century. Digges was survived by four sons. The eldest, Thomas, married a daughter of Sir Maurice Abbot and had one son, Maurice, who was created a baronet on 6 March 1666, but died childless. His third son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7636/', "Dudley Digges (1613&#150;1643)")</script>, achieved some distinction as a royalist pamphleteer, publishing <span class="italic">The Unlawfulnesse of Subjects Taking up Armes against their Soveraigne in what Case soever</span> in 1643, the year of his death of camp fever at Oxford. Digges also had three daughters, of whom one, Anne, married William Hammond of St Alban's Court, near Canterbury, and was an ancestor of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12158/', "James Hammond")</script>, the elegiac poet. A memorial in the Chilham mausoleum records the eventual success of Digges's judicial career, but draws a veil over his earlier days as a parliamentarian. In 1643 the Long Parliament ordered publication of his speech at the opening of the prosecution of the duke of Buckingham. In 1655 a tract was published entitled <span class="italic">The Compleat Ambassador</span>, compiled from Digges's copies of the correspondence of Queen Elizabeth with Leicester, Burghley, Walsingham, and Sir Thomas Smith regarding the negotiations for a treaty of alliance with France.<br>
