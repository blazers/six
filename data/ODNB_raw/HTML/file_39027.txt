<span class="headword">Marks,  Michael</span>  (1859&#150;1907), <span class="occ">retailer and chain store founder</span>, was born in Slonim, Russia, in June 1859, the youngest child of Mordecai Marks, a tailor, and his wife, Rebecca. His mother died in childbirth and he was raised by his elder sister. The family lived in considerable poverty and social oppression, typical of so many Jewish communities in nineteenth-century Russia. In his early twenties Marks fled a rising tide of antisemitism and arrived penniless in the north of England. He made his way to Leeds hoping to find employment with John Barran, a manufacturer of clothing who favoured East European refugees. By chance he came across Isaac Dewhirst, a wholesaler, who offered him help and loaned Marks &pound;5 to buy goods from his warehouse. Marks intended to make a living as an itinerant peddler, but he was physically frail and unsuited to such work. As an alternative he took a stall at Kirkgate open market in Leeds, which operated on Tuesdays and Saturdays, and at Castleford and Wakefield, which had different market days. In a short time he expanded his turnover in Leeds by working a stall in the covered market, which was open all week. All his goods were clearly priced and available for customer inspection, and his practice of offering a wide range of products for 1<i>d</i>., under the slogan &#145;Don't ask the price, it's a penny&#146;, was especially popular. From a business point of view it made for simple accounting, as Marks kept no written records in his early years, though he was obliged to rely on a large turnover to compensate for his small margins. His search for products that could sell for 1<i>d</i>. led him to stock an increasing variety of wares, from all types of household goods to toys, haberdashery, and stationery. In 1886 he married Hannah (Fanny), daughter of Moses Cohen, a tailor. They had four daughters, including the feminist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39092/', "Rebecca Dora Sieff")</script>, and a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34883/', "Simon Marks (1888&#150;1964)")</script>, who followed his father in business.<br>
<br>As the business expanded in Leeds, Marks was forced to recruit assistants who could run the stalls while he concentrated more on buying and distribution. He then expanded his business into the markets of the fast growing cotton towns, opening &#145;penny bazaars&#146; in Warrington in 1887, Birkenhead in 1890, and most importantly in Wigan market-hall in 1891. Wigan was better placed as a distribution centre and he opened a warehouse there and set up home with his family, in order better to supervise his growing retail empire. In 1892 he established another outlet in Bolton and in 1894 a shop in Manchester. Such expansion was proving too difficult for Marks to manage alone and he began to search for a partner; he first approached Dewhirst, but when he declined, Marks formed a partnership with Thomas Spencer, Dewhirst's cashier. Spencer brought with him much needed organizational skills together with some useful business contacts. The firm of Marks and Spencer was established in 1894 with each partner making share contributions of &pound;300. Marks remained in charge of all the buying operations and the retail side while Spencer focused on the wholesale side and the distribution of goods from the warehouse. It was at this time that Marks moved to Manchester, living above the shop and also leasing a warehouse in the city which was to become the new focus of operations.<br>
<br>Shortly after the firm became a limited company in 1903, Spencer retired and Marks was faced with an increased burden of work. He was now the director of a fairly large organization that had over sixty retail outlets in 1907, all based on the popular principles of open displays and fixed prices. Marks lacked any formal education and was certainly unaware of any of the theories of retailing, but he did have a unique understanding of the market and what customers wanted. He set out to offer consumers value for their money. This was a reflection of his humanitarian outlook, best seen in his treatment of employees. This benevolent attitude was also strongly apparent outside business: he regularly gave money to charities, including the working men's club in Manchester. He also avoided confrontation, inspiring confidence and affection from employees as well as his many friends. He died on 31 December 1907 at Knoll House, 396 Bury New Road, Higher Broughton, Salford; he was survived by his wife. He left a thriving retail business in the hands of managers until his son was old enough to take responsibility for it.<br>
