<span class="headword">Holt,  Emma Georgina</span>  (1862&#150;1944), <span class="occ">philanthropist and supporter of women's higher education</span>, was born on 10 January 1862 at Bradstones, Sandfield Park, West Derby, Liverpool, the only child of George Holt (1825&#150;1896), merchant and shipowner (co-founder of the Lamport and Holt Line), and his wife, Elizabeth (1833&#150;1920), daughter of Samuel Bright, merchant, of Liverpool, and his wife, Elizabeth Anne Bright. Educated at home by a governess, she was brought up to a life of cultured and elegant gentility; she produced her first specimen of needlework at the age of four and could speak French at eight. She was a day student at University College, Liverpool (of which her father was a major benefactor), during the Lent and summer terms of 1884 and spent two further terms in 1900&#150;01 attending lectures on the history of architecture at the college. (She later endowed a travelling scholarship in the university's school of architecture.) She was born into a family whose members were prominent Liberals and Unitarians and her religious, moral, and educational development was strongly influenced by the Revd John H. Thom (1808&#150;1894), minister of Renshaw Street Unitarian Chapel, Liverpool. Described by Thom in 1894 as &#145;almoner&#146; to the chapel's &#145;decayed members or families&#146;, she was one of the leaders of the chapel and of its successor, Ullet Road (Unitarian) Church.<br>
<br>On her father's death in 1896, Emma Holt became joint tenant, with her mother, of his estate, and continued his public work. A life governor of both University College and the University of Liverpool (which received its charter in 1903), she was also, unusually for a woman, a member of the university's council from 1909 to 1915 and from 1916 to 1934. She took a particular interest in the welfare of women students and was a founder (together with her cousins Eva Melly and Jane Herdman, wife of Professor W. A. Herdman) and the principal benefactress of a hostel for women students at the college, University Hall, which opened in 1899 and was presented to the university in 1921. Besides her substantial donations to the hall and its building fund, there were her gifts of furniture, paintings, and books, in order to provide the hall with a collegiate life in surroundings of beauty, dignity, and comfort. She contributed generously to the cost of the women's wing of the university's students' union (completed in 1913), including paying for the installation of an oak staircase. Besides her substantial gifts to University Hall prior to 1921, her recorded monetary gifts to the university over the period 1904&#150;42 total &pound;33,813 (of which &pound;8950 was given jointly with her mother). In recognition of &#145;the large and far-reaching benefactions, in which she has maintained the princely practice of her family&#146;, the university in 1928 awarded her the degree of doctor of laws, <i>honoris causa</i>.<br>
<br>In 1910 Emma Holt persuaded the university's council to appoint a committee to consider the advisability of increasing the proportion of women on the university's staff; the report of the committee (whose members included Emma Holt and Eleanor Rathbone, also a member of council) supported the case, which was also accepted by the council but taken little notice of by the senate. In 1915 she supported the recommendation, accepted by the university court, that Latin should cease to be a compulsory subject at matriculation for medical students, recognizing that women students were particularly handicapped by the regulation.<br>
<br>Emma Holt also contributed her services as counsellor and voluntary worker to a number of Liverpool charities. Of the Liverpool Queen Victoria District Nursing Association, she was not only a subscriber from its foundation in 1898 but also joint, later sole, lady superintendent of one of the busiest districts from 1915 to 1943. The Holt and Rathbone families were closely associated with both this association and other charities including (in the persons of Eleanor Rathbone and Emma Holt) the Liverpool Council of Social Service and the Liverpool Personal Service Society. Emma Holt was an early supporter of the Victoria Women's Settlement, whose honorary secretary from 1904 onwards was Eleanor Rathbone. She took a particular interest in the Girls' Own Club of the Liverpool Domestic Mission (one of whose founders was the Revd J. H. Thom) and was lady president of the Liverpool Home for Incurables. During the First World War she converted the former Liverpool residence of an uncle, Alfred Holt (1829&#150;1911), into a war hospital and supported it when afterwards it became a women's hospital.<br>
<br>In 1940 failing health led Emma Holt to leave Liverpool and spend her last years at her Lake District home, Tent Lodge, in her beloved Coniston, at whose parish church she worshipped. She died there, unmarried, on 19 December 1944 and was buried on the 22nd in the Holt family burial-ground, Toxteth Unitarian Chapel, Liverpool. She bequeathed her Liverpool home, Sudley, Mossley Hill, to the city to be used as a public garden and park; a total of 146 paintings in Sudley, collected by her father, were also left to Liverpool, to be kept together as a collection, on condition that the public were allowed to view them free of charge. Besides bequests to relatives and servants, she left &pound;13,500 to named Liverpool charities, including the university and University Hall.<br>
<br>Of short stature, Emma Holt was plain featured, with a long face. Portraits of her in later life show a stately and gracious lady but inadequately convey her character. &#145;Modest, simple, invariably kind and friendly, yet with a shrewd judgement of men and things&#146;, wrote Eleanor Rathbone of her in the <span class="italic">Liverpool Daily Post</span> of 21 December 1944. A devoted Unitarian, her inherited wealth was regarded as held in trust, to support those not so fortunate as herself.<br>
