<span class="headword">Laird,  Macgregor</span>  (1808&#150;1861), <span class="occ">shipbuilder and explorer</span>, was born in Greenock, the younger son of William Laird, founder of the Birkenhead firm of shipbuilders, and Agnes Macgregor; he was the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15894/', "John Laird")</script>. On leaving school in Edinburgh he was given a partnership in the business by his father.<br>
<br>The existence of the Niger River, rumoured since antiquity, was confirmed by explorers who had struck its course inland, but failed to discover its mouth. In 1830 the problem of the mouth of the Niger was suddenly solved by Richard and John Lander, who had sailed down the river from Busa, emerging into the Atlantic Ocean from the River Nun, one of the &#145;oil rivers&#146;, where African coastal middlemen were shifting attention from the slave trade (made illegal for British subjects in 1807) to supplying palm oil to Liverpool traders for the growing soap industry in Cheshire.<br>
<br>Laird was so fired by enthusiasm at this discovery that he left his father's firm to form the African Inland Company. Richard Lander joined the enterprise, advising that a profit could be made from ivory and indigo trading. Laird built two paddle-wheeled steamers designed to make the ocean voyage to west Africa and ascend the shallow waters to be found on much of the Niger. One of them, the <i>Alburkah</i>, 55 tons, would make maritime history as the first vessel constructed entirely of iron to complete an ocean voyage. Laird unsuccessfully approached the British government for financial subsidy. He saw his ambitions for trade, shipping innovation, and exploration as serving the higher purpose of striking &#145;a mortal blow to that debasing and demoralizing traffic which had for centuries cursed that unhappy land&#146; and &#145;to be the means of rescuing millions of &hellip; fellow men from the miseries of a religion characterized by violence and blood, by imparting to them the truths of Christianity&#146;  (Howard and Plumb, 388).<br>
<br>As a technical and exploration venture, the expedition of 1832&#150;4 was successful; the <i>Alburkah</i> proved the feasibility of the iron steamship and Laird and his crews penetrated the 550 miles from the sea to the confluence of the Niger and Benue, and a further 80 miles up the latter. Overall, however, the expedition was a disaster. Trading was not profitable, and the ships were attacked returning down the Niger at Aboh by African middlemen traders, despite the fact that Laird had wisely, on Lander's advice, kept out of the palm-oil trade. Lander and three others were killed in this affray. The toll of disease was dreadful. Of the forty-eight white men who began the venture in 1832, only nine survived when it ended in 1834. The major killer was malaria, for which there was no treatment. Laird himself was seriously ill, and his health never fully recovered. He vowed to make no more inland expeditions until a cure could be found.<br>
<br>For almost twenty years thereafter Laird remained mainly an observer of the west African scene, publicly resisting efforts at inland penetration such as the disastrous Niger expedition of 1841, sponsored by the anti-slavery movement with government support, whose death rate amply justified Laird's warnings. Until the end of the 1840s Laird concentrated on the development of transatlantic steamships. In 1837 he was one of the founders of the British and North American Steam Navigation Company, whose vessel the <i>Sirius</i> made the first completely steam-powered Atlantic crossing in 1838. He remained immersed in the problems of iron steamship technology, taking out a number of patents in the field, until 1850, by which time he had moved from Birkenhead to London.<br>
<br>In 1851 Laird made the decision to concentrate his activities once again on west Africa, this time by providing a regular ocean steamship service to the main ports. He pressed the British government for help, and in January 1852 was awarded a mail contract for ten years with annual subsidies starting at &pound;23,250 and decreasing to &pound;18,750 in the final year. Laird was then able to found the African Steamship Company, with a paid-up capital of &pound;132,842. Though experiencing financial difficulties in the first few years, the company was well established and profitable by 1860, operating seven steamships carrying mail, cargo, and passengers on a regular basis from Liverpool (to which it moved from London in 1856), calling at the main ports where British traders were present between Freetown and Fernando Po. Small traders, including Africans, began to ship goods and compete with the larger firms.<br>
<br>In 1854 Laird returned once again to his earlier ideas of Niger penetration. The catalyst appears to have been William Balfour Baikie, surgeon and naval officer in west Africa, who proposed to give daily doses of quinine, an ancient South American Indian malaria treatment hitherto ignored by European medical authorities. Laird secured a British government contract to build and equip a vessel to ascend the Niger and Benue. The expedition of 1854, under Baikie's command, was as successful as that of 1832&#150;4 had been disastrous. Thanks to quinine, not a single member of the expedition died. Laird now moved to place the Niger enterprise on a permanent footing. In 1857 he contracted with the Admiralty to send a steamer up the Niger annually for five years in return for a subsidy. These new expeditions, however, were less successful. The African coastal middlemen, armed by Liverpool traders, were determined to keep others out of the palm-oil trade of the lower Niger. In 1859 Laird's steamer laden with produce was attacked. Soon afterwards his station at Aboh was sacked. For the next two years he was involved in bitter exchanges with the Foreign Office over the failure of the navy to protect his vessels, and what subsidies he should be paid.<br>
<br>None of these questions were resolved when Laird died at 1 Surbiton Crescent, Surrey, on 27 January 1861, aged fifty-two. He had been married and he left children, but no further details are known. His career epitomized beliefs and qualities that came to symbolize the Victorian age. An ardent evangelical protestant and opponent of the slave trade, he shared the view that Africa could be &#145;civilized&#146; through the beneficent alliance of Christian missionary activity and &#145;legitimate commerce&#146; replacing trade in human beings.<br>
