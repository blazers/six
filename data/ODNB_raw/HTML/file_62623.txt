<span class="headword">Dawes,  Geoffrey Sharman</span>  (1918&#150;1996), <span class="occ">physiologist</span>, was born on 21 January 1918 at the vicarage, Mackworth, Derbyshire, the youngest of the five children of William Dawes, vicar of Mackworth and later of Elveston-with-Thurlaston in Derbyshire, and his wife, Olive Susannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> White. He attended Shardlow Hall, a local preparatory school, and then Repton School, also in Derbyshire. It was planned that he would follow in the footsteps of both his father and grandfather to study at Cambridge, but he won an exhibition at New College, Oxford, where he entered the honours school in physiology in 1936. He took first-class honours in physiology in 1939, and graduated BSc one year later. He graduated BM BCh from the Oxford medical school in 1943, and DM in 1947. After one year as a house physician in the Radcliffe Infirmary he began his scientific career in the pharmacology laboratory in Oxford working on matters related to military questions, such as treatments for gas gangrene or nerve gas exposure. He was precluded from military service because he suffered from asthma. On 15 April 1941 he married Margaret Joan Monk (<i>b</i>. 1918/19), daughter of Harold Francis Monk, of the Malay civil service. They had met early in their undergraduate days in Oxford. They had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>After the end of the war in 1945 Dawes was elected fellow and tutor in physiology at Worcester College, Oxford. A year later he won a Rockefeller travelling fellowship to work at Harvard University in the department of pharmacology; he also spent some time with the Johnson Foundation in Philadelphia, learning relevant electrophysiological techniques. In 1947 he returned to Oxford, and a Royal Society Foulerton research fellowship.<br>
<br>At the very young age of thirty, in 1948, Dawes was appointed director of the Nuffield Institute of Medical Research in Oxford, where he stayed until he retired in 1985. He at first continued his work on cardiac and pulmonary chemo-reflexes. Among his early DPhil students was John Vane, awarded the Nobel prize for medicine in 1982. In 1950 Dawes redirected his interests to foetal physiology, in particular to the powerful mechanisms, previously undefined, that ensure the massive respiratory and circulatory changes necessary for the first breath taken at birth. This evolved into an interest in foetal asphyxia, where his experiments had clinical implications because of the importance of birth asphyxia as a cause of death or long-term disability. His systematic investigations of methods to improve resuscitation were translated into the worldwide practice of measuring and correcting acidaemia of the newborn after birth asphyxia.<br>
<br>In 1969 Dawes, working with Geoffrey Liggins on sabbatical leave from Auckland, New Zealand, was among the first to establish that the foetus made episodic &#145;breathing&#146; movements even in the airless environment of the womb, and that these were related to its sleep state. This opened up completely new areas of interest for Dawes, including foetal neurophysiology. He quickly appreciated that spontaneous, cyclical, central nervous system activities (integrated as states of foetal sleep) determine many foetal events, including limb and breathing movements, as well as fluctuations in heart rate variability. In the last five years of his fruitful directorship he translated some of these insights in developing computerized systems for analysing the human foetal heart rate, which depended directly on recognizing changes dependent on foetal sleep state. This system, which he continued to refine until his death, became a clinical standard for assessing the well-being of the unborn child at the turn of the twentieth century.<br>
<br>Dawes published more than 135 scientific papers and 55 reviews. His first publication, in the <span class="italic">Journal of Physiology</span> in 1941, was on the vasodilator actions of potassium; the last, published posthumously in 1999, was a collaboration with his son Nicholas, and described novel findings on patterns of the human foetal heart rate in labour. After his retirement in 1985 he worked for five years as part-time director of the newly created Sunley Research Centre of London University, located at the Charing Cross and Westminster Hospital. During this time he commuted from his home in Belbroughton Road, north Oxford, the family home from 1953, where he continued to live for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Dawes received many honours, which reflected his national and international reputation. These included awards from scientific and clinical organizations in the United States, Canada, and Europe. He was made a fellow of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (1969), the Royal Society (1971), the Royal College of Physicians (1972), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (1974), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (1976). In 1981 he was appointed CBE. Dawes also had many outside interests. He served on the governing body of Repton School for nearly thirty years, and his leisure activities included fly-fishing and gardening. He died of a sudden and massive stroke, at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, on 6 May 1996. Three days previously he was discussing the next stage of his research investigations with his clinical colleagues, retaining an undiminished creativity, curiosity, and enthusiasm for discovery that were the hallmarks of the man and his scientific career. He was survived by his wife and their four children.<br>
