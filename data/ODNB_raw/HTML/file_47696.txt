<span class="headword">Law <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Frost]</span>,  Harriet Teresa</span>  (1831&#150;1897), <span class="occ">secularist</span>, was born in Ongar, Essex, on 5 November 1831, the daughter of Henry Frost, a butcher, farmer, and contractor. She was reared as a Strict Baptist in the severe Calvinist tradition. When her family moved to London she taught in a Sunday school and started her own school to assist the family's finances. In east London she came in contact with secularists, initially speaking against them but gradually being won over to their point of view.<br>
<br>On 11 January 1855 Harriet married Edward Law, a dealer in property and the son of William Law of Newton Abbot; they had a son and three daughters. Law was a Christian undergoing a crisis of faith similar to her own. They soon both became secularists, and their house at 38 Boyson Road, Walworth, London, became a centre for secularist social occasions, especially from the mid-1870s. From 1860 Harriet Law was established as the leading female secularist platform speaker, working in the mould of Emma Martin. Edward Royle notes of her: &#145;as a young woman she was remembered as having a low, pleasant voice, but her later efforts in large halls and out-of-doors gave her a harsher tone&#146;  (Royle, 5.135). She took the view that women were the equals of men, and had a hostility towards doctors. Though associated with Charles Bradlaugh she did not join the National Secular Society; in 1869 she was president of the Freethought League and was one of the founders in 1877 of the British Secular Union (both organizations being independent of Bradlaugh). In 1876 she took over the <span class="italic">Secular Chronicle</span> and edited it for three years, losing heavily on it while promoting secularism, republicanism, and the emancipation of women. She also published <span class="italic">An Hour with Harriet Martineau</span> (1877).<br>
<br>Harriet Law was a rough advocate of secularist views which, though the obverse of her earlier Calvinism, she advanced with the same uncompromising dogmatism. She lacked the social graces of Annie Besant, who eclipsed her in her later years. In 1867 she was elected a member of the general council of the First International. On 7 July 1878 she wrote a biographical article on Karl Marx in her <span class="italic">Secular Chronicle</span> and on 4 August that year published his reply to George Howell. Her socialist opinions made her much more cautious than most secularists about associating with the Liberal Party. Ill with bronchitis, she retired from public life and died from a heart attack at 24 Somerville Road, Peckham, London, on 19 July 1897, being buried at Forest Hill cemetery on 23 July. Her husband survived her.<br>
