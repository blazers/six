<span class="headword">Pinker,  James Brand</span>  (1863&#150;1922), <span class="occ">literary agent</span>, was born in east London of a working-class family. Few facts are known of his early background and family connections, but it appears that he had little formal schooling, and began his working career as a clerk at the Tilbury docks in London. In either 1887 or 1888 he moved to Constantinople to become correspondent and agent for the <span class="italic">Levant Herald</span>, remaining there until about 1890. Some time during these three years, his fianc&eacute;e, Elizabeth Seabrooke, joined him from Britain, at which point they were married. They had three children: two sons, Eric (<i>b</i>. 1892) and James Ralph (<i>b</i>. 1900), who entered into business with their father, and a daughter, Mary Oenone (<i>b</i>. 1903), named after the Irish novelist Edith Oenone Somerville, with whom the Pinker family was particularly friendly.<br>
<br>Late in 1890 or in 1891 the couple left for London, where Pinker began work as a reader and then assistant editor to C. N. Williamson, editor of the illustrated weekly <span class="italic">Black &amp; White</span>, which began publication in early February 1891. Pinker also began reading manuscripts for a publishing company. There is evidence that he briefly edited <span class="italic">Woman</span> (founded in 1890) and was the first editor of <span class="italic">Pearson's Magazine</span> (launched in January 1896). James Hepburn suggests in his introduction to the <span class="italic">Letters of Arnold Bennett</span> that Pinker's role in the latter publication was short-lived and limited to enabling the launch of the first issue. What is clear is that through these positions Pinker gained an intimate knowledge of and contacts in the British literary and publishing world, both of which stood him in good stead in his subsequent career as literary agent.<br>
<br>By the turn of the twentieth century the professionalization of the literary market place had begun in earnest. Increased productivity, technological advances, and expanding national and international literary markets coincided with the establishment of associations to represent the professional interests of various sectors of the British and American book trade. The development of international copyright acts and agreements during the late nineteenth century also played its part in establishing regular patterns of income for authors. The literary agent subsequently became a major player in the literary arena, acting as a mediator between author and publisher in arbitrating and evaluating literary property. Establishing himself in an office in Arundel Street, London, in early 1896, Pinker set out to exploit the potential of this newly emerging profession, with H. G. Wells as one of his first clients. Within two years his skill at negotiating rights and contracts for authors in both the American and British markets had established him as one of the leading literary agents of his time, alongside Alexander Pollock Watt and the American-born Curtis Brown.<br>
<br>Not all authors found his services of value, though. Oscar Wilde, for example, concluded after Pinker's failure to find an American publisher for <span class="italic">The Ballad of Reading Gaol</span> in 1898 that &#145;he was not to be trusted&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Arnold Bennett</span>, 23). Likewise D. H. Lawrence dismissed Pinker as &#145;that little parvenu snob of a procureur of books&#146;  (ibid., 26). His negotiating skills were recognized by others, however, including Frank Swinnerton, for whom Pinker was a man &#145;who knew the monetary secrets of authors and the weaknesses of publishers, terrified some of these last and was refused admittance by others, dominated editors, and of course enjoyed much power&#146;  (ibid., 27).<br>
<br>As well as representing established authors such as Wells and Galsworthy, Pinker concentrated on promoting and developing the careers of newly emerging writers. Numbered among his clients were Jack London, Henry Lawson, Stephen Crane, Ford Madox Ford, James Joyce, George Gissing, Violet Hunt, and Arnold Bennett. He formed particularly close relations with Henry James, acting as his agent from 1898 until James's death in 1916. James viewed Pinker as &#145;excellently effective&#146;, and in light of his subsequent friendship had Pinker act as one of his sponsors for his application for British naturalization in 1915  (Gale, 515).<br>
<br>Pinker also befriended Joseph Conrad, for whom he served as a prominent and imposing negotiator of literary property&#151;a man of patience who, as Conrad wrote in 1904, &#145;has treated not only my moods but even my fancies with the greatest consideration&#146;  (Hepburn, 58). Pinker, &#145;the rosy, round-faced clean-shaven grey-haired sphinx with a protrusive under-lip&#146;, as one contemporary described him  (<span class="italic">Letters of Arnold Bennett</span>, 27), was to become the major financial provider and buffer in Conrad's life; between 1903 and 1922 he acted as Conrad's banker and financial manager, paying for hotel rooms, comestibles, and clothing, advancing him money, and cajoling and coaxing long-awaited manuscripts from him. At one point in 1908 Conrad owed Pinker over &pound;1600 in outstanding debts, then a substantial sum. Not until 1912, when Pinker scored a coup by negotiating major sums for the serialization of Conrad's novel <span class="italic">Chance</span> in the <span class="italic">New York Herald</span>, did this long-term investment begin to pay off for both men. Conrad relied on him for support and financial guidance until Pinker's death. While on a business trip accompanied by his daughter Oenone, Pinker died at the Biltmore Hotel, New York, on 8 February 1922 from influenza and pneumonia-related complications contracted on the boat voyage from London. His agency continued under the direction of his two sons until crashing in 1944.<br>
