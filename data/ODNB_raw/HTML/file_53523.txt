<span class="headword">Badger,  Charlotte</span>  (<em>b. </em>1778?, <em>d.</em> in or after 1816), <span class="occ">escaped convict</span>, was one of the first European women to live in New Zealand. She may have been the child of Ann and Thomas Badger baptized on 31 July 1778 at the parish church of St John, Bromsgrove, Worcestershire. In July 1796 a Charlotte Badger was convicted at the Worcester assizes for housebreaking and theft in Bromsgrove. She was sentenced to seven years' transportation. After delays she arrived in 1801 at Port Jackson (Sydney), New South Wales, on the <i>Earl Cornwallis</i>. By 1806 she had two years of her sentence to serve and was an inmate of the women's prison at Parramatta, where she gave birth to a child. In April, with a friend, Catherine Hagerty, she was assigned as a servant to a settler in Tasmania. Later events suggest they shared the resentment of many convict women to enforced service.<br>
<br>On 29 April Charlotte Badger sailed for Hobart on the <i>Venus</i> with her child, Catherine Hagerty, and a crew including male convicts. During the following five weeks, while loading stores <i>en route</i>, the captain's authority was undermined. The captain later accused the crew and convicts of drunkenness, vandalism, and immorality. Badger's and Hagerty's behaviour was defiant. They threw property overboard and entertained the intoxicated crew with a dance.<br>
<br>On 17 June, at Port Dalrymple, Tasmania, the convicts seized control of the ship, assisted by crew members including the first mate, Benjamin Kelly. Accounts of Badger's part in the rebellion vary. One claims that, with Hagerty, she incited the men to mutiny. Another states she flogged the captain and, dressed as a man, armed herself with a pistol and raided another vessel for supplies and weapons. At the time she was described as very corpulent with thick lips and light hair. The captain acknowledged the influence of the women, but claimed Kelly was the ringleader. Judgement would have been harsh had he admitted losing his ship to a woman.<br>
<br>With a full cargo intended for Hobart, the mutineers sailed across the Tasman. During the voyage Badger is believed to have formed a liaison with John Lancashire, a fellow convict, and Hagerty with Kelly. On reaching New Zealand these four, and the child, settled in huts on the shore at Rangihoua in the Bay of Islands. The <i>Venus</i> left stores and sailed south. By April 1807 Hagerty was dead, and soon after Lancashire and Kelly appear to have left New Zealand.<br>
<br>There is no information on how Charlotte Badger and the child survived after her shipmates left and her supplies were exhausted. She may have been the convict woman reported living with a lesser chief at the Bay of Islands some years later. For a time she was accepted by the Maori of the area. On two occasions she is known to have been offered passage back to Port Jackson. She refused and in 1808 said she would rather die with the Maori.<br>
<br>Maori attitudes to Charlotte Badger changed, probably when it became known that Maori women kidnapped by the crew of the <i>Venus</i> had been killed by tribal enemies. Her freedom was threatened as contact with missionaries and other Europeans increased and Maori co-operated in the return of runaway convicts to New South Wales. The last sighting of her was in Tonga. About 1816 an English woman and a young girl landed there, and the woman said she was escaping from the Maori of New Zealand. Her description, a big stout woman, matched Badger's. Tonga was a port of call for ships crossing the Pacific, and one account of her life claims she finally found freedom in America.<br>
