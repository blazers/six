<span class="headword">Gaster,  Moses</span>  (1856&#150;1939), <span class="occ">scholar and rabbi</span>, was born in Bucharest, Romania, on or about 16 September 1856, the eldest son of Abraham Emanuel Gaster (<i>d</i>. 1926), then the commercial attach&eacute; of the Netherlands consulate in that city, and his wife, Phina Judith Rubinstein. Gaster was educated at the universities of Bucharest and Leipzig. After graduation from Bucharest he proceeded to the rabbinical seminary in Breslau, at which he was ordained as a rabbi in 1881, but the same year he returned to Bucharest as a lecturer specializing in the history of Romanian literature and in comparative mythology. Gaster also found employment as a school inspector and a member of the council for the examination of teachers. However, he incurred the wrath of the Romanian political leadership through his activities on behalf of Romanian Jews, who had become entitled to Romanian citizenship under the treaty of Berlin (1878); this right had been obtained only after considerable pressure from Disraeli, acting at the behest of Jewish leaders such as the Rothschilds in Britain and France. Gaster was expelled from Romania in 1885; he never returned. Instead he sought refuge in England, where he had friends and was naturalized in 1893; he spent the rest of his life there. In 1890 Gaster married Leah Lucy (1871&#150;1940), the only child of Michael Friedlander (1833&#150;1910), principal of Jews' College, London. There were seven sons and six daughters of the marriage.<br>
<br>Gaster's subsequent career falls into several interconnected spheres. He was a man of outstanding intellect, a most accomplished linguist&#151;speaking, reading, and writing many European and Near Eastern languages (the Gaster papers, now housed at University College, London, are in ten languages), and a leading scholar in many fields. In 1886 he accepted an invitation to deliver at Oxford the Ilchester lectures, on Graeco-Slavic literature (published 1887); he was reappointed Ilchester lecturer in 1891. In purely Jewish subjects he was responsible for the first translation of the Jewish liturgy into Romanian (1883); additionally he published a number of monographs on subjects as diverse as Hebrew illuminated bibles of the ninth and tenth centuries and early Jewish magic. He also wrote in the fields of mythology and folklore (on which he became an internationally acknowledged authority) and on the Samaritans. In 1891 he published a two-volume study of Romanian language and literature which came to be regarded as the standard work on the subject. His intellectual eminence was publicly recognized through (for example) his election as vice-president of the Royal Asiatic Society and of the English Folklore Society, of which he became president. In 1930 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society for Literature. Meanwhile, the authorities in Romania had become, after a fashion, reconciled with him. In 1929 he became an honorary member of the Romanian Academy and he was also invested with the Romanian orders of the Crown and Bene Merenti.<br>
<br>In 1887 Gaster accepted an invitation to fill the historic office of <i>haham</i> of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews in England, which had remained vacant since the death of Rabbi Benjamin Artom eight years previously. The <i>haham</i>&#151;meaning, literally, &#145;wise man&#146;&#151;was in effect the chief rabbi of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews, who followed the Sephardi ritual and who had constituted the first Jewish community of the Cromwellian resettlement in the mid-seventeenth century. By the end of the eighteenth century they were far outnumbered by the Ashkenazi, or German and Yiddish-speaking Jews, who had come to Britain from central Europe. But the Sephardim, led for much of the nineteenth century by Sir Moses Montefiore, regarded themselves as the senior of the two Jewish &#145;nations&#146; in Britain, and stubbornly refused to place themselves under the ecclesiastical authority of the Ashkenazi chief rabbinate, an office filled from 1845 until his death in 1890 by Nathan Marcus Adler, and from 1891 until 1911 by his son Hermann Adler.<br>
<br>Gaster was not, of course, Sephardi. That did not bother the elders of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews, who needed a strong figure to stand up to the presumed authority of the Adlers. And it certainly did not bother Gaster. He relished and exulted in the role of underdog, which might have been made for him, and used the majesty of his office (an image which in a sense he created) to make the voice of Sephardi distinctiveness heard in every corridor of power to which he could gain access. He had no hesitation in turning personal prejudices into religious principles, a task made easier by Hermann Adler's comparative ignorance of Talmudic matters. So, for example, while Adler used his influence discreetly on behalf of the Conservatives in the general election of 1906, Gaster was publicly outspoken in his support for Liberalism. While Hermann Adler denounced before the royal commission on divorce (1910) the activities of foreign-born rabbis who insisted on their right to conduct religious marriages on their own authority, Gaster in turn denounced Adler. In 1929 Gaster helped undermine the attempt of Adler's successor, J. H. Hertz, to have the Ashkenazi chief rabbi recognized as the sole authority competent under English law to certify Jewish slaughterers of cattle and poultry.<br>
<br>If the Spanish and Portuguese leadership hoped that Gaster would put the Sephardim back on the map of Anglo-Jewry, they were certainly not disappointed. But Gaster fell out with this leadership, just as he fell out with most other people with whom he came into contact. Gaster was (and had already in Romania been) a confirmed Zionist, a believer in the right of Jewish national self-determination, and an espouser, therefore, of the view that Jews did indeed constitute a separate nationality. He was one of the earliest supporters in England of the founder of political Zionism, the Austrian Jewish journalist Theodor Herzl. When, on 13 July 1896, Herzl had made his first public speech on political Zionism (just a few months after the publication of his seminal pamphlet <span class="italic">Der Judenstaat</span>), the meeting had been chaired by Gaster at the Jewish Working Men's Club, Whitechapel. Gaster helped found the English Zionist Federation (of which he later became president) in 1899, and it was at his house in London that the dialogue was initiated between leading Zionists and the representative of the British Foreign Office, Sir Mark Sykes, which resulted in the promulgation of the Balfour declaration in 1917.<br>
<br>Gaster was immensely proud of his part in the triumph of Zionism. But the Sephardi leadership became increasingly angry and alarmed over his activities, which they viewed as compromising, undermining, and perverting his ecclesiastical position&#151;and also their status as British citizens. Gaster's claim (in a volume of essays edited by the Manchester Zionist Harry Sacher in 1916) that those who regarded themselves simply as &#145;Englishmen of the Jewish persuasion&#146; were guilty of &#145;an absolute self-delusion&#146; enraged the Sephardi elders. Other causes of friction added to their list of complaints. Chief among these were his management of the Judith Montefiore Theological College, Ramsgate (which was closed in 1896), and his defence of the right of foreign-born Jews not to be conscripted into the British armed forces during the First World War. There was, additionally, a feeling that Gaster had come to put his national profile before his purely parochial obligations. When the Zeppelin raids over London were launched by the Germans, Gaster took refuge in Brighton. This provided the pretext for his dismissal in 1918. But he continued for the next two decades to harry the Anglo-Jewish establishment at every opportunity. On 5 March 1939 Gaster suffered a heart attack while driving with his wife to give a lecture in Reading. He was pronounced dead at The Gables, Appleton, Berkshire, and was buried in the Hendon cemetery of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews, north-west London.<br>
<br>Gaster's second youngest child, <a name="cosubject_98651"></a><span class="headword">Jacob <span class="st"> [Jack]</span> Gaster</span>  (1907&#150;2007), <span class="occ">solicitor and communist activist</span>, was born on 6 October 1907 at 193 Maida Vale, London. He spent a year at the London School of Economics before becoming an articled clerk in 1925; he qualified as a solicitor in 1931. A talented speaker and organizer, he joined the Independent Labour Party in 1926 and was active in its revolutionary policy committee. In 1935, following the Comintern's endorsement of the idea of a &#145;popular front&#146; against fascism, he, along with the other members of the committee, joined the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). It was through the party that he met his wife, Maire Lynd (1912&#150;1990), daughter of Robert Wilson Lynd, journalist; they married on 7 October 1938 and had two daughters and a son. On the outbreak of the Second World War (and following the Nazi&#150;Soviet pact) Gaster voted against the CPGB's policy of &#145;revolutionary defeatism&#146; but reluctantly acquiesced in it. After the German invasion of the Soviet Union he volunteered for active service, and joined the Royal Sussex regiment. Injured in training, he spent the remainder of the war in the army education corps. From 1946 to 1949 he was one of two Communist members of London county council. In 1946 he was a member of the CPGB's national Jewish committee, which submitted a memorandum for the Anglo-American commission on the future of Palestine, arguing vehemently against the creation of a Jewish state, proposing instead a Palestinian state with safeguards for the Jewish minority. In 1952 he was a member of the delegation of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers that visited Korea to investigate claims that the USA had engaged in germ warfare. On his return he published a pamphlet, <span class="italic">I Saw the Truth</span>, that claimed to provide evidence of the use by the Americans of biological weapons. As a solicitor he represented a wide variety of left-wing individuals and causes, from anti-fascists in the 1930s to striking miners in the 1980s; among his clients were Joe Slovo and Tariq Ali. He finally retired in 1990. After the dissolution of the CPGB in 1991 (which he opposed, and regretted) he joined the Socialist Labour Party. He had a reputation of being abrasive and even aggressive, but was a devoted family man. He died at his home, 1 Antrim Road, Belsize Park, London, on 12 March 2007, and was survived by his three children.<br>
