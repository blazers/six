<span class="headword">Bough,  Samuel</span>  (1822&#150;1878), <span class="occ">landscape and marine painter</span>, was born on 8 January 1822 at Abbey Street, Carlisle, the third of five children of James Bough (1794&#150;1845), shoemaker, and Lucy Walker (1785&#150;1836), a cook. He was baptized at St Mary's Church on 10 February. Bough grew up in a household that lacked material comforts but encouraged a love of literature and the arts, his parents being friends with many local artists. At an early age he began to draw and stage his own theatrical performances for friends, paying off small debts from the proceeds. Although Bough received no formal art education, he assimilated knowledge from an older generation of artists in Carlisle, particularly John Dobson, George Sheffield, and Robert Harrington, and from such visiting artists as Thomas Miles Richardson senior and John Wilson Carmichael. His rambles through Cumberland gave him access to the art collections of the local gentry, which added to his appreciation of the old masters. A few visits to London, including a brief period apprenticed to the engraver Thomas Allom, completed his early schooling in art. Of the many other artists admired by Bough, J. M. W. Turner had the most apparent impact on his subsequent work. For the most part, however, he turned to nature and direct observation for his inspiration. This was to be Bough's approach for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>After an abortive start as a solicitor's clerk, Bough became a professional artist in Carlisle, struggling to make a living there until 1845, when he went to Manchester as an assistant scene painter. There he attended life classes at the Manchester Academy and formed close ties with the artists William Percy and Charles Allen Duval. Despite winning the Heywood silver medal for the best watercolour at the Manchester Exhibition of 1847 Bough had little financial success and took up another scene painting job in Glasgow in 1849. On 30 April of that year he married Isabella Taylor (1824&#150;1900), a young opera singer and harpist. His first major work, <span class="italic">The Baggage Waggons</span> (1849; Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery, Carlisle), was also painted in 1849. A scene of soldiers approaching his home town with a rainstorm in the distance, it contains most of the elements that marked his work across the rest of his lifetime: humanity set in the context of the elemental forces of nature.<br>
<br>Glasgow failed to offer the breakthrough in art that Bough needed, so he moved on, first to Hamilton and Cadzow Forest in 1851, where his friendship with the landscape painter Alexander Fraser (1827&#150;1899) produced some remarkable pictures of woodland scenes, in both oils and watercolour. Although he was not deemed a great colourist by his contemporaries, Bough's ability to capture the dappled effect of sunlight through trees in works from this period challenges such a judgement.<br>
<br>In 1854 Bough moved to Port Glasgow in order to improve his technique in drawing ships and boats. For a man remembered for his lack of formal art education and with a reputation for being slipshod in his approach, Bough was paradoxically meticulous when he chose to be, as exemplified by his <span class="italic">Gabbarts and Iron Shipyard</span> of 1855 (NMM), his most important work from this period. Tonally and compositionally a triumph, it depicts the whole spectrum of shipping activity on the Clyde, from the small boy sailing his model boat in the shallows to the construction of an ocean-going ship in the middle distance. From this date marine painting was to be one of Bough's most powerful forms of expression.<br>
<br>To augment his income from painting Bough continued his work as a scene painter and also developed a reputation as a book illustrator, notably of the works of Robert Burns and Sir Walter Scott. He continued both activities throughout his life.<br>
<br>In 1855 Bough moved to Edinburgh. He met with early success at the Royal Scottish Academy exhibitions and was elected an associate in 1856. Thereafter his relationship with the academy was a stormy one and it was not until 1875 that he was elected a full academician, despite being a prolific exhibitor.<br>
<br>Bough's reputation with the art-buying public and the critics continued to rise throughout the 1850s and 1860s and, ultimately, he displaced Horatio McCulloch as the most popular of contemporary Scottish landscape painters. Major works from this period include <span class="italic">The Mail Coach</span> (1855; Glasgow Museums and Art Gallery), <span class="italic">Cadzow Burn</span> (1856; Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery, Carlisle), <span class="italic">The Weald of Kent</span> (1857; National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne), <span class="italic">Royal Volunteer Review</span> (1860; National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh), and <span class="italic">Edinburgh Castle from the Canal</span> (1862).<br>
<br>Bough travelled and painted widely throughout England and Scotland, being mostly identified with his native Cumberland and the Fife coast. He also made occasional forays into Europe, including Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, and Germany. At times, disenchanted by his lack of official recognition in Scotland, he considered resettling in Cumberland or moving to London, but continued to live in Edinburgh for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1870s Bough's style displayed more impressionistic elements that were later taken further by his younger friend William McTaggart. <span class="italic">St Monance, Fife</span> (1876; Glasgow Museums and Art Gallery) and <span class="italic">Summer Evening, Cadzow</span> (1877; priv. coll.) are fine examples of this phase of Bough's work. He continued to produce major works in his more &#145;commercial&#146; style, including <span class="italic">A Sunny Day in Iona</span> (1871), <span class="italic">London from Shooters Hill</span> (1872), <span class="italic">Peel Harbour, Isle of Man</span> (1875), and <span class="italic">Burns Cottage, Alloway</span> (1876; Glasgow Museums and Art Gallery).<br>
<br>Renowned for a bohemian lifestyle, Bough made friends at all levels of society. He was widely read, a great storyteller, and an accomplished musician. A kind and generous friend, he could also be sarcastic and boorish towards those he thought pretentious. This latter trait made him significant enemies within the Scottish art establishment.<br>
<br>Bough recommended a palette with a limited range of colours to his students but ignored his own advice when it suited him. He did much of his preliminary sketching outdoors, but returned to the studio to finish the work. His approach was described succinctly by Robert Louis Stevenson:<blockquote>Artistic sight is judicious blindness. Sam Bough must have been a jolly blind old boy. &hellip; He saw, not the scene, but the watercolour sketch. Where does he learn that? In the studio, I swear. &hellip; He learns it in the crystallisation of daydreams; in changing, not in copying, fact. (<span class="italic">Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson</span>, 2.147)</blockquote>Always a controversial character, Bough established watercolour as a significant medium in Scottish art. His great facility in both oils and watercolour, and his speed of production, led some to criticize his work for lack of finish. In reality, he overproduced to meet the cost of his way of life. This led to his returning to earlier successful styles and subjects throughout his life and has left posterity with a confusing picture of his development as an artist. The best of his paintings have an energy and freedom of composition and style that mark his capacity for capturing the moment. He was best at portraying nature in its extremes&#151;wonderful skies with fleeting sunsets or storms and raging seas threatening the lives of those who sailed on them. Sentimentality had no part in his art.<br>
<br>In 1877 Bough's health began to fail and he suffered a stroke in January 1878. He appeared to make a good recovery, but fell ill again later that year and died, at Jordan Bank Villa, his home in Morningside, Edinburgh, on 19 November 1878 of cancer of the prostate. He was buried in Dean cemetery, Edinburgh, on 23 November.<br>
<br>Historically, Bough's place in Scottish art is as an artist of transition, marking the change from the traditional themes and style of McCulloch to the impressionistic effects of McTaggart and those who came after.<br>
