<span class="headword">North,  John William</span>  (1842&#150;1924), <span class="occ">illustrator and watercolour painter</span>, was born in Walham Green, Fulham, on new year's day 1842, the son of Charles North (<i>d</i>. 1890), a linen draper, and his wife, Rosemary Knight (<i>d</i>. 1880). His father failed in business as a draper in 1852 and then moved with his family to Worthing. Two years later North's parents emigrated to Canada, taking his younger brother but leaving North with his uncles, Alfred and John North, who lived in Brixton and Dartford. He spent school holidays with a great-uncle who was a farmer in Hertfordshire. Early drawings by North, dating from the mid-1850s, are of agricultural and rustic subjects.<br>
<br>It seems that North left school at a young age, having already decided to follow a career as an artist. Following a short period of study at the Department of Science and Art's school at Marlborough House, in 1857 or 1858 he was apprenticed to the wood-engraver Josiah Wood Whymper, and so met among his fellow employees Fred Walker (1840&#150;1875) and George John Pinwell (1842&#150;1875). From 1862 to 1866 North worked principally as an illustrator for the Dalziel Brothers, and rapidly gained a reputation for his sensitive interpretation of landscape subjects in the medium of black and white woodblock engraving. He made designs for periodicals including <span class="italic">Good Words</span> (in 1863 and 1866), <span class="italic">Once a Week</span> (between 1864 and 1867), and the <span class="italic">Sunday Magazine</span> (between 1865 and 1867). In addition, he contributed to <span class="italic">A Round of Days</span> (1866), <span class="italic">Wayside Posies</span> (1867), and Jean Ingelow's <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1867).<br>
<br>In 1860 North made a walking tour of Somerset in company with Edward Whymper (1840&#150;1911), his employer's son who was to become a distinguished alpinist and who in 1865 was to make the first ascent of the Matterhorn. The two came across a rambling and decrepit old house&#151;originally built as a hunting lodge by Cardinal Beaufort, half-brother of Henry IV&#151;called Halsway Manor, on the western flank of the Quantock hills. Over the following few years North made several long stays at Halsway, lodging with Mrs Thorne, wife of the tenant farmer, and being accompanied on occasions by Walker and Pinwell (although not together as the two were not themselves friends). Gradually the house itself, with nearby Little Halsway Farm and the surrounding countryside, became North's principal motif and inspiration. About 1868 Halsway changed hands and the easy arrangement with the Thornes ended. By 1869 North settled at Woolston Moor, a village closer to Williton and where he was to remain until 1884, the year of his marriage (on 19 February) to Selina (1862/3&#150;<i>c</i>.1898), the daughter of a Somerset farmer, Abraham Weetch.<br>
<br>North also maintained a studio in London, from the early 1870s onwards in Charlotte Street, and later at Wynchcombe Studios on Haverstock Hill. He visited Scotland on at least one occasion in the early 1870s, probably as a guest of William Graham MP, and painted views on the River Tay at Stobhall. In 1874&#150;5 he travelled with Walker to Algeria&#151;for the sake of the latter's health. North remained in Algeria after Walker returned to England, and in due course he had a house built there where he often stayed in the winter months until the time of his marriage. From 1884 to 1898 North and his wife lived (along with North's father, a widower since 1880) at Beggearn Huish House, at Nettlecombe between the sea and the Brendon hills. Eight children were born to them there, although at least two did not survive infancy, and Selina North herself died about 1898. As a widower North lived at Bilbrook and then, from 1904 to 1914, at Withycombe.<br>
<br>North loved the Somerset countryside and knew it well. Although agriculture itself is seldom represented in his art, he cared about the men and women whose lives were spent working the soil: he wrote articles about their living conditions and campaigned against the game laws. That North was a true countryman is witnessed by his friendship with the writer and naturalist Richard Jefferies (1848&#150;1887), to whose landscape accounts North's watercolours make a pictorial equivalent. Jefferies stayed with North in 1883 when gathering material for his book <span class="italic">Red Deer</span>; his memoir of this stay appeared as the essay &#145;Summer in Somerset&#146; (published in <span class="italic">English Illustrated Magazine</span> in 1887 and accompanied by drawings by North). In August 1887 North wrote an obituary of Jefferies for <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, and organized a subscription to provide for the writer's widow.<br>
<br>North's watercolours of the 1860s owe something to his experience as a designer of illustrations, retaining a coherent and linear compositional structure, matched with intense colour and careful observation of detail. According to Walker, writing in December 1868, &#145;each inch [of North's drawings was] wrought with gem-like care&#146;  (Marks, 165). A personal and artistic sympathy existed between North and both Walker and Pinwell, each of whom occasionally introduced figures to his landscape compositions, and he felt a great loss when in 1875 both died. North's later subjects are freer and more abstract; a classic North composition might consist of an entangled thicket or a marshy valley, with dense textures of vegetation forming a predominant foreground and all sense of perspectival distance sacrificed to effects of hazy atmosphere. In 1880 his work was characterized in a review in the <span class="italic">Spectator</span> as:<blockquote>a manner which gives the effect of wandering from place to place in his picture, working now here, now there, and finally, that seeing so much more beauty than he can compass, he stays his hand altogether, and sends his picture out to exhibition as little finished or as much so, as one of Turner's wilder fancies. (<span class="italic">Spectator</span>, 8 May 1880, 594)</blockquote>Herbert Alexander explained how determined North was to capture the particular aspect of places he cared about, for:<blockquote>he did not sit down, like the average painter, in picturesque scenery and arrange it improvingly; but &hellip; waited until an entrancing moment in the passage of light or some human episode happily related to its surroundings awoke in his heart the ecstasy which is the poetic state. Then no sacrifice of time or labour was too great in the searching of nature to aid his revelation. The production of a picture was one long agony, and so little was he satisfied with his achievement that it was always painful to him to view his works again. (Alexander, 48)</blockquote>North's watercolour <span class="italic">The Old Pear Tree</span> (exh. Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours 1892; Southampton Art Gallery)&#151;in which a ravaged tree is weighed down by golden fruit&#151;was admired as an evocation of a season that brings both fecundity and decay. Alexander described the technique devised by North to suggest the constant variety of nature: &#145;In water colour and oil an effect of intricate detail is found on examination to be quite illusive&#151;multitudinous form is conjured by finding it and losing it in endless hide-and-seek till the eye accepts infinity&#146;  (ibid.). In the last years of his life North painted pure landscapes that commented ironically upon the destruction of war, titles of which include <span class="italic">England in September 1914 (an Allegory)</span> and <span class="italic">England's Green and Pleasant Land</span>.<br>
<br>North exhibited at the Dudley Gallery from the late 1860s until 1871, the year of his election as an associate member of the Old Watercolour Society and to which he then transferred his main allegiance as an exhibitor (he became a full member of the society in 1883). From 1869 he occasionally exhibited at the Royal Academy, and in 1893 he was elected as an associate member. He exhibited at the Grosvenor Gallery between 1880 and 1887, later transferring to the New Gallery on the exhibition committee on which he sat. The purchase by the trustees of the Chantrey Bequest in 1891 of North's sad and symbolical painting <span class="italic">The Winter Sun</span> (Tate collection), a work which Herbert Alexander claimed was influential on the rising generation of landscape painters, was said to have been due to the influence of Frederic Leighton. Hubert Herkomer, in his 1892 Slade lecture, sought to identify North as the originator of the idyllist style of landscape. This campaign to raise public awareness of North was an embarrassment and irritation to him, and a final rift occurred when it emerged that he had opposed Herkomer's candidacy for the presidency of the Royal Watercolour Society.<br>
<br>From 1895 North devoted time and money to a business making drawing papers, and particularly one called O.W. Paper. Its failure left him virtually destitute and he depended in old age on a small pension from the Royal Academy. North died on 20 December 1924 at Stamborough, Old Cleeve, Somerset, the farmhouse high in the Brendon hills that was his last home. He was buried in Nettlecombe cemetery, Somerset.<br>
