<span class="headword">Leitner <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Sapier]</span>,  Gottlieb Wilhelm</span>  (1840&#150;1899), <span class="occ">educationist and orientalist</span>, was born at Pest, Hungary, on 15 September 1840. His name at birth, which was registered with the Jewish community of Pest, was Gottlieb Sapier. He was the only son (there was a younger daughter) of Leopold Sapier, a woollen merchant of Pest, and his second wife, Maria Herzberg. (The father also had four children by a first marriage: most other members of his family spelt their surname Saphir.) Leopold Sapier was the elder brother of Moritz Gottlieb Saphir (1795&#150;1858), a renowned German-language satirist and editor. He was also the elder brother of Israel Saphir, a merchant of Budapest, whose son Adolph Saphir (1831&#150;1891) converted to protestantism, moved to Britain, and became a well-known Presbyterian minister and theologian in London. In 1845 Leopold Sapier died and, possibly for reasons connected with the failure of the 1848 revolution in Hungary, his widow moved with her two children to Constantinople. There she married Dr Johann Moritz Leitner (1800&#150;1861), a Hungarian-born physician who had converted from Judaism to protestantism and was serving as a medical missionary to the Jews of the Ottoman empire, chiefly in Palestine, under the auspices of the London Society for Promoting Christianity amongst the Jews. Dr Leitner adopted his wife's two children, and Gottlieb Wilhelm Leitner (as he was henceforth known) always referred to him, inaccurately, as his real father. In 1861, in his petition for British naturalization, Leitner stated that he was an Anglican. Although he invariably shrouded his early life in considerable mystery, it was widely known in the Anglo-Jewish community that he was of Jewish origin. His obituary notice appeared in the <span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span> newspaper as did entries on his life in several Jewish biographical dictionaries.<br>
<br>It was as a youth in Constantinople that Leitner's gift for languages became evident; his abilities were so remarkable that <span class="italic">The Times</span> in its obituary (25 March 1899) stated that &#145;as a linguist he probably had no living rival in the area of his knowledge&#146;. He had learned fifteen languages by the time he left school and apparently knew fifty at the time of his death. For several years he also studied Islamic learning in Constantinople schools. At the age of fifteen he was appointed first-class interpreter to the British commissariat at Constantinople with, extraordinarily, the rank of honorary colonel. He was a student for seven months at the Malta protestant college and, about 1858, moved to London. He became a student at King's College, London, receiving a certificate in divinity in April 1859. In the same year he became a lecturer in Arabic, Turkish, and modern Greek at King's College and two years later, at the age of only twenty-one, was there appointed professor of Arabic with Mohammedan law. Soon afterwards he received an MA and a PhD from the University of Freiburg. In May 1862 he was naturalized as a British subject. He was admitted a student at the Middle Temple in November 1869 and was called to the bar in November 1875, but did not practise.<br>
<br>In 1864 Leitner was appointed to the post of principal of the Government College at Lahore, and spent the next fifteen years in India. His achievements in that country in the fields of both education and scholarly research were very considerable. He helped to raise &pound;32,000 to transform the Government College into the Oriental University of the Punjab. He attempted, with considerable success, to convince the local government and religious leaders, both Hindu and Muslim, to support Western science and the type of Western learning taught at the new university. He founded a number of schools, literary societies, and free public libraries on the English model, and published journals in English, Urdu, and Arabic. The best-known of these, founded in Lahore as <span class="italic">Indian Public Opinion</span>, changed its name to the <span class="italic">Civil and Military Gazette</span>. It had the distinction of employing Rudyard Kipling as an assistant editor, and Kipling published many of his earliest verses and stories in this periodical. In 1865&#150;6 Leitner, accompanied only by one English companion (who died in the Himalayas), conducted a series of important ethnographical expeditions to the previously almost unexplored mountain regions of Kashmir, an area he termed &#145;Dardistan&#146;, recording and attempting to classify the hitherto unknown languages of the area, tongues of great linguistic obscurity. In 1866 he barely escaped alive from an attack by warring Kashmiris. He later published a number of works on his explorations, notably <span class="italic">Results of a Tour in Dardistan</span> (1877), <span class="italic">The Languages and Races of Dardistan</span> (1889), and <span class="italic">Dardistan in 1866, 1886, and 1893</span> (1893). Widely acknowledged in Britain as one of the greatest experts on India's languages and cultures, Leitner in 1876 first suggested the famous Hindustani title of Queen Victoria as empress of India, kaisar-i-Hind, which became the accepted translation throughout India.<br>
<br>Leitner had always been notable as one of the few Europeans who mixed freely with the native Indians, treating them as social and intellectual equals. In 1879 he left India to pursue research at Heidelberg University and in 1881 returned to England, where he attempted to found a centre for the study in Europe of the culture and history of India and the Islamic world. In 1882 he wrote a <span class="italic">History of Indigenous Education in Punjab</span> which dealt with controversial subjects such as women's education. In the following year he succeeded in purchasing the vacant building of the Royal Dramatic College in Woking, Surrey, and established the Oriental Institute. This body, which by the 1890s was accredited for the purposes of granting degrees recognized by the University of Lahore, trained Asians living in Europe for the learned professions and taught Asiatic languages to Europeans wishing to travel in the East. It also contained an Oriental Museum and a notable art collection. Perhaps its most significant feature was the fact that it contained the first mosque to be founded in Great Britain, the well-known Shah Jahan Mosque at Woking, opened late in 1889 with a bequest from Shah Jahan, the begum of Bhopal, and designed in a charming oriental style by W. I. Chambers. Leitner was a tireless advocate of the fair treatment of Islam by the West, in 1889 producing a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Muhammadanism</span> which attempted to refute the baseless attacks made upon that faith by Englishmen and other Westerners. Leitner's genuine sympathy for the cultures of Asia marked him out as an early advocate of what is now termed &#145;multiculturalism&#146;, many decades ahead of its time. Lacking sound funding, the Oriental Institute regrettably did not survive Leitner's early death, closing in 1899. The Woking mosque was closed between 1899 and 1912, when it reopened on a permanent basis.<br>
<br>Leitner received many honours during his lifetime. He was made a knight of the order of the Iron Cross of Austria, and an honorary member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, of the French &Eacute;cole des Langues Orientales, and of the German Hochstift. He was awarded an honorary doctorate of laws by the University of Heidelberg, and was generally known as &#145;Dr Leitner&#146;. He also won a diploma for the promotion of education at the 1873 Universal Exhibition in Vienna, and was an honorary member of many learned societies throughout Europe. He had a number of devoted followers, among them J. H. Stocqueler, editor of <span class="italic">The Orientalist</span>, who published a biography of him in 1872. Leitner was a man of some means (he probably inherited money from his Hungarian relatives) and, from the 1880s, served as a director of the Delhi and London Bank. In appearance, he was a short, dark-haired man with very prominent bushy sideburns. While some regarded him as headstrong, wilful, and conceited, few questioned his energy or intellectual competence.<br>
<br>In October 1869 Leitner married, in Frankfurt am Main, Olympia Caroline, daughter of Heinrich Schwaab, a merchant who acted as the German and American consul at Broussa, near Constantinople. They had one son, Henry, who became an electrical engineer. In 1873 Leitner's sister Elisabeth married Charles Frederick Amery, an official of the Indian forestry commission. Their eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30401/', "Leopold Charles Maurice (formerly Moritz) Stennett Amery (1873&#150;1955)")</script>, became a prominent Conservative politician and cabinet minister, serving from 1940 to 1945, appropriately in view of his uncle's career, as secretary of state for India.<br>
<br>In 1898 Leitner fell ill and, early in 1899, travelled to Bonn to take the waters at the Godesburg spa. There he contracted pneumonia, and he died at Bonn on 22 March 1899; his wife survived him.<br>
