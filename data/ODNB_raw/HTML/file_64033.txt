<span class="headword">Bacon,  Mathew</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1700, <em>d.</em> in or before 1757), <span class="occ">legal writer</span>, was the second son of Edward Bacon of Rathkeny, co. Tipperary, Ireland. He was admitted to the Inner Temple on 27 May 1726, and to the Middle Temple on 21 June 1731. He was called to the bar on 24 November 1732. In 1731 he published anonymously the <span class="italic">Compleat Arbitrator, or, Law of Awards and Arbitraments</span>, which provided a straightforward and up-to-date account of the law of arbitration, and reached a third edition in 1770. In 1736 there appeared, also anonymously, the first two volumes of <span class="italic">A New Abridgment of the Law</span>, the third volume following in 1740. Only the first two thirds of the fourth volume were completed by Bacon before his death. The remainder of that volume, which appeared in 1759, and just over half of the fifth and final volume, which appeared in 1766, were written by Joseph Sayer, serjeant-at-law. The remaining portion of the fifth volume was completed by Owen Ruffhead. The work reached a seventh English edition, in eight volumes, in 1832. It was extremely popular in the United States of America, and was several times edited there by Bird Wilson, and by John Bouvier.<br>
<br>Unlike earlier abridgements, Bacon's work did not consist of notes of cases and statutes roughly put together under alphabetical heads, but rather foreshadowed modern legal encyclopaedias in containing a collection of scientific treatises on all branches of the law. Bacon's abridgement, which Charles Viner refused to regard as an abridgement at all, but just &#145;called so in order to make it more saleable&#146;, was in this way superior to Viner's, and attained a popularity which Viner's work was unable to match. Much, though not all, of Bacon's material was derived from the work of Jeffrey Gilbert, chief baron of the exchequer in Ireland from 1715 to 1722, and subsequently chief baron of the exchequer in England. There is a frequent resemblance between the text of Bacon's abridgement and Gilbert's published works <span class="italic">Devises</span> (1730), <span class="italic">Ejectments</span> (1734), and <span class="italic">Rents</span> (1758), though there is no such resemblance with certain other published works by Gilbert, and it is possible that Bacon obtained Gilbert's material not from his treatises but from a manuscript abridgement compiled by Gilbert. Bacon may also have used the works of Matthew Hale, William Hawkins, and Knightley D'Anvers. A section of Bacon's abridgement was published separately in 1798 as <span class="italic">Leases and Terms of Years</span>, with notes by Henry Gwillim. Bacon was probably also the author of another anonymous work, <span class="italic">A General Abridgment of Cases in Equity</span>, known as <span class="italic">Equity Cases Abridged</span>, part 1, the first equity digest, which was published in 1732 and reached a fifth edition in 1793. Bacon's will, leaving all his property to his brother John, was proved in London on 11 March 1757.<br>
