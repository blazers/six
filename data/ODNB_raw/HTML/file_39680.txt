<span class="headword">Bridgeman,  William</span>  (1645/6&#150;1699), <span class="occ">government official</span>, was born in Amsterdam as the only son of Richard Bridgeman (<i>b</i>. 1621) of Combs Hall, Suffolk, himself the eighth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3391/', "John Bridgeman")</script>, bishop of Chester (<i>bap</i>. 1577, <i>d. </i>1652). At the time of William's birth his father was a merchant and agent for the East India Company in Amsterdam. His mother was Catherine, daughter of William Watson, a fellow merchant of Amsterdam. The foreign-born Bridgeman was naturalized in 1657. Bridgeman was educated at Westminster School in 1656 and on 17 December 1662, aged sixteen, he matriculated at Queen's College, Oxford. In 1674 Bridgeman married Diana Vernatti (1653&#150;1707) who was of Italian origin and whose father, Peter Vernatti, was to be briefly caught up in the Popish Plot in 1678. According to John Evelyn, who knew the couple intimately, among her other talents Diana had an &#145;extraordinary skill and dexterity&#146; at the guitar  (Evelyn, 4.360). William and Diana had three children: Orlando (1680&#150;1731), MP for Ipswich in 1713, who as the only male heir of William Bridgeman inherited his property at Combs in Suffolk in 1699; William (<i>b</i>. 1684), who died in infancy; and Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1742).<br>
<br>Bridgeman's official life as an administrator in the later Stuart government began in 1667 when he entered the office of the secretary of state, Lord Arlington. His post as personal secretary to Arlington, in succession to William Godolphin, appears to have been the result of the patronage of his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3392/', "Sir Orlando Bridgeman (1609&#150;1674)")</script>, then lord keeper. In office William proved an able and capable subordinate, although noted on occasion as being rather too keen to stand upon his dignity. His friend John Evelyn claimed that Bridgeman was a &#145;very industrious and usefull man&#146; and &#145;a very ingenious person&#146; (Evelyn, 5.325; 4.197). In 1674 Bridgeman transferred his services to Sir Joseph Williamson and in 1679 he became under-secretary to Robert Spencer, second earl of Sunderland.<br>
<br>In the popular mind at least, Bridgeman was most closely associated with Sunderland. It was the rise of Sunderland which confirmed Bridgeman in the role of a professional civil servant of some note. Sunderland, as had Arlington, disliked routine administration and was content to leave this to Bridgeman, who was described in the 1690s as an &#145;indefatigable secretary-to-all-turns&#146;  (&#145;A French conquest&#146;, 10.490). Although the term under-secretary was not in much use at that time, it aptly describes Bridgeman's functions and he appears to have learned much from his service in the expanding and increasingly professional secretariat. As a result of his close association with Sunderland, Bridgeman's career suffered in 1680 when he was removed from office during the Exclusion crisis with the fall of his patron. Sunderland's return to power in 1683 saw Bridgeman once again reappointed as under-secretary in January 1683, seeming to confirm his status as Sunderland's client.<br>
<br>In the reign of James II Bridgeman proved more active on the public scene. A clerk-extraordinary of the privy council in 1676&#150;85, he was appointed a clerk of the privy council from 1685 to December 1688 (and again in 1693 until his death). He had in any case been busily acquiring social and business positions in the usual outlets for a person of his social rank. He was a justice of the peace for Middlesex (1677&#150;89), for Westminster (1678&#150;89), and for both counties from 1689 to his death. He acquired his residences in Pall Mall and at Combs Hall in Suffolk and he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 18 December 1680. He was master of the Clothworkers' Company in 1686&#150;7. He was also to become chairman of the Charitable Adventure in 1699. Politically, Bridgeman was active for the court as a member of parliament for Bramber in 1685 in the only parliament of James's reign. In 1688 he assisted Sunderland by preparing the lists of court candidates for the abortive second parliament of that year. On 17 November 1688 he was called upon to witness the will of James II, and from November to December 1688 he briefly served Charles, second earl of Middleton, again as under-secretary.<br>
<br>After the revolution of 1688 Bridgeman was singled out for questioning about his activities for the former regime, including his part in various <i>quo warranto</i> proceedings, as well as about the ecclesiastical commission on which he served as registrar from 1687 to October 1688. His interrogation by the Commons on 4 December 1689 illustrates an excellent civil servant's ability to equivocate, as well as his selective memory: he apparently saw nothing, knew nothing, and did nothing in equal measure&#151;he even &#145;forgot&#146; that Sunderland had been a member of the commission and claimed &#145;I was indisposed in my health, and remember no more&#146; (Grey, 9.339&#150;41; <span class="italic">JHL</span>, 14.388).<br>
<br>As a man useful to all turns, however, Bridgeman's past was no worse than many others' at that time and it in turn was soon forgotten. Ailesbury tells the tale in his &#145;Memoirs&#146; of Bridgeman's worth as an under-secretary to the earl of Shrewsbury in 1689&#150;90, when the latter told him that &#145;Mr William Bridgeman &hellip; read all the letters and reported to him the material contents on which he drew what moves were requisite, and then [Shrewsbury only] set his name to them&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; Ailesbury</span>, 1.247&#150;8). However, although this story was true of Bridgeman's attitude to his masters in general, in that he was remarkably efficient, the appointment is not supported by any other evidence. Bridgeman was appointed as an under-secretary to Henry Sydney in December 1690. Secretary Trenchard kept him in office from March 1693 until July 1694 and because of the secretary of state's illness it seems Bridgeman did most of the work.<br>
<br>In August 1694 having spent over a quarter of a century in the secretariat in one form or another Bridgeman was appointed secretary to the Admiralty in order to deal with the crisis there. Bridgeman immediately brought the organizational abilities he had acquired in the secretariat to bear on a confused and somewhat dated naval administration. As the senior administrative official in the Admiralty his gift for restructuring the business of the office enabled him to supervise what one naval historian of the period has called the greatest advance in naval administration since Pepys's work there in the 1680s  (Ehrman, 559). The new classification of office business and records was the result of Bridgeman's efforts and William III &#145;believing him very fitt for the employment&#146; gave him his favour, doubtless appreciating Bridgeman's efficiency in the face of an increasingly difficult war  (BL, Add. MS 37992, fol. 56). Using administrative methods carried over from the secretary of state's office the work of the office was divided and subdivided, records were regularly kept, staffing was reorganized, and a system of administration established.<br>
<br>While Bridgeman had administrative ability, in reality he had little knowledge of naval matters. Despite his innovations the actual burden of office proved too heavy for one man. The &#145;continuall round of Business&#146;, as well as the claims of Admiral Russell for his particular client, Josiah Burchett, brought in Burchett to hold the office of secretary jointly with Bridgeman from September 1694  (BL, Lansdowne MS 1152B (II), fol. 266). For some time Bridgeman remained the senior man in the partnership and it was not until the autumn of 1695 that Burchett began to take his share of the work there. Thereafter Bridgeman's increasing ill health in the last two years of the war and his frequent absences from the office began to shift the balance of power and after the treaty of Ryswick in 1697 he virtually ceased to act as secretary. He left the post in June 1698 and in the following year he died on 10 May.<br>
<br>Bridgeman's exceptional capacity for hard work within the later Stuart administration marks him out as a notable figure in the administrative revolution of the later seventeenth century. He became one of the first of the professional &#145;civil servants&#146;, establishing routines and administrative precedents, particularly in the Admiralty, which were to last well into the eighteenth century and even beyond.<br>
