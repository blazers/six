<span class="headword">Cuyler <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Rice]</span>,  Margaret</span>  (1758&#150;1814), <span class="occ">actress and courtesan</span>, was allegedly the daughter of an army officer who rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel in an Irish regiment and died in 1790, leaving his fortune to his mistress. For this information, and for details about her early life which may have owed more to John Cleland's <span class="italic">Fanny Hill</span> than to any respect for the truth, the only sources are the 1790 and 1792 editions of <span class="italic">The Secret History of the Green Rooms</span>. According to the narrative provided there, Margaret Cuyler was abandoned by her father (who, like the child's mother, goes unnamed), brought up as a playmate of George III's daughters by their deputy governess, procured by the notorious Mother Kelly, and rescued by Captain Cuyler of the 46th foot, whose common-law wife she became and whose child she bore and nursed during its few weeks of life. She was again abandoned when Captain Cuyler was dispatched to America, lived for three years with a Major Metcalf and then briefly with an unnamed young lord until the earl, his father, broke the match, and was then kept successively by an auctioneer and, in turn, the managers of London's two patent theatres, Richard Brinsley Sheridan of Drury Lane and Thomas Harris of Covent Garden.<br>
<br>It seems a circuitous way of explaining how a courtesan came to work in the theatre, but it was certainly at Drury Lane that Cuyler made her d&eacute;but on 4 January 1777, as Miranda in <span class="italic">The Tempest</span>, and it is possible that Sheridan was her partisan patron. Then, and throughout an undistinguished career on the stage, it was her appearance rather than her acting that attracted the admiration of reviewers. George Colman the younger, who was her manager for most of her summer seasons at the Haymarket, thought her &#145;a fine woman: a full-grown Irish Venus, without the Graces; and, though an indifferent actress, good enough for the indifferent part of Miss Mortimer&#146; in Harriet Lee's <span class="italic">The Chapter of Accidents</span>  (Peake, 2.51). It is a sober footnote in R. B. Peake's <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Colman Family</span> that shows that Margaret Cuyler married Dominic Rice of Gray's Inn on 21 February 1778. Nothing more is known of the marriage, and contemporary gossip continued to regard Cuyler as more consistently a courtesan (&#145;Cyprian&#146; was the term in currency) than a wife. Acting was, perhaps, her way of keeping up appearances. Although she continued to perform intermittently at Drury Lane and regularly at the Haymarket during the summer closure of the patent theatres until the spring of 1809, she was limited to supporting roles in comedy and farce. Her starring roles were reserved for routs and masquerades. On 24 May 1783, for example, the <span class="italic">Morning Herald</span> described the impression she made at a masquerade staged to give a French aristocrat a taste of English fashion: &#145;The lovely Mrs C---r appeared in the circle with peculiar &eacute;clat &hellip; the beautiful simplicity of her dress proved the delicacy of her taste in that important article, and exhibited her gracefully elegant form to the utmost advantage&#146;.<br>
<br>Like many Cyprians, Cuyler lived richly so long as her protectors kept faith by her. She is known to have been living in elegance in St Albans Street in 1784 during a period of four years' absence from the Drury Lane company, but by 1808 she was needy enough to call on help from the Drury Lane Actors' Fund. She was living seedily in Lambeth by then, and in Walworth when she died there on 14 March 1814. It was presumably her old theatrical companions who rallied round to arrange for her burial on 22 March in the actors' church of St Paul's, Covent Garden.<br>
