<span class="headword">Dunn,  Matthias</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1788, <em>d.</em> 1869), <span class="occ">mining engineer and inspector of mines</span>, was baptized at St Joseph's Roman Catholic Church, Birtley, co. Durham, on 10 December 1788, the son of Robert Dunn (<i>c</i>.1729&#150;1822) and his second wife, Agatha (Agnes), possibly <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hunter (<i>d</i>. 1790). His father was a coal viewer at Lumley colliery near Chester-le-Street. Little else is known about his parents and childhood, and historians have frequently confused him with his father's brother, Matthias Dunn of Stella Hall, and the latter's son, Matthias William Dunn (<i>c</i>.1781&#150;1858). The Dunns, a Roman Catholic family, were largely resident in Ryton and Blaydon-on-Tyne. Several generations had been involved in coal mining and associated commercial interests and the family were related by marriage to the Silvertop family, who were prominent in the coal and lead industries and occupied Stella Hall during the eighteenth century.<br>
<br>In 1804 Matthias Dunn was apprenticed to Thomas Smith, colliery viewer of Lambton colliery, Durham. In 1810 he was appointed assistant viewer at Hebburn colliery, also in Durham, under the supervision of John Buddle, where he oversaw the day-to-day running of the colliery. In 1813 he became resident viewer at Hebburn. There, on 9 January 1816, Dunn and the Revd John Hodgson, vicar of Jarrow with Hebburn, tested Sir Humphry Davy's wire-gauze safety lamp for the first time. Both men were active members of the Society for Preventing Accidents in Coal Mines (known as the Sunderland Society), which had been formed on 1 October 1813, following the explosion at Felling colliery in 1812.<br>
<br>By 1824 Dunn was undertaking freelance contract work at other collieries throughout the United Kingdom. He leased and became a partner in several collieries including Prestongrange colliery, East Lothian, where, in 1830, he sank a new shaft. At 420 feet this was the first deep shaft in Scotland. Here he introduced the system of cast-iron tubbing, first developed by John Buddle, and never before used in Scotland. He also applied this method in Ireland for the first time, in the sinking of one of the Castle Comer pits in Kilkenny. The Society for the Encouragement of the Useful Arts in Scotland subsequently awarded Dunn its first honorary medal for his work at Prestongrange.<br>
<br>During his time working in Scotland in the late 1820s Dunn had met Margaret Warden Hill Rennie (1794&#150;1869), daughter of Captain Archibald Hill Rennie (1767&#150;1832), of Balliliesk, high sheriff of Clackmannanshire, and his wife, Isabella Mortimer (1772&#150;1853). They were married on 19 January 1829 at Alloa, Clackmannanshire, and had four children: Isabella Agnes (1830&#150;1907), Robert (1831&#150;1840), <a href="#cosubject_62894">Archibald Matthias  (1832&#150;1917) [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and Margaret Mortimer (1836&#150;1875).<br>
<br>In 1831 Dunn was appointed viewer by the Hetton Coal Company, Durham, but he preferred to combine this post with other freelance contracts, which led to tensions with management. His perceived lenient handling of striking miners at the colliery between April and September 1832 further strained relationships, and he was dismissed at the end of 1832. As viewer of the St Lawrence main and Shield Field collieries he gave evidence on child labour to the children's employment commission (1842).<br>
<br>Throughout his career Dunn demonstrated a concern for mine safety and was particularly interested in improvements to mine ventilation and flood prevention. He was confident that the application of science and technology would help to diminish danger in pits. As a prolific author on mining and engineering, he produced books, pamphlets, and scholarly papers. He consistently highlighted the significance of maintaining an adequate underground air-flow rate to neutralize gases, recommending a minimum of 8000&#150;10,000 cubic feet per minute; the use of barometers to monitor changes; and the need for additional shafts. He applauded those collieries that embraced technology by introducing new techniques and modern equipment, and encouraged other collieries to follow suit. He welcomed the introduction of cast-iron equipment; the replacement of baskets with cages and slides; improved boiler safety valves; wire rope; innovative safety equipment such as Sir Goldsworthy Gurney's steam jet for extinguishing underground fires; and resuscitation equipment for injured miners. But he also stressed the importance of development and experimentation. Along with others, he was aware that the Davy lamp was not foolproof and so championed the work of those who strove for further improvements and refinements&#151;such as Dr William Reid Clanny. He advocated the need for education for those who managed and worked in the mines. But he emphasized that instruction should focus on technology and science, so that all mine employees&#151;managers and pitmen alike&#151;were not only alive to the dangers of their working environment, but also had sufficient relevant knowledge to help minimize incidents arising from those dangers. In 1849 he was an expert witness before the select committee into the means of preventing the occurrence of dangerous accidents in coal mines, where he pressed for compulsory government inspection, one of the few managers and owners/lessees to do so.<br>
<br>Dunn was appointed one of the first government mines inspectors under the <span class="roman">Inspection of Mines Act</span> (1850). Initially he had responsibility for Northumberland, Durham, Cumberland, and Scotland. His workload was excessive and he was relatively poorly paid (&pound;400 per annum plus travelling expenses) when compared with government inspectors in other fields. His powers were limited; his main responsibilities were to investigate and report. He was directed to &#145;abstain from any dictation or any unauthorized interference&#146;  (letter of appointment, Waddington to Dunn, 21 Nov 1850, TNA: PRO, HO 87/2). As a result, his influence was limited to recommendation and admonition. He expressed his frustration at not being called in to mines by either management or workers and urged miners to contact him if they were anxious about the condition of their pits, stressing that he did not have the power to enter and inspect mines uninvited. His position as government inspector nevertheless enhanced and strengthened his reputation as a mining engineer. Several of the recommendations in his authoritative work <span class="italic">A Practical Treatise upon the Best Means of Preventing Accidents in Coal Mines</span> (1855) were introduced in subsequent mining legislation. He was a founding member of the North East Institute of Mining Engineers, which was established on 23 June 1852, and vice-president of the Literary, Scientific and Mechanical institutions of Newcastle upon Tyne.<br>
<br>Dunn was one of the founder members of the management committee of the Newcastle upon Tyne Joint Stock Banking Company. In 1835 he produced a pamphlet in association with the engineer Robert Hawthorn setting out the advantages of a railway between Newcastle and Morpeth, intended to form the first phase of a rail link with Edinburgh. Eighteen months later, along with John Dobson and George Stephenson, he produced a plan for a railway from Newcastle to Edinburgh. By 1841 this was part of a more ambitious plan to link London by rail with Dublin, Edinburgh, and Glasgow. He was also a leading member of the Roman Catholic community in the north east. He was one of the chief lay mourners at the funeral of Newcastle's Roman Catholic Bishop Riddell in November 1847, and attended the &#145;Great Meeting of Catholics&#146; at Ushaw College in July 1858.<br>
<br>In 1866, owing to ill health, Dunn retired from his inspectorship with a pension. He died on 10 October 1869, just a few months after his wife, at Whitecliffe, Caterham, Surrey, where he had moved from Newcastle to be near his daughter.<br>
<br>His second son <a name="cosubject_62894"></a><span class="headword">Archibald Matthias Dunn</span>  (1832&#150;1917), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born at Wylam, Northumberland, on 23 October 1832. He was educated at Ushaw College and Stonyhurst College, then apprenticed in Bristol to the architect Charles Francis Hansom. Archibald set up a practice in Newcastle in 1854, and married there, on 2 January 1862, Sara Ellen (or Helen) Armstrong (1841&#150;1917), daughter of Hugh Clayton Armstrong, timber merchant. They had two sons. In 1870 he was elected president of the Northern Architectural Association, and in 1871 Edward Joseph Hansom, Charles Francis Hansom's son, became his partner. The partnership was commercially successful and they opened an office in London in 1880. The firm became Dunn, Hansom, and Fenwicke on W. Ellison Fenwicke becoming a partner in 1894.<br>
<br>The firm became the leading Roman Catholic architects in the north of England and were particularly noted for their work on churches. They received several prestigious commissions including Ushaw College, Stonyhurst College, and Downside Abbey. Dunn and Hansom were strongly influenced by the Gothic revival architect A. W. N. Pugin, and their first commission, in 1871, was the design of a tower and spire for St Mary's Roman Catholic Cathedral, Newcastle, which had been designed by Pugin. In 1872 they undertook the design of Neville Hall, the library hall for the headquarters of the North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers.<br>
<br>Archibald Dunn was an enthusiastic traveller and from the 1850s onwards he undertook several architectural trips to Europe and the Far East; after his marriage, he was often accompanied by his wife. In 1886, based on these travels, he published <span class="italic">Notes and Sketches of an Architect</span>. He had never taken professional qualifications, but, on his retirement in 1917, he was elected an honorary ARIBA. Having moved to Bournemouth in 1901, he died at The Wood House, The Avenue, Branksome Park, on 17 January 1917. His wife died later that year, on 28 September 1917. Under the names Sara H. Dunn and Mrs Archibald Dunn she wrote three travel books, <span class="italic">The World's Highway</span> (1894), <span class="italic">Sunny Memories of an Indian Winter</span> (1898), and <span class="italic">The Land of the Rosary</span> (1904).<br>
