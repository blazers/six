<span class="headword">Story,  George Warter</span>  (<em>c.</em>1664&#150;1721), <span class="occ">historian and dean of Limerick</span>, was born probably in Burgh by Sands, Cumberland, the eldest son of Thomas Story (1630?&#150;1721?), of Justice Town, near Carlisle, and his first wife, Thomasin Constable (<i>d</i>. 1674/5). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26601/', "Thomas Story (1670?&#150;1742)")</script>, the Quaker, was one of his younger brothers. In 1668 George was chaplain to the countess dowager of Carlisle at Castle Howard. He was in London when the army for Ireland was being raised in March and April 1689, and he accompanied Meinhard, duke of Schomberg, in August as chaplain to Sir Thomas Gower's regiment of foot. Gower died early in 1690, and Henry, third earl of Drogheda, succeeded him as commander. Story was an admirer and apologist of Schomberg, who was much criticized for his unwillingness to risk raw troops in a pitched battle and for the number of men lost by disease.<br>
<br>Story was at the battle of the Boyne and served with Lord Drogheda while the war lasted. A younger brother, who was ensign in the same regiment, was killed near Birr in June 1691. After the surrender of Limerick in November 1691 Story's regiment went to Ulster, &#145;the poor men enduring a great deal of hunger and hardship in so long a march&#146;  (Story, <span class="italic">A Continuation</span>, 285), and when the war ended they remained in the northern province as part of the standing army.<br>
<br>In December 1694 Story was appointed dean of Connor, and in 1704 he advanced to the deanery of Limerick. He had retained a living and owned a modest estate in England, both of which obliged him regularly to absent himself from his Irish cures. In 1691 he published a compendious <span class="italic">Impartial History of the most Material Occurrences in the Kingdom of Ireland</span>, which was completed early in 1693 with a separate <span class="italic">Continuation</span>, dedicated to William III. These volumes had the merits of an eyewitness to the recent fighting, and contain much valuable detail on the military engagements and the costs&#151;both human and financial&#151;of the Williamite war. They use a framework derived from earlier apologists of the English interest in Ireland, such as Spenser and Davies, and never enjoyed the influence of William King's <span class="italic">State of the Protestants</span>. Nevertheless, in his awareness of the continuing influx of Scots and of the cupidity of protestant landowners in preferring to set lands to Irish Catholic tenants for higher rents, and in his recognition that the Irish had no realistic alternative to rule by England, Story offered shrewd insights. Prophetic too was his belief that protestant evangelization, not penal laws, would win the indigenous population to the English interest. He returned to these themes when he preached in London to the Irish lord lieutenant and &#145;the protestant gentlemen of Ireland&#146; on 23 October 1714. He warned of the disaffection of some Irish Catholics and reminded his audience how much Ireland owed to English support. Topically he counselled that party strife be stilled and that all protestants rally to George I. Soon afterwards he returned to Limerick. By June 1716, when he entertained his brother Thomas at his home in Limerick he had married Catherine Warter, daughter and coheir of Edward Warter of Bilboa, near Doon, co. Limerick, whose name he added to his own. The Warter estate had been burned by some of Sarsfield's men, and they estimated that they had lost over &pound;13,000 as a result of the war. Story died on 19 November 1721 and left his family's Justice Town estate to his widow, who sold it to her brother-in-law Thomas Story in 1723.<br>
