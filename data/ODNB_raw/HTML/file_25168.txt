<span class="headword">Seymour, Sir  Francis</span>, first baronet  (1813&#150;1890), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, eldest son of Henry Augustus Seymour (1771&#150;1847) of Lisnabrun, co. Down, and his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 31 Aug 1867), daughter of the Revd William Williams of Cromlech, Anglesey, was born at Lisnabrun on 2 August 1813, and was commissioned as ensign in the 19th regiment on 2 May 1834. He became lieutenant on 16 June 1837. In 1839, at the request of the king of the Belgians, he accompanied Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in Italy. In 1840, after Albert's marriage, he was appointed groom-in-waiting to him, and continued in that office until Albert's death.<br>
<br>Seymour was promoted captain on 4 September 1840, and on 21 January 1842 he exchanged into the Scots Fusilier Guards, and obtained his company on 28 June 1850. He went with the 1st battalion to the Crimea in 1854, and was present at Alma, Balaklava, and Inkerman. At the latter he took command of the battalion, and was wounded. He was later wounded again, by a fragment of a shell which struck the back of his head during the siege of Sevastopol, when he was field officer in command in the trenches of the right attack. He was made brevet colonel on 28 November 1854 and CB on 2 January 1857. He received the L&eacute;gion d'honneur (fourth class) and Mejidiye (fourth class).<br>
<br>Seymour was promoted major in his regiment on 14 June 1858, and lieutenant-colonel on 13 February 1863; he went on half pay on 10 July 1863, and on 25 November 1864 became major-general. He commanded the troops in Malta from 1 January 1872 to 5 April 1874. He was made lieutenant-general on 23 May 1873, colonel of the 11th (North Devon) regiment on 7 February 1874, KCB on 29 May 1875, general on 1 October 1877, and GCB on 24 May 1881. On 1 July 1881 he was retired.<br>
<br>After Prince Albert's death in December 1861, Seymour was appointed groom-in-waiting to the queen. On 7 October 1869 he was made a baronet, and in February 1876 he became master of ceremonies and an extra groom-in-waiting. He was a knight grand cross of the Saxe-Ernestine order.<br>
<br>Seymour married, on 25 August 1869, Agnes Austin, eldest daughter of the Revd H. D. Wickham, rector of Horsington, Somerset, and they had one son and three daughters. He died at Kensington Palace on 10 July 1890.<br>
