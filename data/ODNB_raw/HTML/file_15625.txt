<span class="headword">Kingsnorth,  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1677), <span class="occ">General Baptist minister</span>, was almost certainly born in Kent. No details survive of his birth, parents, or indeed his career before 1640, although it has been suggested that he was either a mercer or a farmer  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Indeed, the home where he spent his adult life has been described as a &#145;farm house&#146;  (Ivimey, 2.233).<br>
<br>By 1640 Kingsnorth was apparently living at Spilshill House in Staplehurst, Kent, and seems to have held pastoral responsibilities extending to outlying villages including, according to a local chapel book, Smarden, Frittenden, and Headcorn. In 1640 he was a founding elder of a congregation in Smarden&#151;a gathered church which seems to have met in one or more private houses. This gathering was almost certainly connected with a congregational centre in Staplehurst; its precise denomination at this time is unclear.<br>
<br>In 1644 Kingsnorth was among a number of &#145;churchmen&#146; before whom Francis Cornwell, a Baptist minister from Marden, preached a controversial and influential visitation sermon in Cranbrook. Won over by Cornwell's doctrine of believers' baptism, Kingsnorth was subsequently baptized by William Jeffery, a Sevenoaks minister who had defended Cornwell in the dispute arising from his sermon. Having undertaken to publish a confutation of Cornwell's views, Christopher Blackwood, vicar of Staplehurst, similarly became converted; he and Kingsnorth then proceeded to gather together a Baptist congregation in the latter's home, Spilshill House. In common with the majority of the congregation, Kingsnorth subscribed to the doctrine of universal atonement, and was thereupon elected and ordained pastor; Blackwood, doctrinally isolated in his belief in particular election, occupied an ancillary position and subsequently left the church. Around 1656 the congregation, by now 100 strong, expanded to adjacent villages including Headcorn and Smarden. In 1672 Kingsnorth and three of his sons were granted licences to preach at private houses in Charing and Frittenden in addition to Staplehurst and Smarden. Kingsnorth remained the church's pastor until his death at Spilshill House in 1677.<br>
<br>Author of <span class="italic">The True Tything of the Gospel Ministers</span> (1657), Kingsnorth is also credited with the authorship of two other works which are no longer extant. In <span class="italic">The Pearl of Truth, Found out between Two Rocks of Error</span> (1670) and <span class="italic">Gospel Certainty of Everlasting Felicity</span> (date unknown), he appears to have consolidated his spiritual and pastoral position by attacking directly the doctrine of particular election.<br>
<br>Nothing is known about Kingsnorth's personal life. We can infer, however, that he married, since five sons followed him into the ministry. In the absence of either information or anecdote about his character, it nevertheless appears that latent doctrinal differences within the church were neutralized by a collective attitude of forbearance under Kingsnorth's leadership. The church continued to expand widely during his lifetime, and it was not until after Kingsnorth's death in 1677 that a definitive secession occurred&#151;a division reflected in the factionalized leadership of his sons.<br>
