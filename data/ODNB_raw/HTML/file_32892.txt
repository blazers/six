<span class="headword">Drew, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1838&#150;1910), <span class="occ">architect</span>, born at Victoria Place, Belfast, on 18 September 1838, came from a well-known Limerick family. His father, Thomas Drew (<i>d</i>. 1870), a staunch Orangeman, was long rector of Christ Church, Belfast, before becoming rector of Seaforde, co. Down, and precentor of Down Cathedral. A sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58177/', "Catharine Drew (1825/6&#150;1910)")</script>, was a well-known journalist in London. Thomas was educated in Belfast, and in 1854 was articled to Charles Lanyon. After serving his apprenticeship he formed a brief partnership in Belfast with another pupil of Lanyon, Thomas Turner (1820&#150;1891), before moving to Dublin, where he was to settle for the rest of his life. In 1862 he entered the office, in Dublin, of William George Murray (<i>d</i>. 1871). Next year he began to write for the <span class="italic">Dublin Builder</span>, and subsequently acted for a time as editor, introducing articles on antiquarian subjects. In 1864 he was awarded a special silver medal by the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland for his set of measured drawings of the Portlester Chapel in St Audoen's Church, Dublin. In 1870 he was elected associate of the Royal Hibernian Academy and the following year he became a full member. He married in 1871 Adelaide Anne, daughter of William Murray, formerly architect of the board of works, Ireland, and a collateral descendant of the architect Francis Johnston, founder of the Royal Hibernian Academy.<br>
<br>In 1875 Drew began independent practice in North Frederick Street, Dublin; he subsequently moved to Upper Sackville Street (now O'Connell Street), and then to 6 St Stephen's Green, a house designed by himself, and finally to 22 Clare Street. Noted by a contemporary for &#145;a robust and virile Gothic&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), Drew built up a reputation for ecclesiastical work which was the basis of his independent practice, almost all of it for the Church of Ireland denomination. As diocesan architect for Down, Connor, and Dromore, he designed a significant number of churches in the eastern part of Ulster in the 1860s and 1870s. His most important ecclesiastical work was St Anne's Cathedral in Belfast, in a Romanesque style, which was started to his designs in 1899 but completed by others following his death. He was also responsible for the restoration of Waterford Church of Ireland Cathedral and consulting architect to a number of other Church of Ireland cathedrals.<br>
<br>Among the other chief buildings designed by Drew were several in Dublin, including Rathmines town hall (1890&#150;94), the Ulster Bank in College Green (1888&#150;91), and the graduates' tercentenary memorial building at Trinity College (1899&#150;1902). He was also the only Irish architect to be invited to submit a design for the Queen Victoria memorial in London in 1901.<br>
<br>In 1889 Drew was elected fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects. In 1892 he was elected president of the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland and in 1902 he became the first president of the Ulster Society of Architects. Known to his contemporaries as a fluent and witty speaker, he delivered from 1891 an annual lecture on St Stephen's day, in Christ Church Cathedral, on its history and fabric. He was also instrumental in establishing in the crypt a museum of Irish antiquities. In 1895&#150;7 he was president of the Royal Society of the Antiquaries of Ireland.<br>
<br>Drew was elected tenth president of the Royal Hibernian Academy on 18 October 1900, on the death of Sir Thomas Farrell, the sculptor, and was knighted the same year by the lord lieutenant of Ireland, Earl Cadogan. In 1905 Dublin University conferred on him the honorary degree of LLD, and in 1910 he was asked by the National University of Ireland to fill the newly established chair of architecture at University College, Dublin. Drew died in hospital in Lower Mount Street, Dublin, on 13 March 1910 and was buried in Dean's Grange cemetery, co. Dublin. His wife survived him.<br>
