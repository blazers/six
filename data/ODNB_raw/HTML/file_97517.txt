<span class="headword">Peyton,  John Wynne William</span>, Baron Peyton of Yeovil  (1919&#150;2006), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 13 February 1919 at 6 Berkeley Street, Mayfair, London, the elder son of Ivor Eliot Peyton, of independent means, a farmer and captain in the South Nottinghamshire hussars, and his wife, Helen Dorothy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Elphinstone. He was educated at Eton College, and went to Trinity College, Oxford, in 1937 to read jurisprudence. At Oxford he met Edward Heath, and had a minor interest in university politics and the union. From 1936 onwards he was convinced that war was inevitable, and in 1939 he suspended his studies to enlist in the 15th/19th hussars, in which regiment an uncle had once been a general. Stationed in York, he met and fell in love with Mary Constance (<i>b</i>. 1921), daughter of (Everard) Humphrey Wyndham, an army officer then serving as aide-de-camp to George VI, and granddaughter of the second Baron Leconfield of Leconfield (and niece of the third, fourth, and fifth barons).<br>
<br>A member of the British expeditionary force, Peyton was captured during the invasion of Belgium in 1940, and spent the next five years as a prisoner of war. This was undoubtedly a formative period in his life, and several of his fellow prisoners became lifelong friends. He discovered an interest in music (he later became a friend of William Walton), and under the tutelage of Jack Hamson (before the war a Cambridge academic lawyer) studied for his bar exams. In 1941 he was part of an unsuccessful escape attempt that included Desmond Llewelyn among its participants. Peyton spent several months handcuffed during daylight hours in 1942, and was devastated by news of his brother Tommy's death that year. He wrote later of the &#145;bottomless misery of war&#146;  (Peyton, 42).<br>
<br>Liberated in 1945, Peyton at first found it difficult to adjust to freedom; to compound matters, on return to London he discovered that Mary Wyndham was about to marry Ralph Hamilton Cobbold. Called to the bar in 1945, in 1946 he approached Walter Monckton to secure a place in chambers, and was invited to become his personal assistant as constitutional adviser to the nizam of Hyderabad and Berar (then believed to be the richest man in the world) during the preparation for Indian independence. He spent two periods in India, allowing him to observe at first hand events surrounding independence. He returned to the country in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1947 he survived a serious plane crash near Basrah. In December 1947, in Johannesburg, South Africa, he married Diana Clunch, whom he had met a few months before. She was the daughter of Douglas Clunch of Durban. By this time Peyton had become a Lloyds broker, but quickly decided to enter politics. He stood unsuccessfully as Conservative candidate for Bristol Central in the general election of 1950, then won the seat of Yeovil in October 1951. In 1950 he and his wife had moved to Odcombe near Yeovil; they had three children, a daughter and two sons.<br>
<br>In parliament Peyton soon became reacquainted with Edward Heath (then deputy chief whip). In 1951 he became parliamentary private secretary to Nigel Birch (also educated at Eton), a junior minister at the Ministry of Defence. His membership of the regional health board both shaped his view of the limitations of state bureaucracy and allowed him to campaign successfully for a new hospital in Yeovil. During the 1950s he became an opponent of capital punishment, a stance that did not always find favour with his constituents. He was nevertheless a strong advocate of free market economics, and was a member of the right-wing Monday Club by the early 1970s.<br>
<br>In 1960 Peyton's younger son died during a routine operation; this led to a period of great unhappiness in his life. In 1962 he renewed his acquaintance with Mary Cobbold (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Wyndham). He and she were both divorced in 1966, and married on 27 July that year; it was a happy marriage that lasted the rest of his life. He became a stepfather to her son and daughter by her marriage to Ralph Cobbold.<br>
<br>In June 1962 Harold Macmillan asked Peyton to become parliamentary secretary at the Ministry of Power. Peyton saw poor industrial relations and management of nationalized industries as the two key issues, and embarked on a programme of visiting coalmines. He found the paperwork associated with ministerial life frustrating. He was not invited to join Heath's shadow team in 1965, but was asked to develop a policy for the west country before the general election of 1970. This identified developing transport links as being the priority for the region; following Heath's victory Peyton was surprised to be invited to become minister of transport. Industrial relations and poor infrastructure were again key themes, and he began developing good links with trade union leaders, including Jack Jones. His two most important decisions during this period were the introduction of compulsory helmets for motorcyclists and the signing of the treaty agreeing the channel tunnel in 1974. He viewed the latter as an important physical symbol of Britain's commitment to Europe; it also enabled him to strengthen his friendship with Christopher Soames, then British ambassador in Paris. In 1971 Peyton was responsible for the sale of British Rail's travel agency, Thomas Cook.<br>
<br>After the Conservative defeat in the general election of February 1974 Peyton began to develop his business interests, becoming chairman of the British subsidiary of Texas Instruments. He was also a director of Alcan Aluminium and of the London and Manchester Assurance Society. In November 1974 Heath invited him to become shadow leader of the House of Commons. Following Heath's defeat in the first round of the leadership election of 1975 (after which Peyton advised him to resign), Peyton stood in the second ballot, a move he later regretted. He received eleven votes. The victor, Margaret Thatcher, subsequently asked him to continue as shadow leader of the house, moving him sideways to become shadow minister of agriculture in 1976, a post he never really enjoyed. Peyton had admired Heath; his relations with Thatcher were less strong. In 1979 he was disappointed at being the only opposition spokesman not to be offered a cabinet post. His relationship with Thatcher never recovered; she offered him a life peerage at the next election, and he requested she confirm this in writing. He expressed misgivings at her divisive policies and treatment of the miners, but admired the way in which the Falklands conflict was handled in 1982.<br>
<br>In 1983 Peyton was appointed to the House of Lords, as Baron Peyton of Yeovil; his sponsors were the former prime minister Alec Douglas-Home, Lord Home of the Hirsel, and Lord Zuckerman, a longtime government scientific adviser. Zuckerman persuaded Peyton to become involved with the Zoological Society of London, and he quickly became treasurer, securing much funding during the 1980s. A well-received autobiography was published in 1997, and a biography of Zuckerman in 2001. In retirement he remained a highly regarded figure in his former constituency and could often be seen walking near his home in Hinton St George, wearing a distinctive black beret. He was a master of mischievous retort, a skill that made his writing attractive but did not always endear him to contemporaries; John Biffen once remarked, &#145;I wonder what quip John will make when he meets God&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 25 Nov 2006). He died at St George's Hospital, Tooting, London, on 22 November 2006, of multi-organ failure. He was survived by his second wife, his daughter, one son, and his stepchildren. A bequest was used for a memorial screen in Hinton St George church.<br>
