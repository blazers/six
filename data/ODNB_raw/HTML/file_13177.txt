<span class="headword">Heysham,  John</span>  (1753&#150;1834), <span class="occ">physician and demographer</span>, was born on 22 November 1753 in Lancaster, the son of Gyles Heysham, shipowner, and Anne Cumming, daughter of a substantial yeoman &#145;statesman farmer&#146; of Holme, Westmorland. The Heyshams were a junior branch of the Cornet (later Gernet) family, ancient lords of the manor of Heysham parish, Morecambe Bay. Heysham was educated in the Quaker school at Yealand, near Burton, Westmorland, followed by apprenticeship to Mr Parkinson, surgeon, at Burton, Westmorland, from 1769 to 1774, while being tutored in classics and mathematics by D. R. Hutton, the vicar of Burton. He then spent three years under Alexander Monro <i>Secundus</i>, Joseph Black, and the great nosologist William Cullen, at Edinburgh's celebrated medical school, taking his MD in 1777 through a thesis on rabies. After a year visiting London and Holland, including the Leiden medical school, Heysham settled in Carlisle, Cumberland. On 4 May 1789, in London, he married Elizabeth Mary Coulthard (1765&#150;1803), the only child of Alderman Thomas Coulthard, a wealthy tanner and twice mayor of Carlisle; they had four sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Though Heysham's private practice was never worth more than &pound;400 a year, his professional income was augmented through his many business interests, which included land ownership, a cotton works (Cowan, Heysham &amp; Co.), an iron foundry, and chairmanship of both the Carlisle Canal Company and Carlisle Gas and Coke Company. He also held numerous public offices; he was county commissioner for assessed taxes, commissioner for lighting and improvements, and chairman of the police commissioners. Until the election of 1832, when he backed reform, his political allegiance had always been to the all-powerful Lowther tories, from which followed a lucrative commission as magistrate in 1808 and then appointment as a deputy lieutenant of the county.<br>
<br>Heysham was a strong, energetic man who traversed the fells of the Lake District regularly, becoming the area's premier naturalist and ornithologist. He was elected an associate of the Linnean Society at its second meeting in 1788 and provided a major contribution on the subject to W. Hutchinson's <span class="italic">History of Cumberland</span> (2 vols., 1794). Heysham was on close terms with the area's principal landed families and Carlisle's eminent churchmen&#151;Archdeacon Paley and the cathedral's successive deans: Percy, Law, and Milner. These connections were of great assistance in his promotion of the town's public health. With Percy's help, a dispensary for the poor was founded in 1782 and the wealthy Robert Mounsey of Castletown provided a fever hospital.<br>
<br>Heysham is principally remembered, however, for his <span class="italic">Observations on the Bills of Mortality in Carlisle</span> (1780&#150;88), accessibly reproduced in Glass, <span class="italic">The Development of Population Statistics</span> (1973). This was a meticulous public health and demographic record of Carlisle in the 1780s which significantly improved upon John Haygarth's pioneering medical survey and census of Chester in 1774. Heysham took a census of the age and sex of every household member in 1780 and in 1787, while carefully recording the date, age, sex, and cause of every fatality from 1779 to 1787. Apart from aiding his own medical practice, this subsequently enabled the actuary of the Sun Life Assurance Society, Joshua Milne (with Heysham's vital assistance, recorded in Lonsdale's appendix detailing their correspondence) to publish in 1815 the only accurate life table for an English population for the entire period before the 1840s. The Carlisle table was rapidly adopted commercially and officially as a money saving replacement for Richard Price's faulty Northampton table. Heysham's path breaking survey directly inspired James Cleland's important innovation in 1821, whereby Glasgow became the first rapidly industrializing city in the world to have its health record rigorously monitored.<br>
<br>Heysham was, in fact, generally innovative in his approach to medicine. He was a leading advocate of both inoculation and Jennerian vaccination against smallpox. He anticipated by half a century the practice of feeding, rather than starving fevers, advocated in his <span class="italic">Account of the Jail Fever or Typhus carcerum; as it Appeared at Carlisle in the Year 1781</span> (1782). His focus from the start on a sophisticated health survey and the leading role he took in promoting collective public health measures amounted to his informal adoption of the role of town medical officer of health, over half a century before such a position had been statutorily defined. Heysham died at his home in St Cuthbert's Lane, Carlisle, on 23 March 1834 and was buried in St Mary's Church. A memorial window was placed at the east end of the south aisle of the cathedral.<br>
