<span class="headword">Spencer,  Robert</span>, first Baron Spencer  (1570&#150;1627), <span class="occ">politician and sheep farmer</span>, was the son of Sir John Spencer (<i>c</i>.1545&#150;1600) of Althorp, Northamptonshire, and his wife, Mary Catlin (<i>d</i>. 1621), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4896/', "Sir Robert Catlin")</script>. He was educated at Oxford University and on 15 February 1588 married Margaret (<i>c</i>.1570&#150;1597), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49827/', "Sir Francis Willoughby")</script> of Wollaton, Nottinghamshire. He was knighted in 1601 and created Baron Spencer of Wormleighton on 21 July 1603. He sat as MP for Brackley in 1597 and was a justice of the peace and musters commissioner for Northamptonshire from about 1601.<br>
<br>The Spencer family's fortunes were founded in the early sixteenth century by Robert's great-great-grandfather Sir John Spencer, who made large profits out of sheep farming in south-west Warwickshire. He was able to purchase two blocks of manors centred on Wormleighton in Warwickshire and Althorp in Northamptonshire which were to remain the family's principal residences. By the time Robert inherited the estate from his father in 1600 it had expanded considerably as a result of advantageous marriages and growing income from the carefully managed sheep flocks. He continued the family tradition and remained first and foremost a sheep farmer. At the time when he received his baronage, he was &#145;reputed to have by him the most money of any person in the kingdom&#146;  (Finch, 38), which presumably referred to reserves of ready money at his disposal. His income was between &pound;6500 and &pound;8000 a year, but there were several contemporary landowners wealthier than him.<br>
<br>Like other landed families whose wealth had been acquired recently, the Spencers were anxious to present themselves as long established. In 1595 Robert's father acquired a pedigree from the College of Arms which traced their descent back to the Despensers, earls of Gloucester and Winchester. This did not impress some members of the ancient peerage, however, and during the 1621 parliament Spencer's origins were denigrated by the earl of Arundel, who recalled that his own ancestors had suffered &#145;for doing the king and country good service, and in such time as when perhaps the lord's ancestors that spake last kept sheep&#146;  (Gardiner, 4.114). The insult was prompted by Spencer's challenging Arundel over Sir Henry Yelverton's right to a hearing in the Lords, after Yelverton had implicitly compared the duke of Buckingham to Edward II's favourite, Hugh Despenser. Arundel argued that he had said enough to warrant condemnation, but Spencer&#151;who must have been acquainted with Yelverton, a fellow Northamptonshire landowner and recorder of Northampton&#151;urged that he be allowed to explain himself. Arundel refused to apologize for the insult and was confined to the Tower.<br>
<br>This speech was Spencer's most significant intervention in parliament and did much to confirm his image among contemporaries as a &#145;patriot&#146; peer. Arthur Wilson, writing in the 1650s, described him as someone who:<blockquote>made the countrie a vertuous court where his fields and flocks brought him more calm and happy contentment than the various and mutable dispensations of a court can contribute; and when he was called to the Senate was more vigilant to keep the people's liberties from being prey to the incroaching power of monarchy than his harmless and tender lambs from foxes and ravenous creatures. (Wilson, 162&#150;3)</blockquote>Spencer's record in national politics generally bears out Wilson's verdict. In 1603, soon after he was made a peer, a career at court beckoned when he was sent to Germany as ambassador to invest the duke of W&uuml;rttemberg with the Order of the Garter, but nothing came of this. In the Lords he was not a prominent speaker, but he attended assiduously and in his speeches generally supported &#145;country&#146; causes. In 1621 he urged that the recusancy statutes be vigorously enforced and that the notorious monopolist Sir Giles Mompesson be openly indicted; in 1624 he proposed that Lord Treasurer Cranfield's estates be made liable for the damages he had incurred; and in 1626 he drew attention to criticisms of Buckingham's performance as lord admiral. Where Spencer made his greatest mark, however, was in the local politics of Northamptonshire.<br>
<br>Spencer's wealth, prestige, and extensive landholdings made him the most influential figure in the western half of the county, if not in the shire as a whole. He used this to good effect in parliamentary elections. In 1603 he campaigned for county seats for himself and Sir Edward Montagu (later first Baron Montagu of Boughton), against opposition from Sir Anthony Mildmay, and seems to have been more or less assured of election at the point when he was granted his peerage. In the election of 1624 he succeeded in overturning the convention that one knight be chosen from each half of the shire by securing election for his puritan friend Richard Knightley, and his son Sir William Spencer. The reason he gave for this to Montagu&#151;that &#145;the papists will work hard in this parliament&#146; and it was therefore necessary to support candidates who would staunchly oppose them  (<span class="italic">Montagu of Beaulieu MSS</span>, 106)&#151;revealed much about his political priorities. In the election of 1626 he again clashed with Montagu and the magnates in the east of the shire and again came out on top, using his influence to help secure the election of another puritan, Sir John Pickering. Later in the year he made perhaps his most significant intervention in local politics by resisting the forced loan. During November it was widely reported that he was refusing to co-operate with the levy, along with fifteen other peers, including two of his closest friends, the Leicestershire magnates Henry, Lord Grey of Groby, and Henry Hastings, fifth earl of Huntingdon. He probably shared the views of his son Sir William, who early in 1626 was alleged to have declared at a meeting of the deputy lieutenants that &#145;the king wanted no money, and if he did he might call a parliament&#146;  (BL, Spencer MS A2). His defiance went unpunished and set an example for widespread refusal of the loan in Northamptonshire early in 1627.<br>
<br>Such evidence of his religious views as survives suggests that Spencer was a staunch Calvinist, although rather less zealous than someone like his friend Knightley. He was described in his funeral sermon, by the Calvinist Richard Parre, as one of &#145;God's Saints&#146; and was praised for &#145;the great encouragement and countenance he gave to the ministers of God&#146;  (Parre, 21&#150;2). When account is taken of the extent of his patronage, his support of godly ministers was not in fact as conspicuous as it might have been. Nevertheless, as his interventions in county elections demonstrated, there was little doubt that he broadly aligned himself with the godly.<br>
<br>In other respects, too, Spencer sought to present himself as the archetypal country peer. According to Parre he was renowned for his &#145;careful frugality&#146;. He did not get caught up in the Jacobean fashion for showy building projects, and in 1618 turned down an earldom when it was offered to him for &pound;10,000. His hospitality was said to be bountiful but not ostentatious, something borne out by his household accounts. He also had a reputation for generously helping the poor, and as a wise master to his tenants and servants and a trusted arbiter of local disputes. When Grey and Huntingdon became locked in a quarrel in the early part of James's reign he intervened to mediate between them. Finally he shared the contemporary passion for genealogy, corresponding with William Camden about tracing his family tree and earning a tribute for his &#145;singular &hellip; skill in antiquities, arms, alliances&#146;  (Parre, 24). His funeral elegy described him as &#145;the pattern of a perfect man&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Muses Thankfulness</span>).<br>
<br>Spencer did not marry again after his wife, Margaret, died in August 1597 leaving him with four sons and three daughters. He died at Wormleighton on 25 October 1627 and his body was taken back to the family chapel at Great Brington, Northamptonshire, where he was buried on 6 November next to the monument he had erected to his wife. He was succeeded by his second, and eldest surviving, son, Sir William.<br>
