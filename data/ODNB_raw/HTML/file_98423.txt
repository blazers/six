<span class="headword">Jones,  Arthur Stuart  Duncan-</span>  (1879&#150;1955), <span class="occ">dean of Chichester</span>, was born Arthur Stuart Jones at Mayfield, Oldham Above Town, Lancashire, on 25 April 1879, the son of Duncan Llewellyn Davies Jones, curate at St James's Church, Oldham, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Griffith. The family left Oldham in 1881 for Lincolnshire, where his father held the curacy of Willoughby, before ill health led to retirement to Somerset and an early death in 1887, aged thirty-four.<br>
<br>Duncan-Jones (it is not clear exactly when he adopted a hyphenated surname) was educated at Pocklington School in Yorkshire and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he held a Hebrew scholarship and read oriental languages. After graduating in 1901 he was ordained deacon in 1904 and appointed chaplain and lecturer at Caius; and once priested (1905) he became a fellow and junior dean at Caius the following year. On 15 August 1907 he married Caroline Mary Stewart Roberts (<i>b</i>. 1887), daughter of the master of Caius, Ernest Stewart Roberts. In 1910 he was appointed dean of Caius, and examining chaplain to the bishop of Lincoln. The following year he was invited to be select preacher to the university (an office he also held in 1928 and 1932) and in 1912 became rector of Blofield, Norfolk, before moving in 1915 to Louth in Lincolnshire, also as rector. But his particular contribution to the Anglican church at large was already emergent: in 1913 he had initiated a summer school of church music at Oxford devoted to raising the musical standard of worship in parish churches, and when in 1916 a successor was sought to Percy Dearmer at St Mary the Virgin, Primrose Hill, Duncan-Jones was an obvious candidate, and was to stay there, other than a brief period (1928&#150;9) at St Paul's, Knightsbridge, until his preferment to the deanery at Chichester.<br>
<br>The new incumbent at Primrose Hill soon saw that his role was primarily that of maintaining a practice set by Dearmer, in which the beauty of the interior of the church and of its liturgy attracted worshippers from far afield. This challenge engaged him in much pastoral activity, but he found considerable energy for other ventures too. His Hulsean lectures at Cambridge were published as <span class="italic">Ordered Liberty, or, An Englishman's Belief in his Church</span> (1917); from 1916 he was secretary, later chairman, of the publications committee of the Alcuin Club (a society committed to the enrichment of worship through study of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>); and he wrote <span class="italic">Church Music</span> (1920), in which he explored his certainty that music in worship was a servant of the liturgy rather than an opportunity for &#145;a choir effect&#146;. In 1921 he was secretary of a meeting at Central Hall, Westminster, to appeal to all Christians for a new spirit in approaching the Irish question. He was a leader writer and assistant editor of the <span class="italic">Guardian: the Church Newspaper</span> (1923&#150;38), and the author of <span class="italic">Archbishop Laud</span> (1927).<br>
<br>Aspects of each of these ventures&#151;crucially, Englishness, liturgical innovation, and the application of Christian principles to political and social questions&#151;were to form the central thrust of Duncan-Jones's ministry at Chichester, where he became dean in 1929. Chichester (the city and the cathedral) soon discovered a new presence in its midst: within weeks clergy ministering in the sanctuary at services were replaced by young male servers; partygoers at the Sussex Folk Dance Club in the Corn Exchange discovered the new dean dancing among them; and for Whitsuntide 1930, the first red-letter celebration he was able to plan <i>ab initio</i>, a festival of music and dance was held to raise funds for repairs to the fabric at the cathedral. Gustav Holst contributed to the music, and 240 singers and dancers demonstrated within and without the cathedral the &#145;beauty of the universe in terms of sound [and movement], the glory of God [being] too great to be expressed in words&#146;, as Duncan-Jones wrote  (<span class="italic">Sussex Daily News</span>, 28 Oct 1930). The festival was widely acclaimed and the cathedral began to be known as a &#145;people's cathedral&#146;.<br>
<br>Duncan-Jones's vigour and innovation extended in many directions: to lecturing in America; to leading the first compline broadcast by the BBC (on 30 March 1930), with reference in the service to the Chichester poet William Collins; to establishing regular services specifically for children, and for holidaymakers; to sending financial succour to unemployed miners in co. Durham; to leading the first ever watch night service; to promoting the value of the League of Nations, working as chairman of its Christian organizations committee and preaching in Geneva at the nineteenth assembly of the league; to appointing himself headmaster of, and revitalizing, the prebendal school, essentially the choir school of the cathedral; to promoting the first-known showing of a film in a cathedral (scenes of life in the Holy Land); to commissioning a pageant, <span class="italic">The Acts of St Richard</span>, performed twice in his lifetime (1933 and 1953); and, after the war, to leading the annual service of remembrance at the Albert Hall and gathering together his liturgical practice in the <span class="italic">Chichester Customary</span> (1948), a volume that had an impact on worship in cathedrals across the country &#145;much in the way that Dearmer's <span class="italic">Parson's Handbook</span> had done in parishes almost fifty years beforehand&#146;  (Foster, 60).<br>
<br>If the <span class="italic">Customary</span> is Duncan-Jones's most enduring literary legacy, he is also remembered in a stone let into the floor of the retro-quire, adjacent to the altar of St Richard that he did so much to promote. The inscription reads <i>Lucerna ardens et lucens</i> (&#145;A burning and shining light&#146;; <span class="roman">St John</span> 5:35); and it was a tongue of fire from that light that had led him to fly to Berlin in July 1933 to meet Hitler to determine his intentions. Later, in an essay under the title &#145;The crooked cross&#146; in <span class="italic">England Speaks</span> (1941), he denounced all aspects of Nazism, alongside writers as established as C. E. M. Joad, Harold Laski, A. A. Milne, and E. M. Forster, as he had in the earlier <span class="italic">The Struggle for Religious Freedom in Germany</span> (1938). This same Christian patriotism had determined in the early 1930s that a table of fifteen portrait corbels should complete the restoration of the cathedral's fourteenth-century great south transept window. The subjects for the portraits were national (Baldwin and Ramsay Macdonald) and local (the bishop, George Bell, and the cathedral canons, and also the architect, the builder, and the foreman in charge on site). In acknowledgement of this recognition of professional skill and trade craft, the man who carved the portraits <i>in situ</i> started his work with two portraits in the centre&#151;George V and, at his right hand, Duncan-Jones himself.<br>
<br>After suffering a heart attack on 12 January 1955 Duncan-Jones was taken to the Royal West Sussex Hospital, where he died on 19 January. He was cremated at Downs crematorium, Brighton, on 24 January. At his funeral service, held at Chichester Cathedral on 22 January, Bishop Bell (with whom relationships had always been difficult) gave what the local paper headlined as a &#145;glowing tribute&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chichester Observer</span>, 28 Jan 1955). He was survived by his wife, and by his six sons and two daughters.<br>
