<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lefevre,  Charles  Shaw-</span>, Viscount Eversley  (1794&#150;1888), <span class="occ">speaker of the House of Commons</span>, was born on 22 February 1794 in Bedford Square, London. He was the eldest son of Charles Shaw, a barrister, of a Yorkshire family, and MP for Reading from 1802 to 1820, and his wife, Helena, only daughter of John Lefevre, a member of a Huguenot family long settled at Heckfield Place, Hartfordbridge, Hampshire; on their marriage the family name became Shaw-Lefevre. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25275/', "Sir John Shaw-Lefevre")</script> was Charles's younger brother.<br>
<br>Shaw-Lefevre was educated at Winchester College, and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1815, and MA in 1819; he was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1819, but practised very little. &#145;Only fit to be a gamekeeper&#146; was his mother's verdict on her son, an excellent shot. On 24 June 1817 he married Emma Laura (<i>d</i>. 1857), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29231/', "Samuel Whitbread")</script>, and his wife, Elizabeth (daughter of the first Earl Grey). They had three sons, none living beyond the age of six, and three daughters. His relations with his wife later deteriorated, only her death preventing a formal separation.<br>
<br>Shaw-Lefevre at once took to politics, and in 1820 was active in his brother-in-law Samuel Whitbread's contest for Middlesex, but from his father's death in 1823 he lived mainly at Heckfield Place in Hampshire, interesting himself in county business and the yeomanry. In 1830 he entered parliament for Lord Radnor's pocket borough of Downton in Wiltshire, and in 1831, after a severe contest, was returned for Hampshire. The county was divided into two constituencies by the act of 1832, and from then until his elevation to the peerage, he sat for the northern division. He was a steady supporter of the whig government, but though he moved the address in 1834, he spoke rarely. For some years he was chairman of a committee on petitions for private bills, and in 1835 was chairman of a committee on agricultural distress. He was chairman of the select committee on procedure in 1838, and carried his report almost unanimously. By attending closely to the work of these committees and to the forms of the house, and by his natural fair-mindedness and good temper, he gained a reputation which led to his selection in 1839, in spite of Spring-Rice's claims to be the government candidate, to succeed Abercromby in the speaker's chair. He was the only candidate certain of radical support, and was thus the choice of the party rather than of its leaders. He was elected in a full house on 27 May by 317 votes to 299 for Henry Goulburn. He was re-elected in 1841, in spite of Peel's possession of a majority which could easily have ousted him, and again in 1847 and 1852, on each occasion unanimously. He proved himself a speaker of distinction. He set himself to reform procedure, and during the stormy debates on Irish questions in O'Connell's time, and afterwards on free trade, maintained order firmly and impartially. He was very dignified, strong, and tactful, and the business of the house benefited greatly by his election. Asked how he selected members to speak, he replied: &#145;Well, I have been shooting rabbits all my life, and have learnt to mark the right one&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 29 Dec 1888). A volume of his decisions was published by Robert Bourke in 1857, and to Shaw-Lefevre is due the removal of many unsuitable forms now forgotten. In the same year, having served longer than any speaker except Onslow, he decided to retire, and withdrew on 11 March.<br>
<br>Shaw-Lefevre was raised to the peerage on 11 April as Viscount Eversley of Heckfield, and received a pension. He was nominated a church estates commissioner, which office he resigned in 1859 on becoming an ecclesiastical commissioner, and was a trustee of the British Museum. He declined the governor-generalship of Canada in 1861 and in 1867 chaired the Parliamentary Boundary Commission consequent on the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> of that year. He was president of the Royal Agricultural Society in 1863, and of the Statistical Society from 1877 to 1879. Though often present, he rarely spoke in the House of Lords; he was high steward of Winchester, governor and lord lieutenant of the Isle of Wight, colonel of the Hampshire yeomanry, and until July 1879 was chairman of quarter sessions. He was made a GCB in 1885. He took a keen interest in shooting and in agriculture, and, looked after by his unmarried daughter, Emma Laura, was active almost until his death. He died on 28 December 1888 at his house, Heckfield Place, in Hampshire, but was buried beside his wife at Kensal Green cemetery, London, on 2 January 1889.<br>
