<span class="headword">Corrie,  Daniel</span>  (1777&#150;1837), <span class="occ">bishop of Madras</span>, was born at Ardchattan, Argyll, on 10 April 1777, the second son of John Corrie and his wife, Anne McNab. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6352/', "George Elwes Corrie (1793&#150;1885)")</script>, eventually his biographer, was a younger brother. His father was for many years curate of Colsterworth and vicar of Osbournby in Lincolnshire, and afterwards rector of Morcott in Rutland. Daniel appears to have received his early education partly at home and partly at the house of a friend of his father in London. He then went into residence at Cambridge, first at Clare College in October 1799 and afterwards from 1800 as an exhibitioner at Trinity Hall. He was ordained deacon in 1802 and priest in 1804, and graduated LLB in 1805. While at Cambridge he came under the influence of Charles Simeon, which affected him for the remainder of his life and led to his appointment to a chaplaincy in Bengal in 1806.<br>
<br>Corrie reached Calcutta in September 1806. He became the guest of the Bengal chaplain, David Brown, at whose house he renewed his friendship with Henry Martyn. During the following eight or nine years he held various chaplaincies in the North-Western Provinces, including those of Chunar, Cawnpore, and Agra, in all of them carrying out missionary work in addition to his duties as chaplain to the British troops. He founded churches and schools and did much to nurture the growth of the Anglican church in north India. He was a great supporter of the Church Missionary Society (CMS), of which he was a governor, and this led to tension with Bishop Middleton. He was a superior scholar in Hindi, which he wrote with elegance and spoke with ease. He translated a number of works into Hindi. On 16 November 1812 at Barrackpore he married Elizabeth Myers (1789&#150;1836), only child of William Myers and Hannah Ayres. They had four children; a son and daughter died in infancy.<br>
<br>In 1815 Corrie was compelled by the state of his health, which had suffered much from the Indian climate, to visit England. The CMS asked him to preach and speak on its behalf and in 1816 he gave the anniversary sermon. He returned to India in 1817 and was soon promoted to the senior chaplaincy at Calcutta, where, first as secretary to the local CMS committee and afterwards as president of the Church Missionary Association, he continued his active services to the missionary cause. In 1823 he was appointed by Bishop Heber as archdeacon of Calcutta, in which capacity the administration of the diocese devolved upon him at three different times, following the deaths of Bishop Heber (1826), Bishop James (1828), and Bishop Turner (1831). In 1835, Madras and Bombay having been constituted separate sees under the <span class="roman">Charter Act</span> of 1833, Corrie was appointed the first bishop of Madras; he began his duties on 28 October 1835. He survived his installation little more than fifteen months, and died a few weeks after his wife, at Madras, after a few days' illness, on 5 February 1837; but short as the period was, it was long enough to impress the community of the Madras presidency with a very high estimate of the piety, devotion, and untiring zeal with which he had discharged his duties. After his death subscriptions were collected to erect a monument in the cathedral at Madras and to endow scholarships in the grammar school he had recently founded. Corrie's devotion to missionary work is enshrined in Weekes's impressive statue in the cathedral. Similarly in Bengal his thirty years of service were commemorated by marble slabs in two of the churches in which he had long been accustomed to minister, and scholarships were named after him in the Calcutta high school. As a missionary chaplain Corrie ranks with David Brown, Claudius Buchanan, Henry Martyn, and Thomas Thomason. A gentle and humble man of great generosity, Corrie left his family poor by his gifts to others. Bishop Wilson, in his funeral oration, paid tribute to the much loved and respected Corrie as &#145;the parent of the CMS in India, the centre of union and the soul of all its operations&#146;.<br>
