<span class="headword">Pepys,  William Hasledine</span>  (1775&#150;1856), <span class="occ">surgical instrument maker and natural philosopher</span>, was born on 23 March 1775, one of two surviving sons of William Hasledine Pepys (1748&#150;1805), cutler and surgical instrument maker of the Poultry, London, and his wife, Letitia Weedon. The family claimed descent from Sir Richard Pepys (1588&#150;1659), lord chief justice of Ireland. Nothing is known of Pepys's education, but he was among the group of young men interested in the new sciences who founded in 1796 the Askesian Society. He was a founder in 1805 and first secretary of the London Institution, and active in the British Mineralogical Society, founded in 1799, which in 1807 merged with the Askesian Society to form the Geological Society of London. Pepys was active and held office in all these groups; his skill in building apparatus for chemical and electrochemical investigations was important in advancing the sciences which underpinned the members' interests. An autobiographical note relates, &#145;The first experiments I made were in the early part of my life. I commenced with fermentations &hellip; the methods required for their production brought me acquainted with gaseous fluids, and a great field was opened to me &hellip; one experiment suggested another, and in the pursuit, discoveries were made that were not expected&#146;  (Royal Society, MS 155). When the new metal platinum was finding its way into scientific instrument workshops Pepys and his friends in the Mineralogical Society undertook electrical experiments with it. In May 1805 Pepys made up a platinum fruit knife which he presented to Sir Joseph Banks, and in June he presented two similar knives to George III.<br>
<br>Pepys succeeded to his father's business and extended it to scientific instrument making. He followed his father in the Cutlers' Company, becoming twice master during the 1820s, and he was in later years a benefactor to the Cutlers' charities. His work and interests brought him into contact with several Quaker scientists, notably William Allen and Luke Howard, though Pepys himself was a lifelong practising Anglican. With Allen he developed apparatus for researches into respiration in man, animals, and plants, which laid the basis for understanding the chemistry of that process. Mineralogy led him to the blowpipe for analysis of various minerals and of human teeth. In the new field of electrical technology Pepys investigated atmospheric electricity with Howard, delved into magnetism with Humphry Davy and others, and undertook the construction of several large batteries which he made available for electromagnetic researches.<br>
<br>Pepys married, on 21 September 1815 at Waltham Abbey, Lydia (<i>d</i>. 1851), an under-age daughter of Robert Walton. They had seven children: five daughters, of whom two died young, and two sons; William Hasledine Pepys (1817&#150;1880) settled in Cologne and Robert Edmond (1819&#150;1883) continued the business until 1863 when the Poultry shops were demolished for redevelopment.<br>
<br>Pepys enjoyed a long and influential relationship with the Royal Institution, from the time when Count Rumford proposed him as a proprietor in 1800 until 1846. Thereafter he served on the permanent committee set up to deal with chemical investigations undertaken in the institution's laboratory. In 1812 he directed John Newman, the institution's instrument maker, in a comprehensive overhaul of the institution's apparatus and the purchase of necessary new items. In 1814 he was elected as a visitor, in 1815 a manager, and in 1821 he became its secretary. In 1828 he joined the committee for regulating the discourses and lectures, and in 1830 the accounts committee. In February 1830 the institution awarded him the Fuller gold medal for his chemical researches and improvement of chemical apparatus. Pepys's experiments lacked originality but he was adept at devising and constructing apparatus. He was among the first to use mercury contacts for electrical apparatus, and to employ rubber-coated tubes for conveying gas. His eudiometer, air-holder, and mercury gasometer had proved useful for research into the constitution of air and gases, his researches into combustion of diamond, graphite, charcoal, and various metallic ores had commercial potential, and his work with Allen on respiration contributed to medical knowledge.<br>
<br>The London Institution, modelled on the Royal Institution, was established in 1805, its proprietors drawn from trade and industry. At first it offered members only a library, but in 1819 it moved into new purpose-built premises in Finsbury Circus, with a laboratory designed and equipped by Pepys, and he carried out many of his investigations there. He designed its great battery, built up from 2000 double plates. From 1819 until its plates finally corroded in 1835 it was used by other scientists, Davy and Brande among them, for experiments and demonstrations. In 1823 Pepys designed a huge single cell for the London Institution, each plate measuring 50 by 2 feet.<br>
<br>Pepys was elected FRS in 1808 and he published occasionally in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>, but the majority of his numerous articles appeared in Tilloch's <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span>. He was elected to the Society of Arts in 1801, and served on its chemistry committee from 1850. He was a member of the Pitt Club from 1822, of the Royal Asiatic Society from 1823, and was also a member of the Athenaeum. Pepys died at his house in Earl's Terrace, Kensington, London, on 17 August 1856.<br>
