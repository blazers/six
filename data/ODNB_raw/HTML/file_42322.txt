<span class="headword">Luce, Sir  William Henry Tucker</span>  (1907&#150;1977), <span class="occ">colonial administrator and diplomatist</span>, was born on 25 August 1907 at Odcombe, Anglesey Road, Alverstoke, Hampshire, the son of Admiral John David Luce (1870&#150;1932) and his wife, Mary Dorothea, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Tucker (1873&#150;1965). He was one of four sons; his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65602/', "(John) David Luce")</script> served from 1963 to 1966 as chief of naval staff and first sea lord. Educated at Clifton College, Bristol, and Christ's College, Cambridge, where he read history and modern languages, he married Margaret Napier (1908&#150;1989), daughter of Vice-Admiral Sir Trevylyan Napier, on 7 April 1934. They had two children, Richard (<i>b</i>. 1936) and Diana (<i>b</i>. 1939).<br>
<br>Despite his naval background Luce spurned a career at sea in favour of one in colonial administration, entering the Sudan political service in 1930. Something of an anomaly in the British empire, Sudan, under an agreement signed in 1899, was in theory administered jointly by Britain and Egypt, although in practice the former was firmly in control. Luce rose steadily through the Sudan political service, becoming private secretary to the governor-general in 1941, deputy governor of Equatoria province in 1950, governor of Blue Nile province and director of the Sudan Gezira board the following year, and finally adviser to the governor-general on constitutional and external affairs in 1953. It was in this last position that he perhaps exercised his greatest influence in Sudan as it moved rapidly towards full independence. An astute observer of the political scene, he developed good working relations with members of the first Sudanese government, which came into being at the beginning of 1954. He also prudently informed Sudan's first prime minister, Ismail al-Azhari, that &#145;every British official desired that the Sudanese should govern themselves&#146;  (Johnson, 2.310).<br>
<br>The systemic fault lines that divided the primarily Arab, Muslim north from the African, Christian south threatened not merely to fracture Sudan's fragile unity but also to derail the country's progress towards independent status. A mutiny on 18 August 1955 of southern soldiers based at Torit&#151;first reported to London by Luce&#151;appeared to confirm the worst fears of those who doubted Sudan's future as a single state. Luce, however, baulked at the idea of British and Egyptian troops being deployed to restore order, arguing that their appearance would &#145;destroy all hope of any settlement between the North and the South in the foreseeable future&#146;  (Johnson, 2.440). Luce himself travelled to Torit to try to negotiate the mutineers' surrender. Despite the fact that many of them either fled to the bush or crossed into neighbouring Uganda, Sudan's progress towards independence was not slowed. This was entirely to Luce's satisfaction. A month before independence he had impressed upon the Foreign Office that &#145;the sooner self-determination is completed, the better the future of the Sudan as a whole, and for Anglo-Sudanese relations&#146;  (ibid., 2.498).<br>
<br>Once Luce left the Sudan political service on Sudanese independence, it made sense for him, as an Arabist, to serve in the Arab world, and in 1956 he was appointed governor of Aden. His predecessor, Sir Tom Hickinbotham, had championed a constitutional scheme that would have federated the small states, or protectorates, in Aden's hinterland. Initially Luce was sceptical, arguing that:<blockquote>So far there has been no really effective support for federation among the [protectorate] Rulers and any attempt to impose it upon them would only bedevil our relations with most of them, and so weaken our influence with them. (Smith, &#145;Rulers and residents&#146;, 518)</blockquote>Once a number of protectorate rulers began calling for a British-backed federation to safeguard themselves in the face of hostility from neighbouring Yemen (which had joined Egypt and Syria to form the United Arab States in March 1958) Luce, once more showing the flexibility that defined his approach to colonial problems, abandoned his previous caution.<blockquote>I believe that federation now offers the best hope of retaining our influence in the Protectorate for a number of years to come, and thus enable constitutional development to self-government and self-determination to proceed as peacefully as possible. (ibid., 519)</blockquote>On 11 February 1959 the much-delayed federation of western protectorate states was formally established. As a means of protecting British interests in southern Arabia, Luce also strongly backed the concept of merger between the federation and Aden colony, which eventually came to fruition under his successor, Sir Charles Johnston. Although Luce's hopes were largely dashed (Britain withdrawing from southern Arabia at the end of 1967 against the background of the toppling of its monarchical allies and the crumbling of the federal structures he had helped to put in place), from the perspective of the late 1950s the creation of a federation from disparate territories in an effort to sustain British influence was an entirely pragmatic and shrewd enterprise.<br>
<br>Luce's departure from Aden in 1960 was followed by his appointment as political resident in the Persian Gulf in 1961. This role required him to co-ordinate British policy towards, and relations with, the states of the region, especially the small Gulf sheikhdoms with which Britain still enjoyed treaty relations as the protecting power. During his tenure he was a staunch defender of Britain's continuing military and political presence in the gulf in the face of growing scepticism in Whitehall, not least from the Treasury. He was also not averse to engaging in old-style colonialism more akin to that of the nineteenth century in order to preserve British interests. The most glaring example of this was his agitation for the removal of Sheikh Shakhbut, ruler of oil-rich Abu Dhabi, and his replacement with his more progressive brother, Sheikh Zayed. Shortly after Luce's departure from the Gulf in July 1966 Shakhbut, with the blessing of British officials, was ousted by Zayed in a bloodless coup.<br>
<br>In retirement Luce took up a number of commercial directorships, but retained his interest in the Persian Gulf. With the announcement in early 1968 by the Labour government of its intention to withdraw British troops from east of Suez by the end of 1971, the necessity of fostering unity among the small gulf sheikhdoms became still more urgent. Shortly after Labour's announcement Luce visited the gulf, concluding that &#145;in spite of all these great difficulties, I am convinced that federation offers the best hope&#146;  (notebook, &#145;Tour of the gulf&#146;, 18 April&#150;6 May 1968, Luce papers).<br>
<br>Luce was tempted out of retirement in 1970 by the newly elected Conservative government, becoming the foreign and Commonwealth secretary's personal representative for gulf affairs. In opposition the Conservatives had committed themselves to reversing Labour's withdrawal decision. The pragmatism that had become Luce's hallmark, however, ensured that this unrealistic commitment was dropped. In his report, submitted towards the end of 1970, Luce argued that British withdrawal should take place as planned and that failure to honour this would create &#145;dangers for the stability of the area&#146;  (Smith, <span class="italic">Britain's Revival and Fall</span>, 36). Even if a viable union of small British-protected sheikhdoms of the lower gulf proved elusive, Luce argued, the notion of extending British protection and responsibility for their external affairs should be rejected. On the one hand it would be a &#145;fallacy to think that the prolongation would provide further opportunity to bring about a viable Union&#146;; on the other, &#145;HMG would be entering into a hazardous commitment with no positive advantages to be gained&#146;  (ibid., 37). Luce's views carried considerable weight with the Conservative government, which resolved to enact withdrawal according to the timeframe established by its predecessor. Luce was left with the task of fostering unity among the small sheikhdoms of the lower gulf and resolving long-standing territorial disputes, not least Iran's claims to the gulf islands of Abu Musa and the Tunbs. That he was only partially successful is more a reflection of the intractability of the problems he faced than of genuine failure on his part.<br>
<br>During his second retirement Luce once more held a number of commercial directorships as well as occasionally entering into lively correspondence over gulf matters. For instance he remonstrated with the author Leonard Mosley about the gulf chapter in his book <span class="italic">Power Play</span> (1973), observing &#145;I see you have written books on a wide variety of subjects. If they are all as inaccurate as this chapter your record for misleading the public must be unique&#146;  (Luce to Mosley, 28 Dec 1973, Luce papers).<br>
<br>Although to some extent overshadowed by his elder brother, Admiral Sir David Luce, William Luce was one of the more significant figures in British decolonization, playing an important role in the end of empire in Sudan and southern Arabia, and a seminal one with respect to the Persian Gulf. He was appointed KBE in 1956, KCMG in 1957, and GBE in 1961. He died of a heart attack on 7 July 1977 at his home, Brook House, Fovant, near Salisbury; a memorial service was held at St Margaret's Church, Westminster, on 27 July. In commemoration of his long and distinguished career a memorial fund was established in his name at the University of Durham. His son, Richard, was a Conservative MP before following his father into colonial administration, becoming governor of Gibraltar in 1997, and being made a life peer in 2000.<br>
