<span class="headword">Radcliffe,  Charles Bland</span>  (1822&#150;1889), <span class="occ">physician</span>, born at Brigg, Lincolnshire, on 2 June 1822, was the eldest son of Charles Radcliffe, a Wesleyan Methodist minister. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22987/', "John Netten Radcliffe (1826&#150;1884)")</script> was his younger brother. He completed his education, begun at home, in the grammar school at Batley, near Leeds, and was subsequently apprenticed to Mr Hall, a general practitioner, at Wortley. He finished his medical training in Leeds, Paris (where he studied under Claude Bernard), and London. He graduated MB at London University in 1845, when he is said to have been the first student from a provincial medical school to have been awarded a gold medal, and graduated MD in 1851. In the same year he married Mary Reece Urling, daughter of George Frederick Urling, lace manufacturer; there were no children. He became a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians in 1848, and was elected a fellow in 1858. He was Goulstonian lecturer in 1860 and Croonian lecturer in 1873. He subsequently became a councillor of the College of Physicians, and in 1875&#150;6 he acted as censor.<br>
<br>In 1853 Radcliffe was appointed assistant physician to the Westminster Hospital, where he became full physician in 1857, and was elected to the consulting staff in 1873. He lectured on botany and materia medica in the medical school attached to the hospital. In 1863 he was appointed physician to the National Hospital for the Paralysed and Epileptic in Queen Square, London, in succession to Charles Brown-S&eacute;quard, and it was in connection with this institution, and the diseases of the nervous system, that Radcliffe's name was best known. He was a prolific writer, publishing works on vital motion, epilepsy, and disorders of the nervous system. Between 1845 and 1873 he was also joint editor with W. H. Ranking of Ranking's <span class="italic">Abstract of Medical Sciences</span>.<br>
<br>Radcliffe was one of the earliest investigators in Britain of the electrical physiology of muscle and nerve, but he was more a theorist than an experimentalist. Sir John Burdon-Sanderson claimed that Radcliffe was essentially a vitalist, but in his doctrine electricity took the place of the vital principle. Radcliffe had a great interest in music, architecture, and theology, and was a devout if unorthodox Christian. He was a friend of Frederick Denison Maurice, the founder of Christian socialism. He died suddenly at his home, 25 Cavendish Square, London, on 18 June 1889 and was buried in Highgate cemetery.<br>
