<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cooke family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1800&#150;1865), <span class="occ">engravers, artists, and publishers</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_6191"></a><span class="headword">William Bernard Cooke</span>  (1778&#150;1855)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born in Charles Street, Hatton Garden, London, the son of a German immigrant confectioner from Frankfurt am Main, Johann Bernhard Guck, who changed his name to John Bernard Cooke. His mother was Maria Anna White (<i>d</i>. 1821). An older brother of <a href="#cosubject_6161">George Cooke [<i>see below</i>]</a>, with whom he frequently worked, W. B. Cooke was apprenticed to William Angus, engraver of <span class="italic">The Seats of the Nobility and Gentry in Great Britain and Wales</span> (1787&#150;[1800]). He married, on 12 April 1804, Elizabeth Blundstone (<i>d</i>. 1830); there were no surviving children. His second wife was a sister of Anastasia Cromek, wife of the watercolourist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6752/', "Robert Hartley Cromek")</script>, whose maiden name was Priestman; they married in 1831, and she died in 1840.<br>
<br>William Bernard Cooke was employed on John Norris Brewer's <span class="italic">The Beauties of England and Wales</span> (1805), and much of his work thereafter was in the same vein. Sir Henry Charles Englefield, bt, chose W. B. and George Cooke to engrave the illustrations to his <span class="italic">A description of the principal picturesque beauties, antiquities, and geological phenomena of the Isle of Wight and coast of Dorset</span> (1816) because of their truth to the original drawings and absence of engravers' invention.<br>
<br>W. B. Cooke opened a print gallery and shop at 9 Soho Square, London, with an exhibition entitled &#145;Engraving by Living British Artists under the Patronage of His Majesty&#146; (1821), the catalogue claiming that:<blockquote>The Professors of the interesting and highly useful art have long felt the necessity [of] &hellip; direct communication with its Patrons and Admirers &hellip; and have invited their Brothers to co-operate by sending their work &hellip; Under such auspices the British School of Engraving may confidently hope to arrive at a higher degree of Public estimation. (p. 1)</blockquote>Subsequent exhibitions included drawings, some loaned by private collectors and some for sale, in 1822, 1823, and 1824.<span class="italic">Picturesque Views of the Southern Coast of England</span> (1814&#150;26) totalled forty-eight plates and thirty-two vignettes chiefly after drawings commissioned from J. M. W. Turner who closely supervised the proofs. Drawings by Alexander, F. L. T. Francia, Havell, Samuel Prout, and William Westall were included. The copperplates were engraved by, among others, W. B. and G. Cooke, E. Finden, E. Goodall, and W. Miller. It was acknowledged as a high point in the monochrome reproduction of watercolour drawings. The engravers worked in the line manner but were:<blockquote>a school truly indigenous, both in its style and its technical means &hellip; not &hellip; line-engraving at all, as practically all the work was done by etching &hellip; a wriggling wormlike line which is absolutely opposed to all the reasonable possibilities and conventions of graver work &hellip; in such contrast to the true ideals of the etcher's art that we would still be content to call its exponents line-engravers. (Hind, 221&#150;2)</blockquote>W. B. Cooke's dealings with Turner and John Constable show him to have had a keen business sense. His reputation rested on topographical, especially marine or coastal, subjects, and on antiquarian interests. Typical are Turner's five <span class="italic">Views in Sussex</span> (1819), Thomas Allason's <span class="italic">Picturesque Views of the Antiquities of Pola in Istria</span> (1819), James Hakewill's <span class="italic">A Picturesque Tour of Italy</span> (1820), T. L. Donaldson's <span class="italic">Pompeii &hellip; Including Recent Excavations</span> (1827), and <span class="italic">Vases, Altars &amp;c from the &hellip; Louvre</span> (1828), drawn by W. B. Cooke and Thomas Boys, and engraved by Henry Moses. W. B. Cooke's apprentices were Frederick Smith, J. C. Allen, and W. Brandard. Samuel Redgrave wrote that he showed great ability and enterprise, published &#145;several of his own plates&#146;, but did not succeed  (Redgrave, <span class="italic">Artists</span>, 96), a somewhat harsh verdict repeated by R. E. Graves. William Bernard Cook died at his home, 9 Camden Square, Camberwell, on 2 August 1855, of heart disease, and was buried on 8 August in Nunhead cemetery, London. His executors were Thomas Goff Lupton, engraver, and son.<br>

<a name="cosubject_6161"></a><span class="headword">George Cooke</span>  (1781&#150;1834)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 22 January 1781 in Charles Street, Hatton Garden, London, a younger brother of W. B. Cooke, and apprenticed to James Basire (1769&#150;1822) in 1795. He married, on 26 October 1808, Elizabeth Harriet Eglinton (1785&#150;1882), with whom he had eleven children, the second being the marine painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6160/', "Edward William Cooke RA (1811&#150;1880)")</script>. George Cooke's wife kept a boarding-school, Albion House, Barnes, at which the daughters of Clarkson Stanfield RA and David Roberts RA were pupils and where he was drawing-master. His indentured apprentices were George Hollis, John Barnett, <a href="#cosubject_6193">W. J. Cooke [<i>see below</i>]</a>, W. Miller, Thomas Shotter Boys, Percy Heath, Theo Lindsey Aspland, and F. R. Hay.<br>
<br>Basire, remembered as a neglectful master, produced for the <span class="italic">Oxford Almanack</span> engravings of drawings by J. M. W. Turner, and George Cooke's enthusiasm for these led him to plan a published series of that artist's watercolours. He engraved fifteen of the plates for Turner's <span class="italic">Picturesque Views of the Southern Coast of England</span> (1814&#150;26) but a disagreement with Turner over the disposal of proofs led to an acrimonious severing of relations. He worked with W. B. Cooke on many of the series mentioned above, and there were also 160 plates from his hand in John Pinkerton's <span class="italic">General Collection of Voyages and Travels</span> (1808&#150;14) in which he had to make acceptable pictures from &#145;mere tracings &hellip; &amp; abortions of art&#146;  (<span class="italic">Arnold's Magazine of the Fine Arts</span>, 1834, 555). He undertook the engraving of the 2000 aquatint plates for the publisher Conrad Loddiges &amp; Sons' work <span class="italic">The Botanical Cabinet</span> (20 vols., 1817&#150;33). His studio and family being fully employed in its regular appearance, he moved to a house adjoining the Loddiges at their Hackney nursery gardens.<br>
<br>George Cooke published <span class="italic">Views of London and its Vicinity</span>, in parts, in 1826&#150;34, planned to illustrate the developing metropolis; his painter friends gave him drawings for engraving for which his son Edward William had made preliminary outlines to save established artists, including A. W. Callcott, David Roberts, Clarkson Stanfield, and Samuel Prout, time and labour. Projected as eighty plates, on copper, it was overtaken by similar works quickly produced on steel plates which, whatever the quality, gave proofs of unvarying clarity. Conservative dislike of steel led him to avoid it but rivals using it outdistanced him and prospered. Cooke meanwhile doggedly maintained traditional high-quality proofs from copper, supervising printing to ensure the best results. However, he reduced <span class="italic">London</span> to forty-eight plates, the last number being published posthumously, by his widow.<br>
<br>A great many books of the 1820s contain plates of picturesque scenery and topographical interest from George Cooke's hand. <span class="italic">Sunderland Iron Bridge</span>, after Edward Blore, with &#145;effect&#146; by F. L. Francia, was produced for R. Surtees' <span class="italic">The History and Antiquities of &hellip; Durham</span>. He engraved after A. W. Callcott a view of Rotterdam, and had begun two further large plates of Antwerp and Dover, but by the failure of his agent in the financial crash of 1825&#150;6 he lost money, putting an end to the venture as well as straitening his circumstances. His <span class="italic">Views of the Old and the New London Bridges</span> (1833), from his son Edward's drawings, was engraved and etched conjointly; although the work was very well received, George Cooke's name does not appear on the title-page.<br>
<br>George Cooke was a member of the Associated Society of Engravers whose aims included securing recognition by the Royal Academy for engravers to be full academicians. They also embarked on engraving and publishing selected paintings in the National Gallery. Cooke was also a member of the Graphic Society, the Calcographic Society, and the Artists' Joint Stock Fund. He died on 27 February 1834 of brain fever at his home, Albion House, Terrace, Barnes, Surrey. He was buried in St Mary's Church, Barnes, on 6 March. He was remembered for his &#145;buoyancy of spirit, industry, perseverance, temperance and unsullied integrity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Arnold's Magazine of the Fine Arts</span>, 1834, 560).<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_6193"></a><span class="headword">William John Cooke</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1796, <em>d.</em> 1865), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was baptized in London on 5 April 1796, the son of John Conrad Cooke (<i>b</i>. 1770, <i>d</i>. before 1829), eldest brother of W. B. and G. Cooke, and his wife, Mary Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Harrison. He was apprenticed to his uncle George Cooke about 1810. He married in 1823 Mary Boys, sister of his fellow apprentice Thomas Shotter Boys, the lithographer.<br>
<br>A pioneer worker on steel, which his former master despised, W. J. Cooke won in 1826 the Isis gold medal of the Society of Arts for improvements in fluids for etching on steel and the invention of an &#145;apparatus for gradating tints&#146;. He engraved drawings by Richard Parkes Bonington whom he met in 1825 and with whom he remained friends. <span class="italic">Rouen from Bon Secours</span> and <span class="italic">Chillon</span>, both small in size, were published in <span class="italic">Friendship's Offering</span> in 1826. Cooke was a frequent visitor to the house of his former fellow apprentice John Barnett, where Bonington died in 1828.<br>
<br>William John Cooke engraved mainly for the annuals <span class="italic">The Gem</span>, <span class="italic">The Amulet</span>, <span class="italic">The Bouquet</span>, and <span class="italic">Friendship's Offering</span>. He also contributed plates to <span class="italic">Stanfield's Coast Scenery</span> by Clarkson Stanfield (1836) and the <span class="italic">Oriental Annual</span>, after works by W. Daniell (1834). He also engraved plates after J. M. W. Turner's drawings of Nottingham, Plymouth, Newark Castle (Scotland), and the Thames at Mortlake, and <span class="italic">Calais Pier</span>, after David Cox, which was engraved for the <span class="italic">Gallery of the Society of Painters in Water Colours</span> (1832). His work is sometimes signed W. Cooke Junr. A set of W. J. Cooke's pencil studies (priv. coll.) recording the ruins of the Palace of Westminster after the fire of 1834 was proposed for engraving jointly with his cousin Edward, but never carried out.<br>
<br>In 1840 the decline in the fashion for illustrated annuals and the possible adverse effect of photography upon engraving in England caused W. J. Cooke to move with his family to Darmstadt. He made topographical drawings in England and Germany, perhaps with publication in view but died in Darmstadt on 6 April 1865. His family later returned to England. His son William Montague Cooke (<i>b</i>. 1824) evidently inherited artistic talent for he gave drawing instruction to the children of Princess Alice, princess of Great Britain and Ireland, and grand duchess of Hesse and by Rhine.<br>
