<span class="headword">Davies,  Idris</span>  (1905&#150;1953), <span class="occ">poet and schoolteacher</span>, was born on 6 January 1905 at 16 Field Street, Rhymni, Monmouthshire, the elder child of Evan Davies (1881&#150;1947), a colliery winderman, and his wife, Elizabeth Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Williams (1884&#150;1971). In their home they spoke Welsh, as did some two-thirds of the town's population at that time; although most of Davies's work was written in English, which he learned at the local primary school, he read widely in Welsh, having studied it at evening classes, and wrote a little in the language, both verse and prose. An early influence on the young boy was his uncle Edward, a Calvinistic Methodist and liberal, who spoke very little English and introduced him to the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and contemporary politics. In later life Davies rejected Christianity in favour of an idealistic humanism, but as a boy he attended a Baptist chapel.<br>
<br>Davies left school at the age of fourteen, against his parents' wishes, to become a miner at the McClaren colliery in Abertyswg, Monmouthshire; he later regretted this decision not to receive secondary education. In the summer of 1920 he moved to the Maerdy pit in nearby Pontlotyn. Having been introduced to the work of Shelley by a workmate named Eddie Balman, he quickly perceived that poetry could relate to politics, particularly socialism. At this time, too, the shy, introverted, but humorous young man began what was to become a lifelong habit of wandering the moorlands above the town of Rhymni, the wild beauty of which contrasted sharply with the dereliction of the valley, and in which he was to find escape from the grim industrialism which he denounced so vehemently in his poetry. His first experience of industrial conflict came with the miners' strike of March&#150;July 1921 and the &#145;black Friday&#146; (15 April) on which the miners considered their cause to have been betrayed. Early in 1926, shortly before the general strike of that year, he lost the little finger of his left hand in an accident underground, and had barely resumed work after the seven-month stoppage when the closure of the pit forced him to consider other ways of earning a living. Although he was deeply committed to the miners' cause, he and his family were spared much of the hardship of the strike because his father remained in work as a safety man.<br>
<br>Now unemployed, Davies used his new-found leisure to attend lectures at the town's workmen's institute, where his political awareness was sharpened further, and he then took a correspondence course. After matriculating, he went on to study at Loughborough College and the University of Nottingham, qualifying as a teacher. In 1932 he began teaching at Laysterne junior school in Hoxton, in the East End of London. He remained in London for fifteen years (with the exception of the years of the Second World War) and, by now an avid reader of the work of both Welsh and English poets (particularly R. Williams Parry and A. E. Housman), was one of the expatriate Welsh writers who frequented Griff's Bookshop in Charing Cross Road. One of his closest friends at that time was Tom Buchanan, from Ayrshire, a fellow teacher with whom he went on walking holidays in Scotland, Ireland, and France.<br>
<br>A few of Davies's poems were published in newspapers in south Wales during the early 1930s, but his emergence as a poet coincided with the launch of the magazine <span class="italic">Wales</span>, edited by Keidrych Rhys, to which he became a regular contributor; he also contributed to London magazines such as the <span class="italic">Poetry Review</span> and <span class="italic">The Adelphi</span>. His first volume, <span class="italic">Gwalia deserta</span> (1938), took as its theme the desert of industrial south Wales during the depression of the inter-war years and established him as the voice of his generation; it includes &#145;The Bells of Rhymney&#146;, a poem which was set to music and made famous by the singing of Pete Seeger. In the year of its publication Davies gained a diploma in history from the University of London. At the outbreak of the Second World War his school was evacuated to Pytchley in Northamptonshire, and then to the villages of Meesden and Anstey in Hertfordshire; it was at Anstey, in June&#150;July 1941, that he wrote <span class="italic">The Angry Summer</span> (1943), &#145;a poem of 1926&#146;, which is regarded as his finest work. In April 1942 he returned to London, and taught at a school in Shoreditch. Later in the year he was moved again, this time to Treherbert in the Rhondda valley, where he stayed for two years and completed his third book, <span class="italic">Tonypandy and other Poems</span> (1945), which includes the long autobiographical ballad &#145;I was Born in Rhymni&#146;. In Treherbert he formed a close relationship with Morfydd Peregrine, a fellow teacher at Dunraven School. They never married, because she had an invalid mother whom she could not leave; the relationship was sometimes strained, as his diaries reveal, but they remained devoted to each other to the end of his life. Despite his sympathy with the working class, Davies was appalled by the materialism and vulgarity of the people in the Rhondda, and was not happy there. To his great relief, he was directed to a school in Llandysul in Cardiganshire at the beginning of 1945, where he was again in charge of a group of London evacuees, and was impressed by the high standard of the district's Welsh-speaking culture. He nevertheless had to return to London, to teach at Whitmore primary school and then at Wordsworth School in Stoke Newington. After many applications for a permanent post, in 1947 he obtained one at Cwmsyflog junior school, not far from his home in the Rhymni valley; he also taught English in evening classes at nearby Bargoed and Merthyr Tudful. His homecoming was something of a disappointment, however, for he found that Rhymni, having been for so long ravaged by unemployment, emigration, and social deprivation, now had a cultural life that compared unfavourably with the one he had known as a young man.<br>
<br>A volume of Davies's <span class="italic">Selected Poems</span> was published by Faber and Faber, on the recommendation of T. S. Eliot, less than a month before his death. In January 1952 he underwent an unsuccessful operation for cancer of the colon at Tredegar Hospital. After his convalescence, he remained in the care of his mother at 7 Victoria Road, Rhymni, until his death just after midnight on 6 April 1953. His ashes were buried in Rhymni cemetery a few days later. Plaques were erected to Davies's memory on the wall of the house in Victoria Road and in Rhymni Public Library. His <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span>, edited by Dafydd Johnston, was published by the University of Wales Press in 1994.<br>
