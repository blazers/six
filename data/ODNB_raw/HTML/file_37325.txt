<span class="headword">Crosfield,  John</span>  (1832&#150;1901), <span class="occ">chemical manufacturer</span>, was born in Warrington, Lancashire, on 11 February 1832, the youngest in the family of five sons and three daughters of Joseph Crosfield and his wife, Elizabeth Goad. He received a Quaker education in Penkelt, Cheshire, and at Bootham School, York, before going on to Glasgow high school. In 1847 he followed his elder brothers, George and Morland, into the family soap business, Joseph Crosfield &amp; Son, founded by their late father at Bank Quay, Warrington. In 1853 he became a partner, and after the death of Morland and George's move to London in 1875, he became solely responsible for the firm. The abolition of excise duty in 1853 heralded a period of growth and prosperity for the soap industry. Many improvements were made to the Bank Quay works, and Crosfields' products were marketed throughout the world. In 1883 Crosfields was one of the first factories to install electric light.<br>
<br>In 1874 John Brunner and Ludwig Mond began the production of soda at Winnington, Cheshire, by a new and cheaper process (ammonia-soda) than the traditional Leblanc method. Crosfield became their largest buyer of soda. In 1881, when Brunner, Mond &amp; Co. became a public company, he invested in it, became its first chairman, and remained a director until his death. In 1896 Joseph Crosfield &amp; Son became a public company, with Crosfield as chairman, and his two sons, Arthur and Joseph, and Dr Karl Markel (transferred from Brunner, Mond &amp; Co.) as directors. Markel was a German-educated chemist, who was responsible for significant technical improvements.<br>
<br>Crosfield was an enlightened employer in the paternalistic tradition, deeply influenced by his Quaker upbringing. Works outings to Llangollen and Blackpool, bowls competitions, and social evenings indicated an industrial harmony far from common at the time. Crosfield campaigned against intemperance, improvidence, and vice. He contributed time and money generously to Warrington: he was mayor in 1882, alderman in 1885, and freeman in 1891; he built a working men's mission, and supported schools, the library, the infirmary, and other institutions. He was a dedicated Liberal, helping to start the local club and association, and the Liberal newspaper, the <span class="italic">Warrington Examiner</span>. In the general election of July 1886 he was narrowly beaten by the tory Sir Gilbert Greenhall, head of the local brewing family&#151;a bitter disappointment to a temperance advocate.<br>
<br>Crosfield married Eliza Dickson, from an Ulster protestant family in the cotton trade, in Belfast in 1864; they had five sons and four daughters. She died in 1882, and in 1890 he married her sister Gertrude, in Jersey; they had no children. He relinquished control of the company to his three surviving sons, but remained chairman until his death, on 26 December 1901, at his home near Warrington, Walton Lea, Cheshire.<br>
