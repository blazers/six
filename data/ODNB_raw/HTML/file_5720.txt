<span class="headword">Clowes,  William, the younger</span>  (1807&#150;1883), <span class="occ">printer</span>, was born on 15 May 1807, the eldest son of the eight children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5718/', "William Clowes (1779&#150;1847)")</script> and his wife, Mary Winchester (1774/5&#150;1836). He entered his father's printing business in 1823 and later worked alongside his brothers Winchester (1808&#150;1862) and George (1814&#150;1886) in the firm. He married Emma Lett in 1835 and they had four sons and five daughters.<br>
<br>Around 1840 Clowes became interested in the possibilities of mechanical composition and bought the patent of a Polish invention for a typesetting machine. Two years later he endeavoured to print the <span class="italic">Family Herald</span> on a Young&#150;Delcambre composing machine, but the experiment was not a success. By 1875 the technical difficulties had largely been resolved and Clowes installed Hooker's electric typesetting machine linked to a distributing machine in the Duke Street factory. It was one of the first composing machines to be of practical use, yet, although he installed four more, they were never popular with other printers. He soon realized that the United States was ahead of Britain in their development and he sent his nephew Edward Arnott Clowes (1851&#150;1911) to America to bring back the most modern machinery. The Monotype machines which followed were widely used among British book printers and the firm became renowned for its expertise in composition. William Clowes made improvements especially in music printing and the firm became experts in printing in a range of different alphabets and languages.<br>
<br>In 1839 Clowes's father changed the name of the firm to William Clowes &amp; Sons. His sons, William and his brother George, added to their father's impressive client list, which included the government and the military, the Council of Law Reporting, and the Royal Academy, as well as all the major book and magazine publishers. Their biggest coup was to win the contract for the official catalogues of the Great Exhibition (1851), which was a considerable logistical exercise as they had to co-ordinate and typeset the entries from the various exhibitors from different countries around the world and to print the illustrative colour plates and engravings. The firm became a recognized authority and was consulted by the organizers of many exhibitions. This success was followed, in 1881, by the <span class="italic">General Catalogue of Printed Books in the British Museum Library</span>, which took nineteen years to complete. The firm also took a leading role in the production of <span class="italic">Hymns Ancient and Modern</span>, which originally came out in 1859 and was revised and enlarged several times before the popular 1875 edition.<br>
<br>While Clowes ran the business in London, his eldest son, William Archibald Clowes (1843&#150;1904), and his nephew William Charles Knight Clowes (1838&#150;1917), independent of the main firm, went into partnership with William Moore of the Caxton Press at Beccles, Suffolk, a small concern valued at less than &pound;5000 with four power presses. When Moore suddenly disappeared with all the money leaving considerable debts, the firm was re-established as Clowes and Clowes. It prospered and by 1876 was valued at over &pound;20,000 and had fifteen power printing presses. Four years later Clowes and Clowes and William Clowes &amp; Sons, the Beccles and London firms, were amalgamated and a limited company was formed.<br>
<br>William Clowes was well known for his benevolent and active interest in the welfare of printers and craftsmen. In 1844 he became a trustee and nine years later the treasurer of the Printers' Pension Corporation and was concerned in the building and endowment of the printers' almshouses at Wood Green, London. He died on 19 May 1883 at his home, 51 Gloucester Terrace, Hyde Park, London, and was buried in Norwood cemetery.<br>
