<span class="headword">Rogers,  John</span>  (1878&#150;1975), <span class="occ">chemist and industrialist</span>, was born on 24 May 1878 in the Gorbals, Glasgow, the son of Richard and Sarah Rogers. He was educated at a local board school until he was fourteen and then, while working as a laboratory boy at the Royal Technical College in Glasgow, he won a scholarship giving him free tuition there. After completing his studies he continued to work at the college as assistant to the professor of chemistry until 1899, when he joined Nobel's Explosives Company where he was one of the first research chemists to be employed. The company had been formed in 1871 to manufacture the explosive products developed and patented by Alfred Nobel at its factory at Ardeer, just outside Glasgow. The business had grown by exporting to overseas markets, mainly in the colonies; the company was also part of the Nobel-Dynamite Trust, a holding company which united the companies founded by Nobel, binding them together by cross-shareholdings, profit pooling, and market-sharing agreements.<br>
<br>Rogers married M. K. Allan in 1905; they had one daughter. Recognition of Rogers's scientific expertise and abilities came in 1908 when he was moved from Ardeer to the head office of Nobels in Glasgow as head of the technical department. There he became well acquainted with Harry (later Lord) McGowan, a forceful and ambitious young man, who had joined Nobels in 1889 and in 1909 was appointed the company's assistant general manager. The two became closely associated and remained so for the rest of their careers, although, according to Rogers, they were never friends. Rogers was a modest, kindly and considerate man whose conciliatory approach to problems and lack of personal ambition contrasted sharply with McGowan's aggressive determination.<br>
<br>During the First World War the company's output and profits inevitably increased and for its significant contribution to the war effort Rogers was made OBE. In 1918 Explosives Trades Ltd, a merger of all the UK explosives companies, was formed, with McGowan as its chairman and managing director and Rogers as its technical manager. In 1920 when Explosives Trades became Nobel Industries, to reflect better the widening of its industrial interests, Rogers became its technical director and in 1922 he joined the board of directors. Four years later McGowan was instrumental in the merger of Nobels with three other companies to form Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd (ICI) and was rewarded with the position of president of the new company. Rogers was appointed an executive director at ICI's first board meeting on 8 December 1926, and, over the next twenty-four years, continued to work closely with McGowan, who was chairman and managing director in 1930&#150;37 and then chairman until 1950.<br>
<br>Rogers played a considerable role in the technical development of ICI between 1926 and 1939. He was appointed chairman of a new management committee for the British Dyestuffs Corporation (BDC) in 1928; one of the four merging companies, BDC's short and unhappy history reflected the failure of the UK dyestuffs industry to compete with the German industry. After it became part of ICI, BDC achieved some success in matching German innovation in dyestuffs. The surviving evidence indicates that Rogers also appreciated the potential of the organic chemical industry and endeavoured to foster its development within ICI. He was chairman of the ICI Research Council from 1927 until 1939.<br>
<br>Rogers was not, however, confined to technical matters only. His moderation, common sense, and conciliatory approach were invaluable in negotiations and he played a significant part in ICI's industrial diplomacy with, for example, the Distillers Company and Courtaulds, both before and after the Second World War. In his personal life, after the death of his first wife, he married again in 1939; his second wife was Patricia Mary Katherine Garnett.<br>
<br>It was a measure of the respect felt for Rogers&#151;and the fear of McGowan&#151;in ICI that in 1937 it was Rogers who was deputed by his fellow directors to question McGowan about his financial affairs. McGowan's autocratic management style had led to discontent among the directors and his financial speculations had taken him close to personal bankruptcy. The attempt to force McGowan out of ICI failed and he held on to the chairmanship; in 1940 Rogers was appointed one of three deputy chairmen, a position he held for ten years.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Rogers served first as director-general of explosives and second as chairman of the ammunition board at the Ministry of Supply. It was widely believed that he refused to accept an honour at the end of the war when he returned to ICI.<br>
<br>When McGowan finally (and reluctantly) retired from ICI in 1950 it was expected that Rogers would also retire, but the sudden death of Sir Frederick Bain, chosen by the board as McGowan's successor, left a gap which Rogers agreed to fill as a caretaker chairman for two years. Despite his lack of enthusiasm for leadership or action, Rogers' personal qualities&#151;friendliness and concern, patience, and a dry sense of humour&#151;won him both respect and affection. While he was chairman he also served (1951&#150;2) as president of the Society of Chemical Industry and in 1952 he was awarded an honorary degree of LLD by St Andrews University.<br>
<br>Rogers retired from ICI in 1953 to enjoy, with his wife, the pursuit of his hobbies of travelling and the collection of old silver and Chinese ivories. He died at his home, Flat C, 29 Eton Square, Westminster, on 3 August 1975. His wife survived him.<br>
