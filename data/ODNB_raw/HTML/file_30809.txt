<span class="headword">Bentley,  Nicolas Clerihew <span class="st"> [Nicholas Clerihew]</span></span>  (1907&#150;1978), <span class="occ">cartoonist and author</span>, was born at 75 Dartmouth Park Hill, Highgate, Middlesex, on 14 June 1907, the youngest in the family of one daughter and two sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30720/', "Edmund Clerihew Bentley (1875&#150;1956)")</script>, writer, and his wife, Violet Alice Mary (1878/9&#150;1949), daughter of General Neil Edmonstone Boileau, of the Bengal staff corps and something of an eccentric: of him, Bentley wrote: &#145;of all my immediate relatives whom I never had a chance to meet, the General, who died twelve years before I was born, is the one I would most like to have known, and knowing, I feel equally sure, would have loved&#146;  (Bentley, <span class="italic">Version of the Truth</span>, 29).<br>
<br>Nicholas Bentley (he later dropped the &#145;h&#146; from his first name) was sent to University College School in Hampstead, London, and left it, no scholar, at seventeen. He was already visiting the National Gallery to study painting, and knew he was going to be some kind of artist. The illustrated books in his father's library included works by Caran d'Ache and Gustave Dor&eacute;, which he enjoyed before he could read. He enrolled in 1924 at the Heatherley School of Fine Art, London, known to be good for teaching illustration. The joint principal was Iain Macnab, who became important in Bentley's development. Bentley described him as a genius, both for the way he gave students confidence in themselves and, in particular, for how he insisted on practising observation, which became the sure foundation of Bentley's own success as an artist. Bentley seems to have been observant from childhood, but after learning from Macnab he wrote, &#145;One's eye is never off duty&#146;.<br>
<br>Bentley left Heatherleys after a comparatively short time, and became a clown (unpaid) in a circus. He had always been fond of dressing up, especially with his father's friends the Chestertons&#151;and getting inside the skin of somebody else is as much the business of the illustrator as of the actor. He worked as a clown for six weeks, and then for a short time took part as an extra in films. His experiences in the ring and on the stage are reflected in several of his early cartoons.<br>
<br>In 1926 Bentley worked on the London underground during the general strike and sold his first drawing to his godfather, G. K. Chesterton, but it is not known what it was. In 1928 he was illustrating a diary in a trade paper, <span class="italic">Man and his Clothes</span>: clothes always interested him, and he always drew them with great skill. He was then offered a job by Jack Beddington, the director of Shell publicity, and joined a group which included Edward Ardizzone, Barnett Freedman, Rex Whistler, Arthur Elton, John Betjeman, Peter Quennell, and Robert Byron; the American poster artist Edward McKnight Kauffer also became a close friend. In his autobiography, <span class="italic">A Version of the Truth</span> (1960), he wrote: &#145;the three years I spent with Jack Beddington were decisive, not so much for Shell as for me &hellip; I &hellip; would certainly not be the sort of man I am if I had never felt Jack's influence&#146;  (Bentley, <span class="italic">Version of the Truth</span>, 139). Bentley's friendship with Beddington was deep but he was not fond of advertising. Rescue came from Hilaire Belloc, an old friend of his father's, who asked him to illustrate his <span class="italic">New Cautionary Tales</span> (1930). Bentley took Belloc's memorable advice, delivered on a visit to Shell-Mex House:<blockquote>If you don't get out of here pretty soon, my boy, you'll be tied to the chariot wheels of commerce for the rest of your life! &hellip; Where's it going to get you? Clear out of it while you can, my boy! (ibid., 142&#150;3)</blockquote>The collaboration led him to illustrate, with equal success, several comic books by J. B. Morton (Beachcomber of the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>), Damon Runyon, and others, as well as anthologies, sometimes compiled by himself. The twelfth book bearing Bentley's name as illustrator, also written by him, was <span class="italic">Ready Refusals, or, The White Liar's Engagement Book</span>. The text consists of a quotation for every day of the year, collected by Bentley from an astonishing range of authors, and sets down in his own words &#145;an invitation resistance that is proof against every effort of the most insultingly charitable hostess&#146;. The first published collection of Bentley's cartoons, culled from <span class="italic">The Bystander</span>, <span class="italic">Punch</span>, and <span class="italic">Men Only</span>, was <span class="italic">Die? I Thought I'd Laugh!</span> (1936); but he was already as much of a writer as he was an artist.<br>
<br>On 17 October 1934 Bentley married Barbara Mary Hastings (1908&#150;1989), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33756/', "Sir Patrick Gardiner Hastings")</script>, the most famous QC of his day; their only child, Arabella (Bella), was born in 1943. During the Second World War Bentley illustrated several books for children, including two written by his wife: <span class="italic">Lobby Lobster</span> (1943), with eight full-page illustrations beautifully conceived in full colour, not just in line with colour added; and <span class="italic">Mustapha Monkey</span> (1945), with many illustrations, among the best he ever did, but all in line.<br>
<br>Before the war Bentley had been a prison visitor at Wormwood Scrubs prison and in 1938 became an auxiliary fireman. During the war he served with the London Fire Brigade, and had grim experiences in the London blitz, vividly described in <span class="italic">A Version of the Truth</span>. He worked in the Ministry of Information throughout the war, first in the home intelligence and later in the publications and films divisions. After the war he continued to draw for books, newspapers, magazines, and advertisers, and also wrote three thrillers, all published by Michael Joseph and later as paperbacks by Penguin. In 1950 he joined the publishing firm of Andr&eacute; Deutsch, for whom he had illustrated George Mikes's best-seller <span class="italic">How to be an Alien</span> in 1946: he became not only Deutsch's partner but a lifelong friend.<br>
<br>Working as a publisher enabled Nicolas Bentley to go on drawing without being forced to over-produce. Between 1952 and 1954 he drew regular cartoons for the weekly <span class="italic">Time and Tide</span>, and after that for the daily <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span>. Between 1958 and 1962 he drew over 600 &#145;pocket cartoons&#146; for the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, published about 2 inches wide from much larger drawings. He finally found the strain of this work too great, and gave it up as a regular commission.<br>
<br>Bentley had an outstanding ability to catch likenesses. His faces are clearly real people he has observed, both rich and poor, old and young, women and children as well as men, and even dogs and cats. Some portraits may be called cruelly accurate, but they are never savage. He also drew many portraits, in black and white line, of famous people, for various papers, including over sixty for the <span class="italic">Sunday Telegraph</span>, which began publication in February 1961. When aged over sixty-four, he began drawing for <span class="italic">Private Eye</span>, at that time the most youthful of Britain's adult satirical weeklies. His cartoon of the royal family sitting in 1972 for a group photograph (reproduced in <span class="italic">Nicolas Bentley Drew the Pictures</span>, 1990) is accurate, funny, and devastating.<br>
<br>The source of Bentley's inspiration is man himself: man, proud man, especially when dressed in a little brief authority. He became the first artist in England of recent times to get away with loud laughter at certain aspects of death and the church&#151;perhaps from natural irreverence and also because they gave him the opportunity to use pleasing areas of solid black. More usually he showed the gentler, more pleasant face of life. His pretty girls, whether vacuous or intelligent, are enchanting, and his housewives, chars, couturiers, schoolgirls, Wren officers, cellists, and hockey players are never mere caricatures: they are honest portraits of individuals we all know. The people of England in the mid-twentieth century live on in all his pages.<br>
<br>Towards the end of his life Bentley moved out of London and settled down in a converted village school at Downhead, near Shepton Mallet, Somerset. Though becoming elderly, he retained a youthful appearance&#151;slim, shy, and friendly. He died at the Royal United Hospital, Bath, on 14 August 1978. His wife survived him.<br>
