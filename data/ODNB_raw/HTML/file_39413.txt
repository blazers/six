<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Woods,  Samuel</span>  (1846&#150;1915), <span class="occ">trade unionist and politician</span>, was born on 10 May 1846, at Peasley Cross, St Helens, the son of Thomas Woods, a miner, and his wife, Margaret (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Rothwell), until 1840 also a mine worker. Woods's first introduction to mining was at the age of seven. He returned to school from the age of nine to thirteen, but then went back to the pits. He was an assiduous attender at night school, and this education was reinforced by his durable and strong commitment to the Baptist church. He was a lay preacher and a total abstainer. He married a miner's daughter, Sarah Lee, in 1867; they had twelve children.<br>
<br>Woods's fellow workers elected him to the post of checkweighman in 1875 and three years later he started to organize the miners in the St Helens and Haydock districts of the Lancashire coalfield. From 1881 he was a significant figure in the newly formed Lancashire and Cheshire Miners' Federation, becoming the first Lancashire president in 1884. When delegates from several coalfields met at Newport in 1889 and formed the Miners' Federation of Great Britain (MFGB), Woods became the new organization's vice-president.<br>
<br>Woods was a thorough advocate of the central policies of the MFGB&#151;the eight-hour day by legislation, and the achievement of a system of mutual defence between coalfields on the wages question. He was heavily involved in the 1893 lock-out which strengthened the credibility of the MFGB: it led to government intervention and the establishment of a conciliation board.<br>
<br>In the 1892 general election, Woods was returned for the Ince division of Lancashire. He campaigned &#145;first and foremost as a Labour candidate&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wigan Observer</span>, 25 June 1892), but also acknowledged he was a &#145;Home Ruler and a Radical&#146;  (ibid., 30 June 1892) and welcomed Liberal Party support. His victory over the incumbent, a Conservative employer, was followed by a frustrating period at Westminster. He successfully moved the second reading of the miners' <span class="roman">Eight Hours Bill</span> in May 1893. The bill progressed no further. The miners members&#151;all Liberals&#151;were divided. Those within the MFGB, including Woods, were keen advocates; those from the still independent Northumberland and Durham unions were opposed.<br>
<br>Woods was defeated at the 1895 general election, but early in 1897 he returned to the Commons after a by-election victory in a very different constituency, Walthamstow. His victory was something of a surprise and he was subsequently defeated at the 1900 election. His position on the South African War was attacked by his Conservative opponent; he responded by acknowledging his opposition to the diplomacy that had preceded the war, but claimed he had subsequently backed the government's policy. This was the end of his parliamentary career. He was subsequently associated with the National Democratic League, a combination of radicals and labour leaders.<br>
<br>In 1894 Woods was elected secretary of the Trades Union Congress's parliamentary committee in a three-cornered contest. Woods's defeat of the incumbent, the Northumbrian Charles Fenwick, was that of an MFGB official over another miner who was a strong opponent of the <span class="roman">Eight Hours Bill</span>. His secretaryship covered the years when the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95367', "Labour Representation Committee")</script> was formed and several trade unions affiliated to the new political organization. Initially the political significance of this development was unclear and Woods as a Liberal could accommodate to it without great difficulty. As secretary to the parliamentary committee, Woods was at first industrious and efficient, but from 1900 his health deteriorated and complaints grew about his performance. He retired in 1904 and that was almost the end of his public career. He continued as MFGB vice-president until 1909; in the later years this was an honorific appointment supported by the MFGB's Liberals as a means of blocking the socialist, Robert Smillie. Woods died at his home, 238 Wigan Road, Brynn Ashton, near Wigan, on 23 November 1915.<br>
<br>Woods played a significant part in constructing both the Lancashire Miners' Federation and the MFGB and was a thorough advocate of the latter's policies. His religious enthusiasm meant that he was a reassuring figure for those nonconformists who were concerned about &#145;Labour agitators&#146;  (<span class="italic">St Helens Newspaper and Advertiser</span>). By the late 1890s he was a respected figure in Liberal circles, but his links with the coalfield were increasingly tenuous. His record was perhaps overshadowed by the emergence and subsequent dominance of independent labour politics. William Brace, a miners' leader of the next generation, remembered him for &#145;his genial companionship and kindly ways &hellip; a dapper gentle kind of soul&#146;  (Arnot, 204).<br>
