<span class="headword">Meyer,  Rollo John Oliver <span class="st"> [Jack]</span></span>  (1905&#150;1991), <span class="occ">educationist and cricketer</span>, was born on 15 March 1905 at the rectory, Clophill, Bedfordshire, the son of <a href="#cosubject_100257">Canon (Horace) Rollo Meyer [<i>see below</i>]</a>, Church of England clergyman, and his wife, Arabella Crosbie Ward. His education commenced at what he called a dame-school in Middlesex, followed by a preparatory school in Blackheath, where he was accepted on favourable terms&#151;a sign of things to come. In 1918 he moved to Haileybury College, to which he won an unexpected scholarship. He didn't enjoy himself much there, but did well at sports. From Haileybury he went on to Pembroke College, Cambridge, where as well as a good deal of very successful cricket (he was for three years a Cambridge cricket blue, as well as a rackets blue and very nearly a golf blue) he inclined towards schoolmastering. He spent a short period teaching, and then went to India, using his sporting fame and perhaps his less than glamorous academic results in search of a fortune. He worked as a cotton broker for Gill &amp; Co., Bombay, from 1926 to 1929. He then worked as a private tutor in Limboli and Porbandar, and became headmaster of Dhrangadhra Palace School in 1930. In 1931 he married Joyce Evelyn Symons, with whom he had two daughters, one of whom died young. The marriage worked, but India did not. However, he started to find his feet as a schoolmaster there, and he began to coach sons of the Indian aristocracy for entry into Oxford and Cambridge.<br>
<br>In 1935 Meyer took five of his Indian pupils to England, and Millfield School was thus established. It grew rapidly. Meyer&#151;universally known as the Boss&#151;built on three successful pillars. First, he recognized the value of what came to be called &#145;comprehensive&#146; schooling; it may have been based on money rather than on more social attitudes, but it worked and Millfield prided itself on being the first public comprehensive and co-educational school. Secondly, and following from this, he recognized the issue of what was later called &#145;diversity&#146;; he would, to put it crudely, educate not-so-bright children of rich parents at high fees, while taking on bright pupils&#151;whether academic, artistic, or sporting&#151;for little or nothing in payment. The third and most important strand in Meyer's approach was that as a born pedagogue, in the best sense of the word, he recognized that there was no child who had not got some good in him or her, and aimed to bring this out. Millfield thrived on this formula and became a large organization&#151;a senior school, preparatory school, and pre-preparatory school, with very substantial academic, artistic, and sporting achievements to the credit of its pupils. Meyer was appointed OBE in 1967. In later years Millfield's headmaster was a member of the headmaster's conference, a sign of respectability denied, many said unfairly, to Meyer in his day.<br>
<br>Of course there was a downside. Meyer's autocratic, even roguish, approach went out in the more straight-laced post-war years, and a board of governors was established. His stern if whimsical discipline&#151;he was a great one for corporal punishment&#151;went out of fashion too. Some of Millfield's advantages in the immediate post-war years&#151;for instance keeping class sizes small by employing, on the cheap, retired teachers from other schools&#151;lost their effect. In 1970 Meyer resigned and exiled himself to Greece, in what appeared, in public anyway, to be slightly unseemly circumstances. His work in Greece was by no means a failure, with the true schoolmastering skills still coming through, as founder and first headmaster of St Lawrence College, Athens, from 1979 to 1986 and co-founder and first rector of Byron College, Athens, from 1986 to 1987. He retired through ill health in the latter year.<br>
<br>Meyer was a great sportsman. As with his schoolmastering his success was based not on book knowledge or learning, but on instinct and natural flair. He played cricket for Somerset (and was captain in 1947) and his career included taking 412 first-class wickets, including those of some of the very best batsmen of the day, including Woolley, Edrich, and Bradman. He took these interests with him to Millfield but contrary to popular belief did not overdo the sporting side&#151;this mistake, if mistake it was, was left to his successors.<br>
<br>Meyer died at Bristol General Hospital on 9 March 1991 and was survived by his wife and one daughter, the other daughter having predeceased him in a car accident. He was a difficult, talented man in very many fields. But in the field of teaching he was a genius. Millfield and indeed educational thinking more widely stand as monuments to his ideas, enthusiasm, and skill. The recognition that every child has a winning streak in him or her, and that it is the job of the school to bring this forward, may not have been entirely new, but Meyer certainly made it real.<br>
<br>His father <a name="cosubject_100257"></a><span class="headword">(Horace) Rollo Meyer</span>  (1868&#150;1953), <span class="occ">clergyman and gardener</span>, was born at East Tisted, Hampshire, on 6 July 1868, the son of Horace Meyer (1828/9&#150;1897), vicar of Christ Church, Clifton, and his wife, Louisa Clara, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bosanquet. Educated at Cheam school, Charterhouse School, and Trinity College, Cambridge (1887&#150;90), he underwent theological training at Ridley Hall and was ordained in 1894. After serving a curacy at Wirksworth, Derbyshire, from 1894 to 1900, he held the rectories of Clophill, Bedfordshire (1900&#150;10), and Watton-at-Stone, Hertfordshire (1911&#150;36), and was honorary canon of St Albans Abbey from 1934. In 1902 he married Arabella Crosbie, daughter of Hamilton Ward, with whom he had three sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>Meyer was a prominent figure in gardening circles. Before the First World War, with his Cambridge friend the politician Noel Buxton, he founded the London Gardens Guild to encourage flower growing in deprived parts of inner London, for example by holding competitions for window boxes. In 1927 it became the National Gardens Guild, of which he was president. He was a leading exhibitor and hybridist of narcissi, and also won many awards as an iris specialist. In 1950 he received the Royal Horticultural Society's highest award, the Victoria medal of honour. He died at his home, Manor End, Little Gaddesden, Hertfordshire, on 6 March 1953.<br>
