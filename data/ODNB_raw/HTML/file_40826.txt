<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cullwick,  Hannah</span>  (1833&#150;1909), <span class="occ">diarist</span>, was born in Shifnal, Shropshire, on 26 May 1833. She was a working-class woman from a then still predominantly peasant area of Britain. The daughter of a saddler and a former housemaid, later a lady's maid, she had a large number of siblings, of whom the closest were her older brother James (Jim) and her younger sisters Mary Ann (Polly) and Ellen. Cullwick worked first in Shifnal, then other parts of the country, and later in Shifnal again, as a domestic servant. Her employment included being pot-girl, under-maid, kitchen maid, cook, scullion, housekeeper, and maid of all work, and she worked for most sectors of the Victorian employing classes. However, she preferred being a maid of all work, as this gave most control over work routines and the greatest scope for exercising her considerable talents and energies.<br>
<br>Having led one of the &#145;lives of the obscure&#146;, Hannah Cullwick aroused public interest in 1950 when the Munby collection at Trinity College, Cambridge, was opened. Attention focused initially on her clandestine relationship with and later marriage to the diarist and minor civil servant <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35147/', "Arthur Joseph Munby (1828&#150;1910)")</script>, but has increasingly centred upon her own diary, which forms part of the Munby collection. It commences in 1854 (before Munby's starts in 1859) and was kept, albeit with some interruptions, until 1873. It provides unparalleled information about the routines and skills of that most typical of Victorian employment, female domestic service, and also of the complex reactions of servants to their exacting and often overbearing employers. The picture provided bears little resemblance to the often romanticized &#145;upstairs, downstairs&#146; world, but is rather one of hard, dirty, relentless work for sixteen or seventeen hours a day, with minimal time off each month or quarter. It was also work that required difficult transformations at different stages of the day, between performing extremely dirty &#145;backstairs&#146; work and making neat and clean public presentations for the family and their guests.<br>
<br>Cullwick met Munby in 1854. They had a long and largely clandestine relationship in which the demands of service meant that they met relatively infrequently. They married at St James's, Clerkenwell, on 14 January 1873, for a long period living as &#145;servant and master&#146; except when they travelled as a &#145;lady and gentleman&#146; married couple. However, Cullwick increasingly resented her enforced ladyhood, wanting them to live openly as a married upper-class gentleman and lower-class woman. The disagreements engendered led to her departure from London in 1877 followed by a period in which contact was minimal. The relationship later resumed, although Cullwick remained bitter that Munby continued to keep her place in his life secret from his upper-class friends and acquaintances. She died of heart failure at Shifnal on 9 July 1909, and was buried in the parish church there; Munby died six months later.<br>
<br>Cullwick's diary was begun at Munby's request as a means of keeping him in touch with her life and activities as well as satisfying his need to have these represented. Her diary, however, transcends these origins in a number of important ways. It is almost unique in the detailed account it gives of practices and changes in early and mid-Victorian domestic service, in particular regarding its most common example of the maid of all work. It provides equally rare detailed information on the last remnants of peasant England, for example regarding harvesting activities and peasant Shropshire dress. The diary also demonstrates the complexities of supposed &#145;illiteracy&#146;, for Cullwick could read proficiently and became increasingly at her ease as a writer. As well as inscribing the changing course of a cross-class relationship that was by no means as uncommon as Munby supposed, the diary displays Cullwick's increasing ability to influence or shame Munby in directions desired by her, and acts as a fascinating counter-voice to that inscribed in Munby's own diary. Although unlikely to be seen as one of the &#145;great&#146; Victorian diaries, it provides a fascinating window on these aspects and more, and has become standard reading for researchers interested in working-class women's work and lives over this period.<br>
