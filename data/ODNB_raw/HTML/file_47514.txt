<span class="headword">Gartside,  Thomas Edmund <span class="st"> [Tommy]</span></span>  (1857&#150;1941), <span class="occ">cotton spinner</span>, was born at Park Lane, Royton, 2 miles north of Oldham, on 9 February 1857, the only son of Alice Gartside. His birth occurred at a most propitious time, since Oldham became the world's leading mill town during the 1860s, and so opened up opportunities for the young and enterprising. Gartside went to the Methodist school in Royton and later took evening classes at Royton Temperance Seminary. He began work at the age of twelve and gained experience in half a dozen different posts, rising from shop assistant in 1869 to clerk in 1876, and to company secretary in 1889. In 1883 he married Harriet (1855&#150;1937), daughter of William Travis, a waste dealer; they had two sons and two daughters. Only when he became a director of the Shiloh Spinning Company in 1891, and its manager in 1894, did Gartside embark on his real business career. The seal was set upon his ascent in 1891, when he became a member of the Manchester Royal Exchange, and so joined the &eacute;lite of the cotton world in the largest of markets for cotton yarn and cotton cloth.<br>
<br>Gartside's first task was to restore Shiloh to financial health and to a position befitting its auspicious name. Founded during the boom of 1874 as one of Oldham's limited-liability spinning companies, it had proved to be one of the least successful of ventures. Its dividend record was appalling and its debit balance had trebled in the decade from 1885 to 1894. Gartside infused a new spirit into the administration of the company, pursued a shrewd financial policy, and established tight control over the purchase, spinning, and sale of yarn. He liquidated the debit balance by 1897, and so restored the confidence of investors. He raised the proportion of loan capital to 76 per cent of the total capital by 1902. Not merely did he resume the payment of dividends from 1899, for the first time since 1885, but he also raised their level by paying a low fixed interest to the loanholders. He endowed Shiloh with a new mill (1899&#150;1901) and installed mules manufactured by Platts, which proved more productive than those from Asa Lees. He depreciated his plant at the same high annual rate of 6 per cent as his fellow businessman John Bunting (1839&#150;1923). He bought cotton cheaply and in bulk, and enlarged his storage facilities in order to avoid being held to ransom by speculators in the raw cotton market. Shiloh joined the &eacute;lite of the &#145;Oldham limiteds&#146; in 1906 when it ceased to publish accounts, and so passed from the realm of public scrutiny to semi-private status, its shareholders remaining content with the regular payment of 10 per cent dividends for the twenty-two years from 1904 to 1926.<br>
<br>The abilities of Tommy Gartside were recognized by his appointment, by 1899, as a director of three other companies, by which time he had laid the foundation for the construction of a group of associated companies. The formation of that group took place in two phases, during the Edwardian boom of 1904&#150;8, and during the years 1916&#150;23. Between 1904 and 1908 he became the chairman of three companies, including Shiloh itself in 1907. From 1908 he was attending the regular weekly meetings of eight different boards of directors. By 1914 his three core companies controlled six mills, with 284,325 spindles. By 1923 he had become the chairman of nine companies, with fourteen mills and 962,780 spindles, some 44 per cent of the total number in Royton. The construction of the Gartside group was complete. Until 1922 all the companies were located in Royton itself, so easing the task of supervision. All save two had built new mills rather than operating the old mills favoured by Bunting. Gartside himself confined his interests to the cotton trade, becoming a director of the local board of the London and Lancashire Insurance Company and of John Hepworth &amp; Co., yarn agents. In 1914 he became a member of the committee of the Oldham Master Cotton Spinners' Association and of the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners' Associations, both bodies which Bunting shunned. In 1919 he served as one of Oldham's five delegates to the World Cotton Conference in New Orleans. In 1923 he became vice-president of the Oldham Master Cotton Spinners' Association.<br>
<br>During the boom of 1919&#150;20 Gartside avoided the temptation to recapitalize his companies in the extravagant mode adopted by other limiteds. He undertook a conservative recapitalization of Shiloh in 1920, but used the opportunity to end its reliance on loan capital. The group registered its best performance for the year 1925 when Shiloh paid a dividend of 12.5 per cent and the rest of the group averaged 31 per cent, an abnormally high level caused by the 115 per cent distributed by the group's Grape Mill. The performance of Shiloh was indeed outclassed by that of the other Gartside mills for twelve years from 1921. In 1916 Gartside had first introduced high-speed ring spinning into the Park and Sandy Lane Mill, but he remained loyal to the Lancashire mule, the proportion of ring spindles in his mills averaging only one-third the proportion in the Oldham district as a whole. He built the Elk Mill in 1926&#150;7 out of Shiloh's reserve funds and equipped it with 107,000 mule spindles supplied by Platts. That mill, together with the Holden Mill built at Astley Bridge to the north of Bolton, were the last mule mills to be built in Lancashire: both were built by cotton magnates who had begun their working lives in their shirt-sleeves. The year 1926 marked the climacteric of the textile industry in Lancashire and in the world. Thereafter dividends declined, especially after 1931, to reach a nadir in 1934&#150;5, and averaged during the 1930s only one-third of their level in the 1920s. The price of Shiloh shares sank below par from 1930 and did not rise above par until 1939.<br>
<br>The mills of Royton spun coarse counts of yarn, or Royton counts, for the home trade, and successfully preserved their independence, while other mills were reluctantly forced by their dependence on loans into large combines. Gartside remained fiercely independent and declined to join the Cotton Yarn Association formed in 1927. In 1933 he did negotiate with his local rival, Will Cheetham (1869&#150;1942), the Royton coarse counts agreement, which was the first price-fixing agreement reached within the industry since 1909. He refused to join the Lancashire Cotton Corporation which had been formed in 1929 in order to rationalize the American spinning trade by closing down mills. Nor would he conform to its policies for regulating the market: &#145;He is an impossible fellow &hellip; He will creep under the general price just so long as he is allowed to&#146;  (minutes of the board of directors, Lancashire Cotton Corporation, 30 May 1934, 4). Thereby Gartside performed a valuable social service: he excluded outside influence from Royton and maintained local employment opportunities when they were shrinking elsewhere. Two of the Gartside companies, the Roy and the Willow Vale, ceased to pay dividends after 1922, but were kept in operation as machines for processing cotton and for paying wages. Even burdened by such millstones, the Gartside group averaged a dividend for the years 1908&#150;41 of 8.9 per cent, while Shiloh itself paid one of 8.6 per cent (1902&#150;41), or one quarter higher than the Oldham average. By 1941 Shiloh was paying a dividend of 20 per cent and its shares stood at a premium of 35 per cent. Thus Gartside fulfilled his responsibilities to Royton as well as to his shareholders: in return he secured the intense loyalty possible only within a small community. He also served as vicar's warden at St Paul's Church, Royton, from 1903, as a Lancashire magistrate from 1913, and as a Liberal councillor on Royton urban district council (1906&#150;15). The whole of Royton mourned his passing when he died, at the age of eighty-three, on 8 January 1941, at his home, Highlands House, Royton. He was buried at Royton cemetery on 11 January.<br>
<br>Gartside was succeeded at Shiloh first by his son, Colonel J. B. Gartside (1897&#150;1964) and then, from 1965, by his grandson, Edmund Gartside. Under that dynasty the Shiloh group achieved a unique status within Lancashire. First, it survived through the pursuit of a shrewd policy of product diversification, while other groups disintegrated and disappeared. It successfully preserved its independence of the giant corporations which invaded Lancashire during the 1960s. Second, it remained under the administration of the same family for three generations, in flat defiance of the local proverb &#145;From shirt-sleeves to shirt-sleeves takes three generations&#146;. Third, it maintained a highly effective paternalist tradition which created &#145;the Shiloh breed&#146; of workpeople and integrated the members of &#145;the Shiloh family&#146; into the service of a continuing enterprise.<br>
