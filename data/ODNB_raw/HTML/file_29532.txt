<span class="headword">Williams,  Moses</span>  (1685&#150;1742), <span class="occ">Welsh scholar and translator</span>, son of Samuel Williams (<i>c</i>.1660&#150;<i>c</i>.1722), vicar of Llandyfr&iuml;og and rector of Llangynllo, Cardiganshire, and his wife, Margaret Prydderch, of Llandysul parish, was born on 2 March 1685 at Glaslwyn, Cellan, Cardiganshire. After a period at Carmarthen grammar school he matriculated at University College, Oxford, as servitor on 31 March 1705; he graduated BA in 1708, and incorporated MA from King's College, Cambridge, in 1718. At Oxford he was nurtured by Edward Lhuyd, keeper of the Ashmolean Museum, who appointed him sub-librarian in 1707, a junior post which, however, allowed him to work closely with Lhuyd in the preparation of his <span class="italic">Archaeologia Britannica</span> (1707). Williams's translation and adaptation of Julian Manoir's Breton grammar and glossary appeared as sections 3 and 4 (pp. 180&#150;212). Lhuyd died in 1709 but it is clear that the time Williams spent with him was to be one of the strongest influences on his scholarly ambitions. He was ordained deacon on 2 March 1709 and became curate of Chiddingstone, Kent, where he remained until early 1713.<br>
<br>Samuel Williams was an antiquary, copyist, and translator, who was well versed in the Welsh literary tradition, and he brought Moses up to share these interests, bequeathing his library, worth &pound;41 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>., to him. The lower Teifi valley during the early years of the eighteenth century was then notable for the reforming zeal of a number of clerics and the enthusiastic patronage of some of the local gentry in attempts to translate and publish devotional and instructional literature in Welsh. Samuel Williams, who was already active in this field, was soon assisted by his son. Together they published in 1710 <span class="italic">Y namyn un deugain articlau crefydd</span>, a revised edition of the Welsh version of the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>, followed by Moses Williams's own translations, <span class="italic">Ymarferol-waith i'r elusen ysgolion</span>, <span class="italic">Llawlyfr y llafurwr</span>, and <span class="italic">Boreol a phrydhnawnol weddi i deulu</span> (all published 1711).<br>
<br>After serving as chaplain to the countess of Denbigh for a brief period Williams was ordained priest on 31 May 1713. The Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK) had at this time decided to publish a new edition of the Welsh <span class="roman">Bible</span> and Williams was appointed editor in 1712. He spent the summer of 1714 travelling through Wales gathering subscriptions and advance orders, but he also used the opportunity to acquire books and manuscripts&#151;&#145;bought &hellip; begged &hellip; stole&#146;, claimed Lewis Morris  (<span class="italic">Cambrian Register</span>, 2.540), to familiarize himself with the major libraries and, as John Morgan advised him in his letter of May 1714, to become acquainted with their owners and other Welsh writers and scholars in preparation for his projected revision&#151;never fulfilled&#151;of John Davies's <span class="italic">Dictionarium duplex</span> (1632). He was in London in 1715 overseeing the printing of the Welsh <span class="roman">Bible</span> (published in 1718) and his translation, <span class="italic">Cydymmaith ir allor</span> (1715). Also in 1715 he received the vicarage of Llanwenog, Cardiganshire, and the following year that of Defynnog, Brecknockshire. He married Margaret Davies of Cwm Wysg at Defynnog on 10 November 1718; their daughter, Margaret, was baptized there on 21 August 1720.<br>
<br>Williams, who was elected FRS in 1719, inspired by Lhuyd's unrealized intentions and probably by his acquaintance with English scholars such as Humfrey Wanley, John Hudson, William Baxter, Thomas Hearne, William Wotton, and William Jones, increasingly turned his attention to meticulously transcribing medieval Welsh manuscripts and preparing texts for publication, to building up his personal library of rare books and manuscripts (thereby ensuring their preservation), and to compiling catalogues and indexes. <span class="italic">Cofrestr o'r holl lyfrau printjedig</span>, a catalogue of Welsh printed books dating from 1546 to 1717, based on his own collection, appeared in 1717; it is regarded as the cornerstone of Welsh historical bibliography although its declared aim was to inform the SPCK which Welsh books might usefully be reprinted by them. His <span class="italic">Reportium poeticum</span>, a first-line index of Welsh poetry and an alphabetical list of poets, was published in 1726, but a similar Welsh index, &#145;Llech o'r holl brydyddion Cymreig&#146;, was never published. That he intended publishing his transcripts and editions of medieval prose texts is indicated both by the draft title-page of his edition of the Welsh triads in Llanstephan MS 65 (1717) and by his <span class="italic">Proposals for printing &hellip; a collection of writings in the Welsh tongue to the beginning of the sixteenth century</span> (1719). Williams also edited the unpublished work of William Baxter (which contained some of Lhuyd's notes), and Humphrey Lhuyd's 1573 <span class="italic">Britanniae descriptionis commentariolum</span> (1723, 1731), but his most important work was his contribution to <span class="italic">Cyfreithjeu Hywel Dda ac eraill, seu, Leges Wallicae</span> (1730), the first attempt at an edition of the Welsh laws. This work, begun by William Wotton who invited Williams to assist him about 1723, was completed by Williams with valuable annotations after Wotton's death in 1726.<br>
<br>Williams was both a zealous and a patriotic reformer. His sermon before the Society of Ancient Britons in London in 1717 (published 1718) reveals his practical concern for the welfare of the underprivileged and deprived sections of the community and is an indictment of conditions to which society had a duty to respond. The strong Welsh national note struck in the sermon is more unambiguously political than the cultural one which was more usual at the time. Williams preached again before the society in 1721 (published 1722), but he appears to have been discouraged by the lack of response to both his humanitarian and scholarly aspirations. He sought to move from Defynnog and in 1732 he became rector of Chilton Trinity and St Mary's, Bridgwater. He justified the move by his desire to continue his studies&#151;Hearne noted in 1730 some of Williams's plans for publications&#151;but he lacked patronage and academic support for his work and did not undertake any further scholarly activities, although he is said to have put the Bridgwater borough records in order.<br>
<br>Williams, who married again about 1730 following the death of his first wife, died at Bridgwater and was buried at St Mary's on 2 March 1742. His friend William Jones, tutor to the earl of Macclesfield and his son, purchased his library of books, manuscripts, transcripts, and notes from his widow. The collection passed to the earl by will and it was bought by Sir John Williams, who presented it to the National Library of Wales where the manuscripts are known as the Llanstephan collection (formerly Shirburn Castle collection).<br>
