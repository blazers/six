<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stanley,  Arthur Penrhyn</span>  (1815&#150;1881), <span class="occ">dean of Westminster</span>, was born on 13 December 1815 at Alderley rectory, Cheshire, the third of five children of the rector, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26263/', "Edward Stanley (1779&#150;1849)")</script>, later bishop of Norwich, and his wife, Catherine (1792&#150;1862), the daughter of Oswald Leycester, the rector of Stoke upon Tern. He had two brothers and two sisters. In September 1824 he was sent to a small private boarding-school at Seaforth, where Gladstone had been a pupil. Already distinguished by an insatiable love of reading, in 1828 his parents took him to the Pyrenees, a visit described fluently in his diary and the subject of many of his early poems.<h2>
<a name="RugbyandOxford"></a>Rugby and Oxford</h2>On 31 January 1829 Stanley entered Rugby School, of which Thomas Arnold had recently become headmaster. In 1831 he was promoted to the sixth form where for the next three years he came under the supervision of Arnold himself, whose influence upon him, both in the chapel and the classroom, was profound. Arnold deepened in him the whig convictions which his family had already instilled in him. He did not excel at rugby football, but impressed his contemporaries with his intellectual abilities; they recognized that he was not to be judged by their conventional standards, much like Arthur in Thomas Hughes's <span class="italic">Tom Brown's Schooldays</span> (1857).<br>
<br>In November 1833 Stanley gained a scholarship at Balliol College, and in the following October went into residence at Oxford. He became friendly with W. G. Ward and Benjamin Jowett, and heard Newman lecture in the university church, but he remained true to liberal principles and was never a Tractarian, though impressed by Newman's earnestness, which reminded him of Arnold. In 1837 he won the Ireland scholarship for the composition of Greek and Latin verse, and in the same year the Newdigate prize for English verse with a poem on the set subject of &#145;The Gypsies&#146;. In November 1837 he was awarded a first-class degree in classics. He was elected to a fellowship at University College, Oxford, in July 1838, though he would have preferred to have been a fellow of Balliol. However, he learnt that Balliol was not inclined to elect someone so liberal in outlook as he was known to be. In the next year he won the chancellor's Latin essay prize and in 1840 both the chancellor's English essay prize and the Ellerton theological essay prize. Stanley was obliged by the terms of his fellowship to be ordained in the Church of England. However, he had grave doubts about subscribing to the damnatory clauses of the Athanasian creed but, having been told that they were not to be regarded as integral to that creed, he was prepared to be made a deacon in December 1839. In 1843 he was ordained a priest.<br>
<br>In 1840 Stanley was present at the coronation of Queen Victoria and wrote a vivid, detailed account of the event. Shortly afterwards he left England for a tour of ten months, visiting Switzerland, Greece, Italy, Malta, and Sicily. His love of foreign travel remained with him until the end of his life. He was not attracted by the beauties of nature but delighted in visiting scenes of historical importance, describing them in many of his books and letters. On his return to Oxford in May 1841 he was immediately embroiled in the controversy over <span class="roman">Tract 90</span>, which had appeared in February of that year. Far from condemning it, he concluded that it would allow Roman Catholics to become members of the church and universities of England, &#145;which I for one cannot deplore&#146;.<br>
<br>The sudden death of Thomas Arnold in June 1842 dismayed Stanley, but when Arnold's widow asked him to write the headmaster's life he devoted himself with great energy to this task. <span class="italic">The Life and Correspondence of Thomas Arnold</span>, published in May 1844, was perhaps Stanley's greatest work. As an official biography it tends to gloss over Arnold's defects, nor does it give much space to the controversies in which Arnold had engaged; but the author's close knowledge of his subject, the inclusion of Arnold's letters in the text, and a powerful description of Arnold's death make it an important contribution to the life of an eminent figure of that age.<br>
<br>In 1843 Stanley was appointed a college tutor and considerably raised the status of University College in the university. He was a strong supporter of religious toleration. He opposed both the university's condemnation of W. G. Ward in 1845 and the agitation against R. D. Hampden's appointment to the bishopric of Hereford two years later, protesting against the clamour with which the evangelicals assailed the former and conservative churchmen the latter. The sermons which he preached before the university were published with additions and appendices in November 1847 under the title <span class="italic">Sermons on the Apostolical Age</span>. In the preface he urged his readers to consider the contribution of German theologians to biblical studies, but he was not a great biblical scholar and the book made little impact.<br>
<br>On 6 September 1849 Stanley's father died. On 13 August in the same year Captain Charles Stanley RE, his younger brother, had died in Hobart, Tasmania, and on 13 March 1850 his other brother, Captain Owen Stanley RN, died on board HMS <i>Rattlesnake</i> in Sydney harbour. His older sister, Mary (<i>b</i>. 1812), never married. She went out to nurse in the Crimea, but her devotion to Florence Nightingale evaporated and in 1855 she returned to England, where in the following year she was received into the Roman Catholic church. Her conversion, however, did not lessen his affection for her and he continued to write her long and frequent letters which form an important source for Stanley's life. She died in 1879 and was buried at Alderley by her own request, with Stanley officiating. Catherine, his other sister (<i>b</i>. 1821), married Charles Vaughan, the headmaster of Harrow, who, when he was detected in an amorous relationship with one of his pupils, had to resign in 1859; Stanley helped to negotiate the terms of the resignation with the minimum of publicity. He saw much of Catherine after her husband became master of the Temple and went to live in London.<br>
<br>On the death of his father Stanley had to support his mother and sisters, but by his succession to a small estate he was obliged to resign his fellowship. He was offered the deanery of Carlisle, which he refused, and in July 1851 a canonry at Canterbury, which he accepted. Before leaving Oxford he had been appointed secretary to the Oxford University commission, whose report, partly composed by him, was published in March 1852. It recommended many reforms, including the creation of a new governing body for the university; the relaxation of the stipulation that all fellows of colleges should be ordained; the abolition of the distinction between noblemen, gentlemen commoners, and commoners; and the abrogation of the rule that all undergraduates must study the classics. The report was a triumph for the liberals of the university and provoked a violent reaction from the Tractarians led by E. B. Pusey.<h2>
<a name="Canterbury"></a>Canterbury</h2>Since the duties of a canon of Canterbury were not onerous, Stanley was able to make an extended tour of Egypt and the Holy Land in 1852 and 1853. Starting from Cairo he and his companions sailed up the Nile, which he found intolerably dull, but the great granite statues of Rameses and two other pharaohs at Thebes impressed him. They went as far south as Abu Simbel, but turned back to Cairo, climbed the pyramids, and then set out on camels for the Sinai peninsula, at that time visited only by the most intrepid of European travellers. In the monastery of St Catherine at the foot of Mount Sinai they found the great German scholar Tischendorf, who on a previous visit had discovered there an important biblical manuscript, the <span class="roman">Codex Sinaiticus</span>. After moving on to the Gulf of &#145;Aqabah, they turned up the defile that led to Petra, which Stanley pronounced to be a city not of bright colours, but of dull crimson, indigo, yellow, and purple. They reached Jerusalem on Easter eve 1853, from where they made expeditions to Nazareth, Damascus, Jericho, and the Dead Sea. The tour led to the publication of <span class="italic">Sinai and Palestine</span> in March 1856, Stanley's powers of observation and description, together with the unfamiliarity of the places that he had visited, making the book an instant success. It reached a fourth edition within a year, and as late as 1881 was still being reprinted.<br>
<br>In June 1855 Stanley had published a <span class="italic">Commentary on the Epistles to the Corinthians</span> as a companion work to Jowett's <span class="italic">Commentary on the Epistles to the Thessalonians, Galatians and Romans</span>. The young J. B. Lightfoot, later bishop of Durham, subjected Stanley's book to searching criticism in the <span class="italic">Journal of Classical and Sacred Philology</span> (3.81&#150;121) and concluded that the study of the biblical text was not his vocation. Nor was the book aided by Stanley's execrable handwriting, which led the printer to substitute &#145;the horn of the burning beast&#146; for &#145;the thorn of the burning bush&#146;. His delight in the history of Canterbury Cathedral led to a series of essays published as <span class="italic">Historical Memorials of Canterbury</span> in December 1854; here his gift of writing powerful, dramatic narrative found full scope, particularly in his account of the murder of Becket. On the anniversary of Becket's death he would marshall his family and friends round the scenes of the event<blockquote>till when at length, the chapel of the martyrdom was reached, as the last shades of twilight gathered among the arches, and the whole scene became so real, that, with almost a thrill of horror, one saw the last moments through one's ears! (A. J. C. Hare, <span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span>, 44.263, Sept 1881, 365)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Oxford"></a>Oxford</h2>In December 1856 Stanley was appointed regius professor of ecclesiastical history at Oxford, the chair being attached to a canonry at Christ Church, though he was not installed as canon until March 1858. He lectured frequently, his lectures forming the basis of his books <span class="italic">Three Introductory Lectures on the Study of Ecclesiastical History</span> (1857), <span class="italic">Lectures on the History of the Eastern Church</span> (1861), and <span class="italic">Lectures on the History of the Jewish Church</span> (3 pts, 1863&#150;76). In <span class="italic">Lectures on the History of the Eastern Church</span> he dealt in the first part with the church's history in the East down to the advent of Muhammad, and in the second part with a history of the Russian church from its foundation to his own time. He has little to say on theology or on Orthodox worship and spirituality, for to him the Eastern church appeared barbarous and stagnant, though he recognized that this had saved it from the restrictions of the Council of Trent and the divisions of the reformed churches. Icons he regarded as coarse paintings on smoke-darkened boards. But the book has verve and contains some telling details: Stanley relates that in the church of Alexandria for centuries, and still in the church of Armenia, the dead hand of the first bishop was employed as an instrument of consecration in succeeding generations.<br>
<br>At Oxford, Stanley was a stimulating teacher, acknowledged by John Richard Green as his mentor who had taught him not so much a creed as fairness. It was in pursuit of fairness that he campaigned for an increase in the miserly salary paid to the regius professor of Greek, who was now Jowett. He disapproved of some of the negative contents of <span class="italic">Essays and Reviews</span> (1860), but pleaded that the essayists had been unfairly treated. When in October 1862 there appeared the first volume of Colenso's radical revaluation of the <span class="roman">Pentateuch</span> he again championed the writer as &#145;an evidently honest and single-minded religious man&#146;, though he could not understand the book's mathematics.<br>
<br>In January 1862 Stanley was asked to accompany the prince of Wales on a tour of the Middle East, which took place between February and June of that year; it was not without tension, for the prince preferred shooting to the inspection of ancient sites and monuments. His <span class="italic">Sermons in the East</span> (1863) were preached during the tour, in the course of which his mother died on Ash Wednesday, 7 March, and was buried at Alderley. The tour brought him into greater royal favour, and also closer to Lady Augusta Bruce (1822&#150;1876) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/41342/', "Stanley, Lady Augusta Elizabeth Frederica")</script>], fifth daughter of the seventh earl of Elgin; the brother of Augusta, General Bruce, was the prince's governor and in charge of the tour. General Bruce died in London in 1862 of a fever caught in the marshes of the upper Jordan.<br>
<br>On 22 December 1863 Stanley was married quietly to Lady Augusta in Westminster Abbey. She was a woman of the bedchamber to Queen Victoria, who was greatly displeased at losing Augusta's services and thought the marriage to be most unnecessary. It took time for them to work themselves back into the royal confidence, but at last the queen accepted the situation. She called Stanley &#145;the little Dean&#146;; he was 5 feet 5&frac14; inches tall, his chief facial feature being a sharply pointed nose. Thereafter he and Augusta were often at Windsor, where the queen frequently consulted Stanley on matters of church and state, admiring his liberal principles, though she found his temperament so cold that he seemed to her sexless. Nor were the visits only one way, for in 1869 she took tea at the Westminster deanery where, among others, she met Carlyle and Browning.<h2>
<a name="WestminsterAbbey"></a>Westminster Abbey</h2>On 9 January 1864 Stanley was installed as dean of Westminster in succession to Richard Chenevix Trench, who had become archbishop of Dublin. A prayer used at his installation declared that one purpose of his office was to encourage &#145;the enlargement of the Christian church&#146;, which he interpreted to mean that the Church of England should aim to be comprehensive; this also implied for him a close relationship between the church and state. He therefore invited to preach in the abbey clergy of many schools of thought, from the Tractarians Keble and Pusey (though they both declined), to evangelicals such as William Thomson, the archbishop of York, taking in liberals such as Frederick Temple on the way. In convocation he argued unsuccessfully that the Athanasian creed should be removed from the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, and in 1870 invited Dr Vance Smith, a Unitarian minister on the commission which was revising the Authorized Version of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, to receive communion in the abbey. The historical associations of the great church also excited him and led him to write <span class="italic">Memorials of Westminster Abbey</span>, published in 1868, heavily laden with descriptions of its innumerable monuments.<br>
<br>Stanley's sympathies, however, extended far beyond Westminster. In Scotland he was elected rector of the University of St Andrews, which he visited in March 1875. His <span class="italic">Lectures on the Church of Scotland</span> (1872) and <span class="italic">Addresses and Sermons Delivered at St Andrews</span> (1877) illustrate his interest in Scottish history. In 1877 he visited North America, which resulted in another book, <span class="italic">Addresses and Sermons Delivered in the United States and Canada</span> (1879). Augusta had died three years earlier, so he was accompanied by George Grove, famous for his dictionary of music and musicians, and by Gerald Harper, a doctor and friend of his sister, Catherine, appointed to look after his health. From Boston he travelled via Philadelphia and Baltimore to Washington where he met the president, Rutherford Birchard Hayes, and went on to New York and Niagara Falls before he crossed into Canada. At Montreal he met the governor-general, the marquess of Dufferin and Ava, and accompanied him to Quebec. He returned to the United States, stayed with Emerson at Concord, and made a final visit to New York before returning to England.<br>
<br>Stanley's conviction that church and state should be firmly linked led to his decision to forbid the use of the abbey to the bishops attending the first Lambeth conference in 1867. This was on the grounds that it had not been summoned by the secular authority, as the first general councils of the church had been, but by bishops; he also feared that it would condemn Colenso. His last book, <span class="italic">Christian Institutions</span> (1881), advanced the view that the material element in religion was minimal and also stressed the importance of the laity in the church. He had a considerable affinity with the Quakers, which went back to the years when his father was at Norwich and he had come into contact with the great Quaker family of Gurney.<br>
<br>In January 1874 Stanley had officiated at the Anglican marriage service in St Petersburg at the wedding of Prince Alfred, the second son of Queen Victoria, and Princess Marie, the only daughter of the tsar, which took place when the service according to the Orthodox rite had been performed. There was also a brief visit to Moscow. Augusta had gone with him, but on her return she was taken ill and after months of suffering died on Ash Wednesday, 1 March 1876. The queen authorized her burial in the abbey and, hidden from sight, watched the funeral from a private pew looking down into the nave; she thought the service was too long, though she was much distressed.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1881 Stanley was taken ill while preaching a course of sermons on the beatitudes in the abbey. It proved to be erysipelas, and he died on Monday 18 July at the deanery, Westminster. He was buried the following Monday in the King Henry VII Chapel of Westminster Abbey by the side of his wife. The pallbearers at his funeral included the duke of Westminster, Matthew Arnold, Benjamin Jowett, W. H. Smith, and W. E. Forster, as well as representatives from the Church of Scotland and English nonconformist churches, and indicated the breadth of his interests in the church and nation. The queen lamented the passing of her beloved Dean Stanley, who was more to her than any bishop or archbishop, and Matthew Arnold commemorated his death in the poem &#145;Westminster Abbey&#146;, in which he told the legend of how St Peter himself had consecrated the church, when a fisherman had seen it glorified in light. Now, more than twelve hundred years later, Stanley had shed more light on Westminster.<br>
<br>Stanley's writings proved to possess considerable staying power, and as late as the 1920s Evelyn Waugh noted in <span class="italic">Decline and Fall</span> that his <span class="italic">Lectures on the History of the Eastern Church</span> was still being read in Oxford. While his theological works have outlived their usefulness his travel books, with their descriptions of foreign scenes and his reaction to them, are still of interest; so also is his life of Thomas Arnold, which remains important for the study of that famous headmaster. Since his death his vision of a comprehensive church has been partly realized in the ecumenical movement and in the gatherings of representatives of different faiths, but the link between the Church of England and the state has become weaker, a development which he would not have regarded with any favour.<br>
