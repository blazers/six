</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Delane,  John Thadeus</span>  (1817&#150;1879), <span class="occ">newspaper editor</span>, was born on 11 October 1817 at South Molton Street, London, the second of the nine children of William Delane (1793&#150;1857), barrister and treasurer of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, and his wife, Mary Ann White (<i>d</i>. 1869), niece of Colonel John Babington. The family was descended from the Delaneys of Mountreth, Queen's county, Ireland. Delane's childhood was spent at his father's house at Easthampstead, Berkshire, within a united family. After early education at private schools, Delane attended King's College, London, from 1833 to 1835, and then received private tuition from Dr Jeremiah Bowles at Faringdon Hall, Oxfordshire, before entering Magdalen Hall, Oxford, in 1836. At Oxford Delane's exploitation of his natural talents, especially his quickness of apprehension and resourcefulness, compensated for some lack of application to his studies. He enjoyed many forms of sport, and once got the better of a former prizefighter, &#145;the Chicken of Wheatley&#146;, in a confrontation between students and quarrymen. At Oxford, as throughout his life, horse-riding was Delane's favourite exercise, to the extent that his tutor once remarked: &#145;We must remember that he, like the centaurs of old, is part and parcel of his horse&#146;  (Dasent, 1.18). Delane was attracted at this time to the Oxford Movement and, though he never discussed his religion, he was throughout his life a sincere and tolerant Anglican.<br>
<br>Delane graduated BA in July 1840 and was immediately employed by <span class="italic">The Times</span>, for which his father had been treasurer since 1831. There was also social contact between the Delane and Walter families, who were neighbours in Berkshire. John Walter (1776&#150;1847), chief proprietor of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, had recognized John Delane's potential and now took steps to develop it through experience in a range of reporting and editorial tasks under the direction of the editor, Thomas Barnes. Barnes was in failing health, and died in May 1841 without an obvious successor. Walter appointed Delane to the vacancy, causing an elated twenty-three year old to exclaim to his fellow lodger, the publisher John Blackwood, &#145;By Jove, John, what do you think has happened? I am editor of <span class="italic">The Times</span>&#146;  (Dasent, 1.26). He was to retain the position for thirty-six years.<br>
<br>At first Delane was merely the chief editorial lieutenant, supervising matters already defined by the chief proprietor. However, the title of &#145;editor&#146; soon gained Delane's admission to circles where political intelligence could be gathered. Delane had superlative abilities in this regard, as well as a sharp eye for good news stories. He quickly won the confidence and loyalty of the old guard of reporters and established good working relationships with his leader writers, though he directed from above whereas Barnes had done so from within. After only two years of Delane's editorship a former editor noted that <span class="italic">The Times</span> had become mild, argumentative, and discriminating, in contrast to its thundering reputation under Barnes.<br>
<br>Delane had quickly learned that moderation is strength, but in 1847 the strength of his own position was seriously threatened by a fracture in the relationship of trust between the chief proprietor and his father. The cause was a misleading financial statement prepared by the treasurer. John Walter, terminally ill, decided that William Delane must go, and that he must surrender his <span class="italic">Times</span> shares. Delane's father would not accept the terms offered, and the continuance of the dispute over several months placed Delane in a very difficult position. His call to the bar in May 1847 suggests private doubts as to the outcome. Eventually William Delane was persuaded, for the sake of his son's future, to agree to Walter's terms. Within a few days Walter was dead.<br>
<br>The new chief proprietor was his eldest son, also John Walter (1818&#150;1894), a year younger than Delane, who wished to combine control of <span class="italic">The Times</span> with his duties as a landowner and member of parliament. He needed Delane to take full editorial responsibility, but this did not stop Walter, especially in the early years, from taking a close interest in the paper's content and editorial direction, which Delane sometimes resented. Nevertheless there ensued a relationship of mutual respect shading into friendship, in which Walter played the role of constitutional monarch to Delane's prime minister. Delane ran <span class="italic">The Times</span> like a great department of state, and managed the editorial side brilliantly. A measure of Delane's achievement is in the circulation figures. These progressed from about 20,000 copies in 1842 to a sustained level of more than 60,000 copies throughout the last decade of Delane's editorship, despite pressure from cheaper competing titles.<br>
<br>Delane's first major exclusive was published in December 1845, when <span class="italic">The Times</span> announced the imminent repeal of the corn laws on the basis of information from Lord Aberdeen, Peel's foreign secretary. The close understanding which developed between Delane and Aberdeen provided a valuable political tutelage. Delane greatly respected Aberdeen as his mentor during this early stage of his editorial career. The later close relationship with Palmerston developed only after a long period during which <span class="italic">The Times</span> had generally opposed his policies. An intuitive ability to see &#145;how it will look tomorrow&#146; was an important factor in Delane's success as a journalist. He was particularly adept in the art of &#145;journalistic curvature&#146;, the process by which the editor steered opinions into new directions which his finely tuned political antennae told him governments would presently follow. Although this practice led to criticism of <span class="italic">The Times</span> for vacillation, it was also crucial to the paper's reputation and influence. In its implementation Delane was ever careful not to require leader writers to write in support of views and policies with which they did not agree.<br>
<br>Under Delane's editorship <span class="italic">The Times</span> was loosely identified with Liberalism, but his main concern was always to maintain the paper's independence, so as to be able to support governments without being their organ. This support was lent rather than given, and could at any time be replaced by criticism or outright opposition. The power of <span class="italic">The Times</span> in opposition to government was seen very clearly during the Crimean War, when Delane felt it was his duty to condemn those directing the war. Kinglake wrote of the great journal using its leadership &#145;to speak, nay, almost one may say to act, in the name of a united people&#146;  (Kinglake, 203).<br>
<br>That Delane was &#145;the man who worked <span class="italic">The Times</span>&#146; was universally known, but in exercising this role he maintained the closest anonymity. Only once was &#145;the man in the mask&#146; forced to break cover. During an acrimonious dispute with Richard Cobden in 1863&#151;over views expressed by John Bright and Cobden respecting the distribution of landed property&#151;Delane argued, in a letter which Cobden published, that public questions were &#145;best discussed, not between Mr Cobden and Mr Delane, but as it has always been the practice of the English press to discuss them&#151;anonymously&#146;  (Dasent, 2.89). In certain directions Delane enhanced the editor's reputation at the paper's expense, and the man became inseparable, in the world's eyes, from the paper. A late twentieth-century assessment, by Stephen Koss, is that it was Delane who formulated a principle that &#145;the duty of the press is to speak; of the statesman to be silent&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 6 Feb 1852), in which privilege was mistaken for duty and abused. In his lifetime Delane was widely regarded as the unquestioned head of the journalistic profession, who had done much to raise the tone of journalism. Some of his innovative methods of reporting news, which included the use of interviews, and his Crimean and other &#145;crusades&#146;, foreshadowed the &#145;new journalism&#146; of the later nineteenth century. In a centennial tribute William Stebbing referred to the extraordinary degree to which Delane won the admiration of rival journalists and concluded that he had been the ideal editor.<br>
<br>In the social circles which Delane frequented, constantly on the alert for political intelligence, he was welcomed as a delightful companion. He was observant, critical, somewhat reserved, and imperturbably calm, but among friends he would talk animatedly and without restraint. When other men opened their minds, Delane measured them, but all who confided in him knew he would scrupulously respect their trust. As editor Delane was seen as a proud, harsh man, a hard taskmaster who was also true, sincere, and kind-hearted. His idea of dignified happiness was that of a country gentleman, and in mid-life this robust man, with his florid complexion, bright eyes, and genial smile between mutton-chop whiskers, looked the part. In the 1860s Delane still paid his morning calls on horseback before riding to the House of Commons. He claimed to have been the last man to ride through Fleet Street to the West End, on one occasion with a duke walking on either side as he proceeded slowly down Whitehall. He was elected to the Reform Club (1857) and to the Athenaeum (1862). In 1874 he was appointed deputy lieutenant for Berkshire.<br>
<br>Although Delane wrote little for publication&#151;his peculiar facility as a journalist was in polishing and sharpening articles written by others&#151;he was a prolific letter and note writer. Every day he wrote terse and vigorous directions to his leader writers, letters of advice, instruction and criticism to foreign and war correspondents, letters to friends, and an account of the day's activities to his mother. Few Indian mails failed to include letters to two brothers, who were army officers there. All these were written with a quill pen dipped in an inkstand formed from the hoof of a favourite horse. Letters written on holidays show a persistent interest in distances, speeds, and prices. Delane expected all leading articles to be written, like his own notes of instruction, in good simple English, without slang or technicality. He watched with the utmost care every detail of expression, and thereby exerted a valuable influence on the standard of correct English writing. Henry Wace, a regular contributor to <span class="italic">The Times</span> and dean of Canterbury, considered Delane a good scholar, lawyer, and doctor&#151;he had studied for a time in Paris under Fran&ccedil;ois Magendie, an eminent physiologist. But politics was what really interested him.<br>
<br>Delane married, on 9 August 1842, Fanny Horatia Serle Bacon, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Twiss (1818&#150;1874), widow of Francis Bacon, assistant editor under Barnes, and daughter of Horace Twiss (1787&#150;1849), barrister. Her grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27916/', "Francis Twiss")</script>. There were no children from the marriage. Fanny Delane became mentally ill, and from 1853 until her death in 1874 had to be confined. Throughout this period of &#145;married widowhood&#146; Delane wrote constantly to his wife and kept all her letters to him. His personal correspondence during these years not surprisingly hints at loneliness and frustration, and he often comments on beautiful women he met in society. When first appointed editor Delane lived at 4 Chatham Place, Blackfriars, &#145;to be near his work&#146;, then at 22 New Bridge Street, before settling from about 1847 at 16 Serjeants' Inn, Temple. In 1858 he bought a property at Ascot Heath, to which he retreated whenever possible.<br>
<br>The editor's daily routine was both arduous&#151;a sixteen-hour working day seems to have been usual&#151;and stressful, demanding a peak of mental effort in the small hours. Delane's hand was firmly on all departments. Although he took regular holidays during parliamentary recesses, these were often largely spent in meetings with foreign correspondents and statesmen. Delane's commitment to <span class="italic">The Times</span> was total. He told John Walter, following an illness in 1861, &#145;My whole life is bound up with the paper&#151;I must either work for it or not at all&#146;  (Dasent, 2.27).<br>
<br>His mother's death in 1869 affected Delane very much, and after 1870 he was often seriously ill from overwork, asthma, bronchitis, and gout. W. H. Russell found him in April 1877 &#145;thin, old, bowed, speaking slowly, with glassy eye&#146;  (Cook, 259). Even before Delane retired, after attending to the issue for 9 November 1877, effective control had been discreetly and informally assumed by others. Delane's final months were spent at Ascot Heath, cared for by his unmarried sister. He died on 22 November 1879 and was buried in Easthampstead churchyard, Berkshire, on 29 November 1879.<br>
