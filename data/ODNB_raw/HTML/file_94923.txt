</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Weschke,  Karl Martin</span>  (1925&#150;2005), <span class="occ">artist</span>, was born on 7 June 1925 in Taubenpreskeln, near Gera, Thuringia, Germany, the second of three children, by different fathers, of Else Emma Weschke. He met his father, Heinrich Hermann Hanke (<i>b</i>. 1905), only once, in 1936. On his marriage certificates he listed Hanke's occupation as politician or political activist, but in his Buchenwald concentration camp record Hanke was listed as a merchant. Hanke may have died at Buchenwald during the Second World War. He was certainly dead by 1947.<br>
<br>Else, whom Weschke described as a woman of loose morals, abandoned her son to an orphanage in 1927, but reclaimed him in 1932. She enrolled him in the local <i>Volkschule</i>, but two years later they moved to Gera, where Else found a job as an ice cream vendor, with Weschke pulling the carts. He spent his spare time drawing the fine buildings. He left school in 1940 and found an apprenticeship with an ornamental blacksmith. However, his mother insisted that he take up a post with a state insurance office, first in Gera, then in Gotha. Bored by this work, and imbued with the spirit of the Third Reich, in 1942 he volunteered for <i>Arbeitsdienst</i> (labour service) followed by service, behind the lines, in the Luftwaffe. Then, in 1945, tired of inaction, he volunteered to be a paratrooper and was thrown into the defence of 's-Hertogenbosch, where he was captured by the Canadians and dispatched to Britain as a prisoner of war.<br>
<br>Shunted around the country from camp to camp, by the summer of 1947 Weschke found himself at camp 180 in Radwinter, near Saffron Walden. There he came under the kindly care of Charles Stambrook (formerly Karl Sternberg), a Jewish refugee. Camp 180 was relatively open and prisoners were allowed out two nights a week to study. Weschke enrolled with the Cambridge University extramural board to study &#145;Wesen der Sprache der Kunst&#146; (&#145;the nature and language of art&#146;), a course presented by Rudolph Wallfried at St John's College. Weschke's mind was opened to a world of European culture and, in particular, his German heritage, of which he had little prior knowledge. Another important contact at Radwinter was the Quaker Bessie Midgley, a member of the Fry family, who held open house to German prisoners and introduced him to Tom Driberg. Weschke was then transferred to Wilton Park where he was re-educated in political matters. In his spare time he was taken by Driberg to see exhibitions in London.<br>
<br>On 12 July 1948, soon after his release, Weschke married Alison Frances de Vere (1927&#150;2001), a student at the Royal Academy, whom he had met through Driberg. He registered for the sculpture course at St Martin's School of Art but abandoned it after one term and took up painting, picking up the craft as he went along. While at St Martin's he met the painter Dorothy Mead, who introduced him to members of the Borough Group, followers of David Bomberg, with whom he felt a certain affinity. To hone his drawing skills he observed the dance classes of Vera Volkova in Covent Garden and sketched rapidly from life. He also spent many hours looking at the collections of the Tate and National galleries. A trip to Spain in 1953 left a lasting impression.<br>
<br>Although they were to remain lifelong friends, in 1950 Weschke and de Vere parted company. In 1954 he travelled to Sweden with a new partner, Lore Grage, a German national, with whom he fathered his first child, Rachel (<i>b</i>. 1955). In Sweden he painted and drew the landscape as a dark brooding presence, influenced not only by the German expressionist heritage with which he had come to identify but by the paintings of Goya and Velazquez. Still classed as an alien, he was helped to return to Britain by de Vere and Driberg. After a brief sojourn in Scotland, in 1955 he moved to Zennor in Cornwall, where he was joined temporarily by Lore. However, without a permit she had to return to Germany, taking Rachel with her. Lore and Weschke agreed that Weschke would have no further contact with his daughter. In 1956 he fathered a second child, Benjamin (Ben), this time with de Vere. They subsequently divorced, in 1958.<br>
<br>Weschke had come to Cornwall with the help of the painter Bryan Wynter. Wynter found him a place to rent, Tregerthen Cottages, where D. H. Lawrence had once resided. Weschke soon became part of the community of artists identified with St Ives, although he always remained on its fringes. He developed close friendships with Roger Hilton and the Scottish poet W. S. Graham, both of whom regarded themselves, like Weschke, as outsiders in Cornwall. At this time his paintings bore some stylistic community with those of the St Ives artists. He painted abstracted landscapes and figure subjects with a thick impasto influenced by the then fashionable Nicolas de Sta&euml;l, but his palette of colours was significantly different, being sombre and limited in tonal variation. Unlike most of his colleagues he did not confine himself to landscape but tackled major themes relating to religion and history. On the recommendation of Bryan Robertson his <span class="italic">Deposition Triptych</span> (1958&#150;9) was purchased by the Art Gallery of New South Wales from his exhibition at the Woodstock Gallery.<br>
<br>A second son, Lucas, was born in 1958, to Jan Green. In 1960 Weschke moved to a house on Cape Cornwall, where, with the exception of a few years in Gloucestershire, he spent the rest of his life. It was a one-storey, former tin mine engine house with views over the moors and cliffs and down to the Atlantic Ocean. Remote and subject to the full force of Atlantic storms, it was an appropriate dwelling for a painter of expressive landscapes and figure paintings. Two years later he and Jan split up and, on 24 December 1963, he had a brief marriage to Marie-Liese Norma Cynthia (Liese) Dennis (1939&#150;2005), a fashion model. In spite of his turbulent private life his painting career was beginning to go well, with exhibitions at Matthiessens Gallery and the Grosvenor Gallery and inclusion in a number of important group exhibitions, such as <span class="roman">British Painting in the Sixties</span> (1963) at the Tate and Whitechapel art galleries. After separation from Liese (they were divorced in 1968) his relationship with Jan was rekindled and a fourth child, Lore, was born in 1966. Within two years the relationship encountered difficulties and, with his career put on hold, he moved to Gloucestershire, where he began a relationship with Madeleine Frye.<br>
<br>The female nude had by then become a central motif in Weschke's paintings, frequently depicted in distressing situations with mythological overtones. Sometimes the nude was shown molested by a dog modelled on a borzoi, named Dankoff, that Weschke owned. Nearly always the theme was suggested by a common-day event Weschke had witnessed. Vulnerability, violation, and isolation were the themes of his work, painted in his characteristic ochre and earth colours, sometimes punctuated by a claret red or sombre blue. In <span class="italic">Study for the Women of Berlin</span> (1969&#150;70), painted at the height of the Vietnam war, Weschke brought all these themes together. In 1971 he held a solo exhibition at the Bear Lane Gallery, Oxford, and a further show in Plymouth, Bristol, Leeds, and Glasgow. That same year, with Madeleine, he moved back to Cape Cornwall. Lucas and Lore came to live with them. In 1972 Madeleine bore him a fifth child, Rachel, named after his lost first-born. Within months, however, the relationship foundered and they separated.<br>
<br>Weschke's career seemed to have reached a high point when he was offered a one-man show at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in 1974, but the exhibition was greeted by critical silence, largely, he maintained, on account of hostility towards its new director, Jasia Reichardt, whose appointment had aroused controversy. Apart from inclusion in occasional group exhibitions, for five years his career entered the doldrums. In 1980, however, he was invited to hold a solo exhibition at Kettle's Yard Gallery, Cambridge. Earlier that year the Arts Council had purchased <span class="italic">The Meeting</span> (1974) and following the Kettle's Yard show the Tate Gallery acquired <span class="italic">Body on the Beach</span> (1977). Weschke's art, with its sombre palette and undertones of violence, represented his existentialist outlook on life. The landscape was that of the moors viewed from his studio window; the women depicted were, more often than not, his partners. There was also an erotic side to his imagination that emerged in various studies of the female nude, often cloaked in mythology, such as in <span class="italic">Leda and the Swan</span> (1985&#150;6).<br>
<br>Around this time Weschke began a relationship with Petronilla Spencer-Silver, then working at the Contemporary Art Society, which was to endure for the rest of his life. In 1988 Television South West made a documentary about him, <span class="italic">Memory of Sweetness</span>. The following year he made drawings for an animated film, <span class="italic">Psyche and Eros</span> (1994), directed by de Vere. Success now followed success as the Tate Gallery acquired three further paintings and he was shortlisted for the Jerwood painting prize (1995). Sales generated the ability to travel and Weschke went to Egypt in 1990, 1992, and 1997. The trips had a direct impact on his art, not only in his choice of subjects, which now included Egyptian temples, the pyramids, and the Nile landscape, but also in the brightening of his palette, in particular by the introduction of cobalt blue, a colour that earlier in his career he had not been able to afford. Even when painting the familiar nude theme back in a Cornish setting his treatment was marked by the experience of Egypt. There was a new boldness to his vision and a sense of liberation, of having left the oppressiveness of his early life behind. The publication in 1998 of <span class="italic">Karl Weschke: Portrait of a Painter</span> by Jeremy Lewison, shortly after Weschke underwent a heart bypass operation, provided a further stimulus to his reputation. He became the subject of a German documentary film, <span class="italic">Karl Weschke: Ein deutscher Maler in Cornwall</span>, and was invited to hold a retrospective exhibition at the Kunstsammlung Gera, his first show in Germany. The broadcast of this documentary on German television led to contact from his first-born child, Rachel, with whom he was ultimately reunited.<br>
<br>Weschke remained a German citizen throughout his life and was finally recognized in his native Germany by the award of the order of merit by the Federal Republic of Germany in 2003. On 12 October the same year he married Petronilla. The enjoyment of such recognition was short-lived, however. In 2004, the year of his retrospective exhibition at Tate St Ives, he was diagnosed with cancer of the brain. He died at St Julia's Hospice, Hayle, on 20 February 2005 and was cremated at Penmount crematorium, Truro, on 28 February. His long-standing friend, David Cornwell (known as John le Carr&eacute;) paid tribute to him at a celebratory memorial meeting held on 15 March 2005.<br>
