<span class="headword">Cooper,  Christopher</span>  (1655?&#150;1698), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and Church of England clergyman</span>, was according to Dobson, probably born in 1655 as he &#145;would be about 20 when he took his BA&#146;  (Dobson, 1.281). Cooper's birthplace is unknown, but it could well have been Buntingford in north Hertfordshire, where on the basis of the dedication of his <span class="italic">Grammatica</span> to Seth Ward, the bishop of Salisbury, it is thought that he was a charity boy of the local poorhouse. As a young man he evidently caught the attention of the Buntingford-born bishop, for it was Ward who enabled Cooper to go up to Cambridge: Cooper matriculated and was admitted to Corpus Christi College in 1672. He received his BA degree in 1676, proceeded MA in 1680, and was incorporated at Oxford in 1694. On 21 May 1676 he was ordained deacon in London. In view of his later career, it is likely that he was the Cooper who preached a sermon at St Michael's, Bishop's Stortford, on 11 March 1684. By the time his <span class="italic">Grammatica</span> was published in 1685, Cooper had already become headmaster of Bishop's Stortford grammar school in east Hertfordshire, and on 11 March 1686 he became vicar of St Michael's in the same town.<br>
<br>Cooper was responsible for two published grammars: the <span class="italic">Grammatica linguae Anglicanae</span> (1685) and <span class="italic">The English Teacher</span> (1687). The second, a translation of two parts of the first, has little grammar, but a great deal on pronunciation: it is for this work that Cooper is hailed by Dobson as the greatest of the seventeenth-century phoneticians, on the basis of the completeness and accuracy of his systematic analysis of a southern dialect of English, which Cooper sees as being the most acceptable as a standard. Dobson attributes Cooper's lack of scholarly fame to the fact that he neither was innovatory, nor tried to discover universal principles, the vogue of the time. Instead he devoted himself to &#145;the practical task of teaching English pronunciation, spelling and grammar&#146;  (Dobson, 1.280). Although Cooper's phonetic system reflects the typical seventeenth-century desire for symmetry and is therefore flawed to modern eyes, he was sufficiently precise in his aim to provide the &#145;vim et rationem&#146; (&#145;force and account&#146;) of letters, in emulation of the linguist John Wallis, to recognize that the short variants of the close tense vowels were closer to e and o than to i and u  (Cooper, <span class="italic">Grammatica</span>, sig. A5<i>r</i>). Similarly he provides evidence for the survival of an (ou) diphthong, at least in his own speech, longer than has been previously thought. This is not just a reflection of spelling, for, according to Dobson, Cooper &#145;holds that we should not attempt to follow the etymon if it leads us to prefer a spelling which represents the pronunciation less well than an existing alternative would do&#146;  (Dobson, 1.284). Cooper's vowel system is clearly dependent on Wallis's previous work, but takes into account both the modifications of intervening phoneticians and well-observed differences in his own speech. Cooper remained living at Bishop's Stortford until his death there in 1698.<br>
