<span class="headword">Ashmole,  Bernard</span>  (1894&#150;1988), <span class="occ">archaeologist and art historian</span>, was born on 22 June 1894 in Ilford, Essex, the youngest in a family of two sons and three daughters of William Ashmole, auctioneer and estate agent, and his wife, Sarah Caroline Wharton, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Tiver. Both parents had strong literary and religious interests. He was educated at Forest School (1903&#150;11) and in 1913 went to Hertford College, Oxford, with a classics scholarship. In 1914, having taken pass moderations, he was commissioned in the 11th Royal Fusiliers, served in France, and was severely wounded on the River Somme. He was awarded the MC in 1917. Back in Oxford, he obtained an ordinary pass degree and went on to study for the diploma in classical archaeology under the guidance of Percy Gardner and John Beazley. He developed an interest in numismatics, but classical sculpture was to be his main interest for the rest of his academic career and he helped catalogue the collection in the Palazzo dei Conservatori in Rome and, later, that in Ince Blundell Hall, Lancashire (1929). In 1920 he married Dorothy Irene de Peyer (<i>d</i>. 1991), daughter of Everard de Peyer, chartered accountant. A biographer remarked that &#145;anyone who knew the couple finds it hard to think of them apart&#146;. They had two daughters and a son.<br>
<br>In 1923 Ashmole had taken his BLitt at Oxford and joined the staff of the coin room in the Ashmolean Museum there. (He was a collateral descendant of the founder, Elias Ashmole.) He was persuaded in 1925 to take up the directorship of the British School at Rome, which he held until 1928. In 1929 he was appointed to the Yates chair of classical archaeology at University College, London, adding to this the part-time keepership of the Greek and Roman department in the British Museum in 1939. Here he had to supervise the packing of its treasures on the outbreak of war in 1939.<br>
<br>Ashmole was commissioned as a pilot officer in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, serving in Britain, Greece, and the Middle and Far East, and returning as a wing commander. He was twice mentioned in dispatches. After the war ended in 1945, he supervised the reinstallation of his department in the British Museum, giving up his chair in 1948 to become a full-time keeper. In 1956 he was persuaded to succeed Beazley to the Lincoln chair of classical archaeology and art at Oxford, where, as a fellow of Lincoln College, he served until his retirement in 1961. This was followed by busy travelling and visiting appointments at Aberdeen, Yale, Cincinnati, and Malibu, where he advised J. Paul Getty on the purchase of antiquities, and also by fieldwork, at the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus in Turkey.<br>
<br>Ashmole was not a prolific scholar, but all his writing was characterized by a precision of learning and perceptivity that made him an unrivalled and internationally recognized authority on classical sculpture. This was displayed by concise articles, not without some acidity when dealing with the inadequacy of others, and perhaps best enjoyed in his lectures, notably the Semple lectures (<span class="italic">The Classical Ideal in Greek Sculpture</span>, 1964) and the books <span class="italic">Olympia</span> (with Nicholas Yalouris, 1967) and <span class="italic">Architect and Sculptor in Classical Greece</span> (1972). By looking beyond connoisseurship of Greek sculpture to the problems of its context and logistics of its creation he demonstrated the value of the study to many other fields of classical archaeology. His memorable lecturing style was quiet yet dominating, but as a teacher he was probably most influential through the example he set. He had a remarkable skill for organization, which showed in his scholarship no less than in his work on the British Museum collections before and after the war, in his installation of the cast collections in University College, London, and in Oxford in the Ashmolean's new building in 1961.<br>
<br>Ashmole's interest in art did not stop with antiquity: he was the friend of contemporary artists, even adviser to the f&ecirc;ted <span class="italic">I, Claudius</span> film of 1936 with Charles Laughton; and in the late 1920s he commissioned from the architect A. D. Connell one of the first concrete-frame houses in Britain, High and Over, near Amersham, Buckinghamshire. His practicality ranged from the design of garden fountains cast in concrete in upturned umbrellas to a rare skill with the camera which he employed to good effect on ancient sculpture. His collection of sculpture photographs was given to King's College, London (the Ashmole archive), with copies in the Beazley archive at the Ashmolean Museum. He was in many respects not the last of an older generation of scholars but the first of the new, displaying in his work and life the finer standards of his predecessors and adding an almost non-academic breadth and originality.<br>
<br>Ashmole was made a fellow of the British Academy in 1938, was appointed CBE in 1957, and became honorary associate of RIBA in 1928. He was an honorary fellow of Hertford (1961) and Lincoln (1980) colleges, Oxford, and of University College, London (1974). Aberdeen awarded him an honorary LLD (1968). He was an honorary member of the Archeological Institute of America (1940) and the Archaeological Society of Athens (1978), and was awarded the Kenyon medal of the British Academy in 1979.<br>
<br>Ashmole was a tall, slim man; his bearing was almost military but tempered by a sprightliness of step and unforced charm. In 1972 he and his wife moved to Peebles, Scotland, to be near their son, and he died there on 25 February 1988. He was buried at St Mary's, Iffley, Oxfordshire.<br>
