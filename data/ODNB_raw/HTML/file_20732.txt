<span class="headword">Oliver,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1610?), <span class="occ">mathematician and physician</span>, was perhaps the Thomas Oliver who entered Christ's College, Cambridge, in November 1569. He may have gained a medical degree since, by 1597, he was working as a physician in Bury St Edmunds. He numbered among his patrons both Lord Petre of Ingatestone and Henry Howard, earl of Northampton.<br>
<br>Oliver showed his extensive mathematical knowledge in a work on astronomy which he published in 1601. This was entitled <span class="italic">A New Handling of the Planisphere</span> and was intended as a means for solving astronomical problems by the use of ruler and compass, thus obviating the need for expensive instruments. The instrument of the title was simply a circular piece of brass with circular scales for degrees, the zodiac, and the hours of the day, and fitted with sights and a plummet. It could be used for various astronomical observations and was obviously designed as an alternative to the astrolabe. The book includes a clear exposition of cosmography but the use of the instrument is rather more convoluted, involving a great many geometrical constructions. In the preface Oliver acknowledged his debt to Christopher Clavius for his writing on the astrolabe.<br>
<br>Oliver's only other published work was a set of four tracts bound in a single volume and printed in Cambridge. These were written between 1597 and 1603 on a wide range of subjects. The first was a treatise on Aristotelian philosophy, the second addressed various geometrical problems, the third was a medical paper, and the fourth considered the question of squaring the circle. These were dedicated to various academics in both Cambridge and W&uuml;rzburg, including Lancelot Browne and William Butler. There are also two manuscript treatises of his in the British Library entitled &#145;Tabula longitudinum et latitudinum locorum memorabilium in Europa&#146; and &#145;Mechanica circuli quadratura cum equatione cubi et sphaerae&#146;.<br>
<br>Oliver remained in Bury St Edmunds until the end of his life. His will was proved in 1610, suggesting that he died in that year.<br>
