<span class="headword">Harding, Sir  Robert Palmer</span>  (1821&#150;1893), <span class="occ">accountant</span>, was born on 18 February 1821, the son of Robert Harding (<i>d</i>. 1862), an auctioneer and house agent. It is thought that he had originally operated a fashionable West End hatters, a business which ran into difficulties, and according to legend a court official advised him to embark on a career in accountancy. He established a practice in July 1847, entered a partnership with Edward Pullein in August 1848, and by 1850 the firm operated from 16 Gresham Street in the City of London. In November 1857 Frederick Whinney, who joined Harding and Pullein as a clerk in December 1849, was admitted as a partner. In December 1858 James Boatwright Gibbons joined the partnership, which continued as Harding, Pullein, Whinney, and Gibbons from January 1859. Harding remained the senior partner until October 1883, when he retired from the firm, which by then was named Harding, Whinney &amp; Co.<br>
<br>As a specialist in liquidations and bankruptcy work, Harding was in 1864 appointed a commissioner to inquire into the working of the <span class="roman">Bankruptcy Acts</span>. In 1866 he was appointed (in conjunction with William Turquand) liquidator of Overend, Gurney &amp; Co., a long-term bank liquidation which was finalized only weeks before Harding's death. He also liquidated other large concerns, including Marylebone Bank (from 1853), Royal British Bank (1856), Mexican and South American Co. (1857), Professional Life, Life Assurance Treasury, National Assurance (Bank of Deposit) (all in 1861), Unity General Assurance (1864), and East India and London Shipping (1866). In 1866 the select committee on the limited liability acts revealed that Harding, Whinney, and Gibbons was handling the winding up of sixty-one of the 259 companies then in liquidation. Such commitments appear to have presented Harding with limited scope for audit engagements. Nevertheless, he was the auditor of the Central Argentine Railway, and he secured Morgan Bros., the Battersea iron founders, as a client of the firm.<br>
<br>Harding was a founding father of professional accountancy in Britain. He was among the thirty-seven accountants to sign the draft rules of the Institute of Accountants in London, founded in 1870. Later, he became a founder of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW), and was its vice-president when the charter of incorporation was granted to the body on 11 May 1880. Both Harding and the institute's first president, Turquand, actually received the charter. Together with Turquand, Whinney, Arthur Cooper, and Charles Kemp, Harding was delegated to negotiate with the Board of Trade on matters which might affect the accounting profession. Harding succeeded Turquand as the institute's president and served in this role during 1882&#150;3.<br>
<br>In 1883, on retiring from Harding, Whinney &amp; Co. and the ICAEW, where he simultaneously resigned his seat on the council and also his membership, Harding accepted appointment as chief official receiver in the bankruptcy department of the Board of Trade. Appointed because of his &#145;large experience in the administration of estates&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Accountant</span>, 9, 1883, 4), he served in the role of chief official receiver until his retirement in 1890, when he received a knighthood&#151;the first awarded to a professional accountant&#151;in recognition of his contribution to the department.<br>
<br>An obituary in a professional journal described Harding as &#145;a conspicuously able man, although, unlike his talented partner [Frederick Whinney], not showing to great advantage in public. But his powers of organisation and control were superb; but this will be apparent from the long list of large concerns he was engaged in&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Accountant</span>, 19, 1893, 1093). The firm which Harding co-founded became Whinney, Smith and Whinney in 1894.<br>
<br>In 1845 Harding married Marion Martha, the daughter of Joseph Ryle; they had six daughters and two sons. He died of a cranial tumour at 20 Wetherby Gardens, his residence in South Kensington, on 22 December 1893, and was buried on 27 December in Stanstead Old Church, St Margaret's, Hertfordshire, the burial place of his ancestors.<br>
