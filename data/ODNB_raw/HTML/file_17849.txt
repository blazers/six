<span class="headword">Makin <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Reginald]</span>,  Bathsua</span>  (<em>b. </em>1600, <em>d.</em> in or after 1675), <span class="occ">scholar and teacher</span>, was the elder of two daughters of Henry Reginald (<i>d</i>. 1635), a schoolmaster, and his wife, whose name is unknown; her younger sister Ithamaria was baptized at St Dunstan and All Saints, Stepney, in 1601. In 1752, George Ballard apologized for having &#145;been able to learn very little&#146; about &#145;Mrs. Makin (who corresponded in the learned languages with Mrs. Anna Maria &agrave; Schurman)&#146;, not realizing that he had misidentified her as John Pell's sister, rather than sister-in-law. That error confused accounts of her life until the 1960s when Vivian Salmon explained the mistake.<br>
<br>Bathsua Reginald's early years were spent at her father's school in St Mary Axe Street, London. Here she soon acquired a reputation for learning, having, according to Sir Simonds D'Ewes, a fellow pupil, &#145;exact knowledge in the Greek, Latin, and French tongues, with some insight also into the Hebrew and Syriack&#146;. Indeed, claimed D'Ewes,<blockquote>much more learning she had doubtless than her father, who was a mere pretender to it; and by the fame of her abilities, which she had acquired from others, he got many scholars, which else would neither have repaired to him, nor have long staid with him. (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 63)</blockquote>Bathsua was still only sixteen years old when father and daughter collaborated on two publications. In the first, <span class="italic">Ad Annam &hellip; reginam</span> (1616?), Bathsua demonstrated an original shorthand system, radiography, used in recording sermons, in illustrative plates; the surviving sheet from this pamphlet shows her name and the Lord's prayer written out in radiography. A second and far more ambitious project was Henry Reginald's publication of <span class="italic">Musa virginea</span> (1616), a collection of Bathsua's poems and epigraphs praising King James and members of his family in six languages (Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Spanish, French, and German). This evidently elicited an ungenerous joke: &#145;When a learned maid was presented to King James for an English rarity, because she could speake and rite pure Latine, Greeke, and Hebrew, the King ask'd &#147;But can she spin?&#148;&#146;  (J. Collett, &#145;Commonplace book&#146;, <span class="italic">Anecdotes and Traditions</span>, ed. W. Thoms, 1839, 129).<br>
<br>While the king showed little regard for the girl's learning, his physician George Eglisham published in 1619 <span class="italic">Duellum poeticum</span>, a Latin poem that praised &#145;Bathsua Reginalda&#146; as &#145;eruditiones eximiae virgini&#146; (&#145;an exceptionally learned maiden&#146;). Eglisham may have initiated Bathsua's interest in medicine. Certainly she did practise healing: Samuel Hartlib noted in his <span class="italic">Ephemerides</span> (1650) that the London physician Aaron Gourdain had told him that she &#145;cured Mr Holsworth [probably Richard Holdsworth, one of Charles I's chaplains] of the Palpitation of the heart&#146;  (Hartlib, 27/1/48B). According to Hartlib's notes, she was &#145;very well acquainted&#146; with Carew Ralegh, son of Sir Walter, and had obtained from his mother &#145;all Sir W. Ralegh's receipts&#146;&#151;knowledge that Bathsua would have used in her work as a healer.<br>
<br>On 5 March 1622 Bathsua married Richard Makin (1599&#150;1659), who was in the king's service, at St Andrew Undershaft, London. One of the guests was D'Ewes, who described being at &#145;my ould schoolemasters daughters wedding, being the greatest scholler, I thinke, of a woman in England &hellip; [T]here was much companye, whence arose that which is the life of a scholler, good discourse&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 68&#150;9). During the late 1620s and the 1630s, Makin cared for her rapidly growing family. She gave birth to eight children: Anna (1623, <i>d</i>. 1627), Richard (1626, died in infancy), Anna (1628), Bathsua (1629), Mary (1629), Richard (1630), John (1633), and Henry (1642). Before the birth of her last child, however, she returned to the teaching profession that she had learned from her father.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1640 the continental scholar Anna Maria van Schurman wrote two letters in Greek to Makin, and a letter in English to D'Ewes that mentions &#145;the most Learned Matron, Madam Bathsua Mekins&#146;  (Schurman, 126&#150;7) as their mutual friend. In her letters to Makin, van Schurman discusses Makin's appointment as tutor to Charles I's daughter the Princess Elizabeth, whom she instructed in Greek, Latin, Hebrew, French, Italian, Spanish, and mathematics. It is not clear when her duties as royal tutor ended, although it must have been after 1644 when the princess was nine years old, since Makin subsequently wrote about the Princess Elizabeth's skills at that age. Makin would later ask the council of state &#145;for payment of the arrears of 40 &pound; a year granted her for life, for her attendance on the late King's children&#146;, but her petition was dismissed on 16 August 1655  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>).<br>
<br>As an educator Makin was a firm advocate of the methods espoused by Johan Amos Comenius, whom she probably met in 1641 or 1642, when John Pell (who had married her sister Ithamaria in 1632), Samuel Hartlib, and other English intellectuals brought him to London. In addition to the Princess Elizabeth, she also taught Lucy Davies, later Lucy Hastings, countess of Huntingdon, and her children, including Lady Elizabeth Hastings (later Lady Elizabeth Langham) and (for instance, in 1662) Theophilus Hastings, seventh earl of Huntingdon, and later wrote elegies on Lady Elizabeth, who died in 1664, and on Lord Henry Hastings, who died in 1649. Her other pupils may have included the daughters of Nicholas Love, and the Hebraist Elizabeth Fisher (later Elizabeth Bland).<br>
<br>Beyond her tutorial activities, little is known about Bathsua Makin's life during the 1650s and 1660s. In 1652 she wrote a friendly letter to John Pell asking for information about a comet. Two years later he advised her about renting a house while Richard Makin was away. By 1655, however, John Pell complained that his wife Ithamaria was spending too much time with her sister Bathsua, &#145;a woman of great acquaintance and no small impatience. She will not sticke to raile at me and you, where ever she comes&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 4280.238). None the less, Pell's letters a year later make it clear that Ithamaria and Bathsua continued to see one another. In 1659 Richard Makin was buried in St Andrew's, Holborn, while Ithamaria Pell died two years later.<br>
<br>By the 1670s Makin had embarked on two new projects. She joined Mark Lewis, author of a number of textbooks, who ran a private school for boys in Tottenham. With his help, she opened &#145;a school for gentlewomen at Tottenham, High Cross, within four miles of London in the road to Ware&#146;, described in <span class="italic">An Essay to Revive the Antient Education of Gentlewomen</span> (1673). Designed to recruit students and set down her philosophy of education, this essay comprises a lively and amusing defence of women, a catalogue of learned women throughout history, an acerbic attack on the traditional humanist text Lily's <span class="italic">Grammar</span>, and an enthusiastic endorsement of texts by Comenius. It is likely to have influenced Mary Astell and is certainly the first essay by an Englishwoman defending women and their abilities in the classroom.<br>
<br>The last extant letter that Makin wrote was to the physician Baldwin Hamey in November 1675, thanking him for some unspecified favour. The letter shows that her intellect was unimpaired, for she expresses herself in English, Latin, Greek, and a bit of Hebrew. At this date she was living in Long Acre, London; there is no known record of her subsequent life, death, or burial.<br>
