<span class="headword">O'Connor,  Hugh, Don</span>  (1617&#150;1669), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20511/', "Calvach O'Connor Don (1584&#150;1655)")</script> and his wife, Mary, daughter of Sir Theobald Bourke, or Tibbot <i>na long</i> (of the ships). He in turn married Isabella Bourke. The name Don (from <i>donn</i>, &#145;brown&#146;) was used to distinguish this, the senior, branch of the sept from the O'Connor Roe (<i>rua</i>, &#145;red&#146;) branch. At the outbreak of the 1641 rising Calvach assumed leadership of the Catholic insurgents in north Connaught with specific responsibility for co. Roscommon. As early as Christmas eve 1641 Hugh was present at an attack on the abbey of Roscommon as a colonel in the insurgent army, along with other detachments from Leitrim and Longford. According to the historian Edmund Borlase he was captured in January 1642 while besieging Castle Coote, a strong government outpost south of Ballintober on the Galway border. In fact, he was captured there later, in March/April 1642, most likely while making an unsuccessful cattle raid. His capture caused the insurgents to suspend hostilities until July 1642: &#145;[Calvach] O'Conner Dun of Ballintobber, ever since his son was taken, till now had acted nothing, though the tacit votes of the province did seem to own him as their king&#146;  (Borlase, 81). Calvach O'Connor then mustered an army of more than 2000 infantry near Ballintober but the force was routed in a pre-emptive strike by government forces from Athlone.<br>
<br>Hugh O'Connor was imprisoned at Castle Coote before being brought to Dublin in February 1643 for questioning. At his interrogation he justified the rising by the Roscommon gentry on the grounds that it was &#145;the King's pleasure that the said gentry should take up arms for that the Puritan Parliament of England would otherwise destroy them&#146;  (examination of Hugh O'Connor, 1643). He defended himself against accusations of having murdered Hugh Connaghan, a footman of Major Ormsby of Boyle, on the grounds that it was a justifiable act of war because Connaghan was intercepted bringing a message to Castle Coote. He was subsequently released, most likely after the cessation of September 1643. He retained the rank of colonel but did not serve with either of the two Connaught regiments which joined Castlehaven's Ulster expedition of 1644, in the 1645 expedition to recover Sligo, or in the 1646 campaign which finally secured all of co. Roscommon for the confederate Catholics. In July 1652 he was one of the royalist officers who concluded articles of surrender with the Cromwellians. A condition of the articles was that he could recruit his followers for the Spanish service. By June 1653 he had raised 200 soldiers but, while preparing to embark, he was again questioned about the alleged murder of Connaghan. On this occasion he offered the primary defence of alibi rather than justification, claiming that he was absent in Mayo when his father condemned Connaghan to death for, allegedly, having deserted from the insurgent army. He was acquitted and ultimately followed the exiled Charles II to France where he served as a captain in the duke of Gloucester's regiment.<br>
<br>After the Restoration in 1660 he applied for the restoration of his estate of about 6000 acres but died in 1669 before the claim was decided. In 1683 his son Hugh <i>&oacute;g</i> recovered 1100 acres of the original estate. There are faint echoes of the former prominence of the O'Connor Don lineage in popular acclamation of Calvach as &#145;King of Connacht&#146;  (deposition of Elizabeth Holliwell), at the time of the rising. In the event, neither Calvach nor Hugh O'Connor lived up to popular expectations and the &#145;Old English&#146; Bourkes, Dillons, and Taaffes assumed the leadership of the Catholic cause in Connaught.<br>
