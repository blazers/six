<span class="headword">Fisher,  Jonathan</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1809), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was born in Dublin, and was originally a draper in that city. Apparently self-taught, Fisher was first recorded in 1763 when awarded a premium of 10 guineas by the Dublin Society for a landscape. He continued to show works at various Dublin venues until 1801, including the first exhibition of the Society of Artists in 1765. His landscapes, which sought to imitate nature, were too mechanical and cold in colour to be popular. They were, however, very well suited for engraving, and in 1770 he published six large views of Killarney, the first of a number of series of views of Ireland. The first series of six landscapes was published by Fisher from his house in Ship Street, but engraved by various London-based artists. His connections with London remain obscure, though he is believed to have visited the city when young. He also had some contact with the London-based landscape and scene-painter P. J. de Loutherbourg, who painted <span class="italic">Morning</span> and <span class="italic">Evening</span> for Fisher in 1778, and it is evident that he maintained strong business connections there. In 1772 six views of Carlingford were published and finely engraved in London by Thomas Vivares, James Mason, and other eminent landscape engravers of the day. In 1789 Fisher published a folio volume dedicated to his friend and patron John, first earl of Portarlington. The views were engraved in aquatint by Fisher, and the volume expanded and reissued as <span class="italic">A picturesque tour of Killarney, consisting of 20 views engraved in aquatinta, with a map, some general observations, &amp;c</span> in 1790 (Dublin) and 1791 (London). He also published other illustrations of scenery in Ireland, including sixty plates issued first as a series, and then as a single volume in 1796.<br>
<br>Fisher did not find art profitable, and about 1778 was fortunate enough to obtain a situation in the stamp office, Dublin, which he continued to hold until his death in 1809. He married a Miss Price, and for many years shared his house with his pupil and then assistant Henry Graham, who was left &pound;20 a year in Fisher's will (proved 8 December 1809). A sale of Fisher's collection of paintings was held in Bishop Street and included works by de Loutherbourg, Thomas Gainsborough, Richard Wilson, and Angelica Kauffman. There is a landscape by Fisher in the Victoria and Albert Museum, <span class="italic">A View of Lymington River, with the Isle of Wight in the Distance</span>.<br>
