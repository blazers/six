<span class="headword">Villiers <span class="st"> [Danvers]</span>,  John</span>, styled third earl of Buckingham  (<em>c.</em>1677&#150;1723), <span class="occ">peerage claimant</span>, was born about 1677, the only surviving son of Robert Villiers or Danvers, styled third Viscount Purbeck (<i>c</i>.1656&#150;1684), and his wife, Margaret Maccarty (<i>d</i>. 1698), the widow of Charles Maccarty, third Viscount Muskerry, and the daughter of Ulick Bourke, marquess of Clanricarde. His grandfather was the adventurer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7136/', "Robert Danvers")</script>, regarded as the illegitimate son of Frances Coke, the wife of John Villiers, Viscount Purbeck. His father had called himself third Viscount Purbeck, despite the fact that his claim to succeed to that dignity had been disallowed by the House of Lords in 1678 on the grounds of Robert Danvers's illegitimacy. Robert Villiers had left England heavily in debt, and was killed at a duel at Li&egrave;ge in April 1684. His widow subsequently married the notorious rake <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9250/', "Robert Feilding")</script>.<br>
<br>John Villiers, styled fourth Viscount Purbeck from the death of his father, was educated at Eton College, &#145;from whence he entered into the debaucheries of the town, and associated himself with the gamesters of it&#146;  (Sterry, 345). On 16 April 1687, on the death of his grandfather's supposed first cousin George Villiers, second duke of Buckingham, he became (if his grandfather's illegitimacy was set aside) third earl of Buckingham under the terms of a patent issued by James I to the first duke in 1617. On 23 November 1699 he married Frances (<i>d</i>. before 1730), the widow of George Heneage of Lincolnshire and the daughter of a clergyman called Moyser, &#145;a person of a dissolute abandoned character but of a large jointure&#146;  (ibid.). She may have been Frances Moiser, the daughter of George Moiser, baptized at St Michael's, New Malton, Yorkshire, on 23 December 1677. They had two daughters, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1703) and Elizabeth (<i>c</i>.1701&#150;1786), and a son, John, styled Lord Villiers (1707&#150;1710?).<br>
<br>Villiers is first recorded using the title earl of Buckingham in a petition to the House of Lords on 16 May 1702, but he did not make a formal claim to the earldom until April 1709, nor did the Lords then take any notice of his appeal. In 1720 he unsuccessfully petitioned George I for the title. He died at Dancer's Hill, South Mimms, Middlesex, on 10 August 1723, and was buried at South Mimms on 18 August as Lord Buckingham. His claims were adopted by his first cousin George Villiers (1690&#150;1748), vicar of Chalgrove, Oxfordshire, but he did not press them beyond issuing a thin pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Case of George Villiers</span>, in 1723. On the death of this clergyman's son, George, vicar of Frodsham, Cheshire, on 24 June 1774, this claim to the earldom of Buckingham became extinct.<br>
