</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Macartney,  George</span>, Earl Macartney  (1737&#150;1806), <span class="occ">diplomatist and colonial governor</span>, was born in co. Antrim or Dublin on 3 May 1737, the only son of the three children of George Macartney (<i>d</i>. 1779), a landowner, of Lisanoure, co. Antrim, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1755), the youngest daughter of the Revd John Winder, prebend of Kilroot and rector of Carmony, Antrim. His paternal grandfather, another George Macartney, had represented Belfast in the Irish parliament. After attending Dr Thompson's school in Leixlip from 1745, he studied at Trinity College, Dublin, from 1750 to 1754, whence he proceeded MA in 1759. The Revd William Dennis, a friend of Edmund Burke, was also his tutor until 1757, when he entered Lincoln's Inn; he migrated to the Middle Temple the following year. Macartney inherited &pound;150 from his grandfather in 1757 and property from his uncle in 1759. On the grand tour he lingered in Italy in 1760 and wintered in Geneva, where he met Stephen Fox, Lord Holland's heir, with whom he returned to London. He frequented Holland House, his host trusting him to curb Stephen's gambling. From December 1761 he was Stephen's minder in Geneva, and while there he met and became friends with Rousseau and Voltaire. In 1763 he and Stephen were met in Paris by the Hollands, and together they toured France and the Netherlands; Macartney later went on to Germany with Stephen's younger brother Charles James Fox. On their return Lord Holland made him an interest-free loan (unrepaid) and tried unsuccessfully to get him into parliament for Midhurst; however, he did secure him an envoyship-extraordinary to Russia. Macartney was appointed on 4 October 1764, was knighted on 19 October, had his portrait painted by Reynolds, and reached St Petersburg on 27 December.<h2>
<a name="EnvoyinRussia"></a>Envoy in Russia</h2>Commended in London for his good looks, social accomplishments, and ready mind, Macartney was expected to impress the Empress Catherine, but he omitted to produce his credentials on meeting her. He then fell ill, thereby delaying negotiation of a fresh commercial treaty and consideration of any Anglo-Russian alliance proposals. A commercial treaty he signed without authority in August 1765 maintained Britain's preferential status in Russia and permitted merchants to settle anywhere, but it failed to unlock the transit trade with Persia. Macartney received a rebuke from London, and after renegotiation the treaty was concluded in 1766. By then Lord Chatham, who was premier, craved a Russian alliance, which involved the substitution of Hans Stanley for Macartney (whose diplomacy had faltered over the Turkish question). Stanley never went, but Macartney left St Petersburg on 3 April 1767 and returned via Copenhagen in August. He was decorated with the White Eagle of Poland and published privately an <span class="italic">Account of the Russian Empire</span> (1767). On 20 November 1767 he was named ambassador to Russia, but he withdrew, having damaged his prospects by seducing two Russian court ladies. Soon afterwards, on 1 February 1768, he married Lady Jane Stuart (1742&#150;1828), the daughter of the former prime minister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26716/', "John Stuart, third earl of Bute (1713&#150;1792)")</script>, and his wife, Mary Wortley Montagu, Baroness Mount Stuart of Wortley; his mother-in-law vetoed any move to Russia. A mission to Turin was talked of as an alternative posting, as was the secretaryship at war. As Macartney needed to be in parliament, Lord Holland offered him the resources to contest Stockbridge, but he still feared the expense. A bid to win a peerage failed, but Bute secured his return for Cockermouth on Sir James Lowther's interest in 1768. There he was soon pressurized by Lowther to vacate, and he reluctantly accepted the chief secretaryship to Lord Townshend, the Irish viceroy, on 1 January 1769; he gave up Cockermouth in March.<h2>
<a name="ChiefsecretaryinIreland"></a>Chief secretary in Ireland</h2>Macartney owed his appointment to Bute, whose oldest political friend was Townshend. His initial misgivings about his new position grew when Townshend added to his administrative duties the management of the Irish Commons; he had already been voted member for Armagh in absentia in 1768. He was sworn of the Irish privy council on 30 March 1769 and visited Dublin to meet the Dublin Castle undertakers or parliamentary managers, but soon returned to represent Townshend in London. In September, lacking cabinet consent to viceregal reforms, he returned to Dublin. His wish to become ambassador to Spain was frustrated, but Townshend promised recompense. In October he opened proceedings in the Irish Commons, promoting a money bill, which had been rejected in 1768, to augment the military. He was heckled and the bill failed again, so parliament was prorogued. An Irish peerage, as Lord Balmaine, for which Townshend applied in vain, would have released him from his duties. In 1770 he lobbied London for Townshend's scheme to sidestep parliament by raising indirect revenues, but he still hankered after the diplomatic posting to Spain, whereby he hoped to settle the Falklands dispute and to augment his salary of &pound;3000 per annum. When the Irish Commons convened in 1771, Townshend, who despaired of Macartney's management, requested a pension of &pound;2000 for him, but the king disliked creating a precedent. Foregoing an alternative appointment as muster-master-general, he was finally assured his pension and also obtained a second knighthood, this time of the Bath (29 May 1772). Although this honour allowed him to castellate and improve his property at Lisanoure, he stayed on unwillingly, suffering caricature in the Irish patriot publication <span class="italic">Baratariana</span>, until November 1772. He urged in vain that his replacement be spared the vexing duties of parliamentary management. Despite his unhappy experience of Irish politics, his <span class="italic">Account of Ireland in 1773</span> showed his firm grasp of Irish economics and his commitment to imperial government. He continued to sit for Armagh, nominally, until 1776.<br>
<br>Disqualified from membership at Westminster by his pension, Macartney was allowed to substitute the governorship of Toome Castle, which he subsequently sold to pay debts contracted during his time in Russia. Bute secured his return for Ayr burghs in 1774. One speech availed him: he opposed the London merchants' petition against the trade embargo on the American colonies in January 1775. In November he was appointed governor of Grenada, Tobago, and the Grenadines. He vacated his seat in January, and he and Lady Jane reached St George on 3 May 1776. On 19 July he became Baron Macartney in the Irish peerage. Enjoying an income of &pound;6000 a year, he admired the islands' beauty and racial variety but found the principal residents riven by bigotry, and he dissolved the Tobago assembly. While investigating economic problems, he feared French retaliation during the American war and projected a militia. This came too late, as the French invaded Grenada in 1779 and transported him a prisoner to Limoges that July. His wife escaped, but his property was looted. Macartney returned to London in November through an exchange of prisoners of war, and early the following year Lord North sent him on a confidential mission to Dublin; however, his advocacy of Anglo-Irish union fell on deaf ears.<h2>
<a name="GovernorofMadras"></a>Governor of Madras</h2>Macartney next canvassed for the governorship of Madras, then worth &pound;15,000 per annum. Regarded as an interloper in Indian politics, he emphasized his commercial acumen and local impartiality. Backed by Lord Sandwich at the Admiralty, he won over the East India Company directors and court and succeeded in being the first non-company servant to be appointed. He vacated his parliamentary seat of Berealston, for which he had just been elected, on the Northumberland interest and sailed for India on 21 February 1781. He was accompanied by his secretary in Grenada, George Staunton, but not his wife, who suffered increasingly from deafness. His first mission was to seize the Dutch settlements, in order to counter the Franco-Dutch alliance in support of American independence. Negapatam was duly taken on 12 November 1781 and Trincomali in January 1782, despite his quarrel with the commander-in-chief in India, General Sir Eyre Coote, who had defeated Haidar Ali of Mysore, invader of the Carnatic, at the battle of Porto Novo in July 1781. Warren Hastings, governor-general in Calcutta, halted Macartney's initiatives by making Coote military supremo in Madras. To counter the French and Haidar, Macartney needed to finance the East India Company's military forces, and did so by taking over the revenue collection of the debt-ridden nawab of the Carnatic. This policy created a rift with Hastings, who upheld the nawab's objection to Macartney's appointment of revenue collectors, but Hastings gave way, subject to the nawab's approval, on 2 December 1781. Macartney had set up a committee of assigned revenue, headed by Paul Benfield, to whom he owed &pound;6000 for his passage to India, but, alerted to Benfield's graft, he replaced him. When Benfield subsequently intrigued against him, he repaid his personal debt in 1782 and urged the company to boycott him. Meanwhile, the French naval threat having materialized, Macartney commandeered the nawab's revenue. This action was then approved by Hastings, but by May 1783 he had turned against Macartney, who refused to rehabilitate the nawab. In October, having prevented Macartney from negotiating with Haidar, Hastings tried unsuccessfully to suspend him in council. Even when the French made peace in 1783 Hastings continued to veto any negotiation and yielded only when Haidar's heir, Tipu Sultan, made overtures. Tipu renounced all claim to the Carnatic by treaty on 11 March 1784. The nawab's omission from this treaty rankled in Calcutta, but Macartney stuck to his guns, risking suspension from office. The company directors, backed by the newly established government, the Board of Control for India, annulled his revenue takeover on 15 October 1784. Macartney sent his secretary, Staunton, to London to plead his cause, which led to Edmund Burke's exposure in a speech to the Commons on 28 February 1785 of the corruption enmeshing the nawab's affairs. By this point Hastings had resigned as governor-general, and Macartney was chosen as his successor on 17 February 1785. Unaware of his new appointment, Macartney resigned the governorship of Madras on 7 June 1785, <i>en route</i> for Calcutta, where the council, headed by Benfield's crony Sir John Macpherson, rebuffed him. He left India to argue his case in London on 13 August, and reached London in December. Addressing the company on 13 January 1786, he stated his terms and argued that both the military under the commander-in-chief, and the council in Calcutta, should be made subordinate to the governor-general; he also recommended Macpherson's dismissal. He met Pitt and Henry Dundas on 20 January, and their failure to mention a British peerage, while accepting his manifesto, probably clinched matters; he declined the governor-generalship, which was awarded instead to Lord Cornwallis. The company rewarded Macartney for his service with plate worth &pound;1600 and a pension of &pound;1500, commending him for rejecting the customary bribes in India.<br>
<br>Macartney had made several enemies in India and had fought a duel with Anthony Sadleir in September 1784, in which he had been wounded. His dispute with Coote's successor as commander-in-chief in India, Major-General James Stuart, whom he had dismissed in favour of Sir John Burgoyne, was played out in a duel in Hyde Park on 8 June 1786. This time Macartney was seriously wounded, and only the king's intervention in the quarrel prevented another duel between the two men. Disillusioned with India, Macartney withdrew from the political limelight. With his savings of over &pound;30,000 he purchased a house in Curzon Street, Mayfair, and an estate in Surrey at Parkhurst. He also renovated his house at Lisanoure. He took his seat in the Irish Lords on 12 March 1788. Macartney served as <i>custos rotulorum</i> of Antrim, as a trustee of linen manufacture, and as a colonel in the yeomanry in Ulster. He became president of the Literary Club and was elected FRS in 1792 and FSA in 1795.<h2>
<a name="ViscountMacartneyinPeking"></a>Viscount Macartney in Peking</h2>Macartney's next posting was dictated to some extent by his old masters, the East India Company. The company, together with the government, was anxious to ameliorate conditions for trade with China and sent Macartney on an embassy to Peking (Beijing). He was sworn of the privy council on 2 May 1792, awarded a salary of &pound;10,000 and an allowance of &pound;5000, and created Viscount Macartney on 28 June 1792. His party, which numbered ninety-four, including Staunton and a galaxy of experts, embarked in the <i>Lion</i> on 26 September 1792. Samples of the best British manufactures, with mechanical toys to entertain the octogenarian emperor Qianlong, were shipped. After enjoying the customary spectacles enjoined by Chinese hospitality, Macartney was presented to Qianlong at Jehol on 14 September 1793. The event, in which Macartney alone was able to avoid making the ceremonial <i>kowtow</i> to the emperor, was caricatured by Gillray. Thereafter he barely glimpsed the emperor. The premier Heshan refused to negotiate a treaty of trade and friendship, and Macartney was handed his dismissal on 3 October, a week after reaching Peking. His journals, which display ample appreciation of China, were later published in Barrow's life of Macartney (1807); Staunton published an acclaimed account of their mission in 1797. Macartney concluded that China could easily be bombarded, but accepted that the potential for commercial expansion by British traders was thwarted by the Chinese refusal to allow a resident minister in Peking. He returned home via Canton (Guangzhou), where he held talks about improving conditions for the British merchants, but he made no progress on reforming the unsatisfactory system then in operation.<br>
<br>Following his return, Macartney was raised to an earldom in the Irish peerage on 1 March 1794, but he was still ambitious for a British barony. He accordingly undertook another mission, on 10 July 1795, this time to Verona, to the exiled French king, Louis XVIII. Lord Grenville, as foreign secretary, wished to moderate French royalist aspirations. Louis accepted a personal grant of &pound;10,000, but he had already dictated a defiant restoration manifesto and objected to leaving Verona; he wanted British recognition to promote rebellion in France against the revolutionary regime. By February 1796 Macartney had given up; he proceeded to Naples and was received at court. In April he returned to London, where the offer of the post of governor of the Cape awaited him, together with a British barony (granted on 8 June). He took his seat in the Lords on 27 September.<h2>
<a name="GovernoroftheCape"></a>Governor of the Cape</h2>Macartney was enticed to accept the governorship of the Cape with a salary of &pound;10,000 a year, an annual allowance and pension of &pound;2000, and permission to leave peremptorily if his health failed; gout had long plagued him. He was appointed on 30 December 1796 and reached Cape Town on 4 May. In Lady Macartney's absence Lady Anne, the wife of his official secretary, Andrew Barnard, acted as first lady. His brief was to conciliate the Dutch, which he affably attempted, by concession and reform; military intimidation was seldom necessary, and he prevented clashes between the Boers and tribal pastoralists by halting the latter across the Great Fish River. The burghers were made to swear allegiance to George III. John Barrow, one of two private secretaries with him in China, mapped the colony for Macartney, who was confined to his Cape Town residence. He checked a naval mutiny at Simonstown, discouraged the slave trade, on which he had given evidence to the Lords in 1792, and abolished judicial torture. Surveying its resources, he concluded that retention of the Cape was advantageous merely to safeguard India and suggested that the East India Company should manage the colony. He left for England on 21 November 1798, eschewing half pay until he was replaced, after making a declaration of administrative integrity. It was his last office: he declined Addington's offer of the chair of the Board of Control in 1801.<br>
<br>Latterly Macartney seldom attended parliament and instead consolidated his Antrim estate; he established a market town at Dervock. He was a trustee of the British Museum from 1801. After selling his Parkhurst estate in 1799, he rented Corney House in Chiswick. He died at Curzon Street on 31 March 1806 and was buried privately at Chiswick, as he wished, on 9 April. Childless, he left his widow handsomely provided for, and he bequeathed his realty to his niece Mrs Elizabeth Hume, whose heir was to assume the surname Macartney. She erected a cenotaph to his memory in Lisanoure church. His well-stocked library was sold in 1854 together with a first batch of his papers, which, after subsequent sales, have travelled even farther than he.<br>
