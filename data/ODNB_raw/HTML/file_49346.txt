<span class="headword">Carter,  Samuel</span>  (1805&#150;1878), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was born on 15 May 1805 in Coventry, where his father, Samuel Carter, lived and his grandfather was mayor in 1786 and 1799. He was educated in West Bromwich at the school run by his uncle the Revd John Corrie. At the age of sixteen or seventeen he became an articled clerk in the office of another uncle, Josiah Corrie, a leading Birmingham solicitor. The choice of law as a career was not surprising given that another uncle, John Carter, was an attorney and town clerk of Coventry from 1812 to 1836.<br>
<br>On admission, Carter joined Corrie in partnership and commenced practice in Birmingham. Shortly afterwards began his connection with railways. In 1831 Corrie and Carter were appointed solicitors to the newly formed London and Birmingham Railway, which later became the London and North Western Railway Company. When the Birmingham and Derby Railway Company was constituted in 1835, Carter was again appointed solicitor. This company later developed into the Midland Railway. For the next twenty-five years railway work was to dominate Carter's life to the exclusion of other professional and public interests. It was said that in one parliamentary session he had control of forty bills relating to these two companies. Carter developed an unrivalled expertise in parliamentary business and railway policy, being noted in particular for his sound judgement, ability in delicate negotiations, and a combination of shrewdness, intellect, and a strict sense of integrity.<br>
<br>After Corrie's death about 1840, Carter continued to practise in Birmingham until 1850. He then moved to London and carried on the railway work. In 1860 he resigned his position as solicitor to the London and North Western and eight years later he retired from practice, having ended his connection with the Midland. By this time Carter had become a landowner, having purchased an estate at Battle, Sussex, in the late 1850s. This was sold about 1875, though he did retain a small estate in Kenilworth, which had been inherited from his mother's family.<br>
<br>In 1868 Carter returned to Coventry. Up until this time he had shown little interest in public life, but he was persuaded to stand as a Liberal candidate at a by-election in Coventry in March 1868 and was elected. However, it was to be a short parliamentary career; he was defeated at the general election in November 1868. Nevertheless, he had during that time addressed the house on the Irish Church question and the general carriers acts. Carter stood again unsuccessfully at the general election of 1874.<br>
<br>Shortly before his death Carter published two pamphlets on the subject of the jurisdiction of the railway commissioners and the question of debenture holders. Despite his former connection with the industry these pamphlets were not well received by the trade press. Carter's interests were not confined exclusively to his profession and railway business, but also ranged over art, literature, and science. Carter died at his London home, 3 Clifton Place, on 31 January 1878, and was buried in the family vault at Kenilworth. He was survived by his wife, three sons, including the painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32313/', "Hugh Carter")</script>, and one daughter.<br>
