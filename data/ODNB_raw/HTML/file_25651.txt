<span class="headword">Siward</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1048), <span class="occ">bishop and coadjutor-archbishop</span>, was a monk of Glastonbury, and succeeded &AElig;thelwine as abbot of Abingdon, probably in 1030. An extant grant by Cnut may have been solicited by Siward to finance his plan to rebuild St &AElig;thelwold's church at Abingdon. But he abandoned the plan and gave the money to the poor instead, after St &AElig;thelwold had appeared to him in a dream and forbidden the destruction of the church.<br>
<br>Eadsige, the archbishop of Canterbury, finding in 1042 that ill health prevented him from discharging the duties of his office, with the consent of the king and Earl Godwine, consecrated Siward as his suffragan, so that he might act as his coadjutor. Eadsige probably intended that Siward should succeed to the archiepiscopal see: he is described as archbishop of Canterbury in the history of the abbots of Abingdon, and as archbishop in the attestations of three charters, where his name has precedence over that of the archbishop of York. However, in another charter he appears simply as bishop, his name coming after that of the archbishop of York. For six years Siward acted in all things in Eadsige's place. The story that he ill-treated the archbishop and was consequently deprived of the succession may be rejected. He retired on account of ill health in 1048, and was carried back sick to Abingdon. He probably died two months after his return to Abingdon, on 23 October, and was honourably buried there, for he was a munificent benefactor to the monastery, to which he gave Wittenham, near Wallingford, and all the furniture of his chapel. There has been continual confusion between him and the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25653/', "Siward")</script> who held the bishopric of Rochester from 1058 to 1075.<br>
