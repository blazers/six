<span class="headword">Stanley,  Edward</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1792, <em>d.</em> 1862), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, son of Edward Stanley and his wife, Susanna, sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2657/', "Thomas Blizard")</script>, surgeon, was baptized at St Andrews, Holborn, on 5 August 1792; his father was in trade in the City of London. He went to the Merchant Taylors' School (1802&#150;8), and then was apprenticed to Thomas Ramsden and John Abernethy, both surgeons at St Bartholomew's Hospital. Stanley was made MRCS in 1814, and won the Jacksonian prize in 1815.<br>
<br>Stanley was elected assistant surgeon to St Bartholomew's in 1816. With Abernethy's assistance and approval, he enlarged the museum and made the first catalogue of the collection. He was for a time demonstrator in anatomy and later lecturer, in 1826, when he succeeded Abernethy. He was elected surgeon to the hospital in 1838, and rapidly became famous as a clinical teacher. <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> said of him that he &#145;showed the same order and method [in surgery] that he had displayed in his teaching&#146;, that he &#145;was sometimes slow but never unsafe&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lancet</span>, 590).<br>
<br>Stanley worked in London all his life; he lived first in Lincoln's Inn Fields, and then in Brook Street, where he carried on private practice. He had a wife, three daughters, and a son who became a clergyman. He was short (5 feet 2 inches) and timid, a kindly, humane, straightforward, and honest man.<br>
<br>Stanley was elected FRS in 1830. At the Royal College of Surgeons he was a life member of the council from 1832, Arris and Gale professor of human anatomy and physiology in 1835, Hunterian orator in 1839, a member of the court of examiners in 1844, and president in 1848 and 1857. He was president of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society as early as 1843, and he was appointed surgeon-extraordinary to the queen in 1858.<br>
<br>Stanley had a &#145;gift for accurate clinical description&#146;  (Kelly, 271). He wrote <span class="italic">A Manual of Practical Anatomy</span> (1818), and <span class="italic">A Treatise on Diseases of the Bones</span> (1849). Another major contribution was &#145;On dislocations, especially of the hip joint&#146;, published in <span class="italic">Medico-Chirurgical Transactions</span> in 1841, which accurately described locomotor ataxy.<br>
<br>Stanley retired from his hospital appointment in 1861, but he regularly attended the weekly operations on Saturdays until 24 May 1862, when he suffered a cerebral haemorrhage after watching an operation; he died at the hospital within the hour. He was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
