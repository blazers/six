<span class="headword">Sedgwick,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1609, <em>d.</em> 1663/4), <span class="occ">religious and political controversialist</span>, was baptized at Woburn, Bedfordshire, on 17 August 1609, the son of William Sedgwick (<i>d</i>. 1632), gentleman, of London, and his wife, Elizabeth Howe. His brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25017/', "Robert Sedgwick (bap. 1613, d. 1656)")</script>, merchant and army officer.<br>
<br>Sedgwick entered Pembroke College, Oxford, in 1624 and studied under George Hughes, who instructed Sedgwick in the tenets of Calvinism. He matriculated on 2 December 1625, graduated BA on 21 June 1628, and proceeded MA on 4 May 1631. In 1635 he was incorporated at Cambridge. Sedgwick was married, but his wife's name and the date of their marriage are unknown. They appear to have had several children, of whom only three, William, Susan, and Mary, were listed in his will.<br>
<br>Sedgwick was rector of Farnham, Essex, from 5 February 1635 until 1643. He deplored the advance of Laudian innovation: &#145;idolatrous, superstitious Arminians carry the ball before them, they have prevailed lamentably these 7 yeares&#146;  (Webster, 262). Along with his old tutor Hughes, he promoted puritan ideals and sought spiritual solace in the mid-1630s by leading and participating in weekly fasts with fellow Essex godly ministers such as Thomas Parker, Samuel Rogers, and Nicholas and Thomas Noyes. Sedgwick's willingness to promote worthy religious causes brought him to the attention of John Durie, who was seeking assistance in his plan to effect a theological common ground between Lutherans and Calvinists.<br>
<br>On 29 June 1642 Sedgwick preached a fast sermon at St Margaret's, Westminster. Entitled <span class="italic">Zions Deliverance, her Friends Duty</span> (1642), this sermon established his pattern of using allegorical interpretations of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> to explain England's problems. In this respect, Sedgwick was not unlike parliament's more prominent ministers Stephen Marshall and Cornelius Burges; indeed, in reading Hebrew history as an analogue to the English protestant experience he was drawing on a theme commonplace since at least the Geneva <span class="roman">Bible</span>. Defining Jerusalem as the church of the Gentiles, he compared the impending war to Israel's deliverance from Egypt. As in ancient Israel during the rebuilding of the Temple, the king had been seduced by &#145;evill counsell&#146; and the &#145;Reformation counted Rebellion&#146;, but parliament should not be afraid to rise up because &#145;God hath no more than he gets by conquest&#146;  (Sedgwick, <span class="italic">Zions Deliverance</span>, 7). The Lord would assist in accomplishing the Reformation, but the saints must help by employing qualified servants who valued public service above personal interest. Sedgwick preached another fast sermon in 1643, <span class="italic">Scripture a Perfect Rule for Church Government</span> (December 1643), which supported the effort to establish a presbyterian polity in the church.<br>
<br>Around March 1643 Sedgwick placed a curate in charge of the church at Farnham and served as an army chaplain in the regiment of Sir William Constable until May of that year. From July to December 1644 he was the chaplain at Wisbech garrison, Cambridgeshire, and he may have acted as a courier for Colonel Thomas Ayloffe. Sedgwick was the minister for the cathedral church of Ely from 1645 to 1649, a position to which he was appointed by Edward Montagu, earl of Manchester. His evangelical work there gained him the title the Apostle of the Isle of Ely, and impressed Cromwell, who wrote to the isle's sequestrators that Sedgwick &#145;fully deserve[d]&#146; the pay owed him despite the committee's financial difficulties  (Abbott, 1.325).<br>
<br>The question of Sedgwick's sanity has been raised by contemporaries and historians alike. Reports vary as to whether he earned the nickname Doomsday Sedgwick after telling some gentlemen at Sir Francis Russell's house in Cambridge that the world would end in one week, or after prophesying in London that the world would end in fourteen days. The story of his London prophecies appeared in a newsletter dated 30 March 1647, which recorded that some ministers were sent to examine him. Sedgwick met with the preachers but refused to discuss his statements, and the paper's report that some thought he was &#145;distempered in minde&#146;, while others observed that &#145;he talks very sencibly&#146;, summarizes the confusing impression one gets when reading Sedgwick's pamphlets  (<span class="italic">Clarke Papers</span>, 1.4).<br>
<br>Wood wrote that Sedgwick &#145;was a conceited whimsical person&#146;, but he displayed a keen sense of objectivity in faulting parliament and the king for the outbreak of the war, and in pointing out the army's errors in 1647 and 1648  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.335). The equitable distribution of blame appears in most of his pamphlets from 1647 onwards, beginning with <span class="italic">The Leaves of the Tree of Life</span> (August 1648). In this tract Sedgwick displayed an ardent nationalism. He acknowledged that the English had human faults, but described them as &#145;indeed a Race and seed of heavenly Lords&#146;, who had created a government that represented &#145;the highest and perfectest glory of God&#146;  (Sedgwick, <span class="italic">Leaves of the Tree of Life</span>, 3). He urged the powerful interests in the country to include the king in the peace settlement, and condemned the <span class="italic">Agreement of the People</span> as a &#145;covenant with hell&#146;  (ibid., 46). Contemporaries disagree as to whether Sedgwick showed this pamphlet to Charles at the Isle of Wight in 1647 or 1648, but according to Wood the king read only part of it before remarking that the author &#145;stands in some need of sleep&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.336). This treatise and Sedgwick's subsequent pamphlets demonstrate fervid spiritual feeling, but they do not exhibit the disorganization or pathos evident in Lady Eleanor Douglass's writings.<br>
<br>In late 1648 Sedgwick engaged in a polemical debate, during which he lambasted the army for bringing the king to judgment, and charged that the officers were politicians bent on forwarding their own interests. Recognizing his own notoriety, there was undoubtedly a hint of sarcasm in the title of <span class="italic">The Spiritual Madman</span> (20 December 1648), which began by arguing that England was under a military dictatorship, but deteriorated into a confused diatribe in which Sedgwick displayed sympathy for the Levellers' demand for an extended franchise, but advocated restoring the king and establishing some sort of mystical commonwealth wherein property would be shared by all. Support for the king led to accusations that Sedgwick was a royalist, and he refrained from publishing between 1648 and 1656 to disprove the charge. He maintained a lifelong friendship with Joshua Sprigge despite differences with the army, which Sedgwick blamed for the king's execution.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">Some Flashes of Lightnings of the Sonne of Man</span> (1648) Sedgwick foretold the coming of the kingdom of God, but explained that it was within individuals. This pamphlet demonstrated more spiritual emotion than his preceding tracts, and it perhaps explains his later sympathy with Quakers and Muggletonians. He corresponded with John Reeve from 1652 to 1657 and visited James Nayler in prison in 1656. Sedgwick's name also arose during the committee debates to determine whether Nayler was guilty of blasphemy: Major-General Whalley clearly believed that Sedgwick and Nayler were both suffering from a similar insanity. He recalled an encounter with Sedgwick in which the minister's &#145;frenzy&#146; caused him to claim that he was God and &#145;divers horrid things&#146;; later Sedgwick had conceded that he was &#145;but a man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Thomas Burton</span>, 1.103&#150;4).<br>
<br>With one exception, Sedgwick refrained from political discourse during the protectorate (1654&#150;60). In <span class="italic">Animadversions upon a Letter</span> (January 1656), he castigated Vavasor Powell and the Welsh signatories of <span class="italic">A Word for God</span> (December 1655) for threatening the peace of the kingdom. Retaining his old even-handedness, he elucidated the strengths and weaknesses of the treatise and of the current government, but reminded the Welshmen that Cromwell was &#145;a great Man&#146;, who had been &#145;a main pillar of &hellip; strength&#146; in all the upheavals since 1642  (Sedgwick, <span class="italic">Animadversions upon a Letter</span>, 20). Sedgwick also accepted the Restoration, and his support of Charles I in 1648 may partially explain why he was not ejected after 1660.<br>
<br>In 1661 Sedgwick set out his reflections on the preceding years of upheaval in <span class="italic">Animadversions upon a Book entitled Inquisition for the Blood of our Late Sovereign</span>, which elucidates and expounds a work he had published the year before. Stung by criticisms from both royalists and parliamentarians, Sedgwick admitted that he had been &#145;foolish&#146; for anonymously publishing his earlier tract, but had decided at that time to &#145;own it&#146; if it became controversial  (Sedgwick, 1, 2). Consistent with his earlier pamphlets that blamed both sides for the war, Sedgwick indicted the army for executing the king, and commended the protectorate as the only stable Commonwealth government, although it was no more than the &#145;dressed up &hellip; carkase of King, Lords and Commons&#146;  (ibid., 61). He condemned the &#145;Saints&#146; (the army) as a &#145;confused heap&#146; who mistakenly associated the Good Old Cause with God's cause based on a partial and misunderstood reading of <span class="roman">Revelation</span>; God's cause, he scolded, did not include continuous warfare and political strife  (ibid., 84, 108). Vilified by royalists and parliamentarians as a &#145;Fanatick&#146; and &#145;Courtier&#146;, Sedgwick's claim that he had always acted as a mediator (but neither side would compromise, especially on the issue of religion) is perhaps true in light of the recommendation of him to Durie as a suitable collaborator in the 1630s. Believing that good existed in all people and all things, Sedgwick was optimistic that the restoration of Charles II and the monarchy were positive events, and that the former enemies should work towards accommodation.<br>
<br>Following the Restoration, Sedgwick may have held a living in Lewisham, Kent, where he died between the end of November 1663 and late February 1664. Anthony Wood reported that a &#145;Dr. S. C.&#146; of Gr[eenwich?], Kent, had reneged on his promise to furnish an account of Sedgwick's death  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.336). Sedgwick's will, dated 28 November 1663, indicates that he owned property at Great and Little Sampford, Essex. It also records the names of four sons-in-law, Nicholas Ashton, Timothy van Vleteren, Nathaniel James, and Francis Commins, of whom nothing further is known.<br>
