<span class="headword">Booth,  George</span>, second earl of Warrington  (1675&#150;1758), <span class="occ">writer on divorce</span>, second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2880/', "Henry Booth, first earl of Warrington (1652&#150;1694)")</script>, and his wife, Mary (1652&#150;1691), daughter of Sir James Langham of Cottesbrooke, Northamptonshire, was born on 2 May 1675 at Merehall, Cheshire. His elder brother having died young, George inherited the family estates centred on Dunham Massey, Cheshire, on his father's death in 1694. He found the estate heavily in debt and in bad repair. Warrington attributed this to his family's support for the protestant cause, and the generous portions allotted in his father's will to his sisters and younger brothers. The strain of these bequests on the estate finances led Warrington to try to suppress the will, but his siblings challenged him in the House of Lords and a trust was set up to pay the portions. The situation was compounded because his mother's marriage portion of &pound;20,000 was never paid in full. In 1698 after his mother's death he brought a chancery suit for the recovery of the rest of his mother's portion against his grandfather. Although an out-of-court settlement was agreed the sum was never paid in full.<br>
<br>Warrington's aim on inheriting the estate was to clear it of debt. He could do this by borrowing money, selling land, or making a good marriage. Indebtedness was against his principles so part of the estate was sold and a search started for a rich bride. His name was linked with a Welsh heiress possessing &pound;4000 per annum, and with Madam Offley, the daughter of Lord Crew, but in 1701 his uncle George Booth negotiated a marriage settlement between Warrington and Mary Oldbury (<i>d</i>. 1740) the eldest daughter of John Oldbury, a London merchant. Her fortune was rumoured to be &pound;40,000 but was in reality &pound;24,000. They married in 1702.<br>
<br>The marriage was not felicitous. Warrington accused his wife of financial profligacy, and contemporaries noted their incompatibility. After the birth of their only child, Mary (1704&#150;1772), the couple lived in the same house but apart, and in 1739 Warrington published an anonymous pamphlet, <span class="italic">Considerations upon the Institution of Marriage</span>. The pamphlet advocated allowing divorce on the ground of incompatibility of temper. The obligations of a marriage contract in a landed family included the assurance that in the event of a wife's outliving her husband, her widow's jointure would be the first call on the estate. This particularly exercised Warrington although it did not happen in his case; his wife died the following year. Through Warrington's efforts the estate was put back on to a sound financial footing, and the family home at Dunham Massey was remodelled in the 1730s. Another pamphlet by Warrington, &#145;Letter to the writer of the &#147;Present state of the republic of letters&#148;&#146;, vindicated his father against reflections against him in Burnet's <span class="italic">History of our Time</span>, claiming that his debts were due to his imprisonment for high treason after the Monmouth rebellion. Although a conscientious whig, Warrington was not above taking a bribe from the tory earl of Oxford to vote in favour of the <span class="roman">Malt Tax Bill</span> in 1713. His growing cynicism with politics led to his withdrawal from political life, and the demise of the whig influence in Cheshire.<br>
<br>Warrington died at Dunham Massey on 2 August 1758 and was buried at Bowdon, Cheshire. His daughter married Henry Grey, fourth earl of Stamford, and the Dunham Massey estate passed to the Grey family.<br>
