<span class="headword">York, Sir  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1569), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was the third son of John York and his wife, Katherine Patterdale. His family owed its rise to his great-grandfather <a name="cosubject_30235"></a><span class="headword">Sir Richard York</span>  (1430&#150;1498), <span class="occ">administrator</span>. Richard York became a freeman of York by purchase in 1456 and steadily worked his way into positions of increasing status and importance in the city. He was chamberlain from 1459 to 1460, sheriff from 1465 to 1466, and entered the Corpus Christi Guild in 1469. Having been installed as mayor of the staple of Calais in 1467, he was mayor of York from 1469 to 1470 and again from 1482 to 1483. In 1475 he was master of the Merchants' Guild and was made alderman of the city some time before 1487. He survived the accession of Henry VII and was knighted by the king at York in July 1487, after the victory at the battle of Stoke on 16 June, and granted a &pound;20 annuity the following November. York acted as ambassador in France in 1486 and again in 1491. He was returned for the city of York to the parliaments of 1472&#150;5, January 1483, October 1483, 1484, 1485&#150;6, and 1489&#150;90. On 2 January 1487 he treated with the embassy from Maximilian I and went with the embassy to the Hanse on 20 April 1491. <br>
<br>Richard York's first wife was probably Jane, daughter of Richard Mauleverer of Allerton, Lancashire. They had at least seven sons, including Richard (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1508), Christopher, and Thomas, and four daughters. York's second wife, Joan (<i>d</i>. in or after 1498), was the widow of both John Dalton and John Whitfield (<i>d</i>. 1479). The couple's sons included Adam, William, and John. Sir Richard York died on 25 November 1498. His will is dated 8 April 1498, and was proved on 17 July 1499. He asked to be buried at St John the Evangelist in Ousebridge, Yorkshire. He left all his tenements in Hull to his wife. His will mentions two illegitimate sons, George and Giles York. York's executors were William Senhouse, bishop of Carlisle, Sir Reynold Bray, and his sons, Dr Christopher York, Richard, and William York. His son and heir, Sir Richard York the younger, probably died in 1508 and was buried in St John's Michaelgate in York. The glass in the east window of this building displays a kneeling effigy of Sir Richard York the younger in his surcoat and spurs. He founded a chantry there and was married twice. <h2>
<a name="SirJohnYorksearlycareer15351550"></a>Sir John York's early career, 1535&#150;1550</h2>John York's education and early life remain obscure. His family were merchants of the staple in York and also became involved with trading in London and Calais. It is hardly surprising therefore that he is first documented upon his arrival at Calais from Antwerp on 3 September 1535. By about 1542 he had married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1575), daughter of Robert Smyth of London. They had eleven sons, including Peter York (<i>c</i>.1542&#150;1589), of Gouthwaite in Yorkshire, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30236/', "Rowland Yorke (d. 1588)")</script>, soldier and traitor. In 1544 York was appointed assay master to the first mint in the Tower of London. The following year he was transferred to Southwark, Surrey, as under-treasurer of the mint there, recently established in Henry VIII's newly acquired property Suffolk Place. He was added to the commission of the peace for Middlesex on 26 May 1547 and appointed master of the king's woods in the southern parts by August, although he did not start felling trees until autumn 1549. <br>
<br>The patronage of John Dudley, Viscount Lisle, was certainly a factor in York's placement at the mint. Lisle and York had long shared a mutual interest in lands belonging to the former abbeys of Byland and Fountains in Yorkshire. This close association stood Lisle in good stead. During his dispute with the lord protector, Edward Seymour, duke of Somerset, Lisle (now earl of Warwick) took up residence at York's house in the parish of St Stephen Walbrook, London, from 6 October 1549. York's motivation for supporting Warwick is difficult to determine but was probably based on his position as a Dudley client and on apathy towards the lord protector's social policies. On 18 January 1550 Warwick himself transferred from his own house at Ely Place to<blockquote>the house of a certain sheriff [York], a personage who ranks first in the city of London after the Lord Mayor [Sir Henry Amcotes]. He lodged with the same sheriff after he conducted the intrigue against the Protector, and no doubt his purpose was the same then as now, to have the city on his side. (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1550&#150;52</i>, 13)</blockquote>York was sheriff of London and Middlesex from 1549 to 1550, during which time his influence was considered essential to winning the support of the mayor and common council of London. On 9 October 1549 the London council or confederate lords, led by Warwick, met and dined at Walbrook, where they discussed the actions taken by Somerset to secure several of Edward VI's armouries, as well as rumours that the lord protector planned to &#145;convey the king out of Windsor and the realm&#146;  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, <i>1547&#150;50</i>, 337). According to Alan Bryson, &#145;York's role at this juncture was vital; it was he, not Sir Richard Rich, Lord Rich (as the chronicler Charles Wriothesley believed), who &#147;opened&#148; the request from the London council to the common council for one thousand men&#146;  (Bryson, 143). These soldiers were necessary &#145;for the accomplyshment of their enterprice for the spedye savegarde &amp; conveying of the kinges maiestie out of the handes of the late protector&#146;  (CLRO, Repertory 12 (1), fol. 151<i>v</i>). On 9 October the common council agreed reluctantly to provide the men. York and other city officials treated the London council as if it were the privy council. That the London councillors met in his home and that he acted as &#145;chief intermediary&#146; between them and the common council, meant that York became a permanent and prominent client of Warwick's  (Bryson, 149). <br>
<br>York benefited from the king's gratitude. As a reward for his hospitality and loyalty, Edward dined with him at his official residence in Southwark on 17 October and thereupon knighted him. Immediately after his release from the Tower on 6 February 1550 Somerset dined at Walbrook, where Warwick was still in residence, &#145;without great guard or business&#146; and was then &#145;enlarged &hellip; in sort as doth appear by his recognisance&#146;  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, <i>1547&#150;50</i>, 383&#150;4). The privy council continued to conduct its business from York's house until 8 February. <h2>
<a name="Currencyspeculationandrestorationofthecoinage15501553"></a>Currency speculation and restoration of the coinage, 1550&#150;1553</h2>The crown's desire to pay off its foreign debt and the resulting debasements of the coinage meant that York had become indispensable as a mint official by 1550. When Sir Martin Bowes was pensioned off from the Tower mint in 1550, York supervised operations there while remaining under-treasurer of the Southwark mint. When the Southwark mint was closed in September 1551, he was appointed under-treasurer of the Tower mint. Despite the end of the war with the French in March 1550 and the mint's efforts to produce very large amounts of coinage, the king's debts continued to mount at an alarming rate. The privy council turned to York to solve the problem. He devised a plan to make a large profit on the Antwerp exchange as well as to bring home quality bullion from abroad for the production of new, finer English coin. The details of the scheme remain obscure, but it is known that in December 1550 York went to Antwerp to speculate with the king's money. Edward noted in his <span class="italic">Chronicle</span> that:<blockquote>It was agreed that [Sir John York] master of one of the mints at the Tower, should make this bargain with me, viz. to make the profit of silver rising of the bullion that he himself bought, pay all my debts, to the sum of &pound;120,000 or above, and remain accountable for the overplus &hellip; to which I should give him &pound;15,000 in prest-money and leave to carry &pound;8,000 overseas to abase the exchange. (<span class="italic">Chronicle</span>, ed. Jordan, 48)</blockquote>York insisted he could double the money in value each month, but by March 1551 he had suffered losses of at least &pound;4000 of silver bullion. Edward blamed the loss on the treason of certain Englishmen who may have betrayed York's plans to the imperial government. The king hoped to recover the lost sums, but the incident proved too embarrassing, as York and his men were caught red-handed trying to smuggle &pound;4000 in bullion out of Antwerp, for which they were &#145;sorely frightened and distressed &hellip; but have small sympathy from the people who say Mr York deserves it&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1550&#150;52</i>, 264). <br>
<br>Despite this set-back, the scheme did not fail entirely, and during his time at the mints York brought in large amounts of bullion on which he made a handsome personal profit. In 1551 Sir Nicholas Throckmorton and he were charged with the task of restoring the coinage, and many of the coins issued were stamped with Y, one of York's mint marks. On 21 June 1552 York was pardoned &#145;for all treasons and offences concerning making and issuing of the king's money&#146;, on the condition that he settle his mint accounts for over &pound;9500 &#145;due to the king&#146;  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1551&#150;3</i>, 301). York's fortunes were made through his service in the mint, for he was able to claim a remarkably high rate of remuneration for the bullion he supplied. He was considered valuable enough for Somerset to use him as one of his own financial officers and York disbursed &pound;2500 of the duke's money by October 1551. York's principal allegiance, however, remained with Warwick (now duke of Northumberland). This close relationship became a political liability. Already in 1550 Henry Fitzalan, twelfth earl of Arundel, and Anne Seymour, duchess of Somerset, planned to take York prisoner in order to determine whether there had been any embezzlement of royal funds. When Edward died on 6 June 1553, York firmly supported Lady Jane Grey against Princess Mary, with near calamitous results. According to one witness, York was on Leadenhead Street when the proclamation of Mary's accession was read out on 19 July and &#145;people started running in all directions and crying out&#146;. York,<blockquote>hearing this tumult, thought it had another cause. He therefore cried out to the people that it was not true, and though he was on horse-back he escaped alive with difficulty and was taken into the house of Sheriff Garrett [William Garrard], where he was examined.</blockquote>The witness reported that so many people gathered outside the sheriff's house clamouring for York, that &#145;he may come to a bad end&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1553</i>, 108). York retreated safely to Walbrook, where his friend the lord mayor George Barne arrested him, on 23 July. On 31 July York joined Northumberland in the Tower, his property having been ordered to be inventoried and sequestrated. <span class="italic">The Chronicle of Queen Jane</span> reports that he was freed on 18 October. He had certainly been released by November, when he attended a sermon at St Stephen Walbrook, given by Dr John Feckenham, Mary I's private chaplain and confessor. <h2>
<a name="Finalyears15531569"></a>Final years, 1553&#150;1569</h2>During Mary's reign York conformed outwardly, but focused his energies on trading activities with Germany and the Low Countries, and his investments in Western exploration. In 1555 he was one of the twenty-four assistants of the Company of Merchant Adventurers. When Elizabeth I came to the throne he tried several means of re-entering royal service. Presumably nominated by Sir Ambrose Cave, York was returned as MP for Boroughbridge, Yorkshire, in 1559. He wrote to Sir William Cecil, principal secretary, in October 1560, asking to be restored to his office as under-treasurer, but the post was given to a former comptroller at Southwark, Thomas Fleetwood. York had made an enemy of Sir Thomas Gresham, who had been trying to monopolize the English trade in gunpowder and saltpetre in Antwerp. During Elizabeth's reign Cecil preferred to rely upon Gresham's advice about the coinage, rather than York's. Little else is known of York's last years. As a freeman of the Merchant Taylors' Company he contributed a small sum to the building of the Royal Exchange in January 1566. He may have spent the last years of his life caring for his properties in Yorkshire and Kent and enjoying his large family. <br>
<br>Six of York's sons were still alive when he wrote his will on 6 April 1562: Peter, William, Edmund, Rowland, Edward, and Henry York. His eldest daughter, Anne, married Sir William Hilton, one of the supervisors of his will. Another daughter, Jane, was unmarried at the making of his will and he left her &pound;666 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. towards her marriage portion, to be taken from his goods and his &#145;second cross of diamond&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/51, sig. 4). York's widow, Anne, whom he appointed his sole executor, may have married Robert Paget of London, either before her marriage to York or after York's death, though there is no reference to Paget in her will (dated 9 August 1575), in which she describes herself as a widow. Peter York received the lion's share of the family estates, principally those concentrated in Craven and Nidderdale, Yorkshire. Sir John York's second surviving son, William York, received the manor of Pedderthrope in Yorkshire. The third son, Sir Edmund York, was granted the manor of Steddmeere, Yorkshire. Rowland and Edward York were to share the manor of Rudson or Rudston, Yorkshire, as well as many of their father's household goods and possessions. When Sir John York died in London in January or February 1569, he was a wealthy man as a result of his own expertise in financial matters. He was buried in St Stephen Walbrook. His widow was buried in the same chuch on 21 August 1575.<br>
