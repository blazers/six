<span class="headword">Paget, Lord  George Augustus Frederick</span>  (1818&#150;1880), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, sixth son (third of the second marriage) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21112/', "Henry William Paget, first marquess of Anglesey (1768&#150;1854)")</script>, and his second wife, Charlotte (1781&#150;1853), daughter of the first Earl Cadogan, was born at Burlington Street, London, on 16 March 1818. He was educated at Westminster School (1829) and on 25 July 1834 was appointed cornet and sub-lieutenant in the 1st lifeguards, in which he became lieutenant on 1 December 1837. On 17 August 1840 he purchased an unattached company and exchanged to a troop in the 4th light dragoons (later hussars); he was promoted major on 30 January 1846 and lieutenant-colonel on 29 December the same year. After becoming a brevet colonel on 20 June 1854, he went out in command of the 4th light dragoons to the East, landed with them in the Crimea, and at the Alma and Balaklava was next senior officer of the light cavalry brigade to Lord Cardigan. He was privately critical of both Cardigan and Lucan, &#145;two spoilt children&#146;  (Hibbert, 158), and of Nolan. In the famous charge of the light brigade Paget's regiment at first formed the third line, and he appears to have done his utmost to fulfil Lord Cardigan's desire that he should give him &#145;his best support&#146;. With the remnants of his own regiment and the 11th hussars (from the second line of the brigade), which he held together after the first line had disintegrated at the guns, he was enabled to check the Russian pursuit, and was one of the last to leave the &#145;Valley of Death&#146;. He commanded the remains of the light brigade at Inkerman, and immediately afterwards he went home with a view to retirement from the service, an arrangement he had contemplated at the time of his marriage before the outbreak of the war. Although his bravery was not questioned, his return at this critical period exposed him to much press criticism, and he was reportedly &#145;greatly snubbed at home&#146;  (Hibbert, 236), which probably induced him to reconsider.<br>
<br>Paget went back to the Crimea on 23 February 1855 accompanied by his wife&#151;whom Roger Fenton called &#145;the belle of the Crimea&#146;  (Hibbert, 329); he was reappointed to the command of the light brigade, and was in temporary command of the cavalry division during the absence of Sir James Yorke Scarlett, Lord Lucan's successor. Together with his wife, Paget was one of the small group of personal friends who gathered round Raglan's deathbed. Paget commanded the light cavalry brigade at Eupatoria and in the operations under General d'Allonville, and until a month before the evacuation of the Crimea; he received the CB (July 1855), L&eacute;gion d'honneur, Mejidiye (third class), and Sardinian and Turkish medals. He became major-general on 11 November 1861, commanded the cavalry at Aldershot in 1860&#150;62 and the Sirhind division of the Bengal army from 1862 to 1865, when he came home, and was appointed inspector-general of cavalry. He was made lieutenant-general and KCB in June 1871 and general in 1877; he was appointed colonel 7th dragoon guards in 1868, and succeeded Lord de Ros as colonel of the 4th hussars in 1874. Paget was whig MP for Beaumaris from 1847 to 1857, voting for the ballot in 1853.<br>
<br>Paget married, first, on 27 February 1854, shortly before he left for the war, his beautiful young cousin Agnes Charlotte, youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21101/', "Sir Arthur Paget")</script>; she died on 10 March 1858, leaving two children. He married on 6 February 1861 Louisa, youngest daughter of Charles Fieschi Heneage and granddaughter on her mother's side of Thomas North, second Lord Graves; she survived Paget, married Arthur Algernon Capell, sixth earl of Essex, in 1881, and died on 25 January 1914.<br>
<br>Paget in May 1852 addressed a letter to Lord John Russell on the establishment of an army reserve, which was printed for private circulation. He proposed that, instead of the revival of the militia, a bill for which was before the house, a reserve force should be established by compelling all soldiers who left the service at the end of ten years, under the act of 1847, without re-engaging, to serve five years after discharge in a reserve, which was to undergo six days' local military training in each year. Paget's Crimean journals were printed for private circulation in 1875; but after the publication of A. W. Kinglake's <span class="italic">The Invasion of the Crimea</span> he appears to have revised them, and, in accordance with a wish expressed in a memorandum found among his papers, they were published by his son in 1881. Paget died very unexpectedly at his residence, 1 Farm Street, Mayfair, London, on 30 June 1880.<br>
