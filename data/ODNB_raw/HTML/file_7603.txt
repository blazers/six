<span class="headword">Dickinson,  Charles</span>  (1792&#150;1842), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland clergyman</span>, was born in Cork in August 1792, the youngest son of sixteen children of Charles Dickinson, an Englishman originally from Cumberland, and his wife, whose maiden name was Austen, of an old Cork family. He was a precocious child, and his aptitude for mathematics was already apparent when he was only five or six years old. He entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1810, under the tutorship of the Revd Dr Meredith. He was elected a scholar in 1813 and took a leading part in the College Historical Society. He graduated BA in 1815, and was awarded the gold medal for distinguished answering at every examination during his undergraduate course. He became MA in 1820, and BD and DD in 1834. In 1817 he stood for a fellowship but was unsuccessful; as he became engaged to be married shortly afterwards and celibacy was a condition of fellowships, he did not compete again.<br>
<br>In 1818 Dickinson entered holy orders, and became curate of Castleknock, near Dublin. In 1819 he was appointed assistant chaplain of the Magdalen Asylum, Dublin. In April 1820 he married Elizabeth, the daughter of Abraham Russell of Limerick, and sister of his friend and classmate, the late Archdeacon Russell. They had four daughters and at least three sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32817/', "Hercules Henry Dickinson (1827&#150;1905)")</script>. In the same year he became chaplain of the Magdalen Asylum, but resigned from the post after only a few months. In 1822 he accepted the offer of the chaplaincy of the Female Orphan House, Dublin. In 1832, while he still held this chaplaincy, he was singled out by Richard Whately, the archbishop of Dublin, and was soon appointed one of the archbishop's chaplains, as assistant to Samuel Hinds. In early 1833, on Hinds's retirement, Dickinson became the archbishop's domestic chaplain and secretary. In July 1833 the archbishop collated him to the vicarage of St Anne's, Dublin, which he held with the chaplaincy. He remained a close associate of Whately's until 1840, when he was promoted to the bishopric of Meath. After being consecrated bishop on 27 December in Christ Church, Dublin, he began work but soon fell ill of typhus fever. He died at the palace, Ardbraccan, co. Meath, on 12 July 1842 and was buried in Ardbraccan churchyard on 16 July. An inscription was left to his memory at St Anne's Church, Dublin, and his son-in-law John West published a memoir of his life, <span class="italic">Remains of Bishop Dickinson, with a Biographical Sketch</span> (1845), which includes selections from his sermons and tracts, several of which were also published independently.<br>
