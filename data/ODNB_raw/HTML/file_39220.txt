<span class="headword">Eadgifu</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 951), <span class="occ">queen of the West Franks, consort of Charles III</span>, was born in Wessex, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8514/', "Edward the Elder, king of the Anglo-Saxons (d. 924)")</script>, and his second wife, &AElig;lffl&aelig;d, and thus half-sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/833/', "&#198;thelstan, king of England")</script> (<i>r</i>. 924&#150;39). Between 917 and 919 Eadgifu married King Charles III (879&#150;929), nicknamed Simplex (&#145;the Straightforward&#146;, commonly but misleadingly translated as &#145;the Simple&#146;) of the West Franks, after the death of his first wife, with whom he had six daughters. Some time between late April and September 921, Eadgifu gave birth to a son, Louis (IV), later king of West Francia from 936 to 954 and nicknamed Transmarinus (&#145;From-over-the-Sea&#146;, &#145;d'Outremer&#146;). Widowed in 929, in 951 she married Count Heribert of Soissons, lay abbot of St M&eacute;dard, Soissons. She died in Soissons on 26 December in an unknown year.<br>
<br>Eadgifu's career, barely mentioned in Anglo-Saxon sources, is relatively well documented in West Frankish ones. King Charles dowered her with the royal estate of Tusey on the Meuse in Lotharingia, an apt sign of his ambitions in that region. Although Eadgifu produced the long-hoped-for son, Charles's regime collapsed soon afterwards. After his deposition and imprisonment by rebel aristocrats in July 923, and the succession of Rudolf (<i>r</i>. 923&#150;36), Eadgifu struggled to secure her son's literal as well as political survival, and probably also, on her own account, to retain her dower. Little Louis was sent for protection &#145;to his uncle King Athelstan because of the hostility of Hugh [duke of Francia] and Herbert [Heribert (II), count of Vermandois]&#146;  (Richer, 2.1). Louis's departure may have occurred, as usually assumed, in 923, but perhaps happened only after Charles's death in October 929. Eadgifu is generally said to have &#145;taken&#146; Louis, but Folcuin, writing <i>c</i>.960, while mentioning that &#145;she too had suffered many persecutions at this time&#146;, clearly states that she &#145;sent her son to the English&#146;  (Folcuin, chap. 101). Eadgifu apparently preferred to stay in West Francia. She may have played some role in Duke Hugh's marriage to her full-sister Eadhild in 926, splitting the alliance between Hugh and Heribert. Another full-sister, Eadgyth, married Otto, son of the East Frankish king Henry, in late 929 or early 930, perhaps to cement a &#145;legitimist&#146; alliance following Charles's death and Louis's arrival at &AElig;thelstan's court. This could provide a plausible context for the transfer of the so-called Gandersheim gospels, a manuscript of Metz provenance, from West to East Francia, and for the addition on the last leaf of an inscription in Anglo-Saxon square minuscule: &#145;Eadgifu regina :- &aelig;thelstan rex angulsaxonum et mercianorum :-&#146;. Charles's supplanter, Rudolf, died childless in January 936. Some months later, the recall of Louis to Francia &#145;from over the sea &hellip; by Hugh and the other magnates&#146;  (Richer, 2.4) certainly attested &AElig;thelstan's influence but probably also the efforts of Eadgifu and her sister. In 937, as part of a successful attempt to throw off Hugh's &#145;guardianship&#146;, Louis gave his mother charge of the key royal stronghold of Laon, and of the rich convent of Notre Dame there. He thus acknowledged as well as enhanced Eadgifu's political importance. Eadgifu also received, perhaps at this time, the palace of Attigny.<br>
<br>Louis's marriage with Gerberga, sister of Otto I, in 939 did not apparently alter Eadgifu's position at Laon. But when Louis was captured by the Normans in 946, it was Gerberga (not, <i>pace</i> Whitelock, Eadgifu) who wrote to &#145;King Edmund of the English&#146;  (Richer, 2.49), Eadgifu's half-brother, to beg his intervention. In 951:<blockquote>without her son's knowledge, his mother Queen Eadgifu married Count Heribert (III), son of Heribert (II), and after leaving Laon was taken home by him. The king was furious, entered Laon with Queen Gerberga, took away from his mother estates [<i>predia</i>] and the royal palace and bestowed these on his wife. (Richer, 2.101)</blockquote>Flodoard clarifies: Eadgifu left Laon &#145;escorted by the men of Heribert and of his brother Adalbert&#146;  (Flodoard, s.a. 951), before marrying Heribert; and Gerberga then got Notre Dame, Laon, while Louis himself kept Attigny. Both Flodoard and Richer suggest that Eadgifu took the initiative in this alliance. As lay abbot of St M&eacute;dard, Heribert gave many of this rich monastery's lands and revenues to Eadgifu as dower. Although now in her mid-forties, she may have hoped for more offspring. There is no record of her alive after 951. When she died, Heribert saw to her burial at St M&eacute;dard, where in the mid-seventeenth century her barely legible tomb epitaph was deciphered by Jean Mabillon. Heribert died between 980 and 984, leaving no children.<br>
<br>Eadgifu's first, royal, marriage, together with her sisters' marriages, showed the new involvement of Anglo-Saxon rulers in the dynastic alliances of the late Carolingian world, and hence the new standing of Alfred's descendants. Eadgifu's second marriage, to an ambitious young noble, was her response to increasing marginalization at the hands of her son and powerful daughter-in-law: it signalled the special prestige that association with the dowager-queen conferred, yet it was no <i>m&eacute;salliance</i>, for the Vermandois family could boast, like Louis, descent in the male line from Charlemagne. Threatened with political extinction at Laon, Eadgifu preferred, understandably, to live out her days with Heribert at Soissons.<br>
