<span class="headword">Ralston,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1451/2), <span class="occ">bishop of Dunkeld</span>, was the illegitimate son of unknown parents. He is first recorded in 1426 as chaplain and secretary to James I's nephew Archibald Douglas, fifth earl of Douglas. He remained the earl's secretary until Douglas's death in 1439. Ralston, apparently educated at St Andrews University, was styled licensed in canon law and was about to obtain the degree of doctor of canon law when elevated to the episcopacy. There was another John Ralston, a notary, alive in the 1440s, and entries in sources about the two men could be confused; but it appears that the future bishop was rector of Douglas, Lanarkshire (in the patronage of the earls of Douglas), by 1429 until 1443, and dean of Dunkeld from late 1445 until he became bishop there by provision on 27 October 1447. He had been consecrated by 31 March 1448. He may have been in Rome in person briefly in 1446. A single reference to him as provost of Bothwell collegiate church, between 1424 and 1430, is thought to be unreliable.<br>
<br>By 1442 Ralston had begun to appear at the court of James II, possibly as a result of Douglas patronage. He was the king's secretary by January 1443 and occupied that post at least until mid-1448, when he and two others were sent on an embassy first to France, and then to Burgundy, in part to seek a suitable bride for the king. Mary of Gueldres, a kinswoman of the duke of Burgundy, was chosen, and the marriage negotiations were concluded in the spring of 1449. On his return Ralston was briefly king's treasurer, but he was relieved of his duties after the dramatic collapse in September 1449 of the Livingston faction which so dominated court politics in the late 1440s. He may have been connected with the Livingstons, as he had to apply to the king for a remission of rancour. Early in 1450 he resumed his regular appearances as witness to crown charters. Ralston was still alive on 26 October 1451, but he had died by 28 April 1452, when his successor as bishop was provided. He was buried in his cathedral, where he had continued the work of building the nave.<br>
