<span class="headword">Hill, Sir  Enoch</span>  (1865&#150;1942), <span class="occ">building society manager</span>, was born on 10 September 1865 at Ball Haye Green, Leek, Staffordshire, the eldest of the four sons and three daughters of Henry Hill and his wife, Elizabeth Taylor, both of whom were manual workers in the silk-spinning industry. Hill joined that industry himself as a &#145;half-timer&#146;, aged eight, working full time when his schooling finished at the age of thirteen; he tried a number of jobs before settling as a printer. He subsequently acquired a stationery shop and became publisher of the <span class="italic">Leek Post</span>.<br>
<br>Hill was a devout Anglican, and his vicar helped him to remedy his lack of good schooling. In 1887 he became a lay reader in the Lichfield diocese, and married Esther Hayes (<i>d</i>. 1904) of Leek. They had two sons. His wife's uncle was secretary of the Leek United Building Society and Hill helped him part time, later becoming assistant secretary. In 1896 he was appointed secretary of the society, and in consequence handed the printing business on to his brothers. At this time he became an associate of the Chartered Secretaries' Institute, of which he was later a fellow, then treasurer, and (in 1935) president. The Leek United Building Society was in decline when Hill joined it, but by 1903 it had recovered ground, doubling its assets to over &pound;103,000.<br>
<br>In 1903 the post of secretary at the Halifax Building Society became vacant; the Halifax was then Britain's fourth largest society, with assets of &pound;1,400,000. Hill was appointed, and in that role proved a very able publicist, not least in his ability to turn public occasions to his society's advantage; in 1905 he was already setting money aside to celebrate the diamond jubilee of the Halifax in 1913. In 1906, two years after the death of his first wife, Hill married Bertha Henrietta Byrom Gee, the daughter of a musician, Samuel Gee of Leek. They lived at Willow Hall, Halifax.<br>
<br>From the start of his career at the Halifax, Hill strongly advocated owner occupation, then an unimportant category for large societies. In 1903 only 15% of the Halifax's mortgages were for less than &pound;500 and 38% were for more than &pound;5000. By 1911 these figures were reversed to 39% and 11% respectively. In the post-1918 world of rent restriction acts, with owner occupation becoming the norm, the Halifax had both the experience and the reputation to take full advantage of this change. For owner-occupiers, Hill lent a higher percentage of a house's value. Large savers were attracted by higher interest rates and a banking department. A &#145;penny savings&#146; department and home safes recruited small savers. Increased staff, enlarged offices, and a rapidly increasing branch network ensured continuing good service. By 1913 the Halifax had become Britain's largest society, and a merger in 1927 with the Halifax Equitable ensured continued dominance.<br>
<br>Hill joined the society's board as managing director in 1916, becoming successively vice-president (1927) and president (1928). He was knighted in 1928. He served on the Yorkshire board of both Alliance Assurance and Barclays Bank. Active in the affairs of the National Association of Building Societies, he was elected to its council in 1913, and served as chairman (1921&#150;33), deputy chairman (1933&#150;6), and finally vice-president. He was president of the International Congress of Building Societies in 1933. When Hill retired in 1938 the Halifax had more than 16% of all building society funds, compared with 2% when he was appointed. The assets of the society had increased from &pound;1,400,000 to &pound;123 million.<br>
<br>Hill was president of the Conservative Association, successively at Leek and Halifax, and was the unsuccessful Conservative parliamentary candidate at Leek in 1922 and 1923, and also at Huddersfield in 1924 and 1929. Appointed a JP in 1913, he later chaired the lord chancellor's advisory committee for Halifax. Hill was a freemason, and his interests included golf and motoring. Hill died of heart failure at his home, Willow Hall, Halifax, on 13 May 1942. His second wife died in April 1951.<br>
