<span class="headword">Lloyd,  Gamaliel</span>  (1744&#150;1817), <span class="occ">merchant and political reformer</span>, was born on 26 May 1744 at Hulme Hall near Manchester, the second son of four children of George Lloyd (<i>bap</i>. 1708, <i>d</i>. 1783), merchant and manufacturer, and his second wife, Susannah Horton (<i>bap</i>. 1718, <i>d</i>. 1783), daughter of Thomas Horton of Chadderton, Lancashire. The Lloyds had been successful merchants even before the family moved from Mattersey, Nottinghamshire, to Lancashire in the late seventeenth century. George Lloyd, who had taken an MB at Cambridge in 1731 and had been elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1737, moved to Barrowby Hall, near Leeds, some time after 1760, though his son John with his first wife, Eleanor, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wright (<i>d</i>. 1735), continued to reside at Hulme Hall. He became a deputy lieutenant for the West Riding of Yorkshire. Gamaliel and his brother Thomas (1750&#150;1828) were apprenticed in the woollen industry at Leeds, and his other brother, George, became a barrister. His sister, Susannah, married the Revd Henry Wray.<br>
<br>In 1764 Gamaliel Lloyd formed a partnership in a dyeing enterprise with the Gautier family in Leeds. The business eventually failed, and in 1776 he entered a partnership with an Italian merchant, Horace Cattaneo, to export woollen cloth. Although Lloyd was fined in 1777 for &#145;reeling false and short yarn&#146;, Lloyd, Cattaneo &amp; Co. proved profitable, the firm's gross profits totalling &pound;35,000 in 1782. Indeed, Lloyd was one of the half-dozen wealthiest merchants of Leeds. With his profits he purchased a country estate, Stockton Hall, near York. Lloyd became involved in local politics as his business career prospered. He was elected to the Leeds corporation and the common council in 1771, became alderman in 1775, and served as lord mayor for 1778&#150;9. He married in 1780 Elizabeth, daughter of James Attwood of Bristol. They had three children: two daughters and a son.<br>
<br>Beginning in March 1780, Lloyd became an active member of Christopher Wyvill's extra-parliamentary Yorkshire Association. Wyvill and the association movement, which was dominated by the merchant gentry, favoured moderate reforms of parliament. Particularly interested in the association's promotion of shorter parliaments and reform of the civil list and sinecures, Lloyd collected signatures on association petitions and solicited support from the sympathetic county MP, Sir George Savile. He wrote to Savile on 15 May 1780 expressing gratitude for Savile's vote in favour of John Sawbridge's unsuccessful Commons motion for triennial parliaments. Lloyd remained optimistic: &#145;This has very much raised our Spirits &hellip; the Whigs united upon truly Whiggish and Constitutional Grounds, will be an over-match for their Opposers&#146;  (Wyvill, 1.253). He further expressed support for John Dunning's resolution in the Commons citing the growing &#145;influence of the Crown&#146; and lamented the &#145;still greater and more unconstitutional influence of Lords and other great Men by their property in the Boroughs: an influence very dangerous &hellip; as it is the greatest support of the influence of the Crown&#146;  (ibid., 1.261). Parliamentary reform, he asserted, would ensure a shift in political influence to the &#145;wise, honest, able and incorruptible&#146; independent merchants and gentry  (ibid., 1.260&#150;61). His association colleague William Strickland requested that Lloyd encourage participation from fellow merchants in Manchester, Liverpool, Norwich, Birmingham, and Exeter. The association petition circulated by Lloyd obtained an impressive 318 signatures by December 1782.<br>
<br>Upon the failure of the association's petitioning campaign and parliamentary reform, Lloyd became less active politically. He moved in 1789 to Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, and also later acquired a residence at Hampstead, near London. Continuing his interest in reform, however, he made the acquaintance of Capel Lofft, a disciple of John Jebb and leader in Jebb's Society for Constitutional Information. Yet he wrote to Wyvill in 1793 or 1794 that he was alarmed at the increasingly radical nature of Lofft's ideas. Thereafter he lived in quiet retirement until his death by natural causes in Great Ormond Street, London, on 31 August 1817. Although the value of Lloyd's real properties must have been large, the exact figure cannot be determined.<br>
