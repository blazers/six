<span class="headword">Curran <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Brennan]</span>,  Agnes</span>  (1920&#150;2005), <span class="occ">prison governor</span>, was born on 12 February 1920 at 25 Lyle Street, Greenock, Renfrewshire, the eldest of nine children of Mark Brennan, shoemaker, and his wife, Agnes, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hendry. Her first career was as a registered mental nurse and she rose to be deputy matron of Ravenscraig Hospital. She later studied at the Royal College, Edinburgh, for a nursing administrative certificate. She was married first to John Reynolds, a mechanical engineer, but the marriage ended in divorce. On 3 October 1952 she married, second, Edward Curran (<i>d</i>. 2005), a fellow registered mental nurse. She had three children, Mark, John, and Angela. She also cared for some of her siblings while bringing up her own family, after her father died at the early age of forty-six.<br>
<br>After twenty-two years in nursing Curran changed the direction of her career. She began to work for the prison service, having previously undertaken voluntary work in prisons for a number of years. In 1969 she was appointed assistant governor at Gateside prison for women and remained there until its closure in 1975, when she was transferred as deputy governor to Cornton Vale, a new prison for women. She nevertheless retained an interest in nursing and was chairwoman of the Greenock branch of the Royal College of Nursing.<br>
<br>In 1979 Curran became the first female governor of a male prison when she was appointed governor of Dungavel prison, near Strathaven. Her achievement was marked that year at a women of the year luncheon. In a television interview in 1982 she said that she was &#145;taken aback&#146; by her appointment  (<span class="italic">Women of Today</span>). She had thought that she might be appointed deputy governor but was surprised that the government had been courageous enough to appoint a woman governor to a male prison. She believed that there were differences between managing men's and women's prisons. The relationships between women prisoners and between prisoners and staff were well developed and nuanced. For example, women were not afraid to tell her that she had been missed if she had been away from the prison or to tell her if they liked the dress she was wearing. When she arrived at Dungavel she found the all-male environment hostile and men (both staff and prisoners) adopting either &#145;hunter&#146; (aggressive or seductive) or &#145;filial&#146; (protective) attitudes towards her. In her time at Dungavel she managed to change this culture into one more closely resembling &#145;normality&#146; (ibid.).<br>
<br>Curran's time as governor was a success and she was appointed MBE in 1984. She explained her success by saying &#145;I don't see them as murderers, rapists and robbers. I see them as men and I expect them to behave like men.&#146; She claimed that she was annoyed when she had to punish a man&#151;&#145;annoyed that he could be so stupid&#146;&#151;and acknowledged that she ran the institution by courtesy of the prisoners, recognizing that if they chose to be &#145;nasty and aggressive&#146;, the tables could turn very quickly. She challenged the public to think about what prisons were expected to do with men serving long sentences, arguing that it was not enough &#145;to give him a bed and three square meals and see that the workshops conform to the <span class="roman">Factory Acts</span>&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Herald</span>, 11 Oct 2005). She introduced an innovative regime at the medium security prison, where long-term prisoners were preparing for release. Up to 20 of the 100 prisoners worked outside the prison every day, undertaking unpaid work in the community. At a time when the attention of Scottish penal reformers was on the high-profile Barlinnie special unit, Agnes Curran was quietly developing a similar regime for equally serious offenders as they progressed through the prison system from high to medium security. She also encouraged contact between prisoners and members of the public by inviting the latter into the prison twice a year for sales of prisoners' work in aid of charities.<br>
<br>Curran set up In-work Ltd, a programme that offered work to those with mental health problems. She retained an interest in mental health after she retired and was always actively involved with various local charities. She was a member of the Scottish Association for Mental Health, chairwoman of the Inverclyde association, and a member of the community care forum. She was also a district organizer for the Women's Royal Voluntary Service in Inverclyde. A gifted communicator, she was in great demand as a speaker, invariably on the themes of caring for less fortunate people and not dismissing them because they were in prison or had a disability.<br>
<br>Curran's achievement as the first female governor of a male prison became embedded in the history of women's achievements. When asked by a television interviewer in 1982 what other career she might have chosen if she had her life to live again, she replied &#145;I always wanted to be a surgeon. I knew I had a sensitivity to people but I came to realise that my sensitivity was perhaps not so geared to the flesh as to the mind&#146;  (<span class="italic">Women of Today</span>). Her husband Edward died in September 2005. She herself died a fortnight later, on 29 September, at the Inverclyde Royal Hospital, Greenock. The causes of death were given as bronchopneumonia, immobility, general frailty, and depression secondary to her husband's death. She was survived by all three children.<br>
