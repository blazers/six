<span class="headword">Gray,  Andrew</span>, first Lord Gray  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1390, <em>d.</em> in or before 1470), <span class="occ">administrator and landowner</span>, was the son and heir of Sir Andrew Gray of Broxmouth in Roxburghshire (<i>d</i>. before 17 July 1445) and his first wife, Janet, daughter of Sir Roger Mortimer of Fowlis in Angus; the union did much to enhance the wealth and status of the Grays.<br>
<br>First recorded in 1424 as a hostage for the release of James I from captivity in England, Gray (whose father's lands were then valued at 600 merks annually) was exchanged on 9 November 1427 for Malcolm Fleming the younger of Cumbernauld, and thenceforward benefited from royal service. In 1436, probably as a knight, he was one of 1200 Scots who accompanied James I's daughter Margaret to France for her marriage to the dauphin, Louis, but it was probably as a supporter from 1444 of William, eighth earl of Douglas (<i>d</i>. 1452) and his brothers during the minority of James II that his advancement was principally hastened. He had been created Lord Gray of Fowlis by 1 July 1445. In August 1445 Gray and Thomas Spens (<i>d</i>. 1480), archdeacon of Moray, accompanied James II's sisters Eleanor and Joanna to France for their marriages; Gray went from there to the court of the duke of Brittany on behalf of James II, who was still a minor and dominated by a faction led by the Douglases and Livingstons. On 7 October 1449 Gray had a royal charter for lands at Littletoun in Angus, and in the same year he served as ambassador to England and conservator of an Anglo-Scottish truce, roles he repeated in 1451. From 3 January 1450 he was a regular royal council member and parliamentarian.<br>
<br>If Gray had been a Douglas supporter, he traded this for the rewards of serving the crown once James II had asserted his independent authority in 1449&#150;50. The contemporary Auchinleck chronicle names Gray and his eldest son and heir, Patrick, among the seven courtiers who dispatched the eighth earl of Douglas after James II stabbed him (despite a safe conduct) at Stirling Castle on 22 February 1452. Sir Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie's unsubstantiated sixteenth-century tale that Douglas had executed MacLellan, tutor of Bombie (nephew of Patrick, master of Gray), may have some basis in fact as a motivation for Gray's actions. By 12 April 1452 Andrew was master of the king's household and Patrick had received disputed Perthshire lands at Cluny&#151;reasons enough to betray Douglas, perhaps; the other assassins were similarly favoured by the crown.<br>
<br>As one of James II's leading lay supporters in the political crisis following the murder, Gray was envoy to England in June 1452, and after 26 August that year received a royal licence allowing him to erect Huntly Castle in Longforgan in the carse of Gowrie. On 9 June 1455 he sat on the parliamentary assize which finally forfeited the Black Douglases. He served as march warden (1459) and lord auditor (1464), and on 5 March 1465 accompanied James III to Berwick to ratify a fifteen-year truce with England.<br>
<br>Gray had died by 20 January 1470. He had married, by contract dated 31 August 1418, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir John Wemyss of Rires, Fife, who survived him; they had two sons and one daughter. Patrick, Gray's heir, married Margaret, daughter of Sir Malcolm Fleming of Cumbernauld (contract dated 7 February 1440), and then (<i>c</i>.1445) Anabella, daughter of Alexander, first Lord Forbes (<i>d</i>. 1448). He and Anabella had three daughters and a son, <a name="cosubject_54218"></a><span class="headword">Andrew Gray</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1514)<span class="occ"></span>, who was served heir to his dead father in the lands and castle of Cluny on 5 November 1464 and succeeded his grandfather as second Lord Gray, probably as a minor.<br>
<br>In looking to regain the local and court status of his grandfather, lost during his minority, Gray became a committed opponent of James III and of the king's favoured subject David Lindsay, fifth earl of Crawford (<i>d</i>. 1495), Gray's rival in Angus. Gray consequently played a prominent part in the rebellions of 1482 and 1488. In August 1482, with Crawford, he surrendered the town of Berwick to the English army of Richard, duke of Gloucester, which had accompanied James III's exiled brother, Alexander Steward, duke of Albany, to Edinburgh, ostensibly to enable Albany to usurp the Scottish throne as Alexander IV. Gray is named in sixteenth-century histories as one of the nobles responsible for seizing James III at Lauder on 17 July 1482 and imprisoning him in Edinburgh Castle. By January 1483 Gray had joined Albany's supporters at Dunbar in attacking the newly liberated James III. On 11 February 1483 Gray, Archibald Douglas, fifth earl of Angus (<i>d</i>. 1514), and James Liddale of Halkerstoun, now in England, renounced their Scottish allegiance and became liegemen of Edward IV, promising to break the Franco-Scottish alliance and help Albany to depose James III.<br>
<br>Gray, however, was forced to re-enter James III's peace later in 1483; at the same time Crawford was made master of the king's household, an office formerly held by the first Lord Gray. But in 1488 (with Crawford, created duke of Montrose in May) Gray joined those rebels supporting Prince James against the king. Pitscottie and George Buchanan, both writing in the following century, speculate respectively that either a &#145;lordis grayis servandis&#146; or Gray's son Patrick was responsible for James III's death at Sauchieburn.<br>
<br>As a member of James IV's royal council, Gray had on 29 October 1488 letters to grant remission to Crawford once he had given Gray the sheriffdom of Forfar. Gray was named by the rebels of 1489&#150;90 as being among the &#145;parciale personis&#146; of the post-Sauchieburn government, who were exploiting royal patronage, finances, and justice to the detriment of their local rivals. In June 1489 Gray was awarded the lands of Lundie in Angus, and the office of justice-general of the north, forfeited by Robert, second Lord Lyle (<i>d</i>. 1497). He continued to receive royal favour after the political compromise of 1490, obtaining several grants of Forfar lands from James IV as well as the office of justice-general of the south before 24 May 1505.<br>
<br>Gray and his first wife, Janet, daughter of William Keith, first Earl Marischal (<i>d</i>. 1483), had one son and two daughters: Patrick, who married Janet, daughter of George Gordon, second earl of Huntly (<i>d</i>. 1502) (and widow of Alexander, master of Crawford, whom she was accused of smothering), about 1493; Isobel, who married Alexander Stratoun of Lauriston; and Elizabeth, who married John, fourth Lord Glamis (1487), Alexander Gordon, third earl of Huntly (1511), and George Leslie, fourth earl of Rothes (1525). Gray married his second wife, Elizabeth, third daughter of John Stewart, first earl of Atholl, before 1483; they had four sons and two daughters. Gray and his third wife, Margaret Houston (widow of his nephew Robert, second Lord Lyle), whom he married after 1497, had no children. Gray died in February 1514 and was buried near his grandfather in the collegiate church of Fowlis Easter, founded by the latter about 1453.<br>
