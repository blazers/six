<span class="headword">Collins, Sir  Godfrey Pattison</span>  (1875&#150;1936), <span class="occ">politician and publisher</span>, was born on 26 June 1875 at 14 Park Grove Terrace, Glasgow, the second of three children of Alexander Glen Collins (1848&#150;1910), printer and publisher, and his wife, Cornelia (1853&#150;1938), daughter of Godfrey Pattison, merchant, of Glasgow. He was the great-grandson of the founder of the Collins publishing enterprise [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64075/', "Collins family")</script>]. While other sons of the Collins dynasty had been educated at Harrow, Godfrey, intended for a career in the navy, was sent after preparatory school at Temple Grove, East Sheen, to HMS <i>Britannia</i> at the age of thirteen. After service in the East India station he retired from the navy in 1893 to join the expanding family firm, and married on 26 April 1900 (Margaret Jean) Faith, daughter of J. C. Aitken Henderson, with whom he had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Collins was first sent to London to train as a compositor and to learn the technicalities of printing. In 1899 he was dispatched to Germany to investigate state-of-the-art printing machinery. In Leipzig he found revolutionary rotary printing presses and supervised their installation in Glasgow. The Collins enterprise now had its own modern paper-making, printing, and publishing organizations. Cheap books were now possible. First came the <span class="roman">Collins Illustrated Pocket Classics</span> for 1<i>s</i>. each. Some 80,000 copies (ten titles from <span class="italic">David Copperfield</span> to <span class="italic">East Lynne</span>) were sold in the first six months. Then came even cheaper series, the <span class="roman">Nation's Library</span> and the <span class="roman">Sevenpennies</span>.<br>
<br>By 1910 the company, under the joint control of Godfrey Collins and his older brother, was highly successful and Godfrey felt able to follow the family tradition of public service. A known advocate of the social policies of the &#145;new Liberals&#146; and Lloyd George, he was invited to stand as Liberal MP for Greenock. Elected in January 1910, he almost at once became parliamentary private secretary to the secretary of state for war, and was a member of the War Office supplies committee. During 1915&#150;16 he was parliamentary private secretary to the chief Liberal whip.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the First World War, Collins and his brother, together with 275 of their employees, volunteered for service in the army. He was first appointed to the War Office staff of the quartermaster-general. He then served in Egypt, Gallipoli, and Mesopotamia. There he reorganized the chaotic systems of supply and accounting, saving millions of pounds. In recognition he was made CMG in 1917.<br>
<br>Now Lieutenant-Colonel Collins, he returned to the House of Commons. His main interest was in the economy, particularly in the supervision of government expenditure, about which he had found abundant scope for criticism during his war service. His efforts in the Commons were responsible for the establishment of the select committee on public expenditure. In 1919 he was knighted and made a junior lord of the Treasury in Lloyd George's coalition government. But he quickly became disheartened by the squabbles within the divided Liberal Party and with the government's failure to secure the supervision of public expenditure that he saw to be necessary. Finally, unable to accept government policy over reprisals in Ireland, he resigned in February 1920 and crossed the floor of the house to join the Liberals under Asquith. In 1924 he was appointed Liberal chief whip in the House of Commons by Asquith, but was removed when Lloyd George became party leader in 1926.<br>
<br>Collins remained active in publishing. Because of the war, supply of paper and other materials had become difficult and costs had risen. Cheap book production from Glasgow was now impossible. He established an office at 48 Pall Mall, London, and began to publish &#145;new&#146; authors. His first books were previously unpublished works by Henry James. His list soon included H. G. Wells, Rose Macaulay, and Walter de la Mare, among others. He then launched the Crime Club, publishing Agatha Christie, Dorothy Sayers, Ngaio Marsh, and other new authors. His final venture was into the &#145;westerns&#146; so much enjoyed by his former colleague Lloyd George.<br>
<br>In 1931 Collins threw in his lot with the National Government, and retained his Greenock seat with an enlarged majority at the general election held in that year [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96340', "Liberal Nationals")</script>]. He was appointed as secretary of state for Scotland in September 1932 and began the Indian summer for which he will be best remembered. He initiated the Calton Scheme to establish the centre of Scottish administration in Scotland rather than in London. Although he did not live to see the completion of St Andrew's House on Calton Hill in Edinburgh, before his death 96 per cent of the Scottish administrative apparatus had been moved north of the border. During his few years of office he brought in over thirty bills to improve conditions in Scotland. His finest performance in the house was on the <span class="roman">Housing (Scotland) Bill</span> of 1935, a measure to tackle Scotland's notorious housing conditions. Other bills related to education, land reform, and inshore fishing. He set up the economic development committee to consider ways of restoring Scotland's economy that had been devastated earlier in the century. He appointed the committee on Scottish medical services that produced the plan that led, in 1948, to the creation of a national health service in Scotland that was appropriate for Scottish conditions. He was made LLD of Glasgow University in 1935.<br>
<br>Collins was an enthusiastic stalker, an excellent tennis player, and an experienced yachtsman (he represented Britain in the British&#150;American 6 metre cup in 1931). He died of septicaemia on 13 October 1936 following a minor nose operation in Z&uuml;rich, Switzerland. He was buried three days later at the Glasgow necropolis. In a relatively short life he had been a successful publisher and an outstandingly effective secretary of state for Scotland who had never been a partisan politician.<br>
