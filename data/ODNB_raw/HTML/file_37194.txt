<span class="headword">Biscoe,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1794, <em>d.</em> 1843), <span class="occ">merchant navy officer and explorer</span>, was baptized in Enfield on 28 June 1794, the third son and youngest child of Thomas Biscoe of Waltham Abbey and his wife, Ann Tibbs. Nothing is known of his early years, but on leaving school he became a clerk. On 11 March 1812 he volunteered for the <i>San Domingo</i> (74 guns), probably to avoid being pressed into the navy, and he served off North America. On 4 January 1813, as volunteer first class, he entered the brig <i>Colibri</i> (16 guns), which was lost off South Carolina in a hurricane. In 1813&#150;15 he was midshipman, quartermaster, and acting master in the <i>Moselle</i> (16 guns) in the West Indies and off the coast of the United States. Captain John Moberley of the <i>Moselle</i> said of him, &#145;keeps a good reckoning, is attentive and promises to make a good officer&#146;  (TNA: PRO, ADM/6/177/2634). Biscoe was later to name a mountain after Moberley.<br>
<br>Nothing is known about Biscoe's employment from 1815 to 1830, when Messrs C., H., and G. Enderby, oil merchants in the City, proposed an Antarctic sealing voyage, and appointed him master of the brig <i>Tula</i> (150 tons)&#151;which was not a good sea boat&#151;with the cutter <i>Lively</i> and twenty-nine men and boys in all. The two ships left the River Thames on 10 July 1830 and returned in January 1833. Biscoe called at the Falkland Islands for refreshment, searched in vain for the &#145;Aurora Islands&#146;, and between 17 and 31 December 1830 examined the South Sandwich Islands as best he could. On 24&#150;25 February 1831, in lat. 65&deg;57' S, long. 47&deg;20' E, Biscoe discovered Enderby Land, which he named after his employers, sighting black mountain tops showing through the ice-cap. His landfall was probably the Tange peninsula. He charted Cape Ann (named after his mother) and mounts Charles, Henry, George, and Gordon (named after the Enderbys), and Mount Codrington. At a cost to the health of the crew and himself, he persisted off the coast for a month, trying to make a fuller chart. When he reached Hobart Town on 9 May 1831, all save four men were ill with scurvy.<br>
<br>In a second season Biscoe visited New Zealand and the Chatham Islands, and then made for South Shetland. On 15&#150;16 February 1832 he discovered Adelaide Island; then he sighted Alexander Land, charted the Pitt Islands and Anvers Island, and called at South Shetland. He returned home from the Falklands after most of his crew, who could stand no more of the Antarctic, had deserted and he had had to use his own funds to secure supplies. His voyage was outstanding for his persistence and seamanship, and his charts are of high quality, despite his poor equipment; in 1833 he was awarded the royal premium of the Royal Geographical Society and was honoured by the French Geographical Society. He was proposed as an &#145;ordinary member without payment of fees&#146; of the RGS, a testimony to his geographical achievement and to his poverty. He applied in vain to the Admiralty for his master's warrant.<br>
<br>In 1833 Biscoe was appointed by the Enderbys to the <i>Hopefull</i> and the <i>Rose</i> for a similar expedition, but resigned before sailing. In 1834&#150;6 he was in the West Indies trade, and in 1837 sailed from London for Hobart Town, commanding the <i>Superb</i> (345 tons). There he became master of the <i>Emma</i>, a brig of 122 tons. In 1839, at Campbell Island, he met John Balleny and on a sealing voyage (also in 1839) he penetrated what was later named the Ross Sea to lat. 75&deg; S, probably on the Pennell Bank, before its &#145;discovery&#146; by James Clark Ross. In 1839&#150;41 Biscoe commanded the <i>Marian Watson</i> and the <i>Trugenina</i>, trading out of Sydney.<br>
<br>Biscoe's health was failing and there was a subscription, to which Sir John Franklin was a leading contributor, for his return to England. He embarked on the <i>Janet Izatt</i>, but the hardships of his exploring voyages had broken his health and he died at sea or in a port somewhere between Sydney and London at some time between February and June 1843. More precise information cannot be obtained since the ship's log was destroyed. He left his wife, Emma Crowe (the daughter of a Hackney bootmaker, whom he had married on 8 September 1836 in Whitechapel), a daughter, and three sons in extreme poverty. Among those who subscribed for their relief was Queen Adelaide, after whom Biscoe had named an island in the Antarctic. His eldest son, William John Dawson, was given a charity place at the Greenwich Hospital school and in 1901 his daughter, Emily, was given a civil-list pension of &pound;30 for her father's services to geography. Biscoe was the first to chart portions of the Antarctic continent and, despite limited means and difficult conditions, contributed significantly to Antarctic exploration.<br>
