<span class="headword">Page <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Aderson, Addersell; <em>married name </em>Dry]</span>,  Damaris</span>  (<em>c.</em>1610&#150;1669), <span class="occ">bawd and brothel keeper</span>, was the daughter of one John Aderson (Addersell). Little is known about her private life. She was from an early date publicly known as Damaris Page, but how she acquired that surname is obscure. She was married on 18 April 1653 at St Mary Magdalen, Bermondsey, to James Dry. Two years later, when she was indicted and tried for bigamy, it was alleged that since 1640 she had also been married to one William Baker of Stepney. But it is probable that this was a trumped-up charge, for there is no record of the marriage in the relevant parish register, and she was found not guilty by a jury at Middlesex quarter sessions. James Dry predeceased her and she did not marry again. Towards the end of her life she remained close to her sister Margaret, a widow, to whom she bequeathed an annuity of &pound;10.<br>
<br>Damaris Page made her fortune as one of the most successful bawds in the east end of London, catering especially to its large seafaring population. By the 1650s she was able to diversify into property speculation, building several houses on Ratcliffe Highway which provided her with a steady income for the remainder of her life. Page herself never learned to write, but at the Restoration in 1660 her public notoriety was reflected and fuelled by a series of Grub Street pamphlets that used her name to peddle fictitious accounts of metropolitan prostitution, beginning with John Garfield's serialized <span class="italic">The Wandring Whore</span>, in each episode of which she was made to head the list of &#145;Crafty Bawds&#146;.<br>
<br>The restored monarchy's massive expansion of the navy in the mid-1660s brought Page further success and a new association with the highest circles of government. The naval high command was desperate for sailors, and she proved adept at recruiting them through her trade. But the connection was unpopular as well as profitable. On Easter Monday 1668 hers was the first house to be targeted in the great bawdy house riots that swept across the capital in protest at the government's repressive religious policies. The tradition of Shrove Tuesday apprentice riots against brothels was appropriated to contrast the regime's laxness in policing morals with its severity in persecuting dissenters. &#145;Some blood hath been spilt&#146;, reported Samuel Pepys a few days later, &#145;but a great many houses pulled down; and among others, the Duke of York was mighty merry at that of Damaris Page's, the great bawd of the seamen&#146;  (Pepys, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 9.132). In the propaganda war that accompanied and followed the demonstrations Page's name was again used to attract publicity to scurrilous writings, this time in a satirical &#145;petition&#146; on behalf of all the whores and bawds of London to their supposed leader, the king's own whore, the countess of Castlemaine, and in the supposed replies by Lady Castlemaine to this. But the riots did not interrupt business for long, and her bawdy house, the Three Tuns in Stepney, was soon resurrected. Barely a year later, in June 1669, the duke of York, the lord high admiral, was no doubt delighted to learn that Sir Edward Spragge, who was about to sail to the Mediterranean,<blockquote>was the day before at Damaris Page's, the most famous bawd in town, and there had made so much of her that she had already furnished him with about forty seamen to man his ship the <i>Revenge</i>, and that she would do more.</blockquote>&#145;As long as Damaris Page lived&#146;, Spragge told Pepys publicly, &#145;he was sure he should not lack men&#146;  (<span class="italic">Samuel Pepys and the Second Dutch War</span>, 216&#150;17). A few months later, while in the Marshalsea prison, she fell ill and died on 9 October. She was buried the following day at St George the Martyr, Southwark.<br>
