<span class="headword">Cameron <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Wales-Almy]</span>,  Charlotte</span>  (1872/3&#150;1946), <span class="occ">traveller and author</span>, was born in Portsmouth, the daughter of Jacob Wales-Almy (<i>d</i>. in or before 1901), a captain in the Royal Navy. Nothing is known of her upbringing and early life. She was married to Major Donald Cameron (<i>d</i>. in or before 1901) of the 42nd Highlanders. After being widowed, she married again, aged twenty-eight, on 29 May 1901; her second husband was Auguste Ernest George Jacquemard de Landresse (<i>b</i>. 1872/3), gentleman, son of Seraphin Jacquemard de Landresse, gentleman, but this union may have been short-lived for she did not use her second husband's name.<br>
<br>By the time of her election to fellowship of the Royal Geographical Society in 1913 (when she was among the second cohort of women members), Cameron, who was living at 36 Carlton Hill, London, had been twice around the world. She had also published a travel account, <span class="italic">A Woman's Winter in South America</span> (1911), with a further volume, <span class="italic">A Woman's Winter in Africa: a 26,000 Mile Journey</span> (1913), in the press. Her two novels&#151;<span class="italic">A Passion in Morocco</span> (1911) and <span class="italic">A Durbar Bride</span> (1912)&#151;were based on her travels, including her time in India (1911), when she acted as foreign correspondent for the <span class="italic">Ladies Pictorial</span> and other periodicals. She was also a member of the Lyceum Club (where she was vice-president of the geographical circle), the Author's Society, the Society of Women Journalists, and she was a fellow of the Colonial Institute and fellow of the Royal Empire Society.<br>
<br>During the First World War Cameron travelled throughout the United States (1917&#150;18) giving lectures in support of the allied cause. After the war she was awarded the OBE. She travelled over 250,000 miles between 1910 and 1925, largely by sea and railway, taking in Alaska and the Yukon (1919), Australasia and the Pacific (1921&#150;2 and 1922&#150;3), and Mexico (1924), each resulting in a travel account: <span class="italic">A Cheechako in Alaska and Yukon</span> (1920), <span class="italic">Two Years in Southern Seas</span> (1923), <span class="italic">Wanderings in South-Eastern Seas</span> (1924), and <span class="italic">Mexico in Revolution</span> (1925). She wrote three further novels and continued to travel in the 1930s, but did not publish any further travel accounts. An avid collector of local curios and souvenirs, she presented a collection of indigenous handicraft to Liverpool Museum (1938) and a further collection of oriental items to the Royal Scottish Museum in Edinburgh (1945). Latterly she was resident at the Hyde Park Hotel, Knightsbridge. She died at 95 Howards Lane, Putney, London, on 9 December 1946.<br>
<br>Cameron was a keen proponent of the British empire. In <span class="italic">Two Years in Southern Seas</span> she chronicled the virtues of colonial expansion and the work of colonialists, including a brief hagiography of Thomas Stamford Raffles and British oil drilling in Miri. Her outlook reflected a genre of her time, particularly in Anglocentric cultural and social judgements of race. However, her admiration for Prince Yumar's physique in her novel of 1911 (albeit that his character has been modified by an Oxford education) and her praise of the sultan of Jahore and admiration of &#145;native grace and beauty&#146;  (Cameron, <span class="italic">Wanderings</span>, 47) suggest that her attitudes were not uniform, but were cut across by class and individual experience. Similar complexity can be seen in her horror of British vulnerability to the threat of German expansion in the Americas (1911) and her appreciation of the kindnesses she received from Germans living in and travelling around Africa (1913). Other recurring themes in her books are the rights of women, harsh penal codes (including Britain's record in Tasmania), and the refrain of &#145;East is East, and West is West&#146;.<br>
<br>Cameron was described by an obituarist as a &#145;woman explorer&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 11 Dec 1946), but could arguably be considered more of a sightseer or globetrotter, &#145;determined to get to the end of the beaten track but never off it&#146;  (Robinson). Critics appreciated her practical advice on travelling and her lively style, but were intolerant when this became gushing or melodramatic and, in the case of her African travels, included her <i>alter ego</i>, the &#145;imp of travel&#146; who added &#145;his&#146; own comments to the text. While her novels were credited with accurate settings in foreign countries, her travel writing is often pedestrian, including well-known information and secondhand accounts.<br>
<br>In her later work Cameron moved away from cataloguing hotel bills and attempts to include historical and political context to places visited (although not always accurate), as well as geographical information on matters such as trade and population, including her own photographic record. Cameron adopted for herself the late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century discourse of intrepid adventurer: &#145;Travel has been my comrade, Adventure my inspiration, Accomplishment my recompense&#146;  (Cameron, <span class="italic">Wanderings</span>), crediting herself with the bloodline of military, naval, and pioneer ancestors. However, she coupled this self-image with that of vulnerable woman alone, obliged by ill health to travel. She did experience a dramatic exit from revolutionary war-torn Mexico, for example, but for the most part her travels were perhaps more socially brave in setting out for six months at a time without a companion. In doing so she transgressed class and gender expectations, but in other respects her travel was socially (and racially) circumscribed, travelling by established means of public transport and largely confined to European contacts along the way. Her work is of value not only for its insight into the colonial outlook of the time but also as a social exploration of the places she visited and the people she met, albeit largely via a network of European colonial ports and expatriates.<br>
