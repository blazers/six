<span class="headword">Southwell,  Thomas</span>, first Baron Southwell  (<em>c.</em>1665&#150;1720), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at &#145;Glanamorohe Rhaiaile&#146;, co. Limerick, Ireland  (Foster, <span class="italic">Alum. Oxon., 1500&#150;1714</span>, 4.1393), the eldest son of Richard Southwell (<i>d</i>. before February 1680), politician, and his wife, Lady Elizabeth O'Brien (<i>d</i>. 1688). Richard Southwell's father, Thomas Southwell of Castle Mattress (now Castle Matrix), co. Limerick, had been created a baronet in 1662. On his grandfather's death in May 1681, the younger Thomas succeeded him in his title and estates. Responsibility for Sir Thomas's estates and education was placed in the hands of guardians, who requested the advice of his kinsman Sir Robert Southwell, later Irish secretary of state. Sir Thomas landed in England in October 1681, and matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, two months later. He left in 1684 without a degree. After finding that he was unable to afford a journey to the continent, and was forbidden to enter the inns of court by his guardians, Southwell probably returned to Ireland.<br>
<br>In late 1688, anticipating an invasion by James II, Southwell and his brother <a href="#cosubject_26069">William [<i>see below</i>]</a> raised a troop of one hundred horse in co. Limerick, in an attempt to secure Munster for William III. Facing opposition, Southwell and his party retreated north towards Ulster but were captured by the Jacobite sheriff of Galway, James Power, tried for and found guilty of treason, and imprisoned for fifteen months. The psychological torture and other privations they endured provided material for William King's anti-Catholic <span class="italic">The State of the Protestants of Ireland under the Late King James's Government</span> (1691). Although attainted by the Irish parliament in May 1689, Southwell was released from Galway in April 1690 into the custody of the earl of Seaforth, who took him to Scotland and allowed him to return to the government forces. Southwell's colleagues remained imprisoned until after the battle of the Boyne. In 1692 Southwell successfully petitioned William and Mary for &pound;500 to cover the costs he had incurred in maintaining the poorest prisoners and buying reprieves from the death sentences passed upon them.<br>
<br>Southwell then devoted himself to the Williamite reconstruction of Ireland. In April 1693 he was made a commissioner to inspect and collect arrears on crown lands. More importantly, by August of that year he was already involved in settling continental protestant families in Ireland, initially from France. A Treasury letter of 19 August authorized the provision of victuals for the families for a month, and another of 14 July 1695 a grant to Southwell of &pound;180 7<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. for the cost of transporting the families from London. Most of the protestants were linen manufacturers, the most prominent being Samuel-Louis Crommelin. The majority did not settle in co. Limerick but in Ulster where there was already a substantial protestant population. Southwell remained an active campaigner for the cause of linen manufacturing in Ireland. In correspondence with Charles Montagu from about 1698  (BL, Add. MS 4761, fols. 183&#150;93) he discussed the influence of English legislation encouraging the export of wool from Ireland to England, and suggested further measures to encourage Irish linen and discourage the sale of Irish wool outside the British Isles. One of the consequences was the establishment of the royal corporation, by which the government gave financial support to Crommelin's investment. The correspondence reveals Southwell to have been anxious to promote voluntary co-operation between Ireland and England on economic matters, as the basis for a secure protestant settlement in both countries.<br>
<br>On 4 April 1696 Southwell married Meliora Coningsby (<i>d</i>. 1735), daughter of the first Earl Coningsby; the couple had six sons and five daughters, seven of whom survived infancy. In the previous year he had been elected member of the Irish parliament for co. Limerick which he represented until 1699 and again in the years 1703&#150;13 and 1715&#150;17. As an active whig, Southwell continued to enjoy several administrative positions. From 1697 to 1713 and from 1714 to his death he was a commissioner of the revenue. On 12 February 1701 he was appointed a trustee for the erection of barracks in Ireland, and on 4 December 1702 he became a trustee for the establishment of the linen manufacture, as provided for in the legislation he had supported setting up the royal corporation. He was sworn of the Irish privy council in 1710. The arrival in England of the protestant exiles from the Palatinate, Germany, inspired Southwell to further action; by 1712 he had settled 130 German protestant families in co. Limerick, but encountered difficulty in acquiring compensation for his expenses from the government. It was not until 1718 that George I agreed to discharge Southwell's debts and support the Palatine families on his estates for seven years. Despite Southwell's efforts the settlement was not a success.<br>
<br>Although Southwell seems to have been out of favour and office at the end of Anne's reign, the accession of George I helped to restore his political fortunes, and he was created an Irish baron, as Baron Southwell of Castle Mattress, co. Limerick, on 4 September 1717. He died suddenly in Dublin on 4 August 1720, and was buried at Rathkeale, co. Limerick. His widow died in London on 22 October 1735.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_26069"></a><span class="headword">William Southwell</span>  (1669&#150;1720), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was the younger brother of the first Baron Southwell. After his release from imprisonment in Galway following the defeat of James II, he continued his military career. He was commissioned in Colonel Hamilton's regiment of foot on 1 September 1693, and was promoted to captain-lieutenant the following August. He was severely wounded at Terra Nova, Namur, but survived and was promoted to captain in September 1695. On half pay after the Nine Years' War, he returned to service for the War of the Spanish Succession. He was made a major in Colonel James Rivers's regiment of foot in February 1702, and a lieutenant-colonel in January 1704. His distinguished leadership during the siege of Barcelona in September 1705 ensured the capture of the fortress of Monjuich; Southwell was the first officer through the breach and he obtained the surrender. He was rewarded with the temporary governorship of the fortress and the colonelcy of his old regiment, Hamilton being reassigned. Ill health prevented him from commanding the regiment at Almanza in April 1707, when he was in England; on 14 June 1708 he sold his regiment to Colonel Harrison for 5000 guineas. The duke of Marlborough obtained his horse as a gift for the duchess  (Snyder, 965). He returned to Ireland where he had been elected MP for Kinsale, co. Cork, in 1703, and supported the whigs. He was returned for Castlemartyr, co. Cork, in 1713. In 1714 he was captain of the lord lieutenant of Ireland's honour guard, and from the next year until his death he was MP for Baltimore, co. Cork.<br>
<br>Southwell was married to Lucy (<i>d</i>. 1733), youngest daughter and coheir of William Bowen of Ballyadams, Queen's county; they had five sons and eight daughters. William Southwell died on 23 January 1720.<br>
