<span class="headword">Shuttleworth,  Joseph <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Joshua]</span></span>  (1819&#150;1883), <span class="occ">agricultural engineer</span>, was born at Dog Dyke on the Witham River in Lincolnshire on 12 July 1819, the son of John Allenby Shuttleworth of Coningsby, a boat builder, and his wife, Rebecca Newton. He was baptized Joshua. He left school at the age of fourteen to follow his father's trade, and two years later in 1835 took over the management of a boat-building yard at Lincoln, which his father had acquired. Within a few years the increased prosperity of the yard had so impressed John Shuttleworth that he turned the business over to his son.<br>
<br>Nathaniel Clayton was working in adjoining premises as an iron-founder and steam-packet owner, and in 1842 he and Shuttleworth established the firm of Clayton, Shuttleworth &amp; Co. Iron-founding soon became their main interest, with the railway boom at first providing a rapidly expanding market. This was followed by the start of their rise to prominence as agricultural engineers. With some financial backing from a local firm of corn merchants and millers they began the manufacture of portable steam engines in 1845, and steam threshing machines in 1849. They were one of the first, and certainly one of the most successful, manufacturers of steam-powered farm machinery. They were not outstanding, however, as technical innovators, preferring simply to adopt, or in some cases adapt, the best of the available designs and put their efforts into efficient manufacture, a high standard of materials and workmanship, and competitive marketing. At an early stage in their expansion they came to realize the opportunities presented by overseas markets, and they established an office and works in Vienna in 1857 to serve the countries of central and eastern Europe. A decade later they developed a substantial export trade to Australia and South America. By the time of Shuttleworth's death the firm had manufactured 19,000 portable steam engines and 17,000 threshing machines, as well as finishing machines, straw and hay elevators, and portable grinding mills.<br>
<br>Shuttleworth's other business interests included, at various times, directorships of the Metropolitan Railway, the Great Northern Railway, the Sutton Bridge Dock Company, and the Agricultural Hall Company, and he was a valued member of the council of the Royal Agricultural Society. He was elected a vice-president of the Agricultural Engineers' Association when it was formed in 1875. He was active also in the volunteer militia (forerunner of the Territorial Army), in which he rose to the rank of captain. For many years he was a member of the town council of Lincoln, and in 1858&#150;9 was chief magistrate. He was a JP and deputy lieutenant of the county of Lincoln, and in 1881 was elected high sheriff of Bedfordshire. The local charities found in him a generous benefactor.<br>
<br>In 1842 Shuttleworth married Sarah Grace, daughter of the elder Nathaniel Clayton and sister of his partner. They had two sons. His first wife died in 1849, and in 1861 he married Caroline Jane, daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Richard George Ellison of Boultham Hall. They had no children. He died at home at Hartsholme Hall, Skellingthorpe, near Lincoln, on 25 January 1883.<br>
