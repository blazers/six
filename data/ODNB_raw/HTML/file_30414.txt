<span class="headword">Anderson, Sir  Thomas  McCall</span>  (1836&#150;1908), <span class="occ">physician and dermatologist</span>, was born at 159 St Vincent Street, Glasgow, on 9 June 1836. One of eight children, he was the second son of Alexander Dunlop Anderson (1794&#150;1871), a medical practitioner in Glasgow and former president of the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, and his wife, Sarah, daughter of Thomas McCall of Craighead, Lanarkshire. His father's family was related on the maternal side to William Dunlop (1649?&#150;1700) principal of Glasgow University (1690&#150;1700), and in the male line he was descended from John Anderson (1668&#150;1721) defender of Presbyterianism, and collaterally from John Anderson (1726&#150;1796) founder of the Andersonian Institute, Glasgow.<br>
<br>After school in Edinburgh, Anderson graduated MD with honours at Glasgow University (1858) and later became a licentiate and then fellow of the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow. After about two years' residency in Glasgow Royal Infirmary and a similar period studying in Paris, W&uuml;rzburg, Berlin, Vienna, and Dublin he was appointed lecturer (1861) and professor (1865) of practice of medicine in the Andersonian Institute with clinical facilities in the Glasgow Royal Infirmary, where he was later appointed physician.<br>
<br>In 1861 the Glasgow Skin Dispensary was founded with Anderson and Andrew Buchanan (<i>d</i>. 1865) as physicians. Anderson remained in charge until his death in 1908. He married Margaret Richardson, daughter of Alexander Ronaldson, merchant of Glasgow, on 20 July 1864. Their son, Thomas, practised medicine in New York, while the eldest of five daughters was twice decorated in the South African War and became matron successively of Newcastle Infirmary and St George's Hospital, London.<br>
<br>Anderson became Glasgow University's first professor of clinical medicine in 1874, a post which he held in conjunction with that of physician to the new Western Infirmary. In 1900 he succeeded Sir William Tennant Gairdner as regius professor of practice of medicine. As dean of the faculty of medicine in 1900 Anderson represented the university at several international conferences and, from 1903, on the General Medical Council. Between 1897 and 1901 Anderson was the first non-London examiner in medicine and pathology for the British and Indian military medical services, resulting in increased recruitment of Glasgow graduates to those services. Knighted in 1905, he was appointed honorary physician to the king in Scotland in 1907.<br>
<br>The lucidity and skill of Anderson's clinical teaching, his broad concept of medicine, his understanding of his own capabilities, and his intelligent advice attracted large numbers of students. His demonstration classes were clear, systematic, concentrated on the subject in hand, and stressed the practical aspects of the discipline. He reminded his pupils that, while medicine was a liberal profession, the physician's business was to cure the sick.<br>
<br>Anderson's papers include <span class="italic">Lectures on Clinical Medicine</span> (1887), papers on tuberculosis (1877, 1905), <span class="italic">Syphilitic Affections of the Nervous System</span> (1889) and eleven papers on diseases of the middle ear (1861&#150;7). His interest in skin diseases was aroused by Ferdinand von Hebra in Vienna. Anderson wrote brilliantly on <span class="italic">Parasitic Affections of the Skin</span> (1861), on eczema (1863), and on fungal diseases of the skin (1866). These are among at least ten important contributions made by Anderson to the dermatological literature. A careful observer, he sought constantly to explain what he saw. He emphasized the importance to dermatologists of a sound knowledge of general medicine, anticipating modern opinion by at least fifty years. His ability attracted a large consulting practice, enabling him to publish <span class="italic">A Treatise on Diseases of the Skin</span> (1887), a well-received textbook on dermatology.<br>
<br>A Conservative in politics (he was president of the Glasgow Conservative Association (college division)) and a Church of Scotland elder, Anderson had a genial and obliging, though reserved, disposition. Somewhat below average height, his distinguished appearance was enhanced by a flowing moustache. He enjoyed cycling and golf. Anderson died suddenly of a heart attack (the second within a year) on 25 January 1908 after addressing the Glasgow Ayrshire Society at their dinner in St Enoch's Hotel, Glasgow. A public funeral in the university's Bute Hall was followed by burial in the Glasgow necropolis on 29 January 1908.<br>
<br>In 1909, the Glasgow Skin Dispensary moved to the Western Infirmary, where Anderson had earlier secured twenty beds for skin patients. A university lectureship and, later, a chair named after him were established and were funded, as were the beds, by endowments from the skin dispensary.<br>
