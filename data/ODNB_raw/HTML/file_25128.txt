<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Settle,  Elkanah</span>  (1648&#150;1724), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was born on 1 February 1648 at Dunstable in Hertfordshire, the eldest of five children of Josias Settle (<i>d</i>. 1666), a barber and innkeeper, and his wife, Sarah.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlyworks"></a>Education and early works</h2>Settle was educated in the Dunstable area, and then at Westminster School, where he was a king's scholar. His education seems to have been financed by his uncle, also called Elkanah Settle, who later left him his estate. In 1666 Settle's first published work appeared, a patriotic poem on the Second Anglo-Dutch War, entitled <span class="italic">Mare clausum, or, A Ransack for the Dutch</span>. In the same year he left Westminster for Trinity College, Oxford, from where he matriculated on 13 July 1666. Shortly after he arrived in Oxford he began writing his first play, a heroic tragedy called <span class="italic">Cambyses</span>, on which he may have collaborated with a fellow undergraduate, William Butler Fyfe. The play was completed by December 1666, and was then accepted and performed by the Duke's Company managed by William Davenant, at its theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields. It was a success, running for six days with a full house and earning Settle the patronage of Anne, duchess of Buccleuch and Monmouth, to whom the published version was subsequently dedicated.<h2>
<a name="TheEmpressofMoroccoandthefeudwithDryden"></a>The Empress of Morocco and the feud with Dryden</h2>By the spring of 1667 Settle had left Oxford, without finishing his degree, and moved to London, where he became acquainted with the earl of Norwich, the earl of Rochester, and the earl of Mulgrave, probably through the influence of the duchess of Buccleuch and Monmouth. Within two years he had written another two plays, <span class="italic">The Conquest of China</span> and <span class="italic">The Empress of Morocco</span>, and a poem on the fire of London. <span class="italic">The Conquest of China</span> was not a great success, but <span class="italic">The Empress of Morocco</span> was enthusiastically received, and marked both the high point of Settle's literary career and the source of his literary feud with John Dryden. The play, a heroic tragedy in rhyming couplets, was selected for presentation at the court in Whitehall, where it was performed several times, to great admiration, in late 1672 or early 1673. In this amateur production the characters were played by courtiers, and both the earl of Mulgrave and the earl of Rochester contributed prologues for the performances, which were spoken by Lady Elizabeth Howard. At this time Settle held a post at court, having been appointed steward in 1672, probably through the influence of Rochester and Mulgrave. The court performances of <span class="italic">The Empress of Morocco</span> were followed on 3 July 1673 by the play's first public performance, by the Duke's Company, at Dorset Garden, where it was said to have run for a whole month. The play capitalized on the current fashion for bombastic rhymed drama set in exotic locations, and it was plotted around conflicts of love and honour in the royal house of Morocco. One of the chief attractions of the tragedy was undoubtedly its spectacular staging, and its elaborate palace scenes, fleets of ships, imprisoned princesses, and violent assassinations. The new playhouse at Dorset Garden was well suited to such a performance, having been recently equipped with the latest stage machinery and scenery. The King's Company, unable to compete with the visual splendour of the production, responded in December 1673 with <span class="italic">The Empress of Morocco: a Farce</span>, a burlesque of Settle's tragedy by Thomas Duffett.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Empress of Morocco</span> was published in 1673, advertising Settle on its title-page as &#145;Servant to his Majesty&#146;. The play was accompanied by an epistle dedicatory to the earl of Norwich, the prologues by Rochester and Mulgrave, and six engravings. It was this prestigious edition of the play that seems to have riled Settle's older contemporary John Dryden, who joined forces in 1674 with Thomas Shadwell and John Crowne to mount an attack on Settle and his work, entitled <span class="italic">Notes and Observations on &#145;The Empress of Morocco&#146;</span>. The group as a whole seems to have been motivated by jealousy of the young playwright's position at the court, and Dryden in particular was angered by Settle's references in the dedication to the laureate's attempts to gain patronage from the court wits with his latest play, <span class="italic">The Assignation</span> (1673). The collaborative <span class="italic">Notes and Observations</span> took the form of a lengthy critique of Settle's tragedy, which attacked the author for his low birth and lack of learning, parodied the bombast of the play, and questioned its elevated poetic language. Settle responded in the same year with his own <span class="italic">Notes and Observations on &#145;The Empress of Morocco&#146; Revised</span> in which he defended his use of simile and metaphor, and applied the charges of bombast and high-flown language to Dryden's own recent heroic tragedy, <span class="italic">The Conquest of Granada</span>. It was during this controversy that Settle married Mary Warner, on 28 February 1674, in the parish church of St Andrew, Holborn. His wife seems to have died not long afterwards, and left no children.<h2>
<a name="Dramaandpolitics16761688"></a>Drama and politics, 1676&#150;1688</h2>Following the success of <span class="italic">The Empress of Morocco</span>, Settle put on a series of plays, including the early <span class="italic">Conquest of China</span> and an adaptation of William Heminge's tragedy <span class="italic">The Fatal Contract</span> (1653), which was renamed <span class="italic">Love and Revenge</span>. But he was no longer the court favourite, as he acknowledged in the prologue to the later, and more successful, heroic drama <span class="italic">Ibrahim</span>, produced in 1676:<blockquote>
<div>Applause is grown a strange Coy Mrs. Now;<br>
</div>
<div>Courted by All, and yet obtained by few.<br>
</div> (prologue)</blockquote>
<span class="italic">Ibrahim</span> was a dramatization of Madeleine de Scudery's <span class="italic">Ibrahim, or, The Illustrious Bassa</span>, which had been translated by Henry Cogan in 1652. It was followed in the same year by another romance adaptation, <span class="italic">Pastor fido, or, The Faithful Shepherd</span>, a play based on Richard Fanshawe's 1648 translation of Battista Guarini's pastoral <span class="italic">Il pastor fido</span>. Although Settle's play was again written in rhymed heroic verse, its epilogue announced its author's intention to abandon drama in rhyme, and in 1680 Settle's first venture in blank verse appeared, a tragedy called <span class="italic">Fatal Love, or, The Forced Inconstancy</span>, which was based on Achilles Tatius's Greek romance <span class="italic">Leucippe and Clitiphon</span>. With its anti-Catholic satire on priests and nuns, <span class="italic">Fatal Love</span> also marked the beginnings of the playwright's engagement with the politics of the exclusion crisis.<br>
<br>Between 1679 and 1683 Settle devoted much of his energy to political propaganda, writing on behalf of the whig exclusionists. In addition to producing pamphlets and satires, he seems to have been engaged by the earl of Shaftesbury, on behalf of the emergent whig party, to devise and manage the performance of the whigs' popular anti-Catholic pope-burning pageants in the City of London. The pageant that he created in 1680 was said to have been the most lavish on record, costing &pound;1000 to produce. In the same year Settle also wrote his virulently anti-Catholic play <span class="italic">The Female Prelate</span>, an attack on the hypocrisy and licentiousness of the Roman church, which was acted at the Theatre Royal in the autumn of 1680 and published almost immediately afterwards, with a dedication to the earl of Shaftesbury. During the same period, just before the third Exclusion Parliament of March 1681, Settle also wrote, possibly commissioned by Shaftesbury, a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">The Character of a Popish Successour, and what England may Expect from Such A One</span>. In it the playwright attempted to influence the outcome of the forthcoming parliament by demonstrating the need for legislation to avoid a Catholic succession, and he charged James, duke of York, with trying to alienate the affections of the English people from their king. The <span class="italic">Character</span> provoked a number of replies from tory propagandists, to which Settle in turn responded later in 1681 with <span class="italic">A Vindication of &#145;The Character of a Popish Successor&#146;</span>.<br>
<br>Having established himself as a defender of whig arguments, Settle then went on to write a reply to John Dryden's attack on the whigs in his mock-biblical satire <span class="italic">Absalom and Achitophel</span>. Settle's answer to the poem, entitled <span class="italic">Absalom Senior, or, Achitophel Transpros'd</span>, appeared anonymously in April 1682. It began with a lengthy attack on the pope, and then went on to satirize the duke of York as Absalom and the marquess of Halifax as Achitophel, and to eulogize the earl of Shaftesbury and the duke of Monmouth as Barzillai and Ithream. The poem ended with an ironic prophecy on the glories of James's future reign. Settle's commitment to the whigs also involved him in another literary feud at this time, with the playwright Thomas Otway. In his poem <span class="italic">The Poet's Complaint of his Muse</span> (1680) Otway had satirized Rochester, Settle, and Shadwell, and Settle is said subsequently to have challenged Otway to a duel.<h2>
<a name="Changesinpoliticalallegiance16821689"></a>Changes in political allegiance, 1682&#150;1689</h2>Settle had consistently aligned himself with the whigs up until 1682. However, the earl of Shaftesbury's departure for the Netherlands, and the effective defeat of the exclusionist agenda at the end of 1682, brought about a shift in his political allegiances, and he began to write tory propaganda. In 1683 he published a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">A Narrative</span>, in which he offered a series of explanations for his recantation. In the same piece he also exonerated the duke of York from any involvement in the plot, and attacked Titus Oates's <span class="italic">Narrative of the Popish Plot</span>, demonstrating that Oates's evidence was flawed and contradictory. Although Settle's political conversion was met with ridicule and scepticism by many of his contemporaries, he went on to publish a series of tory works, including <span class="italic">A Panegyrick on the Loyal and Honourable Sir George Jefferies</span> (1683), <span class="italic">Animadversions on the Last Speech and Confession of the Late William, Lord Russell</span> (also 1683), and <span class="italic">An Heroick Poem on the Coronation of James II</span> (1685). He also entered James's army on Hounslow Heath, where he is unlikely to have seen any active service, and between August and October 1688 he took over the editing of the pro-government publication <span class="italic">Publick Occurrences Truly Stated</span>, formerly edited by Henry Care. He continued his support of James II right up until the invasion of William of Orange, publishing an attack on the Dutch, entitled <span class="italic">Insignia Bataviae, or, The Dutch Trophies Display'd</span>, in 1688. However, again he was supporting a losing side, and following the accession of William and Mary he changed allegiances, and published the Williamite Pindaric ode <span class="italic">A View of the Times, with Britain's Address to the Prince of Orange</span> in 1689.<h2>
<a name="Dramaandpoetry16881718"></a>Drama and poetry, 1688&#150;1718</h2>Settle's first major work after the revolution was a tragedy, <span class="italic">Distress'd Innocence, or, The Princess of Persia</span> (1691), on which he collaborated with Thomas Betterton and William Mountfort. In the preface to the play he declared his intention to leave political engagement for drama, and he went on to write a series of works that capitalized on the contemporary vogue for opera and semi-opera. In 1692 he produced <span class="italic">The Fairy Queen: an Opera</span>, based on Shakespeare's <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span> and set to music by Henry Purcell, which was performed at the Queen's Theatre, where it met with an enthusiastic response. It was followed in 1695 by <span class="italic">Philaster, or, Love Lies Bleeding</span>, an adaptation of the tragicomedy <span class="italic">Philaster</span> by Beaumont and Fletcher (published 1620). In 1697 he presented a comedy-opera, <span class="italic">The World in the Moon</span>, again complete with elaborate singing and dancing scenes, which was published with a dedication claiming that it was the most elaborate dramatic production ever performed on the English stage. In 1701 there was another highly extravagant visual display, in Settle's tragic opera <span class="italic">The Virgin Prophetess, or, The Fate of Troy</span>, a play set during the siege of Troy, which centred on the figure of Cassandra, and maximized its location with a series of spectacular scenes involving prospects of Troy in flames, and Helen leaping into the fire from the top of a turret. Following this opera Settle produced <span class="italic">The City-Ramble, or, A Play-House Wedding</span> in 1711, a comedy in blank verse and prose, which combined elements of two plays by Beaumont and Fletcher, <span class="italic">The Knight of the Burning Pestle</span> and <span class="italic">The Coxcomb</span>. However, he seems to have abandoned operatic drama until 1718, when he produced <span class="italic">The Lady's Triumph</span>, a domestic comedy centring on an intrigue between the young bride of an old alderman and her suitor.<br>
<br>At the same time as writing these works for the stage, in 1691 Settle took up a position as city poet, following the death of the previous incumbent, Matthew Taubman. His role in this capacity was to devise the annual pageants for the lord mayor's show, a task for which he was well qualified both through his experience in producing spectacular effects in the theatre, and in co-ordinating the pope-burning pageants of the exclusion crisis. It is uncertain for how long he held the post: he produced pageants in 1691&#150;5, 1698&#150;1702, and 1708, and though he wrote no pageants after 1708, he continued to be referred to as &#145;city poet&#146; by contemporaries. He was also involved in the popular entertainments at Bartholomew fair. Printed attacks on Settle from 1683 onwards had associated him with the fair, but his first recorded presentation for the venue was <span class="italic">The Siege of Troy</span>, an adaptation of his earlier play <span class="italic">The Virgin Prophetess</span> (1701). It was performed at Bartholomew fair in 1707 and at Southwark fair in 1715 and 1716, and the preface to later editions of the play asserts that Settle was employed by the show-woman Mrs Mynn during this time. He is also said to have acted at Mrs Mynn's booth at Bartholomew fair, reputedly dressing up in a costume of green leather to play the dragon in a droll entitled &#145;St George for England&#146;, a performance which earned him the mockery of many of his adversaries.<br>
<br>In addition to these popular spectacles, from 1699 up until the time of his death, Settle produced an increasing number of commendatory poems. Most of them were written in rhymed heroic verse, and some reworked similar lines for a range of occasions. Many of the poems were funeral and marriage tributes, while others addressed contemporary affairs of state. Settle's verse was directed to both ends of the political spectrum, and his choice of subject matter does not seem to have been governed by any particular political allegiance. Thus under Anne's reign he both celebrated the future Hanoverian succession in <span class="italic">Eusebia triumphans</span> (1702), and then in 1706 contributed to the tory outpouring on the Anglican &#145;Church in danger&#146; campaign with a poem entitled <span class="italic">Fears and Dangers, Fairly Display'd</span>.<br>
<br>In 1718 Settle entered the Charterhouse, where he continued to write panegyrics, and is also said to have been working on a tragedy entitled &#145;The Expulsion of the Danes&#146;. However, the play, which has now been lost, did not appear on the stage, owing to its author's death, at the Charterhouse, on 12 February 1724. The whereabouts of Settle's will and place of burial are not known. The notice of his death, which appeared in the <span class="italic">True Briton</span> on 19 February 1724, describes the poet's appearance as a man &#145;of tall stature, red face, short black hair&#146;.<h2>
<a name="Reputation"></a>Reputation</h2>Elkanah Settle's literary reputation has been dominated by his contemporary opponents' attacks on him. In the second part of <span class="italic">Absalom and Achitophel</span> (1682) Dryden described his writing as:<blockquote>
<div>free from all meaning, whether good or bad,<br>
</div>
<div>And, in one word, heroically mad.<br>
</div> (ll. 416&#150;17)</blockquote>while in Alexander Pope's <span class="italic">Dunciad</span> he is satirized for his changes of political allegiance and for his performance in costume at Bartholomew fair, &#145;reduc'd at last to hiss in my own dragon&#146;  (A. Pope, <span class="italic">The Dunciad</span>, 1743, 3.286). Yet although these writers have presented an influential image of the writer as a talentless hack, it is clear that much of Settle's drama was very popular in its own time, as the quarrel with Dryden over the success of <span class="italic">The Empress of Morocco</span> reveals. Settle was undoubtedly a central figure in the Restoration theatre, his talent for producing spectacular and elaborately staged plays being particularly well suited to the contemporary vogue for heroic and operatic drama.<br>
