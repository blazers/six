<span class="headword">Taylor,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1711, <em>d.</em> 1788), <span class="occ">friend of Samuel Johnson</span>, baptized at Ashbourne, Derbyshire, on 18 March 1711, was the son of Thomas Taylor (1671&#150;1730?) of Ashbourne and his wife, Mary, daughter of Thomas Wood. He was educated with Samuel Johnson by the Revd John Hunter at Lichfield grammar school, and he and Edmund Hector were the last survivors of Johnson's schoolfriends. Taylor would have followed Johnson to Pembroke College, but was dissuaded by his friend's report of the ignorance of William Jorden, the tutor, and on the same advice matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, on 10 March 1729, with a view to studying the law and becoming an attorney. He left without taking a degree, and apparently for some years practised as an attorney. On 9 April 1732 he married at Croxall, Derbyshire, Elizabeth, daughter of William Webb of that parish. She was buried at Ashbourne on 13 January 1746. His second wife was Mary, daughter of Roger Tuckfield of Fulford, Devon. They were not happy, and in August 1763 she left him.<br>
<br>At some time after 1736 Taylor was ordained in the Church of England, and in July 1740 he was presented, on the nomination of the family of Dixie, and, as it is believed, by purchase from them, to the valuable rectory of Market Bosworth in Leicestershire. This preferment he retained until death, although he was unpopular with his parishioners. As a whig in politics and a political power in Derbyshire, Taylor was made chaplain to the duke of Devonshire, lord lieutenant of Ireland from 1737 to 1745. He returned to Oxford and graduated BA and MA in 1742. In 1752, as a grand-compounder, he proceeded LLB and LLD.<br>
<br>On 11 July 1746 Taylor obtained, no doubt through the influence of the duke of Devonshire, a prebendal stall at Westminster, which he retained for life. By the appointment of the chapter he held in succession a series of preferments, all of which were tenable with his stall and with his living of Market Bosworth. These were the post of minister of the chapel in the Broadway, Westminster (1748); the perpetual curacy of St Botolph, Aldersgate (1769); and the place of minister of St Margaret's, Westminster, which he held from April 1784 to his death. Johnson remarked of this position: &#145;It is of no great value, and its income consists much of voluntary contributions&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Samuel Johnson</span>, 2.397). Although Taylor was possessed of large resources, both official and private&#151;amounting in all, so it was rumoured, to &pound;7000 per annum&#151;and never voluntarily paid a debt, he always hankered after better preferments.<br>
<br>Taylor spent much time at his family residence at Ashbourne. He became JP for Derbyshire on 6 October 1761, and thenceforth was known as &#145;the King of Ashbourne&#146;. Through life he maintained his friendship with Johnson. Johnson was at Ashbourne in 1737 and 1740, and in the thirteen years from 1767 to 1779 only thrice failed to visit Taylor. He acted in 1749 as mediator in the quarrel of Garrick and Johnson over the play <span class="italic">Irene</span>. He read the service at Johnson's funeral.<br>
<br>Johnson said of Taylor that he was &#145;a very sensible, acute man&#146;, that he had &#145;a strong mind&#146;, and that &#145;he had great activity in some respects, and yet such a sort of indolence, that if you should put a pebble upon his chimney-piece, you would find it there, in the same state, a year afterwards&#146;  (Boswell, 827). Boswell and Johnson arrived at Ashbourne on 26 March 1776, driving from Lichfield in Taylor's &#145;large roomy postchaise, drawn by four stout plump horses, and driven by two steady jolly postilions&#146;. The house and establishment accorded with this description, and their host's &#145;size and figure and countenance and manner were that of a hearty English squire, with the parson superinduced&#146;  (Boswell, 716). Boswell thought that Taylor &#145;praised everything of his own to great excess&#146;  (Boswell, 867) and wondered how Johnson and Taylor could be friends. Joshua Reynolds had speculated that Johnson was to be Taylor's heir. However, Johnson had said of Taylor:<blockquote>I love him; but I do not love him more; my regard for him does not increase. As it is said in the <span class="roman">Apocrypha</span>, &#145;his talk is of bullocks&#146;: I do not suppose he is very fond of my company. His habits are by no means sufficiently clerical: this he knows that I see; and no man likes to live under the eye of perpetual disapprobation. (Boswell, 861)</blockquote>Taylor died at Ashbourne on 29 February 1788, and was buried in Ashbourne church, tradition says in the nave, on 3 March. He had no surviving child and disappointed his nieces by leaving all his property&#151;&pound;1200 a year besides personalty&#151;to a boy, William Brunt (<i>b</i>. 1772), who had been engaged as a page. It was stipulated that the legatee should take the name of Webster, which had long been connected with this family of Taylor.<br>
<br>Taylor published in 1787 <span class="italic">A Letter to Samuel Johnson, LL.D., on the Subject of a Future State</span>, which was inscribed to the duke of Devonshire, at whose command it was issued. It is said to have been drawn up at Johnson's request, and with reference to his remark that &#145;he would prefer a state of torment to that of annihilation&#146;. Appended to it were three letters by Dr Johnson. After Taylor's death there came out&#151;volume 1 in 1788, and volume 2 in 1789&#151;<span class="italic">Sermons on Different Subjects, Left for Publication by John Taylor, LL.D.</span>, which were edited by the Revd Samuel Hayes. They were often reprinted, and are believed to have been in the main the composition of Johnson, in whose &#145;Prayers and meditations&#146; is the entry, on 21 September 1777, &#145;Concio pro Tayloro&#146; (&#145;A sermon for Taylor&#146;). Boswell wrote down in Taylor's presence, and incorporated in the <span class="italic">Life</span>, &#145;a good deal of what he could tell&#146; about Johnson. Many letters from Johnson to him were printed in <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span> (6th ser., 5.303&#150;482). Three of them were known to Boswell, and about twelve were printed by Sir John Simeon, their owner in 1861, for the Philobiblon Society. These communications, with others, are included in Hill's edition of Johnson's letters. Further letters are in the same editor's <span class="italic">Johnsonian Miscellanies</span> (2.447, 452).<br>
