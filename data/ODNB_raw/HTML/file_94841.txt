<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Maxwell, Sir  (William) George</span>  (1871&#150;1959), <span class="occ">colonial administrator</span>, was born on 9 June 1871, probably at Malacca, the eldest of six sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18415/', "Sir William Edward Maxwell (1846&#150;1897)")</script>, colonial governor, and his wife, Lillias Grant, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Aberigh-Mackay (1846&#150;1925), daughter of James Aberigh-Mackay, colonial chaplain. At the age of eleven he was awarded the medal of the Royal Humane Society for a rescue from drowning in Guernsey harbour. He was educated at Clifton College, Bristol (1885&#150;90), where he was a scholar.<br>
<br>In 1891 Maxwell was appointed to the civil service of the Malay state of Perak, of which Frank Swettenham was then resident. For the next decade he held district posts in Perak and Pahang, before transferring to the civil service of the Straits Settlements, where he held the appointment of solicitor-general and acted as attorney-general. His first book, <span class="italic">In Malay Forests</span> (1907), described his experiences in Perak and Pahang, more especially in hunting big game, and displayed the deep knowledge of and sympathy with the Malays which was evident throughout his Malayan career. Part-time legal study while on leave and magistrates' posts in Malaya prepared him for a call to the bar (by the Inner Temple in 1906), like his father and grandfather before him (both of whom had also served in Malaya). On 23 August 1902 he had married (Florence) Evelyn Stevenson (1875/6&#150;1957), daughter of Walter Ferguson Stevenson, merchant; they had two sons.<br>
<br>In 1909 four northern Malay states were transferred from Siamese to British suzerainty, and Maxwell was appointed the first British adviser to the ruler of Kedah. The latter had begun to model its government, to a limited extent, on those of the Malay colonies, but it was beset by financial problems, differences within its ruling oligarchy, and the mental illness of its ruler. In the state council, the key institution, Maxwell dealt with Malay notables who were quite as obstinate as he, and resentful of British intervention. However, he was able to establish the system of registered land title that his father had introduced to Malaya twenty years before, and to bring about the abolition of debt-bondage. His first annual report (in 1909) was a very informative account of the traditional structure of political authority in Kedah. He remained British adviser to the ruler of Kedah until 1915, the year in which he was appointed CMG.<br>
<br>In the sequence of senior administrative posts in the Malay states and the Straits Settlements that Maxwell filled for short periods between 1915 and 1920, he showed that he was the ablest Malayan administrator of his generation, leading to his appointment in the latter year as chief secretary (administrative head) of the Federated Malay States. The post-war financial crisis of 1921 obliged him to impose drastic retrenchment of public expenditure. The resident of one state saw his new building programme cut by 90 per cent. Maxwell's was a skilful and resolute performance but one that made him no friends among his senior colleagues. However, the greatest controversy of the time was the proposal to &#145;decentralize&#146; the Federated Malay States government by returning to the state governments powers that the federal centre had absorbed over a quarter of a century and vested in the chief secretary. Maxwell conceded the principle but demurred at its immediate implementation, and, with the support of powerful commercial interests, he resisted the efforts of Sir Laurence Guillemard, the high commissioner, to replace the post of chief secretary at the centre with a less omnipotent bureaucrat. The dispute over policy between the two men degenerated into a bitter and public personal feud, damaging to both. Maxwell's merits were recognized by a knighthood (KBE) in 1924, but he had to retire (at the normal age) in 1926. Guillemard soon followed, having achieved little.<br>
<br>In retirement Maxwell was one of a group of retired Malayan administrators who used the Association of British Malaya as their base in strong criticism of the policies of the Colonial Office and of their successors. Maxwell contributed a number of articles to <span class="italic">British Malaya</span> and other journals, and also found time to serve as vice-chairman (1932&#150;9) of the League of Nations committee on slavery. When the fall of Malaya to the Japanese in 1942 brought much criticism of the local government, Maxwell was chairman of a committee that published <span class="italic">The Civil Defence of Malaya</span> (1944) in attempted vindication of it; he knew more about the system than anyone else in Britain at the time. After the war the same group of veterans, with Maxwell generally a moderating influence on their counsels, campaigned against the first attempt at post-war reconstruction, the over-centralized Malayan Union of 1946. Its successor, the Federation of Malaya, accorded with his ideas, but by the time it replaced the Malayan Union in 1948 he was a spent force, and absorbed in the care of his invalid wife, who died in 1957.<br>
<br>A contemporary wrote that Maxwell's &#145;singular ability&#146; was combined with &#145;extraordinary driving force [and], untiring energy&#146;, adding that he &#145;loves his work [but] has his faults&#146;  (Robson, 150). Compromise was not in the Maxwell genes, a fact that almost certainly prevented his rise further up the colonial hierarchy. He died of heart failure on 22 August 1959 at Southlands Hospital, Shoreham, Sussex, near his home in High Salvington, Worthing. He was survived by his two sons.<br>
