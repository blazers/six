<span class="headword">Stradling, Sir  Henry</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1649?), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26628/', "Sir John Stradling, first baronet (1563&#150;1637)")</script>, of St Donats, Glamorgan, MP and poet, and his wife, Elizabeth Gage, daughter of Edward Gage of Firle, Sussex. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26625/', "Sir Edward Stradling, second baronet")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26626/', "George Stradling")</script> were his brothers. In 1628 he sailed to the Mediterranean as captain of the <i>George and Elizabeth</i> in Sir Kenelm Digby's privateering expedition. In 1631 he was appointed captain of the <i>First Whelp</i>, a sixth rate, and in the following year held command of the <i>Tenth Whelp</i>. He was one of a new breed of gentlemen commanders trained up in royal service, and shared their dislike of merchant captains, of whom he once remarked &#145;They hate all gentlemen, especially such as serve his Majesty at sea&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1631&#150;3</i>, 413). He continued commanding whelps until the setting out of the first ship money fleet in 1635 in which he commanded the third-rate <i>Swallow</i>. In 1636 Sir John Penington praised him as a captain &#145;who cannot be bettered in a ship of that rank&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1635&#150;6</i>, 277). When war threatened with Spain in 1637 he was given the second-rate <i>Dreadnought</i> in Northumberland's fleet and in late 1637 was selected to bring the duchess of Chevreuse to England, despite his limited knowledge of French. As the likelihood of war with Spain receded he reverted to command of the third-rate <i>Bonaventure</i> in 1638. The main functions of the ship money fleets of the 1630s, in which he served, were to protect commerce from Turkish pirates and Dunkirk privateers and to force other nations to acknowledge England's sovereignty over the seas by striking their flags. In 1639 Stradling temporarily left the sea, serving in an army company during the first bishops' war, but in the following year he was back at sea in command of the <i>Antelope</i>. During the second bishops' war he cruised off the east coast of Scotland picking up many prizes. In the summer fleet of 1641 he commanded the <i>Lion</i>.<br>
<br>When the Irish rising broke out in 1641 Stradling was appointed to the <i>Bonaventure</i>, one of four ships under Captain Thomas Kettleby to be sent to help suppress it. He reached Kinsale on 6 March 1642; in June he was cruising off the Shannon and in early August he was assisting the defence of Duncannon. Stradling was a convinced royalist. His appointment to the <i>Bonaventure</i> had been confirmed by the Commons by only the narrow margin of eighty-six to seventy-seven. When active fighting began in England both he, who had been knighted in 1642, and Kettleby obeyed the king's instruction to abandon their station and proceed to Newcastle. Exactly when Stradling left Ireland is not clear but it is unlikely that a later modification ordering him to report to the queen in the United Provinces reached him in time. Both he and Kettleby reached the Tyne successfully but when a squadron of six parliamentary ships appeared under the vice-admiral, William Batten, the crews of the <i>Bonaventure</i> and the <i>Swallow</i> rebelled and Stradling was forced to flee in the ship's longboat.<br>
<br>Though Stradling was said to have gone to Ireland, later events suggest that he served in Newcastle's army during 1643 under Sir Thomas Glemham, and that he was among the garrison of York that marched out with him a fortnight after Marston Moor. This would account for his reappearance at Carlisle in July 1644 where Glemham had become governor. The town endured a long siege and did not surrender until 26 June 1645. Glemham and Stradling, with about 200 foot, were allowed to march out. They joined the king at Cardiff a month later and, converted into dragoons, fought in the defeat at Rowton Heath on 24 September where Stradling was taken prisoner. He was later released and made his way to Oxford, where he was forced to surrender again when the city finally capitulated on 24 June 1646. On 10 December 1646 he begged to be allowed to compound for his delinquency, but no order was made. In June 1647 Stradling, his brother Thomas, and his nephew John, the major-general, took part in an abortive rising among the Glamorgan gentry, and they also joined Poyer's revolt in south Wales in 1648. Henry and Thomas were with Poyer in Pembroke Castle when it was taken by Cromwell on 11 July 1648.<br>
<br>The articles of surrender forced the Stradling brothers to quit the kingdom within six weeks. Henry went to the United Provinces and when Prince Rupert took over the royalist fleet in November 1648 he was given command of the <i>Roebuck</i>. In February 1649 Rupert sailed from Goree and for most of the summer was based at Kinsale. Stradling does not appear to have gone with Rupert to Portugal and may never have left Ireland. He is said to have died at Cork in 1649 and to have been buried there in Trinity Church.<br>
