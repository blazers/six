<span class="headword">Morow <span class="st"> [Morvo]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1430), <span class="occ">master mason</span>, was of French origin, but came to work in Scotland. Practically all that is known of his life is derived from an inscribed panel he inserted in the south aisle of the Cistercian abbey of Melrose, which records that he was born in Paris, and had been in charge of masonwork at St Andrews, Glasgow, Paisley, Nithsdale (this may refer to Lincluden), and Galloway (possibly Whithorn). His contribution to Melrose is probably identifiable in a number of windows inserted into the presbytery, the south transept, and the first of the chapels along the south nave flank. It thus fits between the start of rebuilding the abbey church after its destruction by Richard II of England in 1385 and the completion of the south transept and continuation of work into the nave by Abbot Andrew Hunter (who was in office from 1444 to some date between about 1465 and 1471).<br>
<br>Morow's work at some of the other churches listed on the panel may be identified through the use of an identical tracery type in the east bays of the north nave aisle at Paisley Abbey and in the choir of Lincluden collegiate church. The former can be approximately dated as being between operations supported by Robert II in 1389 and Abbot John Lithgow's selection of his burial place (apparently in the vicinity of the north porch) in 1434. Lincluden was founded about 1389, but much of the building is of the period between 1406, when correspondence with the pope refers to it as unfinished, and about 1451, when Princess Margaret, countess of Douglas and duchess of Touraine, whose tomb is a prominent feature of the choir, died. The tracery in these buildings is marked by a sensitive balance of restrained flowing forms with &#145;spherical&#146; figures, which has few parallels in Scotland, but is reflected in several French buildings. The mouldings associated with the windows at Melrose, Paisley, and Lincluden are also closely similar to one another.<br>
<br>A further pointer to Morow's contribution may be the use of corbels with crouching biblical figures holding a scroll. This motif, common in continental Europe, is found in Scotland only at Melrose and Lincluden, and in two displaced fragments which are thought to come from the demolished south-western tower at Glasgow Cathedral; they are thus all at churches included on Morow's list. Of the other churches listed at Melrose, it might be argued there is some degree of French inspiration in the fragmentary remains of the nave of St Andrew Cathedral as rebuilt after the fire of 1378, when the bishop was Walter Trail (<i>d</i>. 1401), a graduate of Paris and Orl&eacute;ans. This is best seen in the stilted-arched west windows and in the way the sub-bases of the arcade piers are elongated towards the main space, presumably to support full-height wall shafts on this side. However, there is nothing that could be associated specifically with Morow from what is known of his work elsewhere, and it may be that any French-inspired elements at St Andrews were the contribution of his colleagues.<br>
<br>Morow's work represents a highly significant contribution to Scottish architectural thought at a time when there was a resurgence of ecclesiastical building activity after the long wars with England, and English influences were being increasingly rejected in favour of a synthesis in which continental European inspiration played an important part.<br>
