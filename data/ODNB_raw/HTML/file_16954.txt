<span class="headword">Lombart,  Pierre</span>  (1612/13&#150;1682), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was born and trained in France. At his death his age was given as sixty-nine, which places his birth in 1612 or 1613; Pierre-Jean Mariette, writing in the eighteenth century, says he was a Parisian. Nothing is known of his early career in France, though later writers variously thought that he was a pupil of G&eacute;rard Edelinck or Fran&ccedil;ois Poilly. A few signed plates may date from this period of his life. The first trace of him in London is in 1651, when he engraved the title-page to Jeremy Taylor's <span class="italic">The Rule and Exercises of Holy Dying</span>. Signed and dated plates, often with the words &#145;&agrave; Londres&#146; added, continue through the 1650s, but Lombart was certainly back in Paris in 1663, when he engraved a dated portrait of Antoine Grammont after Wallerant Vaillant.<br>
<br>During the 1650s Lombart was the finest engraver working in England, and the principal competitor to William Faithorne. He made his name with two great portraits of Oliver Cromwell. The earlier, which can be dated between 1651 and 1653, shows him with a page and is after a painting by Robert Walker. The later, a full-length of Cromwell on horseback, followed in 1655. The portraits were dedicated by Lombart himself respectively to parliament and to the council of the Commonwealth. The 1655 print went through an unusual number of transformations through the years. G. S. Layard, who devoted a monograph to his researches into its history, identified seven states: the first shows Cromwell's head; in the second there is no head; in the third and fourth the head becomes that of Louis XIV; in the fifth it is Cromwell; in the sixth it is Charles I; and in the seventh it returns to Cromwell again. The plate survives in a private collection.<br>
<br>The principal achievement of Lombart's London years was a series of twelve portraits after paintings by Anthony Van Dyck, usually known as <span class="italic">The Countesses</span> because ten of them show ladies with the Latin title of comitissa. These bear a royal privilege, and so must have been made after the Restoration; however, they were published after Lombart's return to Paris, for each bears a French publication line as well. They are the prototype for the later series of full-length engravings after Van Dyck by Pieter Van Gunst and James McArdell, and perhaps inspired the set of <span class="italic">Beauties</span> by Kneller now at Hampton Court.<br>
<br>Lombart also worked extensively on the publications of John Ogilby, engraving most of the plates for his 1654 <span class="italic">Virgil</span> after Francis Clein. A few of the others were engraved by L. Richer, after whose designs Lombart engraved a set of <span class="italic">The Liberal Arts</span>. Richer is recorded in John Evelyn's <span class="italic">Diary</span> for 25 March 1653 as a &#145;rare graver in tallie douce &hellip; sent over by Card. Mazzarini to make collections of pictures&#146;  (Evelyn, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 3.82), and it is possible that Lombart too travelled to London partly to profit from the dispersal of the royalist collections of paintings. After his return to Paris, Lombart was received into the Acad&eacute;mie Royale de Peinture, but he never became a full member. He specialized in portraits, of which it seems that few, if any, can be dated later than the beginning of the 1670s. He died in Paris on 30 October 1682. His career still awaits a full study.<br>
