<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stonehouse,  John Thomson</span>  (1925&#150;1988), <span class="occ">politician and confidence trickster</span>, was born on 28 July 1925 in Southampton, the youngest of four children and second son of William Mitchell Stonehouse, Post Office engineer and later dockyard engine-fitter, and his wife, Rosina Marie, formerly a scullery maid in Cowes, Isle of Wight, daughter of Henry George Taylor, boilermaker. The family was active in the local labour movement, the father becoming a trade union official and the mother being an alderman (1936&#150;70) and later mayor (1959) of Southampton. Stonehouse was educated at Tauntons School, Southampton, which he left at the age of sixteen to work in the Southampton probation department as a clerk and typist (1941&#150;4). In 1944 he joined the Royal Air Force, training as a pilot in the USA. From 1947 to 1951 he studied at the London School of Economics, where he obtained a BSc (Econ) degree in 1951.<br>
<br>In the early 1950s Stonehouse gained experience by working in the co-operative movement both at home and abroad. In 1952 he established valuable African credentials by taking his wife and young family to Uganda, where they stayed until 1954, while he helped to organize the co-operative movement among the African population. Some of his contemporaries said that his work in Uganda was not as pioneering as he subsequently claimed. Nevertheless, it gave him powerful authority in the political debate about decolonization, which was gathering strength in Britain and Africa. Stonehouse was certainly not out of step with his own party's developing policy on Africa.<br>
<br>In February 1957, at a by-election, Stonehouse entered parliament as Labour co-operative member for Wednesbury, whose MP he remained until 1974. In March 1959 he was declared <i>persona non grata</i> by the government of the federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. The cause of this heavy-handed treatment was a speech to an African audience in which he had urged the black people of Rhodesia to &#145;lift your heads high and behave as though the country belongs to you&#146;. However, spats with minority regimes in Africa did no harm to Stonehouse's reputation as a coming man. He wrote a book about his experiences, <span class="italic">Prohibited Immigrant</span> (1960).<br>
<br>Stonehouse also established a reputation on the domestic front when he became a director of the London Co-operative Society (1956&#150;62, president 1962&#150;4). The society was one of the jewels in the crown of the co-operative movement and Stonehouse's role kept him in the public eye as a tough, if not always popular, political infighter and administrator. It was no surprise that Harold Wilson sent him to the Ministry of Aviation as parliamentary under-secretary when Labour returned to power in October 1964. He held several subsequent posts in the 1964&#150;70 Labour government: parliamentary under-secretary of state for the colonies (1966&#150;7), minister of aviation (1967), minister of state for technology (1967&#150;8), postmaster-general (1968&#150;9), and minister of post and telecommunications (1969&#150;70). However, he never made the cabinet and was dropped from the government shortly before Labour lost office in 1970.<br>
<br>In the early 1970s Stonehouse turned his energies to a variety of fund-raising and money-making activities, many associated with the new country of Bangladesh. He created a lattice-work of companies, in which he manipulated funds to conceal mismanagement and fraud. On 21 November 1974 he went missing, presumed dead, while supposedly swimming in the sea off Miami. Five weeks later he was discovered in Australia by Australian police, who thought he might be the missing Lord Lucan. The Stonehouse story then took on aspects of cheap fiction rather than real life. He had obtained two passports in the names of husbands of widows in his constituency. A beautiful mistress, his House of Commons secretary, Sheila Buckley, was identified as having conspired with him to fake the disappearance to enable them both to start a new life together in Australia with money salted away from the Stonehouse companies. At his trial the Stonehouse defences ranged from international conspiracy to mental breakdown. That he had not lived up to high expectations, his own and those of others, had caused him to retreat into a world of deceit and fraud. In 1976 he resigned his privy councillorship, to which he had been appointed in 1968, and applied for the Chiltern Hundreds, thus ceasing to be an MP (he had represented Walsall North from 1974).<br>
<br>His behaviour would have condemned most men to oblivion, but Stonehouse did not shun the public eye. He served three and a half years in prison and was released in 1979, when, after a brief period of charity work, he turned his hand to writing. Between 1982 and 1987 he had three novels published: <span class="italic">Ralph</span> (1982), <span class="italic">The Baring Fault</span> (1986), and <span class="italic">Oil on the Rift</span> (1987). A posthumous publication, in 1989, was <span class="italic">Who Sold Australia?</span> Earlier he had written an autobiography, <span class="italic">Death of an Idealist</span> (1975). Three years before his death he started a company which manufactured electronic safes.<br>
<br>Stonehouse was tall, handsome, and charming. In 1948 he married Barbara Joan, stenographer, daughter of Robert Charles Smith, insurance agent; they had one son and two daughters. The marriage was dissolved in 1978 and in 1981 he married Sheila Elizabeth Buckley, daughter of Leslie William Black, master butcher; her previous marriage had ended in divorce. They had one son. Stonehouse, who had suffered a series of heart attacks and undergone heart surgery during his prison term, collapsed during the night of 15 April 1988 at his home in Totton, near Southampton, and was dead on arrival at Southampton General Hospital.<br>
