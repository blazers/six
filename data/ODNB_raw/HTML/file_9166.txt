<span class="headword">Farmer,  George</span>  (1732&#150;1779), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, born at Youghal, co. Cork, in 1732, was the son of John Farmer, of a Northamptonshire family settled at Youghal, a collateral branch of the Fermors, the earls of Pomfret, extinct in 1867. He went to sea at an early age in the merchant service, and later, after entering the navy, served as a midshipman of the <i>Dreadnought</i> with Captain Maurice Suckling in the West Indies, and in the <i>Achilles</i> on the home station with the Hon. Samuel Barrington. On 23 May 1759 he was promoted lieutenant of the frigate <i>Aurora</i>, in which he served until January 1761 on the home station. He was then placed on half pay, and settled for a time in Norwich, where he had been previously employed on the impress service. Here he married Rebecca, daughter of Captain William Fleming, another naval officer: the couple had nine children. In 1766 he is said to have given valuable assistance in suppressing a riot there, and to have been promoted commander on 26 May 1768, in consequence of the representations of the local magistrates.<br>
<br>Farmer had, however, no further active employment until September 1769, when he was appointed to the sloop <i>Swift</i>. In her he went out to the Falkland Islands, where, on his arrival in the following March, he found that the Spaniards, having established themselves at Puerto Solidad, had sent to Port Egmont, peremptorily ordering the British to quit the settlement. As there was no British force to resist any aggression, the senior officer, Commander Anthony Hunt, determined to go to England with the news, leaving Farmer in command. A few days later the <i>Swift</i> sailed for a cruise round the islands; in a violent gale she was blown over to the coast of Patagonia, and in attempting to go into Port Desire she struck a rock, and was utterly lost. The crew escaped to the shore, but as they were entirely destitute Farmer dispatched the cutter to Port Egmont with orders to the only remaining ship, the <i>Favourite</i>, to come to their relief. On 16 April they arrived safely at Port Egmont. On 4 June a Spanish frigate anchored in the harbour; she was presently followed by four others, and the commandant, Don Juan Ignacio Madariaga, wrote to Farmer that, having with him 1600 troops and a train of artillery, he was in a position to compel the British to quit, if they hesitated any longer. Farmer replied that he should defend himself to the best of his power; but resistance against such an overwhelming force could be nothing more than complimentary, and accordingly when the Spaniards landed, Farmer, after firing his guns, capitulated on terms, an inventory of the stores being taken, and the British permitted to return to their own country in the <i>Favourite</i>. After arriving in September 1770 Farmer, on being acquitted of all blame for the loss of the <i>Swift</i>, was appointed to the sloop <i>Tamar</i>, and on 10 January 1771 he was promoted to post rank.<br>
<br>In August 1773 Farmer was appointed to the frigate <i>Seahorse</i>, and sailed for the East Indies, having among his petty officers Thomas Troubridge, a master's mate, and Horatio Nelson, a midshipman. On returning to England after an uneventful commission, Farmer was appointed in March 1778 to the frigate <i>Quebec</i> (32 guns), in which he was employed during the year in convoy service in the North Sea. In 1779 he was stationed chiefly at Guernsey as a guard for the Channel Islands, and to gain intelligence. As early as 18 June he sent news that the French fleet had sailed from Brest, that the Spanish fleet had sailed from Cadiz, and that there were at Le Havre great preparations for an invading force. On 6 July he wrote that he had driven on shore and destroyed a convoy of forty-nine small vessels, with a 20-gun frigate and several armed vessels; but that the <i>Quebec</i> herself had struck heavily on the rocks, and he had been obliged to throw his guns overboard. This necessitated his going to Portsmouth for repairs, and when these were finished, as there were no 12-pounders to replace the lost guns, he had to be supplied with 9-pounders, which were taken from another frigate not ready for sea. With this reduced armament, off Ushant, on 6 October, the <i>Quebec</i> met the French 18-pounder frigate <i>Surveillante</i> (40 guns) and nearly double the number of men. A sharp action ensued. After about three and a half hours both ships were dismasted. As the <i>Quebec</i>'s sails fell the guns caught fire, and the frigate was speedily in a blaze. There was little wind and a great swell; the <i>Surveillante</i>, completely disabled, was at some little distance; the cutter <i>Rambler</i> was to leeward, and also dismasted; and the French cutter <i>Exp&eacute;dition</i>, which had been engaged with the <i>Rambler</i>, had sought safety in flight. It was thus impossible to help the burning frigate, which after some four or five hours blew up. Only sixty-six out of about 195 men on board were picked up by the boats of the <i>Surveillante</i>, the <i>Rambler</i>, and a Russian vessel that came on the scene; the rest, including Captain Farmer, perished. Farmer had been previously wounded, and his conduct both in the action and during the fire was so highly spoken of that, at the special request of the Board of Admiralty, a baronetcy was conferred (19 January 1780) on his eldest son, George William Farmer (<i>d</i>. 1814), an annual pension of &pound;200 to his widow, and &pound;25 a year to each of his eight children, and a ninth not yet born. In so doing the Admiralty board hoped to encourage others to emulate Farmer's &#145;stubborn gallantry&#146; by signalling that their actions would be commemorated were they to die in action. Farmer's death also gave the Admiralty reason to use the loss of the <i>Quebec</i> for political purposes in the service. As Lord Sandwich, first lord of the Admiralty, was advised, &#145;officers must be taught to lose the idea of danger in that of glory. Great actions must dazzle as well as burn&#146;. Moreover, &#145;If this action is properly set forth it will do more Credit to our Arms in Europe and give more Spirit and Enthusiasm to our young officers than a great victory attended with no shocking Circumstance&#146;. Another consideration was doing honour to Sandwich himself, &#145;no trifling object&#146; given the current temper of the fleet  (Mulgrave to Sandwich, 13 Oct 1779, Mulgrave Castle MSS, box vi, 1/441).<br>
