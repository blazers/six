<span class="headword">Kennaway, Sir  John</span>, first baronet  (1758&#150;1836), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company and diplomatist</span>, was born on 6 March 1758 in Exeter, the third of six children of William Kennaway (1717&#150;1793), woollen merchant, and his wife, Frances (1722&#150;1788), the daughter of Aaron Tozer. In 1772, after leaving Exeter grammar school, Kennaway obtained the patronage of a near relation of his mother, Robert Palk, former governor of Madras. Having entered the service of the East India Company as a military cadet, Kennaway sailed for India before his fourteenth birthday. On the approach to Calcutta he was shipwrecked and lost all his possessions. His early years in India were marred by ill health and slow career advancement. Only at the insistence of a family friend at Madras did Kennaway stay in India. Of scholarly inclinations, he learned Persian and wrote commentaries on late Roman poetry. A devout Anglican, he also compiled prayers, a habit he followed through the better part of his life. In a letter to his eldest brother, William, on 17 March 1780 Kennaway wrote: &#145;I am ambitious of acting upon a large scale&#146; and expressed a &#145;hope to spend the summer of my life in affluence with my friends&#146;  (Devon RO, M961 Add. S/F39).<br>
<br>In 1781 opportunity to &#145;act upon a large scale&#146; presented itself when Kennaway's brigade marched 1700 kilometres from Bengal to the Carnatic to serve in the Second Anglo-Mysore War. He saw action at Cuddalore and made captain's rank in 1783, and his linguistic skills were recognized when he became the brigade's Persian translator. With peace restored in 1784, he briefly returned to Bengal before being sent in 1785 to the Oudh residency as translator. His knowledge of Persian and Indian courtly etiquette was further acknowledged a year later when he was appointed to attend Haidar Beg Khan, Oudh's chief minister, on an embassy from Lucknow to Calcutta to meet the governor-general, Cornwallis, who, impressed with Kennaway, made him his aide-de-camp.<br>
<br>Cornwallis continued to promote Kennaway. In April 1788 he was appointed temporary resident to the court of the nizam of Hyderabad, a lucrative but delicate post charged with obtaining the peaceful cession of the Guntur Circar. The nizam had, in 1768, promised to cede the area&#151;a strategic coastal region between Bengal and Madras&#151;to the company upon the death of his brother in return for military assistance and annual cash payments. When the nizam's brother died in 1782 and neither party enforced the lapsed treaty, in 1786 the London authorities ordered Cornwallis to acquire Guntur Circar in return for annual rent. Kennaway fulfilled his task, and in September 1788 British forces occupied the area. In 1789 Kennaway's recall from Hyderabad was pre-empted when Tipu Sultan of Mysore attacked Travancore, a company ally, and Kennaway was instructed to negotiate the nizam's participation in a coalition.<br>
<br>By the treaty of Pangal, Kennaway obtained the nizam's co-operation and was awarded a baronetcy on 25 February 1791. In 1792, with the allies encamped before the walls of Mysore's capital, Cornwallis bid him to negotiate peace. By the treaty of Seringapatam, Mysore ceded half its territory to the allies, more than 3 crores of rupees (approximately &pound;3 million) and Tipu Sultan gave two of his sons as hostages against Mysore's default. Kennaway, who enjoyed conducting affairs in Persian, ascribed his success as a diplomat, in a letter to Colonel Harper of 3 May 1787, to an ability to maintain &#145;an appearance of indifference and total unconcern&#146;  (Devon RO, M961 F/2, fol. 114). After negotiating before Seringapatam, Kennaway fell ill and took a leave of absence from his duties as resident. Balding, grey, and commonly thought to be a decade older than he was, Kennaway knew his career was taking a physical toll. None the less his lingering idea of returning to England became a conviction only after learning of his father's death, and in 1794 he left India.<br>
<br>A thrifty man who regularly remitted funds to England, Kennaway fulfilled his youthful hope and lived out his life in congenial affluence. He purchased Escot House, at Ottery St Mary, near Exeter, for &pound;26,000 and became a respected member of the Devon gentry. In 1797 he married Charlotte (1768&#150;1845), daughter of Charles Amyatt, nabob and MP. The couple had seven sons and five daughters, of whom nine survived childhood. Besides being colonel of the local militia for twenty-five years, Kennaway was an avid hunter. He also supported parochial charities, including the Devon and Exeter Society for promoting Christianity amongst the Jews. By 1826 his eyesight was going. Despite his affliction the blind old baronet kept his morning habit of donning a military greatcoat and riding about his estate. On 26 December 1835 he suffered a paralysing stroke. He died early on new year's day 1836, and was succeeded in his baronetcy by his eldest son, John.<br>
