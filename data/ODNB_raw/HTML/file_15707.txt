<span class="headword">Knell,  Thomas, the elder</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1576/7), <span class="occ">religious writer and Church of England clergyman</span>, was most likely a native of Kent. Many of the details of his life are uncertain, and he has suffered from confusion with another <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15708/', "Thomas Knell")</script>, probably his son. The elder of the two men first appears in the years around 1550 as the author of a broadsheet entitled <span class="italic">An ABC to the Christen Congregacion, or, A Pathe Way to the Heavenly Habitacion</span> (ESTC 15029). Written in verse it has a perceptibly evangelical character, not least in its rejection of salvation by works and its emphasis on the primacy of scripture, while its many references to the plight of the poor suggest an affinity to the &#145;commonwealth&#146; literature of Edward VI's reign.<br>
<br>The elder Thomas Knell may have been identical with the man of that name who was minister at Ashford, Kent, in 1552, who may in turn have been the Thomas Knell, described as a <i>quondam</i> minister, who was enrolled as a resident of Geneva on 14 October 1557 and was received into John Knox's congregation there in the following month. It is also possible, however, that he was the Thomas Knolle recorded in 1557 as subscribing the &#145;new discipline&#146; at Frankfurt am Main, and that he there came to know Alexander Nowell, who later secured ecclesiastical preferment for the elder Thomas Knell. But no certain identification is possible. By contrast it is clear that in January 1560 the elder Thomas Knell was collated by Archbishop Matthew Parker to the rectory of Warehorne, near Romney Marsh, worth &pound;19 per annum. He also appears to have served the neighbouring parish of Snave.<br>
<br>A survey of the Canterbury diocesan clergy of 1562 shows that Thomas Knell, rector of Warehorne, was a married BA who was learned but who had been forbidden to preach. He was allegedly resident and hospitable at Warehorne, his only benefice. In September 1569, again described as a BA, he was dispensed to hold a second benefice within 30 miles of Warehorne, a dispensation doubtless necessitated by his collation, that same month and again at Parker's hands, to the vicarage of Lyminge, near Folkestone, valued at &pound;10 18<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. per annum. He was inducted there in December. Shortly afterwards, now resident at Lyminge, he was recorded as a licensed preacher. The presentation in March 1570 to the vicarage of Dartford of a Thomas Knell, who may also have been the incumbent of Warehorne and Lyminge, seems not to have taken effect.<br>
<br>By 16 October 1570 Knell had resigned his vicarage of Lyminge. From this point it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish him from his younger namesake, but it is certain that it was the older man who, on the petition of Alexander Nowell, dean of St Paul's, was presented by the queen to the rectory of St Nicholas Acon, London, on 2 March 1571, and was instituted four days later. The living was valued at &pound;13 per annum. His daughter Zephora was baptized there in October. It was probably the same man who in May 1571 was instituted to the Middlesex vicarage of Hackney (valued at &pound;20 per annum) on the presentation of the rector. Knell resigned St Nicholas Acon and Hackney by 30 March and in April 1573 respectively, and in May was presented by the queen to another London vicarage, that of St Bride, Fleet Street, valued at &pound;16 per annum. This presentation, too, was made on the petition of Dean Nowell. But he does not seem to have severed all connections with Kent, since Barnaby Knell, the son of Thomas Knell, clerk, was baptized at Warehorne in October 1574.<br>
<br>By 23 March 1574 Knell had resigned the vicarage of St Bride, probably as a result of his appointment, at an unknown date, as chaplain to Walter Devereux, earl of Essex. With royal support Essex had set out to conquer and colonize Antrim in summer 1573, and was later appointed governor of Ulster. Having returned to England in November 1575 he went back to Ireland in July 1576, and a month later began to display symptoms of either dysentery or typhoid. A contemporary account of his steady physical decline (perhaps by Thomas Churchyard) records that among the clergymen who ministered to Essex in Dublin Castle was Thomas Knell, described as both preacher and chaplain. Essex is reported as continually desiring his chaplain to say prayers, and when he hoped to extract a promise from his attendants that they would not seek to prolong his life, and so his torments, Knell and another clerical ministrant, John Brown, counselled patience, with Knell declaring, of the earl's death, that &#145;for you it ys expedient but not for us neither for the Church of God&#146;  (Folger Shakespeare Library, MS V.b.317, unfoliated). Essex finally died on 22 September 1576.<br>
<br>There were rumours that Essex had been poisoned, the finger of suspicion being pointed at Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, who had enjoyed a probably adulterous relationship with the dead man's wife (they married in 1578). To scotch these damaging allegations Sir Henry Sidney, the lord deputy of Ireland, required Knell to divulge all he knew. In a report which provides incidental evidence of his knowledge of Latin, Knell confirmed that he had been continually present throughout Essex's last illness, and that he had even administered &#145;a glister&#146; to the sick man. After the earl had declared his own suspicions of poison he had been sent &#145;a peece of unicornes horne&#146; which Knell &#145;rased&#146; and then gave to him, making Essex vomit. Admitting that others of the household had fallen sick at the same time as their master, Knell described in vivid terms the unwholesome symptoms of the earl's malady and the distressing findings of the <i>post mortem</i> examination  (BL, Add. MS 32092, fol. 5<i>r</i>&#150;5<i>v</i>). None of this could either confirm or disprove the charges of poisoning, but Sidney certainly felt that Knell had erred on the side of credulity. In February 1577, after the chaplain's account had been circulated, Sidney told Leicester that he hoped that his investigations had satisfied him and others &#145;touching the false bruit of the Earl of Essex's poisoning&#146;, and declared that he would have &#145;made Knell retract his foolish speech&#146;, had not &#145;God prevented me, he dying of the same disease as the Earl, which was most certainly a mere flux&#146;  (<span class="italic">De L'Isle and Dudley MSS</span>, 2.51). No will has been found and it is not known exactly when Knell died or where he was buried, though it was probably in Dublin. A Margaret Knell, widow, who was buried at Warehorne on 3 May 1577, may have been his wife.<br>
<br>Two books by the elder Thomas Knell were published in 1581. <span class="italic">A Godlie and Necesserie Treatise, Touching the Use and Abuse of Praier</span> (ESTC 15033.3), is a work of straightforward divinity, notable only for its expression of support for bishops as &#145;publike persons&#146; who receive &#145;their authoritie from their naturall prince&#146;  (sig. C2<i>v</i>). Internal evidence suggests that <span class="italic">Certain True Marks wherby to Knowe a Papist</span> (ESTC 15031), a warning against militant Catholicism, was probably written in the late 1560s. Perhaps it was the younger Thomas Knell who secured the posthumous publication of the older man's writings.<br>
