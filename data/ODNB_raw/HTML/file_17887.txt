<span class="headword">Malleson,  John Philip</span>  (1796&#150;1869), <span class="occ">Unitarian minister and schoolmaster</span>, was born in Battersea, Surrey, on 11 February 1796, the fourth and youngest son of Thomas Malleson (1752?&#150;1820) and his wife, Mary (1759?&#150;1823), third daughter of Frederick Gibson, merchant of Cheapside. Thomas Malleson was a silversmith in Sweeter's Rents, Cornhill, and later a jeweller in Princes Street (later Wardour Street), Leicester Square. The family soon moved to 4 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, where Mary Malleson opened a boarding and day school for girls to supplement a family income declining with the prosperity of Thomas Malleson's business.<br>
<br>Educated in his mother's school, Malleson was sent in 1810 to Hitchin to board with the Revd John Bailey (1754&#150;1818), who that year became classical tutor at Wymondley House, an Independent academy supported by the Coward Trust, which Malleson entered in 1812; letters to his mother attest to the liberation he felt in his new surroundings. Beginning in June 1817, he supplied the Independent chapel at Wem, Shropshire, but in November, to the disappointment of his congregation, he matriculated at the University of Glasgow, aided by Dr Williams's Trust, taking the BA in 1819.<br>
<br>In 1820, his views on the divinity of Christ having moved to the Arian position, Malleson became minister of a presbyterian congregation in Hanover Street, Long Acre, London; but he resigned two years later on turning Unitarian. He then opened a day school in Leeds and served as chaplain to Mrs Richard Slater Milnes (1760?&#150;1835) at Fryston Hall near Wakefield. When Lant Carpenter (1780&#150;1840) fell ill in 1827 and resigned&#151;temporarily, as it turned out&#151;from Lewin's Mead Chapel in Bristol, Malleson filled in for a time, but proved an unsuccessful candidate; while there he met James Martineau (1805&#150;1900), just out of Manchester College, York, and conducting Carpenter's school.<br>
<br>In 1829 Malleson succeeded the Revd John Morell (1775&#150;1840) as minister of the New Road Chapel, Brighton, and as head of the school at Hove House; he retired from both posts in 1860 and settled in Croydon. He placed far higher value on the role of minister than on the onerous task of teaching, but, while some admired the restrained elegance and sober effect of his preaching, he had no popular gifts in the pulpit, and it is as a schoolmaster that he deserves primarily to be remembered.<br>
<br>On 14 January 1823 Malleson married Anna Sophia (1793&#150;1873), daughter of William Taylor (1755&#150;1843) and his wife, Catherine Courtauld (1760&#150;1826) of London, and granddaughter of the Revd Henry Taylor (1711&#150;1785), rector of Crawley, vicar of Portsmouth, and author of the latitudinarian letters known as <span class="italic">The Apology of Ben Mordecai</span> (1771&#150;7). The second-generation Taylors were Unitarian, as were the Courtaulds with whom they were associated in the great silk manufacturing firm. The eldest daughter of John Philip and Anna Sophia Malleson died of a fever shortly after the move to Brighton, and within a few weeks their eldest son was killed in a street accident; three other children survived their father, who died of &#145;softening of the brain&#146; at The Close, Croydon, on 16 March 1869 and was buried in Marylebone cemetery, Finchley.<br>
