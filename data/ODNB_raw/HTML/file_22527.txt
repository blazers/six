<span class="headword">Pope,  Alexander</span>  (<em>c.</em>1706&#150;1782), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, was the son of Hector Pope (<i>d</i>. 1719), minister of Loth, Sutherland. He was educated at King's College, Aberdeen, where he graduated MA on 15 April 1725, having received a contribution from the synod in 1720 to enable him to study for entry into the ministry of the Church of Scotland. On 28 July 1730 he was elected session clerk and precentor of Dornoch in Sutherland, in the far north of Scotland, where probably he was also a schoolmaster. He is said to have ridden in the summer of 1732 on his pony from Caithness to Twickenham to visit his namesake, the poet, who presented him with a copy of the subscribers' edition of his translation of Homer's <span class="italic">Odyssey</span> and a handsome snuff-box. A letter from the poet to the minister refers to the &#145;accidental advantage which you say my name has brought you&#146;  (28 April 1738, <span class="italic">Correspondence of Alexander Pope</span>, 4.93), which would seem to indicate that there was no blood relationship between them.<br>
<br>Pope was licensed as a preacher by the presbytery of Dornoch on 19 February 1734, and was ordained minister of Reay, Caithness, on 5 September. He was one of the early evangelical ministers of Caithness. A man of exceptional bodily strength, he won over the population of his parish through his feats of physical prowess. He was known to use a stick to disperse those he found playing games on Sunday. In 1773, when the heritors of the parish had refused to provide a school, he petitioned the court of session and won his case.<br>
<br>On 3 July 1735 Pope married Margaret (<i>c</i>.1715&#150;1744), daughter of Andrew Sutherland of Pitgrudy. They had three sons. Following her death on 22 December 1744 he married (on 2 December 1745) Janet Ross (<i>c</i>.1725&#150;1793); there were a daughter and four sons from that marriage, including James (<i>b</i>. 1750), who became his father's assistant, but who died soon after his ordination. Pope translated a large part of the &#145;Orcades&#146; of Torfaeus, extracts from which are published in Charles Cordiner's <span class="italic">Antiquities and Scenery of Northern Scotland</span> (1780). He also wrote the account of Strathnaver and Sutherland in Thomas Pennant's <span class="italic">A Tour in Scotland</span> (1771), a description of the Dune of Donadilla in <span class="italic">Archaeologia Scotica</span>, as well as making a collection of Ossianic literature about 1739. He died at Reay on 2 March 1782.<br>
