<span class="headword">Walker,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1550&#150;1626), <span class="occ">cartographer</span>, was born probably in West Hanningfield, Essex, one of three sons of John Walker (<i>c</i>.1516&#150;1589), and his wife, Eleanor (<i>c</i>.1525&#150;1589). The family had occupied the copyhold farm of Kents in West Hanningfield from about 1503 or soon after, his father being a yeoman and carpenter, an occupation in Essex that signified a builder of timber-framed houses. His younger brother Cyprian (<i>d</i>. 1631) continued in his father's trade and John Walker himself seems to have derived his early livelihood from building houses, and as late as 1584 to 1597 he was styling himself &#145;architector&#146;. His marriage has not been traced, but he and his wife, Lucy (<i>c</i>.1555&#150;1627), had three children, all baptized at West Hanningfield: Joan in 1574, John in 1577, and Jane in 1579. Walker's early familiarity with the skills of measuring led him to the new practice of surveying landed estates and into an emerging profession otherwise dominated by minor or professional gentry. His earliest extant work was on the manor of West Tilbury for Andrew Jenour in 1584. It is the third oldest surviving scaled map of an Essex estate, remarkable for its thoughtful layout, attention to detail, and careful drawings of buildings, all of which were to be hallmarks of the maps of Walker and, later, his son. It was clearly not the work of a novice but the source of his training as a surveyor and draughtsman is unknown. Although Ralph Agas might have been his tutor, it is more likely to have been Israel Amyce of Wakes Colne  (Edwards and Newton, 24). Walker's first surveys of West Tilbury in 1584 and Boxted in 1586 are reminiscent of Amyce's style and much of his early work was for clients or in places plausibly connected with Amyce. In 1589, when he was residing at Ballingdon-cum-Brundon on the Suffolk&#150;Essex boundary, he surveyed Earls Colne, where Amyce lived, and their names occur together as contributors to the Armada loan collected at the spring assizes in Chelmsford; Walker contributed the surprisingly large sum of &pound;25.<br>
<br>Walker's introduction to the county gentry led to commissions to survey the mid-Essex estates of Sir Thomas Mildmay in 1591, Edward Neville, Baron Bergavenny in 1592, Sir John Tyrell in 1597, and Sir John Petre in 1598. In the maps produced for them he established his reputation for accuracy in fieldwork and a distinctive style of draughtsmanship with fresh colouring and clear handwriting, notably in maps of Chelmsford and Horndon. Further work followed for these and other clients, from 1599 mostly in a partnership with his son in which he directed the fieldwork and his son drew the maps. Although clearly based in mid-Essex throughout this period he occurs irregularly at West Hanningfield until after 1609, when he was elected bailiff of the manor in 1612, 1615, and 1616. He apparently trained Samuel Walker, son of his brother Cyprian Walker, who continued map making in a debased style until 1645, but he himself gave up all surveying after his son's death in 1618. He was buried at West Hanningfield on 8 June 1626.<br>

<a name="cosubject_58381"></a><span class="headword">John Walker</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1577, <em>d.</em> 1618), <span class="occ">cartographer</span>, was baptized at West Hanningfield on 24 June 1577. He and his father produced twelve maps together between 1599 and 1616. Careful analysis of their similar calligraphy has shown that John Walker junior, who had the better hand, was the draughtsman of all their joint maps after 1601. His ability may partly explain a widening demand for their surveys. These included Mascalls Bury in White Roding for Sir John Poyntz in 1609, which was John Walker junior's first commission by himself. In 1614 he undertook the family's only survey outside Essex, albeit for an Essex landowner, Sir Edward Barrett. This was a fine map of the manor of Foxcote in Hampshire. For a new client perhaps unused to interpreting a large-scale map he adopted his father's earlier practice of explaining its purpose &#145;to be as it were a Lanthorne and light for the Lord or Owner of the landes &hellip; for the readier and easier findinge out of any thing in the sayde Survey that they doe desier&#146;  (Edwards and Newton, 64).<br>
<br>In 1611 John Walker married Penelope Warner of South Hanningfield and they lived in West Hanningfield for their short and childless marriage. Two crudely drawn maps in 1616 betray a sudden decline; he was buried at West Hanningfield on 9 April 1618. The two John Walkers were accomplished map makers in a formative period of English cartography. Twenty-nine of their maps and surveys have survived, the great majority in Essex Record Office.<br>
