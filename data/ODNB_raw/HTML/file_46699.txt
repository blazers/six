<span class="headword">Williams,  William</span>  (1788&#150;1865), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 12 February 1788 at Tredarren, Llanpumpsaint, Carmarthenshire, the fourth of twelve children of Thomas Williams and his wife, Esther (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Phillips). He received his only schooling at Llanpumpsaint church school. Having served an apprenticeship in Carmarthen, he went to London in 1804 to seek his fortune. By 1820 he owned his own cotton and linen business in the City, and he soon acquired great wealth, building up his enterprise by travelling to Russia and America. In 1833 he was elected to the court of common council of the City of London, and two years later he was returned as one of the two members of parliament for Coventry, retiring from business to concentrate on his political work. Williams was accustomed to call himself a radical reformer, seeking the secret ballot, shorter parliaments, and the extension of the franchise. He achieved the distinction of being called &#145;<i>the</i> Williams&#146; in <span class="italic">The Times</span>. Although he was a churchman, he worked for the separation of church and state. He lost his seat in Coventry in 1847, mainly because of complacency on the part of his supporters during the election, but he represented Lambeth in parliament from 1850 until his death.<br>
<br>Williams's chief distinction during his parliamentary career was his dogged commitment to government retrenchment, but in the longer perspective he is better remembered for having proposed, on 10 March 1846, that an inquiry should be made &#145;into the state of Education in the Principality of Wales, especially into the means afforded to the labouring classes of acquiring a knowledge of the English language&#146;. He considered that many of his countrymen were handicapped in their careers by their lack of knowledge of English. The reports (the blue books) of the commission, published in 1847, gave rise to widespread controversy. Williams presided at an important meeting at the Freemasons' Tavern in London on 1 December 1863 on the question of the creation of a university in Wales, and on 13 March 1865 he added a codicil to his will leaving &pound;1000 to the proposed university.<br>
<br>Williams died, unmarried, on 28 April 1865 at his residence, 12 Park Square West, Regent's Park, London, after a protracted illness following a fall from a horse. He was buried in Kensal Green cemetery, next to Joseph Hume, his political mentor.<br>
