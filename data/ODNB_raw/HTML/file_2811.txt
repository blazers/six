<span class="headword">Bomelius,  Eliseus</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1579), <span class="occ">physician and astrologer</span>, born in Wesel, Westphalia, was probably the son of Henry Bomelius (<i>d</i>. 1570), a native of Bommel (now Zaltbommel) in the Netherlands, who from 1540 to 1559 was Lutheran preacher at Wesel, and the author of several religious and historical books of wide repute. The <span class="italic">Summa der godliker scrifturen</span>, published in England as <span class="italic">The Summe of the Holye Scripture and Ordynary of the Christen Teachyng</span> (1548), is attributed to him. Henry Bomelius's friend Bishop Bale lived for some time at Wesel: he contributed Latin verses in the author's praise to Bale's <span class="italic">Illustrium maioris Britanniae &hellip; summarium</span> (1548), and to his <span class="italic">Scriptorum &hellip; catalogus</span> (1557).<br>
<br>It was probably on Bale's advice that Eliseus Bomelius was educated at Cambridge, which is probably what Jerome Horsey meant by writing that Bomelius was &#145;brought up&#146; there. He proceeded to the degree of doctor of medicine. Well received by the English reformers, he contributed an &#145;epigramma&#146; in Latin elegiacs to an edition of Thomas Becon's early works (1560). Henry Bennet of Calais, in dedicating his life of Oecolampadius to James Blount, sixth Baron Mountjoy, praises Mountjoy for entertaining with &#145;zealous affection Heliseus Bomelius, a German, who readeth unto your honour the liberal sciences, and whom Phillip Melancthon hath in familiar letters praysed highly for erudicion and godlynes&#146;  (Bennet). Although Bennet refers to Bomelius's &#145;learned works published&#146;  (ibid.), no such piece has been identified. Bomelius married Jane Richards, of St Stephen Walbrook, London, on 18 July 1564. In 1567 he was said to be living in Lord Lumley's house (presumably, his London residence, near Tower Hill); his last known domicile in London was in St Michael-le-Querne parish.<br>
<br>As a physician and astrologer, Bomelius rapidly made a high reputation in London. An astrological discussion made in 1570 for the prospective marriage of Queen Elizabeth, and found among William Cecil's papers, has been attributed to Bomelius (or to Sir Thomas Smith (1513&#150;1577)). <span class="italic">An almanacke and pronostication of master Elis Bomelius for ye yere of Our Lorde God 1567 autorysshed by my lorde of London</span> [Edmund Grindal] was published in London in 1567. Prescriptions&#151;not identified&#151;in Gervase Markham's <span class="italic">The English Hus-Wife</span> were claimed to have been &#145;gathered together&#146; by Dr Bomelius and &#145;Dr Burket&#146; (Burchard Kranich)  (Markham, 5). A few Latin letters Bomelius wrote survive in the Public Record Office (state papers, domestic) and the British Library.<br>
<br>In 1567 Bomelius was arrested at the instance of Thomas Francis, president of the College of Physicians, for practising medicine without licence of the college, and was imprisoned in the Wood Street Compter. On 27 May 1567 he wrote to Cecil, praying for an opportunity to expose Francis's ignorance of astronomy and Latin, and on 3 May 1568 he supplicated at Oxford for incorporation, as a doctor of medicine of Cambridge.<br>
<br>Early in 1569 Bomelius's wife stated before the censors' committee of the College of Physicians that her husband had given due satisfaction for his offence, and petitioned for his liberation. The censors demanded payment of a &pound;20 fine and &pound;15 costs, which Bomelius was unable to pay. (In a letter to Cecil, of February 1568, he said that while living in London he had expended over &pound;100 but received only &pound;12.) On 2 June 1569 the committee appears to have offered Bomelius his release on condition of his giving a bond of &pound;100 to abstain from practice. Before Easter 1570 he was &#145;an open prisoner&#146; of the king's bench.<br>
<br>On 3 April 1570 Archbishop Matthew Parker wrote to Cecil about Bomelius: &#145;Whether any practitioner hath resorted to him (as many have a wonderful confidence in him and in his magic) I know not&#146;. What he did know, however, was that, &#145;last term&#146;, Bomelius had deliberately holed the bottom of Parker's &#145;poor barge&#146; on the Thames, and he feared &#145;some conspiracy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 363&#150;5). He enclosed a letter of Bomelius's, concerning England's imminent peril: accordingly, Cecil wrote to Bomelius, to find that the &#145;conspiracy&#146; was merely an astrological forecast.<br>
<br>In early May 1570 Bomelius sent a Latin letter to Cecil, claiming: &#145;In about a month hence I shall be enabled &hellip; to devote my services &hellip; to Her Royal Majesty, and point out a way whereby these intestine evils may be healed, without any effusion of blood&#146;. However, he observed that &#145;the Russian Ambassador sends messengers to me daily, and does not expect to obtain my services without a large stipend&#146;  (Leigh). As Cecil treated Bomelius's announcements with deserved contempt, Bomelius resolved to live in Muscovy. The English government did not hinder his departure, and late in 1570 Bomelius, who had promised to supply Cecil with political information, was settled in Russia. During his travels in that country (1572), Sir Jerome Horsey frequently met Bomelius, then living in great pomp at the court of Ivan IV, in high favour with the tsar as a magician, and holding an official position in the household of the tsar's son. He was said to have amassed great wealth, which he transmitted by way of England to his native town of Wesel; and by his astrological calculations, to have encouraged the tsar to persist in an absurd scheme of marrying Queen Elizabeth, falsely represented as a young girl. Charged with intriguing with the kings of Poland and Sweden against the tsar, Bomelius was arrested with others and racked. After being roasted at a stake, he was put into a loathsome dungeon where he died, in 1579. Horsey, who gives a full description of his death, characterizes him as &#145;a skilful mathematician, a wicked man, and practiser of much mischief&#146;. Like his preacher father, he was a protestant, and when near his end, under torture, &#145;cast up his eyes, naming Christ&#146;. Only in 1583 could Sir Jerome Bowes obtain leave for the widow, Jane, to leave Russia and return to England. No will or administration of Bomelius's has been noticed, but a marriage licence of 29 October 1586 shows Jane, widow of Eliseus Bomelius, late of St Michael-le-Querne, MD, about to marry Thomas Wennington, gentleman, of St Margaret Pattens parish, London.<br>
