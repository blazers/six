<span class="headword">Lambert <span class="st"> [Lambart]</span>,  Oliver</span>, first Baron Lambart of Cavan  (<em>c.</em>1560&#150;1618), <span class="occ">soldier and administrator</span>, was son and heir of Walter Lambert (<i>d</i>. 1596?), alderman of Southampton, and his first wife, Rose, daughter of Sir Oliver Wallop of Farleigh Wallop, Hampshire. He was educated at Furnival's Inn and Lincoln's Inn from 1578, but became a professional soldier. He went to Ireland in the early 1580s, probably through his Wallop connection. There he served under Sir John Norris in an expedition by the lord deputy, Sir John Perrot, against the Scots in co. Antrim and co. Down in 1584, in which he was wounded; captured by two sons of Shane O'Neill on his way to Dublin in October, he was used by them as an intermediary.<br>
<br>Lambert returned to England in March 1585, with recommendations to Burghley and Walsingham from both Perrot and Norris and his uncle Sir Henry Wallop. In June 1585 he received a pension of &pound;50 per annum and in August (under the treaty of Nonsuch) he accompanied Norris to the Netherlands. There he took part in the capture of Doesburg in September 1586 and was appointed its governor by the earl of Leicester. Later, in an important offensive in the Dutch revolt, he distinguished himself in the recapture of Deventer in June 1591. In June 1592 he took part in the siege of Steenwijk, but being wounded there was sent to Ostend rather than to campaign in France, and later returned to England for a time. Early in 1596 he was sent from the Low Countries by Sir Francis Vere to the earl of Essex with a warning of a plot against the queen and a strong recommendation for employment. Accordingly, he took part in the English expedition against Cadiz in 1596, as colonel and quartermaster, and was knighted by Essex for his valour.<br>
<br>In the aftermath of this expedition, and amid English fears of a Spanish response, Lambert was selected to organize defences in Hampshire, with recommendation to noblemen there, including Lord Mountjoy. His military appointments in England in 1597 and early 1598 included the superintendence of the musters in Wiltshire and the responsibility, in recognition of his knowledge and experience in martial affairs, to transfer soldiers levied in Kent to Ostend. Now, also, he was returned to parliament for Southampton and served on parliamentary committees in December 1597 and January 1598. In 1598, back in the Low Countries, he was a captain in the English garrison at Flushing and, in 1598 also, joint promoter of a minor privateering voyage conducted from Southampton. In 1598 he married Hester (1579?&#150;1639), daughter of William Fleetwood, then receiver-general of the court of wards and later an advocate for him with Sir Robert Cecil.<br>
<br>In April 1599 Lambert returned to Ireland with soldiers withdrawn from the Netherlands to support Essex's appointment and campaign there against Hugh O'Neill and his confederates. To Essex, Lambert was one of only few officers there with any substantial experience of warfare, and when Essex left Ireland prematurely in September, he left Lambert as chief commander in Leinster answerable to the earl of Ormond, and, provisionally, marshal of the camp. Acutely conscious that his association with Essex could jeopardize his new position, Lambert sought to assure it by overtures to the now-ascending Sir Robert Cecil. The ongoing war in Ireland contributed to his success in this. The privy council and the queen commended him to the new lord deputy, Mountjoy, as, unlike many, a commander of activist temperament; and, now involved in various engagements especially in Leinster, from 15 April 1600 he was sergeant-major of the army there. In the summer of 1601 Mountjoy appointed him governor of Connaught (from September, and constable of Athlone Castle from 1 October), for which office he had offered Cecil &pound;500 in February. This was essentially a military command in that province, but he was also to act in restraint of O'Donnell should a rumoured Spanish landing in Ireland occur. His advancement, however, provoked jealousies, with another officer informing Cecil that not only was Lambert still ill-disposed towards Cecil himself but that he acted sternly and oppressively in Connaught also. After the defeat of the Spaniards and their Irish allies at Kinsale, in which he took part, Lambert suppressed the uprising in the province and was by March 1602 arguing that the instruments of civil government through the assizes and the collection of composition rents should be brought into force there again. At both Galway and Sligo in 1602 he carried out some work of fortification as precaution against a further Spanish landing.<br>
<br>With the end of war in 1603 a new phase in Lambert's Irish career began. On instructions from London on 9 September, he was made a privy councillor in the Dublin government, ordered to benefit from a grant of confiscated lands of &pound;100 annual valuation, and replaced (with a pension) in Connaught by the earl of Clanricarde. By 1606 he had built up an estate, some of it at Kilbeggan, Westmeath, where he now lived, and a house in Dublin; as an indication that he intended to build his fortune in Ireland, he sold property in Southampton in 1607. In the summer of 1606 he took part in a journey into counties Monaghan, Cavan, and Fermanagh by Lord Deputy Sir Arthur Chichester to investigate landownership, with a fee of &pound;1 per day. After the flight of the earls in 1607, one of whom, O'Donnell, pronounced him to have been opprobrious, Lambert was sent to London to report, and returned in November with confirmation of a lease of termon lands in co. Cavan. On the outbreak of O'Doherty's rising in April 1608 he was one of those dispatched north to repress it, and in 1609 was one of the commissioners appointed to survey the escheated lands in the six Ulster counties in preparation for plantation there. In 1610 he was a commissioner to implement that plantation, and was paid for that and for a later visit to London on government business which lasted until 1611.<br>
<br>Lambert benefited personally from the plantation in Ulster, receiving an estate by patent in June 1611 as a servitor in Clonmahon barony, co. Cavan. Later he got custody of O'Reilly's old castle at Cavan provided he carry out defensive building there at his own expense. When parliament was summoned in 1613, he was returned for co. Cavan amid controversial circumstances and with the native Irish freeholders protesting that he did not live in that county. The final military episode of his life was a naval one involving Scotland. Late in 1614 he was dispatched from Ireland with an expedition to retake Dunyvaig Castle on Islay which had been held as a royal fortress (under the command since 1610 of Andrew Knox, formerly bishop of the Isles and now of Raphoe) as a curb on the MacDonalds of the Isles, and which they had again recently seized. This was achieved early in February 1615, after which Lambert returned to Ireland. In April the king instructed Chichester to thank him for his success, and on 17 February 1618 Sir Oliver was created Baron Lambart of Cavan.<br>
<br>Lambart died on a visit to London later that year, probably on 9 June, and was buried on 10 June in Westminster Abbey. He had two sons, Charles, who succeeded him as second baron, and Carew, the latter inheriting lands in co. Roscommon. One daughter died young and the other two married in England. By the time of his death, he had, by acquiring another grantee's estate, extended his holdings of plantation land in Cavan, rented mostly to its Irish occupiers, and had built two flankered bawns at strategic places there. His wealth lay essentially in the lands accumulated in Ireland, which were confirmed by patent to his widow and sons in 1622. By his will he provided that his two daughters should receive an inheritance of &pound;1500 each, and made smaller bequests to others including John Wallop and Thomas Fleetwood. If he were one of the more successful English figures in the Ireland of his times, and if his career manifests the many and interlinked theatres in which England operated in that era, it demonstrates also the magnitude of the change brought about in Ireland during his lifetime.<br>
