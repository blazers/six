<span class="headword">Peel, Sir  Robert</span>, third baronet  (1822&#150;1895), <span class="occ">politician</span>, eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21764/', "Sir Robert Peel, second baronet (1788&#150;1850)")</script>, the prime minister, and his wife, Julia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Floyd (1795&#150;1859), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9773/', "Lieutenant-General Sir John Floyd, first baronet")</script>, was born in London on 4 May 1822. His brothers included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35451/', "Sir Frederick Peel")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21766/', "Sir William Peel")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35450/', "Arthur Wellesley Peel, first Viscount Peel")</script>. Peel was &#145;small, dark, almost foreign-looking, and volatile&#146;  (Gash, 176). Throughout his life he was blamed for lacking the <i>gravitas</i> which his father and the Peelites so especially praised in public life. He went to Harrow School in February 1835 and matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, on 26 May 1841, but did not take a degree (unlike his father, whose double first was legendary). Entering the diplomatic service, he became an attach&eacute; to the British legation at Madrid on 18 June 1844. He was promoted to be secretary of legation in Switzerland on 2 May 1846, and was charg&eacute; d'affaires there in November 1846. After succeeding his father to the baronetcy on 2 July 1850, he entered the Commons as Liberal Conservative member for his father's former constituency, Tamworth, on 19 July 1850 and held it until 1880.<br>
<br>On 24 April 1854 Peel was shipwrecked off the coast of Genoa in the steamboat <i>Ercolano</i>, and only saved his life by swimming ashore. From 29 March 1854 to 1859 he served as a captain in the Staffordshire yeomanry. In March 1855 Lord Palmerston, who had been foreign minister while Peel was in the diplomatic service, appointed him a junior lord of the Admiralty. Henceforth he was regarded as a Liberal, and his persistent advocacy of the liberation of Italy fully justified this view of his political opinions. Palmerston liked Peel's jaunty manner and became his chief political patron. In July 1856 Peel acted as secretary to Lord Granville's special mission to Russia at the coronation of Alexander II, but on 5 January 1857, during a lecture delivered at the opening of the new library at Adderley Park, near Birmingham, he spoke discourteously of the Russian court and the court officials. The lecture was severely commented on by the Russian and French press, was the subject of a parliamentary debate, and caused great annoyance to the English court. Nevertheless, on Palmerston's return to power, Peel became, on 26 July 1861, chief secretary to the lord lieutenant of Ireland and a privy councillor. Together with Thomas Larcom, he operated an effective system of active surveillance which curbed the early efforts of the Fenians. But this was accompanied by an over-genial public persona and an anti-Catholic stance which estranged Cardinal Cullen and the priesthood and led to the disaffection of Irish Roman Catholic MPs with Palmerston's government. Peel lacked the will or ability to develop a land policy of the sort increasingly expected by Irish Liberals. On Palmerston's death he was succeeded in the Irish secretaryship by Chichester Fortescue, and he did not again hold office. On 5 January 1866 he was created GCB.<br>
<br>Peel continued to sit for Tamworth as a Liberal, but was often a severe critic of Gladstone's government of 1868&#150;74. In 1874 he for a second time christened himself a Liberal Conservative; and during the Eastern question debates of 1876&#150;80 he supported the Conservative government's policies. He did not stand for Tamworth at the general election in 1880, but unsuccessfully contested Gravesend as a Conservative; after 1880 his voice was often heard on Conservative platforms, denouncing the action of the Liberal administration in Egypt and Ireland. <span class="italic">The Times</span> of 8 May 1880 published his letter recounting the offers from various governments of honours and offices which he had refused. On 21 March 1884 he was elected at a by-election as Conservative member for Huntingdon. When that borough was disfranchised, he was, in November 1885, returned for Blackburn. However, on the critical division on the second reading of the <span class="roman">Home Rule Bill</span>, on 7 June 1886, he abstained from voting, thus shocking his tory colleagues. He was the only Conservative MP who by supporting home rule balanced the flow of Liberals into Conservatism. At the general election in July 1886 he unsuccessfully contested the Inverness burghs against a Liberal Unionist. Subsequently, with characteristic impetuosity, he threw himself into the home-rule campaign as a supporter of the Irish demands, and at a by-election in 1889 came forward as a candidate for Brighton in the home-rule interest. He was hopelessly defeated, and his political career came to a disappointing close.<br>
<br>From about 1856 Peel was extensively engaged in racing under the name of Mr F. Robinson; and later on he had an establishment at Bonehill, near Tamworth, where he bred horses. He added to his father's fine collection of pictures and drawings, which included the well-known <span class="italic">Chapeau de paille</span> by Rubens, but his extravagance and declining financial position forced their sale to the National Gallery in March 1871 and, in June 1884, the sale of much of the Drayton estate, excluding the manor house, though he ceased to live there. Peel married, on 13 January 1856, Lady Emily Hay, seventh daughter of the eighth marquess of Tweeddale. They had a son, Robert (the fourth baronet), and three daughters. Lady Emily left her husband and lived in Geneva (she later moved to Florence and died in April 1924). On 9 May 1895 Peel was found dead, from haemorrhage of the brain, in his bedroom at 12 Stratton Street, London. He was buried at Drayton Bassett parish church on 16 May.<br>
