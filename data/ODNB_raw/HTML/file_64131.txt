<span class="headword">Perceval,  Charles George</span>, second Baron Arden in the peerage of Ireland, and first Baron Arden in the peerage of the United Kingdom  (1756&#150;1840), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 1 October 1756 at Charlton, Kent, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21912/', "John Perceval, second earl of Egmont (1711&#150;1770)")</script>, landowner and politician, and his second wife, Catherine (1731&#150;1784), the daughter of the Hon. Charles Compton. He had four sisters, and six brothers, the youngest of whom was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21916/', "Spencer Perceval")</script>, the future prime minister. Their mother was created Baroness Arden in the Irish peerage in 1770, and following her death in 1784 Perceval succeeded as second Baron Arden; he took his seat in the Irish Lords in 1787. He was educated at Harrow School (1771&#150;4), and at Trinity College, Cambridge (1774&#150;7), whence he proceeded MA in 1777; he entered Lincoln's Inn in the same year.<br>
<br>Perceval was elected to the Commons on 28 November 1780 as MP for Launceston on the duke of Northumberland's interest. A supporter of North's administration, on 27 November 1781 he moved the address. He opposed North's successors until he was appointed a lord of the Admiralty by his friend Pitt, who became premier in December 1783. Despite having several times vocally opposed electoral reform, he voted for Pitt's proposals for parliamentary reform in 1785. On 1 March 1787 he married Margaretta Elizabeth (1768&#150;1851), the daughter of General Sir Thomas Spencer Wilson, sixth baronet, of Uckfield, Sussex, and his wife, Jane Badger-Weller; they had six sons and three daughters. In 1790 he was returned for Warwick on Lord Warwick's interest and in 1796 for Totnes on the duke of Bolton's interest. In August 1790 he obtained the lucrative reversionary sinecure of registrar of the court of Admiralty, which had been granted to him in 1764, and he moved the navy estimates every year from 1792 to 1800 and spoke only on Admiralty questions. He remained a steadfast supporter of Pitt, who refused his resignation during the naval mutinies of 1797, and he contributed &pound;10,000 to the loyalty loan. Rallying to Pitt's successor, Addington, in 1801, he was sworn of the privy council (20 February 1801) and served as master of the Royal Mint (March&#150;July 1802) and an India board commissioner (May 1801&#150;October 1803). At Addington's instigation he was made Baron Arden in the United Kingdom peerage on 28 July 1802. He was a fellow of the Royal Society and the Society of Antiquaries and a trustee of the Hunterian Museum.<br>
<br>On Pitt's return to power in May 1804, Arden became a lord of the bedchamber, and he transferred to Windsor from 1812 until George III's death in 1820. His Admiralty registrarship, to which his younger brother Spencer Perceval was reversionary heir, was attacked in the Commons in 1807, and Arden defended his family preserve in the Lords on 4 August by citing the royal prerogative. Brushing aside a government compromise, he further rebuffed his critics on 29 February 1808, 10 March 1808, and 20 February 1810. An act to suspend reversions temporarily was passed in 1812, but the attacks on Arden's sinecure continued in the Commons; in debate on 19 June 1812 Henry Martin alleged that Arden had profited by &pound;30,000 in fees and &pound;7000 annual interest on securities. The attack continued in 1813, and ministers agreed to the abolition of reversions, but not until after Arden's death, which took place at his home in St James's Place, London, on 5 July 1840. Caricatured as an arch sinecurist, Arden was then worth about &pound;800,000 and had spent the last ten years of his life as lord lieutenant of Surrey. He was buried at Charlton, Kent, on 11 July 1840.<br>
