<span class="headword">Hewitt,  James</span>, first Viscount Lifford  (<em>d.</em> 1789), <span class="occ">lord chancellor of Ireland</span>, was one of the three sons of William Hewitt (<i>d</i>. 1747/8), a mercer and draper who was mayor of Coventry in 1744, and his wife, Hannah: William Hewitt's will provides details of land held at Marston Trussell, Northamptonshire, and William Hewitt may be the person of this name who married Hannah Sutton at Sibbertoft (the neighbouring parish to Marston Trussell) in January 1712. James Hewitt may therefore have been born at Marston Trussell. A letter of August 1788 in which he claimed to be seventy-three years old suggests he was born in 1714 or 1715, though other sources (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>, which also identifies his mother as Hannah Lewis) give his probable birth date as 1709 and his place of birth as Coventry  (G. Naylor, <span class="italic">The Registers of Thorrington</span>, 1888). From at least 1737 Hewitt was employed by James Birch, an attorney and receiver-general for Warwickshire, and in the same year he entered the Middle Temple. From 1741 he was articled to Birch; called to the bar in November 1742, he soon developed a substantial practice  (TNA: PRO, IR 1/17). He stood for Coventry, unsuccessfully, in 1754 but won the parliamentary seat at the general election in 1761. In 1755 he became a serjeant-at-law, and four years later he was appointed king's serjeant.<br>
<br>On 6 November 1766 Hewitt was appointed a judge of the king's bench, with the promise of further promotion, and on 9 January 1768 he received letters patent as lord chancellor of Ireland. On the same day he was created Baron Lifford in the Irish peerage, and he was made a viscount in January 1781. Lifford was lord chancellor of Ireland during the struggle between the two parliaments that resulted in the short-lived independence of the Irish legislature. He held the office for twenty-two years, longer than any of his predecessors since the time of Edward I. His income as lord chancellor was estimated at &pound;12,000 per annum.<br>
<br>Hewitt married, first, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1765), the only daughter of the Revd Rice Williams DD, rector of Stapleford Abbots, Essex, prebendary of Worcester, and archdeacon of Carmarthen. Of their children James (1750&#150;1830), who succeeded to the viscountcy, was dean of Armagh for more than thirty years; Joseph (1754&#150;1794) was a judge of the king's bench in Ireland; and John (<i>d</i>. 1804) was dean of Cloyne. On 15 December 1766 Hewitt married, as his second wife, Ambrosia (<i>d</i>. 1807), daughter of the Revd Charles Bayley of Navestock, Essex, with whom he had further children. Lifford had intended to resign on a pension but died in Dublin on 28 April 1789, of a &#145;malignant sore throat&#146; caught at the House of Lords  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>). He was buried in Christ Church, Dublin, where there is a memorial to him.<br>
<br>Lifford was known for the accuracy of his technical knowledge and for his general professional skill. He was said to be formal in manner and with old-fashioned ideas but he was also patient and urbane, and those qualities gained him general respect. He was the first lord chancellor of Ireland whose judgments have been preserved. A volume entitled <span class="italic">Reports of select cases argued and determined in the high court of chancery in Ireland, principally in the time of Lord Lifford</span> was published in 1839; it was edited by James Lyne from a manuscript prepared by John Wallis KC. The decisions reported are from the years 1767 to 1786. Many of Lifford's judgments remained in manuscript and probably perished in the Four Courts fire of 1922 but some may survive in the library of King's Inns  (Osborough, 100).<br>
