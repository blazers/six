<span class="headword">Strickland,  Walter</span>, appointed Lord Strickland under the protectorate  (1598?&#150;1671), <span class="occ">politician and diplomatist</span>, was the second son of Walter Strickland (<i>d</i>. 1636) of Boynton, Yorkshire, and Frances (<i>d</i>. 1636), daughter of Peter Wentworth of Lillingstone Lovel, Oxfordshire, and niece of Sir Francis Walsingham. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26671/', "Sir William Strickland")</script> was his elder brother. Walter Strickland was admitted to Gray's Inn on 10 August 1618, and matriculated at Queens' College, Cambridge, at Easter 1619. He married Anne Morgan (<i>d</i>. 1688), daughter of Sir Charles Morgan (<i>d</i>. 1595), governor of Bergen-op-Zoom, and widow of Sir Lewis Morgan. Until 1642 merely a Yorkshire JP, his selection as parliamentary ambassador to the United Provinces that October appears to have been primarily due to his wife's Dutch connections. Resident at The Hague on a salary of &pound;400 p.a., he initially protested at Henrietta Maria's attempt to raise funds there and thereafter sought to counter the influence of her Orange relatives on Dutch attitudes to parliament, and reported on royalists hiring Dutch ships. He received a &pound;500 gift from parliament for his efforts in July 1645, and was recruited to the Long Parliament to fill a vacancy at Minehead.<br>
<br>The king's execution made the Commonwealth a pariah, but the states of Holland commenced commercial negotiations and parliament sent Isaac Dorislaus to assist Strickland. Dorislaus's assassination by royalists on 2 May 1649 emphasized the danger Strickland was in, but he stayed on, though royalist revival in Scotland caused the states general of the United Provinces to delay receiving him. He persuaded the states of Holland to protest at this delay, regarding their goodwill as &#145;a foundation to cut off for ever the hopes of [England's] greatest enemies&#146;. Even so, he had to act on the council of state's resolution of 21 June 1650 to recall him on account of his having been snubbed while assuring Holland of parliament's continuing goodwill. He reported to parliament on 7 August, receiving their thanks. Hopes of the Dutch revived after William II provoked a confrontation with Holland and then suddenly died in October. To exploit this, parliament sent Strickland back on 23 January with a new colleague, Oliver St John, to press for the closest possible alliance with the resurgent republicans. Harassed by the royalists, their attempt to focus the talks on royalist rebels' activities in the United Provinces met with vague replies. The Dutch would expel only active rebels, and proposed that English shipping be allowed to trade in Dutch areas of the West Indies and America, the fleets to act against pirates, and each to have free access to the other's harbours. The preponderance of the Dutch mercantile marine gave them the advantage, and they rejected attempts to impound Princess Mary's property to reimburse victims of Dutch licensed royalist pirates. Amid continuing deadlock the English left on 18 June; both sides were inflexible but it may be that St John favoured breakdown from the start, in association with those MPs who prompted retaliation to the failed negotiations with the <span class="roman">Navigation Acts</span>.<br>
<br>Strickland had been a commissioner for the assessment in Yorkshire since 1649, and in 1652 he took up the same post in his wife's home county, Glamorgan. A member of the council of state since 13 February 1651, he was now eclipsed by the warmongers in Dutch policy but represented the council's opinion on scandalous ministers to parliament in July. His wife, calling herself Lady Morgan, made an independent visit to Holland in June 1652, no doubt to promote English interests with her relatives. Strickland acquired the manor of Flamborough, Yorkshire, under sequestration from Sir Henry Griffith, in 1650 for &pound;4800, &pound;2000 of it from his wife. In January 1652 he asked parliament to confirm that he could acquire full title by paying off &pound;500 outstanding on the mortgage, which the committee for advance of money arranged.<br>
<br>Milton considered Strickland a close ally of Cromwell in 1652, and he was one of those he consulted after the expulsion of the Rump in 1653. He continued on councils of state and acquired Whitehall lodgings, and the army selected him to sit for Yorkshire in the Barebones Parliament. As an experienced diplomat he joined their committee for foreign affairs and was one of the council's negotiators with the Dutch over the ending of the First Anglo-Dutch War (1652&#150;4). Cromwell, handling negotiations, insisted on considering federation despite Dutch opposition. Where Strickland believed in alliance with the Dutch republicans against the house of Orange, Cromwell unnecessarily insisted that the latter be formally excluded from power and thus delayed the settlement. Meanwhile Strickland represented the council case against John Lilburne to parliament, and signed the assembly's renunciation of its powers on 12 December 1653 with other moderates.<br>
<br>The second oldest, but a very active, member of Cromwell's council, Strickland sat in the protectorate parliaments for the East Riding in 1654 and Newark in 1656, and handled some Yorkshire business for the council, as when judges questioned the legality of Cromwell's treason laws during royalists' trials in 1655. In foreign affairs he supported alliance with France, being appointed to negotiate with its ambassadors in April 1654. Conversely, as an opponent of alliance with Sweden he was detailed in January 1656 to join the more sympathetic Whitelocke to negotiate the Swedish treaty. He was firm in insisting that all goods which could be used for military purposes, particularly guns, should be declared contraband for export to possible enemies. He took part in commercial negotiations with the Dutch ambassador Nieupoort in 1656, and assisted the committee to give aid to persecuted Piedmontese and Polish protestants.<br>
<br>A tolerant pragmatist in religion, Strickland condemned parliamentary eagerness to prosecute the Quaker &#145;prophet&#146; Nayler in 1656, declaring, &#145;which sticks with me the most is the nearness of his opinion to that which is a most glorious truth, that the spirit is personally in us&#146;. He preferred Quakers to be prosecuted for &#145;plainly explained&#146; offences and heresy to be visible and easier to discover, and assisted the readmission of the Jews. He also took a ceremonial role from 1654 as commander of Cromwell's foot guards, and was jeered at by republicans for importing Dutch ceremonial. He was summoned to Cromwell's &#145;other house&#146; in 1657, taking his seat as Walter, Lord Strickland, on 20 January 1658.<br>
<br>Strickland moved towards the generals' party in Cromwell's council, and after the latter's death supported them against Richard Cromwell. Consequently he was admitted to the army-dominated committee of safety in October 1659, also retaining a seat in the restored Rump and on local commissions for assessment and the militia. He took no part in resisting the Restoration and was not prosecuted. Retiring to Flamborough, he wrote a &#145;History of persecution&#146; defending the protestant sects. He died on 1 November 1671 and was buried in Flamborough church where a memorial was later erected. A shrewd and pragmatic politician and foreign affairs expert to both the Long Parliament and Cromwell, he was ultimately overruled by both on his main area of expertise.<br>
