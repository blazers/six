<span class="headword">Beaton,  (Donald) Leonard</span>  (1929&#150;1971), <span class="occ">journalist and strategic analyst</span>, was born on 20 June 1929 in Montreal, the son of John W. Beaton. He was educated in Montreal, at Westmount high school, and at McGill University, where he took an honours degree in economics and in political science. In 1950 he entered St Catharine's College, Cambridge, as an affiliated student where he read part two of the history tripos and then of the English tripos, achieving second class honours in each of these.<br>
<br>Eschewing the chance of employment in the Canadian diplomatic service, Beaton chose to become a journalist, beginning with the Montreal <span class="italic">Gazette</span>. In the spring of 1954 he joined the London-based staff of Reuters to work on the European and central news desks. Early in 1956 he joined <span class="italic">The Times</span> as naval correspondent and general reporter. The post of naval correspondent had for long been held by a retired naval officer. It now passed to someone whose maritime experience hitherto consisted of his first transatlantic crossing from Montreal. Beaton soon justified the judgement of the editor, Sir William Haley, that any competent journalist could do the job if intelligent and energetic enough.<br>
<br>In May 1957 Beaton moved to the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> as defence and air correspondent. He soon developed a widely recognized expertise on aeronautics and nuclear strategy generally. <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> also assigned Beaton the task of reporting the 1962 negotiations in Brussels on Britain's application to join the European Common Market. His sceptical attitude regarding the value of these negotiations for Britain and his disinclination to accept the official version of events at face value earned him the displeasure of Britain's chief negotiator, Edward Heath.<br>
<br>While still defence correspondent of <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> Beaton wrote, with John Maddox, the first serious book-length study of nuclear proliferation, entitled <span class="italic">The Spread of Nuclear Weapons</span>, published under the imprimatur of the Institute of Strategic Studies in 1962. Beaton left <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> in 1963 to be the first designated director of studies at the London-based Institute of Strategic Studies (ISS), then in its fifth year since being launched, though he had been closely in touch with the institute from its start. He felt by then that he ought to free himself somewhat from the grind of daily journalism and turn to longer-range analysis and advocacy. Though a generous and encouraging adviser, he was too much of an individualist and too naturally a polemicist to be entirely at ease in this role, and after two years he gave up the post to become a senior research associate at ISS, freer to concentrate on his own work. Throughout the 1960s he continued to be a prolific writer, broadcaster, and lecturer. It was in a television interview with President Eisenhower that he brought out publicly for the first time the extent to which Eisenhower as president had been ready in 1953 to threaten and contemplate the use of nuclear weapons both in Korea and against China.<br>
<br>Beaton was editor of the <span class="italic">Round Table</span> between 1965 and 1970 and was a principal influence in ending that quarterly journal's practice of anonymous contributions in favour of signed articles. More important, Beaton master-minded the reorientation of the journal away from its strongly flavoured imperialist tradition to the realities of the expanding multi-racial Commonwealth of the late 1960s. Even when not formally a staff member he frequently contributed pieces to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, before returning as a special writer on strategic affairs at the beginning of 1971. He wrote a more popular and updated version of <span class="italic">The Spread of Nuclear Weapons</span> under the title <span class="italic">Must the Bomb Spread?</span> (1966). Soon afterwards he prepared and wrote the script for a major television series on strategy and disarmament, <span class="italic">The Struggle for Peace</span>. He was twice visiting professor at the University of Toronto. He was once described by a leading American strategist, Bernard Brodie, as &#145;the most lucid and accurate commentator on defence questions in the press of the English-speaking world&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>Beaton was about 6 feet in height, and had a round face; his eyes often seemed to be twinkling with good humour behind his spectacles. In 1967 he married Katherine Bougarel, daughter of Dr and Mme Fran&ccedil;ois Bougarel, of Ch&acirc;teauroux, France, and they had a daughter. Beaton was strongly opinionated on many subjects and liked argument and controversy. For about ten years before his death he rented a cottage near Wells in Somerset, where friends liked to visit. After lengthy walks in the Mendips and during long, reasonably bibulous, evenings by his fireplace they shared with him his keen enjoyment of discussion: his wide-ranging affection for English poets; his reading in devotional and controversial Christian literature; and his spirited challenges to then currently fashionable ideas such as the anachronism of the Commonwealth, the reformability of the Roman Catholic church, and the need for some form of pan-European, or at least pan-west European political organization.<br>
<br>Beaton died from a heart attack on 9 June 1971 while visiting Venice. He had intended to resume a regular commentary on the Common Market, of which he was critical, for <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> from July 1971. Instead, that weekly journal printed his last article posthumously on 19 June 1971. Entitled &#145;Speaking for the nation&#146; it endorsed some aspects of Enoch Powell's views on immigration and English nationality.<br>
<br>A memorial service was held for Beaton on 28 June at St Bartholomew-the-Great, Smithfield, London. William Rees-Mogg and Alastair Hetherington, the editors of <span class="italic">The Times</span> and <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, the two newspapers which had most nurtured and displayed his talents, read lessons, and the large, diverse congregation was a testimony to what <span class="italic">The Times</span> in its sensitive obituary had characterized as his &#145;huge capacity for friendship&#146;.<br>
