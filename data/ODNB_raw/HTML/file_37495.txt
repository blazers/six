<span class="headword">Gubbins,  Norman Hector Leifchild</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Nathaniel Gubbins]</span>  (1893&#150;1976), <span class="occ">journalist and humorist</span>, was born on 31 May 1893 at 4 Somerset Road, Ealing, Middlesex, the only surviving son (there were also three older daughters, of whom the younger two were twins) of William Gubbins, commercial traveller, formerly an Oxfordshire farmworker who had run away to London at the age of twelve to sell groceries, and his wife, Marie Cecile, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Richards. His father died when he was two. Gubbins was educated at Battersea Polytechnic, but left at sixteen, after the headmaster told his mother that educating him had proved a hopeless task. He began work at 10<i>s</i>. a week in the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> library where, by his own testimony, he spent many miserable years filing cuttings in the wrong envelopes and losing reference books.<br>
<br>Gubbins served in the First World War as a private from August 1914 to February 1919; it was, he later said, an equally unhappy experience, but he was invalided home early, which may well have saved his life. On 4 February 1922 he married Phyllis Magdalen Hughes (<i>b</i>. 1894/5), fashion editor for the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>. She was the daughter of Francis George Hughes, a furnishing company's representative. They had two daughters, Felicity Anne, who died at the age of thirty-eight, and Stephanie, who married Leo Halmsley, the writer. Gubbins's professional career continued to stall, however, as more years of miscasting as a reporter followed before the editor of the <span class="italic">Sunday Express</span>, John Rutherford Gordon, decided he needed a humorous column. Gubbins got the job, he later claimed, because there was no one else in the office at the time. His first column, under the generic strap-line &#145;Sitting on the fence&#146;, appeared on 30 November 1930 on page 3&#151;a star position&#151;and under his new byline, Nathaniel Gubbins, which was to remain with him for life.<br>
<br>The first few weeks were shaky; Gubbins seemed uncertain whether he could pull it off. But he soon got into his stride, and began to develop a whole bestiary of characters who were to delight millions of readers for the next twenty-three years. There was the Worm, apotheosis of the suburban man for whom Gubbins wrote. There was the Sparrow, vehicle for his most sustained and ferocious satire on the sex war (Sparrow dallied with the Other Sparrow at the Tree Tops Club). There was Sally the Cat, his archetypal female, and the Ginger Cat, a tom with all the foibles of its gender. His daughter Stephanie was the acknowledged basis for The Awful Child, forever asking awkward questions. Gubbins also produced a series of brilliant dialogues with his own stomach, which acquired a separate, living, suffering identity as Tum, his gastric <i>Doppelg&auml;nger</i>. (Gubbins suffered from chronic dyspepsia, smoked fifty cigarettes a day, and confessed he found the world intolerable without a glass in his hand.)<br>
<br>Gubbins was at his finest during the Second World War (he mocked his Home Guard service but in truth was an artillery officer at a secret Home Guard site). He was a hero to the Eighth Army, the darling of W. M. Aitken, first Baron Beaverbrook, and the subject of two <span class="italic">Times</span> leaders.<br>
<br>The BBC ran a series of Thursday evening programmes based on his characters in 1944. In 1953 Beaverbrook decided the column had lost its appeal and Gubbins was sacked; he moved to the <span class="italic">Sunday Dispatch</span>, but the transplant did not take. The last twenty years of his life were spent in retirement; indeed, in 1963 he had to write to the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> to point out that he was not, as they had reported, dead. Some thirteen years later, Gubbins succumbed to cancer and heart disease, and died on 3 February 1976 at Victoria Hospital in Deal.<br>
