<span class="headword">Augusta</span> <span class="st"> [Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha]</span>, princess of Wales  (1719&#150;1772), <span class="occ">consort of Frederick Lewis, prince of Wales</span>, was born in Gotha, capital of the German principality of Saxe-Gotha, in Thuringia, on 19 November 1719 <span class="smallcap">OS</span>, the fourth (but second surviving) daughter and thirteenth child of Friedrich II, duke of Saxe-Gotha (1676&#150;1732), and his wife, Magdalena Augusta (1679&#150;1740), daughter of Karl Wilhelm, prince of Anhalt-Zerbst.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandmarriage17191737"></a>Early life and marriage, 1719&#150;1737</h2>Augusta was brought up alongside her younger siblings in Gotha. Following the death of her father in 1732, she moved with her mother to a country house outside the ducal capital. Her elder sister Friederike married her kinsman Johann Adolf, duke of Saxe-Weissenfels, in 1734, and few would have rated Augusta's prospects any higher, coming as she did from a backwater German court.<br>
<br>Augusta's circumstances changed in 1735 when she was summoned to meet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10539/', "George II of Great Britain")</script>, who was passing the summer in his electorate of Hanover. George was under pressure from his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10140/', "Frederick Lewis, prince of Wales (1707&#150;1751)")</script>, and Frederick's advocates in the parliamentary opposition, to find a bride for the prince. After interviewing Augusta he was so impressed by her deference to him, her affability, her apparent good sense and innocence that he quickly decided she was the perfect match for his contentious son. Her mother and her brother Friedrich III readily approved the marriage. The dowager duchess was so unaware of the world outside Saxe-Gotha that she imagined that two decades of Hanoverian monarchs had compelled most of the British court to learn German, and decided that there was no reason for Augusta to study English.<br>
<br>Ill-prepared for her new role, Augusta arrived in Britain on 25 April 1736, and was introduced to Frederick at Greenwich the next day. At their first meeting Augusta pledged total deference to the prince and his wishes, promising only to ask one favour from him&#151;that her governess, whom George II had forbidden to come to Britain, be permitted to join her. Frederick granted the request, and delighted in contrasting his generosity with his father's mean-spirited behaviour. Augusta's decision to share the prince's priorities and be visibly obedient to her husband&#151;so that anyone could see he was no George dominated by a Caroline&#151;made her an ideal consort.<br>
<br>Augusta met George II, and for the first time Caroline, on 27 April 1736, and married Frederick that evening at St James's. Her obvious lack of preparation for life at the royal court, and her inability to communicate with those around her, won her widespread sympathy, including from Caroline, who translated the wedding service for her and prompted her when she had to repeat her vows. Private letters and newspaper paragraphs were full of praise for her conduct. Soon afterwards correspondents to London papers were applauding her graciously condescending behaviour to Londoners she met while travelling around the capital with Frederick to plays, fairs, parades, and banquets.<br>
<br>Augusta presented herself to the king and queen as a well-meaning na&iuml;f who should be pitied, not censured, for falling under Frederick's sway. No one at court was allowed to see beneath her air of innocence. Some mistakenly tried to take advantage of it. Sir Robert Walpole told Caroline that he could see &#145;no way of keeping the Prince within any tolerable bounds but by the Princess&#146;  (Hervey, 2.121) and advised that she be carefully and patiently cultivated. Outside St James's, Augusta's popularity was increased by her rapid mastery of colloquial and formal English. By 1738, when Frederick was praising the spirit and practice of commerce to much applause at a Bristol banquet, Augusta was able to &#145;talk freely to the Ladies in good English, which entirely won their Hearts&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 8, 1738, 603).<br>
<br>Augusta's relationship with the king and queen was threatened by the political breach between Frederick and his parents over George II's refusal to double his subsidy to the &pound;100,000 p.a. George II had enjoyed while a married prince of Wales. She remained on good terms with them by claiming plausibly&#151;if highly improbably&#151;that she had no idea of the divisions in the family. The argument occurred during her first pregnancy, and both reached crisis point at the same time. The prince and princess were at Hampton Court when Augusta suddenly went into labour on 31 July 1737. Determined that their first child would not be born under his parents' roof and would also be a Londoner by birth, Frederick thrust his wife into a coach, and raced over rough roads to St James's. No one had prepared for a royal birth there. It was nearly miraculous that Augusta and her daughter, also Augusta, survived. Enraged, George II expelled Frederick and his family from the royal residences, barred him from court, and informed the world that appearing at the prince's levees would close doors at St James's. Augusta now became one of Frederick's principal assets in the contest for popularity. She received Caroline, who was treated with ostentatious dignity when she visited her, while George II's acts were painted by Frederick as a cruel overreaction that punished a blameless mother and baby.<h2>
<a name="AugustaandFrederick17371751"></a>Augusta and Frederick, 1737&#150;1751</h2>In their own households at last, Augusta and Frederick settled into a domestic routine at Carlton House in London, Cliveden in Buckinghamshire, and Kew in Surrey, that they followed until the prince's death in 1751. During those fourteen years they had eight more children. Only two of the births were difficult. The future <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10540/', "George III")</script> was born two or three weeks prematurely on 24 May 1738; his survival was so despaired of that he was privately baptized the same day. Augusta's sixth child, Louisa, was delivered stillborn on 8 May 1748. Her portraits during this period invariably present her surrounded by her children.<br>
<br>That was no accident. The Waleses carefully staged these sittings to portray themselves in perfect domesticity, a striking contrast to a widowed monarch who was publicly depicted as keeping a mistress at the nation's expense and travelled to Hanover whenever he could manage it. Augusta's popular image was that of the good mother and supportive wife. She never missed an opportunity to burnish it. Thus she was careful to make public her encounter with a Scottish noblewoman who brought her young children with her to plead with the princess for her husband's life after the Jacobite rising in 1745. After listening, &#145;with tenderness and politeness&#146;, to the countess of Cromarty, Augusta left the room briefly, then returned with her own children. &#145;&#147;See, Madam,&#148; she remarked, &#147;what your Lord was trying to do&#151;to rob these innocents of their birthright.&#148; &hellip; &#147;If he had succeeded &hellip;, what kind of treatment could their father expect at your hands?&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">Morning Chronicle and London Advertiser</span>, 28 Feb 1772). Her point made, the princess mercifully helped spare Cromarty's life. The story was published at her death, but almost certainly circulated earlier.<br>
<br>The political usefulness of such vignettes is obvious. Part of their impact stemmed from their basis in observable fact. Frederick and Augusta did try to be solicitous parents who supervised their children's activities and educations closely. Only one note of mild concern was sounded about the Waleses' relationship with their children. Witnesses to the family's life agreed that <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66551/', "Edward Augustus (1739&#150;1767)")</script>, their second son, was his parents' favourite, and that George was stringently criticized and corrected. It went unremarked that this may have been the act of concerned parents who were aware that their less promising child had to be carefully prepared to rule Britain.<br>
<br>Augusta used her public appearances between 1737 and 1751 to assert her attachment to all things British. The most obvious, and easiest, way of accomplishing this was her clothing. People high and low paid close attention to royal fashion, and Augusta always appeared in domestic fabrics. At the celebration of the king's birthday in 1749, &#145;the Prince and Princess of Wales were observed, with great pleasure, by the lovers of their country, to be richly dressed in our own manufacture&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 19, 1749, 519), as was Augusta's established custom. During the next year the Waleses went beyond mere fashion statements. With their two eldest children, they visited weavers in Spitalfields and wool-combers in Cirencester, expressing admiration for their products and promising to encourage their sale. The contrast with the king's court, where French suits and dresses were the rage, could hardly have been greater. Frederick and Augusta underlined it even more by forbidding the wearing of &#145;<i>French</i> stuffs&#146; in their presence  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 18, 1748, 521).<br>
<br>Frederick was active politically throughout the 1740s. Following the fall of Walpole, in which he had a share, in 1742, he was tugged in opposite directions by his two most prominent supporters, John Perceval, second earl of Egmont, and George Dodington. The diaries and memoranda of Egmont and Dodington reveal that Augusta was fully informed about Frederick's activities and plans. Each man tried to recruit her to his tactics and strategy; both used her on occasion as a go-between in discussions with Frederick. The behaviour of Egmont and Dodington reveals that they shared Walpole's opinion, that the best chance of influencing Frederick was to approach him via his wife. They did not realize that, in her role as sympathetic listener and friendly intercessor, she boosted their morale and encouraged their ambitions, thereby helping keep them attached to their always mercurial and often indecisive leader.<br>
<br>George II also guessed that Augusta had achieved considerable sway over her husband and, like Frederick's political friends, sought to use her influence. In February 1742, the king took the extraordinary step of meeting privately with his daughter-in-law to ask a favour. Wishing to spare Walpole a parliamentary inquiry into his handling of secret service funds, he told Augusta that the recent removal of his longtime servant from office should be sufficient victory for the opposition, and requested her aid in persuading Frederick to oppose any investigation. She respectfully declined acting as George's advocate, while promising to convey his appeal to the prince. Unappeased, Frederick continued to press for an inquiry. Nevertheless, the king approved of the princess's &#145;most decent &amp; and prudent behaviour&#146; on this and other occasions, and &#145;notwithstanding his aversion to his Son, behaved to her not only with great Politeness, but with the appearance of cordiality and Affection&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs and Speeches of &hellip; Waldegrave</span>, 162). Her skill at winning and retaining George II's affection stood her in good stead between 1751 and 1756.<h2>
<a name="Theprincesmother17511756"></a>The prince's mother, 1751&#150;1756</h2>Frederick suddenly and unexpectedly died on 20 March 1751. Mastering her shock, Augusta immediately sent for Egmont and ordered him to bring compromising political papers from Carlton House to her. When he did, she burnt documents in Frederick's handwriting. With this act the princess destroyed any evidence of her past participation in opposition politics, and unmistakably signalled her own determination to steer clear of any involvement in them in the future. When rumours about Egmont's errand immediately spread in political circles, she even hinted that the earl had been principally concerned to protect himself. She drove her point home further by refusing to see him publicly or privately.<br>
<br>At the same time as Augusta cut herself off from opposition politics, she threw herself on the mercy of the king. He obliged by telling the new heir apparent that his mother was &#145;the best of women&#146;. Then he &#145;embraced the Princess, desired nobody might come between him and her, and [said] he would do everything for her&#146;  (Newman, 207). Augusta enjoyed the annual income of &pound;50,000, guaranteed by parliament in 1737, unmolested, and true to his promise George II vigorously supported legislation to make Augusta regent in the event of his death before her eldest son was eighteen. He also allowed the young prince and his brother Edward to continue living within her household.<br>
<br>These were considerable and crucial victories for the princess dowager of Wales. They did not, however, make her feel perfectly secure about the future. The <span class="roman">Regency Act</span> of 1751 denied the most important prerogatives of a reigning monarch to Augusta. It established an advisory council, and forbade her from making any major decisions without this body's consent. Most notably, the princess dowager could not dissolve parliament or declare war without its approval.<br>
<br>Had Augusta been permitted to appoint some of Frederick's political allies to the council, its existence would have been comforting to her, but George II and his ministers would not agree to that, nor would they let her suggest candidates or argue against those she did not want. Predictably no friends of her late husband were named in the <span class="roman">Regency Act</span> as members of the council. Particularly ominous to her was the presence on it of the man she and Frederick had regarded as his greatest enemy, his brother William, duke of Cumberland, who represented to Augusta the threat of military dictatorship, and had consistently opposed Frederick's allies inside and outside parliament. It was easy for Augusta to believe that, if her brother-in-law could manage it, he would take advantage of a regency to usurp the throne.<br>
<br>The goals of Augusta's politics from 1751 until George came of age in 1756 were to diminish Cumberland's power at Whitehall and Westminster and to prevent her son from falling under his control. To hope to achieve this, she had to keep the young prince of Wales in her household. Equally crucial to her design was raising her son to be what her husband had aimed at being, the patriotic monarch described in Viscount Bolingbroke's 1749 book, <span class="italic">Idea of a Patriot King</span>. Convinced that only she would train him to be sufficiently moral to achieve that ideal, she had to anticipate and prevent any attempts to move him to St James's.<br>
<br>Augusta had to hide her contempt for what she felt was George II's undue subservience to his ministers and her anger at his penny-pinching frugality with funds for the prince of Wales's establishment. She also had to conceal her hatred for Thomas Pelham-Holles, duke of Newcastle, whom she believed to be too timid in dealing with Cumberland and his parliamentary supporters. Finally, she left unspoken her concern about the pedagogical and moral shortcomings of the prince's tutors and governors. Some&#151;Thomas Hayter, bishop of Norwich, for example&#151;she disdained for their latitudinarianism. Others&#151;Simon, first Earl Harcourt, and James, second Earl Waldegrave&#151;she scorned for their cynical emphasis on worldly knowledge and behaviour and their total failure to inspire in George closer attention to his studies. And she was troubled by disputes in the press and in parliament in 1752&#150;3 about the alleged Jacobitism of some of the prince's tutors. Although she gave these baseless charges far more credence than they deserved, she correctly recognized the more serious threat this controversy posed. If she were to intervene in it, there was reason to believe some politicians might stigmatize that intervention as improper, and use that pretext to convince the king to take her sons away from her.<br>
<br>To guard George's morality Augusta kept him as isolated as she possibly could from court society and, indeed, most of life outside the narrow confines of his residence at <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96922', "Leicester House")</script>. In her opinion the young people he would come in contact with were vice-ridden and ill-educated. In particular she took care to keep her son apart from women, reasoning that sexual attraction and temptation posed the greatest dangers to her own instruction and example. On the positive side Augusta stressed the necessity of a rigorous obedience to protestant morality. It pleased her deeply to note that her strategy was working, and he had become &#145;not a wild, dissipated boy, but good natur'd, and cheerful, but with a serious cast&#146;  (<span class="italic">Political Journal of &hellip; Dodington</span>, 318). Still, &#145;she wish'd he were a little more forward, and less childish, at his age&#146;  (ibid., 178). George's lack of progress at his schoolwork worried her too. Most importantly for Augusta, she was aware she did not have the knowledge or experience to teach her son the business of being king and believed that her sex disqualified her from initiating him into the intensely masculine worlds of politics and government. She did at least have the chance to choose the man who would undertake these tasks.<br>
<br>Augusta realized there were only two possible candidates. Dodington knew the prince, and had even discussed public finance with him. The two had not, however, established any rapport, and without that there was no prospect that George would respond to even the soundest lessons from the finest of politicians, any more than he responded to the less able men who were presently failing to instruct him. Augusta doubted Dodington would reinforce her ideals of public and private morality, and she distrusted his political motives so much that she never confided her own manoeuvres to him. This left John Stuart, third earl of Bute.<br>
<br>Had Frederick lived to become king, in all likelihood Bute would have played an important role in handling Scottish patronage, taking the duke of Argyll's place as manager of the king's business in Scotland. Bute had spent considerable time at Frederick's court, and Augusta recalled that the three had shared the same political ideas. More importantly, she appreciated his loyalty to her and her children after Frederick's death. Sure of his loyalty, confident in his discretion, Augusta asked the earl in 1755 to tutor the prince of Wales in secret.<br>
<br>At that time this was a perfect choice. Bute won the confidence of the young man, and inspired him both to study hard and to believe in himself. The two became mentor and prot&eacute;g&eacute;. To borrow George's own words, they were the dearest of friends. Augusta was ecstatic. She had found the perfect man to mould her son into a &#145;patriot king&#146;. So happy was she that she dropped her usually reserved demeanour, and glowed with obvious delight when she saw Bute at court. Her unguarded expressions of joy, plus the subterfuge she and he adopted that the earl was visiting her, not George, when he went up the back stairs to tutor the prince, led to speculation that the two were lovers. Rumours about them spread rapidly at court. Then, when the prince stunned the political world by announcing when he became eighteen in 1756 that he wanted an obscure Scottish lord named as his groom of the stole, gossip exploded beyond the court into the wider political world. Politicians, Grub Street hacks, and caricaturists explained Bute's apparently unmerited ascent into the first rank of politicians as the result of sleeping with the mother and using her influence to dominate the son. The political alliance centred at Leicester House should not, insisted the wit George Selwyn, be called a faction. Rather, it was a &#145;fuction&#146;  (Bullion, &#145;Augusta and Bute&#146;, 247).<br>
<br>No one but Augusta and Bute will ever know the true nature of their friendship. George furiously defended his mother's chastity and his dearest friend's honour during the 1750s, and nursed grudges against their accusers as late as 1802. Modern scholars of the period unanimously believe he was correct when he denied they committed adultery. However compelling this conclusion seems today, enough people disagreed during Augusta's lifetime to blacken her reputation from the mid-1750s until well after her death in 1772. Did she know she was risking this fate when she hid Bute's contacts with the future George III by pretending he was spending hours alone with her? If she did, hers was a remarkable act of maternal courage and commitment to her son's future.<h2>
<a name="Lastyears17561772"></a>Last years, 1756&#150;1772</h2>After George came of age in 1756 Augusta led a relatively secluded and frugal life at Carlton House and at Kew. The ironies of her situation must have struck her, though there is no indication she ever commented on them, let alone complained. Once a favourite of Londoners, now she rarely attended the theatre and infrequently journeyed around the metropolis, thus avoiding vociferous insult if not outright attack from a populace who regarded her as a scandalous woman who sought to rule the country by secret influence. Under these circumstances Augusta preferred to keep her charitable donations to the poor anonymous. When the extent and generosity of her gifts became known after her death, London newspapers remarked that the recipients of her charity would be surprised to learn their benefactress's name and dismayed to discover that the payments were at an end. The remainder of her disposable income went to improve the buildings and grounds of the botanical garden at Kew, begun by Frederick and Augusta. After the prince's death Bute encouraged Augusta and her eldest son to develop them further. In her last years the princess continued this tradition.<br>
<br>The extent and quality of Augusta's involvement in the lives of her other children after 1756 went mostly unnoticed and unrecorded. Of the eight, only George's fate could have pleased her. Three died young: Louisa at birth, Elizabeth (1740&#150;1759) at eighteen, and Frederick (1750&#150;1765) at fifteen. No son, other than George III, adopted the moral standards she tried to teach them all. Perhaps tellingly, all of George's brothers disliked Bute, which may point to suspicions they had about their mother's morality. Edward grieved her by plunging into sexual adventures with whores and married women as soon as he could, embracing latitudinarianism in opposition to her strict Anglicanism, and estranging himself from George III as rapidly as possible. Before he died he had become openly a part of the parliamentary opposition to the king's ministers. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29456/', "William Henry (1743&#150;1805)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12963/', "Henry Frederick (1745&#150;1790)")</script> survived their mother. Before her death both were publicly leading dissolute lives and, in defiance of long practice and good politics, had secretly married British commoners. Augusta refused to see Henry on her death bed in 1772; William was abroad and his marriage had not been disclosed.<br>
<br>The sadness and frustration the princess dowager felt as a result of her sons' behaviour were not allayed by her two adult daughters' experiences. The marriages that George III arranged for them were extremely unhappy. Augusta (1737&#150;1813) wed Charles, duke of Brunswick, in 1764, but he proved erratic, demanding, and unfaithful, making his wife miserable. The husband of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4721/', "Caroline Matilda (1751&#150;1775)")</script>, the insane Christian VII of Denmark, was worse. Concerned for her daughters, Augusta travelled to the continent in 1770. Ostensibly this was a social visit; in reality she wanted to assess their situations for herself, listen to their reactions, and then counsel them to behave prudently and with dignity. Augusta took her mother's lessons to heart, but Caroline, who had begun an affair with the court physician Struensee, did not.<br>
<br>The princess's return to England touched off a renewal of accusations in and out of parliament that she &#145;was the real cause of all the calamities which had befallen this country for these last ten unfortunate years&#146; and calls for inquiries into her conduct  (Brooke, 266). In fact she had played no direct role in politics since Bute became her son's &#145;dearest Friend&#146; in 1755. This did not distress George III, who preferred that his mother stay out of politics, and in 1765 had intended to exclude her from the terms of a new regency bill. Cumberland had also been excluded, as George reasoned his uncle and mother would renew their bitter struggles of the early 1750s, leading to the creation of factions at court and parliament supporting each of the opposed members of the royal family. When Cumberland and George III became reconciled in a bid to replace the ministry of George Grenville, George relented and instructed government supporters in the Commons to help pass an amendment to the <span class="roman">Regency Bill</span> proposed by John Morton, a former member of Frederick's party, which would include Augusta on the regency council. Augusta appreciated Morton's mark of respect for her and her late husband, the more so because she had not asked their old supporter to make his motion. She had no illusions about the reason for her son's decision and Morton's success. It was not due to any meaningful softening of opinions about her. The king had moved her around the board like a pawn, ready to sacrifice her whenever it suited his overall strategy in the match, and uncaring how this exposed her own political impotence. The majority had simply realized that in the unlikely event of a regency, Queen Charlotte's elevation to regent and Cumberland's return to the royal family's fold meant the princess dowager would be powerless to affect either the rearing of an infant monarch or the ruling of Britain.<br>
<br>By the autumn of 1771 it was obvious that Augusta was terminally ill with cancer of the throat. George III steeled himself in November against the possibility that she could die any day, and philosophized that &#145;it is almost cruel to wish to see her long continue&#146;  (Brooke, 267) in this condition. The princess wanted the duchess of Brunswick to come and be with her at the end, and because George was convinced this would not be &#145;a thing of long duration&#146;, he agreed to the request  (ibid.). Perhaps fortified by her eldest child's presence, the dowager princess of Wales stoically fought off death until February. During the last week she could not eat or speak. Despite great weakness and pain, the evening before she died she gallantly signalled that she be dressed and seated in a chair so that she could receive the king and queen properly. Convinced that death was imminent, they spent that night at Carlton House. Early in the morning of 8 February 1772 an attendant discovered that Augusta had died. On 15 February her remains were interred at Westminster Abbey.<br>
<br>Augusta's funeral was the final irony of her political life. Pickpockets swarmed through the onlookers, and took advantage of the darkness in the Henry VII chapel to prey upon the official mourners. Others in the crowd tore the black bunting from the scaffolding and the bier. They were motivated not merely by hatred of Bute's presumed lover, but also by anger at George III. London's textile workers feared that the lengthy deep mourning the king had imposed on the court and society to honour his mother would drastically reduce the sale of British-made suits and dresses for the winter and spring seasons. With her husband Augusta had been the most famous champion of British manufactures, gaining popularity as a consequence. After her death she was scorned as the cause of misery for the same interest. Her last rites became the final reminders of her fall in the public's mind from a patriotic queen-in-waiting to an immoral, power-hungry, and sinister princess dowager.<h2>
<a name="Historicalsignificance"></a>Historical significance</h2>Many of Augusta's contemporaries would have deprecated her impact: by raising Bute to power she had supposedly set in motion events that confused British politics, diminished the prestige and popularity of an attractive young man who was born in Britain and gloried in its name, and wounded the constitution. Some would have added that she exercised, with Bute, a tight control over George III and a malign influence on the nation's politics until her death. But these interpretations miss two important points.<br>
<br>First, Augusta's career vividly displays how fascinated the public was with royal lives. When she was a public figure, assessing the people's desires and presenting herself, her husband, and her family accordingly, she and they were gratifyingly popular. An important part of their appeal was their moral and peaceful domestic life. When Augusta felt compelled to isolate Prince George and herself from the world, and behaved in a way that suggested an immoral private life, her reputation plummeted. To be popular, royalty had to be public figures who led exemplary private lives.<br>
<br>This insight points to Augusta's most consequential contribution to her adopted country. She convinced her eldest son to be chaste before marriage and faithful during it. She taught him how important it was to involve his spouse and his children in the public rituals of monarchy. She instilled in him a deep commitment to Anglican morality and faith. All of these domestic virtues&#151;many of them scorned by the worldly during the 1740s and 1750s as womanish in nature&#151;substantially increased his popularity during the 1780s and 1790s. They helped him become the national symbol of resistance to revolution and Bonapartism. Augusta did not simply teach her son how to be a king. Her example and morality ultimately ensured he would remain one. Subsequent monarchs either profited from this example, or ignored it at the peril of their crowns.<br>
