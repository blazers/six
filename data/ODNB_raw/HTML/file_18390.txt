<span class="headword">Mawbey, Sir  Joseph</span>  (1730&#150;1798), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Ravenstone House, Leicestershire, on 2 December 1730, the fourth son and youngest child of John Mawbey (<i>d</i>. 1754) and his second wife, Martha (<i>d</i>. 1737), the daughter of Thomas Pratt. When he was about ten years old he was taken to Surrey by an uncle, Joseph Pratt, the chief owner of a vinegar distillery at Vauxhall, to be trained for the ministry of the English church. At the age of seventeen, however, he joined the family business on account of the serious illness of a cousin who was a partner in the distillery. Together with his brother John, Mawbey carried on the business, and became joint owner on his uncle's death in 1754. The firm made him a wealthy man, and it was estimated that its profits were &#145;sufficient to yield more than &pound;600,000 per annum to government in subsidies&#146;  (Burke, 347). Mawbey also inherited considerable property in Surrey from his uncle and established himself as a landed proprietor; he served as sheriff of the county in 1757. On 21 August 1760 he married Elizabeth Pratt (<i>d</i>. 1790), the only surviving daughter of his cousin Richard Pratt of Vauxhall. He bought the estate of Botleys in Chertsey in 1763, and commissioned Kenton Couse to build a large Palladian house. He retired from business in 1775, having inherited another large estate upon the death of his brother-in-law Joseph Pratt in 1766. In 1770 he became chairman of the Surrey quarter sessions, a position he held for twenty-seven years. He acted in this role on the whole successfully, although he was unpopular with the gentry of the county, who considered him something of an upstart.<br>
<br>On 1 April 1761 Mawbey was elected MP for Southwark, a seat which he held until the general election of 1774, when he contested the county of Surrey. Through the coalition of the interests of four other candidates he was defeated, even though 1390 votes were given for him, but he went on to win the seat at the by-election in June 1775. He topped the poll again in 1780, when he incurred the odium of some of his whig supporters through his refusal to coalesce with the opposition candidate, Admiral Keppel. In April 1784 he was returned without a contest.<br>
<br>Mawbey was associated with the Rockingham whigs in the early part of his political career, and he was rewarded by the Rockingham ministry with a baronetcy on 30 July 1765. But he increasingly gave his support to Wilkes and the radical cause. He presented Wilkes's petition on 14 November 1768, protesting about the treatment he had received in the <span class="italic">North Briton</span> no. 45 case. He was a founder member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/73620', "Society of Gentleman Supporters of the Bill of Rights")</script> and a leading light in the petitioning movement of 1769&#150;70, which sought to press the injustice with which Wilkes was treated in being expelled by the Commons as a member of parliament. He was an instigator of the petitions from his own county of Surrey and from his seat in Southwark, and was also heavily involved in organizing the petitions from Essex, Berwick, and York.<br>
<br>Mawbey played a role in the <i>Printers' case</i> which exercised parliament the following year. Wilkes, now an alderman of the City of London, wanted a confrontation with parliament, and Mawbey moved to have him summoned before the House of Commons to answer charges of falsely imprisoning a messenger of the house. The Commons wisely resisted this trap, despite Mawbey's later assertion that Wilkes had a right to attend the Commons &#145;in his place&#146;  (Almon, 9.251&#150;6).<br>
<br>Later in his career Mawbey continued on the radical side of politics and was a leading figure in the Association movement, which sought to press major reform measures on the government. He did not follow the Foxite strand of whiggism after 1783, and instead became a supporter first of Shelburne's ministry and then of Pitt's. He left politics in 1790, feeling betrayed by Pitt's administration, which had failed to support his unsuccessful election campaign of that year.<br>
<br>Mawbey was a frequent speaker in the Commons, and so attracted the attention of the wits. Because he professed to be above party, he was ridiculed by speakers and writers on both sides. Walpole called him &#145;vain, noisy, and foolish&#146;. Among the best-known lines in the &#145;Rolliad&#146;, a popular prose piece of the time, are those referring to Speaker Cornwall's &#145;unhappy fate&#146; who hears Fox, North, and Burke, but hears Sir Joseph too. Wraxall was more charitable in his assessment, remarking that Mawbey &#145;could never obtain a patient &hellip; hearing in Parliament&#146;, yet &#145;spoke, nevertheless with great good sense though not with brilliancy&#146;.<br>
<br>For many years Mawbey was a contributor in verse and prose to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>. He wrote on both political and personal subjects; he published a poem mourning the death of his wife, who died after a long illness on 19 August 1790. Mawbey died at Botleys on 16 June 1798 and was buried beside his wife and several of his children in the family vault in the chancel of Chertsey church, Surrey.<br>
