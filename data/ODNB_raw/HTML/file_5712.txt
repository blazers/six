<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Clough,  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1570), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was the fifth and youngest son of Richard Clough, a Denbigh glover, who by two advantageous marriages, first to the daughter of Humphrey Holland and then to a Whittington of Chester, rose in fame and fortune. Of the younger Richard's early life little is known apart from certain possibly apocryphal stories. In his boyhood he allegedly went to be a chorister in the city of Chester, but lacking an outlet for his musical talents there, made his way, probably in his early teens, to London. From there, in the fervour of youthful zeal, he is said to have made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, where it is related he was created a knight of the Holy Sepulchre, a title which, if actually awarded, he probably never used in the atmosphere of religious intolerance which pervaded the London to which he returned possibly about 1545. As an apprentice mercer in London from about 1545 to 1552 Clough seems to have developed a protective fa&ccedil;ade, presenting himself when required as that deferential and rather pedestrian creature who from 1552 moved easily in the circles of the newly appointed royal agent in the Netherlands, Thomas Gresham.<br>
<br>Clough's appointment to the &#145;House of Gresham&#146; was occasioned by the departure of Robert Berney, who, having served William Read and then Gresham faithfully at Antwerp for at least ten years, in 1552 decided to establish his own mercantile house. In taking up residence at Antwerp, Clough thus became the new boy in a long-established network of factors and agents serving Gresham in his joint capacities as merchant and financial agent for the crown. His counterpart at the opposite end of the Antwerp&#150;London axis, which formed the main highway for the house's business transactions, was John Elliot, who continued during the years 1552&#150;7 to oversee the firm's business at its London office in Lombard Street. They were assisted by Francis Tomazo, who from 1549 to 1554 carried the company's dispatches between the two commercial centres, and William Bindlowe and John Spritewell, who from 1547 to 1554 and from 1550 to 1555 respectively were entrusted with the much more delicate task of accompanying supplies of bullion and armaments during their often illicit passage from Antwerp to London.<br>
<br>From 1557 changing circumstances raised Clough's position within the firm. Against a background of major personnel changes, which made him one of the longest serving members of the team, the temporary closure of Gresham's Seville office brought the Anglo-Netherlands trade to the forefront of the firm's commercial activities. His position was strengthened by the subordination of that trade to Gresham's increasingly important financial business on behalf of the crown. In the aftermath of the 1557 imperial bankruptcy, Antwerp's money markets underwent a major transformation. The city was no longer subject to the depredations of the Habsburgs, who henceforth secured their funds from dealings on the Sevillian&#150;Genoese financial axis, and its financial prosperity now rested on the provision of commercial investments. Clough's mercantile connections, developed in his capacity as both private merchant and factor for the House of Gresham, could now be exploited by his master in his commercial and in his financial dealings. They could also be used and extended by Gresham's mentor, Sir William Cecil, as from 1558 he began to build an intelligence network to report on political conditions in the increasingly troubled Low Countries. Clough was rapidly becoming the central figure in a completely remodelled network. His new counterpart at the opposite end of the Antwerp&#150;London axis, along which now passed a flow of political intelligence as well as news of mercantile-financial transactions, was Richard Candeler, a member of a respectable Norfolk family, who from 1557 to 1566 acted as Gresham's factor in the English capital. The two men utilized the services of another of Gresham's servants, John Spritewell, the company's carrier of dispatches. Gresham thus had at the core of his business a formidable team, headed by Clough, which was quite capable of handling not only his increasingly important financial business on behalf of the crown but also his residual commercial activities in the city on the Scheldt. As the House of Gresham became a front for Cecil's intelligence operations, Clough became a key figure in an extended network of agents scattered throughout the Low Countries.<br>
<br>The years 1557 to 1569 thus witnessed Clough's assumption of a central role in the operations of the House of Gresham. They also saw a growing intimacy pervade his relations with his master. Yet at no stage during these years did he display any executive abilities in the work he undertook for Gresham. In his continuing capacity as an independent mercer-adventurer he performed small commercial favours for his master or the latter's political patrons. No more taxing were his duties as bookkeeper in relation to his master's increasingly important financial business on behalf of the crown. On occasion he was required to store at Antwerp munitions and other items bought from the proceeds of loans, but their subsequent transmission to England was undertaken on Gresham's personal responsibility. In relation to Clough, as with his other servants, Gresham was singularly incapable of devolving managerial responsibilities. It is thus surprising to find that in 1560, having undertaken preliminary negotiations for a loan worth some &pound;75,000 with Hans Keck, the agent of Herzog Christoff Albrecht of Mansfeld, Gresham dispatched Clough to Saxony to conclude the deal. His factor's singular inability to perform this task, and Gresham's resulting discomfiture, ensured that the latter would never again entrust the hapless Clough with such weighty responsibilities. Throughout the final decade of his employment by Gresham, Clough was restricted to the pedestrian duties associated with the running of his master's Antwerp office.<br>
<br>For fifteen years (1552&#150;67) Clough thus served his master, and latterly Sir William Cecil, with diligence but little imagination, and in due course was suitably rewarded for his efforts. He obtained in 1564 a substantial grant of leaseholds in Wales to augment the income from those Denbigh properties on which he had commenced to build the mansion at Bachegraig and the smaller but more elegant Clough Hall (Plas Clough), which were both completed in 1567. By his mid-thirties he had become a man of substance in his native country, his newly acquired wealth giving him some degree of independence and allowing him to dispense with that fa&ccedil;ade which he had so carefully constructed some twenty years earlier. 1567 saw the romantic, sensitive young man of the stories reappear to public view as he commenced on a completely uncharacteristic course of action. In three short weeks, between 16 April and the 7 May 1567, this pedestrian servant was transformed. He made only a cursory duty call on Gresham before departing post-haste for Wales where, after a whirlwind romance, he married the beautiful and recently widowed Katherine Tudor (<i>d</i>. 27 Aug 1591), the sole daughter and heir of Tudor ap Robert Fychan of Berain and his wife, a granddaughter of Henry VII. The couple then immediately left for London, pausing briefly at Gresham House before continuing their journey to Antwerp. Over the next three years, whether acting as Gresham's factor at Antwerp (May 1567&#150;March 1569) or serving in an independent capacity the following year as deputy of the Company of Merchant Adventurers at their new Hamburg mart, to which the English traders had moved on being ejected from Antwerp, Clough found his lifestyle utterly changed. His household in these cities, presided over by the beautiful Katherine, included Richard and Winefrid Clough, whom their father mentions as his &#145;base children, forren born&#146;, and Thomas Dutton and Thomas Denne, kin-related &#145;gossips&#146; of the principal factor. It was augmented as Katherine gave birth in rapid succession to two daughters&#151;Anne in 1568 and Mary in the early part of the ensuing year. Supported by a loving wife and revelling in the company of his children and associates, Clough in his actions during the last three years of his life manifested a personality change. His correspondence, previously controlled and somewhat pedantic in character, now displayed a marked volatility in style related to his rapidly changing moods. Thus, laid low during a serious illness shortly after his return to Antwerp in December 1567, he was certainly prepared for the first time to neglect his work and excuse himself to his master on the grounds of his health. On the occasion of his next and final illness, during the period February&#150;March 1570, he did not even bother to excuse himself when important diplomatic dispatches went missing. These were difficult times when his letters to Cecil were uniformly dark and mysterious. There were also good times, however, as when in September 1568 he declared he was &#145;in right good health and merry&#146;.<br>
<br>Yet the past was not easily swept away, as the compilation of Clough's will reveals. First composed on 20 September 1568, when he was enjoying both good health and considerable prosperity, the document reflected his present concerns, as, in a happy frame of mind, he left his possessions to his wife and children. Yet health and cheerfulness were but transient states, and, as from February 1570 his health finally deteriorated, something of his associated change of mind may be discerned in the proliferation of codicils and the creation on the 26th of that month, with death imminent, of a new document. In his adversity the past weighed heavily on him and, forgetting his recent happiness and remembering &#145;the time of [his] service under and with [his] master&#146;, he disinherited his family and gave to Gresham all his moveable goods. He died in Hamburg in March 1570 and was buried there. To Gresham's credit, he renounced the last will, allowing the earlier will to be proved to the benefit of Clough's family.<br>
