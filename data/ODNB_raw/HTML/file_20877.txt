<span class="headword">Osborne,  George Alexander</span>  (1806&#150;1893), <span class="occ">pianist and composer</span>, born on 24 September 1806 at Limerick, was the third son of the organist and a vicar-choral of Limerick Cathedral, and his wife, a member of the MacMahon family. As a boy he received organ lessons from his father, and when barely fourteen he was able to take the latter's place occasionally on the organ bench. With no definite idea of adopting the profession of music, when he was about eighteen he was sent by his father to Brussels to visit a sick aunt. A spirited account of his journey was published in the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Musical Association</span> (9, 1882&#150;3, 95&#150;113), in a paper entitled &#145;Musical coincidences and reminiscences&#146;. Osborne remained in Brussels for several years, which he recollected as &#145;wearisome years of study and anxiety&#146;  (<span class="italic">Proceedings of the Musical Association</span>, 9.97). At first he was intended for holy orders, and, with this in view, he attended the classes at Prince's classical academy. While he was a pupil there his skill as a musician attracted the attention of several prominent persons, among whom was the prince de Chimay, an able and enthusiastic musical amateur, and husband of the former Madame Tallien, of French Revolution fame. Osborne soon became a frequenter of the prince's ch&acirc;teau, where he met many prominent writers and musicians, including George Sand, F.-J. F&eacute;tis, Luigi Cherubini, and Daniel Auber, and where he benefited from a study of the music in the prince's library. At the Ch&acirc;teau de Chimay he often conducted performances of his own and other compositions by the prince's private orchestra, which included masses by Cherubini in the chapel.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Osborne's theological studies were pursued with lessening interest, and when he was twenty years old he finally decided to adopt music as his profession. In this step he was warmly supported by the prince de Chimay, who procured for him the appointment of instructor to the eldest son of the prince of Orange, who was later to become king of Holland. In Brussels, as chapel-master to the prince of Orange, Osborne directed many successful concerts, at one of which he met the violinist Charles Auguste de B&eacute;riot and accompanied the singer Maria Malibran, who in 1836 became B&eacute;riot's wife. B&eacute;riot and Osborne became close friends, and together they composed thirty-three duets for violin and piano, many of which enjoyed a great vogue for a time.<br>
<br>During the Belgian revolution of 1830 Osborne figured as a volunteer on the royalist side, and it is related that an attempt to shoot him was frustrated only by a defect in his assailant's gun. He was, however, made a prisoner, but released at the intercession of the prince. In 1831 Osborne went to Paris, where he lived for years in close contact with Cherubini, Auber, Stephen Heller, Liszt, and the violinist Heinrich Wilhelm Ernst. With Berlioz and Chopin he was particularly well acquainted, and he published his reminiscences of them, as well as some autobiographical matter, in two papers read before the Musical Association on 3 February 1879 and 5 April 1880  (<span class="italic">Proceedings of the Musical Association</span>, 5, 1879&#150;80, 60&#150;75, 6, 1880&#150;81, 91&#150;105). Osborne was one of the four pianists who played the accompaniments to Chopin's F minor concerto on the piano (the composer playing the solo part) at the famous concert in Paris on 26 February 1832. When Berlioz and Chopin visited England, Osborne spent much time with them.<br>
<br>While living in Paris, Osborne continued his musical studies under Johann Peter Pixis, F&eacute;tis, Antoine Reicha, and Friedrich Kalkbrenner. At the same time he wrote a large number of compositions, chiefly piano music of a light character. His sister Bessie Osborne, later Mrs Hampton, an amateur singer, visited him in Paris and became fashionable for her renditions of Irish melodies at social gatherings. In 1844 and 1845 Osborne spent some time in London and gave several concerts there. He made the city his permanent home from the end of 1847, when the threat of revolution forced him to relinquish his house in Paris. He paid a brief visit to Ireland in 1848. By the time of his establishment in London, Osborne had already published his piano piece <span class="italic">La pluie de perles</span>, which was said to have brought him several thousand pounds, twelve different publishers being licensed by him to produce editions of it. Its popularity gained for him numerous pupils in London, where his vogue as a teacher lasted almost until his death. Osborne also played frequently in public, making tours of the provinces with distinguished artists. Although upwards of eighty years of age, he made his last appearance in public at a concert of the Wind Instrument Society on 15 November 1889. He died at his residence, 5 Ulster Terrace, Regent's Park, on 16 November 1893, and was buried in Highgate cemetery. He left at least one son, George.<br>
<br>Osborne excelled in his performances of Bach, and many young musicians sought his advice as to the correct manner of playing Chopin. He was one of the first English musicians to recognize the importance of the music of Schumann and Brahms, and to present a positive critical response to Wagner; he conducted the first performance in England of a work by Wagner, an orchestral arrangement made from the piano score of the march from <span class="italic">Tannh&auml;user</span>, at a concert of the Amateur Musical Society at the Hanover Square Rooms in April 1854. In 1876 he visited Bayreuth. Besides numerous piano fantasias and transcriptions, mostly derived from well-known operas, Osborne composed three overtures (one of which, <span class="italic">The Forest Maiden</span>, was written for the Brighton festival of 1875 and performed at the Alexandra Palace in 1876), two operas (of which <span class="italic">Sylvia</span> was rehearsed at Drury Lane but never performed), a few songs, and some accomplished chamber music, including a sextet (op. 63, for piano, flute, oboe, horn, cello, and double bass, published in Paris <i>c</i>.1840), three piano trios and several string quartets (all unpublished), and a cello sonata (published in London in 1876). His music lacks originality, but is accomplished and possessed considerable popular appeal. While living in Belgium, Osborne was decorated by the king with the order of the Oak-Crown. He was also a member of the Philharmonic Society of London, a director of the Royal Academy of Music, and for years a prominent member of the Musical Association. He was a genial and kind friend to young musicians, and an admirable public speaker, especially when speaking extemporaneously. His cheerful nature, delightful sense of humour, and pleasant Irish brogue were all noted by his contemporaries, and Charles Villiers Stanford described him as &#145;that most excellent of men and most delightful of companions&#146;  (Stanford, <span class="italic">Studies and Memories</span>, 123).<br>
