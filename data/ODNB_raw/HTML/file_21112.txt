<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Paget <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Bayly]</span>,  Henry William</span>, first marquess of Anglesey  (1768&#150;1854), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was born on 17 May 1768 in London, probably at Uxbridge House, Burlington Gardens, the eldest of the twelve children of Henry Bayly (1744&#150;1812) and his wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1817), daughter of Arthur Champagne, dean of Clonmacnoise, Ireland, and his wife, Marianne. By a tortuous line of descent from William, first Baron Paget (1505&#150;1563), Henry Bayly became in 1770 the tenth Baron Paget (taking by royal licence the name Paget in place of Bayly) and, in 1784, the first earl of Uxbridge of the second creation.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlymilitarycareer"></a>Education and early military career</h2>Henry William Bayly, as he then was, attended Westminster School, London, in 1777 and, as Lord Paget, Christ Church, Oxford, in 1784. After a two-year grand tour in Europe, he was elected unopposed for Caernarfon boroughs in 1790 and for Milborne Port, Somerset, in 1796. These he represented silently until succeeding to the earldom in 1812. Soon after the outbreak of war with France he raised, at the age of twenty-four, the 80th foot, largely from his father's tenantry. In June 1794 the regiment went to Flanders, joining the duke of York's army there. At Meteren on 30 December he had his baptism of fire, leading his regiment in a successful charge. During the army's disastrous retreat he found himself commanding an infantry brigade after only one year's service. On 25 July 1795 he married Lady Caroline Elizabeth Villiers (1774&#150;1835), known as Car, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28295/', "George Bussy Villiers, fourth earl of Jersey")</script>; they had three sons and five daughters.<br>
<br>In 1795 Paget, so as to achieve permanent rank without purchasing it, ran speedily (on paper) through all the ranks from lieutenant to colonel-in-the-army. In 1797 he obtained &#145;the height of his ambition&#146;&#151;command of the 7th (Queen's Own) light dragoons. He became full colonel of the regiment in 1801, remaining thus for forty-five years.<br>
<br>Paget commanded the cavalry brigade in the ill-fated Anglo-Russian Helder campaign in the Netherlands in 1799. Near Egmont-op-Zee on 2 October he first made his name as an enterprising cavalryman; through a speedy reaction he destroyed a French formation led by General Vandamme. On 6 October at Castricum he ambushed a superior body of enemy cavalry, which resulted in a complete rout and hundreds of soldiers taken prisoner. Over the next eight years he turned his regiment into one of the most efficient in the army. In 1802 he was promoted major-general and in 1808 lieutenant-general. At about this time he was gaining the reputation of a dandy: in the 7th light dragoons he set a famously high sartorial standard, and up to his death, seventeen years into the Victorian era, he still wore his unfashionable Regency &#145;Paget blue coat&#146;.<h2>
<a name="CommandingthecavalryinthePeninsularWar"></a>Commanding the cavalry in the Peninsular War</h2>In 1808, on Sir John Moore's being given command of a 20,000-strong expeditionary force to Spain, Paget obtained command of the cavalry of Sir David Baird's 19,000-strong force sent to Corunna to join Moore's marching up from Lisbon. Napoleon's rapid advance and his complete overthrow of the Spanish armies that Moore was to have succoured, led to the necessity for an immediate retreat, of Baird to Corunna and of Moore to Lisbon. Moore desired Baird to send him a regiment of cavalry. Instead, Paget persuaded Baird to let him have three cavalry regiments and six horse artillery guns to make &#145;a rapid march over an immense plain &hellip; overrun by the enemy's cavalry&#146;  (Paget and Paget, 113&#150;14).<br>
<br>Meanwhile, it was learned that Napoleon, believing that Moore and Baird were in full flight, had decided to march on Madrid, leaving only Marshal Soult's 18,000 men in the north-west. Moore's and Baird's armies met at Mayorga on 20 December 1808. So successful was Paget in masking the junction that Soult was quite unaware that it had taken place. Next morning there followed what Charles Oman described as &#145;perhaps the most brilliant exploit of the British cavalry during the whole six years of the [Peninsular] war&#146;  (Oman, 536). At Sahag&uacute;n Paget totally surprised a French cavalry brigade, charging with only the 15th hussars and killing or capturing 500 French soldiers.<br>
<br>On 22 December Moore learned that, on the capitulation of Madrid, Napoleon's 200,000 men were marching to attack him. The retreat was instantly resumed. It now fell to Paget's five regiments, facing thirteen of the French on a 30 mile front, to keep the retreat secret and the advance guard at bay. Nearly every troop was constantly in action, leading Napoleon himself to set down the cavalry at double its actual strength.<br>
<br>At Benavente, on 29 December, the bridge over the Esla having been blown up, General Lefebres-Desnouettes, commanding the &eacute;lite of Napoleon's cavalry, took time to find a ford. While Paget's pickets kept the French occupied, he concealed the 10th hussars until the enemy were in the act of charging down upon the pickets. The regiment then crashed into the French flank. Utterly surprised, the enemy horsemen broke and did not again attempt a crossing that day; Moore's army had gained a vital day's march. Although the retreat started on 24 December, it was not guessed at by Soult until late on the 27th. &#145;By this time&#146;, wrote Fortescue, &#145;the contempt of the British for the French horse was such that they cheerfully engaged greatly superior numbers&#146;  (Fortescue, <span class="italic">Brit. army</span>, 352). Moore found it impossible &#145;to say too much&#146;  (ibid.) in praise of the cavalry.<br>
<br>As the plains were replaced by the Galician Mountains, the infantry commanded by Paget's brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21106/', "Edward Paget")</script>, took over the rearguard. Paget himself, meanwhile, had succumbed to the prevalent ophthalmia, being practically blinded by it. From this resulted the <i>tic douloureux</i> (facial neuralgia), from which he suffered untold agonies during the last thirty-five years of his life. He was already aboard ship when he heard of Moore's death on 16 January 1809 at the battle of Corunna.<h2>
<a name="Elopementdivorceduelandsecondmarriage"></a>Elopement, divorce, duel, and second marriage</h2>Back home, Paget, f&ecirc;ted as a hero, became the centre of a famous scandal. Earlier he and Lady Charlotte Wellesley (1781&#150;1853) had fallen in love. A daughter of Earl Cadogan and the wife of Henry Wellesley (Sir Arthur Wellesley's youngest brother and later Lord Cowley), Char, as she was known, was the mother of five children. Paget deserted his wife Caroline and eloped with her. Henry Wellesley offered to take Char back conditionally but she replied that, not being &#145;lost to all Sense of Honor&#146;  (Plas Newydd MSS), she could not return to a husband whom she had left or to children she had abandoned. Paget's family, while condemning him and, more forcefully, Char (&#145;that <i>maudite sorci&egrave;re</i>&#146;), befriended &#145;poor Car&#146;  (ibid.). Paget's brothers failed to persuade him to return to his wife.<br>
<br>Char's brother, meanwhile, required her to give Paget up. On her refusing to do so, he challenged Paget to a duel. This he refused, writing that, as Char had &#145;lost the world&#146; upon his account, the only atonement he could make was to devote himself to alleviating &#145;her suffering&#146;, adding that: &#145;my motive for acting thus is good&#146;  (Plas Newydd MSS). Since Paget failed to contest Wellesley's action for &#145;criminal conversation&#146; (6 May 1809), his damages were assessed at &pound;20,000 with costs. The final decree was granted on 7 July and a private act passed on 22 February 1810.<br>
<br>Nine months earlier, Paget's brother had persuaded him to be temporarily reconciled to Car. It seems that she agreed to his returning &#145;without any stipulations whatever&#146;  (Plas Newydd MSS), but the transaction is shrouded in mystery. All that is certain is that Paget returned to Car on 17 May 1809 and that Char was financially looked after. Thus, Paget now felt able to accept Cadogan's further challenge to a duel, which took place on 30 May. Cadogan fired his pistol and missed, but Paget aimed off, saying that nothing would induce him to add to the injuries he had already inflicted on the family &#145;by firing at the brother of Lady Charlotte Wellesley&#146;  (ibid.). On 4 March 1810 Char gave birth to a baby girl whose father was Paget.<br>
<br>Paget's conduct was markedly unlike the typical military libertine of a generation earlier and the actions of all concerned were illustrative of the growing decencies of life of that period. Though both families involved were tory, the comments of the whig press, eschewing past practice, were irreproachable.<br>
<br>Car now set in motion divorce proceedings. Only in Scotland did the law provide a wife with the same remedy as a husband; and to Scotland, therefore, she and Paget resorted. As soon as all was settled, Paget married Char, while Car married the duke of Argyll, to whom she had for some time been engaged. Car and her husband had no children, while Char and Paget had ten. It was many years before Char was accepted in society. The whole business had cost Paget &pound;55,000.<br>
<br>The death of Paget's father in 1812 revealed large debts. Yet extensive estates, and copper-, lead-, and coalmines, still produced income between 1819 and 1835 averaging &pound;76,200 p.a., while overspending averaged &pound;1600 p.a. In the meantime, Paget had commanded an infantry division in the ill-starred, short-lived Walcheren expedition of 1809. He saw little action but escaped the miasmatic fever which decimated the army.<br>
<br>For the next five years, besides commanding the London district troops in the corn law riots early in 1815, Uxbridge (as he now was) saw no active service. This was partly because the duke of Wellington disliked &#145;clever&#146; cavalry officers. Uxbridge's view that a cavalry general should &#145;inspire his men &hellip; with the most perfect confidence in his personal gallantry&#146;, with his added comment of &#145;let him but lead, they are sure to follow &hellip; hardly anything will stop them&#146;  (Le Marchant, 157&#150;8), would have alarmed the duke. For the Waterloo campaign Wellington would have preferred the more experienced, but plodding Lord Combermere. Yet Uxbridge was thrust on him by the prince regent and the duke of York.<h2>
<a name="CommandingalliedcavalryintheWaterloocampaign"></a>Commanding allied cavalry in the Waterloo campaign</h2>On 15 April 1815 Uxbridge assumed command of some 13,000 allied cavalry and forty-four horse artillery guns, the duke of Wellington giving him <i>carte blanche</i>. (The Dutch/Belgian horse, until the eve of Waterloo, remained under the prince of Orange.) Chiefly for forage supply reasons, the cavalry was distributed over a wide area. This meant that at Quatre-Bras (16 June) it failed to concentrate in time to assist the infantry. On the 17th Uxbridge was left by Wellington to cover the infantry's retirement from Quatre-Bras to Mont-St Jean. He was enjoined to avoid a serious engagement and remain in position as long as possible, and he did both admirably. In the course of the operation, described by Uxbridge as &#145;the prettiest Field Day of Cavalry and Horse Artillery that I ever witnessed&#146;  (Siborne, 7), the 7th hussars, through no fault of their own, were repulsed by the French <i>lanciers</i> at Genappe. Consequently, as soon as the <i>lanciers</i> had debouched from the narrow village street, Uxbridge ordered the heavy horsemen of the 1st Life Guards to charge, thus retrieving the situation.<br>
<br>On 18 June, at perhaps the most critical moment of the great battle, when Lieutenant-General Thomas Picton's infantry of 3000 were facing some 10,000 enemy infantry about to pour through a gap left by the flight of Rijlandt's Netherlanders, Uxbridge &#145;galloped up to the Heavy Cavalry&#146;, as he later wrote, &#145;and ordered the Household Brigade to prepare to form line, passed on to [the Union Brigade]&#146;, told its commander &#145;to wheel into line when the other Brigade did, instantly returned to the Household Brigade, and put the whole in motion&#146;  (Siborne, 8, 238). He put himself at the head of the two brigades as they poured over the ridge and crashed headlong into the enemy's serried ranks. Thus, 2000 &#145;heavies&#146; swept 15,000 French soldiers in wild disorder before them, destroying two field batteries and taking more than 2000 prisoners and two eagles. The enemy's casualties numbered about 4500, but the cavalry lost 700 men and 900 horses.<br>
<br>These high casualties are accounted for, in part, by Uxbridge placing himself at the head of the first line instead of the second: &#145;a great mistake&#146;, as he put it. &#145;The <i>carri&egrave;re</i> once begun, the leader is no better than any other man.&#146; When he sounded the rally, &#145;neither voice nor trumpet availed. The pursuit continued without order and too far&#146;  (Siborne, 9&#150;10). It penetrated even to Napoleon's &#145;great battery&#146;. As they retired, the exhausted survivors were badly cut up by fresh French cavalry.<br>
<br>For the rest of the battle Uxbridge galloped from regiment to regiment of his light brigades, leading numerous counter-attacks against the massed cavalry which again and again assaulted the British &#145;squares&#146;. He had eight or nine horses shot under him. At a moment of maximum crisis he saw an infantry regiment wavering. &#145;Galloping to the rally, he reminded this regiment of its distinguished name &hellip; told them who he was, and led them to the charge. They followed him to a man, drove back the Enemy, and maintained their post&#146;  (Siborne, 17, 20).<br>
<br>As the battle was ending, a grapeshot passed over the neck of Wellington's horse and smashed into Uxbridge's right knee as he rode beside the duke. &#145;By God, sir, I've lost my leg!&#146; he is supposed to have exclaimed. The duke momentarily removes the telescope from his eye, considers the mangled limb, says &#145;By God, sir, so you have!&#146;  (marquess of Anglesey, 149), and resumes his scrutiny of the victorious field. The leg had to be amputated that night and was buried in a Waterloo garden under an elaborately inscribed &#145;tombstone&#146;. For its loss Uxbridge was offered and refused an annual pension of &pound;1200, thus saving the nation &pound;47,000.<br>
<br>Within three weeks Uxbridge was back in London. Later, the first articulated artificial limb ever devised&#151;the &#145;Anglesey leg&#146;&#151;was fitted to his stump. On 4 July he was created marquess of Anglesey. Baron Stockmar described him at this time as &#145;a tall, well-made man, wild martial face, high forehead, with a large hawk's nose, which makes a small, deep angle where it joins the forehead. A great deal of ease in his manners&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 53). In 1816 a 100-foot grey marble column by Thomas Harrison was erected in Anglesey, paid for chiefly by local subscriptions, commemorating Anglesey's &#145;heroic conduct&#146;. In 1859 a bronze statue by Matthew Noble was placed on top of it.<br>
<br>Anglesey was made a knight of the Garter in 1818 and promoted general in 1819. At the time of Queen Caroline's trial in 1820 he is said to have been surrounded by an angry crowd insisting that he should give the cry &#145;The Queen!&#146; He complied and said: &#145;God save the Queen&#151;and may all your wives be like her!&#146;  (marquess of Anglesey, 163&#150;4). At George IV's coronation in 1821, he acted as lord high steward.<h2>
<a name="FirstIrishadministration"></a>First Irish administration</h2>On 30 April 1827 Anglesey succeeded Wellington as master-general of the ordnance in Canning's cabinet. In midsummer, before Canning's death, he was designated to succeed Marquess Richard Colley Wellesley as lord lieutenant of Ireland at the end of the year. Being more of a Canningite than an ultra, he had scruples&#151;which he soon overcame&#151;about serving under Wellington when he became prime minister in January 1828. His views on Catholic emancipation, the great Irish question of the day, had long been equivocal. To the king, fussed about breaking his coronation oath, he protested that he was neither protestant nor Catholic and would act impartially.<br>
<br>Daniel O'Connell's Catholic Association was already a potent nationwide organization. When&#151;though as a Roman Catholic unable to sit or vote&#151;O'Connell was returned at the County Clare by-election, &pound;14,000 in &#145;Catholic Rent&#146; was subscribed in a week to his election fund. Anglesey, faced (he believed) by &#145;open rebellion&#146; from both Catholics and Orangemen, made it known that &#145;the first moment of tranquillity should be seized&#146; to adjust the question  (Anglesey to F. L. Gower, 2&#150;3 July 1828, Plas Newydd MSS). This gained him much popularity but angered Wellington, who refused to discuss the subject until he had won the king round. Meanwhile, he made massive military force available to Anglesey.<br>
<br>Anglesey and Wellington now engaged in an acrimonious correspondence. Wellington wrote privately that he thought Anglesey had been bitten by &#145;a mad Papist or instigated by the love of popularity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Despatches, Correspondence</span>, 5.280). On 30 December he was recalled.<br>
<br>Anglesey's departure was hastened, but not caused, by his letter to Dr Patrick Curtis, the Catholic primate, who had drawn from Wellington a letter stating that he was anxious for a settlement and advising that the question should be buried &#145;in oblivion&#146; for a time. This Curtis sent on to Anglesey. Since Wellington had thus gone behind his back, Anglesey decided to &#145;follow His Grace's example&#146;. He wrote to Curtis saying that allowance should be made for the difficulties of the prime minister's situation, but disagreeing with the &#145;burying in oblivion&#146; and adding that all constitutional means should be used &#145;to forward the cause&#146; and recommending &#145;patient forbearance&#146;  (Anglesey to Curtis, 23 Dec 1828, Plas Newydd MSS). The letter's publication led to Anglesey being ordered home immediately, but not before the Catholic Association had resolved that all Catholics should be guided by so enlightened a lord lieutenant.<br>
<br>On 19 January 1829, a day of mourning in Dublin, hundreds of thousands of silent, sober people lined the route to Kingstown as Anglesey departed. Hearing of the recall, the French politician Talleyrand told Palmerston that &#145;he saw at once that the Duke had determined on conceding the Irish Catholic claims, and that he did not mean anyone else to have the credit&#146;  (Ashley, 185). Thus it was, for, five days after Anglesey's departure, the <span class="roman">Relief Bill</span> was announced from the throne, and on 13 April 1829 it became law.<h2>
<a name="SecondIrishadministration"></a>Second Irish administration</h2>Declaring that he was &#145;attached and bound to no party&#146;  (memorandum, 1 Nov 1830, Plas Newydd MSS), Anglesey had no hesitation in accepting the lord lieutenancy again when Earl Grey's whig administration succeeded Wellington's in December 1830. O'Connell's campaign for repeal of the union (home rule) had now made that the great issue of the day. Anglesey, like virtually everyone in England, was unequivocally against it. O'Connell's prodigious power by the time of Anglesey's arrival had so inflamed the people that the first of numerous, mostly fruitless, proclamations had to be issued. On 14 January 1831 &#145;the Liberator&#146; (as O'Connell was called) publicly recommended a run on the banks. Anglesey decided to arrest him, declaring that &#145;things are now come to that pass that the question is whether he or I shall govern Ireland&#146;  (<span class="italic">Greville Memoirs</span>, 2.109). However, O'Connell was never brought to court, for the political situation had suddenly undergone a radical change.<br>
<br>When on 1 March 1831 the government outlined its scheme for parliamentary reform (of which Anglesey was an ardent advocate), O'Connell gave it his fullest support and temporarily ceased to agitate for repeal. Instead he pressed for the abolition of the compulsory payment of tithes by the Catholic population to the protestant clergy. Anglesey urged the cabinet to remove this and other intolerable imposts and corrupt practices&#151;with only partial success, the <span class="roman">Irish Church Act</span> of 1833 achieving only a few of the desired reforms. At the same time a stringent <span class="roman">Coercion Act</span> was thought necessary, but Anglesey, finding that the threat of it was enough, never put it in force. When an unaccustomed period of calm followed, Anglesey took advantage of it and in September 1833 he resigned, leaving behind him his greatest achievement, the national education system. In 1830 the mass of the Irish population received no education whatsoever, but by 1843 400,000 children were attending state-aided schools.<br>
<br>In 1842 Anglesey exchanged the colonelcy of the 7th hussars for that of the Royal Horse Guards, thus becoming gold stick-in-waiting. In 1846 he was made field marshal.<h2>
<a name="Mastergeneraloftheordnanceagain"></a>Master-general of the ordnance again</h2>In July 1846 Anglesey became for the second time master-general of the ordnance, under the prime minister, Lord John Russell&#151;but without a seat in the cabinet. He presided over &#145;this charming department&#146;, as he called it, until the government's fall in 1852, at which time he was then nearly eighty-four.<br>
<br>Together with Sir John Burgoyne, whom he had appointed inspector-general of fortifications, Anglesey and Wellington (the latter as commander-in-chief) fought hard to bring government and public opinion to realization of the defenceless state of the country when steamships were beginning to make, as Anglesey put it, &#145;all parts of the coasts of this Empire&#146;  (Wellington to Anglesey, 3 April 1847, Plas Newydd MSS) vulnerable to attacks in all weathers. Both men made numerous visits to coastal defensive works, on horseback and by steamer, Anglesey in his yacht on one occasion looking into the French port of Cherbourg and finding it &#145;amply protected&#146;  (ibid.). He and Wellington became in their last years the closest of old cronies, being often seen together in public and private&#151;two deaf old noblemen shouting at each other. Anglesey was the only senior commander present at Waterloo to outlive his chief.<h2>
<a name="Deathandstatefuneral"></a>Death and state funeral</h2>Anglesey also outlived Char by nine months, dying of a stroke at Uxbridge House, Burlington Gardens, London, on 29 April 1854. At Queen Victoria's wish, he was given a state funeral and was buried in Lichfield Cathedral on 6 May.<br>
<br>The lord lieutenancies of Anglesey and Staffordshire (in which were his principal residences, Plas Newydd and Beaudesert Hall) were among the many posts Anglesey held.
