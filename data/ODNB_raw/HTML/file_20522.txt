<span class="headword">Ua Conchobair,  Ruaidr&iacute;</span> <span class="st"> [Rory O'Connor]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1116&#150;1198), <span class="occ">high-king of Ireland</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20524/', "Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair (1088&#150;1156), king of Connacht")</script> and high-king, and of Caillech D&eacute;, daughter of Ua hEidin, king of U&iacute; Fiachrach Aidne.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyears"></a>Early years</h2>Ruaidr&iacute; is first mentioned in 1136 when, aged about twenty, he was imprisoned by his father despite being under the protection of ecclesiastical sureties. In 1143 he was again taken prisoner by his brother, Conchobar, acting under the authority of their father, suggesting that Ruaidr&iacute; already by that stage was bidding for succession to the kingship of Connacht. Conchobar was killed in 1144, while another brother, Tadg, died shortly after, following which Ruaidr&iacute; was released from captivity through the intercession of the clergy. He may have been regarded as successor designate to the kingship from that date. In 1147 he led a great raid into Dartraige (in what is now co. Leitrim), and in a separate incident instigated the capture of a rival dynast, Domnall Ua Conchobair, by Toirdelbach Ua Briain, king of Thomond. In 1153, as part of his father's campaign against Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn, king of Cen&eacute;l nE&oacute;gain, and contender for the high-kingship, Ruaidr&iacute; was in command of the battalions of west Connacht, when his camp at Fardrum (Westmeath) suffered a surprise attack from Mac Lochlainn's army.<h2>
<a name="Successiontokingship"></a>Succession to kingship</h2>On his father's death in 1156 Ruaidr&iacute; Ua Conchobair succeeded as king of Connacht, moving quickly to secure his position by blinding his brother Brian Breifnech and taking two other brothers, Brian Luignech and Muirchertach Muimnech, as prisoners. In 1157, while Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn, newly acknowledged as high-king, was campaigning to assert his dominance in Munster, Ruaidr&iacute; hosted into Cen&eacute;l nE&oacute;gain in his absence, thereby signifying his intention to contest the high-kingship against Mac Lochlainn; Ruaidr&iacute; then moved on to campaign himself in Munster, restoring Toirdelbach Ua Briain as king of Thomond, exacting hostages from Diarmait Mac Carthaig, king of Desmond, and retaining a large fleet on the Shannon, actions intended as a direct challenge to Mac Lochlainn's high-kingship. In 1158 Ruaidr&iacute; sent a marauding fleet to Cen&eacute;l nE&oacute;gain. In 1159 his erection of a new bridge at Athlone, which afforded ready access into Mide, led to conflict at the site with Donnchad Ua M&aacute;elsechlainn, king of Mide, at which Ruaidr&iacute;'s son and potential successor (<i>r&iacute;damna</i>), &Aacute;ed, lost his life. Later in the same year Ua Conchobair led an army against Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn to Ardee (Louth), where, however, he suffered a decisive defeat which Mac Lochlainn followed up with raiding in Connacht, destroying a series of strongholds. In 1160 a meeting between Mac Lochlainn and Ruaidr&iacute; at Assaroe (Donegal) concluded without a truce. In 1161 Ruaidr&iacute; hosted into Leinster and installed his own nominees in the north Leinster kingships of U&iacute; F&aacute;el&aacute;in and U&iacute; Failge at the expense of Diarmait Mac Murchada, provincial king of Leinster. Ruaidr&iacute; subsequently gave four hostages to Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn as high-king in return for a derogated overlordship of Br&eacute;ifne, Conmaicne, the western half of Mide, and the southern half of Ireland, though in 1162 Diarmait Ua M&aacute;elsechlainn paid 100 ounces of gold for the restoration to him of west Mide. In 1164, continuing with his father's policy of encastellation, Ua Conchobair erected a castle at Tuam and in 1166 he endowed a new gold reliquary for the shrine of St Manch&aacute;n of Mohill (Leitrim), again imitative of his father's patronage of ecclesiastical art.<h2>
<a name="Highkingship"></a>High-kingship</h2>Following the assassination of Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn in 1166 Ruaidr&iacute; Ua Conchobair and Diarmait Mac Murchada, king of Leinster, emerged as the main contenders for the high-kingship. The decisive turning point in Ruaidr&iacute;'s favour was the wresting of control of the city of Dublin from Mac Murchada, who was exiled on 1 August 1166. Ua Conchobair was acknowledged as high-king at a major convention at Athlone in 1166, at which the allegiance of Dublin was secured by a stipend of 4000 cows from Ruaidr&iacute;. In 1167 and 1168 he celebrated the traditional fair of Tailtiu at the ancient assembly site of Teltown (Meath) as a ceremonial assertion of his high-kingship. Another assembly at Athboy in 1167 was attended by the archbishops of Armagh, Tuam, and Dublin, and the kings of Br&eacute;ifne, Airgialla, Ulaid, Mide, and Dublin, whose combined forces reputedly numbered thirteen thousand horsed soldiers. Ua Conchobair had not yet, however, secured recognition from Cen&eacute;l nE&oacute;gain and, in pursuit of that objective, he dispatched a fleet to Derry and himself led a near national army into Cen&eacute;l nE&oacute;gain, where he effected a partition between the rival lineages of Mac Lochlainn and Ua N&eacute;ill, with Niall Mac Lochlainn receiving the northern portion and A&eacute;d Ua N&eacute;ill that south of Slieve Gullion. In 1168 the new kings of Cen&eacute;l nE&oacute;gain, accompanied by the abbot of Derry, were received by Ruaidr&iacute; at Athlone and accepted stipend. In 1169 he donated an annual stipend of ten cows to support the teaching of students from Ireland and Scotland, a gesture intended to secure endorsement of his high-kingship from the primatial church of Armagh.<h2>
<a name="AngloNormanintervention"></a>Anglo-Norman intervention</h2>Ruaidr&iacute; Ua Conchobair's failure to prevent the return to Leinster in the autumn of 1167 of Diarmait Mac Murchada with Anglo-Norman mercenaries and the latter's recovery of his patrimonial kingdom of U&iacute; Chennselaig (south Leinster) was to have momentous consequences: the Anglo-Norman commentator, Gerald of Wales, depicts Diarmait Mac Murchada on his return as determined &#145;to bring Connacht under his control together with the kingship of all Ireland&#146;  (Giraldus Cambrensis, 52). Ruaidr&iacute; was content to host into Leinster and to exact compensation on behalf of his ally, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20847/', "Tigern&#225;n Ua Ruairc, king of Br&#233;ifne")</script>, for Mac Murchada's abduction of the latter's wife in 1152, and to take hostages, including Mac Murchada's legitimate son and potential successor, Conchobar. Ruaidr&iacute; was too preoccupied with asserting his authority in Munster, which he invaded and partitioned in 1168 between Domnall Ua Briain, king of Thomond, and Diarmait Mac Carthaig, king of Desmond, and in Mide, which he divided in 1169, assigning the eastern portion to Tigern&aacute;n Ua Ruairc of Br&eacute;ifne and retaining the western half himself. In 1170 Ruaidr&iacute; sought to penetrate Domnall Ua Briain's kingdom of Thomond, but the latter stalled the attempt by securing the assistance of an Anglo-Norman force provided by Diarmait Mac Murchada, who was his father-in-law. Following Ua Conchobair's failure to prevent Mac Murchada's capture of Dublin in September 1170 with the assistance of Richard fitz Gilbert, earl of Pembroke and lord of Striguil (known as Strongbow), Ruaidr&iacute; executed Mac Murchada's hostaged son, Conchobar. After Mac Murchada's death in May 1171, Ruaidr&iacute; besieged Dublin but again failed to dislodge the Anglo-Norman garrison, which succeeded in mounting a surprise sortie on his decamped army and lifting his blockade. The claim made by Gerald of Wales that Ruaidr&iacute; submitted to Henry II during the latter's expedition to Ireland in 1171&#150;2 is contradicted by the evidence both of the Irish annals and of other Anglo-Norman chroniclers. Henry may have planned an expedition against Connacht in the summer of 1172, but, if so, it was pre-empted by the rebellion of his son, which determined his withdrawal from Ireland shortly before Easter 1172. Henry's grants before his departure from Ireland of the lordships of Leinster and of Meath to Richard fitz Gilbert and Hugh de Lacy respectively and the consequent removal of these two former provincial kingdoms from the orbit of influence of Ruaidr&iacute; Ua Conchobair effectively marked the end of his high-kingship. In 1173 Ruaidr&iacute;'s son, Conchobar M&aacute;enmaige, led a battalion from Connacht to aid Domnall Ua Briain in dislodging an Anglo-Norman garrison in Kilkenny, and in 1174 assisted Domnall in his victory over Anglo-Normans at Thurles, thereby demonstrating his capacities as prospective successor to the kingship of Connacht. Ruaidr&iacute; himself led a major offensive into Mide in 1174, with the Connacht army augmented by forces from the kings of Cen&eacute;l Conaill, Cen&eacute;l nE&oacute;gain, Br&eacute;ifne, Ulaid, and Airgialla, where he destroyed the newly erected Anglo-Norman strongholds at Trim and Duleek and raided as far as the confines of Dublin. It had little permanent effect, however, since in 1175 the castles were rebuilt and Anglo-Norman control of Mide was demonstrated by raiding as far as the Shannon.<h2>
<a name="TreatyofWindsor"></a>Treaty of Windsor</h2>The failure of Ruaidr&iacute; Ua Conchobair to achieve any permanent gain from that expedition, coupled with the difficulties of maintaining dominance over Ua Briain of Thomond, may have determined the strategy embodied in the treaty of Windsor: it was concluded on 6 October 1175 between Henry II and Ruaidr&iacute; with Cadla Ua Dubhtaig, archbishop of Tuam, Cantordis, abbot of Clonfert, and Master Laurence, his chancellor, acting as Ruaidr&iacute;'s proxies. Henry II arrogated to himself overlordship of Leinster and Meath, while Ruaidr&iacute; was to be over-king of the remainder of Ireland. Ua Conchobair became the liegeman of Henry and &#145;king under him&#146;, a position he was to retain as long as he should faithfully serve Henry and &#145;be ready at his service as his man&#146;  (Rymer, <span class="italic">Foedera</span>, 1.31&#150;2). Ruaidr&iacute;'s main obligations as a subordinate of Henry were to collect and transmit tribute and to punish rebellious subordinates, but he was also entitled to seek military support from Henry II's garrisons in Ireland. The key clause in the treaty from Ruaidr&iacute;'s standpoint may have been the right afforded him to call on the constable of the king of England for military assistance. Shortly before 1 October 1175, that is even before the treaty had been formally ratified, Ua Conchobair secured an Anglo-Norman force to plunder Domnall Ua Briain's capital of Limerick, a key fortified gateway on the Shannon between Thomond and Connacht. However, when the Anglo-Norman garrison withdrew from Limerick in 1176, Ruaidr&iacute; was obliged to reach an accommodation with Ua Briain. In 1177 an Anglo-Norman contingent from the Dublin garrison was invited into Connacht by Murchad, son of Ruaidr&iacute;, who undertook to lead it to the capital, Tuam, while Ruaidr&iacute; was absent on circuit in west Connacht (the annals of Boyle also implicate Conchobar M&aacute;enmaige). The attack was repulsed, and Murchad subsequently was blinded in punishment by his father. In 1178 a foraging party of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15852/', "Hugh de Lacy (d. 1186)")</script>, first Anglo-Norman lord of Meath, turned back at Clonmacnoise for fear of Ruaidr&iacute;. In 1179 a synod was convened at Clonfert by Lorc&aacute;n Ua Tuathail (Laurence O'Toole), archbishop of Dublin and native papal legate, to proclaim the decrees of the Third Lateran Council, which he had attended. Lorc&aacute;n was instrumental in securing the translation in early 1180 of Ruaidr&iacute;'s nephew Tommaltach Ua Conchobair, bishop of Elphin, to the primatial see of Armagh. This act implied that Ruaidr&iacute; claimed a right to present to ecclesiastical offices that reflected his continued claim to the high-kingship. It was shortly after the installation of Tommaltach that Lorc&aacute;n, who had witnessed the treaty of Windsor, travelled to England to negotiate with Henry II on Ruaidr&iacute;'s behalf, delivering a son as a hostage. Whether this mission should be linked to the treaty of Windsor is uncertain, since it is unclear how long it was deemed to be in operation. About 1180 a daughter of Ruaidr&iacute; Ua Conchobair married Hugh de Lacy, the alliance, no doubt, intended to stabilize Ruaidr&iacute;'s eastern frontier, but it may have contributed to Ruaidr&iacute;'s difficulties with Henry, whose permission for the marriage Lacy had not sought.<h2>
<a name="Abdicationandlateryears"></a>Abdication and later years</h2>In 1183 Ruaidr&iacute; Ua Conchobair retired from the kingship of Connacht and was replaced by his son, Conchobar M&aacute;enmaige. In 1185, however, Ruaidr&iacute; attempted to recover the kingship by concluding an alliance with Domnall Ua Briain, king of Thomond, and securing the help of an Anglo-Norman force. This resulted in a temporary division of Connacht between himself and Conchobar M&aacute;enmaige, who, however, deposed him again. In 1188 John de Courcy hosted into Connacht, accompanied by two other sons of Ruaidr&iacute;, rivals of Conchobar M&aacute;enmaige, possibly with the intention of supporting Ruaidr&iacute;'s restoration; but Conchobar M&aacute;enmaige repulsed their forces decisively. When Conchobar M&aacute;enmaige was assassinated the following year, supporters of Ruaidr&iacute; staged another attempt to reinstate him, but it was his half-brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20513/', "Cathal Croibhdhearg &#211; Conchobhair")</script>, who succeeded in taking the kingship. In 1191 Ruaidr&iacute; unsuccessfully sought aid in Cen&eacute;l Conaill, Cen&eacute;l nE&oacute;gain, Ulaid, among the Anglo-Normans in Meath, and in Munster to recover the kingship; eventually he was recalled from Munster by members of his kindred (the S&iacute;l Muiredaig) and allocated lands in U&iacute; Fiachrach Aidne and Cen&eacute;l &Aacute;eda na hEchtge in south Connacht. He died at Cong on 2 December 1198, aged eighty-two, and was buried on the left-hand side of the high altar at Clonmacnoise, his remains being reinterred in a stone coffin in 1207. The annals of Loch C&eacute; and of Connacht, in recording the death of his son &Aacute;ed in 1233, attribute the loss of the kingship of Connacht by his successors to the fact that the pope had offered Ruaidr&iacute; an allowance of six married wives provided that he desisted from all other women, but that he had refused to accept. The criticism seems more appropriate to his father, Toirdelbach, for whom six wives can be named. The only wife of Ruaidr&iacute; known by name is Dub Coblaid (<i>d</i>. 1181), daughter of Tigern&aacute;n Ua Ruairc, king of Br&eacute;ifne, reflective of the strong political alliance between Tigern&aacute;n and Ruaidr&iacute;.<br>
<br>Ruaidr&iacute; Ua Conchobair's assumption of the high-kingship in 1166, although initially spectacularly successful, was compromised by Anglo-Norman incursion into Ireland from 1167 onwards and his failure to retain control over events in Leinster. His negotiation of the treaty of Windsor with Henry II inaugurated the first partition of Ireland between native and incomer and spelt the end of an indigenous high-kingship of Ireland. Just as Ruaidr&iacute; had challenged his own father for the regnal succession during the latter's reign, so he, in turn, was seriously undermined by intra-familial dissension and prospective successors bidding for power and after 1183 never recovered his position.<br>
