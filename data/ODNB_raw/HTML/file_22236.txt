<span class="headword">Piers,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1603), <span class="occ">soldier and founder of the town of Carrickfergus</span>, was the son of Richard or Henry Piers of Piers-Hall, near Ingleton, Yorkshire. Nothing is known about his education. He may have been a younger son, which would explain his early career as a soldier.<br>
<br>In 1591 Piers wrote that he had had sixty years' experience in Ireland, which suggests that he first went to the country in the early 1530s. His earliest contact was through the sea and may have been semi-piratical in nature. A deposition in the high court of admiralty, dated 27 November 1555, described him as &#145;a tall burly man with a big, brown beard&#146;  (Appleby, 11) who was captain of a ship which he said that he had got from James Fitzgerald, thirteenth earl of Desmond. About the same time Piers and a group of other Englishmen received a licence from the Irish privy council to fish in the River Bann and take land for their defence along the north-east coast. It was while he was fishing in the area in the summer of 1556 (with two ships and three pinnaces) that Piers was recruited by Thomas Radcliffe, Lord Fitzwalter, who was acting as governor of Ireland, to assist in a naval expedition against the Scots in the North Channel and the Hebrides. Subsequently, he remained in the north-east as constable of Carrickfergus Castle, co. Antrim, an office which he shared initially with one of his fellow fishermen, Richard Bethell. In the spring of 1558 Piers took part in a second maritime attack on the MacDonalds, who were emigrating to Ulster in large numbers. His next official contact with the Scots was more diplomatic. In 1562 he was engaged in negotiations with James MacDonald to persuade him to make an agreement with the crown, and in the spring of the following year Piers travelled to Kintyre to meet with him. On 10 December 1562, in recognition of his services in the north-east, Piers was granted a lease of Tristernagh Priory, Westmeath, which he converted into a family home.<br>
<br>Through the 1560s Piers maintained his contacts with the Scots in Ulster, and it may have been at his urging that the MacDonalds killed Shane O'Neill in 1567. Within days of O'Neill's death Piers was reported to have dug up the body and cut off the head, which he sent to Sir Henry Sidney, lord deputy, who displayed it on the gates of Dublin Castle. In the aftermath of O'Neill's killing Piers, with the assistance of other Elizabethan army captains, attempted to limit further Scottish incursions into the north-east. They met with little success but in the spring of 1569 a major defeat was inflicted on 400 Scots in Clandeboye. Sidney demonstrated his support for Piers by appointing him seneschal of Clandeboye.<br>
<br>Piers's function as constable and seneschal was similar to that of other captains in the Elizabethan army in Ireland. He was the local representative of the crown and as such combined a military and, in his case, a maritime role with that of diplomatic intermediary between the central administration and local political leaders in the Irish community. At the same time a permanently based captain such as Piers was concerned to advance his own career and to influence the direction of crown policy in such a way as to reap private profit from its implementation. In the 1560s and early 1570s he exploited his position at Carrickfergus to establish an economic and political network in the Clandeboye region. He developed the commercial potential of Carrickfergus and petitioned for it to be walled. In 1566 he was granted a lease of the town customs, and in 1572 he was granted the office of collector of the customs of wine. In 1572&#150;3 he served as mayor of Carrickfergus. He also had a lease of the fisheries of the River Bann. Piers consolidated his position by attempting to win the support of local chiefs, particularly Brian mac Phelim O'Neill, lord of Clandeboye.<br>
<br>From his earliest contacts with the north-east Piers was interested in the possibility of settling Englishmen in the area and devised a number of plantation proposals which he submitted to the London authorities. All his colonial projects shared three key characteristics: a plan to expel the Scots from Ulster and defend the north-east coast from further Scottish incursions, a scheme to settle parts of Ulster with English people, and suggestions for winning support from selected local chiefs for the project. Piers's proposals usually also included a request for military and naval support from the crown. His plans for the north-east were threatened by the plantation scheme of Sir Thomas Smith, secretary of state, for the Ards peninsula, co. Down, which he advised Sir William Cecil, Lord Burghley, lord treasurer, not to support. When Smith's son Thomas Smith was killed in 1573 the colonial project for Ulster was incorporated into the &#145;enterprise&#146; of Walter Devereux, first earl of Essex. Essex arrived in Ulster in 1574, and quickly became suspicious of Piers, accusing him of passing military intelligence to Brian mac Phelim O'Neill. Piers did maintain good relations with Brian mac Phelim O'Neill in return for a free hand in extorting cess from his neighbours. Essex ordered Piers's arrest and detention in Carrickfergus Castle in December. Subsequently, he was released and travelled to London to plead his innocence. Following the failure of Essex's Irish adventure and the nomination of Sidney again as lord deputy in 1575, Piers was reappointed to the constableship of Carrickfergus. He was able to appoint members of his family to local office and his nephew William Piers was subsequently mayor of the town. With Sidney's approval, Piers continued to support the local power structure in Clandeboye, particularly Brian Mac Fertagh O'Neill, the successor to Brian mac Phelim O'Neill, whom Essex had had executed for treason.<br>
<br>Piers also maintained his interest in plantation projects in the north-east. In 1578 he submitted to the London administration a proposal to settle the Ards peninsula. The plan involved the creation of an incorporated company which would control the trade of the coast from Strangford to Sligo, an undertaking to banish the Scots from Ulster, leasing land to local chiefs, and the settlement of Englishmen in the region. Like all his proposals, it did not become a reality. Despite his lack of success in implementing his colonial projects, Piers's strategy of co-operation with local chiefs was identified as politically useful by the crown. In summer 1580 Piers negotiated with Turlough Luineach, chief of the O'Neills of Tyrone, on behalf of the crown. He found him &#145;very tractable&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/75, no. 58) and agreed to conditions which would have involved Elizabeth I recognizing Turlough Luineach's rights over his <i>ur-riogha</i>, or vassal chiefs. In return, Turlough Luineach promised to assist the crown in banishing the Scots from Ulster. The proposed agreement received support from the queen and privy council but was strongly opposed by Arthur Grey, fourteenth Lord Grey of Wilton, lord deputy, who, resentful of what he perceived as a snub to his authority, recommended a much tougher military policy against Turlough Luineach. The negotiations were consequently abandoned.<br>
<br>Piers's failure to have his agreement with Turlough Luineach implemented led to a decline in his status in Clandeboye. By the mid-1580s he had retired to Tristernagh. He was also by this stage in declining health and reported in 1593 that he had lost the use of his legs. He did not, however, abandon his interest in Ulster and in 1594 he made another attempt to propose a scheme for settling the region. He continued to argue for the necessity of banishing the Scots and for the naval defence of the north-east coast. He also proposed limiting the power of Hugh O'Neill, second earl of Tyrone, by establishing a series of forts and encouraging some of the lesser chiefs in the province through their ennoblement as barons. As Piers acknowledged, his proposal borrowed some ideas from an earlier scheme recommended by Sidney in the 1570s. His last proposal, like his first, did not receive government backing.<br>
<br>Piers died in 1603 and requested that he be buried at Carrickfergus. He had married Anne Holt of Holt Castle, Cheshire, who came to Ireland as part of the household of Mary Sidney, wife of Sir Henry Sidney. They had one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22232/', "Henry Piers (d. 1623)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22233/', "Piers, Sir Henry")</script>], and two daughters, Mary and Anne.<br>
