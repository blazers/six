<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bell, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1865&#150;1952), <span class="occ">engineer and shipbuilder</span>, was born on 21 December 1865 at Sirsawa in India, the son of Imrie Bell, a consultant engineer specializing in the design of lighthouses, and his wife, Jane Walker of Edinburgh. His early education was undertaken at the <i>Gymnasium</i> in Celle, Hanover, and then at King's College School, London. In 1880 he entered the Royal Naval Engineering College at Devonport, and graduated in 1886 as a fully qualified engineering officer; he was intent on a naval career, but was denied this path due to deficient eyesight. Fortunately this was no barrier to a commercial career, and he was appointed to the engineering design staff in the large new engine works which J. and G. Thomson had opened at its famous Clydebank yard. Bell was quickly given experience in the engineering shop, the drawing office, and the estimating department. His promotion was rapid: he was appointed assistant to the engineering director in 1895, and was also the &#145;outside&#146; manager for the engineering work in the yard. When John Brown of Sheffield acquired the yard in 1899 Bell's qualities were quickly recognized. He was appointed engineering manager and by 1903 had become a local director on the board. When the senior Clydebank manager, John Gibb Dunlop, retired in 1909, Bell was appointed director in charge, a position later to be known as managing director.<br>
<br>Bell's experience and breadth of outlook made him alert to the many developments in his professional field, and he applied himself with vigour to keeping the Clydebank firm in the forefront of these advances. He undertook his management duties when the steam turbine was appearing in the field of marine propulsion. Under his direction Clydebank acquired a Parsons licence in 1903, and had erected a set of experimental engines by 1904, subsequently installed in the Clyde passenger ferry <i>Atlanta</i>. Turbines were then quickly installed in the <i>Carmania</i> in 1905, Cunard's first such venture, and in the prototype of the quadruple screw machinery of the <i>Lusitania</i>, launched the following year. The performance of this innovative machinery was the subject of a paper presented in 1908 by Bell to the Institution of Naval Architects. This early application to the development of turbine machinery was carried a stage further in the building of the <i>Aquitania</i> in 1913. The production of turbine machinery for merchant ships under Bell's guidance reached its climax in the <i>Queen Mary</i>, launched in 1934.<br>
<br>Similar progress was also made in the field of naval machinery. In 1908 Bell acquired for Clydebank the UK licence to the American Curtis turbine, this being the beginning of the development of the Brown&#150;Curtis turbine, especially suited to heavy duty naval service. The first Brown&#150;Curtis turbines were fitted in the cruiser <i>Bristol</i>. The Brown&#150;Curtis turbine was widely installed and was taken up under sub-licence by most other naval builders in Britain. The Admiralty sought Bell's assistance in 1917 as deputy controller of dockyards and warshipbuilding; his qualities were appreciated and quickly rewarded when in 1918 he was appointed KBE. He served in the Admiralty until the end of 1918, returning to Clydebank in January 1919.<br>
<br>With the armistice the flow of naval orders to Clydebank dried up, and after the signing of the Washington treaty on naval disarmament in 1921, the Clydebank yard received no Admiralty order between 1918 and 1924. Bell consequently had to redirect the work of the yard into the merchant market, where slack demand and over-capacity prevailed. He kept the yard going through skilful negotiation of preferential links with major shipping lines, particularly Cunard, the Orient Steam Navigation Company, the Royal Mail group, and especially the Canadian Pacific Railway, which delivered six of the seventeen contracts obtained by Clydebank between 1925 and 1930. Even with this success the yard was running out of work, and by September 1930 all eight berths were vacant. The yard was only saved from closure by Bell's success in landing the Cunard contract in December 1930, for the construction of their new giant transatlantic express liner, the vessel ultimately to be launched as the <i>Queen Mary</i>. The yard number for the contract was 534, worth &pound;4 million. Work on 534 was brought to a halt on 12 December 1932, when Cunard could not continue financial provision in the wake of the disruption of the bill markets, following the financial crisis of 1931. Work was not resumed until 3 April 1934, on the conclusion of the Cunard&#150;White Star merger, which brought government assistance to complete the liner. During this time Bell presided over a yard whose workforce slipped from over 7600 in 1928 to 422 in 1932. The vessel was finally launched on 27 September 1934, and six months later, in March 1935, Sir Thomas Bell retired from his post as managing director, but continued to serve as a director of John Brown &amp; Co. Ltd until 1946.<br>
<br>Bell was tall of stature, grave in demeanour, and his strength of character was evident to all who met him. His initial naval training accustomed him to discipline and authority. He exercised both, and was a strict disciplinarian, not least with himself. While he was autocratic and patriarchal with his workforce, he made immense efforts to minimize the hardship of unemployment for his men and their families in the depression. In 1932 he leased 15 acres of land to provide allotments for 150 of his skilled men, and obtained seeds and implements through an English allotment association run by the Society of Friends. In 1900 Bell married Helen MacDonald, daughter of Malcolm MacDonald, a Scottish coal merchant; they had two daughters, one of whom died in childhood.<br>
<br>In addition to his professional work Bell interested himself in the public life of Clydebank. He was an active member and benefactor of St Columba's Episcopal Church. Together with his wife he had founded the Clydebank Nursing Association, and in 1914 they established for it a residential home in which he and his wife took active interest. After his retirement from executive duties in 1935 he became district commissioner of the Boy Scouts in the Clydebank area, and in 1947 was elected honorary president of the Dunbartonshire Association, to the affairs of which he had given very vigorous support. As a young man he was a keen gymnast; in later years his recreations were golf and gardening.<br>
<br>Bell finally retired as a director of John Brown &amp; Co. in 1946 due to failing health. He died six years later, on 9 January 1952, at his home, Furzecroft, in Helensburgh, and was buried in the same town. His wife had died in 1926, and he was survived by his remaining daughter. His personal estate was a modest &pound;28,632, nearly &pound;12,000 of which was held in stock of the company he had served for sixty years.<br>
