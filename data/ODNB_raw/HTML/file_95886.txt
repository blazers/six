<span class="headword">Fry,  Christopher</span>  (1907&#150;2005), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was born at 65 Sussex Place, Bristol, on 18 December 1907, the second son of a former builder and Anglican lay preacher, Charles John Harris (<i>b</i>. 1869), and his wife, Emma Marguerite, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hammond (<i>b</i>. 1871/2). He was originally named Arthur Hammond Harris. His father died when he was still young, and at some point in his childhood he adopted the surname Fry from his maternal grandmother, Emma Louisa Fry, on the unproven assumption that she may have been part of the prominent Quaker family. Although he was known legally as Arthur Hammond Fry into his late twenties he always wrote, and became known, as Christopher Fry.<br>
<br>Educated at Bedford Modern School, Fry wrote his first play at eleven and his first verse drama at eighteen and also taught himself to play the piano and to compose songs. After a brief spell as an actor in Bath and a schoolteacher in Surrey, in 1934 he became director of a repertory theatre in Tunbridge Wells, where he staged the first English production of G. B. Shaw's <span class="italic">Village Wooing</span>. He developed his interest in theatre by becoming a composer&#150;lyricist, and writing several songs, including &#145;I'll Snatch the Man from the Moon&#146;, for a 1935 London revue, <span class="italic">She Shall Have Music</span>. A year later he directed a tour of Ivor Novello's <span class="italic">How Do, Princess!</span> that ended ignominiously after the producer spent the investment-money playing strip poker with the chorus-girls and an assistant stage manager was imprisoned for bigamy. On 3 December 1936 Fry married Phyllis Marjorie Hart (1906&#150;1987), from Southborough, the 29-year-old daughter of Ernest Stephen Hart. They adopted one son, Tam.<br>
<br>Fry's serious writing career began with an invitation from a vicar in the Sussex village of Coleman's Hatch to write a play celebrating St Cuthman who, according to local legend, pushed his mother from Cornwall to Steyning in a wheelbarrow. The resulting play, <span class="italic">The Boy with a Cart</span> (1938), was heavily influenced by the choric style of T. S. Eliot's <span class="italic">Murder in the Cathedral</span>, as was a subsequent pageant-play, <span class="italic">The Tower</span> (1939), on the history of Tewkesbury Abbey. Eliot's influence on Fry took a more practical turn when they first met in 1939. Fry later recalled asking Eliot what he could do in wartime that didn't mean shooting people. &#145;He suggested the fire service and, when I told him that I had no head for heights, he said &#147;You must specialise in basements&#148;&#146;  (personal knowledge).<br>
<br>After a brief spell as director of the Oxford Repertory Players in 1940 and four years as a non-combatant in the Pioneer Corps, Fry resumed his writing career in 1946 with <span class="italic">A Phoenix Too Frequent</span>, staged at London's Mercury Theatre. Taken from a story by Petronius, later adapted by Jeremy Taylor, it dealt with an Ephesian widow who is dissuaded from incarcerating herself in her husband's tomb by the arrival of a handsome young centurion. It starred a young Paul Scofield, and, with its serio-comic treatment of life's triumph over death, struck a chord with a society debilitated by war. In 1946 Fry also wrote an early version of <span class="italic">The Firstborn</span> (later revised), describing the struggle between Moses and the pharaoh at the time of the plagues, for Oxford Playhouse. He followed this with <span class="italic">Thor With Angels</span>, written for the Canterbury festival and again combining Christian principles with verbal dexterity.<br>
<br>Fry's breakthrough came with <span class="italic">The Lady's not for Burning</span>, commissioned by Alec Clunes for the Arts Theatre Club. Written in the arctic winter of 1946&#150;7 and first performed in the spring of 1948, it became a flagship for the revival of poetic drama. Concerning an encounter between a life-hating former soldier who wants to be hanged and a suspected witch who does not wanted to be burned, the story had a tragic outline: Fry's language, however, was a cascade of puns, paradoxes, metaphors, and similes that was Elizabethan in origin and affirmatively exuberant in impact. After its initial showing at the Arts, the play enjoyed a long West End run in 1949 with John Gielgud and Pamela Brown in the central roles and a young Richard Burton and Claire Bloom in support. The play's success&#151;coterminous with that of T. S. Eliot's <span class="italic">The Cocktail Party</span>&#151;seemed to signal a return to poetic drama. For some it was a path to the future. For others, spearheaded by Kenneth Tynan, the return to verse was a retrograde move after a half-century in which prose had been established as a valid instrument of theatrical expression. As Tynan later wrote, &#145;writing verse-plays, like speaking Latin, is an enjoyable intellectual exercise for a minority&#146;  (Beaton and Tynan, 45).<br>
<br>In the immediate post-war decade Fry was a dominant figure in British drama. In 1950 he found himself working simultaneously on a translation of Jean Anouilh's <span class="italic">L'Invitation au ch&acirc;teau</span> as <span class="italic">Ring Round the Moon</span> for Peter Brook and a new play, <span class="italic">Venus Observed</span>, for Laurence Olivier's management at the St James. The latter play proved to be an exquisitely wrought, if sometimes overwrought, autumnal comedy about an amorous astronomer who bids three former mistresses to a solar eclipse and invites his son (typically introduced as &#145;my extension in time&#146;) to choose a stepmother from among them. Although Olivier's presence guaranteed the play's success, Fry seemed on surer ground in <span class="italic">A Sleep of Prisoners</span>, written for Festival of Britain year (1951) and performed in churches in Oxford and London's Regent Street. It deals with four prisoners of war who, in their dreams, re-enact <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> stories including those of Cain and Abel and Abraham and Isaac. But without abandoning his old pun-loving self (&#145;Amor vincit insomnia&#146; ran one line), Fry eloquently and movingly advocated, at a time of increasing cold war tension, peace, charity, and goodness, which he saw as &#145;stronger than anger, wiser than strategy&#146;  (C. Fry, <span class="italic">Selected Plays</span>, 1985, 252). His Christian values, however, were always combined with a highly professional versatility. In 1953 he wrote the screenplay for a notoriously troubled film of <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span> starring Olivier and directed by Peter Brook. In 1954 he produced the third of his seasonal plays, <span class="italic">The Dark is Light Enough</span>, which, although set in an Austrian country house in 1848&#150;9, was clearly a contemporary metaphor for the need to overcome the cyclical nature of war. In 1955 Fry's translations of Anouilh's <span class="italic">L'alouette</span> (as <span class="italic">The Lark</span>) and Giraudoux's <span class="italic">La guerre de Troie n'aura pas lieu</span> (as <span class="italic">Tiger at the Gates</span>) played concurrently in the West End.<br>
<br>This, however, was Fry's perihelion. He became a victim of the radical changes instituted by the upsurge of realistic prose drama at the Royal Court Theatre in 1956. As his mixture of Christian charity, rhetorical richness, and high-flying verse went out of theatrical fashion, Fry turned increasingly to film-writing. In the late 1950s he was invited to Rome for six weeks to rewrite parts of William Wyler's film of <span class="italic">Ben Hur</span>. In the event he stayed more than a year and virtually rewrote the whole movie. He returned to script-writing with <span class="italic">Barabbas</span> (1962) and the early sections of a projected film of <span class="italic">The Bible</span> (1966). Even during his long years in the theatrical wilderness Fry continued to write plays. <span class="italic">Curtmantle</span> (1961) dealt with the conflict between Henry II and Thomas &agrave; Becket but was overshadowed, ironically, by a play on the same theme by Anouilh, whom Fry had done so much to promote. He also completed his quartet of seasonal plays with <span class="italic">A Yard of Sun</span>, dealing with family reunions in the aftermath of war, premi&egrave;red at Nottingham Playhouse in 1970. At the age of ninety-three he was commissioned to write a play, <span class="italic">A Ringing of Bells</span>, by his old school and lived to see it revived at the National's Olivier Theatre.<br>
<br>Although marginalized by the post-Osborne British theatre, Fry remained a magnanimous, cheerful figure who praised the work of such younger writers as Harold Pinter and Tom Stoppard. He also brought colour, spiritual fervour, and an irrepressible verbal &eacute;lan to post-war British theatre. In 1962 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and in 1999 saw <span class="italic">The Lady's not for Burning</span> voted one of the hundred best plays of the twentieth century in a poll organized by the National Theatre. He lived latterly at The Toft, East Dean, Chichester, Sussex. He died of septicaemia and a urinary tract infection at St Richard's Hospital, Chichester, on 30 June 2005. He was survived by his son, Tam.<br>
