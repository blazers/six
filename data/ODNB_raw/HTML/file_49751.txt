<span class="headword">Eyles, Sir  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1703), <span class="occ">merchant and financier</span>, was the first son of John Eyles (<i>d</i>. 1662), a mercer and wool-stapler with a shop in Devizes from 1640 onwards, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1666). Eyles chose to pursue a career in London and it has been widely assumed that, like his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49750/', "Francis Eyles")</script>, he was a haberdasher. But his name does not appear in the Haberdashers' Company's records and it is doubtful whether he was ever a freeman of London.<br>
<br>An original subscriber of &pound;400 to the Royal Africa Company in 1671, Eyles's principal business from at least 1674 onwards was as a commission agent and broker in the Barbados trade in sugar and slaves. Although he was in business with his brother Francis, as Eyles &amp; Co., John was the senior partner and he alone was listed in the <span class="italic">London Directory</span> of 1677. The Africa Company's records list 126 bills drawn on him from Barbados. Eyles handled the sugar exported to England by the Barbados planters and purchased their return cargoes. Since the planters usually needed to settle outstanding liabilities and make purchases in advance of receipts from sales, Eyles provided them with credit.<br>
<br>The firm acted for fourteen years as agent for John Hothersall of Barbados who, in his will of 1694, appointed the Eyleses receivers of the product of his estate and guardians of his children. When a ship captain seized some people of the island of Johanna and sold them in Barbados, the East India Company approached Eyles to redeem them at &pound;25 apiece. Two petitions to the Treasury from Eyles, one in May 1686 and the other on 7 July 1689, suggest that he acted as spokesman for Barbados. His West Indies commission business does not, however, appear to have passed to the next generation.<br>
<br>Eyles, who supported the exclusion of the duke of York from the throne, was elected a member for Devizes by popular outcry in October 1679, but the return was challenged by Sir Walter Ernle and George Johnson, who had been elected by the corporation, and he does not seem to have taken his seat in the Commons. Eyles unsuccessfully again contested Devizes in 1681 and 1689. Despite his political stance, he seems to have remained in favour with the government. He was asked by Henry Guy to report on the accounts of the farmers of the Barbados 4&frac12; per cent sugar duty. The thorough and generally favourable report, which was presented on 26 April 1679, pointed out that the wastage on sales was 4 to 5 per cent higher than among private merchants and that the practice of selling to the same buyers probably brought down prices below market levels. After investing &pound;9000 in a lease of the alnage duty with his son-in-law in 1680, he became a principal farmer of the alnage and his allegedly oppressive tactics in that office became the subject of a committee of inquiry.<br>
<br>Although he obtained a pass for the Netherlands on 28 September 1683, Eyles does not seem to have left England for political reasons. When James II turned to the dissenters, Eyles became one of the whig collaborators. After the Anglican aldermen of London were ejected in August 1687, Eyles was made an alderman of Broad Street by royal commission on 12 August 1687 and he sat until September 1688. He was also knighted on 15 August 1687. Although he never served as sheriff, he did serve as temporary lord mayor, when Sir John Shorter died in office, from 8 September until the restoration of the charter on 3 October 1688. He was also recommended as an honest and fit dissenter in his native county and he became deputy lieutenant for Wiltshire from 1687 until October 1688 and a JP from June to October 1688.<br>
<br>During the French wars, Eyles moved into government finance and exploited his contacts on the continent. In July and September 1689 the Treasury books record total advances of &pound;29,000 on the 12<i>d</i>. aid. In the 1690s, together with his brother, he remitted funds to the English army in Flanders. The contractors in London made arrangements with bankers in the Netherlands so that the Dutch paymaster of the army could draw bills on the English paymaster-general, the earl of Ranelagh. They supplied Ranelagh with letters or bills of credit drawn in Flemish current money (the unit of pay for the soldiers), payable in sterling in London at an agreed rate. In return for a substantial discount, Eyles assumed the risk of exposure to a fluctuating market rate of exchange, with the additional risk of delays in repayment by the government. On 23 July 1690 Eyles was still owed &pound;13,600 and the forces in Flanders lacked subsistence and were in danger of melting away. In 1694, however, the &pound;20,000 which he provided was repaid the same year and, in 1695, Eyles and his brother remitted a further &pound;33,800 for Schuylenberg to be repaid in tallies.<br>
<br>Eyles married Sarah Cowper (<i>d</i>. 1705) of London and they had two sons: the heir, John, married in 1702 Mary, daughter of John Eyles of Chalford, Gloucestershire; the other son, Francis (<i>c</i>.1679&#150;1735), became a major figure in the business world of eighteenth-century London. Eyles and his wife also had five daughters, the eldest of whom, Sarah, married Joseph Haskins-Stiles, the nephew of a Dutch tycoon. The second daughter, Mary, married on 22 September 1691 Sir John Smith, bt, of Islewood, son of Sir John Smith, alderman and sheriff of London.<br>
<br>Sir John Bramston in his <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>  (315) repeated rumours that Eyles was an Anabaptist and he was certainly a strict Baptist who, according to Luttrell  (1.459, 467), shut the chapel at Guildhall when he was lord mayor. He left bequests to Baptist chapels in London and Devizes and gave the Baptists of Devizes the lease of 22 and 23 The Brittox.<br>
<br>Success in London allowed Eyles to acquire landed property in his native county. In 1683 he purchased 2 acres near Devizes from Edward Hope and ultimately he acquired an estate at South Broome in Wiltshire, which served as a country seat for what became a London whig mercantile dynasty. Eyles was buried in the family vault at St Helen, Bishopsgate, London, on 6 July 1703.<br>
