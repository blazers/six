</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Clarke, Sir  Edward George</span>  (1841&#150;1931), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was the eldest son and third of the six children of Job Grey Clarke and his wife, Frances, daughter of Henry George, of Bath. His father, who came from Axbridge in Somerset, kept a small silversmith's shop in King William Street in the City of London, in the rooms over which he lived with his family, and there Clarke was born on 15 February 1841. At the age of ten he was sent for two years as a boarder to College House, Edmonton, where his health, previously delicate, markedly improved. In December 1854 he was taken from the City Commercial School in Lombard Street, where he had spent another two years, to assist his father in the shop, which he did until nearly the end of 1858. In February 1859 he took up a clerkship in the recently established India Office. He won the clerkship by examination. There were 400 candidates and Clarke was placed seventh on the list, a very remarkable achievement considering the character of his education. But he had seized his chances: when serving in the shop he spent any spare time in reading and, after the shop was closed, he attended evening classes regularly, becoming, in 1858, the first associate in arts of the University of Oxford. Moreover he was gifted with a very retentive memory and his industry never flagged.<br>
<br>Clarke found that the life of a clerk in a government office was as little to his liking as that of a shop assistant. In 1860 he happened to hear the aged Lord Lyndhurst make one of his last speeches in the House of Lords and was fired with ambition to be called to the bar and to make such a career for himself. Accordingly, when, later that year, in the interests of reducing the clerical staff at the India Office, the government offered compensation to clerks who were willing to resign, Clarke sent in his resignation and received &pound;253 by way of compensation. It was an act of great courage and self-confidence&#151;qualities which Clarke displayed throughout his life&#151;to give up an assured competence for the hazards of a career at the bar, more especially since several years would necessarily elapse before he could be called and begin to earn an income at that profession. During those years he supported himself by reporting law cases and parliamentary debates and by writing literary reviews; but in addition to those sources of income he obtained, in 1861, one of the Tancred studentships at Lincoln's Inn which provided him with an income of &pound;95 for six years. In June 1861 he was admitted as a student of Lincoln's Inn; in November 1864 he was called to the bar; and in 1880 he took silk. He became a bencher of his inn in 1892 and was treasurer in 1906. From the time when he became a QC he was beyond all question one of the most eminent, if not the most eminent, of the leaders of the common-law bar. He was an admirable forensic orator in jury cases, and for many years he was engaged on one side or the other in most of the important cases on the common-law side of the High Court.<br>
<br>From the time when he quitted the India Office, Clarke took an active interest in politics. He was a strong Conservative and an enthusiastic admirer of Lord Beaconsfield. He was one of the first members of the National Union of Conservative Associations, representing York, in 1867. In February 1880 he stood as the Conservative candidate at a by-election for the borough of Southwark and won a notable victory over his Liberal opponent. He was defeated at the general election which took place in April of that year; but he was elected at a by-election for Plymouth in July, and for the next twenty years he represented that constituency in the House of Commons.<br>
<br>While making a name for himself at the bar Clarke worked hard for the Conservative cause both in parliament and in the country and when, in the summer of 1885, Lord Salisbury formed his first administration, Clarke had reasonable grounds for thinking that he might be appointed one of the law officers. His claims were, however, disregarded. Richard Webster, subsequently Viscount Alverstone and lord chief justice of England, who was not then and had never been a member of parliament, was appointed attorney-general. On hearing a rumour that Webster would be thus appointed Clarke actually wrote to Salisbury that it would be a mistake to make such an appointment and at the same time with characteristic frankness he sent a copy of the letter to Webster himself. In the following year, when Salisbury, after the defeat of Gladstone's first <span class="roman">Home Rule Bill</span>, was again called upon to form a government, Clarke's claims were recognized and he was appointed solicitor-general (and knighted), an office which he continued to hold until 1892 when the government resigned and Gladstone formed his last administration. Although solicitor-general, he was Captain W. H. O'Shea's counsel during the divorce proceedings in 1890 which brought down Parnell.<br>
<br>The general election of 1895 gave the Unionist Party a clear majority over the combined forces of the Liberals and the Irish nationalists and Lord Salisbury became prime minister for the third time. He invited Clarke to resume the office of solicitor-general subject, however, to the condition, which Webster as attorney-general had accepted, that he would not take any private practice so long as he held the office. Clarke refused the office on that condition. Two years later Salisbury offered Clarke the important judicial office of master of the rolls, but Clarke declined that office also, because it would have precluded him from taking any part in politics. During the parliament which sat from 1895 to 1900 Clarke, although sitting as a private member on the government side of the house, seems to have developed a cross-bench mind. He criticized the conduct of the Foreign Office in the matter of the Venezuelan boundary dispute; he crossed swords with the chancellor of the exchequer, Sir Michael Hicks Beach, on the subject of Irish taxation; and he denounced the conduct of the colonial secretary, Joseph Chamberlain, with regard to the Boer republics. He even went so far as to suggest that Salisbury should himself take over from Chamberlain the management of South African affairs. His speeches on these subjects&#151;for Clarke considered it his duty to express his opinions publicly&#151;were very displeasing to many of his supporters in Plymouth. He was asked in 1900 to resign his seat, and did so.<br>
<br>At the general election of 1906 Clarke was elected as the senior member for the City of London; but in May he resigned his seat, ostensibly on the ground that his health was no longer good enough for both his work at the bar and his parliamentary duties. Thus at the age of sixty-five he abandoned the political ambition which he had formed when he was a clerk at the India Office. He continued in practice at the bar until 1914, retiring nearly fifty years after the date of his call. The position which he had attained in the profession is marked by the fact that in 1908 he was sworn of the privy council, and that on his retirement the bench and bar gave him a dinner in Lincoln's Inn hall, at which the prime minister, H. H. Asquith, presided. When W. F. Monypenny died, Clarke applied to finish the official life of Disraeli; being refused, he published his adulatory <span class="italic">Benjamin Disraeli</span> (1926).<br>
<br>Clarke was twice married: first, in 1866, to Ann (<i>d</i>. 1881), eldest daughter of George Mitchell, builder, of Camberwell; second, in 1882, to Kathleen Mathilda (<i>d</i>. 1944), daughter of Augustus William Bryant. With his first wife he had one son and three daughters, the eldest of whom died in infancy and the second as a child; with his second wife he had two sons, the younger of whom died at birth. The surviving son of this marriage was the intelligence officer and code-breaker <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67775/', "William Francis Clarke (1883&#150;1961)")</script>. Clarke was a staunch supporter of the Church of England, and in 1894 had built at his sole expense a church beside the river at Staines, dedicated in honour of St Peter, and on his retirement from the bar he lived at a house called Peterhouse which he had built adjacent to the church. There he died on 26 April 1931 in his ninety-first year; his ashes were buried in St Peter's Church. On 27 April there appeared in <span class="italic">The Times</span> a long obituary notice which he had himself written and sent to the newspaper eighteen years before with a covering letter expressing the remarkable opinion that an obituary notice of a man who has reached old age should be written by himself.<br>
