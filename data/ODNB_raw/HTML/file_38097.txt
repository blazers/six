<span class="headword">Walker, Sir  Herbert Ashcombe</span>  (1868&#150;1949), <span class="occ">railway manager</span>, was born on 16 May 1868 at 75 Talbot Road, Paddington, London, the only child of Dr George Stephen Walker MRCS, and his wife, Ellen Frances Ley. He was educated at the North London Collegiate School, and studied medicine for one year at St Francis Xavier College, Bruges. It was intended that he should enter the medical profession but for financial reasons this became impossible, and when only seventeen he joined the office of the district superintendent of the line of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) at Euston. He loved the work and soon grasped the essentials of railway operation. By 1910 he was outdoor goods manager for the large southern division of the LNWR and a year later became assistant to the general manager, Sir Frank Ree.<br>
<br>In 1911 Walker was chosen to become general manager of the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) and remained there until 1923. At Waterloo, the LSWR headquarters, there was much to do; many platforms had to be replanned and the rebuilding of the terminus speeded up, but Walker saw at once that he must entice more commuters, and his electrification of the London suburban lines, which was to be pursued long after he was running the future Southern Railway, was of lasting significance. At the outbreak of the First World War, though not the most senior of chief railway officers, he was made chairman of the railway executive committee, which controlled all aspects of railway operation. With characteristic confidence and zeal Walker did both this exacting job and his work at Waterloo. He was knighted in 1915, and in 1917 was appointed KCB.<br>
<br>The <span class="roman">Railways Act</span> of 1921 called for the establishment of four groups in Britain. The southern group, which became the Southern Railway, included the LSWR. Walker emerged as its sole general manager, from 1923 to 1937. Walker knew what he wanted to do at Waterloo and he had the backing of the Southern board. Under his aegis the tentacles of the electrified lines stretched south and west. The port of Southampton was enlarged so that ocean-going liners were attracted to its facilities and in 1933 what was then the largest dry dock in the world was opened by King George V. The programme gave the Southern Railway the biggest electrified suburban system in the world.<br>
<br>Though a firm manager, Walker was no dictator. He appointed able men, such as Alfred and Gilbert Szlumper, Alfred Raworth, E. C. Cox, and John Elliot. Walker fostered cross-channel traffic; in 1929 the Golden Arrow service was inaugurated which, in its prime, ran with almost French <i>&eacute;lan</i>. In 1931 the autocarrier with room for forty cars appeared, the vehicles being hoisted aboard from the quayside. Yet Walker also knew that railways were no longer omnipotent; he became associated with the Great Western Railway in running a coach service to the west and acquired for his company a financial interest in Imperial Airways. He also kept a watchful eye on channel tunnel plans as they came and went. Walker retired in 1937 and joined the Southern board, on which he sat until railway nationalization in 1947.<br>
<br>Walker was physically well made, having stamina and a commanding presence. He looked what he was, a man who knew his job and meant to do it. He wore pince-nez spectacles, a round-ended stiff collar, and a moustache. On board days he would wear a tailcoat. He lacked social graces and had no small talk but this, to some extent, was compensated for by his unfailing memory. He was reputed to be able to stand by the footplate of a steam locomotive knowing at once the names of driver and fireman who, for their part, knew that he had a very good idea of what each did and how he did it. He had a taste for the theatre and when on the continent enjoyed a little gambling at a casino. He became a grand officer of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur and a lieutenant of the City of London. A plaque in Walker's memory was erected at Waterloo Station after his death.<br>
<br>In 1894 Walker married Ethel Louisa (1867&#150;1909), daughter of John Robert Griffith, a solicitor, of Llanrwst, north Wales. After her death he married, in 1910, Lorina Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1874/5), widow of A. Shield, a member of the stock exchange. She was the daughter of Alfred Webb, mechanical engineer. There were no children of either marriage. Walker died on 29 September 1949 at 9 Maresfield Gardens, Hampstead, London.<br>
