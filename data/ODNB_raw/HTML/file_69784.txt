<span class="headword">Channel,  Elinor</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1654), <span class="occ">prophetess</span>, of unknown parents, was an inhabitant of Cranleigh, near Guildford in Surrey. By the spring of 1654 she was married to &#145;a very poor man&#146; and had at least four children, three of whom were very young  (Evans, 2). While sleeping, &#145;a Blow given her upon the heart&#146; woke her up, and &#145;an audible voice&#146; instructed her to go to London and carry a message to Oliver Cromwell, the lord protector  (Evans, 1).<br>
<br>Channel's experiences in the city resembled the early career of Rhys (or Arise) Evans, into whose care she briefly fell, and who had attempted to issue due warning to Charles I and others in the late 1630s. Despite waiting around Cromwell's court over 17&#150;19 April 1654, Channel gained no access to him, though someone directed her to Evans, who took her oral report and shortly afterwards published it as <span class="italic">A message from God [by a dumb woman] to his highness the lord protector. Together with a word of advice to the Commons of England and Wales, for the electing of a parliament</span>. (George Thomason, the bookseller and collector, dated his copy &#145;July 10&#146;.) Channel's later history is uncertain. Evans reports that a woman, answering her description but now struck dumb, was arrested by beadles and taken to Bridewell, though she was immediately discharged to &#145;the wanton mad crew, who flocked about her and abused her&#146;  (Evans, 6); thereafter, nothing is known  (Evans, 1&#150;7).<br>
<br>Channel's message, of itself enigmatic, is glossed by Evans as an adjuration to Cromwell to facilitate the restoration of Charles II. As such, it accords with the numerous pamphlets Evans wrote in the early 1650s. The second part of the publication is Evans's own address to the English and Welsh electorate, urging them to vote for &#145;Men of qualitie that stood Neuters&#146; in the conflicts of the civil war in the elections for the parliament that would meet in the autumn of 1654, in that hope that they would endorse his own objectives  (Evans, 9). Evans claimed that Channel's prophecy had &#145;more truth and substance &hellip; than in all <i>Hana Trampenels</i> [that is, Anna Trapnel's] songs or sayings&#146;  (Evans, 7) though his own brief involvement with her seems opportunistic, politically motivated, and of much less significance than the role Trapnel played in Fifth Monarchism.<br>
<br>Another royalist prophet, Walter Gostelow, formerly milliner to Charles I, would seem to allude to the Channel episode in the epistle to Oliver Cromwell which prefaces his <span class="italic">The Coming of God in Mercy, in Vengeance</span> (1658). He recalls that &#145;A person well known to your Lordship, E. C.&#146;, gave to Cromwell's attendants a paper for his attention and later posted it on the chapel door at Whitehall. He adds the minatory details that, when the paper was thrown into the fire, it set the chimney alight, and that the chapel officer who tore it down from the door subsequently died with a withered hand.<br>
