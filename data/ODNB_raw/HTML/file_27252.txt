<span class="headword">Thomasson,  Thomas</span>  (1808&#150;1876), <span class="occ">cotton manufacturer</span>, was born on 6 December 1808 at Turton, near Bolton, Lancashire, the second son of John Thomasson (1776&#150;1837), a cotton manufacturer, and his wife, Elizabeth Marsh, the daughter of a farmer at Topping, near Bolton. He attended the Friends' Ackworth School from 1813 to 1816, then joined his father, who having been briefly a partner with his sister's husband, John Ashworth, and later manager of Old Mill, Eagley, had set up on his own account at Mill Hill, Haulgh. Rebuilt in 1829, this was a medium-sized mill, combining steam and water power. Following the death of his father, and after a short-lived partnership with his brother-in-law Richard Pennington, Thomasson built a second mill in 1841, an ambitious project at the trough of an intense commercial depression, but one which paid off in the expanding markets of the later 1840s. After further expansion in the 1850s, the firm employed 650 workers and had gained a considerable hold on the production of warps. Energetic and sagacious, Thomasson had a keen practical command of the market for raw cotton, importing on his own account and for speculation. He later took into partnership his nephew Joseph Mellor and his son John Pennington Thomasson (1841&#150;1904).<br>
<br>Thomasson was distinguished among his fellow cotton masters for his strong radical and democratic beliefs. These perhaps owed much to his Quaker upbringing, but on 17 December 1834 he married, outside the society, Maria, the daughter of John Pennington, a cotton manufacturer and merchant. Thereafter (until the Crimean War) he attended with her Bolton parish church. Unusually among his peers, he was a reader of Spinoza and a freethinker; he earned the admiration of G. J. Holyoake (who wrote his notice in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>) and donated sizeable sums to T. H. Huxley. Thomasson's unconventionality was also seen in his support for universal suffrage in the 1830s&#151;for example, his readiness to second Chartist motions at Kersal Moor in September 1838&#151;and in his opposition (as a poor-law guardian) to the full implementation of the new poor law. However, he differed from the Chartists in wishing first to seek the repeal of the corn laws as the best way in which to reverse &#145;the black catalogue of the sins of the landed interest against the comforts of the poor&#146;. He therefore became an early supporter of repeal in Bolton: he promoted in 1838 its Anti-Corn Law Association and, to tory anger, urged free-trade motions within the town council. He also became a leading financial supporter of the Anti-Corn Law League and a close friend of its leaders Cobden and Bright. Thereafter he was one of the staunchest followers of the Manchester school, supporting the National Parliamentary and Financial Reform Association, the peace movement, and the campaigns against the &#145;taxes on knowledge&#146; and for cheap postage. He later became a leading backer (and chairman in 1865) of the National Reform Union and the Reform League. Thomasson was never visibly prominent in these movements but was a ready source of financial support. A fervent admirer of Cobden, he gave generously to the Cobden Testimonial Funds in 1846 and 1860 and later privately donated &pound;20,000 to Cobden's widow. He also acted as one of Cobden's executors, sorting out his tangled business affairs.<br>
<br>Thomasson was intimately involved in the civic life of Bolton. He played a leading part in the movement for its incorporation and served on its council (1838&#150;50, 1853&#150;9). But he was an emphatic advocate of municipal economy, seeking to run public affairs on private business principles. He also defended the Little Bolton Trust (on which he served) and the waterworks (of which he was a director) against the pretensions of the tory-dominated council. An advocate of non-sectarian education and of self-improvement, he served on the committee of the All Saints' British School, and was a patron of the Bolton Mechanics' Institute and of Bolton's industrial school, library, and museum. He was also president of the local Liberal association.<br>
<br>Holyoake's description of Thomasson as &#145;a political economist&#146; seems awry, but he was undoubtedly among the most radically minded of mid-Victorian entrepreneurs, driven by a strong hostility to aristocratic government and a keen desire for the welfare of the people by voluntary means. But he was also privately kind and strikingly generous in individual cases. He enjoyed salmon fishing and shooting in Scotland, often in the company of John Bright. Thomasson retired in 1871, died at his home, High Bank, Haulgh, Bolton, on 8 March 1876, and was buried on 13 March at Turton church, without any church service. His son John Pennington was MP for Bolton (1880&#150;85) and a millionaire, and his grandson Franklin (1873&#150;1941) was the proprietor of <span class="italic">The Tribune</span> newspaper and MP for Leicester (1906&#150;10).<br>
