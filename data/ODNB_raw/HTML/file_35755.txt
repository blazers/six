<span class="headword">Rieu,  Charles Pierre Henri</span>  (1820&#150;1902), <span class="occ">orientalist</span>, born at Geneva on 8 June 1820, was the son of Jean Louis Rieu, first syndic of Geneva, whose memoirs he edited in 1870. His mother was Marie Lasserre. On leaving school, in November 1835 Rieu entered the Acad&eacute;mie de Gen&egrave;ve, where he studied philosophy and science. At Geneva he first took up oriental languages and became the pupil of Jean Humbert, who had studied under the French orientalist Sylvestre de Sacy. In 1840 Rieu proceeded to the University of Bonn, where he was inscribed in the philosophical faculty. There he read Sanskrit and Arabic, and at the same time acquired a thorough knowledge of German. On the completion of his studies in 1843 he received the degree of PhD and published his thesis, entitled <span class="italic">De Abul-Alae poetae arabici vita et carminibus secundum codices Leidanos et Parisiensem commentatio</span>. After a visit to Paris, where he was elected a member of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Asiatique on 8 November 1844, he moved to St Petersburg; there, with Otto Boehtlingk, he edited with notes in German the text of &#145;Hemakandra's Abhidh&acirc;nak&iacute;nt&acirc;mani&#146; or Sanskrit dictionary (1847). During this work he visited Oxford for the purpose of transcribing a unique manuscript in the Bodleian Library.<br>
<br>In 1847 Rieu settled in London and was appointed supernumerary assistant in the department of manuscripts at the British Museum, where in 1867 he became first holder of the office of keeper of oriental manuscripts. He was responsible for the second part of the <span class="italic">Catalogus codicum manuscriptorum orientalium</span> (1871), of which the first part (1846) had been compiled by William Cureton. These were followed by the <span class="italic">Catalogue of Persian Manuscripts</span> (3 vols., 1879&#150;83; suppl., 1895), the <span class="italic">Catalogue of Turkish Manuscripts</span> (1888), and the Arabic supplement (1894). These seven volumes were seen as a monumental achievement which confirmed Rieu's position as an orientalist of the first rank, his reputation based on his distinction as a scholar no less than on his helpfulness as a curator.<br>
<br>In 1871 Rieu married Agnes Hisgen, the daughter of Julius Heinrich Hisgen; they had five sons and two daughters, the translator <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31609/', "Emile Victor Rieu (1887&#150;1972)")</script> being their youngest child. Rieu was also for many years professor of Arabic and Persian at University College, London. On the jubilee of his doctorate, 6 September 1893, he received a congratulatory address from the University of Bonn. In 1894, notwithstanding his advanced age, he was elected by invitation to Sir Thomas Adam's professorship of Arabic at Cambridge, in succession to William Robertson Smith. He resigned his post at the museum in 1895, and died at his home, 28 Woburn Square, London, on 19 March 1902, after a brief illness.<br>
