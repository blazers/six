</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Page, Sir  Francis</span>  (1660/61?&#150;1741), <span class="occ">judge</span>, probably was born at the end of 1660 or in 1661, the second son of Nicholas Page (<i>d</i>. 1696), a country parson whose parish was Bloxham in Oxfordshire. He was admitted to the Inner Temple in June 1685 and called to the bar in June 1690. On 18 December of that year he married Isabella White of Greenwich, Kent; after her death he married, on 11 October 1705, Frances (<i>c</i>.1689&#150;1730), the daughter of Sir Thomas Wheate, first baronet, of Glympton, Oxfordshire. By neither marriage were there any children.<br>
<br>Having begun his legal training somewhat later than was customary Page's career at the bar was slow to develop. Although his whiggish views were said to have prompted him to pen several political pamphlets in his early days as a barrister he came to wider public notice in 1705 as one of four lawyers engaged by Thomas Wharton, fifth Baron Wharton, on behalf of the &#145;men of Aylesbury&#146; in the celebrated case of <i>Ashby v. White</i>, which bore upon the crucial question of whether the House of Commons or the courts of law (and ultimately the House of Lords as the highest appellate authority) had the power to determine the right to vote. The Commons had committed the Aylesbury men to Newgate for having brought proceedings against the local returning officer who had refused their votes, and in February 1705 Page and the other counsel presented their plea in queen's bench for a grant of habeas corpus. The Commons responded by declaring him and his colleagues guilty of a breach of privilege and immediately ordered them into the custody of the serjeant-at-arms. Though granted protection by the House of Lords, Page went into hiding until parliament was prorogued in April.<br>
<br>Page was himself elected to parliament, for Huntingdon in 1708, through the offices of one of his clients, Edward Montagu, third earl of Sandwich, who controlled the borough seat, and he remained an MP until 1713. He featured moderately in proceedings but was not an active spokesman for the whigs, his professional obligations sometimes requiring absences from parliament. In May 1713 he was elected a bencher at the Inner Temple. Having failed to make any headway in his career during the tory administration of Robert Harley, first earl of Oxford, he received rapid promotion from the whigs in the early years of George I's reign. By 28 November 1714 he had been made a serjeant-at-law, he was knighted on 21 January 1715, and a week later he was appointed king's serjeant, a rare distinction which gave him superiority over barristers who were king's counsel. During 1715&#150;16 he served on a special commission for the trial of Jacobite rebels in Lancashire, and on another for investigating the outbreaks of rebellious behaviour in Oxfordshire.<br>
<br>In May 1718 Page was raised to the judicial bench as a baron of the exchequer. His integrity as a judge came under the scrutiny of the House of Commons in 1722, when it was complained that he had acted with corrupt intent in the political affairs of Banbury. The profits of his law practice had enabled him in 1714 to purchase the manor of Middle Aston, in Oxfordshire, which he had consolidated with further acquisitions of land. The borough of Banbury lying nearby, he became involved with the corporation's whig faction, so much so that in 1722, with a general election rapidly approaching, he offered to fund improvements in the town to the tune of &pound;1200 if the corporation would elect a whig of his choosing, Sir William Codrington. A hearing in the Commons on 13 and 14 February ended with a division in which Page was exonerated by a mere four votes.<br>
<br>The following year, however, &#145;Baron Page&#146; had the opportunity of showing himself a true pillar of the whig establishment when it found itself under attack. With deer-stealers at large in Berkshire and Hampshire he took the opportunity, at Winchester assizes in January 1723, to supplement the reading of a proclamation against the &#145;blacks&#146; with his own strict charge against them; and in June he presided over the special commission of oyer and terminer at Reading, a showcase event at which four death sentences and six transportation sentences were meted out over three days to men who had caused menace in Windsor Forest.<br>
<br>In November 1726 Page was promoted judge in the court of common pleas, and in September 1727 was transferred to king's bench. He has often been branded one of the most brutal judges of the Walpolean era, who with a reputation as &#145;the hanging judge&#146; exemplified the worst excesses of the eighteenth-century judiciary. These verdicts must be treated with a degree of caution, however, and Page may have been no worse or no better than any other occupant of the bench. A nineteenth-century authority on the lives of the judges, Edward Foss, observed that the few reported trials over which Page presided did not appear to warrant his ill fame but concluded that it was unlikely that he would have been so reviled by leading eighteenth-century men of letters had there been no justification. It was Page's misfortune, however, to have made a particular enemy of the literati of his time through his treatment of the poet Richard Savage, who was tried before him for murder in 1727. Two of Savage's literary friends, Alexander Pope and Samuel Johnson, in addition to Savage himself, subsequently denounced Page in their work in a way destined to ensure his distinctive notoriety. The account of the trial by Johnson in his <span class="italic">Life of Savage</span> (1744) reports verbatim the roaring manner in which Page was supposed to have blatantly misrepresented Savage's defence and incited the jury against him. Pope's <span class="italic">Imitations of Horace</span> (satire 1), published in 1733, contained the couplet:<blockquote>
<div>Slander or poison dread from Delia's rage,<br>
</div>
<div>Hard words or hanging if your judge be Page<br>
</div> (ll. 81&#150;2)</blockquote>which was said to have provoked Page to fury. After Page's death Pope's fourth book of <span class="italic">The Dunciad</span> (1742) included an allusion to him that was damningly footnoted with a declaration that &#145;there was a judge of this name, always ready to hang any man that came his way, of which he was suffered to give a hundred miserable examples during a long life&#146;  (Thompson, 211). There is at least one occasion on record, however, when Page and Pope dined together amicably. Henry Fielding had had the opportunity of seeing Page presiding at the summer assizes at Salisbury in 1739, and in his novel <span class="italic">Tom Jones</span> (1749) described the trial of a horse-stealer that he had witnessed on that occasion (book 8, chap. 11). Fielding drew on and embellished Page's &#145;literary&#146; persona to epitomize the workings of judicial terror, and the judge is seen coarsely haranguing the defendant, denying his counsel a hearing, and condemning the man to death. At the original trial that Fielding had seen Page had in fact acquitted the prisoner.<br>
<br>Page continued to sit as a judge in king's bench until his death, apparently at the age of eighty. There is a story, the provenance of which is uncertain, but quoted by the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, that towards the end of his life, as he shuffled unsteadily one day away from court, an acquaintance enquired after his health. &#145;My dear sir,&#146; came the reply, &#145;you see, I keep <i>hanging</i> on, <i>hanging</i> on&#146;. He died at Middle Aston on 19 December 1741 and was buried on 29 December at Steeple Aston church, near his country seat close to a huge and ornate monument with full-length reclining figures of himself and his second wife that he had commissioned during his lifetime from the Flemish sculptor Henry Scheemakers.<br>
