<span class="headword">Harrison,  Francis Llewelyn <span class="st"> [Frank]</span></span>  (1905&#150;1987), <span class="occ">music scholar</span>, was born on 29 September 1905 in Dublin, the second son in the family of four sons and two daughters of Alfred Francis Harrison, an accountant with the Great Southern Railway and a talented amateur singer, and his wife, Florence May Nash, who was of Welsh descent on her mother's side, and, on her father's (William Nash, of Kilrush, co. Clare, craftsman in inlaid wood), of mixed English and Hiberno-Norman. Both sides of his family belonged to the protestant, urban tradition of Irish society. The young Harrison showed a precocious talent for music, and was educated at the choir school of St Patrick's Cathedral, from which he won one of the two annual cathedral scholarships to Mountjoy School. He continued studies part-time at the Royal Irish Academy of Music, where he won prizes for organ, piano, and composition, and later at Trinity College, Dublin (MusB 1926, MusD 1930). After a short spell as organist at Kilkenny Cathedral (1929) he emigrated to Canada in 1930.<br>
<br>Harrison was to spend two decades on the other side of the Atlantic. His first posts were within the church music sphere in which he had established himself in Ireland. Alongside this he built up a flourishing career as a private music teacher, organist, and composer. In 1933 he studied with Marcel Dupr&eacute; in France, and in 1943 he won the Canadian Performing Right Society's composers' award. But from 1935, when he was appointed resident musician to Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, his career was to be chiefly within academic institutions. In 1940 he opened the university's new music department. After spending 1945&#150;6 as Bradley-Keeler fellow at Yale, studying with Paul Hindemith and Leo Schrade, and posts at Colgate University, New York (1946&#150;7), and Washington University, St Louis (1947&#150;50), he went to England in 1950 and settled in Oxford, as lecturer in music in 1952&#150;6, senior lecturer in 1956&#150;62, and reader in the history of music from 1962 to 1970. From 1965 to 1970 he was a senior research fellow of Jesus College.<br>
<br>The decade in Canadian and North American universities was responsible for changing the focus of Harrison's musical interests. Composition seems to have been virtually abandoned after he went to Oxford, and his appearances as a performer became sporadic. For a highly imaginative man, the challenge of devising humanities curricula from scratch, in a climate suffused with left-wing cultural politics, had left an indelible mark. The need to understand how processes of artistic production, and those of music in particular, related to social structures and assumptions was to be the mainspring of his work for the rest of his life. In Oxford he immersed himself in a study of pre-Reformation insular liturgical music&#151;then an uncharted field&#151;and rapidly established himself as an expert of international repute. His <span class="italic">Music in Medieval Britain</span> (1958) is a remarkable combination of both encyclopaedic positivism, using mainly manuscript sources alongside liturgical evidence then rarely admitted into musicology, and a rigorous concern to establish the music's comprehensibility in terms of its context. He was also involved with two major editorial projects: <span class="italic">Polyphonic Music of the Fourteenth Century</span>, published by Oiseau-Lyre, from 1962 to 1986, and the <span class="italic">Early English Church Music</span> project initiated by the British Academy at his instigation (1961&#150;72). Among his other publications was <span class="italic">The Eton Choirbook</span> (3 vols., 1956&#150;61). By nature restlessly inquisitive, Harrison was not content with ploughing a single furrow. During the 1960s, while consolidating his reputation as a medievalist (he was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1965), his interest in what he dubbed &#145;anthromusicology&#146; led him to explore musical culture more widely, and he undertook important fieldwork in Latin America. This expansion of his activities led in 1970 to the offer of the chair in ethnomusicology at Amsterdam, which he held until 1976. In Amsterdam Harrison's formidable capacity for hard work was stretched in numerous directions. While establishing his department on a new footing and moulding it as a centre of international academic excellence, he also engaged in fieldwork on the music of Latin America and the Celtic peoples, as well as continuing research on medieval Europe. Throughout the 1970s he continued to accept visiting posts abroad, particularly in North America, where he was much in demand. On a return to Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, in 1974 he was awarded an honorary degree of LLD, and was present at the inauguration of the Harrison&#150;Le Caine concert hall, named in his honour.<br>
<br>Harrison was a stocky energetic figure, who spoke in tones that recalled both his homeland and his years in North America, and who always took great care with his appearance. A gregarious character, with personal as well as academic interest in people and their activities, he had a wide international circle of friends. As an &eacute;migr&eacute; he carried with him a capacity to make a home almost anywhere, and he was an informed enthusiast for international cuisine. In 1927 he married Norah Lillian, daughter of William Thomas Drayton, antique dealer; they had two daughters. The marriage was not a happy one and there was a divorce in 1965. In 1966 he married Joan, daughter of Edmund Thomas Rimmer, schoolmaster. She had been since 1960 his companion in his exploration of the world's music. There were no children of the second marriage. Harrison died in Canterbury, Kent, where they retired, on 29 December 1987.<br>
