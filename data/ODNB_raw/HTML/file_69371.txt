<span class="headword">Treherne <span class="st"> [Treheyron]</span>,  George</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1528), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, came from a Welsh family and was perhaps resident in Herefordshire, where he had many professional connections. In 1498 and 1503 he was accused before the king's council of disorder in what seems to have been a fracas involving the inns of court and chancery, and so it appears he was a member of an inn of chancery by the former date, though 1503 is the year of his admission to Lincoln's Inn. He was practising as an attorney of the common pleas, for Herefordshire clients, by 1500, and continued to do so until the 1520s. However, the demarcation between attorneys and counsel was not yet rigid and Treherne also practised as an advocate. He is mentioned as counsel at Buckinghamshire assizes in 1516, at Hereford assizes in 1519, and at Bridgnorth assizes in 1523, and as counsel in the court of requests in 1520. He became a bencher of his inn in 1518 and two years later, in the autumn of 1520, delivered his celebrated reading on the <i>carta de foresta</i>. This was the best-known exposition of the forest law before the publication of the treatise by John Manwood, and still survives in nearly forty manuscript texts, some in law French and some translated into English. One manuscript contains what purports to be a continuation of the reading with a brief exposition of 11 Hen. VII c. 8, concerning usury, but this is not mentioned in any of the other versions.<br>
<br>Treherne read again in 1525, but the subject of his second reading is not known. He held few public offices, though as early as 1501&#150;2 he served as escheator for Herefordshire and by 1513 he was acting steward or under-steward of St Katharine's Hospital near the Tower of London. Although he presumably maintained a home in Herefordshire, where he was on the commission of the peace from 1525 until his death, he is invariably described in records as &#145;of London&#146;. He seems to have married twice. His first wife, whom he married before 1508, was Elizabeth, widow of Richard Horton of Burford, Oxfordshire. His second wife was called Margaret; she survived him and married Richard Tracy. He died after January 1528, when he acquired a manor in Gloucestershire, and before September 1528, when an action of debt was brought by his widow. He may have left children. A John Treheyron was receiver in London for New College, Oxford, in the 1530s; and a Thomas Treheyron was sued for dues by Gray's Inn in 1539.<br>
