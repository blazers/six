<span class="headword">Forz <span class="st"> [Fortibus]</span>,  William  de</span>, count of Aumale  (1191<span class="mult">x</span>6&#150;1241), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, raised one of the most serious threats to the stability of England during the minority of Henry III.<h2>
<a name="Parentageandinheritance"></a>Parentage and inheritance</h2>His title and lands in England and Normandy were inherited through his mother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59591/', "Hawisa, countess of Aumale (d. 1213/14)")</script>, a royal ward who married first William de Mandeville, earl of Essex (<i>d</i>. 1189); second, in 1190, Forz's father, William de Forz 
    (or Fors; <i>d</i>. 1195)
  , a Poitevin naval commander who accompanied Richard I on crusade; and finally the Fleming Baldwin de B&eacute;thune (<i>d</i>. 1212). The surname Forz (used on the seals of both father and son) was derived from one of two places named Fors in Poitou. He is sometimes called &#145;earl of Albemarle&#146;, but incorrectly: he did not hold an English earldom, but, like his mother, took his title from Aumale, a small <i>comt&eacute;</i> in north-eastern Normandy.<br>
<br>Nothing is known of William de Forz as a young man. After his mother's death in 1214 he came to England (perhaps from Poitou) under safe conduct, to speak with the king about his inheritance; his journey was the result of petitions by Robert de Ros (<i>d</i>. 1227). In September or October 1214 John gave back to William de Forz all the lands in England of his mother's inheritance, with the proviso that he should have no receipts or profits until he had married Aveline, daughter of Richard de Montfichet of Stansted, Essex. The young man was first addressed as count of Aumale in royal charters of November 1214. His English lands consisted principally of the honours of Holderness and Skipton in the East and West Ridings of Yorkshire, Cockermouth in Cumberland, lands in Lincolnshire around Barrow-on-Humber in the north and Castle Bytham in the south, and a number of manors elsewhere. The Norman <i>comt&eacute;</i> was lost to the French before he inherited; he had some Poitevin lands and a connection with the &Icirc;le d'Ol&eacute;ron.<h2>
<a name="Shiftingallegiancesinthecivilwar12151217"></a>Shifting allegiances in the civil war, 1215&#150;1217</h2>William de Forz arrived in England amid the ferment of northern discontent leading to <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span> and civil war. He may have been influenced in his political choice by Robert de Ros (a leading northern baron), Richard de Montfichet his brother-in-law, and Fulk d'Oyry (steward for the counts and countesses of Aumale for many years), all of whom opposed King John. The count joined the rebel barons in time to become one of the committee of twenty-five executors of <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span>, to which he was the second witness in June 1215 [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93691', "Enforcers of Magna Carta")</script>]. He rapidly changed sides, however, and by August was with the king, attesting charters and being granted rebel lands. He was also admitted, at the king's command, to Scarborough Castle. When, in December 1215, King John set off on a punitive expedition to the north, Forz accompanied him; and he gained many lands in this and the following year from the dispossessed, together with the castles of Rockingham, Sauvey, and Bytham. Although William de Forz deserted John briefly in June 1216, he returned to royal service by the autumn. At the beginning of Henry III's minority Forz was an active supporter of the young king. He sealed the reissue of <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span> in 1216 (and was to do so again in 1225). During 1217 he was sent a stream of royal orders concerning the confiscation and restoration of lands. He was present throughout the main events of the war between the king's party and Prince Louis.<h2>
<a name="ThewarofBytham"></a>The war of Bytham</h2>After the war successive government attempts were made to reclaim from William de Forz the additional possessions he had acquired: prisoners, hostages, lands and manors seized unlawfully (including the Edenham manor of Gilbert de Gant, the royal castles of Rockingham and Sauvey, and the castle of Bytham, Lincolnshire, whose ownership was in dispute). These moves, especially in relation to the castles, were resisted by the count, and he compounded his disobedience by taking part in a forbidden tournament at Brackley. During 1218 his daughter's intended marriage to the son of William (I) Longesp&eacute;e, earl of Salisbury, was broken off; the earl wrote to the justiciar Hubert de Burgh (<i>d</i>. 1243) disowning any acquaintance with Forz's plans. On 30 November 1219 the sheriffs of six midland and northern counties received letters listing the count's offences and warning the men of the shires not to aid him in any way. In spite of this he managed to keep the castles until May 1220, when Rockingham and Sauvey, threatened with siege, surrendered to the king in person. Bytham, however, he retained. In the south-western corner of Lincolnshire, it had been in the possession of the counts of Aumale since their arrival in England in the eleventh century, and there had been a castle there since at least 1141. It was part of, and probably the <i>caput</i> of, the Aumales' southern Lincolnshire demesne, but nevertheless it had been alienated to the Coleville family by William de Mandeville, earl of Essex, the first husband of Hawisa, the Aumale heir, who was William de Forz's mother. The count was granted Castle Bytham in time of war in 1215, and although in 1217 William de Coleville regained the lands outside the castle gate by legal process, the count continued to refuse him the castle and attempted for many years to overthrow the decision of council and court.<br>
<br>In addition to the trouble over Castle Bytham, in 1220 William de Forz was baulked in his proposed appointment as seneschal of Poitou and Gascony. He was passed over a second time at the Christmas council of 1220, and, without seeking the king's permission, he left the court at Oxford during the night to raise rebellion in Lincolnshire. The Worcester annalist gives a number of reasons for the rebellion, and modern historians have suggested others, including the government's general resumption of former royal demesne; the central problem seems, however, to have been Bytham, and Forz's brief rebellion was known to contemporaries as &#145;the war of Bytham&#146;.<br>
<br>Forz unsuccessfully attacked the castles of Newark, Sleaford, and Kimbolton, but was successful in taking Fotheringhay Castle, Northamptonshire, in January 1221. He was excommunicated by the papal legate Pandulf (for the second time) and the council ordered the assembly of an army at Northampton. Forz, meanwhile, garrisoned Fotheringhay and Bytham, and from there issued letters of protection to the mayors of the cities of England, as if he were king. The royal army, collecting a number of siege engines, master carpenters, and miners, threatened his midland castles, and at the end of January 1221 he went north, where most of his estates lay, and ultimately claimed sanctuary in Fountains Abbey, Yorkshire. The desperate journey to the north, including the abandonment of foundered horses, and even some of his conversation with his wife, was recorded by a government spy who rode with Forz. The government was lenient to him: although Castle Bytham was razed and its site returned to Coleville, Forz and his men were pardoned. This leniency, was, as Wendover wrote, a bad example to others. Forz was, however, in company with other barons of England, charged with scutage on his knights' fees for the campaign of Bytham against himself. He made one further attempt through the courts, in 1236, to regain Castle Bytham, but failed.<h2>
<a name="Latercareerdeathandlegacy"></a>Later career, death, and legacy</h2>William de Forz was at odds with the government again in 1223, in a group who made an armed demonstration against the Tower of London, demanding the removal of Hubert de Burgh. In 1224 his loyalty was suspected in the campaign against Falkes de Br&eacute;aut&eacute; (<i>d</i>. 1226). His actions at this time may have been driven by his dislike of Hubert de Burgh, and also by his association with &#145;foreigners&#146;&#151;other Poitevins, as opposed to the Anglo-Normans. After Br&eacute;aut&eacute;'s defeat, however, Forz played a more statesmanlike role in government. He received lands and favours and was sent abroad on diplomatic and military missions. In 1227 he went to Antwerp to treat with the envoys of the emperor. He went to Poitou in 1230 with the king, and then to Brittany where the barons, who were supposed to be on campaign, amused themselves &#145;as though they were at a Christmas party&#146;  (Powicke, 183). He attended the colloquium in 1237 to deal with Llywelyn ab Iorwerth, prince of Gwynedd (<i>d</i>. 1240); and in the same year was made custodian of the lands of the late earl of Chester (to which Forz's son had a claim). His last political involvement was in 1241, when he was twice summoned to Gregory IX's projected council against the emperor, Frederick II.<br>
<br>During the autumn of 1239 Forz's wife, Aveline, died, and she was buried at Thornton Abbey, Lincolnshire. In the spring of 1241 Forz set out for Jerusalem; after being unable to eat for eight days, he died on the voyage, at the end of March 1241. His place of burial is unknown. He was succeeded by his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29480/', "William de Forz (d. 1260)")</script>. Forz continued his family's patronage of existing religious houses, but did not make any new foundations. Almost all of his surviving charters were confirmations of earlier gifts by his predecessors or his tenants.<br>
<br>Forz was a man of mercurial temperament, who, in years of conflicting loyalties, changed sides more quickly than most. Both contemporaries and modern historians remark upon his turbulence, lack of resolution, and impulsiveness. The rapidity with which he was pardoned his successive offences suggests that he had some genuine grievances, perhaps connected with the threats to his inheritance posed by both King John and the regents for Henry III. In addition to the penalties he incurred through his inconstancy, he, or his officers, were incompetent administrators; free of family debt on inheritance, by 1226 he owed money to Jewish financiers and he was heavily indebted to the exchequer by 1231&#151;these debts he left to his son. Of his many recorded lawsuits he lost all save one (which ended in a fine), and most were lost by carelessness or recalcitrance, as neither Forz nor his attorney came to court, so that the cases went by default.<br>
<br>William de Forz's seal depicts him on horseback, in armour and brandishing a sword; the counterseal shows his shield of arms, a cross patonce vair, both giving his surname and title as &#145;De Forz Comitis Albemarlie&#146;.<br>
