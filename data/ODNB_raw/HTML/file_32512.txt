<span class="headword">Colton, Sir  John</span>  (1823&#150;1902), <span class="occ">businessman and politician in Australia</span>, one of the five sons of William Colton (1795&#150;1858), a Devon farmer, and his wife, Elizabeth, was born at Harbertonford, Devon, on 23 September 1823. When he was sixteen his family obtained free passage to Australia, and his father took up wine growing as a tenant farmer in McLaren Vale, South Australia. John was apprenticed to an Adelaide saddler. In 1842 he set up his own saddler's shop, which developed into a substantial manufacturing and retail business called Colton &amp; Co. On 4 December 1844 he married Mary, the daughter of Samuel Cutting of London. Of their five children, two sons entered the family business, from which Colton himself retired in 1883.<br>
<br>Colton entered public life in 1859 as an alderman of the city of Adelaide, and was mayor in 1874&#150;5. He was elected to the South Australian house of assembly in March 1862 as member for Noarlunga, which he represented, with short intervals, throughout his public life. A firm liberal, he served from November 1868 to May 1870 as commissioner of public works in the Strangways ministry. He was out of political life between 1870 and 1872, but was re-elected in the latter year and was briefly treasurer under Sir James Boucaut in 1875&#150;6. As premier and commissioner of public works from June 1876 until October 1877 he had time to persuade parliament to pass a single consolidating <span class="roman">Land Act</span> to replace the existing thirty-three.<br>
<br>Colton resigned his seat for Noarlunga on 29 August 1878 on account of ill health, but re-entered parliament on 6 January 1880, when he sat with the opposition because of his antipathy to the property tax. In June 1884 he again became premier and chief secretary. His government carried a bill which settled the long-disputed details of land and income taxation and instituted progressive legislation on public health and land tenure, encouraging agriculture on the best lands, while giving pastoralists greater security of tenure elsewhere. Defeated in June 1885, Colton led the opposition for a time, but at the close of the parliament he again withdrew from public life owing to ill health, and visited England.<br>
<br>A staunch Wesleyan, Colton was benefactor and trustee to more than a hundred Wesleyan churches in the colony. He worked enthusiastically for temperance and himself shunned worldly pleasures such as dancing and theatregoing. Severe and rather humourless, he was none the less generous with his time and money in the causes of public health, religion, and education. He was long treasurer and benefactor of Prince Alfred College, Adelaide.<br>
<br>Colton was made a KCMG on 1 January 1891. His wife died in 1898, and he suffered a stroke shortly afterwards; he died at his home in Hackney, near Adelaide, on 6 February 1902, and was buried on 8 February in the West Terrace cemetery in that city.<br>
