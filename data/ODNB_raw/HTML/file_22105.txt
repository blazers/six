<span class="headword">Philip,  John Birnie</span>  (1824&#150;1875), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born in London on 23 November 1824, the son of William and Elizabeth Philip. In 1842 he entered the Government School of Design at Somerset House, London, where he studied under the painter John Rogers Herbert. Through Herbert, Philip met A. W. N. Pugin who engaged him to assist with designs for wood-carvings (<i>c</i>.1844&#150;1845) in the House of Lords at the Palace of Westminster, London. Much later (1868&#150;9) Philip renewed his links with this building, executing eight statues of monarchs for the royal gallery.<br>
<br>After visiting Rome in 1848&#150;9, Philip resumed what proved to be a lifelong career specializing in architectural decoration. His longest and closest association was with George Gilbert Scott, the most prolific and successful architect in mid-Victorian Britain. Scott valued Philip's versatility in stone-carving and metalwork, engaging him on many commissions from 1852 onwards. Examples include the evangelist statues and tympanum relief of <span class="italic">St Michael Overcoming Satan</span> (<i>c</i>.1856&#150;1860) for St Michael Cornhill, London, and the font, reredos, and Katherine Parr monument (1859&#150;<i>c</i>.1865) for St Mary's Church, Sudeley, Gloucestershire. His metalwork skills are evident in his figures on the crossing screen (1859&#150;63) at Lichfield Cathedral, executed in conjunction with Francis Skidmore. Nikolaus Pevsner described this high Victorian creation as an example &#145;of the highest craftsmanship and an ornament to any cathedral&#146;  (N. Pevsner, <span class="italic">Staffordshire</span>, 1974, <span class="roman">The Buildings of England</span>, 186). Philip's last major work for Scott was the spandrel reliefs (1873&#150;5) which he and Henry Hugh Armstead executed for the Government Offices building, Whitehall, London. Although Philip was less imaginative than Armstead, his carvings are better suited to their architectural context.<br>
<br>Philip's best-known work is the marble podium frieze of sculptors and architects (1864&#150;72) for another Scott commission, the Albert Memorial in Kensington Gardens, London. It comprises eighty-seven historical figures, all carved <i>in situ</i>. It is uncertain whether Philip himself chose who was to be represented or whether this was determined by the successive sculptural advisers to the project, Charles Eastlake, A. H. Layard, and Charles Newton. Like Armstead, who carved the adjoining reliefs of poets and painters, Philip aimed at careful historical accuracy and realism. A reviewer in the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> praised him for giving &#145;infinite variety to his design by the costumes of the respective periods &hellip; he has so arranged the figures as to present a series of distinct groups, yet all forming one harmonious whole&#146;  (<span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, 1874). Philip also executed bronze statues representing Geometry, Geology, Philosophy, and Physiology, and two groups of angels immediately beneath the summit.<br>
<br>Philip produced few civic statues, probably because of his many commissions for architectural sculpture. An exception is the Richard Oastler monument (bronze, 1869, Northgate, Bradford). This shows Oastler standing beside a boy and a girl, who represent the exploited factory workers he championed. While the conception is sentimental and the children are better dressed than their real-life counterparts, the group is powerful and convincing. Other large-scale portrait statuary by Philip includes the Lord Elgin memorial (1869) in Calcutta Cathedral and outdoor monuments to the Revd Robert Hall (1870) in Leicester and Colonel Edward Akroyd (1875) in Halifax.<br>
<br>John Birnie Philip died of bronchitis on 2 March 1875 at his home, 280A King's Road, Chelsea, London, and was buried in Brompton cemetery, London. He was survived by his wife, Frances Black (<i>d</i>. after 1902), whom he had married in 1854. Their eldest daughter, Beatrice (Trixie) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73836/', "Whistler, Beatrice")</script>], married the architect and designer E. W. Godwin, and then the painter James Abbot McNeill Whistler. Despite the publicity accorded to the Albert Memorial following its restoration in 1998, Philip has not received his art-historical due. This is partly because his work immediately preceded the more spectacular achievements of the New Sculpture. Moreover, his field of architectural decoration, long considered a craft, has traditionally received far less attention than &#145;fine art&#146; sculpture.<br>
