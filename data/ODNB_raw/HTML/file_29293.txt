</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Whitehead,  Paul</span>  (1710&#150;1774), <span class="occ">satirist</span>, was born on St Paul's day, 6 February 1710, in Castle Yard, Holborn, London, and baptized on 17 February at St Andrew's, Holborn, the youngest son of Edmund Whitehead, a prosperous tailor, and his wife, Elizabeth. According to early biographers Paul was educated under a clergyman in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, then apprenticed to a mercer in the City, but, not liking that trade, studied law at the Temple while writing occasional political squibs. His name cannot now be traced in the records of any of the inns of court, nor can any early squibs be identified, but he was apprenticed in 1724 to John Wheatly, a painter&#150;stainer.<br>
<br>Whitehead's first notable satire, <span class="italic">The State Dunces</span> (June 1733), in heroic couplets, was inscribed to Pope and indebted to <span class="italic">The Dunciad</span> (1728&#150;9), but in so far as Whitehead raises his sights to take in bishops, politicians, and, above all, Walpole, he anticipates Pope's <span class="italic">New Dunciad</span> (1742). Robert Dodsley bought the copyright for 10 guineas, prompting Johnson, who had a low opinion of Whitehead, to insist on no less for his <span class="italic">London</span> (1738). <span class="italic">The State Dunces Part II</span> (1733) is probably not by Whitehead, whose next anti-Walpole satire was <span class="italic">Manners</span> (February 1739), which attacks the government and praises Frederick, prince of Wales, and opposition politicians around him. The House of Lords decreed that <span class="italic">Manners</span> was scandalous and ordered the author and publisher (Robert Dodsley) into custody. Whitehead decamped and Dodsley was not further prosecuted: &#145;the whole process was probably intended rather to intimidate Pope than to punish Whitehead&#146;  (Johnson, 3.180&#150;81). Whitehead's politics and stance of proud, honest independence were close enough to Pope's for the two men to be attacked together in the anonymous <span class="italic">Characters: an Epistle to Alexander Pope Esq. and Mr Whitehead</span> (March 1739), perhaps by Thomas Odell (1691&#150;1749). Whitehead achieved more public notice when, on 9 March 1741, he and Esquire Carey, surgeon to the prince of Wales, organized a mock Masonic procession along the Strand. The joke was repeated in the following year and in both years was the subject of satirical prints.<br>
<br>In 1735 Whitehead had married Anna (<i>d</i>. 1768), only surviving child of Sir Swinnerton Dyer (1688&#150;1736), of Spains Hall, Finchingfield, Essex. Edward Thompson states that she brought him &pound;10,000, but, if this is so, Whitehead did not see the money for some years because it seems that he was imprisoned for debt in the mid-1740s. He befriended the improvident theatrical manager Charles Fleetwood (<i>d</i>. 1747) and not only wrote a pamphlet on his side during the manager's dispute with the Drury Lane actors in 1743, but co-signed Fleetwood's bond for &pound;3000. Fleetwood defaulted and retired to France; Whitehead could not or would not pay and was imprisoned in the Fleet. The date and length of his incarceration are not known, though Thompson writes of &#145;many years&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems</span>, vi&#150;vii).<br>
<br>Whitehead extended his Popeian vein of poetry with <span class="italic">The Gymnasiad, or, Boxing Match</span> (June 1744), a brief mock epic dedicated to the pugilist John Broughton (1705&#150;1789) and tricked out with an introduction and copious notes by &#145;Scriblerus Tertius&#146;. Whitehead returned to political verse satire with <span class="italic">Honour</span> (June 1747), directed against the former patriots, once praised by Pope, who supplanted Walpole and then proved no less corrupt than he was. Two later verse satires attack physicians: <span class="italic">The Battiad</span> (September 1750), on Dr William Battie (1704&#150;1776), written in collaboration with Moses Mendes and Dr Isaac Schomberg, and an <span class="italic">Epistle</span> (November 1755) to Whitehead's friend Dr Thomas Thompson which abuses the many doctors who disagreed with Thompson's treatment of the prince of Wales in his last illness. This poem is redeemed only by some relaxed self-reflexive passages reminiscent of Pope's <span class="italic">Imitations of Horace</span>.<br>
<br>Whitehead's verse became less political but he remained a spokesman for the opposition under the patronage of George Bubb Dodington (<i>d</i>. 1762). At the Westminster election in May 1750, one of the most fiercely contested of the century, he wrote songs, handbills, and other electioneering material for the prince of Wales's candidate, Sir George Vandeput. When Alexander Murray, another supporter of Vandeput, was imprisoned for contempt of parliament in 1751, Whitehead wrote a fierce pamphlet on his behalf. His last opposition writings were two pamphlets supporting Admiral Byng in October 1756 and <span class="italic">Ministerial Influence Unconstitutional</span> (April 1761). Less creditably, it is alleged, he edited in 1748 the blackmailing memoirs of a courtesan and was paid &#145;in kind&#146;  (&#145;Phillips, Teresia Constantia&#146;, <span class="italic">DNB</span>).<br>
<br>It seems that by the 1750s Whitehead had come into his wife's fortune for they now lived at Colne Lodge on the north side of Twickenham Common, a cottage improved into &#145;an elegant dwelling&#146; by his friend the architect Isaac Ware  (Hawkins, 336). Whitehead's other artistic friends included the painters George Lambert and Francis Hayman, and the actors John Beard, for whom he wrote songs, and William Havard (<i>d</i>. 1778), whose tombstone was carved with verses by Whitehead. Presumably it was at this prosperous period that Whitehead's portrait was painted by Gainsborough; the painting is lost, but it was engraved by J. Collyer for Whitehead's <span class="italic">Poems and Miscellaneous Compositions</span> (1777). It conveys an alert humorous expression and portrays the long nose that gave Whitehead some resemblance to Frederick the Great of Prussia. Sir John Hawkins, who was Whitehead's neighbour from 1759, recalled that he was friendly and kind-hearted but his conversation was &#145;desultory, vociferous, and profane&#146;; he retained to the end of his life his youthful habit of swearing, he did not go to church, and was suspected of atheism. Hawkins said that Anna Whitehead was &#145;homely in her person, and little better than an idiot&#146; but her husband treated her with tenderness, &#145;hiding, as well as he was able, those defects in her understanding, which are oftner the subjects of ridicule than of compassion&#146;  (ibid., 335&#150;6).<br>
<br>From the 1750s, perhaps as a relief from his homely wife, Whitehead was one of the scandalous <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/71306', "Franciscans")</script> under their mock prior Sir Francis Dashwood (1708&#150;1781). He became steward and secretary of this famously lewd and blasphemous society, and in Charles Churchill's <span class="italic">The Candidate</span> (1764) was denounced as &#145;Paul, the aged&#146;, a brothel door-keeper who chalks the score &#145;behind a door&#146;  (l. 698). Churchill attacked Whitehead also in <span class="italic">The Ghost</span>, 3 (1762), <span class="italic">The Conference</span> (1763), and <span class="italic">Independence</span> (1764), provoked, not by prudery of course (in view of Churchill's own tastes and associates), but by hatred of a political turncoat who had accepted government places. Through Dashwood's patronage Whitehead was appointed secretary to the treasurer of the chamber at &pound;800 p.a. in July 1761, and obtained another sinecure as deputy wardrobe keeper to the king in May 1763; Dashwood also gave him an annuity. Churchill's further <i>casus belli</i> was that Whitehead was a long-standing friend of William Hogarth: he had praised Hogarth in <span class="italic">Honour</span> (1747) and was probably the author of <span class="italic">Pug's Reply to Parson Bruin</span> (July, 1763), an answer to Churchill's savage <span class="italic">Epistle to William Hogarth</span>.<br>
<br>Whitehead wrote very little during the last twenty years of his life. His last pamphlet, in 1768, was on the feud between the four men who had recently bought the patent of Covent Garden theatre from his friend John Beard. Anna Whitehead died childless in 1768. Suffering a long painful illness that his doctors could not diagnose, Whitehead made his will on 20 October 1774. Most of his estate, worth about &pound;3000, was divided between his widowed sister Sarah Hutchings (executrix), a nephew and three nieces, and his wife's cousin Elizabeth Dyer. (His elder brother Charles, born in 1705, was dead.) Whitehead's last bequest was his heart to his patron Dashwood, now Lord Le Despencer, with &pound;50 for a marble urn in which it could be placed in Dashwood's mausoleum at West Wycombe. In his last days he burnt many papers: perhaps acts and epistles of the Franciscan fraternity. He died at his lodgings in Henrietta Street, Covent Garden, at 7 a.m. on 30 December 1774. His will was proved on 4 January 1775, the day most of his corpse was buried beside his wife at Teddington, Middlesex. The urn containing the heart was ceremoniously deposited in the mausoleum at West Wycombe on 16 August 1775 and was stolen by a tourist in the following century.<br>
