<span class="headword">Tennant,  Harold John <span class="st"> [Jack]</span></span>  (1865&#150;1935), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at The Glen, Innerleithen, Peeblesshire, on 18 November 1865, the youngest child in the family of six sons and six daughters of the industrialist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36455/', "Sir Charles Tennant, first baronet (1823&#150;1906)")</script>, and his first wife, Emma, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Winsloe (1821&#150;1895). He was educated at Eton College (1879&#150;85) and Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1888. On 1 October 1889 he married Helen Elizabeth, daughter of Major Lachlan Gordon Duff of Drummuir, Banffshire (whose son was married to Tennant's eldest sister); they had a son, who died in childhood. His wife died on 9 May 1892.<br>
<br>In September 1892 Tennant was appointed by H. H. Asquith, home secretary in Gladstone's last administration, as an unpaid assistant secretary at the Home Office. He was secretary to a departmental committee to investigate the health of workers exposed to toxic hazards in the smelting and working of lead. In March 1894, standing as a Liberal, he entered parliament at a by-election for Berwickshire brought about by the political changes following Gladstone's resignation, and he remained an MP until 1918. In May 1894 his sister Margot [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30482/', "Asquith, Margaret Emma Alice")</script>] married Asquith, reinforcing his ties to the rising Liberal politician. From 1895 he chaired a departmental committee to investigate working conditions in dangerous trades. On 8 July 1896 he married a fellow member of that committee, May Abraham (1869&#150;1946) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36457/', "Tennant, Margery Mary Edith Josephine Pia")</script>], the first female factory inspector, and a treasurer of the Women's Trade Union League, which sought protection for women workers using lead in the pottery industry. They had four sons (the eldest of whom was killed in action on the western front in May 1917) and one daughter.<br>
<br>Tennant shared the political identification of his father and brother-in-law with Lord Rosebery's imperialist wing of the Liberal Party and was among the Liberal League MPs returned in the landslide of 1906. Overlooked for ministerial office by Campbell-Bannerman, he nevertheless left his mark as a private member by moving an amendment in July 1906 to the government's <span class="roman">Education Bill</span> to make it compulsory for local authorities to undertake the medical inspection of children attending public elementary schools. Promotion followed his brother-in-law's accession to the premiership, and in December 1908 he was made under-secretary to Winston Churchill at the Board of Trade. In 1909 he carried through the House of Commons a major piece of social legislation establishing trade boards to fix minimum wages in low-paid &#145;sweated trades&#146;, a cause which May Tennant, an executive member of the National Anti-Sweating League, promoted. Although the statute was initially confined to four industries, it revived the long-dormant principle that the state should be involved in regulating wages.<br>
<br>In 1911 Tennant became financial secretary at the War Office, and in 1912 under-secretary. During the First World War he had an especially prominent and demanding position in parliament as his departmental head, Kitchener, was in the House of Lords. Tennant dealt with the great volume of House of Commons questions about manpower matters, holding the line until April 1916 in defence of voluntary enlistment in the face of demands for conscription. He also had to respond to the criticisms of Sir Arthur Markham that the voluntary system led to the enlistment of under-age boys. In July 1916, during the ministerial reshuffle following Kitchener's death, Asquith appointed him Secretary for Scotland, with a seat in the coalition cabinet. His period of responsibility for Scottish matters was brief and undistinguished, and his ministerial career ended when Asquith was supplanted by Lloyd George and the Unionist-dominated coalition in December 1916.<br>
<br>Having voted with other Liberal ex-ministers against the coalition government in 1918, Tennant was denied the coalition's &#145;coupon&#146; in the general election of that year, and was heavily defeated by a coalition candidate at Berwick and Haddington (as his constituency had been renamed). That year he published <span class="italic">Letters of a Lowland Keeper</span>, the shooting correspondence of his gamekeeper, reflecting his interest in the management of his Scottish sporting estate. In her indiscreet autobiography (1920) his sister Margot remarked that he had been &#145;petted and mismanaged in his youth&#146; and advanced the opinion that his physical growth had been curtailed as a result of being allowed to walk several miles a day with shooters as a child, compounded by staying up late at night to play billiards with adults  (Asquith, 3&#150;4). The loss of his deposit when he stood for Glasgow Central in the general election of 1923, during the brief period of Liberal reunion, terminated a political career whose direction was largely determined by his family connections and whose extent was precisely framed by the fortunes of the post-Gladstonian Liberal Party. He died on 9 November 1935 at Great Maytham, Rolvenden, Kent, and was buried at Edinglassie, Strathdon, Aberdeenshire.<br>
