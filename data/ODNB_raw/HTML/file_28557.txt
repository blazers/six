<span class="headword">Waller, Sir  Hardress</span>  (<em>c.</em>1604&#150;1666), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer and regicide</span>, was the son of George Waller of Groombridge, Kent, and Mary, daughter of Richard Hardress; both parents were dead by 1622. He was descended from the fifteenth-century soldier and administrator Richard Waller and was the first cousin of the parliamentarian general Sir William Waller. Hardress was knighted in 1629, and in the same year married Elizabeth Dowdall, the daughter of Sir John Dowdall, an Old English (but protestant) landowner from co. Limerick, and acquired a large estate centred on Castletown, on the River Shannon. In the 1630s Waller was involved in Munster society, and became a close ally of the lord president of the province, Sir William St Leger, whom he would later describe as &#145;so dear a friend, and may I say, a father&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Carte 3, fol. 498). He was elected for the borough of Askeaton in co. Limerick in the Irish parliaments of 1634 and 1640. In the latter he became a prominent opponent of Thomas Wentworth, first earl of Strafford, and worked with both Old English and New English opponents of the Dublin administration, travelling to London to present the Commons' petition to the king. He was the only New Englishman to join an Old English petition offering composition payments to avert further plantation in the west of Ireland.<br>
<br>Waller's sympathies with the Old English were crushed by the Irish rising of 1641. When Munster rebelled in late November St Leger appointed Waller governor of Askeaton, and in 1642 he became lieutenant-colonel of St Leger's regiment of foot. On the death of St Leger in June 1642 Waller took control of his regiment, and became an ally of Lord Inchiquin (Morrough O'Brien) in his factional rivalry with the Boyle family, led by Richard Boyle, first earl of Cork. In September 1642 Waller travelled to England to advance Inchiquin's claim to the presidency of Munster, and to lobby for Irish interests in general. His early reports were bleak. In December 1642 he told the earl of Ormond &#145;that they are there so involved in their own danger that a word of Ireland will not be heard&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Carte 4, fol. 83). For the next year Waller remained in England, trying to persuade the king and parliament to settle their differences and turn their attention towards Ireland. Waller's outspoken criticism of Charles I's plan to sign a cessation of arms with the Irish rebels was badly received at court, and he left Oxford in disgrace. In January 1644, when Inchiquin went to Oxford to prevent a peace treaty with the Irish, Waller was left in charge of Munster, and his open hostility towards the cessation riled the confederates, who accused him of being &#145;devoted and affected to the Parliament&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Carte 10, fol. 536). On his return from court Inchiquin sent Waller back to Oxford to lobby the king once more, but he was unable to make any headway before July 1644, when Inchiquin and the other Munster protestants declared for parliament. By the end of August Waller had fled to London.<br>
<br>Waller was appointed colonel of a regiment of foot in the New Model Army in April 1645, and fought at Naseby in June of that year. In October he was wounded leading his men in the assault against Basing House. During this period Waller caught the spiritual enthusiasm of the New Model officers, becoming a religious Independent. He also developed a lasting admiration for Oliver Cromwell. By December 1645 he proclaimed that &#145;Tis certain that our greatest hopes for Ireland is from this army, about which I have had many free and serious discourse with Lieutenant-General Cromwell, whose spirit leads much that way&#146;  (<span class="italic">Egmont MSS</span>, 1.264&#150;5). His support for Cromwell as commander-in-chief was a snub to Inchiquin, and indicates how far Waller had changed his political allegiances since the summer of 1644. Even the choice of the Independent peer Viscount Lisle as lord lieutenant of Ireland proved insufficiently radical for Waller, who complained that &#145;I do not hear the work is like to be carried on by such as carry a two-edged sword in their hearts as well as their hands&#146;  (ibid., 1.280). Despite his initial misgivings Waller supported Lisle, and in December 1646 joined Sir William Parsons, Sir John Temple, Arthur Annesley, and others in calling for the new lord lieutenant's immediate dispatch for Munster. Waller accompanied Lisle in his expedition in February 1647, and tried to take over Inchiquin's army when the lord lieutenant's commission expired in April. The failure of the coup left Waller vulnerable, and for a few days he tried to placate his old commander, in the hope of saving his Munster commissions. When Inchiquin rejected his advances&#151;saying &#145;I would not willingly be joined here with any Independent&#146;&#151;Waller had little option but to return to England  (ibid., 1.395).<br>
<br>From June 1647 Waller was heavily involved in the politics of the New Model Army. His regiment had been prominent in the Saffron Walden debates in May, and he represented the army in its meetings with MPs and the City of London, and presented the army's remonstrance to parliament on 23 June. In August he joined Fairfax's committee of officers, and in October he was chosen to consider the <i>Case of the army</i>. During the Putney debates which followed Waller was keen to prevent religion becoming a cause of division, and urged that such issues should not be discussed. This did not signal a softening of his radical political stance: when it came to negotiating with parliament or the king, Waller was forthright, telling the army &#145;to let them know that these are our rights, and if we have them not, we must get them the best way we can&#146;  (Firth, 1.344). Waller's readiness to use force may have quietened dissent in his own regiment, at least: through the disturbances of late 1647 his men were unanimous in their loyalty to Fairfax. Waller's radicalism continued in the winter of 1648&#150;9. After playing an important part in suppressing the royalist rising in Devon and Cornwall during the second civil war, he returned to London in December 1648, where he seconded Pride's Purge, Thomas Pride's purge of the presbyterian members of the House of Commons, and personally prevented William Prynne from taking his seat. In January 1649 he was appointed a commissioner to the high court of justice which tried Charles I, and he was to miss only one of its meetings. On 29 January he signed the king's death warrant [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "Regicides")</script>].<br>
<br>Cromwell's appointment as lord lieutenant of Ireland in March 1649 was welcomed by Waller, but his regiment was not chosen for the invasion, and he returned to his policing duties in the west country. By the end of November, however, he had been given command of a new regiment for Ireland, and by June 1650 he had been promoted major-general. Waller's Irish service confirmed his reputation as a soldier. He led the siege of Carlow, fought at Limerick, and pursued the defeated Irish into the mountains of counties Kerry and Clare. Having been appointed governor of Limerick in 1651 he used his military position to extend his influence over the whole county, and throughout the 1650s continued to control the local administration and to ensure that his own men were elected MPs for the protectorate parliaments. At first Waller was closely allied to the army interest in Ireland. In 1652&#150;3 he was one of the army's agents in England, where (in February 1653) he presented the &#145;humble representation of the officers of Ireland&#146; against John Weaver, and argued that the army should be treated generously in the Irish land settlement. It was hardly surprising that one commentator saw Waller as having &#145;a great interest in the soldiery&#146; at this time  (<span class="italic">Fifth Report</span>, HMC, 193). The formation of the protectorate undermined Waller's position within the army. Many of the Irish officers were suspicious of Oliver Cromwell's ambition, and began to work against his regime. This grated with Waller's personal loyalty to the new protector, which had been reinforced by the marriage of his daughter to Cromwell's relative Henry Ingoldsby in August 1653. It is significant that when the protector was proclaimed in Dublin on 30 January 1654, Waller was one of only two senior officers present. In later years he worked closely with Henry Cromwell, who governed Ireland from 1655, and this alliance brought him back into contact with the Munster protestants, and especially Cromwell's closest adviser, Lord Broghill (Roger Boyle), some of whose relatives in the Clayton and Fenton families were married to Waller's children. Although Waller did not take his seat as MP for counties Kerry, Limerick, and Clare in the protectorate parliaments, his friends and clients would support the attempts by Broghill and others to establish a civilian &#145;settlement&#146; in the Commonwealth, and (in 1657) they were involved in the attempt to persuade Cromwell to accept the crown.<br>
<br>Waller's loyalty to the regime was based on his personal fealty to Oliver Cromwell. In the late 1650s Waller showed signs of restlessness, and Henry Cromwell warned his father that &#145;your old servant Sir Hardress Waller thinks himself forgotten&#146;  (Thurloe, <span class="italic">State papers</span>, 7.734). Grants of baronetcies to his sons-in-law Maurice Fenton and Henry Ingoldsby were designed to placate Waller, but with the death of Oliver Cromwell in September 1658 there was little to restrain him, and Henry Cromwell included him among the untrustworthy officers who should be recalled to England. From then on, Waller behaved erratically. With the collapse of the protectorate in May 1659, he immediately threw in his lot with the Rump Parliament, and proved his new allegiance by seizing Henry Cromwell at Phoenix Park. His new friends did not trust him, however, and the Irish commander-in-chief, Edmund Ludlow, refused to put him in charge of the army in his absence. In October and November 1659 Waller continued to support the republicans, and signed the Irish officers' letter in support of John Lambert and the English army. In December, however, he joined the Irish protestants' coup in Dublin and refused Ludlow permission to land at Ringsend. In the early months of 1660, as secluded MPs were returned to Westminster and the restoration of the monarchy was expected, Waller panicked, and again seized Dublin Castle. This second coup was short-lived, and he was imprisoned, on Sir Charles Coote's orders, at Athlone, only being released on the intervention of his cousin Sir William Waller.<br>
<br>On the Restoration Waller fled to France, but he returned in the hope of benefiting from the leniency offered to repentant regicides. During his trial in October 1660 he claimed to have signed the death warrant unwillingly, &#145;finding that no dissent of his could have prevented it&#146;, and denied supporting the offer of the crown to Cromwell  (BL, Egerton MS 2549, fol. 93). Such lies seem to justify Edmund Ludlow's attack on Waller as &#145;one who would say anything to save his life&#146;  (Ludlow, 209). Waller was one of only two regicides to plead guilty to the charges against him. He was attainted, but the death sentence was commuted, and he was imprisoned in Mont Orgueil Castle, Jersey, where he died in 1666. After his final arrest most of Waller's friends and family deserted him; but the marriages he had secured for his children ensured that the Wallers regained the estate at Castletown, and remained important figures in Munster into the twentieth century.<br>
