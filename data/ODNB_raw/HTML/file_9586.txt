<span class="headword">Fitzgerald,  Thomas</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Silken Thomas]</span>, tenth earl of Kildare <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Lord Offaly]</span>  (1513&#150;1537), <span class="occ">nobleman and rebel</span>, was born in London, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9555/', "Gerald Fitzgerald, ninth earl of Kildare (1487&#150;1534)")</script>, and his first wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1517), daughter of Sir John Zouche. Little is known about his early years, but after his mother's death he was raised by Janet Eustace, wife of the earl's steward, Sir Walter Delahide. He spent some years at court and married Frances, youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9936/', "Sir Adrian Fortescue")</script>, perhaps before his father's return to Ireland in August 1530. A gunshot wound at Birr Castle left Kildare unable to campaign, and in spring 1533 Lord Offaly, as he was known, led an unsuccessful raid upon O'Reilly. He was apparently again at court in summer 1533. In November Kildare gave him custody of the key border manor of Rathwire, Meath. Following discussions between them about the lordship's government in Kildare's absence, and immediately before sailing for England, Kildare surrendered the sword of state to Offaly at a council meeting in Drogheda in February 1534, nominating him his vice-deputy&#151;to the surprise of his critics, who thought him &#145;yong and wilful and moste to this tyme orderyd by light counsaill&#146;  (<span class="italic">State Papers, Henry VIII</span>, 2.183). In fact, Kildare forbad Offaly to act except by the advice of his leading counsellors, notably Delahide and Janet Eustace.<br>
<br>Following Kildare's arrival at court, Henry VIII (who feared for himself that he was &#145;not like to live long&#146;, and that the Fitzgeralds might create trouble for the incoming governor, Sir William Skeffington) dispatched two officials with instructions to Offaly to convene the council, at which his further pleasure would be declared. Kildare, however, forestalled these plans, sending a messenger to Offaly advising &#145;that he shulde play the best or gentilst parte, and &hellip; not trust to the kinges counsaill ther. For if he did, he shulde be brought perforce into Englande and ther sholde lose his liff&#146;  (LPL, MS 602, fols. 138<i>v</i>&#150;139<i>v</i>). After consulting the earl's counsellors, Offaly summoned a council for 11 June 1534. Riding through Dublin city with a strong company of horse wearing silken fringes on their headpieces (whence his sobriquet, Silken Thomas), he then surrendered the sword before the council at St Mary's Abbey, formally defied the king, and denounced royal policy. These acts of defiance were probably not intended as outright rebellion, but to pressurize the king to confirm Kildare as deputy. There followed a lull as Offaly, awaiting Henry's response, built up support in the English pale and among Gaelic chiefs beyond. It was only about mid-July, upon news of Kildare's arrest on 29 June, that the rebels made serious efforts to win control of the pale.<br>
<br>Essentially, Offaly pursued a three-pronged strategy. Within Ireland, the basis of rebel support was Kildare's extensive bastard feudal connection (notably the pale aristocracy, including key members of the Dublin administration like chief justice Delahide and under-treasurer Bath), plus his Gaelic satellites. This connection remained apparently solid during the revolt's initial phase, until the arrival of the king's army in mid-October. In a bid to harness to his cause traditional regional sentiments among the Englishry, Lord Offaly denounced the king as a heretic and proclaimed that those born in England should leave Ireland immediately on pain of death, requiring instead an oath to himself, the pope, and the emperor. Those who refused were clapped in Maynooth Castle. This crusade won him some support from conservative clerics (notably the English-born chancellor of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, who wrote in support of the papal primacy and was later executed for treason) and a posthumous reputation as a founding father of Irish Catholic nationalism. At least sixty-one benefices were vacant after the revolt. In England, Offaly's propaganda seriously embarrassed the king. Henry apparently offered a pardon and Kildare's release, but not the earl's confirmation as deputy&#151;Offaly's main aim. Abroad, it was widely believed that religion was the real cause of the rising. Yet the agents whom Offaly, O'Brien of Thomond, and, before his death in December, the earl of Desmond dispatched to Charles V and Rome, and the three imperial agents sent by Charles to Ireland, provided little more than prayers, promises, and the odd shipload of arms. The emperor, in fact, viewed the revolt chiefly as a useful distraction to prevent Henry VIII combining with the French during his expedition to Tunis (May 1535), so encouraging Offaly to hold out when a tactical surrender might partly have retrieved Fitzgerald fortunes.<br>
<br>To replace Offaly, the Irish council elected as justiciar the aged Lord Delvin, but Offaly brushed aside their feeble attempts to organize resistance. The earl's political opponents initially took refuge in Dublin Castle, which Offaly besieged, while two more rebel armies campaigned in counties Louth and Wexford. As the siege intensified, English-born officials escaped to England, but Archbishop Alen of Dublin&#151;captured when his ship ran aground&#151;was killed by the rebels (28 July 1534), perhaps as a result of their misunderstanding Offaly's orders. In early August a truce with the citizens allowed Offaly to renew the siege from the city. Despite occasional reverses, Offaly gradually consolidated his control over the pale, Carlow, and Wexford. Desmond, supported by O'Brien and the MacCarthies, held the south-west. Other Gaelic chiefs also intervened, attracted by prospects of plunder. Resistance was largely confined to the Butlers (who rejected Offaly's overtures) and three urban centres, Dublin, Kilkenny, and Waterford. Within the pale, the citizens broke truce in September on the king's orders. His father's death in the Tower on 2 September 1534 made Offaly tenth earl of Kildare, and in a final bid to capture the castle (particularly its military stores) he besieged Dublin with 15,000 men. Very few pale gentry were not &#145;personelly with Thomas FitzGerot, or gave hym aide of men, money or victailes&#146;  (Ellis, &#145;Tudor policy&#146;, 262), even though many participated unwillingly, shooting headless arrows into the city. The rebels, none the less, did considerable damage, breaking into the city before being driven out again.<br>
<br>The situation was transformed with Skeffington's arrival on 24 October with an English army. Kildare enjoyed some initial success in opposing Skeffington's landing of troops at Howth, killing or capturing forty footmen and driving away the ships with his artillery. Yet the pale gentry mostly deserted to the deputy once it was safe to do so, and Skeffington had Kildare proclaimed a traitor from the high cross at Drogheda. Even after the English parliament had attainted the tenth earl in December, however, the gentry &#145;dare[d] not be ernest in resisting of him, in doubte he shuld have his pardon herafter as his graundfader, his fader, and diverse his auncessours have had&#146;  (<span class="italic">State Papers, Henry VIII</span>, 2.222). Rather than risk a pitched battle and prejudice his chances of outside support, Kildare withdrew to Maynooth, which he had prepared against a siege, and burned other parts, &#145;wherby he thinke to inforce this army to departe&#146;  (ibid., 2.226). He was assisted by Skeffington's tactics. The deputy distributed the army into small garrisons, which could be picked off, and then fell sick. Only in late February 1535 did the campaign recommence. Its one significant military event was the ten-day siege of Maynooth, which Kildare's constable surrendered for a bribe on 23 March, after the basecourt had been taken. Skeffington's reputation disappeared with the garrison's summary execution, but the army Kildare had raised to lift the siege melted away upon hearing of &#145;the pardon of Maynooth&#146; (as it was subsequently remembered). The earl fled, initially to Lea Castle, and then into O'Brien's country, intending to sail for Spain to plead for assistance. His other co. Kildare castles were quickly retaken but then, having dispatched an embassy to Charles V and repudiated his English-born wife, he returned to the pale borders and with O'Connor's assistance began sporadic raids on the Englishry. Militarily, these raids had little value, but they were a serious embarrassment to the government. Skeffington's army was ill-suited to the task of hunting down rebels in the Gaelic midlands. Thus when Kildare, despairing of Spanish aid, wrote to Lord Leonard Grey (Skeffington's replacement as army commander and his uncle-in-law), soliciting pardon for his life and lands, Grey and Lord Butler willingly promised him his life.<br>
<br>Kildare surrendered on 24 August 1535 and was brought up to court by Grey. For a few days he remained at liberty: &#145;if he had beene apprehended after suche sorte as was convenable to his deservynges&#146;, the king growled, &#145;the same had been moche more thankfull, and better to our contentacion&#146;  (<span class="italic">State Papers, Henry VIII</span>, 2.280). Yet he was soon sent to the Tower, and was later joined by his five uncles and a leading supporter, Sir John Burnell. Grey pleaded hard for his promise, but the duke of Norfolk's comment, &#145;Quod defertur, non aufertur&#146; (&#145;What defers does not set aside&#146;), more accurately reflected the king's strategy. Only the earl's younger half-brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9557/', "Gerald Fitzgerald")</script>, escaped the general round-up of Geraldines and, after a peripatetic existence in Ireland and abroad, was restored as eleventh earl (1554&#150;85) with most of his father's estates. In May 1536 the Irish parliament attainted the ninth earl, with effect from 8 July 1528, probably so as to secure those estates which were entailed to Gerald, but incidentally depriving Thomas of the title of tenth earl accorded him in the English attainder and so altering the mode of his execution. Yet since the English attainder had specifically excluded two of his uncles, since pardoned, the king's decision to execute them too required a third act of attainder against Fitzgerald and his five uncles, passed by the English parliament in July. Meanwhile, Thomas whiled away his time in very reduced circumstances, dressed in &#145;old hosyn and shoys and old shyrtes&#146; given by other prisoners  (ibid., 2.403), and engraving his name on the wall of the Beauchamp Tower. He had reached THOMAS FITZG<span class="smallcap">ERA</span> when, on 3 February 1537, all six Fitzgeralds, plus Burnell, were:<blockquote>draune from the Tower un to Tyborne, and there alle hongyd and heddyd and qwartered, save the Lorde Thomas, for he was but hongyd and heddyd and his boddy buryd at the Crost Freeres in the qwere, and the qwarteres with their heddes set up abowte the citte. (Nichols, s.a. 1537)</blockquote>Lord Offaly was &#145;ung ieusne home desperit hardy et vaillant&#146; (&#145;a young man of spirit, brave and bold&#146;), so the Spanish ambassador heard  (TNA: PRO, PRO 31/18/3/1, fol. 109). He was remembered forty years later as tall, handsome, and eloquent. He acquitted himself well militarily, but the political difficulties he faced in 1534&#150;5 would have taxed even the most experienced politician.<br>
