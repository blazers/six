<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Landseer,  John George</span>  (1762/3&#150;1852), <span class="occ">engraver and antiquary</span>, was born in Lincoln. Little is known of his childhood or family except that his father was a jeweller and that, at some point during his youth, the family moved to London, where Landseer was apprenticed to William Byrne (1740&#150;1805), a landscape engraver. His earliest single plates, published in Joseph Farington's <span class="italic">Views in the Lake Country</span> (1784&#150;8), were landscape views. Similarly, his first complete series of prints was after James Moore's topographical designs for his antiquarian account <span class="italic">Twenty-Five Views in the Southern Part of Scotland</span> (1794). At the same time, along with numerous fellow engravers, he also worked on entrepreneurial publishing schemes such as Robert Bowyer's lavish illustrated edition of David Hume's <span class="italic">History of England</span> (8 vols., 1792&#150;3), and in 1794 he engraved vignettes after Philippe Jacques de Loutherbourg for an edition of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> published by Thomas Macklin (8 vols., 1800). Indeed, Macklin can be said to have had a great influence on Landseer's life, as it was through this publisher that he met Jane Potts (1773/4&#150;1840). The couple married in 1794 and moved to 71 Queen Anne Street (and later 33 Foley Street), where they had fourteen children, of whom seven survived to adulthood. These were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15987/', "Thomas Landseer (1793/4&#150;1880)")</script>, a printmaker; Jane (<i>b</i>. 1795); <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15983/', "Charles Landseer (1799/1800&#150;1879)")</script>, a painter; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15984/', "Edwin Landseer (1802&#150;1873)")</script>, the acclaimed and knighted painter; Anna Maria (1805&#150;1871); <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15985/', "Jessica Landseer (1807&#150;1880)")</script>, a miniaturist; and Emma (1809&#150;1895), who also painted miniatures. Although John Landseer remained a prolific printmaker and an occasional painter in oils who consistently exhibited work at the Royal Academy until his death, it is sometimes said that his most major contribution to the arts was the nurture and artistic training of his children, especially that of his most celebrated son, Sir Edwin Landseer.<br>
<br>Often described as opinionated, domineering, and embittered, Landseer, &#145;being somewhat deaf&#146;  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 11.3847), carried an ear trumpet and was renowned for having a short temper and for muttering to himself under his breath. His pugnacious character did not help to ingratiate him with his peers; only his friend Joseph Farington recognized that, although &#145;Landseer is warm in His temper &hellip; He does not appear so out of doors to the world, and is not liked by those of His Profession&#146;  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 14.4884). Landseer's reputation for being difficult and cantankerous appears to have had little real effect upon the structure of his career. He frequently collaborated with artists: for example, he worked with the draughtsman and traveller William Alexander and the engraver J. Shirt in producing <span class="italic">An Authentic Account of an Embassy to China</span> (1807). He also engraved designs for some of the major nineteenth-century artists, including both Turner and Constable; the latter of these, on seeing his plate of <span class="italic">Stoke Mill</span> in 1814, described Landseer as &#145;a very superior landscape engraver&#146;  (Parris and Shields, 227). Moreover, Landseer's sense of community is nowhere better represented than in his self-appointed role as the most vociferous and constant spokesman for the liberal status of English engravers.<br>
<br>On 27 December 1802 Landseer delivered an address to the Royal Academy in which he proposed that four engravers should be made full academicians and that a system of medals should be instituted to encourage engraving. In so doing, he championed the grievances of engravers, whom the academy did not consider worthy of the privileged status of full academicians. Landseer's proposals were not heeded. Nevertheless, in 1806 he accepted the post of associate engraver of the Royal Academy in the hope of improving conditions from within the institution. Additionally, in the same year he delivered a series of lectures at the Royal Institution which presented the history and benefits of engraving under the belief that &#145;No Art can flourish in any country unless honoured as an Art&#146;  (Fox, 8). The sixth of these caused controversy as it was deemed to be a direct attack on the publisher John Boydell, who, Landseer claimed, had exploited modern engravers for his own personal gain. Although this was not technically libellous, as Boydell had died in 1804, the latter's nephew Josiah Boydell complained to the committee of the Royal Institution, and Landseer was immediately dismissed from his professorship without even the privilege of a hearing. In order to vindicate his name and to continue his campaign on behalf of engravers, Landseer published his discourses with the addition of a preface which explained his motives.<br>
<br>The success and perhaps the scandal of the <span class="italic">Lectures on the Art of Engraving</span> (1807) &#145;whetted Landseer's appetite for authorship&#146;  (Herrmann, 1.26), though he turned his attentions to more general artistic and antiquarian topics. His next venture, in 1808, was the launch of the critical <span class="italic">Review of Publications of Art</span>. Despite the fact that this journal survived for only four issues and lost him &pound;400 in the process, Landseer attempted another similar project in 1837, with a periodical entitled <span class="italic">The Probe</span>; this also quickly collapsed. Having been elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1807, he published an erudite and polemical essay on ancient Babylonian relics in the society's journal, <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span>, in 1817; he then returned to this topic in an independent volume called <span class="italic">Sabaean researches, in a series of essays on the engraved hieroglyphics of Chaldea, Egypt, and Canaan</span> (1823). During the later part of his career he combined his two interests and published several of his prints with pamphlets which provided additional contextual information on the subjects he engraved. This was the case with his engraving of Edwin Landseer's <span class="italic">Alpine Mastiffs Reanimating a Distressed Traveller</span> (1831) which was accompanied by his father's essay <span class="italic">Some Account of the Dogs and the Pass of the Great St Bernard</span> (1831).<br>
<br>Although there were few tangible results, Landseer continued to campaign for the improved rights of engravers for the rest of his life. In 1810 he proposed a plan for a society and academy of engravers and in 1836 he joined in a petition to the House of Commons which once again attempted to influence the structure of the Royal Academy. This petition was received favourably by a select committee, but a subsequent appeal to the king was unsuccessful, and it was not until 1854 that an engraver was accepted as a full academician. Nevertheless, Landseer was personally honoured when, in 1837, he was appointed engraver to William IV. He died at his home, 8 Southampton Street, Fitzroy Square, London, on 29 February 1852, aged eighty-nine, and was buried at Highgate cemetery, Middlesex.<br>
