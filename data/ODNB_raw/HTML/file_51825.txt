<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Davis, Sir  John Henry Harris</span>  (1906&#150;1993), <span class="occ">businessman</span>, was born on 10 November 1906 at 148 Monega Road, East Ham, Essex, the son of Sidney Myring Davis, a schoolmaster, and his wife, Emily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Harris (christened John Henry, Davis later adopted his mother's maiden name as a further forename). He was educated at the City of London School, which he left in 1924 to become a chartered secretary. In later years he liked to refer to himself as a chartered accountant, but there is no record that he ever qualified as such.<br>
<br>Davis married his first wife, Kathleen Blanche Mary Coryn (<i>b</i>. 1904/5), daughter of Bertram Coryn, a merchant, on 29 November 1930. This was the first of six marriages, though in later life Davis preferred to omit two of them&#151;the first and the third&#151;from the records (he also gave a false date for the second marriage). With Kathleen Coryn he had a son, Michael, and a daughter, Barbara. On 23 January 1937 he married Joan Grace Buckingham (<i>b</i>. 1916), daughter of Frank Henry Buckingham, a clerk in the Paymaster-General's Office; they had a son, Christopher. On 22 December 1941 he married Jeanne Beryl Stephens (1918&#150;1988), daughter of William James Stephens, a company director; this marriage lasted only three months. His fourth wife was Marion Louise (<i>b</i>. 1918/19), daughter of Thomas Sydney Gaved, an antique dealer. She had already changed her surname to Davis by the time of their marriage, on 21 April 1947; they had two daughters, Janet and Susan. On 3 March 1954 Davis married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/105795/', "Dinah Sheridan (1920&#150;2012)")</script>, the film actress and star of <span class="italic">Genevieve</span>, daughter of James Arthur Sheridan, a photographer, and former wife of Jimmy Hanley, the actor. His final marriage, on 5 March 1976, was to Felicity Mary Rutland (<i>b</i>. 1937/8), a company director, divorcee, and the daughter of Colonel Mathew Arnold Drew, army officer. All Davis's marriages except the last ended in divorce.<br>
<br>In 1932 Davis joined the British Thomson-Houston Electrical Group as an accountant. Even at this early stage of his career he was gaining a reputation for ruthlessness; it is said that one employee of the company killed himself as a result of Davis's abrasive methods. Thomson-Houston was a leading manufacturer of cinema equipment, much of it supplied to the Odeon theatre chain founded by Oscar Deutsch. In 1938 Davis joined Deutsch as his chief accountant. In 1942, following Deutsch's untimely death, the Odeon chain was absorbed by the rapidly expanding Rank empire, well on its way to becoming the dominant force in the British film industry. Davis was appointed managing director of Odeon, and in 1946 became managing director of the whole Rank Organisation under the chairmanship of flour millionaire and devout Methodist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31585/', "(Joseph) Arthur Rank")</script>. Over the next few years Davis's power within the combine grew steadily. Rank, a well-meaning but rather na&iuml;ve man with scant knowledge of film-making, looked increasingly to his right-hand man to take the tough decisions, a role for which Davis's temperament ideally fitted him. He too had little knowledge of the movie industry, nor much taste for it; but he understood money, and he understood figures.<br>
<br>With his austere financial training, Davis regarded the risky, unpredictable business of film-making with implacable mistrust. Film-makers, in his eyes, were mostly temperamental prima donnas, and financially irresponsible, while actors were spoilt children who needed to be kept in line. One of his first goals at Rank was to oust Filippo del Giudice, the flamboyant moving spirit behind Two Cities Films, makers of such classics as <span class="italic">In Which We Serve</span>, <span class="italic">The Way Ahead</span>, <span class="italic">Henry V</span>, and <span class="italic">Odd Man Out</span>. Ebullient, extravagant, convivial, a great nurturer of talent, del Giudice represented everything Davis detested in the film world and was determined to expunge from the Rank operation. In 1949, soon after del Giudice's dismissal, the Rank Organization hit a financial crisis, with losses of &pound;16 million. Davis applied to the National Provincial Bank, who lent the money but in return insisted on a new regime of financial stringency. J. Arthur Rank, increasingly preoccupied with the family flour business after the death of his elder brother, withdrew from the day-to-day running of the organization, leaving Davis in effective control.<br>
<br>For the next quarter of a century, Davis was by far the most powerful man in the British film industry. His attitude to film-making was starkly simple: it was&#151;or should be&#151;exactly like any other manufacturing process. &#145;The cinemas are the retail trade&#146;, he explained, &#145;the distributors are the wholesale, and the film-makers are the equivalent of the factory&#146;  (private information). Following this principle he cracked down on anything he regarded as waste, imposed a ceiling of &pound;150,000 on feature-film budgets, and instituted an internal accounting and supply system called Production Facilities Ltd, known to disaffected film-makers as &#145;Piffle&#146;. Even Davis's most severe critics&#151;whom he never lacked&#151;agreed that he pulled the Rank Organization back from the brink of disaster and re-established it on a sound financial footing. It was a feat that few other men could have achieved. But some would add that while he saved Rank, it was at the cost of its soul. In place of the charismatic del Giudice he installed a former exhibitor, the American Earl St John, as head of production. Amiable and bibulous, terrified of displeasing his boss, St John was contemptuously regarded as Davis's yes-man. Sensing how the wind was blowing, several of the company's most talented film-makers, including David Lean, Carol Reed, and the symbiotic team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, decamped to more aesthetically minded producers such as Alexander Korda. With the departure of these and other gifted artists, the quality of the Rank cinematic output during the 1950s declined steadily towards mediocrity. This rarely seemed to trouble Davis, who favoured the production-line style of film-making: films devised to formula, whose costs and yield could be readily predicted&#151;the <span class="italic">Doctor</span> series, the <span class="italic">Carry on</span> films, and the comedies of Norman Wisdom. Wisdom, indeed, was one of the few actors for whom Davis ever expressed admiration, describing him as &#145;a great artist&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>Occasionally, though, Davis showed signs of what the critic Alexander Walker called &#145;a hankering for quality&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 3 July 1993). At his instigation Rank ventured into more ambitious areas of film-making, with expensive international stars cast in storylines aimed to capture worldwide audiences. Unfortunately, they rarely did. Few of Rank's big-budget ventures even recouped their costs and many of them, such as <span class="italic">Ferry to Hong Kong</span> (1958) and <span class="italic">The Singer not the Song</span> (1960), flopped disastrously, to the malicious amusement of the rest of the industry. It may have been films like these that Davis had in mind when, asked years later just what he did on Rank's production side, he responded ruefully, &#145;Far too much&#146;  (ibid.). Such failures confirmed Davis in his belief that the best policy the Rank Organization could adopt towards film production was to extricate itself as smoothly as possible.<br>
<br>During the 1950s and 1960s Rank concentrated increasingly on the distribution and exhibition side of the industry while busily diversifying into other, supposedly more dependable, areas of activity. The company's famous logo, the man with the gong, came to adorn ten-pin bowling, ballroom dancing, gramophone records, service stations, hotels, catering services, bingo&#151;and, above all, photocopying. Inspiration for the company's most lucrative sideways move came from a Rank engineer, Tom Law, who brought glowing reports of a copying process developed in America by the Haloid Corporation, but Davis deserves credit for embracing the venture with such alacrity. Rank Xerox was launched in 1956; by 1969 it was contributing 90 per cent of the group's pre-tax profits.<br>
<br>Not all Rank's diversification projects proved so profitable, however. Some, such as the music label, failed badly, and when this happened the luckless executives in charge could expect little mercy from Davis. JD, as he was universally known in the organization, accepted no excuses for failure, and the casualty rate among Rank personnel was legendary. Fridays were particularly feared: executives returning from lunch would find on their desks a curt note, signed JD, telling them to collect a month's salary in lieu and be out within the hour, no reason given. So numerous were those summarily fired by Davis that they formed a club, the Rank Outsiders.<br>
<br>Davis ruled by fear, in a style which <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> of 27 September 1975 compared to that of Josef Stalin. Those entering his office at South Street, in London's Mayfair, would find him ensconced at a high, massive desk at the further end, and had to walk 40 feet under his baleful gaze&#151;a technique borrowed from Mussolini. When the director Lewis Gilbert was making <span class="italic">Reach for the Sky</span> (1956) a senior Rank executive came to tell him that Davis wanted a scene excised. Gilbert refused, and was amazed to see the man burst into tears, sobbing, &#145;But you <i>must</i>! You don't know what he'll do to me!&#146;  (private information). Not even leading film stars were safe from Davis's wrath. The star of <span class="italic">Reach for the Sky</span>, Kenneth More, was Britain's biggest box-office attraction during the 1950s. About to be loaned out to play a lead role in Carl Foreman's wartime action film <span class="italic">The Guns of Navarone</span> (1961), More got drunk at a Rank Christmas dinner and passed some unguarded remarks. Davis banned him from appearing in <span class="italic">Navarone</span>, and More's film career never recovered.<br>
<br>Although Davis was vindictive and arrogant, no one questioned his integrity. He never went back on his word, and a verbal agreement with him was as secure as a written contract. And while his harshness was notorious, his numerous acts of charity, especially to colleagues who had fallen on hard times, were less well known. Even film-makers sometimes experienced his generosity. When Richard Attenborough was struggling to find backing for <span class="italic">Gandhi</span> (1982), he was surprised to receive a small but useful sum from Davis as a personal gift&#151;though the Rank boss characteristically added that the project was an utter waste of time, as the world knew nothing of Gandhi and cared less.<br>
<br>During the week, Davis lived at the Dorchester Hotel, a hundred yards from South Street. Tireless and workaholic, he was invariably at his desk by 7.30 a.m., and rarely left before 8.00 p.m. at night. In a typical year he would travel 60,000 miles visiting far-flung outposts of the Rank empire. He expected similar dedication from his employees, along with scrupulous timekeeping. &#145;Punctuality&#146;, he once remarked, &#145;is being ten minutes early&#146;  (private information). In appearance he was thickset and bullet-headed, with slightly protuberant blue eyes whose cold stare intimidated many. The film-maker Roy Boulting, no admirer, described him as looking &#145;like a malevolent pork butcher&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>When J. Arthur Rank retired in 1962, Davis took over as chairman of the organization. He was knighted in 1971. Under his chairmanship the organization accelerated its withdrawal from film production, a policy that had a devastating effect on the British film industry as a whole. His achievement was inexorable and startlingly absolute. In 1949, the year when Davis gained effective control of Rank, the company produced 67 feature films, two-thirds of the British industry's output. In 1977, the last year of his chairmanship, the Rank Organization financed not a single film.<br>
<br>Age scarcely mellowed Davis. The rate of attrition among his underlings never abated, and he openly relished his formidable reputation. &#145;I eat managing directors for breakfast&#146;, he once remarked  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 29 May 1993). In 1975 he fired his second in command, Graham Dowson, when Dowson jilted his long-term mistress. The resultant row, along with some unimpressive profit figures, hit the headlines and loosened Davis's hold over the Rank trustees, who had hitherto supported him unquestioningly. (It was also said to have cost him his expected peerage, since Dowson was a friend of the then prime minister, Harold Wilson.) In 1977 Davis was persuaded to step down as chairman, but he appointed himself Rank's president for life&#151;too optimistically, as it proved; in 1983 he was ousted from his post and he retired in dudgeon to his 600 acre estate near Lingfield in Surrey, where he kept a dairy herd, made cheese, and liked to drive a tractor.<br>
<br>Davis sold his farm in 1986, when tractor driving became too risky for an eighty-year-old, and moved to Selwood Terrace in Brompton, west London. In his later years he took up religion, becoming a &#145;born-again&#146; Christian, and regularly attended Holy Trinity, Brompton. His work for the Westminster Abbey Appeal Fund earned him a CVO in 1985. He died of bronchopneumonia in a private nursing home, Beaumont House, Beaumont Street, Westminster, London, on 27 May 1993, his wife Felicity surviving him.<br>
