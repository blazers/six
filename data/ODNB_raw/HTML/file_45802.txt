<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hart,  Edith  Tudor</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Edith Suschitzky]</span>  (1908&#150;1973), <span class="occ">photographer</span>, was born in Vienna on 28 August 1908. Her father was the radical bookseller and publisher Wilhelm Suschitzky (1877&#150;1934), a campaigner for a variety of progressive causes. Her mother, Adele Bauer (1878&#150;1980), worked in the home. The two of them, together with her brother, Wolf, provided Edith with a lively and educated background, rather than with a particularly affluent one.<br>
<br>Suschitzky imbibed that atmosphere, and was remembered by those who knew her in her youth as immensely vivacious, amusing, curious, and gifted. On visiting Sweden in 1919&#150;20, a trip hosted by the Swedish government for central European children afflicted by the First World War, she found she enjoyed both travel and languages. She also had a natural affection for children and undertook her first training in progressive nursery teaching in Vienna in 1925. Two years later she took a course in London with the pioneer educator Maria Montessori.<br>
<br>By the end of the 1920s, however, and led by her increasingly left-wing politics, Suschitzky decided that the nascent field of photojournalism was the relevant means for her to document social ills. After a course of study at the Bauhaus from October 1929 to April 1930, Edith was ready to use her camera less for creating artful compositions&#151;such as her early geometric perspective through the Prater ferris wheel, which was to feature so significantly in the film of Graham Greene's novel <span class="italic">The Third Man</span>&#151;and more for showing people, often children, in pitiful slum housing or living on the streets. Austria was still reeling from the effects of the loss not only of a war but of an empire. Suschitzky's series on street beggars, mostly the war wounded, Gypsies, and blind or deaf people, remains utterly harrowing: all are attempting to earn a living with an instrument or a few stray articles for sale; all are dressed in rags, some lacking even shoes or protection against the cold. Other images illustrate the lives of those without domestic water and power, without a bathroom or furniture. Whole families exist on bomb sites or rubbish tips. By contrast, there are heroic pictures of May day parades (shot from above) and demonstrations by the unemployed with the already sinister figures of the special police forces set against barbed-wire barricades in the background.<br>
<br>Suschitzky travelled to Paris and London at the end of the 1920s, and in 1932 to Italy, where she took a series of photographs of Gypsies at Montefalcone. In 1925 she met an idealistic young British doctor called Alexander Tudor Hart (<i>d</i>. 1992), who had gone to Vienna to study orthopaedics under the famous surgeon Professor Boehler. They married at the British consulate in Vienna in 1933, and determined to return to London. Edith's family were Jewish and her brother, Wolf, left for Amsterdam in 1934. Already a member of such organizations as the Artists' International Association (AIA) and the Workers' Film and Photo League, Tudor Hart became involved in curating and contributing to such exhibitions as the AIA's &#145;The social scene&#146; (1934) and &#145;Artists against fascism and against war&#146; (1935).<br>
<br>Following their wedding and the move, the Tudor Harts did not remain long in London. Sharing Edith's left-wing politics and motivated by humanitarian concerns, Alexander Tudor Hart determined to use his skills among the miners and steelworkers of the Rhondda valley in Wales. Tudor Hart documented a great many of her husband's patients and their children, living conditions, home and working lives. By 1936 their own child, Tommy, was born and Alexander Tudor Hart enlisted as a surgeon on the government (republican) side in the Spanish Civil War. By the time he returned at its end Edith had to accept that their marriage was effectively over. They were finally divorced in 1945.<br>
<br>Thus from the mid-1930s until her death in 1973, Tudor Hart had to provide not only for herself but also for a son who, it gradually emerged, suffered from autism. A dual dedication to Tommy, for whom she attempted every kind of restitution to health, from psychoanalysis to a residential home, and to her own uncompromising style of photography inevitably put her under severe strain. The outlets for her work, never large nor lucrative, were dwindling, particularly with the post-war demise of <span class="italic">Lilliput</span>, the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span>, and especially <span class="italic">Picture Post</span>. Even the non-paying but morally supportive left-wing press took a while to recover its circulation&#151;paradoxically afflicted by the combination of a Labour Party victory and higher standards of living. She wrote several features on women, health, and work, including <span class="italic">Working Class Wives</span>, published as an imprint in 1939, and in 1952 produced a book for the Ministry of Education entitled <span class="italic">Moving and Growing</span>.<br>
<br>Tudor Hart's situation was made more difficult by the British security services' belief that she was a Communist Party spy. Tudor Hart believed they pursued her to the point where, by the 1960s, she felt bound to destroy not only a very great number of prints but also her negatives. She attempted a variety of semi-commercial ventures, from the Sun Studio in the West End (where she worked as a photographic assistant) to a small antiques shop in Brighton, without finding one that thrived. After a long illness she died at Copper Cliff, Redhill Drive, Brighton, of stomach cancer on 12 May 1973, leaving virtually no estate but her remaining negatives to her brother. She was cremated in Brighton on 15 May.<br>
<br>The best testament to Edith Tudor Hart's work is her &#145;Photography as a profession&#146;, written for the magazine <span class="italic">Housewife</span>:<blockquote>In the hands of the person who uses it with feeling and imagination, the camera becomes very much more than the means of earning a living, it becomes a vital factor in recording and influencing the life of the people and in promoting human understanding. (Hart, 4&#150;5)</blockquote>
