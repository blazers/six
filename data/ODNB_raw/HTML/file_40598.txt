<span class="headword">Loch&eacute;e,  Lewis</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1791), <span class="occ">military educationist</span>, was born in Brussels, the son of John Loch&eacute;e and his wife, Theresa. It is unknown when or why he moved to England, though he was living in Camberwell, Surrey, in 1767. He was possibly a political exile from Austrian rule and certainly a protestant. In 1770 he set up a military academy in a large rented house in Little Chelsea, London. By 1776 he had extended the house and in 1781 he bought the freehold. The academy, with its grounds laid out as a fortification, became an object for sightseers. By 1777 Loch&eacute;e described it as the &#145;Royal Military Academy&#146;, Little Chelsea, doubtless because George III had granted him an annual pension to encourage his work. On 8 May 1780 he was naturalized a British subject.<br>
<br>No military education was needed to become a British infantry or cavalry officer and none was officially provided, although a few private academies offered some teaching. Despite initial difficulties in attracting pupils, Loch&eacute;e succeeded during the 1770s and 1780s in building up a notable clientele who could afford his fees. The military authorities recognized the value of his academy in providing a military education and training both for boys too young to be commissioned and for youngsters whose commissions had already been purchased. Loch&eacute;e was exceptional in providing a carefully conceived combination of theoretical and practical instruction, and set out his ideas in <span class="italic">An Essay on Military Education</span> (1773). He was ahead of his time in involving the pupils in running the academy and in attention to practical work such as manoeuvres and digging fortifications. For the pupils the months in his care must have been an earnest experience, since Loch&eacute;e objected to holidays&#151;claiming that the curriculum offered sufficient diversion&#151;was critical of sports, and expelled even the well-connected for bad conduct. Although his alumni, of whom the most distinguished was probably Lieutenant-General Sir Thomas Picton, were few compared with the number of officers entering the army, they had learned something of military value.<br>
<br>Loch&eacute;e, who had a keen intellect, published clear and practical books on mathematics (1776), castrametation (1778), and fortification (1780 and 1783). He achieved educational, social, and financial success. He married on 26 August 1767 Elizabeth Dubourg (1749?&#150;1801) and had a son, John (1776&#150;1815). The academy probably closed in 1788 or 1789, since Mrs Loch&eacute;e was the ratepayer on the property from 1789. On 17 December 1789 Loch&eacute;e changed abruptly from military educationist to soldier, undertaking, as Lieutenant-Colonel Loch&eacute;e, to raise at his own expense the &#145;Belgic Legion&#146; to take part in the Belgian revolt against Austrian rule. But his patriotic idealism ended in failure, and on 29 May 1790 he was forced to resign from the defeated Belgian army. He moved to Lille in France, where Belgian refugees gathered and exchanged recriminations, in which he joined as the author of several pamphlets. He died at Lille, the circumstances unknown, on 8 June 1791.<br>
