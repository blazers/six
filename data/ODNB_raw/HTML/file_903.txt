<span class="headword">Austen, Sir  Francis William</span>  (1774&#150;1865), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, fifth son of the Revd George Austen (1731&#150;1805), rector of Steventon in Hampshire, and his wife, Cassandra (1739&#150;1827), daughter of the Revd Thomas Leigh, was born at Steventon on 23 April 1774. He was the brother of Admiral Charles Austen and of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/904/', "Jane Austen")</script>. In April 1786 he entered the Royal Naval Academy at Portsmouth, where his exemplary work earned him an early promotion. In December 1788 he joined the frigate <i>Perseverance</i>, and served aboard her in the East Indies. On 28 December 1792 he was promoted lieutenant, and after six years of active service was promoted to commander on 3 January 1799. On 13 May he was promoted captain following a brilliant single ship action in March, when he captured a French brig of war attempting to break the British blockade of Napoleon's army in Egypt. Between 1800 and 1802 he served as flag-captain to Admiral Gambier, aboard the <i>Leopard</i>, engaging the French invasion flotilla then being built up around Boulogne. He subsequently transferred to serve under Admiral Louis in the <i>Canopus</i>. Here he took part in Nelson's long blockade of Toulon and the pursuit of Villeneuve across the Atlantic. To Austen's intense mortification, Louis's squadron was detached to re-provision shortly before the battle of Trafalgar, and so missed it. Subsequently the <i>Canopus</i> took part in Admiral Duckworth's Atlantic operations, culminating in the decisive battle off San Domingo on 6 February 1806, in which she played a crucial role.<br>
<br>Austen returned home shortly afterwards and in July that year married Mary, eldest daughter of John Gibson, at Ramsgate; they had eight children who survived infancy. Between 1807 and 1809 he made at least two voyages to the East Indies commanding the <i>St Albans</i> (64 guns), in charge of convoys. His success in settling a dispute with the Chinese in 1809 earned him the approbation of the Admiralty and a present of &pound;1000 from the East India Company. In December 1810 he became temporary flag captain to his long-term patron Lord Gambier, then commanding the Channel Fleet. Between 1811 and 1814 he commanded the <i>Elephant</i> (74 guns) in the North Sea and the Baltic. In 1823 his first wife died, and on 2 July 1828 he married Martha (<i>d</i>. January 1843), eldest daughter of the Revd Noyes Lloyd. Having held a colonelcy of marines from 1825, as a senior captain, Austen reached the rank of rear-admiral on 22 July 1830. He was appointed KCB in February 1837 and became a vice-admiral on 28 June 1838. His only peacetime sea service was as commander-in-chief in the West Indies between December 1844 and June 1848. He became full admiral on 1 August 1848.<br>
<br>In 1854 Austen refused the post of commander-in-chief at Portsmouth on the grounds of advanced age. He was gazetted GCB in May 1860, rear-admiral of the United Kingdom on 5 June 1862, vice-admiral of the United Kingdom on 11 December 1862, and admiral of the fleet on 27 April 1863. He died at his home, Portsdown Lodge, Portsmouth, on 10 August 1865. Austen's career was distinguished, although he never had an opportunity to display abilities beyond those of a good captain. The fame of his sister and her use of naval characters in her novels has aroused interest in his life.<br>
