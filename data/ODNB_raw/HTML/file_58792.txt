<span class="headword">Gibb,  Andrew Dewar</span>  (1888&#150;1974), <span class="occ">jurist and Scottish nationalist</span>, was born at the High Street, Paisley, Renfrewshire, on 13 February 1888, the son of William Fletcher Gibb (1855/6&#150;1923), medical doctor, and his wife, Mary Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Walker (1860/61&#150;1948). He was educated at Trinity College, Glenalmond (1902&#150;6), and the University of Glasgow, where he graduated in arts in 1910 and law in 1913. He was called to the Scottish bar in 1914. During the First World War he served with the Royal Scots Fusiliers, seeing active service in France and reaching the rank of major. Under the pseudonym Captain X he published in 1924 <span class="italic">With Winston Churchill at the Front</span>. This work recounted the period in early 1916 during which his company of the 6th Royal Scots Fusiliers was commanded by Churchill. His view of Churchill was &#145;fulsome&#146;. According to Gibb &#145;no more popular officer ever commanded troops&#146;  (p. 109).<br>
<br>Gibb was called to the English bar in 1917 and practised there from 1919. He married on 22 May 1923 Margaret Isabel, daughter of Dr Walker Downie; they had one son and two daughters. In 1929 he was appointed lecturer in English law at the University of Edinburgh, and from 1931 to 1934 he was lecturer in Scots law at the University of Cambridge.<br>
<br>In 1934 Gibb was appointed regius professor of law at the University of Glasgow, a chair he held until his retirement in 1958. As a legal scholar he edited a range of works, including successive editions of a text on the law of maritime collisions, and on the position of Scots law in the United Kingdom. His <span class="italic">Students' Glossary of Legal Terms</span> appeared in 1946 and four editions of his <span class="italic">Preface to Scots Law</span> were published between 1944 and 1964. He was particularly interested in the role of the House of Lords as a court of appeal in Scottish cases, the subject of his <span class="italic">Law from Over the Border</span> (1950). His successor in the Glasgow chair has damned his legal writing with faint praise, remarking that &#145;almost all of it was small&#146;  (Walker, 58). He has, however, been described as a &#145;legal nationalist&#146;  (Farmer, 151&#150;64), and there is much evidence for this. He regarded Scots law as a priceless survival of the union of 1707, which he regarded as a corrupt bargain, and he deprecated the intrusion of English procedures. Unless Scotland recovered her independent status he predicted only &#145;a lingering decline, leading to ultimate fusion with the Law of England and the reduction of Scotland to a like condition with that of Wales&#146;  (A. D. Gibb, <span class="italic">The Shadow on Parliament House: has Scots Law a Future?</span>, Porpoise Pamphlet 4, <i>c</i>.1932, 28). Nevertheless, the survival of Scots law, in his view, provided a suitable basis for the restoration of Scottish nationhood.<br>
<br>Gibb was politically active throughout his life. His early political career was as a Unionist, and he twice stood as a candidate for the Scottish Unionist party: at Hamilton in 1924 and at Greenock in 1929. These were unpromising contests and on each occasion he was bottom of the poll despite his 1924 candidature being characterized by &#145;unbounded energy and enthusiasm&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>, 18 Oct 1924, 10). During the 1920s he came to the view that Scotland had been ill served by the union of 1707. His <span class="italic">Scotland in Eclipse</span> (1930) identified the economic depression with a wider cultural malaise in Scotland. In particular, he believed that Scotland's status as a partner in the imperial mission had been compromised by her lowly status in the United Kingdom. As he moved towards a nationalist position he retained a right-wing world view and imperial questions remained prominent in his writings. His <span class="italic">Scottish Empire</span> (1937) emphasized the key role that Scotland and the Scots had played in the development of the British empire in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, but contended that this vital imperial role was being undermined by the steady encroachment upon Scotland's identity within the Union. While he sought the recovery of Scottish statehood, he did so within the structure of the United Kingdom. He opposed outright independence as likely to lead to separation and isolation and felt that even something akin to dominion status would not fully recognize the importance of Scotland to the development of the empire. These views attracted the suspicion among his fellow nationalists that he was a mere &#145;devolutionist&#146;.<br>
<br>Gibb's involvement in Scottish nationalism in the 1930s came initially through the vehicle of the Scottish Party. Formed in 1930, the party was composed mostly of former Unionists, and was designed as a counterpoint to the more left-wing National Party of Scotland. Gibb feared that the &#145;socialism&#146;, pan-Celticism, and cultural nationalism of the National Party was a disastrous combination. As negotiations proceeded to fuse the Scottish Party and the National Party he encouraged the leadership of the latter to cleanse their ranks of undesirable and extreme elements. Fusion was achieved with the creation of the Scottish National Party in 1934, of which he served as chairman from 1936 to 1940. He was the unsuccessful nationalist parliamentary candidate for the Scottish Universities seat at the general election of 1935 and at by-elections in 1936 and 1938.<br>
<br>Gibb's view of politics has been described as &eacute;litist. Discussing the leadership of the Scottish Party in 1930 he emphasized to the duke of Montrose that &#145;the rank and file require to be guided, instructed and shepherded towards the proper course&#146;  (Finlay, <span class="italic">Independent and Free</span>, 95). He also embraced a racist conception of Scottish nationalism, considering that inter-war Scotland was in &#145;eclipse&#146; as a result of the combination of large-scale emigration and the &#145;influx&#146; (for which there was no statistical evidence) of what he perceived to be an inferior people from Ireland. This was an identifiable current of thought in right-wing circles in Scotland in this period, also being expressed by leading figures in the Presbyterian churches. The Irish were also condemned for lending their electoral support to the Labour Party, which made its breakthrough in Scotland in 1922. This hostility to left-wing politics led Gibb into even more dangerous territory in the late 1930s. He expressed &#145;admiration&#146; for Hitler and Mussolini, even praising Hitler's Jewish policy and condemning communism as &#145;too largely Jewish in origin&#146;  (ibid., 197&#150;8). It was what he regarded as the rapid leftward lurch of the National Party that led to Gibb's resignation from its chair in 1940. Despite these views he was not of the wing of the Scottish National Party that opposed the war and he did not approve of the party's policy of exploiting the electoral truce and contesting by-elections.<br>
<br>Described by his successor in the Glasgow chair as &#145;shortish, bald with a determined, slightly prominent lower jaw and lip&#146;  (Walker, 58), Gibb maintained the style of dress of a Scottish advocate throughout his academic career. During and after the Second World War he was a less prominent figure politically, and the extreme views he had expressed in the 1930s were rarely heard (the tone of his <span class="italic">Scotland Resurgent</span>, 1950, differed from that of his earlier writings). It has been suggested that he had become a disappointed and unfulfilled figure. He served as an honorary and interim sheriff at Ayr, Paisley, and Glasgow, where he brought a tough approach to the application of the criminal law. He died at his home, 15 Kirklee Road, Glasgow, on 24 January 1974.<br>
