<span class="headword">Fawcett, Sir  James Edmund Sandford</span>  (1913&#150;1991), <span class="occ">lawyer and jurist</span>, was born on 16 April 1913 at the parsonage, North Hagbourne, Wallingford, Berkshire, the son of the Revd Joseph Fawcett, Church of England clergyman, and his wife, Edith Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Scattergood. He was educated at the Dragon School, Oxford, Rugby School, and New College, Oxford. After taking first classes in both classical moderations (1933) and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1935), he turned to the law and was awarded the Eldon law scholarship. On 7 August 1937 he married Frances Beatrice Lowe (<i>b</i>. 1913/14), daughter of Dr Elias Avery Lowe, reader in palaeography at the University of Oxford. They had met when they were both pupils at the Dragon School. They had a son and four daughters. Fawcett later converted to his wife's Roman Catholicism.<br>
<br>Fawcett was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1938 and also won a prize fellowship at All Souls College. He joined the north-eastern circuit and practised until the outbreak of the Second World War, when he volunteered for the Royal Navy. After a year as a rating he was commissioned and went on to serve as the torpedo officer of a destroyer. He was awarded the DSC in 1942 for his part in sinking an Italian destroyer.<br>
<br>In 1945 Fawcett became an assistant legal adviser at the Foreign Office, and from 1948 to 1950 he served with the United Kingdom delegation to the United Nations in New York and also for a time with the British embassy in Washington. He was involved in the preparation of the 1948 universal declaration of human rights. In 1950 he left the Foreign Office to pursue his practice at the bar as a member of the chambers at 2 Hare Court of John Galway Foster MP, himself an international lawyer and a fellow of All Souls. He was counsel in four cases before the International Court of Justice at The Hague, in three of them appearing for the United Kingdom. He did not apply for silk until 1985. In 1955 he was appointed general counsel to the International Monetary Fund in Washington, and he held that appointment for 5 years. This work stimulated the writing of informed and original articles on legal aspects of international trading and finance. In 1961 he was again elected to a fellowship at All Souls, which he retained until 1969.<br>
<br>In 1962 Fawcett was appointed a member of the European Commission of Human Rights, a position he held until 1984, an unrivalled period of twenty-two years. This work, though demanding, especially when from 1972 to 1982 he was its much respected president, was a part-time occupation. Consequently Fawcett was able also to do much else. From 1969 to 1973 he was director of studies at the Royal Institute of International Affairs. From 1976 until 1980 he held the chair of international law at King's College, London, a position which suited him well as he was a gifted teacher and had already written a refreshing introductory manual for students of international law, <span class="italic">The Law of Nations</span> (1968). He was knighted in 1984.<br>
<br>Fawcett's work in Strasbourg with the Commission of Human Rights&#151;or &#145;common rights&#146;, as he liked to call them&#151;was an outstanding contribution to the development and administration of human rights in Europe. In those days (the commission ceased to exist in 1998) all petitions alleging breaches of the European Human Rights Convention went first to the commission, and relatively very few found their way to the Court of Human Rights. The work of the commission was diplomatic as much as legal, and this suited Fawcett's inclinations. He was ambivalent about the strictly judicial settlement of some kinds of disputes, and in one of his writings he expressed the view that &#145;the judicial settlement of disputes, though better than friction and conflict, still falls short of their settlement by countries in consultation on how best they may work together&#146;  (Fawcett, &#145;The place of law in an international organization&#146;, <span class="italic">British Yearbook of International Law</span> 36 1960, 328).<br>
<br>Fawcett wrote, and wrote well, throughout his career, and his writings reflected the broad sweep of his interests and learning. Probably his most influential book was <span class="italic">The Application of the European Convention on Human Rights</span> (1969), a practical and scholarly commentary on the convention, article by article. But there were seven other books and some threescore articles. He was a pioneer writer on international trade law. He wrote perceptively on the legal problems of international organizations, and also about the uses of outer space, a legal subject that reflected his hobby of astronomy. He was concerned about the legal problems of energy and was one of the earliest voices to question the wisdom of the lavish use of fossil fuels. He was no mere international lawyer, for he had a profound understanding of the common law too, though his learning was lightly and only aptly displayed. The great strengths of his writings were analysis, clarity, and elegance. He rather liked to begin with a paradox that needed explaining. There were no routine writings. He wrote when he had something to say.<br>
<br>Fawcett was handsome and charming. He was an excellent pianist. His family was his pride and joy. As a lawyer and scholar he had independence of mind and spirit. In 1973 he became one of the few international lawyers chosen for membership of the Institut de Droit International, but he failed to appear at the biennial conferences. On receiving a letter pleading that he might try to attend the next one his reply was a courteous request to be permitted to resign because, he said, &#145;I fear I am not a conference man&#146;  (private information). He died at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, on 24 June 1991, following a stroke. He was survived by his wife and five children. A memorial service was held at St Etheldreda's, Ely Place, London, on 30 September 1991.<br>
