<span class="headword">Walker,  Richard Stuart</span>  (1918&#150;1985), <span class="occ">angler and engineer</span>, was born on 29 May 1918 at 16 Fishpond Road, Hitchin, Hertfordshire, the only child of Richard Harry Walker (1892&#150;1956), government clerk, and his wife, Elsie May (1892&#150;1990), daughter of Frederick A. Cooper of Stanbridge, Bedfordshire. Both his maternal grandfather, Frederick, and his paternal grandfather, Richard, were important influences upon him and enthused their grandson with their respective passions for the natural world and angling. It was from this background that Britain's most perceptive, informed, and celebrated angler of the twentieth century emerged to become possibly &#145;the single most important writer in angling history &hellip; not even Walton was in the same class&#146;  (C. Dyson in Paisley, 33).<br>
<br>Raised largely by his mother and grandparents, Richard Walker first went to school in Hitchin before attending the notable Quaker Friends' school, at Saffron Walden, Essex. From the age of sixteen he attended the Quaker St Christopher School, Letchworth, Hertfordshire. His scholastic activities included a spell as centre-forward in the first eleven, occasional success as a lower order batsman, and keen support of the camera club.<br>
<br>In 1936 Walker went to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he read engineering. Regrettably the Second World War put an end to his formal academic career and although he took to studying genetics in his spare time he never graduated. During the conflict he served as a military technician based at St Athans, Glamorgan, and then Farnborough, Hampshire. In that capacity not only did he contribute to the ground breaking work on aircraft radar and other installation works, he acquired a bullet scar on his shin, a lifelong dislike of the sea, and two nominal ranks. On the advent of peace Walker joined his family's lawnmower manufactory, Lloyd's of Letchworth, initially as chief designer and ultimately for some thirty years as technical director and general manager. On 21 March 1940 Walker married Ruth Maud (1914&#150;1971), daughter of Henry Burdett-Holcroft, watchmaker and jeweller, and they had three sons.<br>
<br>It was, however, as an innovative and inspirational angler that Walker was to illuminate post-war Britain. He was only four years old when he caught his first fish; a superb 4 lb trout from the River Lea at Hertford. He placed his first order for twelve trout wet flies from the Hardy catalogue in 1926; it is characteristic of the man that his evident youthful enthusiasm merited a personal reply from the great Laurence R. Hardy himself. This began a fruitful association that lasted for the rest of his life, resulting, among other things, in the production of the world's first carbon fibre rod some forty years later. It is also typical that although this first note of his angling interest refers to the pursuit of game fish, his passion was never restricted to one particular branch of fresh water fishing. Indeed it was in the realm of coarse fishing that the name of Walker exploded upon the angling world.<br>
<br>In 1950, despite the evidence of Walker's own catches and the writings of Denys Watkins-Pitchford (B.B.), it was still generally considered that catching all but the smallest of carp was next to impossible. Having applied his mind to dispel many of the stale angling conventions of the day by first-hand experience and thorough experimentation with new tackle innovations such as electronic bite alarms and the personally designed and wonderfully effective Mark IV carp rods, Richard Walker and a small group of other famous anglers (Watkins-Pitchford, Pete Thomas, and Maurice Ingham) shared their knowledge and enthusiasm in an informal association called the Carp Catchers' Club. On a very dark September night in 1952 from a small lake in Herefordshire, after an epic struggle now familiar to generations of anglers, Richard Walker landed a huge female common carp of 44 lb, over 25 per cent more than the existing record. This momentous, headline-grabbing, record-breaking triumph and the planned manner of the conquest was soon followed in 1953 by Walker's first major book, <span class="italic">Still Water Angling</span>&#151;a seminal work that succinctly outlined five essentials for catching good fish, defined his approach to angling, and inspired readers with lucid accounts of his captures. Simultaneously, the new weekly magazine <span class="italic">Angling Times</span> signed up Richard Walker for a contribution to be known as &#145;Walker's pitch&#146;. From the rather conservative and sedate pre-war pastime when father's tackle and techniques would be passed on wholesale to the son, coarse angling became the most rapidly evolving area of angling with specimen groups, new tackle, new baits, and new methods adding to the knowledge and success of its many participants. Walker was the inspiration and catalyst for much of this change.<br>
<br>Always mindful of the advice proffered to him by R. L. Marston, editor of the <span class="italic">Fishing Gazette</span> on submission of his second angling article in 1936 (he also wrote under the name Water Rail), Walker always wrote from his own experience. His articles became a <i>tour de force</i> of angling journalism. Considered, provocative, clearly written, and entertaining, his wide reading, phenomenal memory, acute powers of observation, and sheer enthusiasm sustained a weekly journal that only Alistair Cooke's <span class="italic">Letter from America</span> has emulated for quality and surpassed for duration. His deserved reputation for original thinking, strong views, relish for an argument, and unconcealed contempt for ill-founded opinion were, mercifully, allied to a generosity and understanding that impressed all who knew him. In his later years, after notable work on other coarse species such as perch and pike, and again developing tackle and techniques and exploring new locations to enhance their capture, his attentions were increasingly drawn to the attractions of trout angling in the burgeoning still waters of England. Dick Walker was thus the most significant advocate of the shooting head, inventor of a truly effective floating and sinking agent, developer of some of the first new generation lures, and captor of an unclaimed &#145;record&#146; rainbow trout. He was also a strident supporter of the Anglers' Co-operative Association and fiercely critical of both government agencies and the small conservation lobby for their evident disregard for the current fate or future prospects for British fish species and watercourses.<br>
<br>An active and well-informed man, Walker's enthusiasms included photography, music, poetry, and latterly palaeoanthropology. He was featured on <span class="italic">Desert Island Discs</span> on BBC Radio 4 in July 1974, where he revealed his fondness for classic operas and his love and affinity for the rural England captured in Rudyard Kipling's <span class="italic">Puck of Pook's Hill</span>. The programme records the &#145;polite, dignified and gentlemanly&#146; Walker very well  (F. Taylor in Paisley, 40). What it fails to reveal is the wicked sense of humour that many close friends had cause to remember in their dealings with him. From his talent for imitating accents to his relish for practical jokes this side to his character was aptly summarized by Ken Sutton: &#145;Dick, despite his age and fame, had never left the sixth form&#146;  (F. Buller in Paisley, 43). Following the death of his first wife Walker married on 6 May 1971 Patricia (<i>b</i>. 1932), of <span class="italic">Fishing Gazette</span> fame, daughter of Robert Leslie Marston, publisher. They had another son.<br>
<br>Although in the early 1980s Walker was diagnosed with the cancer that was ultimately to claim his life, he continued to fish, write, and contribute to the angling world with undiminished zeal and inventiveness. He died on 2 August 1985 at his home, 37 Ivel Gardens, Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, and was cremated in Cambridge. He was the author of sixteen books and countless articles, and is widely regarded as the most celebrated British angler to have emerged in the twentieth century, its leading participant, and most accomplished advocate.<br>
