<span class="headword">Fletcher,  William</span>  (<em>b. </em>1773, <em>d.</em> in or after 1841), <span class="occ">valet</span>, was the son of John Fletcher (<i>c</i>.1750&#150;1808), a farmer, and his wife, Mary (<i>c</i>.1750&#150;1800). He was already a manservant at Burgage Manor, Southwell, Nottinghamshire, when Catherine Byron and her son arrived there in July 1803. On 23 July 1804 he married Sarah Bye (1783&#150;1812), Mrs Byron's maid. She was his second wife, Susannah Mellers, a serving woman, whom he had married on 25 March 1794, having died childless. Fletcher and Sarah had two sons: William (<i>b</i>. 1805), and George (<i>b</i>. 1806), to whom Byron stood godfather. Fletcher was promoted to valet in October 1808, when his predecessor, Francis Boyce, was transported for theft. Accompanying Byron and Hobhouse abroad in July 1809 Fletcher was the &#145;staunch yeoman&#146; of &#145;Childe Harold's Goodnight&#146;. Having undergone many adventures in Portugal, Malta, Greece, Albania, and Turkey, including near shipwreck off Paxos, Fletcher re-entered England early in 1811, carrying important legal bonds. After re-employment on Byron's return in July, he informed the poet at Newport Pagnell of his mother's death on 1 August. Sarah Fletcher died in 1812, and on 12 January 1816 at St James's, Piccadilly, Fletcher married as his third wife Anne Rood, maid to Lady Byron. In July 1814 a relationship with another maidservant, Martha Willis, had produced an illegitimate son, also called William.<br>
<br>William and Anne Fletcher both sided firmly with Lord Byron in his 1816 separation crisis. On 25 April that year Fletcher again accompanied Byron abroad, abandoning his family to share his master's exile. Fletcher, like Byron, adapted well to Italian life, acquiring the language and taking a Venetian mistress called Tiretta. In July 1823 he returned to Greece, where he wrote his well-known letter to Augusta Leigh, dated 20 April 1824, describing Byron's death the previous day. Fletcher then supervised the return of Byron's body to England, attending his funeral at Hucknall Torkard, Nottinghamshire, on 12 July. Unfortunately Fletcher was not remembered in what was taken for Byron's final will. Although a promised &pound;70 p.a. from Augusta Leigh was not forthcoming, he had sufficient savings to open a &#145;Macaroni Manufactory&#146; near Brunswick Square, in partnership with Lega Zambelli, Byron's Italian secretary. This enterprise failed when the government lifted the duty on imported pasta, ruining Fletcher. By 1835, the year Anne Fletcher died, he was reliant on the charity of John Murray, J. C. Hobhouse, and others, who organized a subscription for his support. Despite their assistance in 1837 he was admitted to White Cross Street workhouse, where he proved unable to fulfil the required schedules.<br>
<br>The last record of Fletcher alive dates from March 1841, when Lady Byron wrote to Ada Lovelace that he had &#145;at last got a place&#146;. Harold Nicolson appears to have been mistaken in imagining Fletcher living in the 1870s, probably confusing him with a son. Fletcher is often mentioned in Byron's letters and journals, sometimes ironically as &#145;the Learned Fletcher&#146;  (Lovelace MSS). Despite frequent quarrels, which led to Fletcher's being sacked and reinstated on three occasions, theirs was a remarkable master&#150;servant relationship. Genuine grief, discretion, and honour always prevented Fletcher from revealing the myriad secrets of &#145;My late lamented lord and master&#146;, to the exasperation of Byron's biographer Thomas Moore.<br>
