<span class="headword">Cook, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1410&#150;1478), <span class="occ">draper and mayor of London</span>, was the eldest son of Thomas Cook, draper, a warden of London Bridge (1440&#150;57), and grandson of Robert Cook of Lavenham, Suffolk; the family were probably weavers and clothiers and the move to become drapers of London was a natural one. The post of alnager (inspector of woollen goods) in Lavenham and elsewhere in Essex was held by the two Thomases between 1432 and 1457, and the younger became a considerable power in the cloth industries of Essex and Suffolk, building on his father's successes. In the 1440s they were members of the mercantile party opposing the aspirations of the artisan tailors, clients of the drapers. Thomas the younger was on the common council of London by the 1440s and he had also married Elizabeth, one of the two daughters of the wealthy draper <a name="cosubject_52271"></a><span class="headword">Philip Malpas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1469)<span class="occ"></span>. Philippa, the other daughter, married Ralph Josselyn, draper and mayor (1464&#150;5). Malpas was a younger son of a Cheshire family who had been apprenticed to a London draper and made a prudent marriage to Juliana, daughter of the wealthy chandler, John Beaumond, and widow of the grocer, William Middleton (an executor of Beaumond). Spectacularly successful, Malpas was notorious for his business methods: he was convicted of usury in 1421. He was sheriff in 1439, and MP in 1432 and 1441, but was alderman only for the years 1448&#150;50, and apparently disliked office. He and the Cooks were associated from the 1420s.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1450 London was threatened by the rebel forces of John Cade (<i>d</i>. 1450): at some time in June Cook received a safe conduct from Cade to negotiate with him on the city's behalf at Blackheath, but precisely what transpired is unknown. As a gesture of conciliation the city removed the unpopular Malpas from his aldermanry, and Malpas almost certainly saved his life by leaving the city before the rebels gained access on 3 July; his house, the Green Gate, was looted of a considerable fortune.<br>
<br>In the 1450s and 1460s Cook's business success continued, unaffected by the change of kings. He lent to the crown and secured the collectorship of customs at Southampton, possibly from Queen Margaret herself. He was himself a substantial importer of woad through Southampton. In 1453 he was sheriff; his ninth attempt secured an aldermanry (Vintry, 1456), moving quickly to Broad Street (1458). Both Cook and Malpas are likely to have been among the city's leading men who supported the Yorkist earls in July 1460, and, in Cook's case at least, the accession of Edward IV on 4 March 1461. Malpas, however, had panicked at the march of Queen Margaret's army on London after the second battle of St Albans on 17 February 1461, took ship, was captured by the French, and ransomed for 4000 marks, quarrelling with Cook in the process.<br>
<br>Cook's mayoralty from October 1462 to October 1463 saw him engaged in the major operation of placing a vault of brick and stone over the Walbrook River (onto which his Pope's Alley house backed) and raising gifts and loans for the king's campaigns in the north against the Lancastrians and the Scots. He was created a knight of the Bath at Queen Elizabeth's coronation (24&#150;25 May 1465).<br>
<br>By the 1460s Cook's landed estate was considerable. In London he moved to a great house next to the Austin Friars, taking as his tenant for his previous house the Medici representative, Gherardo Canigiani. He and Malpas had been systematically building up an estate in the area of Havering, Essex, since the 1450s; with his neighbours there, Avery Cornburgh and Thomas Urswick (<i>d</i>. 1479), Cook secured for Havering a royal charter and the status of a liberty in 1465; he was also licensed to fortify his house at Gidea Hall and to enclose 200 acres.<br>
<br>In 1468 an invasion scare, prompted by the capture of Lancastrian agents, led to Cook's arrest, with many others, on a charge of treason. The accusation against Cook originated with John Hawkins, a servant of John, Lord Wenlock (<i>d</i>. 1471), who had confessed under torture. In the search for evidence many of his goods were confiscated and his property damaged. The trial opened on 4 July at Guildhall: on the instruction of the chief justice, Sir John Markham (<i>d</i>. 1479), Cook was acquitted of giving treasonable aid but not of concealing the plots revealed to him, the offence of misprision. The penalty was a fine of 8000 marks (&pound;5333 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>.) set by the king, which shocked many, including the judges, even when compared with the value of some of the goods seized. Robert Fabyan (<i>d</i>. 1513), an apprentice of Cook whose father led the sureties for Cook's fine, recorded many details in his great chronicle of London years later; his overall judgement of Cook represents him as an arrogant man, and also endorses the trial's verdict as just. Cook successfully negotiated a release from the 800 marks surcharge of the &#145;queen's gold&#146;, a matter in which he was probably assisted by his son-in-law, John Forster, receiver-general of the queen. The stories of later chroniclers, which entirely exonerated Cook, blamed the proceedings against him on the enmity of Richard Woodville, Earl Rivers (<i>d</i>. 1469), the treasurer of England, and his wife, Jaquetta, duchess of Bedford, the looting of his property on their rapacity, and even the resignation of the trial judge on their revenge, cannot be substantiated. Despite his considerable losses at this time Cook remained a very rich man, and the death of Philip Malpas in 1469 after his other daughter, Philippa Josselyn, had died childless, further compensated Cook by bringing almost all Malpas's fortune to the Cooks. Malpas was buried in St Andrew Undershaft, London.<br>
<br>Edward IV's exile (1470&#150;71) allowed Cook to have a brief revenge, but his attempt to claim compensation against Lord Rivers's heir in parliament, and his high-handed behaviour against those he thought had acted against him, seem to have cost him many friends, including his brother-in-law Ralph Josselyn&#151;though their quarrels may have also been over property and loans. Cook regained his aldermanry and played such an important role in supporting the new Neville&#150;Lancastrian regime in London that, on Edward's return, he fled abroad. He was captured by the Hanse, ransomed by Margaret of York, duchess of Burgundy (<i>d</i>. 1503), and returned, a sick man, to house arrest with his friend, Avery Cornburgh, in Essex. Pardoned in 1472, he was again on commissions in 1475.<br>
<br>Cook was adroit at keeping his Essex estate unencumbered despite considerable losses during his two &#145;troubles&#146; which included his lands in other counties and his great house at the Austin Friars. The losses, debts, and lawsuits incurred as a result of his second &#145;trouble&#146; probably far exceeded those of 1468. He was still a very wealthy man, however, when he drew up his will on 15 April 1478, shortly before his death at his house near the Austin Friars; he asked to be buried in the church of the Austin Friars and he remembered some Essex connections and relatives; he established an almshouse for ninety years and, like Malpas, wanted very public prayers for his soul in the city, although he did not feel obliged to spend Malpas's &pound;1800 to help him through purgatory. Cook's will was designed to create a coherent estate in Essex for his eldest son, Philip (a young man whose lack of &#145;good rule&#146; had been criticized in Malpas's will, and who remained unsteady); consequently it ignored both his wife's wishes over her Malpas lands and the interests of his surviving sons, John and William (he hoped they would be priests), and of his daughter, Joan, wife of John Forster, one of his major supporters from 1468 to 1472. Their lawsuits, and Elizabeth Cook's will of 1484, secured a more equitable distribution of the land, but nevertheless the heirs of Malpas and Cook, through Philip, remained the dominant landowners in Havering for 200 years.<br>
<br>A different sort of survival from the Cook household is a memoranda book belonging to John Vale of Bury St Edmunds, Sir Thomas's man of affairs  (now BL, Add. MS 48031A), compiled partly at least from the varied contents of the Cook family archive, in 1478&#150;84, and containing many, now unique, copies of political broadsides of the fifteenth century and literary texts, as well as letters received by Cook as mayor. The apprenticeship of the future chronicler and alderman, Robert Fabyan, overlapped with the service of Vale, but Fabyan had no access to Vale's collection.<br>
