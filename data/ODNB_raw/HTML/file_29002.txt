<span class="headword">Wesley <span class="st"> [Wellesley]</span>,  Garrett</span>, first earl of Mornington  (1735&#150;1781), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born on 19 July 1735, probably at Dangan Castle, co. Meath, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29007/', "Richard Wesley (or Wellesley, formerly Colley), first baron of Mornington (1690&#150;1758)")</script>, and Elizabeth Sale (<i>d</i>. 1738). Educated at Trinity College, Dublin, he graduated BA in 1754 and MA in 1757. He sat in the Irish House of Commons for the family borough of Trim, co. Meath, beginning in 1757. On his father's death in 1758 he took his seat in the Irish House of Lords as the second baron. His surname is sometimes given as Wellesley, but though he used this name for the viscountcy he received in 1760, Wesley was his usual surname in his lifetime.<br>
<br>Wesley showed signs of musical talent at an early age. His mother's death when he was three left him in the doting hands of his father and sisters, who fostered his musical interests. By age nine he played the violin with some skill and began training on his father's harpsichord and organ, which had long been a part of the family home, Dangan Castle. According to his godmother, Mrs Delany, he grew up nicely: &#145;My godson, Master Wesley, is a most extraordinary boy; he was thirteen last month, he is a very good scholar, and whatever study he undertakes he masters it most surprisingly&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography &hellip; Mrs Delany</span>, 2.501). In his years at Trinity College and afterwards, Wesley immersed himself in Dublin society and music. He composed glees and church music with great success, and in 1758 he assembled a music academy for philanthropic purposes. The academy attracted well-heeled amateurs who met regularly under Garrett's direction to indulge their love of music and to hold concerts, the proceeds of which went to loans for poor tradesmen. In 1764 Trinity College conferred upon him the degree of doctor of music.<br>
<br>On 6 February 1759 Mornington married Anne Hill (1742&#150;1831), the eldest daughter of a Dublin banker, Arthur Hill, later Lord Dungannon. Anne was a lively, intelligent young woman but, according to Mrs Delany, was wanting in judgement and manners: &#145;What I think L. M. [Lady Mornington] may be wanting in, is what few people have attained at her age, who have not had some real superiority of understanding and a little experience of the manners of the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography &hellip; Mrs Delany</span>, 3.534&#150;7). The following year on 2 October 1760 Wellesley was rewarded for his musical and philanthropic achievements with an elevation in the Irish peerage as first Viscount Wellesley of Dangan and first earl of Mornington.<br>
<br>Lord and Lady Mornington had nine children, seven of whom survived childhood and six of whom lived into adulthood. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29008/', "Richard Wellesley, the future Marquess Wellesley (1760&#150;1842)")</script>, came first, followed by the first Arthur (1762&#150;1768?) and William (1763&#150;1845), the future <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29010/', "William Wellesley-Pole, third earl of Mornington")</script>. The short-lived Francis came in 1765 and Anne in 1768. Anne (1768&#150;1844) married first the Hon. Henry Fitzroy, and second Charles Culling Smith. These were followed by the second <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29001/', "Arthur Wellesley, the future duke of Wellington (1769&#150;1852)")</script>, Gerald Valerian (1770&#150;1848), prebendary of Durham, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29004/', "Henry Wellesley, first Baron Cowley (1773&#150;1847)")</script>, and Elizabeth (1773&#150;1794). The Morningtons decided to educate their children in England, and the boys attended Eton College. Consequently, the family divided their time between Ireland and London. The practical consequences were significant as increased expenses combined with declining income from the family's estates to dissipate the family fortune. When Lord Mornington died suddenly, in Kensington, London, on 22 May 1781 he left his family in straitened circumstances. He was buried in Grosvenor Chapel, South Audley Street, London, after an elaborate funeral planned by his heir, Richard. Lady Mornington lived into her ninetieth year; constant financial difficulties in those years turned her into a severe and demanding woman largely ignored by her children. She died on 10 September 1831 and was buried with her husband in Grosvenor Chapel.<br>
