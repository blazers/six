<span class="headword">Ferrabosco,  Alfonso</span>  (<em>c.</em>1575&#150;1628), <span class="occ">composer and viol player</span>, was the eldest and illegitimate son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9352/', "Alfonso Ferrabosco (bap. 1543, d. 1588)")</script>; Anthony Wood said Ferrabosco was born at Greenwich  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Wood D.19(4)). His mother was probably Susanna Symons, who married the elder Alfonso on 2 May 1578. The couple left England within a month, leaving the son and a daughter in the care of Gommar van Oosterwijck, a flautist at court. In 1584 Queen Elizabeth refused the elder Alfonso's request to allow the children to join him in Italy, and soon after van Oosterwijck's death in 1592 granted the younger Alfonso an annuity of &pound;26 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. as &#145;musitian for the violles&#146;. This continued until 1601, although he claimed he had been &#145;hid&#146; from service at court. Rallying after illness, in 1602 he petitioned for &#145;a reasonable stipend by the yeare, &amp; something to pay my debtes, &hellip; if once her Ma[jes]tie please to use my most humble s[er]vice&#146;  (Hatfield House, Cecil papers, 98/94). In response a court place was granted him from June 1601 at an annual salary of &pound;50.<br>
<br>After the arrival of James I and his family, Ferrabosco gained an additional post from Christmas 1604 as extraordinary groom of the privy chamber, specifically &#145;in regard of his attendance upon the Prince [Henry] and instructing him [in] the art of musick&#146;  (TNA: PRO, C66/1640). This gave him privileged access to the private apartments. On twelfth night 1605 was performed <span class="italic">The Masque of Blackness</span>, the first of numerous court masques in which he collaborated with Ben Jonson. He also wrote the songs for Jonson's <span class="italic">Volpone</span>, performed at the Globe in 1606. Jonson paid warm tribute to him following the performance of <span class="italic">Hymenaei</span> (6 January 1606):<blockquote>And here, that no mans Deservings complain of injustice &hellip; I doe for honours sake, and the pledge of our Friendship, name Ma. <span class="smallcap">ALPHONSO FERRABOSCO</span>, a man, planted by himselfe, in that divine Spheare; &amp; mastring all the spirits of Musique: to whose judiciall care, and as absolute Performance, were committed all those Difficulties both of Song and otherwise. Wherein, what his Merit made to the Soule of our Invention, would aske to be esprest in Tunes, no lesse ravishing than his. (Jonson, <span class="italic">Hymenaei</span>, 1606)</blockquote>In 1609 Ferrabosco published a book of <span class="italic">Ayres</span>, containing songs and dialogues with lute and bass viol to texts by Jonson, Campion, and Donne. Some of these were extracted from previous masques, but it is a shame that much of his original masque music is lost. Nevertheless, enough remains to show his skill in the genre. In the songs a balance is struck between the newly emerging declamatory style and dance rhythms, allied to imaginative and extensive harmonic progressions. The extant sacred music is mostly on dolorous texts, some seemingly for Catholic use and some for Anglican, contrasting sharply with a secular group of <i>madrigalette</i> for four high voices. Later in 1609 was published his <span class="italic">Lessons for 1. 2. and 3. Viols</span>, printed in tablature for performance on lyra viol(s)&#151;allowing the instrument to be tuned in different ways. This technique seems to have been popular at court, especially within the establishment of Queen Anne of Denmark, and Ferrabosco's volume is the most important published collection of its kind. In the 1620s the violist Andr&eacute; Maugars praised &#145;Farabosco d'Angleterre&#146; as a player of &#145;la Lyre&#146; above any he had heard in Italy. Throughout his court career Ferrabosco oversaw payments for purchase of viols and lyra viols and for repairs to them. Whereas he was listed as &#145;the violle&#146; early in James I's reign, he was one of a group of four named violists by the end of it.<br>
<br>Ferrabosco was not named among the musicians of Henry when he was appointed prince of Wales in 1610, but continued as groom. Curiously there is no record of his involvement with the obsequies of Henry's death in 1612. At some time before 28 January in that year he had married Ellen (<i>d</i>. 1638), daughter of Nicholas Lanier (<i>c</i>.1523&#150;1612), a flautist colleague of van Oosterwijck's, probably at Greenwich. John Aubrey named Ferrabosco as lutenist to Philip Herbert (later lord chamberlain), with lodgings in Baynard's Castle, Herbert's London home. He also mentioned that he served Edward Seymour, earl of Hertford, visiting Amesbury and Wolfhall in Wiltshire.<br>
<br>There is a gap in the records of Ferrabosco's collaborations with Jonson between 1611 and 1622, but this does not appear to denote any personal animosity. In 1617 he was appointed at the head of seventeen musicians in the household of Charles, prince of Wales, gaining a third salary of &pound;40. Here he was involved with the cream of English musical talent, including Thomas Lupo, Orlando Gibbons, and later John Coprario. Ferrabosco himself was not a contributor to the new music emanating from the group (such as the works now termed &#145;fantasia-suites&#146; and mixing violins and viols with obbligato organ); rather he expanded the repertory of the viol consort, with more than fifty superb fantasias, pavans, and <span class="roman">In nomines</span> in four, five, and six parts. Evidently these were extremely popular, for some of the compositions each survive in more than twenty manuscript sources. Where many of Ferrabosco's contemporaries mirrored the structure and textures of vocal models&#151;madrigals in particular&#151;built from a succession of imitations each on a different theme, Ferrabosco tended to work in larger spans. Many of his fantasias fall into two distinct parts, but some concentrate on a single theme. Longer sections led to subtle variations in repetitions of themes, the opportunity for a wider exploration of &#145;key&#146; relationships, and the tendency to engage in technical feats where several principal themes were brought together at climaxes, or were presented in longer or shorter notes. In all this his music served as a model for later consort composers, especially John Jenkins and William Lawes. His &#145;hexachord&#146; fantasia and <span class="italic">In nomine through all Parts</span> are extraordinary advanced experiments in modulating round the key circle, another procedure also explored by Jenkins.<br>
<br>In 1618 Ferrabosco joined with his brother-in-law Innocent Lanier (a court flautist) and Hugh Lydiard (a sea captain) to petition for the privilege of removing sandbanks in the Thames. Rights were granted to them on 14 October 1619 to sell sand and gravel so removed, to receive a levy on imports and exports from the port of London, and to collect fines imposed on those causing annoyance on the river. There was much friction and disturbance between the partners, and Ferrabosco seems to have withdrawn from the venture in the early 1620s, once he and Lanier had sold their share to William Burrell, an official of the commission for the navy. Financial records at court suggest that he remained impoverished. In 1620 he was among a group of named musicians invited to provide music for a proposed amphitheatre in London (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 89).<br>
<br>On 13 January 1626 Ferrabosco assigned three years' wages to another brother-in-law, Andrea Lanier, to whom he owed &pound;200, perhaps taking this action because he was proposing to travel abroad and was uncertain of his return. There is no evidence that the journey took place, and in July 1626 Ferrabosco received a further &pound;40 fee as &#145;Composer of musicke in ordinary&#146; following the death of John Coprario. Ferrabosco was buried at St Alfege, Greenwich, on 11 March 1628.<br>
<br>Ferrabosco's court places were shared between his sons <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9354/', "Alfonso Ferrabosco (d. 1652)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74585/', "Henry Ferrabosco")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9355/', "Ferrabosco, John")</script>], both of whom served in the court wind band, while his infant son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9355/', "John Ferrabosco")</script> received a livery allowance. Two of his daughters also married musicians: Elizabeth married George Bunckley, and Catherine married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5870/', "Edward Coleman")</script>, a court musician after the Restoration. Catherine and Edward both sang in theatre productions and were friends of Samuel Pepys.<br>
