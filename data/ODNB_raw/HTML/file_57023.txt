<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Schechter,  Solomon</span>  (1847<span class="mult">x</span>50&#150;1915), <span class="occ">Hebraist</span>, was born in the small Romanian town of Focsani, the son of Isaac and Hayya (Chaia) Schechter, Jews of Russian origin. He was given the Hebrew name Shneur Zalman, after the founder of the Hasidic sect of Lubavitch or Habad, to which Isaac, the ritual slaughterer (German <i>Sch&auml;chter</i>), belonged and which stressed study and intellect as well as mystical communion with God.<h2>
<a name="IncontinentalEurope"></a>In continental Europe</h2>One of a family of five boys and one girl, young Shneur Zalman (or Solomon, as he styled himself when he moved westwards) was a physically powerful and intellectually brilliant red-head with blue eyes, who later claimed that he had inherited passion and energy from his mother while attributing his religious and scholarly tendencies to the influence of his father, who had been his first teacher. The other pervading influences were those of the eastern European <i>shtetl</i> (small-town Jewry), the Hasidic <i>shtiebel</i> (small and informal place of worship), and the <i>yeshivah</i> (academy for rabbinic studies). In addition, he obtained access, apparently through a local <i>maskil</i> (modernist intellectual), to books and articles that broadened his mind, at least within the sphere of Jewish scholarship, and led him to seek further education elsewhere. As a teenager he moved on to Lemberg (Lw&oacute;w), the capital of the Austro-Hungarian province of eastern Galicia, and studied with the outstanding Talmudist and interpreter of Jewish religious law Rabbi Joseph Saul Nathanson. The master was critical of Hasidism, opposed &#145;progressive&#146; Judaism but without encouraging communal separatism, and made lenient rulings when circumstances demanded them. Schechter, still religiously and educationally unsure of himself, returned to his native town for a while, continued his studies, and even contracted an unhappy marriage.<br>
<br>The combination of a commitment to Judaism, a passion for broader learning, and an undoubtedly radical streak led Schechter to the institutions of Jewish learning in central Europe that were committed to a more historical and scientific approach. Having earlier divorced his wife (whose name is unknown) after only a year of marriage, he abandoned the <i>shtetl</i> for ever (physically if never altogether spiritually) and entered the Vienna rabbinical seminary in 1875. The mission of its founder, Adolf (Aaron) Jellinek, was to spread scientific Jewish learning, a moderately liberal interpretation of Judaism, and a love of Jewish community and culture. As well as coming under Jellinek's influence, Schechter acquired a historical approach to the study of rabbinic literature from Isaac Hirsch Weiss, and the ability to subject <i>midrash</i> to text criticism and modern exegesis from Meir Friedmann (Ish-Shalom), both teachers more sympathetic to Jewish tradition and the continuity of the Hebrew language than Jellinek himself. It was indeed perhaps because of their similar background, restlessness, and religious outlook that Friedmann was so dear to Schechter in his Vienna years. While in that city, Schechter improved his general education with some university courses, made a living as a Hebrew teacher, and obtained rabbinical ordination.<br>
<br>By 1879 Schechter was ready to travel further along the road of Westernization, this time via the Hochschule f&uuml;r die Wissenschaft des Judentums, founded in Berlin in 1872. Though not officially aligned, the <i>Hochschule</i> was certainly associated more with progressive than with orthodox trends. Indeed, at this stage of his development Schechter was less enchanted with his background than he would later lead us to believe, and the only publications to have come from him by that time had been two vitriolic and pseudonymous satires on Hasidism, for which he later in life atoned with an essay that offered a more favourable assessment of that movement. Now available to him in Berlin, in addition to his own students, were personally orthodox teachers, such as the critical Talmudist Israel Lewy, at the <i>Hochschule</i>, and more clinical and sceptical scholars such as the renowned bibliographer Moritz Steinschneider. Lewy inspired Schechter with his text-critical and philological analysis of rabbinic literature and encouraged him to compare manuscript variants and alternative recensions. At the personal level, Schechter was closest to Pinkus Fritz Frankl. This centrist rabbi and scholar whom he had known in Vienna was now Abraham Geiger's successor in Berlin and a teacher at the <i>Hochschule</i>, and Schechter found lodgings in his home. Perhaps under Frankl's influence, he deepened his love of scientific Jewish studies, retained an attachment to traditional observance if not to orthodoxy, and nurtured a growing animosity to the kind of German intellectual antisemitism that he encountered when attending university lectures. He had still to find his ideal milieu, and his students in Berlin, Claude Montefiore from England and Richard Gottheil from the USA, both of them religiously liberal, beckoned to him to exchange the Germany that he was finding politically and socially uncomfortable for a potentially more attractive Anglo-Saxon environment.<h2>
<a name="InEngland"></a>In England</h2>Schechter arrived in England in 1882 as Montefiore's private tutor, destined to spend twenty years there, but always subsidized by the generosity of his English pupil. Though he did not find in the Anglo-Jewish community the appreciation of Jewish culture that he was anxiously seeking, Schechter taught and inspired a group of leading Jewish intellectuals in London called the Wanderers, read widely in English, and began to master that language. Though unthreatened by the relaxed and inclusive orthodoxy championed by Chief Rabbi Nathan Marcus Adler and his son and successor Hermann Adler, Schechter never took to the centralized bureaucracy of the chief rabbinate and the United Synagogue, nor to the Anglo-Jewish cleric, whom he regarded as a mere flunkey or religious functionary with little scholarly achievement. But he did enjoy England's liberal environment, and the Anglo-Jewish establishment accepted him as one of its own despite his biting criticisms. The close company in which he best expressed himself, the Wanderers, was dominated by the writer Israel Zangwill, the critic Joseph Jacobs, and Schechter himself. Other participants were the journalist Asher Myers, the scholar Israel Abrahams, and the historian Lucien Wolf. He developed a close relationship with Herbert and Susie Bentwich, whose daughter, Margery, later recalled his learning, intensity, and warmth:<blockquote>Schechter was the ideal of an inspired scholar. The fastidious cavilled at his wildness. He would tramp the room like a caged lion, and roar at his own sallies. His wide mouth would almost eat you; on the other hand, his blue eyes had such a childlike expression, his hand and voice such a warmth, that every child loved him, and their acme of happiness was to run errands for him. (M. Bentwich, <span class="italic">Lilian Ruth Friedlander: a Biography</span>, 1957, 10)</blockquote>While in England, Schechter established his scholarly credentials by the critical study of Hebrew manuscripts in the rich collections of that country, as well as in other parts of Europe; by his trail-blazing publication of first scientific editions of such works as <span class="italic">Avot de Rabbi Nathan</span> and of more general articles in the newly founded <span class="italic">Jewish Quarterly Review</span>; by teaching at Jews' College; and by contributing learned items to the <span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span>. Given his character and opinions, he inevitably became involved in controversies with other scholars, and the press reverberated with the accusations that he and Solomon Marcus Schiller-Szinnesy, who taught Talmudic and rabbinic literature at Cambridge, unashamedly hurled at each other. His marriage in June 1887 to Mathilde Roth of Breslau (born in Guttentag, Silesia, in 1857; died in New York in 1924) brought him the kind of personal and domestic security, affection, and support that certainly smoothed some of the rougher edges of his personality and toned down at least the religious side of his radicalism. It also brought him a daughter, Ruth, and a son, Frank, both born in London, and a second daughter, Amy, born later in Cambridge. Mathilde was a cultured, literate woman who undoubtedly assisted her husband with his English, encouraged his ambitions, and built a hospitable home in which they could entertain colleagues, visitors, and students. But Schechter had still not found his professional ideal and his next venture, lasting from 1890 to 1902, was to be in the rarefied academic atmosphere of Cambridge.<h2>
<a name="AtCambridge"></a>At Cambridge</h2>If an intensely scholastic environment in which to continue his textual studies was all that he was seeking, Schechter might well have remained in Cambridge for the rest of his life, since it was there that he made his most important contributions to Jewish learning. He prepared for the <span class="italic">Jewish Quarterly Review</span> descriptions of those manuscripts that his predecessor, Schiller-Szinessy, had not included in his catalogue of the Hebraica at Cambridge University Library. Editions of <span class="italic">Aggadat shir ha-shirim</span> (1896) and <span class="italic">Midrash ha-Gadol</span> (1902) were published in Cambridge, and he also undertook the kind of Jewish theological summaries that Montefiore desperately wanted and that were ultimately included in his collections of essays. He also admired and sought to emulate the text-critical work done by Oxford and Cambridge classicists and to promote its adoption in the field of rabbinic scholarship. With the Anglo-Jewish cleric Simeon Singer he had in 1896 published some twelfth-century <span class="roman">Talmud</span> fragments that he recognized as important for both their content and the new source of such early material to which they had pointed. His greatest and most original coup was his expedition to Cairo in 1896&#150;7 in search of the origin of precisely such medieval Hebrew fragments and his return to Cambridge with what turned out to be 140,000 items of inestimable significance for rewriting the Jewish social, literary, and religious history of the medieval Mediterranean.<br>
<br>Schechter himself has little to say about what precisely inspired him to travel to Cairo in the winter of 1896&#150;7 in search of manuscripts, and to arrange for the costs to be privately met by Charles Taylor, master of St John's College, Cambridge. The undertaking was clearly important enough for him to cancel his projected participation in Herbert Bentwich's Zionist pilgrimage to the land of Israel with the Maccabeans. Undoubtedly, the kind of medieval Hebrew, Aramaic, and Arabic fragments that S. A. Wertheimer and G. Chester had sent to Oxford and Cambridge, and that had appeared in other centres of learning in the previous few years, and the fact that some of them had been written in Cairo had made him consider the possibility of further discoveries. It is equally likely that the success of the Anglo-Jewish lawyer Elkan Nathan Adler in bringing home a sack of palaeographical treasures from the Egyptian capital a year before, during his second visit there, had not gone unnoticed. Surely, however, Schechter's excitement about a Ben Sira (<span class="roman">Ecclesiasticus</span>) fragment brought to him by his Scottish Presbyterian friends Agnes Lewis and Margaret Gibson, and his determination to find more such early medieval manuscripts of the Hebrew text preserved by the Jews, were major factors in his decision to travel east. He had resolved to steal a march on Oxford in this connection and to refute D. S. Margoliouth's theory that the authentic voice of Ben Sira was to be found in the Greek and Syriac texts and not among the Jews.<br>
<br>As a result of Schechter's imagination and enthusiasm, as well as of his erudition, the recovery of the &#145;hoard of Hebrew manuscripts&#146; from the genizah (repository) of the Ben-Ezra Synagogue in medieval Cairo became a reality. His energy and single-mindedness ensured that the major areas represented in that collection began to be carefully investigated before he left Cambridge in 1902. Not only did a number of original studies result from his genizah discoveries; the example he set inspired the composition of hundreds of books and thousands of articles in the century following his Cairo expedition. He ushered in a new age of learning about Jews and Judaism as they existed in the medieval Orient, his discoveries making an impact no less than the Dead Sea scrolls fifty years later. What has become famous as the Cairo genizah shed light not only on what Jewish scholars wrote in the biblical and rabbinic fields but also on the daily lives and relations of Jews, Christians, and Muslims in the early centuries of the second millennium. He was promoted from lecturer to reader in 1892 and made a DLitt in 1898.<br>
<br>But to imagine that Schechter ever felt fully at home in the Cambridge courts, cloisters, and combination rooms is to underestimate the gap that still existed between such an exotic personality and his conventional surroundings. It is true that the <span class="roman">Bible</span> scholar William Robertson Smith had supported his appointment as university lecturer and his acceptance as a member of Christ's College. In addition, many leading members of the university, such as Charles Taylor, master of St John's College, and Francis Jenkinson, Robertson Smith's successor as university librarian, enjoyed his wit, valued his remarkable mind, and admired his prodigious learning. Nevertheless, his main friendships were with those outside the established academic society, such as Margaret Gibson and Agnes Lewis, and the literary raconteur and librarian Erik Magnusson. His warmest friendship was undoubtedly the one he enjoyed with the pioneering anthropologist James Frazer, a fellow of Trinity for most of his professional life who never obtained a tenured teaching appointment at Cambridge. On their many afternoon walks, Frazer and Schechter apparently exchanged complaints about the Cambridge establishment and its conventionality, but it would not be accurate to lay the entire blame on the university for the further failure of Schechter to settle down fully. Having gradually abandoned intensely religious institutions for enthusiastically academic ones, he had somewhere lost the close Jewish connection and needed to return to a milieu in which he could combine the best of both traditions, train a future generation of intellectual rabbis, and bring religious advantage to his three children. They were having to be brought up in a tiny Jewish community where synagogue services were held only during term time, where sabbath could be a lonely affair except when visitors came from London, where observing the Jewish dietary laws was not easy, and where apostate Jews were more common than observant ones.<h2>
<a name="InAmerica"></a>In America</h2>So it was that Schechter's final move was to America, to the Jewish community that had for a number of years signalled to him that it required his ideas, industry, and fire. There he re-established the Jewish Theological Seminary as a scholarly and educational institution with a commitment to traditional Judaism, provided an intellectual powerhouse that propelled the conservative movement and its United Synagogue of America for about three-quarters of a century, and disseminated popular presentations of Jewish learning that were, by the time of his death in 1915, having a broad impact. He located a galaxy of scholarly stars for his new faculty and passed on to them some of his genizah finds for research and publication. After much thought about their interpretation, he published some remarkable religious tracts from the genizah in his <span class="italic">Documents of Jewish Sectaries</span> (1910), including the first text of what was later identified among the Dead Sea scrolls as the Damascus document. He also published collections of lively, thoughtful, and sound essays on Jewish topics and supported the expanding Zionist movement and the growing use of Hebrew, while remaining uncomfortable about their secular aspects. It was not, however, easy for such a maverick personality to become a figure of authority and to weigh himself down with administrative burdens. He resented the failure of the Jewish Theological Seminary's supporters to create an adequate financial endowment and regretted that scientific Jewish scholarship was under-valued. His relations with colleagues, inside and outside that institution, were sometimes strained, and he eventually had to acknowledge the need to create not an umbrella Judaism to cover left and right&#151;one that truly represented the achievements and ideals of what he admiringly called &#145;Catholic Israel&#146;&#151;but another denomination that was neither Orthodox nor Reform but conservative. It was not uncommon for Schechter in his American years to express frustration and a sense of failure; as Mel Scult has recently put it, &#145;the Seminary succeeded, but unfortunately Schechter did not know it&#146;  (Scult, &#145;Schechter's seminary&#146;, 89).<h2>
<a name="Hispersonality"></a>His personality</h2>For Schechter, learning meant application, depth, and accuracy, and he could not easily tolerate superficiality, ignorance, or philistinism. His family links were close and demanded love and loyalty, and he was generous and considerate to those in need. He made adjustments to his inherited religious commitment, perhaps in the light of his personal brilliance and independence of mind, without betraying its most central values. He had a respect for piety, an admiration for integrity, and a suspicion of the bureaucratic and clerical aspects of organized religion. He found it difficult to be anything but the magnetic personality he was, and it was perhaps for this reason that children warmed to him so easily. It has even been suggested that the many friendships he made with women, particularly unattached women, may be attributed to their intuitive feminine capacity for distinguishing the genuine from the pretentious.<br>
<br>But Schechter was never the Cambridge gentleman. He made a noisy impact on company, was sloppy and unkempt in appearance, and was cruelly dismissive of the professional rabbinate. He quickly made and unmade friendships, and fellow scholars often attracted his outspoken derision. He regarded certain scholarly topics as his own and sometimes resented, or even prevented, encroachment on them by academic competitors, preferring to share them with a chosen few almost as an act of patronage. Absent-minded and volatile, radical and unpredictable (characteristics that undoubtedly left their impact on his children), Schechter was nevertheless desperately ambitious, and anxiously searched during most of his life for a milieu in which he could win total acceptance and on which he could exercise an authoritative influence. The paradox is that when he located it, he felt disappointed that it did not measure up to his standards of learning on the one hand and of radicalism on the other.<br>
<br>Schechter died on 20 November 1915 in New York, where he was buried.<br>
