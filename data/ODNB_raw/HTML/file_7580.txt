<div class="para">
<span class="headword">DeWint,  Peter</span>  (1784&#150;1849), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was born in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, on 21 January 1784, the son of Henry DeWint (1753&#150;1807), physician, and his wife, Elizabeth Watson (<i>b</i>. 1754). The DeWint family was of Dutch origin; Henry DeWint, after studying in Europe and America, set up practice as a doctor in the Potteries district in 1781. Peter DeWint himself was originally destined for a medical career but, having shown an interest in art, persuaded his father to allow him to study painting. Accordingly in 1802 he was sent to London to be apprenticed to John Raphael Smith, the mezzotint engraver and painter, who agreed &#145;to teach &hellip; in the best manner that he can, the said Apprentice in the art of Engraving and Portrait Painting&#146;  (indentures, Usher Art Gallery). However, it is clear that DeWint's artistic interests lay in directions other than engraving and portrait painting, for when he was released from his indentures three years early, in 1806, it was on condition that he produced for Smith eighteen paintings &#145;all of which said several pictures are to be Landscapes&#146;  (ibid.). This commitment to landscape painting was a bold move in the light of Joseph Farington's advice that &#145;Portrait painting undoubtedly offers more certain employ than any other branch [of art] &hellip; Landscape painting is not so much encouraged&#146;  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 4.1129). Nevertheless, it was as a landscape painter that DeWint was to establish himself as one of the most successful artists of the Romantic period.<br>
<br>After leaving J. R. Smith in 1806, DeWint moved to Broad Street, Golden Square, London, where he was a neighbour of John Varley, probably the most influential teacher of his time, and well known for his generosity to fellow artists. Varley would have introduced DeWint to the principles of Thomas Girtin's art, encouraged him to work <i>en plein air</i>, and taken him to Dr Monro's informal &#145;academy&#146;, where he would have been able to study the paintings of Cozens, Gainsborough, Turner, and Girtin.<br>
<br>That his landscape work progressed quickly is confirmed by the fact that in 1807 DeWint exhibited three landscapes at the Royal Academy, and went on to exhibit there a further ten times prior to 1828. In 1809 he was admitted as a student in the Royal Academy Schools. However, he concentrated increasingly on painting in watercolour, then considered an inferior medium, and between 1808 and 1809 he exhibited thirteen works at the Associated Artists in Water-Colours, including in 1808 his <span class="italic">View of Westminster Palace</span> (V&amp;A). In 1810 he became an associate of the recently formed <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96320', "Society of Painters in Water Colours")</script>, and in 1811 a full member. It was at this society, subsequently known as the Old Watercolour Society, that DeWint exhibited over 400 watercolours during the next forty years.<br>
<br>Although his income until 1809 &#145;was very small&#146;  (H. DeWint), DeWint was able the following year to invest sums of &pound;150 and &pound;85 in annuities  (documents in the Usher Art Gallery). On 16 June 1810 he married Harriet Hilton (<i>c</i>.1790&#150;1866), the sister of his close friend William Hilton, and in the same year all three of them set up home together at 10 Percy Street, London. The Hiltons originated in Lincoln, and henceforth DeWint was to have a close association with that city. In 1827, when Hilton was appointed keeper of the Royal Academy, the DeWints moved to 40 Upper Gower Street, London, where they remained until DeWint's death in 1849. During the last years of his life DeWint suffered from bronchitis, and died at his home from resulting complications on 30 June 1849; he was buried on 7 July in the grounds of the Chapel Royal in the Savoy, Strand, London. In the following year the studio sale of DeWint's work was held at Christies and during the five-day sale from 22 to 28 May 493 lots were sold, raising a total of &pound;2364 7<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. Further sales of DeWint's work, mainly from the family collection, took place at Christies on 2 March 1876, 28 June 1904, and 12 September 1941  (Smith, 152&#150;9).<br>
<br>DeWint's artistic reputation was well established by the end of the first decade of the nineteenth century. Despite his Dutch ancestry, DeWint was among the most English of English artists, and no one, with the possible exception of Constable, celebrated with more affection, and less affectation, the simple charm of the English countryside&#151;&#145;they are common scenes made very uncommon&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Examiner</span>, 1827, 325). Although he visited Normandy briefly in 1828, and Wales a few times between 1829 and 1835, his favourite scenes were to be found in the north and east of England, especially the environs of Lincoln.<br>
<br>Early in his career DeWint produced some large and impressive oil paintings such as <span class="italic">The Cornfield</span> (exh. RA, 1815; V&amp;A). However, it is as a watercolour artist that he is best-known. His watercolours can be divided into large, highly wrought exhibition pieces such as <span class="italic">Lincoln Cathedral</span> (exh. Old Watercolour Society, 1841; V&amp;A) and his more spontaneous, and generally more admired, sketches such as <span class="italic">Dock Leaves</span> (<i>c</i>.1812; Usher Art Gallery, Lincoln), of which John Clare wrote: &#145;nothing would appear so valuable to me as one of those rough sketches taken in the fields that breathe the living freshness of open air and sunshine&#146;  (J. W. Tibble and A. Tibble, <span class="italic">Life of John Clare</span>, 136). Technically DeWint developed, more than his contemporaries, the full potential of the more painterly approach to watercolour painting that emerged in the early years of the nineteenth century, and which distinguished the Romantics from the earlier topographers with their preference for tinted drawings. Ruskin quoted DeWint as saying &#145;never mind your drawing but take plenty of colour on your brush &amp; lay it on thick&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of John Ruskin</span>, ed. E. T. Cook and A. Wedderburn, 1903&#150;42, 1.426). Working with a fairly limited and subdued palette, DeWint laid in broad, wet washes of colour, which he disturbed as little as possible. In addition, DeWint excelled in the field of still-life painting, and also produced a significant body of work for topographical publications, including George Ormerod's <span class="italic">History of Cheshire</span> (3 vols., 1819) and Charles Heath's <span class="italic">Views of London</span> (1825).<br>
<br>It is evident from the sales ledgers that his wife kept that DeWint enjoyed extensive patronage from all strata of society including the Heathcotes of Conington Castle, Huntingdonshire, Richard Ellison of Sudbrooke Holme, Lincolnshire, J. M. W. Turner's friend Walter Fawkes, and the Howards of Castle Rising, Norfolk. He also had a large number of pupils, mostly amateurs, many of whom, such as the Heathcotes, were also patrons. His most notable professional pupil was Samuel Austin.<br>
<br>There are excellent collections of DeWint's work to be found in the Usher Art Gallery, Lincoln; the Victoria and Albert Museum, London (which received a gift from Mrs Tatlock, the artist's daughter, in 1872, and a further bequest in 1921); the Tate collection (which now holds the Henderson bequest of 1879, of twenty-three watercolours, including <span class="italic">Bridge over a Branch of the Witham</span>), and the British Museum.<br>
