<span class="headword">Scott,  David</span>  (1746&#150;1805), <span class="occ">merchant and director of the East India Company</span>, was born in &#145;the early weeks&#146; of 1746 at the family residence, Dunninald House in Craig, Forfarshire, and was baptized on 27 February 1746 (Philips, 1.x n. 1; Anderson, 3.411). He was the tenth of thirteen children of Robert Scott (1705&#150;1780), the progressive laird of Dunninald, and his wife, Ann, daughter of General John Middleton of Seton. David attended both school and university at St Andrews where he matriculated in 1759. At the age of seventeen, like many well-educated but impecunious Scots, he sought his fortune in India. Lacking a nomination in the East India Company service, he engaged in private trade as a ship's officer, entered into partnerships with Parsi businessmen and servants of the company, and founded the agency house of Scott, Tate, and Adamson at Bombay. Some of his capital came from his happy marriage to a rich widow, Louisa Jervis, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Delagard (<i>d</i>. 1803), with whom he had three daughters and a son.<br>
<br>It was the enterprise of private merchants like Scott, often in partnership with East India Company servants, which had slowly built up the trading connections of the British in western India. But the expansion of Bombay's trade was repeatedly threatened by the military power of Mysore and the Marathas, and by the oppressive government of local rulers. Scott and his associates concluded that Bombay had to control the ports and territory which were vital to its trade, and he helped to finance Bombay's military attempts to do this in the 1770s, which ended in defeat. In 1784 the Bombay government owed him nearly &pound;200,000.<br>
<br>In 1786 Scott moved to London, where he directed the English business of his agency house and kept up close connections with his partners and friends in Bombay. Convinced that radical new policies were needed if Britain (and his fellow merchants) were to benefit fully from the company's new position in India, his aim was to expand its territorial power as a shield for the expansion of private British trade. He quickly won the confidence of Pitt, and the friendship of Henry Dundas, the head of the India Board of Control. Dundas helped Scott to become a director of the company in 1788, and to be elected MP for Forfarshire from 1790 until he was defeated in 1796. He was then elected for the Forfar burghs, a seat which he held until his death.<br>
<br>In the court of directors Scott was opposed by the shipping interest, which controlled the company's ships and was hostile to private traders who threatened their monopoly. In 1793 the shipping interest attacked Scott by banning directors from trading with India. Scott responded by vesting his son David, aged eleven, with control of his agency house. As deputy chairman he succeeded in 1795 in reforming the shipping system. In 1798 he proved how India-built ships could reduce the company's shipping costs, but his open support of private British traders alienated his fellow directors and this measure was defeated. The following year his enemies accused him of trading illicitly with the French.<br>
<br>Their hostility was sharpened by Scott's and Dundas's encouragement of the aggressive policy pursued by Wellesley in India, which had increased the company's territory while increasing its debt and threatening its financial survival. Scott had worked closely with Wellesley between 1795 and 1797, when the latter was a member of Dundas's India board, and he used this connection to support the independent expansionist policy of the Bombay government in which his own trading partners were influential. He persuaded Wellesley not to disband the presidency and to retain the pliant Jonathan Duncan as governor. But, with the fall of Pitt's government in 1801, Scott lost the crucial political support which Dundas had given him. Although he defended Wellesley loyally, he was unable to prevent the directors from recalling him in 1804. Fighting ill health and pain since 1796, Scott died exhausted in London on 4 October 1805, two years after his beloved wife, and was buried in St Marylebone burial-ground. He had spent much of his money as well as his health in fighting the monopolies which he saw as the enemies of the private enterprise which had built up British power in India.<br>
