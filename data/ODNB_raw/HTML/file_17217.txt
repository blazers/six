<span class="headword">Lutterell,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1335), <span class="occ">theologian</span>, is of unknown origins. He was ordained a priest before 1304, having received a papal dispensation for illegitimacy, and he was later granted dispensations of non-residency to permit him to enjoy the income from his benefices while in residence in Oxford. By 1317 he held the degree of DTh. In July of that year, probably in response to a university supplication, he was made a canon at Lichfield with expectation of a prebend, and in December 1319 he was made canon of Salisbury with the prebend of Axford. On 10 October 1317 he was elected chancellor of the university, and soon afterwards travelled to the Roman curia at Avignon in order to pursue the university's case against the Dominicans at Oxford. The friars were contesting an award made by arbitrators in 1313, on a dispute between the Dominicans and the university, over the latter's control of admission to the degree of bachelor of theology. Lutterell returned to England in 1318, where he was one of the two representatives of the university to argue their side of the case before Cardinal Gaucelin, which was decided largely in favour of the university.<br>
<br>Lutterell had become involved in a dispute with other masters and scholars at Oxford by the summer of 1322. Despite many statements to the contrary, there is no evidence that this matter concerned either his philosophical or theological views, or his opposition to William Ockham's teaching, and its causes remain obscure. The opposing masters appealed to the bishop of Lincoln, who removed Lutterell from office before the beginning of August. They also appealed to the king, who on 12 August blocked Lutterell's attempt to take the matter abroad to Avignon, either in person or in writing. Lutterell and a delegation from the university presumably appeared before the king at York in October, as ordered, although mandates for royal letters of introduction to the pope on Lutterell's behalf had been issued on 30 August 1322.<br>
<br>Lutterell left for Avignon soon after 20 August 1323 to present his case to the pope. He was summoned to return to England by Edward II in May 1325, but by that time he was serving on a papal commission to examine the orthodoxy of the <span class="italic">Questions on the &#145;Sentences&#146;</span> of Ockham, who had been called to the papal curia in the summer of 1324. John XXII intervened to permit Lutterell to remain at Avignon. Lutterell extracted fifty-six propositions from Ockham's work and wrote a treatise quoting and attacking these &#145;errors&#146;. The commission on which Lutterell served dismissed twenty-three items, either because the majority on the commission did not believe they were false, or because they concerned philosophical as opposed to theological issues. In the end, two lists of fifty-one erroneous propositions were drawn up in 1326, but no official condemnation emerged. After a year or two back in England, Lutterell returned to Avignon early in 1329 with letters of commendation from John Grandison, bishop of Exeter. By October 1329 he had returned to England, and in May of the following year Grandison recommended Lutterell to the dean and chapter at Salisbury as a candidate for that vacant see. Nevertheless he was unsuccessful. In April 1334 Lutterell was made a canon at York, with the prebends of Bickhill and Knaresborough. He returned to Avignon in 1330, 1332, and 1333, and served alongside Walter Chatton on the commission to investigate the views of Durand de St Pour&ccedil;ain and Thomas Waleys regarding the beatific vision in the summer of 1333. He died in Avignon on 17 July 1335.<br>
<br>In theological terms Lutterell was a realist, and in his <span class="italic">Libellus contra Ockham</span> relied frequently on the positions of Thomas Aquinas. He also wrote a letter, <span class="italic">Epistula de visione beata</span>, in support of John XXII's views on the beatific vision. Apart from references to his <span class="italic">In vesperiis magistrorum</span>, nothing has remained from his teaching at Oxford.<br>
