<span class="headword">Douglas,  James</span>, first earl of Morton  (<em>d.</em> 1493), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the only child of James Douglas (<i>d</i>. before 11 Oct 1457), lord of Dalkeith, and Elizabeth, daughter of James Gifford of Sheriffhall. Formal ownership of the extensive Dalkeith regality was transferred to him in July 1456, and the full inheritance came by 11 October 1457, when he was still legally a minor, following his father's death. Shortly afterwards, on 14 March 1458, James II created him earl of Morton. This reflected partly his estates and partly his opposition to the last two earls of Douglas, which had been provoked by their support for his uncle Henry Douglas of Borg in the take-over of the Dalkeith lands from his simple-minded father during the 1440s. Royal favour may further have resulted from the earl's agreement to marry Joanna (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1428, <i>d</i>. after 16 Oct 1486), the king's deaf and mute sister and the third daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14587/', "James I")</script>. They were married by 15 May 1459 and had a son, John.<br>
<br>There was a problem over the title of Morton, however. The barony of Morton, Nithsdale, had previously been alienated, as part of her jointure, to Janet Borthwick, second wife of the earl's grandfather, and she protested in parliament about the title on behalf of her son William Douglas. The chancellor replied that the earldom was called after Morton in Calderclere, in the sheriffdom of Edinburgh, not Morton in Nithsdale. But Earl James clearly wanted the barony back, and on 30 June 1466 he made an indenture with Patrick Graham (<i>d</i>. 1478), bishop of St Andrews and a close associate of the ruling Kennedy faction, that his heir should marry the bishop's niece, essentially in return for Graham's aid in recovering Morton and his other alienated lands. Morton's flirtation with the politically influential lasted just nine days, until 9 July, when the Kennedys were replaced by the Boyds in a <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> and as a result the marriage did not take place. The earl eventually forced William Douglas to resign Morton to him in 1474, and the same year saw him make his cousin Henry, the son of Henry Douglas of Borg, renounce any claim to the Dalkeith estates. Apart from the 1466 indenture and witnessing the parliamentary forfeiture of the Boyd family in November 1469, Morton remained remote from political affairs, and he may well have seen the recovery of these estates as his main achievement. In so doing he was acting very much in a family tradition.<br>
<br>Although his son was involved in the treasonable actions of the duke of Albany in 1482&#150;3, Morton stayed loyal to James III in the 1480s. In May 1488 he made one of his rare appearances at court, indicating continued support of the king in the developing crisis. It is not known if he followed his sovereign to the battle of Sauchieburn on 11 June. In the reign of James IV he attended parliament frequently, but otherwise still took no part in affairs of state. He died between 22 June and 22 October 1493 and was probably buried in Dalkeith church. He was succeeded by his son, John.<br>
