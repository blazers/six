<span class="headword">Prynne <span class="st"> [Prynn]</span>,  George Rundle</span>  (1818&#150;1903), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and writer</span>, was born at West Looe, Cornwall, on 23 August 1818, the younger son among the eight children of John Allen Prynn (whose form of the surname was abandoned later by his son) and his wife, Susanna, daughter of John and Mary Rundle of Looe, Cornwall. John Prynn, who claimed descent from William Prynne (1600&#150;1669), the puritan, was a native of Newlyn, Cornwall.<br>
<br>After education at a school run by his sister at Looe and at the private Devonport Classical and Mathematical School, Prynne matriculated at St John's College, Cambridge, in October 1836, but migrated to St Catharine's College. He graduated BA on 18 January 1840 (MA in 1861, and MA <i>ad eundem</i> at Oxford on 30 May 1861). Ordained deacon on 19 September 1841 and priest on 25 September 1842, he was licensed as curate first to the parish of Tywardreath, Cornwall, and on 18 December 1843 to St Andrew's, Clifton, Bristol. There he first came in contact with E. B. Pusey, who was the greatest influence on his adoption of Tractarian ideas and practices, especially the hearing of confessions, which he began at this time. However, Prynne declined Pusey's suggestion to join St Saviour's, Leeds, on account of an implied obligation of celibacy, as he was already contemplating marriage. On the nomination of the prime minister, Sir Robert Peel, Prynne became vicar of the parish of Par, Cornwall, newly formed from that of Tywardreath, from October 1846 to August 1847, when he took by exchange the living of St Levan and St Sennen in the same county. From 16 August 1848 until his death he was incumbent of the newly constituted parish of St Peter, formerly Eldad Chapel, which contained many of the poorest districts in Plymouth. On 17 April 1849 he married Emily (<i>d</i>. 1901), daughter of Admiral Sir Thomas Fellowes; they had four sons and six daughters.<br>
<br>At Plymouth, a town then predominantly nonconformist and evangelical in sympathy, Prynne's strenuous advocacy of Tractarianism involved him in heated controversy. The conflict was largely fostered by John Hatchard, vicar of Plymouth. In 1850 Prynne brought a charge of criminal libel against Isaac Latimer, the editor, publisher, and proprietor of the <span class="italic">Plymouth and Devonport Weekly Journal</span>, for an article, prompted by religious differences, that seemed to reflect on his moral character (24 January 1850). The trial took place at Exeter, before Sir John Taylor Coleridge, on 6 and 7 August 1850. The defendant alleged that the English Church Union was responsible for the prosecution and was supplying the necessary funds: the jury found Latimer not guilty and the heavy costs of the case almost ruined Prynne.<br>
<br>In 1852 Prynne was once again at the centre of controversy, this time as a result of his support of Priscilla Lydia Sellon (1821&#150;1878) and her Devonport community of Sisters of Mercy. Despite the heroic endeavours of Prynne, Sellon, and the sisters during a cholera epidemic in 1849, this support, together with Prynne's advocacy of auricular confession and penance, especially his hearing the confessions of young girls from the sisters' orphanage, provoked a pamphlet war with the Revd James Spurrell and the Revd Michael Hobart Seymour. On 22 September 1852 an inquiry by Henry Phillpotts, bishop of Exeter, into allegations against Prynne's doctrine and practice found in Prynne's favour, but a riot took place when Phillpotts held a confirmation at Prynne's church the next month. In 1860 Prynne &#145;conditionally&#146; baptized Joseph Leycester Lyne, known as Father Ignatius, and employed him as an unpaid curate. Prynne joined the Society of the Holy Cross in 1860 and the English Church Union in 1862, becoming vice-president of the latter body in 1901.<br>
<br>Meanwhile opposition diminished, and Prynne's local reputation improved as his pastoral work expanded. He built schools, established guilds, and conducted missions. His church was rebuilt and consecrated in 1882 without disturbance. (The architectural design was carried out by his second son, George, while his third son, Edward, executed the Prynne memorial mural after their father's death.) Although Prynne always remained a staunch Tractarian, he was chosen with prebendary M. F. Sadler proctor in convocation for the clergy of the Exeter diocese from 1885 to 1892, and he was on friendly terms with his diocesans, Frederick Temple and E. H. Bickersteth. Contrary to the views of many of his party, Prynne submitted to the first Lambeth opinion of 1899, which condemned the liturgical use of incense, until the death of Bishop Bickersteth in 1901.<br>
<br>Prynne acquired a considerable reputation as a compiler and author of hymns. His first published hymnal was produced as early as 1854, and contained 177 hymns; the 1866 edition grew to include 433, of which nearly 200 were eventually included in <span class="italic">Hymns Ancient and Modern</span>, a collection he subsequently helped to revise in 1875. His own collected hymns were published in <span class="italic">The Soldier's Dying Visions, and other Poems and Hymns</span> (1881), the best-known being &#145;Jesu, meek and gentle&#146;, written in 1856. In addition Prynne's writings about the eucharist were also significant, especially <span class="italic">The Eucharistic Manual</span>, designed for the non-academic reader: the ten editions through which it passed from 1865 to 1895 attest to its popularity in late Victorian high-church circles. Prynne also wrote <span class="italic">Truth and Reality of the Eucharistic Sacrifice</span> (1894) and <span class="italic">Devotional Instructions on the Eucharistic Office</span> (1903), as well as a number of sermons and controversial pamphlets.<br>
<br>After a short illness, Prynne died at his vicarage, 28 Wyndham Square, Plymouth, on 25 March 1903, and was buried at Plympton St Mary, near Plymouth, on 30 March.<br>
