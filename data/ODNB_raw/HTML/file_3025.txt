<span class="headword">Bowden,  John William</span>  (1798&#150;1844), <span class="occ">ecclesiastical writer</span>, was born in London on 21 February 1798, the eldest son of John Bowden, a director of the Bank of England, and his wife, Mary Anne. In 1812 he went to Harrow, and in 1817 entered Trinity College, Oxford, at the same time as J. H. Newman. From their first meeting, the day after Newman's arrival, they were inseparable companions throughout their undergraduate career. Together they wrote and published <span class="italic">St Bartholomew's Eve</span> (1818), a poem in two cantos with a romantic plot of young love thwarted by a scheming priest, and edited <span class="italic">The Undergraduate</span>, a short-lived periodical that ran to six weekly numbers in 1819. Bowden took mathematical honours in 1820, and proceeded MA in June 1823. In the autumn of 1826 he was appointed a commissioner of stamps and held the office for fourteen years. On 6 June 1828 he married Elizabeth, youngest daughter of Sir John Edward Swinburne, bt, of Capheaton. The poet Algernon Swinburne was her nephew.<br>
<br>From 1833 Bowden was a fervent adherent of the Tractarian movement. To H. J. Rose's <span class="italic">British Magazine</span> he contributed six of the 178 hymns later published under the title <span class="italic">Lyra apostolica</span> (1836). His contributions are signed &#945;. He was one of Newman's first collaborators on the <span class="roman">Tracts for the Times</span>, to which he himself contributed numbers 5, 29, 30, 56, and 58. Between 1836 and 1841 he published four major articles in the <span class="italic">British Critic</span>: &#145;Rise of the papal power&#146;, &#145;On Gothic architecture&#146;, &#145;On British association&#146;, and &#145;On the church in the Mediterranean&#146;.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1839 Bowden felt the first symptoms of the tuberculosis which five years later proved fatal. In the autumn of 1839 he went abroad with his family and spent the winter in Malta. In the spring of 1840 he published his <span class="italic">Life of Gregory the Seventh</span>, a work first suggested to him by Hurrell Froude. The last work published during his lifetime, <span class="italic">A Few Remarks on Pews</span> (1843), was an eloquent protest against a practice he denounced as unchristian and discriminatory.<br>
<br>During the summer of 1843 Bowden's health began to fail rapidly. Newman, then on the brink of his Rubicon, could not bring himself to disturb his friend's peace of mind by discussing his dilemma, but was his constant companion in his last days. Bowden died at his father's house in Grosvenor Place on 15 September 1844 and was buried at Fulham, his childhood home. Though he died in full communion with the Church of England, his widow followed Newman into the Roman Catholic church in July 1846, together with her children. Her two sons later became priests of the London Oratory, and the elder, John Edward, was the biographer of F. W. Faber. One of her two daughters became a nun. She herself lived to attend Newman's funeral. John Bowden's posthumous <span class="italic">Thoughts on the Work of the Six Days of Creation</span> (1845) was prefaced by a short biographical notice contributed by Newman, who also evoked their friendship in his <span class="italic">Apologia</span> (1864).<br>
