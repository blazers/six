<span class="headword">Wright,  Lucy Olivia</span>  (1845&#150;1896), <span class="occ">philanthropist</span>, was born on 3 November 1845 at Foulksrath Castle, co. Kilkenny, Ireland, the eighth of the nine children of Thomas Wright (<i>d</i>. 1854), agent to Lord Carrick, and his wife, formerly a Miss Ball (<i>d</i>. 1869), who came from an old Dublin and Drogheda family with Huguenot links. She had seven brothers and a sister; her younger brother, William, to whom she was close, became a clergyman. Mrs Wright was a religious and philanthropic woman who gave her children a Christian upbringing. Lucy Wright gained both her religious convictions and her musical taste from her mother, and her good looks, wit, and humour from her father.<br>
<br>After Thomas Wright's death, his widow and her family moved firstly to Palmerstown, near Kilkenny city, in 1856, then to Blackrock, near Dublin, in 1863, during which time Lucy Wright went to school at Rhyl in north Wales. Her elder and only sister had married a cousin, the Revd Arthur Wright, who was vicar of St Anne's, Birkenhead; in 1868 Lucy and her mother went to live with them. After Mrs Wright's death nearly a year later, Lucy Wright remained with her sister and brother-in-law and moved with them to Tilston, Cheshire, at Christmas 1869. It was here that she began Sunday school teaching and other parish work.<br>
<br>Lucy Wright first became interested in the Girls' Friendly Society while staying with a former school friend in north Wales in 1878, at which time a branch was being started in the St Asaph diocese. The society had been founded in 1875 by Mary Elizabeth Townsend &#145;To unite for the Glory of God in one Fellowship of Prayer and Service the Girls and Women of the Empire, to uphold Purity in Thought, Word and Deed&#146;. Membership consisted of middle- and upper-class associates, paying at least 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. a year, who were members of the Church of England, and working-class members of &#145;virtuous character&#146;, paying at least 6<i>d</i>. a year, with no religious restriction. In June 1879 Lucy Wright attended the branch secretaries' conference at King's College, London, and at the end of the year she became secretary of the council on probation. The title was changed to secretary of the society in October 1880. Although the society had been founded in 1875 it was not until May 1880 that the constitution was finally passed, and the next decade was to be a time of considerable expansion, with the formation of diocesan councils, councils for Gibraltar and northern and central Europe, and branches and similar societies in Scotland, Ireland, and America. Lucy Wright was closely involved in all this activity, besides attending the meetings of the central committees, arranging conferences, and other secretarial duties. During her sixteen years in office the membership increased from 52,000 to over 200,000. She worked closely with Mrs Townsend, who remained the president, and a lasting friendship was forged.<br>
<br>At first Lucy Wright travelled around the country on society business, but increasing frailty confined her to the London office, where she welcomed all. Towards the end of 1895 her health deteriorated and she went to Bordighera in Italy as the guest of Mr and Mrs Townsend, who owned a villa there. She became much worse during February 1896, and one of her nieces went to stay with her. She died there quite suddenly on 26 March 1896 and was buried in the cemetery at Bordighera.<br>
<br>Lucy Wright was not only a very efficient central secretary, but also a very popular one. Townsend, in her obituary in the <span class="italic">Girls' Quarterly</span>, dwelt on her attractive personality: &#145;Everything interested her; no one ever enjoyed the society of friends, or the opportunities of culture that London life affords, or the relaxation of a holiday more than she did, and her own bright manner and winning personality made her attractive to all &hellip;. She was always such good company, so full of fun and so susceptible to the real joy of humour&#146;. She emphasized the personal, rather than the administrative, success of Lucy Wright's work: &#145;To welcome all, to listen to all, to solve problems, to sympathise with the trials of workers, to encourage the faint-hearted, to receive confidences while betraying none, to interpret people to each other in the best way, to inspire others to go forward while keeping herself in the background, this was her true sphere of personal work&#146;. The weekly church newspaper <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> concluded its tribute by noting that &#145;Few women have been personally known to so large a circle; few certainly have been more beloved&#146;.<br>
