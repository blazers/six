<span class="headword">Savage,  William</span>  (1720&#150;1789), <span class="occ">singer and organist</span>, was born probably in London and was a pupil of J. C. Pepusch and Francesco Geminiani. As a boy he sang solo roles for Handel in the opera <span class="italic">Alcina</span>, in the masque <span class="italic">Acis and Galatea</span>, and in the oratorios <span class="italic">Athalia</span>&#151;in which his performance as the young king, Joas, &#145;met with universal Applause&#146;  (Dean, 259)&#151;<span class="italic">Esther</span>, and <span class="italic">Israel in Egypt</span>. He remained a prominent and evidently successful Handel singer and, after a short period as an alto, in the early 1740s was bass soloist in the operas <span class="italic">Imeneo</span> and <span class="italic">Deidamia</span> and the oratorios <span class="italic">L'allegro ed il penseroso</span>, <span class="italic">Saul</span>, <span class="italic">Samson</span>, and <span class="italic">Messiah</span>. He also sang in many of William Boyce's court odes, and was said to have &#145;a pleasant bass voice of the compass of two octaves: he had a clear articulation, perfect intonation, great volubility of voice, and chaste and good expression. In sacred music particularly, his pathos and feeling were excellent and very impressive&#146;  (Farmer, 194). In 1743 he was organist of Finchley parish church, and in 1744 he became a gentleman-in-ordinary at the Chapel Royal.<br>
<br>Savage was appointed vicar-choral, almoner, and master of the choristers at St Paul's Cathedral in 1748. There his responsibilities included supervising the musical studies of the boys of the choir, who all lived with him at his house in Paul's Bakehouse Court. One of them, R. J. S. Stevens, later defended Savage against Charles Burney's accusations of pomposity and self-importance, and remembered him as a thorough, if demanding, teacher. He could be &#145;violent and impatient in his temper to the greatest degree: and his impetuosity, sometimes drove him into chastising the boys almost to cruelty&#146;  (<span class="italic">Recollections</span>, 13), yet &#145;by constant attention to their elementary rules every morning before breakfast, he made them correct and ready performers&#146;  (Farmer, 195). Stevens was bound apprentice to Savage, as was Jonathan Battishill, who was also a cathedral chorister, and his other pupils included C. F. Reinhold, James and William Evance, and his successors at St Paul's, Robert Hudson and Richard Bellamy. Savage resigned the posts of almoner and master of the choristers in 1773 owing to ill health&#151;according to Stevens he was asthmatic&#151;and having on 5 April 1777 resigned also as vicar-choral he went to live in Tenterden, Kent. He returned to London three or four years later and advertised his readiness to take pupils.<br>
<br>In addition to church music Savage wrote secular songs, rounds, and catches&#151;he was a member of the Catch Club&#151;and some violin music. He was a member of both the Academy of Ancient Music and the Beefsteak Club. He was married to Mary Bolt (<i>d</i>. 1788), and they had three children: George (<i>d</i>. 1816), who became vicar of Kingston and Richmond, Jane, and William. <a name="cosubject_61889"></a><span class="headword">Jane Savage</span>  (1752/3&#150;1824), who was a notable <span class="occ">keyboard player</span>, published a number of <i>galant</i> keyboard compositions and vocal works. In 1793 she married Robert Rolleston, a merchant. William Savage died in London on 27 July 1789 and was buried at the end of Gray's Inn Lane in ground belonging to the parish of St George the Martyr, Bloomsbury. His library was later bought by Stevens.<br>
