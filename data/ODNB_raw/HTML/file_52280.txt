<span class="headword">Mascall,  Eric Lionel</span>  (1905&#150;1993), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and theologian</span>, was born on 12 December 1905 at 2 Earlsthorpe Road, Sydenham, London, the second of the two children (his elder brother had died in infancy) of John Richard Strutt Mascall, commercial traveller, and his wife, (Susan) Lilian, daughter of William Grundy and his wife, Susan Anne. From Latymer Upper School in Hammersmith, he went in 1924 to Pembroke College, Cambridge, with an open scholarship in mathematics, eventually obtaining first-class honours in 1928. But his hope to go on to an academic career did not materialize. Nor was he at this stage contemplating ordination. His first employment was as senior mathematics master at Bablake School in Coventry. His three years there were the unhappiest of his life for, in his own words, he &#145;had no training in teaching, &hellip; was no good at athletics and &hellip; was a bad disciplinarian&#146;  (Mascall, 97). However, during his time in Coventry he published two articles on Christianity and science in <span class="italic">Theology</span>, and in 1931 decided to offer himself for ordination. He proceeded to Ely Theological College for one year. Mascall had already become a committed Anglo-Catholic while still at school. At Cambridge particular influence on his religious life was exercised by the dean of Pembroke, Edward Wynn, later bishop of Ely, and by Mascall's old school friend Christopher Waddams, soon to become chaplain of St Catharine's College. Mascall's lifelong involvement with the Eastern Orthodox church began towards the end of his student days, when he attended the Second Anglo-Russian Student Conference. By 1929 he was already chairman of the executive committee of the Fellowship of St Alban and St Sergius.<br>
<br>Mascall served two short curacies, under the same vicar, at St Andrew's, Stockwell Green, and St Matthew's, Westminster. Especially in Stockwell, he was noted for his classes and talks on the Christian faith. He also published an article in <span class="italic">Theology</span> entitled &#145;Three modern approaches to God&#146;, and his first book, <span class="italic">Death or Dogma: Christian Faith and Social Theory</span> (1937), arose out of talks given to a study group at Stockwell. His introduction to the so-called Christian sociology of Maurice Reckitt and the Christendom Group began towards the end of his time in Westminster.<br>
<br>In 1937 Mascall was invited to become sub-warden of Lincoln Theological College. He threw himself into the tasks of teaching ordinands and writing philosophical theology. His first major book, <span class="italic">He who is: a Study in Traditional Theism</span>, appeared in 1943. It was a lucid re-examination of natural theology and established Mascall's reputation as an exponent of Thomism. It was submitted for, and received, the Cambridge BD the same year.<br>
<br>During vacations Mascall often stayed at All Saints, Margaret Street, London, and helped in setting up the Anglo-Catholic publishing house the Dacre Press, for which he wrote a short work on St John of the Cross and two paperbacks in the <span class="roman">Signposts</span> series, which he jointly edited. One of these, <span class="italic">Man: his Origin and Destiny</span> (1940), reflected his continuing interest in the Christendom Group. Soon after his move to Lincoln he made his profession as a member of the Oratory of the Good Shepherd, a society of celibate priests and laymen living under a rule.<br>
<br>In 1945 Mascall was persuaded to apply for a short-term lectureship in theology, with some chaplaincy duties, at Christ Church, Oxford. In fact he was to remain there for seventeen years, as student (fellow), tutor, and university lecturer in the philosophy of religion. His steady stream of publications consolidated his position as one of the country's leading Anglo-Catholic theologians. Particularly noteworthy were <span class="italic">Christ, the Christian and the Church</span> (1946), a study of the incarnation and its consequences; <span class="italic">Existence and Analogy</span> (1949), recommended to all students of analogy; <span class="italic">Christian Theology and Natural Science</span>, the Bampton lectures for 1956, and for many years regarded as the standard work on the subject; <span class="italic">The Recovery of Unity</span> (1958), a substantial contribution to ecumenism, commending, first and foremost, common study of the truth of Christian doctrine; and <span class="italic">The Importance of being Human</span> (1958), the American Bampton lectures, offering a reasoned Christian anthropology. Mascall's works were hardly original. They were full of long quotations from other authors, but they constituted an unparalleled attempt to set out, rationally, the truth content of the classical Christian tradition and to relate it, without a hint of accommodation or reduction, to the discoveries of the sciences. In a broadcast review of <span class="italic">The Recovery of Unity</span> Owen Chadwick observed that &#145;among the living thinkers of the Christian Church, Dr Mascall is in a minority of one&#146;, but also that he, like Hooker, exhibited &#145;the sane, clear-headedness of a devout mind&#146;. The stature of his work was marked by further higher degrees, the Oxford DD in 1948 and the Cambridge DD in 1958. (Later honours included an honorary DD from St Andrews in 1967 and fellowship of the British Academy in 1974.)<br>
<br>Mascall carried out his chaplaincy role as best he could, offering Cyprus sherry and tea, playing records, and appearing, rather implausibly, on the river bank and the touchline. His shyness made it difficult for undergraduates to get to know him, but those who persevered learned to appreciate his courtesy, his pastoral concern, and above all his quirky sense of humour, made public in two volumes of comic verse&#151;the first, <span class="italic">Pi in the High</span>, published towards the end of his Oxford time. In the intellectual fraternity of beleaguered Christians, Mascall was a natural member of the Socratic Club (dominated by C. S. Lewis) and the Metaphysicals, an informal group of Christian philosophers.<br>
<br>Having already turned down the offer of the Ely chair at Cambridge, Mascall, in 1962, accepted the invitation to become professor of historical theology at King's College, London, where he remained until retirement in 1973. His writings during these years and well into his retirement consisted mostly of reasoned rebuttals of various widely publicized books by liberal theologians. <span class="italic">Up and Down in Adria</span> (1963) was a response to <span class="italic">Soundings</span> (1962), edited by Alec Vidler. <span class="italic">The Secularisation of Christianity</span> (1965) contained a response to John Robinson's <span class="italic">Honest to God</span> (1963). <span class="italic">Theology and the Gospel of Christ</span> (1977) contained a response to <span class="italic">The Myth of God Incarnate</span> (1977), edited by John Hick. And <span class="italic">Whatever happened to the Human Mind?</span> (1980) contained a response to Geoffrey Lampe's <span class="italic">God as Spirit</span> (1977). These books showed Mascall's polemical conservatism at its best. Less appealing were his extraordinary arguments against the ordination of women and his defence of literal belief in the devil and the controlled practice of exorcism.<br>
<br>The one major, positive work during his London time was <span class="italic">The Openness of Being</span>, the Gifford lectures for 1970&#150;71. This was a wide-ranging exposition of contemporary natural theology, especially noteworthy for introducing a whole generation of students to the work of the so-called &#145;transcendental Thomists&#146;&#151;Karl Rahner, Emerich Coreth, and Bernard Lonergan&#151;and for advancing the influential metaphysical position known as critical realism.<br>
<br>Mascall's London home was the clergy house of St Mary's, Bourne Street, in Pimlico. <span class="italic">Whatever happened to the Human Mind?</span> was dedicated to the priests and people of this parish, &#145;who for many years have provided this grateful author with an altar and a home&#146;. He was also at home, surprisingly, in the National Liberal Club and, later, the Athenaeum.<br>
<br>Increasingly, Mascall was invited to lecture abroad&#151;Canada, the United States (nine visits in all), and South Africa&#151;and to visit church leaders and groups in Belgium, Romania, and Yugoslavia. But his favourite destination was Rome. His several visits &#145;ad limina Apostolorum&#146; were assuredly more congenial than that of Karl Barth. Mascall remained, nevertheless, quintessentially a Catholic Anglican. Eventually illness forced Mascall to leave Bourne Street for a nursing home, St Mary's House, King's Mead, Seaford, Sussex, where he died on 14 February 1993. A memorial service was held in the chapel of King's College, London, on 4 May 1993.<br>
