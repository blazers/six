<span class="headword">Power,  Lionel</span>  (<em>c.</em>1375<span class="mult">x</span>80&#150;1445), <span class="occ">composer</span>, is of unknown origins, and his early training and professional experience are also unrecorded. By September 1418 he was a lay singing man and master of the choristers of the household chapel of Thomas, duke of Clarence. He may have been recruited to this chapel at its inception in 1411&#150;13; his service until its disbandment on 29 September 1421, following the duke's death, included a spell in northern France (October 1419 to spring 1421). His employment immediately after 1421 remains unidentified; in all probability he moved to other aristocratic service at a comparable level, quite probably in the household chapel of John, duke of Bedford. In 1438 he became the first master of the newly inaugurated lady chapel choir at Canterbury Cathedral (eight boys, with a few appropriately skilled monks), and in this semi-retirement post he stayed until his death. The fact that Canterbury sources style him esquire and gentleman indicates that he remained a layman.<br>
<br>Power's output exhibits mastery of many of the styles cultivated over a lengthy period of about fifty years. He became, with John Dunstaple, a leading contributor to the emergence and development of a body of English compositional practice which from <i>c</i>.1420 to <i>c</i>.1450, in terms of both style and content, was received in continental Europe not only with admiration, but also with emulation by contemporaries; English manuscripts were extensively copied.<br>
<br>Between thirty-five and forty surviving works are attributable to Power, of which some twenty-two occur in the English Old Hall manuscript  (BL, Add. MS 57950, <i>c</i>.1418, additions <i>c</i>.1421&#150;5). As well as Marian votive antiphons written in a relatively direct and simple descant style incorporating the plainsong they include movements from the ordinary of the mass composed to exploit the ample resources offered by Clarence's chapel: isorhythmic pieces based on mathematically complex dispositions of the <i>cantus firmus</i>; richly scored items for four or even five voices; and pieces modelled in style on the contemporary French secular chanson, some involving the elaborate syncopations and intricate proportional notations of the <i>ars subtilior</i>.<br>
<br>Few of Power's early works were known outside England; by contrast, virtually all of his later pieces survive only in continental sources (especially north Italian). Such transmission may have been facilitated by lengthy sojourns between 1419 and 1438 with aristocratic employers in the conquered regions of France; however it was plainly triggered by Power's role in the contemporary application of a sweetly consonant harmonic style to a novel homogeneity and grandeur of musical conception, which together constituted the much admired <i>contenance angloise</i>. Already by <i>c</i>.1419 he was composing paired movements of the ordinary of the mass, and within another few years he and his contemporaries had developed the unified mass cycle, of which Power's mass <span class="italic">Alma redemptoris mater</span> is possibly the earliest surviving example. This was the first multi-movement polyphonic form in music history; by lifting composition from the realm of the miniaturist to that of the formulator of broad plans and grand designs, it provided the foundation on which European emulators, particularly Guillaume Dufay and Johannes Ockeghem, were to develop the continental Renaissance style later in the fifteenth century.<br>
<br>From the last years of Power's career came four or five late Marian votive antiphons appropriate to performance in Canterbury Cathedral lady chapel, and also a vernacular treatise prescribing a course of instruction for teaching singing boys the skills of improvising at sight a counterpoint to plainsong. Power died at Canterbury on 5 June 1445 in one of the cathedral's guest lodgings, and was buried the following day in the lay cemetery within the precinct.<br>
