<span class="headword">Oakley,  Edward</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1765), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was first recorded in 1721 as an unsuccessful applicant for the post of clerk of works at the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields, London. This was presumably after his return from a period of &#145;civil service&#146; abroad, where, he claimed, he had &#145;long contemplated a famous Republick&#146;, most likely in Venice  (E. Oakley, <span class="italic">The Magazine of Architecture, Perspective, and Sculpture</span>, 1730, pt 2, preface).<br>
<br>Organized freemasonry occupied much of Oakley's time from 1724 to about 1731. He was one of the founders of the lodge of the Nag's Head and Star in Carmarthen, south Wales, in 1724 or 1725 and its senior warden in 1726. But the centre of his masonic activity was the lodge at the Three Compasses (or Carpenters' Arms) in Silver Street, London, of which he was senior warden in 1725 and later master. The speech he delivered to this lodge on 31 December 1728 was one of the earliest to define the qualifications and duties of members of the fraternity, laying stress on the dissemination of architectural knowledge through lectures and books. It gained considerable authority among a widespread audience of operatives in the building trades by its publication in Benjamin Cole's popular, pocket-size edition of <span class="italic">The Ancient Constitutions of the Free and Accepted Masons</span> (1728&#150;9).<br>
<br>Oakley practised what he preached: in 1730 he published <span class="italic">The Magazine of Architecture, Perspective, and Sculpture</span>, containing &#145;the most material Precepts from our best Authors &hellip; reduced &hellip; to the Easiest Practice&#146;. For the benefit of craftsmen who could not afford this impressive folio he issued a second edition between October 1732 and May 1733 in sixteen fortnightly instalments costing 12<i>d</i>. each. His final contribution, <span class="italic">Every man a compleat builder, or, Easy rules and proportions for drawing and working the several parts of architecture</span>, published in 1766, was a reissue of W. Robinson's <span class="italic">Proportional Architecture</span> (1733) to which he added practical material lifted without acknowledgement from other authors.<br>
<br>As a builder in his own right, Oakley is not memorable. Though he advertised his services as a surveyor, measurer, designer, draughtsman, and manager of buildings, he did not make a name for himself in any of these fields. He competed unsuccessfully for the design of Westminster Bridge in 1735 and submitted the same indifferent designs in 1756 for Blackfriars Bridge with the same negative result. An engraving of the latter scheme was published in William Maitland's <span class="italic">History of London</span> (1756). The greenhouses and hothouses at Chelsea Physic Garden are the only buildings known to have been executed to his designs, of which he published an engraving by Benjamin Cole. They were begun in 1732 and finished in 1734. Oakley probably died in 1765; he was described as &#145;the late Edward Oakley&#146; in a publisher's advertisement dated 20 November 1765 for his last book, <span class="italic">Every Man a Compleat Builder</span> (1766).<br>
