<span class="headword">Butler,  (Christina) Violet</span>  (1884&#150;1982), <span class="occ">social work trainer</span>, was born on 25 January 1884 at 14 Norham Gardens, Oxford, the youngest child in the family of one son and three daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32206/', "Arthur Gray Butler (1831&#150;1909)")</script>, first headmaster of Haileybury College and fellow of Oriel College, Oxford, and his wife, Harriet Jessie, daughter of M. Pakenham Edgeworth, botanist and Indian civil servant, and niece of Maria Edgeworth. With Josephine Butler for an aunt, and with so many relatives in literary, philanthropic, and educational circles, Violet was almost predestined to a life of social service. Deeply fond of her parents, she was educated at home until aged fourteen. She then went to Wycombe Abbey, left at seventeen, and took a first in modern history from the Society of Home Students (later St Anne's College) in Oxford in 1905. Equipped with a knowledge of four languages, she was the first woman to gain a distinction in the diploma in economics and political science; she then took a teaching diploma at London University.<br>
<br>Social work came naturally to an intelligent unmarried Edwardian middle-class young woman, especially since her mother had visited the local workhouse once a week for half a century and her elder sister Olive had become warden of the Lady Margaret Hall settlement in Lambeth, London. Besides, Violet admired the sense of civic duty that inspired seven women, all wives of dons, who were then prominent in Oxford for their voluntary social work: an older trio consisting of Charlotte Green (Mrs T. H. Green), Bertha Johnson (Mrs A. H. Johnson), and Charlotte Toynbee (Mrs A. Toynbee); and a quartet who were Violet's near-contemporaries&#151;Mabel Prichard (Mrs H. A. Prichard), Mary Smith (Mrs A. L. Smith), Frances Wells (Mrs J. Wells), and her much-loved former tutor in economics, Mrs H. A. L. Fisher. A lifelong member of the Oxford Cottage Improvement Society, Violet Butler joined the local branch of the Charity Organization Society, and her links with the Christian Social Union encouraged in her the unsectarian broad-church outlook that was taken for granted within a family so deeply influenced by Thomas Arnold, T. H. Green, and Henry Scott Holland. Throughout her life she operated on the fruitful margin that arbitrarily separates the statutory from the voluntary body.<br>
<br>Butler's <span class="italic">Social Conditions in Oxford</span> (1912) grew out of her three earlier local preoccupations: housing reform, getting adolescents into skilled work, and (through the Women's Industrial Council) extending women's job opportunities. This work was one of several provincial surveys (of Norwich and Cambridge, for example) inspired by the work of Benjamin Seebohm Rowntree, whose <span class="italic">Poverty: a Study of Town Life</span> appeared in 1901. Family connections gave Butler an inside view of Oxford's local government, and hers is the best account of it in all the surveys. Suffused with a sense of history, precise yet pragmatic in mood, the book's readability gains from its author's gentle sense of irony and exemplifies an Edwardian affinity between literature and &#145;social science&#146; that has since been lost. The work also displays the combination of intellectual curiosity, affectionate interest in human nature, and down-to-earth practicality that the Charity Organization Society so often encouraged.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Social Conditions in Oxford</span> gave Butler the academic credentials she needed, and from 1914 to 1945 she combined her local social work with acting as tutor in economics at St Anne's and tutor-secretary (1914&#150;19) for women students at Barnett House, Oxford's centre for training in social work. From 1919 to 1948 she was secretary for social training there, and later she published privately a booklet on its history. The union of social thought and social action at Barnett House admirably suited her temperament. After 1914 she concentrated on teaching, but she found time to compile an attitude survey, the Women's Industrial Council report <span class="italic">Domestic Service</span> (1916), and her pamphlet <span class="italic">Village Survey-Making</span> (1929), which encouraged country schools to hunt out information about the past and present of their localities.<br>
<br>Selfless, retiring, and personally somewhat disorganized, Butler founded her influence on friendships. Her determination sometimes degenerated into obstinacy, but her gentle wit and bright eyes softened the impact, and she came to seem the embodiment of practical Christianity. Subtly combining progressive and conservative attitudes, she was cautious in her feminism and rather regretted her college's gradual evolution into an ordinary undergraduate college. She remained active and intellectually alert until well into her eighties, a much-loved figure who was often seen cycling about north Oxford on her many errands, still pursuing her Edwardian aim of using friendly personal contact to draw together paid and voluntary welfare workers, town and gown, and rich and poor. She died in Oxford on 19 May 1982.<br>
