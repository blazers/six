<span class="headword">Taylor,  Michael Angelo</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1757&#150;1834), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was baptized at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, London, on 13 July 1757, the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27077/', "Sir Robert Taylor (1714&#150;1788)")</script>, architect, and his wife, Lady Taylor (1722/3&#150;1803), of whom no further details are known. He entered Westminster School in January 1766 and then, destined for the law, he was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1769, transferring to Lincoln's Inn in 1770. He was called to the bar in November 1774, three weeks after admission to Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he graduated BA in 1778, proceeding MA from St John's College in 1781. Endowed by his father with &pound;20,000 and &pound;2000 a year, he subordinated his professional to political ambitions, at first supporting Pitt the younger's administration. His initial bid to enter the House of Commons in 1784, as MP for Preston, was thwarted by an unfavourable decision on the electoral franchise, but he found another constituency, Poole, where he was newly appointed recorder during the same election. A diminutive figure, disingenuous and pompous by turns, although not malicious, he excited ridicule after describing himself in debate on 9 February 1785 as &#145;but a chicken&#146; in his profession: in that guise he was lampooned by Sheridan and often caricatured by Gillray and others. He first differed from Pitt over parliamentary reform, to which he was opposed from 1784 to 1785. In 1787, too, he became one of the managers' committee for the impeachment of Warren Hastings, which was espoused by the whig opposition leaders.<br>
<br>The death of his father in 1788 provided Taylor with a life interest in &pound;100,000, the residue of which was reserved for founding the Taylor Institution at Oxford. On 7 August 1789 he married Frances Anne Vane (<i>d</i>. 1835), the attractive daughter and heir of the Revd Sir Henry Vane, first baronet (1729&#150;1794), of Long Newton, co. Durham, and his first wife, Frances Tempest. They had one daughter. His marriage procured him a whig electoral interest. He joined Brooks's Club in 1789 and the Whig Club in 1791. Despite defeat at Poole in 1790, he regained the seat on petition on 25 February 1791, after sitting by substitution for Heytesbury, Wiltshire, since 22 December previous. He became a regular whig spokesman and teller on many issues, publicly converting to parliamentary reform on 30 April 1792 as a member of the Society of Friends of the People. His bid on 28 March 1792 to abolish the national lottery on moral grounds failed. Critical of the hostilities with revolutionary France, he opposed repression and growing state power at home and subsidies to continental allies. He also espoused the cause of George, prince of Wales. His electoral interest at Poole was undermined by his agent, and he was defeated in 1796. Despite talk of his switching to Southwark, it was as MP for Aldeburgh that he was returned to parliament. After joining Fox in arguing for the dismissal of the ministry and in favour of parliamentary reform, in May 1797 he seceded from parliament with the Foxites until June 1798. Subsequently he opposed Pitt on all major measures. On 17 March 1800 he succeeded his brother-in-law as member for Durham City. In 1801 he was mentioned as a plausible candidate for the speakership. He lost his Durham seat in 1802.<br>
<br>Taylor remained out of parliament until 1806, when his friends took office. He had taken up residence in Yorkshire, first at Park Hill, Bawtry, then at Ledstone Hall, where he entertained the prince of Wales, and later at Cantley. In 1806, refusing other offers, he was returned for Rye as a Treasury nominee. Illness curtailed his attendance, but he voted against his friends' dismissal by George III on 9 April 1807. At the ensuing election he came in for Ilchester on the prince of Wales's interest, becoming in 1808 a member of the prince's duchy council. He acted with the whig opposition unless the prince objected, and served as amanuensis for the prince when he wrote his acceptance of the regency on 11 January 1811. In 1812 he was one of two MPs who took evidence from witnesses to Spencer Perceval's assassination. The regent's abandonment of the whigs embarrassed him, particularly as his return for Poole in 1812 received Treasury support. He still leaned to opposition on some questions, such as legal reform and Catholic relief; but he had no wish to quarrel with the regent, who professed &#145;he loved no man so well&#146;  (<span class="italic">Creevey Papers</span>, 1.211). Frances Taylor was a vivacious hostess and their dinner table at Privy Gardens, Whitehall, was at her connivance a frequent resort of whig politicians. It was there that the regent's daughter Princess Caroline fled in June 1814. Taylor's break with the regent, foreshadowed by his vote against renewed hostilities with Napoleon in 1815, became complete after Sheridan's death in 1816, Taylor's hopes of succeeding to his duchy office being dashed. He turned increasingly to opposition, and his recapture of Durham in 1818 enabled him to join the whigs with impunity: he held the seat until 1831. In 1827 he claimed, &#145;I have supported the Whigs for eight and thirty years at an expense of above &pound;30,000&#146;  (ibid., 2.116).<br>
<br>Whatever his political difficulties, Taylor was untrammelled in his pursuit of one aim in parliament: the reform of the chancery court, which under Eldon's chancellorship had become a byword for delay. From 1810 he regularly sought a remedy. The creation of the vice-chancellorship in 1813 helped, but he was unable to obtain sufficient support, nor was he severely critical of Eldon: by 1823 the whigs counted on another reformer, John Williams. Taylor continued to play his part: on 12 February 1828 he told the house the history of his campaign, and in his last speech, on 31 July 1833, claimed that the court operated to the ruin of all property. Aspects of criminal law reform also interested him. In 1815 he secured the abolition of the pillory, and he opposed capital punishment for forgery. Another interest was improvement of public environmental amenities: his <span class="roman">Metropolitan Paving Act</span> of 1817 legislated for the removal of nuisances and obstructions from London streets: he also promoted their gas lighting. In 1820&#150;21 he sought to curb pollution from steam engines and furnaces and to reduce the speed of stagecoach drivers, and in 1825 he exposed faults in London's water supply. He advocated poor law relief, and humane treatment of ailing prisoners (1823) and lunatics (1827).<br>
<br>Disappointed in hopes of office in 1827, Taylor had to be satisfied with a privy councillorship, granted on 23 February 1831 following the whigs' return to power. That month he presented a Durham parliamentary reform petition, even though he was critical of strident reformers. In the reformed house of 1832 he sat for Sudbury, Suffolk. Sometimes styled &#145;Father of the House&#146;, he appeared in Sir George Hayter's oil painting of the Commons of 1833. He died on 16 July 1834 at his town house, in Privy Gardens, Whitehall, and was buried on 23 July in the family vault in St Martin-in-the-Fields, London. His wife died on 14 January 1835.<br>
