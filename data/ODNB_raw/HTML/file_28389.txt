<span class="headword">Wadsworth,  James</span>  (<em>c.</em>1572&#150;1623), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and Roman Catholic convert</span>, matriculated at Cambridge in 1586 as a scholar of Emmanuel College, where he was a friend and contemporary of William Bedell. He graduated BA in 1590, MA in 1593, and BD in 1600. After ordination, in June 1596, he served as vicar of Tharston, Suffolk, before being appointed rector of Pakesfield (1598&#150;1603) and vicar of Cotton and Great Thornton (1600&#150;07). He also served as chaplain to Bishop Redman of Norwich. He and his wife, Susannah, whom he married in Suffolk, had four children, the youngest of whom was born in 1604. In May 1605 he was appointed chaplain to Sir Charles Cornwallis on his embassy to Spain. In a letter to Bedell he later claimed that his religious views had been unsettled for three or four years before his departure, and his allegiance to the Church of England was further shaken in the course of controversy with English Jesuits at Valladolid. In August 1605 he left the embassy for Salamanca, where he was received into the Roman Catholic church. After a period of theological study at the University of Alcal&aacute; de Henares he was granted a pension by the Spanish crown and given employment by the Inquisition. Wadsworth also converted his brother Paul, or Seth, who emigrated to Spain and was appointed consul of the English speaking community at Sanl&uacute;car de Barrameda in 1612. Wadsworth's emotive translation into Spanish of the parliamentary statutes enacted in the wake of the Gunpowder Plot, published in Madrid, gave offence to the British ambassador and embarrassed the Spanish authorities.<br>
<br>Wadsworth's wife, two sons, and two daughters joined him in Spain in 1610. From 1610 to 1620 he kept up a friendly theological debate with William Bedell, who published their correspondence after Wadsworth's death. At Madrid he was tutor in English to the infanta Maria, for whom he may have prepared <span class="italic">Grammar Spanish and English</span>, published at London in 1622. His unpublished correspondence from 1618 with Sir Robert Phelips provides information about Prince Charles's visit to Madrid in 1623 and his negotiations for the Spanish match. Wadsworth died of consumption on 30 November 1623 and was buried in Madrid. According to the records of the English College, Madrid, his widow Susannah, was still living at Madrid in 1632. Their younger son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28390/', "James Wadsworth")</script> became a government informer who betrayed many of his former Roman Catholic brethren. Wadsworth's apologia, <span class="italic">The Contrition of a Protestant Preacher</span>, a meditation on <span class="roman">Psalm 50</span>, was published posthumously at St Omer in 1625.<br>
