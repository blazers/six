<span class="headword">Williams,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1732&#150;1795), <span class="occ">mining engineer and archaeologist</span>, was born in the parish of Ceri, Montgomeryshire, where the frequency of his surname and the state of record keeping conceal his parentage. After education in the village school, and having found farming not to his liking, Williams entered the mining profession. He was first involved with lead mines in mid-Wales and copper mines in Anglesey, but subsequently he moved to Scotland&#151;probably in the mid-1740s. He is first recorded there as a surveyor for the military survey of Scotland (1747&#150;55). He was also involved in lead mining at Leadhills and near Edinburgh.<br>
<br>From 1763 to 1775 Williams was employed by the commissioners for the forfeited annexed estates. His first mineral discoveries were in the north of Scotland: in 1764 George Clerk Maxwell and James Hutton set out on a fact-finding geological tour to the north of Scotland, apparently as a result of Williams's early findings. From 1764 to 1769 Williams also leased the mine at the small isolated coalfield of Brora in Sutherland. Here he made major investments, erecting a wagon-way and steam engine. However, the latter caught fire and, as a result, he sustained heavy losses.<br>
<br>Williams was married by 1765 but was involved in a second relationship at Brora, which produced at least one illegitimate child and caused Williams to be threatened by the kirk officers. This, together with financial difficulties, forced Williams to move on, and he became an itinerant mineral surveyor for the forfeited annexed estates commissioners (1769&#150;75). During this period he also reported on the &#145;parallel roads&#146; (former lake strand-lines) of Glenroy and discovered the vitrified forts in northern Scotland, on which he published his first book in 1777 (later translated into Russian). He thought the stonework of these hill-forts had been intentionally vitrified by the action of fire.<br>
<br>About 1776 Williams moved to superintend coal works at Blackburn near West Calder, becoming overseer and factor to Gilmerton colliery in 1778. The proximity of the latter works to Edinburgh allowed Williams to become a founding &#145;associated artist&#146; of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland in 1780. He read four papers to this society, only the last of which, on reafforesting the highlands, was published, in 1792.<br>
<br>Williams had been recommended to Gilmerton by the earl of Buchan (David Stuart Erskine (1742&#150;1829)) who much encouraged him. One outcome was the essay Williams wrote on supplying the want of coal in the highlands. Both this essay and his suggestions for improving the fisheries of Scotland gained him awards from the Highland Society in 1785. Williams hoped implementation of these ideas would discourage emigration from the region at the end of the American War of Independence, but neither work was published until 1799.<br>
<br>Williams's coal essay became the foundation for his major work, a two-volume <span class="italic">Natural History of the Mineral Kingdom</span>, first published in 1789. It filled a vacuum in scientific and technical literature in English&#151;its subject matter was not then taught in British universities. The book carried a first (negative) reaction to James Hutton's newly announced <span class="italic">Theory of the Earth</span>. But it drew Williams to wide attention and brought him a gold medal from Empress Catherine of Russia, and in July 1792 he was introduced, in Edinburgh, to a rich Venetian nobleman, Count Alvise Zenobio (1757&#150;1817), who held revolutionary views. Zenobio wished to improve his Venetian estates by locating and utilizing their mineral resources, and in 1793 Williams duly set out to survey them.<br>
<br>However, unbeknownst to Williams, Zenobio's activities as an undesirable alien soon came to the attention of the British authorities. Initially asked to leave the country, in February 1794 Zenobio was imprisoned in London for debt. Meanwhile Williams was collecting samples and wandering round north Italy like a &#145;dumb pilgrim&#146;  (De Rubeis, 1795, 17&#150;8), since he spoke neither Italian nor French. He contracted typhoid and died on 29 May 1795 at Count Zenobio's house at Verona. The mineral observations he had made on his travels passed to the Italian zoologist Giuseppe Olivi (1769&#150;1795) who hoped to publish a summary. However, he too died within months, and the work was lost.<br>
<br>A second edition of Williams's 1790 book was published in 1810 and portions were translated into German and published in America. For a largely self-educated miner this was a remarkable achievement. He had noted in 1787 how he &#145;had spent more of my time in the mines &hellip; than perhaps any other mineral man on earth&#146; and, on this basis, believed that &#145;Britain receives more benefits from the bowels of the earth than perhaps any other nation&#146;  (Williams).<br>
