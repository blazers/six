<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fish,  Elizabeth Mary Jane</span>  (1860&#150;1944), <span class="occ">schoolteacher</span>, was born at 83 North Woodside Road, Glasgow, on 22 December 1860, the daughter of William Fish, a city missionary, and his wife, Jane McNaughton. Her schooling took place at Sharp's Institution in Perth, where her parents had married and where her father was chaplain. She returned to Glasgow to pursue a career in teaching, beginning as a pupil teacher at Henderson Street public school, where she came first in Scotland in the queen's scholarship examination, and went as a student to the Glasgow Church of Scotland Training College. In June 1881 she taught at Runford Street public school; two years later she moved to Shields Road public school. In 1895 she taught at the Pupil Teachers' Institute, Glasgow, moving to Whitehill higher grade school in 1907, and in 1918 to John Street higher grade school, both in Glasgow. She also conducted evening classes for the cure of stammering, and lectured in hygiene and physiology at the Royal Technical College and the Glasgow and West of Scotland College of Domestic Science. She resisted calls from eugenicists to introduce &#145;race improvement&#146; and &#145;sex hygiene&#146; into the classrooms, seeing the latter as a parental responsibility.<br>
<br>A versatile scholar, Miss Fish became an LLA (lady literate in arts) of St Andrews University in 1885, and studied Italian, for which she was awarded the Society of Arts medal, as well as French. She was president of the Scottish Modern Languages Association for two years, becoming principal teacher of modern languages at Bellahouston Academy, Glasgow, in 1920, from where she retired in August 1925.<br>
<br>Miss Fish held office in the Glasgow branch of the Class Teachers' Association, was president of the Glasgow local association of the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS), and was active in the institute's annual ladies' meeting. She wrote for the EIS paper, the <span class="italic">Educational News</span>. In June 1913 she was elected the first woman president of the EIS, polling 4822 votes against three male candidates whose combined votes totalled 3068. In her presidential address to the annual congress in January 1914, she called for improvements in teachers' salaries. She pointed to the declining numbers of men attracted to teaching as a career, but while acknowledging the principle of equal pay for male and female teachers, she argued that:<blockquote>if we teachers ask that the salaries of all teachers be now raised to the level of what men teachers think theirs ought to be, we shall alienate the sympathies of a public not yet convinced of the justice of our demand. (<span class="italic">Scottish Educational Journal</span>, 39, 9 Jan 1914, 30)</blockquote>Her obituary in the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span> (22 March 1944) nevertheless saw her as &#145;the champion of women teachers in Scotland&#146;, and though she considered it unwise to demand equal pay, she condemned the low pay of women teachers and warned that, as new careers opened up for women in medicine and the civil service, there would be a decline in the quality as well as the numbers of women entering the classrooms, paralleling the decline of men in the previous half century. Miss Fish died in Paisley Infirmary on 21 March 1944 after a fall in her home, Morven, 18 Dalhousie Road, Milliken Park, Renfrewshire.<br>
