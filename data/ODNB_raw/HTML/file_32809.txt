<span class="headword">Dibbs, Sir  George Richard</span>  (1834&#150;1904), <span class="occ">politician in Australia</span>, born at Flagstaff Hill, Upper Fort Street, Sydney, on 12 October 1834, was the youngest of the three sons of John Dibbs (<i>b</i>. 1790), master mariner, and his wife, Sophia Elizabeth Allwright (1809&#150;1891). He was educated in Sydney at St Philip's Church of England School and at J. D. Lang's Australian College. On 18 March 1857 he married Annie Maria Robey (1835&#150;1909), and joined his father-in-law, Ralph Mayer Robey (1809&#150;1864), in a sugar refinery which was bought by the Colonial Sugar Co. two years later. He worked with his brother, John Campbell Dibbs (1830&#150;1899), in a shipping agency, managing in turn the Newcastle and the Sydney offices, and in 1865 started a successful branch at Valpara&iacute;so, after running a blockade to enter the city. In 1866 the firm became bankrupt on the failure of the Agra Bank; but by 1875 the creditors had been paid in full, and Dibbs &amp; Co. became one of the foremost firms in Sydney.<br>
<br>At forty years of age Dibbs began his political career with his election as one of the members for West Sydney in the legislative assembly of New South Wales. He was returned as a supporter of local business and as one of the leading members of the Public Schools League, which championed free compulsory and secular education in state primary schools. In 1877 he was defeated, because of working-class opposition to government-assisted immigration, which he supported. In 1880 he won public favour by his coolness in submitting to a year in debtors' prison instead of paying damages in a slander suit. In 1882 he was returned for St Leonards in northern Sydney and in January 1883 became colonial treasurer in the ministry of Sir Alexander Stuart. The government stopped the sale of crown lands on which the colonial revenue had hitherto depended. On 7 October 1885 Dibbs succeeded Stuart as premier. In the elections of October 1885 he lost his seat at St Leonards to Sir Henry Parkes, but was immediately returned by the Murrumbidgee, a country seat he held until 1894. His ministry was defeated on 21 December 1885, owing to a deficit caused by the stoppage of land sales.<br>
<br>From 26 February 1886 to 19 January 1887 Dibbs was colonial secretary in the Jennings ministry, which struggled to restore the revenues through new forms of taxation. In July 1887 Dibbs declared his conversion from free trade to protection, speaking of his road to Damascus. From 17 January to 6 March 1889 he was again premier and colonial secretary in a minority government. In March 1891 he was appointed a delegate to the federation convention held in Sydney, in spite of Parkes's objection on the ground of his ostensible republican sympathies: he preferred unification to federation. On 23 October 1891, on the defeat of Parkes's ministry, Dibbs became, for a third time, premier and colonial secretary in a Protectionist ministry with Labor support. His government introduced a modest protective tariff, electoral reform (one man, one vote), and a labour bureau to assist the unemployed. In June 1892 he visited England on a special mission to reassure London capitalists of the financial stability not only of New South Wales but of Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand. He was largely successful and was created KCMG on 24 July 1892. In 1893 there was a financial crisis: many banks closed their doors, and the panic was stopped only by the prompt action of Dibbs's government in guaranteeing savings bank deposits, making banknotes legal tender, and providing treasury advances. This made him popular for a time.<br>
<br>In March 1893 Dibbs himself had become bankrupt and resigned his seat, while retaining the premiership. He was at once re-elected. At the elections in July 1894 Protectionist numbers were severely reduced, and Dibbs subsequently resigned office. In further elections a year later he lost his seat and retired from politics in September 1895, but he was managing trustee of the Savings Bank of New South Wales until his death.<br>
<br>Dibbs was very tall and robust physically and temperamentally. In early life he had followed his mother's move from Presbyterianism to the Church of England. He died of heart disease at his home, Passy, Hunter's Hill, Sydney, on 5 August 1904 and was buried on the 6th in St Thomas's Church of England cemetery in North Sydney. His wife, two sons, and nine daughters survived him.<br>
