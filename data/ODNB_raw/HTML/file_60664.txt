<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Charteris,  Hugo Francis Guy</span>  (1922&#150;1970), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 11 December 1922, at 26 Catherine Street, Victoria, London, the son of the Hon. Guy Lawrence Charteris (1886&#150;1967) and his first wife, Frances Lucy Tennant (1887&#150;1925), granddaughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36455/', "Sir Charles Tennant")</script>. As an adolescent he spent many holidays with his aunt, the countess of Plymouth. He left Eton College in 1941 to join the Scots Guards and was twice wounded on war service, receiving the MC. While public relations officer for south-east Asia command in Malaya and Java (1945&#150;7), he edited an English-language newspaper and wrote short stories. After leaving the army he read English at Trinity College, Oxford, for a few frustrating terms (1947&#150;8). In 1948 he married Virginia Mary (<i>b</i>. 1922), daughter of Colin Gurdon Forbes Adam and granddaughter of the third Baron Wenlock. They had two sons (of whom the elder drowned in 1951) and three daughters. He was enabled to marry by his then brother-in-law Viscount Rothermere, for whom he worked dishearteningly on the <span class="italic">Hull Evening News</span> and as sub-editor on the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> before being sent to Paris as second correspondent, chiefly writing feature articles for the <span class="italic">Continental Daily Mail</span>. In Paris he became interested in Jungian psychology through Charles Janson, who had married the duke of Sutherland's heir (herself afterwards countess of Sutherland in her own right). On abandoning full-time journalism in 1951 Charteris settled in a house on the Sutherland estates, hoping to live by a novelist's earnings. He was sustained by commissions from Malcolm Muggeridge of <span class="italic">Punch</span> and afterwards by contributing feature articles in the <span class="italic">Telegraph</span> newspapers. He also earned fees in the early 1960s as a children's photographer and translated an anthropological text on voodoo.<br>
<br>With the support of Rosamond Lehmann, Charteris published <span class="italic">A Share of the World</span> in 1952, hailed by Francis Wyndham as &#145;the most impressive first novel that has appeared since the war&#146;  (<span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span>, 6 Aug 1954, xlvii). Its protagonist, emotionally crippled by war memories, develops a paranoiac obsession symbolized by a crafty butler employed by his fianc&eacute;e's family. The lively <span class="italic">Marching with April</span> (1956) concerns a melancholic former prisoner of war and Jungian analysand (inspired by Charles Janson) who is bequeathed a highlands estate under a will vetoing its sale and desiring him to relinquish psychological cults. <span class="italic">Picnic at Porokorro</span> (1958) depicts expatriates caught in an African colonial diamond town threatened by native independence. In <span class="italic">The Lifeline</span> (1961) the fantasies of an exuberant poseur are challenged by the parochial mediocrity of highlands society. <span class="italic">Pictures on the Wall</span> (1963) explores the dilemma of the warden of a detention centre for juvenile offenders ensnared by domesticity and excessive conscientiousness (based on a man whom Charteris had interviewed for the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>).<br>
<br>Charteris depicted aristocratic fortitude in its more ruthless manifestations, and mined the lives of his relations for material. The family in his first novel was hurtfully based on his parents-in-law and in several novels his father's bumbling is affectionately portrayed. Charteris believed that his brother-in-law <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33168/', "Ian Fleming")</script> had plagiarized his ideas, and wrote a novel about Fleming entitled <span class="italic">The Explorers</span> which was suppressed by Charteris's sister Anne Fleming. <span class="italic">The Coat</span> (1966), in which an Eton boy wanders Liverpool in the blitz with a quarter of a million pounds' worth of diamonds belonging to an avaricious nobleman sewn into the lining of his coat, contains merciless portraits of another brother-in-law, the third earl of Dudley and his countess, Laura Charteris, whose eyes are described as &#145;brimming with a look that was <i>hot</i>, <i>ruthless</i> and <i>deprived</i> like the eyes of a big animal in a circus stranded on some big coloured box till the ringmaster snaps his whip&#146;  (p. 32). <span class="italic">The Tide is Right</span>, Charteris's powerful account of jealousy in a Scottish landed family, was withdrawn in 1957 after legal threats and published in Illinois only in 1991. Sir Oswald Mosley, who was related by marriage to his wife's family, launched (but later abandoned) a libel action over the tragic fascist portrayed in <span class="italic">The River Watcher</span> (1965). The former Congo mercenary in that novel was in part based on Mosley's son Nicholas, afterwards third Baron Ravensdale, with whom Charteris had a long friendship.<br>
<br>Charteris's patrician values were tempered with Jungian ideas. The epigraphs for <span class="italic">Marching with April</span>&#151;&#145;In destroying the true world we also destroyed the apparent world&#146;  (Nietzsche)&#151;and for <span class="italic">The Indian Summer of Gabriel Murray</span> (1968)&#151;&#145;An honest admission of modernity means voluntarily declaring oneself bankrupt&#146;  (Jung)&#151;show his spiritual estrangement. In books like <span class="italic">The Lifeline</span> he superbly evoked Scottish landscape. Charteris's central characters were religious-minded people who lacked a religion: they could not be reconciled to their environment without losing their sanity or self-respect. His psychological analysis was often brilliant; a versatile raconteur and mimic, he used these gifts to array a diverse range of authentic minor or comic characters. His prose was elegant and nervous, combining the allusive, elliptical witticisms of a Nabokov with the ominous unease of a Camus; occasionally its concision made his meaning a mystery for readers. Even when his characters failed to communicate with each other, their jaded society talk was supercharged with &#145;rudeness [that] was deliberate, murderous yet frantic&#146;  (Charteris, <span class="italic">Indian Summer</span>, 130). In addition to two children's books, Charteris wrote for television after 1965. His contributions to a BBC series about a flat-share, <span class="italic">Take Three Girls</span> (1969&#150;71), were his most popular work. His television masterpiece, <span class="italic">The Toggle</span>, was a mordant portrayal of the helpless isolation of a schoolboy controlled by adults who are cold, harsh, selfish, and amorous.<br>
<br>In youth Charteris had a Byronic beauty and in middle age was gauntly handsome. He died of cancer on 20 December 1970 at his home, The Grange, Elvington, Yorkshire, and was buried in St Helen's churchyard, Skipwith, near Selby, Yorkshire.<br>
