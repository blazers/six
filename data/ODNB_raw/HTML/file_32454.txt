<span class="headword">Close,  Maxwell Henry</span>  (1822&#150;1903), <span class="occ">geologist and man of science</span>, born on 23 October 1822 at 7 Merrion Square East, Dublin, the eldest son among the eight sons and three daughters of Henry Samuel Close, later of Newtown Park House, co. Dublin, and his wife, Jane, daughter of Holt Waring of Waringstown, co. Down, the dean of Dromore. His father was a partner in Ball's Bank, Dublin. Major-General Sir Barry Close was his great-uncle, his brother Major George Champagn&eacute; Close served in the Abyssinian expedition of 1868, and another brother, Captain Arthur Richard Close, was killed in 1865 during the New Zealand wars.<br>
<br>After education by private tutor and at a school in Weymouth, Dorset, Close entered Trinity College, Dublin, in June 1840; he received his BA in 1846, the divinity testimonium in 1847, and his MA in 1867. In 1847 he took holy orders and he was ordained priest in the Church of England the following year. He served as curate of All Saints, Northampton, from 1847 to 1849, and as rector of Shangton, in Leicestershire, from 1849 to 1857, but he resigned that living on conscientious grounds because he no longer felt able to hold a benefice obtained through lay patronage. He served as curate of Waltham on the Wolds, Leicestershire, from 1857 to 1861, but, as his father had recently died, he returned to Dublin in 1861 to live the life of a gentleman scholar, although he occasionally performed clerical duties. He is not known to have been married.<br>
<br>Close devoted himself to the affairs of such bodies as the Royal Dublin Society (he long served on the council), the Royal Geological Society of Ireland (president between 1877 and 1879), the Fortnightly Club (council member), and the Royal Irish Academy. He was elected a member of the academy on 13 May 1867 and served as its treasurer from 30 November 1878 until 16 March 1903. It was generally understood that had he not been afflicted by increasing deafness, he would have been elected to the academy's presidency.<br>
<br>Close contributed to astronomy, Pleistocene geology, mathematics, physics, and the study of the Irish language. The results of his acute geological field investigations were incorporated in three important papers read to the Royal Geological Society of Ireland between May 1864 and May 1870, and in an essay on the glaciation of Iar-Connaught written in collaboration with George Henry Kinahan and published in 1872. His studies demonstrated that Ireland had formerly been covered by an ice-cap centred over co. Fermanagh, that local glaciers had once existed in the Irish uplands, and that many lake-basins in co. Kerry were ice-excavated.<br>
<br>A gentle, genial, modest, and retiring man, Close published a work on physics (1884, 2nd edn, 1886) and another on astronomy (1894) under the pseudonyms of John O'Toole and Claudius Kennedy respectively, in order to divert attention away from himself. He died on 12 September 1903 in the bachelor apartments which had long been his at a hotel at 38 Lower Baggot Street, Dublin, and was buried in Dean's Grange cemetery. His keen interest in the Irish language is reflected in his will where he left &pound;1000 towards the printing cost of an Irish-language dictionary to be published by the Royal Irish Academy.<br>
