<span class="headword">Baillie,  John</span>  (1886&#150;1960), <span class="occ">theologian and Church of Scotland minister</span>, was born on 26 March 1886 in the Free Church manse at Gairloch, Scotland, the eldest of the three sons of John Baillie (1829&#150;1891), Free Church of Scotland minister, and his wife, Annie Macpherson (1853&#150;1932). John and his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/41014/', "Donald Baillie (1887&#150;1954)")</script> were among the distinguished Scottish theologians of the modern era. Although Baillie later recalled &#145;a rigorously Calvinistic upbringing&#146;, mainly by his mother, who was soon widowed, there were also liberal strands in Free Church culture and a huge respect for learning, which drove the brothers through brilliant academic careers at Inverness Royal Academy (where John studied between 1898 and 1904) and at the University of Edinburgh, both graduating with firsts in philosophy and distinction in divinity. Baillie spent the summer terms of 1909 and 1911 at the universities of Jena and Marburg, respectively. For a short time assistants in the philosophy department, the brothers spent time in the YMCA in France during the First World War.<br>
<br>In April 1919 Baillie married Florence Jewel Fowler and moved to Auburn Theological Seminary in New York state, and was ordained in the Presbyterian church there in 1920. Their only child, Ian Fowler Baillie, was born in 1921. <span class="italic">The Roots of Religion in the Human Soul</span> appeared in 1926 and <span class="italic">The Interpretation of Religion</span> in 1929. These books reflected wide cultural and theological experience from the manse in Gairloch to American society&#151;the latter's poetry and politics, the polarization of church politics in the fundamentalist debate, as well as participation in conferences on the social gospel in the early 1920s. Baillie moved in 1927 to Emmanuel College, Toronto, in the newly formed United Church of Canada. His wife was suffering from tuberculosis during much of the 1920s, and was in sanatoria between 1923 and 1930. In 1930 he moved back to the Union Theological Seminary in New York, then arguably the world's greatest theological seminary. It provided a forum for theology where, along with Henry Sloane Coffin, Reinhold Niebuhr, and Pitney Van Dusen, he was to have a major impact on Western theology for the next two decades. Though Baillie returned to Edinburgh in 1934, the four exerted huge influence on the new World Council of Churches. They agreed on a <i>via media</i> between extreme liberalism on the one hand, and a narrow Barthianism on the other. Baillie was professor of divinity at Edinburgh University from 1934 to 1956. He also served as principal of New College, Edinburgh, and dean of the faculty of divinity (1950&#150;56). A royal chaplain between 1947 and 1956, he was an extra chaplain to the queen in Scotland from 1956 to 1960.<br>
<br>The theme of the presence of God to faith was central to the three books that followed Baillie's first publications, <span class="italic">And the Life Everlasting</span> (1933), <span class="italic">Our Knowledge of God</span> (1939), and <span class="italic">Invitation to Pilgrimage</span> (1942). An emphasis on spirituality was manifested in <span class="italic">A Diary of Private Prayer</span> (1936), which sold tens of thousands of copies, a devotional work combining honest self-examination with concentration on God's reconciling grace. A wider social and political concern was demonstrated, during his moderatorial year in the Church of Scotland in 1943, with the preparation for the general assembly of the report of the special commission for the interpretation of God's will in the present crisis. The report, published in 1946 as <span class="italic">God's Will for Church and Nation</span>, combined critique of the Nazis with a programme for social reconstruction after the war, a programme echoed in the Beveridge reports. The report recognized the difficulty in applying Christian principles in society, and took the route of &#145;middle axioms&#146;, which should &#145;exhibit the relevance of the ruling principles to the particular field of action in which guidance is needed&#146;  (p. 45). It argued that &#145;Economic power must be made objectively responsible to the community as a whole&#146;  (ibid., 156). The report reflected awareness of the German church struggle, numerous Church of England and ecumenical gatherings, and also the work of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/67745', "Moot")</script>, an influential forum that met in Oxford and London. As well as J. H. Oldham, its founder, participants included such influential writers and theologians as Eric Fenn, H. A. Hodges, Karl Mannheim, Walter Moberly and Alec Vidler, T. S. Eliot, H. H. Farmer, Donald Mackinnon, and John Middleton Murry. In 1952 Baillie became one of the presidents of the World Council of Churches.<br>
<br>Baillie's death precluded the delivery of his Gifford lectures, but they were published posthumously as <span class="italic">The Sense of the Presence of God</span> (1962). They provided a masterly synthesis of his life's work. In them he displayed a characteristic combination of an appeal to experience with an exploration of rational grounds for belief in God. Knowledge seems to imply certitude, he argued, but often does not go beyond probabilities. Our knowledge of the realities is primary, and our knowledge of truths concerning them secondary. Moral convictions are central to human life, and &#145;Our total experience of reality presents itself to us as a single experience&#146;  (p. 50). Baillie also discussed procedures for verification and falsification, and argued that &#145;A faith that is consistent with everything possible is not a faith in anything actual&#146;  (ibid., 71), stressing that the ultimate refutation of doubts was theological and incarnational. Faith was &#145;an awareness of the divine presence itself, however hidden behind the veils of sense&#146;  (ibid., 89). Baillie argued that &#145;In the widest sense of the term all language may be said to be symbolic&#146;  (ibid., 113); but admitted that not all theological statements were analogical. Despite being known in, with, and under other realities, there is a certain directness in apprehension of God. Love of God is always related to love of neighbour, and beyond this to a new humanity. Baillie thought that it was important not to confuse dogmas with the primary perceptions of faith, and also raised the wider issue of &#145;Faith and the Faiths&#146;. What does it mean to speak of salvation in a name? he asked. While there was an awareness of God in &#145;the pagan religions&#146;, the way of Christ was decisive. In Baillie's view, scientific and religious accounts of the world complemented one another. What others may see as coincidence, Christians will read as providential. Furthermore, gratitude was &#145;not only the dominant note of Christian piety, but equally the dominant motive of Christian action in the world&#146;  (ibid., 236). Propositions were necessary but not sufficient, as faith depended on trust. We have to do with &#145;a God whose living and active presence among us can be perceived by faith in a large variety of human contexts and situations&#146;  (ibid., 61).<br>
<br>Baillie's theology, like that of his brother, remained resolutely liberal and evangelical. Sympathetic critics of each other's work and sensitive to theology in context, they could deploy arguments from various theological traditions when this seemed right. They deplored exclusivism and dogmatic narrowness. Baillie's &#145;strongly independent mind made him resistant to passing fashions, while his irenic spirit preferred to discover underlying unities rather than sharpen distinctions into conflicts&#146;  (<span class="italic">DSCHT</span>, 50). He has been characterized as steering a middle course between American fundamentalists and modernists. A Companion of Honour from 1957, Baillie received numerous honorary doctorates, and at his death was widely regarded as the doyen of Scottish theologians. He died on 29 September 1960 at 9 Whitehouse Terrace, Edinburgh, and was buried in the city. He was survived by his wife.<br>
