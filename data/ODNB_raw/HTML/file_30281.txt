<span class="headword">Young,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1587&#150;1655), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and college head</span>, was probably born in Luncarty, Perthshire, about 1587, if the age at death recorded on his memorial at Stowmarket is accurate. He was the son of William Young (<i>d</i>. 1625), who served as minister of several parishes in Perthshire (Pitcairne, Auchtergaven, and Redgorton as well as Luncarty), and his wife, Janet Glas. He had a sister, Janet, who later married John Crookshanks, eventually William Young's successor at Luncarty. Thomas attended the grammar school at Perth before matriculating at St Leonard's College, St Andrews, in 1602. He graduated MA in July 1606, one of eighteen students designated in the college registers as being of the poorer class. That year his father, a vocal presbyterian, opposed the introduction into Scotland of a powerful episcopate backed by the crown.<br>
<br>During the next seven years Young may have pursued ministerial training on the continent before moving to London. Comments in Thomas Gataker's <span class="italic">Londinatis cinnus, sive, Adversaria miscellanea</span> (1651) and Simeon Ashe's <span class="italic">Gray Hayres Crowned with Grace</span> (1655) indicate that Young lived with and worked as assistant to Gataker at Rotherhithe, Surrey, some time after the latter became rector there in 1611. But Young apparently also maintained ties with Scotland. In 1614 he was appointed to the vicarage of Resolis in Ross, a living he held until 1649, largely as a non-resident. Two other records connect him to the parish (he witnessed charters for the bishop of Ross in 1618 and 1635) and confirm that Young became a pluralist early in his ministerial career; he remained one until the last years of his life. Over the next four decades he can be found on several occasions travelling between England and Scotland, presumably to fulfil responsibilities in each location.<br>
<br>In either 1617 or 1618 Young became the tutor of the future poet John Milton, probably because Gataker recommended him to his good friend Richard Stock, the Milton family's rector at All Hallows, Bread Street. Details concerning the actual arrangement are ambiguous (it is unclear where the instruction took place) and further compounded by evidence linking Young during this time to Rotherhithe and parishes in Essex and Hertfordshire (Ware). Some time before April 1620 Young's instruction of Milton ended with his appointment as chaplain to the English Merchant Adventurers in Hamburg. Parish registers record his presence there from this month, together with his wife, Rebecca, whom he had married at an unknown date, and about whom little is known.<br>
<br>It is not clear whether Young's departure from England was for religious, economic or other reasons. However his eight-year ministry in Hamburg was successful and he referred to it in his writings with fondness. On 24 March 1621 Joseph Mead wrote to Sir Martin Stuteville that Young was invited to preach in front of Frederick V, the exiled king of Bohemia, and had received a chain of gold for his efforts. Perhaps mindful that he would eventually have to return to England, Young maintained relations with notable individuals like Mead and the royal librarian Patrick Young by writing letters and making periodic visits to London and Cambridge. Two letters and a verse epistle, <span class="italic">Elegia quarta</span>, from his former pupil testify to the affection and respect Milton and Young continued to have for each other through the 1620s. Milton praised his tutor as &#145;a pastor illustrious for his honor of the primitive faith and well instructed how to feed the sheep that love Christ&#146;; this was a man under whose guidance Milton &#145;first visited the Aonian retreats and the sacred lawns of the twin-peaked mountains&#146;  (<span class="italic">Elegia quarta</span>, ed. M. Hughes, 1957, 26&#150;7). Their mutual regard is also illustrated by their exchange of presents: a Hebrew <span class="roman">Bible</span> (now lost) to Milton; a copy of Thomas Cranmer's <span class="italic">Reformatio legum ecclesiasticarum</span> to Young.<br>
<br>On 27 March 1628 Young returned to England and was instituted to the living of St Peter and St Mary, Stowmarket, Suffolk. This parish was his permanent home for the rest of his life, although he lived elsewhere for extended periods of time. For the next seven years (1628&#150;35) he remained largely in residence, as evidenced by his signature of the parish vestry accounts and his participation in the combination lecture at Mendlesham. However, from 1638 his signature ceased and the church controversies resulting from the reform policies of Archbishop William Laud increasingly took Young to London. By 1635 he had begun work on his principal work, <span class="italic">Dies dominica</span>, a sabbatarian apology and effective attack on the <span class="roman">Book of Sports</span>, published anonymously in 1639. By 1640 he was meeting with puritan clergy and may have joined William Spurstowe and others in the gatherings which met at the house of Edmund Calamy, minister of St Mary Aldermanbury. Following the publication by Bishop Joseph Hall of <span class="italic">Episcopacie by Divine Right</span> (1640) and <span class="italic">An Humble Remonstrance to the High Court of Parliament</span> (1641) Young, with Spurstowe, Calamy, Stephen Marshall, and Matthew Newcomen, writing under the name <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94600', "Smectymnuus")</script>, launched an attack on &#145;the prelaticall church&#146;. In <span class="italic">An Answer to &hellip; an Humble Remonstrance</span> (1641) the group, apparently led by Young, argued for the parity of bishops and presbyters in scripture and for the antiquity of church government by ruling elders rather than bishops. When Hall defended his position, they replied with <span class="italic">A Vindication of the Answer</span> (1641). Their cause was supported by Milton who contributed five anti-prelatical tracts of his own in 1641 and 1642, the most overtly supportive entitled <span class="italic">An Apology for Smectymnuus</span>. While the exchange contained much reasoned argument, it was also characterized by some strong and abusive language which, together with the distinctive acronym, ensured that the episode remained fresh in the popular mind for some time afterwards. In 1647 the poet John Cleveland poked fun in the verse &#145;Smectymnuus, or, The clus divines&#146;, while <span class="italic">Smectymnuus redivivus</span>, stating the ministers' own case, was reissued as late as 1680.<br>
<br>The outbreak of the civil war kept Young in London. In 1643 the earl of Manchester appointed him to the parish of St James's, Duke's Place, and during the same year he was nominated to represent Suffolk in the Westminster assembly of divines. Young was among the more active members, arguing the presbyterian position from the outset, and was among those deputed to negotiate with the Scottish commissioners. He also signed the anti-Independent, anti-sectarian pamphlet <span class="italic">Certain Considerations</span> (1643). In February 1644 he delivered a fast-day sermon to parliament, published as <span class="italic">Hope's Encouragement</span> (1644). While remaining active in the assembly until its regular sessions petered out in 1648, on 12 April 1644 Young was installed as master of Jesus College, Cambridge. Here he did not hesitate to use his position to secure appointments for his sons Thomas, Roger, and Henry. He proceeded DD in 1649, but, suspected of writing a remonstrance against the engagement, and refusing to take it, he was ejected from Jesus College on 1 January 1651. He returned to Stowmarket where his wife was buried that April. His signature on the vestry accounts resumed in 1652, although his activities from that point remain unclear. He died at Stowmarket on 28 November 1655, and was buried in the parish church on 1 December; Simeon Ashe's funeral sermon was published as <span class="italic">Gray Hayres Crowned with Grace</span> (1655). In his will, drawn up on 27 September 1653 and proved on 31 January 1656, Young left to his son and executor Roger land in Suffolk, which had been placed in the hands of trustees, Francis Bacon of Ipswich, John Hale of Mildenhall, Anthony Bedingfield of London, and John Haynard of Stowmarket. Other beneficiaries included his son Henry, his grandchildren Elizabeth and John Torell, and the poor of Stowmarket.<br>
