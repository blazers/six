<span class="headword">Bolts,  William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Willem Bolst]</span>  (1739&#150;1808), <span class="occ">merchant and speculator</span>, was born on 7 February 1739 on the continent, probably in Germany. However, as a child he lived in Britain, and he became an apprentice in a London merchant house. He was acting in a commercial capacity in Lisbon by the time of the great earthquake of 1755 which devastated that city.<br>
<br>Following his return to Britain, Bolts was appointed as a factor in the service of the East India Company in November 1759 and he arrived in Bengal the following summer. By acquiring a working knowledge of Bengali, and by drawing on his previous experience as a merchant, he was able to develop his own private trading activities while working for the company, and he soon entered into a partnership with two members of the council at Fort William (Calcutta), John Johnstone and William Hay. The partners engaged in a wide range of speculative activities, the nature of which drew them into conflict with both the company and the Indian authorities. Bolts acquired a reputation as an unscrupulous and untrustworthy figure and he was repeatedly censured by the company for his misconduct.<br>
<br>Bolts married Ann Aston (<i>d</i>. 1821) in Calcutta on 11 February 1764. In 1765 he was recalled to Fort William from Benares, where he was then serving as second in council, but events were then given a remarkable twist when he was appointed as alderman of the mayor's court of Calcutta in August 1766. Further disputes with the company, however, led to his resignation three months later. Bolts was ordered to return to Britain by the next available ship, but he repeatedly delayed his departure from Bengal in order that he could seek further to extend his business interests in the region. This brought him into conflict with the new governor of Bengal, Harry Verelst, who was making a vigorous effort to implement the company's policy of curbing private trade in the territories under its control. Bolts's position was further undermined by the fact that he was suspected of intriguing with the Dutch and French, and after many warnings he was arrested on 23 September 1768, and deported to Britain a week later.<br>
<br>On reaching Britain in April 1769 he at once appealed to the court of directors, who would have nothing to do with him and declared him a &#145;very unprofitable and unworthy servant&#146;, and in 1771 commenced a lawsuit against him. In 1772 he published the first volume of his <span class="italic">Considerations on India Affairs</span>, in which he attacked the whole system of British government in Bengal, and complained of the arbitrary power exercised by the authorities, and of his own deportation by Verelst. The volume caused some excitement and was at once answered by Verelst himself in <span class="italic">A View of the Rise, Progress, and Present State of the English Government in Bengal</span> (1772), which Bolts attacked in a second volume of <span class="italic">Considerations</span> in 1775. This vigorous exchange of views developed into a bitter controversy and played an important part in fuelling the extensive public debate that was taking place on the subject of the East India Company's operations in India.<br>
<br>Bolts's lawsuits with the company and the cost of publishing his books bankrupted him in the autumn of 1773 for, owing to his deportation, he had not been able to realize more than &pound;30,000 out of the fortune of &pound;90,000 which he had accumulated in India.<br>
<br>Thus, following a visit to Vienna in 1775, he was glad to accept an offer from the empress Maria Theresa to enter the Austrian service. He was made a lieutenant-colonel and sent out to India to establish factories for the Imperial East India Company of Trieste. After arriving in Surat in September 1777 as commander of the <i>Joseph and Theresa</i>, he founded a number of factories, including three on the Malabar coast, much to the annoyance of the British. He was well on the way towards making another personal fortune when the project failed because of poor relations with his partners in Antwerp. The Imperial Company went bankrupt in 1784 and Bolts then unsuccessfully floated ambitious trading schemes with the French and Swedish governments. He lived in France during the 1790s, returned briefly to Britain in 1800&#150;01, and then established himself in Lisbon once more. Finally, he moved to Paris in 1808 where, a ruined man, he died in hospital later the same year.<br>
