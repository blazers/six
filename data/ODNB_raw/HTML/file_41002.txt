<span class="headword">Foote,  George William</span>  (1850&#150;1915), <span class="occ">radical journalist and secularist</span>, was born at 2 How Street Cottages, Plymouth, on 11 January 1850, the son of William Thomas Foot, customs officer, who died when he was about four. He was brought up an Anglican by his mother, Ann Foot, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Winzar, but joined the Unitarians when he was fifteen. In January 1868 he went to London to work in a West End library, and was soon involved in radical freethought, starting both the secular Sunday school and the Young Men's Secular Association at the Old Street Hall of Science in 1869, and contributing to Charles Bradlaugh's <span class="italic">National Reformer</span> from 1870. He also served as secretary of the London Republican Club (1870) and National Republican League (1871). In 1876 he opposed Bradlaugh's domination of the secularist movement, starting his own paper, the <span class="italic">Secularist</span>, and the following year, with G. J. Holyoake and Charles Watts, formed the British Secular Union as an anti-Bradlaughite organization.<br>
<br>Bradlaugh's exclusion from the House of Commons in 1880 brought an indignant Foote back to mainstream secularism. Abandoning his hitherto mild and literary approach to freethought, in May 1881 he started the monthly <span class="italic">Freethinker</span> (weekly from September), in which he attacked Christianity with barbed wit and a series of infamous cartoons for which he was twice prosecuted for blasphemy. Tried at the Old Bailey before Mr Justice North in March 1883, he received a year in Holloway prison, but on an earlier charge subsequently heard before Lord Chief Justice Coleridge at queen's bench the jury was divided. Coleridge's liberal summing up, that there was a distinction between the manner and the substance of an alleged blasphemy, remained the basis of the blasphemy law in England until 1979.<br>
<br>As Bradlaugh became increasingly involved in parliamentary affairs, Foote emerged as the principal organizer of secularism at a time when the movement was declining in popularity. He founded the London Secular Federation in 1888 and succeeded Bradlaugh as president of the National Secular Society in 1890. As a leading member of the Metropolitan Radical Federation (founded 1886) Foote was primarily an individualistic champion of free expression, opposed to socialism and increasingly disillusioned with democratic mediocrity. In 1887 he debated the question &#145;Is socialism sound?&#146; with Annie Besant at the Old Street Hall of Science. In the long run his defence of liberalism alienated many former supporters who were attracted to socialism, and he faced increasing criticisms for his failure to recreate the success which secularism had enjoyed under Bradlaugh. With declining support came financial difficulties, quarrels with other leaders, and a period of bankruptcy from 1901 until 1905. He nevertheless was largely responsible for the survival of secularist radicalism into the twentieth century.<br>
<br>Foote ran his own publishing business from 1882 under various titles, latterly the Pioneer Press, and edited the <span class="italic">Freethinker</span> until his death, as well as the more ephemeral <span class="italic">Secularist</span> (1876), <span class="italic">Liberal</span> (1879), <span class="italic">Progress</span> (1883&#150;7), <span class="italic">Radical Leader</span> (1888), and <span class="italic">Pioneer</span> (1903&#150;4). He wrote over eighty publications, mostly pamphlets of a polemical nature. Some of his best writing came in the form of weekly editorial essays in the <span class="italic">Freethinker</span>, published as <span class="italic">Flowers of Freethought</span> (1893&#150;4). His ambitions beyond religious controversialism remained literary, and behind the public image was a cultured scholar with a wide knowledge of English literature, a devotee of Shakespeare, and a friend and admirer of George Meredith.<br>
<br>Foote's first marriage, to Henriette Mariane (<i>b</i>. 1850/51), daughter of Adolph Heimann, a professor of German, on 20 March 1877, ended with her death in October of the same year. His second wife, Rosalia Martha (<i>b</i>. 1862/3), daughter of Leopold Angel, a silversmith, supported his work but remained in the background. They were married on 12 April 1884, and had four children: a son, Francis, and three daughters, Helen, Florence, and Dorothy. In later years Foote suffered from bronchitis, which led the family to move out of London to Westcliff-on-Sea in 1903. He died at his home there, 39 Meteor Road, on 17 October 1915 and was cremated at the City of London crematorium, Ilford, on 21 October.<br>
