<span class="headword">Linde,  Andreas <span class="st"> [Andrew]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> 1759), <span class="occ">bookseller and bookbinder</span>, may have come originally from Saxony in north-eastern Germany. He was present in London from no later than January 1743, as he married Ursula Smith at St Giles, Cripplegate, on the 22nd of that month. He appears to have set up shop as a bookseller, bookbinder and stationer &#145;at the Bible in Katherine-Street in the Strand&#146;  (advertisement, <span class="italic">Daily Advertiser</span>, 26 Dec 1750) during 1749. An early engraved trade card describes him as &#145;Andrew Linde, book-binder, to His Royal Highness Prince George&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., John Johnson collection, trade cards) and a number of bindings by him for George III as prince of Wales are found on books in the King's Library at the British Library, including a copy of Johann Haberkorn's German psalter printed in London in 1751, which Linde also sold  (BL, 218.d.3). Linde's recorded bookbindings are not highly regarded&#151;they have been described as &#145;undeniably hideous&#146;  (Nixon, 160)&#151;and his description of himself as a bookbinder was dropped from imprints after 1753 in favour of &#145;bookseller and stationer&#146;, a formula he also used in his will. Although he frequently implied royal patronage in his imprints, for example styling himself &#145;stationer to His Majesty and to His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, and bookseller to Her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales&#146; in the <span class="italic">Bibliotheca curiosa, being a catalogue of the libraries of Messrs. Jager and Brande, apothecaries to his majesty, both deceased</span> (1753), there seems to be no evidence of any formal association with the court.<br>
<br>Most of Linde's earliest appearances in imprints were associated with German-language books printed in London by Johann Christoph Haberkorn and Johann Nicodemus Gussen. During 1753 and 1754, however, his imprint also became associated with English titles written in opposition to Count Nicholas Ludwig von Zinzendorf and the Moravians at a time when the sect was finding increasing acceptance in England. In particular, Linde issued a number of attacks on Zinzendorf and his followers, written or edited by Heinrich Rimius, typically deriding them as &#145;enthusiasts and fanaticks&#146; (as for example in the full title to <span class="italic">A Pastoral Letter against Fanaticism</span>, 1753). A legacy in his will to Johann Reinhard Pittius, &#145;Minister of the Lutheran Church in the Savoy [&hellip;] as a token of my respect for him&#146;  (will, fol. 268) appears to confirm his attachment to the pietist orthodoxy then prevailing among the German Lutheran clergy in London.<br>
<br>A further collaboration saw Linde's imprint on works and translations by Christlob Mylius, a young German writer who died in London in 1754. One of these was possibly Linde's most celebrated publication, Mylius's highly influential German translation of William Hogarth's <span class="italic">Analysis of Beauty</span>, published in 1754 as <span class="italic">Zergliederung der Sch&ouml;nheit</span> with a dedication by Linde to Augusta, dowager princess of Wales. This is one of two examples of Linde's connection with the bookseller Johann Wilhelm Schmidt in Hanover, one of the earliest direct links between members of the London and German book trades. This link with Hanover was noted at the time by Wilhelm Philipp Best, London agent for the University of G&ouml;ttingen's library, who saw in Linde's bookshop an opportunity to distribute the university's publications in England. The library had purchased a number of items from <span class="italic">Bibliotheca curiosa</span>, which Linde had issued in 1753.<br>
<br>An advertisement attached to <span class="italic">A Supplement to the Candid Narrative of the Rise and Progress of the Herrenhuters</span> (1755) listed some fifteen titles &#145;lately published by A. Linde&#146;. Apart from a number of original works or translations by Mylius, these included five further anti-Moravian titles, a German grammar for English readers, an English grammar for Germans, and German translations by Christoph Mattheus Seidel of <span class="italic">The Pilgrim's Progress</span> and <span class="italic">The Holy War</span> by John Bunyan. Linde had also issued <span class="italic">A Catalogue of Curious and Usefull Books in all Languages and Sciences, the Most of them Lately Imported</span>, to be sold &#145;very cheap&#146;, on 4 December 1754, which showed that the sale of works published under other imprints than his own remained a significant part of Linde's business. A note on the title page (&#145;Catalogues of the German books may be had separate&#146;) demonstrates the prominence of German titles among the imports. Further evidence for Linde's connection with the German trade can be found in his inclusion by Gleditsch among the international purveyors of the Leipzig <span class="italic">Commentarii de rebus in scientia naturali et medicina gestis</span> from 1756 to 1758.<br>
<br>Linde retired from bookselling and sold his stock by auction in November 1758. Although the announcement of the auction (by Longman) stated that he was &#145;going into another way of business&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Catalogue of the Quire-stock and Copies of a Bookseller</span>, 1758), he may well have suffered ill health or been concerned about competition from Christlieb Gottreich Seyffert, a German bookseller who had set up shop in Soho in 1757. Linde died in London, perhaps at his home in Brydges Street, Covent Garden, between 4 November 1759, when he made his will (under the name of John Andrew Linde), and the 19th, the date it was proved. He requested that he be buried in the German Lutheran churchyard at the Savoy. Linde imprints continued to appear into the next decade, at least one being attributable to Linde's widow.<br>
