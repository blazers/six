<span class="headword">Watt,  (John) David Henry</span>  (1932&#150;1987), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born on 9 January 1932 in Edinburgh, the only son and second of three children of the Revd John Hunter Watt and his wife, Helen Garioch, daughter of Reuben Bryce, accountant. His childhood years were spent principally in Kent, where his father was vicar of Boxley, near Maidstone. He was educated at Marlborough College and did two years' national service with the Royal Artillery (partly in the canal zone and after that on secondment to the Mauritian guard). He then went up to Hertford College, Oxford, with a classics scholarship in 1951. He obtained second-class honours in both classical honour moderations and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1953 and 1956). He had only just taken moderations when his university career was interrupted by his falling victim to poliomyelitis. The effects were to stay with him all his life, bringing a slightly lopsided look to his previously tall, erect figure, with his left arm hanging limply by his side. He was seldom without pain, which he bore with remarkable stoicism. He continued to experience breathing difficulties, which involved in later years the regular use of a portable respirator. Nevertheless, the illness forged and shaped his whole character, transforming a conventional, public school, games-playing product into the acerbic possessor of one of the shrewdest minds and sharpest pens in British political journalism.<br>
<br>Polio also gave Watt his start as a writer. His first published article was called simply &#145;Last gasp&#146; and appeared in <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> of 14 October 1955, when he had just ceased undergoing treatment in an iron lung. It was a detached description of what it felt like to live, as he put it, in &#145;a long box, monstrous and coffin-like, with bellows attached&#146;. As a piece of spare, cool prose, it sufficiently impressed <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>'s editor, Ian Gilmour, for Watt to be offered a job when, a year later, he left Oxford. He spent two years (1956&#150;7) with <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, ostensibly as the paper's drama critic, but in reality as the office dogsbody. In 1958 he moved to <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span> as its London-based diplomatic correspondent, and from there was tempted in 1960 to join a revamped <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span> as its Common Market correspondent. A year later the <span class="italic">Herald</span> passed into the ownership of the International Publishing Corporation, and Watt did not, under the new proprietorship, linger long. Instead he went back to <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, this time in the rather grander capacity of political correspondent (1962&#150;3).<br>
<br>It was his second coming at <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> that marked Watt's real arrival as an influential journalist. After a brief flowering with Henry Fairlie&#151;and a rather longer one with Bernard Levin&#151;<span class="italic">The Spectator</span>'s political commentary had become spasmodic and patchy. In less than a year and a half Watt provided it with consistency, coherence, wit, and intelligence. It was no surprise when, towards the end of 1963, the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> snapped him up to be its correspondent in Washington.<br>
<br>Although without any economic training, Watt soon vindicated his selection and became, in the words of the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span>'s own official history, &#145;the pick of the [paper's] foreign correspondents&#146;. Starting from scratch, he rapidly built up an impressive network of sources, prompting the International Monetary Fund once to complain that it had to read a London newspaper to discover what was going into its own minutes. But Watt was equally penetrating in covering American politics and by 1967 had returned to London&#151;and to the important appointment as political editor of the paper. The next ten years, in which his Friday column came to be recognized as the best-informed example of &#145;insider&#146; journalism in Britain, probably represented the high point of Watt's influence over public affairs.<br>
<br>In 1968 Watt married Susanne, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38754/', "Frank (Fritz) Adolf Burchardt")</script>, statistician and fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford; they had four sons. By 1977, having been disappointed in his bids for two editorships (for <span class="italic">The Economist</span> in 1974 and <span class="italic">The Observer</span> in 1975), Watt had become bored. He had grown tired, as he characteristically phrased it, of &#145;turning the prayer wheel&#146;. So, when the offer came in 1978 to take over from Andrew Shonfield as director of the Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House), he accepted it. He was afterwards to regret doing so. Cut off from its Foreign Office subvention, Chatham House was going through a difficult phase and its new director had little appetite for fund-raising. It was with some relief that he laid down his burden at the end of his five-year term.<br>
<br>While at Chatham House, Watt had already put a toe back into journalism, writing a weekly column in <span class="italic">The Times</span> from 1981 until his death. He was a visiting fellow of All Souls, Oxford, in 1972&#150;3 and was a research fellow there in 1981&#150;3, appointments which gave him great pleasure, as did his joint editorship of the <span class="italic">Political Quarterly</span> from 1979 to 1985. He was once described as having &#145;a clergy-boned face&#146;, and it was typical of this aspect of his personality that he should have served on the board of visitors of Wandsworth prison for five years (1977&#150;81). In the last period of his life he also became a highly valued political consultant to the multinational company Rio Tinto Zinc, which, a year after his death, established in his memory a prize for journalism. Watt died on 27 March 1987 at his country cottage in Lewknor, near Oxford, after, on a stormy night, picking up an electric cable that turned out to be live. He was instantly electrocuted.<br>
