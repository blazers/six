<span class="headword">Marshall, Sir  James</span>  (1829&#150;1889), <span class="occ">colonial judge</span>, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18138/', "James Marshall (1796&#150;1855)")</script>, vicar of Christ Church, Clifton, Bristol, and his wife, Catherine Mary Richmond, was born at Edinburgh on 19 December 1829. The loss of his right arm through a gun accident prevented his joining the army, and, after graduating from Exeter College, Oxford, in 1854 he took holy orders almost immediately, and for two years held a curacy. In November 1857 he joined the Roman Catholic church, and as his physical handicap debarred him from being a priest he became procurator and precentor in the church at Bayswater, London. Later he was for a time a private tutor, and in 1861 he became classical master at Birmingham Oratory School, where he became a friend of Cardinal Newman. In 1866 he was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn. He joined the northern circuit, and eventually settled in Manchester.<br>
<br>In May 1873 Marshall was appointed chief magistrate of the Gold Coast and assessor to the native chiefs. When the Second Anglo-Asante War broke out in 1873, he negotiated the agreement of the chiefs to the recruiting of their people, and was of great use throughout the campaign in raising levies. He received the special thanks of the secretary of state, and later the Ashanti medal. In 1875 he was stationed at Lagos, and in November 1876 he was promoted to be senior puisne judge of the supreme court of the Gold Coast. In October 1877 he married Alice, the daughter of C. Guillym Young of Corby, Lincolnshire. In 1879 he became chief justice, and on his retirement in 1882 he was knighted. In 1886 he was executive commissioner for the west African colonies at the Indian and Colonial Exhibition and was created CMG. The following year he once more went abroad to Africa for a few months, as chief justice of the territories of the Royal Niger Company. He died at Margate on 9 August 1889.<br>
