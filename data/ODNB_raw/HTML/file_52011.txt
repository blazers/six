<span class="headword">Russell,  Edward Richard</span>, first Baron Russell of Liverpool  (1834&#150;1920), <span class="occ">newspaper editor and proprietor</span>, born on 9 August 1834 at the Barbican, London, was the son of Edward Haslingden Russell (1809&#150;1851) and Mary Anne Crook (<i>d</i>. 1851). He received an elementary education to the age of fourteen, and thereafter taught himself. Orphaned at sixteen, he was already so well launched upon a career in journalism that he was soon appointed editor of the <span class="italic">Islington Gazette</span>. However, Russell's unwonted enthusiasm for radical politics led to the newspaper being successfully sued for libel and him consequently forfeiting his job. This proved a temporary set-back for, in 1860, at the precociously early age of twenty-six, Russell accepted the invitation of the owner, Michael Whitty, to become assistant editor of the <span class="italic">Liverpool Daily Post</span>. He stayed six years, but resigned when refused a limited partnership by Whitty. For the next four years he freelanced in London, and was deputy editor and chief leader writer for Justin McCarthy's <span class="italic">Morning Star</span>. The intelligence, shrewdness, and judgement he demonstrated in his political commentaries won glowing tributes from the leaders of the Liberal Party. Early in the 1860s, in an obscure magazine, <span class="italic">Every Month</span>, Russell became the first to canvass the name of W. E. Gladstone as the future Liberal leader.<br>
<br>In 1869 Russell returned to Liverpool as editor of the <span class="italic">Daily Post</span>. Shortly after Whitty's death in 1873, with A. G. Jeans, Russell became the newspaper's co-proprietor. In 1879 the two men started a complementary evening newspaper, the <span class="italic">Liverpool Echo</span>. In 1905 the <span class="italic">Liverpool Daily Post</span> merged with the <span class="italic">Daily Mercury</span>, and continued to flourish throughout the half century that Russell was its editor. A Liberal newspaper in a tory stronghold, the <span class="italic">Post</span> owed much of its distinction and popularity to Russell's writing. He was a perspicacious literary and theatre critic. His parliamentary reporting demonstrated an intimate knowledge of Westminster. He explained complex and divisive issues to his readers with a felicity and sureness of touch. His writing, like his public speaking, was informed, fluent, sensible, and convincing rather than brilliant.<br>
<br>An advanced Liberal, Russell early espoused home rule and profoundly admired Gladstone. Ireland's political future sundered relations between Joseph Chamberlain and Russell. The ambitious politician had assiduously cultivated the editor as an important ally in the provincial press who could explain and help popularize his new policies, a process that culminated with the publication of Chamberlain's so-called &#145;unauthorized&#146; programme in 1885. Russell nurtured parliamentary ambitions himself. The <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> (3 July 1885) asserted that it was infinitely more important for Russell to be an editor than an MP. Nevertheless, Russell stood and was elected as Liberal member for the Bridgeton division of Glasgow in November 1885. He was successfully re-elected as a Gladstonian Liberal in July 1886, but took the Chiltern Hundreds the following year, possibly because of pressure of work. He had not been long enough in the house to make a reputation, but his best, most persuasive speeches were on home rule, making plain his disappointment at Chamberlain's &#145;betrayal&#146;.<br>
<br>Russell remained an important figure in Liberal politics, and an influential friend to successive Liberal leaders. In local affairs he enjoyed an enormous personal following that breached conventional party political loyalties. Never was this better demonstrated than in 1905 when he was carried upon the shoulders of a cheering throng from St George's Hall where he had won a famous victory at the assizes. He had been charged with criminal libel for asserting that certain tory licensing justices were too friendly to the drink trade.<br>
<br>Russell took a prominent part in Liverpool's educational and cultural life as president of the city's Literary and Philosophical Society and a life member of the university's court. A great theatre enthusiast, he was a founder of the Liverpool Repertory and remained a director until 1917.<br>
<br>Russell married twice. His first marriage was on 16 December 1858 to Eliza Sophia, daughter of Stephen Bradley of Bridge, Kent. They had two sons. Eliza died on 22 January 1901. On 30 April 1902 Russell married Jean Stewart (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Macdonald), widow of Joseph M'Farlane. Russell was fearless and uncompromising in public life, but at home in his later years was somewhat cowed by his dour second wife, who died in 1927.<br>
<br>In 1893 Russell was knighted. Somewhat paradoxically, as a radical Liberal who had long considered the hereditary principle in the House of Lords doomed, he accepted a barony in 1919. Ironically the king twice opposed Russell's elevation as too great a step for a &#145;mere knight bachelor&#146; and because of his great age. The creation was approved, reluctantly, only because Lloyd George insisted. Russell had eagerly anticipated renewing his parliamentary career, interrupted in 1887, but he died on 20 February 1920 at his home, The Gables, at 5 Croxteth Road, Toxteth Park, Liverpool. He was buried on 23 February at Childwall.<br>
<br>Born to neither wealth nor privilege, in a long life Russell, by his intelligence and industry, gained both fame and fortune. He was always content to remain in the background &#145;pulling the strings that made others dance his tune&#146;  (<span class="italic">Liverpool Post</span>, 21 Feb 1920). The doyen of provincial newspaper editors, Russell was blessed with &#145;the sweetest disposition, a generous nature and an even temperament&#146;. To the end of his very long life, an admiring colleague, Sir Henry Lucy, observed, &#145;like Peter Pan, he never seemed to grow old&#146;  (Russell, 65&#150;6).<br>
