<span class="headword">Ruthven raiders</span>  (<em>act. </em>1581&#150;1585), <span class="occ">political faction</span>, arose following the replacement of the government of James Douglas, fourth earl of Morton, by one headed by two of his leading opponents, James Stewart, earl of Arran, and Esm&eacute; Stewart, duke of Lennox. None the less, as a result of an amalgam of religious, political, and personal factors, the Arran&#150;Lennox government quickly found itself under extreme pressure. Hence the Ruthven raid on 23 August 1582, when James VI was seized by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24375/', "William Ruthven, first earl of Gowrie")</script>, and the other raiders. These consisted principally of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7868/', "Archibald Douglas, eighth earl of Angus")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16712/', "Patrick Lindsay, sixth Lord Lindsay of the Byres")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17286/', "Thomas Lyon, master of Glamis")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8867/', "John Erskine, eighteenth or second earl of Mar")</script>. The raiders remained in control of the country for the next ten months, during which time the king was under house arrest in Ruthven Castle, Arran was imprisoned at Stirling, and Lennox departed for France, where he died in May 1583.<br>
<br>The coup was in part inspired by growing concern among the members of the kirk at the religious policy of the Arran&#150;Lennox regime. Here there had been, for example, little progress in a scheme devised by the general assembly for the erection of presbyteries, while a new archbishop of Glasgow, Robert Montgomerie, had been appointed in controversial circumstances. This upset not only the church but also those among the raiders with strongly protestant feelings. In this category could be included Angus, Lindsay, and to some extent Mar, as well as some others such as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74471/', "James Cunningham, sixth earl of Glencairn")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54161/', "Cunningham family")</script>], and Sir William Douglas of Lochleven. A further complication was the long-standing political rivalry between the Stewarts and the Douglases. Morton's downfall had resulted in many of his followers, notably Angus, being forfeited. Significantly, one of James VI's first actions while under the control of the raiders was to pardon Angus and various other members of the Douglas family.<br>
<br>Finally, some of the raiders had strong personal reasons for becoming involved. Thus Ruthven, despite his elevation to the earldom of Gowrie in August 1581, was apparently seriously aggrieved about certain substantial sums of money that the crown owed him from the time he served as treasurer in the Morton and Arran&#150;Lennox administrations. As for Glamis, further unruly behaviour by him in pursuit of an interminable family feud with the Crawfords had recently been punished by a highly unpopular and hefty fine by the government.<br>
<br>Although the raiders certainly had the backing of the kirk within Scotland, where their seizure of power was described &#145;as the late action of the reformation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Acts and Proceedings</span>, 2.594), they received, despite their pronounced protestant and Anglophile leanings, little support from the English authorities. An attempt in April 1583, for instance, to negotiate an alliance whereby Elizabeth would restore the English estates of the Lennox family to James VI, came to nought. An annual subsidy of &pound;3000 sterling was eventually agreed in May, but was never paid because of the collapse of the raiders' regime. Instead the English preferred a policy characterized by putting pressure on the Ruthven administration through a threat to release Mary, queen of Scots, and allow her to become joint sovereign with her son, the arrangement sometimes referred to as the &#145;association&#146;.<br>
<br>Meanwhile George Gordon, sixth earl of Huntly, David Lindsay, eleventh earl of Crawford, Colin Campbell, sixth earl of Argyll, and Andrew Leslie, fifth earl of Rothes, former supporters of Arran and Lennox, were conspiring to free James VI from the raiders' custody. This they achieved in June 1583, when the king succeeded in escaping from Ruthven Castle and joined the counter-revolutionaries at St Andrews. Gowrie's regime had ended.<br>
<br>Undoubtedly the main beneficiary of this upheaval was Arran, who quickly assumed control of the country. Most of the former raiders were forced into exile in England, Ireland, or in the case of Angus the north of Scotland. An attempt in April 1584 by Angus, Glamis, Lindsay, and Mar, in partnership with the Hamilton family, to stage another coup by besieging the king and Arran at Stirling was a failure, with the rebels being compelled to retire once more to England. The following month Gowrie, who had been arrested beforehand, was executed for his alleged involvement in the affair.<br>
<br>The former raiders remained in exile for another eighteen months before Elizabeth released them and ensured the downfall of Arran in November 1585. Thereafter the careers of most of the raiders flourished. Angus, until his death in 1588, was a key figure in the administration of the borders, and the earldom of Morton was restored to him in 1587; Glamis was appointed treasurer in the new government, a position he retained for the next decade; Mar, the king's old school companion, remained on friendly terms with James, ultimately becoming the guardian of his son Prince Henry, and much later a royal treasurer; Lindsay was freed from Tantallon Castle, where he had been imprisoned by Arran, though he was not a prominent figure in the few remaining years of his life. Consequently the Ruthven family was the only one adversely affected. The execution of the first earl of Gowrie marked the start of an unfortunate era for that family. It culminated in the deaths in 1600 of two of his sons, in the abortive attempt at seizing James VI known as the Gowrie conspiracy.<br>
