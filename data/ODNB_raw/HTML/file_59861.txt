<span class="headword">Hay,  Matthew</span>  (1855&#150;1932), <span class="occ">physician and expert in forensic medicine and public health</span>, was born at Hill Head, Denny, Stirlingshire, on 27 December 1855, the son of Matthew Hay, colliery owner, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Stirling). An outstanding scholar, educated at Dollar Academy, Hay studied the arts course for two years and the first year of medicine at Glasgow University. He then transferred to Edinburgh University and graduated MB, CM, with highest honours, in 1878; he also won the Ettles prize and the Goodsir fellowship. He became assistant to Richard Fraser, professor of materia medica, and during vacations he studied under Schmiedeberg at Strasbourg. In Berlin he reputedly shared rooms with William Osler, and in 1881 his MD thesis on saline cathartics won him the gold medal and the triennial Goodsir prize for physiological research.<br>
<br>Hay worked on the effects of sodium nitrite and nitroglycerine on angina pectoris and developed a test (which now bears his name) for bile acids. The period he spent as Fraser's assistant fostered his studies in toxicology, and these stood him in good stead when, aged twenty-seven, he successfully applied for the Aberdeen chair of forensic medicine vacated on Francis Ogston's retirement. Hay had barely settled into his teaching of forensic medicine when Dyce Davidson died; Hay then also taught his materia medica course until the university appointed a new professor.<br>
<br>In 1884 Hay was offered and accepted the prestigious chair of pharmacology and therapeutics at Johns Hopkins University medical school, Baltimore. He did not take up the position for what his obituarists have politely termed &#145;family reasons&#146;, but these may well have been connected to a wrangle between Hay and Johns Hopkins over Hay's desire to continue treating private patients. He became a director of the Hay family business, the Callendar ironworks. On 27 August 1884 Hay married Margaret Ferguson Crawford (1854/5&#150;1926), daughter of John Crawford, a Grangemouth shipowner; they had four sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Hay was appointed part-time medical officer of health at Aberdeen in 1888, following two short-term appointments for the post. His own appointment was bitterly contested within the town council, which was split by fears that a part-time medical officer could not give sufficient time to the city's health needs. Hay gave up private practice in exchange for a salary of &pound;300 per annum. He had already introduced public health and hygiene lectures into his forensic medicine course at Aberdeen, thus conforming to the established Scottish pattern of undergraduate teaching of forensic medicine and public health in tandem. Following the example of Sir Douglas Maclagan at Edinburgh, in 1891 Hay instituted postgraduate public health teaching, for a diploma in public health; in addition he provided separate laboratory facilities for public health and forensic medicine.<br>
<br>As well as his medical teaching, by 1890 Hay was also carrying out part-time duties as crown medico-legal examiner, police surgeon, and medical officer of health for Aberdeen city&#151;in positions similar to those held by Henry Duncan Littlejohn in Edinburgh. In 1893 Hay and Littlejohn gave medical and ballistic testimony for opposing counsels in the Monson murder trial at the Edinburgh High Court. As Aberdeen's medical officer of health, Hay brought scientific logic and organization into the realms of mother and child care, the treatment of tuberculosis and venereal disease, medical statistics, and many other areas of public health. His analytical talents were employed not merely in health and sanitary matters, but included the more exotic tasks of ensuring the purity of water used in local whisky distilling and of analysing the city's gas supply. In Aberdeen Hay is remembered mostly for his farsighted plan to centralize the city's municipal and voluntary hospital provision together with university medical teaching, at the Foresterhill site; his plans were brought to fruition by his successor, John Parlane Kinloch.<br>
<br>Hay was a quiet, inventive man. At the age of twenty he planned the processes of the family's newly acquired ironworks. In later life he designed anthropological instruments for his own purposes which were considered valuable by experts. During his teaching career he played a major role in university affairs, which included the building of extensions to Marischal College and which cost more than &pound;250,000. Hay represented Aberdeen University on the General Medical Council and was an original member of the Medical Research Council. As a member of the Carnegie Trust, he drafted the conditions for research fellowships and scholarships. In 1902, together with Leslie Mackenzie, the royal commission appointed him to enquire into the health of schoolchildren. The commission's 1903 recommendation on the medical inspection of schoolchildren was based on their report.<br>
<br>Ill health forced Hay to resign as medical officer of health in 1923 and to resign his chair in 1925. He died at his home, 14 Rubislaw Terrace, Aberdeen, on 30 July 1932. His funeral service on 2 August, held in Marischal College, was a notable Aberdeen town-and-gown occasion, after which his body was buried on the following day at Cameloan cemetery, Stirlingshire.<br>
