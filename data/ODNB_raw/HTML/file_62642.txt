<span class="headword">Brereton <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Hughes]</span>,  Jane</span>  (1685&#150;1740), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born at Bryn Gruffydd near Mold in Flintshire, the younger daughter of Thomas Hughes and his wife, Ann Jones. Her father educated her at home, so that by the time of his death in 1701 she had &#145;already discovered a peculiar genius for poetry&#146;  (&#145;Account&#146;, ii). On 29 January 1711 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3330/', "Thomas Brereton (1690/91&#150;1722)")</script>, at that time a commoner of Brasenose College, and the only son of a major in the army who had fought under the duke of Marlborough and left Thomas a large fortune. They had two sons, Thomas and John, who both died in infancy, and two daughters, Lucy (the elder) and Charlotte. After Oxford, Thomas pursued a literary career in London, publishing verse and plays and a periodical (<span class="italic">The Critick</span>) in 1718, while Jane also published some occasional verses (<span class="italic">The Fifth Ode of the Fourth Book of Horace, Imitated</span> in 1716 and <span class="italic">An Expostulatory Epistle to Sir Richard Steele upon the Death of Mr Addison</span> in 1720). Domestically, however, their life was turbulent: Brereton soon squandered his fortune, despite his wife's household economy, and revealed an ugly temper: &#145;his first fit of passion, after their marriage, was like a thunder-clap to her&#146;  (ibid., vi).<br>
<br>About 1721 Jane Brereton took her daughters to live in Wales, risking censure for having separated from her husband. He obtained a position in the customs office at Parkgate, near Chester; in February 1722 he was returning across the estuary to Chester from visiting his family when he was drowned by the incoming tide. Soon after this Jane Brereton moved to Wrexham in Denbighshire, for the sake of her daughters' education. There she became part of a genteel female social group, and addressed a number of poems to various members of this circle. In general, she eschewed publication, although <span class="italic">Merlin: a Poem</span> was published as a quarto pamphlet in 1735 (dedicated to Queen Caroline, the poem engages with the modish myth of Merlin, who becomes a mouthpiece for some fulsome praise of the house of Brunswick); and from 1734 onwards she published some verse in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> under the pseudonym Melissa. This provoked some humorous verse ripostes from a certain Fido, whom Brereton discovered (only after his death by suicide) to be Thomas Beach, a wine merchant and a Wrexham acquaintance of hers who had encouraged her writing. Apparently to console Brereton for the loss of this literary friendship, Edward Cave, the editor of the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, put her in touch with Elizabeth Carter: they corresponded from 1738 onwards. However, Jane Brereton died at Wrexham on 7 August 1740, after a five-week attack of &#145;the gravel&#146;  (&#145;Account&#146;, vii). She was buried on 10 August 1740 in Wrexham church. She was survived by her daughters: Lucy went to live in Cork with Jane Brereton's brother Thomas, a successful brewer, while Charlotte went to live in Essex and herself wrote poems.<br>
<br>Probably for the benefit of her daughters, proposals for printing Jane Brereton's <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span> were published in 1741 and 1742; subscribers included Elizabeth Carter and John Cleland, and the volume eventually appeared in 1744, with a valuable &#145;Account of the life of Mrs Brereton&#146;, almost certainly written by Charlotte. The &#145;Account&#146; plays down her literary career (&#145;writing was her darling entertainment, and was to her a relaxation from her cares&#146;; &#145;Account&#146;, xii), and emphasizes her exemplary qualities as wife, mother, widow, and Christian. Brereton's body of poetry displays a flair for tactful occasional writing, and represents a transitional moment in women's writing in the eighteenth century, a moment at which being a published writer while retaining respectability was becoming a real possibility.<br>
