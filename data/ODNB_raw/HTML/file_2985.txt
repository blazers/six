<span class="headword">Bouquet,  Henry</span>  (1719&#150;1765), <span class="occ">army officer and military writer</span>, was born at Rolle in the Pays de Vaud, Switzerland. In 1736 he joined the regiment of Constant in the service of the states general of the United Provinces as a cadet, and in 1738 became an ensign. He distinguished himself while serving with the Sardinian forces in the War of the Austrian Succession, and in 1748 was appointed captain-commandant and lieutenant-colonel of a new regiment of Swiss guards which had been raised by the prince of Orange at The Hague. After liaising with the French in their evacuation of captured Dutch territory, he accompanied Lord Middleton on a tour of France and Italy.<br>
<br>At this time, close-order, linear formations formed the backbone of European armies' tactical systems. But when fighting erupted between France and Britain in America in 1754 their inapplicability to many operations in colonial theatres was quickly revealed. Indeed, the need for light troops capable of countering irregular opponents using sniper rather than volley fire and operating in forested, enclosed, or otherwise broken terrain was highlighted as early as July 1755, when a column of redcoats under General Edward Braddock was destroyed by French skirmishers and Native Americans. Although superior in numbers, Braddock's men, deployed in serried ranks in keeping with the nostrums of European battlefield tactics, proved no match for their dispersed, elusive opponents, who, firing at will and exploiting any available cover, picked off officers and men with virtual impunity.<br>
<br>The British, however, learned from this disaster and soon began supplementing existing small bodies of Canadian auxiliaries and friendly Native Americans with new units which were specifically designed with the realm of <i>la petite guerre</i>&#151;the war of outposts, patrols, and skirmishes&#151;in mind. Bouquet, along with another Swiss soldier of fortune, Frederick Haldimand, took command of one such unit, the 60th Royal American regiment. Comprising several battalions, this was specially trained for the &#145;service of the woods&#146;. After playing a key role in the defence of Virginia and Pennsylvania, in 1763&#150;4 Bouquet was entrusted with two expeditions from Canada. In the first, he was ordered to relieve Fort Pitt. This he duly did, beating off a powerful body of Native Americans near Turtle Creek on 5 August. The 1764 expedition also pitted him against such opponents; striking against the Ohio tribes, he triumphed at Bushy Run and ultimately compelled the Shawanese and Delaware to sue for terms. He was appointed brigadier-general and commandant of all the troops in British America's southern colonies, but he perished at Pensacola, Florida, in an epidemic in the autumn of 1765.<br>
<br>Bouquet's successes against irregular foes contrasted starkly with Braddock's defeat only eight years before. But Bouquet's ruminations on the theory of <i>la petite guerre</i> were as significant as his part in its practice. Indeed, persuaded that aptitude had to be moulded by theory, he applied this principle to his innovative training of the 60th regiment. Of all the works produced by the Enlightenment's military thinkers, he had found Count Turpin de Crisse's <span class="italic">Essai sur l'art de la guerre</span> (1754) particularly engrossing and was recommending it to his colleagues long before it was translated into English in 1761. An account of his own campaign against the Ohio tribes was composed by William Smith and published first in Philadelphia in 1765. A second edition appeared in London the following year, for which Bouquet provided an appendix on the training, tactics, and equipment of light infantry deployed in enclosed terrain against an irregular opponent. Though smaller than John Simcoe's <span class="italic">Operations of the Queen's Rangers</span> (1844) or Banastre Tarleton's <span class="italic">Southern Campaigns</span> (1787), his writings rank among the most noteworthy contributions to the illumination of mid-eighteenth-century colonial warfare.<br>
