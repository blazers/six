<span class="headword">Dovaston,  John Freeman Milward</span>  (1782&#150;1854), <span class="occ">naturalist and poet</span>, the younger child and only son of John Dovaston (1740&#150;1808) and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Price, was born on 30 December 1782 in the villa known as The Nursery which his father had personally built on a small ancestral estate developed into a prosperous tree nursery near the village of West Felton, between Oswestry and Shrewsbury, Shropshire. To his remarkable father, the self-educated son of a feckless wheelwright, Dovaston was to owe a life of propertied leisure, manual skills, a fondness for natural history, and a love of the classics and of Welsh music and literature. His father had been an intimate of Shenstone and a taste for poetry and its composition in particular extended also to an uncle and a cousin. But it was music that was latterly to claim him pre-eminently, reflected in his ownership of two organs, a grand piano, a set of harmonica glasses, and a cello.<br>
<br>After successively attending Oswestry grammar school and, more briefly, Shrewsbury School, Dovaston went up in 1800 to Christ Church, Oxford, on a Careswell exhibition. After graduating in 1804 he read for the bar, augmenting his then slender means by acting as drama critic for a newspaper. Called in June 1807, he practised, however, only for a year or two before the death of his father enabled him to abandon a profession he found uncongenial and spend the rest of his life in rural retirement.<br>
<br>At least since undergraduate days Dovaston had been composing poems and in 1812 a volume of these was published locally under the title <span class="italic">Fitz-Gwarine, a ballad of the Welsh border, with other rhymes, legendary, incidental and humorous</span>. The main piece was an evident imitation of Scott's <span class="italic">Marmion</span> of four years earlier. This made him sufficient of a celebrity locally for the freedom of the borough of Oswestry to be conferred on him in 1814. It also won him a national publisher for an enlarged edition (in 1816), followed in 1817 by a collection of songs, <span class="italic">British Melodies</span>, set to music by Clementi, further poems in 1822, and finally a volume of his collected work in 1825. Though he himself doubtless set much store by this <i>oeuvre</i>, its overall impact seems to have been slight.<br>
<br>It is rather for his pioneer experiments in ornithology and his friendship with Thomas Bewick that Dovaston is principally notable. So trifling by comparison with his literary work did he regard the former, however, that details of them were divulged almost apologetically and published so obscurely that their impressively innovatory character lay overlooked for a century and a half. Though the most important of his discoveries saw print in Loudon's widely read <span class="italic">Magazine of Natural History</span>, it was communicated in the guise of a mock Socratic dialogue, his authorship semi-concealed behind an anagram of his name. The choice of Von Osdat was accidentally appropriate, though, for while several others had long anticipated him in noting that robins have individual territories, the only one to have appreciated the biological significance of this was an Austrian counterpart, Baron Von Pernau. Until the 1920s, however, no one but Dovaston seems to have pursued matters to the point of trapping and marking birds and, albeit unsystematically, discriminating territories. This work was a by-product of his no less pioneer use of a feeding device for wild birds, punningly termed by him an &#145;ornithotrophe&#146;. Similarly advanced were his regular resort to a spyglass for watching birds, when almost everyone else relied still on a gun, and his creation on his estate of artificial nesting holes and boxes. He even did some rudimentary ringing of migrants, utilizing his cello wire for the purpose, and made abortive attempts to translate bird songs into musical notation. Nor were birds the only focus of his thoughtful curiosity: he also succeeded in growing mistletoe on over a score of different tree species.<br>
<br>Regrettably, Dovaston was content to be a dilettante and through diffidence or inertia was disinclined to trawl for converts or penetrate further in his experiments. His most substantial publication in natural history was a mere list of local birds contributed to W. A. Leighton's <span class="italic">Guide to Shrewsbury</span> in 1850, following many plant records supplied to the same author's <span class="italic">Flora of Shropshire</span> of 1841. But a mass of notes dating from boyhood onwards which he sent to Bewick for the sixth edition of his <span class="italic">History of British Birds</span> was little drawn on, to his chagrin. A great admirer of Bewick's work, Dovaston had called on him in Newcastle while on a walking tour in 1823 and the two remained in touch until Bewick's death five years later. Dovaston procured orders for Bewick's works among his friends, passed on specimens and notes from his naturalist neighbours, and drafted the preface for the last edition of the <span class="italic">History</span>. The account of Bewick he subsequently published in the <span class="italic">Magazine of Natural History</span> has ever since been the main source for the artist's biographers.<br>
<br>As well as an unpublished account of a tour through Scotland as far as the Hebrides that he made with his friend J. E. Bowman in 1825, which characteristically includes valuable observations on the bagpipe and its music, much of Dovaston's correspondence has survived. Forthright and decided in his views, he reveals in this a coolness towards the church and a whig stance politically which none the less failed to alienate the many devoted friends won by his liveliness, warmth, and humour.<br>
<br>After several serious illnesses from digestive disorders Dovaston's health finally failed in 1847, leaving him permanently bedridden. He died at home on 8 August 1854 and was buried in the churchyard at West Felton. A lifelong bachelor, he left his estate to a nephew, but his library of over 3000 volumes was dispersed by auction in 1910. He is commemorated in the Dovaston Yew, <i>Taxus baccata</i> var. <i>dovastonii</i>, a pendulous variety derived from a bush found by his father in a local hedge.<br>
