<span class="headword">Cockburn,  John</span>  (1652&#150;1729), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 20 April 1652, the son of John Cockburn (<i>c</i>.1620&#150;1658), a tailor in the Canongate, Edinburgh, and his wife, Sarah Inglis (<i>d</i>. 1688). In 1666 he entered Edinburgh University, but in November 1668 was transferred to King's College, Aberdeen, by his uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24943/', "Patrick Scougal")</script> of Saltoun, bishop of Aberdeen, who oversaw his studies. After graduating MA on 20 June 1670 Cockburn probably continued to study under Scougal, until in 1673 he became tutor to Lord Keith, son of George, ninth Earl Marischal. He left his post in 1675 and was ordained by his uncle, who presented him to the parish of Udny, Aberdeenshire, on 14 February 1676. A public disturbance occurred at his institution in May, owing to the laird of Udny's claim to the patronal rights. In August Cockburn declined a presentation to the parish of Langton, Berwickshire, offered by his cousin, Cockburn of Langton. On 15 November 1677 he married Anna Garden (<i>d</i>. 1695), daughter of Alexander Garden, minister of Forgue, with whom he had at least four children, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5775/', "Patrick Cockburn (1678&#150;1749)")</script>.<br>
<br>Between 10 August and 7 September 1681 Cockburn was translated from Udny to Old Deer, Aberdeenshire, thanks to the patronage of the Earl Marischal. Baulking at the test oath, which from 31 August 1681 bound all civil and ecclesiastical office holders to adhere to the whole confession of faith of 1560 and to support the established government in church and state, Cockburn joined the strong opposition shown by Bishop Scougal and his clergy. However, in February 1682 he and eight &#145;loyall and learned&#146; churchmen  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, <i>1681&#150;2</i>, 343), overcame their scruples concerning the confession and the royal supremacy, complied, and were allowed by the privy council of Scotland to return to their parishes. On 13 June 1683 he was translated to the parish of Ormiston, Haddingtonshire, in the gift of Sir Archibald Cockburn, filling a vacancy caused by John Sinclair's deprivation for refusing the test. Consequently Cockburn's assiduous ministry was fraught with difficulty, especially in persuading parishioners to act as elders in the kirk session, but it is unclear if he followed the common practice, alleged by Wodrow, of deliberately nominating presbyterians so they could be prosecuted for their refusal to serve.<br>
<br>Cockburn undertook the innovative publication of a monthly periodical in January 1688. The <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Universalis</span>, which was perhaps modelled on Pierre Bayle's <span class="italic">Nouvelles de la r&eacute;publique des lettres</span>, contained translations of recent reviews of theological and other works from French periodicals. The duke of Perth construed some passages as anti-Catholic and the privy council quickly stopped further publication. That year Cockburn was made a doctor of divinity at Aberdeen. Following the revolution, like many other episcopal clergy, he was cited before the council for not reading the proclamation of 13 April 1689 which declared William and Mary as sovereigns, and instead of praying for them, praying for King James and confusion on his enemies. After one month in prison, until 7 August, he was deprived of his parish on 29 August. The privy council again gaoled him on 5 September 1690 for a period.<br>
<br>A sharp polemic against the presbyterian church settlement, <span class="italic">Historical Relation of the Pretended General Assembly</span>, and a second part (1691), are attributed to Cockburn during a stay in London, when he befriended the nonjuror Dr Thomas Smith. After returning to Edinburgh in December 1691, he occasionally preached in 1692&#150;3. The council arrested and examined him in March 1693 on suspicion of practices against the government committed by nonjuring clergy. Although his papers contained nothing damning, he admitted managing charitable donations for the episcopal clergy. On 27 June 1693 he refused to take the oaths of allegiance and assurance, and was ordered to leave their majesties' dominions by August. His pass to travel to the Netherlands from England was dated 18 September 1693.<br>
<br>Next Cockburn lived at the court of the exiled James VII at St Germain, where he hoped to find sanctuary, if not reward. After a period he was represented as a dangerous man by priests who had failed to convert him to Rome and, like his cousin Cockburn of Langton the younger who also became <i>persona non grata</i> at St Germain, he was forced to quit France by the authorities. Cockburn returned to England about 1696, when he published <span class="italic">An Enquiry into the Nature, Necessity, and Evidence of Christian Faith</span>. In 1697 a second part appeared, followed by <span class="italic">Fifteen Sermons</span>. In early 1698, shortly after publishing his first narrative of <span class="italic">Bourignianism Detected</span>, against the Catholic mystic and prophet Antoinette Bourignon, his prolific output was interrupted briefly by his hurried departure from England following the act against corresponding with King James. An interim <span class="italic">Letter</span> on Bourignon was dated at Rotterdam on 11/21 April 1698, and his second narrative followed that year. He sought to demonstrate that she was a false prophet and saint, but his bitter denigration of her mystical piety reflected his own renunciation of the quietist spirituality which he had imbibed from his uncle and from his cousin, Henry Scougal. As his brother-in-law George Garden pointed out, Cockburn had once venerated Thomas &agrave; Kempis's <span class="italic">Imitation of Christ</span>. In 1708 Cockburn felt it necessary to clear himself of the imputation of unorthodoxy and Bourignonism in <span class="italic">Right Notions of God and Religion</span>.<br>
<br>At Rotterdam Cockburn lodged with the scholar Pierre Bayle, another enemy to Bourignonism, and forged a friendship with the bookseller Leers, who introduced him to the leading men of the place. He endeavoured to set up as chaplain to resident Anglicans, but his nonjuring principles and reluctance to pray for King William alienated the majority of the English merchants, as well as alarmed the English authorities, so he departed during 1699, leaving it to his successor to establish an official ministry. His first wife had died in July 1695. He married again apparently some two years later, while abroad; his new wife was Elizabeth Littlepage, daughter of Sir Joseph Littlepage of Buckinghamshire, with whom he had at least seven children. Settling next in Amsterdam, Cockburn began to hold prayer-book services in a private chapel on the first Sunday in January 1700. His persistent efforts were crowned with the success of a lasting congregation, and he enjoyed cordial relations with the burgomasters, who granted the Anglicans the right to worship. His political principles were perhaps not tested by the imposition of oaths applicable in England, but it was later claimed he prayed for King William and Queen Anne. Henry Compton, bishop of London, and John Sharp, archbishop of York, supported his ministry.<br>
<br>In March 1703, after returning from a brief visit to England in order to secure a royal grant of &pound;60 for the chaplaincy, Cockburn began sending reports on public affairs to the earl of Nottingham, hoping for the gift of an English living to which he could retire. In January 1704, as financial hardship caused him to dispose of most of his library, he complained that Bishop Burnet's false allegations of his clashes with other clergy and the authorities had caused the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel to stop its grant. However, he persisted with his ministry, occasionally publishing sermons. In 1708 his crown grant was raised to &pound;100.<br>
<br>That year Cockburn was granted the rectory of Beercrocombe, Somerset, where he hoped to employ his son Patrick as curate. He had left Amsterdam by 27 May 1709, when he was honoured with a doctorate in divinity by Oxford University in recognition of his successful chaplaincy. On 9 June he was instituted to the rectory of Curry Malet, Somerset, in the queen's gift, but resided in London. Taking the requisite oaths was an abandonment of his nonjurancy and an avowal of orthodox Anglican churchmanship. It was later claimed that Cockburn was so well thought of that, had the project for bishops for the American colonies been realized, the queen intended his appointment as one of them. It was at her instance that in 1714, as he was about to take up residence in one of his charges, he was somewhat reluctantly presented by John Robinson, bishop of London, to the vicarage of Northolt or Northall, Middlesex, one of the wealthiest in his diocese. Resigning his rectories, he devoted himself to his parochial duties at Northolt, and provided during his life for the education of ten boys and six girls of the parish. He wrote an account of Northolt's history and present state.<br>
<br>Cockburn continued to pen earnest works of a practical, moral cast, including <span class="italic">A Discourse of Self-Murder</span> (1716) and <span class="italic">The History and Examination of Duels</span>, written about 1717 and published in 1720 in support of the outlawing of duels. In 1717&#150;18 he again displayed his conservative and orthodox credentials with two defences of the rights and authority of the church against the views of Benjamin Hoadly, bishop of Bangor. After the publication of Gilbert Burnet's <span class="italic">History of his Own Times</span>, about 1724 he was encouraged to write a pamphlet correcting, among other matters, Burnet's account of his Scottish career, in which he accused him of historical bias, indiscretion, and intemperate behaviour. However, he admitted having to rely on his memory of many papers, including some of Bishop Scougal's, which he had lost. In addition to about twenty-three published works, latterly Cockburn completed a history of the Scottish church from the Restoration to the revolution, which was probably one of several manuscripts left unpublished at his death aged seventy-seven, on 20 November 1729. He was described as &#145;true and sincere in his private friendships, kind and benevolent to all mankind&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. J.40.2). On 26 November he was buried in Northolt parish church; his wife survived him.<br>
