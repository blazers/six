<span class="headword">Wallis,  Henry</span>  (1830&#150;1916), <span class="occ">painter and ceramics expert</span>, was born in London on 21 February 1830. His father's name and occupation are unknown. When in 1845 his mother, Mary Anne Thomas, married Andrew Wallis, a prosperous London property owner, Henry took his stepfather's surname.<br>
<br>Wallis commenced his training at F. S. Cary's academy in Bloomsbury. He was admitted as a probationer in the Royal Academy on 7 January 1848 and enrolled in the painting school there on 31 March. He also studied in Paris in the atelier of M. G. C. Gleyre and at the Acad&eacute;mie des Beaux-Arts, probably some time between 1849 and 1853. He first exhibited in England at the Royal Manchester Institution in 1853 and in London in February 1854 at the British Institution.<br>
<br>By early 1855 Wallis was acquainted with the novelist and poet George Meredith. This led to Meredith's posing for the face of the dead poet Thomas Chatterton in Wallis's painting <span class="italic">Chatterton</span> (Tate collection), which was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1856. This picture made Wallis famous overnight: John Ruskin, for example, described it as &#145;faultless and wonderful&#146;  (Parris, 144). Its continuing fascination for the public owes much to the way in which it is inextricably linked with a real-life &#145;romance&#146;: in the summer of 1857, if not before, Wallis and Meredith's wife, Mary Ellen, daughter of Thomas Love Peacock, became lovers. Mary Meredith left her husband, and had a son with Wallis, Harold (Felix) Meredith (later Wallis) in April 1858. Mary Ellen died in October 1861.<br>
<br>Contact with the melancholy sensibility and radicalism of Gleyre, as well as with the work of French realist painters, led Wallis to paint his masterpiece, <span class="italic">The Stonebreaker</span> (1857; Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery), though his direct inspiration was Thomas Carlyle's <span class="italic">Sartor Resartus</span>. Wallis's sombre and realistic image of a dead labourer is both pioneering and unique in British art. <span class="italic">The Stonebreaker</span>, exhibited in 1858, consolidated Wallis's reputation as a true Pre-Raphaelite.<br>
<br>However, after his stepfather's death in 1859, when he came into a comfortable inheritance, Wallis never again made the same artistic impact, though he remained a Royal Academy exhibitor until 1877. He also exhibited with the Old Watercolour Society, of which he became a member in 1880. An interest in archaeology, ceramics, and Renaissance art took him increasingly abroad and he became a perceptive and quietly passionate writer on these subjects&#151;notably for the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> between 1882 and 1890. Always interested in contemporary artistic matters, he was also honorary secretary of the committee for the preservation of St Mark's, Venice, between 1882 and 1890. Wallis's most notable achievement between 1885 and 1899 was to publish in twenty slim volumes, most of them illustrated by himself, his researches into Persian, Egyptian, Greek, and Byzantine ceramics.<br>
<br>A discerning collector, Wallis made a small but highly original contribution to the art and connoisseurship of his time. For all this, he remains an elusive personality: according to W. M. Rossetti he was &#145;a very agreeable companion, of solid character and open mind&#146;. Wallis never married. He died on 20 December 1916 at his home, 1 Walpole Road, Croydon, Surrey, and was buried in Highgate cemetery.<br>
