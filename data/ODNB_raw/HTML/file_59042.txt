<span class="headword">Bloet family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1080&#150;<em>c.</em>1300), <span class="occ">gentry</span>, in the south-west and Welsh march, was first represented by <a name="cosubject_59040"></a><span class="headword">Ralph [i] Bloet</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1086&#150;<em>c.</em>1112), chief tenant of the honour of Striguil at the time of the Domesday survey. He held lands totalling forty-three hides in Hampshire, Somerset, Wiltshire, and Gloucestershire in 1086. He granted the manor of Ruddle, Gloucestershire, to Gloucester Abbey before 1100, and confirmed the manor of Bulley, Gloucestershire, to the same abbey before 1112, grants that indicate that he had also obtained the <span class="roman">Domesday</span> lands of Walter Balistarius after the survey, but before the death of William II. The <a name="cosubject_59041"></a><span class="headword">Ralph [ii] Bloet</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1157)<span class="occ"></span> who appears as a prominent follower of Gilbert de Clare, earl of Pembroke (<i>d</i>. 1148), and his son Earl Richard de Clare (<i>d</i>. 1176)&#151;successive lords of Striguil&#151;may have been son or grandson of the first Ralph. Nothing much of Ralph [ii] is known, other than that he had died by 1157 and fathered a number of sons, some of whom founded cadet lines. One of these younger sons, Walter Bloet (who had died by 1199), founded a branch of the family at Raglan, Monmouthshire, which he had by grant of Earl Richard de Clare, and participated in the earl's conquest of Leinster. Another younger son, Sir Robert Bloet (<i>fl</i>. 1207), took a share of the Bloet lands at Daglingworth, Gloucestershire, and picked up Wiltshire estates based at Salthrop. Both the Raglan and Daglingworth branches survived and prospered into the fourteenth century.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_59042"></a><span class="headword">Sir Ralph [iii] Bloet</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1199)<span class="occ"></span> inherited the bulk of the family lands, and also his father's leading position in the honour of Striguil. He accompanied his lord, Earl Richard de Clare, on the conquest of Leinster and is named by the &#145;Song of Dermot and the Earl&#146; as one of the earl's council at Waterford in 1171. But neither he nor his brothers acquired any sizeable estates in Leinster as a result. On the earl's death Ralph and his younger brother William were granted wardship of the honour of Striguil and Chepstow Castle, which they jointly held until 1185, and Ralph alone thereafter until Michaelmas 1188. Ralph can be proved to have held all the lands that had been in the hands of Ralph [i] in 1086, and his considerable holdings within the honour are sufficient to explain his local prominence. After William (I) Marshal acquired the honour of Striguil by marriage to Countess Isabel de Clare (daughter of Earl Richard) the connection persisted, for Ralph [iii] witnessed the Marshal's charters in 1189. Ralph died early in 1199. His wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47222/', "Nest Bloet (d. 1224/5)")</script>, was a member of the Welsh royal dynasty of Caerleon, and had been a mistress of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12949/', "Henry II")</script> during the early 1170s. Ralph [iii] brought up her illegitimate son by the king, Morgan Bloet, later provost of Beverley and bishop-elect of Durham (1213). She seems to have been responsible for the close connections between their many sons and the royal curia in the time of King John. Nest Bloet survived Ralph by many years and enjoyed a substantial dower settlement.<br>
<br>Their eldest son, <a name="cosubject_59043"></a><span class="headword">Sir Ralph [iv] Bloet</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1241/2)<span class="occ"></span>, continued the family's connection with the household of the lords of Striguil. He attested acts of William (I) Marshal, earl of Pembroke (<i>d</i>. 1219), and fought on his side during the wars of 1215&#150;17. The connection was long-lasting; Ralph [iv] was suspected of supporting the rebellion of his lord, Richard Marshal, earl of Pembroke (<i>d</i>. 1234), against Henry III and had his English lands confiscated in 1233 as a result, although they were soon restored. He appears as a knight active across the several counties where he held land. He died at some time late in 1241 or early in 1242 leaving his sons minors. The result was a wardship agreement between Walter Marshal, earl of Pembroke, and Earl Simon de Montfort, by which Ralph [iv]'s lands, sons, and their marriages were granted to Montfort. The eldest, <a name="cosubject_59044"></a><span class="headword">Sir William Bloet</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1287<span class="mult">x</span>1300)<span class="occ"></span>, took the bulk of the lands but has no known later connection with the earl; however, William's younger brother, Ralph [v] Bloet of Hinton Blewitt, fought and died for Montfort at Evesham in 1265. William was of age in 1251 and had respites of knighthood, a status he was still avoiding in 1256, but to which he had succumbed by 1264, securing a lifetime exemption for juries in 1268. He was active in public affairs, investigating (as a knight of Hampshire) the abuses of Adam of Stratton on the Isle of Wight, and being summoned to a great council at Gloucester in 1287. He had died by 1300, when the family's lands had come to one John Bloet, who may well have been his son, although this is not certain.<br>
<br>The family of Bloet was a remarkable instance of continuity both of a magnate connection and prosperity over several generations. Four, or perhaps five, successive heads of the family were leading retainers of the lords of Striguil, a period spanning over 150 years. The continuity of the link may have had a lot to do with the size of the Bloet holding (some six large manors) within the honour, which was a significant proportion of the tenured lands, and which was referred to&#151;exceptionally&#151;as a <i>baronia</i> within it (rather like the <i>baroniae</i> of the honours of Glamorgan and Chester) in 1284. There is also the significance of the fact that the family had from the Clares (probably since the twelfth century) another large manor in Langstone, Monmouthshire, which tied them to the march and marcher interests. The family largely retained its original endowment: interests at Daglingworth and Hinton Blewitt were subinfeudated to cadet branches, and not alienated. Other cadets were endowed with acquisitions, some acquired through their own initiative (like Raglan) and others by marriage, like Liswerry and Salisbury, Monmouthshire, which came to William Bloet, son of Ralph [iii], from the marriage settlement of Nest, Ralph's wife. The family made some endowments of religious houses. Ralph [i] patronized Gloucester Abbey, and Ralph [iii] Godstow Abbey, where his sister became a nun. The use of Gloucestershire lands in both cases indicates that the family regarded its English centre as elsewhere: certainly Silchester, Hampshire, was its chief seat by the thirteenth century. The family's arms appear on William Bloet's seal (<i>c</i>.1250) and in St George's roll (<i>c</i>.1285) as or, two wings conjoined in fess gules.<br>
