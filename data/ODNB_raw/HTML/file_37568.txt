<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Horne,  (Charles) Kenneth</span>  (1907&#150;1969), <span class="occ">comedian</span>, was born on 27 February 1907 at Ampthill Square, London, the youngest in the family of three sons and four daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37569/', "(Charles) Sylvester Horne (1865&#150;1914)")</script>, Congregational minister, and his wife, Katharine Maria (1870&#150;1958), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32605/', "Herbert Hardy Cozens-Hardy, later first Baron Cozens-Hardy")</script>, master of the rolls. Horne was educated at St George's School, Harpenden, Hertfordshire, at the London School of Economics, and at Magdalene College, Cambridge. Though popular with contemporaries and a fine sportsman (he gained a tennis half-blue at Cambridge), he did not have a spectacular academic career, and was sent down from the university in December 1927.<br>
<br>Through the influence of his uncle, Austin Pilkington, a director of the Pilkington Glass Company, Horne secured a job as a progress clerk with the Triplex Safety Glass Company in 1928. On 20 September 1930 he married Lady Mary Pelham-Clinton-Hope (1910&#150;1982), second daughter of the eighth duke of Newcastle, but the marriage was annulled in 1933. On 5 September 1936 he married (Margaret) Joan (<i>b</i>. 1915/16), daughter of Ernest Burgess, chairman and managing director of a Birmingham firm of brass founders. In 1938 Horne enlisted in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. He was commissioned as acting pilot officer and posted to 911 squadron (barrage balloons). He served in the RAF throughout the war, reaching the rank of wing commander, and on demobilization in 1945 he rejoined Triplex Glass as sales director. He was divorced in the same year, and married, on 2 November 1945, Marjorie Mallinson (<i>b</i>. 1909/10), widow of Lieutenant George Ambler Thomas and daughter of Harry George Sadler, civil servant. Horne himself had no surviving children, but his third wife had a daughter from her previous marriage. His business career continued to flourish after the war and he became managing director of the British Industries Fair (1954&#150;6) and chairman and managing director of the Chad Valley Toy Company (1956&#150;8), among other directorships. He gave up his business interests in 1958, when he was partially incapacitated by coronary thrombosis.<br>
<br>From 1940, when he made his first appearance over the airwaves as quizmaster in the BBC radio series <span class="italic">Ack, Ack, Beer, Beer</span>, Kenneth Horne was a constant broadcaster, and in 1943, by then stationed at the Air Ministry in London, he created and wrote with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39942/', "Squadron Leader Richard Murdoch (1907&#150;1990)")</script> the radio series <span class="italic">Much Binding in the Marsh</span>, a take-off based on a fictitious RAF station, which ran until 1950. He was subsequently the eponymous Ken of the comedy radio series <span class="italic">Beyond our Ken</span> (1958&#150;64), which claimed up to 10 million listeners. <span class="italic">Round the Horne</span> succeeded <span class="italic">Beyond our Ken</span> in 1965, and achieved international audiences. Frequently repeated on the radio, the scripts (by Marty Feldman and Barry Took) were published in the 1970s and again in the following decade, and the BBC released recordings of the shows on cassette. Horne's rich, fruity voice and warm patrician manner made him the ideal link man and that, coupled with a mischievous sense of humour, ensured that any programme in which he was involved was the better for his presence. He was, his obituarist wrote, &#145;a master of the scandalous double-meaning delivered with shining innocence &hellip; [and of] the excruciating schoolboy pun&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). He also chaired a television quiz show, <span class="italic">Celebrity Challenge</span>, and the radio programme <span class="italic">Twenty Questions</span>, and his skill in handling staff and co-directors in industry transferred successfully to his broadcasting career. His notably temperamental co-star, Kenneth Williams, paid tribute to &#145;his unselfish nature, his kindness, tolerance and gentleness [which] were an example to everyone&#146;  (<span class="italic">Kenneth Williams Diaries</span>, 345). Kenneth Horne died on 14 February 1969 at St George's Hospital, Westminster, having suffered a second heart attack during the awards presentations of the Guild of British Film and Television Producers at the Dorchester Hotel, London.<br>
