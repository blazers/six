<span class="headword">Scott, Sir  Nicholas Paul</span>  (1933&#150;2005), <span class="occ">politician and businessman</span>, was born at the North Middlesex County Hospital, Edmonton, London, on 5 August 1933, the eldest son of Percival John Scott, a Metropolitan Police officer, and his Irish Catholic wife, Teresa Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Murphy. At the time of his birth his father was a police constable, but he later rose to be a chief inspector. Scott was educated modestly, first at St Andrew's primary school in Streatham, and then at Clapham College. Later he studied part-time at the City of London College and the City Literary Institute, which allowed him to acquire a variety of executive posts and consultancies, principally in print, design, and publishing. After college he joined the RAF as a trainee navigator, but bad eyesight curtailed his career. On 7 August 1964, by then the personal assistant to the managing director of an advertising firm, he married Elizabeth Rosemary Merriell, a thirty-year-old divorcee, general secretary of an educational organization, and daughter of Robert Bissett Robinson, director of government contracts at the General Post Office. They had a daughter, and adopted a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Scott was involved in Conservative politics from an early age, serving as a Conservative councillor on Holborn borough council in 1956&#150;9 and 1962&#150;5, and as national chairman of the Young Conservatives in 1963. He unsuccessfully contested Islington South-West in the general elections of 1959 and 1964 before being chosen as candidate for the safe Conservative seat of Paddington South, which he duly won in the general election of 1966. As a backbencher he spoke out against Enoch Powell's attack on Commonwealth immigrants in 1968, and in the same year repeatedly voted against James Callaghan's legislation to limit the entry into Britain of east African Asians. When the Conservatives returned to government in 1970, he was named parliamentary private secretary to Iain Macleod, the chancellor of the exchequer, just a month before Macleod died. Returning to the back benches, he stuck to his liberal views, opposing the sale of arms to apartheid South Africa. In 1972 he re-entered the government, this time as parliamentary private secretary to another liberal Conservative, Robert Carr, the home secretary. In January 1974, at the very end of Edward Heath's government, he became parliamentary under-secretary of state at the Department of Employment, under William Whitelaw.<br>
<br>Despite having been lauded by <span class="italic">Time</span> magazine as one of the &#145;future leaders of the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 8 Jan 2005), Scott's political career suddenly stalled. First, he lost his Paddington seat at the election of February 1974. Second, although he made a swift return to the Commons in October 1974 via the safe seat of Chelsea, Margaret Thatcher, the new Conservative leader, removed him from his post as shadow housing minister when he refused a more junior post. Nor was he included in Thatcher's first government following the Conservatives' return to power in May 1979. Instead he was elected to the chairmanship of the Conservative back-bench employment committee, as well as serving on the executive of the back-bench 1922 committee. Once described by Richard Crossman as &#145;the most liberal Tory of them all&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 10 Jan 2005), Scott had founded Nick's Diner, an informal club where like-minded tory &#145;wets&#146;, who had originally gathered, according to Kenneth Clarke, &#145;to prevent Ted Heath becoming too left-wing&#146;  (ibid.), now met up to criticize Margaret Thatcher's monetarist policies. Scott briefly flirted with the idea of joining the Social Democratic Party (SDP), but ultimately stayed loyal.<br>
<br>Scott's luck turned in September 1981, when James Prior, exiled to Northern Ireland, handpicked his own ministerial team. As parliamentary under-secretary of state, given responsibility for prisons, Scott was heavily criticized after a mass breakout from the Maze prison in September 1983, but Prior threatened to resign if Scott was dismissed. In the event, in September 1986, Scott was promoted to minister of state, returning in June 1987 to the mainland as minister of state at the Department of Health and Social Security, following the longest period in office in Northern Ireland by any post-war minister. In this new post his liberal tory instincts for higher public spending repeatedly jarred with Margaret Thatcher's constant desire for cutbacks. He continued at the trimmed-down Department of Social Security under John Major, taking on the additional title of minister for the disabled in 1990. His political career hit the buffers in May 1994, when he was found to have misled the House of Commons over government wrecking tactics that killed off a back-bench <span class="roman">Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill</span>. His cause was not helped when his daughter, Victoria, herself a disabled rights campaigner, led the political attack against him. Two months later, he lost his post in a ministerial reshuffle.<br>
<br>In 1995 John Major recommended Scott for a knighthood&#151;he had already been appointed MBE in 1964 and sworn of the privy council in 1989. Thereafter Scott suffered a series of personal misfortunes. Having survived a tough reselection battle for the redrawn seat of Kensington and Chelsea, his car shunted into another, trapping a three-year-old in a pushchair. Scott departed the scene, leaving his secretary to cope. He was later found guilty of drink-driving. Then, in 1996, he was photographed face down in a Bournemouth gutter, following an Irish embassy party at the Conservative Party conference. Few believed his story&#151;that he had only had two glasses of wine, but that these had interacted with prescribed painkillers&#151;and especially disbelieving were many of the Eurosceptic members of his Kensington and Chelsea constituency association. They called a vote of confidence: Scott lost, making way for Alan Clark.<br>
<br>It is said that Scott only joined the Conservative Party because &#145;I was told the prettiest girls were in the Young Conservatives&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 8 Jan 2005). His first marriage ended in 1976. There followed several high-profile alliances, including one with the black model Mynah Bird. On 18 April 1979 Scott married the Hon. Cecilia Anne Tapsell (<i>b</i>. 1943), dress designer, former wife of the Conservative MP Sir Peter Tapsell, and daughter of Bladen Wilmer Hawke, ninth Baron Hawke of Towton. They had one son and one daughter. Scott died on 6 January 2005, at Nazareth House, Hammersmith Road, Hammersmith, London, after suffering for a long period with Alzheimer's disease. He was survived by his second wife and four children, the adopted daughter from his first marriage having predeceased him.<br>
