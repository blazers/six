<span class="headword">Elliot,  Archibald</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1761, <em>d.</em> 1823), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was baptized on 30 August 1761 at Ancrum, Roxburghshire, the son of Archibald Elliot, a carrier. Ancrum was a parish reputed for its building craftsmen. With his brother <a name="cosubject_62922"></a><span class="headword">James Elliot</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1770, <em>d.</em> 1810), <span class="occ">architect</span>, baptized on 29 April 1770 in Ancrum, Archibald redesigned some of the largest and most imposing early nineteenth-century romantic houses in Scotland. It is not known where the brothers trained, but possibly in the expatriate community in London. Archibald was involved (possibly initially at craft level, since until the end of his life he ran a carpenter's shop beside his office in Osnaburg Street, St Pancras) in works to Douglas Castle, Lanarkshire, which James Playfair began in 1791. On Playfair's death in 1794, the year Elliot first exhibited at the Royal Academy, he took over charge of works at Douglas. Probably some time before 1799 he married Sarah Shiells, for their son Archibald, also an architect, was born that year. It is thought that the brothers had some link with George Steuart, another expatriate Scot who retired to the Isle of Man, and in particular with the construction of Steuart's Castle Mona at Douglas (1806). Certainly Steuart's clientele&#151;the dukes of Atholl and earls of Abercorn&#151;match with the Elliots', and may have facilitated their acceptance by aristocratic society. Any work they undertook in England has not yet been identified. In 1800 James Elliot was introduced to the second marquess of Breadalbane by Alexander Trotter of Dreghorn, for whom he was reworking and aggrandizing Dreghorn, Midlothian (dem.), as:<blockquote>a young man who has considerable talents as a draughtsman &hellip; as he is at this time quite disengaged he would be most happy to mount his poney and wait upon you at Taymouth &hellip; He is a young man of but very mean appearance but of considerable abilities as a draftsman and designer, and he proposes to join in business with a brother whom he has got in London and who has had a regular education there, and much experience with the best masters. Their good character, attention and ability has induced me to mention them (Breadalbane Muniments, NA Scot.)</blockquote>and he forwarded a plan by James for Taymouth Castle, Perthshire, then being rebuilt by John Paterson. By 1805 James was appointed architect for &#145;the finishing&#146; of Taymouth by the marquess (a man given to detailed design and contract interference), which appears, in essence, to symbolize the cadet house of the Campbells seeking to outclass the chief's Inveraray Castle (the residence of the dukes of Argyll). Archibald was paid a separate fee for advice whenever consulted, provided highly ornate doors for the marquess' Park Lane house, and prepared and shipped up wainscoting for Taymouth. The characteristic central tower the Elliots erected at Taymouth was used by James to denote nobility.<br>
<br>As architect, Archibald Elliot advertised in 1804 for contractors to rework and aggrandize Loudoun Castle, Ayrshire (now in ruins), for the earl of Moira, which implies an already substantial reputation. It was quickly followed by the Dunfermline Guildhall and Stobo House, Peeblesshire (both 1805), for Chief Baron Montgomery. The brothers were joint architects for Stobo, but James controlled the contract. Large houses such as Stobo were heavily picturesque, symmetrical, and invariably in castellated clothing in the manner of Inveraray or Monzie Castle, Perthshire. Given that his patrons were generally from the top rank of Scottish society, Archibald could liaise directly with them when he was in London for the season, living at 60 High Street and then New Road, Marylebone, and, later, at Osnaburg Street in St Pancras. The Elliots' London presence helped to prevent their clients from being tempted to commission fashionable, London-based English architects. It was William Atkinson to whom Breadalbane went, however, for advice of how to remedy water penetration in Taymouth's tower. James, meanwhile, set up as architect in Carrubber's Close, Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Breadalbane also appointed James Elliot, together with Allan Johnston (builder of Stirling Atheneum) to design the villa of Auchmore House, Killin (1806&#150;7) and the delightful octagonal Glenorchy church, Dalmally (1809). In 1807 James produced a simple crow-stepped box as the new kirk in Kirkcaldy, and the following year undertook alterations to Dunkeld House. He had suffered from ill health since 1807, and died, aged forty, in October 1810, just after completing a new lodge at Taymouth.<br>
<br>Thereafter Archibald Elliot opened an Edinburgh base, at Calton Hill. Between 1809 and 1814 he reworked the unusual V-plan of Minto House, Hawick, into a strangely austere classical composition for Lord Elliot (with whom there may have been a connection), undertook works to Dunkeld Cathedral in 1814 (drawings at Blair Castle), and towered Lindertis House, Forfarshire (1815; dem.). The buildings of the remainder of his career veered in style between a continuation of castellated picturesque and grandly neo-classical. In the former were the prison and governor's house, Calton Hill, Edinburgh (1815&#150;17)&#151;&#145;a toy castle devoid of expression and utterly meaningless&#146;, sniffed Sir Rowand Anderson  (R. R. Anderson, <span class="italic">The Place of Architecture in the Domain of Art</span>, 1889, 23)&#151;Newbyth, East Lothian (1816), the north front of Lochnell House, Barcaldine&#151;a stylistic attribution, although General Campbell of Lochnell still owed him &pound;113 at his death&#151;the county and town buildings, Paisley, built with William Reid (both of 1818&#150;20), and the diminutive Jedburgh model gaol (1820&#150;23).<br>
<br>Archibald Elliot's reputation, however, rests upon his neo-classical urban designs, beginning with the momentous Regent bridge, Edinburgh (1815), which he won in competition with James Gillespie and Richard Crichton. It involved vast underbuilding, wholly obscured by the delicate columned screens visible today. While in London he entered the Edinburgh University competition of 1816 unsuccessfully and the same year was appointed for the county buildings, Edinburgh (dem.). Two years later he designed Edinburgh's Waterloo Place (and became a shareholder in the Waterloo Hotel). It is the crisp majesty of these neo-classical buildings, the use of the most up-to-date details, and the grandeur of axial conception of Waterloo Place that secured his reputation. In 1819 he designed a pantheon at the bottom of Edinburgh's Mound for the prospectus for the commissioners of the national monument, whose still outstanding fee of &pound;200 was classed as an irrecoverable debt on his death. In 1819 he prepared a scheme building on the damlands of Rubislaw (land just west of old Aberdeen) and for Rutland Street and Rutland Square, Edinburgh. His Broughton Place Church in Edinburgh of 1821 has an extraordinarily heavy horizontality, whereas The Haining in Selkirk was extended <i>c</i>.1818 with a delightful bow and colonnade.<br>
<br>In 1816 Elliot designed the ambitiously perpendicular St Paul's and St George's Episcopal Church, Edinburgh, with a superimposed lacy decoration in the manner of a Cambridge college chapel. This form was echoed at his Cockpen church tower in East Lothian (1818). Miscellaneous works include the Grecian mausoleum in Callendar Park, Falkirk (1816), unexecuted plans to restore St Giles, Edinburgh (1817), court rooms in Parliament House (1818), an extension to 35 St Andrew's Square, Edinburgh (1819), houses in Leith (1820), and Blair Atholl church (1823). To judge by the substantial debts owed to him by the duke of Atholl and John Pringle, and lesser sums by the earl of Morton, Admiral Mowbray, Sir James Montgomery, the marquess of Lothian, the earls of Eglinton and Minto, and Robert Fraser (never mind the heritors of Blair Atholl and Inveresk), he was working on a number of projects at his death. In December 1822 the directors of Inverness Academy sought a design from Elliot, expecting him to visit in the next few months, but he died at Calton Hill, Edinburgh, on 16 June 1823, aged sixty-one. He was buried in the new Calton cemetery, his wife returned to London, and the practice was carried on by his son Archibald.<br>
