<span class="headword">Strangman,  James</span>  (<em>c.</em>1555&#150;1595/6?), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was the second son of William Strangman (<i>d</i>. 1573) of Hadleigh, Essex, and his wife, Mary (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.1550&#150;1580), daughter of Sir Thomas Barnardiston, of Kedington, Suffolk. The Strangmans held other lands in Essex and were settled at Hadleigh by the fourteenth century. James matriculated as a pensioner of Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1572, but is not known to have graduated. That he attended university when his elder brother, Bartholomew, like other members of the family, was entered at Lincoln's Inn in London suggests that he may have been intended for the church. If so he struck an independent line, and seems to have established himself in the capital, devoting himself to historical studies.<br>
<br>Strangman's life is obscure and was apparently short: he was alive in 1592, and is said to have died in 1595 or 1596. He seems not to have held public office, but he had access to the public records and to other archives and read them closely. In a letter which he drafted to George Boleyn, dean of Lichfield, seeking permission to work in the cathedral library, he described himself as a lover of antiquities and as hoping particularly to find chronicles and histories. His chief interest was probably in the history of Essex, but contemporary references to his work show that he took note of other material and was generous with his findings. He was a member of the Elizabethan Society of Antiquaries in 1591. He communicated notes on manors in Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire to Robert Glover, Somerset herald, and he told the Pembrokeshire antiquary George Owen of a reference to Kemes in the red book of the exchequer. He probably owned Old Hall manuscript (BL, Add. MS 57950), a major compendium of medieval music, at some time in his career.<br>
<br>Strangman was apparently the first antiquary to study Essex. Nathanael Salmon (1675&#150;1742) and Philip Morant (1700&#150;1770) both acknowledged indebtedness to him, the former acclaiming him as &#145;a great Collector of Antiquities for this County&#146;  (Salmon, 360). Strangman clearly understood the importance of public records as a source of local history. It seems likely that the bulk of his manuscripts, of which only a few examples remain, were later incorporated with those of Thomas Jekyll (1570&#150;1653); these then passed through the hands of William Holman to Salmon and Morant. Those successors all respected him as a pioneer.<br>
