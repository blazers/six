<span class="headword">Werden,  Robert</span>  (1621/2&#150;1690), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the son of John Werden (<i>d</i>. 1646), attorney, of Chester, and his wife, Katherine, daughter of Edward Dutton, governor of Barbados. He was aged fifteen when he matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, in 1637. Roger North described John Werden as &#145;an incomparable courtier, cavalier, and a most faithful servant in the royal family&#146;  (North, 374). Following his father's example, Werden was one of the most active royalists in Cheshire during the early 1640s, serving as colonel of a troop of horse under John Byron, first Baron Byron. He took part in the defence of Chester, but was wounded and taken prisoner at Christleton on 18 January 1645. His father assisted in the negotiations for the surrender of the town, and signed the articles of surrender on 3 February 1646. On 26 March John Werden begged to be permitted to compound for his delinquency. The commissioners for compounding accepted this application, and, although he had not come in within the prescribed terms, they only imposed on him the small fine of &pound;600. When their sentence was confirmed by the House of Commons on 9 July, Robert was included in the composition, causing the Cheshire county committee to protest that Robert had caused &#145;general astonishment and terror to the whole country&#146;  (Green, 1154). Parliament, however, upheld the original decision and he was finally cleared by an ordinance of February 1647, by which time his father was dead. In 1648, however, his estates were again sequestered on the suspicion that he harboured treasonable designs, a fifth being allowed his wife for maintenance. They were discharged for a second time on 27 January 1652.<br>
<br>So far Werden had seemed a steadfast royalist, but there is evidence that from the mid-1650s he was playing a double game. In April 1655, in the aftermath of Penruddock's rising, during which he had been arrested, he told John Thurloe that he had offered the protectoral government his assistance before the rebellion. Later that year he asked for his decimation assessment to be waived in view of unspecified past services  (Thurloe, 3.337, 4.315&#150;16). Other members of the royalist underground were suspicious, and their doubts about him became all the stronger when he participated in the ill-fated uprising organized by Sir George Booth in August 1659. Werden was arrested and his estates sequestered for a third time. When, on his release, he joined the court in exile, Roger Whitley denounced him as the traitor who had betrayed their cause, but by March 1660 Charles II had accepted his professions of innocence. After the Restoration he sought a pardon for his erratic loyalties in the 1650s and gained the endorsement of Booth. The claims by Cromwell's spymaster Thomas Scott that Werden had tried to betray the king in 1651 and that he had indeed betrayed Booth in 1659 were ignored.<br>
<br>The doubts about his past loyalty failed to hamper him after 1660. The lands in Pembrokeshire belonging to the regicide Thomas Wogan were granted to him, and by 1661 he had become one of the duke of York's grooms of the bedchamber. This link with York then served to advance his military career. On 4 June 1665 he was appointed a lieutenant in York's regiment of guards. He was later promoted, becoming a major on 29 June 1667 and a lieutenant-colonel on 2 October 1672. On 10 February 1673 he was returned to parliament for Chester, retaining his seat until the dissolution in 1679. He sat again for this constituency in 1685. On 1 May 1678 he received the commission of brigadier of the horse, and in the summer served in Flanders against the Dutch. From 1675 he served as comptroller of York's household.<br>
<br>In 1685, in the reshuffle of his senior servants following his accession, James II rewarded Werden with the office of treasurer and receiver-general to the queen. Other appointments soon followed. On 19 June 1685 he was promoted to become the senior brigadier in the army, and on 31 July was appointed major-general. On 24 October he received the command of a regiment of horse (later the 4th dragoon guards), and on 8 November 1688 attained the rank of lieutenant-general. James's trust in him was well founded&#151;until the king's flight in December 1688 Werden remained loyal to him.<br>
<br>Werden was twice married: first, before 1640, to Jane Barnham; secondly, before 1679, to Margaret Towse. By his first marriage he was the father of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29063/', "Sir John Werden")</script>; Robert, a captain in the Royal Navy, who was killed fighting against the Dutch at Sole Bay on 28 May 1673 while in command of the <i>Henrietta</i>; and Katherine, who married Richard Watts of Muchmunden in Hertfordshire. Werden died on 23 January 1690.<br>
