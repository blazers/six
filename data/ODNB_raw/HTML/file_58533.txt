<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fairbairn, Sir  Nicholas Hardwick</span>  (1933&#150;1995), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was born on 24 December 1933 at 18 Lansdowne Crescent, Edinburgh, the third surviving child and younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40312/', "(William) Ronald Dodds Fairbairn (1889&#150;1964)")</script>, psychotherapist and psychoanalyst, and his wife, Mary Ann (<i>d</i>. 1952), daughter of Henry More Gordon of Charleton and Kinnaber, Angus. His father was a psychoanalyst of international repute, but the life of the family became overshadowed by his strained relations with his wife. Fairbairn was educated at Loretto School (1941&#150;51) and the University of Edinburgh (1951&#150;4), where he first followed his father in studying medicine, but switched to classics. He then read for the bar, being admitted in 1957. He early developed interests in conservation and in culture. He founded the Society for the Preservation of Duddingston Village, a picturesque suburb of Edinburgh where his family lived. He began painting and sold his first picture as a student. He overcame the penury of devilling by putting on a one-man exhibition which earned &pound;2000.<br>
<br>Fairbairn's career did not take off until 1960, when he was instructed as junior counsel for the defence in a celebrated trial for the &#145;Calton murder&#146;; he made a flamboyant appearance which did not quite save his client, and this became a frequent experience. His most famous defence was of Patrick Meehan, wrongly sentenced for murder in 1969 but pardoned in 1976 after a long campaign in which Fairbairn also took a leading role. Exposure to the seamy side of Scotland seemed to be making a social liberal of him. He became an active campaigner for birth-control, a subject still <i>risqu&eacute;</i> in staid Edinburgh. The city's bourgeoisie was also regularly shocked by avant-garde productions in the annual festival of the arts, which Fairbairn loved. One year, after a &#145;happening&#146; featured a nude young lady being pushed across a stage in a trolley, the procurator fiscal decided to prosecute the offenders, but Fairbairn defended them successfully. On 29 September 1962 he married Elizabeth Mary (<i>b</i>. 1938), daughter of Aeneas Alexander Mackay, thirteenth Lord Reay and chief of the clan Mackay (1905&#150;1963), and his wife, Charlotte Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Younger (<i>d</i>. 1963). The Fairbairns bought and restored the ruined castle of Fordell in Fife. They had a son and four daughters, of whom the son and a daughter died in infancy, before the marriage was dissolved in 1979.<br>
<br>Fairbairn became a queen's counsel in 1972, and entered parliament after Sir Alec Douglas-Home stood down from his seat of Kinross and West Perthshire at the general election of October 1974. In a traditional Conservative constituency, Fairbairn, known as a maverick dandy, won nomination against the odds. This came during an upsurge of Scottish nationalism, and he held the seat by just fifty-three votes. In later polls he raised his majorities. At Westminster he surprised many by aligning himself with the right. He supported Margaret Thatcher's bid for the Conservative leadership in 1975. His reward came with the post of solicitor-general for Scotland in her first ministry in 1979. But office did not suit him. Now divorced, he was at the centre of a scandal in 1981: there were allegations that he had had an affair with a secretary at the House of Commons and that she was later found trying to hang herself from a lamp-post outside his home in London. Responsible for prosecutions by the crown, in 1982 he exercised his powers not to arraign a gang of men who had raped a woman in Glasgow. This ugly case ended in a successful private prosecution by her, a rarity in Scotland. Fairbairn compounded his misjudgement by announcing to the press, not to parliament, that he had lacked evidence to indict. On 28 January 1982 he was obliged to resign.<br>
<br>On 28 May 1983 Fairbairn married Suzanne Mary MacInnes (<i>b</i>. 1942), daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Hilary George Wheeler of the Baluch regiment. For the wedding at Fordell Castle, Fairbairn designed clothes for both bride and groom in styles of princely India. This ceremony set the tone for the colourful remainder, which was also the prime, of his life. His ministerial career never resumed and he was hardly, except in his own eyes, taken seriously as a politician. But he found his <i>m&eacute;tier</i> as an independent back-bencher. His appearance at Westminster in bizarre, often tartan, costumes signalled his resolve to act and speak in his own way. He did not hesitate to rebel over such matters as saving Scottish regiments, and later over Europe. He also did sterling work in causes close to his heart, as in his chairmanship of the Historic Buildings Council for Scotland from 1988, in which year he was also knighted. He gave a great impression of zest for life, summed up in his entries in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span>, changed for every edition: &#145;drawing ships, making quips, confounding Whips, scuttling drips&#146; was the last  (<span class="italic">WW</span>, 1995, 174). He became, in short, a popular eccentric. Much of his humour, as of his acerbity, was unfortunately fuelled by drink. He contracted cirrhosis of the liver and died at Queen Margaret Hospital, Dunfermline, on 19 February 1995. He was buried on 22 February in the crypt of the chapel at Fordell Castle. A memorial service was held at St John's Kirk, Perth, on 3 March, at which Baroness Thatcher read from Kahlil Gibran's <span class="italic">The Prophet</span>. Fairbairn was survived by both wives and by three daughters of his first marriage.<br>
