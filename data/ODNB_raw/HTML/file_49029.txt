<span class="headword">Nugent,  Christopher Robert</span>  (1852?&#150;1926), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was probably born at Bruges, Belgium, one of six children and the eldest son of Robert Nugent and Emma, daughter of John Hunter. The family was of Irish descent and included among its forebears the statesman and political philosopher Edmund Burke, who in 1757 had married Jane Nugent, the daughter of his physician. When Christopher was six the children were orphaned and taken to England to be educated.<br>
<br>Nugent's City career began in 1870 when, at the age of eighteen, he joined the discount firm of Grigg &amp; Co. Here he learned the business of dealing in bills of exchange that was to be his life's work. His exceptional ability quickly brought him to prominence and in 1879 he accepted an invitation to become deputy manager of the United Discount Corporation. In the following year he was made manager and thus at the age of twenty-seven took control of a major joint-stock discount company.<br>
<br>United Discount was a &#145;reconstruction&#146; of a discount company that had suffered in the crisis of 1866. In 1885 it merged with another &#145;reconstruction&#146;, the General Credit and Discount Company, to form the Union Discount Company of London Ltd, with Nugent as the first manager. Here he found full scope for his financial genius and during the thirty-seven years in which he guided the company's fortunes he established Union Discount as the leading house in the market. Such was his personal standing that in the early years the company was more usually referred to as &#145;Nugent's&#146;  (King, 261 n. 4).<br>
<br>Success in the discount business depended on the dealer's ability to assess correctly the quality of bills offered for discount and in this Nugent was an acknowledged master. It was said that he was able to &#145;sense good paper&#146;  (Cleaver and Cleaver, 58), though in reality his judgement was informed by a minute knowledge, tirelessly accumulated, of the names on bills. He corresponded regularly with bankers worldwide and supplemented the knowledge thus gained of local conditions by means of annual trips abroad. For all the seriousness of his approach to business and the strict code of conduct he required of his clerks, Nugent was nevertheless a popular figure in the market, noted for the &#145;geniality and infectious gaiety of disposition&#146; that endeared him to a very wide circle of friends  (<span class="italic">Banker's Magazine</span>, June 1926, 912).<br>
<br>It was inevitable that Nugent's views would be sought on important issues of the day. In 1910 he gave evidence to the national monetary commission in the USA (the Aldrich commission), and in 1918 he represented the market before the Treasury committee on bank amalgamations (the Colwyn committee) and the committee on currency and foreign exchanges after the war (the Cunliffe committee). More immediately, he played a prominent part in the affairs of the discount market. He was chairman of the London Discount Houses Committee, which from before the First World War met to discuss the setting of interest rates, and of the sub-committee established in 1914 to liaise with the Bank of England. He was also the first chairman of the London Discount Market Association, which replaced the committee in 1919.<br>
<br>Nugent, who was married and had a family, retired in 1922, on reaching the age of seventy. In retirement he maintained contact with the company through retention of his seat on the board, to which he had been elected in 1909. The rest of his time he divided between his houses in Pinner, where a road&#151;Nugent's Park&#151;was named after him, and at Totland Bay, Isle of Wight. He also continued to travel extensively abroad.<br>
<br>Nugent was taken ill while returning from a stay in Ceylon, and he developed pneumonia soon after reaching home. He died at 14 Berkeley Square, Mayfair, London, on 27 April 1926 and was widely mourned, not least by the older members of the market who remembered him as &#145;the last of the Victorians&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 28 April 1926).<br>
