<span class="headword">Stapleton,  Augustus Granville</span>  (1800/01&#150;1880), <span class="occ">biographer and political pamphleteer</span>, was entered on 18 September 1814 in the register of Rugby School as &#145;son of John Stapleton, esq., and ward of the Rev. T. Yeoman, Barnstaple, Devon, aged 13&#146;  (<span class="italic">Rugby School Register from 1675 to 1867 Inclusive</span>, 1867, 1.120). It was, however, said that he was an illegitimate son of John Parker, first earl of Morley  (Jekyll, 226), a close friend of Canning. Stapleton was entered at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, on 22 February 1817, but did not take up his residence there, and on 14 October 1818 was admitted pensioner at St John's College, Cambridge. He graduated BA in 1823. On 30 June 1825 he married Catherine, second daughter of John Bulteel of Flete, Devon, who died at Kensington on 18 June 1856; they had three sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>After leaving university Stapleton became the private secretary of Canning, and was admitted into his closest confidence, enjoying long conversations in which the statesman recounted his career and explained his policies. In 1827 Stapleton was with Canning when he caught his fatal cold at the duke of York's funeral, and was present at his deathbed at Chiswick. On the personal instructions of George IV, out of respect for the memory of Canning, Stapleton was appointed a commissioner of customs on 31 August 1827. This appointment he vacated in 1831. Stapleton's own parliamentary ambitions were unfulfilled. In 1837 he contested Birmingham in the Conservative interest, and, though he was an able orator, was badly beaten. From 1845 he was a leading figure in the National Club, formed as a focus for political protestantism, but the organization never achieved the degree of prominence Stapleton sought for it.<br>
<br>Stapleton's main distinction was as a writer, committed above all to upholding the memory of his late employer. In 1830 his <span class="italic">Political Life of George Canning, 1822&#150;1827</span> was ready for publication. However, its contents were potentially politically explosive and representations on behalf first of the duke of Wellington and later of Earl Grey caused Stapleton initially to delay and then to make cuts in the work. It eventually appeared in 1831. In 1859 he published <span class="italic">George Canning and his Times</span>, which, like the previous work, is a valuable primary source for Canning's career. In continuance of the subject, Stapleton subsequently contributed to <span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span> (26, May 1872 25&#150;32) an article entitled &#145;A month at Seaford in 1825 with Canning and Hookham Frere&#146;, and three more of his papers appeared in volume 31 (1874&#150;5) of the same periodical. Stapleton also published numerous expositions of his sometimes idiosyncratic opinions in pamphlet form, on Ireland, parliamentary reform, and British foreign policy. In <span class="italic">The Real Monster Evil of Ireland</span> (1843), which he considered to be over-population, he advocated a &pound;16 million programme of public works. His <span class="italic">Suggestions for a Conservative and Popular Reform in the Commons</span> (1850) was a plea for direct representation of the professional classes and of the arts and sciences. A petition to this effect on behalf of the learned professions was drawn up by Stapleton and George Harris, and presented by Lord Harrowby to the House of Lords on 27 May 1852. It produced a long speech from Lord Derby (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 121.1181&#150;92; cf. Harris, 184&#150;91). <span class="italic">Hostilities at Canton (Guangzhou)</span> (1857) was a concentrated statement of the case against Lord Palmerston's government, and led, in its author's opinion, to the defeat of the ministry. His effusions on foreign affairs were collected in <span class="italic">Intervention and Non-Intervention, or, The Foreign Policy of Great Britain, 1790&#150;1865</span> (1866).<br>
<br>Stapleton was possessed of aristocratic pretensions and a certain arrogance, softened by personal kindness. He was a parishioner and close friend of Charles Kingsley. He died at Drymoor, Warbrook, Eversley, Hampshire, on 26 February 1880. His youngest son, Edward J. Stapleton (1839/40&#150;1896), of the Home Office, edited in 1887 two volumes of <span class="italic">Official Correspondence of George Canning</span>, the second of which contained numerous letters to and from his father in 1826 and 1827.<br>
