<span class="headword">Barlow,  William Hagger</span>  (1833&#150;1908), <span class="occ">dean of Peterborough</span>, born at Matlock on 5 May 1833, was the younger son (of five children) of Henry Barlow, curate in charge of Dethick, near Matlock, and afterwards vicar of Pittsmoor, Sheffield, and his wife, Elizabeth, only daughter of John Hagger, of Sheffield. William, sent first to the grammar school and then to the collegiate school at Sheffield, won a school exhibition and a scholarship in classics at St John's College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in October 1853. He took honours in four triposes&#151;a rare achievement (sixteenth junior optime and third in second class, classical tripos, 1857; second in first class, moral sciences tripos, and second class in theological examinations, 1858). He also won the Carus Greek Testament (bachelors') prize, 1858. He proceeded MA in 1860 and BD in 1875. Incorporated MA of Oxford through Christ Church (1874), he proceeded BD and DD there in 1895.<br>
<br>Barlow was ordained deacon on 30 May 1858 and priest on 10 June 1859, serving the curacy of St James, Bristol. When the new ecclesiastical district of St Bartholomew was formed out of this poor parish and a church built in 1861, he was the first vicar (1861&#150;73). On 15 August 1861 he married Eliza Mary, eldest daughter of Edward Pote Williams of Upton Park, Slough (she died on 4 October 1905). She played an important part in his parish missions. After a brief incumbency of St Ebbe's, Oxford (1873&#150;5), he was appointed in 1875 by the committee of the Church Missionary Society principal of their college in Upper Street, Islington, London, for the training of missionaries. Barlow quickly succeeded in improving the numbers and course of training. In 1883 he helped to collect &pound;18,000 for the enlargement of the society's headquarters in Salisbury Square.<br>
<br>In 1882 Barlow was appointed vicar of St James, Clapham, London, and in 1887 was promoted by the trustees at the wish of the evangelical leaders to the vicarage of Islington, the &#145;blue ribbon&#146; of their patronage. Barlow's tenure of this important benefice greatly strengthened his influence as an evangelical leader. He was a rural dean and was made trustee of the Peache, the Aston, and the Sellwood Church patronage trusts, which governed about 200 English and Welsh benefices. He became one of the chief founts of patronage in the Church of England of his day. The annual Islington clerical meeting, founded in a small way at the vicarage by Bishop Daniel Wilson in 1827, greatly expanded after Barlow took over its management in 1888, and it became the rallying point of the evangelicals. From 1887 to 1894 he was official chairman of the Islington vestry, and when the <span class="roman">Local Government Act</span> of 1894 took away the right of the vicar, the vestry continued to elect him to the chair from 1895 to 1899, entitling him to be JP for London.<br>
<br>Barlow, who was made a prebendary in St Paul's Cathedral by Bishop Mandell Creighton in 1898, accepted in May 1901 Lord Salisbury's offer of the deanery of Peterborough. Though a convinced evangelical, he attempted no changes in the manner of service at the cathedral, contenting himself with taking the north-end position at holy communion. He raised money for repairs in the north transept and the clerestory of the choir.<br>
<br>While actively engaged in the management of the chief evangelical, missionary, and educational institutions, Barlow was a member of Bishop Creighton's round-table conference at Fulham Palace on the holy communion (1900); served on the prayer-book revision committee of the lower house of Canterbury convocation which was appointed on 15 February 1907; was examining chaplain (1883&#150;1900) to J. C. Ryle, bishop of Liverpool; and was select preacher at both Oxford and Cambridge. He was one of the promoters of Ridley Hall, Cambridge, and was on its council until 1908. He mainly owed his wide influence to his shrewd advice, his knowledge of men, and his ability to draw out opinions from others without parading his own. He died at the deanery, Peterborough, on 10 May 1908, and was buried beside his wife on the south side of the cathedral.<br>
<br>The Barlows had three sons and three daughters. The eldest son, Henry Theodore Edward Barlow (1862&#150;1906), was honorary canon of Carlisle and rector of Lawford, Essex. The second son, <a name="cosubject_57862"></a><span class="headword">Sir (Clement) Anderson  Montague-Barlow</span>, baronet  (1868&#150;1951)<span class="occ"></span>, was educated at Repton School and King's College, Cambridge (where he obtained a first class in law), and became a barrister. He was on London county council, 1907&#150;10, and was Conservative MP for South Salford, 1910&#150;23. He raised the Salford brigade of Lancashire Fusiliers in 1914 and was knighted in 1918. He was a delegate at the international labour conferences, 1920&#150;21, and, after being parliamentary secretary to the Ministry of Labour, 1920&#150;22, was its minister, 1922&#150;4, being sworn of the privy council in 1922. He chaired the royal commission on location of industry, 1937&#150;40. Throughout his life he was an active Anglican layman and chaired the house of laity of the church assembly in 1945&#150;6. He was created a baronet in 1924 and adopted the name of Montague in 1946.<br>
<br>Barlow published several works, including <span class="italic">Church and Reform</span> (1902) and <span class="italic">Barlow Family Records</span> (2 vols., 1932&#150;5), and many commentaries on statutes, including those on education (1902), old-age pensions (1908), dock legislation (1910), and war pensions (1918). In 1934 he married Doris Louise, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Reed, formerly an administrator in the WRAF. Montague-Barlow died on 31 May 1951 and, being childless, his title became extinct.<br>
