<span class="headword">Bielenberg,  Christabel Mary Harmsworth</span>  (1909&#150;2003), <span class="occ">author</span>, was born on 18 June 1909 at the Old House, Totteridge, Hertfordshire, the elder daughter and second of the four children of Percy Collingwood Burton (1879&#150;1953), advertising executive, and his wife, Christabel Rose, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Harmsworth (1879/80&#150;1967), youngest daughter of Alfred Harmsworth, lawyer, of Dublin. &#145;Chrismary&#146;, as her family called her, to distinguish her from her mother, had a comfortable childhood. Her father was a lively Anglo-Irishman who, after service in the South African War, founded an advertising agency that eventually formed part of the London Press Exchange, of which he became vice-chairman; he was also chairman of the World's Press News Publishing Company. Her maternal uncles included Alfred Charles William Harmsworth, Viscount Northcliffe, and Harold Sidney Harmsworth, first Viscount Rothermere.<br>
<br>Christabel Burton was tall, athletic, and bright, and she enjoyed her girls' public school, St Margaret's, Bushey. However, she decided not to go to university. She had at least one season as a d&eacute;butante and also went to finishing school in Paris. She played golf and sometimes partnered her father, a lifelong golf enthusiast (and president of the English Golf Union in 1936 and again in 1937), in competitions. She spent time in Ireland with her friend Gwennie McCormack at Moore Abbey in co. Kildare. There they sang duets and were sometimes joined by Gwennie's father, the plangent Irish tenor John McCormack. In 1932 she went to Hamburg, Germany, to train her voice with Alma Schadow and learn the language.<br>
<br>When she first arrived in Hamburg Christabel Burton expressed some uncertainties in her letters home, but these were dissipated soon afterwards when she met a German law student, Peter Heinrich Wilhelm Bielenberg (1911&#150;2001), the son of Paul Hermann Bielenberg, lawyer. He was tall, striking-looking, and athletic. They danced together divinely and soon they were engaged&#151;despite rumbles of opposition from both families. Not long after they had met, Peter had taken her to an open-air Hitler rally at Hagenbeck's zoo in Hamburg. The Nazi razzmatazz of drum-rolls and political anthems was too much for him. Christabel had barely begun to decipher the F&uuml;hrer's Austrian-accented rant when Peter spirited her out of the meeting, saying &#145;You may think that the Germans are political idiots, Chris, and you may be right, but of one thing I can assure you, they won't be so stupid as to fall for that clown&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Past is Myself</span>, 21&#150;2). Not long afterwards Hitler was installed as chancellor.<br>
<br>Against this ominous background Christabel and Peter were married on 29 September 1934 (in London, where Peter worked briefly at the German embassy), and Christabel duly became a German citizen. As the young couple settled down in Hamburg her new compatriots began to fall ever further under the spell of the ruthless demagogue. Peter continued his law studies in Hamburg while Christabel was attempting to play, never quite successfully, the role of the domestically accomplished German <i>Hausfrau</i>. (Some Harmsworth money, filtering through to her from a trust fund, made life more comfortable for the young couple.)<br>
<br>The price of Nazi economic stability soon became apparent as minorities were targeted and informers started to undermine the social fabric of Germany. Peter disliked the Nazis so much that on his graduation he refused to swear the necessary oath of loyalty to Hitler. He managed, nevertheless, to practise in his father's law firm for a time. But then, when one of his clients was acquitted in court of a political crime but abducted immediately by two uniformed men outside the courtroom, he decided he could no longer practise as a lawyer. He and Christabel considered emigrating permanently to Ireland; she even went there to have a look at some possible farms. But in the end they were talked out of it by their good friend Adam von Trott, who felt they should stay and resist Hitler. In February 1939 Peter took a job in the department of trade and industry in Berlin. By now they had two children&#151;Nicholas (<i>b</i>. 1935) and John (<i>b</i>. 1937)&#151;and they lived in a charming house in the suburb of Dahlem. They soon found themselves part of a group of dissidents. On risky trips to Britain in 1939 von Trott made desperate efforts to persuade the British government to hold back a little longer before confronting Hitler, but he&#151;and Peter, who made one similar foray&#151;were largely disregarded.<br>
<br>When war broke out on 3 September 1939, Hitler and his people became locked together in a self-destructive embrace which the dissidents knew would now be almost impossible to break. Not knowing what was best for the family, Christabel briefly took the children to Denmark and Austria, but as the phoney war continued, returned to Berlin. Peter did not want to fight for this travesty of the country he loved. Undrafted, he moved briefly to the German foreign office&#151;where he fell out with a senior Nazi&#151;then back to trade and industry. There he was assigned to manage a fish-paste factory in Norway, and although a third child, Christopher, arrived in 1942, Christabel saw very little of Peter over the next three years. Alone in an increasingly tense Berlin, Christabel briefly sheltered a young Jewish couple. Eventually, as British and American air raids worsened, she and Peter decided that she should take the children out of the city permanently, so in 1943 they set off for Rohrbach, a village in the Black Forest. She nevertheless made long expeditions on impossible trains to see Peter in Norway, and to Berlin to check on the house in Dahlem. In early 1944 she experienced the full force of a raid on the city but managed to meet von Trott, who hinted that now the dissidents had only one option left&#151;the assassination of Hitler.<br>
<br>Then, back in the Black Forest, on a beautiful day in August 1944, Christabel heard that the July putsch had failed and that Peter (who had not been involved in planning it, but had been implicated through his connection with von Trott) was in prison. She briefly collapsed, but she had no option but to recover and try to find out what had happened to her husband. She went first to Munich and then, on Christmas eve, to Berlin, where she had to sprint for safety as the allied raids devastated the city. She found out that Peter was not far away, in Ravensbr&uuml;ck concentration camp. She pulled strings through friendly Nazi acquaintances and managed to visit him. There she was able to convey to him that von Trott was dead, so Peter had no need to lie any more to protect his friend. Peter also managed to pass her a message&#151;enclosed in a cigarette box&#151;which gave details of what he had said about his involvement with Adam. This proved useful when Christabel achieved an interview with the Gestapo at their partially bombed headquarters in Prinz Albrecht Strasse. By sheer force of personality&#151;judiciously mixed with a little blackmail involving her press baron connections in London&#151;she made the Gestapo listen. Astonishingly, after some further bureaucratic delays, Peter was released from Ravensbr&uuml;ck. He was supposed to go to a punishment camp, but managed to slip away and was soon in the Black Forest. There he lived in the woods near Rohrbach and slept in a farmhouse, until at last the area was overrun by the allies.<br>
<br>The next three years were a time of uncertainty. Peter was keen to contribute to the new Germany, but Christabel felt she could not bear to live there again. She worked briefly as an <span class="italic">Observer</span> correspondent in Germany, then returned to England. Mindful of the widows and orphans of those who did not survive the July plot, she, with the help of David Astor, Victor Gollancz, and Lady Cripps, set up a charity to provide food and clothing for them. But life in austere, exhausted post-war Britain did not appeal to either Christabel or Peter when he finally arrived towards the end of 1946. Problems multiplied: she became ill and he had a serious motor-cycle accident. Eventually, in 1948, they resolved their uncertainties&#151;by putting into action their long-conceived plan of emigrating to Ireland. They bought the sizeable but dilapidated Munny House at Tullow, co. Carlow, some fifty miles south-west of Dublin. With the aid of <span class="italic">Teach Yourself Farming</span> Peter turned himself into a farmer who transformed the exhausted soil into rich and profitable land. The longest and most peaceful era of Christabel's life followed. But she was far from inactive. The orphans of the July plot came to visit; she became involved in the very early days of the peace process in Northern Ireland; and she worked hard to foster mutual understanding and reconciliation between Britain and Germany.<br>
<br>Christabel Bielenberg's extraordinary Nazi decade might have passed quietly into family history had she not decided&#151;prompted by a request for help with a biography of Adam von Trott&#151;to write about it. Her memoir, <span class="italic">The Past is Myself</span> (1968) was written from a unique point of view. As she put it in her foreword: &#145;I am English; I was German, and above all I was there.&#146; The first-time writer revealed a novelist's skill with place and character. There was a marvellously vivid account of life in Berlin and the Black Forest; and her portrait of Adam von Trott, with his daunting charm and intelligence, was perfectly rendered. There was pleasant self-deprecation and social comedy, often black, at the expense of the foibles of low-level Nazis; and she was note-perfect in her accounts of the most breathtaking and painful moments of the drama. The book was well reviewed and became a slow-burning best-seller over the next twenty years, culminating in a television version, <span class="italic">Christabel</span> (1988), written by Dennis Potter and starring Elizabeth Hurley. Demand from readers wanting to know what happened after 1945 prompted a sequel, <span class="italic">The Road Ahead</span> (1992), which added interesting insights into the family's immediate post-war difficulties but inevitably lacked the intensity of the first book.<br>
<br>In 1988 Christabel Bielenberg was made a commander of the German Federal Order of Merit and given a gold medal of merit by the European parliament. Her eyesight failed in her later years, but she and her beloved Peter smoked and socialized with determination until he died on 13 March 2001. She succumbed to bronchopneumonia on 2 November 2003 at Munny House. Three days later, at her funeral in the little protestant church of Saint Columba's in Tullow, she was mourned by her three tall sons, a numerous extended family, and some of the children of those who had tried&#151;and failed&#151;to rid Germany of Adolf Hitler.<br>
