</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hackett, Sir  John Winthrop</span>  (1910&#150;1997), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 5 November 1910 in Perth, Western Australia, the only son and one of five children of Sir (John) Winthrop Hackett (1848&#150;1916), newspaper proprietor and politician, and his wife, Deborah Vernon (1887&#150;1965), daughter of Frederick Slade Drake-Brockman and his wife, Grace Vernon (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Bussell). The family was of Norman&#150;Irish origin, descended from a William de Haket who had accompanied King John to Ireland and settled in co. Tipperary. Hackett's father had graduated at Trinity College, Dublin, and emigrated to Sydney in 1875. A lawyer and journalist, he became a wealthy newspaper proprietor in Western Australia, assisted in drafting the commonwealth constitution, and became the first chancellor of the University of Western Australia, an institution he richly endowed with buildings and scholarships. Hackett's mother was not only a leading society hostess and active welfare worker but a metallurgist and mining company director, who explored Australia for mineral resources in a single-seater plane and was instrumental in the development of tantalite and wolfram for industrial purposes. This formidable parentage was a major factor in young Hackett's decision to make his career outside his native country.<br>
<br>Hackett was educated at Geelong grammar school, Melbourne, from 1921 to 1928, and at New College, Oxford (1929&#150;33), which was to elect him to an honorary fellowship in 1972. He gained a second-class degree in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1932, and another in modern history the following year. Dissatisfied with an academic performance that he felt had not done him justice, and pursuing an intellectual interest fired by the career of T. E. Lawrence, he began research on Saladin's campaign in northern Syria during the third crusade for a BLitt degree that was eventually awarded in 1945. He never abandoned his academic ambitions: in later life he used to remark, to somewhat sceptical audiences, that his military career was simply the result of &#145;forty years' absence of mind&#146;  (personal knowledge).<br>
<br>Yet even before graduating Hackett had been commissioned, in 1931, into the 8th King's Royal Irish Hussars, a regiment with which he had a close family connection. Having been posted to Egypt, he was seconded in 1937 to the trans-Jordan frontier force, which enabled him to research the subject of his thesis on the ground, and to learn Arabic&#151;he was already fluent in German, French, and Italian&#151;in the intervals of campaigning at the height of the Arab uprising. After the outbreak of the Second World War he fought in the Syrian campaign in 1941, in which he was wounded, and was awarded a Military Cross. While convalescing on the shores of Lake Galilee he met Margaret, widow of Friedrich Grossman and daughter of Joseph Peter Frena of Graz, Austria. The fact that she was an &#145;enemy alien&#146; did not prevent him from wooing, winning, and marrying her in high style in St George's Cathedral, Jerusalem, on 21 March 1942. They had one daughter, Susan Veronica, and Hackett adopted his wife's two daughters from her first marriage, Bridget and Elizabeth.<br>
<br>After rejoining his regiment in the western desert Hackett was again wounded, and was appointed DSO. For a time he was occupied in organizing the light raiding forces such as the long range desert group and the Special Air Service, which were to play so distinctive a part in the campaign, before being selected, at the age of thirty-three, to raise and command the 4th Parachute brigade. The sequel was to be tragic. After briefly seeing action in Italy in September 1943 the brigade was posted back to the United Kingdom, only to be committed to the disastrous Arnhem operation in September 1944 and destroyed in a matter of hours. As Hackett himself put it, &#145;I had been its midwife and was now to be its sexton&#146;  (Hackett, 9). He himself was gravely wounded but escaped capture, to be hidden and nursed back to health by a friendly Dutch family, and eventually smuggled back to the British lines by the Dutch resistance. His account of his experiences, <span class="italic">I was a Stranger</span> (1977), was one of the most moving works of literature to emerge from the Second World War. For his exploits at Arnhem he was awarded a bar to his DSO.<br>
<br>After the war Hackett was posted back to the Middle East to command and, sadly, to disband the trans-Jordan frontier force. Typically he chose to spend his leave attending a postgraduate seminar in medieval studies on his wife's home territory at the University of Graz. The rest of his military career was to be spent in Europe, divided between postings in the United Kingdom and Germany, where he commanded 20th armoured brigade in 1954 and 7th armoured division in 1956&#150;8, before becoming commander-in-chief, British army of the Rhine, from 1966 to 1968. To each level of command he brought a quick, iconoclastic intelligence; a reluctance to suffer fools gladly, irrespective of their rank, that did not endear him either to his seniors or to some of his contemporaries; and a deep concern for the welfare of all under his command that made him immensely popular with his juniors&#151;and, no less important, their wives. In Germany he saw his task as being as much political as military, cementing Anglo-German friendship by encouraging links between the units under his command and the people among whom they lived. The command of the British army of the Rhine carried with it a NATO command, that of northern army group, which gave Hackett a degree of independence from his political masters in London that he relished and never hesitated to exploit when he thought it necessary. By the end of his career he was regarded throughout the army with admiration and affection, but his independence of spirit and unpredictability was probably to deny him the final accolade of becoming chief of the general staff.<br>
<br>Hackett was thus able in 1968, at the age of fifty-eight, to take up the academic career after which he had sometimes hankered. His appointment as principal of King's College, London, caused some surprise; but some senior members of the college had known and admired him when he had commanded the Royal Military College of Science between 1958 and 1961, while others hoped that the political skills he had honed in the corridors of Whitehall might be exercised to similar effect in the no less byzantine environment of the University of London. They were not to be disappointed, but Hackett himself did not find that the appointment provided the opportunity for scholarly research for which he had hoped. In addition to his heavy administrative responsibilities he found himself plunged into the thick of the student revolts that were sweeping Europe and the United States between 1967 and 1974. It was a challenge that he welcomed. He soaked himself in subversive literature, outwitted the radicals, astonished the student body by his deep interest in their affairs, and made the headlines by leading a march down Whitehall, immaculate in bowler hat and furled umbrella, demanding higher student grants. At the same time he became much in demand for lectures and media comments on military affairs&#151;a demand that he took relish in satisfying.<br>
<br>These demands absorbed Hackett's time after his retirement in 1975, though he staunchly denied that he had ever retired: he had, as he put it, &#145;simply withdrawn to a flank and regrouped&#146;  (personal knowledge). In 1978 he published a futuristic study, <span class="italic">The Third World War</span>, which, with its successor, <span class="italic">The Third World War: the Untold Story</span> (1981), enjoyed worldwide sales. He also published an illustrated edition of the elegant Lees Knowles lectures he had given in Cambridge in 1962, <span class="italic">The Profession of Arms</span> (1983). But he did not abandon his classical studies: he remained visiting professor in classics at King's College, and became president of both the Classical Association and the English Association. (His insistence on the correct use of the English language had not been the least of the qualities that had intimidated his military staffs.) Further honours were rained on him: he became colonel of his own regiment, the Queen's Royal Irish Hussars, and others, an honorary liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Dyers, a freeman of the City of London, and a deputy lieutenant of Gloucestershire. Honorary doctorates were bestowed on him by the universities of Western Australia, Exeter, and Buckingham. In 1985 he was awarded the Chesney gold medal of the Royal United Services Institution. He was a member of the lord chancellor's committee on reform of the law of contempt (1971&#150;4) and of the disciplinary tribunal of the inns of court and the bar (1972&#150;83).<br>
<br>Hackett looked every inch the professional soldier: short, compact, elegant, with a high colour and clipped moustache. Only his twinkling blue eyes hinted at the spirit of mischief lurking within that orthodox exterior. By the time of his death he had become a national figure, and&#151;in the words of his <span class="italic">Times</span> obituarist&#151;&#145;probably no man did as much as he to dispel the widely-held British belief that most generals are fools, and ignorant fools at that&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 10 Sept 1997). A portrait of him in uniform by Brenda Bury hangs in the regimental headquarters of the Queen's Royal Hussars, and one in academic robes by Michael Noakes at King's College, London.<br>
<br>In retirement Hackett lived at Coberley Mill, Gloucestershire, indulging in recreations he listed in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> as &#145;fishing, wine, music and the pursuit of exactitude, called by some pedantry&#146;, while, in his own words, &#145;having to do a fair bit of work more appropriate to a middle-aged peasant than to an elderly intellectual&#146;  (personal knowledge). He died at Coberley Mill on 9 September 1997 at the age of eighty-seven. His ashes were interred in the Hackett mausoleum at Karrakatta cemetery at Claremont, Perth. He was survived by his wife and two adopted daughters, the daughter of his marriage having predeceased him.<br>
