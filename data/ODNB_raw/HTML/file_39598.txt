<span class="headword">Lacey,  James Harry <span class="st"> [Ginger]</span></span>  (1917&#150;1989), <span class="occ">air force officer</span>, was born at Fairfield Villas, Wetherby, Yorkshire, on 1 February 1917, the son of Charles Lacey, a cattle dealer, and his wife, Mary Brown Smith. The later nickname Ginger came from his shock of carroty hair. He was educated from 1927 to 1933 at King James's Grammar School, Knaresborough, where he enjoyed sport and left with a school certificate. His father died in 1933 and Lacey, lacking interest in a farming career, trained as a pharmacist, passing intermediate exams in 1936. However, his heart was set on flying, so he joined the newly formed RAF volunteer reserve. He trained as a sergeant-pilot at Scone in Scotland, being the first on the course to fly solo, and passed out &#145;above average&#146;; he then flew on training sessions each weekend at Brough. With increasing experience on biplanes, from Tiger Moths to Hawker Harts, he was accepted in 1938 as an instructor with Yorkshire Airways Ltd. In January 1939 he was attached briefly to 1 squadron at Tangmere, where his keen eyesight and marksmanship were noted. When the squadron re-equipped with Hurricanes he soon flew one; he had then put in 250 hours of service flying.<br>
<br>Lacey was called up in September 1939 and joined 501 County of Gloucester auxiliary squadron at Filton as a sergeant-pilot. Their main action began on 10 May 1940 when they joined the air component of the British expeditionary force in France as the French campaign opened. The squadron was quickly under pressure from greater Luftwaffe numbers. Lacey made his mark on 13 May by shooting down a Messerschmitt Bf 109, a Heinkel He 111, and a Messerschmitt Bf 110 before breakfast, a feat rewarded with the French Croix de Guerre. By 18 June, when the squadron returned to England, he had scored five victories and had a narrow escape from a crash-landing.<br>
<br>During the battle of Britain, Lacey shot down a Bf 109 over the channel on 20 July. Then, flying from Gravesend, he was in regular action, flying up to six sorties daily and suffering their attendant stress. On 8 August he destroyed a Junkers Ju 87 Stuka and claimed two &#145;possibles&#146;. Four days later he accounted for two aircraft, and then another on the 24th. He was awarded the DFM on 23 August. On 30 August, while attacking Heinkel He 111s head-on, his aeroplane was hit and oil sprayed into the cockpit, yet he managed skilfully to coax his Hurricane back to Gravesend. By 5 September he had accounted for five further aircraft and was already a respected ace during the period of greatest pressure on Fighter Command, especially on 11 group.<br>
<br>On 13 September 1940 Lacey shot down a Heinkel He 111 which had earlier bombed Buckingham Palace. In the action his radiator was damaged and he baled out, suffering minor burns. In his log book he wrote a reminder to leave bombers alone: &#145;they are shooting me down much too often&#146;  (Bickers, 95). On the 15th he destroyed three enemy aircraft, but two days later he was himself shot down again and had to parachute to safety. By the end of October he claimed four more Bf 109s, and on 26 November he received a bar to his DFM.<br>
<br>During the battle Lacey achieved the RAF's top score, with eighteen aircraft destroyed. It was no coincidence that thirteen were Bf 109s, considered by Luftwaffe pilots to be comprehensively superior to the Hurricane. His boyish looks belying his years and experience, Lacey had scored with superb airmanship resulting from many hours of pre-war training. Sharp eyesight, gritty determination, and skilful shooting brought him success&#151;and a charmed life.<br>
<br>Although he was always content as a sergeant-pilot, in January 1941 Lacey was awarded a commission. He then flew on sorties over France, destroying four further aircraft, three of them Bf 109s. After 300 hours on active operations he was posted away to be an instructor with 57 operational training unit. In March 1942 he re-entered action with 602 squadron, then, after flying with them from Kenley, he moved on to 81 group as tactics officer. Later he experimented with rocket armament at Boscombe Down before going on to Northumberland and instructing in low-level attack.<br>
<br>An overseas posting arrived in March 1943 when Lacey sailed to India; later he took command of 17 squadron in Assam. Towards the end of the Burma campaign he led offensive operations against the Japanese, and he gained his final success in February 1945 by shooting down a Nakajima &#145;Oscar&#146;, bringing his total to twenty-eight. After the war he took his squadron to a base near Hiroshima in Japan, and was the first pilot to fly a Spitfire over that country.<br>
<br>During his voyage to India, Lacey had met (Maureen) Sheila Latchford on board ship. They married on 8 July 1945 at the Sacred Heart Church, Kodaikanal, and later had three daughters&#151;Diana, Wendy, and Susan.<br>
<br>Back in Britain, Lacey was awarded a permanent commission and stayed in the RAF. He served variously as a fighter controller in Hong Kong, the Isle of Man, and Burma, flew early jets, and worked as an instructor at home and abroad. In March 1967 he retired, as a squadron leader. Later he ran a small air-freight business and taught budding pilots to fly in Yorkshire; they could have had no better tutor.<br>
<br>Lacey died from cancer at Castle Hill Hospital, Nottingham, on 30 May 1989, and his funeral service was held in the priory church, Bridlington. A modest, yet independent and straightforward man, he was the finest exemplar of the many sergeant-pilots of the volunteer reserve who so ably served their country during the battle of Britain.<br>
