<span class="headword">Anthony,  Anthony</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1563), <span class="occ">military administrator</span>, was the son of William Anthony (<i>d</i>. 1535), a Fleming who was made denizen in 1503, and his wife, Joan. William was a citizen and brewer of London; his premises, The Ship in East Smithfield, passed to Anthony, apparently his only son. William Anthony supplied Henry VIII's court and army with beer in the 1520s; among his partners was Henry Janssen or Johnson, who also had a career in the royal ordnance, and no doubt helped to find Anthony a place there. On 4 October 1517 Anthony married Anne, daughter of William Roy (another brewer) and his wife, Adrian; a daughter, Barbara, born May 1519 and dying the following September, is Anthony's only recorded child.<br>
<br>Anthony was already a groom of the chamber when on 20 September 1530 he had the king's licence to export 200 tuns of beer annually. On 7 October 1533 he was appointed one of the gunners at the Tower, a post he retained for life. He must soon have ceased to exercise the duty in person as he rose in prominence in the ordnance office, also based at the Tower. It is uncertain when he first acquired a clerkship there, but by 1536 he was senior enough to deputize for the master, and following a reorganization in 1536/7 he emerged as clerk of the deliveries, one of two chief clerical posts. On 29 April 1537 he was named as one of the four founder masters of the body which came to be called the Honourable Artillery Company. He also began to deploy a graphic talent; one of several &#145;plats&#146; now ascribed to him illustrates a proposed route for Anne of Cleves's journey to England in 1539. His business interests meanwhile extended to include the export of cheese, and in March 1545 he was licensed to retain four journeymen above the statutory limit.<br>
<br>In summer 1545 Anthony's professional energies were stretched by urgent demands from the privy council for munitions to repel the threatened French invasion. Even then he may have been at work on his most ambitious composition: the three vellum rolls depicting the whole royal fleet and listing its ordnance (the Anthony roll, as it is confusingly called). The completed manuscript was presented to Henry VIII in 1546. On 23 January 1549 Edward VI advanced Anthony to the surveyorship of the ordnance, with his salary backdated to 1547. An early responsibility was the evacuation of weaponry from Boulogne when the town was returned to the French in 1550. In April 1552 Anthony was slightly hurt when one of the ammunition stores on Tower Hill exploded. His wife probably died on 11 April 1559; he subsequently married Alice, widow of John Norton. On 1 February 1560 he surrendered his patent of office, receiving a fortnight later a new grant in survivorship with Henry Iden. On 29 August 1562 he became a founding freeman of the Brewers' Company on its incorporation. The last months of his life were busy with the supply of munitions for the ill-fated Le Havre expedition. Anthony's will, made on 23 August 1563, was proved on 9 October; he was buried at St Botolph, Aldgate, London. His beneficiaries included fellow brewers and ordnance colleagues. His widow later married William Partridge, a gunmaker in the office.<br>
<br>Anthony's illuminated manuscript of Henry VIII's navy remained in the Royal Collection until 1680, when Charles II gave two of the rolls to Pepys; he had them bound as the volume which passed with the rest of his library to Magdalene College, Cambridge. The other roll was given by William IV to his daughter Lady Mary Fox, and was sold by her to the British Museum in 1857. Anthony also wrote or compiled other works; of these, a chronicle of the years 1522&#150;58 and an account of Elizabeth I's coronation alone survive, in copies made by the seventeenth-century collector Elias Ashmole.<br>
