<span class="headword">Craster, Sir  (Herbert Henry) Edmund</span>  (1879&#150;1959), <span class="occ">librarian and historian</span>, was born at the family seat, Beadnell Hall, Northumberland, on 5 November 1879, the third son (but only child of the second marriage) of Edmund Craster (1824&#150;1898), formerly of the Bengal civil service. His mother, who died a fortnight after Edmund's birth, was Barbara Stewart, daughter of the Revd H. T. Lee, of Dinas Powys, Glamorgan. He was educated at Clifton College and as a scholar of Balliol College, Oxford (1898&#150;1903), where he took first classes in Greats and in modern history, and in 1903 he was elected to a prize fellowship at All Souls College, to which he remained attached for the rest of his life. He married on 25 April 1912 a fellow Northumbrian, Alice Ida, only daughter of Gilfrid George Baker-Cresswell, of Preston Tower, Chathill. They had a son (who became an inspector of ancient monuments) and two daughters.<br>
<br>The Craster family had been established at Craster Tower, near Embleton, since the twelfth century, and Edmund Craster's Northumbrian affinities determined the course of his historical interests. His antiquarian ability showed itself early in mature and accomplished archaeological and numismatic articles stimulated particularly by the major Romano-British excavations of the time at Corstopitum (Corbridge). Craster's keen eye for detail and ability to discern the historical significance of archaeological or documentary evidence were put to good use as editor of volumes 8 to 10 (1907&#150;14) of the spaciously conceived <span class="italic">History of Northumberland</span>. The first two volumes, dealing with the south-east corner of the county, were dominated respectively by the regality and monastery of Tynemouth and by the history of the Delaval family of Seaton Delaval. Craster prepared the bulk of the text himself, efficiently marshalling charter and documentary materials. Volume 10, on Corbridge, was timely after an exciting period of excavation, and equally well prepared.<br>
<br>In 1912 Craster was appointed sub-librarian of the Bodleian Library in Oxford, working especially on the <span class="italic">Summary Catalogue of Western Manuscripts</span>, started by Falconer Madan. Craster was responsible for the volume on the more recent accessions (1924), and for those on the collections acquired by the university in the seventeenth century, published in 1922, and (with collaborators) in 1937. Discoveries made in the course of redescribing the manuscripts were published frequently in the <span class="italic">Bodleian Quarterly Record</span>. He was promoted keeper of Western manuscripts in 1927 and in 1931 succeeded Sir Arthur Cowley as Bodley's librarian.<br>
<br>Gross congestion and under-funding made it a very difficult time to have taken charge of the Bodleian. Craster had to see through a programme of library extension that had after prolonged discussion been agreed by the university. This deliberate and retiring scholar, who moreover suffered from a severe speech impediment, immediately showed himself thorough and decisive, good at delegation, and equal to the administrative tasks ahead. His own strong but dutifully understated preference had been for a completely new library on an extendable site then available, but he followed his curators' wishes in overseeing the construction of the &#145;New Bodleian&#146; bookstack at the end of Broad Street and its co-ordination with the existing central buildings. Designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott and built with substantial support from the Rockefeller Foundation, its foundation stone was laid in June 1937 and it was ready for opening by June 1940, though its official opening had to be postponed until 24 October 1946. Craster directed the systematic planning of the building with great skill. His sure touch was seen also in improvements in staffing levels and salaries, in the finances of the Bodleian, and in its catalogues. He retired under the age rule in 1945, and later wrote a <span class="italic">History of the Bodleian Library, 1845&#150;1945</span> (1952), a full and perspicacious account notable for its candour when dealing with recent events in Bodleian history.<br>
<br>In retirement Craster resumed historical work that had been decreased but never suspended during his library career, and he succeeded Sir Charles Oman as librarian of the Codrington Library at All Souls. There too he carried out some much needed reforms, including the reclassification of the books and the provision of a bookstack. At the time of his death, in Oxford on 21 March 1959, he had written much of <span class="italic">The History of All Souls College Library</span>, which was completed by E. F. Jacob and eventually published (with the text of Jacob's memorial address on Craster) in 1971.<br>
<br>Craster, who became a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1911, had taken a DLitt in 1916, and was awarded an honorary LittD by Cambridge in 1934. He was knighted in 1945. Several portraits of him by Augustus John exist, but the small carved head forming a corbel on the south exit of the Bodleian quadrangle is reckoned the best likeness of this great figure in the history of the Bodleian Library.<br>
