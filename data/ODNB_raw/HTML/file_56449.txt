<span class="headword">Weddington,  John</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1525, <em>d.</em> in or after 1593), <span class="occ">writer on bookkeeping</span>, was born in London. He was a citizen of London, a grocer, and member of the Merchant Adventurers of the English Nation in Antwerp. He spent many years in Antwerp as a merchant and, for a period, as factor of Sir Thomas Gresham. He also worked as a professional bookkeeper. He brought an action against one Baptist van Achelen for payment for more than a hundred days' work on his account books. He probably taught bookkeeping as well, Antwerp being the commercial centre which served as training ground for many youths, including young Englishmen bent on a mercantile career.<br>
<br>In 1567 Pieter van Keerberghen published in Antwerp Weddington's <span class="italic">A breffe instruction, and manner, howe to kepe, marchantes bokes, of accomptes after the order of debitor and creditor</span>. This rare work, of which only one copy is known (St Mary's College, Blairs, deposited in the National Library of Scotland), has several distinctive features. The major feature is the arrangement of account books in the double-entry system. In the standard procedure described in most of the early accounting manuals, all transactions were entered in a journal in which the entries in each case identified the ledger accounts to be debited and credited. From the journal, entries were then made in the relevant accounts in the ledger, Weddington's &#145;great boke or lidger&#146;. Weddington, in effect, dispensed with the journal and broke it up into several separate books, one for each of several categories of transaction. Entries in the ledger were to be made directly from the entries in those various books of first entry. Weddington explained that dismemberment of the journal as the ledger-posting medium was desirable &#145;because marchantis of great dowingis ought to have many servantes to helpe them to write&#146;.<br>
<br>Weddington also introduced the use of a secret ledger in the literature on accounting. In this ledger the merchant segregated those accounts, such as the capital account, that he wanted to keep secret from his employees who would, of course, need access in the ordinary course of business to the other non-secret ledger. In this way &#145;no man shall understande or knowe his estate, but hym selff only, or suche as he shall apoint to kepe&#146; the secret ledger. Weddington, &#145;for breviation&#146;, did not give an example of a secret ledger. James Peele, in his <span class="italic">Pathe Waye to Perfectnes</span> published two years later, provided a worked-out illustration.<br>
<br>It is not known how far Weddington was describing practices and procedures that he had encountered or had himself implemented in practice. However, his innovations in the literature, and indeed his book itself, had little influence on subsequent books on the double-entry system, though John Mellis did use some of Weddington's examples in his <span class="italic">A Briefe Instruction</span> of 1588. In 1564 Willem Silvius, an Antwerp printer, was granted a licence to publish a book, apparently in Dutch, on bookkeeping, by &#145;Jan Wadington ende Noel N&#146;. No book corresponding to this description has been recorded. Weddington was, however, certainly responsible for a short book on arithmetic for merchants. It was a translation into English by Weddington of a book by Fran&ccedil;ois Flory in French, first published in Antwerp in 1577. <span class="italic">The Practize of Cifering Made by Fraunces Flory of Lyle</span> was published in London in 1593. This work, like his book on bookkeeping, Weddington dedicated to the governor of the Merchant Adventurers of the English Nation. In the preface Weddington described himself as a poor member who was receiving support from the company. The publication of the book is the last known date in Weddington's life.<br>
