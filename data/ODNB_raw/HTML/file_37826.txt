<span class="headword">Ormiston,  Thomas</span>  (1826&#150;1882), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 28 July 1826, one of at least two sons of John Ormiston and his wife, Margaret Lindsay. The family subsequently moved to Glasgow, where Thomas received a rudimentary education before leaving school early to enter the business of his father and uncle, who were builders in Glasgow. With them he acquired a knowledge of carpentry, masonry, and surveying. In 1846 he entered the engineers' department of the River Clyde Improvement Trust; shortly afterwards he became chief assistant and from 1852 he was acting engineer to the trust for a short period on the death of David Bremner. Three years later James Walker, a past president of the Institution of Civil Engineers, appointed him principal assistant in his London office, where he remained until the beginning of 1862.<br>
<br>From early in his career Ormiston was interested in the practical side of engineering. While working for the Clyde trustees he designed works himself at Ormidale pier, Port Glasgow, and Ayr harbour, where he developed his own design for a dredger. Further south he worked on the design of docks and harbours in the Isle of Man, the River Mersey, and Cardiff. He also worked on many of the Trinity House lighthouses and in 1856&#150;7 was entrusted with the entire charge of the erection of the lighthouse on The Needles in the Isle of Wight. In addition he was involved in the preparation of designs for the Plymouth breakwater fort, and from 1862 he served as engineer in charge of the fort works. In 1857 Ormiston married Charlotte, daughter of William Lane of Freshwater, Isle of Wight; they had three sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>At the end of 1864 Ormiston went to Bombay to superintend a large land reclamation scheme adjacent to the harbour for the Elphinstone Land and Press Company of Bombay. This he did so successfully that in 1870 the government of India took the company over, retaining Ormiston's services. In 1873 this led to the establishment of the Bombay Port Trust with Ormiston as chief engineer. Ormiston foresaw the large expansion in Bombay's trade that took place in the 1870s and 1880s, to which the facilities of the Prince's Dock, constructed to his design from 1875 to 1880, made a great contribution. On the occasion of its opening in January 1880 he was appointed CIE. He had previously relinquished his post to his brother George E. Ormiston in 1874 and became consulting engineer to the Bombay Port Trust in London.<br>
<br>Ormiston was for many years a JP for Bombay, and he took a keen interest in municipal affairs. He gave much time and energy to advising the government on engineering projects throughout India, and in 1879 he visited Cyprus to report on the harbour at Famagusta. He was a fellow of the University of Bombay, and was elected dean of the faculty of engineering in 1879.<br>
<br>In 1880 Ormiston's health began to fail and early in 1882 he retired to the Isle of Wight, where he died at Neston Farm, Freshwater, on 9 July 1882. He was survived by his wife.<br>
