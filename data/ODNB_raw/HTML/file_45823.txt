<span class="headword">Sharp,  Jane</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1641&#150;1671), <span class="occ">midwife</span>, was the author of the best-known seventeenth-century textbook on midwifery in English written by a woman. Nothing is known about her life, except that she describes herself as a &#145;practitioner in the art of midwifery above thirty years&#146; in the preface to her book, <span class="italic">The midwives book, or, The whole art of midwifery discovered, directing childbearing women how to behave themselves in their conception, bearing and nursing of children</span> (1671). It has been widely assumed that Sharp was a London practitioner, but no record of either her life or her practice has been found in London, despite extensive searches. Her use of the west-country phrase &#145;by odds&#146; and the book's dedication to Lady Elleanour Talbutt, who, as an unmarried sister of the tenth earl of Shrewsbury, was probably living in Shropshire or Gloucestershire, suggest that Sharp may not have been from London at all. It has been speculated that she may have had a daughter, or more probably a daughter-in-law, to whom she passed on her skills, since a midwife named Sarah Sharpe is mentioned in the will of Anne Parrott, midwife in St Clement Danes, London. As other historical evidence is lacking, Sharp's existence has sometimes been denied. Late twentieth-century feminist scholars have sought to correct this view, drawing attention to the difficulties of establishing women's identity in the early modern period.<br>
<br>Published as a small octavo, <span class="italic">The Midwives Book</span> was a lengthy text of 95,000 words. It sold, bound, for 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>., and achieved four editions by 1725; the third and fourth editions, published by John Marshall in 1724 and 1725, appeared after Sharp's death with the title <span class="italic">The Compleat Midwife's Companion</span>.<br>
<br>In the introduction to <span class="italic">The Midwives Book</span> Sharp addressed herself to her &#145;sisters, the Midwives of England&#146; and gave her reasons for writing the book. She claimed that her distress at &#145;the many miseries women endure in the hands of unskilful midwives&#146; who practised only for &#145;lucre's sake&#146; had prompted her work  (Sharp, introduction). However, her educational purpose cannot be taken at face value. Printed textbooks were largely irrelevant to the education of seventeenth-century midwives, who were trained by apprenticeship, and the full title of the book suggests that Sharp had a wider audience in mind. It seems likely that the book, like other midwifery manuals, was intended for both lay and medical readers; indeed in her introduction Sharp anticipated that her readership would include young men and women anxious to learn about sexuality and reproduction.<br>
<br>Divided into six sections, <span class="italic">The Midwives Book</span> explored the full range of topics then thought to be relevant to human reproduction. It discussed conception and the promotion of fertility; the signs of pregnancy and the care of pregnant women; the management of both normal deliveries and malpresentations; the treatment of venereal disease; and the post-natal care of both mother and baby. The book also included information about the anatomy of the male and female sexual organs, and a short section on the diseases of children. Sharp has been criticized for her seeming unawareness of podalic version (turning the foetus so that the feet present), but this shortcoming was common to other contemporary medical writers.<br>
<br>Sharp claimed that the manual was the product of her own experience and the study of foreign authors, but she was very dependent on the work of Nicholas Culpeper, the seventeenth-century radical. Many of the stories, remedies, and descriptions that Sharp uses in books 1, 5, and 6 are based on Culpeper's translation of Daniel Sennert's <span class="italic">Practical Physick</span> (1664). Sharp also borrowed extensively from Culpeper's <span class="italic">Dictionary</span> and his <span class="italic">Bartholinus Anatomy</span>, translated from Bartholinus, and from Helkiah Crooke's <span class="italic">Microcosmographia</span>, a manual of anatomy first published in 1615. However, <span class="italic">The Midwives Book</span> was not merely a patchwork of earlier works. Sharp demonstrated her originality by reworking her sources, adding material of her own, and rewording anatomical definitions from a woman's point of view. On the whole <span class="italic">The Midwives Book</span> contained much good sense, though it was not in the same league as some contemporary works by continental midwives.<br>
<br>Sharp's work is important for its defence of the traditional role played by women as birth attendants. In the seventeenth century male practitioners were beginning to encroach upon the professional territory of the midwife, and Sharp felt the need to emphasize the value of the midwife's expertise. Man-midwifery, she argued, was a frivolous fashion, since country folk who could not afford the fees of a male practitioner fared as well in childbirth as the greatest ladies of the land. Sharp did recognize that unskilled midwifery could cause misery, but unlike male critics of midwifery practice she did not represent this as a result of the limited intellectual capacities of women. In her introduction Sharp explained:<blockquote>It is not hard words that perform the work, as if none understood the Art, that cannot understand Greek. Words are but the shell that we offtimes break our Teeth with them to come at the kernel, I mean our brains to know what is the meaning of them; but to have the same in our mother tongue would save us a great deal of labour. (Sharp, 3&#150;4)</blockquote>Although men alone could study anatomy at the universities, Sharp added, women could learn from each other and from &#145;long and diligent practice&#146;. Sharp may have been aware of the proposals for a college of midwives, controlled by medical practitioners, repeatedly put forward by the Chamberlen family in the first half of the seventeenth century. Within this context, her acceptance of Culpeper as an authority may be significant. An arch-critic of &#145;closed shops&#146; and professional monopolies, Culpeper was especially popular among mid-seventeenth-century London midwives, who faced the most serious challenge to their status and professional independence. His anti-establishment stance may have had some appeal for Sharp too, as she sought to defend the midwife's time-honoured claim to the practice of midwifery.<br>
