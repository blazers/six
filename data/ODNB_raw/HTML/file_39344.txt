<span class="headword">Orrock,  James</span>  (1829&#150;1913), <span class="occ">painter and art collector</span>, was born in Edinburgh, the elder son of the four children of James Orrock, a successful chemist and surgeon-dentist, and his first wife. His mother encouraged his lifelong passion for music and painting; as a boy he collected prints and drawings and his portfolio became his most cherished toy. At the age of eight he went as a boarder to the Revd George Corson's Irvine Academy in Ayrshire. There he received his first formal lessons in art from Mr White, an old-fashioned drawing-master who taught him to copy engravings by Landseer and Lawrence; so he developed the accurate if imitative skills which were to distinguish his future output as an artist. He went to Edinburgh to study medicine and decided on a course of surgeon-dentistry while taking tuition in oil painting from James Ferguson. In order to perfect the mechanical branch of dentistry Orrock moved to Leicester as a pupil assistant to Mr Williamson, dividing his time between private practice and the Leicester dispensary. In all available free time he travelled about the midlands filling sketchbooks, and he sent drawings to various exhibitions to supplement his income. During this time he became a pupil of John Burgess of Leamington, a respected watercolour painter (a member of of the Royal Watercolour Society) and art collector who did much to improve his watercolour technique and wider appreciation of art. After returning to Edinburgh to finish his medical studies he won the senior gold medal in anatomy. He also resumed lessons with Ferguson and produced his first pictures for exhibition at the Royal Scottish Academy. In 1853 he married Susan (<i>d</i>. 1911), the daughter of Charles Gould of Leicester, and established himself in dental practice in Nottingham, where he entered the school of design run by the Fussell brothers and took instruction from Stewart Smith. This period in Nottingham gave him enough time to exploit a sound but unspectacular talent for painting and sufficient increase in wealth to build a significant collection of English pictures, blue and white porcelain, and fine Chippendale and Adam furniture. <br>
<br>In 1866 Orrock gave up dentistry to become a professional painter and moved to London to Bedford Square, where he shared studio space, and then to 43 Bloomsbury Square. In 1870 he took lessons from William Leighton Leitch, and in the following year he was elected to the New Watercolour Society (later the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours), proposed by Leitch and supported by the president, Louis Haag. Thereafter he was influential and active in affairs of the society, and he was mainly responsible for building their fine new gallery in Piccadilly, reconstituting the institute, and gaining the royal charter. He was both skilled and prolific in producing mainly watercolours in an early nineteenth-century style and possessed a confident gift for self-promotion. With his powerful proselytizing personality he took up a public stance for the English watercolour tradition exemplified by J. M. W. Turner, David Cox, Peter DeWint, and William Henry Hunt. The essential collector's instinct enabled him to fill his beautiful Adam house at 48 Bedford Square with the best of these and other great artists from which his own <i>&#339;uvre</i> derived. Their merits and, as Orrock perceived it, their lack of recognition by the museum world were argued in an outpouring of pamphlets and impassioned articles in the fashionable and influential magazines of the day; most famous was a lecture to the Society of Arts on 11 March 1890, &#145;On the claims of the British school of painting to a thorough representation in the National Gallery&#146;. <br>
<br>Orrock's persuasive zeal in turn brought him recognition of his own work and acquisitions, and in his fine domestic setting evolved his lucrative secondary career as an art dealer. This high-profile connoisseurship inevitably gave him acceptance within a wealthy Victorian society and access to rich friends and clients. Lord Leverhulme, the industrial soap tycoon and serial collector, was one notable disciple in taste, and between 1904 and 1912 he bought almost all of Orrock's art collection, as well as sixty oils and more than 1000 watercolours by the artist himself. Most of the last decade of Orrock's life was spent as an invalid at Shepperton-on-Thames, Middlesex, where he died at The Chestnuts on 10 May 1913. He was buried at Watford cemetery.<br>
