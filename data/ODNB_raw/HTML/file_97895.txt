<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Twyford,  Thomas William</span>  (1849&#150;1921), <span class="occ">sanitary ware manufacturer</span>, was born at Hanover Street, Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, on 23 September 1849, the eldest son in the family of four sons and one daughter of Thomas Twyford (1827&#150;1872), earthenware manufacturer, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jones (<i>d</i>. 1874). He came from a long line of north Staffordshire potters and was a descendant of Joshua Twyford (<i>bap</i>. 1640, <i>d</i>. 1729), a potter in Hanley. His father established two earthenware factories, the Bath Street works in Hanley and the Abbey works in Bucknall, and in 1849 began the manufacture of sanitary goods at the Bath Street works, building up a substantial trade and exporting to markets across Europe and to the United States.<br>
<br>Twyford's father died at Shelton in September 1872 and, after a period when the sanitary ware business was run by trustees, he assumed control. He had married, on 20 June 1872, Susannah, daughter of Edward Whittingham, farmer; they had a son and a daughter. He released his first sanitary ware catalogue in March 1879. The 1870s marked a critical period in the development of the water closet when expert opinion from several leading sanitary reformers advocated the use of simple basin and trap closets made entirely of earthenware in place of the complicated and expensive mechanical water closets generally preferred at the time by the well-to-do. Basin and trap closets were either made in two parts with an upper basin attached to a water-sealed trap or were made in one piece. From about 1875 the &#145;wash-out&#146; closet emerged as the preferred type of basin trap closet, and Twyford's new range of 1879 included his own version, the National. Like all wash-out closets the basin of the National held a shallow reserve of water which was forced through the water-sealed trap when the device was flushed. The National was awarded honours at sanitary exhibitions in 1881 at South Kensington and Brighton and in 1882 Twyford added a second wash-out closet, the Crown, to his range followed by a third, the Alliance in 1883.<br>
<br>These three models were not freestanding and required the support of a wooden enclosure surmounted by a fixed wooden seat. During the early 1880s freestanding closets, which were easier to clean and, therefore, more hygienic, developed and Twyford was again quick to adopt the latest thinking. About 1884 he introduced his first freestanding closet, the Unitas. The earliest model retained an exposed trap but he persuaded his best potters to undertake the complicated manufacture of a pedestal version that enclosed the basin and trap within an exterior casing all in one piece of earthenware. Twyford cannot be given the credit for introducing the first commercially successful one-piece pedestal water closet&#151;that innovation is probably attributable to the London firm of George Jennings&#151;but in the Unitas Twyford produced one of the most celebrated wash-out closets of the 1880s. The exterior of the more expensive versions was finished with an elaborate oak leaf and acorn design in relief, while the interior of the basin was decorated with an underglaze printed floral design in blue. A second exterior styling called Florentine made its d&eacute;but in the 1886 catalogue.<br>
<br>In 1884 Twyford took out his first patent for a ceramic baffle or &#145;fan&#146; placed near the flush inlet to assist in the distribution of water around the basin. Further patents followed in 1886 and 1887 for improvements to the flushing rim and the outlet and then, in 1888, he took out patent protection for an &#145;after flush&#146; chamber that allowed for a quantity of clean water to refill the shallow basin once the closet was flushed. Twyford's &#145;architect's catalogue&#146; of 1887, however, shows that Twyford had first added the &#145;after flush&#146; chamber to his four wash-out closets the previous year.<br>
<br>From about 1878 support slowly grew for another type of basin and trap closet&#151;simpler than the wash-out&#151;with just one reserve of water in the basin and trap. Twyford had included one in his 1879 catalogue calling it the Lillyman: it was not granted the same prominence as its more illustrious wash-out counterpart the National, sharing a page towards the end of the catalogue with some of the cheapest (and worst) basin and trap closets intended for use by servants and the poor generally. Indeed this type of closet was but an improved type of the widely condemned short-hopper or cottage basin and trap. However, by the mid-1880s the simplicity and effectiveness of this type of closet&#151;by now generally known as the wash-down closet&#151;was widely acknowledged. The first pedestal version (devised by Frederick Humpherson of Chelsea) made its d&eacute;but in 1885 and in 1889 Twyford followed with his own pedestal version, the Deluge. Like the Unitas, the best models were given a superb finish with a liberal use of both relief and transfer printed decoration.<br>
<br>In the late 1880s Twyford made improvements to other items of ceramic sanitary ware. About 1887 he introduced earthenware handbasins made with improved holes for the taps, integrated overflow chambers, and facias designed to hide the iron brackets supporting the basin. He also introduced a pedestal bidet with hot and cold taps, standing waste, overflow, and flushing rim. In 1890 and 1891 he took out patents for improvements to the draining and trapping of sinks and also in 1891 patented an improved siphon operated &#145;water waste preventer&#146;, the Victorian term for a toilet cistern.<br>
<br>In 1887 Twyford consolidated his manufacturing operations on a new 9 acre site at Cliffe Vale, Stoke-on-Trent, alongside the Trent and Mersey Canal and the North Staffordshire Railway. Determined to reduce the incidence of industrial disease caused by inhaling sharp, fine particles of silica dust, he ensured that the new factory was spacious and well ventilated and kept scrupulously clean. In late 1890 he began the manufacture of fireclay sanitary ware. Fireclay was coarser than earthenware but stronger and tougher, and therefore ideal for the robust sanitary ware required in such public facilities and institutions as schools and workhouses. As fireclay potting was little known in Staffordshire, he recruited a team of experienced fireclay potters from Scotland and brought them to Hanley where, using local fireclays, he got them to experiment with the making of large pieces. By 1894 the firm was producing a wide range of porcelain enamelled fireclay sanitary ware of enormous size and strength including baths, large sinks, trough closets for use in institutions and urinals including a splendid arrangement of six stalls arranged in a full circle. Initially sold as &#145;Cliffe Vale porcelain enamelled fireclay&#146;, in 1899 the trade name was changed to Adamant.<br>
<br>Twyford added to his range of water closets in 1894 when he introduced the Twycliffe, the first really effective single-trap syphonic closet. The same year he introduced his first low level cistern; a close coupled closet and cistern followed in 1899. The firm's range of water closets, ceramic cistern casings, and wash basins reached its apogee in the profusely illustrated &#145;twentieth century catalogue&#146;, released in 1900, which offered an impressive range of superb decorative finishes including the use of relief ornament, coloured slips, and gold leaf as well as transfer printed and hand painted designs. In 1899 a new material, Vitrina ware, a hard impermeable material that did not require a glaze, was introduced.<br>
<br>Between the mid-1870s and 1900 sales increased more than fivefold and Twyford established showrooms in Berlin, Cape Town, and Sydney. Twyford also traded in other parts of Europe, Russia, and South America. In order to combat high German import duties he established a new fireclay works in Germany at Ratingen, near D&uuml;sseldorf, which opened in 1903. Further expansion occurred locally in 1911 when a new fireclay works was built opposite the Cliffe Vale works and about 1912 a new works was established in Garner Street, Etruria.<br>
<br>In 1896 the firm became a private limited company, Twyford serving as chairman. From 1898 he lived at Whitmore Hall in Newcastle under Lyme, and was increasingly prominent in public life, becoming high sheriff of Staffordshire in 1906. Active in local politics, he supported the Liberal Unionists, founding the Unionist newspaper the <span class="italic">Staffordshire Post</span>, which later amalgamated with the <span class="italic">Staffordshire Sentinel</span>, of which he became chairman. He stood unsuccessfully as the Conservative Party's candidate for North-Western Staffordshire at a by-election in July 1907. In the years before and during the First World War he was active in promoting recruitment to the Territorial Army and new armies. A tall man with a military bearing and an abrupt, even peremptory manner, he was also capable of showing great humour and kindness. He had musical interests, and was also a breeder of Labrador retrievers. He died on 21 March 1921 at the Chine Hotel, Boscombe, near Bournemouth, where he was staying after a period of illness, and was buried in Whitmore churchyard.<br>
