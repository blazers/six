<span class="headword">Campbell, Lady  Agnes</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1590), <span class="occ">noblewoman</span>, was the second daughter and fifth child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4482/', "Colin Campbell, third earl of Argyll (d. 1529)")</script>, landowner and administrator, and his wife, Janet Gordon. She was educated at the Scottish court, learning English and French. In 1545 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69919/', "James MacDonald of Dunyvaig and the Glens (d. 1565)")</script>, chieftain, head of MacDonald south, and had sons Archibald, Angus, and Donnell Gorm, and daughters Katherine and <a href="#cosubject_69173">Finola [<i>see below</i>]</a>. On 2 May 1565 Agnes's husband and his brother Sorley Boy were defeated by Shane O'Neill at Glenshesk and James died as a prisoner of Shane in August of that year. The position of Lady Agnes is well described by the historian J. M. Hill:<blockquote>Whether she possessed surpassing personal charm we know not but she could command the services of multitudinous redshanks &hellip; never was widow, therefore, more interesting in the eyes of Ulster lords than Lady Cantyre [Kintyre] and more than one Ulsterman sought her hand. (Hill, <span class="italic">Fire and Sword</span>, 148&#150;9)</blockquote>The killing of Shane O'Neill by the MacDonalds in June 1567 was followed by an apparent rapprochement between Sorley Boy and Shane's successor, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20786/', "Turlough Luineach O'Neill (c.1530&#150;1595)")</script>. Turlough Luineach looked to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4470/', "Archibald Campbell, fifth earl of Argyll")</script>, for aid and it came in February 1568 in the form of an offer of marriage with his aunt, Lady Agnes.<br>
<br>Government military activity in Ulster and the dilatoriness of Argyll in supplying redshanks (highland Scottish mercenary infantry serving the Irish chieftains) for an Ulster incursion combined to delay the marriage until 1569. Before that, however, Argyll had come up with a new approach to his aunt's nuptials, suggesting to Sir Henry Sidney, lord deputy of Ireland, that Agnes would marry an Irish chief chosen by Elizabeth I if the queen would make a grant to her and her sons of the territory of the Glens of Antrim. This was unlikely to find favour with Sorley Boy who had sought a grant of the area for himself. In any event, before either Argyll or Sidney could further elaborate upon the scheme, Turlough Luineach and Lady Agnes married, with Captain William Piers reporting from Carrickfergus, co. Antrim, on 5 August that the lady had brought over 1000 redshanks with her into Ulster, while Sir William Fitzwilliam, vice-treasurer and lord justice, noted that they had spent fourteen days in celebration on Rathlin Island in Antrim. From this marriage Lady Agnes had one son, Art.<br>
<br>Lady Agnes's actions suggest that she felt her interests and those of her sons were best advanced by Turlough Luineach's success. Although Sorley Boy encouraged him to invade the English pale in 1569, Turlough Luineach did little more than keep the English busy while forcing agreements upon several Ulster chiefs and accruing considerable plunder to himself. In December 1569 Sidney wrote that Turlough Luineach was about to &#145;sunder&#146; from his wife. This may have been wishful thinking for although by April 1570 Agnes was in Scotland, it was to procure redshanks on Turlough Luineach's behalf. The following year she was in Scotland again, intent on the same task but this time followed by Sorley Boy, apparently to prevent her augmenting her husband's forces. On 20 January 1571 Turlough Luineach came to an agreement with the government which, if it conferred no special advantage upon himself, at least left Sorley Boy no better off.<br>
<br>In December 1572, as an English colonization project threatened Ulster, Lady Agnes departed to Scotland with a large number of redshanks in her train. Again, the government placed its trust in &#145;discord&#146; between husband and wife, but Lady Agnes seems simply to have exchanged some of her husband's forces for fresh men. Certainly, Turlough Luineach substantially increased his Scottish forces from early 1573, continuing to hold these at full strength as Walter Devereux, first earl of Essex, attempted to support the colonists. In May 1574 Sir Brian mac Phelim O'Neill, chief of the rival O'Neills of Clandeboye, surrendered Clandeboye to the queen's forces but Essex admitted in October that Turlough Luineach's strength remained intact. Following the attack on Rathlin in July 1575 and Essex's withdrawal from Ulster, Sorley Boy and Lord Deputy Sidney reached an agreement in October 1575 which included the revocation of a number of colonist grants and recognized Sorley's claim to the Glens. It remained to be seen to what degree Sorley Boy could enforce this provision against the counter-claims of Lady Agnes and her sons. Turlough Luineach had meanwhile succeeded in enhancing his position by skilfully measured shows of strength which ultimately cost him little and in this process the efforts of Lady Agnes in Argyll had been invaluable.<br>
<br>Turlough Luineach regularly employed Lady Agnes as his delegate in meetings with government officials; from 1575 this was even more frequent. This ploy enabled him to distance himself from negotiations, rendering escape from agreements all the more easy should he deem it necessary. In June 1575 he sent his wife to treat with Essex, extracting considerable land grants and permission to refuse to meet any governor against his will. In November Turlough Luineach and Lady Agnes both met Sidney. He offered to submit to Sidney in return for an earldom and lands promised by Essex, while Lady Agnes requested recognition of the claims of her sons to the Glens. Her demeanour was noted by one of the officials: &#145;She is a very nobell wysse woman and as dutifully uses herself to further the Queenes service as if she weare a naturall borne subiecte&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/53/69). Despite Sidney's demands, Lady Agnes continued to organize the dispatch of Scottish mercenaries to Turlough Luineach and it is clear that the lord deputy considered her an important political figure in her own right, and no mere cipher of her husband. This view was shared in 1579 by his colleagues, Sir William Drury, lord justice, and Sir William Gerard, lord chancellor. In September 1579 Turlough Luineach refused to deal with the queen's representatives save in the presence of his wife.<br>
<br>Lady Agnes's diplomatic skills and military connections continued to be indispensable to Turlough Luineach throughout the 1580s. Though no longer young, she still travelled regularly to Scotland to ensure that support there was continuously maintained. A letter by Arthur, fourteenth Baron Grey of Wilton, lord deputy, during his encampment at the River Blackwater in August 1580 described vividly the skill of husband and wife as joint negotiators. He got an agreement but could neither commend the &#145;surety of it nor honer&#146;, nor had he secured the rebel William Nugent who had fled to Turlough Luineach for protection  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/85.5). As she pressed her husband's interests, Lady Agnes continued to support those of her sons. By 1575, she believed Sorley Boy to be a serious threat to them and in January 1577 induced Turlough Luineach to decline negotiation with Sidney until he should agree to &#145;repel the Scots&#146; and assist her sons in their ambitions to become chiefs in Antrim. Articles were signed in the autumn of 1584 between Sir John Perrot, lord deputy, and the Irish privy council, and Lady Agnes's younger son Donell Gorm for a grant of the former Bisset lands in the Glens, followed by a similar agreement with her son Angus in August 1585. In 1586 Turlough Luineach employed Lady Agnes to represent him in talks with Perrot. In 1587 she travelled to Scotland to calm an outbreak of hostilities between her son Angus and MacLean of Duart. In March 1588 she went to Edinburgh to plead for Angus before James VI and at the end of that year was again to be found negotiating on behalf of Turlough Luineach. In Scotland once more in April 1590, she subsequently disappears from state records and died soon after.<br>

<a name="cosubject_69173"></a><span class="headword">Finola MacDonald</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1610), <span class="occ">noblewoman</span>, was the second daughter of James MacDonald and Agnes Campbell. In 1569 she married Hugh Manus O'Donnell of Tyrconnell (<i>d</i>. 1593), chieftain, sometimes known as the elder, son of Hugh O'Donnell. With him she had a son, Hugh, and a daughter, Nuala. As sister of MacDonald of Dunyvaig, she could bring Scottish mercenaries to the service of her husband and, like her mother, frequently negotiated on her husband's behalf. Michael O'Cleary, in his <span class="italic">Life of Red Hugh</span>, described Finola as &#145;much praised for her womanly qualities, with the heart of a hero and soul of a soldier&#146;  (p. 39). The historian C. Falls, however, observed that &#145;she exhibited a savagery of which no trace can be found in the record of her mother&#146;  (Falls, 82). She was credited with arranging the murder in 1588 of Hugh O'Gallagher, who had been implicated in the killing of her cousin, Alexander MacSorley. Later, considering that the O'Donnell castle at Donegal could act as a bridgehead for entry by English forces into O'Donnell country, Finola ordered the structure to be burnt. She showed a singular ruthlessness in advancing the causes of her son, Red Hugh O'Donnell, apparently ordering the death of Hugh, son of former chief Calvagh, to clear the way for her son to succeed to the chieftainship. In September 1590, while Red Hugh was a prisoner at Dublin Castle, Donnell, a son of Finola's husband by an earlier liaison, was killed at Derrylahan by Finola's forces. After Red Hugh's succession, as he was engaged in the Nine Years' War (1594&#150;1603), he used his mother to speak for him in Scotland. During the war, Red Hugh's kinsman, Niall Garbh O'Donnell, deserted to the English side. After the flight of the earls of Tyrone and Tyrconnell from Ireland in September 1607, Finola contrived Niall Garbh's arrest for rebellion in 1609; he was incarcerated in the Tower of London where he died in 1626. Finola died some time after 1610.<br>
