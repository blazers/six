<span class="headword">Ealhswith</span>  (<em>d.</em> 902), <span class="occ">consort of Alfred, king of the West Saxons from 871 and of the Anglo-Saxons from 886</span>, was the daughter of &AElig;thelred Mucel, ealdorman of the &#145;Gaini&#146; (presumably an old tribal group of the Mercians), and his wife, Eadburh, who, according to Alfred's biographer Asser, was a member of the Mercian royal family. She had a brother, an ealdorman named &AElig;thelwulf, whose appearance in a charter of 897 confirms the siblings' Mercian royal pedigree  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 1442). In 868 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/183/', "Alfred (848/9&#150;899)")</script>, at that time apparently regarded as &#145;heir-apparent&#146; to his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8913/', "&#198;thelred, king of the West Saxons")</script> (<i>r</i>. 865&#150;71). The Mucel who appears in two charters of that year in company with West Saxon dignitaries was probably her father  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 340 and 1201).<br>
<br>In marked and curious contrast to her husband, the best-attested of all the Anglo-Saxon kings, Ealhswith is very obscure in the sources. Asser never names her explicitly, and, in accordance with what he says was the West Saxon custom of the time, she was apparently never called &#145;queen&#146;; nor does she appear as a witness to any of Alfred's extant charters. The couple had three daughters and two sons who survived into adulthood. Their first-born child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8907/', "&#198;thelfl&#230;d (d. 918)")</script>, married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52311/', "&#198;thelred (d. 911)")</script>, ealdorman and ruler of the Mercians from at least 883. Another daughter, &AElig;thelgifu, was made abbess of his own foundation of Shaftesbury by her father. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/193/', "&#198;lfthryth")</script> married Baudouin (II), count of Flanders, at some time after 893. Of the two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8514/', "Edward (the Elder) (d. 924)")</script> succeeded his father as king of the Anglo-Saxons. The youngest child, &AElig;thelweard, was well educated at the royal court, received generous provision in his father's will, attested several of his brother's charters, and died on 16 October, probably in 920.<br>
<br>It was probably on her own initiative, and perhaps after Alfred's death in 899, that Ealhswith founded the convent of St Mary at Winchester, usually called Nunnaminster. The bounds of her land in Winchester, which survive in a tenth-century addition to an earlier prayer book which came into Nunnaminster's possession, probably describe the site of the foundation, to the east of Edward's New Minster, founded in 901. The New Minster's <span class="italic">Liber vitae</span>, compiled <i>c</i>.1030, describes her as Nunnaminster's builder. Construction was probably not completed until <i>c</i>.908, if the tower which (according to the chronicler &AElig;thelweard) Archbishop Plegmund then dedicated belonged to Nunnaminster.<br>
<br>In his will  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 1507), Alfred left to his wife the highly symbolic bequest of three key estates: Edington (Wiltshire), the site of one great victory over the vikings; Lambourn (Berkshire), at or near the site of another&#151;Ashdown; and Wantage (Berkshire), his birthplace. These were all part of Alfred's &#145;bookland&#146;, which, in order to ensure that they remained in the king's family, could be purchased by any of his male kin during Ealhswith's lifetime, and would pass to his direct male descendants on her death: all three were still royal estates in the tenth century. Ealhswith died on 5 December 902, and was buried, with Alfred, by their son Edward, in the newly consecrated New Minster, Winchester. She is commemorated in two manuscripts of an early tenth-century metrical calendar as &#145;the true and dear lady of the English&#146;  (McGurk, 110), finally but posthumously sharing the honour so recently won by her husband.<br>
