<span class="headword">Rigby,  Christopher Palmer</span>  (1820&#150;1885), <span class="occ">diplomatist and army officer</span>, was born on 18 January 1820 at Yately Lodge, Yately, Hampshire, the youngest son and sixth of the eight children of Tipping Thomas Rigby (1774&#150;1862), barrister and recorder of Wallingford, and his wife, Ann Eliza, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cousins. Educated at Abingdon grammar school (1831&#150;3) and at Addiscombe College (1834&#150;5), Rigby began his military career in 1836, as an ensign in the 5th regiment of native infantry stationed in Poona. He remained in India, except for a posting in Aden from 1840 to 1843, until 1850&#151;with one leave in England. During these years of service overseas he acquired fluency in eight oriental and African languages, and wrote a number of erudite articles which appeared in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Bombay Geographical Society</span>.<br>
<br>Rigby returned to India in April 1854&#151;to Bombay&#151;and soon afterwards was appointed president of the examination committee for native languages&#151;his latest recreation being the study of Turkish. At this period relations between Persia and Britain were worsening on account of Afghanistan. Accordingly, in September 1854 Britain dispatched an expeditionary field force to the Persian port of Bushehr, with Rigby as interpreter and, later, superintendent of police&#151;with himself the only policeman in the town.<br>
<br>After returning to Bombay early in 1858 Rigby was appointed the East India Company's agent in Zanzibar and British consul, the previous consul having died at his post thirteen months previously. On 27 July 1858, the day of his arrival in Zanzibar, Rigby called on the sultan, Majid bin Sa&#145;id al-Busa&#145;idi, aboard his flagship and was given a royal salute. The sultanates of Muscat and Zanzibar had recently been separated by the terms of the Canning award, but Majid's position remained insecure; in 1859 his half-brothers Thwain of Muscat and Barghash, who was to succeed Majid as sultan, attempted to capture Zanzibar. However, at Rigby's instance, the Royal Navy gave Majid the necessary support and the insurrection failed, Barghash being sent to Bombay where he was compelled to remain for eighteen months.<br>
<br>While serving in Zanzibar, Rigby met and assisted several celebrated explorers: Sir Richard Burton (who was to be accused by Rigby of withholding payment from porters and other members of the expedition to Lake Tanganyika&#151;an accusation which was denied by Burton), J. H. Speke, and David Livingstone. In particular, he befriended <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11266/', "James A. Grant")</script>.<br>
<br>Atkins Hamerton, Rigby's predecessor in Zanzibar, had signed a treaty with Majid's father in 1845; this restricted, but did not abolish, the east African slave trade. Rigby worked with ardour to suppress the traffic in slaves and his efforts to enforce the 1845 treaty were unremitting. Furthermore, he ordered the emancipation of all slaves owned by British subjects residing in Zanzibar; it is estimated that he set free 8000 slaves up to the time of his leaving Zanzibar.<br>
<br>In 1861 the Bombay government published Rigby's <span class="italic">Report on the Zanzibar Dominions</span>, a comprehensive and informative survey of the sultanate. On 5 September 1861 Rigby left Zanzibar because of ill health and returned to England. In January 1864 he was appointed commissioner for the settlement of boundary disputes between the states of Baroda and Jamnagar. On 27 June 1867, in London, he married Matilda, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Prater. They had two sons (one of whom was killed in action in the First World War) and two daughters (one of whom died in infancy).<br>
<br>Rigby resigned from the army in August 1867 with the rank of major-general. Shortly before his death he lost all his savings in the collapse of the Oriental Bank. He died at his home, 14 Portland Place, London, on 14 April 1885; he was survived by his wife. His daughter Lillian (1875&#150;1949) edited, as C. E. B. Russell, <span class="italic">General Rigby, Zanzibar and the Slave Trade</span> (1935). She became a follower of Albert Schweitzer, was his first British assistant at Lambaren&eacute;, and was the English translator of Schweitzer's philosophical lectures.<br>
