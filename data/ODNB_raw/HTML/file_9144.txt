<span class="headword">Fanelli,  Francesco</span>  (<em>b. </em>1577), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born on 17 December 1577 in Florence, the son of Virgilio Fanelli and his wife, Alessandra. His father was a sculptor and native of Florence but no evidence survives concerning his activities. Fanelli was apprenticed to the Tuscan sculptor Giovanni Bandini. He may have assisted his master in the large Medici commission for the statue of Grand Duke Ferdinando I that Bandini had undertaken a few years before his death (piazza Micheli, Leghorn) and have contributed to the marble group of <span class="italic">Adonis and his Hound</span> (1598; ex Sothebys, New York, 25 January 2001). Bandini's will, which referred to his pupil as a close friend, granted Fanelli freedom to use his models.<br>
<br>Some time before 1604 Fanelli married Lucrezia (<i>d</i>. 1623?), with whom he had eight children, including Virgilio (<i>b</i>. before 1604, <i>d</i>. 1678) and Giovanni Battista (1605&#150;1672). Virgilio enjoyed a prominent career in Genoa, Bologna, Toledo, and Madrid, where he executed the chandelier for the Pantheon in the Escorial, and Giovanni Battista entered his father's workshop. The name of Fanelli's second wife is not known. By 5 August 1605, the date of Giovanni Battista's baptism, it is evident that Fanelli and his family were living in Genoa. During his twenty-five-year residence in Genoa, Fanelli collaborated with many of the city's indigenous and foreign sculptors, painters, and silversmiths. Fanelli's first recorded works date to 1609 and 1610 when the Spanish-appointed governor, Marchese Giovanni Domenico Spinola, commissioned from him two bronze crucifixes. The larger of the two, nearly 2 m high, was executed after a design by the painter Giovanni Battista Paggi, through whom Fanelli may have received a further commission from Franco Barsotto in 1615. This called for six marble angels in relief to decorate the lateral doors of the sanctuary in the church of Santa Maria della Misericordia, Savona. Paggi, along with Battista Orsolino, later acted as Fanelli's supervisor on the prestigious commission for the decoration of the chapel of the Madonna in the church of Santa Maria della Vigne. Fanelli worked intermittently on this project between 1620 and 1629 and was responsible for all the work in bronze. For the newly completed church of the Ges&ugrave;, Fanelli was commissioned to execute three free-standing marble figures (<span class="italic">St John the Evangelist</span>, signed and dated 1619, and <span class="italic">Ecce homo</span> and <span class="italic">The Redeemer</span>, 1625&#150;6). In 1619 Fanelli collaborated with the silversmith Francesco Carrega who cast in silver his models of figurines to decorate a chest for Giacomo Filippo Durazzo. Similarly, a silver basin with scenes from the life of Cleopatra (J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles) may have been modelled by Fanelli after a design by the Genoese painter Bernardo Strozzi (AM Oxf.) before being passed to a Dutch or Flemish silversmith.<br>
<br>The last record of Fanelli in Genoa pertains to a poll tax levied on his workshop for the construction of a new city wall in 1630. He is next recorded in London at the court of Charles I in March 1632, when he drew a pension of &pound;60  (TNA: PRO, SO, 3/10, fol. 230<i>r</i>, unnumbered). <i>En route</i>, Fanelli appears to have stayed in Flanders, where he executed a pair of equestrian statuettes of the governor, Francisco de Moncada, marqu&eacute;s de Aytona (<i>d</i>. 1635), and Philip IV's prime minister, the count-duke of Olivares (ex Sothebys, New York, 10 January 1995).<br>
<br>Fanelli may have been summoned to England by the lord treasurer, Richard Weston, first earl of Portland, whose bronze tomb effigy has been attributed to Fanelli (<i>c</i>.1633&#150;5; Winchester Cathedral). In this, and in the memorial bust of the poet Sir Robert Ayton (<i>c</i>.1638; Westminster Abbey), Fanelli is credited with executing all the work in bronze. In the former he contributed to a design by Isaac Besnier, although he was evidently capable of designing his own monuments: Thomas Howard, twenty-first or fourteenth earl of Arundel, commanded in his will of 3 September 1641, &#145;That my Tombe bee my owne Figure (of white marble or brasse designed by Sign.<sup>r</sup> Francesco Fanelli) sitting and looking upwards&#146;  (Hervey, 460).<br>
<br>In England, Fanelli is principally remembered for small table bronzes and reliefs of animalier, mythological, and biblical subjects. George Vertue wrote that Fanelli &#145;had a particular genius for these works&#146; and sold them &#145;to persons that were Curious to sett on Tables cupboards shelves by way of Ornament&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 4.110). They were instrumental in establishing the vogue for baroque sculpture in Caroline England. His technique was to achieve a high degree of finish in the wax master-model to limit the amount of filing in the metal. By making alterations or additions to a cast wax replica of the master-model, Fanelli then effected numerous variations of his models, for example, many of his equestrian groups derive from two generic types of horses: the <span class="italic">Leaping Horse</span> (example in the Herzog Anton Ulrich Museum, Brunswick) and the <span class="italic">Rearing Horse</span> (example at David Peel Ltd, 1971). Fanelli's non-equine bronze groups include an <span class="italic">Adonis, Venus and Cupid</span> (V&amp;A); <span class="italic">David and Goliath</span> (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York); and <span class="italic">Cupid on a Dolphin</span> (NG Scot.), while works in relief include <span class="italic">Orpheus Singing to the Beasts</span> (with sets of miniature animal plaques; V&amp;A); <span class="italic">Adam and Eve</span>; and <span class="italic">Christ Carrying the Cross</span> (Minneapolis Institute of Art).<br>
<br>From Abraham van der Doort's 1639 inventory of the Royal Collection, it is evident that Charles I purchased at least five of Fanelli's statuettes. A <span class="italic">St. George Slaying the Dragon</span> was listed in the cabinet room at Whitehall, where Raphael's painting of the same subject was displayed. The statuettes were dispersed in the Commonwealth sale. In addition to his work as a sculptor, it is possible that Fanelli was involved, from 1639, in the ambitious Italianate garden complex planned for Queen Henrietta Maria's new palace at Wimbledon. This may account for Fanelli's book of engravings, the <span class="italic">Varie architetture</span>, an example of which was reprinted by Van Merle in Paris in 1661. The plates of elaborate sculptural grottoes and fountains perfectly complement the projected layout of the gardens envisaged by Andr&eacute; Mollet.<br>
<br>An entry in the diary of George Weckherlin, the king's secretary, dated 19 February 1639, suggests that Fanelli may have returned home or revisited his contacts in Flanders: &#145;Made a Safeconduct for an Italian (his Ma.<sup>ts</sup> Sculptor) by the L. Marquis order&#146;  (Trumbull papers, BL, vol. 192, Add. 72433, 62ff.). However, the following year he returned to England and completed a life-size bust of Charles, prince of Wales, which he signed &#145;Sculptor to the King of Great Britain&#146; (1640; priv. coll.). It was commissioned by the prince's governor, William Cavendish, second earl of Newcastle, who was a consistent patron of Fanelli and owned a complete set of his equestrian statuettes. A second small bust of Prince Charles, cast in silver and bronze and dating to <i>c</i>.1643, may suggest that Fanelli accompanied the court to Oxford and collaborated with a silversmith there (ex Sothebys, New York, 10 January 1995). It is from these busts, and an exquisite miniature one of Charles I (<i>c</i>.1635&#150;8; V&amp;A), that we can best judge Fanelli's ability at portraiture. The bust of Charles I, with its distinctive nautical motifs, may represent Charles as lord high admiral, a post he had personally assumed on the death of George Villiers, first duke of Buckingham, in 1628.<br>
<br>The date and place of Fanelli's death are not known. It is thought he left for Paris, but as no evidence survives to support this, Vertue's statement that he &#145;livd and dyd in England&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 4.110) cannot be discounted. His workshop was re-established in London in 1663 when his son, Giovanni Battista, found employment with Charles II, hence the use of Fanelli's models well into the eighteenth century.<br>
