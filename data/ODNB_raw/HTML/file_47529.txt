<span class="headword">Gray, Sir  William</span>  (1823&#150;1898), <span class="occ">shipbuilder and shipowner</span>, was born on 18 January 1823 in Blyth, Northumberland, one of five children of Matthew Gray and his wife, Ann Jane Bryham. His father was a draper and shipowner. He received his schooling at Bruce's academy, Newcastle upon Tyne, before he learned the drapery business under his father. He also spent several years in London before, in 1844, he set up on his own account in Hartlepool. On 15 May 1849 he married Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1906), daughter of Captain John Hall RN. Although at that time they were living at Lewisham, Kent, the Hall family had strong connections with north-east England. The couple had five daughters, including the politician and philanthropist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58629/', "Julia McMordie")</script>, and two sons.<br>
<br>Gray invested his spare capital in ships, building his fortune &#145;in shop and by ship&#146; as his father had done. In 1863, having withdrawn from the drapery business, he formed a partnership with John Punshon Denton, an established builder of wooden ships, in Hartlepool, to build iron vessels at Denton's Middleton yard. Gray was initially the junior partner in the firm of Denton, Gray &amp; Co., but in practice there was equality between the two men. With the demise of Pile, Spence &amp; Co., a larger yard in West Hartlepool became available and the business was transferred there in 1869. Denton died at the end of 1871 and a disagreement between Gray and Denton's sons over the terms of the partnership went to litigation. The dispute was finally resolved in 1874 and the business that emerged was William Gray &amp; Co. Gray took his son Matthew into partnership in 1877.<br>
<br>The yard prospered and in 1878 it achieved the distinction of launching the largest tonnage of any shipyard in the world, a feat to be repeated on a number of occasions. The ships were largely medium-size cargo steamers of the well-decked type built in the Hartlepools. These ships were viewed with suspicion by the Board of Trade and Gray initiated an insurance club with the specific goal of fostering public confidence in them. He had already set up, with George Pyman, the East Coast Iron Steamship Association in 1868. Specialization in cargo steamers was part of the reason for the company's success. However, as demand for oil tankers developed the firm secured a share of that market, building the <i>Bakuin</i> (1886), the first tanker for a British owner, and the <i>Murex</i> (1892), the first tanker to navigate the Suez Canal. The latter vessel was the first of a number built for Marcus Samuel, founder of Shell Transport and Trading. Another factor in the yard's success was Gray's willingness to offer extended credit to shipowners, or to take an interest in vessels himself.<br>
<br>In 1884 Gray moved away from dependence on other builders of marine engines, with the opening of the Central Marine Engineering Works. Three years later the demand for larger ships led to the opening of the Central shipyard, with three berths capable of allowing ships up to 450 ft to be built. Repair facilities had always existed and were further developed. The undertaking became a private limited liability company in December 1888.<br>
<br>Gray was active in public affairs, serving the Hartlepool port and harbour commission for many years, latterly as chairman. He was mayor of Hartlepool in 1861 and was re-elected the following year. On the incorporation of West Hartlepool in 1887, he was its first mayor; later he became the first person to receive its honorary freedom. He was knighted in 1890 and made president of the chamber of shipping in the following year. He also served on the parliamentary load-line committee and was a director of the North Eastern Railway. He was denied the opportunity to represent Hartlepool as its MP when, standing as a Liberal Unionist in 1891, he was narrowly defeated by Sir Christopher Furness. He served as a JP for many years and in 1892 was made high sheriff of the county of Durham. Gray was also a considerable philanthropist. A staunch Presbyterian, he largely cleared the debts of the churches in the presbytery of Darlington, as well as of all the nonconformist places of worship in the Hartlepools.<br>
<br>On the death of his son Matthew, in 1896, Gray took over the rolling mills of the West Hartlepool Steel and Iron Company. By now his own health was failing and he died of a paralytic stroke at his home, The Cottage, Greatham, West Hartlepool, on 12 September 1898. He was buried at West Hartlepool on 15 September. His surviving son, William Cresswell Gray (1867&#150;1924), continued the family involvement in the business, becoming chairman of the company. He was created a baronet in 1917.<br>
<br>Like many businessmen of his era, there seems to have been little to distinguish Gray's public life from his private one, so involved was he in business, civic, and religious matters. The esteem in which he was held was evidenced by the erection of a bronze statue in West Hartlepool, of whose development he had been the principal agent. His worldly success was attested to by his personal fortune, which exceeded &pound;1.5 million.<br>
