<span class="headword">Pocock,  Nicholas</span>  (1814&#150;1897), <span class="occ">historian</span>, born at Falmouth in January 1814, was the eldest son of Nicholas Pocock of Falmouth and the grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22425/', "Nicholas Pocock (1740&#150;1821)")</script>, the marine painter. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22422/', "Isaac Pocock")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22429/', "William Innes Pocock")</script> were his uncles. He was educated at a private school in Devon by the Revd John Manly, and on 3 February 1831 matriculated from Queen's College, Oxford, as Michel exhibitioner; in 1834 he was elected scholar. He graduated BA in that year with a first class in the final mathematical school, and a second class in <i>literae humaniores</i>. In 1835 he won the Johnson mathematical scholarship and the senior mathematical scholarship in 1836. In 1837 he proceeded MA, and in 1838 he became Michel fellow of Queen's, where he was afterwards mathematical lecturer. He had the reputation of being the best mathematical tutor of his time, and among his pupils was Bartholomew Price; he was public examiner in mathematics in 1839, 1844, and 1848, and in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1842 and 1852. He was ordained deacon in 1838 and priest in 1855, but never held any ecclesiastical preferment. He married in 1852 Edith, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22776/', "James Cowles Prichard")</script> and his wife, Anne Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Estlin, and retired to Clifton, Bristol, where he spent the remainder of his life with the exception of a year when he was in charge of Codrington College, Barbados. He died at home at 5 Worcester Terrace, Clifton, on 4 March 1897, and was survived by his widow and several sons and daughters.<br>
<br>Pocock edited in 1847 the third edition of Hammond's <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Theological Works</span>, and in 1852 published <span class="italic">The First Two Books of Euclid &hellip; with Additional Figures</span>. Afterwards he devoted himself almost exclusively to the history of the Reformation in England. His great work was his monumental edition of Gilbert Burnet's <span class="italic">History of the Reformation</span>, published in seven volumes by the Clarendon Press in 1864&#150;5; the seventh volume consists entirely of Pocock's dissertations on Burnet's authorities, sources, and errors, and the whole work embodies the results of much careful and laborious research. He made an extensive collection of original records, two volumes of which were issued by the Clarendon Press in 1871 as <span class="italic">Records of the Reformation</span>; poor sales stopped the series at 1535. Pocock's collections remained for the most part in manuscript with the exception of those published in <span class="italic">Troubles Connected with the Prayer Book of 1549</span> (published by the Camden Society in 1884). Pocock also edited for the Camden Society Harpsfield's <span class="italic">Treatise of the Pretended Divorce of Catherine of Aragon</span> (1878) and contributed numerous articles on Reformation history to the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>, <span class="italic">Union Review</span>, <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, <span class="italic">Church Quarterly Review</span>, and <span class="italic">English Historical Review</span>, and to <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> and <span class="italic">The Academy</span>. He was one of the early contributors to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>. Pocock did much to discredit the traditional protestant view of the Reformation, but he maintained quite a strong Anglican perspective on it. His documents were quite soundly edited and remain of value.<br>
<br>Pocock's other works include <span class="italic">The Ritual Commission</span> (1872), <span class="italic">The Abolition of the Thirty-Nine Articles</span> (3 parts, 1874), <span class="italic">The Principles of the Reformation</span> (1875), and <span class="italic">The Recovery from the Principles of the Reformation</span> (1877).<br>
