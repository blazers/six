<span class="headword">Waller,  Augustus D&eacute;sir&eacute;</span>  (1856&#150;1922), <span class="occ">physiologist</span>, was born in Paris on 12 July 1856, the only son and younger child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28555/', "Augustus Volney Waller FRS (1816&#150;1870)")</script>, physiologist, and his wife, Matilda Margaret Walls, daughter of John Walls, a solicitor. The family lived in turn in Paris, England, and Switzerland until the death of his father in 1870 when, with his mother and his sister, Matilda Amelia (<i>b</i>. 1845), he moved to Aberdeen. He was educated at the Coll&egrave;ge de Gen&egrave;ve and entered the University of Aberdeen in 1874, where he graduated MB in 1878 and MD in 1881. He joined the department of physiology at University College, London, in 1879 as a research scholar of the British Medical Association. In 1883 he became lecturer in physiology at the Royal Free Hospital and in 1884 lecturer in physiology at St Mary's Hospital. He remained there until 1903, when he was appointed the first, and only, director of the newly founded University of London Physiological Laboratory, established in the former Imperial Institute in South Kensington mainly as a result of Waller's initiative. In 1885 he married Alice Mary (1859&#150;1922), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21184/', "George Palmer")</script>, MP for Reading and founder of the biscuit manufacturers Huntley and Palmer. They had three sons and two daughters; there were no grandchildren.<br>
<br>Waller's research interests started in the emerging field of electro-physiology, in which he made useful contributions to the study of fatigue in muscle and the nature of cardiac potentials. He made the first recording of the human electrocardiogram in 1887, an important advance which, in other hands, had widespread applications in medicine. He studied the physiological actions of volatile anaesthetics, stressing the importance of quantitative measurement. Other subjects included human energy metabolism, bio-electro phenomena in tissues, and psycho-physiology. He was dedicated to experimental work and wrote many scientific papers; he also wrote a manual of experimental physiology for medical students, and a major <span class="italic">Introduction to Human Physiology</span> (1891).<br>
<br>Physiology dominated Waller's adult life. He was ambitious to be recognized as a physiologist as successful as his father. But physiology was also a family activity; he had a laboratory at his spacious home in London. His wife and children took part in experiments, entertained visiting scientists, and travelled with him to conferences at home and abroad. He was a keen motorist, enjoyed skiing, skating, golf, and billiards, and kept a large family of bulldogs. One of these, Jimmie, was used by him for a harmless demonstration of the electrocardiogram at the Royal Society and became the subject of a famous parliamentary reply to a question from the anti-vivisection lobby  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5C</span>, 8 July 1909). Waller was argumentative, opinionated, and sometimes outspoken, but he had a sense of humour (&#145;I am the Wallerian degeneration&#146; in reference to his father's eponymous discovery) and he retained an unworldly delight in science throughout his life.<br>
<br>Waller was elected FRS in 1892 and gave the Croonian lecture in 1896. Other honours included the Monthyon medal of the French Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences (1888), the Prix Aldini from Bologna (1892), and honorary degrees from the universities of Edinburgh (1905), Western Australia (1914), and Tomsk (1914). He was Fullerian professor of physiology at the Royal Institution in 1897 and became a professor in the University of London in 1912. Waller died in London on 11 March 1922 and was buried in a family grave in Finchley cemetery.<br>
