<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dekker,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1572&#150;1632), <span class="occ">playwright and pamphleteer</span>, is of obscure origins, and his own words are often the only source for personal details. Nothing is known of his parents, though his name suggests that he was of Dutch descent. His date of birth is generally given as about 1572 from the epistle dedicatory to <span class="italic">English Villainies</span> (1632) in which Dekker refers to &#145;my three-score years&#146;. He had already hinted at his declining years in the dedication to <span class="italic">Match mee in London</span> (1631), claiming: &#145;I have been a priest in Apollo's temple many years; my voice is decaying with my age&#146;. In all probability he was born in London, where he lived all his life. Dekker consistently presented himself as the city's devoted and nurtured son. Writing about London in <span class="italic">The Seven Deadly Sinnes</span> (1606), Dekker claimed that &#145;from thy womb received I my being, from thy brests my nourishment&#146;  (sig. A3<i>v</i>). Years later, in <span class="italic">A Rod for Run-Awayes</span> (1625), he still presented himself as one of London's sons: &#145;O London! (thou Mother of my life, Nurse of my being)&#146;  (sig. B<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>There is no evidence regarding Dekker's education; no reference that he attended university, or any sign that he had any special familiarity with the inns of court. However, his writing strongly suggests that he had a grammar school education. An accomplished Latin scholar, he translated Fredriech Dedekind's Latin poem <span class="italic">Grobianus</span> as <span class="italic">The Guls Horne-Book</span> (1609). Dekker had an extensive working knowledge of the classics, including Ovid, Horace, Virgil, and Martial. He was an avid reader of contemporary authors, and Stow, Holinshed, and Harrington were all sources for his writing. In <span class="italic">A Knight's Conjuring</span> (1607) he writes of an authors' Elysium, where he pays special tribute to &#145;old Chaucer&#146; and &#145;his son&#146;, &#145;grave Spenser&#146;. Among the others who were there, but &#145;in another company&#146;, were Thomas Kyd, Christopher Marlowe, Robert Greene, George Peele, and his old friend and collaborator Henry Chettle, all of whom watch as Thomas Nashe arrives denouncing &#145;dry-fisted patrons&#146;. Dekker's sole livelihood was writing. He was principally a playwright, though he later turned his hand to non-dramatic pamphlets, mayoral pageants and public entertainments, satires, commendatory verse, and other poetry. That Dekker, unlike many of his contemporary writers, had no consistent patron, no financial investments in either the theatre or the printing industry, and was not an actor, meant that he was constantly shadowed by debt. From topical and thematic issues in his writing to moments of personal crisis, debt had a marked effect upon his career. Sometimes it overwhelmed him. He was imprisoned for debt in 1598 and 1599, and he spent seven years from 1612 to 1619 in the king's bench prison, during which time his first wife, Mary, died. She was buried in St James, Clerkenwell, on 24 July 1616. The couple had three daughters whose baptisms are all recorded in the register of St Giles, Cripplegate: Dorcas, baptized on 27 October 1594; Elizabeth, on 29 November 1598; and Anne, on 24 October 1602.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsasaplaywright15941602"></a>Early years as a playwright, 1594&#150;1602</h2>In January 1598 Dekker makes his first appearance in Henslowe's diary. The record shows that Philip Henslowe, on behalf of the Lord Admiral's Men, laid out &pound;4 &#145;to bye a boocke of mr dicker called fayeton&#146;  (<span class="italic">Henslowe's Diary</span>, ed. Foakes and Rickert, 86), a play Dekker later revised for the court for a further 30<i>s</i>. Henslowe's accounts reveal that between the beginning of 1598 and the end of 1602, Dekker had a hand in over forty plays, including script doctoring and revising both his own plays and those of other writers. All but a handful of these plays are lost. Involved in at least fifteen plays in 1598 alone&#151;the year in which Henslowe began keeping details of the dramatists responsible for each play&#151;Dekker may be considered an accomplished playwright at this stage. In his literary review published in that year, <span class="italic">Palladis tamia</span>, Francis Mere names Dekker alongside William Shakespeare, Michael Drayton, George Chapman, and Ben Jonson as &#145;our best for Tragedy&#146;. The best evidence of Dekker's experience as a writer prior to 1598 is his involvement in the play <span class="italic">Sir Thomas More</span>, the manuscript of which is in the British Library. Never staged, the play was written about 1593&#150;4 for the Lord Strange's Men and the Admiral's Men who acted together at that time. It seems likely that Anthony Munday wrote the lion's share of the original play, possibly with Chettle and Dekker (with Dekker writing the &#145;prentices scene&#146;). The play then ran into problems with both the theatre company and the master of the revels, Edmund Tilney, who seemed unwilling to give it a licence. Dekker is among those brought in to revise the play, and thirty-one lines in his own handwriting have been identified. Other hands also distinguished are those of Shakespeare, Chettle, and, possibly, Thomas Heywood.<br>
<br>According to Henslowe's diary, until the end of 1602 Dekker was sole author of just seven plays: &#145;Phaeton&#146; (January 1598, and altered for the court in 1601); &#145;The Triplicity of Cuckolds&#146; (March 1598); &#145;The Gentle Craft&#146; (July 1599), published in 1600 as <span class="italic">The Shomakers Holiday</span> after being played before Elizabeth I at court on new year's night; &#145;Bear a Brain&#146; (August 1599); &#145;The Whole History of Fortunatus&#146; (November 1599), published in 1600 as <span class="italic">The Pleasant Comedie of Old Fortunatus</span> (which Dekker also altered for the court in December 1599); &#145;Medicine for a Curst Wife&#146; (September 1602); and &#145;Fortune's Tennis&#146; (September 1600). <span class="italic">The Shoemaker's Holiday</span> has become Dekker's most famous play. Although the play concludes with a feast and the eponymous holiday, it carefully depicts some of the cultural tensions of contemporary London society. It combines much which marks Dekker's style, including a compassionate and sensitive presentation of lower-class characters and an intimate depiction of London.<br>
<br>Writing for Henslowe was predominantly a collaborative business. During this period Dekker mainly worked with Drayton, Chettle, and Robert Wilson, in a variety of configurations, and in association with other playwrights. In just over two months, Dekker, Chettle, Drayton, and Wilson produced five plays: &#145;The Famous Wars of Henry I&#146; (March 1598), &#145;Godwin and his Three Sons&#146; (March 1598), &#145;Pierce of Exton&#146; (April 1598), &#145;Black Batman of the North&#146; (May 1598), and &#145;Godwin, part II&#146; (June 1598). For the rest of 1598 Dekker worked with Drayton and Wilson, producing: &#145;Madman's Morris&#146; (July 1598), &#145;Hannibal and Hermes&#146; (July 1598), &#145;Pierce of Winchester&#146; (August 1598), &#145;Hannibal and Hermes, part II&#146;, otherwise called, by Henslowe, &#145;Worse Afeared than Hurt&#146; (September 1598). With Drayton alone, Dekker wrote: &#145;The First Civil Wars of France&#146; (September 1598), &#145;Conan, Prince of Cornwall&#146; (October 1598), &#145;The Civil Wars of France, part II&#146; (November 1598), and &#145;The Civil Wars of France, part III&#146; (December 1598). Early in the new year he joined Henry Chettle to write: &#145;Troilus and Cressida&#146; (April 1599), of which a plot fragment survives; &#145;The Tragedy of Agamemnon, or, Orestes Furious&#146; (May 1599); &#145;The Stepmother's Tragedy&#146; (October 1599). Towards the end of 1599 Dekker and Chettle worked with Jonson &#145;&amp; other Jentellman&#146; (probably John Marston) to produce &#145;Robert II, or, The Scot's tragedy&#146; (September 1599); and with William Haughton for <span class="italic">Patient Grissill</span> (November&#150;December 1599), published in 1603. Amid the period with Chettle, Dekker co-authored &#145;The Lamentable Tragedy of Page of Plymouth&#146; (August 1599) solely with Jonson.<br>
<br>About this time Dekker's collaborations became more varied. In early 1600 he joined Haughton and John Day to write &#145;The Spanish Moor's tragedy&#146; (February 1600), which possibly appeared later as <span class="italic">Lusts Dominion</span>, published in 1657. Chettle joined Haughton, Day, and Dekker for &#145;The Seven Wise Masters&#146; (March 1600); and Dekker, Chettle, and Day wrote &#145;The Golden Ass, [or], Cupid and Psyche&#146; (April&#150;May 1600). A month later he worked with four other writers&#151;Drayton, Richard Hathway, Anthony Munday, and Wilson&#151;to produce &#145;The Fair Constance of Rome&#146; (June 1600). After this play Dekker's prodigious output for Henslowe and the Admiral's Men tapered off; and the only play recorded in Henslowe's diary for the whole of 1601 is &#145;King Sebastion of Portugal&#146; (May 1601), written with Chettle. Apart from those which were published, all of these plays are lost.<br>
<br>Towards the end of 1600 Dekker's exclusive relationship with Henslowe and the Admiral's Men came to an end as his pen was employed by other companies. How much this change was a consequence of his involvement in the so-called &#145;war of the theatres&#146; is difficult to say. The first play identified as Dekker's after his departure from Henslowe is <span class="italic">Satiro-mastix</span> (entered in the Stationers' register, 11 November 1601), published in 1602. The play appears to be located on the cusp of the stage quarrel, being produced by both the Paul's Boys (boy actors were in vogue at the time) in a private theatre (Paul's), and by adult actors of the Chamberlain's Men at a traditional public theatre (Globe). Competition between public and private theatres, and rivalry between the companies, underpinned the &#145;war&#146;.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Satiro-mastix</span> was, in part, a response to Jonson's attack on Marston and Dekker which seems to have begun in <span class="italic">Every Man out of His Humour</span> (1599), and culminated in <span class="italic">Cynthia's Revels</span> (1600) and <span class="italic">Poetaster</span> (1601). In <span class="italic">Poetaster</span>, Marston is represented as Crispinus, a dilettante and impecunious poet who turns to writing for players, whereupon he encounters Demetrius Fannius, representing Dekker, a hack writer, &#145;a dresser of plays about the town&#146;, one who will slander any man for money&#151;not least the poet Horace, in whom Jonson thinly disguises himself. With possible assistance from Marston, Dekker's responding mockery in <span class="italic">Satiro-mastix</span> recasts Crispinus and Demetrius as reputable young men who see Horace as a pompous, selfish, and sycophantic hypocrite. Although some of the mud stuck in this slanging match, Dekker's play was the last salvo in the writers' conflict and they became friends again soon after.<br>
<br>Not directly part of the quarrel, Dekker wrote another play at this time for the Paul's Boys: <span class="italic">Blurt Master-Constable</span> (1602), hitherto thought to have been the work of Thomas Middleton. This means that Dekker wrote only four plays between September 1600 and January 1602, whereupon he resumed working for Henslowe. And, although published in 1602, it is possible that his commendatory verses for Anthony Munday, <span class="italic">The Third and Last Part of Palmerin of England</span>, were written in 1601. Such little writing appears to be anomalous, and would have hardly constituted a living for the playwright. However, if Dekker wrote anything else for the Paul's Boys or another non-Henslowe company there are no records.<br>
<br>Dekker's return to Henslowe was as a play dresser. He supplied the prologue and epilogue to &#145;Pontius Pilate&#146; (January 1602); and provided alterations to &#145;Tasso's Melancholy&#146; (<i>c</i>.1602) which had appeared previously in 1594. With Munday he wrote &#145;Jeptha&#146; (May 1602); and in collaboration with Munday, Drayton, Middleton, and Webster, he produced &#145;Caesar's Fall, or, The Two Shapes&#146; (May 1602). But his relationship with the company with whom he had worked for at least the last four years was starting to unravel. In July 1602 Dekker was paid &pound;4 on behalf of the Admiral's Men in part payment for &#145;Medicine for a Curst Wife&#146; (July&#150;September 1602); Henslowe cancelled these payments, only to restore them later. By September, Dekker had been paid &pound;6 in full for the play on behalf of the Lord Worcester's Men, in whose employ he remained for the rest of the year. For them he revamped the 1599 Admiral's Men's play <span class="italic">Sir John Oldcastle</span> by writing additions to it for <span class="italic">Sir John Oldcastle, Part II</span> (September 1602). With Webster, Chettle, Heywood, and Wentworth Smith, he wrote &#145;Lady Jane, or, The Overthrow of Rebels, part I&#146; (October 1602); and a few weeks later he alone was contracted to write &#145;Lady Jane, part II&#146; (October 1602). Whether the latter was completed is unclear; however, the &#145;Lady Jane&#146; plays survive in an abridged and modified form as <span class="italic">The Famous History of Sir Thomas Wyatt</span>, published in 1607 with Dekker and Webster cited as the authors. Dekker's last play prior to Elizabeth's death was written with Webster, Chettle, and Heywood: &#145;Christmas Comes but Once a Year&#146; (November 1602). Apart from <span class="italic">Sir Thomas Wyatt</span>, all his 1602 output is lost.<br>
<br>Dekker's time as a prolific writer of plays within Henslowe's circle of playwrights was coming to a close. Only Chettle, his old friend and collaborator, appears in Henslowe's accounts to have been more productive. More than once Henslowe lent Dekker money to discharge his debts, though keeping his writers out of gaol was good business practice as much as beneficence.<h2>
<a name="Otherwriting16031619"></a>Other writing, 1603&#150;1619</h2>Until the end of 1602 Dekker could be considered the consummate Elizabethan playwright: writing popular plays for a broad audience across a range of topics and genres, often lacing them with the prosaic aspects of London life. Yet Elizabeth's passing, initially at least, appeared to provide increased opportunities for the versatile and established writer. In 1603 Dekker and his old rival Jonson were commissioned to write London's official greeting of the new king: <span class="italic">The Magnificent Entertainment Given to King James</span>, published in 1604. Following this Dekker wrote commendatory verses for Stephen Harrison's <span class="italic">The Arches of Triumph Erected in Honour of James I</span> (1604). Unfortunately the virulent plague which delayed <span class="italic">The Magnificent Entertainment</span> kept returning and closing the theatres; and it was the stage which provided Dekker's main source of income. In response Dekker turned to writing pamphlets for London's increasing book trade. His first was a eulogy for Elizabeth, written through images of the plague, entitled <span class="italic">The Wonderfull Yeare</span> (1603). Plague as a topic proved to be surprisingly popular and this pamphlet was followed by <span class="italic">Newes from Gravesend</span> (1604).<br>
<br>But working for London's pamphlet publishers and booksellers did not pay as well as writing plays and as soon as the theatres reopened Dekker returned to producing for the stage. On the accession of James I, his old company came under new management: the Admiral's Men became Prince Henry's Men. For the new company Dekker joined Middleton to write <span class="italic">The Honest Whore, Part I</span> (1604); this was followed by <span class="italic">The Honest Whore, Part II</span> (1605) which he wrote alone. At the same time, with Webster, he also found employment with the Paul's Boys, producing <span class="italic">Westward Hoe</span> (1604) and <span class="italic">Northward Hoe</span> (1605), both published in 1607. It is likely that <span class="italic">The Roaring Girle</span> (1605?), in collaboration with Middleton, was Dekker's last happy experience with playwriting for some time.<br>
<br>About 1606 the Paul's Boys collapsed, and soon after Dekker fell out with Prince Henry's Men. <span class="italic">The Whore of Babylon</span> (1607), an anti-papist jibe, was not a dramatic success, and he did not write another play for the next four years. In 1611 he wrote <span class="italic">If this be not Good the Divel is in it</span> for Prince Henry's Men, but they turned it down. Bitter and upset, Dekker touted the play around until it was taken up by the Queen's Majesty's Company at the Red Bull Theatre. Many theatre companies were experiencing difficulties through plague and competition, and Dekker found it difficult to gauge the audiences' taste which seemed to prefer sharp satires and gory tragedies&#151;genres which, in the main, Dekker eschewed.<br>
<br>As Dekker's dramatic production tapered off, so his pamphlet writing increased. He cast his literary net wide looking for a readership to sustain him. His non-dramatic writing of this period began with <span class="italic">The Double PP</span> (1606) which, like <span class="italic">The Whore of Babylon</span>, attempted to cash in on anti-Catholic sentiment following the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot. More viable was <span class="italic">The Seven Deadly Sinnes of London</span> (1606), a lively satire on city life. Dekker returned to writing plague texts in his homage to Thomas Nashe's <span class="italic">Pierce Penilesse, his Supplication to the Divell</span> entitled <span class="italic">Newes from Hell</span> (1606). Both tracts are predicated upon the precarious status of authorship at this time. Dekker expanded <span class="italic">Newes from Hell</span> to produce <span class="italic">A Knight's Conjuring</span> (1607). Not least of the pamphlet writer's discontent was the fact that, without copyright or royalties, authors got a one-off fee for their work. Consequently much of the writing was produced in haste, which often had deleterious effects on its literary merit. <span class="italic">Jests to Make you Merie</span>, with George Wilkins (1607), <span class="italic">The Dead Tearme</span> (1607), and <span class="italic">The Great Frost: Cold Doings in London, Except it be at the Lotterie</span> (1608) suffer from these effects to a certain degree.<br>
<br>A more productive method, deployed by Dekker, consisted of reworking his own writing and that of others, to generate a &#145;new&#146; pamphlet for the publisher and reader. In so doing Dekker drew upon and updated Elizabethan writers such as John Awdeley, Thomas Harman, Robert Greene, and Nashe, for his cony-catching and canting literature. The first of these was <span class="italic">The Belman of London</span> (1608); a sequel, <span class="italic">Lanthorn and Candle-Light, or, The Bell-Mans Second Nights Walke</span> (1608) became one of Dekker's most popular pamphlets, and went through at least nine editions in the next forty years. Notable among those editions are <span class="italic">O per se O &hellip; being an Addition, or Lengthening, of the Bell-Mans Second Night-Walke</span> (1612) and <span class="italic">Villainies Discovered &hellip; Being an Addition to the Bell-Mans Second Night-Walke</span> (1616). His best-known non-dramatic work, <span class="italic">The Guls Horne-Book</span> (1608), was published in 1609, and remained popular into the Restoration. Also published about this time were <span class="italic">The Ravens Almanacke</span> (1609), <span class="italic">Worke for Armourers</span> (1609), and <span class="italic">Foure Birds of Noahs Ark</span> (1609).<br>
<br>Between 1610 and 1612 Dekker's output is very thin, and the reasons for this are not as clear as the consequences. Apart from the troubled <span class="italic">If this be not Good</span> and a pamphlet, <span class="italic">A Strange Horse-Race</span> (1613), Dekker's only other work was a commission for Sir John Swinerton's mayoral pageant: <span class="italic">Troia-Nova triumphans</span> (October 1612). Whatever money he received for this, it was not enough to keep him from being arrested for debt later that year. He owed &pound;40 to the coach maker John Webster (the playwright's father), who began a suit against him in the king's bench in 1613. Dekker spent the next seven years in the king's bench prison.<br>
<br>If imprisonment effectively stopped Dekker's dramatic output, it did not arrest his writing altogether&#151;although it certainly hampered its quality. In 1615 he reworked an earlier tract, <span class="italic">The Great Frost</span>, to produce <span class="italic">The Cold Yeare 1614</span>. About the same time he wrote <span class="italic">The Artillery Garden</span>, published in 1616, and commendatory verses for John Taylor's <span class="italic">Taylor's Urania, or, His Heavenly Muse</span>. Attempting to profit as much as possible from his situation, Dekker looked to expand the writing on prisons and prisoners which he had begun in <span class="italic">Villainies Discovered</span> (1616). He proceeded to add six &#145;prison characters&#146; to those published under <span class="italic">Sir Thomas Overburie his Wife</span> (1616), and in 1617 he contributed to Geoffrey Mynshull's <span class="italic">Certain Characters and Essays of Prisons and Prisoners</span>, published in 1618. Dekker was finally released some time in 1619, and in October that year he completed <span class="italic">Dekker his Dreame</span>&#151;a disturbing and disjointed poem which bears the marks of his traumatic &#145;long sleep&#146; in prison. He wrote that his hair had<blockquote>
<div class="indent">turn'd <i>white</i>
<br>
</div>
<div>More through the <i>Ghastly Objects</i> of this <i>Night</i>,<br>
</div>
<div>Then with the <i>Snow</i> of <i>Age</i>.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Dekker his Dreame</span>, 1620, 37)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Thelateryears16201632"></a>The later years, 1620&#150;1632</h2>On release from gaol Dekker quickly re-established himself as a playwright by producing <span class="italic">Match mee in London</span> (1620, published 1631), to be played at the Red Bull Theatre. The up-and-coming Philip Massinger joined him to write <span class="italic">The Virgin Martyr</span> (1620). Based on current events, <span class="italic">The Witch of Edmonton</span> (1621, published 1658), with William Rowley and John Ford, became one of his more popular works. Dekker joined John Day to write three plays: <span class="italic">The Noble Spanish Souldier</span> (1622?); &#145;The Bellman of Paris&#146; (1623), now lost; and <span class="italic">The Wonder of a Kingdom</span> (1623?). &#145;A Moral Masque&#146; was the subtitle of <span class="italic">The Sun's-Darling</span> (1624, published 1656) which he co-wrote with Ford. The same team produced another &#145;masque&#146;, &#145;The Fairy Knight&#146; (1624), and &#145;The Bristow Merchant&#146; (1624), both lost. Dekker alone may have been responsible for reworking <span class="italic">The Noble Spanish Souldier</span> into &#145;The Welsh Ambassador&#146; (1624). With Ford, Rowley, and Webster, Dekker put together &#145;The Late Murder in Whitechapel, or, Keep the Widow Waking&#146; (1624), now lost. The play was based on two notorious crimes which had caught the contemporary imagination. Records survive of Dekker's testimony, given when a relative of one depicted in the play brought the matter to court.<br>
<br>London's 1625 plague took its toll on life, theatre, and, in all probability, Dekker's livelihood. Charges of recusancy brought against him in 1626 and 1628 are almost certainly due to the fact that he avoided church in order to escape arrest for debt. He did pick up some work at this time, writing the inaugural pageants for various incoming mayors of London: a pageant for Sir Hugh Hamersley (1627), now lost; <span class="italic">Brittannia's Honour</span> (1628) for R. Deane; and <span class="italic">Londons Tempe</span> (1629) for J. Campbell. In the second half of the 1620s Dekker turned to pamphleteering once again. His non-dramatic writing of this period includes: <span class="italic">A Rod for Run-Awayes</span> (1625), <span class="italic">Looke Up and See Wonders</span> (1628), <span class="italic">Warres, Warres, Warres</span> (1628), <span class="italic">London Looke Backe</span> (1630), <span class="italic">The Blacke Rod: and the White Rod</span> (1630), and <span class="italic">Penny-Wise, Pound-Foolish</span> (1630). The commendatory verses which Dekker wrote for Richard Brome's play <span class="italic">The Northern Lasse</span> (1632) could well have been his last piece of work, although it is tempting to think that his last written words were those in the 1632 epistle to his most popular tract, <span class="italic">The Belman of London</span> (now called <span class="italic">English Villainies</span>) in which he claimed to be sixty years old.<br>
<br>Dekker's output ceased in 1632 and it seems probable that the &#145;Thomas Decker, householder&#146; who was buried at St James, Clerkenwell, on 25 August that year is the author. His widow, Elizabeth, renounced the administration of his estate on 4 September 1632, a sure sign that Dekker died in debt.<br>
<br>Jonson's accusation that Dekker was a hack, Charles Lamb's backhanded compliment that he had &#145;poetry enough for anything&#146;, and Swinburne's dislike of his carelessness, were all pointed at a someone whose writing was predominantly driven by financial pressure. From comments such as these a strand of criticism developed which depicted Dekker as a good-natured and versatile journeyman writer&#151;jack of all trades, master of none&#151;operating in the shadow of Shakespeare, Jonson, Middleton, and others. Often charged with being sentimental, Dekker's writing does reveal a sustained compassion for society's misfits and casualties. Perhaps Hazlitt had this in mind when he called him &#145;gentle-hearted&#146; and &#145;honest&#146;. More recent scholarship has been less condescending, seeing in Dekker's work an incisive commentary on the social, political, and religious structure of London. That Dekker's work encompasses such a wide range of views and genres bears testimony to a writer whose career spanned more than thirty-five years, who was continuously productive under three monarchs, and who survived poverty, plague, and prison.<br>
