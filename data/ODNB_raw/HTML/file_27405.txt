<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thurloe,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1616, <em>d.</em> 1668), <span class="occ">government official</span>, was baptized on 12 June 1616, the only son of Thomas Thurloe (<i>bap</i>. 1578, <i>d</i>. 1633), rector of Abbess Roding, Essex, and his wife, Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1637), widow of a Mr Ewer, with whom she had three sons, including the regicide <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9015/', "Isaac Ewer (d. 1650/51)")</script>.<h2>
<a name="Earlylife"></a>Early life</h2>Thurloe's father, who was probably from Landbeach, Cambridgeshire, matriculated from Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, about 1593, and graduated BA in 1598 and MA in 1610. He was presented to Abbess Roding in 1612 but died in November 1633. Administration of the estate was secured to Sarah Thurloe in January 1634 by their son. John Thurloe's first marriage, in or before 1636, was to a member of the Peyton family, possibly related to Sir Robert Peyton of Wisbech. She died soon afterwards and their two sons died in infancy. His second marriage was to Ann Lytcott or Lycott (<i>b</i>. 1620, <i>d</i>. after 1674), daughter of Sir John Lytcott and nephew of Sir Thomas Overbury; they had four sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Thurloe's first patron, the lawyer and politician Oliver St John, claimed that he was &#145;bred from a youth&#146; in his service. He was sponsored through Furnival's Inn by St John, who employed him as &#145;a sort of personal assistant&#146;  (Aubrey, 9). He appears as a witness in St John's legal business from 1637. In the 1630s he was a trustee for Oliver Cromwell's aunt, Lady Joan Barrington, as well as legal agent for St John, the husband of a favourite cousin of Cromwell, so his relationship with the latter probably dates from this period. In January 1645 he acted as secretary to St John and the other parliamentarian commissioners at the abortive peace negotiations at Uxbridge. He was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 6 July 1646 for a fee of &pound;3 10<i>s</i>., and acted for St John as a legatee of the earl of Essex. In June 1647 he was one of Richard Cromwell's sureties at Lincoln's Inn. In March 1648 he became clerk or receiver of the cursitors' fines (fees), a post under the commissioners of the great seal. He later claimed, with regard to the king's death, that &#145;he was altogether a stranger to that fact, and to all the counsels about it, having not had the least communication with any person whatsoever therein&#146;  (Thurloe, <span class="italic">State papers</span>, 7.914). In February 1650 he was made one of the treasurers of the company set up to drain the fens, in which capacity he assisted in draining the south level near Ely, one of the smaller drainage channels being named after him. He was allotted 500 acres of drainage land and became deputy governor of the company in 1656. In October 1650 he appeared on Cromwell's behalf before the admiralty court and in January 1651 delivered a petition to the committee for compounding to recover Monmouthshire rents for him. In 1652 his association with St John led to his acting as a trustee of the Buckinghamshire estates of Cromwell's late son-in-law, Henry Ireton.<br>
<br>St John and Walter Strickland were sent to the United Provinces in early 1651 to negotiate an alliance and possibly a federal union on behalf of the English republic, and Thurloe accompanied them as secretary. In April he was sent back to London to secure an extension of the time allowed the ambassadors for their negotiations and immediately on his return wrote to the states general informing them the ambassadors would stay but warning of the need to redress assorted affronts the English believed themselves to have suffered. Cynical about Dutch goodwill, he informed Walter Frost, secretary of state, that the Dutch seemed to have learned from the Scots and the French to profess much but perform nothing, except as to their own advantage. Though the mission returned empty-handed, his career prospered.<h2>
<a name="Secretaryofstate16521658"></a>Secretary of state, 1652&#150;1658</h2>Thurloe's reliability in the Netherlands was probably the main reason for his appointment as secretary to the council of state on 29 March 1652 in succession to the late Walter Frost, with a salary of &pound;600 p.a. and &#145;convenient lodgings&#146; in Whitehall. On 1 December 1652 he took over as clerk to the committee for foreign affairs and on 8 July 1653 (after the fall of the Rump Parliament) was given direction of the intelligence service, replacing Thomas Scot, with his salary now set at &pound;800 p.a. On 22 December 1653 he &#145;took his place at the [council] board, being thereunto called by the Council&#146;, in effect, &#145;a full Councillor in all but name&#146;  (Aubrey, 37), though not appointed to the council of state in his own right until July 1657. He held the crucial co-ordinating role connected to the central organ of government from March 1652 to May 1659. Though he retained chambers at Lincoln's Inn (where he became a bencher in February 1654), was elected MP for Ely for 1654&#150;5 and 1656&#150;8, and was named a governor of the Charterhouse (November 1657) and chancellor of Glasgow University (February 1658), his time was devoted to his Whitehall affairs. From November 1655 he also had total control over the dissemination of news, with the banning of all printed newsbooks except the government controlled <span class="italic">Mercurius Politicus</span> and <span class="italic">Public Intelligencer</span>. His agents had the right to open all letters, providing him with a mass of information to assess. From 3 May 1655 he was postmaster-general, and from 1657 farmed the Post Office revenues for &pound;1000 p.a. He recruited a number of assistants including William Jessop for foreign affairs and Philip Meadowes to assist Milton with Latin translation. Samuel Moreland and the younger Isaac Dorislaus assisted with deciphering royalist codes.<br>
<br>Thurloe's intelligence work was crucial to the regime, given the extent of disaffection and the royalist threat, coupled with the possibilities of invasion, particularly from France. He took over and extended a large network of government informers and occasional correspondents, keeping watch on domestic disaffection, the movements of exiled royalists, and the intentions of foreign governments. His task was made easier not merely by his command of the state's resources, but by the amateurishness of the royalist plotters, while each of his cumulative successes dissuaded potential plotters as they added to the myth of the &#145;all seeing little secretary&#146;  (Marshall, 24). But his vigilance, ability to assess gossip and confessions, and repeated round-ups of suspects hamstrung most serious plots. Thus in January 1655 he broke up the midland arms network of the royalist &#145;action party&#146;, pursuing the investigation of their planned series of risings and thereby unravelling the series of planned conspiracies which in the end produced only Penruddock's revolt. He correctly reckoned that the royalist failure in spring 1655 would limit active resistance in future and discourage foreign meddling. Thereafter a number of double agents on the continent like Sir John Henderson and Henry Manning enabled him to keep watch on the court of Charles II and pre-empt further risings. Most notably, by November 1656 he had suborned Sir Richard Willys, or Willis, one of the leaders of the &#145;sealed knot&#146;. Henderson and Willys even visited London to meet Thurloe in secret, though Manning was detected by the royalists and shot in 1655. His information allowed him to arrest royalist plotters in southern England in the spring of 1658, plans for a London rising being &#145;allowed &hellip; to mature until its leaders had been given rope enough to hang themselves&#146;  (Underdown, 227). But small groups of dedicated men had always remained undetected and, most notably, he failed to stop Miles Sindercombe, who managed to plant incendiary materials in the chapel at Whitehall on 8 January 1657 before capture, having disregarded Jean-Baptiste Stouppe's warnings. The regime's formulation of foreign policy also depended on the accuracy and loyalty of his informants. Pepys later reported statements that Cromwell had allowed him &pound;70,000 p.a. &#145;and thereby carried all the secret of all the princes of Europe at his girdle&#146;  (Pepys, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 9.70&#150;71). Official payments to him for intelligence work rarely met his expenditures, and by May 1659 he was owed &pound;1665 3<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>. But his expenditure was nowhere near some post-Restoration estimates, and his successor, Morrice, put his resources at &pound;1200&#150;&pound;2000 p.a.<br>
<br>Thurloe played a central role in foreign affairs in his time as secretary. He corresponded not only with unofficial agents across Europe but also with English ambassadors abroad, beginning with Bulstrode Whitelocke, in Sweden, early in 1654, and drafted instructions for the various missions. He developed a lucid and relaxed style of correspondence, but insisted on being comprehensively informed of useful news. He also received and dealt with the ambassadors of lesser powers, though one such, the Venetian envoy, Paulucci, reckoned him &#145;most difficult of access and with scant knowledge of foreign affairs&#146;. Numerous committees on matters of foreign policy had &#145;Mr Secretary to assist&#146;  (Venning, 31). He took part in negotiations with the Dutch ambassadors in autumn 1653 and thereafter was the council's conduit to the resident ambassador, Nieupoort, and part of the negotiating team for the maritime treaty. He claimed, to Henry Cromwell, that the Dutch intended &#145;no goodwill to this nation or indeed to the Protestant cause, however they profess the contrary&#146;. From April 1654 he assisted the councillors delegated to negotiate simultaneously with rival French and Spanish ambassadors. According to Ellis Leighton he headed the council faction which was not fixedly pro-France or pro-Spain but sought to keep England free of formal treaty commitments to promote domestic stability and to keep France and Spain at war, though the French ambassadors' reports indicate that they believed him to be hostile. In negotiations with the Swedish ambassador, Count Bonde, in spring 1656 he was the tough talker who insisted that Sweden cease supplying pitch, tar, hemp, and flax to Spain, as they were of use in war. Bonde said that they were principal exports, and he retorted that in that case they could easily find new outlets. Thurloe formally joined the council of trade only in autumn 1656, and the Jamaica committee in October 1657. His brother-in-law Martin Noell, for example, was the government's principal supplier for the Caribbean expedition.<br>
<br>As with the council Thurloe's real influence was behind the scenes. His access to information and the range of his duties allowed him to develop a broader and more informed view than most of his colleagues. As to his views, he believed that Cromwell should become the <i>caput et dux feoderis protestantis</i>. But in his summary of protectoral foreign policy, written for Clarendon about 1660, he understandably chose to downplay the importance of protestant links as against strategic considerations. English policy, he claimed, was based on a fear of royalist invasion and of France as its principal promoter. Accordingly, Spain, the weaker power, was a less dangerous enemy. Thus England sought to contain France by aiding rebels in 1654&#150;6, and thereafter to tie it into alliance, but only when convenient to England. The acquisition of Dunkirk in 1658 was designed both to aid European protestants and to threaten France and the Dutch.<br>
<br>Thurloe took a greater role in Cromwell's second parliament than in its predecessor, being called upon to set forth government policy on various issues. On 25 December 1656 he spoke in favour of continuing the decimation tax on royalists, and may also have delivered a speech in January 1657 denouncing pre-1642 royal arbitrariness and religious oppression. On 7 March 1657 he announced the levying of more troops. He orchestrated the government's efforts in the spring to get all legislation passed since 1642 ratified and on 28 June he and other councillors recommended that Cromwell create a union of foreign protestants. But he is reckoned to have &#145;performed poorly in parliament and was out of his depth in the rough and tumble of the Commons&#146;  (Marshall, 66). With a commitment to conservative, constitutionalist politics and a lack of sympathy for the military, he took a leading role in encouraging Cromwell to take the crown, a debate which dominated his time in the spring of 1657, later complaining that Cromwell did not follow his instincts enough.<br>
<br>Thurloe's effectiveness was limited by bouts of serious ill health, one of which, in early 1658, indisposed him for weeks. Business was paralysed in his absence. As the Venetian ambassador, Giavarina, reported, &#145;all must pass through the hands of this Secretary, who alone attends to and superintends all the most important interests of State&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Venice</span>, <i>1655&#150;6</i>, 188). Cromwell placed complete trust in him: according to George Downing only Thurloe also knew the &#145;scheme of things&#146;  (Thurloe, <span class="italic">State papers</span>, 6.856) while in 1657 Bulstrode Whitelocke named him as one of the few intimates with whom Cromwell would &#145;lay aside his greatness&#146; and both discuss policy and relax to smoke a pipe and make verses  (<span class="italic">Diary of Bulstrode Whitelocke</span>, 464). Successive chief governors of Ireland, Charles Fleetwood and Henry Cromwell, relied on him for information and assistance. Outside commentators held a similar view: the 1656 satire <span class="italic">A Game of Picquet</span> depicted him watching Cromwell's advisers and proposing to &#145;stand behind a chair and make and shuffle the cards with which you are to play the next game&#146;.<h2>
<a name="FalloftheprotectorateandtheRestoration16581660"></a>Fall of the protectorate and the Restoration, 1658&#150;1660</h2>Thurloe had not abandoned hopes of reviving the kingship proposals as late as July 1658. When Cromwell lay dying he took the lead in persuading him to nominate his elder surviving son, Richard, as heir and subsequently acted as Richard's principal adviser. A serious rift arose between civilians such as Thurloe and senior army officers and another illness afflicted him that autumn. He was returned to Richard Cromwell's parliament in January 1659 for Huntingdon, Wisbech, and Cambridge University and chose to sit for the university. He probably drafted Richard's opening speech and on 1 February tackled disaffection head on by proposing a bill of recognition to legalize Richard's position and stop any reassertion of the Commons' powers, which he called tyranny. The government's principal business manager in parliament, he also gave a masterly analysis of their Baltic policy on 19 February, explaining the need for even-handedness between Sweden and Denmark to keep the sound open and castigating Dutch machinations. He somewhat desperately maintained that with God's help the protectorate could survive the hostility of the senior officers and the Commonwealthsmen in parliament. He alone advised Richard not to dissolve parliament as the army leader Desborough insisted.<br>
<br>Following the Rump's recall on 6 May, Thurloe was dismissed by the new council of state and Thomas Scot recalled. He refused to communicate his ciphers to Scot, calling him a &#145;noisy windbag&#146;. Turned out of his Whitehall lodgings to bystanders' jeers, he retired to John Upton's house at Hammersmith. He was approached in the summer of 1659 to assist the Restoration but refused. He also had to face a civil lawsuit claiming &pound;10,000 for wrongful imprisonment, and on 11 October 1659 parliament annulled his Post Office contract. He still kept up some correspondence abroad, and had leave to travel in and out of London without hindrance, taking new lodgings at Dial Court, Lincoln's Inn. He may have received support from his wife's relative, Colonel John Clarke, a member of the committee of safety from October 1659.<br>
<br>Thurloe's position improved with Monck's arrival in London, and on 2 February 1660 he began an attempt to reclaim about &pound;3000 for disbursements on intelligence and other matters. Monck secured his reappointment as joint secretary of state on 27 February and his Whitehall lodgings were restored. Monck also recommended him, unsuccessfully, as MP for Bridgnorth in the Convention. Unfortunately since the summer of 1659 his assistant, Moreland, had been secretly passing on his intelligence to the royalists. According to Moreland, Willys approached him on the king's behalf, but he replied &#145;I prefer to go the nation's pace, no faster&#146;  (Aubrey, 159). Preferring a limited protectorate, in May 1660 he was still working with St John and Pierrepoint to obtain Richard Cromwell's restoration, putting principle before safety. On 14 May the Convention House of Commons resolved that &#145;Mr Secretary Thurloe, being accused of high treason, be secured&#146; and that a committee examine him  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 8.26). According to rumour he had boasted that he had &#145;a black book which should hang half them that went for Cavaliers&#146; if he was prosecuted  (<span class="italic">Fifth Report</span>, HMC, 208). Whether or not he managed to blackmail the new government, on 27 June he was released and on 29 June the Commons resolved that he should have liberty to attend the secretaries of state, presumably to pass on his expertise. He was supposed to have met Clarendon, and his memoranda on foreign policy may be a result. On 8 August the Lords committee considering the <span class="roman">Bill of Indemnity</span> struck out the clause referring to him.<br>
<br>Thurloe retired into obscurity, living partly at Lincoln's Inn and partly at Great Milton in Oxfordshire. Apart from testifying to St John's innocence of regicide he kept out of politics, though in January 1661 some of his property was seized when Upton's house was searched. He was removed as governor of the Charterhouse in January 1661, along with Whitelocke, whose house at Anvills, Hungerford, he considered buying in 1667. On 22 May 1667 Whitelocke met him and his fellow ex-councillor Sir Charles Wolseley at a Greenwich conventicle where John Owen preached. His health declined quickly thereafter and in January 1668 he had a severe attack of the stone at Lincoln's Inn. On 21 February he had dinner at his chambers in Dial Court with his fellow ex-councillor Philip Jones, requested him to withdraw while he took some medicine, and as he returned collapsed into his arms &#145;but never spake word and immediately died&#146;, probably of a heart attack  (Aubrey, 210). He was buried in Lincoln's Inn chapel. He was survived by his second wife, who lived until at least 1674. John, the eldest of his three sons, was admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1672, acquired the manor of Astwood, Buckinghamshire, in 1674, and died in 1682.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>Giavarina wrote spitefully that from a &#145;mere lawyer's notary&#146; Thurloe had &#145;amassed a heap of gold&#146; and had shown &#145;utter absence of gratitude&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Venice</span>, <i>1659&#150;61</i>, 17). He does not appear to have been notably corrupt, but he did make financial gains, and could afford to build a grandiose new house&#151;possibly designed by John Webb&#151;at the confiscated Wisbech Castle. He had obtained the manors of Wisbech Barton, Elm, and Tydd St Giles during the 1650s, all previously episcopal property and all, like Wisbech Castle, repossessed by the bishop of Ely at the Restoration. In Richard Cromwell's parliament he was accused of receiving &pound;1000 p.a. from the farmers of the London ale and beer excise to keep them from lawsuits by the brewers. He did propose a giant fee farm for all duties except ale and beer, and a separate one for them, in 1657 but it was dropped. He was also accused of making excessive profits as postmaster-general and confidently prepared his accounts, but this was not pursued either. The only visible evidence is of two unsuccessful attempts to corrupt him&#151;Richard Wylde offered him &pound;500 p.a., a share in pearl fisheries, and a diamond for his wife if he secured the Surat consulship in the new East India Company&#151;he did not&#151;and the intelligencer Joseph Bampfield offered to divide the pre-emption of tin from Cornwall. Thurloe occasionally tried to exert influence on behalf of his relations, and Broghill in Scotland rebuked him concerning his intervention on behalf of his relative by marriage Colonel Lydcott in 1655, but not to an excessive extent, and Thurloe was more often the recipient of such requests for favours.<br>
<br>The importance of the &#145;little secretary&#146; to the protectoral regime cannot be exaggerated, both through his indispensability as central co-ordinator of government activity and his roles as chief of intelligence and resident expert on European affairs and royalist machinations. Like many intelligencers, his success owed much to luck and guesswork, and was mingled with failures, but he has been considered &#145;one of the forefathers of espionage and intelligence gathering in England&#146;  (Marshall, 304). He has been described as &#145;no radical, let alone revolutionary, but &hellip; a highly efficient and &hellip; honest public servant&#146;, but one &#145;out of his depth as a political and parliamentary leader&#146;  (Aylmer, 258&#150;9). Government policy coincided with his known views, but his dominance in input, under Richard Cromwell, was brief. His appetite for work, ability at assimilating information, shrewd judgement, and commitment to the protectorate are as evident as his quiet ruthlessness. His fate in 1659&#150;60 testifies both to his limited hold on power and his loyalty to his principles. Thurloe's papers, of major value for the history of the protectorate, were hidden behind a false ceiling in the garret of his chambers, discovered there in the reign of William III, sold to lord chancellor Somers and eventually presented to the Bodleian Library, Oxford.<br>
