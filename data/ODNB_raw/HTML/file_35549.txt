</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Plunkett, Sir  Horace Curzon</span>  (1854&#150;1932), <span class="occ">agricultural reformer and politician</span>, was born at Sherborne House, Gloucestershire, on 24 October 1854, the third of four sons and sixth of seven children of Edward Plunkett, sixteenth Baron Dunsany (1808&#150;1889), and his wife, the Hon. Anne Constance Dutton (1816&#150;1858), younger daughter of the second Baron Sherborne. Plunkett's mother died of consumption when he was three years old, and his father then moved the family from England to his hereditary home in Ireland, Dunsany Castle, co. Meath, where his remaining childhood was overshadowed by death and a depressing evangelical religious environment. Consumption also lost him a younger brother when he was ten, a sister when he was twelve, and his eldest brother when he was thirty. He was educated at Eton College and at University College, Oxford, where he obtained a second class in modern history in 1877. After Oxford he returned to Dunsany Castle, where he acted as agent for his father. Plunkett participated fully in the social life of the countryside, and particularly enjoyed hunting. Less typically for his social class, he established, in 1878, in association with the tenants on the estate, a Dunsany co-operative society, the germ of the idea that was to dominate his later life. In 1879, however, he left for America, after the threat of tuberculosis had dictated a drier climate. There, at Wyoming in the Rockies, he took up ranching, which he continued until the late 1880s. This gave him an experience of agriculture dramatically different from that of Ireland and contributed a perspective that was profoundly to influence his later attitudes.<br>
<br>It was primarily family responsibilities that brought Plunkett back to Ireland. His sole surviving brother, who lacked the aptitude for business, succeeded their father as Baron Dunsany in 1889, and the responsibility for the estate and other business activities then fell on Plunkett's shoulders. In addition, Plunkett had become guardian to his eldest sister's children after the death of their father in 1884. In recognition of the responsibilities likely to accrue to him, Plunkett's father left him a more substantial inheritance than he might otherwise have expected, and this gave him the financial independence to pursue the cause of agricultural co-operation, in which, he believed, lay the key to the future stability and well-being of Ireland.<br>
<br>Influenced by the ideas of the British co-operative movement, the robust and egalitarian life of the American west, and the agricultural modernization of Denmark, Plunkett evolved a model of co-operation to meet the particular conditions of Irish agriculture. Believing that the Irish small farmer required greater independence and autonomy, he set about building up a movement of mass participation in which rural communities could establish co-operatively the infrastructure for improved agricultural production, processing, and distribution. This ideal he encapsulated in the slogan &#145;Better farming, better business, better living&#146;. He saw in this method not only the prospect of greater material prosperity and a moral regeneration based on a new sense of community, but also an alternative social and moral order to the landlord system now in its demise.<br>
<br>However, Plunkett's efforts attracted the hostility of powerful forces in Irish politics and society. To his own class he appeared to be joining those arrayed against its traditional authority and continuing interests; to the nationalist party he was deflecting popular energies away from the overriding imperative of political independence; for the shopkeeper and money-lending class which provided much of the rural leadership of the parliamentary nationalist movement his ideas represented a threat to their business interests. He responded by taking a perverse pride in this multi-partisan opposition: he compared his own popularity with that of &#145;a dog on a tennis court&#146;, and cited it as evidence of the unwillingness of Irish politicians to confront the real practical issues that faced their society. In publishing the first comprehensive exposition of his philosophy, <span class="italic">Ireland in the New Century</span>, he included&#151;against the advice of friends&#151;attacks upon the role in Irish society of the Catholic clergy and on the Irish people in general for their &#145;lack of moral fibre&#146;, thus further isolating himself. Despite these problems, the Irish Agricultural Organization Society, which he founded in 1894, introduced into Irish agriculture new technical and business methods and created many local co-operative societies which themselves added a significant institutional component to the fabric of a relatively impoverished rural environment.<br>
<br>While Plunkett tended to disparage politics, it was a necessary means for the achievement of his ideals. He sought to find a middle ground upon which he could build his agricultural work, but showed a singular lack of political skill in negotiating a position for himself. He made that task the more difficult by standing, successfully, as the Unionist candidate for the South County Dublin constituency in 1892. He thus acquired the parliamentary position he wanted for the advocacy of his ideas, but at the cost of confirming the distrust of nationalist politicians, among whose supporters he had principally to work in order to achieve his goals. He was able, however, in parliament and through his good relations with the Unionist chief secretaries for Ireland, Arthur and Gerald Balfour, to advance his cause in significant ways, especially in the creation in 1899 of an Irish department of agriculture and technical instruction, with himself as its first vice-president. His work in the interests of a predominantly Catholic and nationalist population inevitably involved him in considerable conflict with Irish Unionists, in whose cause he had been elected, and in 1900 the opposition of a rival Unionist lost him his seat. He had thus managed in a short parliamentary career to earn the enmity of very large and influential sections of both major communities in Ireland. He had also left himself extremely vulnerable in his role as agricultural reformer. The vice-presidency of the new department had been specifically linked to membership of parliament and junior office in the government, and although he was left in the position by the Unionists, and even for a short time by the Liberals, this was clearly anomalous, fiercely resented by the nationalist party, and eventually brought to an end by his resignation in 1907.<br>
<br>Plunkett's achievements in Irish public life were dogged by an ambivalent attitude to nationalism. Sympathetic in private, he seemed to believe that opposition to nationalism publicly and retention of his formal unionism secured for him a detachment helpful in his work, but in reality it greatly diminished his influence and made him subject to suspicion on both sides. In part this was the product of a real dilemma. Deeply hostile to the hold of the post-Parnell parliamentary nationalist movement on the political structures of Ireland, he discerned in its organization an underlying sectarianism and an abuse of patronage that he considered profoundly anti-national; there was thus good reason for his aloofness from it. Significantly it was in Sinn F&eacute;in, and especially in the ideas of Arthur Griffith, that Plunkett found a nationalism with which he was much more able to identify, especially in the common attachment to ideas of self-reliance and moral regeneration. His diverse public activities demonstrated a major commitment to Irish nationality, even if not to the specific forms taken by nationalism. He had been instrumental in the creation in 1895 of the Recess Committee, a multi-party forum for the consideration of issues of importance to Ireland; the creation of the department of agriculture grew out of its initiatives. The representative Council of Agriculture, which advised this department, he sometimes characterized as an Irish parliament in embryo, and he became increasingly inclined to define Ireland's interests in terms of a distinctive nationality. By the time he was appointed to chair the Irish Convention of 1917&#150;18, his nationalism had become overt and his primary, but by then futile, hope was to avoid partition. In 1919 he founded the Irish Dominion League, in a further attempt to stop partition. He was a member of the Congested Districts board from its inception in 1891 until 1918, a role that complemented his other agricultural and industrial interests. In 1922 he became a senator of the Irish Free State, and thus a target of its republican opponents during the civil war; his house, Kilteragh, at Foxrock in co. Dublin, was burnt down in 1923. This, and failing health, caused him to move to England, where he lived until his death.<br>
<br>While deeply committed to the interests of Ireland, Plunkett's vision extended well beyond its boundaries. His views on agricultural co-operation greatly influenced the development of the co-operative movement throughout the world, and the Plunkett Foundation for Co-operative Studies, which he endowed, and Plunkett House, now the headquarters of the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, remain as living tributes to his work. His breadth of vision was also a product of the multi-national influences upon him; to his natural affinity with both Ireland and England was added his extensive experience of life and work in America. This, linked to the theories and policies he promulgated, made him a much respected adviser of agricultural leaders and governments in the United States, and he enjoyed an especially close relationship with President Theodore Roosevelt. His American associations also enabled him to play a role in relations between the British and United States governments during the First World War.<br>
<br>Plunkett was sworn of the Irish privy council in 1897, knighted in 1903, and elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1902 and of the Royal Irish Academy in 1929. He received honorary degrees of the universities of Oxford (1906) and Dublin (1908), and was elected an honorary fellow of University College, Oxford, in 1909. He was by nature an innovator&#151;his motor car was the first ever brought into Ireland and in his seventies he learned to fly. He never married, apparently not through lack of inclination, as he often wrote of his wish for wife and children. He played an important part in the lives of the children of his close relatives, especially those of whom he was guardian. The closest relationship in his life was that with Elizabeth, countess of Fingall, the wife of his cousin the earl of Fingall. Loyalty to his cousin appears to have set very strong limits to that association, but its emotional and personal importance may have made impossible for Plunkett marriage with anyone else. Plunkett's final years were greatly affected by ill health, in part the consequence of bungled X-ray treatment in 1916. He died at his home, the Crest House, St George's Hill, Weybridge, on 26 March 1932, aged seventy-seven, and was buried in St Mary's churchyard, Byfleet.<br>
