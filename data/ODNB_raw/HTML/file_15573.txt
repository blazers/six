<span class="headword">King,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1679), <span class="occ">covenanter field preacher and martyr</span>, of whose early life nothing is known, first appears among that group of ministers who refused to acquiesce in the re-establishment of the prelacy in the Scottish church after 1662. Unable to secure the tenure of a parish, he was protected from the authorities by his patron Henry Erskine, third Lord Cardross, whom he served as chaplain. He married, and had at least one child.<br>
<br>King's wider preaching commitments to the lowland congregations driven out of doors by the legislation of 1661&#150;2 did not go unnoticed by central government. In 1674 he was arrested for leading the worship at local conventicles and was brought before the Scottish privy council. Lord Cardross was fined heavily for allowing him to minister to his family, while King was released from custody pending further questioning only upon the payment of a bond of 5000 merks. However, King continued his activities and ignored all subsequent summonses to the courts in Edinburgh. In May 1675 a party of soldiers commanded by Sir Mungo Murray took the law into their own hands and raided Cardross's home during his absence. Under the cover of darkness they dragged King's pregnant wife from her bed, rifled through his personal papers, and placed King under close arrest. Before they could spirit their prisoner away, a mob of &#145;country people who had profited by Mr. King's ministry assembled together&#146; on the road out of Cardross, surrounded the soldiers, and prised the minister away from their grasp  (Crookshank, 1.373).<br>
<br>On 12 June 1675 Charles II ordered an investigation into the circumstances of King's escape and on 6 August King was pronounced an outlaw by the Scottish privy council. Over the next four years he criss-crossed the lowland shires, preaching to congregations in the fields and to individuals in their private houses. He was reported as active in Fife, Perth, Stirling, and in the city of Glasgow, in summer 1677, solemnizing weddings and baptisms and preaching before crowds which included many affluent tradesmen. His luck ran out on 31 May 1679, when he and fourteen companions were taken on the road from Falkirk to Rutherglen by government troops commanded by John Graham of Claverhouse. However, the tables were turned the next day at Drumclog when Claverhouse encountered unexpected resistance from those attending a great conventicle, strengthened by several of King's friends who had eluded capture. The covenanter host surged forward, scattering the government troopers and liberating the prisoners, and as Claverhouse rode headlong in flight past King, the preacher called after his persecutor, inviting him to stay behind and benefit from hearing the sermon which he would now be able to preach in the afternoon.<br>
<br>The victory at Drumclog bought King three more precious weeks of freedom, which he spent with the rebel army. Although he afterwards denied that he had been present at the covenanters' abortive assault upon Glasgow and had worn a sword only in order &#145;to disguise himself from being took for a preacher&#146;, it seems likely that he was influential in the army's councils and fought at the battle of Bothwell Bridge on 22 June 1679  (Crookshank, 2.58). Following the rout of the covenanter forces he fled to Dalry parish, seeking sanctuary with the laird of Blair. However, he was surprised <i>en route</i> by a party of Chrichton's dragoons, captured, and promptly escorted to Edinburgh, where the accidental death of one of his guards, who had boasted that he was carrying &#145;King to Hell&#146;, was attributed by successive generations of presbyterian hagiographers to an act of divine providence.<br>
<br>Faced with the prospect of torture, King confessed that he had been in arms with the rebels, and on 22 July was indicted for high treason. At his trial on 28 July he argued that he had been forced against his will to join the rebel host after the battle of Drumclog, but in view of his earlier confession this counted for little with the judge and verdicts of guilty were duly brought in against him and his co-accused, John Kid. Well-meaning attempts by a fellow prisoner at the Edinburgh Tolbooth, Robert Fleming, to persuade King and Kid to accept the duke of Lauderdale's new offer of indulgences and thereby save their lives, were briskly rejected. The two ministers went to the scaffold together at the Mercat Cross on 14 August 1679, and in his final speech King launched a fresh attack upon the errors of popery, episcopacy, and Erastianism, before taking leave of his &#145;poor wife and child&#146;  (Tutchin, 178&#150;82) and looking forward to an &#145;everlasting life [and] glory&#146;  (Crookshank, 2.64&#150;5). After his body was cut down from the gibbet, it was dismembered on an adjacent scaffold in full view of the crowd. His head and right hand were subsequently displayed on the Netherbow gate of Edinburgh, while his corpse was thrown into an unmarked grave within the precincts of Greyfriars churchyard. Although he was undoubtedly an accomplished preacher, only one of King's sermons&#151;delivered at Kilmarnock on 22 August 1678&#151;survives (collected by John Howie). In it King laments the sorrows heaped upon the Scottish nation by the &#145;dreadful formality of many&#146; in their daily religious practices and by the &#145;breach and violation of the covenants&#146; by people from all social ranks. He chooses, however, to return to his biblical text in order to appeal to God to &#145;remember mercy&#146; even in the midst of his wrath, and to deliver his chosen people from the clutches of their enemies  (Howie, <span class="italic">Faithful Contendings</span>, 30&#150;44).<br>
