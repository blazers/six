<span class="headword">Schl&uuml;ter,  Auguste</span>  (1849&#150;1917), <span class="occ">domestic servant</span>, was born on 27 June 1849, probably in Hanover, of which state she was a native. At the age of seventeen and speaking very little English she arrived in England, where she joined the household of William and Catherine Gladstone as lady's maid to the unmarried daughters of the family, Mary and Helen. Schl&uuml;ter kept a diary for many of the years she spent in service to the Gladstones; it was published in 1922. Apparently written in an old exercise book discovered after she left England, it reads in part like a conventional diary, in part as excerpts from letters: &#145;Here I am, dearest&#146;, she wrote on 10 October 1878. &#145;You will be surprised to find me at the seaside&#146;  (Schl&uuml;ter, 31). The diary provides a fascinating account of the life of a lady's maid in an upper-class household in the last quarter of the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Gladstone's first three ministries, and politics in general, made almost no impact in Schl&uuml;ter's diary&#151;its editor observed unkindly that, &#145;supremely unconscious of the historic background, she watched the great events of her time like a cow gazing at a passing train&#146;  (Schl&uuml;ter, 7). For her, it was enough that &#145;our Gentleman&#146; (as she invariably called Gladstone) was in charge. She was not, however, entirely divorced from the political functions of the household, as in June 1882 she noted that she sometimes did a little writing for &#145;the gentlemen secretaries when they have to deal with German letters&#146;  (ibid., 82).<br>
<br>In an age when young women were closely chaperoned, lady's maids had considerable opportunities to witness, and mimic, the social round of the upper classes. Schl&uuml;ter accompanied Mary Gladstone to concerts and plays, on country house visits, and on trips abroad (notably to Darmstadt in 1878, when she took the chance to visit her mother in Hanover). Like her employers, the lady's maid had social circles both in London and at Hawarden, to whom she paid regular calls and with whom she corresponded. It is reported that when Mary Gladstone Drew read her erstwhile maid's diary, she commented with amused condescension on &#145;the way she gives us all back seats while she occupies the front seat!&#146;  (Gladstone, 102).<br>
<br>Schl&uuml;ter's world, although troubled by homesickness, concern for her mother in Germany and sister in New York, and occasional poor health and melancholy, seems from her diary to have been a comfortable one, illuminated by her devotion to her employers. It therefore came as a considerable and unpleasant shock to her when her &#145;beloved Lady&#146;, Mary Gladstone, her last remaining charge, announced her marriage to Harry Drew in December 1885. &#145;When I saw Mr Drew&#146;, she wrote, &#145;I felt like a tigress wishing to throw herself on the enemy&#146;  (Schl&uuml;ter, 135). But she was soon reconciled, especially as Catherine Gladstone took her on as her personal maid. By March 1890 Schl&uuml;ter recognized that her usefulness to the Gladstones was receding, while her own mother was in financial difficulties and needed her at home. In November 1890 she left England with some cash supplied by Mary Drew and a letter of recommendation from Mr Gladstone, which she carefully copied into her journal, &#145;for perhaps I might sell it some day when I am in need&#146;  (ibid., 177). She remained in touch with the Gladstones for the rest of her life and visited them occasionally. The First World War did not end their correspondence, but she died in Hanover in the autumn of 1917; her last letter to Mary Drew, dated 20 March 1917, did not reach England until after the armistice.<br>
