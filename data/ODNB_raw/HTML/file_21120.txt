<span class="headword">Paget,  Henry</span>, first earl of Uxbridge  (<em>c.</em>1663&#150;1743), <span class="occ">politician and official in the royal household</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21124/', "William Paget, seventh Baron Paget (1637&#150;1713)")</script>, and his wife, Frances, the daughter of the Hon. Francis Pierrepont. He was admitted to the Middle Temple in 1683 and was married on 2 January 1686 to Mary (<i>d</i>. 1734), the eldest daughter of Thomas Catesby of Whiston, Yorkshire; the couple had two sons. Paget served as MP for Staffordshire from 1695 to January 1712, taking an active part in parliamentary affairs. Although from a Presbyterian, whig background, Paget was at first considered to be a member of the &#145;country&#146; party, and then a moderate tory and supporter of Robert Harley (later earl of Oxford). From the start of his parliamentary career he was involved in the preparation and management of legislation. In 1699 his interest in the house was described as &#145;considerable&#146;. In 1701 he was appointed to several committees, including the one formed to draw up the impeachments of four whig lords, and he was involved with the <span class="roman">Militia Bill</span> of the following year. In April 1704, when Prince George of Denmark became lord high admiral, Paget was appointed one of his council, a post he held until 1708. He voted against the tories in 1704 when they attempted to tack the <span class="roman">Occasional Conformity Bill</span> on to the <span class="roman">Land Tax Bill</span>, supported the court on the <span class="roman">Regency Bill</span> in 1706, and voted against the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell in 1710. From 10 August 1710 to 30 May 1711 he was a lord of the Treasury in Harley's administration, then, from June 1713 to September 1715, captain of the yeomen of the guard. On 14 June 1711 he became a member of the privy council.<br>
<br>Paget was created Baron Burton of Burton, Staffordshire, on 1 January 1712, being one of twelve peers created to obtain a tory majority in the Lords for Oxford's ministry. Towards the end of Anne's reign he opposed the government on a number of issues, but did not lose his household offices. He succeeded his father as eighth Baron Paget on 26 February 1713, and was lord lieutenant of Staffordshire from March 1713 until 30 September 1715. On 13 April 1714 he was appointed envoy-extraordinary to Hanover. He was created earl of Uxbridge on 19 October of that year and made a privy councillor on 16 November.<br>
<br>In September 1715 Uxbridge resigned all his court employments and acted as part of the tory opposition in the Lords. As one of Oxford's &#145;dozen&#146; he voted for the latter's acquittal in 1717. He became recorder of Litchfield in 1715, a post he kept until his death. His second marriage, on 7 June 1739, was to Elizabeth (1674&#150;1749), the daughter of Sir Walter Bagot of Blithefield, Staffordshire. He died on 30 August 1743 at West Drayton, Middlesex, and was buried in Hillingdon church.<br>
<br>His second son, but the only one to survive to adulthood, <a name="cosubject_21120"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Catesby Paget</span>, Lord Paget  (1689&#150;1742), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was educated at Trinity College, Oxford. He was one of the gentlemen of the bedchamber to the prince of Wales. On the latter's accession as George II he continued in the same post, which he held until 1736, when ill health forced him to resign. He was elected MP for Staffordshire on 3 February 1715 and on 22 March 1722. He also stood for Middlesex in 1727, but was defeated. He generally voted with the opposition. He married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1736), the second daughter of John Egerton, third earl of Bridgewater, on 6 May 1718 at Gray's Inn Chapel; they had two sons, Henry and George (1721&#150;1737). Paget was a writer of minor repute, and his work, which was mildly praised by Horace Walpole, was collected as <span class="italic">Miscellanies in Prose and Verse</span> (1741). He died at West Drayton on 4 February 1742, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.<br>
<br>He was survived by his son <a name="cosubject_21111"></a><span class="headword">Henry Paget</span>, second earl of Uxbridge  (<em>bap. </em>1719, <em>d.</em> 1769), <span class="occ">miser</span>, who was baptized at Isleworth, Middlesex, on 22 January 1719. Following his education at St John's College, Oxford, he succeeded his grandfather in 1743 as earl of Uxbridge. He was chiefly remarkable for an inordinate love of money. Peter Walter, the well-known usurer, who had been the first earl's steward, bequeathed to him in 1746 the principal part of his immense wealth. Uxbridge is said, however, to have continued to pay Walter's daughter, Mrs Bullock, a sizeable annuity during her life, although her father's will did not require it. He died, unmarried, on 16 November 1769, and on this date the earldom became extinct. The barony of Paget passed to Henry Bayly, the great-great-grandson of William, sixth Baron Paget, and father of Henry William Paget, first marquess of Anglesey.<br>
