<span class="headword">O'Connell,  John</span>  (1810&#150;1858), <span class="occ">politician</span>, third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20501/', "Daniel O'Connell (1775&#150;1847)")</script> and his wife, Mary (1778&#150;1836), was born in Dublin on 24 December 1810. His elder brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20505/', "Morgan O'Connell")</script>. He attended Clongowes Wood College, Trinity College, Dublin, and the King's Inns. Called to the bar in 1837, he had little opportunity to practise. Of Daniel O'Connell's sons he was the one most interested in politics, in which he was already active at the age of thirteen. He was returned to parliament for Youghal on 15 December 1832, as a supporter of his father's campaign for repeal of the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span>. In 1835 he was re-elected, in spite of an unsuccessful petition against his return, and he went on to hold the seat until 1837. He was returned unopposed for Athlone on 4 August 1837; on 3 July 1841 he succeeded Joseph Hume in the representation of Kilkenny without a contest, and in August 1847 he was returned both for Kilkenny and for Limerick, and elected to sit for the latter constituency. On 28 March 1838 he had married Elizabeth, daughter of Dr James Ryan of Bray, co. Wicklow. They had eight children.<br>
<br>During the early part of his career O'Connell took a very active part as his father's lieutenant in the repeal agitation. He prepared reports for the repeal association: &#145;Poor-Law Remedies&#146; and &#145;Commercial Injustices to Ireland&#146;, both in 1843, and &#145;Fiscal Relations of the United Kingdom and Ireland&#146; in 1844; also in the same year his <span class="italic">An Argument for Ireland</span> was separately published; it reached a second edition in 1847. He also wrote for <span class="italic">The Nation</span> his <span class="italic">Repeal Dictionary</span>, which was separately published in 1845. He was tried alongside his father in 1844, and shared his imprisonment in Richmond gaol, where he organized private theatricals and conducted a weekly paper for his fellow prisoners. He rode in his father's triumphal car when the prisoners were released on the success of their appeal to the House of Lords. During his father's frequent absences he was the effective head of the repeal association in Ireland. In this capacity he strenuously opposed the Young Ireland party, and incurred its bitter enmity. To the succession to his father's &#145;uncrowned kingship&#146; he asserted almost dynastic claims. The Young Ireland party, willing to defer to the age and genius of the father, revolted against such pretensions on the part of his youthful and less able son. A bitter struggle ensued, but on his father's final departure from Ireland, O'Connell succeeded to the control, and, on the father's death in May 1847, to the titular leadership, of the association. The election of thirty-five MPs in August 1847 was a considerable achievement for the repealers. But the government's dismissal of repeal in April 1848 and the spread of revolution in Europe swung political opinion in Ireland away from O'Connell and towards the Young Irelanders. In 1849, with the revolutionary excitement over, O'Connell endeavoured to revive the repeal association, but in vain. With the Irish Catholic whigs taking up popular causes, he found himself on the opposite side, supporting the government.<br>
<br>When a tenant-right agitation began to gain ground in 1850 O'Connell used his influence against it; and he gave great offence during the excitement produced by the <span class="roman">Ecclesiastical Titles Bill</span> by voting with the government on the motion which led to the temporary fall of Russell's ministry in February 1851. The corporation of Limerick passed a resolution of censure on their member, and in August 1851 he accepted the Chiltern Hundreds to create a vacancy for the earl of Arundel, who in consequence of the secession of his father, the duke of Norfolk, from the Roman Catholic faith had resigned the family borough of Arundel on 16 July. On 21 December 1853 O'Connell re-entered parliament as member for Clonmel; but his position in the House of Commons was now one of insignificance. In February 1857 he quitted public life, on appointment to the clerkship of the Crown and Hanaper Office, Ireland; and on 24 May 1858 he died suddenly at his house in Tivoli Terrace, Gowran Hill, Kingstown, near Dublin, where he had lived for some years. He was buried in Glasnevin cemetery on 28 May, following a funeral that was reputedly the largest in Dublin since that of his father. Following his death a public testimonial raised &pound;5000 in support of his family.<br>
<br>O'Connell published a <span class="italic">Life and Speeches</span> of his father (1846; 2nd edn, 1854) and <span class="italic">Recollections and Experiences</span> of his own parliamentary career (1846). Before and after his death O'Connell provided Young Irelanders and other opponents of his father with an easy target for criticism and even ridicule, and his reputation has suffered accordingly. Attempting as he was to follow in the footsteps of a giant, his chances of making a favourable impact on the world were limited.<br>
