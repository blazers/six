<span class="headword">Byerley,  Robert</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1660, <em>d.</em> 1714), <span class="occ">racehorse owner, army officer, and politician</span>, was baptized on 27 March 1660, the fourth (but second surviving) son of Anthony Byerley (<i>bap</i>. 1619, <i>d</i>. 1667), landowner, of Middridge Grange, Heighington, co. Durham, and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. in or after 1690), daughter and coheir of Sir Richard Hutton (<i>d</i>. 1639), justice of the common pleas, of Goldsborough, near Knaresborough, Yorkshire. The Byerley family had been established as landowners in co. Durham and the North Riding of Yorkshire for several generations. During the Civil War, Anthony Byerley had been the colonel of a royalist cavalry regiment known as &#145;Byerley's Bulldogs&#146;  (Surtees, 312), and at the Restoration he was nominated to the proposed Order of the Royal Oak. Robert Byerley inherited Middridge Grange on the death of his elder brother, also Anthony, in 1674; he also enjoyed Goldsborough Hall, inherited by his mother.<br>
<br>Byerley matriculated at Queen's College, Oxford, on 2 March 1677, but did not take a degree. According to <span class="italic">Thoroughbred Racing Stock and its Ancestors</span>, by Lady Wentworth, he served with the Austrian army at the siege of Vienna in 1683, where he captured a fine charger from the Turkish forces. This horse is allegedly the same as &#145;the Byerley Turk&#146;, one of the foundation sires of the thoroughbred horse. Lady Wentworth described her source only as &#145;a careful Austrian authority&#146;  (Wentworth, 173). The Swedish equine-breeding historian C. G. Wrangel stated that &#145;three Turkish stallions were captured at the siege of Vienna, among those the Byerly Turk&#146;  (Wrangel, 34). (Although the horse's name is entered in the general stud book as &#145;Byerly&#146; he is generally known under the spelling of his owner's name, Byerley.) Of these three horses John Evelyn noted in his diary on 17 December 1684 that:<blockquote>They trotted like Does, as if they did not feele the Ground; for this first Creature was demanded 500 Ginnies, for the 2nd 300, which was of a brighter bay, for the 3d 200 pound, which was browne, all of them choicely shaped but [the last two] not altogether so perfect as the first. In a word it was judg'd by the Spectators (among whom was the King, Prince of Denmark, the Duke of Yorke and severall of the Court Noble persons skilled in Horses, especialy Monsieur Faubert &amp; his sonn &amp; Prevost, Masters of the Accademie and esteemed of the best in Europe), that there were never seene any horses in these parts, to be compared with them. (Evelyn, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 4.399)</blockquote>Although it remains uncertain that the Byerley Turk was one of these three (the &#145;browne&#146;), Evelyn's description conveys the interest and status fine horses held (and still hold) among royalty and the nobility in Europe. In late seventeenth-century aristocratic and army society horseracing&#151;a favourite pastime of Charles II&#151;was a keen sport, and there was a demand for sires with speed, stamina, and courage. The Byerley Turk was one of three foundation sires (the other two being the Darley Arabian and the Godolphin Arabian) from whom all subsequent thoroughbred progeny descend. The ancestry of all modern thoroughbreds can be traced back to one of those three stallions whose qualities much improved the racing capacity of their descendant bloodstock. It remains possible, however, that Byerley purchased the horse after it had been imported to Britain, or that it was actually bred in Yorkshire or co. Durham, perhaps sired by a stallion imported by Oliver Cromwell known as Place's White Turk, who stood at stud at Dinsdale, co. Durham.<br>
<br>Byerley was elected unopposed to the House of Commons as member for co. Durham in March 1685. That year he became a guardian of his thirteen-year-old cousin Mary Wharton (1671/2&#150;1727), daughter and heir of Philip Wharton, of Edlington, Yorkshire; her mother was Byerley's mother's sister. In June that year Byerley raised an independent troop of horse at Doncaster to defend the throne of James II against the rising of James Scott, duke of Monmouth. He was commissioned captain on 19 June 1685, fought at Sedgemoor on 6 July 1685, and was involved in the capture of Monmouth after the battle. At the end of the month Byerley's troop was incorporated into the new 9th regiment of horse, the queen dowager's, and Byerley received a regular commission. This was continued when the regiment was redesignated as the 6th dragoon guards in 1686.<br>
<br>Byerley's royalist background cast him as a tory, but he was listed among the opposition and was among the members &#145;closeted&#146; by James II in an effort to convince them to vote in favour of repealing the <span class="roman">Test Act</span> and penal laws. He refused and was removed from the commission of the peace in Durham as a result. He was re-elected to the Commons for co. Durham in December 1688 and again in the election to the convention in January 1689. That year he was promoted lieutenant-colonel of the 6th dragoon guards on the recommendation of the duke of Schomberg, and became colonel on 30 December 1689 following the death of Viscount Hewett.<br>
<br>Byerley commanded his regiment in William III's 1690 campaign in Ireland. At the spring 1690 race meeting at Down Royal, then at Downpatrick, co. Down, the prize of a silver bell was awarded following a race won by &#145;Captain Byerley's charger&#146;  (Down Royal racecourse website). This horse was probably the Byerley Turk. According to horseracing tradition, when reconnoitring the countryside before the battle of the Boyne on 1 July 1690, Byerley and his company were discovered by a troop of James II's cavalry, but the speed of his mount helped him elude capture.<br>
<br>In November 1690 Byerley's ward, Mary Wharton, was kidnapped when travelling with Byerley's mother by Captain James Campbell, younger brother of Archibald Campbell, tenth earl of Argyll. Campbell forced her into marriage, apparently to acquire her inheritance. Mary was set free within two days, but in August 1691 she gave birth to a son, named Thomas Wharton, son of James Campbell. Her marriage to Campbell was annulled by act of parliament in December 1691. Byerley married Mary Wharton on 17 March 1692; they had five children.<br>
<br>Byerley had resigned his commission on 31 January 1692, citing ill health, bringing his horse home with him. Byerley's politics remained tory and he returned to the Commons, moving to represent Knaresborough from 1695. Although never a Jacobite, he was reluctant to accede to the association affirming William III's right to the throne, and although he eventually took the oath in May 1696, he was removed from the commission of the peace for Yorkshire. He became increasingly active in the Commons, perhaps motivated by an ongoing dispute over the accounts of his former regiment. Both the regiment and Byerley claimed that each owed the other substantial sums, and the matter was disputed before the commissioners for accounts in 1696&#150;7. From at least the 1699&#150;1700 session he established a reputation as a vocal critic of the alleged financial abuses of the whig ministry. He was a leading member of the select committee on the impeachment of the junto lords in 1699. In May 1701 the whig MP Sir Richard Cocks described Byerley as &#145;the most party and ill-natured man in the House&#146;  (Cruickshanks and Harrison). In 1702 he was elected on the tory list to the commission of accounts. He was identified by Sir William Trumbull as one of the &#145;secret committee&#146; of leading tories in the 1703&#150;4 session, and the next year supported Nottingham's investigation of the supposed Jacobite conspiracy, the &#145;Scotch plot&#146;. Whig pressure, citing the unresolved questions about his management of his regimental accounts in 1690, removed him from the commission of accounts in 1704. On 22 February 1705 the Commons finally cleared Byerley of financial impropriety, following his exoneration by the commission for military debts. Perhaps in consequence of this he was less active in parliament between 1705 and 1710. He regained some prominence during Robert Harley's tory-dominated administration, becoming a member of the extreme tory society, the October Club, in 1711, and was appointed a commissioner of the privy seal in January 1712. He died on 1 May 1714, at Goldsborough Hall, and was buried in the chancel at St Mary the Virgin, Goldsborough, on 3 May. He was survived by his wife, who died on 26 February 1727, and their children.<br>
<br>None of Byerley's children left descendants, in contrast to the extensive progeny of his horse. Byerley does not seem to have bred racehorses himself, but he either hired out the stallion as a stud or leased it to another for breeding purposes. Although the Byerley Turk does not seem to have been systematically paired with mares from good breeding stock, the horse sired several top racers and brood mares before its unrecorded death, probably in the first decade of the century. His sons included Basto, Black Hearty, Grasshopper, and Jigg. Basto is known to have been owned by the second duke of Devonshire; Black Hearty by the second duke of Rutland; Grasshopper by Rutland, and then by Sir Roger Mostyn; and Jigg by Mostyn. Under these aristocratic owners, the first three were celebrated for their performances on the turf; the fourth stood as a stallion and was the great-grandsire of King Herod, bred by Prince William Augustus, duke of Cumberland, about 1758. King Herod established the sire line responsible for making the Byerley Turk the head of one of the three male lines from which all thoroughbred horses descend. The Byerley Turk's descendants had already proved they and other Arabians could dominate the match races, run between two horses over several miles, popular in the early part of the century. The stamina displayed by the Arabians contributed towards the rise of the more intensely competitive shorter races between several three- or four-year-old horses which were established in the later eighteenth century. King Herod's grandson Diomed was the first winner of the Derby in 1780. Diomed was exported to the United States in 1798 and became the ancestor of the principal Byerley Turk line in that country; a Byerley Turk line was also established in France.<br>
<br>In the celebrated portrait by John Wootton (private collection) the Byerley Turk is held by a groom in oriental dress; the inclusion of a lean greyhound in the foreground provides an animate symbol of the stallion's conformation and speed. Robert Byerley was an energetic middle-ranking politician and army officer of some ability; but it was the qualities of the horse, as transmitted to its descendants, that preserved his name for posterity.<br>
