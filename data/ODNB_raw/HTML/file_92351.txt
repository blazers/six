<span class="headword">Campbell <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Bellenden]</span>,  Mary, of Mamore</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1685, <em>d.</em> 1736), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was baptized in Edinburgh on 4 May 1685, the third daughter of John Bellenden (formerly Ker), second Lord Bellenden (<i>c</i>.1660&#150;1706), and Mary, dowager countess of Dalhousie (<i>c</i>.1669&#150;1726), second daughter of Henry Moore, first earl of Drogheda. Although her parents suffered financial difficulties at the start of her life, Mary Bellenden was able to move within high aristocratic circles and win the favour of Mary Ker, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Finch, duchess of Roxburghe, the wife of Mary's cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15450/', "John Ker, first duke of Roxburghe")</script>. The duchess recommended Mary Bellenden to Caroline, princess of Wales, as a potential maid of honour, and Mary took up this position at court in 1715.<br>
<br>She was famed for both her beauty and her high spirits; Horace Walpole recalled Bellenden's charms: &#145;so agreeable and engaging she was that I never heard her mentioned afterwards by one of her contemporaries who did not prefer her as the most perfect creature they ever knew&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>, 60). During her time in court she became close friends with the poets John Gay and Alexander Pope, and she featured in a number of their works including Gay's &#145;Damon and Cupid&#146; and &#145;Mr Pope's Welcome from Greece&#146;, and Pope's &#145;The Court Ballad&#146;. These poems, along with Lady Mary Wortley Montagu's &#145;Monday or Roxana&#146;, described the lively nature of the court of the prince and princess of Wales, which was in stark contrast to the dullness and stiffness of the court of George I, the prince's father. In this environment Bellenden, whom Lord Hervey described as &#145;the most likable woman of her time, made up of every ingredient likely to engage or attach a lover&#146;  (Hervey, 1.40&#150;41), soon found she was the subject of attention from male members of the court. At first the prince of Wales tried to woo her, which she appears to have endured for at least four years. It is unclear whether she was his mistress at any stage; Bellenden did spend time with the prince in the lodgings of the princess's dresser, Henrietta Howard, later countess of Suffolk. However, while most members of the court at the time did not suspect there was an illicit relationship, Lord Hervey clearly believed that she was involved with the prince and suggested that she began to distance herself from him when she realized that she faced &#145;only having the scandal of being the Prince's mistress without the pleasure&#146;  (ibid.). Instead she married another member of the court, Colonel John Campbell of Mamore (<i>c</i>.1693&#150;1770), later fourth duke of Argyll, whom she is reported to have secretly loved for some time. Although she promised the prince of Wales that she would gain his permission before she married, in exchange for his protection for her husband, the couple married in secret in 1720.<br>
<br>John Campbell was able to continue as groom of the bedchamber to the prince, but Mary Campbell vacated her position on 22 October 1720. The couple left London, and moved into Combe Bank, Kent. Although she bemoaned court life in conversation with Alexander Pope, it is clear that Campbell missed her role after she was married, writing to Mrs Howard in 1721 &#145;I wish we were all in the Swiss Cantons again&#146;  (Quennell, 59), the name given for Howard's rooms in the palace. However, the couple retained some support from the court, especially from Caroline, queen from 1727, who gave them assistance when they faced financial difficulties after John Campbell's father died in 1729, and arranged for Mary Campbell to be appointed as keeper of the palace of Somerset House. The couple enjoyed a happy marriage and although it had been noted that as a young woman she did not care &#145;a straw&#146;  (ibid., 69) about politics, she was supportive of his political career. She wrote of her frustration when he was not given a safe seat in a forthcoming election, but added, &#145;nothing can make me unhappy while John lives and is good to me, which hitherto I have no reason to fear, will ever be otherwise&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 22627, fols. 94&#150;5). She was mother to one daughter, Caroline (1721&#150;1803), who married first Charles Bruce, third earl of Ailesbury, and second <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6122/', "Henry Seymour Conway (1719&#150;1795)")</script>, and five sons, including John Campbell (1723&#150;1806), later the fifth duke of Argyll, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4495/', "Lord Frederick Campbell (1729&#150;1816)")</script>. She died in childbirth on 18 December 1736, and was buried on the 23rd at St Anne's, Soho, London.<br>
