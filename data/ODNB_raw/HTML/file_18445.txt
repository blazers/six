<span class="headword">Mayne, Sir  Richard</span>  (1796&#150;1868), <span class="occ">police officer</span>, fourth son of Edward Mayne, a judge of the court of king's bench in Ireland, was born in Dublin on 27 November 1796. He graduated BA from Trinity College, Dublin, in 1818, proceeding to Trinity College, Cambridge, from where he received his MA in 1821. He was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn on 9 February 1822, and practised on the northern circuit for seven years. In the summer of 1829 Robert Peel, the home secretary, was looking for a barrister to serve as joint commissioner of his planned Metropolitan Police. Prompted by the home secretary's cousin, also a barrister on the northern circuit, Mayne applied for the position. He was offered it without interview and accepted with alacrity. He had fallen in love with Georgina Marianne Catherine, eldest daughter of Thomas Carvick of Wyke, Yorkshire; his salary of &pound;800 as police commissioner enabled him to propose, and the couple were married in 1831. Mayne first met his fellow commissioner, Colonel Charles Rowan, in the home secretary's office on 6 July 1829; twelve weeks later, on 29 September, the first Metropolitan Police constables began patrolling the streets of London.<br>
<br>Rowan and Mayne had the formidable task of recruiting, training, and organizing the new force, whose principal task, according to the instructions written by the commissioners, was &#145;the prevention of crime&#146;. Mayne was the more articulate and imaginative of the two; but he was, as later events were to prove, less skilled at managing men. The commissioners dealt carefully and conscientiously with criticism from parliament, the press, and the public. However, they shared the prejudices of early nineteenth-century Englishmen against spies, and this impeded growth of a detective branch. Mayne's services were rewarded on 29 April 1848 when he was created a CB; on 25 October 1851, at the close of the Great Exhibition, he was promoted to KCB. When Rowan retired on 5 January 1850 Mayne expected to assume sole command of the force, but Captain William Hay was appointed joint commissioner. Hay and Mayne differed seriously over a variety of issues, and the situation was resolved only with Hay's death in August 1855; the following February a short <span class="roman">Police Act</span> was passed establishing one commissioner with two assistants.<br>
<br>Mayne's period as sole commissioner was increasingly unhappy. He grew more and more remote from his men, issuing pettifogging orders and insisting on the enforcement of trivial street regulations. At the same time the police had little success against violent street robbers known as &#145;garotters&#146;. All this prompted a critical press campaign, which worsened following the Hyde Park riot of June 1866 and the failure to act on information which might have prevented the explosion at Clerkenwell prison on 13 December 1867. Mayne offered his resignation on these occasions, but it was refused on the grounds of his long public service. He died while still in office, at his London residence, 80 Chester Square, on 26 December 1868, and was buried four days later in Kensal Green cemetery. Initially tributes were muted, but his widow was granted a civil-list pension of &pound;150 on 21 April 1870, and a monument to Mayne's memory was unveiled in Kensal Green cemetery on 25 January 1871.<br>
<br>Mayne's son, <a name="cosubject_18445"></a><span class="headword">Richard Charles Mayne</span>  (1835&#150;1892), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was educated at Eton College; he joined the navy in 1847. He served in the three naval theatres of the Crimean War (1854&#150;6), in Vancouver Island and British Columbia (1857&#150;61), about which he wrote a memoir, and in New Zealand (1863&#150;4), where he was wounded. Between 1866 and 1869 he commanded the survey expedition to the Strait of Magellan, subsequently publishing sailing instructions for the region. In 1870 he married Sabine, the daughter of Thomas Dent. He retired from the navy on 27 November 1879 with the rank of rear-admiral, and was made a CB; on 26 November 1885 he was gazetted a retired vice-admiral. In 1885 he contested Pembroke and Haverfordwest as a conservative, but was narrowly beaten; the following year, as a Liberal Unionist, he was successful. He died suddenly, at his home, 101 Queen's Gate, London, after attending a banquet at the Mansion House, London, on 29 May 1892.<br>
