<span class="headword">Audley,  Henry</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1246), <span class="occ">baron</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65092/', "Adam de Audley (d. 1203)")</script>, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65091/', "Liulf de Audley")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54496/', "Audley family")</script>]. The Audleys, of Anglo-Saxon ancestry, took their name from their Staffordshire manor of Audley, or Heleigh (Aldithelegh and many variants), granted to Henry's great-grandfather by Nicholas de Verdon in Stephen's reign. Henry's elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65093/', "Adam de Audley")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54496/', "Audley family")</script>], was the constable of Hugh de Lacy, earl of Ulster (<i>d</i>. 1242), and Henry may also have served the earl since both brothers received lands in Ulster. Audley had succeeded both his father and his brother by 1212, and in 1217 he married Bertred, daughter of Ralph Mainwaring, county justice of Chester. During the civil war of 1215&#150;17 he served the powerful royalist Ranulf (III), earl of Chester (<i>d</i>. 1232), who granted him lands in Cheshire and Staffordshire. Between 1217 and 1220 Audley was sheriff of Shropshire and Staffordshire as the earl's deputy. Briefly bailiff of Carmarthen in 1226, he was again sheriff of the two counties between 1227 and 1232 and constable of Shrewsbury and Bridgnorth. Early in 1234 he garrisoned Shrewsbury Castle but failed to prevent the Welsh from burning the town. After the death of John, earl of Chester, Henry was one of the royal keepers of the county palatine and constable of Chester and Beeston.<br>
<br>Between 1217 and 1245 Audley was regularly employed on the Welsh marches, frequently negotiating truces with the Welsh and arbitrating on breaches of the truce and on boundary disputes. In 1245 he took part in the relief of Diserth Castle. On the king's behalf he repaired the castles at Shrawardine (1220) and Mold (1241&#150;2): on his own he strengthened Audley and Hodnet castles and built the new fortress of Redcastle in Shropshire, licensed in 1237. In 1219 he founded and endowed the Cistercian abbey at Hulton, Staffordshire. By gift and purchase he steadily built up his estates, mainly in Shropshire and Staffordshire. He was not a marcher lord, nor, until Henry III granted him the Shropshire manors of Edgmond and Newport in 1227 and Ford in 1230, was he a tenant-in-chief. But such was his activity in the royal service that he won for the Audleys an influence in border affairs out of proportion to their modest estates. Significantly, his daughter Emma married Gruffudd ap Madog, the powerful lord of Bromfield. On his death in the autumn of 1246 Henry Audley was succeeded by his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/894/', "James Audley")</script>.<br>
