<span class="headword">Williams,  Evan James</span>  (1903&#150;1945), <span class="occ">physicist</span>, was born on 8 June 1903 in Cwmsychbant, near Lampeter, Cardiganshire, the youngest of the three sons of James Williams, stonemason, a zealous Congregationalist, and a winner of many prizes for Welsh lyrics at local eisteddfodau, and his wife, Elizabeth Lloyd. Educated at Llanwenog national school and at Llandysul county school, he won a scholarship in 1919 to Swansea Technical College, which became the University College of Swansea in 1920, and where he gained first-class honours (1923) and, in 1924, an MSc degree. Winning a fellowship of the University of Wales in 1925 he went on to work with W. L. Bragg in Manchester, where he was awarded the degree of PhD in 1926. Then, with an 1851 Exhibition scholarship, he went to Cambridge, becoming a PhD there in 1929, and a DSc (Wales) in 1930. After a further spell in Manchester, a year with Niels Bohr in Copenhagen, and another in Liverpool with James Chadwick, he moved in 1938 to the chair of physics at Aberystwyth.<br>
<br>Williams's research was mainly in atomic physics, where his theoretical studies of the impact of elementary particles on atoms were steps towards the discovery of the meson. Equally adept as an experimenter, he built high performance cloud chambers at Liverpool and Aberystwyth, and obtained some of the earliest photographs from which the mass of the meson could be deduced. The brilliance of his contributions was recognized by his early election as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1939.<br>
<br>In 1940 Williams joined the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough to develop new physical methods of detecting submerged U-boats from the air. In March 1941 as principal scientific officer he joined P. M. S. Blackett in the operational research section at Coastal Command, where his task was to improve the methods of finding and sinking U-boats. To attack a U-boat an aircraft had first to sight it on the surface. It was then the practice to drop depth charges with a setting of 100 feet on the assumption that the U-boat would often have had time to submerge. Williams showed that it would be much more lethal to concentrate on attacking U-boats which could still be seen on the surface with a depth charge setting of 25 feet, and ignore those which had time to submerge, because of the uncertainty in knowing their exact position.<br>
<br>In 1941 Williams became director of operational research at Coastal Command. There he was particularly concerned with such questions as the size of convoys, which he successfully made larger, and the concerted offensive against U-boats in the Bay of Biscay on passage to and from their shore bases. Blackett later wrote that probably the anti-submarine campaign in 1943 was waged under closer scientific control than any other campaign in the history of the British armed forces. It gave rise to the term &#145;slide-rule strategy&#146; and Williams was one of its foremost creators.<br>
<br>Ebullient, and with a broad grin, Williams early sensed his own powers&#151;at sixteen he told a friend that he would have a fellowship of the University of Wales, an 1851 Exhibition scholarship, a DSc, and a fellow of the Royal Society by his middle thirties. All these came about, and such was his nature that this seeming conceit offended none. He had a special sympathy for the underdog, and he enjoyed hobnobbing with all and sundry. Of stocky build and great physical strength, and with blue eyes, bushy eyebrows, and dark brown hair, he had a passion for cricket and a lasting propensity for practical jokes, which may well have contributed to his success as a scientific strategist.<br>
<br>In 1944 Williams learned that he had cancer. After a second operation in January 1945 he nevertheless visited Washington in connection with the Far Eastern war and, although dying, he wrote a scientific paper for the sixtieth birthday tribute to Niels Bohr. He died unmarried on 29 September 1945 at his parents' home, Brynawel, Cwmsychbant, near Lampeter, Cardiganshire.<br>
