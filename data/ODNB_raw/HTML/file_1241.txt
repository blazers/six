<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ballingall, Sir  George</span>  (1780&#150;1855), <span class="occ">military surgeon and medical writer</span>, was born on 2 May 1780 at Forglen, Banffshire, the son of the Revd Robert Ballingall, and his wife, a daughter of J. Simson of Edinshead. His education began at the Falkland parish school in Fife. Afterwards he attended the University of St Andrews, in which town he was also apprenticed to a Dr Melville, before moving on in 1803 to the University of Edinburgh, where he became an assistant to the anatomy lecturer John Barclay. Ballingall later compiled Barclay's lectures into a book (<span class="italic">Introductory Lectures to a Course of Anatomy, Delivered by the Late John Barclay</span>, 1827), and in 1813 honoured Barclay with the gift of a preserved skeleton of an elephant which was later displayed in the museum of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh.<br>
<br>In 1806 Ballingall joined the 2nd battalion of the 1st Royals as an assistant surgeon; soon after he departed for India, where he remained until 1814. The duke of Kent was then colonel of the regiment, and he became one of Ballingall's principal patrons. Aside from volunteering to join the expedition to Java in 1811, Ballingall did not see much action in India. However, he had to contend with the high mortality and morbidity rates which beset British regiments there. Conditions in India confirmed his belief that most diseases and illnesses could be avoided or at least ameliorated through preventive measures. India itself was not inherently unhealthy; rather, it was the lifestyles of the European residents that were at fault. In 1815 Ballingall was promoted to full surgeon following his transfer to the 33rd foot, which corps comprised part of the army of occupation in Paris. In 1817, shortly after his return to Edinburgh, he married a daughter of his distant cousin, James Ballingall of Perth. He retired on half pay in 1818.<br>
<br>Ballingall next set up practice in Edinburgh. There he also began to write, beginning with <span class="italic">Practical Observations on Fever, Dysentery and Liver Complaints, as they occur amongst the European Troops in India</span> (1818), followed shortly by <span class="italic">Essay on Syphilis</span> (1820). He was appointed lecturer of military surgery at the University of Edinburgh in 1823, and despite considerable opposition from the medical community at Edinburgh, who wished to dispense with the chair altogether, or at least convert it to a professorship of general surgery (in 1823 Ballingall attracted only four pupils on top of the thirty-three from the services), he was appointed professor of military surgery in 1825. Ballingall quickly proved to be one of the more popular lecturers; in 1839 he had eighty students. This professorship, partly subsidized by the government, was then the only position in Britain which specifically addressed military medicine; a similar chair was established in Dublin in 1846.<br>
<br>Even after his appointment to the University of Edinburgh Ballingall continued to travel extensively on the continent, where he observed developments in military medicine and built up a network of medical and military contacts. Consequently, ideas and practices which were developing in Europe featured in his lectures and writings. His lectures in Edinburgh formed the basis of his two best-known works: <span class="italic">Introductory Lectures to a Course of Military Surgery</span> (1830), and <span class="italic">Outlines of Military Surgery</span> (1833), which became a standard reference and instructional work for military and naval surgeons. He also wrote several pamphlets on military and medical matters, including <span class="italic">Remarks on Schools of Instruction for Military and Naval Surgeons</span> (1843), <span class="italic">On Schools of Naval and Military Surgery</span> (1844), <span class="italic">Extract of a Lecture on Corporal Punishment</span> (1847), and <span class="italic">Observations on the Site and Construction of Hospitals</span> (1851), as well as articles for the medical press, chiefly the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Medical Journal</span>.<br>
<br>Ballingall made no significant advances in medical theory. His early writings on diseases of hot climates were soon eclipsed by others, partly because his belief in the ability of Europeans to acclimatize to Indian conditions was becoming less popular as the century wore on. He was, however, an early critic of the extensive use of mercurials in treating venereal diseases and dysentery, and he made some headway in limiting army surgeons' use of mercury on venereal cases. His real importance lay in his efforts to persuade the army to take preventive medicine more seriously. Despite his title of professor of military surgery, most of his writings and lectures dealt with what he termed military hygiene. He stressed the need for sanitary reforms, and pressed for increased attention to the placing of barracks, diet, discipline (especially corporal punishment), and arrangements for wholesome leisure activities to counteract the &#145;ruinous consequences of excesses amongst the soldiery&#146;  (G. Ballingall, <span class="italic">Outlines of Military Surgery</span>, 1833, 41).<br>
<br>Contemporaries described Ballingall as tall and slender, and quiet and even-tempered. He was elected FRSE in 1820, and in 1830 he was knighted by William IV. Recurring bouts of bronchitis so incapacitated Ballingall in the last years of his life that he was forced to limit his lectures to the summer months. Complications arising from his bronchitis led to his death on 4 December 1855 at his country house of Altamont, Blairgowrie, Perthshire. Two sons and a daughter survived him: William, the eldest son, joined the Indian army; George, the second son, joined the medical service of the East India Company and eventually became professor of surgery at Grant Medical College in Bombay; and his daughter travelled to Bombay, where she married John Stuart.<br>
