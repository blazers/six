<span class="headword">Murray,  Charles</span>  (1864&#150;1941), <span class="occ">poet and civil engineer</span>, was born on 28 September 1864 in the village of Alford, Strathdon, Aberdeenshire, the second of three children of Peter Murray (1833&#150;1926), carpenter and land steward, and his wife, Margaret Robbie (1838&#150;1868). Peter Murray had a passion for reading, a reputation for composing pointed rhymes in the vernacular, and a fine collection of geological specimens; his son&#151;surveyor, civil engineer, and poet&#151;combined his father's artistic and practical interests. Charles Murray completed his elementary education at the local Gallowhill School. Later he looked back with gratitude on his schooldays:<blockquote>I was raised upon Ramsay, Fergusson and Burns, and the old Scots, and all my life as a boy I was taught to look for quaint phrases, out of the way expressions and to study and delight in the original characters of the countryside. (Murray, <span class="italic">Dinner</span>)</blockquote>In his teens he began to write Scots verse. Like Thomas Hardy, the young Murray was in touch with a rich folk music tradition, playing with a &#145;strong bow-han&#146; for dancing in Alford  (Murray, letter to Alexander Mackie). Just after the turn of the century he corresponded with Gavin Greig, supplying information and material for what was to become the great Greig&#150;Duncan folk-song collection.<br>
<br>After being apprenticed at Walker and Beattie, Aberdeen, surveyors and civil engineers, from 1881 to 1887, Murray left for South Africa in 1888, working first in an architecture and engineering practice. In 1895 he married Cape Town-born Edith Emma Rogers (1871&#150;1946). After a period managing goldmines, Murray served in the South African War. Entry to public service followed, and his advancement was rapid: deputy inspector of mines for the Transvaal in 1901, by 1910 he was secretary for public works, Union of South Africa.<br>
<br>Murray's poems began to appear in print only after his departure for South Africa; significantly he first published in W. E. Henley's <span class="italic">Scots Observer</span>, a periodical which reflected the progressive literary tastes, imperialist sympathies, and Scottish cultural interests of its editor and his associates. These included Stevenson and James Logie Robertson (Hugh Haliburton), important figures in the revival of the vernacular poetic tradition. Like Kipling, Henley's most celebrated contributor, the vernacularists reinvigorated a stale poetic diction by drawing on the energies of the colloquial and the demotic. Apart from the twelve copies of <span class="italic">A Handful of Heather</span> printed for friends in 1893, Murray's poems first appeared in book form in the 1900 <span class="italic">Hamewith</span> (Wyllie, Aberdeen). Despite its success, Murray had difficulty finding a larger publisher willing to undertake a revised and enlarged edition. Ironically, the expanded <span class="italic">Hamewith</span> (Constable &amp; Co., Edinburgh and London, 1909) was an immediate success. It consisted of forty-five poems, all but two in a Scots based on the dialect of his native north-east. Murray was convinced that he had exhausted his creative powers, but the First World War provided fresh stimulus, and <span class="italic">A Sough o' War</span> (1917) contains some of his best work. The only other collection published in his lifetime was <span class="italic">In the Country Places</span> (1920). A collected edition, <span class="italic">Hamewith and other Poems</span>, followed in 1927; <span class="italic">Hamewith: the Complete Poems</span> (1979) included the uncollected work published as <span class="italic">Last Poems</span> (1969). Fresh impressions of <span class="italic">Hamewith</span> appeared throughout the 1930s and 1940s. Murray was awarded an honorary LLD by the University of Aberdeen in 1920 for his services to the vernacular.<br>
<br>For young writers between the wars the future seemed to lie with the experimental, the metropolitan, and with a radical new political order of left or right: Murray, a best-seller, an &#145;amateur&#146;, an imperialist, and a north-east Scot, came to symbolize all that was reactionary. The modernism of C. M. Grieve (Hugh MacDiarmid) and his allies now seems more a cul-de-sac than a high road to the future, and in a Europe of the regions, Murray's regional affiliations seem contemporary again&#151;for his poetry communicates above all a vivid sense of the distinctive life and character of north-east Scotland. His work is not merely descriptive, however, and its significance is by no means confined to his native region. Several poems, including &#145;The Whistle&#146;&#151;long his best known&#151;show the impact of the forces of cultural standardization on local speech and traditional ways. Rural life is not depicted nostalgically, however: in &#145;The Antiquary&#146; the past is associated with superstition and cruelty, while in &#145;The Packman&#146; social change is celebrated in the pedlar's rise to prosperity. Despite their patriotic sentiments, several of Murray's war poems convey the traditional peasant sense that war is an irrelevance, while the bleakly poignant &#145;When will the war be by&#146; offers none of the conventional consolations for a girl's loss of her soldier-lover. &#145;Gin i was God&#146; is a powerfully succinct and sardonic expression of post-war disillusionment.<br>
<br>Murray was created CMG in 1922 for services to the Union of South Africa, and retired in 1924. He spent his last years in the north-east at his home, The Lythe, Banchory, Kincardineshire, dying there on 12 April 1941. Three days later his remains were cremated in Aberdeen. He was survived by his wife, son, and two daughters.<br>
<br>Murray's poetry demonstrated that the vernacular was still vigorous, and inspired other writers to explore the literary potentialities of contemporary spoken Scots. The continuing availability of Scots as a medium for serious poetry owes much to Murray's efforts. Despite attacks from the late 1920s onwards by Hugh MacDiarmid and his Scottish Renaissance allies, who identified Murray with the outdated tendencies he had helped to defeat, his work continued to be popular, especially in the north-east, until after the Second World War. Though closely related to the Doric of the north-east, Murray's Scots is an artful literary construct; and, far from being the na&iuml;ve amateur of letters depicted in some literary histories, Murray was a dedicated craftsman who constantly revised and polished his work. His <span class="italic">Complete Poems</span>, edited by Nan Shepherd, appeared in 1979.<br>
