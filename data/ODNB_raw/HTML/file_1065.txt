<span class="headword">Baillie,  Marianne</span>  (1795?&#150;1831), <span class="occ">travel writer and versifier</span>, whose maiden name appears to have been Wathen, married before 1817 Alexander Baillie, who printed privately at Kingsbury her first known work, <span class="italic">Guy of Warwick, a Legende, and other Poems</span> (1817). This collection of undistinguished verse reached a second edition probably through the indulgence of friends. A period of financial difficulty appears to have followed soon after: in 1818 the Baillies went to live at Sion Cottage, Twickenham, possibly the property of Sophia Charlotte, Baroness Howe, whose second husband, Sir Wathen Waller, was probably a distant relative of Marianne Baillie. In the summer of 1818 the Baillies, accompanied by a male friend, set out on a tour through France, Italy, Austria, and Germany which Marianne Baillie described in her first travel book, <span class="italic">First Impressions of a Tour upon the Continent</span> (1819), one of the earliest accounts of the grand tour written by a woman. It was published by John Murray and dedicated to the Honourable John Hampden Trevor, the British diplomatic minister in Turin and, apparently, a family friend. <span class="italic">First Impressions</span> received a favourable, if condescending, review in the <span class="italic">London Literary Gazette</span>, where it was described as &#145;at once useful and agreeable&#146; for travellers  (<span class="italic">London Literary Gazette</span>, 17 July 1819, 453&#150;4). The critic rightly noted Marianne Baillie's &#145;turn for observation&#146;: homely reflections on bed bugs and the inferior quality of French cutlery interrupt the often conventionally picturesque and romantic commentary on scenery and costumes. By January 1821 she had written another work, the subject of which is unknown, but Murray declined to publish it.<br>
<br>In June of that year the Baillies left for Portugal, accompanied by their first child, a son; they remained there until September 1823, living mainly in Lisbon. It appears probable that Trevor had secured a diplomatic appointment for Alexander Baillie. Marianne Baillie's letters to her mother during these years formed the substance for her best work, <span class="italic">Lisbon in the Years 1821, 1822, and 1823</span> (1824), published by Murray. In her letters the trials of the new constitutional government of Portugal and its eventual overthrow by the royalist party contend for space with descriptions of the beauties of rural Cintra, an account of a visit to a local convent, and praise for delicacies such as roasted chestnuts. She found the climate overpowering and the streets of Lisbon disgusting, but, despite constant nostalgic allusions to England, she was open-minded enough to appreciate the superiority of Portuguese courtesy and to be touched by the affectionate ways of her servants. Shortly after the birth of her second child, a daughter, in late 1822, she heard with relief that a post in London had been found for her husband; but she admitted to leaving Portugal &#145;almost with regret&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lisbon</span>, 2.250). Shortly after the publication of <span class="italic">Lisbon</span> a second edition was called for, which surprised even the author; in the same year the work received a favourable notice in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>. Her only other known work&#151;a collection of old and new poems entitled <span class="italic">Trifles in Verse</span>&#151;was printed privately in the same year. The Baillies do not appear to have travelled abroad again; in 1827 they were living in Stanley Cottage on Richmond Hill. By 1830 Marianne Baillie was in poor health, and she died in 1831.<br>
