<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cameron, Sir  John <span class="st"> [Jock]</span></span>, Lord Cameron  (1900&#150;1996), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 8 February 1900 in Edinburgh, the son of John Cameron, solicitor at the Supreme Court, and his wife, Wilhelmina Louise Wilson. Known as Jock, he was educated at Edinburgh Academy from 1911 to 1917; in his final year he was dux (top classical scholar). Notably well read, Cameron won prizes, mainly in classics, and was active in the debating society. The First World War interrupted his passage to university and in 1917, after a brief period as a private in the Edinburgh University officer training corps, he served in the Royal Navy, taking part in a minor Baltic campaign as a probationary midshipman on destroyers.<br>
<br>In 1919 Cameron entered Edinburgh University and obtained an MA degree in classics and history. Subsequently he gained an LLB degree with distinction, and was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in 1924. Specializing in criminal work, he served as advocate-depute, the equivalent in Scotland of a crown prosecutor, from 1929 until 1936, the year in which he became a king's counsel. Cameron showed great skill with civil and criminal juries, and cross-examined witnesses with &#145;deceptive art&#146;, the phrase used by Lord John Wheatley, later lord justice clerk, who was devilling for Cameron at the time. On one occasion in the 1930s, when capital punishment was still common in Scotland, Cameron was defending in a murder trial and asked the key prosecution witness in a kindly tone what happened to people convicted of murder. The witness replied, with the smile of a simpleton, that he thought they would get the tawse&#151;the strap used in Scottish schools. The point was made. The court fell silent. Cameron's client was acquitted.<br>
<br>In 1927 Cameron married Eileen Dorothea (<i>d</i>. 1943), daughter of H. M. Burrell; they had two daughters and a son, Kenneth (later Lord Cameron of Lochbroom, lord advocate in Margaret Thatcher's government from 1984 to 1989, and a judge like his father). In the late 1930s Cameron came increasingly to detest Hitler and fascism. In 1938 he signed up for the Royal Naval Volunteer Supplementary Reserve, in which he served during the Second World War. In 1940 he was in charge of one of the last craft to escape from Dunkirk before the Germans arrived, and manoeuvred his coastal motor boat, which carried a full load of prominent generals, at full speed astern through a narrow channel. He was mentioned in dispatches for this exploit and in 1944, as a lieutenant-commander, was awarded the DSC for his &#145;gallantry, skill, and determination and undaunted devotion to duty&#146; during the allied landings in Normandy.<br>
<br>Cameron's wife died in 1943 while he was at sea, and on 4 November 1944 he married her friend Iris Eunice (<i>b</i>. 1913/14), daughter of Eric Alfred Henry of the India and Burma imperial police, and widow of Lambert C. Shepherd. They enjoyed an exceptionally happy marriage for the remainder of his life.<br>
<br>On demobilization in 1945 Cameron was appointed sheriff of Inverness, Elgin, and Nairn, and from 1946 to 1948 he held the successor sheriffdom of Inverness, Elgin, Moray, Nairn, and Ross and Cromarty. Having been elected by his contemporaries dean of the Faculty of Advocates (leader of the Scottish bar) in 1948, he was knighted in 1954 and in 1955 appointed a senator of the college of justice and a lord of session. He presided over some of the most high-profile trials of the day, including that of Peter Manuel&#151;an armed robber convicted in 1958 of killing seven people&#151;whom he sentenced to death.<br>
<br>Alongside his work on the bench, Cameron was extremely active in public service. On leaving the navy he became chairman of the legal aid committee in Scotland; he was involved in numerous industrial inquiries, including the feasibility of the dock labour scheme in 1948. He chaired a three-man commission into the rioting in Northern Ireland in 1969, which found many of the Catholic grievances justified. His service as chairman of the Highlands and Islands Development Consultative Council was part of a lifelong interest in the north-west of Scotland, where his ancestors originated. In 1978 he was appointed a knight of the Thistle, probably the first serving judge to receive that honour.<br>
<br>The sea remained among Cameron's many interests&#151;he was honorary commodore of the Forth Yacht Club&#151;but he also supported the arts in Scotland, as a member of the Edinburgh festival council, chairman of the Edinburgh Concert Society, and a supporter of Edinburgh music and theatre. He was an amateur artist and a collector of pictures. A large, impressive figure, Cameron was a sociable man with &#145;swept-back hair and a face full of character&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>). He had many friends and a reputation for hospitality and good humour: &#145;He sang songs, enjoyed mimicking his stuffier colleagues, and relished intelligent conversation and the exchange of ideas&#146;  (ibid.). While chairing the committee on the law of contempt, which had been set up in June 1971, Cameron recounted the story of how an egg had been thrown at Vice-Chancellor Mallins. &#145;He is said to have remarked that he presumed it was intended for his brother Bacon, who was sitting in an adjoining court&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>). He died on 30 May 1996 at his home, 28 Moray Place, Edinburgh; he was survived by his second wife.<br>
