<span class="headword">Colquhoun <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Sinclair]</span>,  Janet</span>, Lady Colquhoun  (1781&#150;1846), <span class="occ">religious writer</span>, was the second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25627/', "Sir John Sinclair")</script> of Ulbster, first baronet (1754&#150;1835), and his first wife, Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1785), the only child and heir of Alexander Maitland of Stoke Newington. She was born in London on 17 April 1781, but, together with her elder sister Hannah, passed her childhood at Thurso Castle with their grandmother Lady Janet Sinclair, daughter of William Sutherland, Lord Strathnaver. This lady took the sisters to live in the Canongate of Edinburgh, before they went to complete their education at a school at Stoke Newington. The younger of the two was about fifteen when they returned to be introduced into Edinburgh society.<br>
<br>On 11 June 1799 Janet Sinclair married Major James Colquhoun (1774&#150;1836), eldest son of Sir James Colquhoun of Luss, second baronet, on whose death, in 1805, her husband succeeded to the title, and Rossdhu, on Loch Lomond, became her home. In this year Lady Colquhoun began to keep a diary, which she continued for forty years. She was the mother of five children, three sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5989/', "John Colquhoun")</script>, and two daughters, whom she helped to educate. She visited the poor and sick among her tenants. In 1818 she turned her attention to female education and established a school of industry for girls, near Rossdhu; Lady Colquhoun taught at the Sunday school attached to this institution. She took a keen interest in other philanthropic and religious schemes, especially in the Luss and Arrochar Bible Society.<br>
<br>In 1820 Lady Colquhoun's health declined, and she was prevented from taking any active share in philanthropic schemes. She then devoted herself to the composition of religious works, the first of which was published anonymously in 1822 under the title of <span class="italic">Despair and Hope</span>. This was followed by <span class="italic">Thoughts on the Religious Profession</span> (1823), <span class="italic">Impressions of the Heart</span> (1825), <span class="italic">The Kingdom of God</span> (1836), and <span class="italic">The World's Religion</span> (1839). She allegedly converted her husband to evangelicalism; it was not until after his death, on 3 February 1836, that her name was appended to her books. James Hamilton remarked that her works were: &#145;like the conversation of their compiler, &hellip; genuine and inartificial, spontaneous and heartfelt&#146;. At the time of the Disruption of the established church in 1843, she took great interest in religious politics, throwing herself heart and soul into the Free Church cause. She died at Helensburgh on 21 October 1846, and was buried on the 27th of that month at Luss.<br>
