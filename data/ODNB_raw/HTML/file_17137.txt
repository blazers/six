<span class="headword">Lucas,  Richard Cockle</span>  (1800&#150;1883), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born on 24 October 1800 in Salisbury, Wiltshire, the son of Richard Lucas and his wife, Martha Sutton (<i>d</i>. 1801). At the age of twelve he was apprenticed to an uncle, a cutler at Winchester. Becoming proficient at carving knife-handles, he decided to become a sculptor. In 1828 he entered the Royal Academy Schools, when his age was incorrectly given in the register as twenty-five, and from that year he was a regular contributor to the Royal Academy, receiving a silver medal for an architectural drawing in 1828 and 1829. Over the next thirty years he exhibited over a hundred works at the academy, the British Institution, and the Suffolk Street Gallery of the Society of British Artists, including busts, medallions, and classical subjects, such as those of Dr Johnson at Lichfield, Dr Watts at Southampton, and Richard Colt Hoare at Salisbury Cathedral. His marble, wax, and ivory medallion portraits, many of which were displayed at the Great Exhibition, were more successful, however, and have subsequently been purchased by the Bethnal Green Museum and the National Portrait Gallery, London, which holds his wax medallion of Sir Anthony Panizzi (1850). Two self-portraits, an etching dated on the plate 1858, and a plaster cast of a bust, incised and dated 1868, are also in the National Portrait Gallery collection. Lucas's popular wax relief <span class="italic">Leda and the Swan</span> was subsequently purchased by the Victoria and Albert Museum. Lucas made a study of the Parthenon marbles, of which he made two large wax models, the first showing the Parthenon as it appeared after bombardment by the Venetians in 1687; the second was made according to a plan of reconstruction according to his own theories as to the original arrangement of the sculptures. The latter was the subject of much public interest when exhibited at the British Museum, where it stood in the Elgin room. In 1845 he published his <span class="italic">Remarks on the Parthenon</span>, illustrated with fifteen etchings. A decade later he designed and built himself a house which he called Tower of the Winds at Chilworth, near Romsey, Hampshire, an account of which he entitled &#145;The artist's dream realised, being a residence designed and built by R. C. Lucas, sculptor, 1854; etched and described 1856 with seventeen plates&#146;. Lucas produced many popular etchings depicting his own sculptural works, biblical stories, and scenes from eighteenth-century poetry, including that of Thomas Gray, Oliver Goldsmith, and Robert Burns. A nearly complete series of these, mounted in an album bound by Lucas himself, and including a frontispiece portrait of the artist, is in the print room of the British Museum. Lucas also frequently contributed to the periodical presses where there was some debate as to whether his <span class="italic">Flora</span>, purchased by the Kaiser Friedrich Museum, Berlin, was by Leonardo da Vinci.<br>
<br>Towards the end of his life, Lucas's conversational prowess ensured that he was a frequent guest at Broadlands, the seat of Lord Palmerston, who obtained for him a civil-list pension in June 1865. Lucas made three wax portraits of Palmerston, and a statuette which formed his last exhibit at the Royal Academy in 1859. In 1870 he published <span class="italic">An Essay on Art</span>. Lucas died of paralysis at Tower of the Winds, Chilworth, on 18 May 1883, leaving a widow, Eliza (1805/6&#150;1893), and a son, Albert Durer Lucas (1828&#150;1918), a flower painter who exhibited at the British Institution and with the Society of Artists between 1859 and 1874. Grant noted that although Lucas was &#145;somewhat forgotten today&#146;, he was &#145;one of the leading sculptors of his time&#146;, whose sculptural portraits of women were particularly sensitive  (Grant, 153). Gunnis described Lucas as an artist of &#145;great originality&#146; whose works were characterized by their use of contrasting perspective  (Gunnis, 245).<br>
