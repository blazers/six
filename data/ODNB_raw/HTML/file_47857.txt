<span class="headword">Tyndall,  Onesiphorus</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1689, <em>d.</em> 1757), <span class="occ">banker and merchant</span>, was baptized on 28 May 1689 at Lewins Mead, Bristol, the eldest son of Onesiphorus Tyndall (1657&#150;1748), merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth Hopper (<i>b</i>. 1661) of Loxley, Warwickshire. His father went to Bristol in 1674 from Melksham Court, Gloucestershire, and was for many years a partner in the leading Bristol merchant house of Isaac Hobhouse &amp; Co., engaged in the West Indies trade in slaves, sugar, and tobacco. Early in the eighteenth century, Tyndall was probably apprenticed to his father in the trade of grocer and dry salter. On 6 November 1717 he married Elizabeth Cowles (1696&#150;1730) of Bristol, and together they had four children&#151;two sons and two daughters. The marriage ended with Elizabeth's death in December 1730, Tyndall remaining thereafter a widower. He lived for many years in the parish of Christchurch in Bristol, though in 1743 he inherited from his brother John a house in the Royal Fort, then on the northern fringes of the city, consolidating the family's close connection with the area.<br>
<br>Tyndall was notable for his role in the formation of the Old Bank, Bristol's first bona fide banking house, which commenced business on 1 August 1750. The date is significant, making it one of the earliest such private banks to be established in England and Wales outside London. As senior partner, Tyndall's business experience and extensive contacts, both within the Bristol region and beyond, were of great importance in securing the success of the new enterprise. Many of the early customers of the bank were drawn from the same mercantile, professional, and civic &eacute;lite to which Tyndall himself belonged.<br>
<br>However, banking interests came to Tyndall relatively late in life, after a long and varied association with the trading activities of the port of Bristol. Widely recognized as an eminent dry salter, he also followed his father into the West Indies trade and was still listed as trading to Africa in 1755, just two years before his death. Though not especially noted for his involvement in civic duties, Tyndall, a freeman of the city of Bristol, was none the less appointed verderer and chief ranger of the forest of Kingswood, in November 1734. Like many of the eighteenth-century merchants and bankers of Bristol's emerging business class, he was also actively involved in the city's nonconformist religious society.<br>
<br>Tyndall died in Bristol on 30 May 1757, aged sixty-eight. He was buried at Christchurch parish church, in the same ground as his wife, on 3 June 1757. The chief beneficiary of his considerable legacy was his youngest son, Thomas Tyndall (1723&#150;1794), who also succeeded him as a partner in the Old Bank.<br>
