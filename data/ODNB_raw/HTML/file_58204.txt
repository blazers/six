<span class="headword">Hayter, Sir  William Goodenough</span>  (1906&#150;1995), <span class="occ">diplomatist and college head</span>, was born on 1 August 1906 in Oxford, the only son and eldest of the three children of Sir William Goodenough Hayter (1869&#150;1924), a judge in the Anglo-Egyptian service, and his wife, Alethea, daughter of the Revd John Henry Slessor, rector of Headbourne Worthy, Hampshire. His younger sister was the author <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/97019/', "Alethea Catherine Hayter")</script>. Like his father, he was educated at Winchester College where&#151;also like his father&#151;he was a scholar and became prefect of hall (head boy). His notable school contemporaries included John Sparrow, William Empson, and Richard Crossman. From Winchester he again followed his father as the senior classical scholar to New College, Oxford. After such a promising early academic career his failure to get the expected firsts in both moderations and Greats caused much surprise and disappointment. However he won a travelling fellowship at Queen's College, Oxford, and spent the following nine months improving his French and more particularly his German as a prelude to taking the diplomatic service entrance examination in October 1930.<br>
<br>Having passed in third place into the diplomatic service, Hayter was posted for his first year to the League of Nations and the Western department of the Foreign Office. He was then posted to Vienna in October 1931 where he enjoyed cultivating the aristocratic <i>erste Gesellschaft</i>. By way of contrast he was posted from April 1934 to January 1937 to Moscow, where Stalin's purges were beginning and where the diplomatic corps was thrown back on its own social resources. He managed none the less to travel widely in the Soviet Union, visiting Ukraine, the Crimea, and the Caucasus&#151;the last in the company of the German ambassador, Count Schulenburg, who was later executed for his part in the plot against Hitler. After another brief spell in the League of Nations department, during which he played a minor part in the preparations for the coronation of King George VI and made a duty visit to Spain during the civil war, he was posted in October 1938 to the embassy in China, then accredited to the Kuomintang government of Chiang Kai-shek at Chungking (Chongqing), which was at war with Japan. Hayter was left in charge for some months in Chungking while his ambassador was based at Shanghai, but he also eventually returned to Shanghai. The prospect for the British mission in China looked precarious in the extreme (they were later interned by the Japanese) and Hayter was relieved to be posted to Washington as first secretary in December 1940. Arriving shortly before the attack on Pearl Harbor (the news of which he personally passed to London), he subsequently worked closely with both the state department and the American military authorities. On his return to the Foreign Office in May 1944 he worked first in a number of political departments before being promoted in February 1948 to be an assistant under-secretary of state; during this period in London he attended the Potsdam conference as secretary to the British delegation, which was headed successively by Churchill and Attlee, and for three years he held the key post of chairman of the joint intelligence committee of the chiefs of staff. His appointment as minister at the embassy in Paris in December 1949 reintroduced him to the glittering social world he had first known in pre-war Vienna. In his work he tended to be sceptical about the prospect of Britain's requiring or wishing to apply for entry to the European Coal and Steel Community, but he put forward the view that continental European collaboration was in British interests. From Paris in October 1953, at the early age of forty-six, he was appointed ambassador in Moscow. He was appointed KCMG in July 1953, having been made CMG in January 1948.<br>
<br>Hayter's mission to Moscow, which lasted until February 1957, was the high point of his diplomatic career. He arrived shortly after the death of Stalin, when the leadership of the Soviet Union was first in the hands of Malenkov and later of Khrushchov and (to a diminishing extent) Bulganin. The Soviet leadership was accessible for the first time for several decades, and Hayter took full advantage of this to consolidate personal links. He proposed to Eden that Bulganin and Khrushchov should be invited to Britain (the first such post-war visit) and he accompanied them on their tour. Although he had much dialogue with Khrushchov, he never claimed to have influenced fundamentally the latter's policies. One shadow over his mission was subsequently cast by the exposure of the spy Vassal in the naval attach&eacute;'s office, but Hayter was exonerated from any negligence over this by the subsequent inquiry. His final months in Moscow were dominated by the Soviet intervention in Hungary and by the Anglo-French intervention in Suez. Hayter felt frustrated by being kept in the dark about British intentions over Suez and was privately very critical of the enterprise, which he felt had lessened the chances of any Soviet withdrawal from Hungary; however, when the Soviet government sent a threatening note about Suez to the UK, hinting at the use of rockets, Hayter drafted a robust reply that was accepted by the prime minister. When, shortly after his return to London as deputy under-secretary (political) in the Foreign Office, Hayter was offered the wardenship of New College, Oxford, his acceptance was influenced by his disillusionment over Suez and his failure to see the way clear to any of those top jobs in the diplomatic service to which he aspired. He resigned from the diplomatic service in October 1958.<br>
<br>At New College, where he remained until his retirement in 1976, Hayter was an affable warden who took a keen interest in the undergraduates of the college and assumed the duties of admissions tutor. But he was conscious that being involved in neither teaching nor research limited his role at Oxford, and he did not play much part in university affairs outside his own college. He advocated the admission of women to the college more than a decade before it happened. His other activities included being a fellow of Winchester College (1958&#150;76) and a trustee of the British Museum (1960&#150;70). During his years at Oxford he wrote a number of books mostly about diplomacy and Russia, of which the best known were <span class="italic">The Kremlin and the Embassy</span> (1966) and an autobiography, <span class="italic">A Double Life</span> (1974). When eventually he retired to Bassetts House, in the village of Stanton St John, outside Oxford, he continued to write and to entertain his many friends.<br>
<br>Hayter had married on 19 October 1938 Iris Marie (<i>b</i>. 1911), the only child of Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Hervey Hoare (who assumed the surname Grey in 1927) and his first wife, Marie Elizabeth, daughter of Ludwig Leupold of Geneva, and widow of Sir Lepel Griffin. Hayter's wife played an exceptionally active and supportive role as a hostees throughout his diplomatic career and at New College, and it was she who provided the warmth for which their official residences were remembered. Their daughter, Teresa, was born in Shanghai in 1940. Hayter was considered by many of his contemporaries to be a quintessential Wykehamist: able, polished, and with an academic turn of mind. It was not coincidence but merit that accounted for his being in so many crucial places at crucial times. To his more astringent colleagues, however, both in the diplomatic service and at Oxford, he sometimes seemed to lack the industry and energy to follow up on detailed and mundane tasks. Only his closest friends broke through the canopy of charm to discover real warmth in his personality. He admitted to having lost his belief in Christianity while at school, but to retaining &#145;a kind of affectionate loyalty to the Church of England&#146;. He died at Stanton St John, Oxfordshire, on 28 March 1995; he was survived by his wife and daughter.<br>
