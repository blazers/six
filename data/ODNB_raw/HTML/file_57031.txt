<span class="headword">MacEwan,  (Alfred) Sydney Marley</span>  (1908&#150;1991), <span class="occ">singer and Roman Catholic priest</span>, was born on 19 October 1908 at 130 Keppockhill Road, Glasgow, the younger of the two sons of John Smith MacEwan, commercial traveller, and his wife, Jane (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Marley). His father left the family when Sydney was very young, and when he was five, although the family lived in Springburn, he was given permission to attend St Saviour's School, Govan, where his Irish mother taught. Aged twelve (his brother having put his name forward), he won the sum of 5<i>s</i>. singing in a talent competition in Dunoon. In 1920 he entered St Aloysius's (Jesuit) College in Garnethill, where he was unhappy, partly because Latin was not taught. He attended evening classes for violin and singing, as well as Latin, before making a happy move to Hillhead High, a protestant school where he and his brother were the only two Catholic pupils. His &#145;intense affection&#146; for the church led him to study for the priesthood, and in 1925 he entered the Jesuit noviciate at Manresa House, Roehampton, London, where conversation was in Latin except at recreation. After finding himself unsuited to his calling, he left after six months and was admitted to Glasgow University in October 1926. At about this time he sang for the first time as a tenor and was taught by Mr Reid at The Athenaeum, the city of Glasgow's school of music. He was afterwards to describe Reid as &#145;the finest teacher in all my experience&#146;  (MacEwan, 90). He graduated MA and spent one year in teacher training at Jordanhill College, with music as his special subject. Aged twenty-two he entered the Royal Academy of Music in London, where he was taught by Sir Henry Wood, John Barbirolli, and Harry Plunkett-Greene. An unknown benefactor (widely thought to have been Compton McKenzie) paid his fees.<br>
<br>In 1932 MacEwan signed a recording contract with Parlophone which lasted more than thirty years. Compton McKenzie, whom he had met in Glasgow, arranged for the celebrated tenor John McCormack to hear him; McCormack later asked MacEwan to sing for him in Dublin just before he died, and bequeathed him the black notebook in which he recorded the words of his songs, and his prayer book. On 17 March 1936 MacEwan sailed on the <i>Tamaroa</i> with Duncan Morison (1902/3&#150;1998), his accompanist, for a tour of New Zealand sponsored by the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation; this was so successful it was extended to Australia. Tours followed to Canada and the USA, with a repertory of mainly Scottish and Irish folk-songs, including &#145;Bonnie earl of Moray&#146;, &#145;Believe me if all those endearing young charms&#146;, and &#145;Ho-ro my nut-brown maiden&#146;. Following a hurricane on a ship from Honolulu to Canada, MacEwan made a decision to become a priest. This decision was kept secret while the remainder of his concert obligations were discharged. In 1938 MacEwan entered the Scots College, Rome, which he later described as &#145;a gay, jolly eventful place&#146;  (MacEwan, 192). His three-year course was cut to two, and he was able to travel home each summer.<br>
<br>When the Second World War broke out, MacEwan was in South Uist and was not able to return to Rome, attending instead a seminary at Bearsden, Glasgow. He was ordained on 24 June 1944 in St Andrew's Cathedral, Glasgow, and the following day, before a packed attendance, celebrated his first mass in St Aloysius's, Garnethill, remembered by many for years afterwards. An ailing John McCormack sent a telegram to mark the occasion. MacEwan's appointment as curate at St Andrew's prompted radio news all over the world, and an hour of Sydney MacEwan records was played on Australian radio. In carrying out his duties as a priest he was surprised to find 40 per cent of parishioners not practising their faith, and described himself as &#145;daily face to face with abject poverty&#146;  (MacEwan, 209). Processions of fans had to be turned away, and he received visitors only on parish business. In 1948 he flew to Melbourne to represent the bishops at the centenary of the Melbourne archdiocese, where he met both Cardinal Spellman and Eamon de Valera, celebrated many masses, and gave a series of concerts (extended from a planned three to fifteen). On his return he asked to be released from the cathedral and be sent to Lochgilphead on Loch Fyne, Argyll, where he remained for the next seventeen years, commuting regularly to London to sing for the BBC and to attend recording sessions. During a tour of Australia (accompanied by his mother) he suffered from nervous exhaustion and was admitted to hospital in Perth. He continued to America and as a result donated a cheque for &#145;thousands of pounds&#146; to the church. In 1954, 1955, and 1956, he toured America where he attended many society dinner parties and on one occasion met the young John F. Kennedy.<br>
<br>MacEwan was anxious to promote &#145;real&#146; folk music, rather than synthetic &#145;popular&#146; tunes, and always refused to sing &#145;When Irish eyes are smiling&#146;, although often requested to do so, especially in the United States. His versions of &#145;She moved through the fair&#146; and &#145;The lark in the clear air&#146; were particularly well received. He recorded a mass in Rome (at 3 a.m. because of street noise) but the result was never issued in the UK. He was unhappy with an edition of <span class="italic">This is your Life</span> which he described as a &#145;trivial little cameo&#146;  (MacEwan, 306). His mother died at the age of eighty-nine but, as the death occurred in Holy Week, she was denied the requiem mass he had promised her.<br>
<br>Earlier in his life MacEwan had suffered from M&eacute;ni&egrave;re's disease, and when this worsened he spent several months in the kinder climate of Malaga. After recovering somewhat, he returned to become the parish priest in Kingussie in Speyside. He died of renal failure and acute pancreatitis in the Southern General Hospital, Glasgow, on 25 September 1991. In his introduction to MacEwan's autobiography, <span class="italic">On the High C's (a Light-Hearted Journey)</span>, published in 1973, Compton Mackenzie wrote &#145;At this time [the 1950s], he was the greatest living interpreter of Celtic music&#146;, and indeed his reception at the docks on his various tours to America was more akin to that usually accorded to film or pop stars.<br>
