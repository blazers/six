<span class="headword">Payne,  George</span>  (1781&#150;1848), <span class="occ">Congregational minister</span>, was born at Stow on the Wold, Gloucestershire, on 17 September 1781, the youngest son of Alexander Payne (1748?&#150;1819), a cooper, and his wife, Mary Dyer (1742/3&#150;1814) of Bampton. His father, who was initially an Anglican, became a Baptist after hearing the sermons of Law Butterworth of Bingworth, and in 1783 became the Baptist preacher to the church of Walgrave, Northamptonshire, where he served for thirty-three years. Two years later, in June 1785, he baptized his own wife, and he was ordained on 6 July. Along with Fuller and Carey he was a founder of the Baptist Missionary Society.<br>
<br>George Payne went to school at Walgrave, and subsequently at the Northampton Academy. He entered Hoxton Academy to study for the Congregational ministry in 1802, and on 13 April 1804 he was elected, with Joseph Fletcher, Glasgow scholar on the Dr Williams trust. The two proceeded to Glasgow University together. Payne graduated MA in the spring of 1807, and returned home, marrying, on 30 October 1807, a daughter of Alexander Gibbs, a corn factor, and member of the Scottish church in Hoxton. He acted for a year as assistant minister to Edward Parsons of Leeds. On 28 August 1808 he accepted an invitation to become George Lambert's permanent coadjutor at Fish Street, Hull. After ending his engagement at Hull on 14 June 1812, Payne was ordained at Edinburgh on the following 2 July, and took charge of a congregation of seceders who had divided from James Alexander Haldane in March 1808 after his rejection of infant baptism. This body met in Bernard's Rooms, Thistle Street, Edinburgh, until a new chapel was built in Albany Street. It was opened on 2 May 1817, and here Payne ministered until 1823. While in Edinburgh he contributed to Congregational literature and assisted in the foundation of the Edinburgh Itinerant Society and the Congregational Union of Scotland, of which he was joint secretary from 1812 to 1816.<br>
<br>In April 1823 Payne left Scotland to become theological tutor of the Blackburn Independent Academy, the precursor of the Lancashire Independent college (later Northern College), Manchester; for his first two or three years in Blackburn, Payne also acted as pastor to a Congregational church which met in Mount Street. On 18 November 1829 he received the degree of honorary LLD from the University of Glasgow on the occasion of the publication of his <span class="italic">Elements of Mental and Moral Science</span>. In July 1829 he left Blackburn to become theological tutor to the Western Academy, which had just moved from Axminster to Exeter. In 1836 he was chosen as chairman of the Congregational Union of England and Wales. In 1844 he preached the eleventh series of the Congregational lectures initiated by the committee of the Congregational library in Bloomfield Street, Finsbury; his course of eight lectures was published in the following year. In January 1846 the Western College (as it was now known) was moved from Exeter to a site between Devonport and Plymouth. In April 1848 Payne visited Scotland as the delegate from the Congregational Union of England and Wales.<br>
<br>Payne's writings prove him to have had a genuine gift for metaphysical speculation. He wrote, apart from sermons and short tracts, eleven books, of which the most significant were <span class="italic">Elements of Mental and Moral Science</span> (1828), <span class="italic">Lectures on Divine Sovereignty, Election, the Atonement, Justification, and Regeneration</span> (1836), and <span class="italic">The Doctrine of Original Sin, or, The Nature, State, and Character of Man Unfolded</span> (1845). Payne died on 19 June 1848 at Devonport, after preaching at Mount Street Chapel there. He was buried on 27 June at Emma Place Chapel, Stonehouse, in the grave of his wife, who had died on 25 October 1847.<br>
