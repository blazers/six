<span class="headword">MacMunn,  Norman</span>  (1877&#150;1925), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and educationist</span>, was born on 20 July 1877 at Waterloo Road, Wolverhampton, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/60707/', "Charles Alexander MacMunn (1852&#150;1911)")</script>, a surgeon and later honorary pathologist at Wolverhampton Royal Hospital, and his first wife, Laetitia (<i>n&eacute;e</i> MacMunn). His education from 1882 at a dame-school in Wolverhampton and from 1889 to 1895 at Wolverhampton grammar school he described as &#145;mental agony&#146;, as he worked not on prescribed lines but read voraciously out of school hours. He entered Keble College, Oxford, in 1895 with plans for the church as a career, but he developed an interest in the stage, transferred to Marcon's Hall, Oxford, in 1897, and graduated in 1899 with a third-class degree in English literature. He worked at first in journalism and travelled to Australia and New Zealand, where he spent six years on the <span class="italic">Auckland Star</span> as literary and drama critic and sub-editor, then returned to England as a reviewer for <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>. He decided to take up educational work, moved to Paris, and taught at the Berlitz School and in a large <i>lyc&eacute;e</i>; he was subsequently appointed in 1913 as a teacher of French at King Edward VI Grammar School, Stratford upon Avon.<br>
<br>There MacMunn developed and publicized his &#145;differential partnership method&#146; of teaching, introducing activity and creativity into the classroom, a system which corresponded with contemporary innovations such as the &#145;direct method&#146; of language teaching. <span class="italic">A Path to Freedom in the School</span>, which he published in 1914, was dedicated to the boys of the school for their zeal and sympathy in developing the new freedom, and acknowledged the inspiration of Montessori, Homer Lane, and Edmond Holmes. It expounded a theory of child emancipation, outlined practical solutions, and looked forward to the &#145;commonwealth school&#146;.<br>
<br>Rejected on health grounds for war service, MacMunn moved in 1914 to West Downs, Winchester, a well-known preparatory school, under its innovating and influential headmaster, Lionel Helbert. There the regime was marked by intense concern for individuals and supportive, familiar relationships with boys. MacMunn was given the freedom to develop his radical new methods, including the establishment of clubs for science, literature, and painting.<br>
<br>In September 1918 MacMunn took a lease on Tiptree Hall, near Kelvedon, Essex, to found a school for war orphans. He worked ceaselessly with his own hands at repairing and furnishing the premises but was hampered by lack of funds. The school opened in January 1919 with twenty boys and girls, but after a year the girls had gone and MacMunn was left with a few of the poorest boys. On 11 November 1919 he married Ethel May Scanlan (<i>b</i>. 1881/2), who had joined the staff of the school in the previous March; she was the daughter of William Robert Scanlan, civil engineer. By July 1920 MacMunn had to find homes for his nine orphans and reluctantly took on fee-paying pupils, leading to conflict with parents who rejected the more extreme aspects of his regime, such as a refusal to include compulsory games or to prepare boys for public school. Tiptree was a &#145;self-governing community&#146; with children free to construct the greater part of their own timetables, and MacMunn described his role as &#145;chief adviser&#146;. Visitors from many parts of the world included Helen Parkhurst, who developed her own innovatory teaching methods in Dalton, Massachusetts.<br>
<br>From 1914 MacMunn had been active as a contributor to conferences and journals promoting new methods in education, designing, developing, and exhibiting teaching apparatus. Typical was the &#145;card cyclopaedia&#146;, a card catalogue of words and information made collaboratively with his pupils by cutting and pasting extracts from books. In 1921 he published <span class="italic">The Child's Path to Freedom</span>, a version of his 1914 volume entirely rewritten in the light of six further years of experience. It was a highly successful and influential work, and was posthumously republished in 1926 with a foreword by Percy Nunn. MacMunn drew on Freud and on his own teaching experience. He saw himself as an early pioneer relieved to find acceptance in the climate of Montessorism and the new ideals from 1914 onwards. &#145;Differentialism&#146; was his own attempt to foster individuality; he worried about the effects of the class lesson on children, and when contemporaries encouraged him to take his theories seriously he was driven to more radical steps. &#145;To have arrived in practice at the ideal of a school free from rewards and punishment&#151;from compulsion of any sort; &hellip; to have eliminated the class and based all on individual taste and choice&#151;this is to imply a new and not yet easily-digested educational creed&#146;  (N. MacMunn, &#145;The wisdom of educational experiment&#146;, <span class="italic">Hibbert Journal</span>, 1920, 740). He shared with others during and after the First World War the view that traditional school discipline had resulted in German autocracy. In children alone lay the hope of a reformed world. He exhibited the messianic enthusiasm of the first progressives; like others, he acquired the reputation of a crank as he developed his ideas, but his book was widely read, and his ideas widely disseminated among new generations of teachers by John Adams and Percy Nunn.<br>
<br>In January 1924 MacMunn moved his school to Rapallo, Italy, with four boys from Tiptree, and in December the school moved again to San Remo, where it was known as the Home School. The number of boys went up to over twelve, but again he lost many potential pupils because of his unwillingness to compromise with parents. On 8 October 1925 he died at San Remo from bronchopneumonia, and a memorial fund was established by friends and sympathizers who subscribed to bring his card cyclopaedia over from Italy and to give away hundreds of copies of his book to teacher training colleges.<br>
