<span class="headword">Fanshawe <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Harrison]</span>,  Ann</span>, Lady Fanshawe  (1625&#150;1680), <span class="occ">autobiographer</span>, was born on 25 March 1625 in Hart Street in the parish of St Olave, London, the daughter of Sir John Harrison (<i>d</i>. 1669) of Balls Park, Hertfordshire, and his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1640), daughter of Robert Fanshawe of Fanshawe Gate, Derbyshire. From the Palladian elegance of the house at Balls which her father completed in the early 1640s it may be conjectured that her family, like that of her future husband, belonged to that section of the Caroline &eacute;lite precociously sensitive to continental developments in the arts. Her education was undertaken at home in London in the charge of her mother and was brought to an end by her mother's death in July 1640. Ann's autobiographical record enumerates the accomplishments acquired by a gentry child of the 1630s&#151;music, dancing, French, and needlework&#151;but also remembers that her inclination was towards riding and running, and that she was then &#145;what we graver people call a hoyting girle&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, ed. Loftis, 111). After her mother's death she took charge of her father's household through what proved to be years of unaccustomed adversity. Her brother William joined King Charles when he raised his standard at Nottingham, and pledged that their father would lend the king the then immense sum of &pound;50,000. In 1642 her father was taken prisoner by the parliament, held under house arrest in London, and threatened with transportation. His entire estate was sequestrated so that, when his daughters joined him in the royalist stronghold of Oxford the following year,<blockquote>from as good a house as any gentleman of England had we came to a baker's house in an obscure street, and from rooms well furnished to lye in a very bad bed in a garrett, to one dish of meat and that not the best ordered; no mony, for we were as poor as Job, nor clothes more than a man or two brought in their cloak bags. (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, ed. Loftis, 111)</blockquote>On 18 May 1644 Ann married her second cousin, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9149/', "Richard (later Sir Richard) Fanshawe (1608&#150;1666)")</script> at Wolvercote church, near Oxford, in a modest ceremony whose scale gives an accurate sense of the reduced circumstances of the besieged court (there were only a handful of guests, including Edward Hyde, the future earl of Clarendon, and the wedding-ring itself was secondhand). From this point the course of her life was directed by her marriage to one of the chief diplomats and linguists in the service of the Stuarts. The marriage, as recorded by Ann herself, seems to have been an entirely happy one, equal and companionate to a degree unusual for the mid-seventeenth century, with genuine mutual sympathy perhaps fostered by travels and adversities undertaken together as well as by an absolute shared commitment to the royalist cause.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, which Ann composed in 1676, a decade after her husband's death, give a full account of their travels in the years of the second civil war and the interregnum, as well as recording the births of twenty-four children of whom only three survived into adulthood. In 1645 the Fanshawes followed the retreating forces of Charles, prince of Wales, into the west of England, and in the following year to the Scilly and Channel Islands, and thence, in August 1646, to France. They then separated and Lady Fanshawe returned to London alone, where her husband joined her secretly by August 1647, remaining there until a visit to France and to the exiled court of Henrietta Maria at the end of the year.<br>
<br>In September 1648 the Fanshawes began another sequence of travels, from Paris to Ireland, where they remained until their departure in February 1650 for Spain. While in Ireland, Lady Fanshawe survived the 1649 rebellion in Cork, and early the next year saw and heard the banshee in the house of the O'Brien earls of Thomond, an experience vividly recorded in her <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>. On her return from Spain to London in 1651, her husband being absent with Charles II's disastrous campaign in Scotland, she began the compilation of her manuscript household book. In the latter part of the year, while her husband was imprisoned after the disastrous battle of Worcester, she visited the window of his prison daily until she obtained his release on bail on the grounds of his ill health. In 1653 and 1654, a period of retirement at Tankersley Park near Sheffield in Yorkshire came to an end after the death of a daughter, Ann, which appears to have affected both parents greatly. Thereafter a period of ill health and travel between Bath and Hertfordshire ended with her husband's departure for France in November 1658 to join Charles II. She followed him in June 1659, having obtained a pass by impersonating a citizen's wife and then forging her own name onto it.<br>
<br>In May 1660 the Fanshawes returned to England with Charles II. In August 1662 they left for Portugal where Ann's husband was sent as ambassador, returning in August of the next year. The last of Lady Fanshawe's travels, with her husband's embassy to Madrid, began in January 1664. Despite her recorded enjoyment of the deference accorded to an ambassador's wife and her personal success at the Spanish court, her husband was recalled in March 1666, perhaps for having exceeded his instructions, shortly after which he fell sick and died. After his death, on 16/26 June 1666, refusing offers of a pension at the Spanish court on the condition that she embrace Catholicism, Ann embarked upon an impoverished and anxious return journey to England, accompanying the embalmed body of her husband which she interred temporarily in Hertford, before erecting an elaborate tomb for him in St Mary's, Ware, in 1670. She issued his last translation (of the Spanish court play <span class="italic">Querer por solo querer</span>) privately as a posthumous memorial to him, a process of commemoration brought to completion in her <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> of 1676, written for her sole surviving son, Richard. For much of the remainder of her life she was occupied in the largely unsuccessful attempt to recover debts from an increasingly indifferent royal Treasury, an attempt which elicited the mockery of Delariviere Manley in her scabrous <span class="italic">New Atalantis</span> (1709).<br>
<br>A complementary insight into Ann Fanshawe's life is given by her manuscript household book. This remains unpublished despite its considerable interest as a reflection of the degree to which an &eacute;lite woman of the mid-seventeenth century was directly involved with the quotidian running of her household&#151;as well as stillroom and medical recipes (which latter appear uniformly unhelpful if not actively dangerous)&#151;and also contains a representative number of Spanish recipes. This places Lady Fanshawe among that small group of Caroline gentry of whom Sir Kenelm Digby is the most eminent, who introduced the cookery of the continent into their English households. She died in January 1680 and was buried on 20 January at St Mary's, Ware.<br>
