<span class="headword">Knott,  Edward</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Matthew Wilson]</span>  (1581&#150;1656), <span class="occ">Jesuit</span>, was born Matthew Wilson at Catchburn, Morpeth, Northumberland, on 24 February 1581. His father was Edward Wilson but his mother's name is unknown; he described his parents as &#145;respectable&#146;  (Kenny, 122). His family in the main conformed to the established religion. He received some education in England and then through the offices of a Catholic friend was sent to the English College, Douai, arriving on 24 September 1599. Here he was accepted into the Roman Catholic church. On 20 August 1602 he left for the English College, Rome. He was duly ordained priest on 27 March 1606 and entered the Society of Jesus in October of that year. He completed the rigorous training of a Jesuit, taking the four vows finally on 30 September 1618, and played the while an active part in the work of the English College, Rome.<br>
<br>Then in 1622 the decision was taken to send Knott north, to the English mission. There were to be three strands to his life now: he continued to work as an educationist; this role was combined with the position as one of the leading administrators of the English province; and he became a writer of religious tracts. Much of his time was spent in the Spanish Netherlands in the various educational institutions attached to the English province: as superior of the noviciate at Watten in 1622 and 1637&#150;8; rector and then prefect of the house of studies at Li&egrave;ge in 1627&#150;8 and 1646; and as spiritual prefect at the tertianship in Ghent, 1647&#150;9. The provincial in London required a deputy over the channel to run the fairly considerable English establishment in the Spanish Netherlands. Much of Knott's career was passed in this capacity: a year after he arrived (1623) he was appointed vice-provincial in what would later become Belgium; in 1625&#150;6 and 1632 he was designated substitute for the provincial there. He did, however, work in England, based largely in London, certainly in 1624, 1635&#150;6, 1643&#150;4, 1645&#150;6, 1647, and in the early 1650s. He was captured when returning to England in April 1629 and was imprisoned in the Clink until January 1632, when he was released through the intercession of Marie de' Medici, and banished.<br>
<br>Knott was well regarded by his superiors and colleagues, and there was little competition for the extremely difficult position of provincial. In November 1630 Richard Blount recommended that Knott succeed him in that post, but the general was reluctant, pointing out that he had worked almost entirely on the continent and was not well known in England; he was also in prison. As a result Knott was passed over in favour of Henry More. When More stood down Knott was eventually appointed, on 3 June 1639. But now a new difficulty faced him. From 1630 Knott had been active as a controversial religious writer; he was to write a total of eight titles, some of which went through more than one edition. Knott was a most effective pamphleteer, generally&#151;and for his age, unusually&#151;concise, writing one book, as he tells us, in one week. He engaged in two great debates: first as part of the internecine Catholic disputes between regulars and seculars over the appointment of a bishop to the English mission, which he opposed. Second, he played a part in a long-running controversy with the protestant Edward Chillingworth. His contribution to this debate was considered sufficiently offensive by Charles I for the king to let it be known that he did not wish Knott to take up his appointment as provincial in 1639. So Knott was ordered by the general to remain in the Netherlands. When, in June 1643, he finally came to England as provincial Knott began a tour of the priests under his command. His stay was again cut short, this time by the need to attend in November 1645 the general congregation called to Rome to elect a general in succession to Vitelleschi. Here he acquitted himself well, always adding, according to report, something new when it came to his turn to speak. By now Knott was certainly the most important English Jesuit; it was he who was given the task by the general of choosing which of two candidates should be the next provincial in 1646; he was nominated in 1649 by the outgoing provincial as his replacement, but not appointed. Finally, in March 1652 he was reappointed provincial. He died in office on 4 January 1656 in London, and was buried next day in the church of St Pancras.<br>
