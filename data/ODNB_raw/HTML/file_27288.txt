<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thoms,  William John</span>  (1803&#150;1885), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born in Westminster, London, on 16 November 1803, the son of Nathaniel Thoms, a clerk in the Treasury and acting secretary of the first commission of revenue inquiry, and his wife, Ruth Ann. Thoms began his working life as a clerk in the secretary's office at Chelsea Hospital, a position he held until 1844. His principal interests, early conceived, were in literature and bibliography, especially the latter. In bibliography he received much help from Thomas Amyot, the antiquary, through whom he became acquainted with Francis Douce. Douce encouraged Thoms in his studies, lent him books and manuscripts from his great library in Gower Street, and gave him much assistance in editing his first publication, <span class="italic">Early Prose Romances</span>. This was composed of eleven tales, divided into three volumes published in 1827 and 1828. Henry Morley edited the collection in 1907, adding three tales. In 1828 Thoms married Laura (<i>b</i>. 1807/8), the youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24532/', "John Bernard Sale")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24531/', "Sale, John")</script>], singer and composer; they had three sons and six daughters. Thoms's next publications were <span class="italic">Lays and Legends of France, Spain, Tartary, and Ireland</span> and <span class="italic">Lays and Legends of Germany</span>, in which he was assisted by Douce; both appeared in 1834. In 1832 he had tried his hand at periodical literature as the editor of <span class="italic">The Original</span>, a &#145;miscellany of humour, literature, and the fine arts&#146;. It lasted a little over four months, running to twenty-two numbers.<br>
<br>In 1838 Thoms was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and in the same year was appointed the first secretary of the Camden Society, a post he held until 1873. His <span class="italic">Book of the Court</span> (1838; 2nd edn 1844) gave an account of the nature, origin, duties, and privileges of the several ranks of the nobility, of the great offices of state, and the members of the royal household. He illustrated this treatise with anecdotes and quotations drawn from sources often inaccessible to the ordinary student. In 1839 he compiled for the Camden Society <span class="italic">Anecdotes and traditions illustrative of English history and literature from manuscript sources</span>, made up largely of Sir Nicholas L'Estrange's <span class="italic">Merry Passages and Jests</span>. In 1842 his edition of John Stow's <span class="italic">Survey of London</span> was published (it was reissued in 1876 without his sanction). In 1844 he prepared for the <span class="roman">Early English Poetry</span> series of the Percy Society an edition of <span class="italic">The history of Reynard the fox, with notes and an introductory sketch of the literary history of the romance</span> from the edition by William Caxton in 1481. There were twenty-five pages of appended notes, largely of a philological nature, and the dedication reads to &#145;Thomas Amyot by his Faithful and Attached Friend&#146;.<br>
<br>Thoms was appointed a clerk of the House of Lords on 19 July 1845. Soon his reputation as an antiquary, coupled with his conversational charm, drew to his room a number of the more literate members of the house, and among those who came to enjoy learned conversations were Brougham, Lyndhurst, Macaulay, and Stanhope. The duties of his new position enabled Thoms to continue his literary endeavours, so that in 1846, under the pseudonym Ambrose Merton, he published two volumes of tales and ballads (reprinted in 1969). He went on to publish <span class="italic">Primeval Antiquities of Denmark</span> (1849), a translation of the work by Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae.<br>
<br>Shortly after this, Thoms turned his attention to another form of literary enterprise. As early as 1841 he had strongly felt the need for a periodical which would give antiquaries and bibliographers some avenue for making known to one another points on which they needed information. Hence, in that year, with the co-operation of his friend John Bruce (1802&#150;1869), he projected such a periodical. It was entitled &#145;The Medium&#146;, and some specimen pages were actually set up in type. But Bruce was compelled for domestic reasons to move to the country, and the project was abandoned. In 1846, however, Thoms persuaded Charles Wentworth Dilke, proprietor of <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, to open its columns &#145;to notices of old-world manners, customs, and popular superstitions&#146;. He introduced the subject on 26 August in an article titled &#145;Folk lore&#146;, a term which he introduced into the English language. In the article he wrote that what in English would be designated &#145;Popular Antiquities, or Popular Literature&#146; would be &#145;most aptly described by a good Saxon compound, Folk-Lore&#151;the Lore of the People&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>).<br>
<br>The items submitted to <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> soon became so numerous, however, that they began to demand more space than was available, and so Thoms established a separate periodical: <span class="italic">Notes and Queries: a Medium of Inter-Communication for Literary Men, Artists, Antiquaries, Genealogists, etc.</span>, priced at 3<i>d</i>. with a stamped edition for four pence. The first number bore the date 10 November 1849 and included, among other notes, J. P. Collier on Shakespeare and deer stealing, and contributions by other members of the Camden Society, notably Thoms's friend John Bruce. Thoms's own contribution was entitled &#145;&#147;Pray remember the grotto!&#148; on St James's Day&#146;. The periodical proved popular, with a circulation of 600 copies after a few weeks. Thoms resigned as editor in September 1872, and was succeeded by John Doran. The periodical continued into the twenty-first century, and in establishing it Thoms had provided a valuable service to literary and historical scholarship, &#145;joining the efforts of amateur collectors with the disciplined researches of the anthropologists&#146;  (Spurgeon, 282). <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span> played an important role in the founding of the English Dialect Society, and in the preparation of the <span class="italic">English Dialect Dictionary</span>, the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, and the <span class="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</span>.<br>
<br>Charles Dickens admitted to being a &#145;diligent reader of &hellip; N and Q&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Charles Dickens</span>, 10.461), and also told Thoms at the periodical's inception that &#145;It has given me, I assure you, great pleasure to see my good friend Captain Cuttle's name (and sentiment) appended to your very curious and interesting publication&#146;, referring to the motto of <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span>, taken from <span class="italic">Dombey and Son</span>: &#145;When found, make a note of&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Charles Dickens</span>, 6.108). Dickens was at this time answering Thoms's request for a donation towards the repair of Chaucer's tomb in Westminster Abbey (Thoms was secretary of the committee formed for this project, and among its other members were John Payne Collier, Peter Cunningham, and Sir Frederick Madden). The two men went on to become better acquainted, with Dickens visiting Thoms for a holiday in the summer of 1862  (<span class="italic">Letters of Charles Dickens</span>, 9.551, n. 4), and later thanking Thoms for a pre-publication copy of his <span class="italic">Three Notelets on Shakespeare</span> (1865).<br>
<br>This latter work was produced during Thoms's tenure as assistant librarian of the House of Lords&#151;he had been appointed in 1862, and held the post until three years before his death. The <span class="italic">Three Notelets</span> consisted of &#145;Shakespeare in Germany&#146;, &#145;Folk-lore of Shakespeare&#146;, and &#145;Was Shakespeare ever a soldier?&#146;, copiously annotated essays originally published in 1840, 1847, and 1859. Thoms dedicated the <span class="italic">Three Notelets</span> to his wife, &#145;Who in Herself Realizes Many of Shakespeare's Types of Womanly Excellence&#146;. He reprinted in 1867 in book form four articles from <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span> with some additions, followed in 1872 by a reprint from <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span> of &#145;The death warrant of Charles I, another historic doubt&#146;, demonstrating the difficulty in obtaining the necessary signatures for Charles I's death warrant, and the irregularity of the expedients to which army leaders were reduced. His iconoclastic treatise entitled <span class="italic">Human Longevity, its Facts and its Fictions</span> (1873) raised a storm of protest by its contention that the authentic cases in which human life had been prolonged to a hundred years and upwards were extremely rare.<br>
<br>William John Thoms died in London at his house at 40 St George's Square, Belgrave Road, on 15 August 1885, and was buried in Brompton cemetery.<br>
