<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Evans,  Philip</span> <span class="st"> [St Philip Evans]</span>  (1645&#150;1679), <span class="occ">Jesuit</span>, was born in Monmouthshire to William Evans and his wife, Winifred, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Morgan. His sister was professed as a Blue Nun in Paris and became known as Sister Barbara Catherine. Philip Evans was educated at the English College, St Omer, and on 8 September 1665 he entered the Society of Jesus. After the completion of his noviciate at Watten and further studies he was ordained priest at the English College, Li&egrave;ge. In 1675 he was sent to conduct missionary work in south Wales and lived at the Jesuit college at Cwm in Llanrothal parish on the Monmouthshire&#150;Herefordshire border. It has also been suggested that he was an occasional visitor to the Catholic household of the marquess of Powis at Powis Castle, but in 1678 he was a guest of Thomas Gunter, a recusant who lived at Abergavenny, and he lived at the home of Charles Proger of Wern-ddu in Llandeilo Bertholau in Monmouthshire.<br>
<br>On 4 December 1678, at the height of intense persecution of Roman Catholics during the Popish Plot, Evans was captured at the house of his loyal friend and patron, Sir Christopher Turberville of Sker House, near Porth-cawl in Glamorgan. He was quickly brought before Judge Richard Lougher and was later offered bail by Sir Edward Stradling if he agreed to swear to the oaths of allegiance and supremacy. He refused to comply with this request and was consequently committed to gaol for three weeks, possibly in the Black Tower of Cardiff Castle. During this period of confinement he was kept in an underground cellar and allowed no visitors.<br>
<br>Evans's persecutors had difficulty finding witnesses willing to testify against him or to produce any evidence of his being a priest. Eventually they forced an old poor woman and her daughter to testify upon oath that they had witnessed him say mass as well as preach in Latin, English, and Welsh. On 8 and 9 May 1679, after being confined for five months, he was brought before the spring assizes in the Shire Hall in Cardiff and charged with being a Roman Catholic priest. Mayne Trott, an apostate, and two female witnesses were subpoenaed by John Arnold of Llanfihangel Crucornau in Monmouthshire to give evidence against him. Earlier in November 1678 Arnold, the main persecutor of Roman Catholic priests in south Wales, had offered &pound;200 in addition to the &pound;50 reward the government had tendered for the apprehension and conviction of any Jesuit. Trott's unsubstantiated evidence implicated Evans in the alleged plot, and upon the further evidence of the two women he was condemned to death. He was sentenced to be hanged, drawn, and quartered by Judge Owen Wynne under the statute of 27 Elizabeth for being a priest.<br>
<br>The execution was delayed until 22 July 1679, when Evans was taken from Cardiff gaol with Father John Lloyd. Both priests were put in a cart and with their arms tied behind them they were taken to Gallows Field. Evans was the first to be executed. Before mounting the gallows he knelt and kissed them, cried out &#145;welcome good cross&#146;  (Ellis, 120), and then began praying. The ladder to the gallows was too short and consequently it moved when his neck was placed in the noose. One of the sheriff's bailiffs therefore took hold of his legs and twisted them after his body. He was later disembowelled while still conscious, decapitated, and quartered.<br>
<br>It has been recorded that Evans was<blockquote>remarkable for his unaffected candour and modesty; he had a cheerful and open countenance, marked by religious gravity. He was diligent in prayer, most observant of discipline, and obedient to the very nod of his Superior; and in his earnest desire to comply with the wishes of all, he made himself universally beloved. (Gillow, <span class="italic">Lit. biog. hist.</span>, 187)</blockquote>Shortly after the execution of the two Jesuits &#145;Short memorandums&#146; about them were published at London; on 25 October 1970 Paul VI canonized Evans as one of the forty martyrs of England and Wales.<br>
