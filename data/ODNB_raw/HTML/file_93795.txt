<span class="headword">Jebb <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Reynolds; <em>other married name </em>Slemmer]</span>,  Caroline Lane</span>, Lady Jebb  (1840&#150;1930), <span class="occ">academic hostess</span>, was born in Milford, Delaware, USA, on 26 December 1840, the youngest of the three daughters and one son who survived to adulthood of John Reynolds, a clergyman in the Protestant Episcopal Church who was rector of Christ Church, Milford, and his wife, Eleanor, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Evans, of Perkiomen, Pennsylvania. As a young man her father had emigrated from England to America, where he was ordained and, in 1832, married her mother.<br>
<br>Caroline Reynolds's childhood was peripatetic as the family moved to parishes as far apart as Tennessee, Connecticut, and New Jersey. Aged fourteen she graduated from St Mary's Hall (later Doane's Academy) in Burlington, New Jersey. In 1857 she married Lieutenant Adam Jacoby Slemmer of Norristown, Pennsylvania, and their son, Albert, was born a year later. When the American Civil War began, Caroline decided that her husband's military achievements had not been sufficiently recognized, so went to see Abraham Lincoln in person. Her strength of personality was evident in a note the president wrote afterwards recommending Lieutenant Slemmer for promotion: &#145;his pretty wife says a Major or First Captain&#146;  (Lincoln correspondence, ser. 1, July 1861).<br>
<br>Caroline's only son died of diphtheria in 1862, and after her husband's death of heart disease in 1868 she moved to West Philadelphia to live with her sister and widowed mother. After turning down several marriage proposals, including one from the business magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt, she travelled to Europe in 1870. Her plans to visit the continent had to be abandoned because of the Franco-Prussian War, and instead she spent a year in Cambridge, staying with her cousin Jeannetta and her husband, the mathematician Robert Potts.<br>
<br>Cambridge in the early 1870s was still a remote, semi-monastic place. With her auburn hair, &#145;Titianesque beauty of eyes&#146;, and American vitality, Caroline Slemmer sent &#145;a thrill through the social atmosphere&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 24 July 1930). She refused three proposals on the same day, more interested in the educational opportunities that Cambridge offered, and attending lectures in zoology, moral philosophy, law, and German literature. Despite this she made light of her intellectual interests, saying she particularly enjoyed Alfred Marshall's lectures in political economy because they supplied &#145;such good after-dinner conversation&#146;  (Marshall, 24).<br>
<br>One don whose proposal Slemmer turned down was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34166/', "Richard Claverhouse Jebb (1841&#150;1905)")</script>, an Irish classical scholar and public orator for the university. After she returned to Philadelphia in 1871 they continued to correspond, however. Richard's translations into Greek and Latin verse, and editions of Sophocles and Theophrastus were noticed in the literary world, and his social circles included Leslie Stephen, Annie Thackeray, Robert Browning, and George Eliot. His letters offered her a glimpse of a brilliant literary society of writers and poets whose work she revered. In 1874 she returned to Cambridge and married him on 18 August, making sure she retained control over her own finances. Her letters to her mother and sisters are coruscating dispatches chronicling the peculiarities of life in an ancient university town in Victorian England.<br>
<br>In 1875 Richard Jebb accepted the chair of Greek at Glasgow University. They moved to Glasgow but continued to spend summers in Cambridge. Springfield, their comfortable home on the Backs, was the centre of much social and intellectual life, and they mixed with Balfours, Butchers, Tennysons, and Sidgwicks. She was adept at making social gatherings lively events; widely read and able to discourse on any subject, she also discovered that &#145;if the subject of <i>sex</i> was introduced at a dinner table every one became interested at once&#146;  (Marshall, 47). Cambridge was gradually changing, as women students arrived at Newnham and Girton in greater numbers and college fellows were permitted to marry. She frequently took on the role of match-maker, introducing her American niece Maud Du Puy to George Darwin; they married and settled in Cambridge in 1884, and their daughter Gwen was born a year later.<br>
<br>Following Richard's appointment, in 1889, as regius professor of Greek at Cambridge the Jebbs lived permanently in Cambridge, at the centre of a close academic community. Caroline's niece Gwen Raverat's memoir drolly depicts &#145;Aunt Cara&#146; during this period as a socially dominant figure, astutely managing her own and others' investments and &#145;emphatically a man's woman&#146;  (Raverat, 90). Much as she liked men and her power over them, Caroline was also an active member of the Ladies' Dining Society, an &eacute;lite group of twelve influential women who were close friends and met regularly from 1890 to 1914 for intelligent debate. She was a committee member and vice-president of the Cambridge Association for Women's Suffrage from 1893 to 1912.<br>
<br>In 1891 Richard Jebb, standing as a Conservative, became the university's member of parliament, giving Caroline the chance to escape from Cambridge occasionally and have refreshing contact with &#145;nimble London wits and tongues&#146; such as Richard Haldane, John Lubbock, and Arthur Balfour  (Bobbitt, 240). In 1900 Richard was knighted and, as Lady Jebb, Caroline demonstrated to her niece Eglantyne Jebb how connections came in useful when raising money for charitable causes.<br>
<br>Richard died in 1905 and Caroline Jebb's <span class="italic">Life and Letters of Sir Richard Claverhouse Jebb</span> was published two years later: as a biography it is respectful, a little heavy, but stylishly written and peppered with her characteristically dry observations. Her personal letters contain the best examples of her analytical skills, however, with memorable insights into the poets, writers, and politicians she met. She was particularly adept at skewering Victorian foibles and fads, and has been called &#145;that cool American observer&#146;  (Thwaite, 461).<br>
<br>In 1917 Caroline Jebb moved back to America. She died at her niece Mary Spencer's home, 519 West Sixth Street, Erie, Pennsylvania, on 11 July 1930, and her ashes were brought back to Cambridge and buried in St Giles' cemetery (later Ascension Parish burial ground) under the tombstone of her husband.<br>
