<span class="headword">Lane <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Borrow]</span>,  Sarah</span>  (1822/3&#150;1899), <span class="occ">actress, playwright, and theatre manager</span>, was born in the neighbourhood of Clerkenwell, London, the daughter of William Borrow, cab proprietor, and of Sarah Fowles. She made her d&eacute;but at sixteen, as a singer at the Ironmonger-Row Saloon in Clerkenwell. She is also reported to have performed at the Bedford Saloon in Camden Town. For most of her life she was identified with the Britannia Theatre in Hoxton, where she progressed from a player in a saloon to the actress, manager, and playwright known as the Queen of the Brit.<br>
<br>In 1841 Samuel Haycraft Lane had opened the Britannia Saloon, where Sarah, under the name Sara Wilton, was engaged as a singer and actress in or about 1843. Following the death of Samuel Lane's first wife, he and Sarah married, probably in 1846; they had no children. During the following thirty years the Lanes built the Britannia into a large and increasingly &#145;respectable&#146; venue. The saloon early on had something of an unsavoury reputation: a police report from 1844 insists that &#145;there can be no doubt that this place is calculated to corrupt the morals of the growing youth in that low and thickly populated neighbourhood&#146;  (TNA: PRO, LC 7/6). The saloon become a theatre in 1858, when it reopened in much-expanded and lavishly redecorated form, with a seating capacity of over 3000 and a reputation for good catering. During this time Sarah Lane became an enormously popular performer, known for saucy comic and melodramatic heroines. The <span class="italic">Touchstone</span> reported that Lane was &#145;chiefly remarkable for the wonderful versatility of her powers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Touchstone, or, The New Era</span>, 22 June 1878); <span class="italic">The Era</span> observed that &#145;a collection of the pungent and sparkling figurative sayings which this lady is accustomed to utter in her different characters could make a considerably large and amusing book of proverbs, emblems, and repartees&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Era</span>). Lane's particular speciality was the feisty female who battled the villain, stepped out of her place, and wrought the happy ending. Typical is the role of Florence Langton in C. H. Hazlewood's <span class="italic">Mother's Dying Child</span>, 1864, who, repeatedly insisting &#145;my natural curiosity must be satisfied&#146;, adopts no fewer than four identities as she pursues the villain who threatens her family.<br>
<br>The Lanes were quite prosperous by the 1860s, and spent a good deal of time and money yachting, travelling (during the summer months), and shopping. Sam Lane died in 1871; upon his death Sarah became the lessee of the Britannia Theatre, a position she held until her death in 1899. In running the theatre, Lane occasionally came into conflict with her nephew, A. L. Crauford, who replaced her as manager of the Britannia in 1882. In addition to acting and to managing the theatre, Lane also became a playwright&#151;she wrote eight plays for the Britannia between 1873 and 1881, usually adaptations from the French. By the mid-1880s she had ceased to be a regular performer at the Britannia, but she did continue to appear in the annual pantomime and in the Britannia Festival that closed the season in December. At the festival&#151;unique to the Britannia&#151;the members of the company would each appear in his or her most popular role of the season, and Sarah Lane would distribute gifts and be strewn with flowers. She made her last appearance at the Britannia during the annual festival performance in 1898. The pantomime remained to the end a great draw, attracting attention from West End critics such as George Bernard Shaw, who favourably compared the wit and wholesomeness of the Brit's pantomime to what he saw as the cynicism and lewdness of the &#145;expensively dreary&#146; productions of the West End  (<span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>, 9 April 1898).<br>
<br>In her later years Lane was much venerated in the Hoxton community, which had grown progressively poorer in the last decades of the century; she, by contrast, left a substantial personal estate. She died of dropsy, aged seventy-six, at 81 Finchley Road, London, on 16 August 1899, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
