<span class="headword">Chaikin,  Moses Avigdor</span>  (1852&#150;1928), <span class="occ">rabbi</span>, was born in Shklov, in Mohilev province, Belorussia, then in the Russian empire, on 11 May 1852, the son of Rabbi Israel Shraga Chaikin and his wife, Chaya Dina. His parents were Hasidic Jews, adherents of the Lubavitch sect. Chaikin's father was appointed <i>shochet</i> (ritual slaughterman) to the Jewish community of St Petersburg, where Moses Chaikin began his religious education. He then studied at <i>yeshivot</i> (Talmudic colleges) in Volkovysk under Rabbi Abraham Samuel Diskin, who bestowed on him the first of several <i>semichot</i> (rabbinical ordinations) in 1877, and in Kovno under the renowned Rabbi Isaac Elhanan Spektor. He also gained <i>semichot</i> from rabbis Yekutiel Salmon Landau and Isaac Woolf Olschwanger of St Petersburg as well as from Rabbi Jacob Vidrevitz of Moscow.<br>
<br>Some time during 1882&#150;4, in the aftermath of the pogroms that followed the assassination of Tsar Alexander II, Chaikin went to Paris, where he became rabbi of the Russian and Polish Jews in the city and in 1887 established a Talmud Torah (traditional Jewish high school). He returned to Russia as rabbi of Rostov-on-Don, but was expelled in 1890 for reasons that are unclear. He emigrated to England to serve the Jewish community of Sheffield (1892&#150;1901), as minister and <i>shochet</i> to the New Hebrew Congregation at West Bar, which largely consisted of new immigrants like himself. This was a breakaway from the old established synagogue at North Church Street, and Chaikin tried his utmost to unite the feuding community. He established a Talmud Torah and Sabbath Observance Society in Sheffield.<br>
<br>In July 1901 Rabbi Chaikin was selected to fill the post of chief minister of the Federation of Synagogues, which had been vacant since the departure of Rabbi Meyer Lerner in 1894, and he moved to London. Between 1902 and 1906 he was, with reluctance, permitted to participate in the work of the chief rabbi's <i>bet din</i> (ecclesiastical court). However, the title of <i>dayan</i> (judge) was withheld from him until 1911. This was on account of rivalry between the federation and the establishment United Synagogue which was under the chief rabbi's jurisdiction. Hermann Adler, the chief rabbi, was for a long time loath to appoint rabbis trained in eastern Europe to his court, which he preferred to maintain as a preserve of the &#145;native Anglo-Jewish ministry&#146;&#151;consisting of English-educated &#145;reverend gentlemen&#146;, not rabbis. This attitude was endorsed by the lay leaders of the United Synagogue, principally Lord Rothschild, but was increasingly resented by the Yiddish-speaking Jewish immigrants of east London, many of whom were members of synagogues of the Federation of Synagogues. In 1906 Chaikin's services were withdrawn from the <i>bet din</i> on the insistence of Samuel Montagu, president of the federation. Following Montagu's death, however, Chaikin served on the United Synagogue <i>bet din</i> from the end of 1911 until his retirement in August 1926.<br>
<br>Chaikin married, probably in Russia, Tony Rebecca Pinsker (1851&#150;1923), a daughter of Rabbi Solomon Pinsker, <i>av bet din</i> (senior judge of the Jewish ecclesiastical court) of Kherson, who had also studied Latin and medicine at St Petersburg. A descendant of the seventeenth-century scholar Rabbi Yom Tov Lipmann Heller, Mrs Chaikin inherited a &#145;brilliant intellect&#146; and was learned in rabbinics in her own right. The couple had two known children: a son, George, and a daughter. Mrs Chaikin died on 10 January 1923 and was buried the following day at the Federation Jewish cemetery, Edmonton.<br>
<br>Chaikin was a quiet, scholarly man who lacked the charisma of his fellow Hasidic contemporary in the East End Rabbi Chaim Zundel Maccoby. He made his home at 47 White Lion Street, Aldgate, in the heart of the Jewish East End, and he worshipped, preached, and taught at the Old Castle Street <i>shtiebl</i> (Hasidic conventicle), known as Agudat Achim (&#145;Society of brothers&#146;). He published studies of biblical commentaries and compendia of rabbinical <i>responsa</i> in Hebrew. He also wrote in French and English on general Jewish history, including <span class="italic">Apologie des Juifs</span> (1887), and a work of biographical sketches entitled <span class="italic">The Celebrities of the Jews</span> (1899). In 1926 Chaikin retired to join his daughter's family in Tel Aviv, where he died on 17 June 1928.<br>
