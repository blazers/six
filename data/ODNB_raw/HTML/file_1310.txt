<span class="headword">Bannatyne,  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1605), <span class="occ">secretary to John Knox</span>, may have originated in western Scotland, for his brother James was a merchant in Ayr around the time of Richard's death. There is no evidence to support suggestions that he belonged to the same family as his contemporary George Bannatyne, the collector of Scottish poetry. Richard Bannatyne became secretary to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15781/', "John Knox")</script>, attracted to the latter's service primarily out of admiration for his integrity and ministry, not for &#145;worldlie commoditie&#146;  (Bannatyne, 94). He appeared frequently in the kirk's general assembly, and prior to the earl of Moray's assassination, on 21 January 1570, he twice carried messages from Knox to the countess, urging her to advise Moray not to return from Stirling to Edinburgh via Linlithgow (where his killer was waiting). When Knox was attacked in an anonymous handbill for his criticism of Queen Mary in 1571, Bannatyne, on his own initiative, attempted (unsuccessfully) to persuade the general assembly formally to endorse Knox's position, and was &#145;not a litill in choler that his just desyre was refuised&#146;  (Bannatyne, 95). When Knox went to St Andrews in July 1571, Bannatyne lived in the priory with him and his family. As a student at St Leonard's College, James Melville watched Bannatyne help the frail Knox to the church and into the pulpit each day. By now in failing health, Knox asked his wife and Bannatyne to read to him from <span class="roman">John</span> 17, <span class="roman">Isaiah</span> 53, a chapter of <span class="roman">Ephesians</span>, the <span class="roman">Psalms</span>, and Calvin's sermons in French. Three days after he had instructed Bannatyne to have his coffin made, the reformer died, on 24 November 1572, with his secretary at his side. Knox left the care of his wife and three small daughters to Bannatyne, asking that he &#145;be a husband, in my rowme&#146;  (Bannatyne, 288).<br>
<br>After Knox's death, Bannatyne petitioned the general assembly for financial assistance to enable him to preserve the reformer's manuscripts. In addition to giving him &pound;40, the assembly instructed the Edinburgh church to appoint several scholars to assist him. It has been suggested that Bannatyne composed the fifth part of the <span class="italic">History of the Reformation within the Realm of Scotland</span>, covering the period 1564&#150;7, possibly using Knox's notes, but this is doubtful. The two men's literary interdependence is more probably manifested in Bannatyne's <span class="italic">Memoriales of Transactions in Scotland</span>, covering the years 1569&#150;73.<br>
<br>Having completed his work for the general assembly about 1575, Bannatyne became a clerk for the advocate Samuel Cockburn of Tempill, or Tempillhall. In that capacity Bannatyne almost certainly had contacts with his employer's relatives, Sir Robert Cockburn, lord privy seal, and Sir John Cockburn, lord justice clerk. In 1575 he published Henry Balnaves's treatise on justification by faith (written in 1548, and then revised with Knox's assistance), which he had found in Lady Alison Sandilands's papers. Bannatyne served Samuel Cockburn for nearly three decades, during which time he continued his ties with the Knox family. Bannatyne's will, dated 27 August 1605, appointed his brother James as joint executor along with Cockburn; his possessions were worth &pound;1181 Scots. Bannatyne died on 4 September 1605. His importance derives primarily from his <span class="italic">Memoriales</span>, which presents Knox, the &#145;light of Scotland&#146;, in a flattering manner. The view that Knox was strongly anti-episcopalian, which some modern scholars have challenged, was shaped in part by Bannatyne and by David Calderwood, who relied extensively on the <span class="italic">Memoriales</span>. Although the <span class="italic">Memoriales</span> became an invaluable source, Bannatyne is sometimes vague or unreliable, as in his exaggerated claim that the king's forces exceeded 4000 when the siege of Edinburgh commenced in October 1571. Bannatyne's discovery and publication of Balnaves's influential treatise, with its proclamation of the religious character of ordinary occupations, its stress on the separation of the spiritual from the temporal office, and the limitations it urged for the prince's power over the church, likewise constituted an important service to the Scottish Reformation in its formative period.<br>
