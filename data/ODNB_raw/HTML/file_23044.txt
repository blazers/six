<span class="headword">Ralfs,  John</span>  (1807&#150;1890), <span class="occ">surgeon and botanist</span>, was born at Hill House, Millbrook, near Southampton, on 13 September 1807, the second son of Samuel Ralfs (<i>d</i>. 1808), yeoman, and his wife, Mary. Following the death of his father from typhus, John, his brother, and two sisters were brought up at Southampton by their mother.<br>
<br>Ralfs was educated at private schools in Southampton, Bishop's Waltham, and Romsey; he was then articled to his uncle, a Brentford surgeon, with whom he lived for two and a half years. He was also a student under Dr Lyford at Winchester Hospital, before further study at Guy's Hospital, London. His studies at Guy's were interrupted by typhus and it was not until 1832 that he passed the MRCS examination (specially commended for his botany). After a year as assistant at a practice in Towcester, Northamptonshire, he spent about two years in partnership with another surgeon at Shoreditch in London. In 1835 health problems (probably a tubercular lung infection) forced Ralfs to move to Torquay, where in the same year he married Laura Cecilia (<i>d</i>. 1848), daughter of Henry Newman of London. Although a son, John Henry, was born in 1836, the marriage failed within two years; Laura took her son and returned to her parents in France. No longer practising his profession, and very frail, Ralfs settled in Penzance in November 1837. As his health gradually improved he increasingly returned to his schoolboy love of botany.<br>
<br>In 1839 Ralfs published his <span class="italic">British Phaenogamous Plants and Ferns</span>. By the early 1840s a fascination with the smaller freshwater algae during field forays on Dartmoor led to the idea for a work on British Desmidieae. At about the same time, Arthur Hill Hassall was also planning a work on British freshwater algae. From extant correspondence it is clear that Hassall and Ralfs were fully aware of each other's intent to publish from before 1844. Later reports suggest Ralfs initially believed the works complemented each other and suggested co-operation. However, later correspondence (from 1844 onwards) indicates that Ralfs came to the decision personally to publish his original data before it could be used elsewhere. This may have been in part due to Hassall's demands for data, drawings, and other assistance from many contemporaries (including Ralfs and Jenner), which were on the grounds of priority of intent. Hassall's work, <span class="italic">A History of British Freshwater Algae</span>, was published in 1845. Ralfs's <span class="italic">The British Desmidieae</span> did not appear until 1848, yet eighteen months before publication Ralfs already had a subscription list greater than 220 names, with many of the subscribers requiring more than a single copy. A restricted print run (500, according to Marquand) has subsequently made the work, in its time considered unsurpassed for the beauty and accuracy of its plates, both rare and costly. German scientists bought many copies.<br>
<br>Comparisons between Ralfs's and Hassall's works, and approach to the subject, were inevitable. Ralfs is among those pioneers usually considered as founders of the critical approach to freshwater algology, Hassall as an acquisitive compiler, whose intent was to permit the leisured &#145;amateur&#146; Victorian microscopist to identify his finds. Both contemporaries and later workers have tended to assess Hassall's algal work as largely second-hand and often careless, Ralfs's as both careful and original. Typical contemporary comment, in a letter of 9 October 1851 from David Landsborough I to Mrs Gatty (Sheffield City Library) is: &#145;Ralfs wrote an excellent book with exquisite plates, on the <i>Desmidieae</i> which I have. It is much more to be depended on than Hassall's which Arnott says is a bad book full of errors.&#146;<br>
<br>Before publication of <span class="italic">The British Desmidieae</span> Ralfs's first paper, &#145;Desmids and diatoms&#146;, was read by the Revd M. J. Berkeley before the Edinburgh Botanical Society, in whose <span class="italic">Transactions</span> Ralfs's papers appeared over many years. He also published in the <span class="italic">Annals of Natural History</span>, in <span class="italic">The Phytologist</span> (1842), and in the <span class="italic">Report and Transactions of the Penzance Natural History and Antiquarian Society</span> (1851&#150;1884?), the latter papers mostly about Cornish marine macroalgae.<br>
<br>In addition to his own works, Ralfs contributed strongly to the data provided (from 1838) by Amelia Warren Griffiths for the botanical texts in editions of Banfield's <span class="italic">A Guide to Ilfracombe</span> (retitled <span class="italic">A Guide to North Devon</span> from <i>c</i>.1850) and <span class="italic">The North Devon Handbook</span> (1857; 1860; 1877) of Tugwell and Stewart. Ralfs was also involved in writing botanical text for Courtney's <span class="italic">A Guide to Penzance</span> (1845), Besley's <span class="italic">The Hand-Book of Western Cornwall</span> (1873?; 1880?), J. T. Blight's <span class="italic">A Week at the Land's End</span> (1861; 1876; 1893; 1973), and <span class="italic">The Official Guide to Penzance</span> (1876; 1888). He contributed a desmid list for <span class="italic">The Flora of Tunbridge Wells</span> by Edward Jenner (who had drawn the illustrations for Ralfs's 1848 book). He also provided specimens which assisted in the production of academic works such as Sowerby's second edition of Smith's <span class="italic">English Botany</span> (the cryptogams described therein by Berkeley and Wilson were amplified by specimens sent by Ralfs) and Darwin's <span class="italic">Insectivorous Plants</span>. Andrew Pritchard's <span class="italic">History of Infusoria</span> was revised and enlarged (4th edn, 1861) by botanists including Ralfs, whose Diatomaceae section  (pp. 756&#150;940) was condensed by Pritchard (Ralfs, through illness, could neither further revise the Diatomaceae nor provide the desmid sections, as originally agreed).<br>
<br>In 1850 Ralfs visited the Dordogne ch&acirc;teau of Count Morambert (where his wife had died in 1848), during a six-month visit to France. He also then visited many French botanists, in Paris, Falaise, Caen, and Vire. However, letters from Lenormand and de Br&eacute;bisson to the Revd M. J. Berkeley in 1851 suggest Ralfs proved no real correspondent following his return to England&#151;possibly owing to continued ill health.<br>
<br>Through the misconduct of a trusted relative, it is said, Ralfs lost most of his &#145;moderate competency&#146;  (Marquand). In 1858 J. D. Hooker and T. H. Huxley initiated a charitable subscription fund to provide Ralfs with a small annuity. The fund, under the auspices of the Philosophical Society, was vastly oversubscribed and, in addition to providing Ralfs an annuity, formed the basis of a second fund for general &#145;relief of necessitas Scientific Men&#146;. An additional legacy from Ralfs's friend the Revd Henry Penneck (<i>d</i>. 1862) also provided some financial relief. Despite poor health and failing eyesight from the early 1850s onwards, Ralfs remained active in botanical research until he was at least seventy-five. For many years a committee member of the Penzance (Morrab Gardens) Library, he catalogued its books, did much of the buying of natural history stock, and prepared its printed catalogue. The library subsequently obtained Ralfs's unpublished manuscripts for his <span class="italic">Flora of West Cornwall</span> (8 vols., 1878&#150;86), <span class="italic">Flora of the Scilly Isles</span> (1876), and <span class="italic">Fungi of West Cornwall</span> (2 vols., 1880&#150;86).<br>
<br>In his final years Ralfs lived at 13 Clare Street, Penzance, in a house owned by a Miss Quick who cared well for him. He died there on 14 July 1890, and was buried in the local cemetery. A monument was erected to his memory by the Penzance Natural History and Antiquarian Society, of which he had been both vice-president and president (1883&#150;4). He had been elected honorary fellow of the Royal Microscopical Society (1889) and, much earlier, had been proposed for (but had declined) associateship of the Linnean Society. His name is commemorated in taxa at many levels and in many plant groups.<br>
