<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pitt,  Thomas</span>  (1653&#150;1726), <span class="occ">merchant and politician</span>, was born at Blandford, Dorset, on 5 July 1653, the second son of John Pitt (<i>d</i>. 1672), the local rector, and his wife, Sarah, the daughter of John Jay of West Hemsworth, Witchampton, Dorset. His early trading career remains obscure, but in 1673 he sailed to India and jumped ship at Balasore to set himself up as an interloping merchant in defiance of the East India Company, which held a monopoly of commerce in that area. In 1675 orders were issued for him to be seized and taken back to England, but, despite promises to submit, he continued to trade independently, protected by company servants such as Matthias Vincent and Richard Edwards. He dealt in sugar and horses and made several trips to Persia; his success can be gauged by the persistence with which the company harassed him. By October 1679 he had married Jane (<i>c</i>.1661&#150;1727), the daughter of James Innes of Reid Hall, Moray, and a relation of his patrons Vincent and Edwards; they had four sons, including the politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22334/', "Thomas Pitt")</script>, and two daughters.<br>
<br>When Pitt returned to England in the autumn of 1681 proceedings were initiated in chancery to keep him in the country, but to no avail, for he soon set sail again for India, obliging the company to issue further orders to apprehend the &#145;desperate fellow&#146; whom they lambasted for a &#145;haughty, huffying, daring temper&#146;  (Dalton, 29&#150;30). During this trip Pitt managed to obtain permission from the nawab of Bengal to establish a factory on the Hooghly, but on his return to England in 1683 he was arrested and bound over for &pound;40,000. Four years later the company fined Pitt &pound;1000, but the penalty was later reduced to only &pound;400. Further reconciliation occurred in 1688, when he was made free of the company without having to pay an entry fine, and the following year he held &pound;300 of its stock. Taking advantage of an enforced residence at home, he ploughed his profits into buying land in his native Dorset, where at a later date he indulged his passion for planting. Furthermore, these purchases facilitated his successful return as MP for Old Sarum in 1689. However, his election was declared void, and he had to fight a by-election at Salisbury the following May to regain a seat in the house. He predictably used the Commons as a platform from which to harangue the East India Company, and showed whiggish allegiance by supporting the disabling clause in the <span class="roman">Corporation Bill</span>. In 1690 he gained another success at Salisbury, and in the early sessions of the parliament spearheaded the increasingly organized attack of the East Indian interlopers. He also proved critical of the government, testifying in November 1692 to the severe losses sustained by English merchants in the war and demanding the removal of foreigners from royal counsels.<br>
<br>Pitt's parliamentary duties did not prevent him from undertaking another journey to India in 1693, which turned out to be his last interloping trip. Yet more futile attempts were made to stop him, but the company was eventually forced to bring him into the fold. He appears to have accepted their overtures readily, and acted in their interest on his return to England in 1695&#150;6. He was still keen to pursue a parliamentary career, being returned in 1695 for Old Sarum. In the first session he signed the association in protest at the plot to assassinate the king, but opposed the ministry over the attainder of the conspirator Sir John Fenwick. However, he again deserted his Westminster post in order to accept appointment as president of the Coromandel Coast and governor of Fort St George at Madras. The failure of eighteen committee men to regain their places at the ensuing company elections highlighted his unpopularity with the stockholders, and he never won over company luminaries such as Sir Josiah Child, who regarded Pitt as &#145;that roughing, immoral man&#146;  (Dalton, 110).<br>
<br>Pitt's early months in office were very fraught, and the creation of the New East India Company in September 1698 brought further uncertainties. Nevertheless, he proved a stubborn foe of the former interlopers, and was even prepared to obstruct his own cousin John Pitt, the new company's representative in his jurisdiction. Only the union of the two companies in 1702 would bring about reconciliation, and, although he later expressed grave reservations about the wisdom of such a move, Pitt was prepared to work with his former rivals. Such an accommodation was clearly advanced by the old company's recent struggle with the nawab of the Carnatic, who had blockaded Fort St George for three months. Showing great resourcefulness and an inbred ability for bold diplomacy, Pitt was able not only to raise the siege but also to obtain damages from the nawab. The following year his original term of office was extended in recognition of his achievements as president, which included the introduction of new exports, improved fortifications at Madras, and a continuing rise in the factory's revenues. However, lingering tensions between the companies continued to undermine his position, and concern for the management of his estate back home caused him endless worries. His anxieties led to a rift with his wife, and as early as September 1704 he was planning a return home. Gossipmongers in Madras and London took full advantage of his difficulties, most notably in 1705&#150;6, when controversy raged over the bills of exchange he demanded to cover debts incurred by the new company's operations in Masulipatam. Having vindicated himself on this account, he then clashed with a member of the ruling council at Madras, William Fraser, whom he suspected of fomenting a dispute between local castes. He eventually decided to suspend Fraser, but when the matter was referred to the company in England the ruling court decided to dismiss Pitt and reinstate Fraser, news of which reached Madras in September 1709. This coup was made possible only by the incapacitating illness suffered by Pitt's great ally Sir Thomas Cooke, which deprived him of support at home. Pitt accepted his fate and made speedy preparations to leave India, but remained characteristically defiant to the end, challenging any &#145;to charge me with any one act of injustice during my government&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fortescue MSS</span>, 1.43&#150;4).<br>
<br>A most significant factor in Pitt's decision to return home was his concern for the &#145;Regent&#146; diamond, &#145;the unparalleled jewel of the world&#146; which he had bought from a native merchant about March 1702  (<span class="italic">Fortescue MSS</span>, 1.32). In its uncut form the diamond weighed 410 carats, and after much haggling Pitt had bought it for &pound;20,400, only just over a quarter of the original asking price. The diamond was sent in 1702 to England, where at a cost of &pound;5000 it was reduced to 140.5 carats, the dust and cleavage worth some &pound;5000 to &pound;7000 on its own. The tortuous process of finding a purchaser often drove Pitt to distraction, but war in Europe effectively closed the market for such a fabulous item, and it was still unsold when he left India in October 1709. Instead of returning straight home, he diverted his journey to Bergen in Norway, where he resided for nearly a year. During his stay he wrote a memorial defending his ownership of the diamond, motivated by reports that he had obtained it illegally. His funeral sermon would return to this theme, but still the rumours persisted, with Pope questioning the governor's honesty in his <span class="italic">Epistle to Bathurst</span>. After many anxious years the diamond was finally sold in 1717 to the regent of France for &pound;125,000, thanks to the agency of the financier John Law. It was incorporated in the French crown and later worn by Marie Antoinette, but in 1791 was auctioned by the revolutionary government for six times its purchase price. Although stolen before it could be sold, it was soon recovered, and was later transferred to the sword of Napoleon I. It has since remained in the possession of the state, and is normally displayed at the Louvre, Paris.<br>
<br>Pitt returned to England in 1710 and resumed his parliamentary career, having secured election for Old Sarum that year. The new ministry had been forewarned to enlist his services as a politician who &#145;will have a powerful purse in England and be a thorn in the side of some great men now at the head of the Bank and India Company&#146;  (<span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 4.594), and in the session of 1710&#150;11 Pitt duly backed the tory administration in the Commons and the City. He stood unsuccessfully at the East India Company elections of 1711, but was appointed to the commission to build fifty new churches in London and its environs. However, by late 1711 he had reverted to whig ranks, and in June 1713 he voted against the government in the key division on the French commerce treaty. At the ensuing general election he was defeated when contesting Wiltshire, but was again returned for the pocket borough of Old Sarum. He remained a whig and warmly welcomed the Hanoverian succession, having in April 1714 broadcast his fears of French aggrandizement in the wake of the treaty of Utrecht.<br>
<br>Pitt gained another victory at Old Sarum in 1715, and, expressing abhorrence of the Jacobite rebellion, helped to mobilize armed resistance in Dorset. The following year he somewhat surprisingly undertook the governorship of Jamaica, for which he forfeited his seat in the house. However, owing to disputes over his conditions of service, and perhaps in anticipation of a difficult posting, he never took up his appointment, and was able to return to Westminster via a by-election at Thirsk. He now proved an enemy of the ministry led by his son-in-law James Stanhope, opposing several government measures in 1719&#150;20 and leading the campaign to punish those responsible for the South Sea Bubble, which he later claimed to have caused him &#145;very great losses&#146;  (Dalton, 557). At the next general election he resumed his seat at Old Sarum, which, despite declining vigour, he held until his death, &#145;from a mixture of apoplexy and palsy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fortescue MSS</span>, 1.76), at Swallowfield, Berkshire, on 28 April 1726.<br>
<br>Pitt left a vast fortune, including properties in Westminster, Dorset, Cornwall, Wiltshire, Hampshire, and Berkshire. Most of his lands devolved to his eldest son, Robert, &#145;the bane of my family&#146;, whom he had mercilessly castigated for many years for personal failings and the mismanagement of the Pitt estate  (<span class="italic">Fortescue MSS</span>, 1.59). Relations between them had improved, but Pitt remained estranged from his wife, having never completely forgiven her for &#145;the hellish confusion&#146; into which his family had fallen during his absence in India  (ibid., 1.21&#150;2). However, the governor could take pride at the success of his other offspring, his second son, Thomas, having been created Lord Londonderry, his third son, John, having gained military honours, and his daughter Lucy having married James Stanhope, a war hero and leading minister under George I. However, it was his grandson <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22337/', "William Pitt (1708&#150;1778)")</script>, described by his doting grandfather as &#145;a hopeful lad&#146;, who added greatest lustre to the family name by becoming prime minister and Lord Chatham  (ibid., 1.73).<br>
<br>Pitt often cut a controversial figure, in large part as a result of his uncompromising way of doing business, and historians have also labelled him greedy and miserly. There is no doubting his toughness as a businessman, and his family could amply testify to his hardness as a taskmaster. On the other hand, his patriotism and commitment to public service cannot be questioned, and he was far from being a creature of the parties which dominated Westminster at that time. His advice to his son concerning conduct in the Commons is particularly illuminating:<blockquote>show yourself on all occasions a good Englishman and a faithful servant to your country. Avoid faction and never enter the House prepossessed, but attend diligently to the debate and vote according to your conscience, and not for any sinister end whatever. (Dalton, 70)</blockquote>He could be most charitable to relations and friends, and proved himself an active local patron, restoring several churches, including that of his native parish of Blandford St Mary, where his body was laid to rest on 21 May 1726. Plain-speaking, resourceful, loyal, and determined, he was at his best when forging a niche for English traders in India, where his activities earned him fame as &#145;Diamond&#146; or Governor Pitt, but these qualities were not fashioned to win him popularity among contemporaries or the approval of later generations.<br>
