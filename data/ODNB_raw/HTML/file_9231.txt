<span class="headword">Fawkes,  Walter Ramsden Hawkesworth</span>  (1769&#150;1825), <span class="occ">politician and art collector</span>, was born Walter Ramsden Hawkesworth at Hawkesworth Hall, near Guiseley, Yorkshire, on 2 March 1769, the eldest son of Walter Ramsden Beaumont Hawkesworth (1746&#150;1792) and his wife, Amelia Farrer. His father assumed the additional surname Fawkes when he inherited Farnley Hall near Otley, with 15,000 acres, in 1786, and the son in turn inherited in 1792, also assuming the surname Fawkes. In addition to the Farnley estates he kept a London house in Grosvenor Place.<br>
<br>Fawkes attended Westminster School (1781&#150;6) and Trinity College, Cambridge (1786), but did not graduate. At Westminster he had been a schoolfriend of Francis Burdett, later the radical reformer, an influence that had lifelong effect. He put himself forward as an independent MP for Yorkshire against the tory Henry Lascelles in 1796, but withdrew because his fortune was no match for Lascelles's. He also stood in 1802, and, having joined the whigs, once again in 1806 when he was successful as an anti-slavery candidate, sharing a platform with William Wilberforce. The election campaign cost Fawkes dear, and he did not stand again.<br>
<br>Outside parliament Fawkes spoke eloquently as an advocate for reform. He was the first chairman of the Hampden Club (1812), and in 1812 addressed the tenth anniversary meeting of Burdett's election to parliament. He spoke in Yorkshire against income tax (1816) and the Peterloo massacre (1819), and promoted a petition for reform which attracted 17,000 signatures in Yorkshire in 1823, the year he was high sheriff of the county. Fawkes was a trenchant political writer, publishing his <span class="italic">Chronology of the History of Modern Europe</span> in 1810 and <span class="italic">The Englishman's Manual, or, A Dialogue between a Tory and a Reformer</span> in 1817.<br>
<br>One of Fawkes's closest friends was the painter J. M. W. Turner, whom he first met in the late 1790s. Turner's many regular visits to Farnley began about 1808, but by that time Fawkes had already become an extensive collector of Turner's work. The friendship between politician and painter flourished on a basis of mutual generosity, trust, and common pursuits, such as an interest in reforming politics and a fascination with the pattern of the landscape.<br>
<br>On 28 August 1794 Fawkes married Maria Grimston (1774/5&#150;1813); they had four sons and seven daughters. He brought modern techniques to the management of his estates, promoting active co-operation between landowners and tenants. The series of gouaches which Turner made around Farnley depicts shooting parties, expeditions, and scenes of domestic calm (priv. coll.; National Galleries of Scotland, Edinburgh; Rhode Island Museum of Art, Providence, Rhode Island; studies in the Tate collection). With his friends and family Fawkes assembled the Farnley &#145;Ornithological collection&#146;&#151;five volumes of plumage specimens and watercolour studies of birds, some by Turner (priv. coll.; Leeds Art Gallery; Ashmolean Museum, Oxford; Tate collection). Fawkes's passion for natural history took further practical form in his introducing zebra, wild hogs, and deer onto the estates, and culminated in his writing a four-volume <span class="italic">Synopsis of Natural History</span> (1823).<br>
<br>In 1816 Fawkes married Maria Sophia Vernon, formerly Mrs Pierce Butler (1786&#150;1847). During the early 1820s, as his fortune ebbed away through political, publishing, and collecting expenses and his expansive style of living, he slipped towards, but narrowly avoided, bankruptcy. His friendship with Turner, however, deepened in these years: Turner lent him money, and for his part Fawkes opened his large Turner collection at his London house to an eager public in spring 1819. In the exhibition catalogue, Fawkes summed up his feelings for Turner, writing of the &#145;delight I have experienced, during the greater part of my life, from the exercise of your talent and the pleasure of your society&#146;  (W. R. H. Fawkes, &#145;Introduction&#146;, <span class="italic">A Collection of Water Colour Drawings in the Possession of W. F.</span> 1819). Fawkes died at his London home in Baker Street, Portman Square, on 24 October 1825, and was buried on 8 November at All Saints, Otley, where there is a memorial. The bulk of his papers was destroyed by his heirs.<br>
<br>The reformer Francis Place called Fawkes &#145;a man of weight and character&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 27850, fol. 255), and the painter Thomas Uwins saw him as &#145;a man of good sense, with a long purse and a noble soul&#146;  (S. Uwins, <span class="italic">Memoir of Thomas Uwins</span>, 1858, 2.225&#150;6).<br>
