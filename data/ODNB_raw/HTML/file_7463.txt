<span class="headword">Deloney,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1600), <span class="occ">silkweaver and writer</span>, is thought to have been born in Norwich; his surname is of French origin, and Flemish and French protestant refugees had been settling in Norfolk in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, working in the cloth trades. In addition, the first known ballad by Deloney was published in Norwich. There is, however, no clear evidence to confirm his place of birth. Deloney began publishing in the early 1580s and may well have been born any time between about 1540 and 1560. He evidently received a grammar school education, given that he published translations from Latin. He may also have translated Bonaventure Des P&eacute;riers's <span class="italic">Les contes ou les nouvelles r&eacute;cr&eacute;ations et joyeux devis</span>; the English version, <span class="italic">The Mirror of Mirth and Pleasant Conceits</span>, is signed T. D.  (<span class="italic">Novels</span>, xxiv). Deloney's trade was silkweaving, although it is not certain where he practised it. In October 1586 he was living in London, as the baptism of his son Richard at St Giles Cripplegate indicates.<br>
<br>By the early 1590s Deloney was famous for his ballads; Thomas Nashe, in <span class="italic">Have with You to Saffron Walden</span> (1596), describes him as &#145;<i>Thomas Deloney</i>, the Balleting Silk-weaver&#146; who:<blockquote>hath rime inough for all myracles, &amp; wit to make a <span class="italic">Garland of Good will</span> more than the premisses, with an Epistle of <span class="italic">Momus</span> and <span class="italic">Zoylus</span>; whereas his Muse, from the first peeping foorth, hath stood at Livery at an Ale-house wispe, never exceeding a penny a quart, day or night, and this deare yeare, together with the silencing of his looms, scarce that; he being constrained to betake him to carded Ale: whence it proceedeth that, since <span class="italic">Candlemas</span> or his Jigge of <span class="italic">John for the King</span>, not one merrie Dittie will come from him, but <span class="italic">The Thunder-bolt against Swearers, Repent, England, repent, &amp; The strange judgements of God</span>. (<span class="italic">Works of Thomas Nashe</span>, 3.84)</blockquote>
<span class="italic">The Garland of Good Will</span> was a popular collection of Deloney's ballads, entered in the Stationers' register in 1593 (like the rest of his works, early editions have been read out of existence and the earliest surviving is that of 1626). Many of Deloney's ballads consist of what might be called topical reportage, such as <span class="italic">The Queenes Visiting of the Campe at Tilsburie with her Entertainment there</span> of 1588, one of several ballads about incidents surrounding the Spanish Armada. As well as political news, he wrote about sensational events, as in <span class="italic">The lamentation of Mastr Pages wife of Plimmouth, who being enforced by her parents to wed him against her will, did most wickedly consent to his murther, for the love of George Strangwidge</span>. There is also a series of ballads on historical subjects (for example, Edward II, Edward III, Henry I, Henry II, and John).<br>
<br>In the 1590s Deloney became caught up in political protest by the London weavers, who believed that French and Dutch workers relocating in England were ignoring the rules of apprenticeship laid down by the Weavers' Company. The weavers wrote to the pastors of the French and Dutch churches in London in 1595, asking that their parishioners obey the rules, but the pastors had the weavers' three ringleaders (including Deloney) gaoled in Newgate. They were later released, after petitioning the lord chief justice (<span class="italic">Novels</span>, xxvii&#150;xxviii; Consitt, 146&#150;52). In 1596 the mayor of London objected to a ballad (now lost) in which Deloney complained of the scarcity of grain in England, giving rise to &#145;discontent&#146;  (<span class="italic">Novels</span>, xxviii). The mayor took into custody the publisher and printer of the ballad, but was apparently unable to apprehend Deloney.<br>
<br>It was during this time, in the late 1590s, that Deloney turned to the genre of prose fiction, producing four works between 1597 and 1600. While some of his ballads are powerful and many are of considerable historical interest, his fiction is a remarkable achievement, given the paucity of models for what was virtually a new genre. In 1597 he published <span class="italic">The Pleasant History of John Winchcomb, in his Younger Years called Jack of Newbury</span> (often referred to as <span class="italic">Jack of Newbury</span>). Deloney dedicated this work &#145;To all famous cloth workers in England&#146;, praising the &#145;long honoured trade of English Clothiers&#146;. The narrative is based on a historical figure and is set in the reign of Henry VIII. The rags to riches story follows the fortunes of Jack, who begins as an exemplary workman, marries his master's widow, and becomes master himself of a massive (for the times) weaving establishment. Reflecting the tension in the late 1590s between the increasing economic power of the merchant class and the lack of a defined social position for its members, Deloney's text is a mixture of archaic forms and social realism. Jack's achievements as a master weaver are capped by his response to a summons to arms from the king, when he is able to provide a more impressive contingent of men for the French campaign than many a powerful nobleman. Despite this, Jack does not want to change his social status (unlike the social climber Wolsey), but he is a ruler within his own world and his &#145;kingdom&#146; is, in some ways, more impressive and certainly more orderly than the king's. In chapter 2, in a set-piece description (in rhyming couplets for greater effect), the reader is shown Jack's workroom with its 200 looms, 100 carders, and 200 spinners, right through to the dye-house. The episodic tale consists mostly of events which prove just how superior a figure Jack is.<br>
<br>In his next work Deloney turned to a different trade: shoemaking. <span class="italic">The Gentle Craft</span> was published in two parts, probably in 1597 and 1598. The first part is dedicated to the shoemakers, the second to the Company of Cordwainers. Both narratives are more fragmented than <span class="italic">Jack of Newbury</span>, though the first part has the clear purpose of offering a mythologized ancestry for the &#145;gentle-craft&#146; of shoemaking, with the stories of St Hugh, sons of the king of Powys, and Crispin and Crispianus, sons of the king of Logria. The concluding episode in part 1 is an account of Simon Eyre, the shoemaker who became mayor of London. The second part of <span class="italic">The Gentle Craft</span> is something of a pot-pourri, held together by the theme, once again, of the glory and worthiness of shoemakers. Like in Deloney's other fiction, broad knockabout comedy is a feature, and there is a considerable amount of jest-book fare, including material centred on Long Meg of Westminster (legendary subject of other jest-books).<br>
<br>Symbolically, <span class="italic">Thomas of Reading, or, The Six Worthy Yeomen of the West</span> may be seen as Deloney's last work of fiction because it reveals a new, sombre side to his vision; it may well have been published before the second part of <span class="italic">The Gentle Craft</span>, but the exact date is unknown. In contrast to his other fiction, this narrative seems to question the exuberant success stories and benign association of aristocrats and tradesmen. In particular, the grim account of the murder of Thomas Cole (one of the worthy yeomen) for his money by a marauding host and hostess of an inn serves to question the prosperity that is so celebrated elsewhere in Deloney's work.<br>
<br>All four of Deloney's pieces of prose fiction proved to be extremely popular: <span class="italic">Jack of Newbury</span> had some sixteen editions by 1700, <span class="italic">The Gentle Craft</span>, part 1, at least thirteen, and <span class="italic">Thomas of Reading</span> eight. Further testimony to Deloney's popularity is found in 1599, when Thomas Dekker used the first part of <span class="italic">The Gentle Craft</span> as a source for his play <span class="italic">The Shoemaker's Holiday</span>. In 1598 Deloney's last published work was entered in the Stationers' register: <span class="italic">Canaan's Calamity, Jerusalem's Misery</span> (first extant edition, 1618), an ambitious poem on the destruction of Jerusalem derived from Josephus and from Nashe's <span class="italic">Christ's Tears over Jerusalem</span>. Deloney uses this theme to offer some sharp social commentary on contemporary England:<blockquote>
<div>Seeke not your neighbors lasting spoyle<br>
</div>
<div>By greedy sute in lawe.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Deloney's Works</span>, 459)</blockquote>The only detailed reference to Deloney's death is in Will Kemp's <span class="italic">Kemp's Nine Days' Wonder</span> (1600), which concludes with a prose comment headed: &#145;To the tune of Thomas Delonies Epitaph&#146;. Kemp describes Deloney as:<blockquote>the great Ballet-maker T. D., alias Tho. Deloney, Chronicler of the 6. yeomen of the west, Jack of Newbery, the Gentle-craft, and such like honest men, omitted by Stow, Hollinshead, Grafton, Hal, froysart, and the rest of those wel deserving writers; but I was given since to understand your late generall Tho. dyed poorely, as ye all must do, and was honestly buried. (Kemp, 21)</blockquote>The exact circumstances of Deloney's death are unknown and no will has been traced.<br>
