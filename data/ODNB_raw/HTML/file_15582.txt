<div class="para">
<span class="headword">King,  Peter</span>, first Baron King  (1669&#150;1734), <span class="occ">lord chancellor</span>, was born in Exeter, the son of Jerome King, a prosperous grocer and drysalter, and Anne, daughter of Peter Locke and first cousin of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16885/', "John Locke")</script>, the philosopher.<h2>
<a name="Originsandearlycareer16691701"></a>Origins and early career, 1669&#150;1701</h2>King was educated among the dissenters in Exeter, probably by Joseph Hallett (<i>bap</i>. 1620, <i>d</i>. 1689), who founded the dissenting academy there. Certainly he read deeply in theology and religious history, under the influence of the Exeter presbyterians, and he may have been intended for the nonconformist ministry. In 1691 he published anonymously <span class="italic">An Enquiry into the Constitution, Discipline, Unity &amp; Worship of the Primitive Church</span>, an intervention in the debates arising out of the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span> and the dissenters' desire for a full measure of comprehension, undertaken to show that in its organization and discipline the primitive church involved elements of presbyterianism as well as episcopacy. It attracted considerable attention, and continued to represent dissenting views into the early eighteenth century. A second part, dealing with the forms of worship of the early fathers, was completed within a few years, but was not published until 1713.<br>
<br>Such an early demonstration of learning and reasoned argument seems to have persuaded King's family that he should follow a legal career; he was admitted to the Middle Temple on 23 October 1694, and may have studied civil law at Leiden, although his name does not appear in the published list of students for the period. He was called to the bar on 3 June 1698, on the recommendation of Sir George Treby, lord chief justice, whom Locke had urged to befriend him. Locke subsequently became a second father to King, sending a constant stream of advice and providing him with an entr&eacute;e into his London circle of acquaintances, which included whig grandees, judges, Isaac Newton, and Somers, the lord chancellor. In return King carried out Locke's business in the capital, especially the management of his financial affairs. His practice on the western circuit and at Westminster expanded rapidly: the reports show that by 1702 he was appearing regularly as a junior in king's bench, both on behalf of private individuals and in pleas of the crown. He also benefited from the patronage of the Devon gentry, and in February 1701 he was brought into parliament for Bere Alston, a Devon borough partly controlled by Sir Francis Drake of Buckland Abbey, one of the leaders of the west country whigs. He arrived in parliament at a critical juncture, and Locke urged him to put attendance in the Commons before his practice on circuit, although at first, he recommended, he should prompt more experienced members rather than speak himself: &#145;hereby you will recommend your self when people shall observe soe much modesty joyned with your parts and judgment&#146;  (Locke to King, 31 Jan 1701, Bodl. Oxf., MS Locke c. 40, fol. 100). But he made his first speech within a month of his election, and was a partisan in the bitter struggles over the impeachment of the whig lords and the Kentish petition.<h2>
<a name="Lawyerparliamentarian17021714"></a>Lawyer&#150;parliamentarian, 1702&#150;1714</h2>King was a man of strong moral principles, informed by his faith, which he carried into his public life as well as his writings. He was an early member of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, founded in 1701, and in 1702 he published <span class="italic">The History of the Apostles Creed: with Critical Observations on its Several Articles</span>. At first this attracted greater attention in Europe than in England, but ultimately it became a foundational text for further research, and generated several editions over the next forty years, one in Latin translation. His energies were now principally given over to his legal practice and attendance in parliament, wherein his nonconformist conscience inclined him to country measures as well as whiggism. He distinguished himself in January 1704 by making an able speech in the great debate over the Aylesbury election case, maintaining the right of electors to have a remedy at common law for denial of their votes, against tory insistence on the privileges of the Commons. In September 1704 Locke congratulated him on his marriage to Anne (1688/9&#150;1767), the daughter of Richard Seyes of Boverton in Glamorgan, who had a fortune of at least &pound;4000; but he lost his mentor the following month, acquiring half of his landholdings and many of his books. During the next few years the focus of his life shifted with increasing success: while he became recorder of Glastonbury in July 1705, his prospects centred on the capital, and when he came to purchase a major estate in 1710 he settled on the manor of Ockham in Surrey, within easy carriage distance of London.<br>
<br>In parliament between 1705 and 1708 King was prominent among an important group of independent whigs which maintained a broadly &#145;country&#146; programme of measures. He sponsored a moderate place bill in January 1705; he was one of the leaders in the unsuccessful campaign for the &#145;whimsical&#146; place clause added to the <span class="roman">Regency Bill</span> in January and February 1706; and in December 1707 he took a prominent part in the whig attack on the administration of the Admiralty. Indeed, although he was normally inclined to act with the junto whigs in party issues, his enthusiasm for eliminating &#145;interest&#146; and exposing administrative mismanagement induced him to support the tory-inspired inquiry into the conduct of the war in Spain in late 1707 and 1708. By this time he had made an impression, and in the spring of 1708 the whigs in the government were keen to appease him with office: &#145;if he were engag'd, the Whymsical Whigs &hellip; wou'd have no Head to govern them, and having generally very indifferent ones of their own, cou'd do no great mischief&#146;  (A. Mainwaring to duchess of Marlborough, 9 April 1708, BL, Add. MS 61459, fols. 24&#150;5). Unfortunately his speeches against the Admiralty had offended Queen Anne, who believed they were aimed at her husband, Prince George, the lord high admiral. She therefore vetoed a proposal that he should be appointed solicitor-general, and would not even countenance his becoming one of her counsel. In the event the administration arranged for him to be elected recorder of London on 27 July, and he was knighted on 12 September. The whig junto also nominated him as their preferred candidate for speaker after the general election of 1708, although he eventually gave way to the court candidate, Sir Richard Onslow.<br>
<br>As recorder of London, King was present at the commemorative service held in St Paul's Cathedral on 5 November 1709, when Dr Henry Sacheverell preached on the text &#145;in peril among False Brethren&#146;, and he subsequently objected to the explosive sermon in the court of aldermen. In December 1709 he took a leading role in censuring Sacheverell's high-flying doctrines in the Commons, and in January he was one of the committee that drew up articles of impeachment. At the trial he naturally took principal responsibility for the second article, which accused Sacheverell of condemning the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span> of 1689. In a closely reasoned but temperate speech on 28 February he effectively demolished the defendant's disingenuous answer, to the effect that he did not intend his criticisms to refer to the act, and showed that his words could be construed only as an argument that liberty of conscience tended ultimately to treason, and that such indulgence should be suppressed, rather than encouraged. Indeed, he cleverly contended that Sacheverell had denied the queen's supremacy over the church, in so far as Sacheverell maintained that the clergy's censures against the dissenters were beyond earthly power to reverse. He also deployed all his deep historical learning to praise Archbishop Edmund Grindal, whom Sacheverell had condemned for recommending toleration to Queen Elizabeth, as &#145;a man universally esteemed for his virtue, piety, and learning&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 15.149). He reiterated this last point nine days later, on 9 March, when he replied to the defence on the second article. This was the high point of King's parliamentary career: his performance could have left no one in doubt of his forensic ability, and by taking a prominent part in such a party set piece he publicly declared his political allegiances.<br>
<br>Certainly King's instinct for independence and scrupulous governance survived&#151;in December 1711 he brought in a hopeless motion for balloting at elections, which was duly lost by a large majority, and in 1713 he supported another place clause&#151;but for the remainder of Anne's reign he was clearly identified as one of the whig leaders in the Commons, especially in their resistance to the tory peace and concern for the Hanoverian succession. In June 1712 he spoke up for William Fleetwood, bishop of St Asaph, an opponent of the peace, who was attacked by the tories on the pretext of objecting to the preface of his recently published collection of sermons. And in February 1713 he was counsel for the whig journalist George Ridpath, prosecuted by the government for attacking the peace in his <span class="italic">Flying Post</span>. In July of that year he also defended William Whiston before the court of delegates upon Whiston's prosecution for denying the Trinity. Naturally, in March 1714 he spoke against concurring in the address of thanks for the treaty of Utrecht, concentrating on the need for further safeguards to protect the protestant succession. And of course, as a whig and dissenter, he resisted the <span class="roman">Schism Bill</span> in May, deploying his reputation as a patristic scholar to compare it to the Roman persecution of the early Christians.<h2>
<a name="Chiefjustice17141725"></a>Chief justice, 1714&#150;1725</h2>When George I arrived in London, King gave a gracious speech of welcome on behalf of the corporation. With the death of Queen Anne the veto on his further promotion was removed, and upon the nomination of Lord Chancellor Cowper he became lord chief justice of common pleas on 27 October 1714, in place of Thomas Trevor, first Baron Trevor, who was removed on political grounds. As such, he shared in the augmentation of all the judges' salaries obtained via the petition of Sir Thomas Parker, chief justice of king's bench. King had now left the Commons and was now effectively removed from the front line of party strife, and during his decade on the common law bench was only occasionally called upon to try state prosecutions. But he continued to influence elections in Devon, and managed the parliamentary borough of Bere Alston for his former patron Sir Francis Drake, thereby obliging Robert Walpole, whose brother was returned to one of the seats in the parliament of 1715. After the Jacobite rising of 1715 he presided at the special commission which tried the commoners accused of taking part. His report to the secretary of state on the proceedings is remarkable for its fairness and humanity towards the prisoners, several of whom he recommended to the king's mercy. With the majority of the judges, in 1718 he gave his opinion for the king when they were tendered questions about his legal right to supervise the education and marriages of the children of the prince of Wales. And in October 1719 he presided at the Old Bailey trial of John Matthews for treason in publishing a tract alleging the right of the Pretender, James Stuart, to the throne. Matthews was only nineteen years of age, and one of the crown counsel admitted he was merely &#145;an obstinate instrument in the hands of some greater person&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 15.1338), but King summed up clinically and the jury brought in a guilty verdict.<br>
<br>The only other significant criminal trial for which King was responsible was <i>R. v. Woodburne and Coke</i>, for a murderous attack on Edward Crispe, Coke's brother-in-law, which was held at Bury St Edmunds in March 1722. Crispe had survived the assault, and since attempted murder was only a misdemeanour at common law, the defendants were prosecuted under a capital clause in an obscure statute of 1670 (22 &amp; 23 Chas. II c. 1) directed against malicious maiming and wounding. Although not represented by counsel, Coke attempted to take advantage of his confessed intention to kill, rather than maim, but King would not accept this as a point of law for argument, and insisted the intention was a matter of fact for the jury, who found both men guilty. His severe speech on giving judgment in this case suggests that his decision may have been influenced by personal abhorrence at the callousness of the crime, from which Coke hoped to inherit Crispe's estate. Some later authorities believed that he allowed the statute to be extended too far  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 16.54&#150;94).<h2>
<a name="Lordchancellor17251733"></a>Lord chancellor, 1725&#150;1733</h2>In 1725, when Lord Chancellor Macclesfield (previously Sir Thomas Parker) was impeached, King was chosen to conduct his trial. The proceedings were conducted at the bar of the House of Lords, wherein he was commissioned to preside as their speaker. Although the trial took thirteen days in May, his role was largely a formal one, since he was not a peer and had no voice but as the mouthpiece of the Lords. Four days after pronouncing sentence, on 29 May, he was created Baron King, of Ockham, and on 1 June he was appointed lord chancellor himself, with an additional salary of &pound;1200 in consideration of loss of profits from sales of masterships in chancery. But although he had given great satisfaction in common pleas, and his reputation for integrity made the appointment popular, expectations of his performance were greatly disappointed. He was not experienced in chancery practice, and his lack of equity learning destroyed his confidence, thereby enervating his dispatch. Lord Hervey said of his practice on the bench:<blockquote>He had such a diffidence of himself that he did not dare to do right, for fear of doing wrong; decrees were always extorted from him; and had he been let alone he would never have given any suitor his due, for fear of giving him what was not so. (Hervey, 1.280&#150;81)</blockquote>Several of his decisions were reversed on appeal to the Lords, but he was able to settle some important points of doctrine. In <i>Coppin v. Coppin</i> (1725) he ruled that a will settling land in England must conform to the rules of English law, even when made abroad. And in <i>Croft v. Pyke</i> (1733) he determined that a partner's joint estate was liable first to the debts of the partnership, before payment of legacies to his heirs. He was generally reluctant to interpose against the common law, although in cases of married women's separate property he accepted that the practice of the court was to compel a husband to make a settlement on the wife before recovering his wife's portion by equity (<i>Milner v. Colmer</i>, 1731, and <i>Brown et Uxor v. Elton</i>, 1733).<br>
<br>King's impact on the administration of the court was more significant than his contribution to doctrine, however. The circumstances of his predecessor's disgrace meant that his inclination for honest management was encouraged, and he achieved some important reforms. Steps were taken to ensure that the suitors who were liable to lose by the insolvency of the delinquent masters in chancery were indemnified, and he sponsored legislation which required that suitors' money should in future be paid into the Bank of England. The office of accountant-general was established to oversee the funds and securities brought into the court. Indeed, his reforming efforts may have extended beyond the court of chancery; for during his period in office the legislature was attentive to contemporary complaints about the mysterious nature and crippling expense of litigation proceedings generally. Although not recorded as a speaker at the relevant debate in the Lords, he is said to have been the author of the 1731 statute which required all legal documents and processes to use English, rather than Latin or law French. It may be no coincidence that in 1732 a committee of the House of Commons criticized the increase in the number of chancery officers since the sixteenth century; and in 1733, following its recommendation, a royal commission was established to report on the fees taken in all the courts of England and Wales. King also resisted the extension of royal patronage in the church. He had been reappointed by George II in June 1727, but in July the king told him that henceforth he intended to nominate to all the ecclesiastical offices previously within the chancellor's patronage. King thereupon replied &#145;that this was a right belonging to the office, annexed to it by act of parliament and immemorial usage, and I hoped he would not put things out of their ancient course&#146;  (King's diary, 8 July 1727, in Campbell, 6.108). The king subsequently gave up the point, although Walpole reported that he was &#145;disobliged&#146; by the lord chancellor's &#145;peremptory manner&#146;  (Ryder's diary, 18 Oct 1739).<h2>
<a name="Deathandsignificance"></a>Death and significance</h2>King ruined his health by his efforts to become competent in equity, and by sitting late to deal with the increasing arrears in his court. It is said that towards the end he dozed on the bench, while the proceedings of the court were substantially controlled by Sir Philip Yorke and Charles Talbot, the leaders of the chancery bar. After a paralytic stroke he was forced to resign on 19 November 1733, accepting a gratuity of &pound;20,000. He died of a further stroke at Ockham on 22 July 1734, and was buried in the church there, being survived by his wife, who lived until 1 July 1767, and six children, including four sons, John (<i>bap</i>. 1706, <i>d</i>. 1740), Peter (<i>bap</i>. 1709, <i>d</i>. 1754), William (1711&#150;1767), and Thomas (1712&#150;1779), each successively Baron King of Ockham, and two daughters, Elizabeth and Anne, who died unmarried. By his will, in addition to his principal estate at Ockham he left separate estates in land to his two eldest sons and &pound;8000 each to his younger children. But he desired to be buried &#145;with as little funeral show as possible&#146;, and commended his wife and children &#145;to the protection and providence of Almighty God, which will be their best Defence&#146;. A monument by Rysbrack memorialized him as &#145;a friend to true religion and liberty&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1690&#150;1715</span>).<br>
<br>Although he had been an important politician during the party warfare under Anne, and he presided as president of the regency council during the monarch's absence in Hanover, King had little influence over major policy decisions as lord chancellor. Indeed in his later years some old acquaintances and political allies were alienated by what they discerned as a departure from his disinterested principles. William Whiston relates his disappointment on approaching King for a prebend on behalf of a friend:<blockquote>I found so prodigious a Change in him, such strange Coldness in the Matters that concerned Religion, and such an earnest Inclination to Money and Power, that I gave up my Hopes quickly. Nay, indeed, I soon perceived that he disposed of his Preferments almost wholly at the Request of such Men as could best support him in his high Station, without Regard to Christianity. (<span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; William Whiston</span>, 1.35)</blockquote>These comments on King are qualified by Whiston's self-righteousness, but Walpole also said that he became excessively avaricious after becoming a peer, insisting on having a tellership of the exchequer for his eldest son and claiming a service of plate as speaker of the House of Lords  (Ryder's diary, 18 Oct 1739). While these accusations of worldly materialism sit uneasily with his public behaviour, there is no doubt that King was unwise to accept an office for which he was manifestly unsuited, and his reputation suffered accordingly. He was a man whose virtues provoked unusual expectations, however, and it is unfortunate that his successors in office did not follow his lead in reforming the administration of justice.<br>
