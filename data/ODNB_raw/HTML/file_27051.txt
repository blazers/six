<span class="headword">Taylor,  John</span>  (1739&#150;1838), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, was born in Bishopsgate, London, the son of a customs official. He may have been the John Taylor baptized on 24 February 1739 at St Ethelburga, Bishopsgate, the son of John Taylor and his wife, Mary. He studied art at the drawing academy in St Martin's Lane, London, and also under Francis Hayman. He was with Hayman by the mid 1760s, &#145;by which time he had produced a drawing of Hayman's <span class="italic">Triumph of Britannia</span> for S. F. Ravenet to work up into a large engraving published by Boydell in 1765&#146;  (Allen, 506). In 1766 he was one of the original members of the Incorporated Society of Artists. In 1772 he gave his address as &#145;At Mr Hayman's, Dean Street, Soho&#146;, suggesting that he was with his master for some years. His lengthy anecdotal poem <span class="italic">Frank Hayman: a Tale</span> contains many witty reminiscences of those years. Although few of his early works (which were painted in a variety of media) survive, a large number of highly finished pencil portraits (his speciality), dating from 1767 to 1771, are in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. <span class="italic">A Young Scholar and his Tutor</span>, signed and dated 1772, is a typical example and shows the influence of his master in the treatment of the eyes and lips. As he only obtained between 7<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. and 1 guinea for his drawings he became, with the assistance of his friends Paul Sandby and J. A. Gresse, a drawing-master in London. Between about 1788 and 1791 he was in Rome, where he made miniature copies after the old masters. By March 1788 Lord Gardenstone had bought his miniature after Correggio's <span class="italic">Mystic Marriage of St Catherine</span> (<i>c</i>.1520s) and commissioned several others. In 1790 he was recorded as a miniature painter living by the Quartiere dei Avignonesi.<br>
<br>Taylor's teaching enabled him to accumulate a sum which he invested in annuities to last him to the age of 100. This he nearly attained (thereby gaining the distinguishing title Old Taylor), as he died in Cirencester Place, Marylebone, Middlesex, on 21 November 1838 in his ninety-ninth year. He exhibited a variety of historical, literary, and mythological works at the Society of Artists (1764&#150;77), the Royal Academy (1778&#150;1824), and the British Institution (1808&#150;38). He was a friend of the eccentric sculptor Joseph Nollekens, who made a bust of him, and left him a legacy in his will.<br>
<br>Another <a name="cosubject_27051"></a><span class="headword">John Taylor</span>  (1745?&#150;1806), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was born in Bath. He painted marine landscapes with figures and cattle, and was also an etcher. He died at Bath on 8 November 1806.<br>
