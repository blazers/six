<span class="headword">Hodgson,  Studholme</span>  (1707/8&#150;1798), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the son of John Hodgson, a Carlisle merchant whose family originated from Wormanby, Burgh by Sands. After attending Carlisle grammar school and, in 1727, being made free of his father's guild by patrimony, he entered the army as an ensign in the 1st foot guards on 22 January 1728. He became lieutenant and captain in the same regiment on 25 April 1740 and captain and lieutenant-colonel on 22 February 1747. A shooting companion of General Oglethorpe, he was aide-de-camp to the earl of Albemarle at Dettingen and Fontenoy and to the duke of Cumberland at Culloden. Henry Conway and others of the staff nicknamed him the Old Boy, on account of his long-standing seniority; the Dutch, however, complained of his rudeness towards them at Laffelt.<br>
<br>Hodgson married Catherine Howard (1734&#150;1798), the sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13900/', "Field Marshal Sir George Howard")</script>, on 22 July 1756. The same year he was appointed colonel of the recently raised 52nd, later 50th foot. In 1757 he commanded a brigade in the Rochefort expedition and was among those who voted for withdrawal before a landing had been attempted. Two years later he was promoted major-general and transferred to the colonelcy of the 5th foot. In 1761, with the return to favour of the duke of Cumberland at court, Hodgson was given command of the expedition against Belle &Icirc;le. The calibre of many of his troops left him unimpressed and the first attempt to effect a landing on the island failed. With the arrival of reinforcements, however, a lodgement was secured, the French were driven back to the citadel of Palais, and, after a siege of six weeks, on 7 June 1761 the fortress surrendered. Throughout the siege Hodgson was critical of the quantity and quality of the stores provided for him by the Board of Ordnance. In response, Lord Ligonier, master-general of the ordnance, wrote and accused Hodgson of wasting ammunition. Hodgson took umbrage at the letter: &#145;Surely Lady Betty Germain is at the head of the Army and has the impertinence to sign herself Ligonier&#146;  (Albemarle MSS, HA 67, 894/B/B10). None the less, Hodgson received high compliments from the king and Pitt for a service which had a decided influence upon the peace negotiations.<br>
<br>Hodgson was master of the horse to the duke of Cumberland, and he remained his trusted friend until the duke's death in 1765. The same year Hodgson was appointed governor of Fort George and Fort Augustus. He became colonel of the 4th King's Own foot in 1768, was promoted general in 1778, and was in succession colonel of the 4th Irish horse and the 11th dragoons. On 30 July 1796 he was created field marshal. Hodgson died, aged ninety, at his home in Old Burlington Street, London, on 20 October 1798 and was buried six days later within the parish of St James's, Piccadilly. His heir was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13440/', "John Hodgson (1757&#150;1846)")</script>, the only one of three sons and two daughters to survive him.<br>
