<span class="headword">Porter, Sir  George Hornidge</span>, first baronet  (1822&#150;1895), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was born in Kildare Street, Dublin, on 24 November 1822, one of the two sons and five daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22583/', "William Henry Porter (1791&#150;1861)")</script>, surgeon, and his wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1858), daughter of Cuthbert Hornidge, of Blessington, co. Wicklow. He was educated privately before becoming indentured to Josiah Smyly on 6 November 1838. He took the LRCSI on 2 November 1844, and was elected a fellow two weeks later. He had entered Trinity College on 18 January 1840, and became BA in 1845, MB in 1848, and MD considerably later, in 1865. He was awarded the honorary MCh degree by Trinity College in 1873, and in 1888 he was granted a doctorate in science by the University of Glasgow. In 1861 he married Julia, the second daughter of Isaac Bond of Flimly, Cumberland. They had one surviving son.<br>
<br>Porter's career followed a pattern set by his father, who was surgeon to the Meath Hospital and professor of surgery in the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI), and who enjoyed the reputation of being a courageous surgeon as well as an excellent anatomist and pathologist; William Porter was also president of the RCSI in 1838. George Hornidge Porter joined the staff of the Meath Hospital in 1849. He was president of the RCSI in 1868&#150;9, and in 1891 he was elected regius professor of surgery in the University of Dublin. He was in demand as an expert witness in the coroner's court, and he was one of those asked to examine the bodies of Lord Frederick Cavendish and Thomas Henry Burke, who were murdered in Phoenix Park in 1882. In addition to his major appointment at the Meath Hospital, Porter was surgeon to Simpson's Hospital, consulting surgeon to St Mark's and Dr Steevens' hospitals, and sometime president of the Dublin Pathological Society and of the Dublin branch of the British Medical Society. His publications included reports in the <span class="italic">Dublin Quarterly Journal of Medical Science</span> on excisions of the ulna and the upper jaw, and he also wrote on lithotomy, tracheotomy, and other surgical problems.<br>
<br>Porter became a member of the Kildare Street Club at a time when that body was dominated by the landed gentry, and he risked being blackballed. He is reputed to have possessed the social graces in full measure and was active on numerous charitable boards. His uncle, Frank Thorpe Porter, a stipendiary magistrate, was a well-known raconteur and the author of <span class="italic">Grand Juries in Ireland</span> (1840), <span class="italic">Recollections of an Irish Police Magistrate</span> (1875), and <span class="italic">Gleanings and Reminiscences</span> (2nd edn, 1875).<br>
<br>Porter was appointed surgeon-in-ordinary to the queen in Ireland in 1869, received a knighthood in 1883, and was created baronet in 1889. To crown his success, he purchased an estate in co. Wexford. He was proud of his position as a country gentleman, and especially of being high sheriff of the county. He died of heart disease on 16 June 1895 at his residence, 3 Merrion Square North, Dublin, and was survived by his wife. His son succeeded as second baronet.<br>
