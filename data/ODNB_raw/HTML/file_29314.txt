<span class="headword">Whiting,  John</span>  (1656&#150;1722), <span class="occ">Quaker bibliographer and writer</span>, was born at Nailsea near Bristol. His parents were John Whiting (<i>d</i>. 1658), a yeoman of Nailsea, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1666), daughter of John Evans. Whiting recalled that his parents &#145;came of honest parents, and of good report in the country&#146;, where his ancestors had long owned an estate  (Whiting, <span class="italic">Persecution</span>, introduction). They were converted to Quakerism in 1654 by John Audland and John Camm, and the first meetings in Somerset were held in their home. His father died in 1658, leaving the tuition of Whiting and his sister Mary (1654&#150;1676) to their mother, who educated them &#145;according to truth&#146;  (ibid.). In December 1660 his mother was sent with 200 others to Ilchester gaol for refusing the oath of allegiance to the new king, so that he and his sister lived for a time with their grandfather. His mother was released at the spring assizes at Chard, and later in 1661 married Moses Bryant of Nailsea, with whom she had three sons before her death in November 1666.<br>
<br>Educated at a grammar school, but brought up as a Quaker, Whiting noted that &#145;the wild nature was apt to appear in me, till truth took hold of me and opened in my understanding&#146;  (Whiting, <span class="italic">Persecution</span>, introduction). At the age of twelve he was &#145;taken off&#146; from &#145;sports and pastimes&#146; and &#145;became more sober and religiously inclined&#146;  (ibid.). He was taught hat honour&#151;doffing the hat to social superiors&#151;but rejected the practice, regarding it as &#145;evil&#146;  (ibid.). Afterwards he was taught by a Friend, under whom he &#145;profited most every way&#146;. He evidently found Quaker social customs difficult, however, for:<blockquote>the plain language also cost me very dear, it was so hard to take up, so that I could have gone miles about rather than having met some of my relations to speak to them; which how small a thing soever some may count it, I could have no peace till I gave up and took up the cross in that respect, and then it was made easie to me, and I had peace therein. (ibid.)</blockquote>In 1670 Whiting discovered a testimony in his heart against &#145;hireling priests&#146; and tithe-taking; as he later wrote: &#145;I could discern a difference between them and Friends, as plain as between the whitest and brownest bread in my father's house&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>On the death of his stepfather in June 1672 Whiting went to live with his new guardian, Edmond Beaks, at Portishead, near Bristol, for about three years; there he met the Quakers Charles Marshall and George Cole who, he recalled, &#145;were as fathers in the truth to me&#146;  (Whiting, <span class="italic">Persecution</span>, introduction). Whiting's sister Mary had become a Quaker preacher and in August 1675 set out on a journey towards London. Whiting joined her in Buckinghamshire in November and they visited Quakers in Reading gaol, after which he returned home and his sister continued her mission northwards. On 1 April 1676 he met her again at Norton, co. Durham, where she was taken ill. Her death a week later, on 8 April, at the age of twenty-two was &#145;a great exercise&#146; for Whiting. Her youthful piety had an intense effect on her brother, and four years later while in prison he wrote a testimony to her, published in 1681 as <span class="italic">Early Piety Exemplified in the Life and Death of Mary Whiting</span>.<br>
<br>Whiting returned to Nailsea after his sister's death:<blockquote>being then in the 20th year of my age; and having some of my estate in my hands, I manur'd part of it, and sow'd it with corn the latter end of this year, and the next spring some more of it, of which I had a small crop of about ten acres the summer following. (Whiting, <span class="italic">Persecution</span>, 10)</blockquote>He was cited to appear in the bishop's court for non-payment of tithes on 28 May 1678. The following year he was appointed overseer of the poor for his parish; he suffered no further persecution until 28 January 1679, when he was arrested and sent to Ilchester gaol. He was committed at first to the sheriff's ward, or Old Nunnery; after some time he was moved to the Old Friary and allowed to take walks outside and occasionally visit Nailsea. Many other Quakers were also prisoners, and on Sundays they held meetings, attended by outsiders, in the great hall or the walled orchard of the gaol. Whiting was in frequent correspondence with London friends who sent him books. He wrote much, and read the works of Jakob Boehme, Sir Walter Ralegh, and others. In 1681 he was moved to the common gaol in Ilchester and put in &#145;a dark nasty hole, called Doctors Commons&#146;, where he lay on damp straw  (ibid., 56). About this time he wrote the testimony of his sister and soon afterwards, he records, &#145;I began to write my own memoirs &hellip; chiefly for a memorial to myself of the dealings of the Lord with me from my childhood&#146;  (ibid., 57). In 1684 he was allowed to take a room at the home of another Quaker, Widow Scott, which was &#145;the best prison (except the Friary) that ever I had&#146;, and where the men's monthly meetings were held  (ibid., 105).<br>
<br>In 1685, on James II's accession, Whiting vainly tried to obtain his release: &#145;it became a proverb&#146;, he recalled, &#145;that liberty of conscience was in the press, it was so long a coming out&#146;  (Whiting, <span class="italic">Persecution</span>, 140). He was free by the time Monmouth's army was marching through the west country and he saw Monmouth in Taunton, where he spoke a few words to the duke in the street and noted his thoughtful and dejected appearance. After the rebellion was smashed, and having himself seen the ruthless behaviour of King James's troops, Whiting thought it safer to surrender himself at Ilchester, where he was thrust into irons among Monmouth's men and spent almost six weeks chained to John Hipsley, another Quaker, for refusing to pay the keeper his fees:<blockquote>Nor could we put off our clothes at night, but from one arm, and let them hang on the other, so that we could not turn, but lay mostly on one side (being link'd together) which was very tedious in the heat of the summer. (ibid., 146)</blockquote>He was allowed to go to his own room after thirteen weeks and was an eyewitness to some of the atrocities of Judge Jefferys at the &#145;bloody assizes&#146;, remaining a close prisoner until the king's proclamation of March 1686.<br>
<br>On his release Whiting married Sarah Hurd on 20 May 1686; the couple settled at Long Sutton, where she kept on her trade of linen draper, and afterwards moved to a shop at Wrington. Whiting and his wife do not appear to have had any children of their own, but his testimony to Sarah Scott, his niece, reveals that when her father Francis Scott died &#145;her uncle and aunt Whiting took her, to breed up as their own, and educated her in the way of truth&#146;  (Whiting, <span class="italic">A Memorial</span>, 3) until her death on 27 September 1703 in London at the age of almost thirteen. Whiting set up meetings in the town, and William Penn often visited him and held meetings in the surrounding areas.<br>
<br>Whiting's autobiography ends in 1696. In 1699 he moved to London, and the remainder of his life was spent travelling in various counties in the south and attending to Friends' business in London. In 1700 he was at the second day morning meeting where one of his manuscripts was read, and at another time was asked to look at George Bishop's book of New England's Friends' sufferings, for reprinting purposes. In 1707 the yearly meeting requested that he gather details of ancient Friends' books from the bookseller Thomas Raylton and report these to the meeting for sufferings, a project which eventually led to his <span class="italic">Catalogue of Friends' Books</span> (1708), the first attempt at Quaker bibliography, two copies of which were sent to each monthly meeting in England and Wales and later to other nations.<br>
<br>As well as <span class="italic">Persecution Expos'd</span> and the aforementioned works, Whiting wrote numerous tracts such as <span class="italic">An Abstract of the Lives, Precepts, and Sayings of the Ancient Fathers</span> (1684), together with many defences of Quakerism, for example, <span class="italic">Judas, and the Chief Priests</span> (1701), an answer to the Quaker separatist George Keith, whom Whiting accused of attempting &#145;to expose his old Friends to the contempt of the world, and rage of their adversaries&#146;, by among other issues charging them with failing to preach &#145;Christ without&#146; and undervaluing the historic, incarnate Jesus  (pp. 1, 4). Other defences included <span class="italic">Truth and Innocency Defended</span> (1702) in answer to Cotton Mather, <span class="italic">Truth the Strongest of All</span> (1706), another reply to Keith, and <span class="italic">Christ Jesus Owned as he is God and Man</span> (1709), a defence of Quaker Christology in answer to Edward Cockson.<br>
<br>Whiting died in the parish of St Andrew, Holborn, London, on 12 November 1722 of a &#145;fever and inward wasting&#146;  (Smith, 922); he was taken from the Bull and Mouth meeting-house on 16 November and interred on the same day at the Quaker burial-ground near Hanover Street, Long Acre. His will shows that he retained property in Somerset, at Congresbury. His wife, who was his executor and main beneficiary, survived him. His bequests were otherwise directed to his cousinage and servants, and to the Quaker poor of his former Somerset and present Strand meetings and the parish poor of Nailsea and St Andrew's, Holborn. He was particularly concerned with the preservation of &#145;all my originall printed books published by the people called Quakers either bound or unbound except the reprinted collections of their works&#146;, left in trust for use by members of the London Friday and Monday meetings.<br>
