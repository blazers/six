<span class="headword">Perry,  George Frederick</span>  (1793&#150;1862), <span class="occ">composer</span>, born at Norwich, was the son of a turner, an amateur bass singer who took part in the annual performance of an oratorio at the cathedral under John Christmas Beckwith. Through Beckwith's instrumentality Perry became a chorister in the cathedral choir. His voice, if not refined, was powerful, and his musical talent very marked. After leaving the choir he learned the violin with Joseph Parnell, a lay clerk of the cathedral; piano with Parnell's son John; harmony, it is supposed, with Bond, a pupil of William Jackson, organist of Exeter Cathedral; and composition with a clever amateur, James Taylor. On 3 August 1817 his overture to <span class="italic">The Persian Hunters</span> was performed at the Lyceum Theatre, London.<br>
<br>About 1818 Perry succeeded Binfield as leader of the band at the Royal Theatre at Norwich, then an institution enjoying a considerable reputation. While still resident in his native town he wrote an oratorio, <span class="italic">The Death of Abel</span> (text by George Bennett of the Norwich Theatre), which was first performed at one of the Hall concerts in Norwich, and afterwards repeated in London by the Sacred Harmonic Society in 1841 and 1845. Shortly after his appointment to the theatre he wrote another oratorio, <span class="italic">Elijah and the Priests of Baal</span>, to a text by James Plumptre, which was first performed in Norwich on 12 March 1819. In 1822 Perry was appointed musical director of the Haymarket Theatre in London, where he wrote a number of operas. One of them, <span class="italic">Family Jars</span> (sometimes called <span class="italic">Family Quarrels</span>), a farce to a libretto by J. Lunn, was produced on 26 August 1822. Another, <span class="italic">Morning, Noon, and Night</span>, a comedy with a libretto by T. J. Dibdin, was first performed, with Madame Vestris in the cast, on 9 September 1822.<br>
<br>From opera, however, Perry soon turned again to oratorio, and on 30 February 1830, at the Hanover Square Rooms, he produced <span class="italic">The Fall of Jerusalem</span>, the text compiled by Edward Taylor (1784&#150;1863) from Henry Hart Milman's poem. While still holding his appointment at the Haymarket, he became organist of the Quebec Chapel, a post he resigned in 1846 for that of Trinity Church, Gray's Inn Road.<br>
<br>When the Sacred Harmonic Society was founded in 1832, Perry was chosen leader of the band, and at their first concert, on 15 January 1833, the programme contained a selection from his oratorios <span class="italic">The Fall of Jerusalem</span> and <span class="italic">The Death of Abel</span>. Perry assiduously supported this society, and during his sixteen years' connection with it was never absent from a performance, and only once from a rehearsal. In 1848 Joseph Surman, the conductor, was removed from his post, and Perry performed the duties until the close of the season, when he severed his connection with the society on the election of Michael Costa to the conductorship.<br>
<br>In addition to the works already mentioned, Perry wrote an oratorio, <span class="italic">Hezekiah</span> (1847), a sacred cantata, <span class="italic">Belshazzar's Feast</span> (1836), and a festival anthem with orchestral accompaniment, &#145;Blessed be the Lord God of Israel&#146;, for the queen's accession (1838). His thanksgiving anthem for the birth of the princess royal (&#145;The Queen Shall Rejoice&#146;, 1840) was performed with great success by the Sacred Harmonic Society, the orchestra and chorus numbering five hundred, Maria Caradori-Allan being the solo vocalist. He also wrote additional accompaniments to a number of Handel's works and made piano scores of several more. Some of his works were published in London. Perry died of bronchitis on 4 March 1862 at 4 Great Marylebone Street, London, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
<br>Perry's undoubted gifts enabled him to imitate rather than to create, and his musical style was based chiefly on that of Haydn as exemplified in <span class="italic">The Creation</span>, with other elements borrowed from Handel and Mozart. His fluency proved detrimental to the character of his work. It is said that he was in the habit of writing out the instrumental parts of his large compositions from memory before he had made a full orchestral score, and he frequently composed as many as four or five works simultaneously, writing a page of one while the ink of another was drying.<br>
