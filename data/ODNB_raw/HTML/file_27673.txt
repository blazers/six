<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Travers,  Walter</span>  (1548?&#150;1635), <span class="occ">religious activist and college head</span>, was born in Nottingham, the eldest child of Walter, a goldsmith, and his wife, Anne, who also had three younger sons and a daughter. His father's will suggests that he was both well off, and (assuming that he wrote the will himself) a committed protestant. The oldest of Walter's brothers, Robert, became a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, published theological works, and died in Geneva in 1575; his two youngest brothers, <a href="#cosubject_27670">John [<i>see below</i>]</a> and Humfrey, both became ministers in the Church of England. Like Robert, Walter was educated at Cambridge, matriculating as a member of Christ's College in 1560, but soon transferring to Trinity, where he was chosen, along with Thomas Cartwright, who was a fellow, to present a formal address to Queen Elizabeth on her famous visit to the university in 1564. Travers graduated BA in 1565&#150;6, was elected a junior fellow of Trinity in 1567, proceeded MA on 25 March 1569, and in the same year was made a senior fellow.<h2>
<a name="GenevaAntwerpandecclesiasticaldiscipline"></a>Geneva, Antwerp, and ecclesiastical discipline</h2>At this stage Travers seemed set for further academic honours, ordination, and a clerical career. But in 1570 he gave up his fellowship and left England for Geneva, driven out because of his puritan views. John Whitgift, appointed master of Trinity in 1567 to restore order there, commented that he had forced Travers to leave Cambridge by repeated disciplinary procedures, &#145;other wise he should have been expelled for his want of conformity towards the house and for his pertinancy&#146;  (Strype, 3.507).<br>
<br>As with John Knox and countless other religious immigrants, Geneva provided Travers with both a refuge and a model for the ideal Christian polity. Joined there by his brother Robert and by Thomas Cartwright, who shared their puritan views, he became a friend of Theodore Beza, Calvin's successor as leader of the Genevan reformation. And it was in Geneva that he wrote his major work, <span class="italic">Ecclesiasticae disciplinae et Anglicanae ecclesiae ab illa aberrationis, plena e verbo Dei, et dilucida explicatio</span>. In 1574 this was published anonymously and under a false imprint by Cartwright, who was then at Heidelberg, with a preface by him endorsing its contents. An English translation was published in the same year, also at Heidelberg. The book was closely based on Calvin's system of ecclesiastical government: for both Calvin and Travers, the church of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> was normative; the duty of the theologian was merely to identify its structure and apply it to contemporary circumstances. It was in this last respect that Travers's originality lay, for he subtly adapted Calvin's biblical model to an English context. In order to undermine the diocesan episcopate of the English church, Travers started off with an examination of the role of bishops in the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, showing that they were not part of a separate hierarchy with authority over other clergy, but merely ministers of local congregations. He also differed from Calvin in identifying elders as a type of deacon, rather than a separate kind of minister. Significantly, in view of the later travails of the presbyterians under Elizabeth, Travers did not deal with the crucial issue of the relationship between a presbyterian church and a hostile state.<br>
<br>After the publication of his account of ecclesiastical discipline Travers tested the waters in England again in 1576, returning to have his degree of MA incorporated in Oxford University. But preferment in England was not forthcoming and he had to follow the familiar puritan path to the Netherlands, where in April 1578 he secured a position as chaplain to the English Merchant Adventurers at Antwerp. It was here that he was ordained, not episcopally but according to the presbyterian fashion of the Dutch Calvinist church, by the laying on of hands by twelve ministers. The church in which he served had a wholly presbyterian structure and discipline, and Travers did not use the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, an omission challenged by the English governor of the Merchant Adventurers, Nicholas Loddington. The response, a severe reprimand for the governor by Sir Francis Walsingham and a further rebuke from William Davison, the English ambassador to the Netherlands, demonstrated what was to become a notable feature of Travers's career&#151;his close ties to influential courtiers of a Calvinist inclination.<h2>
<a name="TraversandtheEnglishpresbyterianmovement"></a>Travers and the English presbyterian movement</h2>In July 1580 Travers again returned to England, to be succeeded in his post in Antwerp by Cartwright. He turned down the offer of a professorship in St Andrews from the Scottish presbyterian leader (and fellow Genevan exile) Andrew Melville, and became instead chaplain to Elizabeth's principal minister, Lord Burghley, and tutor to his son, Robert Cecil, later earl of Salisbury. This marked the beginning of a highly important relationship for Travers, as Burghley, always sympathetic to those of a more radical religious bent than himself, repeatedly used his influence to try to protect Travers. The question, of course, was how could an avowedly presbyterian minister find a niche in the episcopal Church of England? The answer was provided by Burghley who steered Travers towards the Temple Church, that curious foundation of the knights templar which served the spiritual needs of the barristers and students of the Inner and Middle Temples in London. In 1581 Travers secured the position of deputy to the frail master, Richard Alvey. Alvey and Travers got on well, sharing as they did similarly precise religious views, and Travers felt able to introduce some audacious changes, including not kneeling (or even sitting) but ambulatory communion, and an attempt to turn collectors and sidesmen into deacons and elders after the manner of Geneva. The benchers, however, proved far from enthusiastic about the innovations, and Travers had to moderate his ambitions. In 1583 he took the familiar path of puritan scholars anxious to ingratiate themselves with the authorities, by taking up anti-Catholic polemic, publishing <span class="italic">An Answere to a Supplicatorie Epistle</span>, a detailed attack upon a recent piece of Roman Catholic propaganda, replete with extensive scriptural references to prove that the Church of Rome was a false and heretical church.<br>
<br>The appointment of Whitgift as archbishop of Canterbury in 1583 marked a decisive turning point for English puritans in general and Travers in particular. Determined to weed out nonconformists, Whitgift promulgated a set of fifteen articles with which he confronted the godly, offering them an impossible choice between subscription and suspension. The puritans used their influence at court to secure a two-day debate with Whitgift on the issue in December 1584, and Travers was selected as one of their two spokesmen. Unsurprisingly it achieved nothing. The archbishop's continuing dislike of Travers and his opinions was underlined in 1584, when on the death of Alvey Whitgift wrote to the queen to ensure that Burghley failed in his efforts to secure the succession for Travers:<blockquote>Travers hath been and is one of the chief and principal authors of dissension in this church, a contemner of the Book of Prayers, and of other orders by authority established; an earnest seeker of innovation; and either in no degree of the ministry at all, or else ordered beyond the seas &hellip; Whose placing in that room &hellip; would greatly animate the rest of that faction, and do very much harm in sundry respects. (Knox, 67)</blockquote>The choice of Richard Hooker as master of the Temple in 1585 paved the way for a set-piece confrontation between the two wings of the English Reformation. In Fuller's much quoted words, &#145;the pulpit spake pure Canterbury in the morning and Geneva in the afternoon&#146;  (Fuller, <span class="italic">Worthies</span>, 1.264), although Richard Bauckham has argued that the main issue at stake, the status of the Church of Rome, did not in fact neatly fit into any simplistic distinction between puritanism and what would become Anglicanism. Finally in March 1586 Whitgift intervened, banning Travers from preaching. When Travers again sought to enlist Burghley's support, Whitgift reiterated his complaint that Travers's lack of episcopal ordination made him unfit for preferment in the Church of England. Travers, for his part, determinedly fought to regain his right to preach, continuing to live in the Temple until late 1586, and publishing in that year a self-justifying account of his dispute with Hooker, <span class="italic">A Supplication Made to the Council</span>.<h2>
<a name="TheBookofDiscipline"></a>The Book of Discipline</h2>Disappointed in their efforts to move the queen, Travers and his fellow puritan leaders decided in 1584&#150;5 to change tactics and turned to direct action, seeking to establish a presbyterian structure within the Church of England as a kind of Trojan horse. It was a dangerous policy: not only did it inevitably arouse the deep hostility of Elizabeth, it also required the puritans to reach a consensus about a major issue on which they had so far proved unable to agree&#151;the precise form that presbyterian church discipline and government should take in England. It was to Travers that they turned to produce an agreed formula. It took a considerable time, but finally in 1587 there appeared &#145;Disciplina ecclesiae Dei verbo descripta&#146;, generally known as the <span class="roman">Book of Discipline</span>. A relatively short constitution for an English presbyterian church, this was sent out to all the classes&#151;assemblies of ministers&#151;in England.<br>
<br>Written or maybe just drafted by Travers, the book was divided into two parts, the first of which engaged in the familiar puritan task of ransacking the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and outlining all the references it contained to church polity. The second and longer section set down more detailed rules for liturgy, worship, and church organization, based upon the models of the Scottish and mainland European presbyterian churches. The <span class="roman">Book of Discipline</span> provided an alternative form of church government for England, with local classes choosing representatives for provincial synods, which would in turn select the men who would constitute the national synod. Travers published another self-explanatory title in 1588, a <span class="italic">Defence of the Ecclesiastical Discipline</span>. In March 1588, after the death of John Field, the organizing genius of the presbyterian movement, Travers took over as corresponding secretary of the presbyterians in London. It was a difficult moment, for the authorities, led by Whitgift, were now determined to take action against the presbyterians, who had been weakened by the death in September of that crucial puritan patron the earl of Leicester. Finally in 1590 the presbyterian ringleaders were brought successively before the high commission and the Star Chamber and charged with seditiously attempting to undermine the queen's supreme authority in the church. Though held and questioned closely during 1591, the government released the presbyterian leaders after 1592, confident now that it had broken the presbyterian movement.<h2>
<a name="ProvostofTrinityCollegeDublin"></a>Provost of Trinity College, Dublin</h2>It is mysterious that Travers was never arrested and imprisoned. He is known to have been in London in 1590, and Whitgift was certainly aware of his leading role in the movement, yet he remained at large. Clearly, however, he could not remain long in London. As the presbyterian leaders scattered to the remote corners of the land following their release, Travers again turned to Burghley for one last favour, and was again obliged. Burghley may have been powerless to protect the presbyterians from the Star Chamber in London, but he was still highly influential in Ireland, and he found sanctuary there for Travers in the newly founded university of Trinity College, Dublin. Burghley had been instrumental in establishing the college, and his client, Archbishop Adam Loftus of Dublin, had been its first, albeit temporary, provost. He was succeeded on 5 June 1594 by Travers.<br>
<br>Travers, who had strong views on the religious role of universities, surrounded himself in Trinity by such like-minded puritans as Humphrey Fen, and decisively shaped the new university's theology&#151;and probably the theological education of its most notable early graduate, James Ussher&#151;in a Calvinist way. It would be wrong, though, to see Travers as constructing another presbyterian Trojan horse in Dublin: in an address to the new provost Loftus had publicly warned him against introducing dangerous dissensions into the Irish church. Apart from teaching, much of Travers's time was taken up with securing sufficient money to ensure Trinity's survival, a task made especially difficult by the intensification of the Nine Years' War (1594&#150;1603). In October 1598, with the situation in both the college and the country looking increasingly bleak, he gave up the provostship and departed for England.<h2>
<a name="Retirement"></a>Retirement</h2>Travers must have had hopes of further preferment, since he secured a letter of recommendation from the Dublin authorities praising his efforts as provost and pointedly emphasizing that he had avoided religious contention during his time in Dublin and was worthy of being allowed to resume his ministry in England. But it was not to be. Though he lived on into the reign of Charles I, Travers never gained another post. Instead he passed the remainder of his life in retirement, appearing occasionally in puritan circles, as in 1604 when his name was mentioned as a possible representative at the Hampton Court conference, or in 1610 when he was noted as preaching without a licence at All Saints' Church, Hereford. His last public statement was his book <span class="italic">Vindiciae ecclesiae Anglicanae</span>, which appeared in 1630 and sought to defend the protestant church of England against the Roman Catholic threat. Travers died in 1635, some time between making his will on 14 January and its being proved ten days later. In it he distributed his assets in cash (amounting to &pound;351) among his nieces and nephews, along with bequests to support students at Trinity College, Dublin, and Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and to pay for a preacher at Sion College, London.<br>
<br>Among the beneficiaries of Walter Travers's will were the sons of his younger brother <a name="cosubject_27670"></a><span class="headword">John Travers</span>  (1549/50&#150;1620)<span class="occ"></span>. John became a demy at Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1567, aged seventeen, and was a fellow of the college from 1569 to 1585. He graduated BA there on 23 October 1570 and proceeded MA on 19 May 1574. Like his elder brother he took orders, though apparently in a more orthodox manner, and also like him was frequently at odds with the church establishment. In 1575 he was involved in disputes over the election of a new college president, while in 1578 he was summoned before the high commission. He became friendly with the second earl of Bedford, being granted six months' leave of absence from Magdalen in April 1576 in order to stay with the earl. Bedford was a pillar of the godly in the south-west, and it was doubtless through his influence that Travers became active in the diocese of Exeter. In 1585 he was suspended for proclaiming unauthorized fasts there, and in 1600 he was among the ministers denounced by Bishop Cotton for their puritan tendencies. Cotton's complaint implies that Travers had no benefice; in 1601, however, he was vicar of Landrake in Cornwall. Four years later he was a leading figure in the resistance to Archbishop Bancroft's drive for conformity. John Travers died in 1620 as rector of Farringdon in Devon. He had married Alice, sister of Richard Hooker, and they had four sons, all of whom took orders.<br>
<br>Although Walter Travers exerted a considerable influence on the development of English presbyterianism, decisively tying the movement to the strict position that their Calvinist framework was the sole biblical church polity, and seeking to Anglicize the presbyterian system of church government, he signally failed in his major aim&#151;to create an established presbyterian church in England. Indeed, his main achievement was probably, and ironically, his role as the irritant that may have stimulated Hooker to produce one of the few great works of English theology, the <span class="italic">Treatise on the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity</span>.<br>
