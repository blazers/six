<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Joachim,  Joseph</span>  (1831&#150;1907), <span class="occ">violinist</span>, born in Kitsee, near Pressburg, on 28 June 1831, was the seventh of the eight children of Julius Joachim, a wool merchant, and his wife, Fanny. After the family moved to Pest in 1833 he began violin lessons with Stanislaw Serwaczy&#324;ski, and he made his first public appearance in 1839, playing a double concerto by Friedrich Eck with his teacher. He then studied in Vienna with Hauser, George Hellmesberger, and Joseph Boehm, and from 1843 in Leipzig, where Mendelssohn's direct involvement in his progress profoundly influenced his musical and intellectual development.<br>
<br>Joachim began his long and fruitful relationship with England in 1844. Mendelssohn's letter of recommendation referred to &#145;his promise of a noble service to art&#146;. After two insignificant public appearances, Joachim made his real London d&eacute;but, under Mendelssohn's conductorship, at the Philharmonic concert of 27 May in the then rarely performed Beethoven violin concerto (playing his own cadenzas). The review in the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> described him as<blockquote>a little boy of thirteen, who perhaps is the first violin player, not only of his age, but of his <i>si&egrave;cle</i>. &hellip; His tone is of the purest <i>cantabile</i> character; his execution is most marvellous, and at the same time unembarrassed; his style is chaste, but deeply impassioned at moments; and his deportment is that of a conscious, but modest genius! (Fuller Maitland, 8)</blockquote>Joachim visited England twice more (1847 and 1849) before assuming the leadership of Liszt's orchestra in Weimar in 1849; but, disillusioned with the so-called New German School, he served as Konzertmeister in Hanover from 1853 to 1866. About 1854 he converted from Judaism to Christianity. In 1863 he married the contralto Amalie Weiss 
    (Schneeweiss; 1839&#150;1899)
  , from whom he separated in 1884. The great success of his visits to England in 1852, 1858, and 1859 led him, from 1862, to make them an annual event. By this time Joachim's unchallengeable pre-eminence among modern violinists was beginning to be widely acknowledged in England. Haweis, for instance, observed in <span class="italic">Music and Morals</span> in 1871:<blockquote>M. Joachim is the greatest living violinist; no man is so nearly to the execution of music what Beethoven was to its composition. There is something massive, complete and unerring about M. Joachim that lifts him out of the list of great players, and places him on a pedestal apart. Other men have their specialities; he has none. Others rise above or fall below themselves; he is always himself, neither less nor more. He wields the sceptre of his bow with the easy royalty of one born to reign; he plays Beethoven's concerto with the rapt infallible power of a seer delivering his oracle, and he takes his seat at a quartet very much like Apollo entering his chariot to drive the horses of the sun. (Haweis, 504)</blockquote>It seemed possible in the late 1860s that Joachim might make his permanent home in England. However, his assumption of the directorship of the newly established Hochschule f&uuml;r Aus&uuml;bende Tonkunst in 1868 established him in Berlin, where he soon founded the Joachim Quartet. In London, Joachim led another regular quartet (with Louis Ries, Ludwig Strauss, and Alfredo Piatti) for many years at the Popular Concerts. Cambridge University awarded him an honorary doctorate in music in 1877, on which occasion he conducted Brahms's first symphony. He later received doctorates from Oxford and Glasgow. In 1904 a special concert was given at the Queen's Hall to celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of his appearance in England, which included his overture <span class="italic">Henry IV</span>, and in which he played the Beethoven concerto. As a composer he made little impact, but as a musician his influence on British musical life was profound. He provided an authoritative example of &#145;purity of style without pedantry; fidelity of interpretation combined with a powerful individuality&#146;  (Grove, <span class="italic">Dict. mus.</span>). From 1900 he visited London annually with his Berlin Quartet, and in 1906 they gave a series of Brahms's complete chamber music at the Queen's Hall. A planned visit the following year was prevented by Joachim's illness, and he died in Berlin on 15 August 1907. He was buried in the cemetery of the Kaiser Wilhelm Ged&auml;chtnisskirche, Charlottenburg, Berlin, on 19 August.<br>
