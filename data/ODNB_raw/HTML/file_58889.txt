<span class="headword">Stevens,  Bernard George</span>  (1916&#150;1983), <span class="occ">composer and teacher</span>, was born on 2 March 1916 at 82 Holmleigh Road, Stamford Hill, east London, the son of George Stevens, a foreman metalworker, and his wife, Nellie Louise Martin. He received early encouragement from the composer Harold Samuel (who gave him free lessons) and attended Southend High School for Boys during the tenure of Arthur Hutchings (later professor of music at Durham University); he then read English at St John's College, Cambridge (1934&#150;7), before reading for a MusB degree under Edward Dent and Cyril Rootham. From 1937 he studied at the Royal College of Music, London, as a Leverhulme scholar with R. O. Morris (composition), Arthur Benjamin (piano), Gordon Jacob (orchestration), and Constant Lambert (conducting), and also took some lessons independently with Sir Donald Tovey. In 1940, while at the college, he won the Parry prize for composition with a violin sonata written for Bertha Minnie Pells, a student at the Royal Academy of Music. Stevens then served in the Royal Army Pay Corps for six years and was initially stationed in London during the blitz.<br>
<br>During the war Stevens wrote a violin concerto for Max Rostal, but the work that brought him into prominence was his <span class="italic">Symphony of Liberation</span>, op. 7, which won first prize in the 1945 victory symphony competition run by the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>. It was first performed on 7 June the following year by the London Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Malcolm Sargent (one of the judges of the competition; the others were Arthur Bliss and Constant Lambert). However, Stevens had been a member of the Communist Party since 1943, and as soon as this became public knowledge his official success was over. It cannot be doubted that his political leanings and championship of other left-wing activists told heavily against the promotion and reception of his work, despite determined efforts to ensure that it was comprehensible and accessible. He was sustained by his marriage to the violinist Bertha Minnie Pells, whom he married in 1946, and remained a member of the party until prompted to resign by the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956.<br>
<br>As a member and later a vice-president of the Workers' Music Association (WMA), Stevens assisted his fellow composer Alan Bush with the WMA Singers in the first three World Festivals of Youth in Prague (1947), Budapest (1949), and Berlin (1951). After Bush's opera <span class="italic">Wat Tyler</span> had been nominated a prizewinner at the 1951 opera competition to mark the Festival of Britain, Stevens conducted its first concert performance, with the composer at the piano. Stevens's own entry for the competition, a three-act work entitled <span class="italic">Mimosa</span> with a libretto by Montagu Slater, was left incomplete, although he later collaborated with Slater on a song cycle <span class="italic">The Palatine Coast</span>, op. 21 (which incorporated some of the musical ideas of the larger work), and in 1948 wrote the music for the film <span class="italic">Once a Jolly Swagman</span>, based on Slater's novel. In the same year he was appointed to a professorship of harmony, counterpoint, and composition at the Royal College of Music, a post he held until 1981 while combining this work with a similar post at the University of London from 1967; he gained the Cambridge MusD degree in 1968. As successor to his former professor R. O. Morris, he was responsible for a number of Morris's own pupils and for many of the new generation of composers, including Michael Finnissy, who remembered Stevens as exceptionally well informed: &#145;what he taught were not methods but principles&#146;  (Brougham, Fox, and Pace, 7).<br>
<br>In 1952, after living in Chelsea and Belsize Park, London, Stevens and his wife settled at The Forge, Great Maplestead, Essex, where he remained for the rest of his life. His daughter Catherine, born on 30 October 1952, became a professional viola player and was the dedicatee of his unaccompanied <span class="italic">Improvisation</span> for the instrument. Much of Stevens's output consisted of chamber music, notably a <span class="italic">Theme and Variations</span> (1949) in one movement for string quartet, which closes with a fugue based on an entirely new subject. Another influence, that of the Elizabethans, is manifest in his <span class="italic">Fantasia on Giles Farnaby's Dream</span> for piano and <span class="italic">Fantasia on a Theme of Dowland</span> for violin and piano (both 1953) and <span class="italic">Introduction, Variations, and Fugue on a Theme of Giles Farnaby</span> for orchestra (1972). Other important works include a cello concerto for William Pleeth (1951), a piano concerto for Kendall Taylor (1955) which was fully revised before his death, a second symphony, a <span class="italic">Dance Suite</span> for orchestra (1957), influenced by B&eacute;la Bart&oacute;k and dedicated to Edmund Rubbra, and two cantatas, <span class="italic">The Pilgrims of Hope</span> (1956), to words by William Morris, and <span class="italic">Et resurrexit</span> (1969), dedicated to the memory of Randall Swingler, whose final poem provides most of the text. Stevens also wrote an illuminating chapter on the Soviet Union for Howard Hartog's <span class="italic">European Music in the Twentieth Century</span> (1957). Following his rejection of Marxism, he sought solace in the rarefied spirituality espoused by the Jesuit priest and scientist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, and in 1981 he set John Donne's &#145;Death be not proud&#146; for a concert celebrating the centenary of de Chardin's birth.<br>
<br>Cancer had been diagnosed by 1978, but progress of the disease was slow and left Stevens time to complete his one-act chamber opera <span class="italic">The Shadow of the Glen</span> (1979, based on the play by J. M. Synge), much of which was written in Minorca. He died, survived by his wife, on 3 January 1983 in the Essex County Hospital, Colchester, and was cremated at Chelmsford. Before interment, a memorial service was held at Great Maplestead with readings and music, including a transcription of Stevens's own <span class="italic">Elegiac Fugue on the Name Geraldine</span> (1981), written in memory of Geraldine Swingler (<i>d</i>. 1980).<br>
