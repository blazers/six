<span class="headword">Horniblow <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Dalton]</span>,  (Emilie) Hilda</span>  (1886&#150;1950), <span class="occ">chief controller of Queen Mary's Army Auxiliary Corps and educationist</span>, was born at Sheep Street, Charlbury, Oxfordshire, on 24 June 1886, the daughter of Frederick Thomas Horniblow, stationer, and his wife, Sarah Ellen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McCulloch. She was educated at Oxford high school from May 1901 until July 1902 and at University College, Reading, from 15 October 1907 to 1 July 1908. By 1914 she was assistant mistress at the municipal school, Westwood, Scarborough.<br>
<br>Horniblow temporarily left teaching during the First World War, joined the Women's Legion, and in August 1915 became superintendent of three kitchens, each catering for 1000 men, at Sommerdown convalescent camp, Eastbourne. After demonstrating her &#145;able leadership&#146; there  (Cowper, 11) she took over the running of the officers' mess at Lydd, Kent, in September 1916. By February 1917 she had been made deputy to Florence Leach, controller-in-chief of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC), which subsumed the women's legion, and became assistant controller of cooks. The WAAC was renamed Queen Mary's Army Auxiliary Corps (QMAAC) on 9 April 1917, when the queen accepted the title of commander-in-chief. Later in that year Horniblow was promoted chief controller of the QMAAC, on secondment to the American expeditionary force in France. She arrived at Le Havre on 9 July and on 11 July went from a new base depot at Harfleur to Tours. There, on 29 July, she and her detachment were inspected by General Pershing. On 23 September she took charge of her camp at the American record office, Bourges, where she commanded what was ultimately a 1000-strong detachment assigned to the United States army. In July 1918 she was recalled to London to replace Mrs Long, chief controller in England of the QMAAC, who had been killed when the Red Cross ship on which she was travelling was torpedoed. Horniblow was appointed OBE (1918) and CBE (military, 1919).<br>
<br>After the war Horniblow became headmistress of Fair Street (London county council) women's evening institute and then, in 1935, was made staff inspector for women's subjects in technical institutions. On 20 December 1941 she married a widower, John Edwin Dalton (<i>b</i>. 1875/6) OBE, a retired inspector of schools, of Menston-in-Wharfedale, Yorkshire. Hilda Dalton retired in 1942, and died at her home&#151;5 The Crescent, Menston, Ilkley&#151;on 2 January 1950. She was survived by her husband.<br>
