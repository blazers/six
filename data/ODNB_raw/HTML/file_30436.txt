<span class="headword">Hind,  Richard Dacre  Archer-</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Richard Dacre Hodgson]</span>  (1849&#150;1910), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born at Morris Hall, near Norham, Northumberland, on 18 September 1849 and came of an ancient Northumbrian family. He was the third and youngest son of Thomas Hodgson (1814&#150;1911), a learned horticulturist and graduate of Trinity College, Cambridge, and his wife, Mary Ann, his first cousin and second daughter of John Thomas Huntley, vicar of Kimbolton. On the death of a brother in 1869, his father succeeded to the estates of Stelling and Ovington and assumed the surname of Archer-Hind. Richard Hodgson received his early teaching in Latin and Greek from his father, and even when he was at Shrewsbury School (1862&#150;8), where he was the pupil of Dr B. H. Kennedy and Dr H. W. Moss, his father continued to assist his studies. In 1868 he went into residence at Trinity College, Cambridge, living with his parents, who established themselves at Cambridge, as they had at Shrewsbury, so that he could enjoy the comforts of a home life while pursuing his education. He was elected to a college foundation scholarship in 1869 and to a Craven university scholarship in 1871. In 1872 he was placed third in the first class of the classical tripos and won the first chancellor's medal for classical learning. He was elected to a fellowship in his college in October 1873 and was appointed assistant lecturer in April 1877 and assistant tutor in December 1878. On 17 March 1888 he married Laura, youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22424/', "Lewis Pocock")</script>. At Easter 1899 he was made a senior lecturer, and in December 1903 he retired from the staff. During the last two years of his life Archer-Hind was an invalid. He died at his home, 2 Gonville Place, Cambridge, on 6 April 1910. He was cremated at Golders Green, and his ashes were buried at Cambridge. He was survived by his widow and one son, Laurence, born in 1895.<br>
<br>Both in Latin and in Greek the exceptional quality of Archer-Hind's scholarship was recognized from the beginning of his Cambridge career. But Greek came to interest him more than Latin. At a later time, while his love of Pindar, Aeschylus, and Sophocles never diminished, his admiration for Plato grew. In 1883 he published an edition of the <span class="italic">Phaedo</span>, in which he investigated the argument of the dialogue and traced its relations to the rest of Plato's writings. A second edition appeared in 1894. In 1888 he brought out his <i>magnum opus</i>, an original and complete edition of the difficult, important, and at that time still neglected <span class="italic">Timaeus</span>, which gave a new impetus to Platonic studies. The translation is exact and scholarly; the commentary is helpful, learned, many-sided; and in the introduction Archer-Hind sets out the results of his profound study of Plato's metaphysic. After a century his views on difficult passages in the Greek text are still taken seriously. Papers in the <span class="italic">Journal of Philology</span> (especially 24, 1896, 49; 29, 1904, 266; 31, 1910, 84) supplemented the editions of the <span class="italic">Phaedo</span> and the <span class="italic">Timaeus</span>.<br>
<br>An industrious teacher and a singularly efficient examiner, Archer-Hind took no prominent part in the affairs of the university; but his occasional allocutions at university discussions and college meetings were incisive and epigrammatic. He was always an earnest supporter of the movement for the education of women, and gave much time to the affairs of Newnham College and the instruction of its students. He loved his garden, and kept an exact record of the rare plants which it contained. He took a passionate interest in music; his knowledge of certain favourite composers was intimate and minute. He had made a careful study of Greek music. Like many of his academic generation he was a member of the Alpine Club. His quiet, retiring manner covered strong convictions tenaciously held.<br>
