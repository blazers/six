<span class="headword">Sharp <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Nevinson]</span>,  Evelyn Jane</span>  (1869&#150;1955), <span class="occ">children's writer and suffragette</span>, was born in Denmark Hill, London, on 4 August 1869, the ninth of eleven children, nine of whom survived beyond childhood, of Jane (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Bloyd) (1829?&#150;1915) and John James Sharp (<i>c</i>.1827&#150;1903), slate merchant. Her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36040/', "Cecil Sharp")</script> was the folk song and dance expert. In 1928 Evelyn wrote a book on the origin of dance, <span class="italic">Here we go round</span>.<br>
<br>The youngest of the four girls, Evelyn Sharp was taught by sisters until she was about twelve, then attended school in London for three years; she studied at the Coll&egrave;ge de France, Paris from 1890. Many of her children's stories from <span class="italic">The Youngest Girl in the School</span> (1901) onwards reflect her own happy schooldays as a boarder. Her family discouraged her wish to go to university. Neither did they approve of this clever young woman with big, expressive brown eyes earning her own living in London. In 1894 she taught, writing stories at night in her London hostel&#151;perhaps similar to the one depicted in her novel <span class="italic">The Making of a Prig</span> (1897). She had already written one novel at home. In 1895 John Lane published <span class="italic">At the Relton Arms</span>, its jacket designed by Beardsley, and the first of six short stories appeared in the <span class="italic">Yellow Book</span>. Evelyn joined the group of writers associated with these infamous volumes.<br>
<br>Evelyn Sharp's first publication had been a non-fictional defence of fairy tales. Her appeal to children's imaginations, to &#145;the marvellous in their minds&#146;  (E. Sharp, <span class="italic">Fairy Tales as they are, as they were and as they should be</span>, 1889, 2) lay behind much of her subsequent success. <span class="italic">Wymps and other Fairy Tales</span> (1896) was the first of over twenty books and hundreds of short stories which treated children as creative, intelligent beings. Despite (or perhaps because of) the fact that Evelyn never had children of her own, she appeared to possess empathy with the child's perception of the world, depicting &#145;grown ups&#146; as the mysterious, irrational ones. Her fairy stories and schoolgirl tales were neither patronizing nor moralistic though they reflect her own increasingly progressive views on gender, class, internationalism, and peace. In the 1920s she wrote an account of educational opportunities for London children and in 1931 reported on the International Conference on African Children in Geneva run by Save the Children International Union. Evelyn became a prolific journalist, writing for papers such as the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> (as its first regular women's page writer), <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span> (on their staff between 1915 and 1923), and <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span> (supplying daily features and stories for children in the 1930s). She became a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. Her stories combined a strong social purpose with a persistent sense of humour.<br>
<br>Evelyn Sharp had been converted to women's suffrage in 1906 after a speech given by the writer and former actress Elizabeth Robins. She now found that &#145;freedom, directly you discover you haven't got it, will not wait another minute&#146;  (Sharp, <span class="italic">Unfinished Adventure</span>, 128). From the non-militants she graduated to the Women's Social and Political Union, lectured for them in Denmark and became secretary of the Kensington branch. She was briefly imprisoned in 1911 and 1913, recuperating from forcible feeding with the physicist Dr Hertha Ayrton. In 1926 she published a 300-page memoir of Dr Ayrton at the request of her daughter Barbara Gould. Barbara, along with Dr Louisa Garrett Anderson, was one of many friends Evelyn gained in the suffrage years: she carefully included friendships among her list of recreations. She worked with Barbara Gould in the United Suffragists which played a pivotal part in securing the partial victory of votes for some women in 1918.<br>
<br>During the war Evelyn Sharp edited the women's suffrage journal <span class="italic">Votes for Women</span>. She also refused to pay taxes. Her furniture was distrained. She was only discharged from bankruptcy in 1918 once she was assured of taxation <i>with</i> representation. She also joined the Labour Party. She had been refused permission to go to the Women's International Congress at The Hague. The war had confirmed her pacifist tendencies. Although she never joined the Society of Friends, she worked for them in war-ravaged Germany in 1921, also visiting famine areas of Russia in the 1920s with their relief committee.<br>
<br>Since the early 1900s Evelyn Sharp had enjoyed a close relationship with her fellow journalist and lover of social justice and travel <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35206/', "Henry Woodd Nevinson (1856&#150;1941)")</script>. Whether on excursions organized by their Saturday walking club, urging women's suffrage, denouncing the excesses of the Black and Tans in Ireland or reporting from Germany in 1923 on the French occupation of the Ruhr, they were constant companions. Continually confounding expectations, Evelyn ended her autobiography, written in her sixties, with the observation that she might now be expected to &#145;put on a cap and settle down to enjoy a spinster's twilight&#146;. Instead, on 18 January 1933, the day she completed this book, she married the seventy-five-year-old Henry who had recently been widowed. They spent seven years together in Hampstead before bombs drove them to the Cotswolds where Henry died in 1941. Evelyn returned to living alone in London flats as she had done for most of her adult life. Depression and failing eye sight made her final years tough ones. She died in Methuen Nursing Home, 13 Gunnersbury Avenue, Ealing, London, on 17 June 1955.<br>
