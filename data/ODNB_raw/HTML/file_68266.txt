<span class="headword">Allen,  Robert</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1582&#150;1612), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious writer</span>, was probably the Robert Alen who matriculated as a sizar at Pembroke College, Cambridge, at Easter 1582 and graduated BA in 1585&#150;6 and MA in 1589. In the epistle dedicatory to <span class="italic">The Doctrine of the Gospel</span> (1606) he says that he has been catechizing during a ministry of twenty years, which accords with a graduation date of 1585&#150;6. During his career he ministered to churches in small villages, including Culford, Suffolk, north of Bury St Edmunds, of which he had been deprived for nonconformity by 7 August 1605, when his successor was installed.<br>
<br>Allen was one of at least fifteen Suffolk ministers who were authors in the years round 1600. His first book, <span class="italic">An Alphabet of the Holy Proverbs of King Salomon</span> (1596), which was intended for household use, provides brief expositions of the more difficult proverbs, compares translations of selected ones, and includes an epistle dedicatory to Thomas, fourth Lord Wentworth, and Robert Rich, the future second earl of Warwick. Allen published two works in 1600, one of which, <span class="italic">A Treatise of Beneficence</span>, was completed at Culford in May and dedicated to Sir John Popham, lord chief justice and privy councillor. In it Allen praises the <span class="roman">Vagrancy Act</span> of 1598, castigates vagabonds as dangerous and unworthy of relief, urges charity for deserving poor, and buttresses his argument with mostly classical quotations, especially from Seneca. This book was reprinted in 1603 as <span class="italic">The Oderifferous Garden of Charitie</span>. In 1600 Allen also published <span class="italic">A Treasurie of Catechisme, or, Christian Instruction</span>, with an epistle dedicatory to his patron, Sir Nicholas Bacon, and his wife, Lady Anne. A substantial book of 308 pages, <span class="italic">A Treasurie</span> was intended for catechists and mature Christians rather than children and uneducated believers. Its coverage includes social themes ranging from marriage and sexual matters to landlord&#150;tenant relations and appropriate conduct for lawyers.<br>
<br>Bacon was still Allen's patron when the latter completed <span class="italic">The Doctrine of the Gospel</span>, a work of 998 pages in three parts, which explicates &#145;what those things are which the faithfull Ministers of Jesus Christ doe beate their wittes about&#146;  (sig. *4<i>v</i>). Dedicated to the Bacons (Sir Nicholas, Lady Anne, Sir Nathaniel, Sir Francis, Sir Edmund, and Edward JP) this book too was written for mature believers, and also for fellow ministers, many of whom Allen had heard preach&#151;he likens himself to a bee that has extracted honey from their works. One of those ministers, Richard Blackerby, contributed verses to conclude Allen's mammoth undertaking. By this time Allen was suffering from ill health, but he continued to write. In 1608 he saw a work by a deceased fellow minister, Robert Pricke, through the press; entitled <span class="italic">A Verie Godlie and Learned Sermon</span>, it had been preached at the funeral of Sir Edward and Lady Susan Lewkenor. Allen contributed an epistle to Pricke's son Timothy, a fellow pastor. The following year Allen shepherded another of Robert Pricke's works, <span class="italic">The Doctrine of Superioritie, and of Subjection</span>, through to publication. In an epistle to Sir Edward Lewkenor the younger, Sir Robert Lewkenor, Sir Robert Quarles, and four other gentlemen, Allen describes himself as a friend of Pricke's former congregation at Denham, Suffolk. Allen completed his final work, <span class="italic">Concordances of the Holy Proverbs of King Salomon: and of his Like Sentences in Ecclesiastes</span>, on 20 July 1612; it groups verses according to a wide variety of themes. There is no further reference to him, and it is not known when he died.<br>
