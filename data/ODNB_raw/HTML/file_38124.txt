<span class="headword">Whiteside,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1679, <em>d.</em> 1729), <span class="occ">museum curator and experimental philosopher</span>, was born in Kirkham, Lancashire, and baptized on 2 November 1679, the son of George Whiteside, glazier, of Kirkham, and his wife, Margaret. He entered Brasenose College, Oxford, on 16 May 1696, and graduated BA in 1700 and MA in 1704. He took holy orders, and was subsequently chaplain of Christ Church, Oxford (from 1713), and absentee vicar of King's Walden, Hertfordshire.<br>
<br>On 14 December 1714 Whiteside was elected keeper of the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. His dedication to his duties, and his cultivation of friends and benefactors, helped to consolidate the museum's reputation, both antiquarian and scientific. He restored its administrative and accounting systems and revived (though not thoroughly) the documentation of its collections, all of which his predecessor had neglected. He took special interest in the numismatic collection, rehung the museum's pictures, and made the library more useful and accessible to scholars.<br>
<br>In the museum's lecture room about 1715 Whiteside began to hold courses of experimental philosophy, similar to those recently pioneered by John Keill in Oxford and William Whiston in London. For this purpose he built up at his own expense a large collection of apparatus, which by 1723 he valued at &pound;400. In that year he extended his syllabus by adding architecture, magnetics, and astronomy to the standard topics of mechanics, hydrostatics, pneumatics, and optics. He was a keen astronomer, and two of his observations were communicated to the Royal Society by Edmond Halley. On at least one occasion, in 1720, he also taught a chemistry course.<br>
<br>Whiteside was elected FRS on 3 July 1718. In 1721 he was an unsuccessful candidate for the chair of astronomy at Oxford. He was highly esteemed as an experimental philosopher: his courses had considerable influence, and were continued after his death by James Bradley. He was thus the founder of physics teaching at Oxford University.<br>
<br>Whiteside moderated his obvious industriousness with a love of convivial drinking, gossip, and good humour. From 1715 he was a close friend of the diarist Thomas Hearne, who recorded various insights into his character. He never married, notwithstanding his &#145;great Affection&#146; for Deborah Wrench. He died in Oxford on 22 October 1729, as a result of gangrene following a fall from his horse during a visit to his Hertfordshire parish, though he blamed his illness on &#145;drinking a pretty deal of bad small beer&#146;. He was buried in Christ Church Cathedral.<br>
