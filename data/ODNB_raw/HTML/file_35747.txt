<span class="headword">Riddell,  Charles James Buchanan</span>  (1817&#150;1903), <span class="occ">army officer and geophysicist</span>, born at Lilliesleaf, Roxburghshire, on 19 November 1817, was the third son of Sir John Buchanan Riddell, ninth baronet, and his wife, Lady Frances Marsham, eldest daughter of Charles Marsham, first earl of Romney. With the exception of a year at Eton College, Riddell was educated at private schools. In 1832 he entered the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, passing thence (1834) into the Royal Artillery as second lieutenant. The following year he was transferred to Quebec, and in 1837 received promotion as first lieutenant. After returning to England, he was ordered to Jamaica, but was invalided back a year later.<br>
<br>In 1839 Riddell began his scientific research. The Royal Society undertook to organize the British contribution to the worldwide survey of terrestrial magnetism initiated by Gauss; Riddell was chosen to superintend a magnetical and meteorological observatory at Toronto&#151;a temporary station nearest to the magnetic north pole&#151;under Edward Sabine. At the end of a year Riddell was invalided home, but he had done excellent service. Soon after, at Sabine's instance, he was appointed assistant superintendent of ordnance magnetic observatories at the Royal Military Repository, Woolwich. During his four years' tenure of this post he assisted Sabine in the reduction of magnetic data and the issue of results of observations made by the directors of the affiliated observatories. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 13 January 1842. In 1844 the Admiralty issued Riddell's <span class="italic">Magnetical instructions for the use of portable instruments adapted for magnetical surveys and portable observatories, and for the use of a set of small instruments for a fixed magnetic observatory</span>.<br>
<br>Riddell was placed on the staff at Woolwich and during the Crimean War he was an efficient deputy assistant quartermaster-general. He served in the Indian mutiny in 1857&#150;8, commanding the siege artillery of Outram's force at the siege and capture of Lucknow, and the artillery of Lugard's column at the engagement of the Tigree; he was three times mentioned in dispatches, was made a CB, and received the medal with clasps. He retired in 1866 with the rank of major-general. Afterwards he lived quietly at Oaklands, Chudleigh, Devon, where he owned and managed a farm, and undertook parochial and educational work. Riddell married, on 11 February 1847, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1900), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24119/', "Sir Hew Dalrymple Ross")</script>; they had one daughter. He died at his home on 25 January 1903, and was buried at Chudleigh.<br>
