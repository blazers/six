<span class="headword">&AElig;thelberht I</span>  (<em>d.</em> 616?), <span class="occ">king of Kent</span>, was the successor of his father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57750/', "King Eormenric (fl. 550x600)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52343/', "Kent, kings of")</script>], and a member of the Kentish royal dynasty, the Oiscingas, said to have been founded by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/203/', "&#198;sc")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52343/', "Kent, kings of")</script>], son of Hengist.<h2>
<a name="Chronologyofthereign"></a>Chronology of the reign</h2>It has generally been assumed that &AElig;thelberht became king in 560 or 561, on the basis of Bede's information that he ruled for fifty-six years and died on 24 February 616. This would have been a reign of quite exceptional length (no other Anglo-Saxon king is known to have ruled for so long), and there has been some suspicion that Bede's figures may not be entirely reliable; for instance, it has been suggested that fifty-six years properly applied to &AElig;thelberht's age at death, and not the length of his reign. Some reliance has been placed on two brief comments by Gregory of Tours in relation to the marriage between &AElig;thelberht and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2269/', "Bertha (b. c.565, d. in or after 601)")</script>, daughter of the Merovingian Frankish king Charibert, which is unlikely to have taken place before the mid-570s. In the first instance (which occurs in a part of Gregory's <span class="italic">Libri historiarum</span> probably written in 581 or before) Gregory says simply that Bertha married a certain Kentishman; in the second (composed <i>c</i>.589) he states that her husband was &#145;the son of a certain king in Kent&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of the Franks</span>, 9.26). The implication would seem to be that &AElig;thelberht was not yet king when he married Bertha (apparently between the mid-570s and 581) and that he may not have succeeded his father until after 589.<br>
<br>It is difficult to know how much weight to give to Gregory's comments. He was a contemporary, and he was a close associate of Bertha's mother; on the other hand, he clearly had little or no interest in Anglo-Saxon matters and may have been mistaken about &AElig;thelberht's status. The English sources (which may not be entirely independent of Bede) agree in giving &AElig;thelberht a very long reign. One version of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> mentions &AElig;thelberht's accession under the year 565 and states that he ruled for fifty-three years (<i>liii</i> is conceivably a scribal error for <i>lvi</i>). The annal for 568 in the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> mentions an incident in which the West Saxon rulers Ceawlin and Cutha fought against &AElig;thelberht and drove him into Kent. This may have been another man, perhaps a recalcitrant West Saxon princeling; but if it was the more celebrated &AElig;thelberht, then it would appear that already in 568 he was in a position to lead an army into a neighbouring kingdom. A possible explanation for the discrepancy between Gregory and the English sources is that &AElig;thelberht was appointed co-ruler or sub-king during his father's lifetime, but did not have full power until Eormenric's death; but this seems incapable of proof.<h2>
<a name="ConversiontoChristianity"></a>Conversion to Christianity</h2>The most important episode in &AElig;thelberht's reign was the arrival in Kent in 597 (or possibly late 596) of a party of missionaries sent from Rome by Pope Gregory the Great [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93690', "Gregorian mission")</script>]. The king had already been exposed to Christianity for some years; his marriage to Bertha had been approved only on condition that she was permitted freely to practise her faith, and she had brought with her from her homeland a bishop named Liudhard (and presumably also a Christian retinue). Bede's account of the meeting between &AElig;thelberht and the missionaries stresses the king's suspicion of the new arrivals and indicates that he was still a committed pagan; but it is difficult to believe that the mission would have gone ahead without some kind of prior consent or request from &AElig;thelberht. He may have been bowing to pressure from his Frankish connections; certain letters of Pope Gregory hint at some Merovingian involvement in the decision to attempt the conversion of Kent (and the fact that the Franks had sent a bishop to Kent as Bertha's chaplain rather than a simple priest may indicate that they had already made some plans to evangelize the area). Certainly &AElig;thelberht received Augustine and his companions most graciously and very quickly agreed to be baptized. The exact date of his conversion remains uncertain; Bede at one stage says that it took place twenty-one years before &AElig;thelberht died (which would seem to be <i>before</i> Augustine's arrival in Kent). Certainly there is good reason to suppose that &AElig;thelberht was Christian by the end of 597, for in a letter of July 598 Pope Gregory boasts that up to Christmas of the previous year Augustine had made ten thousand English converts; such mass conversions are unlikely to have taken place until after the king had accepted Christianity.<h2>
<a name="Overlordship"></a>Overlordship</h2>Already at the time of Augustine's arrival &AElig;thelberht seems to have been to some degree acknowledged as overlord of all the English kingdoms south of the Humber. According to Bede, he was the third Anglo-Saxon ruler to enjoy such recognition; his predecessors had been &AElig;lle of the South Saxons, who probably lived in the fifth century, and Ceawlin of the West Saxons, who died about 593. The exact nature of &AElig;thelberht's overlordship is very unclear (it was probably in the main a question of military leadership), but certain episodes in Bede's narrative do indicate that he had some authority outside the boundaries of Kent. It was apparently with &AElig;thelberht's help that Augustine summoned the bishops of the Britons for a conference at &#145;Augustine's Oak&#146;, which appears to have been located somewhere on the border between the modern counties of Gloucestershire and Wiltshire or Somerset (possibly &AElig;thelberht did no more than provide a safe conduct or an escort). &AElig;thelberht appears to have dominated the kingdom of the East Saxons, ruled in the early seventh century by his nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24996/', "S&#230;berht (d. 616/17)")</script>, son of his sister Ricule; he superintended the conversion of the East Saxons and built the church of St Paul's in London as an episcopal seat for Mellitus. &AElig;thelberht's relations with R&aelig;dwald of East Anglia are more difficult to define. Bede identifies R&aelig;dwald as the fourth of the Southumbrian overlords, and adds an obscure comment which has been translated as indicating that R&aelig;dwald began to enjoy this position before &AElig;thelberht died; a preferable interpretation may be that during &AElig;thelberht's lifetime R&aelig;dwald retained the military leadership of the East Angles, which would normally have devolved upon the Southumbrian overlord. It seems probable that R&aelig;dwald was first introduced to Christianity while in attendance at &AElig;thelberht's court.<h2>
<a name="KingshipontheFrankishmodel"></a>Kingship on the Frankish model</h2>In Kent itself &AElig;thelberht was responsible for a number of important innovations. Perhaps as early as 602&#150;3 he compiled with his advisers a written law-code, which gave the fledgeling Kentish church a secure position within the kingdom but which was also concerned with a wide range of secular issues. As far as is known, the use of writing was effectively introduced into England by the Roman missionaries in 597; and so it is interesting that &AElig;thelberht's code was in English rather than Latin, since it implies that an almost immediate effort had been made to transform the native language from an oral to a written form. Presumably the vernacular was chosen for reasons of practicality and in order to stress continuity; &AElig;thelberht's written code was probably an extension of oral pronouncements previously made in assembly by himself and his predecessors. Bede says that &AElig;thelberht was here influenced by Roman example, but the real parallels for his legislation lie in the law-codes issued by the Germanic kings on the continent, including the Franks.<br>
<br>Another possible innovation on the part of &AElig;thelberht was the creation of a royal capital city at Canterbury. When Augustine arrived in 597 &AElig;thelberht gave him a dwelling-place in the city, which Bede describes as the <i>metropolis</i> or chief city of his realm and elsewhere as a &#145;royal city&#146;. To grasp the unusual nature of this statement it must be realized that in sixth-century England there is almost no evidence of any continuing urban life in the old Roman cities; virtually the whole population lived on the land, and the kings followed suit, making an itinerant progress from one royal estate to another. Canterbury itself would appear to have been essentially deserted for a long period during the fifth century, and population levels during the sixth are likely to have been very low. The idea that a sixth-century Anglo-Saxon kingdom might have a royal &#145;capital&#146; is certainly remarkable.<br>
<br>A third area where &AElig;thelberht seems to have made an important change which reflected on the nature of kingship in Kent is in the establishment of a royal burial church on the outskirts of Canterbury, St Peter and St Paul (which was to develop into St Augustine's Abbey); this was intended to provide a dynastic burial place for the kings of Kent, who were interred in a chapel dedicated to St Martin, and also to cater for the archbishops of Canterbury. This innovation marked a very significant break with the past, and underlined &AElig;thelberht's commitment to the new religion; it also seems to reflect an imitation of the burial practices of the Frankish royal dynasty (the connection is emphasized by the dedication of the royal burial chapel, for the cult of St Martin was closely associated with the Merovingians). It seems likely that in this instance &AElig;thelberht was influenced by the wishes and expectations of his Frankish queen, but there may well be a deeper level of aspiration involved. In accepting Christianity, perhaps establishing a capital, issuing a law-code, and creating a dynastic burial church, &AElig;thelberht was following in the footsteps of the Frankish king Clovis, who had effectively founded the fortunes of the Merovingians. Whether &AElig;thelberht saw himself as the English Clovis it is impossible to say, but it does seem likely that he was very influenced by Frankish ideas of kingship. His marriage to Bertha was not an isolated episode of cross-channel contact. Kent was an important Frankish trading partner, and the sixth-century Kentish cemeteries have yielded a profusion of Frankish and Frankish-style luxury grave-goods. And &AElig;thelberht's marriage may not have been the first alliance between the Merovingians and the Oiscingas; his father Eormenric had a name of distinctively Frankish type. There is a controversial hypothesis that Kent and other kingdoms of southern England were in fact under Merovingian overlordship during parts of the sixth and seventh centuries. Certainly there are hints that the Frankish kings did like to think that they should enjoy some kind of hegemony over their neighbours, but it is debatable whether this was ever translated into reality in southern England. It is particularly hard to credit in the case of &AElig;thelberht, whose power over his own neighbours seems incompatible with subordination to the Merovingians.<h2>
<a name="Deathburialandsuccession"></a>Death, burial, and succession</h2>Bede's date for &AElig;thelberht's death (24 February 616) is probably correct, although it has been pointed out that some early annals give an obit in 618 (presumably this is to be connected with the information behind the later annal in text E of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> which gives an accession date in 565 and a reign length of fifty-six years). &AElig;thelberht was buried in the new royal mausoleum at Canterbury; an unofficial cult seems to have developed and from the thirteenth century his name appears in calendars. According to later sources at St Augustine's, Bertha (who appears to have taken the Anglo-Saxon name &AElig;thelburh after her arrival in England) died before her husband, and before the new burial church was consecrated; she was buried outside and later transferred into the royal burial chapel. &AElig;thelberht appears to have married again (at a very venerable age, if the traditional date for his accession is correct) or to have had a concubine, for after his death his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8375/', "Eadbald (d. 640)")</script> married his father's widow (that is, his stepmother), to the consternation of the Roman missionaries. &AElig;thelberht's known offspring are Eadbald, who succeeded him, and a daughter, &AElig;thelburh (also known as Tate), who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8567/', "King Eadwine")</script> of the Northumbrians in 625. Some Kentish sources also credit him with another daughter named Eadburh, said to have been buried in the minster at Lyminge (but there may be confusion here with a later Abbess Eadburh of Minster in Thanet).<br>
<br>There are five surviving charters in &AElig;thelberht's name, three from St Augustine's and one each from the episcopal archives at St Paul's in London and Rochester. None is authentic, or has any genuine basis.<br>
