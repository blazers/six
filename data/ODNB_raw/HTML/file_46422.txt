<span class="headword">Hoggan <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Morgan]</span>,  Frances Elizabeth</span>  (1843&#150;1927), <span class="occ">physician and social reformer</span>, was born on 20 December 1843 at the vicarage, Brecon, the eldest of the five children of Richard Morgan (<i>d</i>. 1851) and his wife, Georgiana Catherina Philipps. Her early childhood was spent mainly in Aberafan, where her father was vicar from 1845 until his death in 1851. Thereafter her family home continued to be in Wales although she attended a girls' school in Windsor from the age of ten. She was then allowed to study in Paris in 1858 and in D&uuml;sseldorf in 1861, where she formed the ambition to become a doctor.<br>
<br>By 1866 Morgan was receiving private medical tuition in London intending to follow the precedent set by Elizabeth Garrett (later Garrett Anderson), who in 1863 had obtained the licence of the Society of Apothecaries, so becoming the first woman trained in Britain to appear on the General Medical Council's register. Garrett provided clinical instruction for Morgan at the St Mary's Dispensary for Women and Children in Marylebone, London. Morgan passed the Society of Apothecaries' preliminary examination in arts with honours in January 1867. But soon afterwards the society revised its licence regulations so as to exclude would-be candidates who had had only private, rather than regular, medical school instruction. This effectively excluded women from the medical register as all British medical schools (and all other British medical qualifications) appeared firmly closed to them.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1867 Morgan went to Z&uuml;rich University where the Russian Nadezhda Suslova was about to become the first female medical graduate. Morgan's academic achievements in Z&uuml;rich were to become legendary. She completed the medical course in three years rather than the expected five. Staff and fellow students were impressed with the &#145;seriousness, the aristocratic calm and the royal superiority of this remarkable girl&#146;  (Bonner, 38). In March 1870, she was only the second woman to defend an MD thesis (on progressive muscular atrophy) before the entire medical faculty of Z&uuml;rich University. More than 400 spectators watched her do so with consummate skill and become the first British woman to obtain a European MD degree.<br>
<br>After graduating Morgan travelled to Vienna, Prague, and then Paris to further her clinical training and then set up in practice at 13 Granville Place, London, as a qualified but unregistered medical practitioner. In March 1871 she was appointed by Elizabeth Garrett as the first assistant physician to St Mary's Dispensary and then to its successor, the New Hospital for Women, when it opened in 1872.<br>
<br>On 1 April 1874, Morgan married George Hoggan (1837&#150;1891), a former engineer with the Indian navy, who had graduated in medicine from Edinburgh University in 1872. For the next decade Frances and George Hoggan practised together from different rooms in the same building and jointly published several scientific papers&#151;for example, &#145;Notes of a case of transfusion by Aveling's apparatus&#146;  (<span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span>, 31 March 1877). They had no children.<br>
<br>Frances Hoggan's irregular position as a practising but unregistered medical practitioner was resolved in 1877 when the King and Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland opened its licentiate examinations to women. In the meantime the British Medical Association had declared her election to the association as void on the grounds of her unregistered status when elected. In 1878 she resigned as assistant physician at the New Hospital for Women, apparently unhappy at the extent of high risk abdominal surgery, including ovariotomy, being undertaken by Garrett Anderson. A conservative stance towards abdominal surgery would have been in accord with Hoggan's active support for preventive health measures and moral and sanitary reform in preference to heroic curative interventions. In 1871 Hoggan, with her close friend Elizabeth Blackwell, the first woman on the medical register, was co-founder and also honorary secretary of the National Health Society, which aimed to promote sanitary education under the motto &#145;prevention is better than cure&#146;. Between 1875 and 1885 Hoggan published pamphlets and read papers at many conferences on such topics as the physical education of girls and the benefits of swimming to women's health. Her 1883 pamphlet <span class="italic">On the Advantages of a Vegetarian Diet in Workhouses and Prisons</span> advocated the withdrawal of meat from inmates' diets on grounds of economy and the moral benefits ensuing from restricting habitual criminals' and paupers' sensual gratification.<br>
<br>In the mid-1870s Hoggan and her husband's championing of the anti-vivisectionist cause kept her name in the public eye. A letter from George Hoggan, published in the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> on 2 February 1875, described in emotive terms his experiences during four months working in Claude Bernard's Paris laboratories. The letter fuelled the developing campaign against animal experiments being orchestrated in particular by Frances Power Cobbe. The Hoggans were founder members of Cobbe's Victoria Street Society for the Protection of Animals Liable to Vivisection from 1875. As qualified doctors with some first-hand experience of animal experimentation their support was particularly valued by anti-vivisectionists. However, they resigned in 1878 when, under Cobbe's leadership, the Victoria Street Society adopted a policy committed to total abolition of all animal experiments whereas the Hoggans' opposition appears to have been only to painful experiments.<br>
<br>Frances Hoggan was also publicly active in the women's movement. She promoted better education for girls, for example, in <span class="italic">Education for Girls in Wales</span> (1882) and, particularly, the case for medical women. Here too she was not afraid to court public controversy. While at Edinburgh University, George Hoggan had been an ardent supporter of the rights of his fellow female medical students, the so-called &#145;Edinburgh Seven&#146;, to obtain a full medical education. But in an essay on &#145;Women in medicine&#146; published in T. Stanton, ed., <span class="italic">The Woman Question in Europe</span> (1884), Frances Hoggan and her husband were highly critical of Sophia Jex-Blake's confrontational tactics in the later stages of the Edinburgh campaign, alleging they had been counter-productive compared to the uneventful but real progress made by those such as Frances Hoggan herself, who had studied in London and abroad.<br>
<br>Between 1881 and 1885 Hoggan campaigned actively for medical women in India, where religious proscriptions precluded many women from seeking medical advice from male doctors. Through articles in the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span> (August 1881) and on &#145;Medical work for women in India&#146; in the <span class="italic">Englishwoman's Review</span> (15 April and 15 May 1885), and in many speeches, she argued that priority should be given to opening medical schools for Indian women rather than training British women to go to India. This position created some tension between her and medical women at the London School of Medicine for Women, who were actively raising funds for scholarships for women planning to work in India to train at the school.<br>
<br>In 1885 George Hoggan's health broke down and the couple moved to the French riviera. Frances Hoggan returned to London after his death in May 1891. Although she did not resume medical practice she continued to take an active interest in a range of contemporary social issues including the women's suffrage campaign and racial inequalities in the United States and southern Africa. She spent her last years in Brighton, where she died in a nursing home at 13 Clarence Square, on 5 February 1927. Her body was cremated at Woking on 9 February.<br>
