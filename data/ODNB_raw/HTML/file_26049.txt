<span class="headword">Southcote,  John</span>  (1510/11&#150;1585), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the son of William Southcote and Alice Tregonwell, a niece of the civilian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27683/', "John Tregonwell")</script>. The Southcotes were a Devon family. William's father, Nicholas, lived at Chudleigh, and William's brother John (<i>d</i>. 1556), clerk of the peace for Devon, lived at Bovey Tracey. There is some evidence that the younger John Southcote lived for a time at Bodmin in Cornwall. He was admitted to the Middle Temple between 1535 and 1537, probably after studying at Lyon's Inn, which sued a John Southcote (possibly his uncle) for dues in 1543. In 1553 he was twice returned to parliament, by Lewes and Steyning respectively. By that time he had settled in London and been appointed one of the under-sheriffs, which made him a judge of the sheriffs' court; and in 1554 he became a justice of the peace for Middlesex. It was about this time that he married Elizabeth, daughter of the London alderman William Robins. In 1556 he was elected autumn reader of the Middle Temple, and only two years later was offered the coif by Queen Mary. The writs for the serjeants' call abated on the queen's death, but Southcote's writ was renewed by Elizabeth and he was created serjeant in April 1559, having read for a second time in Lent as serjeant-elect.<br>
<br>On 10 February 1563 Southcote was appointed a justice of the queen's bench, and from about that time began to acquire an estate at Witham, Essex, where he lived until his death. In 1575 he purchased Petworth's in Witham, and it is believed that he was responsible for building Witham Place there soon afterwards. He also had a well-furnished house in Carter Lane in the parish of St Gregory by Paul, London. He served as a puisne judge under Sir Robert Catlin and Sir Christopher Wray, and his opinions were noted by Plowden, Dyer, and other Elizabethan reporters. Coke related a story that when Chief Justice Catlin suggested altering a record, Southcote refused to assent, &#145;and said openly, that he meant not to build a clock-house&#146;  (Coke, <span class="italic">Third Institute</span>, 72), referring to the legend that a fine imposed on Chief Justice Hengham in the time of Edward I was reputedly used to build the clock house of Westminster Palace. He served as an assize judge on the home circuit for twenty years, even though the circuit included Essex. He retired from circuit work in 1582, and was formally discharged from his judicial office on 1 June 1584. Although there was a family tradition that he had resigned to avoid condemning a priest, there is no contemporary evidence of recusancy and he may simply have been allowed to retire on grounds of illness or age. He died on 18 April 1585 and was buried at Witham, where there is a grand monument with his effigy in judicial robes. The inscription gives his age at death as seventy-four and records that he had thirteen children, but only one son, John, and two daughters survived him. He was remembered as &#145;a good natured man &hellip; governed by his wife&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1509&#150;58</span>, 3.351).<br>
