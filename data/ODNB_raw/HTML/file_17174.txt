<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lumley,  Benjamin</span>  (1811/12&#150;1875), <span class="occ">opera manager and author</span>, was the son of Louis Levy, a Jewish merchant of Canada, who died in London about 1831. Benjamin Levy assumed the name Lumley early in life. After being educated at King Edward's School at Birmingham, he was admitted a solicitor in London in 1832. Within a few years he was solicitor to the Herne Bay Steam Packet Company and had separate chambers as a parliamentary agent. He was studying for the bar when, in 1835&#150;6, Pierre-Fran&ccedil;ois Laporte, manager of Her Majesty's Theatre, employed him first on legal and then on financial business. For five years he worked as Laporte's assistant, and after the latter's death (on 25 September 1841) he took over as manager from 1842. Her Majesty's Theatre had practically been the sole home of Italian opera since its establishment in England. When Lumley took over, the repertory was all Italian as to language and largely Italian in provenance. Even more than in Italy the genre was dominated by virtuoso singers, in particular by the &#145;<span class="italic">Puritani</span> quartet&#146; of Giulia Grisi, G. B. Rubini (G. M. Mario soon stepping into his place), Antonio Tamburini, and Luigi Lablache, who together with Fanny Tacchinardi-Persiani were widely known as &#145;la vieille garde&#146;. Lumley was later blamed by J. E. Cox for having alienated these remarkable artists by choosing to show himself &#145;sole master &hellip; ostensibly and positively&#146;; he himself gloried in his &#145;policy of silence and reserve&#146; and enjoyed being known as &#145;l'homme myst&eacute;rieux&#146;. There is no sign that he was opposing the star system in general in the name of ensemble. He began by dropping Tamburini, with whom the management was already in dispute. In 1844 he made no effort to retain Persiani; a year later he seemed to show greater interest in ballet by setting up the famous <span class="italic">Pas de quatre</span> with Marie Taglioni, Carlotta Grisi, Fanny Cerrito, and Lucille Grahn. In 1846 he refused the demand of Michael Costa, the conductor, to be allowed to accept the conductorship of the Philharmonic Society's orchestra. Costa may have had other reasons for discontent&#151;his own music was not being performed often enough. He seceded, with Grisi, Mario, and the greater part of his fine orchestra, to the new Royal Italian Opera House at Covent Garden in 1847. Lablache alone remained faithful to Lumley.<br>
<br>Up to 1847 Lumley's management met with brilliant success. Among contemporary critics, often partisan, some credited him with &#145;revolutionizing&#146; a shabby system, but H. F. Chorley&#151;always hostile&#151;thought Costa's discipline had educated the audience to expect &#145;the entire performance &hellip; to be the real object of interest&#146;, and, once Costa left, Lumley's reliance on singers brought &#145;systematic deterioration&#146;. Lumley's cult of ballet was similarly controversial. Besides the four ballerinas already named, he engaged Fanny Elssler and the male dancers Perrot and St Leon, altogether an epitome of Romantic ballet. His success enabled him in 1845 to acquire the lease of Her Majesty's.<br>
<br>The opening of the rival opera house in 1847 imperilled Lumley's position. He replaced Costa with Michael Balfe and, for the 1847 season, engaged Jenny Lind, paying for her to break a previous contract and gradually overcoming her scruples. He also secured a new opera from the young Verdi (<span class="italic">I masnadieri</span>, a relative failure); an attempt to procure one from the more prestigious Mendelssohn foundered. From Lind's opening performance on 4 May, as Alice in Meyerbeer's <span class="italic">Robert le diable</span>, she exerted an extraordinary spell over the English public and temporarily saved Lumley from disaster. At the end of her third season at Her Majesty's, in 1849, she retired from the stage, and Lumley's financial embarrassment thenceforth grew rapidly. Far from relying on her alone, he engaged some of the leading Italian singers of the day, as well as the Germans Henriette Sontag and Sophie Cruvelli, who made a considerable impression; but, Marietta Alboni apart, his Italians failed to counter the prestige of Grisi and Mario, and Chorley may have been right in denouncing these seasons as undisciplined &#145;sham&#146;. Lumley attempted to keep up their social prestige by throwing lavish parties at his riverside house in Fulham, at which artists mingled with &#145;society&#146;. He also took the classic gambler's step of throwing good money after bad by taking on, from 1850, the winter season at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Italien in Paris; theoretically this fitted in with the London spring season, but in practice it was difficult to supervise both. Though subsidized, the Paris seasons suffered from political disturbances, cripplingly so after the December 1851 <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i>. Lumley lost at least &pound;14,400. In 1852 it is clear even from his disingenuous memoirs (<span class="italic">Reminiscences of the Opera</span>, 1864) that he was failing to pay his artists both in London and in Paris; they were leaving or, like Johanna Wagner, turning to the rival Covent Garden management (Lumley won the resulting lawsuit, but no damages). Various devices&#151;a subscribers' committee, formed to safeguard the wages of permanent staff, and an attempt at limited liability through an act of parliament&#151;failed. Lumley fled to Paris. Her Majesty's remained closed from 1853 to 1856. In the latter year the burning of Covent Garden led Lord Ward (later earl of Dudley) to reopen Her Majesty's. He bought up Lumley's debts and his lease and reinstalled him as manager and sub-lessee. Until 1858 Lumley secured some good singers, among them Alboni, Giuglini, and the young Therese Tietjens; his greatest draw was Marietta Piccolomini, less a singer than a personality for whom there was a craze. The commercial panic of 1857, however, influenced the receipts; it is again clear, between the lines of Lumley's account, that he owed Lord Ward rent, as well as earlier debts, and on 10 August 1858 he had to give up his sub-lease. In 1863, three benefit performances were given at Her Majesty's on his behalf.<br>
<br>The few new works put on under Lumley's management included, besides Verdi's, Hal&eacute;vy's <span class="italic">La tempesta</span>, loosely based on Shakespeare and notable chiefly for Lablache's Caliban. Operas by Costa and Sigismond Thalberg failed. The usual repertory of Bellini, Donizetti, and early Verdi (eight of whose works Lumley introduced to London) was supplemented with a little French grand opera by Meyerbeer and Auber.<br>
<br>Lumley perhaps did not deserve the description (by the singer Gilbert-Louis Duprez, <span class="italic">Souvenirs d'un chanteur</span>, 1880, 202) &#145;faiseur [crook or charlatan] habile et audacieux&#146;, but he seems to have left an ambiguous impression which his memoirs do not dispel.<br>
<br>After resigning Her Majesty's Theatre, he returned to the practice of law, and wrote several books. In 1838 he had published a standard book on <span class="italic">Parliamentary Practice on Passing Private Bills</span>. In 1862 appeared, published anonymously, a work of fiction, <span class="italic">Sirenia</span>, followed in 1873 by <span class="italic">Another World, or, Fragments from the Star City of Montallayah by Hermes</span>; both were experiments in what would later be called science fiction. <span class="italic">Another World</span> reached a third edition within a year. Lumley also published a pamphlet (1863) about his legal and financial disputes with Lord Dudley. He died, aged sixty-three and unmarried, at his home, 8 Kensington Crescent, London, on 17 March 1875, and was buried at West Ham.<br>
