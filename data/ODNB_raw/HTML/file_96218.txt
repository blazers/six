<span class="headword">Hodgson <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Rosenthal]</span>,  Miriam Ann</span>  (1938&#150;2005), <span class="occ">editor of children's books</span>, was born on 10 December 1938 at Denison House, Denison Road, Rusholme, Manchester, the only daughter of Erwin Isak Jacob Rosenthal (1904&#150;1991), Hebrew scholar and orientalist, and his wife, Elisabeth Charlotte, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Marx (1907&#150;1996). She had one older brother, Thomas Gabriel (Tom) Rosenthal (<i>b</i>. 1935), later chairman and chief executive of Andre Deutsch Ltd. Her parents, of Jewish descent, had fled Germany in 1933 and at the time of her birth her father was lecturer in Semitic languages and literature at the University of Manchester. In 1948 the family moved to Cambridge when her father was made a lecturer (later a reader) in oriental studies at the University of Cambridge. He published widely on both Judaism and Islam.<br>
<br>Miriam Rosenthal was educated at the Perse School for Girls, Cambridge, and then at St Anne's College, Oxford; she graduated with a third in modern history in 1960. She began her career working as an editor of adult books at Ernest Benn, which later became Associated Book Publishers. There she met her husband, Julian Russell Hodgson, then head of the education department, and son of John Hodgson, minister of religion. They married on 28 November 1969 at St Pancras register office. After the birth of her only child, Elinor, she returned to work in a new role working part-time as a children's books editor, which led to her becoming editorial director of publishing at Methuen Children's Books in 1986.<br>
<br>Passionate about the craft of writing, on which she said, &#145;I never cease to be in awe not only of my authors' achievements but also of the creative process of writing&#146;  (&#145;On being an editor&#146;), she was a gifted editor who inspired great loyalty from her authors. One of them, Annie Dalton, described her &#145;rare ability to befriend her authors whilst continuing to challenge us on every level. Her respect for the creative process is unique in my experience and her sensitivity is downright supernatural&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 6 Dec 2005). Hodgson herself defined the ideal relationship between editor and author as &#145;the touching of minds &hellip; The editor is the servant of the writer. He never dictates&#146;  (&#145;On being an editor&#146;). But there was one principle on which she felt that an editor could dictate to a children's author: &#145;The only condition an editor should impose is to remind the author that he is writing for children, who deserve to keep a belief in good defeating evil&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Following this principle, Hodgson guided many of the best children's writers of her time, including Anne Fine, Caroline Pitcher, Michelle Magorian, Michael Morpurgo, Carlo Gebler, Theresa Breslin, Jamila Gavin, Bel Mooney, Jenny Nimmo, and many others. The importance of her role in shaping these authors' books was evident in their tributes to her. &#145;It was her ability to see the gold among the dross; it was her ability to recognise talent: big talent, small talent, fragile talent; to see the one seed she felt she could nourish like a gardener&#146; that made her an outstanding editor, according to Jamila Gavin  (Gavin, &#145;Miriam Hodgson&#146;). Robert Westall dedicated <span class="italic">The Kingdom by the Sea</span> (1990) to &#145;Miriam, who understood&#146;, while a more robust editorial hand was revealed in Jean Ure's dedication of <span class="italic">Plague 99</span> (1989) &#145;To Miriam, who fought me womanfully every inch of the way&#146;. Under her guidance and nurture Hodgson's authors went on to win the Carnegie medal, the Nestl&eacute; Smarties prize, the <span class="italic">Guardian</span> children's book prize, and the Whitbread award.<br>
<br>In addition to editing the novels of others, Hodgson compiled anthologies of stories for teenagers, mostly by her own authors. These included <span class="italic">Heartache</span> (1991), <span class="italic">Mother's Day</span> (1992), <span class="italic">Mixed Feelings</span> (1997), and <span class="italic">Sisters</span> (1998). Following the sale of Methuen's children's book division to Egmont in 1998, she remained chief editor of Egmont's children's books for a further year before her formal retirement. (In fact she continued editing until shortly before her death.) In 1999 she was made editor of the year at the British book awards and in 2003 she won the Eleanor Farjeon award, presented by the Children's Book Circle for outstanding services to children's literature. She died of ovarian cancer at St George's Hospital, Tooting, London, on 14 November 2005, and was survived by her husband and daughter. Her life has been honoured by the launch on 23 November 2006 of the Miriam Hodgson perspective series, a lecture series to be run in conjunction with Seven Stories in Newcastle.<br>
