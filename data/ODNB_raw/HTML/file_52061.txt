<span class="headword">Edisbury,  Kenrick</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1638), <span class="occ">naval administrator</span>, was the son and heir of Robert Wilkinson, alias Edisbury (<i>d</i>. 1610), of Marchwiel, Denbighshire, and Jane, daughter of Kenrick ap Robert ap Howel, also of Marchwiel, and his wife, Rose Stanley. No record of his birth or baptism survives, and though a deposition of 1608 suggests that he was born about 1577/8 another of 1626 indicates that the date may have been about 1584/5. By May 1604 he had entered the service of the corrupt surveyor of the navy Sir John Trevor, who, like Edisbury, hailed originally from Denbighshire. In that month he witnessed a bond on Trevor's behalf and by August 1606 he was acting as Trevor's chief clerk. In July 1608 he bought the keepership of Chatham's stores from the previous incumbent for &pound;100. Close association with Trevor perhaps inevitably coloured Edisbury's behaviour, and during the course of the 1608&#150;9 inquiry into the navy he was accused of misappropriating stores and receiving kickbacks. No action was taken against the malefactors exposed by the inquiry, however, and consequently he went unpunished. In November 1609 he was appointed a deputy governor of the Chatham Chest, a fund for disabled seamen, having previously served as its clerk, with responsibility for collecting rents. In the following April he became deputy governor of the Sir John Hawkins Hospital, Chatham, a position which required him to keep detailed accounts. He continued in naval administration despite Trevor's resignation in 1611, attaining the position of clerk of the survey by April 1616, and some time before 1619 he penned a little-known treatise on the navy, which has been misdated to 1630. Its underlying purpose was to establish its author's credentials as a reformer, even if this entailed condemning many of the practices, such as the buying and selling of offices, in which he himself had formerly indulged. The tract evidently served its function, for in May 1618 Edisbury resigned his position at the Hawkins' Hospital to become shortly thereafter paymaster of the navy under the newly appointed treasurer, Sir William Russell. In November Edisbury was also made an assistant to the admiralty, the last man ever to be appointed to this obsolete office, which carried with it an annual salary of &pound;20 and no duties. He nevertheless remained ambitious for further promotion and unsuccessfully pursued a reversion to the clerkship of the navy, the most junior position on the navy board, despite having condemned the award of reversionary grants in his treatise.<br>
<br>Edisbury's promising naval career was suddenly thrown into jeopardy in March 1627 by the resignation of Russell, whose successor as treasurer, Sir Sackville Crowe, installed one of his own servants as paymaster. Crowe's shortcomings, however, helped pave the way for Edisbury's return to naval administration. In June 1628 he was appointed deputy treasurer at Portsmouth after secretary of state Sir John Coke, who had been put in charge of naval preparations there for the relief of La Rochelle, complained that Crowe would not provide him with clerical support. Edisbury acquitted himself so well in this service that, when the fleet returned to Portsmouth from France in November, he was unofficially permitted to resume his former duties as paymaster. His stock was now rising fast, unlike that of the navy board, whose members were widely perceived to be indolent, ineffectual, and incompetent. In late November, for example, the admiralty secretary canvassed Edisbury's view after the navy's surveyor advised against grounding a particular ship. A few weeks earlier Edisbury had advertised his abilities by submitting on his own initiative a short paper on the work needed to prevent the navy's vessels from decaying over the remaining winter months. By January 1629 the admiralty commissioners were so impressed with Edisbury that they promoted him assistant to the navy board, with responsibility for paying off mariners, backdating his appointment to the previous June, and in this capacity he worked alongside the official paymaster, John Harpur. Edisbury was again called upon to fill an administrative gap after Sir Sackville Crowe was suspended for suspected malfeasance in June 1629. During the period of Crowe's suspension, Edisbury and the navy's comptroller were jointly authorized to perform the treasurer's functions. Although Crowe returned to active duty in July, his shortcomings were now too plain to ignore, and in the following January the treasurership was again conferred on Sir William Russell, who immediately reinstated Edisbury as paymaster.<br>
<br>Edisbury's second term as paymaster was of short duration. In December 1632 he was appointed surveyor following the resignation of Sir Thomas Aylesbury, thereby achieving membership of the navy board, which he had long coveted. He undoubtedly owed his appointment in large part to Sir John Coke. Now an admiralty commissioner, Coke received glowing testimony of Edisbury's abilities in September 1632 from his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Sir Kenelm Digby: &#145;he studyeth continually how to contrive and mould things for the King's best advantage, and his thoughts are ever upon this subject, and in a word he hath no other business or recreation&#146;. Pronounced &#145;honest and upright&#146; by Digby, Edisbury rapidly demonstrated a degree of energy and dedication to business unequalled by his colleagues on the navy board, which he proceeded to dominate, although as late as September 1633 he encountered distrust from the leading admiralty commissioner, Lord Treasurer Portland. Within months of taking office, he revealed that three of his fellow officers, plus a number of other dockyard officials, had sold junk rope without admiralty authorization, while in February 1634 he exposed the widespread practice of embezzling woodchips. His term as surveyor was also marked by the reinstitution of the practice of holding detailed, three-yearly inspections of the navy's stores and ships. Yet for all his energy and professionalism Edisbury, like his predecessors, was not a trained shipwright and so lacked the expertise to oversee shipbuilding and repair. In 1634 he failed to detect that the newly built <i>Unicorn</i> was so badly designed that she would prove unseaworthy without substantial modification, while that same year he ignored the advice of several shipwrights to remove from the navy's ships all sheathing more than seven years old to allow their caulking to be renewed. In consequence, the <i>Assurance</i>, which had not been re-sheathed in twenty-five years, proved so leaky in 1636 that she had to be withdrawn from the second ship money fleet. These failings aside, however, Edisbury was unquestionably the most competent and dedicated member of the navy board in the 1630s.<br>
<br>Edisbury's official salary was insufficient to meet the costs of his office, even allowing for his fee as an admiralty assistant. Nevertheless, throughout the 1620s and 1630s he bought up a substantial landed estate in north Wales. How he found the money to do so is unclear, but had he attempted to accrue a personal fortune by corrupt practice he would not long have escaped detection by his backer, the incorruptible and eagle-eyed Sir John Coke. His wealth was almost certainly derived from the property acquired at his marriage about 1605 to Marie Harding, or Peters, the daughter and heir of a Rochester innkeeper, Edward Harding, or Peters, and his wife, Cicely; from the lands he inherited from his father in 1610; from further property in Denbighshire acquired from 1613; from the profits of leases held of the Hawkins Hospital; and from his income as feodary, surveyor, and receiver of the court of wards for Denbighshire, an office he acquired in January 1628.<br>
<br>Edisbury, whose residence alternated between Chatham, Deptford, and London, died in lodgings belonging to the navy at Chatham on 27 August 1638. His death was not preceded by a lengthy period of illness, though the effects of a fall from a ship in 1618 had proved long lasting. By the terms of his will, drawn up one week before his death, Edisbury appointed as his executors his wife, Marie, and their eldest son, John, to whom he bequeathed his landed estate. No provision was made in the will for Edisbury's younger son Richard. An inscription in Edisbury's memory stands near the west door of the former St Mary's, Chatham, where he was buried; a bust of Edisbury once surmounted the inscription but disappeared after 1915. There was no lack of competitors to succeed Edisbury as surveyor, despite the smallness of his official salary. The successful candidate was William Batten, who once teased Pepys with the story that Pepys's chamber in Chatham was haunted by Edisbury's ghost.<br>
