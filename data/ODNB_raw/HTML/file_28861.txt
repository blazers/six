<span class="headword">Watson,  Robert</span>  (1730?&#150;1781), <span class="occ">historian and rhetorician</span>, was born in St Andrews, the son of Andrew Watson, an apothecary and brewer. Nothing is known of his early years, though records show he studied at St Andrews University from 1744 to 1748, receiving his MA degree on 6 May 1748. He subsequently spent time in Glasgow and Edinburgh, perhaps taking some classes at their respective universities. While in Edinburgh he probably attended the rhetoric lectures given by Adam Smith in 1748&#150;9, and at the same time he is said to have &#145;secured the countenance, approbation, and friendship of Lord Kames, Mr Hume, and other eminent men of that day&#146;  (Anderson, 740). When Smith left Edinburgh in 1751 to assume the chair of logic at Glasgow, Kames recruited Watson to continue the series of rhetoric lectures. Watson's exact dates of lecturing are not known, but they must have been some time between 1751 and 1756, when, having been licensed by the presbytery of St Andrews, he applied for a vacancy in a St Andrews parish. Although denied that position, he then sought to replace the retiring Henry Rymer as professor of logic, rhetoric, and metaphysics at St Andrews. Watson received the appointment on 18 June 1756.<br>
<br>After a year in his academic appointment Watson married Margaret Shaw, the daughter of the professor of divinity in St Mary's College, on 29 June 1757; they subsequently had five daughters. He taught courses in rhetoric and <i>belles-lettres</i> and in logic; various sets of student notes survive for both courses as they were delivered between 1756 and 1778. He does not appear to have taught a separate course in metaphysics. His lectures clearly reflect the new trends in rhetoric and logic developed by the Scottish Enlightenment. In logic he gave a prominent place to Locke, as did Thomas Reid at Aberdeen, John Stevenson at Edinburgh, and James Clow at Glasgow. In rhetoric he joined figures such as Adam Smith, Hugh Blair, and George Campbell in rethinking rhetoric in terms of human nature, thus linking rhetoric, through psychology, to ethics, aesthetics, and criticism. In neither logic nor rhetoric, however, was Watson a strongly original thinker; instead, his work is valuable in offering &#145;a general contribution to our understanding of the scope, method, and role of rhetoric in the Scottish university curriculum in the eighteenth century&#146;  (Bator, 104).<br>
<br>Watson was also active in university business outside the classroom. He was instrumental in having honorary degrees conferred on Hugh Blair (1757) and Benjamin Franklin (1759), but perhaps his most important assignment was the expansion of the university library, which included both gathering library materials and overseeing the construction of improved facilities. These concerns for the university helped prepare him for more important administrative assignments. From the time of his rhetoric lectures in Edinburgh he had maintained close ties with the moderate party leadership in the church. Thus, on 9 January 1778&#151;following a plan formed several years earlier by the earl of Kinnoul and moderate colleagues such as William Robertson&#151;Watson was named principal of St Andrews University, and, later that year, rector of the United College of St Salvator and St Leonard in the University of St Andrews, succeeding Thomas Tullidelph, who had died after years of failing health in November 1777. Watson was a genial, scholarly representative of the university. When James Boswell and Samuel Johnson visited St Andrews in 1773 they found him to be &#145;a well-informed man, of very amiable manners&#146;, and they spent some time discussing Watson's &#145;favourite topick&#146; of composition  (Boswell, 66&#150;8). The United College&#151;the main buildings of which Watson had actually purchased in 1772 to house his family&#151;&#145;seemed quite academical; and we found in his house very comfortable and genteel accommodation&#146;  (ibid., 58). Johnson, who later edited Watson's two histories, observed that Watson's &#145;easy civility quickly made us forget that we were strangers; and in the whole time of our stay we were gratified by every mode of kindness, and entertained with all the elegance of lettered hospitality&#146;  (Johnson, <span class="italic">Journey</span>, 5).<br>
<br>Despite Watson's work in rhetoric and education, he remains best known for his two histories. <span class="italic">The History of the Reign of Philip the Second, King of Spain</span> was published in two volumes in London by Strahan and Cadell in 1777, with six further editions appearing between 1778 and 1812. <span class="italic">The History of the Reign of Philip the Third, King of Spain</span> was left incomplete at his death. The first four books of this were transcribed directly from Watson's manuscripts, the last two were added by William Thomson, and the whole published in 1783 by Robinson. Both histories form a sequel to William Robertson's <span class="italic">History of the Reign of Charles V</span> (1769), being generally modelled on that earlier work in terms of structure and style as well as their broad conception of Philip II's character. Like Robertson, Watson faced the problem of unifying his subject around the life and career of his central figure, with the result that there is a constant tension between the great dispersion of events in the Habsburg empire and the biography of the ruler. As a rhetorician, however, Watson was very sensitive to the importance of unity in history, and his ability to create smooth transitions among events was praised by reviewers. Watson also wore his learning very lightly, having none of the heavier annotation or learned appendices of Hume or Robertson. He did not often cite manuscript or archival sources in his histories, though at the time of his death he was in possession of some of the earl of Hardwicke's manuscripts that he was consulting in his research for <span class="italic">Philip the Third</span>. Instead Watson seems even more insistent than his fellow historians in aiming for a polite audience, one more interested in moral education than in the details of historical interpretation. Both histories may, in fact, be read as illustrations of the dangers of narrow education and &#145;illiberal superstition&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of &hellip; Philip the Second</span>, 1.2). Watson attributed the bloody struggles of Philip II's reign to Philip's narrow Catholic education in which he &#145;had imbibed, in all its virulence, that spirit of bigotry and persecution, which gave birth to the inquisition&#146;  (ibid., 1.93). Watson thought Philip III an even greater failure, combining his father's &#145;bigotted [<i>sic</i>] attachment to the superstition of the church of Rome&#146; with a strong aversion &#145;to almost every species of manly exertion and activity&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of &hellip; Philip the Third</span>, 3rd edn, 1808, 1.1&#150;2). In contrast Watson describes Philip II's arch-rival, the prince of Orange, as the embodiment of moderate-party educational ideals: flexible, adaptable, polite, and possessed of &#145;a peculiar dexterity in governing the inclinations of men, and in conciliating and preserving their affections&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of &hellip; Philip the Second</span>, 2.166).<br>
<br>Watson died unexpectedly on 31 March 1781 in St Andrews. Almost immediately the wheels were set in motion through Robertson for another well-established moderate, Joseph MacCormick, to succeed as principal. Watson's cousin Hugh Blair was asked by John Davidson, the executor of the estate, to be responsible for handling Watson's papers dealing with history and literary&#150;financial affairs. In a sermon of 1793 Alexander Carlyle included Watson in his retrospective list of moderate-party clergymen who he felt had brought particular lustre to the Scottish church through their accomplishments in polite learning. Watson thus takes his place as a fine example of a liberally educated Presbyterian clergyman, the unique creation of the Scottish Enlightenment.<br>
