<span class="headword">Medhurst,  Walter Henry</span>  (1796&#150;1857), <span class="occ">missionary</span>, was born in London on 29 April 1796, the son of William Medhurst, an innkeeper of Ross, Scotland. He attended St Paul's School (1807&#150;12), and after leaving was apprenticed as a printer to Joseph Wood at the <span class="italic">Gloucester Herald</span> office. There he joined the Congregational church at Southgate Chapel in December 1813. In 1816 he began work for the London Missionary Society (LMS). Following a short period of study at Hackney College he left Britain for Malacca in September 1816 as a missionary printer at the Anglo-Chinese College. On the way he broke his journey at Madras from 11 February to 20 May 1817, and there he married Mrs Elizabeth Braun, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Martin (1794&#150;1874), the day before he sailed. From June 1817 he worked at the printing press and also made rapid progress in Malay and Chinese, and began preaching in Hokkien. He was ordained by William Milne at Malacca on 27 April 1819.<br>
<br>Of wiry frame, good health, and unfailing cheerfulness, Medhurst proved an efficient if independently minded missionary. He was too energetic to be confined to the college and, after a disagreement, left in September 1820 for Penang, and began his own mission station. At the end of 1821 he moved to Batavia, where his only surviving son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18495/', "Walter Henry Medhurst")</script>, was born in 1822. There were also four daughters from the marriage. In 1829&#150;30 Medhurst journeyed in Java and Bali, and in 1835 along the Chinese coast and even to Shanghai, then still a closed port. In 1836 he returned to Britain, where he wrote <span class="italic">China, its State and Prospects</span>, published in 1838, with a view to stimulating interest in Chinese missions, and especially in a new translation of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> into Chinese, later known as the Delegates' Version, a work he accomplished with the co-operation of friends between 1847 and 1850. In November 1838 he returned to Java. When Shanghai and four other ports were opened to British merchants in 1842 under the Anglo-Chinese treaty of Nanking (Nanjing), he seized his opportunity and established an LMS mission there, largely on his own initiative. His family joined him the following year. Medhurst became the dominant figure in this, the most important station of the LMS in China, and also in the steadily growing British community in Shanghai, where he served on the first municipal council in 1854&#150;5.<br>
<br>Medhurst was by no means genial, or an easy man to get on with, and was the object more of respect than affection. In Shanghai he established the mission press (the first modern one in China) and published a steady stream of works in English and in Chinese, many of them his own. His works were numerous, and included thirty-four Chinese and some sixty-two Malay volumes, as well as translations from the Chinese and his English writings. They exhibit unceasing activity of mind, a remarkable gift for languages, and an intellect not shackled by the disciplinary barriers between sacred and secular learning. Medhurst also had the energy to undertake proselytizing trips into the Chinese interior almost immediately, most notably a courageous clandestine journey in 1845, engagingly written up that year as his <span class="italic">Glance at the Interior of China</span>. On 8 March 1848, on a less secretive trip, he was badly beaten in what became known as the &#145;Tsingpu outrage&#146;.<br>
<br>On 19 March 1853 Medhurst wrote that he had seen a &#145;most extraordinary document&#146;. This was a religious pamphlet, apparently Christian, issued by the Chinese Taiping insurgents. The excitement thus generated cannot be overestimated, even though it was ultimately disappointed. The following month Medhurst accompanied George Bonham on a delegation to meet the Taiping leadership in their capital, Nanjing. There he collected a large number of rebel pamphlets which he translated and published.<br>
<br>The strain of the past decade's pioneering work began to show. During the occupation of Shanghai by the rebel Small Sword Society (1853&#150;4) Medhurst was assaulted by Qing soldiers, and in 1855 his son implored the LMS to recall him, as he had aged appreciably in the previous two years. On 10 September 1856 he sailed with his wife and family for Britain. The voyage was hardly a restful affair and he died in London on 24 January 1857, just three days after reaching the country. He was buried in Abney Park cemetery on 30 January.<br>
