<span class="headword">Davies,  William</span>  (1814&#150;1891), <span class="occ">palaeontologist</span>, was born at Holywell, Flintshire, on 13 July 1814, the son of Thomas Davies and his wife, Elizabeth Turner. After going to school in his native town he studied botany, and on 19 December 1843 obtained a post as an attendant in the British Museum in London, working at first on the mineral collections. He became a competent general mineralogist, and was subsequently employed to work on the fossil vertebrate collections. In this field he not only acquired great technical knowledge as to the best methods of developing and preserving delicate specimens, but also was pronounced to be &#145;one of its most accomplished students&#146;. He was so skilled in reconstructing the remains of extinct specimens that in 1875 he was made responsible for the whole fossil vertebrate collection.<br>
<br>Davies took an active part in the rearrangement of the natural history collections in 1880, when they were transferred from Bloomsbury to the new buildings in South Kensington. He gave most valuable assistance to Sir Antonio Brady in collecting a series of Pleistocene mammal remains from the Thames valley brickearth, which he later described and figured. He was also responsible for the excavation and preservation of the Ilford mammoth head.<br>
<br>In 1880 Davies was promoted to assistant, first class, having been made assistant five years earlier. He retired in 1887 and was pensioned by the museum, which he continued to provide with revised proofs of palaeontological works. He died at his home, 66 Antill Road, Bethnal Green, London, on 13 February 1891, from epilepsy and syncope. He was twice married, and with his first wife (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Bradford) had a son, the mineralogist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7268/', "Thomas Davies (1837&#150;1892)")</script>, and a daughter.<br>
<br>The Geological Society made Davies the first Murchison medallist in 1873 and elected him a life fellow in 1877. He disliked literary composition, so his scientific papers were not numerous. He was the author of about fifteen important papers, mostly contributed to the <span class="italic">Geological Magazine</span>, and published a <span class="italic">Catalogue of the Pleistocene Vertebrata in the Collection of Sir Antonio Brady</span> (1874).<br>
