<span class="headword">Atkyns, Sir  Edward</span>  (1630/31&#150;1698), <span class="occ">judge and politician</span>, was born at Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/862/', "Sir Edward Atkyns (1587&#150;1669)")</script> of Hensington, Oxfordshire, and Albury Hall, Hertfordshire, baron of the exchequer and justice of the common pleas, and his first wife, Ursula (<i>d</i>. 1644), daughter of Sir Thomas Dacres of Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. He was admitted at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, in October 1646 aged fifteen, entered Lincoln's Inn in 1647, and was called to the bar in 1653. He married on 9 December 1656 Elizabeth, daughter and heir of Francis Lucy of the Strand, Westminster, with whom he had two sons and seven daughters. In 1660 Atkyns was returned to parliament as member for and recorder of New Woodstock. Hensington was a hamlet of Woodstock, and he seems to have had the interest of his kinsman by marriage and fellow MP Sir Thomas Spencer. Atkyns was regarded as a court supporter, but was not an active member. In November he was granted the reversion to the monopoly of publishing law books for forty years. He lost his seat at New Woodstock at the 1661 election and resigned as recorder the following year.<br>
<br>Atkyns was renowned for legal learning and hospitality; he succeeded to Albury Hall in Hertfordshire in 1669, and in June of that year he was raised to the bench as one of the barons of the exchequer. He was made a serjeant-at-law in 1679 and was knighted on 26 June. As a court supporter Atkyns was kept informed of moves by Lord Shaftesbury and other whigs to alter the succession to keep out Charles's brother James  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1676&#150;7</i>, 541). During the Popish Plot in July 1680 Atkyns was one of the presiding judges at the trials of Mary Presswicks and Thomas Thwing, two Roman Catholics, for high treason. The charge was plotting to murder the king in Yorkshire in order to establish a &#145;nunnery&#146; there, but the real reason was probably having called Oates and Bedloe two rogues. Atkyns directed the jury that evidence against Presswicks was all hearsay, so that she was acquitted. He gave the rather surprising ruling that Presswicks's reported statement that &#145;we should never be at peace till we were all of the Roman Catholic religion, and the Duke of York was made king&#146; did not amount to high treason. Thwing, a priest, against whom there were two witnesses, was found guilty and was hanged, drawn, and quartered. When, at the end of the year, Lord Stafford was tried for treason before the House of Lords, all the judges were asked for their opinion; Atkyns ruled that the requirement of two witnesses in the same overt act of treason might be waived, as otherwise he did not &#145;well see how any man can be convicted of treason&#146; (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 7.1164&#150;81, 1528; Kenyon, 226). His legal career, however, was overshadowed by that of his more eminent and whiggish brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/866/', "Sir Robert Atkyns (bap. 1621, d. 1710)")</script>, from whom he increasingly diverged politically.<br>
<br>In April 1686 Lord Chief Baron Montagu was removed from the bench by Lord Chancellor Jeffreys for refusing to agree that James II's suspending powers were legal; Atkyns was appointed to replace him. According to Lord Ailesbury, Atkyns, his &#145;worthy friend&#146;, &#145;was astonished when he was to be Chief Baron, he having given his opinion to the Chancellor in the negative&#146;  (Buckley, 151). It would seem that Atkyns continued his opposition, since James II wrote of the dispensing powers that the judges now &#145;agreed unanimously (all but one)&#146; that the dispensing power was an essential part of the king's prerogative  (Clarke, 2.81).<br>
<br>After the revolution of 1688&#150;9 Atkyns was one of the tories who refused to take the oaths to William III and Mary, and was replaced as chief baron by his brother, Sir Robert. He was on good terms with the earl of Danby, advising him and his family on the choice of loyal servants  (BL, Egerton MS 3337, fol. 47). Danby could not persuade him to come over to the court, however, and he remained a nonjuror, though no evidence has been found that he was an active Jacobite. He lived in retirement at Pickenham in Norfolk, but he died of the stone in London in October 1698.<br>
