<span class="headword">Ehrlich,  Georg</span>  (1897&#150;1966), <span class="occ">sculptor and graphic artist</span>, was born on 22 February 1897 in Vienna, the eldest of the three children of Kurt Ehrlich of Breslau, the representative of a German coalmining company, and his wife, Rosa, who was Viennese. Kurt Ehrlich was a businessman by necessity but, like his son, a musician by inclination. Georg was allowed to leave his <i>Gymnasium</i> in Vienna at the age of fifteen and enrol in the Vienna Kunstgewerbeschule. After only three years there he was called up to the Austrian army and saw service on the Russian and Italian fronts with the rank of lieutenant until the end of the war.<br>
<br>During his short time at the Kunstgewerbeschule Ehrlich managed to master the techniques of etching and lithography. In 1920, in the economic misery which followed Austria's defeat, he moved to Munich and until 1925 produced many prints in those media. Despite hyperinflation they sold well to collectors and museums. The prints were shown with, and stand comparison with, the more demonstrative works of Ernst Barlach, Oskar Kokoschka, and others. They project, however, a huge sadness quite different from the bitter protest and denunciation which characterized post-war art in German-speaking countries. In Ehrlich's vision humanity is helpless. His bodies serve as frail supports for the encephalitic heads from which the soul looks out from great melancholy eyes. In real life such eyes belonged to a certain friend, the well-known actress Elizabeth Bergner, whom he first portrayed in 1921. Ehrlich included himself in some prints, satirizing his small stature and pronounced features. The writer on art Erica Tietze-Conrat, who was an intimate friend, suggested that his vision of victimized humanity was less related to post-war suffering than to his own history as the son of a frustrated and angry father.<br>
<br>Ehrlich returned to Vienna in 1924 and began to devote himself to sculpture. He was by no means an Orthodox Jew. Already in his graphic work he had mingled <span class="roman">Old</span> and <span class="roman">New Testament</span> and Apocryphal themes. His sculpture shows the same sense of the numinous. In it, mankind is seldom seen to be in charge of its own destiny but seems more often to be listening and waiting, sometimes despairingly. This tendency did not show itself immediately or consistently. His first prominent commission in Vienna, <span class="italic">Girl Carrying her Little Brother</span> (1933, &Ouml;sterreichische Galerie, Vienna), was in a Germanic tradition of realist public sculpture. In a series of heads of boys and men in the 1930s, the clean-cut features and cropped hair show a confident classicizing tendency, but in <span class="italic">Two Sisters</span> (1932, Museum der Stadt Wien) there is conventual submission and abnegation of the flesh. Ehrlich's concern for form was as great as any modernist's, as he searched for the most classical form in which to convey his subjects' interiority. Between 1928 and 1937 he exhibited in ten cities. His Viennese career was cut short by the Anschluss in March 1938, which made it dangerous for him to remain in Austria. At this time he was already in London, and his wife, Bettina Bauer (<i>d</i>. 1985), whom he had married on 27 November 1930, joined him in July of that year and brought many of his works with her.<br>
<br>Ehrlich made a success in London. His first exhibition in Britain was there in 1939. As early as 1944 he was commissioned by the city of Coventry to make a memorial to the victims of air raids; his figure <span class="italic">Pax</span> (1944&#150;5) is in the city's Garden of Rest. Like other refugee artists of quality he did not fit the stereotypes of academic or modernist which competed for attention on the British post-war scene. But the distinction of his work earned him supporters in both camps, and in the world of music. He was an associate of the Royal Academy and member of the Royal Society of British Arts, and a member of the London Group, but his works were also exhibited by the Arts Council and represented in important public collections. The number of his public commissions belies the scant attention he received from critics and publicists fixated on modernism. The Ehrlichs rapidly committed themselves to Britain and Georg became a British subject in 1947. His beautiful and talented wife must have greatly helped their integration. Bettina, as she signed herself, was a painter and illustrator who also became expert in the casting and patination of her husband's bronzes.<br>
<br>Although his work never looked English, Ehrlich responded to the mood of post-war Britain. The contemporary angst had its reflection in his increasingly etiolated, mannerist figures, such as <span class="italic">Recumbent Boy</span> (original plaster, Museum and Art Gallery, Letchworth, Hertfordshire) which he showed at the Festival of Britain in 1951. Their melancholy grace was offset by the animal sculptures which became a feature of his London period. (Some of these are in the Tate collection.) Whether or not he intended these to appeal to British collectors, they are rooted in his childhood, when he would trudge some distance to draw the horses at a cab stand&#151;his <span class="italic">Tired Horse</span> (1961, Bruton Gallery, Bruton, Somerset, in 1979) revives such a memory. Years later he remarked that in order to represent a horse one had for the time to <i>be</i> a horse. Indeed an element of self-portraiture runs through his whole work and becomes palpable in the last <span class="italic">Head of a Horse</span> (Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh) he made in 1963&#150;4. Other bronze portraits of mainly musical celebrities include <span class="italic">Benjamin Britten</span> (1950&#150;52, priv. coll.).<br>
<br>Georg Ehrlich died on 1 July 1966 at Lucerne, Switzerland, from the heart condition which had troubled him since 1951, and he was buried in Vienna in a grave donated by the city. His widow continued to live in London and carefully to supervise the casting of his plaster and Plasticine originals until her death in 1985; there was then no one left to represent him in London, since his long-term dealers, the O'Hana Gallery, had closed. Bettina Ehrlich had therefore provided that all the originals and casts should be returned to Vienna.<br>
