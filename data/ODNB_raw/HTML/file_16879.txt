<span class="headword">Lobb,  Theophilus</span>  (1678&#150;1763), <span class="occ">physician and nonconformist minister</span>, born in London on 17 August 1678, was the son of the nonconformist divine <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16878/', "Stephen Lobb (d. 1699)")</script>, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1691), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22484/', "Theophilus Polwhele (d. 1689)")</script>, nonconformist minister at Tiverton, Devon. Despite an early interest in medicine he was educated for the ministry under the Revd Thomas Goodwin (1650&#150;1716), at Pinner, Middlesex. In 1702 he settled as a nonconformist minister at Guildford, Surrey, and there received some medical instruction from a local physician. About 1706 Lobb moved to Shaftesbury, Dorset, and began to practise as a physician. Seven years later he settled at Yeovil, Somerset, and established a successful medical practice, although he still continued to act as a minister. Dissensions in his congregation at Yeovil induced him in 1722 to move to Witham, Essex. On 26 June of that year he was created MD by the University of Glasgow, and was admitted FRS on 13 March 1729. In 1732 Lobb received a call from the congregation at Haberdashers' Hall, London, but, as his ministry did not prove acceptable, he appears to have decided about 1736 to devote himself to medicine. However, he continued to publish religious works concerning morals and portents. These include <span class="italic">A brief defence of the Christian religion, or, The testimony of God to the truth of the Christian religion</span> (1726); <span class="italic">Sacred declarations, or, A letter to the inhabitants of London, Westminster, and all other parts of Great Britain on the account of those sins which provoked God to send and continue the mortal sickness among the cattle, and to signify by the late awful earthquakes that his anger is not turned away</span> (published anonymously, 1750); and <span class="italic">Letters on the Sacred Predictions (with a Letter upon the Public Reading of the Scriptures)</span> (1761).<br>
<br>On 30 September 1740 Lobb was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, and then practised only in London. On 21 May 1762 a patent was granted to him &#145;for a tincture to preserve the blood from diziness, and a saline scorbutic acrimony&#146;. Lobb's medical writings ranged from treatises on ailments in particular to the practice of physic in general. They include <span class="italic">A Treatise of the Small-Pox</span> (1731); <span class="italic">Rational Methods of Curing Fevers</span> (1734); and <span class="italic">Letters Concerning the Plague, Shewing the Means to Preserve People from Infection</span> (1745).<br>
<br>Lobb first married, on 28 January 1702 at Egham, Surrey, Frances (<i>d</i>. 1722), daughter of James Cooke, physician, of Shepton Mallet, Somerset, and second, in 1723, &#145;a lady&#146;, who died on 2 February 1760. No children survived him. He died in the parish of Christ Church, London, on 19 May 1763, and was buried in Bunhill Fields. The profit from the sale of the tincture he left to his niece Elizabeth Buckland. In 1767 the Revd John Greene of Chelmsford, Essex, his brother-in-law, published <span class="italic">The Power of Faith and Godliness Exemplified in some Memoirs of Theophilus Lobb</span>, consisting principally of extracts from Lobb's diary.<br>
