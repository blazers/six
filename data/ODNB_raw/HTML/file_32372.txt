<span class="headword">Charley, Sir  William Thomas</span>  (1833&#150;1904), <span class="occ">politician and lawyer</span>, born at Woodbourne, co. Antrim, on 5 March 1833, was the youngest son of Matthew Charley (1788&#150;1846) of Finaghy House, Belfast, and his wife, Mary Anne, daughter of Walter Roberts of Collin House. He was educated at Elstree House School, Lee, Kent, and at St John's College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 28 June 1856, graduating BA in 1864 with a first class, and proceeding BCL and DCL by accumulation in 1868. Entering as a student at the Inner Temple on 3 June 1857, he was called to the bar on 9 June 1865. Although a fair lawyer and the editor of a textbook (1867) on the law of cabs and omnibuses, Charley never obtained more than a moderate practice, for the most part carried on in Liverpool and Salford.<br>
<br>Charley was an active Conservative politician all his life and took a prominent part in the reorganization of the Conservative Party in London and Lancashire which accompanied the extension of the franchise in 1867. At the general election of December 1868 he was elected for Salford; he retained his seat at the general election of February 1874, but at that of April 1880 he was defeated, and he was an unsuccessful candidate at Ipswich in 1883 and 1885. While in parliament Charley was a constant speaker, and an out-and-out supporter of Disraeli, taking an especial interest in social and ecclesiastical questions, on which latter he held strong protestant views. He was the author of several measures, one of which, the <span class="roman">Offences Against the Persons Act</span> of 1875, was the forerunner of the <span class="roman">Criminal Law Amendment Act</span> of 1885 for the better protection of young women and girls. He edited a book on the <span class="roman">Real Property Acts</span> (1875, several later editions) and wrote <span class="italic">The New System of Practice and Pleading</span> (1877).<br>
<br>Charley's election as common serjeant in April 1878 against a strong field of competitors occasioned, in view of his modest legal qualifications, general surprise in the profession. The result was the abolition in the <span class="roman">Local Government Act</span> of 1888 of &#145;the right claimed by the court of common council to appoint to the office of common serjeant&#146;, which was thereby vested in the crown (51 &amp; 52 Vict. c. 41, s. 42). Although he was knighted on 18 March 1880&#151;the appointment being criticized for its overt politicism&#151;and was made a QC in the same year, his performance of his official duties was the cause of dissatisfaction, and he retired on a very generous pension of &pound;1500 in 1892.<br>
<br>Charley married in April 1890 Clara, daughter of F. G. Harbord of Kirby Park, Cheshire; they had no children. He was a vigorous defender of the Church of England and trustee of numerous church societies. He defended the House of Lords in <span class="italic">The Crusade Against the Constitution</span> (1895) and <span class="italic">Mending and Ending</span> (1900). His later years were largely devoted to lecturing on &#145;the higher criticism&#146;, a subject for which his studies had imperfectly qualified him (see his <span class="italic">The Holy City</span>, 1902). An enthusiastic volunteer from the early days of the movement, he commanded the 3rd volunteer battalion of the Royal Fusiliers, the City of London regiment, retiring in 1889 with the rank of honorary colonel. He rode at the head of his old regiment at the annual inspection in Hyde Park a few weeks before his death, which took place on 8 July 1904 at his house, Woodbourne, East Grinstead, Sussex, after he was suddenly taken ill at the East Grinstead Literary Institute. He was buried at East Grinstead cemetery.<br>
