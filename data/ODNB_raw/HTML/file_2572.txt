<span class="headword">Blair,  Robert</span>  (1748&#150;1828), <span class="occ">surgeon and maker of optical instruments</span>, was born at Garvald, Haddingtonshire, the son of the minister Archibald Blair and his wife, Janet Barclay. After studying medicine at Edinburgh University he was apprenticed to Francis Balfour, surgeon in the Royal Navy; as a naval surgeon Blair served in the West Indies, during which time he became interested in navigation and its instruments. His proposal for improving the adjustment of Hadley's quadrant for back observations gained him an award of &pound;100 from the commissioners of longitude; his description was published in 1783 as an appendix to the <span class="italic">Nautical Almanac</span> for 1788 and was also issued separately. Blair returned to Britain in the early 1780s.<br>
<br>In 1785 a regius chair of practical astronomy was established at the University of Edinburgh with the aim of improving navigation and allied arts. Blair was appointed professor, with a yearly salary of &pound;120, and awarded the degree of MD. The following year he was elected to the Royal Society of Edinburgh. As professor, Blair &#145;enjoyed forty two years of endowed leisure&#146;  (Grant, 2.362), for he refused to give lectures on the grounds that he had neither apparatus nor observatory. He declined to attend meetings of the university senate, and indeed was seldom seen, and resided latterly for eight years in London where his son Archibald Blair was an optician.<br>
<br>While at Edinburgh Blair sought to improve the performance of refracting telescopes which relied on achromatic lenses: doublets of flint and crown glass. It was difficult to procure flint glass without defects, and Blair, as others had done before him, hoped to substitute some dense fluid, with a refractive index similar to that of flint glass, which, when in contact with a crown glass lens, would give an image free from colour and distortion. Two patents (1473 of 1785 and 1800 of 1791) were filed in the course of his lengthy experiments; these labours and the successful outcome were reported at two meetings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in January and April 1791, and published in their transactions in 1794. Blair decided that the most satisfactory form was a triplet, in which a solution of antimony or mercury in hydrochloric acid was sealed in a concavity between two crown glass lenses. For such lenses, he coined the term &#145;aplanatic&#146;, declaring them superior to the common achromatic form, and suitable for telescopes or microscopes. Working with his son, Blair constructed several telescopes equipped with his triplet lenses of apertures between 3 and 4 inches. They were favourably received by astronomers and others; fears that evaporation and loss of transparency would rapidly destroy them were countered by Archibald Blair who in 1827 claimed that lenses made over twenty years previously were still in good condition.<br>
<br>These optical experiments ceased in 1793 when Blair was appointed emeritus first commissioner of the Admiralty's board for the care and custody of prisoners of war, a post which required him to tour naval establishments around Britain. His contribution to sailors' welfare lay in finding a method for preserving lime and lemon juice, and persuading the Admiralty to issue it for long voyages, thus helping to prevent scurvy. Blair later published <span class="italic">Essays on Scientific Subjects</span> (1818) and <span class="italic">Scientific Aphorisms</span> (1826), slight works whose contents did not match the promise of their titles. After a long illness he died at Westlock, Berwickshire, on 22 December 1828.<br>
