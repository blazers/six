<span class="headword">Mastertown,  Charles</span>  (1679&#150;1750), <span class="occ">minister of the Presbyterian General Synod of Ulster and religious controversialist</span>, was born in Scotland, probably near Linlithgow, on 23 March 1679, and was educated at Edinburgh University, whence he graduated MA on 28 June 1697. He was licensed to preach by the presbytery of Linlithgow probably in 1703 and, having moved to Ireland, his credentials were accepted by the synod of Ulster at Antrim on 1 June 1703. He accepted a call from the congregation of Connor and was ordained there by Antrim presbytery on 17 May 1704. His ministry in this charge earned him a growing reputation as a preacher and a scholar. In view of their future disagreements it is worth noting that in 1718 he headed a protest against synod's decision to force John Abernethy, a leading non-subscriber, to move to Dublin, a decision which Abernethy at this time refused to obey.<br>
<br>The installation of Samuel Haliday in the First Belfast congregation in 1720, in spite of his refusal to subscribe to the Westminster confession of faith, alienated several members of both Presbyterian congregations in Belfast. On 4 July 1721 a subscription list was opened for the building of a third meeting-house. Generous help was forthcoming, including gifts from Scotland, and the new church was opened in 1722; the congregation called Mastertown to be their minister, and he was installed on 20 February 1723. It is a remarkable tribute to his ability that so soon afterwards, on 18 June 1723, he was elected moderator of the general synod, meeting at Dungannon. The controversy over subscription was now at its height. Mastertown's own contribution to the debate was substantial. In 1723 he published <span class="italic">An Apology for the Northern Presbyterians in Ireland</span>, defending the practice of subscription in reply to Abernethy's <span class="italic">Seasonable Advice to the Protestant Dissenters in the North of Ireland</span> (1722). Abernethy replied with his <span class="italic">Defence of the Seasonable Advice</span> (<i>c</i>.1725) and Mastertown answered with his <span class="italic">Short Reply</span>, published in 1726; this was a pamphlet of considerable importance that dealt with the doctrinal issues that lay behind the subscription controversy.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Mastertown had published in 1725 a sermon entitled <span class="italic">Christian Liberty Founded on Gospel Truth</span>. Against Abernethy's argument that sincerity is enough and that truth is founded on &#145;personal persuasion&#146; Mastertown maintained that a Christian's knowledge of the truth must be based on the persuasion of the Holy Spirit speaking through scripture. It was not a liberty to embrace error, but to accept the revelation given by God. His most significant work was undoubtedly <span class="italic">The Doctrine of the Holy Trinity</span>, originally published in Belfast in 1725. This went through several editions&#151;in Belfast, London, and Edinburgh&#151;during the author's lifetime. Mastertown himself contributed a supplement to the 1745 edition, entitled <span class="italic">The Great Importance of the Scripture Doctrine of the Ever-Blessed Trinity</span>. After his death it was reprinted a number of times. The final edition (1880) contained a biographical memoir by his great-grandson the Revd Hope Masterton Waddell.<br>
<br>Mastertown suffered considerable opposition from Samuel Haliday and James Kirkpatrick, the ministers of the First and Second Belfast congregations, both before and after the separation of the non-subscribing congregations into the separate Presbytery of Antrim in 1725 and the exclusion of that presbytery from the jurisdiction of synod in 1726. Mastertown pursued his ministry calmly but firmly and built up a large congregation. He attended the general synod in 1745 but by the next year was no longer capable of preaching; William Laird was appointed his assistant and successor on 16 September 1747. Mastertown died in Belfast on 15 July 1750. His only child, Susan, married John Poaug in 1725 and had numerous descendants. After his death Mastertown's friends arranged for the publication of two of his sermons in one pamphlet, which was printed in Belfast in 1753. The first was the farewell sermon that he had preached at Connor in 1722 and the second was a reprint of his 1725 sermon <span class="italic">Christian Liberty</span>.<br>
<br>Charles Mastertown was probably the most capable and influential proponent of orthodoxy in the synod of Ulster as it tried to deal with the contentious issue of subscription in the 1720s. His attitude appears rigid but his writings reveal that he might have proved less inflexible had the non-subscribers been more forthcoming about their doctrinal views. He was above all else an able and gifted minister who built up a strong congregation while at the same time contributing significantly by his writings to the support of orthodox doctrine not only in Ireland but beyond.<br>
