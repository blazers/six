<span class="headword">Bishop,  George</span>  (1785&#150;1861), <span class="occ">astronomer</span>, was born on 21 August 1785 at Leicester. At the age of eighteen he entered a British wine-making business in London, and later became its proprietor. He expanded the business to the extent that the excise returns were said to exhibit half of all home-made wines as being of his manufacture. Bishop was not educated as a scientist; his scientific career may be said to date from his admission to the Astronomical Society in 1830. Ample and reliable means by that time enabled him to pursue the science he enjoyed. He took lessons in algebra from Augustus De Morgan with a view to reading the <span class="italic">M&eacute;canique c&eacute;leste</span> of Pierre Laplace, and acquired, when nearly fifty, enough mathematical knowledge to enable him to comprehend the scope of its methods. In 1836 he realized a long-cherished desire by erecting an observatory near his home at South Villa, Regent's Park, London. No expense was spared in its equipment, and the excellence of the equatorial furnished by Dollond (with an aperture of 7 inches) confirmed his resolve to pursue at his observatory serious science, not mere amusement.<br>
<br>Bishop employed the best observers. W. R. Dawes conducted his noted investigations of double stars at South Villa between 1839 and October 1844, when John Russell Hind took over. From the time that Hencke's detection of Astraea (8 December 1845) showed a prospect of success in the search for new planets, the resources of Bishop's observatory were turned in that direction, and with conspicuous results. Between 1847 and 1854 Hind discovered ten small planets, and Marth one, making a total of eleven asteroids dating from South Villa. The ecliptic charts undertaken by Hind to further the search were continued, after his appointment in 1853 as superintendent of the <span class="italic">Nautical Almanac</span>, by Norman Pogson, Vogel, Marth, and Talmage successively, under his general supervision. They included all stars down to the eleventh magnitude inclusive, and extended over a zone of three degrees on each side of the ecliptic. Seventeen of the twenty-four hours were engraved when the observatory was broken up on the death of its owner.<br>
<br>A testimonial was awarded to Bishop by the Royal Astronomical Society on 14 January 1848 &#145;for the foundation of an observatory leading to various astronomical discoveries&#146;, and presented to him, with a warmly commendatory address, by Sir John Herschel on 11 February. Bishop acted as secretary (1833&#150;9) and as treasurer (1840&#150;57) to the society, and was chosen president in two successive years (1857 and 1858), although his poor health prevented him from taking the chair. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society (9 June 1848), was also a fellow of the Society of Arts, and sat for some years on the council of University College. He published in 1852 <span class="italic">Astronomical Observations taken at the Observatory, South Villa, Regent's Park, during the Years 1839&#150;51</span>, including a catalogue of double stars observed by Dawes and Hind, with valuable &#145;historical and descriptive notes&#146; by the latter, and observations of new planets and comets and of the temporary star discovered by Hind in Ophiuchus on 27 April 1848. After a long period of illness he died at South Villa on 14 June 1861. After his death the instruments and dome were removed to the home of his son George Bishop, at Twickenham, where the same system of work was pursued under the continued supervision of Hind.<br>
