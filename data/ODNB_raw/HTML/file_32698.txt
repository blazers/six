<span class="headword">Dalton,  Ormonde Maddock</span>  (1866&#150;1945), <span class="occ">classical scholar and medieval archaeologist</span>, was born in Cardiff on 3 January 1866, the second of the three sons of Thomas Masters Dalton, solicitor, and his wife, Emily Mansford. From Harrow School he won an exhibition at New College, Oxford, where he obtained a first class in classical moderations (1886) and in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1888). He then travelled in France and Germany, visited a brother's coffee plantation at north Coorg in India, and in 1894 taught at Abbotsholme School in Derbyshire.<br>
<br>In 1895 Dalton entered the department of British and medieval antiquities at the British Museum under Sir Wollaston Franks, and was promoted first class assistant in 1901 and assistant (later called deputy) keeper in 1909. In 1921 he became keeper of British and medieval antiquities when that very heterogeneous collection was separated from ceramics, ethnography, and oriental antiquities. He was conscientious in this role, the administrative side of which took away from his research, but he &#145;shirked no part of the task, and he was deeply respected for his charmingly courteous and sympathetic treatment of subordinates&#146;  (Hill, 14).<br>
<br>In the British Museum Dalton's first duties were ethnographical. He collaborated with Hercules Read in <span class="italic">Antiquities from the City of Benin</span> (1899) and with Thomas Athol Joyce in the <span class="italic">Handbook to the Ethnographical Collections</span> (1910). He became a fellow of the Royal Anthropological Institute in 1895, was honorary secretary and editor of its <span class="italic">Journal</span> from 1896 to 1897, and contributed to its publications. He was also elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1899, served four times on its council, in 1900&#150;22, and contributed important articles to <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span>; he was elected FBA in 1922. But Dalton's interest changed from ethnology to archaeology with his <span class="italic">Catalogue of Early Christian Antiquities</span> (1901), one of the British Museum's series of departmental catalogues which, because of the wealth of commentary in them, became standard works on the subjects concerned. This was followed by the official <span class="italic">Guide to the Early Christian and Byzantine Antiquities</span> (1903; 2nd edn, 1921), and his account of the <span class="italic">Treasure of the Oxus</span> (1905; 2nd edn, 1926) which had been acquired through Franks. He was one of the secretaries (with Robert Weir Schultz) of the Byzantine Research and Publication Fund which produced <span class="italic">The Church of the Nativity at Bethlehem</span> (1910), <span class="italic">The Church of Saint Eirene at Constantinople</span> (1913), and <span class="italic">The Church of Our Lady of the Hundred Gates</span> (1920), by various authors, and collected much still unpublished material.<br>
<br>Dalton's prolific output in the years before the First World War included his <span class="italic">Guide to the Mediaeval Room</span> (1907; rev. edn, 1924), the <span class="italic">Catalogue of the Ivory Carvings of the Christian Era</span> (1909), papers on the great Cyprus treasure of silver plate (<span class="italic">Archaeologia</span>, 57/1, 1900, and 60/1, 1906; <span class="italic">Burlington Magazine</span>, March 1907), and the catalogue of the McClean bequest in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge (1912). They were followed by the <span class="italic">Catalogue of the Engraved Gems of the Post-Classical Periods &hellip; in the British Museum</span> (1915). But his most distinguished work is <span class="italic">Byzantine Art and Archaeology</span> (1911), an encyclopaedic survey of all fields of craftsmanship except architecture. This omission was repaired in his translation (with Hermann Justus Braunholtz) of Strzygowski's <span class="italic">Origin of Christian Church Art</span> (1923), and in <span class="italic">East Christian Art: a Survey</span> (1925). Other interests are represented by a translation (with introduction) of the <span class="italic">Letters of Sidonius</span> (2 vols., 1915), a translation (with a long introduction) of the <span class="italic">History of the Franks</span> by Gregory of Tours (2 vols., 1927), and an uncompleted version of the <span class="italic">Dialogues</span> and <span class="italic">Letters</span> of Sulpicius Severus.<br>
<br>Inveterate shyness limited Dalton's activities outside the British Museum, but at Bath, where he retired in 1928, he was an assiduous and generous, if sometimes awkward, host. Glimpses of his inner life are afforded by three books published under the pseudonym W. Compton Leith (<span class="italic">Apologia diffidentis</span>, 1908; <span class="italic">Sirenica</span>, 1913; and <span class="italic">Domus doloris</span>, 1919), certainly his, although never fully acknowledged. The third book contemplated the effect of pain in the disciplining of the mind and body, and was written during a period of convalescence after he was knocked down by a motor car and seriously injured. This accident ended his war work for the Admiralty, in which he had been engaged in map making. In official life he was courteous and kindly, a skilful collector and critic, of boundless industry and learning.<br>
<br>In 1940 Dalton moved to his cottage in the Quantocks, where he acquired unspoiled land and transferred it to the National Trust. He died at his home, White Cottage, Holford, Somerset, unmarried, on 2 February 1945, leaving his estate to New College to found a research scholarship.<br>
