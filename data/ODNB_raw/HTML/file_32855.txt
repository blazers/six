<span class="headword">Donald, Sir  Robert</span>  (1860&#150;1933), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born in Dufftown, Banffshire, on 29 August 1860, the son of Robert Donald, mason, and his wife, Jane McConochie. He was educated at the local parish school. Later he taught himself shorthand and French and sought to improve himself by a programme of reading. His first job was as a clerk, but already he had determined on journalism as a career. From unsolicited, unpaid contributions to the local journal, he became a reporter for the Edinburgh <span class="italic">Evening News</span>, <span class="italic">The Courant</span>, and the <span class="italic">Northampton Echo</span>. He freelanced in London, Paris, and New York before finally securing an appointment as a correspondent on the new evening daily, <span class="italic">The Star</span>. Responsible for investigating London's government, he made a detailed study of the subject. Hoping to exploit his hard-won expertise, in February 1893, funded by the Progressives, he started a campaigning journal, <span class="italic">London</span>. The enterprise quickly foundered. Undeterred, immediately he launched the <span class="italic">Municipal Journal</span>, and in 1897 the <span class="italic">Municipal Year Book</span>, editing both until 1902. These enterprises first brought him to the notice of the newspaper proprietor Frank Lloyd. Donald married in 1890 Marie-Jeanne, daughter of a French scientist, Professor Garassut. They had two daughters, one of whom predeceased him.<br>
<br>In March 1895 Donald became news editor of the <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span>. In 1899, for what then was the princely salary of &pound;1000 a year, he became publicity manager for the Gordon Hotel group. He contemplated a parliamentary career and was adopted as Liberal and Progressive candidate for West Ham (North). But in January 1904 he accepted Frank Lloyd's invitation to edit the <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span>. The new editor invigorated the newspaper; its circulation rose and its influence increased. From 1906 he also edited <span class="italic">Lloyd's Sunday News</span>. In 1911 he was appointed managing director of United Newspapers. Made a fellow of the Institute of Journalists in 1909, his distinction and status in his profession were acknowledged in 1913 by his unanimous election as president.<br>
<br>Though broadly sympathetic to Liberalism, Donald was never a party zealot. He believed the editor of a national newspaper should maintain close contacts with Westminster. For their part, Liberal Party leaders were happy to confide in &#145;so well-informed and sagacious an adviser&#146;  (Taylor, 50). His proprietor required him to follow broadly Liberal policies, but the editor alone interpreted that intention and carefully preserved his independence. It was supposed he was a close ally of Lloyd George. In 1916 the two men became estranged when the <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span> urged that whoever replaced Kitchener as war minister should &#145;shine in his own orbit without infringing the orbit of the Chief of Staff&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span>, 17 June 1916). Lloyd George resented this &#145;most harmful &hellip; most prejudicial&#146;  (Riddell, entry for 18 June 1916) advice that seemed to imply that Donald supported the generals. The former amity between Lloyd George and Donald was not restored until 1917. Their shared aversion to a negotiated peace brought them together, but Donald continued, as he saw fit, to question the prime minister's decisions. Lesser incursions became gravely compounded by the appointment of Major-General Sir Frederick Maurice as the <span class="italic">Chronicle</span>'s military correspondent. Interpreting this as a calculated provocation, Lloyd George determined to curb Donald's independence.<br>
<br>In September 1918, after a series of earlier efforts had failed, Frank Lloyd was bought out for &pound;1.6 million. Donald resigned, refusing to accept the editorship under the political control of a board chaired by Sir Henry Dalziel, who was Lloyd George's creature. Journalists generally agreed the whole transaction had been &#145;an especially unsavoury incident in the history of the modern political press&#146;  (Koss, 314). Donald was never to regain his former editorial prominence. In a speech that attracted much attention, he warned that editorial independence and freedom of thought were compromised when the press was controlled by ministers and run by businessmen.<br>
<br>Donald secured a substantial holding in the <span class="italic">Yorkshire Observer</span> and <span class="italic">Bradford Daily Telegraph</span>. From 1919 to 1921 he owned <span class="italic">The Globe</span>, London's oldest evening journal, but had to sell out. It would have been wiser to acknowledge his earlier experience with the <span class="italic">Echo and London Evening Chronicle</span> that he persuaded Lloyd to launch in February 1915; it folded within six weeks with losses of &pound;100,000. Donald possessed neither the peculiar gifts nor the financial resources to be a successful proprietor.<br>
<br>Between 1922 and 1924 Donald edited two Sunday papers, <span class="italic">The People</span> and <span class="italic">The Referee</span>. His resentment at Lloyd George's treatment of him was reflected in the uncharacteristically vituperative advice he offered Andrew Bonar Law on how to deal with Lloyd George in the forthcoming general election. &#145;Tell him he's a liar&#146;  (Donald to A. Bonar Law, 30 Oct 1922, Parl. Arch., Bonar Law MSS). He had long been a friend of Ramsay MacDonald, who, in 1931, made him chairman of the newly founded National Labour Party's publicity committee. Donald ran their fortnightly <span class="italic">News-Letter</span>. In the summer of 1932 he acquired the weekly <span class="italic">Everyman</span> as a vehicle for party propaganda. Donald was its chairman, managing director, editor, inspiration, and major contributor until his death.<br>
<br>In the last decade and a half of his life Donald was increasingly occupied with public affairs. He sat on royal commissions and committees that examined aspects of local government, wireless telegraphy, transport, and the empire. He helped to organize a series of imperial press conferences and was chairman of the Empire Press Union (1915&#150;26). In 1920 he was made an honorary doctor of laws of the University of Toronto, an honour he valued as much as the knighthood (GBE) conferred upon him in 1924. He expressed his concern about the problems of reconstruction in post-war Europe in three books: <span class="italic">A Danger Spot in Europe</span> (1925), <span class="italic">The Tragedy of Trianon</span> (1928), and <span class="italic">The Polish Corridor and the Consequences</span> (1930).<br>
<br>Donald's early entries in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> claimed he had &#145;no time to practise any recreations&#146;  (<span class="italic">WW</span>, 1904). Later he took up golf, for twenty-seven years was a member of the Walton Heath club, and captained the London Press Golfing Society (1914&#150;20). Genial and urbane, he was a shrewd observer and critic of public affairs. In controversy he was not disposed to hedge or trim and could be tenacious and combative. He never sought the limelight as an editor. He ran the <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span>, by his own admission, upon rather old-fashioned lines: &#145;No modern journalism but good solid stuff&#146;. He was impervious to Northcliffe's ironic response, &#145;My dear fellow, why not print it in Gothic type?&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journals and Letters of Reginald, Viscount Esher</span>, ed. M. V. Brett, 1934, 2.275). Just and considerate, the hallmark of Donald's journalism was his honesty and independence. Donald died in London on 17 February 1933 at his home, 12 Thorney Court, Kensington.<br>
