<span class="headword">Humphreys <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Gollan]</span>,  Eliza Margaret Jane</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Rita; <em>known as </em>Mrs W. Desmond Humphreys]</span>  (1850&#150;1938), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 14 June 1850 at Gollanfield, Inverness-shire, the daughter of John Gilbert Gollan, who had been in business in India, and his wife, the daughter of the manager of the Bank of Bengal. John Gollan had returned to Scotland on inheriting the family estate, and his daughter often referred to him as &#145;the Laird&#146;. As a child, Eliza Gollan accompanied her parents and brother to Sydney, Australia, where her father pursued a business venture, but this proved disappointing, and the family returned to England, settling in London, when she was fourteen. Her Australian experience is reflected in the semi-autobiographical novel <span class="italic">Sheba</span>, published under the pseudonym Rita in 1889. She had no formal education to speak of, but showed very early a flair for writing stories.<br>
<br>On 23 July 1872 Eliza Gollan married Karl Otto Edmund Booth, a professional musician. His father was German, his mother English, but Eliza's description of her father-in-law as a baron seems unfounded, as was her use of the name von Booth. The marriage lasted long enough to produce three sons, but ended unhappily, later providing material for <span class="italic">S&acirc;ba Macdonald</span> (1906), and also for her Victorian trilogy: <span class="italic">Grandmother</span> (1927), <span class="italic">The Wand'ring Darling</span> (1928), and <span class="italic">Jean and Jeanette</span> (1929). Her second marriage, to an Anglo-Irish professional singer, William Ernest Humphreys (who used the stage name Desmond Humphreys), was a success. A daughter, Dorothy, was born in 1891. After a short stay at Youghal, in Humphreys' native county, Cork, the family lived for several years at Bournemouth, then moved to Bath.<br>
<br>As a writer, Rita greatly admired Ouida, and came to be seen as a rival to Marie Corelli, having much in common with both writers. She was extremely prolific, with nearly 120 titles to her name, and worked in various genres, producing novels, short stories, plays, and essays. Her first published work, which appeared when the author was still in her twenties, was <span class="italic">Vivienne</span> (1877), and others followed rapidly and frequently, with titles such as <span class="italic">My Lady Coquette</span> (1881), <span class="italic">My Lord Conceit</span> (1884), and <span class="italic">Good Mrs. Hypocrite</span> (1897). Her characters were frequently aristocratic, and the books often had fashionable foreign settings (partly owing to the influence of her European honeymoon). She first began to receive widespread recognition as a popular writer with her <span class="italic">Dame Durden</span> (1883). <span class="italic">Peg the Rake</span> (1894) sold 160,000 copies, a large number for those days, and was her first novel with an Irish setting or Irish characters, thereafter a consistent feature of her work.<br>
<br>The year 1894 also saw the appearance of <span class="italic">A Husband of No Importance</span>, the first of the books in which Rita expressed a critical attitude to current patterns in social life. With a nod to Oscar Wilde's <span class="italic">A Woman of No Importance</span>, which had opened in 1893, it forms an attack upon the then-prevalent &#145;new woman&#146; novel. Although Eliza Humphreys herself, by this time, was a successful professional woman (and a founder member of the Writers' Club for Women), she disapproved of women &#145;aping men&#146;, and especially disliked what would later be called polemical feminism. In <span class="italic">Souls</span> (1903), she scathed pretentious and vicious society women in search of new sensations, following this up with a series of articles (&#145;The sin and scandal of the &#147;smart&#148; set&#146;), in the periodical <span class="italic">The Gentlewoman</span>, and with another fictional indictment, <span class="italic">Queer Lady Judas</span> (1905). In 1907 she produced <span class="italic">Personal Opinions Publicly Expressed</span>, in which one essay was entitled &#145;The increase of vulgarity amongst women&#146;. Rita saw the United States as a source of bad examples, a theme to which she returned after a visit to that country, in <span class="italic">America through English Eyes</span> (1910).<br>
<br>Eliza Humphreys had long been critical of &#145;Church&#146; Christianity, and considered Mrs Humphry Ward's <span class="italic">Robert Elsmere</span> (1888) &#145;one of the bravest and best books of the past century&#146;. She met Madame Blavatsky and became interested in theosophy, and problems of religious belief and conduct dominate Rita's <span class="italic">Calvary: a Tragedy of Sects</span> (1909), a novel which she maintained meant more to her than any other book that she had written. It was made into a film, as also were <span class="italic">Grim Justice</span> and <span class="italic">The Iron Stair</span>, and income from that source helped her through the difficult years of the First World War. In the post-war world, however, with its changed tastes in literature, she found herself in ever greater financial trouble, especially as her husband became an invalid. She was forced to apply to the Royal Literary Fund, and also sought a civil-list pension. These were refused her (&#145;it being obvious that the standard of this lady's work did not qualify her&#146;), but in 1930 she was given an award from the Royal Bounty Fund (her novels had been greatly liked by Queen Mary, who ordered a complete set of them for her private bookcase).<br>
<br>In her <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> entry (found under Rita), Eliza Humphreys said that she was a great lover of the theatre, and she wrote several plays, none of which, however, enjoyed much success. That was true also of her post-war novels, although they continued to receive respectful notices in the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span>. Her last work of fiction was <span class="italic">The Marriage Comedy</span> (1934), and her final book her autobiography, <span class="italic">Recollections of a Literary Life</span> (1936). In his preface to this, her friend Sir Philip Gibbs wrote: &#145;Somehow I think of &#147;Rita&#148;'s readers as lying on deck-chairs in pre-war summers, as tourists in Venice and other pleasant places where well-to-do English people used to take their holidays.&#146;<br>
<br>Rita's writing was always fluent and lively, but occasionally marred by repetitiveness and inconsistencies, and her educational shortcomings sometimes showed. Characters rather than plot were her forte, but, in her prime, she was none the less an extremely popular novelist. Eliza Humphreys died of heart failure at 239 West Brow, Combe Down, Bath, on 1 January 1938; her husband died in the following year.<br>
