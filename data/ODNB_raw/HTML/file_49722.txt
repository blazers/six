<span class="headword">Forster,  Frances Egerton  Arnold-</span>  (1857&#150;1921), <span class="occ">ecclesiastical historian</span>, was born on 7 August 1857 at Dharmsala, Punjab, India, the fourth child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/690/', "William Delafield Arnold (1828&#150;1859)")</script>, director of public instruction in the Punjab, and his wife, Frances Anne Hodgson (<i>d</i>. 1858). Her grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/686/', "Thomas Arnold")</script> of Rugby. Following the death of their mother in India in 1858, Frances, her sister, Florence Mary, and her brothers, Edward Penrose and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30459/', "Hugh Oakeley Arnold-Forster")</script>, were sent to England. Their father died at Gibraltar in 1859 before their arrival. They were adopted and brought up by their maternal aunt, Jane Martha Arnold, daughter of Thomas Arnold, and her husband, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9926/', "W. E. Forster")</script>, at their home at Burley in Wharfedale, in the West Riding of Yorkshire. They took the surname Arnold-Forster in adult life. Frances was initially educated at home, then at a private girls' school. As an active member of the Church Missionary Society and the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, she was involved in the work of the school and mission connected with the Anglican church of St James-the-Less, Lillington Street, west London. Most of her published several works, notably <span class="italic">Heralds of the Cross</span> (1882), containing stories of missionary work abroad, and <span class="italic">The King's Business</span> (1909), also a biographical compilation based on missionary society reports, were intended for young readers. However, her <span class="italic">Studies in Church Dedications, or, England's Patron Saints</span> (3 vols., 1899) was the product of independent scholarly research in diocesan and county records. It stemmed from her interest in a topic she pioneered: the significance of church dedications for local history. It was the first systematic study of its subject, on which it long remained the standard authority. The book combines statistical analysis with pious but lively commentaries on the lives of the saints and church fathers. It was written in conditions of considerable domestic difficulty while the author was nurse and companion to her widowed aunt and looking after her sister's young children. She herself suffered from mental stress and had often to lay her work aside. Frances Arnold-Forster died unmarried at Belmont Grove, Leeds, on 8 July 1921.<br>
