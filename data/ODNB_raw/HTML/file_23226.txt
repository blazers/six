<span class="headword">Reade,  John Edmund</span>  (1800&#150;1870), <span class="occ">poet and novelist</span>, was born at Broadwell, Gloucestershire, the son of Thomas Reade (1762&#150;1837) of Barton Manor, Berkshire, and his wife, Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1830), daughter of Sir John Hill. His grandfather Sir John Reade (1721&#150;1773) was fifth baronet. Reade was educated at a school at Doulting Sheepslate, near Shepton Mallet. His first work, a collection of poems entitled <span class="italic">The Broken Heart</span>, was published in 1825. From that time until the close of his life he devoted himself to writing, and developed a remarkable capacity for imitation that often verged on plagiarism. Byron was his chief model, but his poems and plays are full of sentiments and phrases taken undisguisedly from the best-known writings of Scott, Wordsworth, Ben Jonson, and others. His ablest work, <span class="italic">Cain the Wanderer</span>, was published in 1829, and it obtained for its author an introduction to Coleridge and a eulogy from Goethe. Although Reade claimed to have made a sketch of a &#145;Cain&#146; while still a boy, the work is redolent of Byron's play. In 1838, after a long stay in the south of Europe, he published <span class="italic">Italy: a Poem</span>, which while huge was shortened through the editing of Leigh Hunt and others. It bears a close resemblance to <span class="italic">Childe Harold</span>, reproducing even the dying gladiator.<br>
<br>Altogether Reade published nine volumes of poetry, mostly on sacred subjects, together with successively enlarged collected editions, beginning in 1852. To these were added five verse dramas, three novels, and a book of travels, <span class="italic">Prose from the South</span> (1849). His early poetry shared with the painter John Martin a histrionic attraction to biblical catastrophe, and was dismissed by Thomas Lister as theatrical &#145;clap-trap&#146; in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>  (Lister, 109). Thirty years later <span class="italic">Wait and Hope</span> was included in H. L. Mansell's <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> survey of &#145;sensation novels&#146;, along with the works of Braddon and Collins, only to be found a &#145;very dull tale&#146; full of &#145;insufferably tedious conversations&#146;  (<span class="italic">QR</span>, 113, 1863, 501). Reade was perceived as an inept sycophant by some other poets; his Bath acquaintance W. S. Landor savaged <span class="italic">A Record of the Pyramids</span> in 1842, especially the lengthy preface, full of &#145;unwearied flatteries&#146; and &#145;piteous complaints&#146;, and he concluded that &#145;we would rather that a friend of ours should have written the three worst pages of Mrs. Hemans&#146; than the nine thousand lines of <span class="italic">A Record</span>  (<span class="italic">Blackwood</span>, 114). Macready claimed in 1839 that Reade, a &#145;ludicrously wretched fellow&#146; attempted &#145;to <i>bribe</i> me by a promise of dedicating his miserable play to me, to act it&#146;. The Drury Lane manager was also annoyed that the manuscript was a palimpsest of previous attempts at dedication  (<span class="italic">Diaries of William Charles Macready</span>, 1.498). Despite the contempt of the literary world, Reade's works did have an audience, chiefly among the religious.<br>
<br>Most of Reade's life was spent in Bath and the west of England, but he was in the habit of making long journeys to central and southern Europe. He married his cousin, Maria Louisa, elder daughter of George Compton Reade, on 1 October 1847; they had a daughter, Agnes Coralie. Reade died of heart disease on 17 September 1870 at Budleigh Salterton, Devon.<br>
