<span class="headword">Bibby,  Joseph</span>  (1851&#150;1940), <span class="occ">animal feed and soap manufacturer</span>, was born on 12 January 1851 at Conder Mill, Vale of Conder, Lancashire, the second of the three sons of James Bibby, farmer and miller, and his wife, Amelia Barnett. He attended an elementary school until 1861 and the Abbeystead School, Over Wyresdale, until 1865; he then joined his father in the milling business. An avid reader, he studied privately in his spare time.<br>
<br>Bibby was at first employed in a newly acquired warehouse in Lancaster, distributing the produce of the family mill, but he hankered after less restrictive employment. Soon after his twenty-first birthday, in 1872, he travelled steerage to Canada. Then, after six months in the United States, he was encouraged to return home by his father, who promised him and his younger brother James greater responsibility in the running of the firm.<br>
<br>Having seen at first hand the dramatic increases taking place in North American grain production, which would inevitably affect the livelihoods of millers in Britain, Bibby planned to diversify into the production of animal feeds. In 1878 he and his brother James were made partners in what became J. Bibby &amp; Sons, when their father went into semi-retirement from the business. This allowed Bibby to begin research into improving the specifications of cattle feed. Hitherto, most farmers had used whatever fodder the merchants had on offer, sometimes to the detriment of their livestock. Bibby therefore experimented, on a small farm, with the development of specially blended (or compound) feeds for different requirements, such as rapid fattening, higher milk yields, or calf rearing. In 1881 he married Ruth Pye (1858&#150;1946), two of whose sisters successively married his brother James. Joseph and Ruth had six sons (one of whom died in infancy) and two daughters.<br>
<br>As demand for feedstuffs grew, in 1882 Bibby felt able to replace the Lancaster warehouse by a five-storey steam mill, with a milling capacity of 60 tons a week. This was burnt down in 1885, the year the brothers decided to transfer milling to Liverpool, the major port for the transatlantic grain trade. There, they leased two upper floors of a warehouse very close to the docks; they also installed Anglo-American hydraulic presses for crushing seeds and extracting the oil. After rapid growth in 1886&#150;8, they transferred the firm's head office to Liverpool and closed the Lancaster operations.<br>
<br>James Bibby used his organizational skills and sound judgement to the full on the production side, with a cousin acting as manager. In 1892 the mill at Liverpool was also badly damaged by fire and immediately rebuilt on an ampler scale. That year the firm planned to make soap with its stocks of oil, Bibby's Pure Soap appearing in 1896. Meanwhile, the energetic and publicity-minded Joseph Bibby managed the marketing side. He set up a team of direct representatives, who gradually replaced the earlier non-exclusive mercantile agents.<br>
<br>Joseph Bibby often said that, if the accident of birth had not made him a miller, he would certainly have gone into journalism; as the opportunity arose, he spent more and more time on writing and editorship. From 1886 onwards, he produced several one-off magazines, and in 1896 he launched <span class="italic">Bibby's Quarterly</span>. Intended mainly for farmers, it contained material of agricultural interest (including photographs of livestock reared on Bibby's feeds), as well as general articles. Of good technical quality, from 1904 to 1905 (when it closed) it was printed by a subsidiary plant of the firm. By then it had become an almost exclusively literary and artistic magazine, with excellent colour reproductions of celebrated paintings. Agricultural matters were covered in <span class="italic">Bibby's Farm and Dairy Notes</span>, published quarterly between 1905 and 1928. From 1906 to 1922 Joseph Bibby also produced <span class="italic">Bibby's Annual</span>.<br>
<br>Although brought up in a devout Methodist family, in 1889 Joseph Bibby joined the Theosophical Society. A number of articles by Annie Besant, and by other theosophists, subsequently appeared in his publications. A lifelong teetotaller, as a member of the Theosophical Society he now became a vegetarian. Although he continued to attend Methodist services regularly, his mixture of beliefs embarrassed some fellow worshippers.<br>
<br>By 1900 J. Bibby &amp; Sons was claiming to have the largest feeding-cake mill in the world. Despite intense competition from rivals, it succeeded in doubling the output of animal feeds from about 100,000 tons in 1902 to 200,000 tons in 1914. With assets valued at about &pound;1 million and a workforce of 3000, it had reached a size where it needed to become a limited company. In August 1914 J. Bibby &amp; Sons Ltd was registered, with issued capital of &pound;500,000. James Bibby was elected chairman, while Joseph, at the age of sixty-three, became vice-chairman. During the 1920s the company introduced a number of measures designed to improve the working conditions of staff: these included non-contributory pensions, subsidized canteens, workers' councils, and a recreation centre. Three sons of Joseph and three sons of James became directors, and this allowed their fathers to pursue other interests.<br>
<br>Joseph Bibby served as a Liberal member of Liverpool city council between 1904 and 1911, and was also a JP. He continued to write on social questions, and his books on <span class="italic">Social Progress</span> (1926) and <span class="italic">Capitalism, Socialism and Unemployment</span> (1929) were published by the firm. On James's death in 1928, Joseph succeeded him as chairman, but concerned himself little with running the business. He died at his home, The Priory, Upton Road, Bidston, Birkenhead, Cheshire, on 11 March 1940. He was survived by his wife.<br>
