<span class="headword">Trevelyan, Sir  George Lowthian</span>, fourth baronet  (1906&#150;1996), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born on 5 November 1906 at 14 Great College Street, Westminster, the eldest of three sons and the second of seven children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36553/', "Sir Charles Philips Trevelyan, third baronet (1870&#150;1958)")</script>, politician and landowner, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53939/', "Mary Katharine Trevelyan (1881&#150;1966)")</script>, youngest daughter of Sir Hugh Bell, second baronet. He was the grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36555/', "Sir George Otto Trevelyan, second baronet")</script>, and the nephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36554/', "George Macaulay Trevelyan")</script>. His father was Liberal MP for Elland (1899&#150;1918) and Labour MP for Newcastle upon Tyne Central (1922&#150;31), and president of the Board of Education in Ramsay MacDonald's two Labour administrations. George Trevelyan grew up on the family estate at Wallington, Northumberland, attended school at Sidcot, in the Mendips, and in 1925 followed the family tradition by going up to Trinity College, Cambridge, to read history. There he was master of the lake hunt, a chase over the lakeland fells that had been founded by his historian uncle, George Macaulay Trevelyan, and his friend George Winthrop Young, in 1898.<br>
<br>Trevelyan's first interest on leaving Cambridge was making furniture, and he gained experience at the workshops of Peter Waals at Chalford, Gloucestershire. He then spent four years learning and teaching the F. M. Alexander re-education method. Subsequently he moved to Scotland to teach history, literature, woodwork, and outdoor pursuits at Gordonstoun School, when Kurt Hahn was headmaster. He then took up a post at Abinger Hill Preparatory School, near Dorking, Surrey. It was there that he met a fellow schoolteacher and artist, (Editha) Helen Lindsay Smith (1900/01&#150;1994), daughter of Colonel John Lindsay Smith, of the Indian Army Service Corps. They married on 14 August 1940 and later adopted a daughter, Catriona (<i>b</i>. 1944). Trevelyan returned to Scotland for most of the Second World War, when, as a captain in the rifle brigade, he was engaged in training home defence forces.<br>
<br>Trevelyan apparently had visions of making Wallington into a centre for adult education. This seemed thwarted when, in 1941, his father announced that he would be handing over the estate to the National Trust  (Cannadine, 169); Trevelyan was always reticent in later life in speaking about his ancestors. Nevertheless, on demobilization he gained skills in teaching adults at the army college at Dalkeith, and in 1947 he was appointed first warden of Shropshire Adult College, established at Attingham Park, the eighteenth-century mansion 4 miles east of Shrewsbury that had been the home of the Hill family, barons Berwick, and had formed part of a military base during the Second World War. The college was one of many initiatives launched by H. Martin Wilson, secretary for education for Shropshire county council. Trevelyan proved an inspired appointment. The volume published in 1965 to mark Wilson's retirement commented that Attingham had been &#145;born of the wartime sense of the unity of the community&#146; and that Attingham was &#145;an essential part of adult education in the county, particularly reflecting the enthusiasm and devotion of its first and only Warden, Sir George Trevelyan&#146;  (<span class="italic">Education in Shropshire</span>, 77&#150;8).<br>
<br>Attingham was one of more than twenty similar colleges founded in the late 1940s with the aim of providing short courses that would be open to all. Several of these colleges, including Attingham, had a profound, if informal, influence on the development of scholarship. This type of institution effectively disappeared from the educational scene in the last quarter of the twentieth century. Trevelyan promoted the college with much energy. It became a centre for music-making, drama, and film appreciation. Mid-week it was used for teacher training, for business conferences, and by university departments as a base for fieldwork. It was most influential as a location for weekend courses that were open to the public, the first of which began on 21 August 1948 and the last concluded on 25 November 1975, some four years after Trevelyan retired. The college was an independent foundation supported by the local educational charity, the Walker Trust, the University of Birmingham, and Shropshire county council, the organization of courses being part of the duties of some of the staff of the two latter bodies. Trevelyan responded with enthusiasm to suggestions from colleagues for courses of many kinds, often far outside his own spheres of interest. He encouraged courses that stimulated awareness of new directions in scholarship in botany, forestry, the needs of gifted children, film and television studies, folk-song, and the workshop approach to theatre. Attingham proved influential in the development of social history, historical demography, industrial archaeology, and garden history.<br>
<br>Trevelyan had a strikingly handsome appearance and resonant speech. His manner was both welcoming and patrician, and some students at the college gained the impression that Attingham was his ancestral home. He himself dispensed cider to students at dinner and conducted short, non-denominational religious services before the start of teaching on Sunday mornings. He was an exuberant participant in field trips and delighted in scrambling up steep slopes. He may have been disappointed that he did not inherit Wallington but found satisfaction, as he wrote in the college prospectus, that &#145;Attingham has found one of the happiest solutions to the problem of full use of a country house&#146;.<br>
<br>Many of Trevelyan's beliefs sprang directly from Trevelyan family traditions and can also be seen in the life of his uncle the historian. His reading in poetry was wide and deep, and he could quote readily and at length. He had strong commitments to craftsmanship, to the countryside (which he loved to explore on foot), and to adult education. He was also interested in spiritual matters, and in 1942 had been attracted to the ideas of Rudolph Steiner. While he encouraged colleagues to run courses on many subjects he had particular interests of his own about which he permitted no debate during programme planning. Some related to craftsmanship; several of his own, elegantly crafted chairs adorned the college, and for many years he gave great encouragement to the making of mosaics. Such courses were uncontroversial but his courses on spiritual topics did raise some concerns among academic colleagues, particularly when, as with a course entitled &#145;The significance of the group in the new age&#146;, a Michaelmas festival in 1965, it was acknowledged in publicity that they were intended for &#145;a small and mainly invited group&#146;. Subsequent courses included &#145;Man know thyself&#146;, in 1966, and &#145;Towards light and love&#146;, in 1967. Such topics embarrassed the governing body, which insisted that Attingham would no longer be available for such activities after Trevelyan retired in 1971.<br>
<br>As warden of Attingham Trevelyan facilitated developments in many disciplines. In retirement he came to be regarded as a prophet in the studies that are perhaps best summarized in the title of one of his courses, &#145;The primal oneness in diversity&#146;. He founded, and from 1971 to 1992 was director of, the Wrekin Trust, whose gatherings carried further the themes of his Attingham courses. He encouraged responsible attitudes to the planet, sought common elements within the great religions of the world, and found spiritual values in literature. Though smitten by arthritis, he travelled extensively, addressing conferences (including an annual gathering of &#145;Mystics and Scientists&#146;), helped to set up many groups in Britain and overseas, and readily conversed with many who saw themselves as &#145;New Age&#146; thinkers and acknowledged him as a prophet. He published a succession of books, which included a trilogy entitled <span class="italic">The Aquarian Redemption</span>, comprising <span class="italic">A Vision of the Aquarian Age</span> (1977), <span class="italic">Operation Redemption</span> (1981), and <span class="italic">Exploration into God</span> (1991), and <span class="italic">Magic Casements: the Use of Poetry in the Expanding of Consciousness</span> (1980). He was closely involved with the Findhorn Foundation, the Gatekeeper and Open Gate trusts, the Teilhard de Chardin Society, and the Essene Network. In 1982 he was awarded the Right Livelihood award&#151;established by the Swede Jacob Von Yxkull&#151;for his work in &#145;educating the adult spirit to a new non-materialistic vision of human nature&#146; and for his contribution to &#145;healing the planet&#146;. He died, of rheumatoid arthritis and renal failure, on 7 February 1996 at his home, the Old Vicarage, Hawkesbury, near Badminton, Avon. He had succeeded his father as fourth baronet in 1958, and in turn was succeeded by his younger brother, Geoffrey Washington Trevelyan (<i>b</i>. 1920). He was survived by his adopted daughter, Catriona, his wife, Helen, having predeceased him.<br>
