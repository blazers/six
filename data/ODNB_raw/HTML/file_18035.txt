<span class="headword">Marckant,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1586), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and poet</span>, is of obscure origins. Through the patronage of John, Lord Darcy, he was inducted vicar of Great Clacton, Essex, in August 1559, a living which he retained until his death. He also held the Essex vicarage of Shopland from 1563 until his resignation in 1568. Other biographical details are scant, although he may have been the John Markan who was a scholar of St John's College, Cambridge, and a fellow of Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1555.<br>
<br>Marckant contributed to the English metrical psalter produced by the court poet Thomas Sternhold and the Suffolk minister John Hopkins, the first complete edition of which appeared in 1562. The singing of metrical psalms had become popular under Edward VI among the continental protestant &eacute;migr&eacute;s sheltering in London, and the tradition continued among the English protestants exiled in Europe during Mary's reign. Although not officially part of the Elizabethan liturgy, congregational psalm singing was allowed under the royal injunctions of 1559, and was swiftly adopted by godly congregations. Marckant translated psalms 118, 131, 132, and 135. These were initialled &#145;M.&#146; in the earliest editions, but in 1565 his surname was printed in full; it occasionally also appears as &#145;Market&#146;. The Sternhold and Hopkins psalter reigned unchallenged until the new version by Tate and Brady of 1696, and retained its place in English parish churches well into the nineteenth century. Marckant was also responsible for two additional prayers in the 1562 psalter: the eleven-stanza &#145;The Lamentation of a Sinner&#146;, an urgent entreaty to be admitted at the gate of mercy and not held to strict account, which also became known as a hymn; and a plea for grace, &#145;The Humble Sute of a Sinner&#146;, expressing the plaintiff's real hope of finding a place with the angels and the saints.<br>
<br>Taken together, his devotion to the psalms and his cure of souls in Essex imply that Marckant was influenced by Calvinism. Evidently not one to hide the light of Christ under a bushel, he turned from the metrical psalter to the popular press. In 1571 the Fleet Street printer Wylliam Gryffith produced a broadside ballad by Marckant, <span class="italic">A Notable Instruction for All Men to Beware the Abuses of Dice Wyne and Wemen</span>. This tells the story of a once affluent man who has frittered away his wealth on wine, gambling, fine apparel, and the base delights of &#145;Venus Pallace&#146;. The reader is lectured by the anonymous unfortunate, who ruefully reflects upon his lost youth, squandered among women who loved him only for the pounds in his pocket:<blockquote>
<div>Let this example of my smarte, teache others to be ware<br>
</div>
<div>Of Wemen, Dyce and Wyne also, which have made me thus bare.<br>
</div>
<div>For where my Parents gave to me, great summes of golde most fyne,<br>
</div>
<div>That I consumd at dauncinge schole, on Wemen Dyce and Wyne.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>So low has he sunk, admits the wanton, that he has come close to taking his own life at &#145;Tyborne tree&#146;. But Marckant concludes his vividly imagined portrait of one man's descent into degeneracy with a message of hope: those who hold fast in the love of God &#145;can not want or quayle&#146;. One further verse ballad can be attributed to Marckant, namely <span class="italic">The Purgacion of the Ryght Honourable Lord Wentworth, Concerning the Crime Layde to his Charge</span> (1559), for which Owen Rogers was fined for printing without entering. Other of Marckant's compositions are known only from the Stationers' register, including &#145;With speed retorne to God&#146;, and &#145;Verses to Diverse Good Purposes&#146;, the latter licensed to Thomas Purfoote in November 1580. John Marckant was dead by 24 February 1586, when he was succeeded by Hugh Smith as vicar of Clacton.<br>
