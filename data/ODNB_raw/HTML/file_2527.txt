<span class="headword">Blackmore,  William</span>  (1616&#150;1684), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was born on 24 June 1616, the second son of William Blackmore, a member of London's Fishmongers' Company. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School in London and matriculated from Lincoln College, Oxford, in 1635; he graduated BA in 1638 and proceeded MA in 1641. Blackmore's first employment in the ministry of the church was in December 1645 at the Essex parish of Pentlow. He owed this position to the parliamentarian committee for plundered ministers, filling the place of the ejected minister Edward Alston.<br>
<br>Blackmore did not remain long at Pentlow and in September 1646 obtained the committee's acceptance of his resignation in order to move to the London parish of St Peter Cornhill. He had been elected by the parishioners of St Peter's in June 1646 to replace Thomas Coleman, the ailing Westminster assembly divine who was the key opponent of the high presbyterianism of men like Blackmore. Unlike the Erastian Coleman, Blackmore believed firmly in the presbyterian system of church government and put into effect the regime of ruling elders at St Peter's. The younger Calamy notes that he was particularly strict in catechizing the young of the parish. Despite his rigid presbyterianism, Blackmore found himself in trouble in April 1647 with the local presbyterian classis. In 1641 he had received deacon's orders from Bishop Prideaux of Worcester, but the fourth London classis demanded that he take full orders before they would permit him to continue to administer the sacrament at St Peter's. In order to test his qualification for the ministry, the fourth classis set Blackmore a telling thesis topic: &#145;an cui competat ex officio praedicare, competat sacramenta administrare?&#146; (&#145;if a person's office gives him the ability to preach, does it make him competent to administer the sacraments?&#146;). The classis must have known of his competence in this area of theology, for in 1646 London's presbyterian ministers had chosen Blackmore to write the section on ordination by imposition of hands in their treatise on the divine right of presbyterianism, the <span class="italic">Jus divinum regiminis ecclesiastici</span> (1646).<br>
<br>Blackmore later became a stalwart of the London provincial assembly, the governing synod of London's ramshackle presbyterian system, serving in 1648 as its scribe and later on its ruling grand committee. He was a signatory to the <span class="italic">Testimony to the Truth of Jesus Christ</span> (1647), a document calling for parliament to be intolerant of religious heterodoxy and fully to support the presbyterian reformation of the church. He was also involved with Sion College, the religious club of civil-war presbyterianism, being elected junior dean in 1658&#150;9 and senior dean in 1660.<br>
<br>As a key London presbyterian Blackmore was involved in the attempts to halt the political crisis of 1648&#150;9. He signed the <span class="italic">Serious and Faithful Representation</span> (1649) petitioning Lord General Fairfax to put a stop to the king's trial, and later signed the <span class="italic">Vindication of the Ministers of the Gospel</span> (1649) in defence of that petition. After the execution of Charles I he became involved in the City presbyterian plot to restore Charles II to the throne. He was implicated with Christopher Love, who was later condemned and executed for treason, and was suspended by the Commonwealth regime from his post at St Peter's. Although his freedom was secured by the surety of his elder brother, Sir John Blackmore, later governor of St Helena, the Commonwealth regime replaced Blackmore with Thomas Hodges. However, Blackmore maintained the support of at least seventy of St Peter's vestry, who petitioned the corporation of London on 13 May 1656 for his return to the parish. This caused a division in the parish and a number of parishioners presented a counter-petition in favour of Hodges, complaining of Blackmore's &#145;dull and heavie ministry&#146;. Blackmore won the dispute and was reinstituted on 17 October 1656. Hodges tried to gain possession of the living again in 1660, but the parliamentary commissioners upheld Blackmore's title as the rector of St Peter's.<br>
<br>Hodges finally won the struggle in 1662 when Blackmore's conscience directed him to join the ranks of the ejected clergy. By the time of the great ejection Blackmore had gathered a respectable estate and used this wealth to retire to the village of Hornchurch in Essex. Here he kept a conventicle in his house and was licensed as a presbyterian during the king's indulgence of 1672. Blackmore married three times: his first wife, Martha, died in 1658; Mary Chewning, whom he married at St Mary's Islington on 1 May 1660, died in 1678; and his third wife, Sarah Luttrell, survived him and died in March 1694. Blackmore himself died at Hare Street, Essex, in 1684 and on 18 July was buried at Romford in the same county.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_2527"></a><span class="headword">Chewning Blackmore</span>  (1663&#150;1737), <span class="occ">Independent minister</span>, was born on 1 January 1663 and was baptized at St Peter Cornhill on 2 January 1663, the only surviving son of William Blackmore and Mary Chewning. He was educated at John Woodhouse's academy in Sheriffhales in Shropshire because of the ban on nonconformists entering universities, and followed his father into the church. In 1688 he became the assistant to Thomas Badland at the congregational church in Worcester, where he remained for the rest of his life. He married Abigail Higgins in 1694 and together they had two sons: Francis, who was the Presbyterian minister at Evesham (1728&#150;30), Coventry (1730&#150;42), and Worcester (1743&#150;61), and Edward, who became the Presbyterian minister at Stoke, near Malvern. Chewning Blackmore died on 2 August 1737.<br>
