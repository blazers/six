</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Secker,  Thomas</span>  (1693&#150;1768), <span class="occ">archbishop of Canterbury</span>, was born at Sibthorp, a small village in the Vale of Belvoir, in Nottinghamshire, on 21 September 1693; he was the second of three children of Thomas Secker (<i>bap</i>. 1631, <i>d</i>. 1700)&#151;son of Leonard Secker, a butcher from Marston, Lincolnshire&#151;and his third wife, Abigail (1665/6&#150;1707), daughter of George Brough, a gentleman farmer from Shelton in Nottinghamshire. His father's elder brother William, in an interesting anticipation of the career of his more famous nephew, conformed to the Church of England and became vicar of All Hallows-the-Less, London, in 1663, and in 1667 rector of Lee, Essex, where he died in 1681. Secker's father was a nonconformist with a small income that enabled him to get by without pursuing any regular employment. The names of his first and second wives remain unknown. With his second wife he had a daughter, Elizabeth, who married Richard Milnes, a member of a well-established Chesterfield family. With his third wife, whom he married in 1685, his eldest child was Abigail-Anna, born in 1690, and his youngest, George, born in 1696. Having acquired a young family to support at a relatively late age he rented a farm at Sibthorp from John Holles, duke of Newcastle, for &pound;100 p.a., which led him to be designated a yeoman in contemporary records; he died at Sibthorp in 1700. According to Secker his father had been &#145;a pious &amp; virtuous &amp; sensible man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, fol. 3), who, although he had resisted becoming a dissenting minister, had had high hopes that his son Thomas would do so. Later commentators indeed discerned that something of the archbishop's dissenting background and upbringing remained with him for the rest of his life, finding a perceived &#145;shyness in his behaviour&#146; and an &#145;affected quaintness in the tone of his voice&#146;  (Hasted, 12.511), which they associated with his nonconformist roots. After his father's death his mother married William Allen and continued to manage the Sibthorp farm until she died in 1707, aged forty-one.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsandeducation"></a>Early years and education</h2>In 1699 Secker was sent to live with his half-sister Elizabeth and her husband, Richard Milnes, in Chesterfield. He went to the free school there, where the master, Richard Brown, was a staunch supporter of the Church of England. An almost certainly apocryphal story recounts how, after Secker had done well in his lessons, Brown had congratulated him, saying &#145;If thou wouldst but come over to the Church, I am sure thou wouldst be a bishop&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 38.451). At the age of fifteen Secker was sent in 1708 to a dissenting academy at Attercliffe, near Sheffield, which was run by Timothy Jolly, an Independent minister; this was because, as he later recalled, &#145;some of my Acquaintance entic[ed] me, sometimes to drink, &amp; sometimes to go to Church&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, fol. 4). By then he had acquired a competent knowledge of Greek and Latin. He was, however, unhappy at Attercliffe, which was not a particularly scholarly establishment, and he noted tartly:<blockquote>I lost much of this Learning there, &amp; acquired but little instead of it. For only the old Philosophy of the Schools was taught there: and that neither ably nor diligently. The morals also of many of the young Men were bad. I spent my time there idly &amp; ill. (ibid.)</blockquote>He left after about eighteen months.To offset this unprofitable educational experience Secker, while at Attercliffe, had become acquainted with Henry Etough, who would later conform to the Church of England; Matthew Leesom, later a dissenting minister at Thame; and Joseph Sills, afterwards an Independent minister at Henley. More importantly he became friendly with John Bowes, a future lord chancellor of Ireland. In 1710 he went to lodge in Bowes's father's house in London and there he learned geometry, conic sections, algebra, and French, and he studied Locke's <span class="italic">Essay Concerning Human Understanding</span> (1690). He met the celebrated nonconformist divine and hymn-writer Isaac Watts, who also boarded at the Bowes's house. Watts advised Secker to go to an academy in Gloucester in the house of Joseph Wintle, a distiller, which was run by Samuel Jones, a dissenting layman. Jones had studied at Leiden and was a distinguished orientalist; under his tuition Secker soon regained his knowledge of Greek and Latin, and added to it Hebrew, Chaldee, and Syriac, which stood him in good stead in later life in his studies of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> and early church history. He was also taught Jewish antiquities, logic, and mathematics. His fellow students at Jones's academy included several who would later be influential in eighteenth-century religious circles: Joseph Butler and Isaac Maddox, who like Secker later conformed to the Church of England and became bishops; and Samuel Chandler, Daniel Scott, and Jeremiah Jones, who became leading nonconformist divines. In 1713 Jones moved his academy to Tewkesbury, borrowing &pound;200 from Secker to do so, but he soon took to drink and his teaching suffered as a result. Both Butler (February 1714) and Secker (June 1714) left the academy. While at Tewkesbury, Secker was privy to the correspondence between Butler and the influential latitudinarian Church of England clergyman Samuel Clarke about the latter's <span class="italic">A Demonstration of the Being and Attributes of God</span> (1705). To make sure that no one else knew of the correspondence Secker acted as a go-between, delivering Butler's letters by hand to the post office at Gloucester and bringing back Clarke's replies.<br>
<br>Having left Jones's academy Secker returned to Chesterfield. During the winter of 1714&#150;15 he was living at Nottingham with his sister Abigail-Anna when his brother-in-law, Samuel Wildboare, died; Secker helped to put her affairs in order. He was by now having serious reservations about being a dissenter. During this period he read up about various theological subjects, such as the doctrine of the Trinity, on which for the time being he agreed with Clarke's liberal and decidedly Arian views; the inspiration of scripture, where he was influenced by Richard Simon's <span class="italic">Sentiment de quelques th&eacute;ologiens d'Hollande sur l'histoire critique du Vieux Testament</span> (1685), which questioned the historicity of parts of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>; and subscription to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>, about which he corresponded with Butler, who was now studying at Oriel College, Oxford. Secker also read the principal writers on lay and ministerial conformity, and he went through the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> in the original Greek, with the help of commentaries. By the autumn of 1715 he was living in London, where he studied various theological works, particularly those concerning the primitive church, including the apostolic fathers, Eusebius's <span class="italic">Ecclesiastical History</span>, and William Whiston's <span class="italic">Primitive Christianity Revived</span> (1711), all of which were central to the debates between conformity and dissent.<h2>
<a name="Medicaltraining"></a>Medical training</h2>Secker now found himself accepting conformity to the Church of England as a layman but he was as yet unsure whether he could be ordained within the church. Because he needed more time to think matters through he began to apply himself to the subject of medicine, explaining his decision as &#145;a small change in my studies &hellip; from the spirit to the flesh&#146;  (Secker to John Fox, October 1716, in <span class="italic">Monthly Repository of Theology and General Literature</span>, 16.569). During the winter of 1716&#150;17 he took some anatomy courses with the leading surgeon William Cheselden. According to Secker, Cheselden was &#145;occasionally much given to irreligious talk&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, fol. 5). Mixing in such company allowed later opponents of the archbishop to criticize him for mocking religion in his youth. He was keen to stress in his autobiography&#151;which he wrote to ensure that &#145;Some Facts and dates may prevent certain Falsehoods, &amp; perhaps injurious falsehoods, from being spred concerning me hereafter&#146;  (ibid., fol. 1)&#151;that he had not shared his mentor's views, although letters from 1716 to 1718, which were printed in volume 16 of the <span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span> (1821), do indicate a certain irreverent tone. Secker then went to live with a Mr Bakewell, an apothecary who had a house in King Street in Cheapside and who taught the future archbishop the rudiments of medical prescriptions and practice.<br>
<br>In January 1718 Secker left for Paris, where he lodged with the renowned anatomist Jacques-B&eacute;nigne Winslow. Secker also learned dissection at the Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re&#151;a hospital that specialized in the care of poor patients and prostitutes. That an archbishop of the Church of England had dissected bodies was not mentioned by his future chaplain and biographer, Beilby Porteus, probably because this was considered an unseemly career path for one who had reached the highest position in the church. Secker's critics, on the other hand, made great play of this period in his life, accusing him of having received an unsuitable early training for an archbishop. While with Winslow, Secker worked at the Hotel Dieu Hospital and studied with J. F. A. Gregoire, the man-midwife and founder of the first obstetrics clinic. During his stay in France he also met Bernard-Sigefroi Albinus, professor at Leiden; Father Montfaucon, the patristic scholar; and Martin Benson, his future brother-in-law and, later, bishop of Gloucester.<br>
<br>Though primarily studying medicine Secker continued to read theology and kept up his correspondence with Joseph Butler, who had by then taken orders with the Church of England. Butler's close friend was Edward Talbot, archdeacon of Berkshire and son of the bishop of Salisbury, and Talbot thought that Secker should be persuaded to be ordained within the Church of England. He assured Butler that if Secker took orders his father, the bishop, who himself had had liberal theological opinions, would find him a living. Butler let Secker know of this scheme and Secker contemplated it for two months. His theological scruples about becoming ordained had in any case grown weaker following the Salters' Hall dispute of 1719, which had split the dissenting camp, and, as he admitted in his autobiography, he was increasingly concerned about the financial risks of taking on a medical career. In August 1720 he returned to England; he met Edward Talbot and they got on well. In December Talbot unfortunately died of smallpox but, true to his promise, he had recommended his friends to his father. Secker was advised by Thomas Rundle, another theological liberal and at the time chaplain to Bishop Talbot, that he should take an Oxford degree before proceeding to holy orders and that this would be made easier if he first took the degree of doctor of physic at Leiden. Secker graduated MD from Leiden in 1721 and his thesis, &#145;De medicina statica&#146;, was printed there later in the same year; it was reprinted by Haller in 1748 as part of his <span class="italic">Disputationum anatomicarum selectarum</span>, volume 3. The thesis was a critical study of the pioneering metabolic work of the Italian physician Santorio Sanctorius, and in it Secker demonstrated Sanctorius's dependence on previous authorities and challenged his experimental method for not being rigorous enough.<h2>
<a name="Oxfordordinationandmarriage"></a>Oxford, ordination, and marriage</h2>Secker returned to England and on 1 April 1721 entered Exeter College, Oxford, as a gentleman-commoner. Martin Benson, his friend from France, was a student of Christ Church; Rundle introduced him to John Conybeare, then a fellow of Exeter and later its rector and bishop of Bristol, who became Secker's &#145;nominal tutor&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, fol. 11); he also became acquainted with Arthur Charlett, master of University College, and William Delaune, president of St John's College. Secker soon became aware of the tory bias of the university: &#145;I soon found, that the Whigs could procure me no Academical Favour, &amp; therefore cultivated the Tories, particularly Dr Delaune&#146;  (ibid.). He also moved in non-juring circles for a time, mixing with the likes of Samuel Jebb, Thomas Carte, Sir John St Aubyn, and John King; in later years he was anxious to assert his loyalty to the government, claiming that though they did drink to the duke of Ormond they never drank the Pretender's health.<br>
<br>Secker lived in Oxford only as long as was needed to fulfil the residence requirements and was introduced to London society by Samuel Clarke, by then rector of St James's, Piccadilly, and George Berkeley, who became a close lifelong friend. There he spent much of his time at the houses of Bishop Talbot and of Mary Talbot, the widow of Edward. She had given birth to a daughter, Catherine, five months after her husband's death and lived with her companion, Catherine Benson, the sister of Secker's friend Martin. On 6 July 1722 Secker was admitted to the degree of BA as a result of a letter of recommendation from the chancellor. Talbot, now bishop of Durham, ordained Secker as deacon in St James's, Piccadilly, on 23 December 1722. On reviewing his relationship with the Church of England at the time of his ordination Secker stated in his autobiography that he had never officiated as a dissenting minister nor ever put himself forward as a candidate for the dissenting ministry, nor had he taken communion as a dissenter, and that he had constantly attended Anglican services since his return from France in 1720. Quite when Secker actually left dissent is not clear. Francis Blackburne later thought that the future archbishop gave up on nonconformity when he matriculated at Exeter College in 1721, because this necessitated subscription to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>; Secker's brother, George, however, suggested that he conformed when he was about seventeen. Secker's odyssey from dissent to conformity, and even the taking of orders within the Church of England, was common among nonconformists of his generation. In any case it may be misleading to draw too hard and fast a line between nonconformity and conformity in this period, given that it was not unusual to attend both the nonconformist meeting-house and the parish church. Even after his ordination it is likely that Secker retained his former liberal theological opinions and only slowly became a staunch defender of orthodox views. His ordination to the priesthood followed on 10 March 1723, again by Talbot in St James's, and it was here that he preached his first sermon, on 28 March. In July he went to Durham as joint chaplain to Bishop Talbot with Thomas Rundle, and preached the assize sermon at Newcastle upon Tyne. He was appointed to the valuable rectory of Houghton-le-Spring, near Durham, to which he was instituted on 12 February 1724, having first taken his MA at Oxford on 4 February. During the same year he helped his friend Joseph Butler to prepare for publication the sermons that he had earlier delivered at the Rolls chapel.<br>
<br>Secker's thoughts now turned to marriage. He proposed to Catherine Benson in April 1725&#151;her mother died from consumption shortly after the announcement&#151;and Bishop Talbot officiated at their marriage on 28 October in King Street Chapel, London. Though now married Catherine Secker did not want to stop sharing a house with Bishop Talbot's widowed daughter-in-law and her child, and so the two families lived together, both in the lodgings in Dover Street, London, and also at Houghton-le-Spring, where Secker was proving to be a hard-working rural incumbent. His medical knowledge came in handy in his northern parish and he regularly visited his sick parishioners, but Houghton was damp and Mrs Secker's health soon deteriorated; a plan was drawn up whereby Secker gave up Houghton for the more salubrious and prestigious rectory of Ryton, near Newcastle upon Tyne, where Dr Finney, the rector, was infirm and about to relinquish the living. For some reason the scheme was blocked by Thomas Rundle, whom Secker had for some time suspected to be &#145;selfish&#146; and &#145;jealous&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, fol. 13), and he advised the bishop to give Ryton to someone else. In the end the exchange went through and on 3 June 1727 Secker was instituted at Ryton and to the third prebend of Durham. He now lived mainly at Durham but went over every weekend to officiate at Ryton and spent three months there in the summer.<br>
<br>Mrs Secker's ill health continued to cause her husband concern and Secker took her first to London and then to Bath, where they stayed until 8 April 1728. There Secker met Ralph Allen and was present at the deathbed of George Stanhope, a leading high-church figure in Queen Anne's reign; he also cemented his friendship with George Berkeley and his wife. On returning to Durham, Secker was responsible, with Benson, for organizing the books and deeds of the cathedral; he paid methodical attention to ecclesiastical records throughout his career. Bishop Talbot died on 10 October 1730 and Secker preached the sermon at his funeral. He was now becoming well known as a preacher and, not unexpectedly, he was appointed a royal chaplain on 28 May 1732, on the recommendation of both Thomas Sherlock, bishop of Bangor, who had heard him preach in Bath, and Benson, who was also a chaplain to George II. This was to prove an important step in Secker's career, as his preaching abilities reached a wider circle, and he gained an increasing reputation; on 27 August he preached before Queen Caroline at St James's Chapel Royal. She was impressed by his performance and later invited him to attend her &#145;philosophical parties&#146;. In July 1733 he was invited to preach the Act sermon at Oxford, entitled &#145;On the advantages and duties of an academical education&#146;, before taking the degree of doctor of civil law. This otherwise well-regarded sermon was later attacked in print by William Webster, clerical editor of the <span class="italic">Weekly Miscellany</span>, for not including enough scriptural quotations, although Secker later gave Webster some support.<h2>
<a name="StJamessPiccadillyandthebishopricsofOxfordandBristol"></a>St James's, Piccadilly, and the bishoprics of Oxford and Bristol</h2>Secker's career as a prominent cleric was confirmed on 18 May 1733, when he was instituted as rector of St James's, Piccadilly, through the influence of Edmund Gibson, bishop of London. Secker continued to keep Ryton, and appointed a curate there. His methodical approach to work, his concern for accuracy and for keeping records in good order, and his evident business ability were soon seen at St James's, where immediately after his arrival he took vestry business in hand. He stopped the habit of spending money on treats for the parish and examined all the accounts of the officers, putting them in order and making rules for their use in the future. Not all the parishioners, however, were enamoured of Secker's business acumen and attention to detail. In his autobiography he noted that this became a running sore throughout his incumbency; in particular he remembered the trouble caused by Henry Fane, a wealthy parishioner, and Thomas Bonney, an assistant preacher in the parish, when he attempted to rent out part of the land belonging to the rectory to make the churchyard larger. He preached usually three Sundays a month at the parish church and, on the fourth, at each of the chapels of ease.<br>
<br>In December 1734 Secker unexpectedly received a letter from Bishop Gibson, informing him that George II had &#145;pitched&#146; on him for the bishopric of Bristol. &#145;I had made no Application for it to any Person,&#146; he later claimed, &#145;as indeed I never did for any thing, either before or afterwards&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, fol. 21). He was consecrated at Lambeth Palace on 19 January 1735. As was to be characteristic of Secker on obtaining a new appointment he immediately investigated the diocese's records, and discovered that those for the county of Dorset housed at Blandford had been destroyed by fire. A new diocesan survey was needed and he immediately undertook a visitation of his see. He began the visitation at Shaftesbury and confirmed in fifteen places, reaching Bristol on 10 September, where he gave 20 guineas for the erection of a statue of William III in Queen Square. He also contributed to church building in the diocese. The speculum, or diocesan book, that emerged from his visitation was used by his successors until the early nineteenth century.<br>
<br>In 1737 Secker was offered the bishopric of Oxford, which at first he refused because accepting it would, he felt, have been financially disadvantageous. He finally agreed to accept after being told that he would get a handsome sum of money for a life lease for lands at Hook Norton on account of the death of Lord Chancellor Talbot. At Oxford he proved as diligent and hard-working as at Bristol. His first major task was to organize a visitation of the diocese, which he undertook in 1738; the answers to his queries have been published in a modern edition and are an invaluable window into church life in the period. Secker collected information pertaining to the see and he composed, as he had done at Bristol and as he would do at Canterbury, a speculum of the diocese, which unfortunately is now lost. His letters to the clergy while bishop of Oxford, many of which survive, reveal him to have been a conscientious pastor&#151;a stickler for standards who demanded that clergy should give the best pastoral provision possible and who reproved clergy who did not live up to these ideals. The editor of his letters concludes that &#145;his approach as diocesan was generally vigilant, exacting and authoritarian, indeed severe to backsliders&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, xx). Secker insisted that as far as possible clergy should perform &#145;full duty&#146;&#151;that is, give both morning and evening services on Sundays&#151;and he encouraged residence in the parish. He held five visitations during his time at Oxford (1738, 1741, 1749, 1750, and 1753). The charges to his clergy that he delivered on these occasions gave advice on all manner of topics, ranging from study, ordination, relations with dissent, preaching, the importance of holy communion, and the importance of keeping up church fabric to the perils of having an unsupervised church choir. To a certain extent the charges demonstrate his reflections on issues and problems raised by the clergy in their day-to-day business. Secker paid particular attention to the ways in which confirmation was administered and began the practice of issuing confirmation tickets in order to help make these events more orderly. He was also keen to make sure that his clergy received a suitable income&#151;supporting applications to Queen Anne's Bounty and urging his clergy to defend their rights to the full monetary worth of their livings. In the summer he resided at the bishop's palace at Cuddesdon, where he preached on Sundays, read lectures on the catechism, and held a public dinner every Thursday. He spent about &pound;600 on the house and gardens, &pound;180 on the chancel, and nearly &pound;30 on the chancel of Wheatley chapel during his time as bishop. At Oxford he had frequent contact with members of the university, which, as a stronghold of high-churchmanship, regarded the whig bishop with some suspicion; he did well to avoid falling out with some of its members. One of his unofficial roles was to keep an eye on the politics of the university, which was rather ironic given that the ministry during the 1740s had some cause to doubt his loyalty. He was also brought into close contact with Sarah, duchess of Marlborough, as Blenheim Palace was within the diocese. Secker frequently visited her there and was made one of her executors. He officiated at her funeral service in 1744 and she left him money in her will.<br>
<br>Though successively bishop of Bristol and Oxford, Secker continued to hold both his prebend at Durham and the rectory of St James's <i>in commendam</i> until 1750, on the grounds that both Bristol and Oxford were rated as poor bishoprics financially. But he did not neglect his parish, spending most of the year in London, where he was a frequent preacher in the parish church, and employing a curate, Charles Linde, so that he could reside during the summer months in his dioceses. It was, for instance, while rector of St James's that Secker wrote his thirty-nine &#145;Lectures on the church catechism&#146; for the use of his parishioners (published after his death in 1769 in two volumes). It was here too that he delivered some of his most influential sermons, such as the 1750 sermon following the London earthquake, where Secker accused Londoners of being degenerate and in need of moral reformation. In his own estimation at least he was a model cleric in the parish. During the harsh winter of 1739&#150;40 he played a large part in the distribution of poor relief in the parish. He improved the parsonage house (spending over &pound;500 in repairing it), instructed children in the catechism, gave out religious tracts, paid his curate a satisfactory wage, and paid for the reading of early-morning and late-evening prayers. He also helped obtain the <span class="roman">Watch Act</span> for the parish in 1735, despite initial opposition from some of the parishioners.<br>
<br>As rector of St James's, Secker's most illustrious parishioner was Frederick, prince of Wales, particularly after the prince had left the court, following the rift with his father, George II, in 1737 and had come to live at Norfolk House, which was within the parish boundaries. Secker had impressed the king with his sermon on the death of Queen Caroline in that year and he realized that the king had hoped that he could have done more to improve relations with his son. Secker, however, felt that he had little influence over the prince. Indeed he asked Robert Walpole whether he should visit the prince whenever he resided in the parish, as he did with every other person of rank, but Walpole advised him against doing so, even though Francis Ayscough, the prince's clerk of the closet, invited him to pay his respects. The first time that the prince came to St James's Church, Thomas Bonney, the assistant preacher, began the service with the scriptural quotation &#145;I will arise and go to my Father&#146;  (<span class="roman">Luke</span> 15: 18&#150;19), which was taken in London gossip circles to be a direct hint to the prince, and it was also inaccurately rumoured that Secker himself had preached at the same service on the fifth commandment (&#145;Honour thy Father and thy Mother&#146;). According to Secker's own testimony his relations with the prince were cordial but not close. He did bow to the prince in church and he even altered the time of morning prayer from 10.30 to 11 for his convenience. In return the prince always gave an Easter offering of &pound;21 and Secker baptized seven of the prince's nine children. At the baptism of the future George III in 1738 the prince gave Secker a gold snuffbox with his portrait in it. Yet Secker felt that it was because of his failure to do much to patch up relations between father and son, and because he sometimes voted against the court, that George II did not speak to him for several years. It was widely believed that his bad relations with the king ensured that he had a &#145;protracted tenure&#146; of the relatively poor dioceses of Bristol and Oxford  (Sykes, 64). His voting against the court was, he claimed, also a reason why his friend and now fellow bishop Joseph Butler became more reserved towards him during the late 1730s and early 1740s.<h2>
<a name="Politics"></a>Politics</h2>Secker's position in the House of Lords illustrates that eighteenth-century bishops were not simply ministerial voting fodder. From his appointment to the bishopric of Bristol in 1735 until the late 1740s he regularly attended debates within the Lords, making notes (later used by William Cobbett as a source for his <span class="italic">Parliamentary History</span>), using the shorthand that he also used on other occasions, particularly when he wanted to keep information private (BL, Add. MS 6043 has Secker's reports on debates, 1735&#150;42). On several major pieces of legislation he did vote against the government. His first protest at government policy was to vote, with Edmund Gibson and other bishops, against the <span class="roman">Quaker Tithe Bill</span> of 1736, which would have relieved Quakers from some of the pains of non-payment of tithes and which was regarded as an attack on church interests. His opposition to ministerial policy seemed confirmed when, on Easter Monday 1738, he preached the Spital sermon and praised Sir John Barnard, lord mayor of London, who had voted against the ministry on a number of occasions. He next voted against the government in 1739, after the Lords debate about the Pardo convention with Spain, in which the ministry appeared to sacrifice British to Spanish interests. But something of Secker's ambivalent attitude towards outright opposition can be seen when on 13 February 1741 he and Benson voted against the proposal in the House of Lords to ask the king to remove Sir Robert Walpole &#145;from his presence and counsels for ever&#146;. Yet they also voted against the motion for censuring this proposal. On 28 January 1742 Secker voted with &#145;formed opposition&#146; in favour of a secret committee to enquire into the conduct of the war with Spain, especially into the alleged lack of reinforcements for Admiral Vernon's expedition. His criticism of the ministry was also demonstrated in 1741 and 1742, when Secker (with other bishops) voted for a <span class="roman">Pension Bill</span> that would make it compulsory for MPs to declare whether they had government pensions, and a place bill, which sought to bar MPs from having a court office. In the same year he abstained from voting on the second reading of the bill for indemnifying people who should make discoveries concerning Walpole's conduct. His next anti-government move was to vote against the <span class="roman">Spirituous Liquors Bill</span> of 1743, which would have reduced the duty payable on gin. Secker called the bill evil: &#145;the most unchristian bill that was ever brought in by any government; and therefore I think it incumbent on me as a Christian bishop to give my testimony against it in the most open and express manner I can&#146;  (Taylor, &#145;Church and state in England&#146;, 174&#150;5). To counter this oppositional stance, on other occasions Secker could be a reliable supporter of the government. In 1744 he made a powerful speech in defence of &#145;an act to make it Treason to hold correspondence with the sons of the Pretender to the Crown, and for attainting them of High Treason in case they should land or attempt to land in Great Britain&#146;. Early in 1745 his support for the government was also seen in the anti-Jacobite sermon that he preached at St James's in both February and October and that was later published. Nevertheless his pro-Hanoverian stance could be softened by his compassion for fellow clergy. In November 1743 he received a letter asking for his support for the Scottish clergy widows and children in their attempt to have a bill passed for their maintenance. His autobiography reveals some co-ordination of church policy on this issue; he remembered that &#145;No Bp opposed [it] &hellip; And we took Care that a Bp shd be present at each of its 3 readings in the House of Lords&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, fol. 32). In 1748 Scottish Episcopal clergy protested against their persecution in the wake of the repressive legislation following the rising of 1745&#150;6; Secker spoke in their defence. In 1753 he expressed reservations about Lord Hardwicke's <span class="roman">Marriage Act</span>, which he pressured Hardwicke to amend. His last major parliamentary intervention came in 1754. In the previous year he had supported the government's <span class="roman">Jewish Naturalization Bill</span>, although he did speak for a clause to disable Jews from being patrons of livings. But after the public clamour that followed the passing of the act, the duke of Newcastle was anxious to have it repealed and Secker was chosen as the bishop who would second the motion. His speech was very well received, though so moderate and judicious were his comments that some thought he was still supporting the bill. Staunch whig that he was Secker could also transcend party politics, as can be seen in his suggestion to Lord Hardwicke (probably in 1740) that it might be prudent, in forming a new ministry, to bring in some of the &#145;better&#146; tories  (ibid., 29).<h2>
<a name="DeanofStPauls"></a>Dean of St Paul's</h2>By 1750 Secker was on better terms with George II, and on 11 December he was promoted to the deanery of St Paul's. The king had been convinced that Secker had renounced his links with any oppositional tendencies: he &#145;has acted like a gentleman, and I know has declared it to the opposition themselves. He has told Lord Limerick that he would never be for a secret committee again as long as he lived&#146;  (Newcastle to Pelham, 23 Aug 1750, BL, Add. MS 32722, fol. 223). Having been made dean Secker recalled that the king did occasionally speak to him, although &#145;never with any Mark of Distinction&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, fol. 49). On account of his promotion Secker resigned both his Durham prebend and the rectory of St James's, and when he preached his farewell sermon at the latter the congregation is said to have dissolved into tears. As dean he was extremely hard-working and went to St Paul's twice a day. Characteristically one of his first major tasks was to sort out the records and finances of the cathedral. During 1753&#150;4 he examined the accounts of the surplus that had been left unspent after the cathedral had been rebuilt in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries and that was meant to have been reserved for repairs; he was concerned that the principal was being diminished and he made sure that it would be safeguarded in future. He had the documents about the cathedral put in order and personally indexed and corrected a copy of the statute book, and examined the registers and chapter books, extracting from them useful material for his successors. He was also instrumental in the repair programme, which put the cathedral in a better condition.<br>
<br>During the 1750s Secker was involved in some of the intellectual debates of the time, and a number of writers on behalf of the church sought his opinion of their work. His grounding in early Christian history was put to use in 1749&#150;50 in helping Thomas Church in his controversy with Conyers Middleton over the existence of miracles after the time of the apostles, and in 1755 he commented on Church's <span class="italic">Analysis of the Philosophical Works of the Late Viscount Bolingbroke</span>. Secker was also a promoter of the work of Benjamin Kennicott (whom he made vicar of Culham, in the diocese of Oxford, in 1753), encouraging him in efforts to collect and collate Hebrew manuscripts and defending his scholarly methods against the critiques of the Hutchinsonians. He also read through Thomas Sharp's drafts in his disputes with the Hutchinsonians, and from 1749 he had encouraged the bluestocking Elizabeth Carter, daughter of the rector of Deal and an intimate of Catherine Talbot, in her edition of <span class="italic">Epictetus</span>, which was finally published in 1757.<h2>
<a name="ArchbishopofCanterbury"></a>Archbishop of Canterbury</h2>On 19 March 1758 Archbishop Matthew Hutton died and the duke of Newcastle proposed that Secker should succeed him. George II apparently asked whether Secker had been connected with the Leicester House opposition and the duke assured the king that he had not. The king consented to the appointment on 22 March and Secker was confirmed archbishop at Bow church on 21 April. Later that summer the University of Oxford presented an address to George II and, given the king's former suspicion of the university, Secker intervened to make sure that he received it kindly. Secker's warmer relations with the monarchy were cemented in 1760, when George III (whom he had baptized) succeeded his grandfather. Horace Walpole sniped that at the young king's accession Secker attempted to make himself &#145;first minister in a court that hoisted the standard of religion&#146;  (Walpole, 1.16) and tried to elbow out leading aristocratic families. There is little evidence of this, although Secker did hope that the new court would set a standard for religious practice. As archbishop he presided over George's coronation in 1761, revising the coronation service, and officiated at the marriage ceremony between George and Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz earlier in the same year.<br>
<br>Secker's archiepiscopate has claims to be one of the most, if not the most, distinguished in the eighteenth century. As archbishop he continued to be as hard-working as he had been in his former posts in the church, and he aimed to have a detailed grasp not only of diocesan business but also of the wider role that his post demanded. If there is a central feature about his occupation of the see it was perhaps his near obsession with paperwork in trying to keep up with developments on all fronts. The headquarters of his administrative machine was Lambeth Palace, which, being near the court and parliament&#151;and in the absence of convocation&#151;was the hub of national church life. Secker used Lambeth as a meeting place for bishops and also for interviewing and entertaining Kentish gentry and clergymen in his diocese. This could be costly and household expenses took over half his income, accounting for &pound;4692 6<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>. in 1767. Testimony to the importance of Lambeth in Secker's archiepiscopate is the large archive that he amassed at Lambeth Palace Library. With his encouragement there was a thorough re-ordering of the archival and printed collections of his predecessors, and their act books, by the Lambeth librarian, Andrew Colt&eacute;e Ducarel.<br>
<br>As archbishop Secker made some attempt to create a national policy. He worked particularly closely with his fellow archbishop Robert Hay Drummond of York to co-ordinate responses to problems facing the church, and they acted together over the administration of Queen Anne's Bounty. His concerns for the well-being of the national church were, however, tempered by the existence of what he considered to be a laity suspicious of clerical power. In 1761 he warned against the opening of convocation to do any real business, since &#145;in whatever way we act, we will excite great offence&#146;  (Taylor, &#145;Bishop Edmund Gibson's proposals&#146;, 185). During the last decade of his life Secker had to prioritize his engagements and cut down on his public appearances. He was no longer so involved in parliament as previously. This was partly because since 1754 he had been a supporter of the duke of Newcastle; in his new role he was consulted by successive ministries on promotions and he did not want to suggest that his previous connections indicated disloyalty to governments that did not include Newcastle or his circle. Furthermore by the time of his appointment to the archbishopric he found the long days and the heat of the upper chamber too much. One of his last parliamentary interventions was to speak, on 8 May 1765, opposing repeal of the <span class="roman">Marriage Act</span> and the passing of a new <span class="roman">Marriage Bill</span>; in 1767 he ceased attending the Lords altogether. He had been one of the most popular preachers of the day, and from the mid-1730s he could be found speaking on all manner of occasions and at all kinds of fund-raising meetings for the church. He himself noted that he had preached &#145;about&#146; fifty-six charity sermons alone in and around London. He decided therefore, in 1760, not to accept any more requests to preach at similar events.<br>
<br>A hallmark of Secker's archiepiscopate was his attempt to strengthen links with foreign protestants. His own concern for the plight of persecuted protestants living in continental Europe reflected his belief that England, as the leading protestant nation, should look after its protestant brethren abroad. Even before he had become archbishop Secker was known to sympathize with their cause. In 1757 the congregation of the protestant church at Thorn, in Prussia, many members of which had been massacred by neighbouring Catholics, successfully petitioned Secker for help to publicize their cause in England in their attempt to rebuild their church. As archbishop Secker secured relief for the Vaudois community in 1767&#150;8 and launched a national brief for their support. He seems to have particularly favoured financial aid to Hungarian protestants, giving &pound;10 p.a. to the professors of Debreczen and to Johannes Uri, a Hungarian specialist in oriental languages. A related issue was the position of foreign protestants who now lived in England. At least as early as 1752 Secker had contributed to the maintenance of Huguenots living in London; as archbishop he was also keen to establish links with French Huguenot congregations and corresponded with John James Majendie, especially over financial aid. He also used his position to try to persuade Huguenots to conform to the Church of England, and he promoted several of those who took orders to Canterbury livings.<br>
<br>One issue that did become important during Secker's archiepiscopate was the question of a bishop for the American colonies. As early as 1741 he had stressed in a sermon to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts that it was essential to have a resident bishop in North America, and in 1749 he was involved with drafting a petition for a bishopric in Nova Scotia. In 1751 he wrote a letter to Horace Walpole (which he did not want published until after his death), which replied to an earlier letter of Walpole's to Bishop Thomas Sherlock attacking such a scheme as being against the colonists' wishes. Secker put forward the view&#151;much influenced by his correspondence with Samuel Johnson, president of King's College, New York&#151;that the colonists wanted bishops of their own and that a bishop (or bishops) would be essential to the maintenance of the church in North America. Not surprisingly the issue of the plans for an American bishopric was used by some of Secker's opponents in the 1760s. Thomas Hollis had formerly been an admirer of Secker, even presenting him with a head of Socrates made from green jasper at the time of his promotion to the bishopric of Oxford, but seems to have fallen out with Secker after the 1741 sermon. Hollis co-ordinated opposition on both sides of the Atlantic to what were considered to be Anglican encroachments and he encouraged the Boston congregationalist Jonathan Mayhew to write a polemic against the designs of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts in 1763. In response Secker tried to put the case, as firmly and as judiciously as possible, for the creation of a bishopric in his <span class="italic">An answer to Dr Mayhew's observations on the charter and conduct of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts</span> (1764).<br>
<br>Secker's views on the need for an American bishopric aroused criticism from within the ranks of his own clergy. In 1766 Francis Blackburne, archdeacon of Cleveland and a vigorous low-churchman, published <span class="italic">The Confessional</span>; it appeared anonymously and was part of a wider attack on the requirement that Church of England clergy should subscribe to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>. Blackburne argued for a further reformation of what he considered to be popish elements within the church; not only did he accuse Secker's predecessor, Archbishop William Wake, of foregoing protestant principles in his talks with the Gallican church but he criticized Secker's aims to create an episcopate in the colonies as being evidence of the popery that remained within the church, going so far as to compare Secker to Archbishop Laud. Secker found out who was behind the publication and encouraged Gloster Ridley to write against it in <span class="italic">Three Letters to the Author of the Confessional</span> (1768), providing much of the text for it himself and defending Ridley in the press. The archbishop tried to clear his predecessor of the charges that Blackburne had made against him, carefully going through Wake's papers in Oxford and elsewhere to prove him innocent. As part of his attempt to clear the Church of England's hierarchy from the imputation of popery, a year earlier Secker had written an article to the press under the pseudonym Misopsuedes, refuting the charge that Bishop Butler had been a closet papist.<br>
<br>At the diocesan level Secker was an energetic archbishop. True to form his first major task was to set out on his primary visitation from 10 to 27 July 1758. He followed this up with visitations in 1762 and 1766 but he needed to be convinced that archbishops of Canterbury were only required to visit their diocese once every four years rather than triennially. The charges delivered on these occasions continued his policy at Oxford of advising his clergy on pressing pastoral difficulties. The returns to his queries from the first visitation, with information added from the later visitations, were digested by him in his speculum. He was the first archbishop since the early part of the century to undertake a thorough visitation of the peculiars and, as at Bristol and at Oxford, he took especial care to regulate the organization of confirmations and encouraged the taking of communion. He was keen to be candid and was generous and benevolent when he felt that his clergy were trying their best but he could be quite sharp with clergy whom he considered were not fulfilling their pastoral duties. Some clergy seem to have resented the new archbishop's obsession with detail and his attempt to tighten up pastoral care in the diocese, seeing this as undue interference.<br>
<br>Secker paid particular interest in those ordained to a Canterbury title and refused to ordain those whom he thought lacked satisfactory theological knowledge; it was said that he had a black book containing the names of those whom he would not ordain or promote. He took a particular interest in those who acted as curates in the diocese. During his time as archbishop very few clergy were dismissed for misconduct, though he frowned on beneficed clergy who fell below his ideal of clerical behaviour. Only Samuel Bickley, vicar of Bapchild, was deprived by Secker; this was in 1764, on a charge of attempting to commit sodomy (though characteristically the archbishop gave Bickley some money in recompense).<br>
<br>One of the most time-consuming aspects of diocesan administration was the management of the archiepiscopal estates. A particular concern for Secker was the estate that had belonged to St Gregory's Priory, with the earls of Chesterfield as tenants. He tried (unsuccessfully) to get the tenants to pay pensions to the curates, and this may explain the fourth earl's much quoted assertion that Secker &#145;signs his own name, when he writes &#147;Thomas Cant.&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 53/2.1032n.). In the end Secker paid the pensions himself. He took care to monitor, and if needs be to take a firm line with, estate officials who might bring the name of the church into disrepute. Likewise he took care over the woodland owned by the archbishopric and lands owned by the three hospitals for the poor in the diocese. The wealth of clergy was an especial concern of his and he urged incumbents to preserve, and if necessary regain, their financial rights of the church but at the same time not to appear contentious. During his archiepiscopate Sir Philip Boteler was encouraged by Secker to augment thirty-eight parishes in the diocese through Queen Anne's Bounty.<br>
<br>During Secker's archiepiscopate Methodism made a slow but significant impact on the diocese. As one reared among dissenters Secker realized that the Anglican clergy might learn much from the Methodists. He was aware that Methodism might divide the church but thought that the best way to curb its growth was for the clergy to emulate its best features. In his charge of 1762 he told the clergy of his diocese that &#145;a chief reason why we have so little hold on our people is that we do not converse with them&#146;. He pointed out that continental protestants, Catholics, and &#145;both the Old Dissenters from our Church and those who are forming new separations, gain and preserve a surprising influence amongst their followers by personal religious intercourse&#146;  (<span class="italic">Eight Charges</span>, 269). He recognized that there was some truth in the Methodists' criticisms; in his attempts to improve the pastoral performance of the clergy it could be argued that he had ends in view similar to those of the early Methodist leaders. In a proposed article of 1759 he exhorted his clergy to &#145;preach diligently the doctrines of justification by faith in Christ; warning against the abuses of that doctrine and of separating themselves from the Church to follow unauthorised teachers&#146;  (LPL, MS Secker 7, fol. 99<i>v</i>). Secker was aware of the tendency for rationalistic sermons yet he wondered whether the Methodists did not exaggerate the wrongs of the Anglican clergy. He realized that one reason why they did well was because leaders like Wesley could portray Methodism as a movement from within the church. He understood the aversion of many Methodists to separatism and told the vicar of St John's, Thanet, in 1765 that if the Methodists in his parish had a place where they met they ought to be licensed as dissenters:<blockquote>yet possibly some of them may be unwilling to call themselves Dissenters, and to be esteemed such by other persons. And in that case, it may be worthwhile to try what effect the fear of law will have upon them. (Secker to Harrison, 11 Oct 1765, LPL, MS Secker 3, fol. 242)</blockquote>Secker suffered from ill health for much of his life, which makes his commitment to hard work even more impressive. Montagu Pennington, nephew of Secker's prot&eacute;g&eacute; Elizabeth Carter, later observed that &#145;Dr Secker's manners were not usually considered as prepossessing (one satisfactory apology for which may be found in his constant bad health)&#146;  (Pennington, 1.161). Secker recorded his various bouts of illness in his autobiography. The entry for 1724 (the first time that he noted his state of health) recalled that he had &#145;for some Years had a very troublesome Cough in the Winter: &amp; felt a Weakness and Pain in my Breast, on speaking much or loud&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, fol. 14). In July of that year he went to the Hot Well in Bristol and stayed there until September. The only remedy that seemed to have any effect was to discharge blood from an opening in his arm, which he left open until the end of his life. From the early 1740s he also suffered from the stone and tried various remedies, including Mrs Stephen's medicine, first in liquid and then in solid form. From 1761 to 1764 he suffered from &#145;dangerous fits of the stone&#146; but these seem to have been cured by soap pills. An increasingly frequent and serious illness was gout (probably related to the hearty quantities of wine that he bought), from which he first suffered in 1742. This was always exacerbated when he was tired or under pressure, and he had an attack every two years or so. In the 1760s the condition became particularly severe. In 1762 he was so afflicted with it that he could not visit the diocese in person and delegated the responsibility to John Green, bishop of Lincoln. From 1764 onwards, he had especially long periods of gout, and in that year had a fainting fit when resident in Canterbury for the deprivation of Samuel Bickley.<h2>
<a name="Lastillnessandwill"></a>Last illness and will</h2>The last year of Secker's life was acutely painful. He was suffering from a cancerous thigh bone and arthritis but continued to discharge much business as well as furthering schemes for the relief of foreign protestants and writing against those who criticized his archiepiscopate. On Easter Tuesday 1768 all the bishops, as usual, dined at Lambeth and Secker encouraged them to make lists of those clergy in their dioceses who were resident and non-resident, which illustrates how he wanted to improve the pastoral provision of the church as a whole. He died at Lambeth Palace, of a caries of the femur, on 3 August. He was buried in a covered passage leading from the palace to the north door of Lambeth church, and in his will he requested that his remains should have neither a monument nor an epitaph erected over them.<br>
<br>Secker's will&#151;which named Catherine Talbot and Daniel Burton, an Oxford associate, as executors&#151;was characteristically well thought out, and his bequests rewarded people and causes with whom he had long been connected. Mrs Talbot and Catherine, with whom he had lived since 1725 and who had effectively kept house for him since his wife's death, were given &pound;13,000 in consols, to be managed by his chaplains and to be distributed to charities when they died. He left &pound;1000 to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts for general purposes and another &pound;1000 to help establish a bishopric in North America. The Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge was left &pound;500. Secker had earlier given handsome donations to both these bodies. He also left &pound;500 to the corporation of the sons of the clergy (and &pound;200 to the corporation's society of stewards) and &pound;500 to the Irish protestant working schools. His early medical training was reflected in the &pound;500 each that he left to the hospitals of Croydon; St John, Canterbury; St Nicholas, Harbeldown; to St George's, London, to the Lying-in Hospital, and to the incurables of St Luke's Hospital. It was reflected too in the &pound;400 that he left to the asylum at Lambeth, and in the &pound;300 each that went to the Magdalen, the Lock, the Smallpox, and the Inoculation hospitals. He donated &pound;2000 to help rebuild and repair houses belonging to the poorer parishes in the diocese of Canterbury and &pound;500 to Bromley College, Kent. &pound;1000 was to be given out to his servants and &pound;200 to people who had helped him. He left all his personal books and papers, as well as his manuscripts, to Lambeth Palace Library. His literary executors were his chaplains Beilby Porteus and George Stinton.<br>
<br>Secker had earlier made substantial gifts to his relatives and particularly to his nephews John Frost (who died in 1765) and George Secker, both of whom received preferment in addition to substantial financial assistance. He was also generous to the children of friends, including George Berkeley, son of the philosopher bishop. If anything Secker's family connections and ties of friendship appear to have grown stronger with age. Perhaps one reason why he clung to his extended family is that his close friends and fellow bishops Benson, Berkeley, and Butler, as well as his wife, Kitty, who died in 1748, departed this life within five years of each other. Secker's account book shows that apart from these gifts he dispersed a considerable amount of his income in charity to the poor and needy.<br>
<br>Secker was a tall man with an imposing presence. Several contemporary portraits of him convey something of his commanding personality, most notably that by Sir Joshua Reynolds, which was completed in 1764 and which was placed in the gallery at Lambeth, a copy of which can be found at St Edmund Hall, Oxford. In addition to his autobiography Secker left a voluminous correspondence, as well as the specula and account books already mentioned. Besides the charges he published a large number of sermons, which, together with his &#145;Lectures on the catechism&#146;, the &#145;Oratio, quam coram synodo provinciae Cantuariensis anno 1761 convocata habendam scripserat, sed morbo praepeditus non habuit, archiepiscopus&#146;, and his &#145;Instructions given to candidates for orders&#146;, were collected and printed after his death. He did not publish any major piece of scholarship, although manuscripts at Lambeth Palace Library show detailed work on the book of <span class="roman">Daniel</span>, which demonstrates his potential as an <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> scholar.<br>
<br>Secker's life illustrates some of the salient features of the Church of England during the eighteenth century. The very fact than an erstwhile dissenter from a relatively unpromising social background rose to the highest position within the church's hierarchy indicates the generally open nature of the church in this period. His time as a Church of England cleric and as a member of the church's hierarchy challenges some of the adverse judgements surrounding the church at this time. As a pastor, preacher, and administrator he was exemplary, and for these qualities he was revered by both contemporaries and successors. His charges, widely read both in his lifetime and later, went some way to make up for the lack of pastoral training in the period before the 1830s; they covered a wide range of topics, from how to deliver a sermon to the ways in which clergy should deal with refractory parishioners. They articulated the central tension in the clergy's role as Secker envisaged it: the need to win the support of society without sacrificing clerical ideals. He nevertheless received some criticism for what were perceived to be his strong views and authoritarian nature. Yet despite the accusations of popery and high-handedness already quoted others saw him as an example of moderation in the mould of Archbishop Tillotson. Secker himself highly regarded his predecessor Thomas Tenison. Secker's churchmanship is not easily characterized, and in any case reflects an eighteenth-century meshing of what are sometimes called high-church and low-church views. Though he came to be seen as a high-churchman and a defender of orthodoxy his dissenting background and his former religious liberalism endeared him to a wider range of views and people. Something of the range of his qualities, which could be used to support both high-church and evangelical positions, was listed by George Huntingford, bishop of Hereford, in 1828: &#145;I have always admired Arch-bishop Secker for his learning, his piety, his vigilance, his firmness, his mildness, his moderation, his discretion&#146;  (Huntingford to Howley, 1 Aug 1828, LPL, Howley papers). Secker certainly seems to have been able to retain contact with people whose views he did not share, such as Philip Doddridge, Isaac Watts, John Leland, Nathaniel Lardner, and Samuel Chandler. If in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries he was well thought of both by high-churchmen and by evangelicals, in the late twentieth century he was increasingly admired for his aptitude for administration, sheer hard work, and managerial abilities.<br>
