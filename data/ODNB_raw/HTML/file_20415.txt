<span class="headword">Nye,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1620, <em>d.</em> 1686?), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious writer</span>, was baptized on 26 March 1620 at Cobham, Surrey, where his father, Henry Nye (<i>bap</i>. 1588, <i>d</i>. 1643) was vicar; his mother's name was probably Lettice. Within a few months of John's birth Henry Nye moved to Clapham, Sussex, where he continued as rector until his death in August or September 1643. John matriculated from Magdalen Hall, Oxford, on 12 December 1634, aged fourteen, and graduated BA on 26 May 1638. He was back in Clapham when late in 1641 or early in 1642 he signed the protestation issued by the House of Commons. On 4 January 1647 he was &#145;approved on his former examination&#146;  (Mitchell and Struthers, 318) by the Westminster assembly, of which his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20417/', "Philip Nye (d. 1672)")</script> was a prominent member, presumably preparatory to serving the latter in his ministry at Acton, Middlesex, a position he was certainly holding by 1650. By the summer of 1647 he married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1654), the second daughter of another leading figure in the assembly, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18148/', "Stephen Marshall (1594/5?&#150;1655)")</script>; their son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20418/', "Stephen Nye")</script> was born in 1647 or early in 1648 and a second son, John, in 1650 or early 1651.<br>
<br>By mid-1654 Nye was minister of Cottenham, Cambridgeshire; his wife was buried there on 2 August. That year he was appointed assistant to the county's commission of triers and ejectors and he became an active member of the voluntary association of ministers in the county. On 25 June 1656 at nearby Willingham he married Elizabeth, sister of the rector of the parish, Nathaniel Bradshaw (<i>d</i>. 1690), who was a fellow member of the commission.<br>
<br>At the Restoration the sequestered rector of Cottenham, John Manby, was reinstated. Nye was ordained priest at Chichester on 25 June 1661 and the same day presented to the vicarage of Great Chishill, Cambridgeshire. Unlike his uncle, who was an Independent, and his brother-in-law Bradshaw, who was ejected, Nye subscribed to the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> in 1662, signing on 22 July as a chaplain of the Savoy, London. On 27 August he became rector of Quendon, acquiring an additional Essex living at Rickling in 1674; his son John, who was ordained deacon in London in May 1670 and priest at Peterborough in May 1676, served as his curate. It was from Quendon that on 25 October 1675 he signed the preface to <span class="italic">A Display of Divine Heraldry Vindicating the Foundation of the Christian Religion</span> (1678). Although he assured the &#145;Christian Reader&#146; that Jesus's miracles &#145;infallibly prove him to be the Christ of God, though we could not shew by what Ancestors he descended from Abraham and David&#146;  (sig. A2), the work was a discussion of the differing genealogies of Jesus given in the gospels of <span class="roman">Matthew</span> and <span class="roman">Luke</span> which concluded that they &#145;are as a Golden key to open the truth of the Story, without which it is impossible to read the Scriptures with true understanding&#146;  (pp. 51&#150;2). In contrast to his son Stephen later, he rejected the Socinian viewpoint and asserted both the divine and the human nature of Christ. Nye made his will on 8 November 1681, and probably died in 1686; the will was proved on 25 August that year. He was survived by his second wife, whom he made executor, by his son Stephen, and by three daughters, Elizabeth, Joanna, and Catherine; he left landed property in Cambridgeshire and Essex.<br>
<br>Nye has sometimes been confused with his first cousin <a name="cosubject_75543"></a><span class="headword">John Nye</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1630, <em>d.</em> 1672)<span class="occ"></span>, second surviving of five sons of Philip Nye and his wife, Judith Kiddington (<i>d</i>. 1680?). This John Nye was baptized on 30 November 1630 at St Dionis Backchurch, London, where his father was then lecturer. On 3 July 1650 he was admitted a pensioner at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, but he subsequently migrated to Oxford, where he matriculated from Magdalen College on 23 February 1654 and graduated BA the same day. By June that year he was acting as a clerk to the commission of triers and ejectors, of which his father was a prominent member. When one of the clergymen examined by the commission, Anthony Sadler, aired objections to his treatment in a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Inquisitio Anglicana</span>, it was almost certainly Nye who published anonymously a systematic defence of the commissioners' proceedings, <span class="italic">Mr Sadler Re-Examined, or, His Disguise Discovered</span> (1654). &#145;The Approvers&#146;, he asserted, &#145;do the utmost in them lies to keep mens souls from being starved by the remainder of this Episcopall generation&#146;  (p. 13). He claimed to be &#145;now in no relation to them&#146;  (p. 1) and indeed on 10 February 1655 Nye was admitted to the Middle Temple, but he seems to have continued as clerk until the Restoration: in 1662 he was ordered to hand over the triers' papers to the archbishop of Canterbury. On 14 April 1664 he married at Stoke Newington, Middlesex, Anne Chumley or Cholmley, with whom he had two sons, John and Cholmley. He died in 1672, and was buried on 14 October at St Michael Cornhill, London, just seventeen days after his father had been interred there.<br>
