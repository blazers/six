<span class="headword">Disney,  William</span>  (1731&#150;1807), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 29 September 1731, probably at Cranbrook in Kent; he was the second son of the Revd Joseph Disney MA (1695&#150;1777), vicar of Cranbrook and Appledore, and his wife, Ann Ross (<i>d</i>. 1782), of Biddenden. He was descended from Lincolnshire stock, through whom he is almost certainly related to the twentieth-century American animator Walt Disney.<br>
<br>William Disney was educated in London at Merchant Taylors' School under Dr Creech, and from there went on to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was admitted pensioner on 26 January 1749. He matriculated and was admitted as a scholar on the Newman foundation in that year; he obtained his BA in 1753 and his MA in 1756. In 1754 he had been named a fellow of his college, and on 22 December had been ordained deacon in the Church of England by Matthias Mawson, bishop of Ely. He was ordained priest by Mawson on 19 February 1758. From 1757 to 1771 he held the post of regius professor of Hebrew in the University of Cambridge.<br>
<br>Disney gained his BD in 1768 and in 1777 became rector of Pluckley in Kent, where he was to spend the rest of his life. He married Anna Maria Smyth (<i>bap</i>. 1736, <i>d</i>. 1820), youngest daughter of John and Elizabeth Smyth of Chart Sutton, Kent, but there appear to have been no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>Disney was made DD of Cambridge University in 1789 and on the occasion preached a sermon that was printed in Cambridge in the same year under the title <span class="italic">A sermon preached before the University of Cambridge &hellip; with some strictures on the licentious notions avowed or insinuated in the three last volumes of Mr Gibbon's Roman history</span>. Disney shared the discomfort felt by many readers concerning Gibbon's account of the early Christian church and its effect on the Roman empire, which was widely interpreted as irreligious.<br>
<br>Having left the academic world Disney devoted the last thirty years of his life to the duties of a clergyman. His brief correspondence with Edward Hasted, historian of Kent, shows him to have been the caring incumbent of a well-run parish, and Hasted, who outlived his near-contemporary, noted Disney's death in his commonplace book with the words &#145;rich in good works&#146;  (Canterbury Cathedral Archives, U11/5). Disney's obituary in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> was therefore stating no more than the truth in saying &#145;his death will be sincerely regretted by all who had the happiness of being numbered among his friends, but more particularly by the neighbouring poor, who in him have lost a kindly friend, and a most liberal benefactor&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 77, 385). Mourned by his wife as a &#145;truly good man&#146;  (ibid.), William Disney died at Pluckley on 28 March 1807 and was buried in the family vault at Cranbrook on 4 April.<br>
