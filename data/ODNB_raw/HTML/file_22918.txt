<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pye,  Henry James</span>  (1745&#150;1813), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 20 February 1745 in London and baptized on 24 February at St Anne's, Soho, the eldest of four children of Henry Pye (1709&#150;1766), MP for Berkshire from 1746 to 1766, and Mary (1717/18&#150;1806), daughter of the Revd David James. His father's ancestors included Sir Robert Pye (1585&#150;1662) and John Hampden (1594&#150;1643). Henry James Pye was educated at Magdalen College, Oxford, from 1762 to 1766 (honorary MA 1766, DCL 1772). In 1766 he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1796), daughter of Colonel William Hook(e) (<i>d</i>. 1761). There were two daughters from this marriage: Mary Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1834), later the wife of Captain Jones, 35th regiment, and Matilda Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1851), later the wife of Samuel James Arnold (1774&#150;1852), playwright and portrait painter.<br>
<br>When his father died in 1766 Pye inherited large debts; he was obliged to sell ancestral estates at Knotting, Bedfordshire, and at Great Faringdon, Berkshire. He was a keen field sportsman, and a Berkshire magistrate and militia officer. Nathaniel Hone painted him (1775) in militia uniform, holding helmet and musket with fixed bayonet. Pye's election as MP for Berkshire in 1784 was assisted by the unusually large disbursement of &pound;2500 from the government's secret service fund, and consequently he always supported Pitt in the Commons, but he retired from parliament at the dissolution in 1790. His residences after Faringdon were in Queen Square, Westminster, and Pinner, Middlesex, but he maintained an interest in field sports: his &#145;improved and enlarged&#146; edition of <span class="italic">The Sportsman's Dictionary</span> appeared in 1807. From 1792 he was a police magistrate for Westminster; he wrote a useful <span class="italic">Summary of the Duties of a Justice of the Peace</span> (1808; 4th edn, 1827).<br>
<br>Pye said he was &#145;a rhymer for life&#146;. His earliest publication was an ode in an Oxford congratulatory volume on the birth of the prince of Wales (1762); it was followed by a stream of descriptive and didactic poems in heroic couplets: <span class="italic">Beauty, a Poetical Essay</span> (1766), <span class="italic">The Triumph of Fashion, a Vision</span> (1771), <span class="italic">The Art of War</span> (1778, translated from the French of Frederick the Great when Pye was at militia camp), <span class="italic">The Progress of Refinement: a Poem in Three Parts</span> (1783), <span class="italic">Faringdon Hill: a Poem in Two Books</span> (1774, a &#145;local poem&#146;), <span class="italic">Shooting</span> (1784, a georgic), and <span class="italic">Amusement: a Poetical Essay</span> (1790). These poems conventionally praise the pleasures of gentlemanly rural life, but Pye extended the range of didactic verse with his <span class="italic">Aerophorion</span> (1784) on hot-air ballooning. There were lyrics too: most of Pye's <span class="italic">Elegies on Different Occasions</span> (1768) are love-sick effusions addressed to &#145;Delia&#146; but one refreshingly hails the opening of the partridge-shooting season. Some of the above, with songs, odes, pseudo-Spenserian stanzas, translations, and other new pieces, reappeared in <span class="italic">Poems on Various Subjects</span> (2 vols., 1787).<br>
<br>On Pye's retirement from the Commons, his support of Pitt was rewarded on 28 July 1790 with the award of the poet laureateship, vacant on the death of Thomas Warton. As well as his annual salary of &pound;100, a laureate received a pension of &pound;27 in lieu of the tierce (42 gallons) of canary wine which had once been part of the stipend; this exchange was made well before Pye's time, though Pye has often mistakenly been blamed for it. The laureateship was an office of little profit (Pye badgered Pitt unsuccessfully for other posts) and in Pye's hands it became one of little credit too. Of the odes that he conscientiously wrote, year by year, for the new year and for the king's birthday (4 June), the best that can be said is that their rhymes and regular stanzas made them easier to set to music by the master of the king's band, Sir William Parsons, than the irregular odes of Pye's successor Robert Southey.<br>
<br>Pye's term of office coincided with a long war against France, so his odes dwell on &#145;Gallic perfidy&#146;, &#145;Peace by Victory led&#146;, the &#145;golden beams of Freedom&#146;, the benefits of commerce, and Britannia's rule of the waves. The same unreflective patriotism fills Pye's longer wartime poems, such as <span class="italic">Naucratica, or, Naval Dominion</span> (1798), dedicated to George III, <span class="italic">Carmen seculare for the Year 1800</span> (with a preface arguing that the new century really begins on 1 January 1801), and the ambitious <span class="italic">Alfred, an Epic Poem in Six Books</span> (1801). In quieter vein Pye celebrated his friendship with the writer John Penn (1760&#150;1834) in <span class="italic">Verses on Several Subjects, Written in the Vicinity of Stoke Park</span> (1802).<br>
<br>Laureate odes were sometimes sung as entr'actes in London theatres, but Pye, like his sister-in-law Henrietta Pye (author of a farce <span class="italic">The Capricious Lady</span>, 1771), had a more sustained flirtation with the stage. His solemn blank-verse historical tragedies on medieval subjects, <span class="italic">The Siege of Meaux</span> (1794) and <span class="italic">Adelaide</span> (1800), were printed and were given enough performances (three nights) to secure an author's benefit for each. Pye was also joint author of <span class="italic">The Inquisitor, a Tragedy</span> (from the German, 1798) and <span class="italic">A Prior Claim, a Comedy</span> (1805). A prologue he was persuaded to write for the 1796 production of <span class="italic">Vortigern</span>, a Shakespeare forgery by William Henry Ireland, was so dubious in tone that, happily for Pye, it was not used. Pye also tried his hand at prose fiction: his epistolary novel <span class="italic">The Spectre</span> (1789) is conventionally sentimental and sensational; his two later anti-Jacobin novels, <span class="italic">The Democrat</span> (1795) and <span class="italic">The Aristocrat</span> (1799) mildly satirize sentimentality. His <span class="italic">Sketches on Various Subjects: Moral, Literary, and Political</span> (1796) collected miscellaneous thoughts on novels, the army, gardening, Shakespeare, field sports, and many other topics. He enlarged his Shakespeare &#145;sketch&#146; into a nit-picking volume, <span class="italic">Comments on the Commentators on Shakespeare</span> (1807), attacking the editorial labours of George Steevens, Edmond Malone, Francis Douce, and others. Douce hit back in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (October 1807, 921&#150;7) and in the heavily annotated copy of <span class="italic">Comments</span> now in the Bodleian Library, in which Douce has altered the author's name to &#145;Goose-Pye&#146;.<br>
<br>In addition to all the above Pye translated verse from French, Italian, German, Latin, and Greek. His translation in 1775 of six Olympic odes of Pindar and his revision in 1812 of Philip Francis's version of Horace's <span class="italic">Odes</span> found a place in standard English reprints of those authors, but his translations of the <span class="italic">War Elegies</span> of Tyrtaeus (1795), and the hymns and epigrams of Homer (1810), were less durable. His version, in 1796, of B&uuml;rger's <span class="italic">Lenore</span> was eclipsed by those of William Taylor and Sir Walter Scott. His most interesting piece of intertextual scholarship is a bulky <span class="italic">Commentary</span> (1792) on a translation of Aristotle's <span class="italic">Poetics</span> he had published four years earlier: his illustration of Aristotle by examples from modern literature is often original, shrewd, and learned.<br>
<br>Pye's original verse is never distinctive enough to be really bad: his odes, elegies, and seemingly interminable heroic couplets are mechanically competent, but he rarely has anything interesting to say. His novels, plays, miscellaneous prose, and even his somewhat more highly regarded translations soon sank, like his poems, without trace. However, his conspicuous public position as poet laureate exposed his meagre talents to the gaze of satirists, especially those such as John Wolcot (Peter Pindar) and Lord Byron who wanted to attack George III through his laureate.<br>
<br>Pye wisely did not reply to the wits who attacked him, but he greatly curtailed his writing, so that after 1802 he published no original new verse other than twice-yearly laureate odes. In November 1801 he married his second wife, Martha Corbett (1769/70&#150;1861); their children were Henry John (1802&#150;1884) and Jane Ann, who married Francis Willington of Tamworth. In May 1813 an edition of Pye's <span class="italic">Select Writings</span> in six volumes was announced in the press, but it never appeared. Pye died at Pinner on 11 August 1813.<br>
<br>Pye's portrait, painted about 1800 by his son-in-law S. J. Arnold, shows a bullet-head, firm mouth, large nose, hazel eyes, ruddy complexion, and sparse white hair: more sportsman than poet. Henry Crabb Robinson wrote in his diary (13 October 1812) that Pye had &#145;a singular diseased affection: the sight of any extended plain, either the sea, or a heath, throws him into a nervous disorder amounting to convulsion&#146;. William Thomas Fitzgerald (like Pye a butt of Byron's) was<blockquote>once with him when they were crossing Blackfriars Bridge by moonlight. Pye caught a glimpse of the water with the reflection of the moon upon it, and sank down into the carriage pretending to look for his glove in order to conceal the trouble the sight gave him. (<span class="italic">Henry Crabb Robinson</span>, 110&#150;11)</blockquote>
