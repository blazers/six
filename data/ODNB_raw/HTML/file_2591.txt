<span class="headword">Blakeney,  William</span>, Baron Blakeney  (1671/2&#150;1761), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, the eldest son in the family of five sons and four daughters of William Blakeney (<i>d</i>. 1717/18) and his wife, Elizabeth Bowerman, was born at Mount Blakeney, co. Limerick, Ireland, on 7 September 1671 or 1672. His father was a fairly wealthy country gentleman who represented the borough of Kilmallock in the Irish House of Commons for many years, and he expected his eldest son to lead the same life as himself. During the Rapparee insurrection of 1690 the family retreated to Castle Blakeney, but the young William Blakeney was left to defend the estates with a small military force organized out of his father's tenants&#151;which he did successfully.<br>
<br>Blakeney's early military career is uncertain. He was commissioned as an ensign in 1695 and became a lieutenant on 1 August 1701. His anonymous biographer says he received an ensigncy in Lord Cutt's regiment of foot guards (Coldstream) in 1702 at the siege of Venloo, but there is no evidence of this in the regiment's archives. He continued to serve in Flanders, becoming a lieutenant in the 1st foot guards on 9 March 1708 and lieutenant-colonel in 1712. After the treaty of Utrecht came a long period of peace, during which promotion was slow; Blakeney was made lieutenant-colonel of Lord John Kerr's regiment of foot on 3 April 1718, but received no further promotion until 1737.<br>
<br>On 27 January 1737, possibly through the influence of the duke of Richmond, Blakeney became colonel of a regiment of foot on the Irish establishment. In 1739 the regiment was ordered to England in response to the growing crisis with Spain. War was declared on Spain on 19 October, and early in 1740 a large expedition was prepared to attack the Spanish colonies in the West Indies. Blakeney's regiment was selected to go on this service, and Blakeney himself was appointed adjutant-general to the expedition, which was commanded by Charles, Lord Cathcart. Blakeney had gained a solid reputation during the 1730s as a good trainer of officers. A major element of the expeditionary army was to be a regiment of 3000 American levies, raised in the northern colonies, officered partly by local gentry and partly by officers from Britain. In April Blakeney sailed for New York to assist organizing and disciplining this regiment. In his absence, in August, he was appointed as third brigadier on the expedition.<br>
<br>The Americans began to appear at Jamaica from late September 1740. Blakeney arrived at the end of November, while the main expeditionary army arrived from Britain in late January. Cathcart had died in December 1740, and had been replaced by his second in command, Major-General Thomas Wentworth. Blakeney served throughout the expedition. At Cartagena he registered his objection to the army council of war decision on 8 April 1741 to assault the fort of San Lazar&#151;an attack which ended in disaster. From mid-1741 he acted as Wentworth's second in command. He was present with the army during its occupation of Guantanamo Bay, on the south coast of Cuba, but remained at Kingston during the abortive attack on Porto Bello in March 1742. He returned to England when the expedition was abandoned in the autumn of 1742.<br>
<br>After his return from the West Indies, Blakeney was made lieutenant-governor of Stirling Castle, which was besieged by the Jacobites during the rising of 1745&#150;6. The siege began in early January 1746, and Blakeney vigorously defended the castle, inflicting substantial casualties upon his besiegers, until relieved by the duke of Cumberland's army on 2 February. His good service was not forgotten by George II. Blakeney had been promoted major-general on 20 July 1745. He became lieutenant-general in 1747, and lieutenant-governor of the island of Minorca.<br>
<br>Blakeney went at once to Minorca, and as Lord Tyrawley, the governor, remained in Britain, he was left in chief command for ten years. As Britain and France drifted to war, a French expedition to attack Minorca was dispatched in April 1756 under the duc de Richelieu and Admiral la Galissonni&egrave;re. They intended to make a rapid attack before reinforcements could reach the garrison. Blakeney had become concerned about the French preparations as early as February but had been unable to achieve much. His only hope was that he could hold out at Fort St Philip, Port Mahon, until reinforcements arrived. Admiral the Hon. John Byng's return to Gibraltar after the inconclusive battle with Galissonni&egrave;re's fleet on 19 May ended hopes of relief, and Blakeney, after seventy days' defence, surrendered on the honourable terms that his garrison was to be transported to Gibraltar, and not made prisoners of war. Blakeney's gallant defence of Minorca contrasted greatly in the minds of the English people with the apparent failure of Byng to press home his attack. Blakeney gave ambiguous evidence at Byng's trial as to the prospects of resisting the French and reinforcing his garrison. No blame was attached to Blakeney, and he was made a knight of the Bath and Baron Blakeney of Mount Blakeney in the peerage of Ireland. He was MP for Kilmallock from 1725 to 1757. He was a popular figure; a statue of him by Van Most was erected in Dublin, and after his death on 20 September 1761, at the age of eighty-nine, he was buried on 9 October in Westminster Abbey.<br>
<br>Blakeney left no major collection of private papers. His personality and private life are therefore difficult to establish. The anonymous biography written in 1756 presents him as a traditional soldier and gentleman. He was depicted as a soldier of the soldiers, always living among them, enjoying his punch as well as any of them, and beloved by them. In his family relations he was always exemplary; he used to live on his pay, and to allow his brothers to live on his estate of Mount Blakeney. One brother swindled him grossly; but he made no change in his arrangements, and merely transferred his estate to another brother, Robert, who succeeded to the property on Blakeney's death.<br>
