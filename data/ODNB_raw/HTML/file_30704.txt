<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Benn, Sir  Ernest John Pickstone</span>, second baronet  (1875&#150;1954), <span class="occ">publisher and libertarian</span>, was born in Ferncliffe Road, Hackney, London, on 25 June 1875, the eldest child of the four sons and two daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58236/', "Sir John Williams Benn, first baronet (1850&#150;1922)")</script>, publisher and Liberal member of parliament, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1928), daughter of John Pickstone of Hyde, Cheshire. He was the elder brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30705/', "William Wedgwood Benn, first Viscount Stansgate")</script>. Ernest Benn was educated at a local dame-school and then at the Central Foundation School, Cowper Street, City Road, London; his time there was interrupted by an eighteen-month exchange visit, from 1890, to Paris, where he attended the Lyc&eacute;e Condorcet. In 1891 he joined the family firm of Benn Brothers Ltd, founded by his father in 1880 to publish the <span class="italic">Cabinet Maker</span>. This journal, declared the father, &#145;was the cornerstone, but the bricks for the House that Benn built have been collected and well and truly laid by my eldest son&#146;  (J. Benn, 8). By the turn of the century Ernest Benn had taken effective control of Benn Brothers &#145;because of his father's preoccupation with other matters&#146;  (Shaw, 281), and the business developed rapidly; the <span class="italic">Hardware Trade Journal</span> and other trade papers were acquired, others were newly launched. On 3 January 1903 he married Gwendoline Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1966), youngest daughter of Frederick May Andrews of Edgbaston, Birmingham; they had three sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Benn succeeded to the baronetcy, and to formal management of the firm, on his father's death in 1922. In 1923 he founded the book publishing company of Ernest Benn Ltd, introducing in the late 1920s the <span class="roman">Augustan Poets</span> and <span class="roman">Benn's Sixpenny Library</span> as the precursors of the paperback. In 1926, with the construction for &pound;150,000 of new premises at Bouverie House, he said that he had &#145;put the trade press into its proper place in the heart of Fleet Street&#146;  (J. Benn, 9).<br>
<br>In 1927 Benn sponsored what became the Boys' Hostels Association, of which the prince of Wales became patron, to provide residential clubs for homeless boys in London. He was president of the National Advertising Benevolent Society (1928), the Readers' Pensions Committee (1933), the Royal Commercial Travellers' Schools (1935), and the Advertising Association (1935). In 1932 he became high sheriff of the county of London. From 1934 until 1949 he was chairman of the United Kingdom Provident Institution, a position which took much of his time and where his major contribution was a significant improvement in staff conditions and relations.<br>
<br>In the First World War Benn served as a voluntary civil servant at the Ministry of Munitions and later at the Ministry of Reconstruction; he also became honorary chairman of the trade organization commissioners. He was appointed CBE in 1918. In 1916&#150;18 he wrote three books advocating collaboration between government, business, and trade unions in the management of industry. This represented his early collectivist political views. But, his son later claimed, his growing impatience with &#145;the ways of bureaucracy&#146;  (J. Benn, 10), during the war years, and a five-week visit to the United States in 1921, led him to radically alter his views and to embrace a full-blooded individualism.<br>
<br>In 1925 Benn wrote <span class="italic">Confessions of a Capitalist</span>, a classic exposition of the view that &#145;successful and conscientious businessmen were public benefactors through the employment they provided and the wealth they created&#146;  (Shaw, 282). He also epitomized the libertarian position, criticizing the process whereby &#145;Day by day, in a well-meaning effort to ease somebody's little trouble, we take away a little bit of discretion or liberty from the rest of the 40 millions of us&#146;  (Freeden, 267). Benn made the promotion of such views the central cause of his life.<br>
<br>In 1926, with Sir Hugh Bell, Benn founded the Individualist Bookshop. As leader of the Friends of Economy from 1931 he attacked what he saw as excessive public expenditure. He began a weekly magazine, <span class="italic">The Independent</span>, in 1933, but this lasted only for a short time. Benn had been a Liberal until 1929 but in that year he publicly supported the Conservatives because of what he considered to be their sounder position on individualism.<br>
<br>The increased government controls brought about by the outbreak of the Second World War revitalized the individualist movement. The Individualist Bookshop, which had closed in 1934, was reopened in 1941 and Benn wrote a large number of pamphlets as part of a sustained campaign, which continued after the war, against any move towards a state-planned economy or a reduction in personal liberty. Between 1916 and 1953 he wrote some twenty books on these subjects; he also wrote libertarian feature articles for scores of newspapers and journals at home and overseas, and contributed for many years a weekly column, &#145;Murmurings of an individualist&#146;, to <span class="italic">Truth</span>. In 1951 he protested over compulsion in the national census, and was prosecuted for refusing to fill in his form.<br>
<br>Sir Stephen King-Hall wrote of Benn that &#145;he was a most warm-hearted generous man, who while publicly proclaiming the principles of undiluted <i>laissez-faire</i> &hellip; privately followed the dictates of his great humanity&#146;  (J. Benn, 12). He believed in his role as paternalist employer and philanthropist, concerned for his workers' welfare and contributing to many causes and charities. His son suggested that Benn could be a stubborn man, with a strong belief in his own correctness. This both typified his approach to his political causes and at times caused difficulties for his family to whom he was &#145;apt to dictate&#146;  (ibid.). Benn died at Oxted and Limpsfield Hospital, Oxted, Surrey, on 17 January 1954.<br>
