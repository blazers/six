<span class="headword">Maitland,  Thomas</span>, eleventh earl of Lauderdale  (1803&#150;1878), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, born on 3 February 1803 at Frankfort, co. Cork, was the only son of the Hon. William Mordaunt Maitland (<i>d</i>. 1841), general in the army, third son of James, seventh earl of Lauderdale, and his first wife, Mary, widow of John Travers of Fir Grove, co. Cork, and daughter of the Revd Richard Orpen, of Killowen, co. Kerry. He entered the navy in 1816, and was promoted lieutenant of the <i>Euryalus</i> on 16 May 1823. In December 1825 he was appointed to the <i>Superb</i>, guardship at Portsmouth, and in March 1826 to the <i>Ganges</i>, flagship of Sir Robert Waller Otway, on the South American station. On 30 April 1827 he was promoted commander. He married, on 7 February 1828 at Rio de Janeiro, Amelia (<i>d</i>. 18 February 1890), daughter of William Young of Rio de Janeiro; they had at least one child. In 1832&#150;3 he commanded the <i>Sparrowhawk</i> (18 guns), on the West Indian station, and brought home a treasure freight of 589,405 Mexican dollars and forty-two bales of cochineal. In 1835&#150;7 he commanded the <i>Tweed</i> (20 guns), on the north coast of Spain during the civil war, and received the cross of Charles III, which he was permitted to wear. He was advanced to post rank on 10 January 1837, and in June was appointed to command the <i>Wellesley</i> (72 guns), flagship, on the East India station, of Sir Frederick Lewis Maitland, and after Sir Frederick's death of Sir J. J. Gordon Bremer. He thus had an active share in the operations in the Persian Gulf in 1839, and during the First Opium War in 1840&#150;41, including commanding the 1st naval battalion at the storming of the heights near Canton (Guangzhou). He was made a CB on 29 June 1841, knighted in 1843, and promoted rear-admiral on 18 June 1857.<br>
<br>In 1859 Maitland was questioned by the royal commission on the defences of the United Kingdom, when he spoke strongly against the proposed fortifications at an expenditure which &#145;might be more profitably laid out in building ships; because&#146;, he said, &#145;if you can ensure being masters of the Channel, I do not see any absolute necessity, as far as security goes, for fortifying Spithead&#146;  (<span class="italic">Parl. papers</span>, 1860, 23.520). From 1860 to 1863 Maitland was commander-in-chief in the Pacific.<br>
<br>On 22 March 1863, on the death of his cousin, the tenth earl of Lauderdale, Maitland succeeded to the title, and to the hereditary offices of standard-bearer of Scotland and marshal of the royal household. On 30 November 1863 he was promoted vice-admiral. He was made a KCB, on 28 March 1865, and GCB on 24 May 1873. He was a Scottish representative peer (Conservative) from 1867 to 1878. He became an admiral on 8 April 1868, and, by special promotion, admiral of the fleet on the retired list on 27 December 1877. He died at his seat, Thirlestane Castle, Lauder, Berwickshire, on 1 September 1878; as he left no male issue, the title passed to a distant cousin.
