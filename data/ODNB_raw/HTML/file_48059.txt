<span class="headword">Miles,  Frederick George</span>  (1903&#150;1976), <span class="occ">aircraft designer and manufacturer</span>, was born on 22 March 1903 in Worthing, Sussex, the oldest of the four sons of Frederick G. Miles, laundry proprietor of Portslade, Shoreham Harbour, Sussex, and his wife, Esther, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wicks. He left school in Brighton in 1916 at the age of thirteen, while his father was away fighting in France, and started a motorcycle rental business.<br>
<br>Miles became interested in flying in 1922 and with the help of friends designed and built a small biplane, the Gnat, in his father's laundry. In 1928 he persuaded Cecil Pashley, a pilot who owned an Avro, to go into partnership with him and start a flying school and joyriding business, the Gnat Aero Company Ltd, in Shoreham. Pashley taught Miles to fly and the enterprise expanded as they bought derelict aircraft and undertook aircraft repairs; it soon split into two companies, the Southern Aero Club Ltd, and Southern Aircraft Ltd.<br>
<br>In 1931 Miles went to South Africa intending to emigrate, but the following year he returned and married the recently divorced Maxine Frances Mary (known as Blossom), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35784/', "Sir Johnston Forbes-Robertson")</script>, the actor&#150;manager. She and her first husband, Inigo Brassey Freeman-Thomas, Viscount Ratendone, had joined the Southern Aero Club in 1930, and Miles had taught them both to fly. Miles and Blossom had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>Blossom Miles persuaded her husband to design an aeroplane and together they produced the Miles M1 Satyr, a single-seat biplane, in 1932. The following year the Hawk, designed by Miles and Blossom, who performed the stress analysis, was built by Phillips and Powis at Woodley, near Reading. Following the success of the Hawk, which was faster, cheaper, and easier to fly than the De Havilland Moth, previously the most popular private plane, they joined Phillips and Powis and Miles became technical director and chief designer. The company concentrated on light aircraft and in October 1934 its Falcon broke the light aeroplane record for the journey from Australia to England. In 1935 the firm had a number of successes in the king's cup air race, and in 1936 Colonel Charles Lindbergh asked Miles to build him a fast, long range, light aeroplane for European business trips. This became the Mohawk, first flown in 1937.<br>
<br>In 1935 the decision was taken to become a public company, with Rolls-Royce Ltd providing the financial backing. In 1936 Miles became chairman and managing director, with his brother George as technical director and chief designer. In the same year Phillips and Powis began to produce training planes for the Air Ministry, and the Miles Magister remained a standard trainer for the RAF throughout the Second World War, with more than 1200 built. In 1938 the ministry placed a &pound;2 million order for the Miles Master, and an average of seven Masters were built a week, with more than 3000 produced altogether.<br>
<br>In 1941 Rolls-Royce, no longer interested in the manufacture of airframes, withdrew its capital, and Miles bought financial control of the company. In 1942 it was admitted to full membership of the Society of British Aircraft Manufacturers, and the company was renamed Miles Aircraft Ltd in 1943. At its peak the company had 6000 employees. Miles and his wife started the Miles Aeronautical School for sixteen- and seventeen-year-olds to train as technicians and draughtsmen, which lasted until 1948.<br>
<br>Miles's most significant contribution to aeronautical progress was his design of a supersonic aircraft, the M52. In October 1943, in top secrecy, Sir Stafford Cripps, minister of aircraft production, awarded him the contract to design and produce a supersonic aircraft, powered by a Whittle engine. In February 1946, when the prototype was almost ready, the contract was cancelled by Ben Lockspeiser, controller of scientific research at the Ministry of Aircraft Production, following the discovery that scientists at the German research establishment at Volkenrode, near Brunswick, had shown that aircraft drag at high speeds could be reduced by sweeping back the wings. This was something that British scientists had not appreciated, and it was decided to cancel any high-speed projects that did not incorporate swept-back wings. In addition, Lockspeiser had never believed that manned supersonic flight would be possible. Miles was required to send all his technical information and drawings to the United States, to NASA (the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration), and as a result the Bell X-1, a straight-winged plane, was the first manned aircraft to break the sound barrier, on 14 October 1947. Meanwhile a &pound;500,000 contract was awarded to Barnes Wallis, head of research at Vickers, to design a scale model, powered by a rocket motor, to be tested with models dropped from bombers at 30,000 feet. The tests were a failure and in 1948 the contract was cancelled; in 1955 it was recognized in the white paper on the supply of military aircraft that the decision to abandon research on supersonic flight in manned aircraft seriously delayed the progress of aeronautical research in the UK. It was also generally accepted that the M52 would have been capable of reaching supersonic speeds.<br>
<br>Difficulties after the war with the return to the production of civil aircraft led to the collapse of Miles Aircraft Ltd in 1948. Miles started a new business at Redhill, and in 1949 moved back to Shoreham to start F. G. Miles Engineering Ltd. In 1961 the firm joined the newly formed Beagle Group of aircraft companies, with Miles as deputy chairman and George Miles as chief engineer of the Beagle-Miles subsidiary. After the collapse of the Beagle Group in 1969 he became chairman and managing director of Miles-Dufon Ltd, making flight simulators, and of Miles Hivolt Ltd.<br>
<br>Miles died on 15 August 1976 at the Larkspur Nursing Home in Worthing, Sussex. He was cremated at Worthing on 20 August. His widow died in 1984.<br>
