<span class="headword">Denman,  George</span>  (1819&#150;1896), <span class="occ">judge and politician</span>, was born on 23 December 1819 at 50 Russell Square, London, the twelfth child and seventh son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7495/', "Thomas Denman, first Baron Denman (1779&#150;1854)")</script>, and his wife, Theodosia Anne (1779&#150;1852), eldest daughter of the Revd Richard Vevers, rector of Kettering. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7496/', "Thomas Aitchison Denman, second Baron Denman")</script>, was his brother. He was educated first at Felsted and then at Repton School, before entering Trinity College, Cambridge, in October 1838, where he obtained a scholarship in 1840. As the son of a peer he was permitted to study classics without having to pass an examination in mathematics and distinguished himself as senior classic in 1842. He also rowed in the Oxford and Cambridge boat races of 1841 and 1842, and won the Colquhoun sculls in October 1842. He graduated BA in 1842 and was elected fellow of Trinity College on 10 October 1843. He became MA in 1854, and acted as auditor of Trinity College from 1852 to 1865.<br>
<br>On 19 February 1852 Denman married Charlotte, daughter of Samuel Hope, banker, of Liverpool; they had six children. Their eldest son, G. L. Denman, was appointed a Metropolitan Police magistrate in 1890.<br>
<br>Encouraged by his father to choose the bar as a profession Denman became a student at Lincoln's Inn in November 1843, entering the chambers of a well-known conveyancer, Peter Bellinger Brodie. In November 1844 he became a pupil of Barnes Peacock, then a junior in a large practice, staying with him until he was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn on 24 November 1846. He joined the home circuit on 2 March 1849, and gradually acquired a practice there. During his early years at the bar he also acted as a law reporter on the staff of the <span class="italic">Law Journal</span>.<br>
<br>In 1856 Denman stood, unsuccessfully, as parliamentary candidate for Cambridge University as a Liberal after the death of Henry Goulburn. In the following year he was appointed counsel to the university. He became queen's counsel in 1861. At the general election in May 1859 Denman was elected MP for Tiverton as Lord Palmerston's colleague, and held the seat until 1872, except for a short interval in 1865&#150;6. In parliament he became interested in the reform of the law of evidence in criminal trials. The <span class="roman">Evidence Further Amendment Act</span> of 1869, popularly known as <span class="roman">Denman's Act</span>, was entirely due to his efforts. This allowed witnesses of no religious belief to affirm in place of taking the oath in courts of justice, so that parties who previously could not be heard could give evidence.<br>
<br>On 3 May 1864 Denman seconded a motion for a select committee to inquire into the retention of the death penalty  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 1864, 174.2069). He was always in favour of enlarging the operation of the various reform bills and took an active part in the debate on the <span class="roman">Representation of the People Bill</span> of 1867. He also showed great interest in parliament in all questions affecting public schools and universities, and supported the <span class="roman">University Tests Bill</span> of 23 May 1870  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 1870, 201.1280).<br>
<br>In October 1872 Denman was chosen to succeed Sir James Shaw Willes in the court of common pleas. As the son of a peer he did not accept the customary knighthood. In November 1875, by virtue of the <span class="roman">Judicature Act</span>, he became justice of the Common Pleas Division of the High Court. From 1881 to 1892, when he retired from the bench, he acted as judge of the High Court of Justice, Queen's Bench Division. After retirement he became a privy councillor in January 1893, and occasionally sat on the judicial committee of the privy council.<br>
<br>Denman was popular on the bench, but was more distinguished as a graceful scholar than as a strong lawyer. He was said to have a fine presence and a beautiful voice. From his schooldays he had found writing verses easy and continued to read Greek and Latin classics for pleasure. In 1871 he published a translation of Gray's <span class="italic">Elegy</span> in Greek elegiac verse, which he dedicated to Sir Alexander Cockburn, the lord chief justice, and in 1873 the first book of Pope's translation of the <span class="italic">Iliad</span> in Latin elegiacs, which he dedicated to W. E. Gladstone. In 1896 he printed for private circulation a translation of <span class="italic">Prometheus Bound</span> in English verse. <span class="italic">Intervalla</span>, a selection of his verses in Greek, Latin, and English, was printed for private circulation in 1898.<br>
<br>Denman died on 21 September 1896 at his London home, 8 Cranley Gardens, South Kensington, and was buried in the churchyard at Willian, near Hitchin. A brass was placed in the chapel of Repton School to commemorate him and a memorial scholarship founded in his name.<br>
