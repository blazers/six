<span class="headword">Plumptre,  James</span>  (1771&#150;1832), <span class="occ">playwright and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at the president's lodge, Queens' College, Cambridge, on 2 October 1771, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22406/', "Robert Plumptre (1723&#150;1788)")</script>, president of Queens' College, and his wife, Anne Newcome. He was educated at Dr Henry Newcome's school at Hackney, where he took part in amateur theatricals and developed a strong interest in drama; in 1788 he entered Queens' College, Cambridge, but in 1790 he migrated to Clare College, from which he graduated BA in 1792, MA in 1795, and BD in 1808. He was elected a fellow of Clare College in 1794, and was ordained in the same year.<br>
<br>Like his elder sisters <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22399/', "Anne Plumptre")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22400/', "Annabella (Bell) Plumptre")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22399/', "Plumptre, Anne")</script>], James began his writing life in the Enfield circle and the theatre group in Norwich, where he acted in and wrote the prologue to Amelia Alderson's play <span class="italic">Adelaide</span> (1791). His comedy <span class="italic">The Coventry Act</span> (1793), &#145;replete with sentiment and pleasantry&#146;, was, according to the <span class="italic">Norwich Mercury</span> (19 January 1793), &#145;received with uncommon &eacute;clat, by a numerous and fashionable audience&#146;. The cast of characters included three sisters, to be acted by his own sisters. A second play, <span class="italic">Osway: a Tragedy</span> (1795), was published but not performed. Based on the classical model for male friends, Cicero's Damon and Pythias, it transports the scene to Saxon Britain, with echoes of <span class="italic">Cymbeline</span> and <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>, and depicts the taming of a tyrant through peaceful revolution. Plumptre's main dramatic work was <span class="italic">The Lakers: a Comic Opera</span> (1798). An amusing send-up of contemporary types, such as the enthusiastic botanizing lady, the tourists with carriages embracing the vogue for &#145;wild nature&#146;, and the solitary walker (who is the hero of the piece), it is interspersed with mildly pleasing songs. It is periodically revived, usually in its Lake District setting.<br>
<br>Plumptre was not as politically engaged as his two literary sisters, and he was concerned for drama as a moral educator who wished to improve its tone, as in <span class="italic">Four Discourses Relating to the Stage</span> (1809) and <span class="italic">The English Drama Purified</span> (3 vols., 1812), a selection of expurgated plays. He also published some religious works. He was curate in charge of Hinxton, Essex, from 1797 to 1805, when he returned to Cambridge. In 1812 he came into the college living of Great Gransden, Huntingdonshire, which he held until his death there on 23 January 1832. On 6 June 1815 he married Elizabeth Robinson (1770&#150;1836), who was buried beside him at Great Gransden. Selections from the travel journals he kept during his tours in England, Scotland, and Wales between 1790 and 1800 were published in 1992.<br>
