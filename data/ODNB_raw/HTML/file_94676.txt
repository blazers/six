<span class="headword">Tan Cheng Lock, Tun Sir</span>  (1883&#150;1960), <span class="occ">businessman and politician in Malaya</span>, was born at 111 Heeren Street, Malacca, then part of the British crown colony of the Straits Settlements, on 5 April 1883, the third son of Tan Keong Ann and his wife, Lee Seck Bin. He was descended from a line of Malacca <i>baba</i>&#151;Straits-born Chinese who had absorbed local cultural characteristics. His great-great-grandfather Tan Hay Kwan (<i>d</i>. 1801) had migrated to Malacca from Fukien in the late eighteenth century, and Tan Cheng Lock neither spoke nor read Chinese. He was educated at Malacca high school and the Raffles Institution in Singapore, becoming a teacher at Raffles in 1902.<br>
<br>Tan Cheng Lock's grandfather Tan Choon Bock had been a successful entrepreneur, and apparently inheriting this commercial acumen, as opposed to his father's heavy drinking, Tan Cheng Lock found his calling in the booming rubber plantations of Malacca. He became an estate assistant in 1908 and floated his own companies between 1910 and 1912. Diversifying later into banking, he was a founding director of the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation in 1932. Fortuitously he had also inherited a large fortune through his marriage to Yeo Yeok Neo, daughter of Yeo Tin Hye, in 1913, with whom he had four daughters and one son.<br>
<br>This combination of inherited and self-made wealth underwrote Tan's emergence in the inter-war years as leader of the Straits Chinese. After holding public office in Malacca from 1912 Tan became an unofficial member of the Straits Settlements legislative council in 1923, and progressed to the executive council ten years later. His loyalty to the British empire proved not incompatible with demands for a modicum of self-government and the development of a common Malayan identity and citizenship. With his wife's ill health, however, and disillusionment with the &#145;pro-Malay&#146; tendency in British colonial policy, Tan resigned from public office in 1935. He spent the next four years in Europe. During the Japanese occupation of Malaya he and his family took refuge in India. In a memorandum to the Colonial Office in the closing months of the Pacific war he set forth a political vision for the reoccupation, calling for a united self-governing Malaya within the empire-Commonwealth, in which there would be equal rights and responsibilities for all communities to foster a common Malayan patriotism across the former Straits Settlements and Malay States. He again set out this vision in his only book, <span class="italic">Malayan Problems from a Chinese Point of View</span> (1947).<br>
<br>Tan's demands seemed to have been finally met in the new Malayan Union constitution of 1946 (notwithstanding Singapore's exclusion). Yet when he returned to Malacca in June of that year the British were already backpedalling, faced by the mass Malay protests orchestrated by the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO). The new federation after February 1948 did retain a centralized administration in Kuala Lumpur. But sovereignty was returned to the Malay sultans and citizenship for non-Malays was severely curtailed. Tan came to lead the All Malayan Council of Joint Action campaign from the end of 1946 for a more democratic, racially inclusive Malaya (including Singapore). In this he found himself allied with some odd bedfellows, including Malay dissidents and communist front organizations. Yet by the end of 1947 he had distanced himself from the non-co-operation campaign and managed to avoid the round-up of radicals that followed the beginning of the Malayan Communist Party's armed insurrection in June 1948. In the context of winning &#145;hearts and minds&#146; for a non-communist Malaya, Tan made his return to respectable politics. He joined the Communities Liaison Committee in late 1948, out of which came official encouragement for the creation of the Malayan Chinese Association (MCA) as a means of luring the Chinese masses from the Malayan Communist Party. Tan became the MCA's founding president in February 1949, and narrowly avoided a communist assassination attempt two months later. But he was no British stooge, consistently arguing that the Chinese would only come to regard Malaya as the prime focus of their loyalty if they were afforded the same citizenship rights as the Malays.<br>
<br>Through the Communities Liaison Committee Tan developed close ties with the Malay leader, Onn bin Jaafar. When Onn resigned his UMNO presidency to form the Independence of Malaya Party in August 1951 Tan campaigned for the new multiracial party. However, other MCA leaders, notably H. S. Lee, rejected Tan's attempts to integrate with the Independence of Malaya Party and instead brokered electoral pacts with UMNO between 1952 and 1953. Lacking influence outside Malacca, and increasingly weary with age, Tan was reluctantly forced to disengage from Onn. Under the leadership of Tunku Abdul Rahman, the UMNO-MCA Alliance (joined by the Malayan Indian Congress after 1954) won a landslide victory in the 1955 elections for internal self-government, and led Malaya to full independence in 1957.<br>
<br>In the early 1950s Tan, who was knighted in 1952, was no mere MCA figurehead. Contrary to his characterization as a &#145;dodderer&#146;  (Stockwell, 2.455) by Sir Gerald Templer (high commissioner and director of operations, 1952&#150;4), British officials continued to regard him as the one Chinese leader who was widely known and respected throughout the country. Indeed he had succeeded in reorganizing the MCA by 1952 from a welfare organization into a fully functioning political party. Nevertheless, although retaining his MCA presidency, Tan played less of a role in party decision-making from 1954. Thereafter his son, Tan Siew Sin (1916&#150;1988), was <i>de facto</i> leader of the MCA, becoming minister of commerce and industry and minister of finance in independent Malaya/Malaysia. Increasingly frail, Tan Cheng Lock (who received the title of dato from the sultan of Johor in 1949 and that of tun from the paramount ruler of Malaysia in 1958) died of a heart attack at the General Hospital, Malacca, on 13 December 1960. He was buried in the Chinese cemetery, Malacca.<br>
