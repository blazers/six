<span class="headword">Bernard,  Agnes  Morrogh</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Mary Joseph Arsenius]</span>  (1842&#150;1932), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic nun</span>, was born on 24 February 1842 at Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, the only child of John Morrogh (<i>d</i>. 1866), landowner, who changed his name to John Morrogh Bernard on inheriting the Bernard estates in co. Kerry in 1849, and his wife, Frances Mary Blount (<i>d</i>. 1888). After her birth the family moved to Cork, where they lived until 1849, when they went to live at Sheheree House on her father's inherited estate.<br>
<br>Agnes Morrogh Bernard was educated at home by her mother until 1854, when she was sent to Laurel Hill convent in Limerick, where she spent three years. She returned to Sheheree House for a year before finishing her education in the Convent of Dames Anglaises in Paris. While still a student she had felt herself drawn to religious life; her father, who was opposed to her joining a religious community, finally allowed her to enter a convent when she reached the age of twenty-one.<br>
<br>On 2 July 1863 Agnes Morrogh Bernard entered the noviciate of the Sisters of Charity in Dublin. She took as her religious name Mary Joseph Arsenius, and was known as Sister (later Mother) Mary Arsenius. After her profession in 1866 she took up teaching posts in Gardiner Street in Dublin, and later in King's Inns Street School. She was appointed to the Mountjoy Street convent in 1869 and subsequently to Lakelands Orphanage, where she remained in charge until 1877. Her various convent experiences included managing budgets, overseeing the laundry work of the Magdalen Asylum, and supervising building works within the convents&#151;skills which were to be beneficial in her later work. On 24 April 1877 she was appointed reverend mother of a new convent in Ballaghaderreen in co. Mayo. In 1879 the convent borrowed money to build a national school in the convent grounds and from 1886 it also ran an industrial school.<br>
<br>In April 1891 Mother Mary Arsenius, with four other nuns, opened a convent in Foxford, co. Mayo, an area racked by poverty. The convent initially took over the local national school and, to provide some employment for the local people, she decided to set up a woollen mill, the Providence Woollen Mill. She received a loan of &pound;7000 from the newly formed congested districts board, the function of which was to support projects that aimed to alleviate poverty in areas along the western seaboard of Ireland. Another loan was received in 1893 to provide training for workers. By 1899 the convent had received a further &pound;7000 for technical training. This was spent not only on the factory workers but also on the instruction of local cottiers in gardening, poultry breeding, and improved farming methods. All her projects were carefully planned and skilfully managed.<br>
<br>Mother Mary Arsenius declared herself to be apolitical. During the months following the fall of Charles Stewart Parnell a number of the mill workers derided the parish priest for his anti-Parnellite stand. She was informed by the local hierarchy that these workers had to apologize for their behaviour or an interdict would be inflicted on those concerned. Mother Mary Arsenius made a public apology on the workers' behalf. Her other foray into public politics came during the war of independence when some of the mill workers became the victims of the Black and Tans in 1921: she had the culprits brought to justice despite threats of retaliation.<br>
<br>In 1898 Mother Mary Arsenius undertook the task of building roads in the area; through her scheme cart roads were built to the doors of 118 houses. In addition, she encouraged the local authorities to build labourers' cottages. She was also interested in the social and cultural life of the area, and supported the efforts of the Gaelic League to revive Irish language and culture.<br>
<br>In 1869 Mother Mary Arsenius had suffered a bout of eczema which developed into erysipelas; she was to endure ill health for the rest of her life. However, she remained active in her various projects up to her death. She died at the convent at Foxford on 20 April 1932, from a flu-related illness, and was buried in the graveyard there on 23 April.<br>
