<span class="headword">Matthews,  Marmaduke</span>  (<em>c.</em>1606&#150;<em>c.</em>1683), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was born at Swansea, the son either of Matthew Matthews of Swansea, or of Matthew Jones of Nydfywch, Llangyfelach, and his wife, Mary. On 20 February 1624 he matriculated from All Souls College, Oxford, graduating BA on 25 February 1625 and proceeding MA on 5 July 1627; a possible brother, Edward Matthews, son of Matthew Jones of Swansea, matriculated at Oxford on 11 July 1634, aged nineteen. Nothing is known of Matthews's life in the decade after his graduation, but in 1636 he was recorded as vicar of Penmain in the Gower by William Laud, then bishop of St David's, in his annual account, which noted further that Matthews expressed puritan sentiments against Laud's wishes and that he was &#145;preaching against the keeping of all holy-days, with divers other, as fond or profane opinions&#146;  (LPL, MS 943). As a consequence, he was &#145;inhibited&#146; by the bishop, and proceedings were initiated against him in the court of high commission.<br>
<br>Some time between 1636 and 1638 Matthews emigrated to New England to avoid censure by the state and church authorities. He was perhaps among the &#145;severall Welsh Gentlemen of Good note &hellip; procured&#146; by Edward Winslow of the Pilgrim Church at Plymouth, Massachusetts, to assist Robert Blinman of Gloucester after his acceptance of the pastorate of the branch church at Mansfield in 1639  (Dodd, 30). After a visit to the West Indies, Matthews returned to New England and became a &#145;teaching-elder&#146; of the church at Maldon. Here he became involved in a dispute about a fast, and as a result his election as a full freeman of the colony was deferred. In 1640 he was appointed as the pastor of Yarmouth, Massachusetts, and in 1649 was a minister at Hull, south of Boston, but again he became embroiled in a dispute with local magistrates. Although Matthews received the support of his congregation, he was denied the privilege of preaching &#145;untill he hath given satisfaction to the Elders that heard the errors chardged and proved against him&#146;  (ibid., 31). He subsequently moved on to two other pastorates within the Boston area.<br>
<br>During his time in New England, &#145;whilst I yet lived in the midst of wild men, and wild Beasts, amongst the Lords Exiles&#146;, Matthews and his family were sustained financially, as he later acknowledged, by Colonel Philip Jones  (Dodd, 35). In 1654 they returned to Wales at Jones's behest, and through his patronage Matthews was appointed in 1655 minister of St John's, Swansea, &#145;a good living&#146;  (Calamy, 2.732). He became a member of the committee for the approbation of public preachers (the &#145;triers&#146;) in Wales, and in 1656 signed the <span class="italic">Humble Representation and Address from South Wales</span> to Oliver Cromwell. During the late 1650s there is evidence that he was opposed by radical Quaker preachers, of whom he was described as &#145;an envious persecutor&#146;, for instance pinching Alice Birkett so hard that &#145;her blood came forth&#146; and threatening to &#145;box&#146; Robert Coldbeach of Swansea  (Gawler, 27). For many years, as Matthews explained in <span class="italic">The Messiah Magnified by the Mouthes of Babes in America</span> (1659), he had been trying to convert the ungodly, &#145;to see their teares trickle, their lips quiver, their hue to change, their joynts to tremble; and to observe &hellip; their weeping for the piercing of Christ&#146;  (Matthews, 8). That year he also published <span class="italic">The Rending Church Member Regularly Call'd Back</span>.<br>
<br>In 1662 Matthews was ejected, but in spite of financial constraints, &#145;preached, by the connivance of the magistrates, in a little chapel at the end of the town&#146;  (Palmer, 3.504). His <span class="italic">The Reconciling Remonstrance</span> appeared in 1670, and on 12 April 1672 he obtained a licence, under the declaration of indulgence, to preach as an Independent. He conducted services at his house in Swansea and was described as &#145;a very pious and zealous man, who went about to instruct the people from house to house&#146;, receiving a mixed reception  (Calamy, 2.732). In his later years he &#145;lived above the world&#146;, and was supported by the &#145;children of God, his own children, and the children of the world&#146;  (ibid.). His sons (whose mother's name is unknown)&#151;Manasseh, Mordecai, and Lemuel [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18346/', "Mathews, Lemuel")</script>]&#151;also became nonconformist ministers, but later conformed to the established church. Matthews died in Swansea about 1683.<br>
