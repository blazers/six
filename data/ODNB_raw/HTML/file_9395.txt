<span class="headword">Field,  Theophilus</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1575, <em>d.</em> 1636), <span class="occ">bishop of Hereford</span>, baptized on 22 January 1575 at St Giles Cripplegate, London, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9248/', "John Field (1544/5?&#150;1588)")</script>, Church of England clergyman, preacher there, and his wife, Joan, and brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9391/', "Nathan Field (bap. 1587, d. 1619/20)")</script> the actor. He was admitted to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in January 1592, but transferred to Pembroke College where he graduated BA in 1596 and proceeded MA in 1599, and was elected a fellow in 1598. He was incorporated at Oxford on 16 July 1600, and proceeded from Cambridge BD in 1605 and DD in 1611.<br>
<br>In 1600 Field edited and contributed to two books of elegies on the death of Sir Horatio Palavicino, one in Latin the other in English, in which he thanked Palavicino for being his patron for six years. He was appointed rector of Cotton, Suffolk, in 1607, vicar of Mashfield (probably Mayfield), Sussex in 1610, and vicar of Lydd, Kent, in 1611, holding the last living until 1627. By 1619 he was also a chaplain to the king. On 10 October 1619, through the interest of the marquess of Buckingham, he was consecrated bishop of Llandaff. Before 1621 he married Alice, whose surname is unknown.<br>
<br>In March 1621, during its impeachment proceedings against Lord Chancellor Bacon, the House of Commons uncovered an allegation that in March 1619 Field had undertaken to influence a case in chancery in return for a large bribe, the lion's share of &pound;6000, from Edward Egerton, one of the parties in the suit. Field seems to have been acting opportunistically in the hope of using his connections with Buckingham, and John Chamberlain's claim that Field was Bacon's chaplain and broker in the lord chancellor's peculations  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1619&#150;23</i>, 238, 260) appears to be mistaken, although Field's co-conspirator, Randall Davenport, was Bacon's servant. MPs were horrified, especially that someone who had since been elevated to the episcopal bench should be involved, and Sir Robert Phelips complained of &#145;the now reverend but then practical Doctor&#146;  (Notestein and others, 2.225&#150;60). The House of Lords failed to substantiate all the allegations and cleared Field of bribery but, not finding him entirely faultless, requested the archbishop of Canterbury to admonish him publicly in convocation.<br>
<br>The case appears to have been little check to Field's ambitions, and within weeks he was urging Buckingham to promote his suit to be translated to Hereford as the only way that his credit, &#145;so cruelly cracked with the sharp teeth of the wide mouth of vulgar lying fame&#146;  (BL, Harl. MS 7000, fol. 57<i>r</i>) could be restored. Field was a master of the wheedling and importuning letter, and he pestered Buckingham and others with pleas for a better and richer bishopric. He pressed the case of his six children who, he feared, would have only a lecture in parsimony from their father in place of their deserved patrimony. His <span class="italic">Parasceve paschae, or, A Christians preparation to the worthy receiving of the blessed sacrament</span> (1624), a revised edition of a work first published in 1622 and dedicated to the duchess of Lennox, was this time dedicated to Buckingham, as probably also was <span class="italic">A Watch-Word, or, The Allarme</span>, a Lent sermon published in 1627.<br>
<br>On being advanced in July 1627 from what Field called &#145;miserably spoiled Llandaff&#146;  (<span class="italic">Third Report</span>, HMC, 32) to St David's, he thanked Buckingham for his translation but called the move a &#145;banishment into remoter Wales&#146; and complained that &#145;my years and accounts do find the print so small, that my benefit is not legible in this Welsh edition&#146;, adding a plea for another move, this time to an English see  (BL, Add. MS 34274, fol. 158<i>r</i>). He had to wait until December 1635, when he was elected bishop of Hereford. Gordon Goodwin in the nineteenth century considered that Field &#145;took no very exalted view of his profession, nor ever troubled himself much about its duties&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>) and it is evident that he found life in Wales uncongenial for, as he remarked in 1629, the ways to his diocese were &#145;steep, craggy, and welshly tedious&#146;, and when he arrived in that &#145;desolate place&#146; there was not &#145;so much as a leech to cure a sick horse&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/150, fol. 170<i>r</i>). Nevertheless, he was no less assiduous in his duties than the age demanded, and personally carried out visitations of both Llandaff and St David's cathedrals. Field died on 2 June 1636, not six months after his translation to Hereford, and was buried in the north transept of the cathedral beneath a monument bearing his bust and a fulsome inscription. He was survived by his wife.<br>
