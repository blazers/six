<span class="headword">Mallon,  John</span>  (1839&#150;1915), <span class="occ">detective</span>, was born on 10 May 1839 at Meigh, co. Armagh, a small village in the parish of Killeavy. His father, Thomas Mallon, a Catholic tenant farmer, may have belonged to the secret Ribbon Society. Mallon went to the local national school and Newry model school. He was apprenticed to a draper for three years, but in November 1859 went to Dublin, hoping to join the Royal Engineers. He was turned down as insufficiently qualified but a local landlord (Colonel Close) sent him to Sir Henry Lake, chief commissioner of the Dublin Metropolitan Police.<br>
<br>Mallon joined the Dublin Metropolitan Police on 1 December 1859 as a clerk. His intelligence, discretion, and hard work impressed Superintendent Daniel Ryan, head of the G (detective) division. In 1861 Mallon became confidential clerk to Ryan, who delegated much business to him. Mallon's activities against Fenianism gave him extensive knowledge of the separatist movement, and a personal network of spies and informers. In 1869 he became the youngest inspector in the force. In 1874 Mallon succeeded Ryan as head of G division, having been promoted over several senior officers.<br>
<br>Mallon's name became widely known in the early 1880s through his activities against the Land League, its allies and directors in the Irish Parliamentary Party, and the separatist secret societies with which some of its supporters were linked: it was he who arrested Charles Stewart Parnell, leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, in 1881. After the assassination of Lord Frederick Cavendish and under-secretary Burke in Phoenix Park, Dublin, on 6 May 1882, Mallon was prominent in the &#145;Star Chamber&#146; headed by Judge John Adye Curran, which gathered evidence against the Invincibles (the group accused of the assassinations) and tricked one of their leaders, James Carey, into turning informer. Lord Spencer, the lord lieutenant, reported in August 1882 that the Dublin detective service depended on Mallon: &#145;were he to die or be killed we have no one worth a row of beans&#146;  (K. R. M. Short, <span class="italic">The Dynamite War</span>, 1979, 88).<br>
<br>In 1883 Mallon was promoted to chief superintendent, continuing to supervise intelligence operations in Dublin. He claimed his achievement was not fully acknowledged because of his Catholicism, and that some Castle officials suspected his loyalty. This may reflect his necessarily ambiguous relationship with his sources. While Mallon reported regularly on subversive activities, he refused to commit much of his knowledge to paper and kept secrets from his superiors to protect his informants. He gave this reason for refusing to testify at the Parnell commission, though he gathered evidence for <span class="italic">The Times</span> in its attempt to link the Irish party with political violence. His relations with Patrick Egan, Land League treasurer and Invincible organizer, were particularly shadowy. Some suspected that Egan had given information to Mallon and that Mallon had enabled him to escape to America.<br>
<br>Until his promotion in 1883, when he moved into Dublin Castle, Mallon lived openly on the North Circular Road, Dublin, defying plots against his life. He maintained a tone of affable familiarity with his suspects and claimed that for him preventing crimes by warning conspirators was preferable to making arrests after a crime had been committed. Thus he spread fear and distrust among opponents and promoted a legend of his own omniscience.<br>
<br>Mallon claimed to be a good Catholic and nationalist. He was pious, and perhaps had nationalist sentiments, but used these professions to manipulate potential sources of information and suspects under interrogation. His reports sneer at most of the objects of his surveillance; his recollections exaggerate his own role in the Phoenix Park investigation. This arrogance, encouraged by success in making informers&#151;a &pound;5 note, he said, bought a great deal of patriotism&#151;could be dangerous; some claimed Mallon might have prevented the Phoenix Park murders if he had not despised the Invincibles.<br>
<br>In 1893, with the help of his old adversaries in the Irish Parliamentary Party, Mallon became assistant commissioner of the Dublin Metropolitan Police, the first officer in the force to attain this post from the ranks. He still supervised G division until his retirement (1 January 1902), when he returned to Meigh, bought a small estate, and became a JP for Armagh. He had married, on 8 January 1866, Elizabeth Byrne, daughter of a Dublin greengrocer, John Byrne, and they had three sons and a daughter; his wife predeceased him. Mallon became ill after mass at Meigh on 9 October 1915 and died at the parochial house, Meigh, an hour later. He was buried at Old Killeavy burial-ground.<br>
