<span class="headword">Long,  Sidney Selden</span>  (1863&#150;1940), <span class="occ">army officer and transport entrepreneur</span>, was born on 31 March 1863, the fifth son of James Long, commissary-general, and his wife, Anna, daughter of Andrew Kirkwood, of Clongoonah, Ireland. Educated privately, Long followed his father into a military career, eventually in what would now be termed logistics, entering via the militia, from which he moved to the Durham light infantry in 1884. Five years later he transferred to the Army Service Corps (ASC, later the Royal Army Service Corps, RASC), a move possibly influenced by his father's example. His career was now set in the path it would follow through military into civilian life. Service in south China as deputy assistant adjutant-general (DAAG), 1896&#150;9, was followed by distinguished service in the South African War (1899&#150;1902). He became DAAG (later assistant adjutant-general) for transport, commandant of the ASC training establishment, Aldershot (1908&#150;9), assistant director of supplies (1909&#150;12), and director of supplies and quartering (1913&#150;14). For the first half of the First World War (1914&#150;16) he was director of supplies and transport at the War Office. He was made a companion in the Order of the Bath in 1914.<br>
<br>Long's background and career experience thus led him to, and fitted him for, a key post in the first major war mechanized on any scale; and this, in turn, opened the way for a pioneering role in commercial road transport and distribution. The official history of the RASC describes Long's role as director of supplies and transport as &#145;to initiate upon the right lines the gigantic task of expanding a force of 500 officers and 6000 men (the pre-war RASC) into one which ultimately reached &hellip; 12,000 officers and 320,000 men&#146;. To achieve this, Long had to organize &#145;the training of all ranks in all descriptions of the work of transport and supply&#146;, and &#145;the provision of motor vehicles and &hellip; all that was needful for vast armies scattered all over the world&#146;  (Reader, 15&#150;16). Long's origins in the protestant ascendancy and his military experience and success helped to create a personality described as &#145;direct, impetuous, even irascible&#146;  (Reader, 16). His military career effectively came to an end in May 1915, when he stood out against Lloyd George's plan, implemented through Sir Eric Geddes, to take over motor vehicle production and the supply of motors for the army. Long resisted the loss of the army's independence in procurement for some time, but resigned in March 1916, with the rank of major-general.<br>
<br>Long had apparently served on an official committee with Sir William Lever (later first Baron Leverhulme) in the early part of 1916. At this time Lever, who, years before, had shown an appreciation of the motor vehicle in its infancy, was concerned with improving the efficiency of group transport operations. In consequence, Long joined Lever Brothers in late 1916; by the summer of 1917 he was advocating the establishment of a separate transport company within the group, replacing the independent operations of the individual manufacturing companies. It took more than six months for Long's views to prevail, and then he was successful only in part&#151;achieving the centralized distribution of finished products, crucial for both soap and margarine, but not the collection of raw materials. SPD Ltd (the initials derived from &#145;speedy prompt delivery&#146;) was incorporated in July 1918, and Long was its first chairman (as well as a director of Lever Brothers, which changed its name to Unilever in 1929), serving with SPD until the end of 1931. He spent his first years as a Lever director at Port Sunlight, where he and his wife &#145;took an active interest in the life of the village and its institutions&#146;  (Leverhulme, 14). He was given an appreciative profile in the Unilever house journal on his retirement, yet he did not record his civilian career in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span>. His service with SPD was not without controversy, probably attributable not only to his strong personality, but also to intra-group rivalries and genuine, if unfounded, fears about the common transport of foodstuffs and cleaning materials.<br>
<br>In addition to his work for SPD, Long was a member of the Commercial Motor Users' Association, and also served as its president. Between the wars Long played an important role in national transport bodies. During the 1920s he was an assiduous chairman of the transport committee of the Federation of British Industries, retiring at the end of 1931. Little is known about his private life, but it is known that he married Augusta Elizabeth, daughter of Colonel T. G. Glover, and they had one son. Long's wife predeceased him in 1938, and he died on 31 January 1940 at 16 Fitzroy Square, London.<br>
