<span class="headword">Jones,  (Holroyd) Anthony  Ray-</span>  (1941&#150;1972), <span class="occ">photographer</span>, was born at Wookey House, Wookey Hole, near Wells in Somerset on 7 June 1941. He was the youngest of three sons of Raymond Ray-Jones (<i>d</i>. 1942), a fine art printer and painter, and his wife, Effie Irene Pearce, a physiotherapist. Following the early death of his father, the family moved constantly during the early years of his life and eventually settled in Hampstead, London, in 1951. Ray-Jones was then sent to Christ's Hospital in Horsham, Sussex, but hated his schooling bitterly and was at the time temporarily deaf in one ear.<br>
<br>After leaving school in 1957 Ray-Jones went to the London College of Printing, where he studied graphic design. It was there that he became interested in photography and was especially influenced by social documentary photography of the time, and the work of Bill Brandt. Following his graduation in 1961 Ray-Jones was awarded a scholarship to Yale University School of Art for a graduate design programme. During this time he began to concentrate more fully on photography and more importantly encountered Alexey Brodovich (1898&#150;1971), one of America's most creative forces in design and art direction at that time. During his final year at Yale, Ray-Jones joined Brodovich's avant-garde class called the &#145;design laboratory&#146; in New York. The class, held in Richard Avedon's studio, had previously been attended by such eminent American photographers as Irving Penn, Robert Frank, and Garry Winogrand.<br>
<br>In 1963 and 1964 Ray-Jones covered street parades in New York, and the black community in New Haven, Connecticut. His work at this time was strongly influenced by the confrontational, realistic, and at times surrealistic work of contemporary photographers such as Diane Arbus, Lee Friedlander, and Garry Winogrand. After gaining his masters in fine art in 1964 he joined Brodovich as associate art director of the influential photographic magazine <span class="italic">Sky</span> and until his return to Britain in 1966 he also undertook a large amount of commercial work.<br>
<br>Once back in England Ray-Jones started to work on his long cherished ambition: a published project on the social customs and idiosyncrasies of the British during their leisure time. He wanted this to be an &#145;important statement about British society&#146;  (<span class="italic">Personal Views</span>, 31&#150;2), and one which explored the class system and different geographic areas of the country. The majority of this work was done during 1966 and 1967 and was eventually published as <span class="italic">A Day Off: an English Journal</span> (1974). It is for this work that he is most famous.<br>
<br>The black and white photographs were carefully constructed, tightly controlled, and witty with an inclination towards the bizarre. His work could be both extraordinarily complex and subtle, and his skilful insight into British class systems and social codes anticipated the work of later British photographers such as Martin Parr. Though focusing on the foibles of human nature there is a tenderness and respect in this work which leaves his subjects' dignity intact. He wrote, &#145;I have tried to show the sadness and the humour in a gentle madness that prevails in people&#146;  (Ehrlich, 30). As Ray-Jones was not technically gifted most of his printing was done by John Benton-Harris. The project was shown at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London, in 1969 in his first British solo show. Recognition also came with exhibitions abroad including &#145;Current report 2&#146; at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and a group show at the Rencontres Gallery in Paris.<br>
<br>Ray-Jones had to take on commercial work to fund his projects. He worked for the <span class="italic">Radio Times</span>, <span class="italic">Harper's Bazaar</span>, <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, and the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>. &#145;The Happy Extremists&#146;, a colour project dealing with British eccentrics, was supported by the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> and published by them in October 1970. He was, however, seen to be a &#145;difficult&#146; photographer in the commercial market&#151;often uncompromising and unwilling to let art directors and picture editors have control over his work. This resulted in him becoming blacklisted from many publications and in effect damaged his career.<br>
<br>In 1967 Ray-Jones met and married Anna Coates and became involved with the photography magazine <span class="italic">Creative Camera</span>, edited by Bill Jay. For the following years he continued to work on his project concerning the British and much of 1970 was taken up with commercial work for Manplan, on commissions for the <span class="italic">Architectural Review</span>. During this time he twice tried to become a member of the prestigious photo agency Magnum. On both attempts he was rejected.<br>
<br>In 1971 Ray-Jones returned to America to take up a post as visiting lecturer at the San Francisco Art Institute within their department of photography, despite having no teaching experience. During vacation time he was employed extensively on commercial work and also pursued personal projects&#151;many of which were shown in the retrospective exhibition of his work, &#145;The English seen&#146;, at San Francisco Museum of Art in 1974.<br>
<br>In February 1972 Ray-Jones developed leukaemia. Almost immediately he returned to England with his wife and on 13 March 1972, aged only thirty, he died in the Royal Marsden Hospital in London. He was cremated at St John's crematorium, and was survived by his wife. The National Museum of Film, Photography, and Television in Bradford acquired the entire Ray-Jones archive in 1993. This archive includes not only his photographic work but also his prolific notes and journals.<br>
