<span class="headword">Owen,  Hugh</span>  (1784&#150;1861), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Denbigh on 23 May 1784, and educated at the grammar school at Audlem, Cheshire (<i>c</i>.1795&#150;1800). Through the influence of Sir Corbet Corbet, bt, of Adderley, a kinsman of Sir Stapleton Cotton, Owen was appointed captain in the Shropshire Volunteers on 24 November 1803. In December 1805, with the aid of a recruiting party of the 16th light dragoons stationed at Market Drayton, Owen raised thirty men, which entitled him to a cornetcy in the regiment, which was then commanded by Sir Stapleton Cotton. He became lieutenant on 9 July 1807, and embarked for Portugal in 1809. Speaking French, Spanish, and Portuguese fluently, he was frequently employed in outpost duties and scouting, and commanded the skirmishers of the cavalry brigade at Talavera. In 1810 he was appointed captain of cavalry in the Portuguese army, under Marshal Beresford, and was aide-de-camp to Sir Henry Fane, in command of the rear-guard of General Hill's division in the retreat to Torres Vedras. He was afterwards brigade major to Sir Loftus Otway, commanding a brigade of the 1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th regiments of Portuguese cavalry, and then aide-de-camp and brigade major to Sir Benjamin D'Urban, commanding a brigade of the 1st, 6th, 11th, and 12th Portuguese cavalry. At the battle of Vitoria on 21 June 1813, when leading the brigade into action (in the temporary absence of General D'Urban, who had been sent on to reconnoitre), his name was noted by Wellington, who next morning directed him to apply for a troop in the 18th light dragoons, to which he was duly gazetted on 22 July 1813, subsequently receiving Portuguese rank as major and lieutenant-colonel.<br>
<br>At the peace Owen returned with the Portuguese army to Portugal, in 1815 was ordered to organize the 6th regiment of cavalry, which in the subsequent civil wars, as &#145;os dragones de Chaves&#146;, became famous for its high discipline and superior capability. Choosing to remain in the Portuguese army, Owen, after obtaining a majority in the 7th hussars, sold out of the British service on 4 September 1817. In 1820 he accompanied Lord Beresford to Brazil, and was sent home to Lisbon with dispatches and the brevet rank of colonel in the 4th cavalry. On arrival he found that the king's government had been superseded, and Lord Beresford and all other foreign officers summarily dismissed. Owen retired into private life, and lived on his estate at Villa Nova de Paraisa, near Porto. During the subsequent civil wars Dom Pedro offered to appoint Owen his personal aide-de-camp, with the rank of general, but not having the permission of his own sovereign, Owen declined.<br>
<br>Owen was a knight commander of San Bento d'Aviz and knight of the Tower and Sword, and had the Peninsular gold cross. Sir John Rennie, who met him in Porto in 1855, described him as over 6 feet in height, with a determined countenance. Owen published <span class="italic">The Civil War in Portugal and the Siege of Oporto</span> (1836), an English translation of his Portuguese work. He died at Garratt's Hall, Banstead, Surrey, on 16 December 1861, aged seventy-seven.<br>
