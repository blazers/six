<span class="headword">Punt,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1548&#150;1563), <span class="occ">polemicist and book smuggler</span>, emerged from obscurity in 1548 as the author of <span class="italic">A New Dialoge called the Endightment agaynste Mother Messe</span>. This work proved to be popular (three editions were published in two months), perhaps because it skilfully drew on the work of major evangelical writers such as William Turner and John Bale. Punt's links to Bale went beyond imitation; some time between 1549 and 1552, Punt loaned the great bibliophile two books of Latin poetry. In Mary's reign Punt demonstrated the extent of his devotion to the protestant cause. Throughout the years 1554 and 1555, he ran considerable risks acting as a courier for imprisoned protestant leaders, a task which included smuggling letters, documents, and treatises in and out of various English prisons. In 1554 Punt made the first (or at least the first known) of numerous trips to the continent, carrying a letter John Hooper wrote to his wife, Anna, in Frankfurt. Punt, however, seems to have been particularly close to John Bradford, and he was almost certainly the &#145;W. P.&#146; whom Bradford made co-executor of his books and to whom the martyr bequeathed two shirts.<br>
<br>Some time during this period Punt married Dorothy Rawlins, the daughter of Erkenwald Rawlins, an affluent London merchant and correspondent of Bradford. Rawlins fled into exile in Mary's reign, arriving in Frankfurt by the autumn of 1555 and settling in Geneva by October 1558. His daughter initially remained in England with her husband. Some time after Bradford's execution on 1 July 1555, Punt seems to have gone abroad, very probably taking his wife with him. This, however, was only a respite. In the spring of 1556, an informer wrote to Bishop Edmund Bonner of London, describing Punt as one of the &#145;principal teachers of heretical doctrine in London&#146; and as one of those who &#145;do most harm in persuading the people&#146;  (Foxe, 1605). The informant also reported that Punt was a bachelor; this probably indicates that Punt left his wife on the continent and returned to England alone. Most particularly, Bonner's informant reported that Punt was &#145;a great writer of devilish and erroneous books&#146; and that he smuggled heretical books printed on the continent into England. On Palm Sunday 1556 Punt, smuggling a barrel-load of books into London, publicly read from one of them, an attack on the Anabaptists.<br>
<br>The two major concerns of Punt's life, books and the Marian martyrs, were combined in Elizabeth's reign, when he assisted John Foxe in the research for Foxe's great martyrology, the <span class="italic">Actes and Monuments</span>. Punt's role in aiding Foxe is revealed in a letter he wrote to Foxe from Ipswich on 23 April 1563. The accuracy of one of the stories Foxe had related in the first edition had been challenged. Punt, in his letter to Foxe, revealed that he had helped Foxe interview the sources for the disputed story. Now he travelled back to Ipswich to gather depositions from various witnesses to verify the story. After this, Punt vanishes back into obscurity. He was very probably the William Punt who was licensed by Bishop John Parkhurst of Norwich to read the proscribed <span class="italic">Admonition to Parliament</span>. The William Punt of Heacham, Norfolk, whose undated will was proved in 1582 may have been the protestant writer and activist; if so, he had a new wife named Elizabeth and a daughter named Mary.<br>
