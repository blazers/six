<span class="headword">Malcolm, Sir  Charles</span>  (1782&#150;1851), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, tenth son of George Malcolm (1729&#150;1803) of Burnfoot, Dumfriesshire, and his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1811), daughter of James Pasley of Craig, Dumfreisshire, and sister of Admiral Sir Charles Pasley, bt, was born at Burnfoot in Dumfriesshire on 5 September 1782. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17865/', "Sir Pulteney Malcolm")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17864/', "Sir John Malcolm")</script> were his brothers. In 1791 his name was put on the books of the <i>Vengeance</i>, commanded by his uncle, Commodore Thomas Pasley, and in 1793 of the <i>Penelope</i>, of which his brother Pulteney was first lieutenant. He entered the navy in person in 1795 on the <i>Fox</i>, then commissioned by his brother, with whom he went out to the East Indies, and whom he followed to the <i>Suffolk</i>. He was promoted by the admiral to be lieutenant of that ship, on 12 January 1799, and remained in her until 3 October 1801, when he was appointed acting commander of the sloop <i>Albatross</i> (a promotion confirmed by the Admiralty to 28 May 1802). In 1803 he returned home acting captain of the <i>Eurydice</i> (24 guns), and on his arrival in England found that he had been previously promoted captain by the Admiralty on 29 December 1802. In 1804 he commanded the <i>Raisonnable</i> in the North Sea, and from 1806 to 1809 the frigate <i>Narcissus</i> on the coast of France and Portugal; at Porto in 1807 he was able to save much British property from the French. In the beginning of 1809 he went out to the West Indies, and in April took part in the capture of the Saintes Islands. On his return to England he was moved into the <i>Rhin</i> (38 guns), in which during 1812 and 1813 he co-operated with the patriots on the north coast of Spain. In 1813 he went out to the West Indies in convoy; in 1814 he was cruising on the coast of Brazil; and on 18 July 1815, having been joined by the frigates <i>Menelaus</i> and <i>Havannah</i> and the sloops <i>Fly</i> and <i>Ferret</i>, he landed a party of seamen and marines at Corrijou on the coast of Brittany, stormed the battery, and brought out of the harbour three small armed vessels and a convoy under their protection. The action was of a type that had become customary, but was the last such during that war.<br>
<br>In September 1817 Malcolm fitted out the <i>Sibylle</i> (44 guns), as flag captain to Sir Home Popham in the West Indies, from where he was invalided in February 1819. From 1822 to 1827 he commanded one or other of the yachts <i>William and Mary</i> and <i>Royal Charlotte</i> in attendance on the Marquess Wellesley, lord lieutenant of Ireland, by whom he was knighted in 1827.<br>
<br>In November 1827 he was appointed superintendent of the Bombay marine, then reorganized and placed under new regulations, which required it to have a captain of the Royal Navy at its head. Malcolm arrived at Bombay in June 1828, where he reformed the navy. On 1 May 1830 its name was officially changed to the Indian Navy, and in addition to the rigorous discharge of its police duties, it became distinguished as a school of surveyors. Malcolm held the post for ten years, and on his being relieved was officially thanked by the governor in council. The introduction and establishment of steam navigation in the Red Sea were also largely due to him. He was promoted rear-admiral on 10 January 1837, and vice-admiral on 28 April 1847, but had no further service.<br>
<br>During his later years Malcolm gave much attention to professional institutions and charities. He also served continuously on the council of the Royal Geographical Society. He was twice married: first, on 4 June 1808, to his cousin Magdalene, daughter of Charles Pasley, his mother's brother; and second, on 11 April 1829, to Elmira Riddell, youngest daughter of Major-General Shaw. With his first wife he had one daughter, and with his second three sons, two of whom became naval officers.<br>
<br>Malcolm died at Brighton on 4 June 1851, and was buried in the catacombs at the Brighton cemetery.<br>
