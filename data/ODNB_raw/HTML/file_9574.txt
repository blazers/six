<span class="headword">Fitzgerald,  Maurice</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1176), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45551/', "Gerald of Windsor")</script>, castellan of Pembroke, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19905/', "Nest")</script>, daughter of Rhys ap Tewdwr, king of Deheubarth (south Wales). He was thus uterine half-brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9642/', "Robert fitz Stephen")</script>, paternal uncle of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9582/', "Raymond fitz William Fitzgerald (Raymond le Gros) (d. 1189x92)")</script>, and maternal uncle of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9599/', "Meiler fitz Henry")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10769/', "Gerald of Wales")</script>, who recounted his deeds with great partiality. Gerald linked him with the cantred of Llansteffan, an association supported by a mandate of Bernard, bishop of St David's (1115&#150;48), ordering him not to interfere with the land of Pentywyn which he had confirmed to the priory of St John, Carmarthen. When Llansteffan Castle fell to the Welsh in 1146, its recapture was attempted unsuccessfully by &#145;the sons of Gerald&#146;, among whom, no doubt, Maurice may be numbered.<br>
<br>In 1167 Fitzgerald mediated with Rhys ap Gruffudd, king of Deheubarth, for the release from captivity of Robert fitz Stephen, on condition that he would go to fight in Ireland, and was himself recruited by Diarmait Mac Murchada, exiled king of Leinster, to help recover his kingdom, on promise of a grant of Wexford and two adjoining cantreds to Robert fitz Stephen and himself. In autumn 1169 he landed at Wexford with ten knights, thirty mounted archers, and about a hundred foot archers. In the company of Mac Murchada he went to the relief of &Oacute; M&oacute;rda, king of Laigis, against Mac Gilla P&aacute;traic, king of Osraige, who had recruited Maurice de Prendergast, and, early in 1170, campaigned with Mac Murchada in the vicinity of Dublin where the surrounding districts were laid waste, resulting in the submission of the citizens. Gerald of Wales depicted Mac Murchada suggesting marriage to his daughter, A&iacute;fe, to Robert fitz Stephen and to Fitzgerald in turn; but as both men already had legal wives, they were obliged to decline. It is likely that Gerald invented this sequence to explain why, if Gerald's own relatives had achieved so much, Mac Murchada was still anxious to secure the personal intervention of Richard fitz Gilbert, earl of Pembroke and lord of Striguil, known as Strongbow.<br>
<br>Following the taking of Waterford by Strongbow and his marriage to A&iacute;fe in August 1170, Fitzgerald joined him at Waterford, arriving in the company of Mac Murchada and Robert fitz Stephen. In 1171 he was one of the defenders in the two-month siege of Dublin by Ruaidr&iacute; Ua Conchobair, king of Connacht, and claimant to the high-kingship. Gerald of Wales depicts him making an exhortatory speech arguing that the besieged could not look to succour from England, for &#145;just as we are English as far as the Irish are concerned, likewise to the English we are Irish&#146;  (Giraldus Cambrensis, <span class="italic">Expugnatio</span>, 80&#150;81), and urging a vigorous attack on Ua Conchobair's forces, which was inspired partly by anxiety for the safety of Robert fitz Stephen and his own (probably second) wife and children, who had been left in the garrison at Carrick, Wexford. Three companies, in the third of which were Fitzgerald and the earl, as well as two of Fitzgerald's sons, Gerald and Alexander, then mounted a surprise attack on Ua Conchobair's decamped army. Henry II, during his visit to Ireland in 1171&#150;2, reserved Wexford as royal demesne, thus overriding Mac Murchada's grant to Fitzgerald. Before his departure, Henry assigned him to the Dublin garrison under Hugh de Lacy and at some time before 1173 granted him the middle cantred of U&iacute; F&aacute;el&aacute;in in which Naas was situated, possibly only in custody, since it was to be restored to Strongbow as lord of Leinster by Henry II about 1173. Fitzgerald was present at the hill of Tlachtga, Meath, when Tigern&aacute;n &Oacute; Ruairc, king of Br&eacute;ifne, was killed during negotiations with Hugh de Lacy, Fitzgerald supposedly saving Lacy's life by having been forewarned by a dream of his nephew, Griffin, of an impending treacherous attack by &Oacute; Ruairc. He returned to Wales, but was recalled by Strongbow, who enfeoffed him in the middle cantred of U&iacute; F&aacute;el&aacute;in, and lands in Wicklow between Bray and Arklow (where he, in turn, granted lands to Meiler fitz Henry). Fitzgerald's brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7209/', "David fitz Gerald (d. 1176)")</script>, bishop of St David's, granted him stewardship (<i>dapiferatum</i>) of the lands of the see of St David's.<br>
<br>Fitzgerald's daughter Nest married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19448/', "Hervey de Montmorency")</script> and his son William (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1199) married Alina, daughter of Strongbow. He died at Wexford about September 1176 and was succeeded by William, whose tenure of the middle cantred of U&iacute; F&aacute;el&aacute;in (but not Wicklow) was confirmed to him in 1185 by Henry II's son John, lord of Ireland. Gerald of Wales depicted William fitz Aldelin as royal custodian of Leinster during the minority of Strongbow's heirs, forcing Fitzgerald's sons to give up Wicklow Castle in exchange for the castle of Ferns. It is probable, however, that Gerald obscured the distinction between custody and hereditary grant and that Fitzgerald had merely had custody of the castle of Wicklow. His son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9552/', "Gerald fitz Maurice Fitzgerald (d. 1204)")</script> married Eva of Bermingham and succeeded to the lordship of Offaly (U&iacute; Failge) in right of his wife; and his son Thomas fitz Maurice Fitzgerald (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1213) was ancestor of the earls of Desmond.<br>
