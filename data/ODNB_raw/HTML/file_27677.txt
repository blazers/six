<span class="headword">Tredgold,  Thomas</span>  (1788&#150;1829), <span class="occ">engineer</span>, was born at Brandon, near the city of Durham, on 22 August 1788. After receiving a basic elementary education at the village school he was apprenticed at the age of fourteen to a cabinet-maker at Durham. Tredgold remained with him six years, studying mathematics and architecture in his spare time, and taking advantage of the holidays granted on race days to acquire a knowledge of perspective. Following the completion of his apprenticeship in 1808 he went to Scotland where he worked five years as a joiner and journeyman carpenter. His zeal for self-improvement by intensive study affected his health, particularly through lack of sleep and relaxation. He left Scotland to work in the London office of his uncle, William Atkinson, architect to the ordnance, with whom he lived for six years. Continuing to work for Atkinson he maintained his abiding interest in engineering construction. He taught himself French to broaden his technical reading, striving to master the latest literature on engineering and architecture. He also avidly read chemistry, mineralogy, and geology, and sought to improve his knowledge of the higher branches of mathematics.<br>
<br>In 1820 Tredgold published <span class="italic">Elementary Principles of Carpentry</span>, in which he considered the problems connected with the resistance of timber in relation to making floors, roofs, bridges, and other structures. This work was intended to show clearly the principles of construction. He was conscious of the need to write plainly, avoiding, where possible, esoteric technical language. He also wrote an essay on the nature and properties of timber. With the exception of Barlow's <span class="italic">Essay on the Strength of Timber and other Materials</span> (1817) Tredgold's work was the first serious attempt in England to determine practically and scientifically the data of resistance, rather than relying on formulae calculated in the previous century. Several editions of Tredgold's work were published after his death; the latest edition appeared in 1919. This work was followed in 1822 by <span class="italic">A Practical Essay on the Strength of Cast Iron and other Metals</span>. Though they were long the standard textbooks of English engineers, the scientific value of both these works was seriously impaired by Tredgold's insufficient mathematical training, and particularly by his ignorance of the theory of elasticity, which often led him into error and rendered his reasoning obscure.<br>
<br>In 1823 the increase of business and his commitment to his studies led Tredgold to resign his position in Atkinson's office and to set up on his own account. Confident in his all-round abilities as a writer on technical subjects, he also submitted to the Edinburgh publisher Napier in 1823 an article on steel-engraving &#145;as far as it relates to printing&#146;, adding that it was &#145;not in my line of pursuits&#146;  (BL, Marvey Napier MSS). In the same year Tredgold put forward a criticism of Perkins's steam engine, arguing that it would never produce the same effect as the common condensing engine. In the last five years of his life Tredgold published numerous technical articles, in addition to several books and contributions to the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>.<br>
<br>Tredgold died, exhausted by study, on 28 January 1829, and was buried in St John's Wood chapel cemetery. He left an estate valued at under &pound;800 to his widow, Sally, three daughters, and son Thomas, who held the post of engineer in the office of stamps of the East India Company at Calcutta, where he died on 4 May 1853.<br>
