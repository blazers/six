<span class="headword">Alwyn,  William</span>  (1905&#150;1985), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born William Alwyn Smith on 7 November 1905 at 54 Kettering Road, Northampton, the son of William James Smith and his wife, Ada Tyler Tompkins. Northampton was also the birthplace of the composers Edmund Rubbra and Malcolm Arnold. Though he was of humble background&#151;his father was a grocer&#151;Alwyn's gifts were apparent in childhood, when the gift of a piccolo at the age of nine launched him on the path to music. He attended Northampton grammar school, and by fifteen he had become a pupil at the Royal Academy of Music in London, studying composition as well as the flute and piccolo. A financial crisis on the death of his father two years later meant that Alwyn had to pay his own way by playing in cinema pit ensembles and giving elementary piano lessons in the impoverished East End of London.<br>
<br>Success was not long in coming, however. Alwyn was invited back to the Royal Academy to teach composition, and also became principal flautist of the London Symphony Orchestra. On 1 January 1929 he married Olive Mary Audrey, daughter of William Joseph Pull; they had two sons. As a composer he achieved an early breakthrough with the first performance, at the 1927 Promenade Concerts, of his <span class="italic">Five Preludes for Orchestra</span>. From the mid-1930s onwards he composed over 200 scores for films of various kinds: short documentary features were his initial terrain, but he later turned to feature films, and among his sixty or more in this genre scores such as those for <span class="italic">Odd Man Out</span> (1946), <span class="italic">The Fallen Idol</span> (1948), <span class="italic">The History of Mr. Polly</span> (1949), and the Disney version of <span class="italic">Swiss Family Robinson</span> (1960) all became classics of their kind. The composer once commented that he found film work a huge stimulus: it gave him the opportunity to experiment, to work with orchestras, and to confront in music a wide range of emotional scenarios.<br>
<br>During the Second World War these skills were put to good use in composing music for a string of propaganda films for the ministry of information and the army film unit. These included <span class="italic">Desert Victory</span>, <span class="italic">Fires were Started</span>, and <span class="italic">World of Plenty</span>, all made in 1943. Alwyn played the flute many times in the series of wartime concerts mounted at the National Gallery by Dame Myra Hess, and was also active as an air-raid warden. Though he continued to write film music until the early 1960s, he always refused the temptation to emigrate to Hollywood, a possibility that was regularly on offer.<br>
<br>Sensibly, Alwyn delayed embarking on a symphonic career until he was in his forties and ready for such a step. He then began what was always conceived as a cycle of four symphonies, a tetralogy with symphonic features in itself, such as a lighter-veined scherzo or an energetic finale. Sir John Barbirolli conducted the first symphony (1949) and encouraged him to continue in this vein. The birth of the third symphony (1955&#150;6) was scrupulously recorded in a compositional diary which Alwyn later allowed to appear (in the <span class="italic">Adam International Review</span> for 1968) under the title &#145;Ariel to Miranda&#146;. The 1950s were an immensely productive decade for Alwyn, in which he wrote music in a wide variety of orchestral and chamber forms. Some of his most immediately attractive music came in his concertos, such as <span class="italic">Autumn Legend</span> (1955), which was inspired by the paintings of the Pre-Raphaelites and features a solo cor anglais; and also in <span class="italic">Lyra angelica</span> (1954), where the harp is the solo instrument, evoking a vision of heaven.<br>
<br>By now Alwyn was regularly writing songs, occasionally using his own texts for the purpose, though he also set such writers as William Blake and Louis MacNeice; and in later years he was close to the poet Michael Armstrong, whose evocations of the night strongly appealed to him. Mention should also be made of Alwyn's work on behalf of his fellow composers. He campaigned for composers' rights as an active member of the Composers' Guild of Great Britain, the Performing Right Society, the Mechanical Copyright Protection Society, and the Society for the Promotion of New Music. He was appointed CBE in 1978.<br>
<br>Alwyn may have thought that with his fourth symphony he had written the last of his &#145;dramas of contrast and emotion&#146;. There was to be an epilogue, though. In 1973, still adhering to this rubric, he added a comparatively short but powerful single-movement work, giving it the subtitle <span class="italic">Hydriotaphia</span>. This was a reference to the famous work of the seventeenth-century English religious writer Sir Thomas Browne.<br>
<br>The fifth symphony embraced the elegiac note that increasingly surfaces in the music of Alwyn's later years and that was an integral part of his aesthetic of modern Romanticism. He once identified Dante Gabriel Rossetti as an important model for him, while he claimed to have learned formal musical freedom from early exposure to the example of Liszt's &#145;Faust&#146; symphony. The last twenty-five years of Alwyn's life were spent in Suffolk, at Blythburgh, within sight of the sea. His amanuensis and literary secretary from 1961 was Doreen Mary Carwithen [<i>see below</i>], whom he had taught composition at the Royal Academy of Music. She had changed her surname to Alwyn by deed poll by the time they married, on 19 April 1975. At Blythburgh he not only composed two operas to his own librettos, <span class="italic">Juan, or, The libertine</span>, and <span class="italic">Miss Julie</span>, based on Strindberg's play, but also found time to paint, to translate modern French poetry, and to dabble in autobiography (<span class="italic">Winged Chariot</span>, which was privately published in 1983).<br>
<br>In 1981 Alwyn was severely ill after a stroke, which made him unable to compose for two years. He died at the Southwold and District Hospital, Southwold, Suffolk, on 11 September 1985, just short of his eightieth birthday. The third quartet, which he wrote in the year before his death, demonstrated undiminished powers and is one of the works within a very large corpus that is destined to be remembered.<br>
<br>Alwyn's second wife, <a name="cosubject_88725"></a><span class="headword">Doreen Mary Carwithen</span>  (1922&#150;2003), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born on 15 November 1922 at High Street, Haddenham, Buckinghamshire, the daughter of Reginald Arthur Lewis Carwithen, insurance clerk, and his wife, Dulcie Doreen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Clarke, music teacher. She was four when she first began playing the piano and violin. She subsequently played cello in local orchestras. In 1941 she obtained a county scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, and during the war she played in ENSA (Entertainments National Service Association) concerts. Her earliest composition, at the age of sixteen, was a setting of Wordsworth's &#145;Daffodils&#146; for voice and piano. In 1947 her overture <span class="italic">ODTAA</span> (&#145;One Damn Thing After Another&#146;), written two years previously, was selected by the music advisory committee of the London Philharmonic Orchestra, and given its premi&egrave;re at Covent Garden, conducted by Sir Adrian Boult. In the same year Carwithen joined J. Arthur Rank, and over the next fifteen years wrote the scores of some thirty-five films, including <span class="italic">Harvest from the Wilderness</span> (1948) and <span class="italic">Break in the Circle</span> (1955). She also wrote the music for <span class="italic">Elizabeth is Queen</span> (1953), the official film of the coronation. Meanwhile her second quartet won a Cobbett award in 1952, and her concerto for piano and strings was premi&egrave;red at the Henry Wood Prom Concerts in London. She composed little after setting up house with Alwyn in Blythburgh, and became known as Mary Alwyn. Following her husband's death she established the William Alwyn Foundation to promote his works. She also began work on new compositions of her own, including a third quartet. A severe stroke in 1999 left her paralysed down one side. She died at Austhorpe House Nursing Home, Forncett St Peter, Norfolk, on 5 January 2003. She had no children.<br>
