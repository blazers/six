<span class="headword">Oram, Sir  Henry John</span>  (1858&#150;1939), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born at Plymouth on 19 June 1858, the eldest son of John Joseph Oram, of Plymouth, and his wife, Jane Hall. He was educated at private schools in Plymouth and went, in 1873, to the Royal Naval Engineering College at Keyham, Devonport, entering the navy in 1879 as assistant engineer. Subsequently, his three years' higher engineering course at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, culminated in his graduating top of his year, with a first, in 1882. He then served as junior engineer in the troopships <i>Crocodile</i> and <i>Malabar</i>, becoming engineer in 1884. He returned to London on his appointment as assistant engineer in the department of the engineer-in-chief at the Admiralty, where he was to spend thirty-three years.<br>
<br>Oram married, on 12 July 1881, Emily Kate (<i>d</i>. 1928), only daughter of John Bardens, of Plymouth; they had two sons and two daughters. Promotion came very rapidly to Oram: in 1889 he became chief engineer, in 1893 staff engineer, and in 1897 fleet engineer. In that year he was specially promoted to inspector of machinery. With Richard Sennett he was author of <span class="italic">The Marine Steam Engine</span> (1898), long the authorized textbook for naval engineers. Oram became chief inspector in 1901 (the title being changed to engineer rear-admiral in 1903); in 1902 he was made deputy engineer-in-chief, and in 1907 he succeeded Engineer Vice-Admiral Sir Albert John Durston as engineer-in-chief of the fleet, with the rank of engineer vice-admiral.<br>
<br>There were problems with early water tube boilers and it was largely due to Oram's tenacity and skill that by 1902 the vessels fitted with these boilers had reached a satisfactory standard of performance. He was a member of the technical committee formed in 1903 to report on the designs for the machinery of the subsidized liners <i>Mauretania</i> and <i>Lusitania</i>, and he was responsible for the detailed investigations which enabled Durston to recommend the use of steam turbines in 1905 for the <i>Dreadnought</i>. While he was engineer-in-chief he introduced geared drive which enabled the rotational speed of the propeller and turbine each to be optimized, with great improvement in economy. He also served on the royal commission on oil fuel and engines under the chairmanship of Lord Fisher.<br>
<br>Oram was appointed CB in 1906 and was president of the Junior Institution of Engineers in 1908&#150;9. He was knighted in 1910, and was elected FRS in 1912. He was president of the Institute of Metals, of which he was a founder member, in 1914. For his collaboration with the United States Navy during the First World War he received the American Distinguished Service Medal. He retired as engineer-in-chief of the fleet in June 1917. He died at his home, Kilmory, Cranleigh, Surrey, on 5 May 1939.<br>
