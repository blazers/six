<span class="headword">Russell,  Robert</span>  (1757&#150;1822), <span class="occ">carrier</span>, was baptized on 8 November 1757 at Burstock, near Beaminster, Dorset, the fifth of the six children of Robert Russell. His father died at Boomer, near North Petherton, Somerset, in 1775 or 1778. His uncle Thomas Russell (1730&#150;1799) became, in the 1760s, a partner in a firm of carriers by horse-drawn wagon between Exeter and London. This firm was thenceforth managed by four generations of Russells, and the name Russell became synonymous with west country carrying. Thomas Russell ran the firm from Andover, but appears to have taken on Robert Russell as his partner at Exeter by 1780. Robert married Sarah Lathbury (<i>c</i>.1754&#150;1816) there on 29 April 1780. In 1785 the partners took over the other Exeter carrying firm, which made them the dominant carriers in the area.<br>
<br>When Thomas Russell retired in 1792, Robert Russell took over as sole proprietor, which he remained for the next twenty-four years, running the business from the former Bear inn, South Street, Exeter. The firm had about 220 horses, up to thirty wagons, and sixty or seventy staff, spread out along more than 300 miles of road. There were daily services between Exeter and London, with wagons drawn by teams of eight horses, travelling day and night, and carrying up to 6 tons of goods, and less frequent services with smaller wagons and teams between Exeter and Plymouth and Falmouth. At each intermediate place the firm had premises and staff.<br>
<br>Russell's was probably the largest carrying firm ever under the control of one man, apart from Pickfords under Joseph Baxendale in the 1820s and 1830s. It is clear that he prospered, as he purchased property in several counties, rebuilt the firm's Exeter headquarters and other premises, and was one of the founders of the Devon County Bank in 1807, contributing &pound;5000 to its stock. His success was helped by the weakness of carrying competition in the west country, war with France (which discouraged the use of coastal vessels), the East India Company's demand for west country cloth (which it exported from London), and a virtual monopoly in conveying to London the bullion brought to Falmouth by the Post Office packet boats. In 1806 Russell was described as a person of &#145;loyalty, patriotism and respectability&#146;  (&#145;Select committee &hellip; highways&#146;, 2.304).<br>
<br>However, Russell's grip on the concern slackened in the last years of his ownership, by which time he was spending only three or four days a week at Exeter, and the remainder at his house at Exmouth. His retirement from carrying, at the end of June 1816, was probably an acknowledgement that he could no longer provide the unremitting attention required by a large carrying firm. The firm was sold to a partnership of eight men, mostly employees but including Russell's only surviving son, Thomas (1783&#150;1841), who became one of the firm's Exeter partners, and after whom the firm was now named. However, Thomas Russell was sightseeing in Naples at the time (he was once described as &#145;a young art dilettante&#146;  (Lefebure, 436)), and did not return until 1818, so his father continued to play a part in the carrying business on his behalf.<br>
<br>Sarah Russell died on 29 October 1816. In 1819 Robert Russell married Anne Browne Crosse (<i>d</i>. 1831), whose property in the parish of Llanbrynmair, Montgomeryshire, was, in the late twentieth century, still occupied by his descendants. He died on 23 September 1822 at Exmouth, aged sixty-four, leaving one son and three daughters. His widow died in April 1831, aged seventy-nine.<br>
<br>Thomas Russell remained a partner in the carrying firm until 1837, when a new partnership took over, including his own son, Robert Henry Russell (<i>b</i>. 1811) who gave his name to the firm. This partnership was broken up in consequence of the actions of the Great Western Railway in 1843, when the Russell connection with carrying ended.<br>
