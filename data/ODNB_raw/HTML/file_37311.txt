<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Constable,  William</span>  (1783&#150;1861), <span class="occ">traveller and photographer</span>, was born on 5 April 1783 at Tedhams, Horley Mill, Horley, Surrey, the fifth child in the family of seven sons and two daughters of James Constable (1749&#150;1838), miller and country shopkeeper of Horley, and his wife, Susanna Jordan (1748&#150;1826). He had virtually no formal education. In 1797 he entered the drapery business of Henry Browne, a high constable of Lewes, Sussex, a keen scientist with a private laboratory and a printing press, who encouraged his assistant's artistic and scientific interests. In 1802 he joined his elder brother Daniel in founding a drapery business at 3 North Street, Brighton, where he drew and published <span class="italic">A New and Correct Plan of Brighthelmstone</span>. In 1806 the two brothers embarked on a journey of exploration to the United States. They travelled from New York to New Orleans and back, by boat, by mule, or on foot. Constable kept a detailed record and made watercolour studies which are important early topographical documents. He was engaged to plan a new town in Big Beaver Creek, Pennsylvania, which he called New Brighton.<br>
<br>On his return to England in 1808 Constable rebuilt and operated the family watermill at Horley and pursued a career as an engineer. He was appointed surveyor to the turnpike trustees of the London to Brighton roads (1818) and was responsible for the construction of a tunnel (1823) and suspension bridge in Reigate. In 1837 he was appointed engineer and surveyor of a proposed railway in Jamaica, but the project fell through.<br>
<br>In 1841 Constable embarked on the most important phase of his career, as a pioneer photographer, opening a daguerreotype portrait studio at 57 Marine Parade, Brighton, on 8 November. He built &#145;a room &hellip; in front of the house &hellip; of which the roof and front consisted of plate glass&#146;  (&#145;Photographic portraits&#146;, <span class="italic">Brighton Gazette</span>, 11 Nov 1841). He called this daylight studio &#145;the Photographic Institution&#146; in promotional announcements, extolling the virtues of the exceptional light provided by his south-facing marine location. He exchanged ideas and information with other early practitioners and invested much thought in the technical and artistic refinement of his chosen medium. His correspondence reveals a close awareness of technical developments being pursued in London and elsewhere. He undertook a journey to Paris, for example, to visit &#145;two principal makers of lenses &hellip; Chevalier and Lerebours&#146;  (W. Constable to L. Glukman, 1 June 1846, priv. coll.) and enjoyed the visits to Marine Parade of several photographers, including Richard Dykes Alexander from Ipswich, Antoine Claudet from London, and Leone Glukman from Dublin.<br>
<br>Constable was the first to photograph Prince Albert, in March 1842  (Royal Archives, Windsor Castle), and by 1848 was able to boast of &#145;many sitters from the ranks that are called noble&#146;  (W. Constable to L. Glukman, 13 Feb 1848, priv. coll.), with a client list which included William Cavendish, sixth duke of Devonshire, Ferdinand, duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the earl of Belfast, the earl of Morton, the marquess of Lorne, the marchioness of Donegal, and the grand duchess of Parma. His daguerreotypes are among the finest relics of photography's first decade. Rejecting the easy convention of the stiff and formal head and shoulders, he made fine full-length portraits, setting his subjects against a simple draped curtain or broadly painted landscape backdrop on a carpeted dais which could be revolved to find the optimum fall of light. His more overtly artistic endeavours included posed allegorical subjects or such set pieces as a chess game or a conversation over a lunch table. His business declined through the 1850s in the face of increasing competition, though his scientific interests continued undiminished. He was a founder member of the Brighton and Sussex Natural History Society in 1855.<br>
<br>Surviving daguerreotype self-portraits reveal a slim figure with strongly chiselled features. Constable's letters confirm a highly inquisitive mind regarding natural and scientific phenomena and suggest a phlegmatic temperament and a dry humour. He displayed an exceptional breadth of curiosity and his career was marked by an evident spirit of adventure and an impressive range of achievements. He had married Jemima Mott (1780&#150;1829) on 11 January 1816 but lived as a childless widower after her death in 1829. He died on 22 December 1861 at his home, 16 Egremont Place, Brighton, and was buried in Horley churchyard. His correspondence, watercolours, and some daguerreotypes are in private collections; other daguerreotypes are in the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC.<br>
