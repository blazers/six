<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Evens,  George Bramwell</span>  (1884&#150;1943), <span class="occ">broadcaster</span>, was born on 15 February 1884 at 3 Argyle Street, Anlaby Road, Kingston upon Hull, the only child of George Matthew Evens (1860&#150;1920), a Salvation Army officer, and his wife, Matilda (1862?&#150;1945), daughter of Cornelius Smith and his wife, Polly. His father was of Huguenot descent and his mother of Gypsy stock, hence his later assumption of the pseudonym Romany when he commenced the natural history radio broadcasts for children in 1931 which established his reputation as one of the most popular children's broadcasters of the era. He was also the nephew of the celebrated evangelist and preacher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36155/', "Gypsy Rodney Smith (1860&#150;1947)")</script>.<br>
<br>Evens's early years to the age of seven were very unsettled after his father left the Salvation Army to become an itinerant evangelist in 1885. Although he sang on public platforms at prayer meetings from the age of four, his early education was disrupted. Indeed, he only attended elementary school regularly from 1891 when his father became a Wesleyan home missioner in Liverpool, subsequently transferring to higher grade school in Aspeen Grove, Lodge Lane, Liverpool. His interest in wildlife was nurtured even in the predominantly urban environment of Liverpool. Visiting the docks with his father, he became fascinated by the rats leaving the holds of ships along the mooring ropes, and he took regular country walks with his dog Floss around Aigburth. He reared mice, rabbits, and pigeons, and when he was sent to Epworth College at Rhyl at the age of thirteen, he always took a pigeon with him to release on arrival to let his parents know he had reached his destination safely. He spent four years at Epworth College, emerging as a good athlete, captaining both the school soccer and cricket teams, and an accomplished pianist. Recognizing an increasingly compelling vocation for the ministry, he proceeded to Queen's College, Taunton, as a divinity student in 1902, where he also contributed his first articles on ornithology to the school magazine. He was accepted as a candidate for the Wesleyan ministry and entered the Wesleyan Theological College at Handsworth, near Birmingham, in 1905.<br>
<br>After leaving college Evens was stationed at Dalston in the East End of London, where he married on 1 August 1911 Eunice (1887&#150;1976), the daughter of Owen Thomas, a Congregational minister. They had a son and a daughter. They soon moved north, where Evens was to spend the remaining years of his ministry in the urban centres of Goole, Carlisle, Huddersfield, and Halifax. His longest pastorates were for twelve years at Carlisle (1914&#150;26), where he began lecturing on natural history and writing articles for the <span class="italic">Cumberland News</span> and the <span class="italic">Methodist Recorder</span> under the pseudonym The Tramp and for ten years at Halifax (1929&#150;39), where he reached the height of his fame as an author and broadcaster. He seized every opportunity to explore the surrounding countryside in these urban appointments, taking his fishing rod with him to Methodist synods in rural locations and purchasing an authentic horse-drawn vardo from Gypsies at a Cumbrian fair in 1921 to provide him with a well-equipped rural retreat.<br>
<br>Evens's longing for the outdoors and his artistic temperament produced a distinct lack of enthusiasm for chapel and circuit administration, much of which devolved upon his wife. Her organizational skills enabled him to combine a growing programme of speaking and broadcasting engagements with his demanding pastoral ministry. However, he possessed both a great affinity for people, especially young people, and an ability to move congregations in his preaching and conduct of worship. His sermons were eloquent in their simplicity and imbued with optimism and thankfulness. He was no scholar, and did not attempt to explain many of the great mysteries of the Christian faith. Modest and good-humoured, he was of striking appearance. Over 6 feet tall, with unusually broad shoulders, he had long raven-black hair, swept back to reveal a broad forehead, heavy eyebrows, piercing dark hazel eyes, swarthy cheeks, and a strong nose and chin. In his younger days he sported a dark moustache, invariably smoked a pipe, and never wore a hat.<br>
<br>For technological reasons Evens's pioneering <span class="italic">Out with Romany</span> radio broadcasts between 1931 and 1943 were confined to the studio, with all the sound effects of the natural world created synthetically. They took the form of imaginary descriptive rambles accompanied by his cocker spaniel Raq and his young friends Muriel Levy and Doris Gambell; it later emerged that Levy was an experienced children's writer, married with a child of her own, and that Gambell was an accomplished concert singer. The broadcasts appeared so realistic that few doubted their authenticity, and there was widespread amazement and disappointment, not least from the performers themselves, when the <span class="italic">Radio Times</span> unexpectedly revealed in 1942 that they were studio reconstructions. Their spontaneity derived from Evens's confident improvisation from a skeletal script, his ability to communicate with listeners personally, and his technique of seeming unaware that the microphone was present. &#145;Just as he had no special voice reserved for pulpit utterances&#146;, his wife later observed, &#145;so before the microphone he talked and laughed as naturally as he did at home&#146;  (Evens, 141).<br>
<br>Evens's detailed and unusual knowledge of the countryside, acquired more by observation than by scientific study, was impressive. There was, however, some initial reluctance within the BBC to transmit the broadcasts of an enthusiastic amateur nationwide until calculations of audience figures underlined their immense popularity. The programme consistently headed listener request polls, and it was estimated that at their peak some 13 million listeners tuned into his broadcasts, of whom 9 million were adults. The programme became compulsive listening during the wartime blackout and was even parodied by the comedy programme <span class="italic">ITMA</span>. The drama critic Herbert Farjeon in June 1942 pronounced it &#145;the BBC's best creation&#146;  (Evens, 113), while the broadcaster Terry Waite later recalled that &#145;Romany introduced thousands of children of my generation to the wonders of the countryside&#146;  (Loveridge, <span class="italic">Romany Returns</span>, foreword). The programme also stimulated such a demand for Evens to give public lectures that he acquired an agent in 1932, and travelled extensively throughout the north of England and the midlands. He also wrote no fewer than ten books, published between 1929 and 1944, many of them illustrated with his own photographs of wildlife. He received daily a heavy mailbag, with correspondents often enclosing specimens for him to identify, including dead birds and beetles, some in an advanced state of decay. The impact of his unrivalled influence as a naturalist was to raise awareness of the dangers that the countryside faced, and of the growing need to maintain a balance between agriculture and the world of nature.<br>
<br>Evens was never robust in health. A congenital heart murmur had rendered him unfit for military service in both world wars, and almost prevented him from entering the Wesleyan ministry. In later life he was plagued with duodenal ulcers, and following surgery he retired prematurely from the Methodist ministry in 1939. After suffering a coronary thrombosis while gardening, he died suddenly at his home, 35 Parkway, Wilmslow, Cheshire, on 20 November 1943. His death was announced in national news bulletins and was followed by fulsome tributes on <span class="italic">Children's Hour</span> and in the <span class="italic">Radio Times</span>, which mourned him as &#145;one of the great personalities of radio, a man who made millions of friends by his genius for being just himself&#146;  (Evens, 248). He was cremated at Manchester crematorium on 24 November and his ashes were scattered near Penrith, on the Cumberland fells, where a memorial birdbath was later erected.<br>
