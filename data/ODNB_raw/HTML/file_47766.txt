<span class="headword">Byers <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Morrow]</span>,  Margaret</span>  (1832&#150;1912), <span class="occ">educationist and temperance activist</span>, was born in April 1832 at Windsor Hill, Rathfriland, co. Down, the fourth child and only daughter of Andrew Morrow, a noted temperance activist, and his wife, Margaret Herron. The family engaged in farming and also operated a flax mill. On the death of her father in 1840 Margaret Morrow was sent to live with two paternal uncles in Stoke-on-Trent, England. She was later educated at Mrs Treffry's school in Nottingham, where she taught for a year before her marriage. She returned to Ulster to marry the Revd John Byers, a Presbyterian minister, on 24 February 1852. Immediately after the marriage the couple set sail for Shanghai, where John Byers was to act as a missionary. Her brief visit to America <i>en route</i> for China left her deeply impressed by the American high school system of education. Its broad curriculum and the idea that the education of boys and girls should be similar remained central to her educational thinking. After arrival in China in 1853 John Byers became fatally ill and while returning to Ireland, via New York, died at sea.<br>
<br>Margaret Byers, whose only child, a son, had been born in China, returned to Ulster and took up a teaching post in Cookstown, co. Tyrone, in 1854. On moving to Belfast in 1859 she opened an &#145;establishment for the boarding and education of young ladies&#146;. This was the Ladies' Collegiate School, founded to educate girls over the age of thirteen years. Byers was influenced by the English girls' high school movement of the 1870s, which placed great stress on public examinations and the study of Latin and mathematics, and attempted to downgrade the importance of &#145;accomplishments&#146; in girls' education. She built a new school in 1873 and this took the name of Victoria College and School from the jubilee year of 1887. In 1878 she took part in a delegation organized by her close friend Isabella M. S. Tod to extend the benefits of the newly introduced <span class="roman">Intermediate Education (Ireland) Bill</span> to girls. According to her son it was Byers who persuaded Lord Chancellor Cairns to allow the inclusion of girls in this bill. The introduction of the <span class="roman">Intermediate Education Act</span> (1878) proved to be an important step on the way toward making university education available to women. The act also provided money for prizes, scholarships, and exhibitions for girls on the same terms as boys. She took immediate advantage of the intermediate act and the new public examination system it introduced. In the 1880s and 1890s Victoria College and School became one of the top prizewinners. The curriculum of the school was varied and not all the pupils took examinations. Along with the more academic subjects were taught domestic science, art, and music. Nursery, elementary, secondary, and university education, along with teacher training, were all part of the school's work. In 1884, when the Royal University of Ireland admitted women to matriculation for the first time, Byers opened a separate university department in her school.<br>
<br>Byers was a member of the Central Association of Irish Schoolmistresses, founded in January 1882 to ensure that concessions won for girls through the intermediate act would not be diluted or taken away. Its campaign, which ran to 1890, was successful. In 1899 Byers was invited to give evidence before a parliamentary commission to report on the intermediate board. She remained a strong supporter of the intermediate system, arguing that it had revolutionized girls' secondary education in Ireland. Byers was also a member of the first senate of Queen's University, Belfast.<br>
<br>Byers was a strong temperance activist. In 1873 she helped to organize the Belfast Women's Temperance Association (WTA) and Christian Workers' Union, which later affiliated with the British WTA. Part of the work of the Belfast WTA was the founding, in 1876, of the Prison Gate Mission for Women. Byers later became the first president of the Irish Women's Temperance Union, which was founded in 1894. She was opposed to home rule for Ireland and was an active supporter of the Women's Liberal Unionist Association. Byers was also an advocate of the franchise for women and was a committee member of the Ulster branch of the National Society for Women's Suffrage. In 1905 the University of Dublin (Trinity College) conferred an honorary degree of doctor of laws on her; she was the first Ulster woman to be so honoured, in recognition of her outstanding work in education.<br>
<br>Margaret Byers died at her home, 3 Lower Crescent, Belfast, on 21 February 1912 and was buried in Belfast city cemetery. Her son Sir John William Byers (1853&#150;1920), professor of midwifery at the Queen's University of Belfast, survived her.<br>
