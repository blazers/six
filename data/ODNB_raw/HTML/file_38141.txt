<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wisden,  John</span>  (1826&#150;1884), <span class="occ">cricketer and almanac editor</span>, was born at Crown Street, Brighton, on 5 September 1826, the son of William Wisden, builder, and his wife, Mary. He was baptized at St Nicholas, Brighton, on 11 October 1826. Little is known of his early life, except that he had a brother, William, and a sister, Johanna Pechell, and went to Middle Street School, Brighton. In 1838 he went to work as pot-boy for Tom Box, the well-known wicket-keeper. He was quickly involved with cricket, first as a boy earning pennies as a longstop on the Montpellier ground, Brighton, and in 1838 he played for Eleven Youths of Brighton against Lewes. In 1845 he played his first &#145;great&#146; match, for Sussex against Kent, and, on its formation in 1846, he became a member of the famous All-England eleven, the original and most reputable of the great exhibition teams. In 1852, with Jem Dean, he founded a rival combine, the United England eleven, and with George Parr he leased the Leamington Spa cricket ground in 1849. In the same year he became engaged to George Parr's sister Annie, but, unfortunately, she died. He played county cricket for Sussex (82 matches and 578 wickets), but also once for Kent and three times for Middlesex. With George Parr he organized the first English overseas tour to the USA and Canada, thus opening cricket's &#145;oceanic stage&#146;.<br>
<br>A tiny, slight figure&#151;hence his sobriquet the &#145;Little Wonder&#146;, after the diminutive 1840 Derby winner&#151;Wisden developed into a &#145;very fast and ripping&#146; right-handed round-arm bowler. He took 681 wickets in first-class cricket, including all ten in an innings (amazingly, all were clean bowled) for the North against the South in 1850. But much of his work was done in minor cricket, and, for instance, in the seasons 1848&#150;51 it has been calculated that he took no fewer than 1307 wickets, including 455 in forty-one matches in 1851. During his American trip he took six wickets in six balls, bowling underarm against teams composed of twenty-two men from the USA and Canada.<br>
<br>Wisden retired in 1863, by which time he had earned the nickname of the Cardinal. Like other well-known professional cricketers of the age, he had already embarked on a small-scale business venture. He was cricket coach at Harrow School from 1852 to 1855, and secretary of the Cricketers' Fund Friendly Society from 1857 to his death. He was also to own The Cricketers public house at Duncton, near Petworth, Sussex, and in 1866 published <span class="italic">Cricket and How to Play It</span>.<br>
<br>However, Wisden's chief venture was the opening in 1855 of a cricketing and cigar business at 2 New Coventry Street, London, initially (until 1858) with Fred E. W. Lillywhite. It was from this &#145;Mecca for cricket lovers&#146; that the first <span class="italic">Wisden Cricketer's Almanack</span> was published in 1864, although that introductory offering was of a very general nature. In the next annual, all first-class scores were published for the first time; in 1867 the convention began of including the births and deaths of cricketers; and in 1870 descriptions of matches were contained in the almanac. There were competitors, but eventually <span class="italic">Wisden</span> outstripped these rivals and emerged as the cricketer's bible. His reputation was a pleasant one. He combined considerable business acumen with a kindly disposition towards relatives, colleagues, and employees.<br>
<br>John Wisden, who remained unmarried, died after a painful illness of cancer on 5 April 1884 at his home, 21 Cranbourn Street in Westminster, London, to where his business had moved in 1872. He was buried at West Brompton cemetery, London.<br>
