<span class="headword">Taylor,  Richard Cowling</span>  (1789&#150;1851), <span class="occ">surveyor and geologist</span>, the third son of Samuel Taylor, farmer, and Jane Cowling, was born at Hinton, Suffolk, on 18 January 1789. He was educated at Halesworth, Suffolk, and articled to Edward Webb, land surveyor at Stow on the Wold, Gloucestershire, in July 1805. He received further instruction from the geologist William Smith, who had also been a pupil of Webb, and finally became a land surveyor at Norwich in 1813. In 1820 he married Emily, daughter of George Errington of Great Yarmouth, with whom he had four daughters. He moved to London in October 1826. In the early part of his career he was engaged on the Ordnance Survey of England. Subsequently he reported on mining properties, including that of the British Iron Company in south Wales, his plaster model of which received the Isis medal of the Society of Arts. In July 1830, after the spectacular failure of the British Iron Company, he went to the United States of America. He first surveyed the Blossburg coal region in Pennsylvania, producing a report in 1833 (microfilm edn, 1991) on its geology and a possible railway connection to it. He then spent three years exploring the coal and iron veins of the Dauphin and Susquehanna Coal Company in Dauphin county, Pennsylvania, and published two elaborate reports with maps (1840). He also surveyed and reported on copper mining in Cuba (1836) and asphalt mining in Halifax, New Brunswick.<br>
<br>Taylor's knowledge of theoretical geology led him to assign the Old Red Sandstone that underlies the Pennsylvania coalfields to the Old Red Sandstone of Europe. He was elected a fellow of the Geological Society of London and was a founder member in 1840 of the Association of American Geologists and Naturalists, from which developed the American Association for the Advancement of Science. His published works included early writings on the archaeology and geology of East Anglia and works on coal. As well as general works published in 1848 and 1861, he wrote numerous specialist reports, mostly published in the United States, about coal in places as far away as China. His crowning work was <span class="italic">Statistics of Coal</span> (1845), a long, authoritative, and compendious work. He also wrote on Native American archaeology. He died at Philadelphia on 26 October 1851.<br>
