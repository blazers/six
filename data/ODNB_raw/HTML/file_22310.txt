<span class="headword">Piran</span> <span class="st"> [St Piran]</span>  (<em>supp. </em><em>fl. </em>6th cent.), <span class="occ">holy man</span>, had a strong cult in medieval Cornwall and Brittany; unfortunately nothing is known about his life with any certitude. The surviving Latin life of St Piran was probably produced at Exeter in the thirteenth century and is preserved in the fourteenth-century Gotha manuscript compilation of British saints' lives and, in abbreviated form, in John Tynemouth's similar collection of the same date (rearranged in <span class="italic">Nova legenda Anglie</span>). It is a lightly rewritten version of the life of the Irish saint Ciar&aacute;n of Saigir, with whom Piran was mistakenly identified. Joseph Loth judged that the names Ciar&aacute;n and Piran could not be identical, although an Irish <i>c</i> can be equivalent to a British <i>p</i>. Suggested identifications of Piran with the Cornish saints Kerrian (venerated at Exeter) and Keverne (patron of St Keverne, Cornwall) are equally improbable philologically.<br>
<br>There is comparatively abundant evidence for Piran's cult, which reveals his long-lasting reputation as a local founder of Christianity. It was centred at Perranzabuloe (Perran in the Sands). The earliest historical reference to it is in a charter of 960 (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 684) which mentions <i>Carnperan</i> as a boundary mark. <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span> reveals that there was a minster church dedicated to him serving a large parish and staffed by a group of canons; after the Norman conquest it was given to Exeter Cathedral and declined to the status of an ordinary parish church. However, the relics of Piran which it possessed were the object of pilgrimages, bequests, and local veneration until as late as 1558. At the end of the eighteenth century St Piran's Oratory, a small stone chapel, was discovered in the sand dunes of the nearby coast. It is unlikely to date back to the time of the saint himself but certainly predates the medieval church building which was begun about 1100. The oratory remained uncovered until the 1970s, after which it was again engulfed in sand. A Celtic stone cross, possibly still older, stands near the church.<br>
<br>Two other Cornish parishes, Perranarworthal and Perranuthnoe, were dedicated to Piran; there was an altar to him in Exeter Cathedral; and Waltham Abbey claimed to possess one of his bones. According to Gerald of Wales, there was a chapel named after him in Cardiff <i>c</i>.1172. In Brittany he was venerated about six parishes. His feast day, 5 March (borrowed, like the other details of his life, from St Ciar&aacute;n), appeared in the calendars of Hereford and of L&eacute;on and Tr&eacute;guier in Brittany. Historians of Cornwall from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century stated that tinners still kept his feast day and told stories of him. St Piran's cross, a white cross on a black ground, was allegedly the standard of Cornwall and has been adopted by modern Cornish nationalists.<br>
