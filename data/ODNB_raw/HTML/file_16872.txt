<span class="headword">Llywarch Hen</span> <span class="st"> [Llywarch ab Elidir Lydanwyn]</span>  (<em>supp. </em><em>fl. </em>late 6th cent.), <span class="occ">legendary hero</span>, the subject of an important cycle of early Welsh saga poetry, is known from the Welsh genealogies as one of the &#145;men of the north&#146; (<i>gw&#375;r y gogledd</i>), from an unspecified British kingdom among those not yet under Anglian domination. He was a descendant of Coel Hen, and first cousin on the male side to the important historical and saga figure <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28016/', "Urien Rheged")</script>. Hagiographical and pseudo-historical traditions from pre-Norman Brycheiniog make the men first cousins twice over, with both their mothers said to be the daughters of the eponymous Brychan Brycheiniog. Llywarch's epithet, Hen (&#145;the Aged&#146;), may have had dynastic significance, but in literature he is treated as the archetype of the querulous old man. The main body of the cycle of poetry, once accompanied by a lost narrative, probably dates from the ninth century, although antiquarian additions were made to the end of the middle ages.<br>
<br>In the early modern period Llywarch was believed to be the author of all of the poetry of this type, and information extracted from it is responsible for the fantastical biography of Richard Thomas, followed in other sources, which gave Llywarch a lifespan of over 150 years. Modern scholarship, chiefly that of Ifor Williams, has restored Llywarch to his proper role as subject of part of the poetry. Events in the poetry follow the downfall of Urien Rheged in the north, but the main part, concerning the loss in battle of all of Llywarch's twenty-four sons, is set in Wales, perhaps originally in Brycheiniog. Llywarch is therefore an example of a northern figure whose legend has been transferred to Wales, and there is no evidence that the poetry preserves any genuine historical traditions.<br>
<br>The earlier genealogies of the northern heroes generally end about Llywarch's generation. Later antiquarian collections sought to codify the list of Llywarch's sons, drawing names from various sources apart from the poetry, and reaching a total of well over thirty. Even the sons named in the earliest poetry must be suspect as possible inventions. Several families in Wales claimed descent from one or another of Llywarch's sons, most notably that of Merfyn Frych who became king of Gwynedd <i>c</i>.836 from an outside base of power. This has led to various theories about Merfyn's dynasty and the Llywarch Hen poetry. It has been argued that Llywarch was a figure created by Merfyn's &#145;propagandists&#146; in order to link him with the famous Urien Rheged, or that Merfyn's family had a special role in the genesis, dissemination, and preservation of the poetry, again because it stressed the family's close ties to Urien. However, there is no evidence that this genealogical link was made at an early date; the son involved is not prominent in the surviving poetry, and there is no overt political gain to be seen from the connection. The vagueness of traditions about Llywarch's enormous family of heroes allowed for much grafting onto his family. The Gwynedd link appears to be only one of many made in medieval Wales in a spirit of antiquarian speculation, and for the glory of making a claim on a character famed in literary story, and for his northern ancestry.<br>
