<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Temple, Sir  William</span>, baronet  (1628&#150;1699), <span class="occ">diplomat and author</span>, was born in London on 25 April 1628 at the Blackfriars home of his father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27114/', "Sir John Temple (1600&#150;1677)")</script>, lawyer and master of the rolls in Ireland, and his wife, Mary Hammond (<i>d</i>. 1638); he was baptized at St Anne Blackfriars on 30 April. Temple spent much of his childhood living with his uncle, the Laudian theologian Dr Henry Hammond, at Penshurst, Kent. He subsequently attended Bishop's Stortford School, probably from about 1639 to 1643, and was admitted a fellow-commoner of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, on 31 August 1644. There he became a pupil of the Platonist Ralph Cudworth. Temple left Cambridge, probably in 1647, without taking his degree, but having used his time at university to become a moderately accomplished tennis player.<h2>
<a name="DorothyandIreland"></a>Dorothy and Ireland</h2>In 1648 Temple set out for the continent to complete his education. On the Isle of Wight, during a break in his journey, he met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27109/', "Dorothy Osborne (1627&#150;1695)")</script>, daughter of Sir Peter Osborne of Chicksands (1584&#150;1653), and her brother, who were travelling to St Malo to meet their father, then the royalist governor of Guernsey. Temple seems to have immediately fallen in love with the spirited Dorothy, especially when she took the blame for some graffiti scrawled on a window pane by her brother, and they began a lengthy courtship, much of it conducted by correspondence. One half of it&#151;Dorothy's letters to him&#151;survived, their unaffected charm ensuring their abiding popularity after being first published in 1888. In reality the obstacles in the couple's way were considerable. Temple was abroad for most of the following five years: he was in France, where he learned the language, from 1648 until winter 1651, and after a brief return to England he travelled for much of 1652 in Germany, the Netherlands, and Flanders, developing a particular liking for Brussels and forming an ambition to become English resident there if Charles II were to be restored. During this journey Temple began his literary output, producing his earliest essays (heavily influenced by Montaigne) and romances. Moreover, his travels gave him a tolerant, cosmopolitan mentality (and a good grasp of languages) that were both to influence his diplomatic career and to shape his later writings. He was in Ireland briefly in 1654 before returning to London, where he engaged &#145;in the usual entertainment of young and idle men&#146;  (Moore Smith, 6). Both families, too, opposed any marriage between William and Dorothy, each believing that more prestigious matches could be found. Although they probably became engaged in February 1652 the marriage did not take place until Christmas day 1654, and in the interval Dorothy was permanently scarred by an attack of smallpox that briefly threatened her life. They lived initially with Hammond relatives at Reading, where their first son, John, was born on 18 December 1655, but moved in May 1656 to Ireland, living alternately in Sir John Temple's house in Dublin and on an estate that William acquired in co. Carlow.<h2>
<a name="PubliclifeinEngland"></a>Public life in England</h2>Temple's opposition to the Commonwealth led to a deliberate decision not to seek public office until the Restoration. His political career therefore began in earnest in March 1660 when he was elected to the Irish Convention for Carlow; he was returned for the seat once more in the legitimate parliament of May 1661. Later that summer he went to England as part of a parliamentary delegation to the king, not returning to Ireland until late in 1662. Probably in September 1663 Temple took his family back to London to stay, and at some point in the first half of 1665 he purchased a house on the site of the old priory at Sheen, in Surrey, developing a garden praised extravagantly by John Evelyn. By then his household had acquired another permanent member, his sister Martha (1638&#150;1722), who had been widowed after thirteen days of marriage to Sir Thomas Giffard in April 1662; she became the earliest chronicler of her brother's life and character. To her,<blockquote>he was rather tall than low, his shape when he was young very exact. His hair a dark brown curl'd naturally, &amp; while that was esteemed a beauty nobody had it in more perfection. His eyes grey but very lively &hellip; His humour naturally gay, but a great deal unequal, sometimes by cruel fits of spleen and melancholy, often upon great damps in the weather, but most from the cross &amp; surprising turns in his business, &amp; cruel disappointments he met with so often in &hellip; the contributing to the honour and service of his country &hellip; He grew lazy, &amp; easier in his humour as he grew older, though it had been observed to be a part of his character never to seem busy in his greatest employments. (Moore Smith, 27&#150;8)</blockquote>A lover of music, art, good wine, and conversation, his one excess, according to Lady Giffard, was an over-indulgence in fruit; hence the orangery that Evelyn commented upon, and the occasion when he gorged so many peaches at Brussels that he tactfully had to refuse the opportunity to go to Antwerp by boat. He lived off about &pound;500 a year for much of his life, giving him cause to regret, at least implicitly, his father's longevity: in 1675 he informed the earl of Danby that he was worried about the cost of keeping his family at The Hague, because &#145;if I had money of my own to make use I should not lie in any pain, but that cannot be expected of [a] man whose father still keeps the estate of the family&#146;  (Egerton MS 3325, fol. 33). Although Lady Giffard claimed that his religion was firmly Anglican, his reputation for scepticism was sometimes interpreted as atheism (indeed, Gilbert Burnet regarded him as a Confucian), and this caused him some difficulties with a hostile bishop of Ely when he stood for election at Cambridge in 1679.<h2>
<a name="Munsterandthetriplealliance"></a>Munster and the triple alliance</h2>On the outbreak of the Second Anglo-Dutch war in 1665 Temple made overtures to the secretary of state, Arlington, for a diplomatic position, and was supported by the recommendation of the lord lieutenant of Ireland, the duke of Ormond, whose initial coldness towards him had been rapidly overcome. On 22 June he was appointed special ambassador to the prince-bishop of Munster, Christopher-Bernard von Galen, England's sole ally in the war, and undertook three days of successful negotiations (in Latin) with the militaristic prelate which led to the briefly threatening invasion of Gelderland by Munster forces in the autumn. Having canvassed Arlington shamelessly for it Temple was given the position that he had long craved&#151;the residency at Brussels&#151;on 8 October 1665, and was created a baronet on 31 January 1666. In April he went back to Munster in a futile attempt to prevent von Galen withdrawing from the war. Temple's three days with the bishop in the previous year had given him a misplaced confidence in von Galen's sincerity (although he knew all too well that the bishop's promised English subsidies had fallen well into arrears), and despite being liberally wined and dined Temple's anger at being duped and concern that he might be detained culminated in a hair-raising horseback escape to D&uuml;sseldorf.<br>
<br>When the French invaded the Spanish Netherlands in May 1667, at the outbreak of the war of devolution, Temple hastily dispatched Dorothy to England but stayed on in Brussels himself. He visited Breda briefly during the peace negotiations of July 1667 that ended the Anglo-Dutch War, but had no influence on the treaty signed there. In September 1667 he visited The Hague, where he met Johan de Witt, grand pensionary of Holland. Almost immediately the two men were greatly impressed with each other. Temple, who had been convinced for some time that England's rightful diplomatic alignment should be an alliance with the Netherlands against French expansionism, shared de Witt's natural concern about the potential French threat to his country, and strongly advocated a pro-Dutch policy in his reports to Arlington. Temple's stance coincided with a change in attitude at Charles II's court, where alarm about French intentions in Flanders were supplanting the king's innate francophilia.<br>
<br>In these circumstances Temple was appointed special ambassador to the Netherlands, serving there from 17 to 28 December 1667 and (after a brief return to England for discussions) again from 3 January to 13 February 1668. His instructions empowered him to sound de Witt on a military alliance between England and the United Provinces for the defence of the Spanish Netherlands and to broker an agreement between France and Spain. In reality Temple was preaching to the converted, for de Witt had already secured the agreement of the states of Holland to such a scheme, and on 9 January he also had a favourable hearing from the states general. Moreover, the adherence of the Swedes was also virtually guaranteed beforehand. Temple's real successes were the speed with which he conducted his negotiations, his ability to convince de Witt of the trustworthiness of Charles II and Arlington, his winning over Castel Rodrigo, the governor of the Spanish Netherlands, and his insistence on signing the treaty without waiting for London to discuss the potentially problematic commercial clauses. His willingness to speak frankly and effectively to postpone discussion of contentious issues, along with unheard-of speed within the byzantine Dutch system of government, ensured that the treaty was completed within five days. The speed of Temple's actions disconcerted the French and, seemingly, Charles II too, but Temple's policy was followed through, and the ratifications of the treaty were exchanged on 8 February. Temple's reward from the states general was a gold chain and medal valued at 6000 guilders. Temple returned briefly to Brussels before going as English ambassador-extraordinary to the congress of Aix-la-Chapelle, officially from 2 April to 2 July 1668, although he did not arrive at Aix until 18 April.<h2>
<a name="AmbassadortotheNetherlands"></a>Ambassador to the Netherlands</h2>On 12 June 1668 Temple arrived in London, and shortly afterwards was appointed the first resident ambassador in the Netherlands since 1627, landing at Rotterdam on 16 August to take up his post, which carried a salary of &pound;7 a day. By now his relationship with de Witt was a strong personal friendship as well as a diplomatic duty, but Temple also spent an increasing amount of time with William of Orange. He had no inkling of the changes of attitude in England, where almost from the very first Charles II had been seeking to rebuild relations with the French, a process that culminated in the secret treaty of Dover (1670).<br>
<br>Temple's time at The Hague was taken up primarily by a succession of negotiations with the Dutch over difficult colonial and commercial issues, with the Spanish over their payment of subsidies to Swedish troops (as set out in the triple alliance), and with the Treasury commission in London over attempts to increase his allowance; Dorothy had to make a trip in person to secure the latter, from &pound;7 to &pound;10 a day. Arlington's letter to him of 1 September 1670, recalling him to London, came as a complete shock to Temple, but was a clear sign of the change of policy that had been implemented at Dover. He landed at Great Yarmouth on 16 September, and on his return to London he found the attitude towards him of the king and the ministers, even Arlington, noticeably cold. He retained the title of ambassador in name only; given the public perception of him as the leading advocate of the triple alliance his dismissal would have been a clear indication of the abandonment of that policy. In the event it was his wife's return home, of all things, that precipitated the public breach with the Netherlands and the destruction of the alliance. In August 1671, in an incident deliberately engineered by Charles and the French, the yacht <i>Merlin</i> that had been sent to bring Dorothy and her family home demanded that an entire Dutch fleet should dip its topsails to salute it. When Charles II praised her courage (she had insisted that the <i>Merlin</i>'s captain should attempt to enforce the salute) Temple philosophically replied that &#145;[although] I had made the alliance with Holland &hellip; my wife was like to have the honour of making the war&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 3.502&#150;3).<h2>
<a name="Firstretirementandreturntodiplomacy"></a>First retirement and return to diplomacy</h2>From 1670 to 1674 Temple lived in retirement at Sheen, spending much time and effort in attempting to extract back pay and expenses from the Treasury. He also returned to his writing. Probably his most enduring and famous work, <span class="italic">Observations upon the United Provinces of the Netherlands</span>, was written in autumn 1672 and published in London in the following year. Despite its unapologetic advocacy of his discarded alliance policy the work is a lively, detailed survey of the nature of the country, particularly strong on the workings of its complex system of government, and also reveals many of Temple's strengths and weaknesses as a writer. Lively and perceptive observations, many drawn from his own recollections, give the piece its attractiveness: his tendencies to digress, and to emphasize his own correctness and expertise, still grate. At much the same time Temple wrote his <span class="italic">Essay upon the Original and Nature of Government</span>, which ignored the fashionable theory of social compact, argued that society was founded on the family, that climate accounted for differences between nations, and that laws were merely customs sanctioned by lengthy usage. <span class="italic">An Essay upon the Advancement of Trade in Ireland</span> was published in 1673, having been written some years earlier for the ministry, and in October 1673 he made another attempt to revive the triple alliance policy in the paper <span class="italic">Upon the Conjuncture of Affairs in October 1673</span>.<br>
<br>When the war policy, in turn, was abandoned&#151;along with the ministers who had supported it, like his erstwhile patron, Arlington&#151;Temple was the obvious choice to attempt to rebuild Charles II's relations with the Dutch. In February 1674 Temple returned to the Netherlands as ambassador to finalize the peace treaty ending the Third Anglo-Dutch War. Shortly afterwards he turned down the position of ambassador-extraordinary to Spain, and on 27 May was appointed ambassador-extraordinary to The Hague, where he arrived in July. On 13 December 1675 he was additionally appointed one of the English plenipotentiaries to the congress to Nijmegen, and was in attendance there between June 1678 to March 1679. Temple's continued prominence in this period can be attributed largely to his successful transition from the patronage of the fallen Arlington to that of the new chief minister, the earl of Danby, whose attempt to build a foreign policy more acceptable to a sensitive and recalcitrant parliament could only benefit from the support of the leading English champion of Dutch interests. The transition was made easier by the fact that Danby, the former Thomas Osborne, was a friend from his youth (despite having been a relation and former suitor of Dorothy).<br>
<br>Temple was partly responsible for arranging the marriage between William of Orange and Mary, daughter of James, duke of York. He had always been impressed by William, seeking ways in which he could help restore him to his family's offices since as early as 1666, and in 1674 he claimed that William &#145;by his personal qualities cannot fail if he lives of making a great figure in the world&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 70948, fol. 84). A close friendship developed between the two men, supplanting that between Temple and the murdered de Witt, and Sir William's dispatches from 1674 to 1679 are full of praise for the prince. The relationship proved its worth as the idea of the marriage developed, and three years of delicate negotiation (Dorothy sometimes acting as go-between) finally culminated in the ceremony on 4 November 1677. Ten days later Temple's father died, and he succeeded to his office of master of the rolls in Ireland (having held the reversion since 1664), thereby almost trebling his annual income.<br>
<br>In July 1678 Temple was hastily sent to The Hague once more. Despite the fact that the Nijmegen treaties were about to be signed the French had suddenly announced that they did not intend to return any of the towns they had conquered in the Low Countries. Temple and the states general hastily contrived a new treaty, signed on 25 July, by which the Dutch and English pledged joint action unless the French withdrew. The French eventually complied, and Temple went on to Nijmegen, where the final treaty was concluded&#151;a treaty that he called &#145;the hardest pinch of business that ever befell me in my life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ormonde MSS</span>, new ser., 4.174), and one that he disapproved of, believing that it was too generous to the French.<br>
<br>During this period Temple twice refused the position of secretary of state. It was first offered in 1677 when it was thought that Henry Coventry would resign, then for a second time in January 1679. On the latter occasion Temple pleaded ill health and turned it down, saying that he was &#145;so honest a man as never to make so ill a bargain for so good a master, which would be like selling him very dear, a horse that I knew to be old and resty&#146;  (<span class="italic">Buckinghamshire MSS</span>, 400). In reality Temple's unwillingness to work alongside the other secretary, Sir Joseph Williamson, seems to have been at least equally responsible. Early in 1679 he proposed restructuring the privy council to Charles II and became a member of the new body (which contained equal numbers of court and country members) on 21 April. In reality this proved a sop to public opinion: Charles effectively ignored the new council, to Temple's disappointment. Temple was elected MP for Cambridge University in October 1679, a parliamentary seat being seen as essential if he was to be a candidate for secretary of state. Personal tragedy also struck the Temples in 1679, with the death of their daughter Diana of smallpox at the age of fourteen: &#145;an incurable wound&#146;, Temple called it, &#145;which I will hope I may live sometimes to forget but never to remember without the most sensible trouble and grief&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ormonde MSS</span>, new ser., 5.376).<br>
<br>In summer 1680 it was proposed that Sir William should go to Spain as ambassador-extraordinary. Despite initial reluctance he agreed to go, partly because he saw it as a way of escaping the political turmoil in England (or so he told Ormond). In the meantime he was a regular speaker for the court in the second Exclusion Parliament, but his inexperience and irregular attendance ensured that he was generally regarded as an ineffectual parliamentarian. The first part of his <span class="italic">Miscellanea</span> was published in the same year. The dramatic political realignments of January 1681, the culmination of the rise to pre-eminence of Temple's political opponent (but personal friend) Halifax, led to his removal from the privy council (on the 24th), and he also lost the Spanish embassy. His only subsequent political appointment came on 14 March 1683, when he became a commissioner for the remedy of defective titles in Ireland. Although James II was polite enough to Temple after his accession his long-standing suspicion of Sir William's close friendship with William of Orange militated against any return to office during James's reign.<h2>
<a name="Secondretirement"></a>Second retirement</h2>In 1680 Temple bought an estate near Farnham, Surrey, for &pound;2000, and on its completion in 1686 he renamed it Moor Park (after the countess of Bedford's seat in Hertfordshire, whose gardens he had long admired) and made Sheen over to his eldest son, John. Temple played no part in the events of 1688, despite being known to be closer to William of Orange than almost anyone in England, and again turned down an offer of a secretaryship of state. His son John was a more enthusiastic advocate of the change of regime, but in reality, it proved to be his nemesis: in April 1689 John filled his pockets with stones and drowned himself at London Bridge within a week of being appointed secretary-at-war by William III. According to a much later account from a family member, John had been ill for some time with &#145;a tetter on his hand which stuck in and is thought to have disordered his senses&#146;  (<span class="italic">Egmont Diary</span>, 3.311&#150;12). He believed he was not up to the job of secretary, but William had insisted on it, and the final straw came when Major-General Hamilton, whom he had recommended as an intermediary to the Jacobite lord lieutenant of Ireland, Tyrconnell, promptly defected. Therefore it was into a gloom-ridden Temple household, later in 1689, that the young Jonathan Swift arrived as a new secretary. Relations between Temple and Swift were initially strained, but gradually improved, and Temple helped his young prot&eacute;g&eacute; with the revision of the &#145;Tale of a Tub&#146;. Partly thanks to Swift's support several of Temple's important works were published in the 1690s, notably the second parts of his <span class="italic">Miscellanea</span> (1690; including his essay &#145;Ancient and modern learning&#146;) and <span class="italic">Memoirs of what Past in Christendom, from &hellip; 1672 to &hellip; 1679</span> (1691), as well as his <span class="italic">Introduction to the History of England</span> (1695), which was riddled with factual inaccuracies and interpretative distortions. He also returned to poetry, producing translations and imitations of Virgil and Horace.<br>
<br>Although William III occasionally visited Moor Park to consult him informally (as in 1692&#150;3 over the <span class="roman">Triennial Bill</span>), Temple effectively remained withdrawn from public affairs in the 1690s. As Lady Giffard noted, his health had deteriorated since the 1670s, with frequent attacks of gout (he had been troubled by fevers and eye problems even earlier than this, during his residency at The Hague) but he was determined not to consult doctors, hoping &#145;to die without them and trusted to the advice but chiefly to the care of his friends&#146;  (Moore Smith, 29&#150;30). He was seriously ill in 1693, and Dorothy's death on 7 February 1695 also seems to have affected him deeply. He resigned his post as master of the rolls in Ireland on 29 May 1696, although he had always discharged this office through a deputy. He died at Moor Park at 1 a.m. on 27 January 1699, according to Swift, and was buried on 1 February alongside Dorothy and Diana at Westminster Abbey, although his heart was buried beneath a sundial at Moor Park. By his will, dated 8 March 1695, he left some of his Irish lands to Esther Johnson, Lady Giffard's servant and Swift's Stella, and by a codicil dated 2 April 1697 he left &pound;100 to Swift himself. Temple was survived by his two granddaughters, Elizabeth and Dorothy, the children of John, the suicide, and his French widow Marie Duplessis; the baronetcy became extinct with his death.<h2>
<a name="Reputation"></a>Reputation</h2>As both a statesman and a writer Temple's posthumous reputation enjoyed more than a century of almost unchallenged acclaim followed by a dramatic decline from which it has never really recovered. Contemporaries had been divided in their assessment: Burnet was damning, calling him &#145;a vain man, much blown up in his conceit, which he showed too indecently on all occasions &hellip; he was a corrupter of all that came near him, and he delivered himself up wholly to study ease and pleasure&#146;  (<span class="italic">Burnet's History</span>, 2.70). Temple's subsequent literary standing owed much to Swift, who published many of his letters, memoirs, and miscellanea in 1700&#150;09 and immortalized Temple as the hero of <span class="italic">The Battle of the Books</span>. He gained further plaudits from Dr Johnson, the combined efforts of two such literary giants seeming to immortalize Temple as one of the great pioneers of English prose style, despite occasional negative voices (notably that of Hume). T. P. Courtenay's equally positive <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life, Works and Correspondence of Sir William Temple, Bart.</span> (1836) prompted Macaulay's devastating critique which condemned Temple as a second-rate thinker, writer, and statesman&#151;hence his famously acid remark that Temple was almost universally famous without anybody knowing very much about him. An edition of his early essays and romances by G. C. Moore Smith (1933) and a magisterial but rather dull biography by H. E. Woodbridge (1940) only partly rehabilitated Temple's literary reputation, and as late as 1970 R. C. Steensma could claim that Temple was still generally seen as &#145;a bumbling amateur scholar and an unfortunate diplomat&#146;  (Steensma, 137). The enduring popularity of Dorothy's letters to him ensured that to many general readers of the twentieth century Temple was known only as a distant and somewhat lightweight object of affection, to whom Dorothy had been initially attracted by his innate gullibility. The likes of Steensma and Samuel Holt Monk (1963) at least partly restored Temple to a position as an important, but not particularly seminal, figure in the tradition of the English essay, his particular contribution being the development of the apposite use of the paragraph. Monk and Cynthia Marburg (1932) also set Temple in the context of the seventeenth century <i>libertin</i> tradition, stressing the impact of his early visits to France, the influence of the likes of Montaigne and the Epicureans, and the powerful streak of scepticism that these influences imparted to his writings and his public life.<br>
<br>Temple's reputation as a statesman undoubtedly benefited from hindsight's casting him as a forward thinking advocate of alliance with the Dutch and opposition to France&#151;the policy that England finally adopted twenty years after his failed triple alliance. The centrality of francophobia to foreign policy making until Waterloo and beyond ensured that Macaulay, for example, could praise Temple's policy, regardless of his limited opinion of him as both a writer and a statesman. Sir Keith Feiling was less critical and less overtly whiggish in his treatment; even so he eulogized Temple as &#145;candid and courageous, human and humane&#146;, whose boldness and &#145;sanguine pressure&#146; had brought about the triple alliance  (Feiling, 153, 254). Then, in 1982 A. C. Elias damagingly suggested that Temple had deliberately altered the text of many of his manuscript letters before their eventual publication by Swift, his suggested purpose being to downplay Arlington's part in creating the triple alliance and to exaggerate his own. Elias also suggested that far from eulogizing Temple, Swift secretly despised him. Elias presented a picture of Temple as a thoroughly second-rate diplomat and writer that was, in essence, not too far removed from Macaulay's verdict. Shortly afterwards, K. H. D. Haley at least partly redressed the balance, stressing Temple's position as a diplomat rather than a statesman, and the relatively limited room for manoeuvre that the former position entailed: &#145;he had to remain fundamentally an agent, not a deviser of policy&#146;  (Haley, 314), but even in such an essentially reactive position his achievements were considerable. As Haley rightly pointed out, possessing the confidence of de Witt and William of Orange simultaneously was no mean feat, even if it meant that Temple was inevitably (and ultimately fatally) seen by some of his colleagues, and above all by Charles II, as a man who was too friendly to the Dutch, whoever happened to control their state. Haley also challenged Elias's attack on Temple's &#145;modification&#146; of his letters, noting that a diplomat writing many dispatches under heavy pressure of time would naturally wish to tidy them up before they appeared in print, and that many of the supposedly suspicious omissions or insertions detected by Elias were entirely explicable when set in context.<br>
<br>Most critics of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries were irritated by Temple's overt vanity both as statesman and writer. In his letters and works he constantly presented himself as an honest plain speaker, albeit one who could be excessively fawning towards those whom he wished to impress&#151;Arlington had to reprimand him for the extravagance of his compliments, which extended on hearing of his appointment to Brussels to likening the secretary of state to &#145;some saint, to whom they [the Flemish] profess a more particular devotion&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 77/33, fol. 293). His attempts at self-deprecation, as in the dedication of the second part of his <span class="italic">Miscellanea</span>&#151;<i>has qualescunque nugas</i> (&#145;these trifles, such as they are&#146;)&#151;have tended to leave exactly the opposite impression. He can appear somewhat authoritarian, as in his statement, reported by his sister, &#145;that no body should make love after forty, nor be in business after fifty&#146;  (Moore Smith, 29)&#151;his own retirement from diplomacy at almost exactly that age therefore seemingly part of some predetermined master plan. Conversely, his love of leisure, and determination not to let his work dominate his life, hardly fits well with the obsessive work ethic prevalent in government service since such terms as &#145;professionalization&#146; and &#145;meritocracy&#146; became fashionable. He could certainly be wildly over-optimistic and over-reliant on first impressions, as in his hopelessly mistaken opinion of bishop von Galen, was often less well informed than he would have liked or than he claimed to be (as in the case of the abandonment of the triple alliance), and was too inclined to the dramatic gesture (his sudden bursts of action, madcap journeys, and dramatic last-minute treaties perhaps compensating for the seeming indolence that Lady Giffard noted). On the other hand, his attitude to public life was characterized as much by what he was not as by what he was. Above all he was not corrupt, either by contemporary or later standards&#151;although typically for Temple he was loud and self-righteous in proclaiming the fact. In both his political and literary careers, he showed himself a keen and perceptive student of human nature, and this, perhaps, shaped both his strengths and his weaknesses: as a statesman he was a capable and reliable subordinate for the likes of Arlington and Danby, rather than an independent power broker; as a writer he was readable, intelligent, and stylish, rather than deeply profound. As a participant in one of the greatest love stories of the seventeenth century, however, Temple is always likely to retain a kind of immortality.<br>
