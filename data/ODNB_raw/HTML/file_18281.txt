<span class="headword">Mason,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1601&#150;1672), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial official</span>, was born in England. His parentage and place of birth are unknown. He served in the Low Countries under Sir Thomas Fairfax, who reportedly wrote to him at the outbreak of the civil war to urge his return; in <span class="italic">A Brief History of the Pequot War</span> Mason mentions Grubbendunk, who commanded Bois-le-Duc ('s-Hertogenbosch) during the siege of 1629  (Mason, v, 3).<br>
<br>By 1632 Mason had migrated to Massachusetts, where he was appointed to chase away pirates harassing the coast. In 1633 he was promoted captain. Mason represented Dorchester at the first general court that included deputies (1635). Later that year he moved to Connecticut, where he helped to found Windsor. The influx of settlers into New England in the 1630s heightened tensions with Native Americans. After a series of skirmishes Connecticut voted to attack the Pequots. Mason led the expedition and persuaded Mohegans and Narragansetts to join him. The combined force attacked a Pequot fort at Mystic on 26 May 1637, slaughtering as many as 700 people, most of them non-combatants, in less than an hour. Fighting continued into the summer before ending in a resounding success for the English; most Pequots were either killed or captured to be sold into slavery within New England or elsewhere.<br>
<br>His role in the Pequot War ensured Mason's place as the premier military commander in Connecticut. Although a number of older sources state that Mason was elevated to the rank of major shortly after the war, contemporary references to him invariably style him as captain until 1654, major thereafter. The war apparently created in Mason an abiding loyalty to Uncas, a Mohegan leader who fought with him at Mystic. Mason repeatedly defended Uncas against other Indian leaders and even against his fellow colonists. Considered an expert on Indian affairs, Mason was called upon repeatedly to amass information about, give advice on, collect tribute from, or otherwise intimidate the Native Americans. Decades later, at the behest of the colony, Mason composed a history of the Pequot War, which was not published under his name until Thomas Prince saw it into print in 1736. Mason's account, as might be expected of a history commissioned by a &#145;puritan&#146; Commonwealth, casts the war in a providential framework, glorying in the gruesome victory as a sign of God's approval. Along with other contemporary accounts it has fuelled a vociferous debate about the brutality of the English conquest.<br>
<br>Mason served on the Connecticut general court from 1637, rising from deputy in the 1630s to magistrate in 1642. Nothing is known of his first marriage except that it produced one daughter and ended in his wife's death in 1639. Later that year he married Anne Peck (1619&#150;1671), daughter of Robert Peck, minister of Hingham, and Peck's first wife, Anne. After New Haven, Connecticut, Plymouth, and Massachusetts formed the United Colonies in 1642, Mason served repeatedly as a commissioner (1647, 1654&#150;7, 1661). The Connecticut government requested that he move to Saybrook Fort in 1647. Mason and his family resided at Saybrook until 1659, when they helped found Norwich. This town stands in the heart of Pequot country, and settling it was part of an effort to keep that region under Connecticut's control. Mason had earlier laboured to prevent Indians from using the old Pequot hunting grounds, clashing with John Winthrop junior over the issue. He also defended Connecticut's interests against other colonies that laid claim to the region. The significance of the town and of Mason's role in it was not lost on the Indians, who reportedly attempted to assassinate him at the new town site in 1660. For his work on this and other colonial business Mason was frequently granted large tracts of land. He became deputy governor in 1660, a position which Charles II confirmed in the charter granted in 1662.<br>
<br>Mason's views contrasted with those of Roger Williams, who none the less called him his &#145;Honrd deare and ancient friend&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Roger Williams</span>, 609). Unlike Williams, who traded with the Indians and learned their language, Mason may never have mastered Algonquian, and he invariably recommended military solutions to tensions, where Williams might work for peace. The two men also differed on religious toleration, a topic Mason thought unworthy of discussion. Late in life Mason advised his colony to drop its boundary dispute with Rhode Island. He wanted to avoid royal intervention, but he also worried that the settlers whom Connecticut would absorb by seizing the land from Rhode Island were unsuited to &#145;any Tollrable Christianlike society&#146;  (Ellis, 325&#150;6).<br>
<br>Mason retired from public office in 1671, &#145;in Extream misery with the Stone or Strangury or some such desease&#146;  (&#145;Bradstreet's journal&#146;, 9.46). He died on 30 January 1672. In 1889 Norwich residents erected a statue of a colonial-era soldier in Mason's honour. In 1996, after an extended controversy over celebrating a man guilty of genocide, it was removed and relocated elsewhere.<br>
