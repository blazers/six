<span class="headword">Kilkenny,  William  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1256), <span class="occ">administrator and bishop of Ely</span>, may have been identical with the Master William of Kilkenny who, as chancellor of the church of Kilkenny, was elected bishop of Ossory in 1231, but resigned the office in 1232 before his consecration. It is certain, however, that by mid-1234 Kilkenny was a king's clerk, receiving a yearly fee of 60 marks at the exchequer until at least 1237. Drawing on his knowledge of canon and civil law, Kilkenny served Henry III during these years in a variety of ecclesiastical causes. He went twice to the papal court on royal business, in 1234&#150;5 and again in 1237. He acted as the king's proctor in several disputed elections, most famously in the case involving Simon of Elmham's contested election to the bishopric of Norwich between 1236 and 1239. He also represented the king in negotiations with Bishop Robert Grosseteste of Lincoln (<i>d</i>. 1253) arising out of a dispute in 1236 between the town and university of Oxford. In return the king presented him to the churches of Powerstock, Dorset, in 1235, and Worfield, Shropshire, in 1236.<br>
<br>Between 1238 and 1247 Kilkenny disappears from royal records. During these years he served in the household of Nicholas of Farnham (<i>d</i>. 1257), bishop of Durham from 1241 to 1249, although his connections with Durham began under Bishop Richard Poore (<i>d</i>. 1235). In May 1247 he went abroad on royal service, and by November had become archdeacon of Coventry. Not until the autumn of 1249, however, is there clear evidence that Kilkenny had rejoined the king's household. From 30 September 1249 until at least 27 October 1252 he served as controller of the royal wardrobe; and from 28 May 1250 until 5 January 1255 he was keeper of the great seal in England, exercising the responsibilities of the chancellor, and being sometimes accorded the title, but never receiving the emoluments of the office. Together with Richard, earl of Cornwall (<i>d</i>. 1272), Kilkenny played a key role in governing England during the king's expedition to Gascony in 1253&#150;4, his modesty, fidelity, and learning winning the praise of Matthew Paris and the gratitude of the king.<br>
<br>During these years Kilkenny received a variety of ecclesiastical appointments. In 1251 he was appointed to the prebend of Ipthorne in Chichester Cathedral, and the church of Dungervan in the Irish diocese of Lismore. In 1252 he acquired the church of Walton, Lancashire. By the end of 1253 he had also become rector of St Peter's, Northampton, treasurer of Exeter Cathedral, a prebendary of Dublin, and keeper of the royal hospitals at Ospringe, Kent, and Oxford. Although his appointment in 1253 to the St Paul's prebend of Caddington was annulled by the pope, he was successfully preferred to the next available prebend, Consumpta-per-Mare, between January and September 1254. Finally, in late September or October 1254, he was elected bishop of Ely. Kilkenny received the temporalities of his new see on 25 December, and resigned the seal on 5 January 1255. His consecration as bishop was delayed, however, until 15 August 1255, when he was consecrated at Bellay in Savoy by Archbishop Boniface of Canterbury (<i>d</i>. 1270).<br>
<br>Kilkenny's episcopate lasted only a year. In July 1256 he undertook another embassy on the king's behalf, this time to Spain, where he died on 21 September. His heart was returned for burial at Ely. As bishop, Kilkenny resolved a long-standing dispute with Ramsey Abbey over land boundaries in the fens. He also established a chantry to support two university scholars at Cambridge. It is possible that he issued statutes for his diocese. By his will he appointed two additional chaplains to pray for his soul at Ely, leaving 200 marks for their support.<br>
<br>Master William had some connection, perhaps a familial one, with Master Odo of Kilkenny, one of the king's canon lawyers, and with Master Henry of Kilkenny, canon of Chichester. His only certain relative, however, was his nephew Richard son of Robert, a landowner in Waterford, who in 1254 was knighted, in company with the Lord Edward, by the king of Castile.<br>
