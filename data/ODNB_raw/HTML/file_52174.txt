<span class="headword">Falleron,  James</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1439&#150;1463), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was a native of Venice, who settled in London, being first attested in the capital in 1439. During the year from October 1440 to October 1441 he was assigned to the supervision of the English host Richard Quatremains; although no view of his own trade survives, he is known to have brokered the sale of English cloth worth &pound;145 to the Venetian galley patron James Corner by a provincial draper in January 1442. Falleron's career as a merchant reached its peak in the 1450s, although direct evidence for his activity in London is slim. He exported English cloth worth just over &pound;244 on the Venetian galleys in 1449/50, and imported ginger, mace, and pepper worth almost &pound;40 in 1450, as well as forty butts of sweet wine from a Genoese carrack in February 1457. Originally a householder in Broad Street ward in 1441, he was still resident in the Broad Street and Bishopsgate area in September 1449 and in Bishopsgate in August 1451, being recorded as a Venetian merchant stranger on both the latter occasions. He was granted letters of denization by 27 May 1452, and took the freedom of London by redemption on 27 January 1453 on the surety of four of his fellow drapers. This did not, however, stop the grocer John Payne seizing a consignment of wood and wine belonging to Falleron at Southampton in 1457, as part of a campaign against Italian merchants by the London grocers. By 1463 Falleron was alleged to be in the service of the earl of Warwick (<i>d</i>. 1471), captain of Calais and the marches, but his protection on that account was withdrawn because he was still in London.<br>
<br>However, it seems likely that at least some of Falleron's business interests were based outside the capital. For instance, in partnership with the Venetian Francesco de Nicholo and the Londoners Richard Acreman and Robert Glover, he farmed the old shafts of a mine called Higesbale, at Lockridge Hill, Bere Ferrers, in Devon. The site appears to have been just to the north of Plymouth, and north-west of Bere Ferrers, closer in fact to Bere Alston. The mine was one of a group of three royal silver mines at Bere Alston, Bere Ferrers, and Combe Martin which had been pledged to the Frescobaldi in 1299. These mines had a chequered history, having yielded quite well during the period 1290&#150;1340, except apparently during the period when they were held by the Frescobaldi. The indentures drawn up between Falleron and the German clerk Adrian Sprynker, warden of the gold and silver mines of Devon and Cornwall, were dated 20 March 1453, and were to run for twelve years. The lease was taken up from 3 June 1452, which may have been the underlying reason for Falleron's acquisition of denizen status just beforehand. This and his citizenship, some eight months after the date of the indentures, would have helped him greatly in the project, giving him liberty to trade without English supervision and to move goods through the country without payment of toll. According to the usual rules, he and his partners paid the king one-tenth of the ore produced, the slags and deadwork being purified at their own expense. But the venture proved less successful than Falleron might have hoped. In his account of the workings of the mine, prepared for royal officials after four and a half years, he claimed to have spent over &pound;250 on pumping alone as the mine was subject to continual flooding, quite apart from other sums laid out to cover essential works. There was no profit. Falleron's lease was one of several to be granted during the fifteenth century, most of which were unproductive, and the workings were abandoned by 1500.<br>
