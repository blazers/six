<span class="headword">Rathbone,  (Beatrice) Irene</span>  (1892&#150;1980), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born at 63 Wellington Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham, on 11 June 1892, the eldest of three children of George Rathbone (1857/8&#150;1953), brass and copper manufacturer, and his wife, Mary Robina, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mathews (1867&#150;1964). Her father belonged to the Liverpool Rathbone family, which was prominent in Liberal politics. Her two younger brothers were educated at the progressive Bedales School, but she attended a dame school and later a south-coast boarding-school. She then embarked on a theatrical career as a member of Frank Benson's Shakespeare Company, also acting in a Noel Coward play, and taking part in the women's suffrage movement.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of war Rathbone worked as a volunteer in YMCA canteens in France and then trained as a VAD nurse, serving at St Val&eacute;ry in France and then in London hospitals, including the First London General. These experiences, along with those of a close friend, Ruby Wyld, who worked in a munitions factory, became the basis for her best-known work, <span class="italic">We That Were Young</span> (1932), a fictionalized autobiography that &#145;gives a detailed description of women's war work &hellip; as if anticipating that these lives would never survive in the pages of the histories of this war&#146;  (Marcus, 270). While Rathbone's novel was less well received than Vera Brittain's <span class="italic">Testament of Youth</span> (1933), the work is important for depicting women's emotional and practical involvement with the war. Presenting the war as a generational experience, it stripped away the glamour associated with nursing, and captured the monotony, danger, and extreme physical demands of the munitions factory, represented overwhelmingly as a world of tiring repetition and &#145;deafening, stupefying, brain shattering&#146; noise, interrupted abruptly by grotesque accidents.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">We That Were Young</span> also reflects the emotional toll of the war on women, drawing the reader into the constant background anxiety and then the devastating grief when brothers and lovers died. Rathbone works her own losses into the story: her brother Benson, to whom she dedicated the novel, died of pneumonia while in Germany in 1919 with the army of occupation, and her fianc&eacute;, Mansfield Priestley Evans, a political officer in Iraq, was killed during the uprising there in July 1920.<br>
<br>After the war Rathbone lived with women friends in a Chelsea flat, acting and working in an office. During 1919&#150;20 she appeared in productions of Chekhov plays at the Art Theatre. The experience of visiting her brother, Reginald, in India and China, inspired her first novel, <span class="italic">Susan Goes East</span> (1929). <span class="italic">They Call it Peace</span> (1936), although less well known than <span class="italic">We That Were Young</span>, reflected her increasing involvement with left-wing politics. It is a bitterly angry novel, detailing the struggles of a wartime generation to survive in a post-war Britain that has made no attempt to fulfil its promise of a home fit for heroes. It is particularly unflinching in confronting the daily misery of an underpaid or unemployed underclass and their deaths from poverty and despair, though it also documents the radical changes confronting the middle classes and explores the consciousness of both men and women. It also, importantly, treats the war as a continuum, emphasizing the extent to which the aftermath is merely a different kind of struggle for survival and stressing the betrayal of a generation who gave their lives and energy so willingly during the war.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">They Call it Peace</span> was dedicated to Richard Aldington, who had helped Rathbone to publish <span class="italic">We That Were Young</span>. They had a brief but intense affair, which resulted in her long poem <span class="italic">Was There a Summer?</span> (1943). Although the relationship ended in 1937, Rathbone visited Sury-en-Vaux in 1964, two years after Aldington's death, to place flowers on his grave. She had other relationships with men and proposals of marriage, but remained single.<br>
<br>During the 1930s Rathbone's political involvement and membership of PEN led to a close friendship with Margaret Storm Jameson as well as with other literary women such as Nancy Cunard and the journalist Louise Morgan Theis. She wrote four novels not specifically on the war, <span class="italic">The Golden Rim</span> (1933), <span class="italic">October</span> (1934), <span class="italic">When Days Were Years</span> (1939), and <span class="italic">The Seeds of Time</span> (1952). During the 1950s and early 1960s she looked after her ageing parents in Chipping Camden, Gloucestershire. She subsequently moved back to Chelsea. Her life and her writing were &#145;characterized by a frustration with women's traditional lot and by a clarity of vision that allowed her to explore women's individual struggles as well as the dynamics of the larger social and political issues they raise&#146;  (Zilboorg, 77). She died at Quinton House, Lower Quinton, Stratford upon Avon, Warwickshire, on 21 January 1980.<br>
