<span class="headword">Powell, Sir  John</span>  (1632/3&#150;1696), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the son of John Powell of Pentre Meurig, Llanwrda, Carmarthenshire. As a boy Powell was taught by Jeremy Taylor at a school at Newton Hall, whence he entered Gray's Inn on 12 November 1650, and also probably matriculated at Jesus College, Oxford, on 7 December 1650. He graduated BA on 29 March 1653, and MA in 1654 from King's College, Cambridge. He was called to the bar on 13 November 1657, becoming an ancient in 1676.<br>
<br>Nothing is known of Powell's legal practice, but in James II's reign he was marked out for rapid promotion. In April 1686 he was made a serjeant-at-law, appointed a judge of common pleas on the 24th, and knighted the next day. In the following Trinity term, in company with the other judges, he was asked his opinion of the dispensing power in the case of <i>Godden v. Hales</i>. At first he reserved judgment, but then he concurred with the majority opinion. On 13 April 1687 he was transferred to king's bench. In that capacity he was among the judges who sentenced the earl of Devonshire to a fine of &pound;30,000 for his assault on Colepeper, and presided over the trial of the seven bishops for seditious libel. On the latter occasion he showed himself hostile to the notion of a suspending power in ecclesiastical matters as set out in the declaration of indulgence because &#145;if this be once allowed of, there will need no parliament; all the legislature will be in the King&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 11.427). As regards the bishops, &#145;if the King hath no such power (as clearly he hath not in my judgement), the natural consequence will be, that this petition is no diminution of the King's regal power, and so not seditious or libellous&#146;  (Keeton, 443). Several altercations with other judges followed from this, and as one of the Verneys' correspondents wrote, &#145;Powell spoke so much that some asked if he were Advocate for the Bishops&#146;  (Verney, 1.458). Not surprisingly, Powell received his quietus on 2 July 1688, soon after the trial ended.<br>
<br>The revolution revived Powell's fortunes and on 18 March 1689 he was appointed a judge of common pleas. He faced some difficult moments when called before the House of Lords on 6 May 1689 to explain his decision to fine Devonshire, which was voted a violation of the privilege of the peerage, against <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span>, and the fundamental laws of the nation. However, he begged the house's pardon, claiming that &#145;he was misguided by some books, which he looked on as authorities&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 11.1369). On 14 June 1689 he was called before the Commons to explain why he had been turned out of office by James II, to which he supposed &#145;it was about my opinion of the dispensing power&#146;, and &#145;upon giving my judgement about several <i>quo warrantos</i> where the borough chose members of parliament by prescription&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 5.311).<br>
<br>Powell died at Exeter of the stone, on 7 September 1696, aged sixty-three, and was buried on the 26th at Broadway, near Laugharne, Carmarthenshire, where his epitaph made mention of the offer of the great seal should he have changed his course. He left his estate to his son, Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1720), created a baronet in 1698, &#145;the better enabling him to discharge the estate of Llaugharne purchased by him of Sir William Russell&#146;  (will).<br>
