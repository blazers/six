<span class="headword">Coates, Sir  William Henry</span>  (1882&#150;1963), <span class="occ">civil servant and businessman</span>, was born on 31 May 1882 at Runcorn, Cheshire, the second son of T. Mallalieu Coates, a member of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, and his wife, Esther, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Tough. Coates, who was known to his close colleagues as Billie, was educated at Loughborough grammar school. He entered the civil service in 1900, and worked in the War Office (1900&#150;04), the tax inspectorate (1904&#150;19), and the Inland Revenue department (1919&#150;25), the last as director of statistics and intelligence. On 9 September 1909 he married Claire Annie (1884/5&#150;1963), daughter of Edward Ferris, a clerk, at Canterbury. They had two daughters. During his time in the civil service Coates undertook part-time studies in law and economics at the London School of Economics, obtaining the degrees of LLB in 1916 and BSc in 1922. He received a PhD in economics in 1929.<br>
<br>Coates's most important work was his involvement with the origins and growth of Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI). In 1925, at the invitation of a former civil servant, Sir Josiah Stamp, he joined Nobel Industries, the explosives manufacturers, succeeding Stamp as company secretary. Nobel Industries was one of the four major firms which combined to form ICI in 1926, and Coates was active in the detailed organization of the merger. He was the first treasurer of ICI, in 1927&#150;9, and a director on the main board of the company from 1929 until his retirement in 1950; from 1945 he was deputy chairman. He was the acknowledged expert in ICI on finance, taxation, and economic theory, a skilled administrator and the director with overall responsibility for financial affairs. Although he had neither the authority nor the force of personality of the chairman, Harry McGowan, Coates frequently acted for the company in areas requiring detailed command of argument.<br>
<br>He gave evidence on behalf of ICI in the capital reconstruction case of 1935, when the company went to law to seek a reduction in its nominal issued capital; he was said to have been more than a match for Sir William Jowitt, a leading KC at the common law bar. He had extensive, though often informal, dealings with government. During the Second World War he drew up plans for transport nationalization, and in 1941 was appointed financial adviser to the high commissioner in Canada. Coates was a member of ICI's small post-war committee, which was set up in 1942 to identify needs and strategies for the future. He was the company's representative in antitrust legislation in the USA immediately after the war, and on the Federation of British Industry. He served in a variety of public roles, chairing, for example, the committee on excess profits tax refunds, from 1946 to 1956. Coates retired from ICI in 1950 and was appointed to a number of commercial positions, including that of deputy chairman of the Westminster Bank. He also served on the University of London senate from 1929 to 1933. He was knighted in 1947.<br>
<br>Coates possessed a clear and analytical mind, and was prone to writing donnish papers on economic and financial matters for his fellow directors. His views were not, however, always acted on within ICI, apparently being insufficiently pragmatic for some of his colleagues. He was of austere appearance and manner, and his meticulous habits are said to have included clipping his bus tickets to his expenses claims. (At that time ICI directors were not supplied with company cars.) Coates, a keen golfer, retired from his home in London to Eastbourne, where he lived at the Burlington Hotel. He died at the Esperance Nursing Home, Hartington Place, Eastbourne, on 7 February 1963.<br>
