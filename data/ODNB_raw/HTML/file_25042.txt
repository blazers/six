<span class="headword">Seagrave <span class="st"> [Segrave]</span>,  Stephen</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1333), <span class="occ">archbishop of Armagh</span>, was a member of the important Leicestershire house of Seagrave. He studied at Cambridge, became doctor in canon law before 1306, and served as chancellor of the university between 1303 and 1306. In this capacity he witnessed in Bordeaux on 17 June 1306 the settlement of the statute controversy between the university and the friars. From May 1296 he was rector of Aylestone, near Leicester, within the sphere of the family interest, and from 1300 to 1318 he was rector of Stowe, Northamptonshire, the chief seat of his kinsman <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25040/', "Nicholas Seagrave (d. 1321)")</script>, whose son Gilbert had preceded Seagrave as chancellor of the University of Cambridge <i>c</i>.1292&#150;1293.<br>
<br>The position of his kinsman <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25038/', "John Seagrave")</script> as warden of Scotland for Edward I and Edward II probably secured for Stephen Seagrave substantial preferment in that country, though he secured the promise rather than the enjoyment of the Scottish revenues. In August 1307 he became dean of Glasgow and in 1309 acquired a canonry in Dunkeld with prebend of Rattray. Robert Wishart, bishop of Glasgow, was one of the heads of resistance to the English. Accordingly on 10 January 1309 Edward II requested Pope Clement V and the cardinals to remove Wishart from his bishopric, and appoint Seagrave in his place, describing him as his &#145;familiar clerk, of noble birth and sound morals&#146;  (Rymer, <span class="italic">Foedera</span>, 3rd edn, 1, pt 4, 135). Seagrave did not secure the nomination to Glasgow, but on 27 December of the same year he received licence from the pope to hold two more benefices in plurality, as his present preferment had been reduced in value by reason of the war between the English and the Scots. The success of Robert I must soon have deprived Seagrave of all hope of Scottish bishoprics or deaneries. He was forced to borrow largely, owing in 1310 &pound;80 to William Upton, a London citizen, and in 1311 &pound;60 to another. On 29 January 1315 Seagrave was appointed archdeacon of Essex. He was admitted in 1315 to the living of Stepney, near London. Before 1319 he was canon of St Paul's, London, and had resigned his archdeaconry. He was involved in a controversy with Robert Baldock, bishop of London, with regard to his rights over the manor of Drayton. Before April 1318 he was also canon of Lincoln and by 5 December 1320 dean of Lichfield.<br>
<br>On 16 March 1323 Seagrave was provided by Pope John XXII to the archbishopric of Armagh, vacant since the resignation of the non-resident Roland Jorz, who had been suspended for various offences. His consecration was postponed by the pope for a year. On 31 July 1323 the temporalities were restored. On 28 April 1324 he was ordered by the pope to leave Avignon, and devote himself to his diocese. He had already been consecrated bishop by Raynaldus (Reginaldus) de Porta, cardinal-bishop of Ostia. Previously there had been a rumour in England that Seagrave had resigned his archbishopric to the pope, retaining only the honour of the bishop's office, without its duties or emoluments. On 25 June 1325 he informed the pope from Armagh that he and his suffragan bishops had promulgated the papal condemnation of the excommunicate king of the Romans, Ludwig of Bavaria, in both the English and Irish languages. In July 1328 Seagrave went to the papal curia, with a commendation from Edward II to the pope and permission to cross the sea from Dover with his horses and equipment. On 15 October 1330 he received permission from the pope to hold as a non-resident benefices worth &pound;100 a year. He appears to have made little impact in Ireland, though a number of letters printed by Theiner (<span class="italic">Vetera monumenta</span>) reflect papal recognition of his authority beyond the boundaries of the ecclesiastical province of Armagh. Seagrave died in England on 27 October 1333.<br>
