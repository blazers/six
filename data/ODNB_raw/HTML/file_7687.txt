<span class="headword">Disney, Sir  Moore</span>  (1765/6&#150;1846), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, eldest son of Moore Disney of Churchtown, co. Waterford, one of the Irish descendants of the family of Disney of Norton Disney in Northamptonshire, entered the army as an ensign in the 1st Grenadier guards on 17 April 1783. He served in America for the last few months of the American War of Independence, and was promoted lieutenant and captain on 3 June 1791. He was with the guards throughout the campaign in the Netherlands under the duke of York from 1793 to May 1795, and was promoted captain and lieutenant-colonel on 12 June 1795. He was promoted colonel on 29 April 1802, and served for a short time as a brigadier-general in the home district in 1805, but he resigned that appointment in July 1806, in order to go to Sicily in command of the 3rd battalion of the 1st guards.<br>
<br>Disney was made a brigadier-general in Sicily in August 1807, and was commandant of Messina from January to July 1808, when he started home to take command of a brigade in England. On 6 October, however, his ship touched at Lisbon, and he was at once begged by General Cradock to land and take command of a brigade consisting of the 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 50th regiments, which Cradock wished to send to join the army of Sir John Moore in Spain. Disney led the brigade safely through Abrantes before halting at Castelo Branco on 27 November, when he was ordered to hand over command to Major-General Alan Cameron, and to join the main army under Sir John Moore.<br>
<br>Disney reached Toro in safety, and was at once put in command of a brigade of Edward Paget's reserve, consisting of the 28th and 91st regiments. The reserve had to cover the famous retreat of Sir John Moore, and Disney greatly distinguished himself both at the action at Betanzos on 11 January 1809, and in the battle of Corunna. For his services at that battle he received a gold medal, and was promoted major-general on 25 April. Later in 1809 he commanded the 1st brigade of guards, attached to Hope's division, in the Walcheren expedition, and on his return to England was given the command of the home district.<br>
<br>In 1810 Disney went to Cadiz to act as second in command to General Graham (afterwards Lord Lynedoch), and in June 1811 he succeeded him in the chief command there. He handed over the command at Cadiz to Major-General George Cooke in November 1811, returned to England, and never again went on active service. He was promoted lieutenant-general on 4 June 1814, became colonel of the 15th regiment on 23 July 1814, was made a KCB in 1815, and was promoted general on 10 January 1837.<br>
<br>Disney had married Mary (<i>d</i>. 26 Jan 1831), widow of Ralph Sneyd of Belmont, and daughter of George Cooke Yarborough of Streetthorpe, Yorkshire. He died at his house in Upper Brook Street, London, on 19 April 1846, at the age of eighty.<br>
