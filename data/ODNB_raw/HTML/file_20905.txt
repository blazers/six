<span class="headword">Osric</span>  (<em>d.</em> 634), <span class="occ">king of Deira</span>, was the son of &AElig;lfric and cousin to his predecessor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8567/', "Eadwine")</script>, who had ruled the whole kingdom of Northumbria. Osric became king of Deira, the southern part of Northumbria, in 633. As a member of the Deiran royal family he had been baptized by Paulinus <i>c</i>.627 during the first attempt to convert Northumbria by Italian missionaries based in Kent; he later renounced Christianity. Under Eadwine the kingdom had expanded, but Eadwine was slain in battle against an alliance of British and Mercian forces in October 633 and Northumbria split back into its constituent parts of Deira and Bernicia. Since Eadwine's sons had been killed, expelled, or captured, Osric took control of Deira, the southern part, but the northern area went to a member of the Bernician dynasty who had been exiled during Eadwine's reign. This king, Eanfrith, was also a recent convert, but he had been baptized by the Irish church. Northumbria was therefore split between two rivals, both now supposedly Christian, yet remained under attack by the British and Mercian alliance that had destroyed Eadwine, the first Christian king. As a result both Osric and Eanfrith apostatized. Loyalty to the ruler appears to have been the initial impetus behind acceptance of Christianity by the pagan Anglo-Saxon aristocracy and people, rather than a change of faith. On this occasion the perception of the ruler's access to divine favour and of whether Christianity offered more certain rewards than paganism probably proved less powerful than the fear of retribution for abandoning ancestral ties with the old gods. Bede, however, described the kings' apostasy as a betrayal of the faith of their people.<br>
<br>Osric was killed by the British king Cadwallon, himself a Christian, in the following summer, 634, after laying siege to his army in a fortified town; despite earlier claims, it has been shown that this is unlikely to have been York. As a result of their apostasy, Osric and Eanfrith, who was killed in the same year, were subsequently excluded from the Northumbrian king-lists and their regnal year assigned to Oswald (<i>d</i>. 642), their Christian successor, even though Osric's son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20927/', "Oswine (d. 651)")</script>, a model of Christian humility, later became king in Deira and Eanfrith was Oswald's brother.<br>
