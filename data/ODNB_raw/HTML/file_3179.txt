<span class="headword">Bradford, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1777&#150;1853), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, the eldest son of Thomas Bradford of Woodlands, near Doncaster, and Ashdown Park, Sussex, and his wife, daughter of William Otter, of Welham, Nottinghamshire, was born on 1 December 1777. He entered the army as ensign in the 4th regiment on 20 October 1793. In 1795 he was promoted major into the Nottinghamshire fencibles, at that time stationed in Ireland. He served with the forces opposing the 1798 Irish uprising, and in 1801 was promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel and appointed assistant adjutant-general in Scotland. He was summoned to the colours as a major in 1805, and served with Auchmuty as deputy adjutant-general in 1806 in the expedition to South America.<br>
<br>In June 1808 Bradford accompanied the force under Sir Arthur Wellesley to Portugal, and was present at the battles of Vimeiro and Corunna. On his return to England he became assistant adjutant-general at Canterbury, and lieutenant-colonel in succession of the 34th and 82nd regiments in 1809. In 1810 he was promoted colonel, and took command of a brigade in the Portuguese army. In this capacity he proved most successful and, during the attack on the Arapiles in the battle of Salamanca especially, directed his brigade with distinction. In 1813 he was promoted major-general and made a <i>mariscal de campo</i> in the Portuguese service; he was then put in charge of a Portuguese division, which he commanded at Vitoria, the siege of San Sebastian, and in the battle of the Nive. In the fighting before Bayonne he was so severely wounded that he had to return to England.<br>
<br>In 1814 Bradford was placed on the staff of the northern district, and in January 1815 made KCB; he was also awarded the Portuguese order of the Tower and Sword. He missed the battle of Waterloo, at which his younger brother, Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Henry Holles Bradford KCB, who had also been a staff officer in the Peninsula, was killed. He commanded the 7th division of the army of occupation in France from 1815 to 1817, and the forces in Scotland from 1819 until he was promoted lieutenant-general in May 1825. He then became commander-in-chief of the troops in the Bombay presidency, a post he retained for four years. He was colonel, 94th regiment, in 1823&#150;9, and, on returning to England in 1829, became colonel, 30th regiment. In 1831 he was made GCH and in 1838 GCB. In November 1841 he was promoted general, and in 1846 exchanged the colonelcy of the 30th for that of the 4th regiment. Bradford was twice married. He and his first wife had two sons and three daughters who survived infancy. His second wife was the widow of Lieutenant-Colonel Philip Ainslie; they also had children. Bradford died at 13 Eaton Square, London, on 28 November 1853.<br>
