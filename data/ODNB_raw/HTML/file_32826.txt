</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dill, Sir  John Greer</span>  (1881&#150;1944), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 25 December 1881 at Lurgan, co. Armagh, the second child of John Dill (<i>d</i>. 1894), bank manager, and his wife, Jane Greer (<i>d</i>. 1894), daughter of a prominent Lurgan JP. The perfect English gentleman was, like so many successful soldiers, an Ulsterman. &#145;In my youth&#146;, he recalled half a century later for the Pennsylvania Scotch&#150;Irish Society, &#145;I have seen Orangemen on side-cars driving down what they called Papish streets spoiling for a fight, and getting it&#146;  (Danchev, &#145;The early years&#146;, 28). Dill's was a lonely youth, uncomfortably foreshadowing later developments. He came from a long line of Dill worthies&#151;scholars and ministers all&#151;an oppressive inheritance. He did not make friends easily. Having been orphaned at twelve, he and his elder sister Nina (who also died prematurely, in 1921) were taken on by an aunt and uncle, Joseph Grundy Burton, a well-known campaigner against home rule, a teller of tales, and a diligent parish priest. Dr Burton and his nephew were never close, and in 1895 Dill was swiftly dispatched across the water to Cheltenham College. One Ulster friendship alone survived, transplanted to America from the dismal afternoons spent playing in Belfast's botanical gardens: that with his cousin Foster Kennedy, the future neurologist, who emigrated to New York a few years before Dill found his way to Washington, to whom he would ultimately entrust his life.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>At Cheltenham he rose laboriously from the bottom form to upper fifth military more by the effluxion of time in each form than by any sign of intellectual distinction. His science teacher followed his subsequent career with all the more interest because he found young Dill one of the slowest pupils he ever taught in the military class, no mean feat. In 1900 he passed into the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, 154th out of 210, greatly relieved to have so much to spare. At Sandhurst his conduct was exemplary, his marks uniformly mediocre. Worthiness outbid distinction.<br>
<br>In 1901 Dill was commissioned into the 1st battalion (100th foot), the Prince of Wales's Leinster regiment&#151;a Southern Irish regiment, there being no other vacancies at the time of the South African War. &#145;It was a serious thing for a Black Northerner like me to be thrown among a lot of gossoons [boys] from Kings County, but we mixed, we got to love each other&#146;  (Danchev, &#145;The early years&#146;, 28). He read Dickens and Thackeray and was periodically concerned to acquire what he euphemistically called &#145;curios&#146;, or more straightforwardly &#145;loot&#146;, but was disappointed to find nothing better than a bed, a jug, a basin, and some other items of furniture, which served to alleviate the hardships of the campaign.<h2>
<a name="Marriagesandprivatelife"></a>Marriages and private life</h2>South African War service was followed by his only period of regimental duty, as assistant adjutant and then adjutant of the 1st Leinsters, 1902&#150;9. It was during this period (in 1907) that he married Ada Maud, daughter of Colonel William Albert le Mott&eacute;e (late of 18th foot), in Fermoy, co. Cork, the bride's home town. The marriage was precipitate and unsuitable. Though an accomplished tennis player and rider, Maud was a woman of nervous disposition, painfully shy, given to headaches, depression, and excessive self-medication. She died in 1940, after a long series of paralytic strokes, while Dill was chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS). As to how deeply he was affected by all this, testimony is conflicting. Foster Kennedy &#145;never knew how close they were&#146;, but thought &#145;not very&#146;. Their son, John (1916&#150;71), who lived very much in his father's shadow, wrote ambiguously that Dill's family life &#145;was not always as happy as it could have been&#146;. Brooke, his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, ally, and successor, left a harrowing vignette of Maud's paralysis:<blockquote>Every visit home to his wife in Windsor was a desperate ordeal; she could not make herself understood, he kept guessing at what she could mean, usually unsuccessfully, and finally with a disappointed look in her eyes she used to throw her head back on the pillow. (Danchev, &#145;The early years&#146;, 33)</blockquote>Yet Dill's immediate reaction to her death betrays a certain stoicism, even relief, and he seems quickly to have recovered his equilibrium. A year later, moreover, on 8 October 1941, he married a much younger woman: Nancy Isabelle Cecil Furlong (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Charrington), daughter of a brewery magnate, and widow of a former member of Dill's staff. This time he made a very happy marriage, in more than one sense. &#145;I don't think Nancy dislikes Washington and Washington certainly likes her&#146;, he wrote with feeling in 1942. &#145;She makes a great difference to my life and keeps me young&#146;  (ibid., 34).<h2>
<a name="FirstWorldWarandStaffCollege"></a>First World War and Staff College</h2>Meanwhile another sea change had taken place. In 1913 Dill became a student at the Staff College, Camberley, under Sir William Robertson, who told the intake that they were all very lucky as they had a definite war to train for. This was the determining experience of Dill's life. It was the impress and ambience of the Staff College, coupled with the immediate praxis of the First World War, that really launched his career. A captain in 1914, by the end of the war he was a temporary brigadier, Haig's brigadier-general, general staff operations, and on the evidence of the official historian &#145;the real operations brain in GHQ&#146;  (Danchev, &#145;The early years&#146;, 35). Staff work was meat and drink to him. At the same time he began truly to master his profession. Between the wars he regularly attracted the epithet &#145;intellectual&#146;&#151;an equivocal judgement&#151;and a pattern of postings to give it currency. He preached what he practised. He was senior instructor at the Staff College (1919&#150;22), army instructor at the Imperial Defence College (IDC) (1926&#150;8), and commandant of the Staff College (1931&#150;4). These postings tended to confirm his inspiration or his insipidity, according to taste. For some there could be no argument. Colonels Auchinleck and Brooke were among the students on the inaugural course at the tri-service IDC in 1927. For Auchinleck, &#145;perhaps the most valuable and best remembered gain was the association with and the friendship of Sir John Dill, whose character, modesty and power of imparting knowledge left a lasting impression on me and, I think, on many others&#146;. For Brooke, &#145;Dill's genius shone throughout the course; with no precedent to work from he built up studies of all the important factors, and carried everyone with him owing to his unbounded enthusiasm and immense capacity for work&#146;  (ibid., 35&#150;6).<h2>
<a name="ThemythofDillsfailure"></a>The myth of Dill's failure</h2>All accounts agree on Dill's vigour and &#145;drive&#146; before the early 1930s. In the previous decade he was said to have been bitten by a mad soldier, so energetically did he work. Thereafter, however, any assessment of his achievement is bedevilled by questions about his health. He died of aplastic anaemia, the onset of which is usually insidious, the prognosis grim. The conventional wisdom tends to be retrospective: later knowledge of his anaemia is used to underpin an analysis of a decline in vigour dating from 1931&#150;2, coincident with the assumption of increasingly onerous responsibilities: director of military operations and intelligence (1934&#150;6), general officer commanding Palestine and Trans-Jordan (1936&#150;7), and general officer commanding-in-chief home command (1937&#150;9). On this analysis he had already &#145;gone off&#146;, as Liddell Hart put it, by the time he was first considered for the position of CIGS in 1937. When he was eventually appointed, in April 1940, he was in no condition to do what was both necessary and desirable; that is, stand up to Churchill at home and Hitler abroad. He is held to have been an ineffective CIGS because he allowed himself to be worn down, if not worn out, by the prime minister, who called him &#145;Dilly-Dally&#146; and framed the charge for posterity. &#145;I do not think that we are having the help from General Dill which we hoped for at the time of his appointment&#146;, complained the prime minister, eight short weeks later. &#145;He strikes me as being very tired, disheartened, and over-impressed with the might of Germany&#146;  (Danchev, &#145;Dilly-Dally&#146;, 25). Spent, Dill was expelled from the inner sanctum in 1941, at the very moment when the USA entered the war. He rose again, phoenix-like, as head of the British joint staff mission in Washington (1942&#150;4), but he was never a well man. His death in harness at the age of sixty-two was remarkable only for being so long postponed. An extraordinary public outpouring of grief in Washington found no echo in London. The equestrian statue subsequently erected in Arlington national cemetery (a unique tribute to a foreigner) has no counterpart in his own country. On a Churchillian reading Dill's American apotheosis was uncovenanted, expedient, and fundamentally mysterious.<br>
<br>In this fable of failure&#151;Dilly-Dally in decline&#151;the root cause is held to be congenital defects of character and personality, encapsulated in Lord Moran's feline observation that he lacked &#145;the he-man stuff&#146;  (Danchev, &#145;Strange case&#146;, 353) and exposed in working with Winston; personal misfortune incarnate in his invalid wife; and above all deterioration in his own health consequent on the early onset of the anaemia, exacerbated by a series of riding accidents, in 1931, 1939, and 1943. But the fable is just that. None of it will withstand close scrutiny. In his last years Dill had his own Moran, Foster Kennedy, who monitored the field marshal with cousinly thoroughness. Kennedy's evidence is unimpeachable. The anaemia did not take hold until 1944; it was detected almost immediately. The first break in his health was occasioned by the riding accident of 1943. The picture of life with Maud as a marriage of maladies has been grossly exaggerated. If Dill appeared weak or lethargic as CIGS, or even before, the explanation must be sought elsewhere&#151;often in the eye of the beholder. In Washington he was not seriously impaired until mid-1944. For Dill, D-day had a more sinister connotation. After that he never really recovered. But he did return to work, and worked on until he died, literally bone-weary.<h2>
<a name="DillandChurchill"></a>Dill and Churchill</h2>As for Dilly-Dally, he did stand up to Churchill&#151;on strategic priorities, on particular operations, on the competence of individual commanders&#151;but not on the prime minister's terms. What he failed to do was adapt to Churchill's parliamentary manners.<blockquote>The prime minister lost his temper with me. I could see the blood come up in his great neck and his eyes began to flash. He said: &#145;What you need out there [the Middle East] is a court martial and a firing squad&#146;. I should have said, whom do you want to shoot exactly; but I did not think it till afterwards. (Danchev, &#145;Dilly-Dally&#146;, 21)</blockquote>Dill was by no means inarticulate, as Wavell could be impenetrably inarticulate. Rather, it was a matter of temperament. He refused to pander. Instead he addressed to the prime minister a stream of closely argued minutes and explanatory notes. These efforts left Churchill unmoved and Dill unrequited. They were poorly calculated to achieve their purpose, not only because Churchill so rarely found a written case convincing, but also because Dill's style entirely left out of account the necessity to enthrall. As Wavell said, &#145;Winston is always expecting rabbits to come out of empty hats&#146;  (Danchev, &#145;Dilly-Dally&#146;, 27). It was not for want of comprehension on Dill's part; he understood the requirements well enough. &#145;Finest hours&#146; were beyond the army's means in 1940&#150;41; and Dill was not the man for conjuring tricks. It was his misfortune to join the chiefs of staff at a time when acquiescent colleagues, scarce resources, and impetuous ministers combined to make the cautionary advice of the CIGS at once vital and unpalatable. Caution was anathema to Churchill. In cabinet, he called Dill &#145;the dead hand of inanition&#146;  (ibid., 25). Dill did not answer back. Waltzing with Winston was not his style. He could advise others, but in more than one sense he could not help himself.<h2>
<a name="DillsachievementsasCIGS"></a>Dill's achievements as CIGS</h2>Dill's achievement as CIGS from May 1940 to December 1941 was fundamental nevertheless. It was he, above all, who responded to the imperative of the moment and established the wearying but constructive adversarial relationship between Churchill and the chiefs of staff on which Brooke built so successfully for the duration of the war. In 1940 no one knew, and many doubted, whether such a relationship could be made to work. The need and pain of definition are often forgotten. Yet the essential forerunner of the matchless combination of Churchill and Brooke was the ill-matched combination of Churchill and Dill. The prerequisite for Brooke's acceptability was Dill's purgatory. Dill accustomed Churchill to the trammelling of professional advice. &#145;I live a very hectic life&#146;, he wrote. &#145;Most of it is spent trying to prevent stupid things being done rather than in doing clever things! However, that is rather the normal life of a Chief of Staff&#146;  (Danchev, &#145;Dilly-Dally&#146;, 28&#150;9).<h2>
<a name="ApotheosisinWashington"></a>Apotheosis in Washington</h2>Dill's &#145;retirement&#146; was announced for 25 December 1941, his sixtieth birthday. Churchill intended that he become governor of Bombay, &#145;a position of great honour, followed by a bodyguard with lances&#146;  (Danchev, &#145;Dill&#146;, 52). But excommunication in Bombay was not to be Dill's fate. When the prime minister embarked post-haste for Washington to confer with the president after Pearl Harbor he felt compelled to take Dill with him. When the British contingent returned home Dill stayed on, in an unprecedented if indeterminate position of enormous influence at the epicentre of allied decision-making. He became not only head of the joint staff mission and senior British member of the combined chiefs of staff, but also, ironically, personal representative of the minister of defence, an office claimed by Winston Churchill himself. So began his life's greatest work. Dill's very presence in Washington became crucial to the operation and consolidation of an extra-special relationship. His highest service to the alliance was to contain its tremendous fissile potential. Dill is perhaps best seen as an amateur ambassador, complementing and in some measure supplanting Lord Halifax. His unarguable success in this role is the more striking for the absence of what has always been considered essential for a British ambassador in Washington&#151;the confidence of the prime minister. So far from enjoying that confidence, Dill was retired as CIGS precisely because he had forfeited it. The change wrought by his removal to the USA was that the tension became creative. To official America, to one American in particular, Dill quickly came to be seen as a guarantor: a guarantor of the British, against their notorious and incorrigible duplicities; a guarantor of Brooke, against his overbearing advocacy; a guarantor of Churchill himself, against the fatal lullaby of his imperial pretensions and eccentric strategies.<br>
<br>With General George C. Marshall, the US army chief of staff and organizer of victory, Dill discovered an empathy unparalleled in Anglo-American military relations. To this American he was <i>sans peur et sans reproche</i>. When his statue was unveiled in 1950 it was Marshall's simple eloquence which set the tone of the occasion:<blockquote>Here before us in Arlington, among our hallowed dead, lies a great hero, Field Marshal Sir John Dill. He was my friend, I am proud to say, and he was my intimate associate through most of the war years. &hellip; I have never known a man whose high character showed so clearly in the honest directness of his every action. He was an inspiration to all of us. (Danchev, <span class="italic">Very Special Relationship</span>, 1)</blockquote>Such a man was an ideal guarantor and mediator, fixer and broker, in the Anglo-American market place. Dill could be trusted: trusted to deliver. He was efficacious&#151;for Brooke and Marshall, uniquely efficacious&#151;and ambidextrous. He was able to comprehend both sides. In effect he interpreted each to the other. Hence his exhortations to mutual frankness: to reveal as much as possible of &#145;how minds are working&#146;, as he was fond of saying, in order to allay suspicion and promote understanding. &#145;Without him&#146;, ran the War Office epitaph, &#145;Britain could not have understood America so thoroughly and quickly, nor America Britain&#146;. It was Dill, in tandem with Marshall, who made the combined chiefs of staff work, in Henry Stimson's words, &#145;not as a mere collecting point for individual rivalries between services and nations, but as an executive committee for the prosecution of global war&#146;  (Danchev, <span class="italic">Very Special Relationship</span>, 133).<br>
<br>Dill, who had been made KCB in 1937 and GCB in 1942, died in the Walter Reed Hospital, Washington, DC, on 4 November 1944. Four days later a memorial service was held at Washington Cathedral. Afterwards a motorized cort&egrave;ge proceeded along a route lined by thousands of troops to Arlington national cemetery. The coffin, folded in a union jack, with an unsheathed sword and a field marshal's cocked hat on top, was transferred to a gun carriage drawn by six grey horses. The US joint chiefs of staff acted as honorary pall bearers. A simple service was held at the graveside. Salutes were fired, the last post and reveille sounded. &#145;I have never seen so many men so visibly shaken by sadness&#146;, wrote Foster Kennedy afterwards. &#145;It was a remarkable and noble affair.&#146; The joint chiefs sent as a message of condolence to their British counterparts an extraordinary tribute:<blockquote>[We] feel [we] share equally with you the loss to our combined war effort from the death of Field Marshal Sir John Dill. &hellip; We have looked to him with complete confidence as a leader in our combined deliberations. He has been a personal friend of all of us. &hellip; We mourn with you the passing of a great and wise soldier, and a great gentleman. His task in this war has been well done. (ibid., 1 and 3)</blockquote>
