<span class="headword">Knight,  Charles Parsons</span>  (<em>b. </em>1742/3, <em>d.</em> in or after 1826), <span class="occ">stipple engraver</span>, emerged as an artistic personality in the 1780s, at which time he was working for the engraver&#150;publisher William Dickinson. Nothing is known about his upbringing or training, but he may have come late to printmaking. His marriage to Catherine brought them two children: a daughter, Martha, born on 14 December 1770, who also became an engraver, and a son, Charles, who entered the Royal Academy Schools in March 1788 shortly before his seventeenth birthday, and may have been the C. Knight who exhibited four miniatures at the Royal Academy between 1793 and 1816.<br>
<br>In 1781 Knight was living in Berwick Street, Westminster, but he had moved west to Queen's Row, Brompton, by 1785 when he published on his own account two drawings by John Raphael Smith. As a book illustrator Knight produced rather indifferent prints for Edward and Sylvester Harding's <span class="italic">Shakespeare Illustrated</span> (1793) and the <span class="italic">Memoirs of Count Grammont</span> (1794), and he stippled a large number of small portraits for books and magazines as well as for separate publication. But ultimately he gained a good reputation for his numerous larger prints after contemporary artists. In the mid-1780s his name began to appear on dotted prints published by William Dickinson, notably on a series of plates after Bunbury, and between 1784 and Dickinson's bankruptcy in 1793 Knight worked chiefly but by no means exclusively for Dickinson. It is plausible that he may have been largely responsible for similar prints that appeared in the early 1780s under Dickinson's name. He is said to have been the engraver of <span class="italic">Of such is the Kingdom of God</span> (1784), the first of three prints forming a triptych after Matthew William Peters. Similarly, the fine full-length portrait of Elizabeth Farren, later countess of Derby, published under Bartolozzi's name in 1792, is said to have been largely engraved by Knight. Knight's work included a large number of separately published stipples of literary and genre scenes by such artists as Thomas Stothard, Henry Singleton, and Francis Wheatley. Among the relatively few prints that he published himself were <span class="italic">Scarcity in India</span> and <span class="italic">British Plenty</span> (1794) after Singleton. He was one of the original governors of the short-lived Society of Engravers, founded in 1803. By 1826 he was living in Hammersmith, Middlesex, where at eighty-three he published a portrait of the Revd Thomas Stephen Attwood, minister of Hammersmith. The date of his death is unknown, but it probably occurred soon afterwards.<br>
