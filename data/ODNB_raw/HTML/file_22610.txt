<span class="headword">Potter,  George</span>  (1832&#150;1893), <span class="occ">trade unionist and journalist</span>, was born in Kenilworth, Warwickshire, the son of Edmund William Potter, a carpenter, and his wife, Anne. As one of seven children, he had to leave the local endowed school after only a few years to find paid work, before following his father into the woodworking trade through an apprenticeship with a joiner in Coventry. He left for London in 1853, found well-paid employment, and in 1857 married the daughter of a Warwick shoemaker. He settled in Pimlico, and soon became a leading member of the small Progressive Society of Carpenters and Joiners which met at the Rose and Crown in Tottenham Court Road. While serving as this society's chairman, Potter helped to initiate a movement for the nine-hour day among the London building trades, and became its chief spokesman during the widely publicized lock-out which followed in the winter of 1859&#150;60, ending in an honourable compromise. The combination of an intellectual appearance and restrained oratory with militant views and effective actions made Potter an instant celebrity and allowed him to launch a national trade union newspaper, <span class="italic">The Bee-Hive</span>, which from 1861 to 1878 provided him with an unusually prominent platform.<br>
<br>At first <span class="italic">The Bee-Hive</span> served as the organ of the London Trades Council, but in the mid-1860s Potter's principle of supporting local strikes brought him into increasing conflict with the more strategic approach of the leaders of the new amalgamated craft societies, who emphasized instead national discipline and a more responsible public image. This difference of opinion raised the question of Potter's claim to leadership as he was no longer an elected union official and, following a particularly serious disagreement over the conduct of a Staffordshire ironworkers' strike in 1865, the London Trades Council announced that <span class="italic">The Bee-Hive</span> no longer represented its views. Potter responded by setting up the London Working Men's Association in 1866, mainly to give <span class="italic">The Bee-Hive</span> the appearance of representing a significant organization though it did receive some support from among the smaller craft societies. Paradoxically this widening of ambition from largely industrial matters to wider political questions began to blur the distinction between the rival groups of leaders. For example, it was Potter who initiated the unification of franchise campaigners into the Reform League, even though it soon became dominated by the London Trades Council leaders. Similarly, it was Potter who effectively secured the appointment of a commissioner friendly to the unions on the 1867 royal commission on trade unions, even though his own appearances before it were soon overshadowed by the more carefully planned presentations of the secretaries of the amalgamated societies.<br>
<br>Later historians looking for an alternative to the new style of responsible leadership in the middle of the nineteenth century were therefore misguided in elevating Potter to that position. First he did not represent any permanently organized body of workers, and second his policies were not in general very unusual: the conflicts were ones of personal ambition within a movement going in a broadly agreed direction. Indeed, realizing that his own bid for leadership had failed, Potter soon moved towards an accommodation with the mainstream, through co-operation with the radical manufacturer Samuel Morley and participation in the campaigns of the Reform League and the middle-class Reform Union. This paved the way for an explicit reconciliation during and after the general election of 1868 when Potter supported Gladstonian Liberalism, allowed the London Working Men's Association to lapse, and re-established <span class="italic">The Bee-Hive</span> as the organ of the Labour Representation League and the parliamentary committee of the TUC: the one substantial shift in position being the abandonment of support for local strikes in favour of the strategy of the leaders of the amalgamated societies.<br>
<br>This turned <span class="italic">The Bee-Hive</span> into an important national forum, drawing established labour leaders and middle-class sympathizers into debates characterized by a high level of intellectual argument, with an unprecedented influence on the educated working men of the day. Potter himself took his place within the official leadership of the movement, as president of the TUC in 1871 and chairman of its parliamentary committee for the following year, and as one of the group of Labour candidates in the 1874 general election, in which he was unsuccessful. However he was elected to the Westminster school board on his second attempt in 1873, having declared himself a Congregationalist, and held his seat until 1882 promoting nonconformist educational policies. After <span class="italic">The Bee-Hive</span> (by then named the <span class="italic">Industrial Review</span>) was forced to close in 1878 he devoted himself to commercial publishing and ceased to play a prominent role in national labour politics, such appearances as he did make, for example as a candidate for Preston in the 1886 election, being as an official Gladstonian Liberal.<br>
<br>Potter played an important role as a newspaper proprietor and editor in the trade union cause, and thus left an invaluable legacy for later historians. He was a thin, pale, intense-looking man, able to speak and write forcefully but without any great intellectual originality. After the death of his wife in 1886, he moved to live with his married daughter in Clapham, where he died at home, at 21 Marney Road, Lavender Hill, on 3 June 1893.<br>
