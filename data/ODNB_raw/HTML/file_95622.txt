<span class="headword">Attenborough,  Frederick Levi</span>  (1887&#150;1973), <span class="occ">historian and college administrator</span>, was born on 4 April 1887 at Stapleford, Nottinghamshire, the son of Frederick Augustus Attenborough, a baker and grocer, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Saxton. His parents were devout Methodists. He was educated at the county school at Long Eaton, Nottinghamshire, under whose enlightened headmaster, Samuel Clegg, he became a pupil teacher. Intelligent and ambitious, he entered the Normal College at Bangor, where he soon discovered that he knew more of English literature than his preceptors. He taught briefly in Liverpool before returning to Long Eaton (where the future botanist Harry Godwin was among his pupils). He was a promising footballer, playing for the Corinthian Casuals, but a badly set broken leg left him with a permanent limp, and unfit for military service in 1914. He was a successful and popular teacher, but he wished to take a degree, and with Clegg's encouragement he matriculated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, graduating in 1918 with first-class honours in modern and medieval languages. H. M. Chadwick, professor of Anglo-Saxon, accepted him as a research student, and in 1920 he was elected to a fellowship at Emmanuel. On 23 March 1922, at Westbourne Park Baptist Chapel, London, he married Samuel Clegg's daughter Mary (1897&#150;1961), a strong partner in all his work. They had three sons, Richard (1923&#150;2014, later Baron Attenborough, film producer and director), David (<i>b</i>. 1926, later Sir David Attenborough, naturalist and broadcaster), and John (<i>b</i>. 1928, motor industry executive).<br>
<br>Attenborough enjoyed his life in Cambridge: his own studies had issued in <span class="italic">The Laws of the Earliest English Kings</span>, published in 1922 and still in print eighty years later, and he was an enthusiastic and effective tutor. The study of English literature, however, had in 1919 won a tripos of its own; linguistic and historical studies such as Chadwick had excelled in were increasingly criticized; and the rise of the movement known as the new criticism may have suggested that Attenborough might find himself no happier, though for different reasons, than he had been in Bangor. In 1925 the principalship of Borough Road College, Isleworth, a teacher training college, fell vacant, and Attenborough successfully applied for the post. The college, which had moved from Southwark to Isleworth in 1908, was one of the best-known and most reputable colleges for training teachers, and had survived the strains of the war, though like many colleges it was in financial difficulties. Next to survival, its objects in 1925 were to secure and maintain financial stability, to improve conditions for its staff and students, to provide degree courses for students who would be equipped to teach in secondary schools instead of the elementary schools of the old dispensation, and to secure the establishment of university delegacies to direct and extend the new courses. That was all congenial work for Attenborough, and he made good progress with it in the years that he spent at Isleworth, though he had insufficient time to improve student accommodation and humanize student life, tasks that fell to his successor.<br>
<br>In 1931 another opportunity presented itself irresistibly to Attenborough, and he applied for, and was appointed to, the post of principal of the University College of Leicester, taking up the post on 1 January 1932. Leicester was if anything a more difficult case than Borough Road. Housed in the former Leicestershire and Rutland Lunatic Asylum, it had been founded on local initiative as a war memorial, opened in 1921, and kept in being from year to year by expedients. From a handful of such economical subjects as English and Latin, both taught in the first years by the principal, R. F. Rattray, and biology, as a science demanding a minimal investment in laboratory space and equipment, it had contrived to add chemistry and other subjects. Nevertheless, student numbers remained small, its finances were precarious, and internal conflicts had led to Rattray's resignation. On the eve of the depression in the early 1930s it demanded energy and faith of those who would nurse it to the status of a university, which had been its goal from the beginning.<br>
<br>Attenborough brought to his new post &#145;two of the qualities that at that stage it needed most: steady enthusiasm and patience in adversity&#146;  (Simmons, 159). Despite the onset of the economic depression he was remarkably successful in attracting bequests, donations, and grants from the local authority, enabling the college to expand its accommodation, library, laboratories, and student numbers. He also strengthened the college's social life by creating a new staff common room, instituting an annual dance at a local hotel, and holding regular musical recitals. During the Second World War conscription severely disrupted the college's normal courses, but Attenborough was able to welcome the evacuated King's College of Household and Social Science, and to run officers' courses on radio maintenance for the government. He also worked hard to secure support from the University Grants Committee, an endeavour that bore fruit in 1945, towards the end of the war, when the committee agreed to recommend the college for a Treasury grant. With the return of peace he oversaw a &#145;violent expansion&#146; of the college  (ibid., 157), acquiring new halls of residence, sports grounds, and land for further expansion, introducing new subjects (including social work and education), creating professorships from 1946 onwards, and securing a royal charter in 1950. The net result was a rapid increase in full-time student numbers, from 109 in 1945&#150;6 to 730 in 1950&#150;51. When he retired, in ill health, in 1951 Attenborough left the college &#145;immeasurably stronger and sounder than the College he had found in 1932&#146;  (ibid., 159). Under his successor, C. H. Wilson, the long-cherished goal of university status was finally achieved in 1957.<br>
<br>Of firm left-wing views, Attenborough was active in arranging accommodation and employment for refugees from the Spanish Civil War and from Nazism; during the Second World War he and his wife provided a home for two German Jewish girls. He, like his wife, was musical, and had a highly developed aesthetic sense. On one occasion a brick was thrown through his window by a local man enraged that the purchasing committee of Leicester Art Gallery (of which he was chairman) had spent &pound;400 on a Sisley. His main recreation was photography, and he provided the photographs for Nikolaus Pevsner's <span class="italic">The Leaves of Southwell</span> (1945) and for W. G. Hoskins's <span class="italic">The Heritage of Leicestershire</span> (1946) and <span class="italic">Midland England</span> (1949). (He and Hoskins were close friends, having undertaken excursions together by car in Leicestershire and the east midlands from the late 1930s, and in 1948 he set up the first department of local history in an English university, with Hoskins as reader.) Balding from an early age, and of neat appearance, he had a great sense of humour, and, as Bryan Forbes recalled, &#145;scattered new ideas with the same recklessness as he smoked his pipe, and his listeners were scorched by both&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 28 March 1973). On his retirement he and his wife moved to Four Elms, Cockrow Hill, Thames Ditton, Surrey, where he enjoyed gardening, but following her death in a car accident in 1961 he moved to Richmond, Surrey, where all three sons lived, staying with each of them in turn for two months at a time. In 1970 the University of Leicester honoured him by naming a new eighteen-storey tower block, designed by Arup Associates and housing the faculties of arts and social sciences, the Attenborough Building. He died on 20 March 1973 at Putney Hospital, London, of bronchopneumonia following a stroke, and was cremated, according to his wishes. He was survived by all three sons.<br>
