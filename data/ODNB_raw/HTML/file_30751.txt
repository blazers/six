<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Adams, Sir  Walter</span>  (1906&#150;1975), <span class="occ">university administrator</span>, was born on 16 December 1906 at Brighton, the son of Walter Adams, a builder's clerk, and his wife, Margaret Evans. He was educated at Brighton, Hove, and Sussex grammar school and at University College, London, where he read history, being awarded the BA degree with first-class honours in 1928, and where he was subsequently appointed to a lectureship in history. He married in 1933 Tatiana (<i>d</i>. October 1975), daughter of Alexander Makaroff, lawyer; they had three sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>In 1933 Adams resigned his lectureship in order to become general secretary of the Academic Assistance Council (later the Society for the Protection of Science and Learning), a body formed under the presidency of Lord Rutherford of Nelson to assist university teachers displaced on account of race, religion, or political opinion. The work gave Adams wide administrative experience as it involved the raising and administration of a fund of approximately &pound;70,000, the establishment of local committees in nearly all British universities, and the making of contracts with government departments, national and international educational organizations, and universities all over the world, in order to help academic refugees to find posts. In this he was notably successful, and many refugee scholars later expressed their personal gratitude to him for his sympathy and practical help. In 1937&#150;8 he served as secretary to a survey of the refugee question undertaken under the auspices of the Royal Institute of International Affairs and the Rockefeller Foundation.<br>
<br>In 1938 Adams was appointed secretary of the London School of Economics (LSE) and after the outbreak of war had to cope with the problems of evacuating the school to Cambridge. In 1941 he was granted leave of absence to take up an appointment with the political intelligence department of the Foreign Office. From 1942 to 1944 he was in America as deputy head of the British Political Warfare Mission to the United States. In 1945 he returned to London as assistant deputy director-general of the political intelligence department, a post which he gave up the following year; he devoted the rest of his career to university administration.<br>
<br>In 1946 Adams became the secretary of the newly formed Inter-University Council for Higher Education Overseas, and he was involved in the foundation of universities and university colleges throughout the British Commonwealth. This experience led naturally to his appointment in 1955 as principal of the newly established University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. This was to prove the most taxing assignment of his career, as the running of a multiracial university in Rhodesia in the 1960s became increasingly difficult, especially after the unilateral declaration of Rhodesian independence in 1965. Adams was caught between the desire to maintain the college as a multiracial institution and his belief that it was essential to maintain academic standards, even if this meant fewer black students. At the same time, he believed that the future of the college depended on remaining on good terms with the Rhodesian government. As a result he was criticized both by those who accused him of discriminating against black students and compromising with the government and by those who were against any kind of multiracial education at all.<br>
<br>Adams was always a man who preferred compromise to confrontation and it was unfortunate for him that, when he left Rhodesia on appointment as director of the LSE in 1967, he was faced with some hostility among a section of the LSE students on account of his position in Rhodesia. This added to the student unrest characteristic of universities all over the world in 1967&#150;9. Adams showed considerable dignity in the face of personal attacks and uninformed criticism and was also supported by the sympathy of several of the refugee scholars whom he had helped thirty years earlier and who were outraged at the suggestion that he was in any sense a racist. These disturbances, which were on a very small scale compared with those in many universities in Europe and the USA, soon died down, and Adams was able to resume the task for which he was most suited, of being an efficient and humane administrator, dedicated to scholarly values and academic independence.<br>
<br>Adams published in collaboration with H. W. Robinson a scholarly edition of <span class="italic">The Diary of Robert Hooke, 1672&#150;80</span> (1935). He was appointed OBE in 1945 and CMG in 1952, and was knighted in 1970. He retired in 1974 and died suddenly on 21 May 1975 while on a visit to Salisbury, Rhodesia, where he had gone to receive an honorary doctorate from the university of which he had once been head. He also had honorary degrees from Malta and Melbourne.<br>
