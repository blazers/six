<span class="headword">Cook,  Samuel</span>  (1806&#150;1859), <span class="occ">watercolour painter</span>, was born at Camelford in Cornwall. His mother kept a bakehouse, and under the same roof was a small school where Cook learned to read and write. This was, however, the extent of his formal education. At the age of nine he was apprenticed to a firm of woollen manufacturers at Camelford, where he was said to have amused himself by making chalk drawings on the workshop floor, much to the annoyance of the foreman, who disparaged his talent. He nevertheless found additional employment in sign-painting, and his work adorned public houses and other local businesses. He also painted stage scenery for itinerant showmen, and grained wood. On the termination of his apprenticeship he became assistant to a painter and glazier in Plymouth. Cook later established his own painting and glazing business in the city, but continued to devote every spare hour to sketching. His favourite locations were on the nearby quays and along the stretches of coast around Plymouth and Clovelly. Most of his works were coastal scenes, but he also executed several inland views.<br>
<br>Cook's sketches attracted the attention of local art enthusiasts, and he found generous and wealthy patrons, including the duke of Devonshire, Lady Morley, and the family of Earl Mount Edgcumbe. Encouraged by them, he sent some drawings to the committee of the New Society of Painters in Water Colours on its foundation in 1831. He applied for membership in 1843 but was rejected, though he was eventually elected an associate in 1849 and a member in 1854. He was a regular contributor to the gallery in Pall Mall until his death and also exhibited once at Suffolk Street. In 1858 his painting <span class="italic">A Fisherman's Cottage, by the Mewstone, at the Entrance to Plymouth Sound</span> was displayed at the Liverpool Society of Fine Arts.<br>
<br>Cook was always a weak colourist, and his pictures tended to be overlooked when hung next to the deeper-toned works of contemporaries. But his paintings also exhibited &#145;such quiet, simple truth, and so much real artistic feeling&#146; that he came to be highly regarded by his peers  (<span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, 23, 1861, 212). Even when his painting had attained a degree of excellence, though, he preferred not to depend solely upon his art, and because he never relinquished his trade the number of his works was relatively small. He died on 7 June 1859 at his home, North Prospect, Stoke Damerel, Devon, survived by his wife, Elizabeth.<br>
