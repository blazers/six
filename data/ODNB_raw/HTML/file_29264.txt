<span class="headword">Gwyn <span class="st"> [White]</span>,  Richard</span> <span class="st"> [St Richard Gwyn]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1537&#150;1584), <span class="occ">martyr and Welsh-language poet</span>, is said in two contemporary accounts of his martyrdom to have been born in Llanidloes, Montgomeryshire, with the surname Gwyn. Knowledge of his life is almost entirely derived from these two accounts&#151;the Holywell MS and <span class="italic">Concertatio ecclesiae catholicae in Anglia</span> (2nd edn, 1588)&#151;and from the records of his imprisonment and trial.<br>
<br>Richard Gwyn was aged twenty &#145;before he did frame his mind to like of good letters&#146;  (Holywell MS). He went to Oxford, briefly, and then to Cambridge, where, at St John's, he lived by the charity of the college, and chiefly of Dr Bullock, the master. At university he came to be known as White (the English for Gwyn). Dr Bullock refused to take the oath of supremacy in 1558 and went into exile. Gwyn returned to Wales, evidently about 1562, to Maelor, where he served as a schoolteacher for sixteen years, mainly in Overton and Wrexham. Referring to this period, the Holywell MS says that he was &#145;of the people generally loved for his diligence in teaching and other good partes known to be in him&#146;, and that &#145;he soe profited by his own private study of good literature, that it was wonder to them that knew him before to see in the man soe great ripeness from soe late a beginning&#146;, but &#145;in his latter time he gave his time wholly to the study of divinity&#146;. He married &#145;a young girl&#146; of Overton, called Catherine. At the time of his death three of their six children survived (one son, William, sought admission to Douai College in 1598).<br>
<br>About 1578, persecuted for his recusancy, Gwyn was forced to go into hiding. In 1580 he was captured. The last four years of his life were spent as a prisoner, though in the summer of 1584 he was at times allowed extraordinary liberties by an indulgent gaoler who later was obliged to be his executioner. His court appearances and his trial are well documented in the records of great sessions in Wales and in the two accounts of his martyrdom as, in the latter, are his torture and the wit he displayed in court. At the autumn sessions at Wrexham in 1584 he was found guilty of high treason by a jury <i>tales de circumstantibus</i>, and there on 15 October he was hanged, drawn, and quartered.<br>
<br>Richard Gwyn's poetry was the fruit of his religious conviction. A series of five <i>carolau</i> (poems in a simple, popular metre, meant to be sung) is his best-known work. The &#145;carols&#146; survive in a dozen manuscripts, and there is evidence that a copy of a printed text (dated 1600, no doubt the product of an illicit press) survived until about 1720, though no copy is now known. Much of the exhortation in the five carols, and their plain language and strength of metaphor sounding a new note in Welsh poetry, might be paralleled two decades later in the similar poems of Gwyn's puritan counterpart, Rhys Prichard; but in each of the carols Catholic doctrine also emerges, sometimes forcibly. The carols probably date from Gwyn's last years: the third, which echoes Robert Parsons's <span class="italic">A Brief Discours</span>, cannot be earlier than 1580, while the last two date from his time of imprisonment. Also attributed to Gwyn in one of the two manuscripts in which it survives is a <i>cywydd</i> rejoicing in the murder of William the Silent in 1584; this attribution has been questioned. Richard Gwyn was beatified in 1929 and canonized in 1970, the &#145;protomartyr of Wales&#146;.<br>
