<span class="headword">Cheyne,  Thomas Kelly</span>  (1841&#150;1915), <span class="occ">biblical scholar</span>, was born on 18 September 1841 in London, the youngest son of the Revd Charles Cheyne (<i>d</i>. 1867), second master at Christ's Hospital, and his wife, Sarah Anne, whose father was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13795/', "Thomas Hartwell Horne")</script>, editor of the popular <span class="italic">Introduction to the Critical Study and Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures</span>. Cheyne was educated at the Merchant Taylors' School, London, and then at Oxford University, where he was at Magdalen College, briefly, before taking up a scholarship at Worcester College. On the grounds not only of poor health but also because of his unusual talents in fields outside the regular honours schools, he took only a pass degree in 1862. Subsequently he was awarded numerous distinctions, including the chancellor's English essay prize, the Ellerton theological essay prize, and the Kennicott Hebrew scholarship. He then spent time in Germany at the University of G&ouml;ttingen, where he studied under Heinrich Ewald, the critical <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> scholar, whose influence is evident in Cheyne's early work, <span class="italic">The Book of Isaiah Chronologically Arranged</span> (1870). After his return to Oxford, Cheyne became vice-principal of St Edmund Hall, and in 1865 he took priest's orders. In 1868 a Semitic fellowship was established for him, by Balliol College, based on his knowledge of Semitic philology and biblical criticism. This made Cheyne the first in Oxford to teach the methodology of biblical and textual criticism. He remained in the post until 1882. He was rector of Tendring in Essex from 1880 until 1885. In 1884 he joined the Old Testament Revision Company. From 1885 until 1908 he was the Oriel professor of the interpretation of holy scripture, and canon of Rochester.<br>
<br>Cheyne's special knowledge of continental critical scholarship and literature was recognized early in his career when, at the age of twenty-eight, he took charge of the theological department of <span class="italic">The Academy</span>, then newly founded, to which he himself would contribute many reviews of both British and continental works. Further, in conjunction with the <span class="roman">Theological Translation Fund Library</span>, he encouraged the translation of noted German critical works. It is evident from his writings in <span class="italic">The Academy</span> that by 1871 Cheyne had accepted the hypothesis of K. H. Graf that the <i>Grundschrift</i> (later known as the priestly code) was post-exilic in origin. In this Cheyne was probably the first British scholar to accept the hypothesis. In 1877, while Hebrew lecturer (from 1870 until 1882), Cheyne proposed that there be a second chair of Hebrew, one untrammelled by the strictures of the Anglican church, whose occupant would thus be able to teach a purely historico-critical interpretation of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>. This was consistent with his academic principle, evidenced in his <span class="italic">Book of Isaiah</span> (1870), that &#145;a priori canons of a theological or a philosophical nature&#146; should be kept apart from questions of philology  (Introduction, xvii).<br>
<br>However, after 1880 Cheyne's stance became more evangelical, and for a while it was possible for scholars to describe him as an &#145;orthodox&#146; exponent of the historical school, in marked contrast to later perceptions of his work. His books, especially on the prophets, were initially recognized not only in Britain but also in Germany for their contribution to textual and exegetical scholarship, notably <span class="italic">The Prophecies of Isaiah: a New Translation</span> (2 vols., 1880&#150;81; <span class="roman">Isaiah</span> was always of literary interest to Cheyne); <span class="italic">The Book of Psalms</span> (1888); <span class="italic">The Origin and Religious Content of the Psalter</span> (1891), in which he placed all the psalms except one in the post-exilic period; and his work on the Wisdom literature, <span class="italic">Job and Solomon</span> (1887), to cite but a few from his impressive output. In 1884 Cheyne was awarded an honorary DD by Edinburgh University. He spent from November 1897 until January 1898 in the United States lecturing on Jewish religious life in the post-exilic period.<br>
<br>Although Cheyne's earlier work had evinced some sensitivity towards the concerns of traditional biblical scholars, this disappeared with his growing conviction, advanced in <span class="italic">Aids to the Devout Study of Criticism</span> (1892), that historical criticism enhanced rather than impeded faith. He clearly enjoyed controversy, referring, for example, to the &#145;exciting battles of <span class="roman">Pentateuch</span>-criticism&#146;  (Preface, <span class="italic">Job and Solomon</span>, viii). Contemporary church scholars believed that his reckless attitude could hinder the acceptance of biblical critical scholarship in Britain. His position was challenged by Gladstone in 1891, and the people of Rochester publicly demonstrated their hostility towards their canon's &#145;blasphemy&#146;.<br>
<br>Cheyne's belief in the superiority of the critical approach is most evident in his work <span class="italic">Founders of Old Testament Criticism</span> (1893), written in response to the controversy caused by the British translation of Julius Wellhausen's <span class="italic">Prolegomena to the History of Ancient Israel</span> (1885), in which the traditional view of Israel's history was challenged definitively. In <span class="italic">Founders</span> Cheyne chronicled the history of the rise of the critical method. Drawing on his own meticulous research he described the work of both German and British scholars. While the book was clearly meant as an apologia for the critical approach, <span class="italic">Founders</span> has endured as a valuable reference work.<br>
<br>As Cheyne's literary career continued, his own historico-critical views became more extreme. He edited, with J. S. Black, the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia biblica</span> (4 vols., 1899&#150;1903) which he described as &#145;a brave forward movement in the critical study of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Critica biblica</span>, 1903, 2). Contributing many articles, he first delineated the tenuous north Arabian theory of H. Winckler that &#145;Mizraim&#146; often refers not to Egypt but to a north Arabian kingdom, Musri. Cheyne became convinced that this theory was correct, and he began to ascribe to north Arabia a radical part in Israel's history. The substantiation at textual level of this hypothesis increasingly dominated his work and publications, for example in <span class="italic">Traditions and Beliefs of Ancient Israel</span> (1907) and <span class="italic">The Mines of Isaiah Explored</span> (1912). Cheyne held also that Israel's major opponents were the Jerahmeelites and, in the course of justifying this, literally &#145;Jerahmeelized&#146; the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> text  (Day, <span class="italic">Dictionary of Biblical Interpretation</span>). These obsessions, coupled with his scorn of the &#145;average opinions&#146; of biblical scholars  (<span class="italic">Critica biblica</span>, 3), and his lack of concern that they regarded him as extreme, caused him to lose the respect of many of his contemporaries. A. B. Davidson was led to write that &#145;This critic, chameleon-like, has reflected in succession critical opinions of every colour and complexion. In him there is no continuance&#146;  (Strahan, 309). Cheyne's later exegetical work was to be of value only to the specialist in Semitics. This part of his career has been described as &#145;one of the most tragic episodes in the history of scholarship&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>).<br>
<br>Cheyne was married twice, first in 1882 to Frances, third daughter of the Revd D. R. Godfrey, fellow of Queen's College, Oxford, and rector of Stow, Norfolk. She died in 1907, after which he married the poet Elizabeth Gibson (1869&#150;1931), daughter of the chemist, antiquarian, and photographer John Pattison Gibson, in 1911. Elizabeth's brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33392/', "Wilfred Wilson Gibson")</script>, achieved note as a poet. Both of Cheyne's marriages were childless. In 1883 he lost the sight of one eye.<br>
<br>In his last years Cheyne apparently embraced the Baha&#146;i faith, though he chose to remain an Anglican priest, Baha&#146;ism not opposing but subsuming Christian belief in the divinity of Jesus Christ. His last work, <span class="italic">The Reconciliation of Races and Religions</span> (1914), reflected his new beliefs. He had appealed in previous writings for a &#145;more progressive church theology&#146;  (<span class="italic">Job and Solomon</span>, 9), as a foundation for <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> scholarship, and clearly he related this also to the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, believing little of the synoptic narrative to be accurate. He died in Oxford at his home, 11 Oakthorpe Road, on 16 February 1915, having suffered from debilitating health most of his life.<br>
<br>Despite the nature of his own work in later years, Cheyne, with his contemporary S. R. Driver, set the ground in Britain for the modern critical study of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> through his application, tenacity, and breadth of knowledge. He was described in 1893, with A. B. Davidson and W. R. Smith, as &#145;being the real Bahnbrecher of our modern British <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> research&#146;  (Whitehouse, 280).<br>
