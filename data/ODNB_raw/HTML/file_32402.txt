<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Childs,  William Macbride</span>  (1869&#150;1939), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born at Carrington vicarage, Carrington, near Boston, Lincolnshire, on 3 January 1869, the only child of the Revd William Linington Childs (1821&#150;1893), vicar of Carrington, and his second wife, Henrietta Fowles Bell (1833&#150;1889), daughter of a local estate manager; there were a son and two daughters of the first marriage. He was educated from 1879 to 1887 at Portsmouth grammar school (his father then being a vicar in Portsea) and from 1887 at Keble College, Oxford, of which he was a scholar; his second class in modern history (1891) was an enduring disappointment to him.<br>
<br>In 1892 Childs became assistant private secretary to the cabinet minister Arthur Herbert Dyke Acland. He gained little from his brief dogsbodying occupation apart from the ability to mimic the rhetorical style of William Ewart Gladstone, then prime minister. A year later he accepted with some relief a lectureship in history at the university extension college in Reading, lately set up on the initiative of Christ Church, Oxford. On 8 July 1897 he married Emma Catherine (1869&#150;1960), daughter of Alfred Whiting Pollard, a corn factor. She was at that time a lecturer in biology at the college, having gained an Oxford first in natural science; she gave up an academic career of great promise to care for him and their four sons.<br>
<br>Appointed vice-principal in 1900, three years later Childs succeeded the college's first principal, Halford John Mackinder, on the latter's resignation. Early in his time there he formed the ambition eventually to turn Reading University College&#151;as it became in 1902&#151;into a university, despite its chronic shortage of finance and relative proximity to London and Oxford. To attract students from a distance it needed to be residential, and he actively promoted the setting up of hostels and, later, halls of residence. Notwithstanding his Oxford background, he did not object to vocational courses, mainly in agriculture and horticulture, provided that these were not at the expense of the arts and sciences. He was fortunate in having gifted colleagues such as William George de Burgh, tolerant of his singlemindedness which, at times, spilt over into the dictatorial.<br>
<br>As leader of this small team, Childs had an abiding sense of adventure and brought a craftsman's outlook to the task of turning this modest institution into something. From his early days in Reading he made equipment for camping expeditions&#151;his favourite method of getting away from it all&#151;and a boat for sailing. Likewise, the assembling of what later became the university out of none too pliable materials was a work of skilled craftsmanship.<br>
<br>Childs's paramount task was to extract funds, or tangible resources, out of the wealthy businessmen or landowners in the neighbourhood. Between 1904 and 1906 he obtained three essential benefactions. He induced George William Palmer, senior director of Huntley and Palmers, to give a capital sum of &pound;50,000; George William's younger brother Alfred Palmer donated the site for the college's permanent buildings; and Harriet Loyd-Lindsay, Lady Wantage, paid for a hall of residence, named Wantage Hall.<br>
<br>Once these assets had been secured, Childs and his associates in 1906 drew up a programme for working towards university status. He thus needed a substantial endowment fund, and in 1911 the two Palmer brothers and Lady Wantage jointly gave no less than &pound;200,000 to this fund, after months of delicate negotiation on his part. He later recalled the twists and turns in <span class="italic">Making a University: an Account of the University Movement at Reading</span> (1933): the engaging style and sheer brio of the narrative tend to mask the contributions of others to the success of this ambitious project.<br>
<br>After delays caused by the First World War, in 1920 Childs submitted a request for university status to the privy council, which commended achievements to date but judged that the college's funds were still inadequate. His next request, in 1925, owed its success largely to the by then well-established system of halls of residence. In 1926, when Reading University received its charter, Childs became the first vice-chancellor.<br>
<br>The next three years were not particularly fulfilling ones for Childs. Pioneering and bold improvisation had given way to consolidation. A poor committee man, he preferred to float his own ideas&#151;the fruit of long solitary thought&#151;to having to weigh up the ideas of others. He found hobnobbing with his staff difficult; he would take no notice of colleagues he passed on foot. To private remonstrances on this habit, he replied that he could not see that it made any difference whether or not he greeted them. At the age of sixty, in 1929, he unexpectedly retired.<br>
<br>Thereafter Childs read, wrote, lectured, fished, and caravanned; but above all he completed the house Grimsbury Bank, Hermitage, Berkshire, which he and his sons had built almost entirely by themselves, even down to the carved door latches. He died there on 21 June 1939 and was cremated at Reading on 26 June. In an earlier near-fatal illness, he had looked forward to another great adventure, doubtless anticipating achievements comparable with those realized during his adventures in this world.<br>
