<span class="headword">Bowles,  Edward</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1613, <em>d.</em> 1662), <span class="occ">clergyman</span>, was baptized on 8 February 1613 at Sutton, Bedfordshire, the son of Oliver Bowles (<i>d</i>. in or before 1646), clergyman, author and member of the Westminster assembly. In 1628 Bowles was admitted to St Catharine's College, Cambridge, where he studied under Richard Sibbes and Ralph Brownrigge; he graduated BA in 1633 and proceeded MA in 1636.<br>
<br>Bowles supported parliament in the civil war. At one point chaplain to the second earl of Manchester, from November 1642 to July 1643 he served in the parliamentary army as chaplain to Sir John Meldrum's regiment of foot. In <span class="italic">Plain English</span>, issued in early January 1643, he criticized parliament for its peace proposals to the king, which had caused divisions and defections and affected morale. Unbreakable guarantees were necessary before peace could be agreed. Religion was in great danger as &#145;a temporal tyranny is a great step to ecclesiastical; and especially in our Kingdom, where our religion is fenced in with positive law&#146;, while peace must provide &#145;a settlement of the power of the Kingdom, principally of the ships, forts and arms in the hands of them who are known friends of public safety or liberty&#146; but he doubted whether the king would accede to all this, for bad advisers told him &#145;there can be no new power but what is cut out of his&#146;  (pp. 4, 12&#150;13). Bowles urged the founding of an association of counties, based in the south and east, for the maintenance of religion and the army &#145;by purse and person against the opposite faction&#146;. Although this &#145;hath been more fully studied by others, than my desire of practice will for the present allow me to do&#146;, he thought an association would be &#145;a good second string in case the Parliament should unhappily miscarry&#146;  (pp. 27&#150;8). Bowles also wrote <span class="italic">A letter from a minister &hellip; to a brother &hellip; from my lord general's quarter before Reading, April 18 1643</span>, as Essex's artillery pounded the town. His next work, <span class="italic">The Mysterie of Iniquity</span> (1643), praised puritans and parliament as &#145;tenacious of just liberty and true religion&#146;  (pp. 9&#150;10) and denounced the royalist army as staffed &#145;from the barren mountains of Wales, Cornwall and the north&#146;  (p. 14), that is, &#145;the dark corners of the land &hellip; most void of the knowledge of God &hellip; by papists, prelates, courtiers, superstitious clergy-men, dissolute gentry, and a herd of prophane ignorant people&#146;  (p. 30).<br>
<br>In the spring of 1644 Bowles wrote newsletters from the Scottish army at Sunderland and gave accounts to parliament of the Scottish army and the battle of Naseby. He was twice voted &pound;100 for his services. He was paid as Sir Thomas Fairfax's chaplain from April to December 1645, writing several news reports of the western campaign of the New Model Army. By 18 January 1646, he had left for York, where he was appointed a minister, and was replaced in the army by William Dell. Bowles published <span class="italic">A Plain and Short Catechism</span>, of which the first extant edition is dated 1647, in which &#145;the doctrine of the Trinity can hardly be said to be expressly declared &hellip; whilst it is wholly free from the tremendous declarations of the confession of the Westminster assembly&#146;  (James, 118).<br>
<br>It was probably in the late 1640s that Bowles married Elizabeth (<i>bap</i>. 1619, <i>d</i>. 1662), widow of John Robinson of Deighton and daughter of Sir Thomas Hutton of Nether Poppleton; they spent most of the rest of their lives in York. Appointed by the council of state to go to Scotland on 6 February 1649, Bowles did not fulfil the commission. The following year he was one of four ministers at York Cathedral paid a total of &pound;450 out of the proceeds of the dean and chapter lands for the nine months from 25 March 1649. In 1654 Bowles was appointed an assistant to the commissioners for the ministry in the North and West ridings of Yorkshire, and was named for the East Riding on 14 January 1658. The leading presbyterian minister at York, Bowles was a very political divine and may have acted as a link between the city fathers and the government. On 29 December 1657 he wrote to Thurloe from York &#145;some account of the Christmas spirit that I perceive stirring in this and other places&#146;. One Geldart had preached that it was &#145;a schismatic who did not observe Christmas day&#146; and &#145;unless some way is found to purge cities and considerable places of such persons and practices, they will in a short time set all on fire&#146;  (Thurloe, 711). In 1660 there was &#145;a convention of twenty three ministers at Bradford in January under Bowles's leadership&#146;  (Woolrych, 506).<br>
<br>Bowles played an important role in helping to facilitate the advance into England of the forces under General George Monck. In late 1659 Monck sent his brother-in-law Thomas Clarges to &#145;concert definite plans for a rising with Fairfax, Bowles, Colonel Rossiter and other leaders of the Presbyterian gentry&#146;  (Woolrych, 487). Convinced by Clarges as to the need for working with the republicans, Bowles took Monck's message to Fairfax at Nun Appleton. It has been remarked that if Fairfax &#145;leaned on anyone it was on the minister Edward Bowles, whose judgement in counsel and negotiation he trusted far&#146;  (ibid.). He instructed Bowles to persuade the royalist Sir Philip Monckton to stay in the background; for Fairfax &#145;did presently foresee that it was more fit for me to stay with Mr Bowles in York &hellip; for some of the Army that joined with him did highly cavil at some old cavaliers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monckton Papers</span>, 30). In late December, Bowles met Fairfax's cousin Bryan Fairfax in York to hear him rehearse a message from Fairfax to Monck asking him to advance should Major-General John Lambert intervene in Yorkshire. On the day of Fairfax's final advance on the city Bowles, &#145;who had been menaced by a patrol of horse that if he stirred out of his house he should die&#146;, nevertheless went to Philip Monckton's house and requested him &#145;to send to the citizens to rise which I did&#146;  (ibid., 32). The convergence of large numbers upon the minster and two other churches hastened the peaceful surrender of York. With the city occupied by troops loyal to Fairfax, Monck crossed the Scottish border, arriving on 11 January.<br>
<br>During Monck's five-day stay at York, after a dinner with Lord Fairfax, he conferred with Bowles and then told Dr Price that &#145;Mr Bowles has pressed me very hard to stay and declare for the King, assuring me that I shall have great assistance&#146;, but denied he had made any such promise  (F. Drake, <span class="italic">Eboracum</span>, 173). According to one historian:<blockquote>It is likely enough that Fairfax urged the almost universal desire for a free parliament, and perhaps he was frank about its inevitable consequence, a return to monarchy. Price's story that Bowles pressed Monck to stay in York and declare at once for the King is not incredible. (Woolrych, 499)</blockquote>According to Baker, Monck &#145;very civilly acknowledged Mr Bowles's diligent and industrious acting in his concerns&#146;  (R. Baker, <span class="italic">A Chronicle of the Kings of England</span>, rev. edn, 1670, 594).<br>
<br>Bowles did not much profit from his services to the restored Stuarts. Excluded from the minster, he continued to preach at Allhallows, and lectured at St Peter's. In April 1661 the aldermen and other leading parishioners unsuccessfully petitioned the king for his appointment to the vicarage of Leeds. Richard Baxter thought Bowles &#145;honest and judicious&#146;, and in a letter to Clarendon refusing the bishopric of Hereford, listed him among those who should be considered for the place; Baxter also wrote that Bowles was offered but refused the deanery of York  (Keeble and Nuttall, 2.14). Edmund Calamy reported that the eminent clergymen John Tillotson and Edward Stillingfleet unsuccessfully attempted to induce Bowles to conform. The story is told that Bowles's last social call before leaving London was to his old acquaintance, Monck, now the duke of Albemarle: &#145;My Lord I have buried the good old cause, and am now going to bury myself. I never expect to see your grace more in this world.&#146; And he proceeded to berate Monck for having failed in his duty to help establish a godly commonwealth&#151;&#145;all this you have given up for a feather in your cap&#146;&#151;predicting the early failure of his line and the extinction of his title; the same day, &#145;the good man went homewards and was met at Doncaster by several of the ministers in that county&#146;  (Bradbury, appx, 33&#150;4). Calamy gives Bowles as one of the silenced ministers, but he was buried at Allhallows Pavement in York on 22 August 1662, just before the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> came into force; the funeral sermon was preached by Josiah Hunter. Bowles's wife had been buried on 20 February 1662 at Allhallows Pavement and by his will, signed from the cathedral close on 29 July 1662 and proved at York on 13 October, Bowles left substantial property to his young children Samuel, Thomas, John, Jonathan, and Mary, and to Elizabeth and Anne Robinson, daughters of his late wife by her first marriage.<br>
