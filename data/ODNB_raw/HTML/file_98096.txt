<span class="headword">Sant,  Mowbray Lees</span>  (1863&#150;1943), <span class="occ">police officer</span>, was born in London on 18 December 1863, the second but only surviving son (there were five daughters) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64291/', "James Sant (1820&#150;1916)")</script>, portrait and genre painter, and his wife, Eliza, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Thomson (1833&#150;1907). Educated at Charterhouse, he was commissioned in the 5th battalion of the Northumberland Fusiliers in 1885, and married in 1889 Annie Marguerite Alicia (1866&#150;1953), third daughter of Chesborough Macdonald of Queensland, Australia, with whom he had twin daughters. He was promoted captain in 1892 and was adjutant of the 3rd battalion of the Northumberland Fusiliers until his retirement in 1898, when he joined the reserve, and gained some police experience through working in the office of the chief constable of Northumberland.<br>
<br>In September 1899 Sant became chief constable of Surrey, having been selected from fifty-one applicants. He was only the second head of the force of about 230 men, his predecessor Captain Henry Cadogan Hastings having held the position since the establishment of the county constabulary in 1851. At the time of Sant's appointment the Surrey local authorities were receiving complaints about the &#145;undue speed&#146; and recklessness (&#145;scorching&#146;) with which motor cars were being driven through the towns and villages of a still predominantly rural county. Traversed by major routes out of London to the south coast, Surrey was particularly exposed to incursions of the capital's wealthy &#145;automobilists&#146;, exploiting the capacities of their expensive new machines. Sant's response to this novel policing problem earned him a reputation as &#145;motoring's arch-persecutor&#146;  (Barty-King, 42). In October 1899 his consultations with chief constables and police superintendents in neighbouring counties and boroughs produced a practically unanimous response in favour of additional regulation. In June 1900 he issued an order to his superintendents to tackle the problem of reckless drivers, recommending that pairs of constables monitor sections of roads where speeding would be dangerous, and to stop offenders. He urged that motor vehicles should be made identifiable by a number attached to every car (a requirement that was made law in 1903), since the worst offenders often evaded prosecution by failing to stop, or giving false names and addresses to his officers.<br>
<br>In 1901 Sant was quoted as saying that he would stop speeding motorists &#145;at any cost&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, 11 July 1901), and elsewhere stated the intention of his force to &#145;check&#146; those motor drivers &#145;who are making the highways of the county unsafe for the general body of the public&#146;  (<span class="roman">Surrey county council reports</span>, 1902, 725). Between 1904 and 1905 prosecutions in Surrey for reckless or dangerous driving, or breaking speed limits, substantially exceeded those in any other county in the United Kingdom. In November 1905 he told the royal commission on motor cars that owners of cars should be made responsible for the transgressions of their chauffeurs, and that photographs should be attached to driving licences. He defended the existing 20 m.p.h. speed limit, even though he acknowledged that on certain stretches of road 50 m.p.h. might be safe. His own experiences of inconsiderate motorists in the Guildford area&#151;whom he reckoned at a quarter of the drivers on a typical Sunday&#151;were that they failed to slow down when passing, or allow room for other road-users (he was reduced to shaking his fist at a driver who nearly forced him and a cycling companion into a ditch), and tooted persistently at anything that hindered their claim to monopolize the middle of the road. The road dust thrown up by motor vehicles obliged cottagers to keep their front windows shut, and prevented children playing outside; he also feared class antagonism, having witnessed the resentment of a group of working men pedestrians at being enveloped in a &#145;peasoup fog&#146; by a passing motorist. Critics attacked his &#145;crusade against motorists&#146;  (<span class="italic">Surrey Times</span>, 8 July 1905), and national newspapers condemned his &#145;motorphobia&#146;, but the chief constable was generally supported by the Surrey press  (Durrant, 30&#150;31).<br>
<br>Sant gained convictions by use of speed controls (or &#145;traps&#146;, as they were stigmatized) along measured quarter-mile stretches of road, with a constable at one end signalling the passing of a car, while another at the other end recorded the time on a stopwatch. Since magistrates were reluctant to convict other than on evidence from long stretches of relatively open road, this dictated the position of the speed traps, which were then criticized by motoring organizations for penalizing drivers in places where speeding presented no immediate danger. Some alleged that the heavy fines raised were a form of taxation. In correspondence with Stenson Cooke, secretary of the Automobile Association (AA), Sant justified the traps as instilling &#145;into the minds of drivers of motor-cars the feeling that at any moment they exceed the limit of speed allowed by law they may be detected and called upon to answer for it&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 5 March 1908). The practice of AA patrolmen warning their members about the location of speed controls led to a succession of roadside skirmishes between the Surrey police and the scouts. Sant regarded the AA tactics as a deliberate interference with the duties of the police. After some legal setbacks he gained his point in October 1909 when the appeal court upheld (<i>Betts v. Stevens</i>) the conviction for obstruction of an AA patrolman who had signalled to drivers of motor cars bearing the association's badge that they were approaching a police control at the top of Rodborough Hill, on the Portsmouth road near Godalming.<br>
<br>After 1910 Sant's conflict with the automobile subsided, partly because tarred roads reduced the problem of dust. He became concerned, instead, at the demands made by motor traffic on police resources. As early as 1909 he suggested the recruitment of a special staff to regulate and control cars, so that the police could concentrate on their prime duties of keeping the peace, and the prevention and detection of crime. Complaining in the 1920s that over a third of his officers might be on traffic duty at any one time, he advocated a force of road wardens under the Ministry of Transport, and won over a conference of chief constables in 1928. He acknowledged that motoring offences brought the normally law-abiding public into conflict with the police, and made them less likely to help the police in their crime detection work. This consideration may explain why his earlier battles with motorists were not mentioned in his retirement tributes or obituary; the constabulary's historian in the mid-twentieth century set them out in detail, but depicted Sant's outlook as &#145;Victorian&#146;  (Durrant, 52).<br>
<br>Sant himself regarded the First World War, when large numbers of troops were billeted in Surrey and Canadians awaiting demobilization rioted at Witley in 1919, as the most challenging period of his service. Initially slow to tackle the low pay of his men, he caused resentment by his advice to them not to use the weekly rest day introduced in 1914 improperly. After the war he encouraged sport within the force, establishing competitions for cricket and marksmanship. A stickler for smartness and drill, he nevertheless trusted his subordinates, bringing in Scotland Yard during a murder case only once, in 1906, to no effect, after which he relied on his own superintendents to investigate serious crimes. He was awarded the king's police medal in 1925, and retired in December 1930. Required as chief constable to live within two miles of the constabulary headquarters at Guildford, Sant settled at Shalford, where he died at his home, the Red House, on 14 June 1943. He was buried in Shalford cemetery.<br>
