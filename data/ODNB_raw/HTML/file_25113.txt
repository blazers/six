<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Seton,  Alexander</span>, first earl of Dunfermline  (1556&#150;1622), <span class="occ">lord chancellor of Scotland</span>, was the fourth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25121/', "George Seton, fifth Lord Seton (c.1530&#150;1586)")</script>, and Isabel Hamilton (1529&#150;1604), daughter of Sir William Hamilton of Sanquhar.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyears"></a>Early years</h2>Seton's fervently Catholic father destined him, as a younger son, for the church. Mary, queen of Scots, his godmother, gave him the temporalities of the priory of Pluscarden as a godchild's gift; he received the title of prior when aged nine. In 1571, when he was about fifteen, he became a student at the Jesuit-run German College in Rome, where he acquired an excellent classical education and an enthusiasm for books. According to his kinsman Alexander Seton, Viscount Kingston (<i>d</i>. 1691), he was &#145;a great humanist in prose and poesie, Greek and Latine; well versed in the mathematics and great skill in architecture and herauldrie&#146;  (Maitland, 63). How long he stayed in Italy is not clear, but there is no evidence that he took holy orders. From Italy he went to France, where he studied law. During his absence he was deprived of Pluscarden for failure to conform to the established protestant church.<br>
<br>By late 1580 Seton was back in Scotland, where the political climate had improved for him with the overthrow of the regime of the regent, James Douglas, fourth earl of Morton. In 1581 he recovered Pluscarden. He narrowly avoided serious trouble in 1583 when a Jesuit, William Holt, who had been staying at the family house at Seton, was seized as he was about to depart for France. Holt was carrying a letter from Seton to his old schoolmaster in Rome expressing the hope that the true faith might be restored. Seton underwent an interrogation, but avoided real unpleasantness when the ultra-protestant regime of the Ruthven raiders lost its grip on power in June 1583.<br>
<br>When James VI began his personal rule in November 1585 with the overthrow of the regime of James Stewart, fourth earl of Arran, Seton was well positioned for a political career. He had acquired legal expertise, he had supported the coalition that overthrew Arran, and he and his family had been loyal supporters of Queen Mary and had suffered for it. James always set great store by men who, like Seton, had been loyal to his mother and then transferred that loyalty to himself. So in December 1585 Seton became a privy councillor, and on 27 January 1586 an extraordinary lord of session. He served on the committee of the articles in the parliament of 1587, which enacted the legislative programme drawn up by the king and his principal adviser, Sir John Maitland, later first Lord Thirlestane, and was rewarded when the lands of Pluscarden were exempted from the <span class="roman">Act of Annexation of Kirk Lands to the Crown</span> which this parliament enacted. These lands, and those of Urquhart, were combined in a barony which he received in that year.<h2>
<a name="Religiousproblems"></a>Religious problems</h2>In February 1588 Seton had to make a personal decision of great importance. The king named him an ordinary lord of session; his colleagues were suspicious about his religious views and insisted that he commit himself to the established church by taking communion and subscribing its confession of faith. He did so, and for the rest of his life conformed outwardly to the official church; he was what the English called a church papist. This was perfectly satisfactory to the king, who, like Queen Elizabeth, was not interested in making windows into men's souls. As long as Seton conformed outwardly, James was not concerned about his private beliefs. To two Scottish Jesuits who visited him clandestinely in 1605 Seton professed his loyalty to the ancient faith, but explained that the time for an attempt to restore it had not yet come. &#145;He is now all-powerful in Scotland, but he will attempt nothing until he sees a solid foundation of hope&#146;, they concluded. &#145;Meanwhile he takes his portion in this life, though at the risk of that which is eternal&#146;  (Forbes-Leith, 187).<br>
<br>Seton's career continued to flourish despite the suspicions of the dominant presbyterian wing of the kirk, which were not allayed by his marriage in 1592, at the age of thirty-six, to Lilias Drummond (<i>d</i>. 1601), the teenaged daughter of the third Lord Drummond, an unpolitical and conformist family. In 1593 Seton became president of the court of session and chairman of a committee to manage the property of Queen Anne, James's equally young wife, whose favourite lady-in-waiting, Jean Drummond, was Lilias's sister. Anne became his patron, and in 1596, in her capacity as lady of Dunfermline, conferred on him the office of hereditary bailie and justiciar of the regality of Dunfermline, which was worth about &pound;20,000 Scots a year. Seton's committee was so successful in managing the queen's finances that in January 1596 James made it the nucleus of an eight-man group to manage the royal finances, which were in a chaotic state. The membership of this committee, dubbed the Octavians, was alarming to the kirk: they were, in the words of a contemporary, &#145;all almost either Papists known or inclining to Popery or malignancy&#146;  (Row, 163). Seton deepened the kirk's suspicions by speaking in favour of the return from exile of the Catholic George Gordon, sixth earl of Huntly. The result was a religious riot in Edinburgh in December 1596, directed principally at Seton, &#145;that Romanist president, a shaveling and a priest&#146;  (Calderwood, 5.548). The riot failed to intimidate James, but he concluded that the Octavians, particularly Seton, were more of a political liability than a fiscal asset. He in effect abolished the committee by transferring its power to its most impeccably protestant member, Lord Treasurer Blantyre.<h2>
<a name="Politicaldoldrums"></a>Political doldrums</h2>Seton did not lose the king's favour despite this set-back. On 4 March 1598 James made him a lord of parliament as Lord Fyvie, and in the same year forced his election as provost of Edinburgh, an office he held for ten years. Seton looked after the capital's interests so well that he became genuinely popular with its merchant &eacute;lite. Among other things he publicly opposed a tax the king wanted to be levied in 1600 in order to raise an army to make good by force his claim to the English throne. Seton also mended his fences with the kirk by resisting the king's demand that the court of session reverse its decision upholding the claim of the Edinburgh minister Robert Bruce, whom the king disliked, to a pension out of the revenues of the abbey of Arbroath. If James overrode the court, said Seton, he and all the other judges would resign; James backed down.<br>
<br>On 8 May 1601 Seton's young wife died, and on 27 October that year he married his stepniece Grizel Leslie, daughter of the master of Rothes, now married to Lilias's sister Catherine. The Leslies were an impeccably protestant family. Seton's remarriage made it possible for him to be appointed guardian to the future Charles I, who was born at Dunfermline on 19 November 1600; he held this position until the summer of 1604. When Grizel died on 6 September 1606 Seton married into another protestant family. His new wife, whom he married aged fifty-one on 30 November 1607, was Margaret Hay (1592&#150;1659), aged fifteen, daughter of the seventh Lord Yester, whose son and heir was to marry one of Seton's daughters from his second marriage. Seton's fence-mending succeeded. The kirk became less suspicious, as did George Nicolson, the English agent in Edinburgh, who in 1599 described Seton as an &#145;honest councillor&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1597&#150;1603</i>, 542).<br>
<br>The union of the crowns in 1603 gave Seton another chance at the real political power he wanted. He was the most highly placed man of law in the Scottish government; so in 1604 James made him the chief Scottish negotiator for the proposed Anglo-Scottish union. Seton suppressed his doubts about the union's desirability, conducted the negotiations with great skill, and made a valuable friend of the chief English commissioner, Sir Robert Cecil, the future earl of Salisbury. The union did not materialize, but Seton received his reward. On 13 December 1604 he became lord chancellor, an office he had coveted for a decade, and on 4 March 1605 earl of Dunfermline. He was now the highest-ranking official in the king's government, but real power eluded him owing to his mishandling of an act of defiance of the king on the part of a group of ministers in 1605.<br>
<br>The principal item now on James's domestic agenda was the restoration of episcopal authority in the church. Dunfermline had reservations because of his fear of the political ambitions of James's principal ecclesiastical adviser, Archbishop John Spottiswoode, who, he knew, distrusted him as a dangerous concealed papist. When in 1605 the king postponed the annual meeting of the general assembly of the church for the third year in a row, some of the ministers, who believed that the king had no legal right unilaterally to prevent the meeting, resolved none the less to convene at the scheduled time and place. Dunfermline allowed them to do so, provided that they promptly dispersed, which they did. James was very angry at what he perceived as a violation of his instructions. Six of the ministers were found guilty of treason in January 1606 by a packed jury which, even so, had to be threatened with a charge of wilful error before it would vote to convict.<br>
<br>After the trial Spottiswoode and the lord treasurer, George Home, earl of Dunbar, set out &#145;to procure the Chancellor his disgrace, as suspected to be an enemy to the estate of bishops&#146;  (Forbes, 406). The king was almost persuaded, but finally concluded that Dunfermline had acted mistakenly rather than disloyally. So Dunfermline stayed in office, but for the next five years Dunbar, not he, was James's principal adviser and agent in Scottish affairs. Dunfermline kept his position by loyally co-operating with Dunbar on a number of issues, notably the ending of free trade between England and Scotland in 1610, placing no obstacle in the way of Dunbar's high-handed reimposition of the authority of bishops in the church, and assuring the king of the wisdom of his policy and the efficiency of Dunbar in carrying it out, in a series of obsequious and flattering letters written in a prolix style, full of Latin tags and classical references, designed to appeal to his learned master. Dunbar's base was at court; in those matters with which he did not directly concern himself, highland policy for example, Dunfermline and his colleagues in Edinburgh were able to operate with considerable latitude.<h2>
<a name="Headofgovernment"></a>Head of government</h2>Dunbar's sudden death on 20 January 1611 came at precisely the right time for Dunfermline. He had carefully cultivated all the important individuals and groups in Scottish politics save the irreconcilable Spottiswoode. Paradoxically, his troubles over the abortive general assembly made the presbyterian wing of the church look more kindly on him. They disliked the archbishop even more than they did him, and after 1606 attacks on him as a papist were rare. The fact that the power of bishops in the church had been so recently re-established doomed Spottiswoode's hopes of succeeding to Dunbar's place with James; the king well knew that to give an ecclesiastic political power at this juncture would cause a severe aristocratic backlash. After Dunbar's confrontational regime a period of consolidation was needed, for which Dunfermline's conciliatory methods were ideally suited. So in 1611 Dunfermline succeeded Dunbar as the king's principal adviser and agent in Scottish affairs, and as keeper for life of the palace and park of Holyroodhouse; he remained in power until his death.<br>
<br>Dunfermline's success was all the more remarkable in that he remained in Edinburgh, far from the king's court and the king's ear. His method was to create consensus in the privy council, which gradually filled with his former colleagues on the court of session, and to keep in touch with the king by letters sent either directly to him or to one of the Scots at court&#151;usually either John Murray, first earl of Annandale, the keeper of the privy purse, or Thomas Erskine, first earl of Kellie, the captain of the guard, whose eldest son married one of Dunfermline's daughters. If James issued an order that the councillors thought unwise, they normally delayed executing it until they could make their case to the king. As the lord treasurer, John Erskine, nineteenth earl of Mar, later put it to Charles I, &#145;A hundred times your worthy Father has sent down directions unto us which we have stayed, and he has given us thanks for it when we have informed him of the truth&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mar and Kellie MSS</span>, 146).<br>
<br>The first years of Dunfermline's administration saw the consolidation and extension of the changes made during the Dunbar regime. Dunfermline served as royal commissioner at the parliament of 1612, which ratified the restoration of the power of bishops in the church, which Dunbar had forced through the general assembly in 1610. Parliament also approved a tax to help pay for Princess Elizabeth's wedding. Dunbar's successful efforts to maintain order on the borders were continued by a commission of which Dunfermline's brother Sir William Seton was a prominent member. The most conspicuous victim was the lawless eighth Lord Maxwell, beheaded in 1612, an indication that noble blood would no longer protect a malefactor from the executioner's axe. An even more prominent victim of the law and order campaign was the king's cousin Patrick Stewart, earl of Orkney, who had been in ward in Edinburgh since 1609 on charges of oppression of his tenants. In 1612 parliament annexed the earldom to the crown. Dunfermline's government began to negotiate with the earl over the terms on which he would formally surrender his rights. Instead Orkney authorized his bastard son to raise a rebellion. It failed; father and son were both executed early in 1615, and the earldom remained in the hands of the crown. In the south-western highlands the law and order campaign was equally successful, though the king's decision to entrust the Campbells with the task of subduing the rebellious MacDonalds and MacGregors did not please Dunfermline, who feared the aggrandizement of this ambitious family. Though trouble spots remained, the pacification of the highlands was, on the whole, very successful.<br>
<br>The welfare of the landed classes, and the maintenance of their local pre-eminence provided that they obeyed the king, was the guiding principle of Dunfermline's administration. He discouraged Archbishop Spottiswoode's effort to get rid of hereditary sheriffs. Dunbar's last parliament had authorized the creation of justices of the peace on the English model. Dunfermline implemented the statute very cautiously, and made no effort to limit the judicial rights of holders of regalities. The privy council looked after the interests of grain growers, sheep raisers, and mine owners; only in times of acute food shortage did the council adopt policies favouring the consumer rather than the aristocratic producer. Dunfermline made no effort to alter the archaic tax structure, and usually discouraged the voting of taxes. The peace and prosperity of these years made taxation less necessary in any event.<h2>
<a name="Thelastphase"></a>The last phase</h2>Dunfermline was responsible for the logistics of King James's only visit to his native land, in 1617, and on the whole it went well. James's principal public purpose was to arrange for changes in the Scottish church to bring its practices closer to those of the Church of England. The upshot was the so-called five articles of Perth, which, to James's surprise and irritation, met with considerable resistance as being &#145;popish&#146; in nature. They failed to secure adoption in a general assembly held after his departure, and were pushed through only with difficulty at the assembly held at Perth in 1618. Dunfermline bears some responsibility for all this. On account of the political problems he had had in the past owing to the widespread belief that he was a concealed papist, he had carefully avoided religious issues in his reports to the king, though it is unlikely that he was unaware of how unpopular the five articles would prove to be. The long-range consequences for the monarchy were serious. In the face of popular resistance James eventually drew back and did not insist on the enforcement of the articles. What the episode demonstrated was that the power of the crown, greatly enhanced though it was after 1603, nevertheless had its limits.<br>
<br>James did not blame Dunfermline for the difficulties his religious policies encountered, and the chancellor's grip on power continued. The years following James's visit saw considerable governmental activity on behalf of various manufacturing interests: glass making, leather tanning, soap. In 1620 the war in central Europe began to affect Scotland. In 1621 parliament voted a large tax for the war, including, for the first time, a 5 per cent levy on annual rents, a significant broadening of the direct-tax base which remained in place after the short-lived British involvement in the war ended. It was Dunfermline's last major service to King James; he died on 16 June 1622 at home at Pinkie House, Musselburgh, aged sixty-six. On 9 July he was buried at Dalgety, Fife, where he had acquired a property in 1593; both Lilias and Grizel were buried there, and so in due course was his widow, who died on 30 December 1659. He left behind him cash and moveables worth about &pound;44,000 Scots and over &pound;11,000 Scots in debts owing to him, as well as his land. He died a rich man.<br>
<br>Dunfermline's success as a consensus builder and a political moderate was remarkable. He even defused his potentially explosive religious stance. Calderwood in recording his death could write, &#145;Howsoever he was Popishly disposed in his religion, yet he condemned many abuses &hellip; in the kirk of Rome. He was a good justiciar, courteous and humane &hellip; but no good friend to the bishops&#146;  (Calderwood, 7.549). His political rival Archbishop Spottiswoode wrote that &#145;He exercised his place with great moderation, and above all things studied to maintain peace and quietness&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of the Church</span>, 3.263). Dunfermline also left behind monuments to his aesthetic taste in his two notable houses, Fyvie Castle in Aberdeenshire, and Pinkie House in Musselburgh. His heir was his only surviving son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25117/', "Charles Seton")</script>, born of his third marriage in 1615. His portrait, painted in 1610, hangs in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery.<br>
