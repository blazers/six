<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Teddeman, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1620&#150;1668), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was a son of Thomas Teddeman (<i>d</i>. after 1658), sometime mayor of Dover, Kent. Captain Henry Teddeman was his brother. In August 1652, on the outbreak of war with the Dutch, Teddeman was appointed lieutenant of the <i>Royal Sovereign</i>, the largest ship in the navy, which suggests that he had some powerful patrons. His naval service was brief, however, for in 1653 he was commanding a small privateer, the <i>Speedwell</i> of Dover, of four guns and 40 tons, against the Dutch. After the war he probably pursued a mercantile career for several years, but in 1657 he was appointed captain of the <i>Victory</i>. Early in March 1660 he was appointed captain of the <i>Tredagh</i> for the summer guard, no doubt by the influence of Edward Mountagu (later earl of Sandwich), and he acted as Mountagu's election agent at Dover, a seat which Mountagu won in 1660. Teddeman commanded in <i>Tredagh</i> (soon renamed the <i>Resolution</i>) in the Mediterranean, where on 31 May off Algiers he encountered six Spanish ships which he chased into Gibraltar and under the guns of the forts. However, in December the ship's company petitioned to the king against him, and Sir William Coventry commented sarcastically, &#145;what Teddyman and his officers are may appear by their impeaching each other&#146;  (Longleat House, Wiltshire, Bath papers, Coventry MS 98, fol. 66). Teddeman survived an investigation and in May 1661 was appointed to the <i>Fairfax</i>.<br>
<br>In command of the <i>Kent</i> in 1663, Teddeman carried the earl of Carlisle to Archangel on an embassy to Russia. In May 1664 he transferred to the <i>Revenge</i>, and in 1665, in the <i>Royal Katherine</i>, he was rear-admiral of the Blue squadron, with the earl of Sandwich, in the action off Lowestoft, for which he was knighted on 1 July. Following this success, in August he led a disastrous attempt to capture a Dutch East India Company fleet, rumoured that year to be returning from Smyrna and Batavia with exceptionally rich cargoes. This fleet had followed its normal wartime route round Shetland and was heading into the North Sea when it was ordered to take refuge; the ships anchored in Bergen, then under neutral Danish rule. A plot was then hatched whereby the Danes and English agreed to share the plunder, but no final orders had been given to each side when Teddeman's squadron arrived off Bergen on 10 August. Fearing lest he should be trapped by an approaching Dutch rescue force, Teddeman attacked on 12 August but, faced by a wind off the land, could not send in his fireships. The commander of the Danish fort, lacking instructions to the contrary, sided with the Dutch. After three and a half hours of battle Teddeman's squadron retreated in confusion, having suffered 500 or 600 casualties against fewer than 100 on the Dutch side. In the same year Teddeman was among those summoned to parliament in connection with the abuse of regulations concerning prize goods.<br>
<br>Happier times arrived in 1666; as vice-admiral of the blue, in <i>Royal Katherine</i>, Teddeman was involved in what was known as &#145;the four-day fight&#146;, when between 1 and 4 June English vessels engaged a Dutch fleet in the channel. The Dutch lost six or seven ships and 2000 killed or wounded, the English lost more heavily but felt themselves to have put up a better fight. He was vice-admiral of the white in the &#145;St James fight&#146; on 1 July, also against the Dutch, off North Foreland, which resulted in a brilliant and decisive English victory. In October 1667, the year in which he commanded the Dover squadron, Teddeman discussed the matter of discipline in the fleet with Samuel Pepys, who knew him well; Teddeman lamented its bad state, while praising his patron Sandwich. The following year Pepys found him languishing in a house in Old Street, Clerkenwell, very ill of a fever&#151;&#145;a good man, a good seaman, and stout&#146; he remarked in his diary  (Pepys, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 9.164). Teddeman died on 12 May 1668. His funeral on 15 May, which Pepys attended, was held at Loriners' Hall, Moorgate, and he was buried the same day at St Mary's, Rotherhithe, Surrey. Nothing is known of Teddeman's wife or children, beyond a passing reference by Sir Thomas Allin, who met Teddeman's son-in-law at sea early in 1668.<br>
