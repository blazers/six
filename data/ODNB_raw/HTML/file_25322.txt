<span class="headword">Shenton,  Henry Chawner</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1803, <em>d.</em> 1866), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, the son of John Shenton and his wife, Sarah, was baptized on 14 March 1803 at St Thomas's, Winchester, and moved to London in 1817. He became a pupil of Charles Warren, whose daughter Mary Ann he married on 9 March 1824. They had at least three children. Shenton was at first employed on small illustrations for books and annuals from designs by Thomas Stothard, Thomas Uwins, Richard Westall, Edward Corbould, and others, some of which he exhibited with the Society of British Artists between 1825 and 1832. For these early exhibits he is sometimes recorded as &#145;F. C. Shenton&#146;. In 1825 he joined the Artists' Annuity Fund.<br>
<br>Shenton engraved some works after old masters: in 1833, <span class="italic">The Merry Fiddler</span>, after J. Berkheydon, and <span class="italic">A Jew Merchant</span>, after Rembrandt; in 1834, <span class="italic">Christ Reasoning with the Pharisees</span>, after Leonardo da Vinci, which appeared in Allan Cunningham's <span class="italic">Cabinet Gallery</span> in 1836; and later, in 1861, <span class="italic">Death of Cleopatra</span>, after Guido Reni, completed by Herbert Bourne for the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span>. For the <span class="italic">Art Journal's</span> series of plates from the Vernon gallery he engraved <span class="italic">Country Cousins</span>, after Richard Redgrave, in 1854, also published in <span class="italic">The Vernon Gallery of British Art</span>, ed S. C. Hall (3 vols., 1854). His portraits included historical figures as well as those of contemporaries: <span class="italic">James V, King of Scotland</span>, after Solomon A. Hart, was published in 1834 by Charles Tilt; <span class="italic">William Allen</span>, after Henry P. Briggs, followed in 1845; and <span class="italic">The Earl of Zetland, M. W. Grand Master of English Freemasons</span>, unattributed, was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1857. He executed some good plates on a larger scale, among them <span class="italic">The Stray Kitten</span>, after William Collins, and <span class="italic">The Hermit</span>, after Alexander Fraser. For <span class="italic">Finden's Royal Gallery of British Art</span> (1838&#150;49), he engraved <span class="italic">A Day's Sport in the Highlands</span>, after Abraham Cooper, and <span class="italic">The Loan of a Bite</span>, after William Mulready, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1858. He contributed one engraving, <span class="italic">Olden Hospitality</span>, after J. R. Robert, to Hall's <span class="italic">Gems of European Art</span> (1846). Shenton's best-known plates are the three published by the Art Union of London: <span class="italic">The Tired Huntsman</span>, after Charles Landseer (1840); <span class="italic">The Clemency of Coeur de Lion</span>, after John Cross (1856), a painting entered for the Westminster Hall competition; and <span class="italic">A Labour for Love</span>, after T. F. Dicksee (1863); this last was completed by C. H. Jeens after the failure of Shenton's eyesight. Shenton also executed for the Art Union a set of outlines of incidents in English history, from designs by various artists, issued in 1847. The <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> noted in 1866 that he was one of the last survivors of the able band of engravers in the pure line manner who had flourished during the first half of the century. Assessing Shenton's work, J. H. Slater later noted that &#145;their quality is &hellip; undoubted, and they should take a foremost place in any revival of interest in English line engraving of the period&#146;  (Engen, 177). He died suddenly at Camden Town on 15 September 1866.<br>
<br>Shenton's eldest son, <a name="cosubject_25322"></a><span class="headword">Henry Chawner Shenton</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1825, <em>d.</em> 1846), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was baptized at St Pancras Old Church, London, on 5 January 1825 and entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1843; he also studied in Rome. He was a pupil of the sculptor William Behnes. He exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1843 a group of Christ and Mary and in 1845 <span class="italic">The Penitent</span>, an alto relievo; in 1844, at the Westminster Hall competition, a colossal group of <span class="italic">The Burial of the Princes in the Tower</span>; and in 1845, also at Westminster Hall, a statue of Cranmer. Apparently Shenton worked under very difficult conditions, for his first group was:<blockquote>modelled in a stable with a roof so low that the ground had to be dug away to a depth of several feet, while the only light came through a narrow window in the wall, to the damps and chill of this fireless workroom his friends attribute the first insinuation of that disease which has laid the sculptor in an early grave. (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 1846, 72)</blockquote>He died on 7 February 1846.His brother, <a name="cosubject_25324"></a><span class="headword">William Kernot Shenton</span>  (1836&#150;1878), was born in June 1836. He also became a <span class="occ">sculptor</span> and exhibited medallion portraits, including <span class="italic">The Poet Schiller</span>, at the Royal Academy from 1857 to 1871. For a time he taught drawing and modelling in the art school at the Crystal Palace. He died on 19 April 1878.<br>
<br>Living at the same addresses in London in Camden Town and Regent's Park as Shenton and his two sons was his daughter <a name="cosubject_65293"></a><span class="headword">Ellen Maria Nicholson Shenton</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1828, <em>d.</em> 1859), also a <span class="occ">sculptor</span>. She exhibited Byronic, biblical, and Shakespearian subjects at the Royal Academy between 1850 and 1859.<br>
