<span class="headword">Ratcliffe <span class="st"> [Sicklemore]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1610), <span class="occ">mariner and colonist</span>, is a mysterious figure. His family name appears to have been Sicklemore; why he chose to call himself Ratcliffe remains a riddle. His patent abilities as a mariner and his evident willingness to gamble at speculative ventures most likely account for why officials in the Virginia Company of London named him a leader of their colonial enterprise in 1606. He commanded the pinnace <i>Discovery</i>, one of the three vessels that bore the original complement of adventurers to Jamestown in 1607, and he held a seat on the resident council of the colony.<br>
<br>Unbeknown to Ratcliffe and the others, the worst drought in more than seven centuries lay upon eastern Virginia in 1607, and it continued well into the 1610s. Arid weather made the usual heat and dryness of summers there intensely more unbearable for the colonists, who had little tolerance for such a climate. Drought also raised the salinity of the James River and the shallow aquifers around Jamestown, and it lessened available stocks of edibles that might be gleaned from the land or the natives. Those environmental conditions give an added poignancy to the accounts of George Percy, Edward Maria Wingfield, and others, which detailed the misery and privation that befell the struggling colony.<br>
<br>Death reduced numbers and dwindling supplies pinched stomachs. Constant bickering bespoke suspicions that Ratcliffe, his council colleagues, and the men all harboured for one another; contention also revealed a failure of leadership, especially that of the president, Wingfield. Ratcliffe soon fell in behind a majority of the resident council, who expelled the sickly, ever wary Wingfield in the summer of 1607 and made Ratcliffe president.<br>
<br>Ratcliffe retained the presidency for about a year. On his watch, the colony survived its first winter and welcomed two additional supplies of settlers and necessaries. Even so there was little cause for cheer because new colonists died off as fast as those they had intended to replace, whereas the colony lacked a means of sustaining itself and bringing profits to the company. Those difficulties were not wholly the fault of Ratcliffe, but a measure of responsibility was surely his, given that his talents for seamanship did not translate readily into skills for leading men on dry land. Indolence and a distrustful nature also got in his way. Like Wingfield before him, Ratcliffe gave too frequent ear to whispers of conspiracies, and, like Wingfield, he turned on the boisterous but effective Captain John Smith, who had helped him rise to his place. His own illness and a severe injury limited his effectiveness too. Such liabilities put an unsteady hand on the colony's tiller and bred continued talk of mutiny.<br>
<br>After the fact, John Smith hinted that mutiny finally brought Ratcliffe down in September 1608, when Smith himself became president of Virginia. Smith's allegation may have enlarged upon reality because councillors held the presidency only for a year, which was just about the length of time Ratcliffe had been in office. Whatever the truth, Ratcliffe, on Smith's orders, sailed for England in December 1608. Smith then warned company officials to keep him there because he was so fractious, but Ratcliffe returned the following August. He was one of the councillors who took charge after a gunpowder accident forced his enemy Smith back to London in search of a cure for his wound.<br>
<br>Ratcliffe lived into 1610. While he was on a trading expedition a force of natives attacked his party and killed them all. He was buried in Virginia. It was another colonist, Ralph Hamor, who perhaps best summed up Ratcliffe's effect on Virginia: &#145;Capt: <i>Ratleife</i>&#146;, he noted, was not &#145;worthy remembring, but to his dishonor&#146;  (Hamor, 7). He may have been married, since one Dorothy Ratcliffe, whose husband had been dead for two years, married George Warburton in 1612. It is, however, unlikely that he was the Ratcliff who served as a captain of horse in the Netherlands and was captured at the battle of Mulheim in 1605, since the latter was back in Dutch pay by 1607.<br>
