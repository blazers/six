<span class="headword">Davidson, Sir  Samuel Cleland</span>  (1846&#150;1921), <span class="occ">inventor of tea processing machinery and manufacturer</span>, was born on 18 November 1846 at Ballymachan Farm, near Belfast, the youngest of the seven children of James Davidson (1799&#150;1869), corn miller, and his wife, Mary Taylor (1808&#150;1896), also of Irish stock. Until the age of fifteen Samuel was educated at the Royal Academical Institution, Belfast. Then, after two years of private tuition, he entered the offices of William Hastings, a Belfast surveyor and civil engineer, where he acquired his lifelong love of scientific experimentation. As a younger son, he could not hope to inherit the family business. Therefore, in 1864, through a cousin's influence, he found employment on an Indian tea plantation. Later, helped by his father, he purchased the estate.<br>
<br>Thereby enjoying independence and financial security, Davidson spent the rest of his life gratifying his taste and talent for mechanical invention. From 1869 until 1881 he lived in India mapping tea plantations and investigating ways of improving the processing and packaging of tea, becoming a consultant in tea production to the Indian government. He took a leave in Belfast to marry Clara Mary Coleman (1851&#150;1918) on 30 January 1873. Together they had five children; three predeceased their parents. In 1881 Davidson returned permanently to Ireland and established a small engineering business. The demand for quality tea was rising rapidly at this time. The main difficulty in bulk production lay at the drying stage. The old method, using charcoal fires, was slow, and frequently produced inferior tea. Most of Davidson's inventive activity after 1864 was devoted to solving that problem by perfecting the use of fans. In 1898 he finally achieved success, and made the business a limited company trading under the name of Sirocco, called after the hot east wind that blows north from Africa. By 1914 the firm employed over a thousand people. Although Davidson's work on fans was his most enduring contribution, he also revolutionized other aspects of tea manufacture, from the receiving of the leaf at the factory to the packaging of the final product. The fan he had initially invented for drying tea proved adaptable for other purposes such as ventilating mines and ships, and later, after Davidson's death, for use in air-raid shelters, power stations, meat and vegetable dehydration plants, and aircraft.<br>
<br>By the time Davidson died he had registered more than 120 patents. Most were for tea processing machinery and fans, but he also invented the hand howitzer, a predecessor of the anti-tank bazooka. In addition, he held patents for belt rivets, steam engines, the manufacture of peat briquettes, and machinery for processing rubber. Although Davidson never held political office, he was a staunch loyalist and a generous supporter of the Ulster Volunteer Force. But his devotion to unionism did not prevent his fierce opposition to the expulsion of Roman Catholic workers from his factory during rioting in 1912 and 1920. On 22 June 1921 he was made a KBE and on 18 August of the same year he died at his home, Seacourt, Bangor, co. Down. He was buried in Belfast city cemetery two days later.<br>
