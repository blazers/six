<span class="headword">FitzRoy,  Charles</span>, second duke of Grafton  (1683&#150;1757), <span class="occ">courtier and politician</span>, was born at Arlington House, London, on 25 October 1683 and was baptized there on 30 October, the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9636/', "Henry FitzRoy, first duke of Grafton (1663&#150;1690)")</script>, and his wife, Isabella (1667/8&#150;1723), the only daughter and sole heir of Charles II's former secretary of state Henry Bennet, first earl of Arlington. His father was the king's third child and second son from his liaison with Barbara Palmer, countess of Castlemaine, later duchess of Cleveland. From his birth and until his succession to the dukedom in 1690 young Charles FitzRoy was styled by his father's second title, earl of Euston. He eventually succeeded to his mother's Arlington titles in February 1723. His position as a member of Charles II's unofficial royal family was confirmed by the line-up of godparents at his christening&#151;the king himself, Prince William of Orange, and Princess Anne of Denmark. Grafton always thought himself as of royal blood, and the courtly environment into which he had been born remained central to him throughout his life.<br>
<br>In March 1698, at the age of fourteen, he was appointed master of the horse to the young William, duke of Gloucester, the only surviving child of William III's sister-in-law and heir, Princess Anne. Later that year he embarked on a grand tour. In the autumn of 1702 negotiations were under way for his marriage to a daughter of Colonel Charles Godfrey, whose wife was the elder sister of John Churchill, first duke of Marlborough. Although the marriage plan was dropped, it did lead in April 1703 to Grafton's acceptance of a commission as a volunteer member of Marlborough's retinue during the seige of Bonn with the rank of captain of horse. On returning to England afterwards he was to have executed a commission to raise a regiment of dragoons, but in January 1704 Marlborough curtly minuted that Grafton had given orders for the sale of his equipage and evidently had no further thoughts of soldiering.<br>
<br>On 25 October 1704, the day on which he came of age, Grafton took his seat in the House of Lords. His whiggish sympathies were quickly registered by the Godolphin ministry and in February 1705, with a general election approaching, he was appointed lord lieutenant of Suffolk. It was here, to the north of the county, around Euston, that the family estates were situated. However, Grafton's standing as the county's leading whig was retarded by the fact that control of the Euston Hall interest in county elections lay not with himself but with his stepfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12205/', "Sir Thomas Hanmer, fourth baronet (1677&#150;1746)")</script>, an active and influential Suffolk tory whom his mother, the dowager duchess, had married in 1698 having previously inherited Euston and its lands from her father, Lord Arlington. Grafton gave enthusiastic support to the Suffolk whigs at the 1705 election, but their defeat only inaugurated what was to be a long unbroken period of tory monopoly over the county seats that lasted until 1747, with Hanmer for many years one of the MPs. In the election of 1708, however, Grafton did show a determined hand at Thetford, a short distance from Euston, and, ignoring pleas not to breach family unity, procured the defeat of the sitting tories, one of whom was his stepfather. Grafton's interest in the borough's elections waned after this, but revived in the early 1720s when he finally assumed control of the Euston estate.<br>
<br>Aside from these youthful forays into politics Grafton indulged himself in the lavish and leisurely lifestyle that was commensurate with ducal status, and in particular in what was to be his lifelong love of the turf and of fox-hunting; he held the rangership of Whittlesbury Forest from 1712 until his death, having in 1705 inherited the honour of Grafton, a collection of manors in the same south-east vicinity of Northamptonshire. He was also on the look-out for a marriage that would be financially advantageous. In 1708 the social talk was of his courtship of a Mrs Knight, a wealthy lady of dissenting background said to be worth some &pound;70,000. When he did eventually marry, on 30 April 1713 at Chelsea, it was to Lady Henrietta (1690&#150;1726), the daughter of Charles Somerset, marquess of Worcester, and sister of Henry Somerset, second duke of Beaufort. She was the granddaughter, on her mother's side, of the great City of London financier Sir Josiah Child, first baronet. They had eight children, the duchess dying on 9 August 1726, three weeks after the birth of their fourth daughter.<br>
<br>Soon after the accession of George I in August 1714 Grafton was seeking a position at court as one of the gentlemen of the bedchamber to the new monarch, and was duly appointed, doubtless upon the willing endorsement of the whig leaders. At the king's coronation on 20 October he acted as lord high steward and was a central figure in the procession as bearer of St Edward's crown. In 1715, upon the earl of Sunderland's refusal to go to Ireland to fulfil his office as lord lieutenant, Grafton was appointed to join the commission of lords justices nominated to deputize at Dublin Castle, and accordingly was sworn of the privy council on 31 August. Grafton, already a long-standing friend of Robert Walpole, and firmly aligned with the Townshend&#150;Walpole faction, resigned his offices at the opening of the &#145;whig schism&#146; in 1717, though he nevertheless continued to be warmly received by the king at court. He later boasted that this was the only time he was ever in opposition to a ministry.<br>
<br>When Townshend and Walpole were reinstated in the administration in 1720 Grafton returned to Ireland, this time as lord lieutenant. Appointment as a knight of the Garter followed in March 1721. Initially Grafton seemed an ideal choice as viceroy, having as a lord justice established excellent working relations with William Conolly, the speaker of the Irish House of Commons, whom the ministers in London acknowledged as their &#145;chief undertaker&#146; in the management of Irish parliamentary politics. This <i>modus operandi</i> was threatened by the activities of Conolly's rival, the Irish lord chancellor, Alan Brodrick, Viscount Midleton, who in late years had distanced himself increasingly from the government in London, and Grafton arrived in Dublin in 1721 openly determined to have him removed. He neglected, however, to prepare his ground by lining up a suitable replacement, and was forced by Walpole into the embarrassment of seeking a reconciliation with Midleton and into asking him to remain as chancellor for the time being. Grafton's inept handling of Midleton exposed him as weak and incompetent in the eyes of his colleagues in London. Not surprisingly, when confronted in the autumn of 1723 with the storm of protest in Ireland over Wood's halfpence and the opportunity it gave to Midleton to step up his opposition, Grafton's panic was met with sharp responses from both Townshend and Walpole, reminding him of his responsibilities. He had behaved, they felt, like a &#145;fair weather pilot&#146;  (Coxe, 2.285&#150;6), but they failed to appreciate&#151;at least until it was noted by the duke of Newcastle&#151;that Conolly's outright refusal to defend the patent had left Grafton isolated and alone in having to shoulder the burden of this highly unpopular item of government policy.<br>
<br>In the ministerial reshuffle of April 1724 Grafton was appointed lord chamberlain, and served in this capacity, with a place on the &#145;cabinet council&#146;, for the remaining thirty-three years of his life. He was likewise a lord justice during each of the king's periodic absences in Hanover. The undemanding nature of the chamberlain's office was far more congenial to Grafton's temperament. His duties as the chief functionary of the court were usually no more than ornamental or ceremonial. Lord Hervey complained that he never bothered to master the technicalities of court form and his blundering and lack of interest in delicate points of precedence irritated lowlier courtiers. He was, however, naturally accomplished in the blandnesses of court conversation, a skill that Hervey epitomized as &#145;a sort of gold leaf, that is a great embellishment where it is joined to anything else, but makes a very poor figure by itself&#146;  (Hervey, 266). His semi-royal status enabled him to assume a right to say what he pleased and he was noticed to have a certain over-familiarity with members of the royal family&#151;with Queen Caroline, towards whom he adopted a teasing dislike, and with her daughter Princess Amelia, whom it was widely suspected he had seduced on one of their frequent hunting expeditions. He was the first lord chamberlain to exercise the powers vested in his office by the <span class="roman">Licensing Act</span> of 1737 to license plays in the City of London, Westminster, and certain other areas, the routine work being undertaken by a salaried &#145;examiner of plays&#146; within his department.<br>
<br>Beneath Grafton's docile exterior lay the instincts of a shrewd courtier. His friend and fellow ministerialist, James, second Earl Waldegrave, observed that &#145;from long observation and great natural sagacity, he became the ablest courtier of his time&#146;  (Waldegrave, 199). With his disarming wit he would ridicule politics and tease politicians with their foibles. Horace Walpole's comment that at times of crisis Grafton would avoid declaring support for the ministry to which he belonged by going off to hunt fits well with Hervey's recollection of a remark by George II, that he was &#145;always balancing whether he should speak truth or flatter those whom truth would disoblige&#146;  (Hervey, 266). He nevertheless remained closely associated with the generation of ageing <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93705', "&#145;old corps&#146; whigs")</script> led by the duke of Newcastle, and there were key moments when his mollifying interventions on their behalf were vital in smoothing dissensions between king and ministers. Grafton's unmatched ability to manage Newcastle on these occasions was regarded as a particular asset, but so, too, was his relationship with George II, which was probably much closer than that of any other minister or courtier from the early 1740s onwards. The king and the duke were exactly the same age, and the duke &#145;had a particular manner of talking to his master upon all subjects, and of touching the most tender points, which no other person ventured to imitate&#146;  (Waldegrave, 199).<br>
<br>Grafton died at his home, Euston Hall, Suffolk, on 6 May 1757 and was buried at Euston on 13 May, having as the result of a riding accident in February suffered severe injury to his leg which later turned septic. All four of his sons had predeceased him, and the dukedom passed to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9628/', "Augustus Henry FitzRoy")</script>, the son of his third son, Lord Augustus FitzRoy, a captain in the Royal Navy who had died in 1741. The duke's illegitimate son, Charles FitzRoy (later FitzRoy-Scudamore), born about the time of his marriage, enjoyed a long career as an MP and was father of the House of Commons at the time of his death in 1782.<br>
