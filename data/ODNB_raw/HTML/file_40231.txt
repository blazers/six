<span class="headword">Brookfield,  Charles Hallam Elton</span>  (1857&#150;1913), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was born on 19 May 1857, the third child and second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3561/', "William Henry Brookfield (1809&#150;1874)")</script>, clergyman and inspector of schools, and his wife, Jane Octavia Elton [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56277/', "Brookfield, Jane Octavia (1821&#150;1896)")</script>], novelist and close friend of Thackeray. From childhood he was accustomed to the company of his parents' literary friends and he inherited his father's gift for mimicry and love for the theatre, creating dramatic diversions with his brother Arthur. From 1871 until 1873 he attended Westminster School and then devoted two years to occasional attendance at lectures at King's College, London, and to dashes across the channel to revel in the techniques of comic actors in the theatres of Paris. He also rubbed shoulders with writers who included Rudyard Kipling and R. L. Stevenson, became a reviewer of novels for <span class="italic">The Examiner</span>, and began his attachment to London club life when he gained membership of the Savile Club at the age of seventeen. At Trinity College, Cambridge (1875&#150;8), he was prominent in the productions of the Amateur Dramatic Club but went down without taking a degree, distinguished only by the award of the Winchester reading prize. Later photographs show a neat, sleek-haired man with alert eyes; he was described as &#145;sparkling, debonair and full of stories&#146;  (cutting in Brookfield MSS); his gift for repartee and caustic wit ensured great popularity in clubs and social gatherings.<br>
<br>After a short and uncongenial period studying law, Brookfield decided in 1879 to try his luck on the stage in spite of strong opposition from his family, using his friend Henry Kemble (who had never seen him act) as a referee. He experienced an uneasy start in pantomime and in a touring company, where his health problems became overwhelming for a time, but in 1880 he was invited to join Squire Bancroft's highly successful company in the renovated Haymarket Theatre, London, where he gained many complimentary notices for his performances in supporting roles. He also began writing plays, many translations of, or derivations from, works in French. On 4 December 1884 he married Frances Mary Grogan (1857/8&#150;1926), daughter of William Grogan. She was an actress who used the stage name Ruth Francis. Their only child, Peter (who took the religious name of Paul when he became a monk), was born on 28 June 1888.<br>
<br>On Bancroft's retirement in 1884 Brookfield continued his successful acting career until in 1898 he became very ill and advanced tuberculosis was diagnosed. Periods of convalescence abroad were followed by a financially precarious existence, clouded by ill health, but he remained outwardly cheerful and applied himself to writing and marketing his plays. He converted to Roman Catholicism in 1900, and found peace and enjoyment during visits to Downside Abbey in Somerset, where his son became a pupil in 1901. He was the author of <span class="italic">The Twilight of Love</span> (1893), <span class="italic">Random Reminiscences</span> (1902), and, with his wife, of <span class="italic">Mrs Brookfield and her Circle</span> (1905). He wrote, or co-wrote, many plays, concentrating on farce, revue, and burlesque. A typical product was <span class="italic">Under the Clock</span>, a spoof Sherlock Holmes story which provoked the wrath of Conan Doyle.<br>
<br>Brookfield's appointment as examiner of plays in 1911 caused an outcry. He had set his face firmly against the New Drama as exemplified by Ibsen and Shaw, and felt an implacable and seemingly obsessive hatred for Oscar Wilde (he had mocked Wilde and <span class="italic">Lady Windermere's Fan</span> in his play <span class="italic">The Poet and the Puppets</span> and had helped gather evidence against Wilde in the trial of 1895). Brookfield had also himself been attacked for perceived amorality in his play of 1906, <span class="italic">Dear Old Charlie</span>. However, he weathered the storm and carried out his duties with aplomb until his death from tuberculosis on 20 October 1913 at his home, 28 Clareville Street, Hereford Square, London. He was buried in the Catholic church at Stratton on the Fosse, Somerset, on 23 October, after a requiem mass on the same day at Brompton Oratory, London.<br>
