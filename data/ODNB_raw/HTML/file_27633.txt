<span class="headword">Townshend, Sir  Roger</span>  (<em>c.</em>1544&#150;1590), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was the eldest son of Richard Townshend (<i>d</i>. before 1551), landowner, of Brampton, Suffolk, and Katherine, daughter and coheir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69359/', "Sir Humphrey Browne")</script>, justice of the common pleas. In 1551 he inherited more than twenty manors in the vicinity of Raynham, Norfolk, and other property from his great-grandfather Sir Roger Townshend that was worth &pound;630 per annum in 1546, making him one of the wealthiest gentlemen in East Anglia. He attended Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1553 but did not graduate. A special commission declared him of age to enter into his estates in February 1565, and he received a licence to do so in May. He subsequently followed his grandfather into the service of the Howard family, becoming man of business to Thomas Howard, fourth duke of Norfolk. This service kept him predominantly in London, but he strengthened his ties to his county by marrying Ursula (<i>d</i>. before 1564), daughter of Sir Christopher Heydon, one of Norfolk's leading gentlemen. Heydon was protestant and was not a Howard client. In 1563 Townshend was elected MP for Norfolk at a by-election. The duke used his influence effectively but bluntly by virtually ordering the sheriff to oversee the return of Howard clients.<br>
<br>Following his wife's death without children, Townshend married Jane (<i>c</i>.1547&#150;1618), daughter of Sir Michael Stanhope of Shelford, Nottinghamshire, and Anne, daughter of Nicholas Rawson of Aveley, Essex. They had two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27630/', "Sir John Townshend (1567/8&#150;1603)")</script> and Sir Robert Townshend (<i>b</i>. 1580). Townshend continued in the service of the Howards, taking charge of the affairs of Philip Howard, earl of Arundel, after the execution of his father in 1572. Although Arundel complained about Townshend's zealousness in carrying out his duties, including prudently getting him away from a street brawl in 1582, and they had their differences at various times in the 1580s, the earl remembered his servant in his will with the generous gift of a large gilt bowl (though Townshend predeceased his master). He continued to court protestant families too. He leased the former Robsart estate in Norfolk from Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, from 1579 and owed him &pound;500 at the latter's death in 1588. Between 1576 and 1584 Townshend appeared with his wife on the list of donors of new year's gifts to Elizabeth I&#151;they may both have held office at court. Following Arundel's imprisonment, Townshend appears to have spent a short period in custody himself. His settlement of his estate through the writing of a will in December 1587 may indicate the transfer of his service to Arundel's half-brother Lord Thomas Howard, a member of the council of war of his kinsman Charles Howard, Baron Howard of Effingham and later earl of Nottingham. He certainly played an active part in the defeat of the Armada, being knighted at sea by Effingham, now lord admiral, on 26 July 1588.<br>
<br>Townshend died at Stoke Newington, Middlesex, a property he had purchased from Thomas Sutton, the founder of Charterhouse, London, on 30 June 1590 and was buried at St Giles Cripplegate. His extensive lands in Norfolk, along with property in Suffolk, Oxfordshire, Middlesex, and Essex left his widow and two sons well provided for. In 1597 she made an advantageous match with Henry Berkeley, seventh Baron Berkeley, whose first wife, Katherine, had been the sister of Townshend's first patron. Lord Thomas Howard was one of Jane Townshend's representatives in the financial settlement of this marriage, reinforcing the Howard connection.<br>
