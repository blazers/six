<span class="headword">Coles,  Elisha</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1608, <em>d.</em> 1688), <span class="occ">writer on religion</span>, was a native of Northamptonshire. Originally a trader in London, he had settled in Oxford by 1651, for on 23 May of that year he was appointed deputy registrar to the parliamentary visitors there in the absence of Ralph Austen, the registrar. In 1657 Dr Thomas Goodwin, president of Magdalen College, named him the college's steward.<br>
<br>As a commissioner for the ejection of scandalous ministers in Oxfordshire, Coles served with such colleagues as Dr Joshua Cross and Dr John Palmer. Their ejection of Henry Beesley from the living at Swerford in 1658 was upheld by the council of state. On 11 August 1660 the commissioners responsible for the visitation of the university and its colleges ordered Coles's removal from his stewardship on the grounds that he had been improperly admitted. Coles then became a clerk in the East India Company. An Independent, he wrote <span class="italic">A Practical Discourse of God's Sovereignty: with other Material Points, Deriving Thence</span> (1673), a work claiming to be grounded solely on scripture. According to his preface Coles had received some training in Calvinist tenets in his youth, but he was motivated to compose this 275-page treatise after discussions with some Arminians. Originally intended as a legacy for his children, the treatise was published after Coles received requests to do so from &#145;Antient and Sober Christians&#146;  (Coles, A4<i>r</i>). The third edition, issued by Nathaniel Ponder (who published John Bunyan's <span class="italic">Pilgrim's Progress</span>) and others in 1678, included commendatory epistles by Thomas Goodwin and (jointly) by John Owen and Samuel Annesley. The latter two praised Coles for his practical application of such doctrines as election, effectual calling, the atonement, and perseverance.<br>
<br>Coles and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1715&times;20), had a son, also <a name="cosubject_5894"></a><span class="headword">Elisha Coles</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1688)<span class="occ"></span>, whom he apprenticed to a trade, and who should not be confused with his cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5892/', "Elisha Coles (c.1640&#150;1680)")</script>, the lexicographer. Coles died in his house in Scalding Alley, London, about 28 October 1688, &#145;aged eighty years or more&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span> 3.1274&#150;6). He was interred in a nonconformist burial-ground, probably Bunhill Fields. He was survived by his wife and son, but the latter seems to have died before 1715, as he is not mentioned in his mother's will signed on 27 August in that year, and proved on 21 March 1720.<br>
