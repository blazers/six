<span class="headword">Shute,  Samuel</span>  (1662&#150;1742), <span class="occ">colonial governor and army officer</span>, was born on 12 January 1662, the son of Benjamin Shute and Patience, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4846/', "Joseph Caryl")</script>, clergyman and ejected minister. Shute was educated initially by Charles Morton, Puritan minister, was admitted to the Middle Temple on 23 November 1683, then to Christ's College, Cambridge (leaving without taking a degree), and finally to the University of Leiden. He preferred a military career, however, serving as a captain in Marlborough's European campaigns. He was wounded at the battle of Blenheim (1704) and ultimately rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the 3rd dragoon guards.<br>
<br>As a reward for his service Shute became governor of Massachusetts in 1716. He landed in Boston that October, and found himself embroiled in the factional struggles that remained from the administration of his predecessor, Joseph Dudley. Dudley and his son Paul favoured the issuance of paper currency by the government, whereas the popular party, headed by Elisha Cooke, had proposed a privately run land bank. Dudley had won the Massachusetts assembly's support on this issue, and Shute continued his policies.<br>
<br>Cooke, who speculated heavily in Maine lands, retaliated in 1718 by charging that John Bridger, the surveyor of the king's woods, had been collecting bribes that allowed some people to cut down trees reserved for the Royal Navy while preventing others from engaging in legitimate lumbering. Shute backed Bridger while Cooke persuaded the assembly his cause was just. The governor removed Cooke as clerk of the superior court and refused to allow his election to the provincial council in 1718. In defiance the house elected Cooke speaker in 1719, a choice Shute vetoed.<br>
<br>Shute had little peace for the rest of his administration. The assembly cut his salary by twenty per cent, refused to provide presents for the Abenaki Indians in Maine, and then declined to vote funds to fight them when war subsequently broke out. A drunken Cooke accosted him on the street and called him a blockhead. Instead of dealing with a minor Indian menace his successor easily handled, Shute and the assembly debated that body's power to adjourn without the governor's consent and argued constantly for the last three years of his administration.<br>
<br>Shute suddenly left for England on 1 January 1723, after someone took a pot shot at him in his home, narrowly missing him. He was followed by Cooke, who joined province agent Jeremiah Dummer in debating the same two issues of the house's right to self-adjournment and independently to elect its speaker. Finally, in 1726, the crown forced the Massachusetts legislature to accept an explanatory charter which gave the governor the right to veto the house speaker and only allowed the house to adjourn for two days, or over the weekend, without the governor's permission.<br>
<br>Although Shute was vindicated he was in no hurry to return to Massachusetts. When George I died in 1727, and all royal commissions were thus vacated, the ministry replaced Shute with William Burnet, who would continue to argue with the Massachusetts assembly over the limits of its privileges. Shute tried in vain to recover his unpaid salary from the Massachusetts legislature, but was placated with a royal pension of &pound;400 per year. He retired to private life, and died on 15 April 1742 while living in Westminster. He probably never married, for his will left several hundred pounds to nephews, nieces, a sister, and to several dissenting church charities in equal proportion, without mention of a wife or children.<br>
<br>Shute is a prime exemplar of the many military men sent by Britain to govern the colonies in the hopes that their experience could discipline the unruly provincials. But in time of peace there was little incentive for a colony to co-operate with British desires to curtail the liberties which the local legislatures claimed. Shute had begun as a friend of the colonies, thinking his dissenting connections would make his rule easy. He soon learned that he had no choice but to assert his prerogatives fruitlessly or capitulate to the wishes of his constituents.<br>
