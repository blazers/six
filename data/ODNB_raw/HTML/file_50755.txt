<span class="headword">Hunt,  Violet Edith Gwynllyn  Brooke-</span>  (1870&#150;1910), <span class="occ">writer, social worker, and political activist</span>, was born at The Court, Tibberton, Gloucestershire, on 18 June 1870, the eldest daughter of Charles George Hunt, afterwards Brooke-Hunt, who had retired as a lieutenant in the Royal Navy, and his wife, Gertrude, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Price. Brooke-Hunt was educated privately and then attended Cheltenham Ladies' College until the age of seventeen, when she became actively involved in the education of working-class boys and young men. This work began with the formation of a reading-room for the servants and labourers living on the family estate, and the opening of a club for the artisans of Gloucester. After moving to London in the early 1890s, her work was continued among the soldiers of the Knightsbridge barracks. Her pamphlet <span class="italic">Clubs for Boys and Young Men</span> (1897), read as a paper to the National Union of Women Workers in October 1896, argued strongly for the importance of clubs in raising &#145;the bodies and minds and spirits of their members&#146;  (Brooke-Hunt, <span class="italic">Clubs</span>, 6). It envisaged clubs equipping members with practical skills, offering non-compulsory religious instruction, and encouraging participation in athletics and games. The latter was understood to be essential if boys and young men were to be attracted away from the &#145;degrading&#146; influences of the public house and the music-hall. A devout Anglican, Brooke-Hunt also published a number of homilies during the 1890s, including <span class="italic">Goals and Tries</span> (1897) and <span class="italic">Egerton's Brother</span> (1899). These fictional works, written in simple, sometimes rather patronizing, language, were published under the auspices of the Society For Promoting Christian Knowledge. They were aimed at young male readers, who were exhorted to self-improvement under the inspiration and example of Christ.<br>
<br>With the encouragement of Florence Nightingale, Brooke-Hunt set sail for South Africa at the beginning of the South African War (1899&#150;1902) to help care for British soldiers. Beginning in Naauwport, she played an important role in improving the facilities, and in particular the food, of the station hospital and the convalescent camp. She then travelled to Bloemfontein and to Pretoria to set up soldiers' institutes, the latter specifically at the request of Lord Roberts. The institutes proved popular with soldiers, providing cheap meals and entertainments, reading-rooms, and a place to worship on Sundays. Brooke-Hunt was later awarded a war medal and the order of Lady of Grace of St John of Jerusalem for her services in South Africa.<br>
<br>Brooke-Hunt returned to Britain in time to organize the Colonial Troops Club at the coronation of Edward VII in August 1902. She then immersed herself in the organization of various extra-parliamentary associations, including the Union Jack Club, the Navy League, and the Tariff Reform League. Her role as secretary of the Women's Unionist and Tariff Reform Association established her as one of the more prominent Edwardian female political activists. Displaying formidable energy and organizational zeal, Brooke-Hunt helped to form over forty women's branches of the Tariff Reform League. She also showed herself to be a gifted public speaker, and regularly took to the platform to publicize her views on the fiscal question and the navy. Despite this self-assertiveness, Brooke-Hunt does not appear to have been connected with the suffragette movement, although neither is there any evidence to suggest that she was an anti-suffragist. In fact, the issue of the vote for women was not central to her political concerns. Her contribution to female emancipation proved more subtle, taking the form of broadening and politicizing the public role of women, and of acclimatizing some men to women's political activism.<br>
<br>Brooke-Hunt died unmarried on 9 June 1910 at the Gabled House, the home of her brother-in-law at The Holt, in Alverstoke, Hampshire. She was buried at Brompton cemetery. Her early death, at the age of thirty-nine (from infective enteritis and exhaustion), came as a shock to many political friends, particularly those associated with the tariff reform movement, whom she had greatly impressed with her drive and determination. In an obituary in the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>, Mary Maxse, erstwhile chairman of the Women's Tariff Reform League, described her as one of the most vivid personalities of her day, who was &#145;able to a remarkable degree to inspire with her own enthusiasm those with whom she worked&#146;.<br>
