<span class="headword">Ponet,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1514&#150;1556), <span class="occ">bishop of Winchester and religious controversialist</span>, was a native of Kent. Nothing else is known of his life before early 1533, when he graduated BA from Queens' College, Cambridge. That year he was elected a fellow of the college, and he proceeded MA in 1535. A student of Thomas Smith (1513&#150;1577), who had three years' seniority on the fellowship, Ponet showed great promise as a scholar, especially in Greek. In a later treatise Smith claimed that about 1535 he, Ponet, and John Cheke, then fellow of St John's College, had introduced to Cambridge the new method of Greek pronunciation developed by Cheke. Ponet was ordained priest at Lincoln on 10 June 1536, and served as bursar of his college from 1537 to 1539 and dean from 1540 to 1542. For eight years from 1543 he was rector of St Michael, Crooked Lane, London. In 1545, by which time he was a chaplain to Thomas Cranmer, he was also presented by the archbishop to the rectory of Lavant, Sussex, but the circumstances were controversial and he held it only briefly. On 29 January 1546 he was presented by John Sandford and Peter Lylly to the eighth prebend at Canterbury and the following year he became proctor for the diocese.<br>
<br>A man of multiple talents, Ponet was accomplished in Greek, Latin, Italian, and German. He was also renowned for his mathematical and astronomical abilities and was something of an engineer. He constructed a dial &#145;showing not only the hour of the day, but also the month, the sign of the sun, the planetary hour; yea, the change of the moon, the ebbing and flowing of the sea, with divers other things and strange&#146;  (Strype, <span class="italic">Ecclesiastical Memorials</span>, 2.607). Ponet presented this device to the king, to whom he was acting as chaplain by the last months of the reign and whose penchant for such curiosities was well known; it was received with enthusiasm. Ponet was also responsible for building &#145;a very elegant and curious summerhouse&#146; for Cranmer at Lambeth; in the time of Archbishop Matthew Parker this &#145;solar&#146;, which had fallen into disrepair, was restored  (Strype, <span class="italic">Parker</span>, 2.26, 79).<br>
<br>By 4 November 1548 and before Edward VI's parliament had legislated to abolish compulsory clerical celibacy, Ponet had married. On that date he and his wife, whose name is unknown, obtained an archiepiscopal dispensation to eat meat in Lent. The following year he published a treatise defending clerical marriage. His dedication of the work to Edward Seymour, duke of Somerset, and his general partisanship of the recently fallen protector probably account for his arrest in November 1549. The treatise also drew considerable fire from religious conservatives, although it was not until Mary's reign that Thomas Martyn responded in print with <span class="italic">A traictise declaryng and plainly prouving, that the pretensed marriage of priestes and professed persones, is no mariage</span> (1554). Ponet also issued <span class="italic">A Trageodie, or, Dialoge of the Unjust Usurper Primacy of the Bishop of Rome</span> (1549), a translation of Bernadino Ochino's dialogue in which a fictional Cranmer proved conclusively before Henry VIII and the pope that the latter was Antichrist. In addition to writing a treatise on the eucharist published in 1550, it has been suggested that Ponet was engaged in research in support of Cranmer's preparation of the new <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, the ordinal, and the <span class="roman">Book of Homilies</span>, and that he may have been the real author of <span class="italic">An Answer unto a Crafty and Sophistical Cavillation</span> (1550), ostensibly Cranmer's reply to Stephen Gardiner's objections to liturgical innovation.<br>
<br>Ponet's association with Cranmer ensured that the former's suffering from the temporary disgrace of Somerset did not last. By Lent 1550 his reputation had risen to the point where he was invited to preach before the king and council. While John Hooper delivered the Wednesday sermons with characteristic passion and controversy, Ponet preached on Fridays to great effect. Having been initially nominated in February to succeed Edmund Bonner as bishop of London, in March he was finally nominated to Rochester. The appointment to a see whose occupant traditionally served as a &#145;stand-in&#146; for Canterbury is indicative of the degree of trust Cranmer had in him and of the close nature of their relationship. He was consecrated at Lambeth on 29 June, in probably the first such ceremony to use the new ordinal. Because of the see's poverty and the lack of an episcopal palace, Ponet was licensed on 4 July to hold other preferments <i>in commendam</i>; he was the last bishop to be allowed to do so. In January 1551 he was appointed to the commission set up to investigate and discipline Anabaptists and sacramentarians in Essex and Kent. With Cranmer and Nicholas Ridley, bishop of London, he was consulted by the privy council on the matter of Princess Mary's hearing the mass. Their response that &#145;to give licence to sin was sin; nevertheless they thought the king might suffer or wink at it for a time&#146; reflects a pragmatic or conciliatory approach that has sometimes been ascribed to Ponet (Strype, <span class="italic">Ecclesiastical Memorials</span>, 2.451; Hudson, 48).<br>
<br>On 8 March 1551 Ponet was presented by the king to the bishopric of Winchester in succession to Gardiner, who had been deprived. On the same day he was one of the bishops who consecrated John Hooper as bishop of Gloucester following the latter's capitulation over the matter of vestments. Ponet himself was enthroned at Winchester by proxy on 3 June. His appointment was not without controversy. In exchange for the surrender to the crown of the lands of one of the wealthiest sees in England, he was to receive a fixed income of 2000 marks a year; this arrangement was reversed during the reign of Mary. His chaplains were John Bale and Hugh Goodacre, both later made bishops in Ireland, while his archdeacon was John Philpot, a radical protestant executed in 1556. Ponet's relationship with the latter was soured by a dispute over a pension due to be paid to the bishop by the archdeacon; this was finally settled in Ponet's favour by the privy council. This dispute, his earlier pluralism, and later reports that he lost goods and money worth some 4000 crowns in a fire at Strasbourg, gave rise to a reputation for avarice, but this characterization of Ponet seems unduly harsh.<br>
<br>Meanwhile a more embarrassing, but surprisingly less remarked problem arose in relation to Ponet's marriage, when the couple were arraigned on charges of bigamy. It transpired that the supposed Mistress Ponet was the wife of a Nottingham butcher&#151;a social as well as a legal misalliance. The consistory court sitting in St Paul's Cathedral pronounced a formal separation in late July 1551, leaving Ponet free except for the annual payment of a sum of money to the woman's husband. He soon made a much more suitable marriage, at Croydon parish church on 25 October, with Cranmer in attendance. His bride, Mary, was the daughter of the archbishop's &#145;leading fiscal officer&#146;  (MacCulloch, 325), Peter Hayman, a Kentish gentleman long known to Ponet. Curiously, Ponet's opponent in the argument over clerical marriage, Thomas Martyn, mentioned nothing about this in his book of 1554.<br>
<br>To the end Ponet was identified with the doctrinal innovations of the Edwardian regime. Partly at the request of the duke of Northumberland he wrote the text for the new catechism, eventually published in May 1553 after some delays and amid continuing uncertainty as to its authorization. His movements at the time of Mary's accession remain largely speculative. He claimed that efforts were made to convince him to conform to the new order, but he refused, was ejected from his see and was eventually deprived for being married. He was apparently imprisoned, but the date and duration of this is unknown. John Stow claimed that Ponet was deeply involved in Wyatt's rebellion, only leaving when it became clear that the rising was doomed. While this later led to accusations of cowardice, Stow is the only source for the story: Bale, who was in a position to know, does not mention it. Although it is known that it was the policy of Gardiner (who had been reinstalled at Winchester) to allow as many protestants as wished it to leave surreptitiously rather than be prosecuted, it seems unlikely that Ponet was one of these, especially if he had been involved in rebellion. In any case, Ponet seems to have made his escape some time after Wyatt's failure.<br>
<br>Ponet settled in the German city of Strasbourg, where he and his wife baptized a child in 1554, and where he was granted citizenship in February 1555. Apart from the house fire, nothing is known of his sojourn there or his position within the community of English exiles. Suggestions that he was deeply involved in the troubles of the sister community at Frankfurt am Main prove unfounded. He does not seem to have been too troubled by exile, writing about it to Heinrich Bullinger in the most sanguine terms, but he was certainly not idle. In 1556 he published <span class="italic">An Apologie Fully Answeringe &hellip; a Blasphemous Book</span>, another contribution to the debate on clerical marriage directed at Gardiner, and his most important work, <span class="italic">A Shorte Treatise of Politike Power</span>. While most protestant thinkers struggled with the topical issue of obedience to civil authority when that authority was opposed to &#145;true religion&#146;, <span class="italic">A Shorte Treatise</span> was an innovative and forceful statement of the lawfulness of forcible resistance. Starting from the radical protestant standpoint that rulers were called by God to discharge a particular office and &#145;ordained to do good, not evil&#146;  (Skinner, 222), Ponet considered the case of a ruler who had instead inflicted grievous injuries on his people. Drawing on the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, on civil and canon law, on John of Salisbury's <span class="italic">Policraticus</span>, and on Thomas Aquinas, Ponet argued that such a ruler had exceeded his office and demanded what was unlawful. He thus should be treated as a normal criminal and punished accordingly. Having discussed in detail particular instances of the magistrate abusing his office, most notably that where he &#145;goes about to betray and make away his country to foreigners&#146;  (ibid., 224), evidently at least in part a comment on contemporary England, Ponet concluded that a duty of resistance might in the most notorious cases extend to deposition and even tyrannicide.<br>
<br>Ponet died at Strasbourg in August 1556. Greatly admired by his protestant contemporaries and seen by John Foxe, John Strype, and others as one of the more important reformers late in the reign of Edward VI, Ponet's peculiar marital arrangements, and the accusations of avarice during his career and of cowardice at the end of it, have since tended to overshadow his reputation. He was vilified by S. R. Maitland in the nineteenth century and called &#145;quarrelsome, avaricious, unscrupulous and a coward&#146; in the twentieth  (Garrett, 253). Given his equivocal but potentially significant standing, it is surprising that no detailed biography of him appeared before 1942.<br>
