<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Chesterton,  Gilbert Keith</span> <span class="st"> [G. K. C.]</span>  (1874&#150;1936), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 29 May 1874 at 32 Sheffield Terrace, Campden Hill, London, the elder son of Edward Chesterton (<i>d</i>. 1922), estate agent, and his wife, Marie Louise, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Grosjean (<i>d</i>. 1933). His maternal grandfather's family were of Swiss French origin, though they had been in England for several generations; his maternal grandmother came from an Aberdeen family called Keith&#151;hence Chesterton's second name. Gilbert Chesterton had, as he emphasized in his <span class="italic">Autobiography</span> (1936), a sheltered and happy childhood in a comfortable middle-class home, where his interests in art and literature were encouraged by his parents. The only shadow was the death of a sister whom he was barely old enough to remember. When he was five the birth of his brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37276/', "Cecil Edward Chesterton (1879&#150;1918)")</script>, brought him a companion and, when they were older, a sparring partner in argument.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlyliterarylife"></a>Education and early literary life</h2>Chesterton was a dreamy, absent-minded, untidy child, and he preserved these attributes throughout his life. He was a slow developer, not speaking until he was nearly three, and not reading until he was eight. But thereafter he was a passionate reader, particularly of fairy-tales. He was also devoted to toy theatres, and remained so throughout his life. At school&#151;Colet Court, Hammersmith, and then St Paul's School&#151;it was clear that he was formidably intelligent, but he was a wayward student who could not focus on topics he did not find interesting or important. He was happy at school, as he had been at home; he made lasting friendships and was a dedicated member of the St Paul's School debating society, for a love of argument was one of his abiding characteristics. When he was eighteen he enrolled for classes in English, French, and Latin at University College, London, and in art at the Slade School of Fine Art, which was then part of the college. His college career was much less happy than his school-days. He was not at ease with organized academic learning, and at the Slade he experienced some kind of psychological disturbance which he subsequently hinted at but never explained. Chesterton first thought of making a career in art, but soon found that his real gifts and inclination were for writing. Nevertheless, he continued to produce drawings for his own amusement and that of his friends, such as his entertaining illustrations to Hilaire Belloc's novels.<br>
<br>After leaving college in 1895 Chesterton worked as a publisher's reader while launching himself as a man of letters. In the 1890s the periodical press offered many opportunities to a clever and energetic young man who wanted to live by his pen and he took advantage of them. Before long he was making his name as a reviewer and essayist and was contributing regular columns to two Liberal papers: the weekly <span class="italic">The Speaker</span> and the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>. (He had inherited something of the spirit of Gladstonian Liberalism from his father.) In 1900 he published his first books, two collections of poems; one of his early poems, &#145;The Donkey&#146;, became a favourite anthology piece. In the same year he met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30699/', "Hilaire Belloc")</script>, the Anglo-French writer and polemicist, who became a friend and literary ally. Chesterton tended to hero-worship Belloc and was strongly but not always fortunately influenced by him.<br>
<br>Collections of periodical essays followed in the early 1900s, and in 1903 Chesterton published his most substantial work to date, a study of Robert Browning, in the prestigious <span class="roman">English Men of Letters</span> series. That he was invited to write it while still only in his twenties was a sign of his growing celebrity. The book was well received by ordinary readers but not by Browning experts, who objected to its biographical inaccuracies and frequent misquotations. Chesterton was habitually careless about questions of fact, but <span class="italic">Robert Browning</span> contains acute discussions of Browning's poetry; among many other things, Chesterton was an excellent literary critic. Nevertheless, the book's real interest is the extent to which he identifies with his subject, and the clues it offers to his later development. When he wrote it he was more than a young man embarking on a successful literary career. He was also engaged in a personal struggle to make sense of the world, a struggle which marked all his writing. He emphatically rejected the pessimism, positivism, and determinism which he saw as marking the late nineteenth century, and turned to those writers who were optimists and in love with life and the world, such as Whitman and Stevenson, and Browning, of whom he wrote, &#145;In discussing anything, he must always fall back upon great speculative and eternal ideas&#146;  (<span class="italic">Robert Browning</span>, 1903, 118). This may or may not have been true of Browning, but it was entirely true of Chesterton. He saw Browning's love of nature and delight in human diversity as implying and resting on a belief in God.<br>
<br>Although Chesterton's family was nominally Anglican, and he had been baptized in the Church of England, he had grown up in an ethos of reverent humanism and knew very little of traditional Christian beliefs. As a very young man he had become agnostic for a time, but the sense he had found in Browning that life is splendid but somehow incomplete led him to work out a religion for himself which, he was astonished to discover, already existed in the form of orthodox Christianity. In 1896 he met and fell in love with Frances Alice Blogg (1870/71&#150;1938), to whom he was introduced by a schoolfriend who later married her sister. Frances was the daughter of a diamond merchant who was deceased, and her family was of French descent, having originally been called de Blogue. She was a devout Anglo-Catholic and her beliefs reinforced and directed Chesterton's Christian convictions. He became a believing though not very fervently practising Anglican, but it was some time before his religious allegiance was apparent to the public. He and Frances were married on 28 June 1901.<h2>
<a name="Chestertonsfiction"></a>Chesterton's fiction</h2>In 1904 Chesterton published his first novel, <span class="italic">The Napoleon of Notting Hill</span>, a strange and original fantasy which reviewers appreciated even if some of them were baffled by it. It describes how at some point in the future, in the reign of the whimsical joker King Auberon, the various London boroughs have become separate city states on the model of Renaissance Italy. One of them, Notting Hill, resists the demands of its neighbours to build a new road through its territory, goes to war with them, and wins. Although the fantasy is engaging, <span class="italic">The Napoleon of Notting Hill</span> is a serious novel of ideas on the theme summed up much later in the century as &#145;small is beautiful&#146;, and was partly inspired by Chesterton's pro-Boer stance during the South African War. King Auberon and Adam Wayne, the fiery young provost of Notting Hill, argue throughout the story; Maisie Ward has said that they &#145;are the most living individuals in any of his novels&#151;just because they are the two lobes of his brain individualized&#146;  (Ward, 1958 edn, 127). That is to say, they embody his opposed sides of profound gravity and exuberant fooling, which often united in a pun or an arresting paradox.<br>
<br>Chesterton's next novel, <span class="italic">The Man who was Thursday</span> (1908), is another ingenious fantasy on serious themes; it is his most obscure novel but it is also his most popular. It shows each member of a group of anarchists who are plotting to overthrow established society in London being successively revealed as a police detective employed to spy on the rest. The novel expresses his concern with the perennial war between order and chaos, and its riddling quality gives it some affinities with Kafka. But a lively pace is maintained as the plot unfolds, with energetic adventures and fights and chases. This is also true of his subsequent novels, <span class="italic">The Ball and the Cross</span> (1910), <span class="italic">Manalive</span> (1912), and <span class="italic">The Flying Inn</span> (1914), though they have worn less well. <span class="italic">Manalive</span>, in which the hero travels all round the world to break into his own house and fall in love with his own wife, exemplifies Chesterton's conviction that the greatest possible adventure is the rediscovery of the familiar.<br>
<br>Chesterton's best-known fiction, however, is to be found in the <span class="roman">Father Brown</span> stories, of which the first collection, <span class="italic">The Innocence of Father Brown</span>, appeared in 1911. Here he introduces one of the most famous of literary detectives, the insignificant-seeming little Roman Catholic priest, Father Brown, who is possessed of formidable powers of observation and ratiocination, and whose work as a confessor has given him a deep insight into human nature and the criminal mentality in particular. The restricted compass of the short story meant that Chesterton had to condense his writing, avoiding the stretches of improvised action which sometimes pad out the novels. This first collection had several successors; in later years if Chesterton was in urgent need of money he would sit down and write another Father Brown story. Often adapted for film and television, the character was memorably played by Alec Guinness in Robert Hamer's film <span class="italic">Father Brown</span> (1954).<br>
<br>In whatever genre he wrote Chesterton was at heart an essayist, pursuing profound or whimsical reflections about life and the world. He produced innumerable short essays for newspapers and magazines and regularly collected them into books. His <span class="italic">Charles Dickens</span> (1906) is a tribute to a writer for whom, like Browning, he felt a considerable affinity; it remains a valuable contribution to the study of Dickens and was followed by <span class="italic">Appreciations and Criticisms of the Works of Charles Dickens</span> (1911), which discusses individual novels. Chesterton's <span class="italic">The Victorian Age in Literature</span> (1913) shows him at his best as a literary critic&#151;impressionistic, aphoristic, presenting familiar works in a new light. He continued to write poetry in a broadly Pre-Raphaelite vein, working for several years on an epic poem in ballad form, <span class="italic">The Ballad of the White Horse</span>, published in 1911, which describes a desperate but ultimately victorious battle fought by the Christian King Alfred against the pagan Danish invaders. Its fervent English patriotism made it popular during both world wars.<h2>
<a name="GKC"></a>&#145;G. K. C.&#146;</h2>In the years leading up to 1914 Chesterton's fame was at its height. He was celebrated not only as a writer but also as a public figure, &#145;G. K. C.&#146;, of unmistakable presence and appearance; as a youth he had been slender, in his twenties he was corpulent, and by his thirties he was obese. His wife encouraged him to wear a cloak and a wide-brimmed hat, and although he was the admired author of many books, he liked to regard himself as a journalist and to frequent the taverns and newspaper offices of Fleet Street, his pockets full of books and papers and proofs. He was seen as a latter-day Dr Johnson, and something of a living myth; in D. J. Conlon's words, he was &#145;the fat man in the cloak and the brigand's hat forever stopping for a pork pie and a beer while he scribbled yet another poem or article on his cuff or on the back of a sugar packet&#146;  (Conlon, xxiii). Eventually Frances Chesterton decided that her husband would be better off out of London and the temptations of Fleet Street, and in 1909 the Chestertons moved to Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire, which was within easy access of London but far enough away to keep Chesterton from its distractions. He was notoriously unable to cope with the practicalities of day-to-day living and needed his wife to organize his life for him. It was by all accounts a happy marriage, though the Chestertons were saddened by not having children. His sister-in-law Ada Chesterton, who did not like Frances, implied that it had never been consummated, but this seems unlikely, if only because Frances was on one occasion receiving medical treatment for infertility. As if to compensate for having none of his own, Chesterton loved children and delighted in organizing games and entertainments with them.<br>
<br>Chesterton was famous for his exploitation of paradox. It had been a favourite mode in the 1890s, when he came to maturity, in the work of Wilde and Shaw and Max Beerbohm; his achievement was to adapt this literary inheritance to produce paradoxes which were not merely witty or startling but challenging in a philosophical or religious way. At its simplest, Chestertonian paradox involved seeing familiar things from an unfamiliar angle, so that a glass of water which is half empty is also, remarkably, half full; the one description might be called pessimistic, the other optimistic. In a more directly philosophical fashion, the difference between things implies a measure of similarity, in order for the comparison to be possible. And central to Christian belief is the traditional paradox, to which Chesterton often returned, of an incarnate God who is born as a helpless infant and dies an ignominious death.<br>
<br>In 1905 Chesterton published <span class="italic">Heretics</span>, a spirited collection of studies of contemporary writers. A critic complained that although Chesterton had discussed their fundamental attitudes to life, he had been reticent about exposing his own. <span class="italic">Orthodoxy</span> (1908) is a direct response to this challenge. With a wealth of paradoxes and parables he describes his progress towards Christian belief, and his ultimate conviction that the world is good and meaningful and something to be grateful for; &#145;And last, and strangest, there had come into my mind a vague and vast impression that in some way all good was a remnant to be stored and held sacred out of some primordial ruin&#146;  (<span class="italic">Orthodoxy</span>, 1934, 116). <span class="italic">Orthodoxy</span> remains one of his finest books, and one of his most personal.<br>
<br>In the first decades of the twentieth century Chesterton was closely associated in public opinion with Hilaire Belloc, and Bernard Shaw coined the term &#145;the Chesterbelloc&#146;, referring to them as a compound beast. In fact they were temperamentally very different, whatever their shared religious and social ideals. Chesterton, a man of exceptional good nature, was always generous and charitable to those he disagreed with, whereas Belloc was a harsh and unforgiving controversialist; Chesterton was also influenced by his younger brother Cecil, a polemical journalist who joined with Belloc in fierce attacks on the English establishment, particularly after the Marconi scandal of 1913, when members of the Liberal government were accused of financial corruption. To Chesterton's lasting distress his brother found himself in the dock at the Old Bailey charged with criminal libel, and he narrowly escaped imprisonment. Chesterton had little sense of politics and public affairs, and he took over uncritically Belloc's mythicized versions of European and English history, and his idealization of the Latin and Catholic nations, particularly France, his hatred of anything Germanic, and his conviction that English capitalism was the direct result of the rift with Rome and the despoliation of the monasteries.<br>
<br>Chesterton also absorbed from Belloc and from his brother the antisemitism which disfigures his work, though he lived long enough to be horrified by the antisemitic programme which Hitler started putting into effect in Germany after 1933. Belloc was a pugnacious Roman Catholic who thought that the church was the only source of order and sanity in the world, and Cecil Chesterton was a convert. Many readers thought that Chesterton would go the same way, given the spirit of his writings, but it was many years before he did so (Belloc thought that he never would); a reluctance to distress his Anglo-Catholic wife may have been an element in the delay.<h2>
<a name="Lateryears"></a>Later years</h2>By 1914, which marked the end of the Edwardian era, Chesterton had done the best of his purely imaginative writing, though important religious works were to follow. In the autumn of 1914 he fell gravely ill and barely survived; he was confined to bed for several months and unconscious for much of the time. Eventually he recovered and resumed his literary career, though his wartime writing is not distinguished. There are propagandist tirades against Germany and in favour of France, and <span class="italic">A Short History of England</span> (1917) is Bellocian in its approach and without any dates in it. Between 1918 and 1920 he visited Ireland, Palestine, and the United States, and in 1922 he was finally received into the Roman Catholic church, after years as a fellow traveller. He was triumphantly welcomed by his new co-religionists; four years later Frances Chesterton took the same step.<br>
<br>In the year of his conversion Chesterton published <span class="italic">St Francis of Assisi</span>. As in his literary biographies, he vividly evokes his subject and demonstrates a strong identification with him; his Francis is an essentially paradoxical figure, both deeply ascetic and deeply in love with the created world. This book was followed by <span class="italic">The Everlasting Man</span> (1925), which moves on from the metaphysical theism of <span class="italic">Orthodoxy</span> to a profound reflection on the nature of Christ. Maisie Ward has described these two books as &#145;the highest expression of Gilbert's mysticism&#146;  (Ward, 1958 edn, 311).<br>
<br>At the end of 1918 Chesterton's life had been darkened by the death of his brother from an illness acquired on active service. He vowed to continue Cecil Chesterton's weekly, the <span class="italic">New Witness</span>, and did so until his death, though it later became <span class="italic">GK's Weekly</span>. His wife and friends deplored this commitment, since he was not a natural editor, and it made heavy demands on him for both money, to keep it afloat, and time, since he wrote much of its content himself. During the 1920s he was also active with Belloc in the distributist movement, which aimed for a middle way between capitalism and socialism by ensuring the widest possible distribution of property. It is not surprising that his later writings show signs of fatigue; the use of paradox, originally so surprising and provocative, becomes repetitive and predictable, and he is given to setting up and then demolishing straw men. Even at its best his late prose can resemble a baroque sermon, spinning endless significance out of a simple truth. At the start of his career Chesterton had enjoyed the pleasures of intellectual opposition, using his rhetorical and stylistic skills to undermine materialism and liberal protestantism. As an eminent Roman Catholic layman, praised and honoured in the church, his writing was directed to defending and expounding Catholicism in all its aspects. As his critical Catholic admirer Christopher Hollis put it:<blockquote>this robbed his writing of that power of surprise which was itself one of its main attractions. Of the early Chesterton one never knew what he was going to say. Of the later Chesterton one always knew what he was going to say. (Hollis, 221&#150;2)</blockquote>Two of his late books are important. <span class="italic">Chaucer</span> (1932) turns the poet into a familiar Chestertonian figure but is written out of intense devotion and makes an effective introduction. <span class="italic">St Thomas Aquinas</span> (1933) provides a parallel to his earlier study of St Francis, focusing on the saintly philosopher rather than the saintly poet. Although Chesterton had no philosophical training, his book shows his intuitive grasp of Aquinas; the Thomist insistence that <i>ens</i>, or being, is the starting point of all philosophy was what he had sensed in his early conviction that existence is inherently valuable. A distinguished Thomist, &Eacute;tienne Gilson, praised the book for having achieved a deeper insight into Aquinas than the professional philosophers.<br>
<br>Chesterton's last years were made easier by his secretary Dorothy Collins, who brought order into his tangled literary and business affairs; she was also his chauffeur (in effect, an adopted daughter to the childless couple) who drove Chesterton and his wife on holidays and lecture tours in Britain and Europe. But his health was not robust; he was overweight and dropsical, and in 1936 he succumbed to heart and kidney failure. Chesterton died on 14 June 1936 at his home, Top Meadow, Beaconsfield, and was buried on 17 June at Beaconsfield. His wife survived him.<br>
