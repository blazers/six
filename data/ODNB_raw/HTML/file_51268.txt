<span class="headword">Ormrod, Sir  Roger Fray Greenwood</span>  (1911&#150;1992), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born in Whitehaven, Cumberland, on 20 October 1911, the son of Oliver Fray Ormrod, a solicitor, and his wife, Edith Muriel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pim. He was educated at Shrewsbury School (1924&#150;9), and the Queen's College, Oxford (1930&#150;33), where he read medicine and jurisprudence, obtaining his degree in the latter. He was called to the bar in 1936, when he joined the busy chambers of Edward (later Lord) Pearce in the Temple. On 9 April 1938 he married (Doris) Anne Lush (<i>b</i>. 1905/6), a magistrate and marriage guidance counsellor.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of war in 1939 Ormrod completed his medical training at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, where he became house physician in 1941. In 1942 he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps and served in Normandy and north-west Europe. He returned to the bar in 1945, became a QC in 1958, and was appointed a judge of the High Court (Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty Division) in 1961, in which year he also received a knighthood. His medical background influenced his career in the law, and he retained links with medicine through his active membership of several medical institutions. He was elected FRCP in 1969 and an honorary FRCPsych in 1975.<br>
<br>For his first ten years on the bench Ormrod administered the unreformed divorce laws, which required proof of a &#145;matrimonial offence&#146; before a divorce could be granted. In 1969 he tried the nullity case of <i>Corbett v. Corbett</i> ([1971] P83), in which he held that marriage in England involved the union of persons of the opposite sex, and consequently where one party had undergone a sex change the marriage was a nullity, since the wife was &#145;not a woman for the purposes of marriage but a biological male and had been since birth&#146;.<br>
<br>Ormrod welcomed the reform of the divorce laws in 1971, which replaced the matrimonial offence as the sole ground of divorce with the breakdown of the marriage, and when the Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty Division became the Family Division. Unlike some of his judicial brethren Ormrod took the view that this was a radical change in the law, and for the next eleven years, both at first instance and as a lord justice of the Court of Appeal, to which he was appointed in 1974, he was responsible, practically single-handedly, for the development of family law following the 1971 legislation. An early example of his approach was the case of <i>Wachtel v. Wachtel</i> ([1973] Fam 72), when he said: &#145;Shares in responsibility for breakdown cannot be properly assessed without a meticulous examination and understanding of the spouses concerned, the more thorough the investigation the more the shares will in most cases approach equality.&#146; He concluded that, in financial proceedings, conduct usually proved to be a marginal issue &#145;unless it is both obvious and gross&#146;.<br>
<br>Nowhere was Ormrod's influence more decisive than in cases relating to children. Although since 1925 judges had paid lip-service to the statutory requirement that the welfare of the child was the &#145;first and paramount consideration&#146;, attempts were made to modify the consequences of this rule by considerations of the conduct of the parents, weight being given to the wishes of an &#145;unimpeachable spouse&#146;. In <i>S v. S</i> ([1977] 1AER 656), Ormrod said: &#145;The phrase unimpeachable cannot mean a parent who is beyond criticism because there is no such thing.&#146;<br>
<br>Some, who had not had Ormrod's experience of trying long, defended divorce cases directed to the respective blameworthiness of the spouses, thought that the pendulum had swung too far in disregarding matrimonial conduct, causing injustice to the &#145;innocent&#146; spouse, especially husbands and fathers. Ormrod defended his approach in his presidential address to the Holdsworth Club in 1980, when he said: &#145;In the great majority of cases, the closer the investigation the clearer it becomes that the practicalities point to the mother as the parent who should have the care of the children; and consequently the person who will need the house.&#146; And he went on to refer to one of his favourite dicta: &#145;It takes three to commit adultery. I always ask what has the &#147;innocent&#148; party done or failed to do?&#146;<br>
<br>Ormrod was, in his own field of family law, one of the great reforming judges of the twentieth century whose influence on that branch of the law was profound and extended over more than thirty years. He was not concerned with the past history of a marriage, but always looked ahead to the future and the consequence of a divorce, above all to the welfare of the children and the financial support of the mother. His approach was essentially pragmatic and practical. He refused to allow the Family Division to become a court of morals. Ormrod had perhaps the most original mind of any of his contemporaries in the Court of Appeal except Lord Denning. His mind worked with astonishing rapidity, and he was a fluent and rapid speaker. On the bench, when dealing with matrimonial cases, he often appeared impatient and intolerant of what he regarded as irrelevancies, but this was on account of his profound knowledge of his subject, the speed and clarity with which he saw the nub of the problem, and, above all, his anxiety that he might not be able to do justice within the constraints of the law.<br>
<br>After his retirement in 1982 Ormrod threw himself into his many extramural activities, including the Notting Hill Housing Trust, of which he was chairman for twenty years, and was able to spend more time on Exmoor, where he had a house. He died at his home, 4 Aubrey Road, Kensington, on 6 January 1992, and was cremated. He left his widow, an adopted daughter, and several young people who had benefited from the kindness and generosity of him and his wife.<br>
