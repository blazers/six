<span class="headword">Nuttall,  Thomas</span>  (1828&#150;1890), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born in London on 7 October 1828, was son of George R. Nuttall MD, one of the physicians of the Westminster Dispensary. His mother was daughter of Mr Mansfield of Midmar Castle, Aberdeenshire. He was sent to a private school at Aberdeen, but his character is said to have been formed chiefly by his mother, a good and clever woman. He sailed for India as an infantry cadet on 2 August 1845, and was posted as ensign in the 29th Bombay native infantry from that date. He became lieutenant in the regiment on 26 June 1847 and captain on 23 November 1856. From December 1851 to November 1856 he was adjutant of his regiment. As captain of the regimental light company, he was detached with the light battalion of the army in the Persian expedition of 1857. He returned to Bombay in May that year, and in August rejoined his regiment at Belgaum.<br>
<br>During the Indian mutiny and after, from 9 November 1857 to 25 March 1861, Nuttall was detached on special police duty against disaffected Bhils and Kolis in the Nasik districts. He organized and disciplined a corps of one of the most war-like peoples of the Deccan, the Kolis of the Western Ghats, which did excellent service and was engaged in many skirmishes. The assistant collector at Nasik reported that the dispersion of the Bhil rebels and the prompt suppression of the Peint rebellion were entirely due to Nuttall's exertions, and for two years he and his men endured much hardship and privation. He five times received the commendation of government.<br>
<br>From June 1860 to August 1865 Nuttall was police superintendent successively at Kaira, Sholapur, and Kaladgi, having in the meantime been transferred to the Bombay staff corps (June 1865). He received the brevet of major in the same year. In September 1865 he went on sick leave to England, and returned to India in April 1867, when he resumed his police duties at Kaladgi, and in October was appointed second in command of the Land Transport Corps in the Abyssinian expedition, with which he did good service at Koumeylee; he was mentioned in dispatches and promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel. From August 1868 to February 1871 he served with the 25th Bombay native infantry, and from April 1871 to April 1876 with the 22nd Bombay native infantry as second in command and then as commanding officer, during a portion of which time (from 8 May to 30 October 1871) he was in temporary command of the Neemuch brigade. He became lieutenant-colonel on 2 August 1871 and brevet colonel on 3 December 1873. On 5 April 1876 he became acting commandant, and on 25 January 1877 commandant, of the Sind frontier force, with headquarters at Jacobabad.<br>
<br>On 20 November 1878 Nuttall was appointed brigadier-general in the Afghan expeditionary force, and commanded his brigade in the Pishin valley and at the occupation of Kandahar. After the departure of Sir Michael Biddulph and Lieutenant-General Sir Donald Stewart he commanded the brigade of all arms left for the occupation of Kandahar. After the 2nd division of the army was broken up he commanded a brigade left at Vitakri until 17 May, when it also was broken up, and he returned to his post on the Upper Sind frontier. When the Anglo-Afghan War entered its second phase Nuttall was appointed brigadier-general of the cavalry brigade formed at Kandahar in May 1880, and commanded it in the action at Girishk, on the Helmand, on 14 July 1880, in the cavalry affair of the 23rd, and in the disastrous battle of Maiwand on 27 July, after which he was criticized for his handling of his brigade. He was in the sortie of 16 August from Kandahar (mentioned in dispatches), commanded the east face of the city during the defence (mentioned in dispatches), and took part in the battle of Kandahar and pursuit of the Afghan army on 1 September 1880. He became a major-general in 1885 and lieutenant-general in 1887.<br>
<br>Nuttall was a popular, active, and energetic officer. Although not an outstanding cavalry leader he was one of the best riders and swordsmen in the Indian army, a frequent competitor at, as well as patron of, contests in skill at arms, and a renowned shikari with hogspear and rifle. He married, at Camberwell, London, on 7 February 1867, Caroline Latimer Elliot, daughter of Dr Elliot of Denmark Hill, and they had a son. Nuttall died at Newton Farm, Wardhouse, Insch, Aberdeenshire, on 30 August 1890.<br>
