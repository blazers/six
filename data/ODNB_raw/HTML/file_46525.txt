<span class="headword">Jones, Sir  Pendrill Charles  Varrier-</span>  (1883&#150;1941), <span class="occ">physician and founder of Papworth village settlement</span>, was born at Glyn Taff House, Troedyrhiw, Glamorgan, on 24 February 1883, the only son of Charles Morgan Jones, surgeon, and Margaret Varrier, daughter of William Jenkins. He had one sister. He was educated at Epsom College, and at St John's College, Cambridge, where he was a foundation scholar and prizewinner in 1905 and 1906. He attended medical school at St Bartholomew's Hospital, and qualified MRCS, LRCP in 1910, becoming house surgeon at St Bartholomew's in 1911. In 1912 he returned to Cambridge to undertake research on the significance of temperature variation in tuberculosis, under the guidance of Sir German Sims Woodhead and Sir Clifford Allbutt. On the outbreak of war in 1914 he was appointed temporary tuberculosis officer for Cambridgeshire and there became aware of the psychological, social, and economic consequences of loss of employment resulting from tuberculosis. Supported by Allbutt and Sims Woodhead, he formulated the idea of setting up an industrial colony where people with arrested tuberculosis could work under medical supervision. In 1915 Allbutt set up the Cambridge Tuberculosis After-Care Association to raise funds for the project. In a manner which was to typify his later business dealings, Varrier-Jones bypassed the committee and &#145;begged, bullied and cajoled &pound;603 out of local worthies&#146;  (Parker, 138). In February 1916 the Cambridgeshire Tuberculosis Colony was set up, with one patient, in an open-air shelter at Bourne.<br>
<br>In 1918 the colony, with 25 patients, moved to the newly purchased Papworth Hall at Papworth Everard, Cambridgeshire. Varrier-Jones was to remain medical director of Papworth village settlement until his death in 1941, by which time the settlement had 500 patients in the hospital and a further 700 in hostels or cottages. The complex included 500 acres of land, with administration and hospital blocks, a sanatorium, laboratories and research institute, a home for tuberculosis nursing staff, a village settlement of more than a hundred cottages and hostels, and workshops. Papworth Industries (which included carpentry, cabinetmaking, leather goods, printing, upholstery, and building concerns) employed ex-patients at trade union rates and under medical supervision, and showed annual sales amounting to over &pound;88,000 per annum by 1941. Papworth village settlement and Varrier-Jones became world famous. One history of the institution claimed that the list of visitors read like <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> (Ives and Ives). Papworth's annual magazine in 1942 boasted that well over 5000 visitors had come from overseas  (<span class="italic">Papworth Annual</span>, 7). Varrier-Jones himself was a great publicist for Papworth, lecturing and publishing widely throughout his career. His contributions included <span class="italic">Industrial Colonies and Village Settlements for the Consumptive</span>, published jointly with Sims Woodhead in 1920 (with a preface by Allbutt), on tuberculosis village settlements. In 1927 he delivered the Mitchell lecture to the Royal College of Physicians, in London, and in 1937 he addressed the first Empire Conference in London, on the care and aftercare of the tuberculous. Varrier-Jones was knighted in 1931 for his contributions to tuberculosis. In 1934 he was appointed fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, and in 1939 he was awarded the Weber-Parkes prize for tuberculosis. Sir Humphry Rolleston noted that his &#145;great assets were his organizing ability and his exceptional capacity as a good man of business&#146;  (Rolleston, 9). Not only was Varrier-Jones responsible for turning Papworth into a large and successful institution, he also helped to build up two other village settlements for tuberculosis patients: Preston Hall, in 1919, at the request of the British Legion; and Peamount, near Dublin, in 1930, at the request of Lady Aberdeen. In 1919 he also helped Sir Frederick Milner to re-establish an industrial village in Hampshire&#151;Enham Village Centre&#151;for ex-servicemen with nervous diseases.<br>
<br>Varrier-Jones never married. However, he reigned over Papworth village settlement as a paternal figure. The patients affectionately called him the Old Man or Father, and one described him as a benevolent autocrat: &#145;when you saw him you had to tug your forelock&#146;  (<span class="roman">Papworth Village Settlement Archives</span>, G2.16). According to another patient, he had an uncanny knack of sizing up a man's personality and character simply by his answers to searching questions. One patient considered that &#145;his word was law; no red tape and no other channels to go through&#146;  (ibid., G1.6). As leader of the settlement, Varrier-Jones enjoyed the loyal support of his staff, including that of Miss K. L. Borne, matron from 1915 to 1943, who was appointed OBE for her work at Papworth in 1942. She retired two years after Varrier-Jones's death.<br>
<br>Varrier-Jones died at Papworth of heart disease on 30 January 1941. His obituary in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> described him as a Celt with all the Celt's fire and imagination, and with the long black hair and gestures of an impresario. He was also commonly known as the Pendragon, which later became the trademark of Papworth goods. Not only did his &#145;family&#146; mourn his death, but tributes were paid to his vision in the care of tuberculosis patients and in particular to his belief in holistic medicine. The idea of placing the victims of the disease in isolated colonies such as Papworth was neither financially nor socially viable on a large scale, but the experiment was regarded as important, for Varrier-Jones's conception of illness as not only a medical but also a social problem.<br>
