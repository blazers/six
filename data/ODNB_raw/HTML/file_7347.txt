<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dawson,  George</span>  (1821&#150;1876), <span class="occ">preacher and political activist</span>, was born at 36 Hunter Street, London, on 24 February 1821, the son of a radical Baptist schoolmaster, Jonathan Dawson, and his wife, Rachel Biggs. He was educated, and later became a pupil teacher and then classics master, at his father's school, where for a time Charles Dickens was a fellow pupil. He abandoned a course at Marischal College, Aberdeen, in disgust in 1838, but graduated MA at Glasgow University in 1841: here he had been active in the University Liberal Association. He was called to the pastorate of Rickmansworth Baptist Church in 1843 but soon left, driven out, it was said, by the tory squire. In September 1844 he moved to Mount Zion Baptist Chapel, Birmingham, which he soon filled to overflowing by his brilliant, unorthodox addresses in which, among other things, he lauded Voltaire and cast doubts on the Christian character of Calvin. He left Mount Zion in 1846, ostensibly on the open communion issue, but in reality because his advanced teaching conflicted with the evangelical feelings of the older church members. On 24 August 1846 he married Susan Fanny Crompton; their two children were Rachel Anne (1848&#150;1873), who was mentally handicapped, and Bernard (1851&#150;1905), who became a civil engineer.<br>
<br>&#145;To get religion out of the pale of the chapel into the fresh air of heaven and give it full exercise in that world which it came to beautify and animate&#146;, the church of the Saviour was built for Dawson by his many admirers and opened in August 1848. Here this handsome, charismatic orator, dressed more like a poet than a preacher, conducted worship from a platform, preaching a gospel of service and brotherhood, based on the example of Christ. But the &#145;chapel of the doubters&#146;, as it was called, was no plain lecture hall. It was brightly painted and adorned with flowers; its musical standards were high&#151;it had a paid choir of twelve singers, and its own book of chants, anthems, and hymns (3rd edn, edited by Dawson and T. H. Gill, 1853). Dawson's prayers were beautifully crafted and the liturgy of the Christian year was observed. Popular Saturday evening concerts were held, as well as lectures for working people, adult classes, and church social gatherings&#151;at that time a startling novelty. In all of these activities Susan Dawson played a prominent role. As a lecturer Dawson was in great demand, both within and outside Birmingham; in Manchester he was particularly popular. He accompanied Carlyle on his first visit to Germany and witnessed with Emerson a phase of the 1848 revolution in Paris. Later his chief significance may have been to popularize Carlyle's and Emerson's thought for the English middle and artisan classes.<br>
<br>Dawson was a friend of many continental radicals, especially Kossuth, the Hungarian nationalist, whom he greeted on his arrival in Britain in 1851. Out of this incident arose the curious Van Beck affair, when Dawson's fervent support for the Hungarian nationalist cause landed him in court, where he incurred a &pound;500 fine. But Dawson was no stranger to controversy. In 1846 he crossed swords with the doughty evangelical Anglican Hugh Stowell of Manchester, who had accused him of spouting &#145;grandiloquent neologistic nonsense&#146;. He clashed with the archbishop of York in 1847, the same year as the evangelical Congregationalist John Angell James arranged a secret meeting with Dawson in an effort to convert him.<br>
<br>In the life of Birmingham, Dawson's role was diverse. His friends and admirers on three separate occasions backed new local newspapers with Dawson as editor: the <span class="italic">Birmingham Mercury</span> (1848), the <span class="italic">Daily Free Press</span> (1855), and the <span class="italic">Birmingham Morning News</span> (1871). But none of these lasted long, for Dawson, who excelled as a flamboyant, if rather repetitious, orator, was far less at home with the written word. However, his contribution to the public library movement was undeniable: the Birmingham free libraries of the 1860s, the central lending library (1865), and the central reference library (1866) owed their inspiration to him and his friend Sam Timmins, as did the large Shakespeare collection housed in the reference library. He was one of the most active promoters of the Early Closing Association to reduce the excessive hours of Birmingham shop workers, and also of a campaign dubbed &#145;Lungs for the City&#146;, which helped to secure Aston Park as a public recreation area in 1858. It is perhaps as a precursor of Chamberlain and the municipal reform programme of the 1870s that Dawson is chiefly important in Birmingham's history. Most of the political remedies later popularized by Chamberlain he had anticipated&#151;smallholdings (the Midland Freehold Land Association of 1847), secular schooling, extension of the franchise, sanitary reform, and slum clearance&#151;while the Arts Club (1873), which he helped to found, was the forerunner of the Birmingham Liberal Club (1879). More generally it was his vision of God as pitying father and humanity as a prodigal son, and his profound engagement with discerning the mystery of order in the midst of man-made chaos, which gave ideological underpinning to the whole school of municipal reform: the church of the Saviour produced seventeen town councillors during Dawson's pastorate and, of these, six became mayor.<br>
<br>Dawson's fame as an emotional, witty, controversial, and thoroughly compelling speaker reached its climax in 1874 when he went on a lecture tour of the USA. He died suddenly at his home, Watford House, King's Norton, on 30 November 1876, following an aneurism of the larynx. The church of the Saviour struggled on until 1895, when it was sold to the Primitive Methodists. Several of his pamphlets were published in his lifetime, including two on the restoration of the Roman Catholic hierarchy (1850, 1851) in which he strongly upheld voluntaryism and disclaimed any &#145;no Popery&#146; sentiment on his own part. After his death his wife edited selections from his sermons and lectures from his shorthand notes (4 vols., 1878&#150;82) and two volumes of prayers which appeared in 1878 and 1883. Some of his biographical lectures were also published in two volumes (1886 and 1887).<br>
