<span class="headword">Evans,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1677&#150;1718), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was probably born in Ireland, but no details are known. He joined the Smock Alley troupe in Dublin in 1699 and was later associated with Thomas Elrington, Thomas Griffith, and Joseph Ashbury in the management of the theatre. In 1707&#150;8 he played Friar Andrews in Mary Pix's <span class="italic">The Spanish Wives</span>, and on 2 December 1709 he received a benefit in Dublin. He then travelled to England, and is listed in Thomas Betterton's company at the Queen's Theatre in the Haymarket for the 1709&#150;10 season. Billed as &#145;lately arrived from the theatre in Dublin&#146;, he took over the role of Kite in George Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Recruiting Officer</span> from Richard Escourt on 16 March 1710. On 14 April he performed the title role in <span class="italic">The Spanish Fryar</span>, and on 4 May he played Falstaff in <span class="italic">King Henry the Fourth</span> for his benefit before returning to Ireland. In 1714 his Dublin company played a summer season at Cork. According to William Chetwood, Evans was invited to a tavern, where he ill-advisedly proposed the health of Queen Anne. A duel ensued with a Jacobite officer whom Evans disarmed. Although the incident ended with reconciliation, a story spread that Evans had insulted the army. When the company returned to Dublin, Evans's performance as Alexander in Nathaniel Lee's <span class="italic">The Rival Queens</span> was stopped until he publicly apologized. A voice from the pit cried, &#145;Kneel, you rascal.&#146; &#145;I'll kneel to none but God, and my queen!&#146;, said Evans. Although it has been reported that this reply and subsequent kneeling satisfied both Evans and his opponents, according to Chetwood the situation was only calmed by army officers who knew the history of the original quarrel.<br>
<br>In 1715 Evans returned to London for an engagement at Drury Lane. On 22 January he played Claudius in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> and during the rest of the season revised his earlier roles of Kite, the Spanish Fryar, and Falstaff. On 21 March he played Aquilius in Lee's <span class="italic">Mithridates, King of Pontus</span> for Thomas Elrington's benefit. At his own benefit, &#145;at the desire of several Ladies of Quality&#146; on 28 March, he took the part of King Harry the Eighth in <span class="italic">Virtue Betray'd</span> by John Banks, alongside Anne Oldfield. Back in Dublin in 1715 Evans played Alcibiades in <span class="italic">Timon of Athens</span>, Thomas Shadwell's version of Shakespeare's play, and Lieutenant Story in <span class="italic">The Committee, or, The Faithful Irishman</span>, by Sir Robert Howard. He was seen in Charles Shadwell's <span class="italic">Irish Hospitality</span> at Smock Alley Theatre in 1717 and was again in London in 1718 playing at Lincoln's Inn Fields. On 26 September he appeared as Dorax in John Dryden's <span class="italic">Don Sebastian, King of Portugal</span>, which was followed by performances as Kite, Falstaff, the Spanish Fryar, Alexander, Tamerlane, and Cato. On 3 October he played Flip in Charles Shadwell's <span class="italic">The Fair Quaker of Deal</span>, a performance which ended in an uproar of drawn swords and pelted apples as a result of a gentleman's being denied admittance backstage. He appeared last as Tamerlane on 4 November 1718. On the journey back to Ireland, Evans became ill with fever at Whitchurch, Shropshire, and was taken to Chester for medical care. He died there, probably in December 1718, and was privately buried in the cathedral without monument or inscription.<br>
<br>According to Chetwood, Evans was an actor of good reputation in Ireland who had a harmonious voice and just delivery. Unfortunately he was also considered gross, indolent, and lacking in delicacy. He has sometimes been ascribed later dates, as a John Evans performed in the 1723 London season; however, this Evans did not play any of the parts in Evans's usual repertory, and Chetwood is almost certainly correct in stating that Evans the actor&#150;manager died in 1718.<br>
