<span class="headword">Lowndes,  Ashley Gordon</span>  (1885&#150;1956), <span class="occ">biologist and schoolteacher</span>, was born at Cainscross Villa, Cainscross, Stonehouse, Gloucestershire, on 9 October 1885, the third son in the family of three sons and two daughters of Robert Baxter Lowndes, solicitor, and his wife, Marian, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Whitaker. Privately educated, he moved to Southampton, serving in the merchant navy from the age of thirteen until his early twenties. While a ship's apprentice he was befriended by the vicar of South Shields, Henry Edwin Savage. Later, as a Sunday school teacher, his brilliance was recognized by a curate in Portsmouth, who successfully recommended him for a teaching post at Ardingly College in Sussex. In 1910 he entered St Catharine's College, Cambridge, where he graduated in 1913, having taken a third in part 1 of the natural sciences tripos and won a half-blue for swimming. During the First World War he became a research chemist working on explosives research at Nobel Industries, where his ideas were credited with leading to successful new processes, including patents for detonators.<br>
<br>In 1921 Lowndes was recruited by Cyril Norwood, master of Marlborough College, to teach sixth-form biology. He remained at Marlborough for seventeen years, turning biology&#151;which had previously been taught for those intending to study medicine&#151;into a subject in its own right. His single-mindedness and rigorous methods led him to drive his pupils hard, while his &#145;passion for investigation&#146;  (Young, 826), also led him to involve them in advanced study.<br>
<br>Lowndes was remarkable for pursuing scientific researches alongside his teaching: &#145;He passionately believed that those who taught science should also contribute to it by research&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 29 March 1956). He contributed to several fields, but his best work was regarded as being on the biology of crustaceans, where he concentrated on the taxonomy of entomostraca. He also made significant contributions to the knowledge of freshwater copepods and ostracods. A typically ingenious experiment led him to criticize established explanations of the feeding of <i>Chirocephalus</i>. His investigations into the rapid movements of small organisms using home-made equipment bettered that of well-established biologists. He had made a stroboscope from a cocoa tin with two cuts opposite parallel slits. Fitted over the eyepiece of a microscope, the tin could be revolved by squeezing the bulb of a scent-spray and, by altering the speed of the tin, he could see in slow motion the action of cilia, the beating of a flagellum, or the limbs of arthropods. The Leverhulme Trust awarded him three grants, in 1933, 1934, and 1955, for &#145;polygraphic process in ultra-rapid cinema photo-microscopy&#146;. His observations on the action of flagella using this equipment were subsequently verified, in 1945, by electron microscopy. He also perfected a technique for weighing living aquatic organisms and tissues by a displacement method, which was upheld by the National Physical Laboratory as accurate up to four decimal places.<br>
<br>Lowndes's independence of mind enabled him to criticize the findings of distinguished scholars in the field, and an aggressive tendency involved him in heated scholarly disputes. In 1929 and 1930 he criticized Charles Elton's <span class="italic">Animal Ecology</span> and in 1944 he revised two concepts of Sir D'Arcy Thompson, while dismissing some textbook accounts of flagellar movements as &#145;a travesty of elementary mechanics&#146;, pointing out also that recent interpretations by Sir James Gray FRS, among others, were incorrect.<br>
<br>Lowndes, who was unmarried, retired from Marlborough College in 1938 to undertake research in the leper colony at Oji River, Onitsha, Nigeria, run by the Church Missionary Society, with the intention of becoming an honorary research worker for the society. At the outbreak of the Second World War he returned to Britain to teach at various public schools. At Wells Cathedral School he particularly enjoyed the moat in the bishop's palace for its aquatic life. In 1947, after two unsuccessful applications (in 1932 and 1935), he was awarded the Cambridge degree of ScD. His ambition to be elected a fellow of the Royal Society was never fulfilled, perhaps as a result of his tendency to make enemies of eminent biologists. He continued to work at the Marine Biological Laboratory, Plymouth, until his death, from pneumonia, at Falmouth Hospital, Falmouth, Cornwall, on 15 March 1956.<br>
<br>&#145;Tubby&#146; Lowndes was a barrel-shaped man who would address his pupils in west country style. His early years spent at sea were reflected in his rolling gait, and a directness of manner that could make him appear rough and coarsely spoken in the public-school world in which he later moved. He was fond of choral music and sang the hymns every evensong and attended saints' and high days, parading down the aisle in his scarlet robes. A gifted experimenter, he published at least a hundred papers, many of them short, but to the point. Most of all, he was remembered as &#145;one of the most brilliant and least orthodox science teachers of his day&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 29 March 1956), who had a major influence on the style of biological teaching in Britain. Several of his pupils became academic biologists and three of them, famous experimental zoologists, became fellows of the Royal Society: J. Z. Young, R. J. Pumphrey, and P. B. Medawar (later a Nobel laureate).<br>
