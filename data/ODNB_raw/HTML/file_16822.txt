<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lloyd,  Charles</span>  (1784&#150;1829), <span class="occ">bishop of Oxford</span>, was born at West Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, on 26 September 1784, the second son and third of seven children of Thomas Lloyd (1745&#150;1815), a clergyman and schoolmaster, and his wife, Elizabeth (1760&#150;1814), an illegitimate daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24401/', "Nathaniel Ryder, first Baron Harrowby")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24394/', "Ryder, Sir Dudley (1691&#150;1756)")</script>]. His father, who had been nominated by Ryder to the rectory of Aston-sub-Edge, Gloucestershire, ran a successful private school at Peterley House, Great Missenden, the seat of Lord Dormer. After tuition by his father, Charles went to Eton College in 1800 as a colleger, supported by foundation scholarships to pay tuition and board. In 1803 he matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, where he was nominated to a studentship by the dean, Cyril Jackson, who exerted a strong influence on Lloyd's early career.<br>
<br>After gaining first place in the Oxford honours list in 1806 (graduating BA in 1806, MA in 1809, BD in 1818, and DD in 1821), Lloyd left Oxford to serve as private tutor to the children of Lord Elgin at Dunfermline, but within a year was summoned back to Oxford by Dean Jackson, who needed a mathematics tutor. One of Lloyd's first assignments was to prepare Robert Peel for his examinations; Peel attributed his double first to the teaching of Lloyd, who was in later life &#145;a friend and counsellor&#146;, corresponding with him on various political matters and probably influencing his views on currency. Daily correspondence of another Christ Church undergraduate, G. R. Chinnery, suggests that Lloyd was an extraordinarily attentive and effective tutor. He served for several years as librarian and censor of Christ Church, but his most important contribution was a pedagogical zeal which helped to extricate Oxford from the slough of &#145;port and prejudice&#146; denounced by Gibbon.<br>
<br>Ordained in 1808, Lloyd held the curacies of Drayton (1810) and Binsey (1818), both near Oxford. In June 1819 he was appointed under Peel's influence to the preachership of Lincoln's Inn, which he held until February 1822 when, on the nomination of Lord Liverpool, he was appointed to the regius professorship of divinity at Oxford, to which was attached a canonry at Christ Church and the rectory of Ewelme. On 15 August 1822 he married Mary Harriet (<i>d</i>. 1857), daughter of Colonel John Stapleton of Thorpe Lee, Surrey, and within four years they had a family of one son and three daughters.<br>
<br>As regius professor Lloyd revived theological studies in the university and was regarded as: &#145;if not the founder of a new school, at least the infuser of a new and more energetic spirit&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 561). He supplemented his statutory public lectures with private classes attended by graduates, who included R. H. Froude, J. H. Newman, Frederick Oakeley, and E. B. Pusey (it was on Lloyd's suggestion that Pusey went to Germany to study its theology). Lloyd's revelation of the ancient roots and historical development of the Anglican liturgy and dogma influenced a generation of Oxford theologians, many of his liturgical notes being incorporated into William Palmer's <span class="italic">Origines liturgicae</span> (1832). An abstract of his lectures was later published in E. S. Ffoukes's <span class="italic">A History of the Church of S. Mary, Oxford</span> (1892). Short, stocky, and prematurely bald, Lloyd was remembered for informally bantering with, and occasionally bullying, the attenders at his private lectures. For a wider clerical readership he published a collection of <span class="italic">Formularies of Faith Put Forth by Authority during the Reign of Henry VIII</span> (1825).<br>
<br>On 4 March 1827 Lloyd was consecrated bishop of Oxford, to which position he had been nominated through Peel's influence. He retained his professorship, continuing to deliver lectures while coping with the considerable problems of pluralism and non-residence in the diocese of Oxford. As a member of the House of Lords Lloyd was confronted with the contentious question of Catholic emancipation. Although he held traditional high-church views hostile to Catholic civil liberties, he had given a favourable assessment of Roman Catholic doctrines in an essay for the <span class="italic">British Critic</span> (October 1825). Admitting that some Roman Catholics practised idolatry, he insisted that none of Rome's historical documents or public formularies supported the worship of images. By 1829, however, the Catholic question turned on practical politics rather than religious principles, and he joined Peel in supporting Catholic relief, though he mishandled Peel's unsuccessful candidature for re-election to the Oxford seat (February 1829). During the Lords' debates on emancipation he delivered an important speech in favour of reform (2 April 1829), a stand which made him a favourite scapegoat of defeated conservatives. Shortly afterwards George IV snubbed him at a public function.<br>
<br>Mentally distressed and physically fatigued, Lloyd attended an anniversary dinner at the Royal Academy at Somerset House, where he caught a cold that lingered and worsened. He died of pneumonia on 31 May 1829 at the house in Whitehall Place, London, which he had rented for the summer season. Two days later he was given a private funeral in Lincoln's Inn chapel, and was interred in the Benchers' vault.<br>
<br>Of all the posthumous accolades, J. H. Newman's comment was most heartfelt and appropriate: &#145;He brought me forward, made me known, spoke well of me, and gave me confidence in myself&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Correspondence</span>, 1.209). Later interest in Lloyd has been stimulated as studies of Peel, Tractarianism, and of the revival of liturgical and ecclesiological scholarship have come to show his importance in the academic life of early nineteenth century Oxford.<br>
