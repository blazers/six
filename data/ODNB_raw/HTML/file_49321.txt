<span class="headword">Lewis, Sir  Edward Roberts</span>  (1900&#150;1980), <span class="occ">record and gramophone company executive</span>, was born at Allerton Mount, Duffield Road, Derby on 19 April 1900, the only son in the family of four children of Sir Alfred Edward Lewis (1868&#150;1940), banker, and his wife, May Roberts. His father was an employee and later chief general manager of the National and Provincial Bank. Lewis was educated at Rugby School and Trinity College, Cambridge. Thereafter he entered the world of finance and at the age of twenty-five established his own stockbroking firm, E. R. Lewis &amp; Co., which continued to trade in the late twentieth century. In 1923 he married Margaret Mary (&#145;Masie&#146;), daughter of the Revd George Dickson Hutton; they had two sons, one of whom died while still at Rugby School, attempting to rescue a drowning boy at the school's boys club summer camp. The other later became the senior partner in the stockbroking firm that Lewis founded.<h2>
<a name="Recordproduction"></a>Record production</h2>Through his stockbroking activities, Lewis became acquainted with the Decca Company, which manufactured recording and play-back equipment and developed the world's first portable gramophone. In the summer of 1928 Lewis's firm acted as brokers for Decca's stock market flotation, and the apparently excellent prospects of the firm, together with the boom then happening in the broader music industry, ensured that the share issue was oversubscribed some twenty fold. Lewis's interest in the company and music industry in general began to take up more and more of his time and he attempted to put his expertise to work in expanding Decca. His idea was for the company to build on its worldwide reputation and distribution network by expanding into the business of record production and manufacture, a far more lucrative branch of the industry than that of the manufacture of equipment to play records on.<br>
<br>However, when Lewis approached Decca's board of directors with his plans for establishing Decca's own catalogue of records, complete with a roster of artists, they were sceptical. They went as far as inspecting a possible factory site&#151;the ailing Duophone Company's record factory at Shannon's Corner, Kingston&#151;but turned Lewis down in January 1929. Undeterred, Lewis fell back on his own financial expertise and industry contacts, and set about forming a syndicate, the Malden Holding Company Ltd, with a view to establishing a record company of his own, based around the Duophone factory. In the event, Lewis and his colleagues decided to take over Decca, since it had an established name and network, and on 28 February 1929 a new Decca issue was made, shares this time being oversubscribed nearly twofold. The new business that began trading with such high hopes was soon engulfed in the great depression which began with the Wall Street crash later that year. As countless companies went to the wall, Lewis faced a titanic struggle to prevent Decca going under, a struggle that lasted a decade. Within a year of the 1929 issue, Decca's bankers were threatening foreclosure, and at its financial nadir some years later, the company even had its telephone cut off. It was not until 1945 that Decca's shareholders began to make even a small profit from their original investments.<h2>
<a name="KeepingDeccaafloat"></a>Keeping Decca afloat</h2>As disaster loomed in 1931, Lewis argued for a change in the company's management, more rapid expansion, and, in an attempt to eat into the market share of the newly formed Electric and Musical Industries (EMI) conglomerate, substantial cuts in the retail price of Decca records. Lewis eventually got his way, but not without a series of managerial tussles, intense lobbying of shareholders, and even a nationwide tour on his own part (he never claimed for his travel expenses in all his years at Decca) to assess the company's performance in the market place. By September Lewis had secured the departure of Decca's managing director, S. C. Newton, and <i>de facto</i> became his successor, although he took no official position other than becoming a member of the board. In practice, however, he had effective control of the company. It had been Lewis's intention for this state of affairs to last only a few months, but he was soon tied into the company's long-term prospects and was forced by the exigencies of the deepening great depression and attendant decline in the record industry (in Britain between 1929 and 1938 record sales fell by eighty-five per cent) to think of new ways of keeping Decca afloat. He signed new artists such as the singer Gertrude Lawrence and the best-selling dance-bandleader Jack Hylton, combining this with a policy of consistently lowering retail prices below those charged by EMI. In the early 1930s Lewis strengthened the Decca popular and classical record catalogues by accessing the recordings of two important overseas record companies. To achieve this, he first acquired the American Brunswick Record Company, then a subsidiary of Hollywood film-makers Warner Brothers, which marketed records by leading popular American artists such as Bing Crosby and Al Jolson. He then concluded a licensing agreement with the German Polydor Company giving him access to a whole range of classical recordings. Nevertheless, by 1933, as the record industry continued to disintegrate, Decca found itself in further difficulties, managing to raise only &pound;23,000 on a share issue of &pound;120,000. Despite the deep personal depression that Lewis experienced as a consequence of all this, he persevered, mobilizing his own resources and those of friends and family to take up the rest of the issue, though not without experiencing considerable hardship in the process of finding money to pay for it. At the same time, every available economy was made within the company and as part of this drive loyal staff accepted salary cuts. Lewis later recalled that without such selfless devotion the Decca enterprise could never have survived, but his own diplomatic skills and sheer determination were also important ingredients.<br>
<br>By 1934 Decca was breaking into the lucrative American market and the record division at least turned in its first profit. During this period, in order to supervise his growing transatlantic trade, Lewis travelled back and forth between Britain and the United States. Yet even this expansion proved a drain on the company's slender resources. However, through a combination of Lewis's adroitness, good luck, and a gradual upturn in the global economy, by the time the Second World War broke out in 1939, it appeared that Decca had weathered the storm. In the circumstances of war, demand for records began to rise: Lewis attributed this, in Britain at least, to the greater need for home entertainment as city centres closed down and blacked out in the face of much feared and expected air-raids. Furthermore, in 1940, Decca engineers began experiments in the field of radio navigation, a form of radar. Initial scepticism on the parts of both the British and United States military delayed its development somewhat, but, by 1944, entirely successful tests ensured that the &#145;Decca Navigator&#146;, as the final product was called, was crucial in the execution of the D-day landings at Normandy. Decca subsequently diversified into more specialized technical defence related fields, and its air and sea navigation equipment proved a cornerstone of the company's post-war development. Indeed, this area of the business continued to be profitable during the late 1970s, when the record division ran into serious trouble, and, in 1980, when the business was finally sold and broken up, the defence sector proved to be Decca's largest single asset.<h2>
<a name="Postwarsurgeinprofits"></a>Post-war surge in profits</h2>After the war, Decca came into its own and saw its profits surge. Lewis had an ear for popular and classical music, and gathered around him a strong team of artist and repertoire managers and classical record producers. He also had a great respect for (and a good grasp of) the ever changing tastes of the record buying public. His guiding principle was that it was no use arguing with the public about what it wanted. The only serious mistake Decca made was to audition and reject the Beatles, though they did sign the Rolling Stones and a host of other rock bands. That aside, Decca prospered under Lewis, who did not even assume the official title of chairman until 1957. He never claimed to be a technical or recording expert, but his great skill in co-ordinating and maximizing the efforts of the experts he worked with earned him the gold Albert medal of the Royal Society of Arts for services to the development of electronics in 1967. He was knighted in 1951.<br>
<br>Lewis was a man who combined a cheerful calm manner with incredible business acumen. A fervent believer in private enterprise, he was a vocal opponent of state intervention in the market place after 1945, a view articulated most notably in his business memoirs, <span class="italic">No CIC</span>, first published in 1956 (the CIC in the title stands for &#145;Capital Issues Committee&#146;, the body established after the war to supervise capital issues and transfers). Lewis's point was that had its restrictive practices been in force during the 1930s, he would never have been able to build up Decca into the successful business it became. Like many who create, build, and retain close personal control over large enterprises, Lewis was unable to appoint a successor or relinquish control of the business. As a consequence, in 1980, days before his death, the business, then in the grip of a serious financial crisis, was sold.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>Lewis was not an extravagant man, despite his huge personal fortune. He donated large sums of money to Rugby School and the Middlesex Hospital, and he was more interested in watching a cricket match than living a life of obvious luxury. His first wife died in 1968 and in 1973 he married Jeanie Margaret, daughter of Thomas Henry Smith, a farmer. During the latter period of his life Lewis had a London home at 69A Cadogan Place, Chelsea, as well as one in the country at Bridge House Farm, Felsted, Essex. He died of cancer at his London home, on 29 January 1980. He was survived by his second wife. &#145;Leaving aside his successes in the field of electronics&#146;, noted his obituarist in <span class="italic">The Gramophone</span>, &#145;he will always be remembered as one of the great men of the record industry&#146;.<br>
