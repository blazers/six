<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hunter, Sir  Ian Bruce Hope</span>  (1919&#150;2003), <span class="occ">impresario</span>, was born on 2 April 1919 at Green Croft, 63 Crescent West, Hadley Wood, Middlesex, the youngest of the five children of William Ouchterlony Hunter, a Scot, and his English wife, Edith Alice Millicent, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Glover. His father, who had served as a captain in the 12th Bedford regiment during the First World War, was then working as a stockbroker; he was later a sheep farmer and company director. Hunter was educated at a preparatory school in Dorset and at Fettes College, where he learned the horn and resolved to become a conductor. Oxford eluded him but he took lessons with Edinburgh's professor of music, Sir Donald Tovey, and these qualified him for a job as assistant to Fritz Busch, music director of Glyndebourne. There, for two years (1938&#150;9), he was a jack-of-all-trades: he made notes for Busch, copied orchestral parts, and even appeared in Verdi's <span class="italic">Macbeth</span> in a silent role. He once accompanied Busch on a Scandinavian tour, encountering Rachmaninov and an artist whom, years later, he was to represent&#151;the violinist Nathan Milstein.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 Hunter enlisted in the Royal Army Service Corps, serving in north Africa and Italy and reaching the rank of lieutenant-colonel. Before being demobilized he arranged the reopening of the opera house in Klagenfurt. He had permission to fraternize with the Austrians and in assembling a complete company he discovered the intense satisfaction of working with musicians and technicians towards the goal of public performance. The impresario was born&#151;and the soldier was awarded the MBE.<br>
<br>The war over, Hunter approached Glyndebourne's general manager, Rudolf Bing, who engaged him as his assistant for the planning of the first Edinburgh Festival in 1947. When Bing moved to New York to direct the Metropolitan Opera, Hunter succeeded him. The six festivals he directed (1950&#150;55) demonstrated his professionalism and his showmanship. In 1951 he brought over the New York Philharmonic to give fourteen programmes under Bruno Walter and Dimitri Mitropoulos. The following year he ruffled Glyndebourne's feathers by replacing it with the Hamburg State Opera, none of whose six productions had been seen in Britain before. He persuaded Thomas Beecham to preside over the <span class="italic">Royal Fireworks Music</span> on the Castle Esplanade and he commissioned the <span class="italic">Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli</span> from Michael Tippett, then by no means a fashionable composer. He was particularly proud of bringing the visual arts into the festival, Rembrandt, Degas, Renoir, C&eacute;zanne, and Gauguin being among the painters featured. Characteristic of his flair was the engagement of Richard Buckle to curate, in 1954, a lavish and exotic exhibition devoted to Diaghilev.<br>
<br>In 1953 Hunter was invited to join the board of Harold Holt, a leading artists' and concert agency, and when Holt died not long afterwards he succeeded him as managing director (declaring an interest in any Holt artist engaged by the festival). The firm was the central platform of his professional life for many years and he saw to it that, while its activities diversified, it continued to act as an agency dedicated to the careers of musicians of exceptional talent or exceptional promise: Hunter signed up Daniel Barenboim when he was fourteen. But the creation of arts festivals was his special passion and his record in this sphere was remarkable. He had launched the Bath festival with Yehudi Menuhin as early as 1948. Among the festivals which followed were the City of London (1962&#150;80), Brighton (1967&#150;83), Windsor (1969&#150;72), Hong Kong (1973&#150;5), and Malvern (1977&#150;82). Especially imaginative was the Commonwealth Arts Festival of 1965. Held in London, Glasgow, Cardiff, and Liverpool over two weeks, it was a colourful celebration of Caribbean, African, and Indian dance, and Australian and Canadian ballet. Classical music jostled with jazz; Menuhin shared a platform with Ravi Shankar; there were fireworks and balloons. Hunter believed that festivals should be festive.<br>
<br>In the late 1960s Hunter began to undertake committee work at the Arts Council and in 1978 he became president of the British Arts Festivals Association. In 1981 he was elected chairman of the council of the Royal Society of Arts, and in his inaugural address he made an eloquent plea for the arts to be accepted as a central and indispensable ingredient of education. Knighted in 1983, he moved gradually towards disinterested charitable activity: he was influential in the Royal College of Music's 1983 centenary appeal, and was made a fellow of the college; he was also a founder, in 1984, of the Young Concert Artists' Trust (a non-profit agency for emerging soloists). From 1987 to 1995 he was chairman of the Musicians' Benevolent Fund, the most important charity of its kind. He still found time to mastermind some international festivals&#151;the American Festival (1985), the Festival of German Arts (1987), and the Japan Festival (1991), of which he was vice-chairman.<br>
<br>In Hunter's spare time&#151;such as it was&#151;he painted (with modest but attractive skill) and gardened. He also took up hunting, surviving a serious fall in 1979. It slowed him down but he was on form again within a year or two. He had married Susan Russell, daughter of Brigadier Alec Gaudie Russell, army officer, on 17 September 1949, and with her had four daughters. Her death from cancer in 1977 profoundly grieved him. His second marriage, on 4 October 1984, to Marie Sadie Showering, Lady Showering (Sir Keith Showering's widow, and daughter of Charles Wesley Golden, company director), did not last into his old age, and during his last years he relied on the help of his daughters. He died at his home, Balcombe Place, Haywards Heath Road, Balcombe, Sussex, on 5 September 2003, of bronchopneumonia, and was survived by his daughters.<br>
<br>Ian Hunter was arguably the most successful impresario of his generation and was perhaps unique in his migration from a world in which he promoted and profited from the careers of eminent musicians to one in which he concerned himself both with those who had not yet arrived and with those who, because of ill health, accident, or old age, needed charitable support.<br>
