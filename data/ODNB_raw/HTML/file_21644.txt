<span class="headword">Payne,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1507), <span class="occ">bishop of Meath</span>, was educated in the Dominican convent, Oxford. He became a doctor of divinity, and professor of theology in the convent, and was subsequently elected prior provincial of the Dominicans in England. On 17 March 1483 he was provided to the bishopric of Meath, having originally been granted custody of the temporalities on 15 February, and he was consecrated on 4 August following. A close ally of Gerald Fitzgerald, eighth earl of Kildare, and, like most of the palesmen, a staunch Yorkist, Payne became a leading supporter of Lambert Simnel after he landed in Ireland in the winter of 1486&#150;7. He preached the sermon at Simnel's coronation in Christ Church, Dublin, on Whitsunday (24 May) 1487, but after the battle of Stoke he was among the first to make his peace with Henry VII.<br>
<br>In July 1488 Payne escorted the king's commissioner, Sir Richard Edgcumbe, sent over to pacify Ireland, from Malahide to Dublin, where he acted as an intermediary between Edgcumbe and Kildare. At Edgcumbe's instance, he published in Christ Church the papal bull excommunicating all who took part in the revolt, with the pope's absolution and the king's pardon to all who returned to their allegiance. After Payne's pardon, dated 25 May 1488, had been delivered, he was sent by Kildare and the council on a mission to court, where he apparently accused his metropolitan, Octavian de Palatio, archbishop of Armagh, of complicity in the revolt. The king rewarded him, but he was unsuccessful in a bid to secure a grant of the chancellorship.<br>
<br>According to James Ware, Payne was noted for his hospitality and alms-giving. In 1489 he assisted at a provincial synod in St Mary's Church, Ardee, arbitrating between rival claims by Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Br&aacute;daigh and Cormac Mag Shamhr&aacute;in to the bishopric of Kilmore. At the provincial synod at Drogheda in July 1492, however, a violent scene occurred when Payne called Primate Octavian, who had summoned him to answer certain charges, a tyrant. Octavian formally protested against his suffragan's disobedience. Payne apparently remained loyal during the Warbeck conspiracy, but at the great council at Trim in September 1493 he was bound over in 200 marks to observe certain articles tending to peace and good rule. He attended the provincial synod at Drogheda in July 1495, and the text of the resultant pastoral letter which Payne issued to his clergy still survives.<br>
<br>By then, however, Payne's relations with Kildare had broken down. Probably in 1494, after a fray, the earl pursued the bishop into a church and took him prisoner, only releasing him on a peremptory command from the king. When the two were at court in 1496, Payne denounced Kildare's conduct to the king, reportedly saying, &#145;All Ireland cannot rule yonder gentleman&#146;; to which Henry allegedly replied, &#145;Then he is meet to rule all Ireland&#146;  (<span class="roman">Book of Howth</span>, 180). Payne was nevertheless appointed keeper of the rolls after his return from England, on 3 October 1496. He died on 6 May 1507, and was buried in the Dominican church of St Saviour, Dublin.<br>
