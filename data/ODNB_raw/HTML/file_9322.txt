<span class="headword">Ferguson,  John</span>  (1787&#150;1856), <span class="occ">benefactor</span>, was born at Irvine, Ayrshire, on 28 February 1787, the son of William Ferguson, a shipmaster of that port, and his wife, Mary, only daughter of John Service of Holms of Caaf. The Services were an Ayrshire family, whose main profession, including that of Mary's father, was moneylending. Ferguson was educated at Ayr, and served for some time in a banker's office before going to America on business for one of his maternal uncles. He returned after four years, and in 1810 settled with his mother at Irvine. She inherited large sums of money on the deaths of her brother George and her father; two more brothers, who died in 1828 and 1842, left &pound;200,000 and &pound;400,000 respectively. Ferguson, by his knowledge of the money market, increased this fortune, until at his death it amounted to &pound;1,247,514 14<i>s</i>. 5<i>d</i>. An unremarkable individual, Ferguson never married, and spent the last few years of his life in comparative seclusion.<br>
<br>After consulting with the philanthropist John Henderson (1780&#150;1867) of Park, who was his intimate friend and acted as his private banker, and Matthew Montgomery of Kelvinside, Ferguson left the residue of his property, after family legacies and other provisions, to establish the Ferguson Bequest Fund, one of the largest mixed endowment bequests in Victorian Scotland. The sum available was at least &pound;400,000, and the trustees were instructed to devote the interest to &#145;the maintenance and promotion of religious ordinances and education and missionary operations; in the first instance in the county of Ayr, stewartry of Kirkcudbright, and counties of Wigtown, Lanark, Renfrew, and Dumbarton&#146;. Funds were to be provided for the building and support of churches and schools in Scotland, other than parish churches and schools. The Church of Scotland, the Free Church, the United Presbyterian church, the Reformed Presbyterian church, and the Congregationalists were all to benefit from the bequest, and the composition of the permanent body of trustees was to include members of all those denominations. The Ferguson trustees devoted another part of Ferguson's estate to the founding of six two-year scholarships of &pound;80 p.a. each at Scottish universities&#151;one in classics, another in mathematics, and a third in philosophy. The scholarships were to be competed for by students of any of the Scottish universities who had taken the degree of MA, or had qualified for that degree within the two years preceding. However, by 1875 the fund seems to have been used primarily to supplement ministers' and missionaries' salaries, and to maintain church buildings.<br>
<br>Ferguson signed his will at Glasgow on 22 September 1855, and soon afterwards his health began to fail. He died in Irvine on 8 January 1856, and was buried in Irvine churchyard.<br>
