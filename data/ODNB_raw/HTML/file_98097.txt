<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lloyd,  Maude Doris</span>  (1908&#150;2004), <span class="occ">ballet dancer and critic</span>, was born in Cape Town, Cape Colony, on 16 August 1908, the only daughter of William Lloyd (1875&#150;1960), builder, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bird (<i>c</i>.1880&#150;<i>c</i>.1961); she had an older brother, Arthur (1901&#150;1922). Her early ballet teacher, the celebrated Helen Webb, recognized a special talent and sent her at about nineteen to England on a scholarship to work with Marie Rambert. Lloyd repaid this kindness by visits to teach at Webb's school, but her career was spent in England. Her beauty and elegance were immediately apparent, and she developed a touching serenity. The expressiveness and intelligence she equally displayed became clear in 1931 when another young recruit, Antony Tudor, used her in creating his first ballet, <span class="italic">Cross-Garter'd</span> (based on characters from <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span>); she played Olivia. Thereafter for eight years she was Tudor's muse, helping his rise to international fame.<br>
<br>The most notable of many creations in which Lloyd and Tudor danced together were <span class="italic">Jardin aux lilas</span> (1936), the supreme example of psychological ballet-making, showing the distress of a woman entering an arranged marriage, and the bleakly tragic <span class="italic">Dark Elegies</span> (1937) to music from Mahler's <span class="italic">Kindertotenlieder</span>, where all the members of the cast mourn their children lost in some natural disaster. Lloyd and Tudor's many other collaborations included the comical <span class="italic">Gala Performance</span> (1938), in which her role was the immensely grand Italian ballerina, opera ballet at Covent Garden, and several of the earliest dances on BBC television.<br>
<br>Much in demand by other ballet-makers too, Lloyd was especially proud that Britain's other great choreographer Frederick Ashton used her in creating several ballets, notably his <span class="italic">Valentine's Eve</span> (1935), to music from Ravel's <span class="italic">Valses nobles et sentimentales</span>, and chose her to succeed Alicia Markova in <span class="italic">Fa&ccedil;ade</span>, <span class="italic">Foyer de danse</span>, and <span class="italic">Les masques</span>: a highly varied selection, supplemented by Ninette de Valois's <span class="italic">Bar aux Folies-Berg&egrave;re</span> (1934). She had a strong technique&#151;in the <span class="italic">Fa&ccedil;ade</span> polka, for instance, she performed the double <i>tours en l'air</i>, later generally omitted; but she was always more interested in the feeling within a dance movement. A good half-dozen aspiring young creators were glad of her gifts, and she appeared likewise in classic works by Marius Petipa, Lev Ivanov, Michel Fokine, and Vaslav Nijinsky.<br>
<br>When the Second World War broke out in 1939 Tudor was in New York and, having to remain there with American Ballet Theatre, asked Lloyd to help run the company he had lately founded, London Ballet. Her most important action there was commissioning <span class="italic">La f&ecirc;te &eacute;trange</span> (1940) from Andr&eacute;e Howard, based on Alain-Fournier's iconic novel <span class="italic">Le grand Meaulnes</span>, herself playing the Ch&acirc;teleine. This was to be Lloyd's last role; she now devoted herself to war work with refugees and to running a family. But in barely a decade she had shaped a handful of the most vivid and enduring characters in ballet's usually ephemeral repertoire.<br>
<br>In the 1930s Lloyd had made time to teach Rambert's class of part-time amateur dancers. Among these she met <a name="cosubject_98097"></a><span class="headword">Nigel Seymour Gosling</span>  (1909&#150;1982)<span class="occ"></span>, a &#145;small twinkling dapper figure&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 22 May 1982) whom she married on 31 July 1939. They had one son, Nicholas. Nigel Gosling was born on 29 January 1909 at 43 Hyde Park Square, London, the third of four sons of William Sullivan Gosling (1869&#150;1952), a captain, later major, in the Scots Guards, and landowner, and his wife, Lady Victoria Alexandrina Alberta Kerr (1876&#150;1956), fifth daughter of Schomberg Henry Kerr, ninth marquess of Lothian. Educated at Eton College and King's College, Cambridge, he entered the Foreign Office but after about a year in Berlin decided he was not cut out for that life. Instead he began painting and writing about art, with dance originally as a second interest, although he did occasionally make up the numbers on stage. During the Second World War, as a conscientious objector he served in the Red Cross, rising to become its senior representative with General Eisenhower's armies. He was not against the war but knew that he could not himself kill. After the war, already aged forty, he became a full-time journalist, joining the staff of <span class="italic">The Observer</span> newspaper to edit and review. As an art critic Gosling wrote books on Leningrad, Paris, Gustav Dor&eacute;, and Nadar (Gaspard-F&eacute;lix Tournachon).<br>
<br>It was Richard Buckle, editor of the magazine <span class="italic">Ballet</span>, who in 1951, after commissioning individual articles from both Gosling and Lloyd, suggested that they should collaborate to write about dance, thinking their experience and interests ideally complementary. They agreed only after Lloyd had overcome some scruples about reviewing former colleagues; and they adopted the pseudonym Alexander Bland, cheekily borrowed from Beatrix Potter's stories. It was under this pseudonym that they acted as ballet critic for <span class="italic">The Observer</span> from 1955 to 1982. Nobody (or no other two) wrote on ballet more perceptively or with more balance; Gosling it was who put their joint ideas into words that defined and illuminated every topic, always lively and often witty&#151;as for instance a long review of <span class="italic">Cinderella</span> entirely in rhyming couplets. Their <span class="italic">Observer</span> reviews, singularly well-informed and inspired by true love of the art form, did much to make a wide audience aware of ballet's potential, its achievements and shortcomings too.<br>
<br>There were six books signed Alexander Bland about dance, covering history, male dancing, Margot Fonteyn, and Rudolf Nureyev. Bland had been the first British critic to appreciate Nureyev's exceptional gifts, and when the latter first came to Britain Fonteyn, who was presenting him at a charity gala, asked Lloyd (a long-time friend) and Gosling to look after him. Thus began a relationship in which they became virtual substitutes for his far-away parents. He even abandoned his own house at Richmond, Surrey, to live in a flat within the Goslings' house in Kensington. Nigel Gosling's thoughts and comments became an important ingredient in Nureyev's planning of new ballets, while Maude Lloyd's calm home-making gave him the peace he wanted. After Gosling's death on 21 May 1982 (at St Thomas's Hospital, Lambeth, of prostate cancer) Nureyev took Lloyd with him whenever possible as a companion and carer on his frequent journeys, and did all he could to ensure that she still did some writing.<br>
<br>In her last years, especially after Nureyev died in 1993, Maude Lloyd gradually became incapacitated by loss of vision, hearing, and mobility, but her long involvement in dance, combined with her kindness and generosity, ensured that she kept an unusually large circle of friends who loved her deeply and cared for her. She herself said often that she looked forward to her own decease, but she reached ninety-six years of age before that came, on 27 November 2004. She was survived by her son, Nicholas. Both Lloyd and her husband were cremated at Mortlake crematorium. One concern she had kept to the end was the resettlement of dancers after their often necessarily early retirement, and Dancers' Career Development marked this after her death by setting up a Maude Lloyd and Rudolf Nureyev bursary to fund the retraining of a former professional dancer each year.<br>
