<span class="headword">Weightman,  John George</span>  (1915&#150;2004), <span class="occ">French scholar and critic</span>, was born on 29 November 1915 at Burn Close, Callerton, Northumberland, the son of Lance Weightman, coalminer, and his wife, Emily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Robson. He was proud of his working-class roots in the north-east and still spoke with a trace of regional accent in later life. His father, a conscientious objector and Methodist preacher, died from tuberculosis contracted in the mines when his son was fourteen; Weightman was thereafter brought up by his mother in impoverished circumstances. He had won a scholarship to Hexham grammar school, where he encountered an inspiring teacher of French and ideas. Although encouraged to put in for Cambridge, he characteristically opted for King's College, Newcastle. There he gained a first in French, intermitting a year's study at the &Eacute;cole Normale in Poitiers.<br>
<br>Weightman's career encompassed several overlapping fields&#151;broadcasting, journalism, and academic activity. In 1939 he made a successful application for a post with the World Service of the BBC as a translator and newsreader. Joining the BBC was a timely event in that it was soon followed by the occupation of France. During the Second World War Weightman became a valuable member of the foreign language service, translating and delivering news items in impeccable French, and relaying coded instructions to the resistance, as well as chairing discussions between British and French thinkers. On 15 June 1940 Weightman married (Jessie) Doreen Wade (1915&#150;1985), whom he had met at university. The daughter of Gavin Wade, schoolmaster, and herself a schoolteacher, she later collaborated with him on a number of important translations, including the anthropological works of Claude L&eacute;vi-Strauss. They had two children, a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>After the war Weightman continued to work for the BBC in Paris until 1950. In these immediate post-war years he played a considerable part in acquainting the British public with Parisian intellectual movements. His work for radio lasted long after he left the BBC's employment, and he contributed to <span class="italic">The Brains Trust</span> and to <span class="italic">The Critics</span>. He also began to make a name for himself as an essayist. From the mid-1950s onwards he wrote articles for most of the leading journals and newspapers, such as <span class="italic">Encounter</span>, <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, the <span class="italic">New York Review of Books</span>, <span class="italic">Twentieth Century</span>, and the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span>. As a critic of the contemporary scene he had a distinctive voice. Fascinated by modern developments, yet equally sceptical of their more extreme manifestations, he often displayed a wry sense of humour (&#145;A bald man's view of <i>Hair</i>&#146; is a good example) which could even be quite impish, as in his invention of a book he would have liked to have written himself. His expertise as a reviewer gained official recognition in 1977 when he was invited to sit on Bernard Williams's committee on pornography and film censorship.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Weightman had in 1950 been appointed to a lectureship in French at King's College, London. He was subsequently promoted to reader, and then in 1963 was offered the chair of French language and literature at Westfield College, where he remained until his retirement in 1981. Not surprisingly his forays into journalism met with the disapproval of some academic colleagues, especially as he tended to bring the same highly personal approach to his studies of the French literary canon. His early interest was in the Enlightenment, and his clarion call was for more critical insight: an essay, &#145;The quality of <i>Candide</i>&#146;, is evidence of this, as well as his injunction to stop looking at Rousseau's laundry bills. Later on Weightman devoted himself almost exclusively to twentieth-century issues, which bore fruit in books on the avant-garde and the absurd. However, his values were firmly rooted in eighteenth-century clarity and reason, slightly modified by non-religious existentialism. He once described himself as an old-fashioned progressive: hence his frustration with much of postmodernist thought, in particular that of Foucault and Derrida. For his services to French culture Weightman was made a commander of the Ordre des Palmes Acad&eacute;miques.<br>
<br>As a teacher Weightman was held in great esteem by his students&#151;&#145;all that brain crossing the Finchley Road&#146;, one of them was heard to remark  (private information). They may have been irritated by his fussiness in matters of translation, but they were dazzled by his exposition of the ideas of Sartre and Camus. Indeed these two themes, language and absurdism, preoccupied him during his final years. After the death of his wife in 1985 he continued to be a most generous host at their house in Weech Road, Hampstead, his home for almost half his life. He remained in touch with his many friends, constantly ordered books from the London Library, set about learning Russian, and thoroughly enjoyed entertaining his grandchildren. Still alert to the problems of a world he never ceased to puzzle out, he died of cancer at Edenhall nursing home, Lyndhurst Gardens, Camden, on 14 August 2004. He was cremated at Golders Green, and was survived by his son and daughter.<br>
