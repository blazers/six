<span class="headword">Cunningham, Lady  Margaret</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1622?), <span class="occ">autobiographer</span>, was one of the six daughters of James Cunningham, sixth earl of Glencairn (<i>d</i>. 1631), and his first wife, Mariot or Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1610), daughter of Colin Campbell of Glenorchy. Despite her high birth she was distinguished principally by misfortune, and by the fact that she wrote a detailed account of the cruelty she suffered at the hands of her first husband; the account provides evidence of the acute vulnerability of wives and the inability of law, custom, and even powerful kinsmen to guarantee protection from brutal husbands. On 24 January 1598 Margaret married Sir James Hamilton (<i>d</i>. in or after 1608), master of Evandale, who was from a wealthy and well-connected family. For the next three years she continued to reside with her parents at Finlaystone in Renfrewshire and it is not clear when the marriage was consummated. When she visited Evandale between February and May 1601 Sir James and his parents did not receive her in the family house at Crawford-John, but directed her to a nearby inn. Her first child, James, was born at her father's house on 4 July 1601. In February 1602 she returned to Evandale and was once more accommodated at the inn; an appeal to her parents-in-law for help in paying the bill yielded only 40 merks and eight sacks of farm meal.<br>
<br>A pattern set in of alternate neglect and abuse by Sir James and his parents. Repeated attempts by Lady Margaret to take up residence with her husband were rebuffed, and the small amounts of money the Hamiltons reluctantly supplied from time to time proved insufficient to cover the costs of the lodgings to which she was forced to resort. Efforts at mediation, most notably by the Hamiltons' successive clan chiefs John Hamilton, first marquess of Hamilton (1532&#150;1604), and his son James Hamilton, second marquess, who in 1603 married Lady Margaret's sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67437/', "Lady Anne Cunningham (d. 1647)")</script>, had little success. At different times Lady Margaret took refuge with her parents and with Lady Anne. Temporary reconciliations between the couple led to the birth of four more children, John (12 October 1603), Jean (March 1605), Christian (November 1606), and Thomas (April 1608), but Sir James oscillated between absence (including periodic visits to France), infidelity, repentance, silence, and violence. When in 1604 he took a dislike to Lady Margaret's gentlewoman, Abigail Hamilton, he and two menservants turned both women out of the house at Evandale at night, threatening them with a sword and not allowing them to put on any clothes whatsoever. Lady Margaret records that the night was &#145;foul&#146; and that she was both sick and pregnant at the time. Naked, they had to seek shelter in the minister's house and they went on to accept charity for nine weeks from the family of a servant.<br>
<br>This was only one of several sudden evictions, and Lady Margaret was always short of money. In 1605 she was given the rent from a mill, but from this had to provide for herself, the children, her husband, and all his household. When his father died in March 1606 Sir James increased the number of his retainers, but gave her nothing from the inheritance. That September he attempted to sell the barony of Carstairs, but when Glencairn intervened legally, presumably because this property and title had been settled by nuptial contract on his daughter's children, Sir James cut off Lady Margaret's meagre allowance. Persistent mediation in her favour by Alexander Lindsay of Dunrood made no headway, so in January 1607 she brought a lawsuit for maintenance, assisted by her father, her brother-in-law Hamilton, and the earl of Abercorn (another Hamilton kinsman). She spent &pound;100 in legal expenses, but without conclusion. However, through the influence of Hamilton and the laird of Benhaith, she obtained a small allowance.<br>
<br>That summer saw final attempts at reconciliation. In May Lady Margaret wrote a long letter to Sir James in France, addressing him as &#145;dear heart&#146;, full of devout exhortation and hopeful wishes for his future salvation. She enclosed a poem of her own composition on the same theme in irregularly rhyming pentameters and a book, <span class="italic">The Resolved Christian</span>. When he returned in June Margaret was initially so frightened of him that she refused to share his bed, but his promises of reformation brought from her forgiveness and a diamond ring as a token. Yet soon afterwards his behaviour relapsed into harshness and negligence. Following the death of his mother that September, Sir James sent Margaret and their children to live in Libertoun, with very inadequate provision. Having at first refused to visit her for five weeks after the birth of their fifth child in April 1608, Sir James arrived not with money to meet their debts but with an expectation of resuming connubial relations. Lady Margaret, knowing that he was now excommunicated for manslaughter and was living in adultery with a certain Jennat Campbell, finally and irrevocably refused him. In August he retaliated by again throwing his wife and children out of the house. Once more her kinsmen tried to intervene, but when she wrote her testimony on 29 September Lady Margaret described herself as surviving in Libertoun still destitute.<br>
<br>At this point, under Scottish law Lady Margaret would have been entitled to divorce with a right of remarriage, and at costs less than elsewhere in Europe. However, within a few years Sir James conveniently died. In her will Lady Margaret stated her hope that he had been redeemed before death: she had long ago fully forgiven him. It was thus as a widow that she married Sir James Maxwell of Calderwood, becoming his third wife. Her later letters reveal a happy marriage, which produced two sons, John and Alexander, and four daughters, Susanna, Anne, Margaret, and Catherine. Her daughter Jean Hamilton married Maxwell's son, another Sir James. Left a widow again in 1622, and with two of her sons dead, Margaret wrote from Malsly to her sister the marchioness of Hamilton imploring her and the marquess to take care of her surviving children, several of whom were still young and needed tuition. She enclosed a will dated 2 October 1622, written as if she were sick and dying, asking for her son Thomas to be taken in as a follower of the Hamiltons' eldest son, the earl of Arran, and reminding her sister of a promise made to Glencairn to help her other children; those from her first marriage were not entitled to her small income after her death, while those from the second were dependent on payment by the heir of Calderwood of 6000 merks to be shared between them all. Lady Margaret died at Malsly, probably soon afterwards.<br>
