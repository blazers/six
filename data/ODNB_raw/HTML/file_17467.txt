<span class="headword">Macdougall <span class="st"> [MacDougall]</span>, Sir  Duncan</span>  (1787&#150;1862), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, son of Patrick MacDougall of Soroba, near Oban, Argyll, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Duncan M'Vicar, was born at Soroba. Educated at Edinburgh, he entered the army as ensign in 1804, and served in the 53rd and 85th regiments on Cape Colony frontier, at the Cape, and in the Peninsular War. He took part in the third siege and in the capture by storm of Badajoz on 6 April 1812, and in the capture on 27 June of the forts of Salamanca. In the battle of Salamanca on 22 July he gallantly saved the colours of his regiment and was severely wounded. He was present at the siege of Burgos in September and October 1812 and the subsequent retreat, at the siege and capture on 31 August 1813 of San Sebastian, at the passage of the Bidassoa in October, at the battles of Nivelle (10 November) and Nive (9&#150;13 December), and at the investment of Bayonne.<br>
<br>Macdougall took part in the Anglo-American War in 1814; he was present at the battle of Bladensburg on 24 August, the capture of Washington, and the attack on Baltimore on 12 September, when he was aide-de-camp to Major-General Robert Ross, who was killed. He also served in the operations against New Orleans in December 1814 and January 1815, was aide-de-camp to Lieutenant-General Sir Edward Pakenham, who was killed at the assault on 7 January, and took part in the siege of Fort Bowyer in Florida. Following service in France, Ireland, and Nova Scotia, Macdougall assumed command of the 79th highlanders in 1832, and quelled civil disturbances in Montreal. In 1835 he relinquished the command of his regiment and retired from the active list in order to join the British Auxiliary Legion of Spain as quartermaster-general and second in command under Sir De Lacy Evans. For his services in Spain he received from Queen Isabella II the order of knighthood of St Ferdinand.<br>
<br>On 18 July 1838 he was knighted at St James's Palace. He was twice married: first, in 1817, to Anne, daughter of Colonel Smelt, governor of the Isle of Man, with whom he had a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17470/', "Patrick Leonard MacDougall")</script>, and, second, in 1844, to Hannah, widow of Colonel Nicholson of Springfield House, Liverpool. In later years Macdougall raised the Lancashire artillery militia and became a prominent figure in the volunteer movement. He presided at the great meeting at St Martin's Hall, London, at which the movement was inaugurated. His publications included the pamphlet <span class="italic">Hints to Volunteers on Various Subjects</span> (1860) and <span class="italic">The History of the Volunteer Movement</span> (1861). He died on 10 December 1862 at his home, 112 Eaton Square, London, and was buried in St Paul's Cathedral, London, where a monument with a bust by Adams was erected to his memory.<br>
