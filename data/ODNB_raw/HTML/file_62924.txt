<span class="headword">Hurst,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1787, <em>d.</em> 1844), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was baptized on 2 May 1787 in Doncaster, the son of William Hurst, keeper of The Salutation inn, and his wife, Mary. He was articled to William Lindley (<i>c</i>.1739&#150;1818), who had been a long-serving assistant of John Carr of York before establishing his own practice in Doncaster. In 1811 Hurst exhibited two drawings at the Royal Academy. From <i>c</i>.1810 Lindley was in partnership with John Woodhead (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1838) and, on the former's death in 1818, the practice became Woodhead and Hurst. On 27 April 1820 Hurst married Sophia Elizabeth Pearson (<i>bap</i>. 1796, <i>d</i>. 1822), who died when their only child, Mary Sophia, was born. Two years later, on 16 November 1824, he married Charlotte Jane Innes (<i>d</i>. 1856). Hurst took a great interest in civic affairs, served on numerous committees, was mayor of Doncaster for the year 1828&#150;9, and became a magistrate for the borough. He acquired several houses and pieces of land in the town and, after his father's death (probably in 1828), became owner of The Salutation inn.<br>
<br>The Woodhead and Hurst practice was based at South Parade, Doncaster, and around the 1820s designed various improvements for the town, such as a library (1819&#150;21), substantial additions to the racecourse buildings (1823&#150;4), a gasworks (1826&#150;7), betting rooms in High Street (1826), and a new gaol (1829). The latter is known to have been by Hurst (then mayor), as was the imposing Christ Church (1827&#150;9), which shows Hurst's early assurance in the handling of Gothic (and is the only survivor of the buildings listed above). The practice was not confined to the Doncaster area and carried out work elsewhere in Yorkshire and in Derbyshire. The partners could turn their hands to a variety of styles. About 1820 they remodelled Firbeck Hall, West Riding, Yorkshire, with Jacobethan detailing, for Henry Gally Knight and built the church in Firbeck, using a mixture of late Norman and Early English. For Colonel James Wilson, also about 1820, they built the castellated mansion of Sneaton Castle 1&frac12; miles west of Whitby, North Riding, Yorkshire, complete with a curtain wall separating the grounds from the road. Sneaton church, also for Wilson, is a mixture of Perpendicular and Early English. Churches formed an important element in the work of the practice, with examples in Sheffield (St George's, 1821&#150;5), Pateley Bridge (1825&#150;7), and Stannington (1828) in the West Riding, and New Brampton (1830&#150;31) and Ridgeway (1838&#150;40) in Derbyshire. In 1824 Woodhead and Hurst planned the new town of Goole, Yorkshire, for the Aire and Calder Navigation Company, whose first docks there opened in 1826. The first houses were occupied in 1826, the year the docks and canal were officially opened, and building continued until the early 1840s.<br>
<br>In 1836 Hurst was elected a fellow of the Institute of British Architects. The following year he proposed an ambitious scheme to redevelop the area of Doncaster market with new buildings and roads but this remained unexecuted. On the death of Woodhead about 1838, Hurst took on a new partner, William Lambie Moffatt (1808&#150;1882), a Scot and a pupil of William Burn. The practice continued to undertake a mixture of secular and ecclesiastical commissions, most of them away from Doncaster. Hurst and Moffatt designed the Greek revival New Independent Chapel in East Parade, Leeds (1839&#150;41), Gothic churches at Grosmont (North Riding, 1840), Woodsetts and Ardsley (both West Riding, 1841), and a Romanesque church at Rock Ferry (Cheshire, 1841&#150;2). In 1842&#150;4 they were responsible for the Clipstone archway in the drive at Welbeck Abbey for the duke of Portland. There were also various public buildings in Leeds and Wakefield, but these were mainly the work of Moffatt. Their grandest work, for the new town of Goole, is the church of St John (1843&#150;8), which Pevsner found &#145;remarkably large and stately&#146;  (Pevsner, 223). Although its Perpendicular detail was passing out of fashion, the generous scale and the fine proportions of the tall crossing tower and spire might have impressed the choosy critics of the day. But long before the church was complete, Hurst died of &#145;disorder of the heart&#146; at his home at 6 Regent Terrace, South Parade, Doncaster, on 8 December 1844, aged fifty-seven. He was buried five days later in Doncaster.<br>
