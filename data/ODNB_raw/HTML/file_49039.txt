<span class="headword">Streatfeild,  Lucy Anne Evelyn  Deane</span>  (1865&#150;1950), <span class="occ">factory inspector and social worker</span>, was born at Madras, India, on 31 July 1865, and was baptized there on the following day, the daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Bonar Millett Deane (1834&#150;1881) and his wife, the Hon. Lucy Boscawen, a sister of the sixth Viscount Falmouth. Her father served in India and South Africa, and was killed at Laing's Neck on 28 January 1881 during the Anglo-Transvaal War. Her mother died in March 1886.<br>
<br>In the 1890s Lucy Deane trained as a health worker and lecturer for the National Health Society, a charitable body established to provide some professional training for those working in a largely amateur, altruistic service. In 1893 she and Rose Squire (1861&#150;1938) were appointed by the vestry of St Mary Abbots in Kensington as sanitary inspectors of workshops and factories that employed women. Both were subsequently appointed as factory inspectors by the Home Office, Deane in 1894 and Squire in 1895. The work of the early women's inspectorate, headed by May Abraham (later Tennant), was arduous: they faced antagonism from employers and in many cases from workers, as well as from their male colleagues. The women travelled long distances throughout Britain and Ireland, on public transport or by bicycle, often without revealing the nature of their work to protect the women whose working conditions they were investigating. In Ireland, where Deane undertook several periods of duty, she was particularly angered by the truck system, noting that even the priests would not support the workers and that there was &#145;utter disregard for law and justice, terrible tales of the corruption of the magistrates&#146;  (Deane Streatfeild MSS, business diaries, 9 Nov 1897). In 1900 there were only seven women factory inspectors, and Lucy Deane was in charge of 4000 workshops (including the court dressmakers') in west London alone  (<span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, 13 July 1900, 5).<br>
<br>In 1901 Deane was one of the six women appointed by the British government to report on conditions in the South African concentration camps (the committee of inquiry into the South African War concentration camps, chaired by Millicent Fawcett), approaching the work in much the same way as she did that of factory inspection. In letters to her sister, Hyacinthe Mary (<i>d</i>. 1903), an inspector of domestic science and one of the first women inspectors in the education department, she gave a detailed account of the committee's travels in South Africa, and sometimes complained about the unprofessional methods of her colleagues. Although she usually got on well with her companions, she described herself as &#145;one against five&#146; because she disagreed with them on so many points  (Deane Streatfeild MSS, letter to Hyacinthe Deane, 23 Dec 1901). It was largely at her insistence that the committee's report included criticisms of the operation of the camps system.<br>
<br>In 1906 Deane resigned from the factory inspectorate because of ill health, and moved from London to Westerham in Kent, where she lived until her death. On 16 March 1911 she married Granville Edward Stewart Streatfeild (1868/9&#150;1947), an architect; they had no children. She remained an active voluntary worker. She was the first woman organizing officer for the National Health Insurance Commission, and organized infant welfare centres in London; she was also a member of various trade boards. In 1912, she was one of the two women (the other was E. S. Haldane) appointed to the royal commission on the civil service. She supported female suffrage, and lectured for the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. In 1913 she was one of the organizers of the women's suffrage pilgrimage from Westerham and district, which joined the union's rally of about 50,000 people held in Hyde Park on 26 July 1913.<br>
<br>During the First World War, Lucy Deane Streatfeild was a member of the executive committee of the Women's Land Army in Kent. She was a member of the War Office appeals committee, which adjudicated on separation allowances for soldiers' and sailors' dependants, and of a special arbitration tribunal to settle disputes over wages and conditions in munitions works. In 1918 she was appointed chairman of a committee of inquiry into the conduct of members of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps in France, and was appointed CBE.<br>
<br>After the war Deane Streatfeild was one of the first women JPs (appointed in 1920), and a member of Kent county council. She was a leading member of the Women's Institute and was one of the founders of the Westerham branch, of which she became the president. She was an enthusiastic producer of amateur theatre and mounted village productions of several Shakespeare plays. She was a member of the University Women's Club and of the National Union of Working Women. She published a number of articles on aspects of factory work and industrial legislation. She died on 3 July 1950 at her home, Cottage on the Hill, Westerham, Kent, and was buried at Westerham on 7 July. She was remembered by her contemporaries as a lively and inspiring colleague with a strong social conscience&#151;an impression confirmed by the account of her work left in her business diaries.<br>
