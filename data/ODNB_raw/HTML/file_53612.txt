<span class="headword">Brown,  Albert Richard</span>  (1839&#150;1913), <span class="occ">shipping agent and consul for Japan</span>, was born on 29 August 1839 at Ringwood, in Hampshire, the son of Richard Brown, wine merchant and clerk to the Ringwood board of guardians, and his wife, Mary Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pritchard. In 1853 he went to sea as a cabin-boy on the brig <i>Industrious</i>, leaving the vessel four years later as an able seaman. In 1860 he obtained his second mate's certificate, and the following year joined the <i>Malta</i>, of the Peninsular and Oriental Steamship Company (P. &amp; O.), as fourth officer. He obtained a first mate's certificate in 1866, and joined the P. &amp; O.'s <i>Malacca</i> as first officer. He married on 19 May 1866 Louisa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pyne (<i>b</i>. 1840/41). His only son, Edward Albert, was born in 1867.<br>
<br>The voyages of the <i>Malacca</i> took Brown to the Far East, and he obtained his master's certificate in Hong Kong. In February 1869 Richard H. Brunton (1841&#150;1901), the engineer supervising the construction of a network of lighthouses on the Japanese coast (and who had sailed to Japan on Brown's ship), advised the lighthouse section of Japan's department of public works to engage Brown as the master of the lighthouse-tender <i>Tomio Maru</i>. The steamer transported supplies and equipment to lighthouse sites, and Brown assisted on numerous survey expeditions around the coast of Japan and in the investigation of potential sites for lighthouses and beacons&#151;work which was vital in the development of Japan's coastal and foreign trade. In March 1870 Brown took command of a new ship, the <i>Thabor</i>. His seamanship impressed the Japanese authorities, and in 1871 he was asked to train Japanese students in the skills of navigation. His pupils went on to form the core of the country's mercantile marine service.<br>
<br>In 1874 the Japanese government launched an expedition to Taiwan to punish the Botan population for atrocities committed on shipwrecked Japanese sailors. The American and British governments refused to permit the chartering of ships for the expedition, and there was a danger that, as the Japanese did not have suitable transports to carry men and material, the expedition would result in humiliating failure. The <i>Thabor</i> was requisitioned as a transport, and Brown was asked to purchase and fit out five other ships for the purpose. He personally commanded one, the former P. &amp; O. steamer <i>Delta</i> (renamed <i>Takasago Maru</i>), and carried General Saigo and 1500 men to a landing at Lingkiao Bay. The expedition was successful, and the grateful Japanese government announced that Brown would be rewarded with the payment of 3000 yen and invested with the order of the Rising Sun, fourth class. Although the British government initially refused to give its approval, he was finally permitted to accept the honour in April 1881.<br>
<br>In late August 1874 Brown was commanded to return to Britain to take delivery of a new lighthouse-tender, <i>Meiji Maru</i>, from Robert Napier &amp; Sons' shipyard in Glasgow. While in Britain he received instructions to purchase two more steamers for the shipping company Mitsubishi Shokai. He returned to Japan in 1875, and was invited to help form a marine bureau and to take charge of its shipbuilding and mercantile marine activities. While holding this government office he continued to act for Mitsubishi, and returned to Britain in 1877 to supervise the construction of new ships for the company. In 1883 he returned again to supervise the construction of ships for the Kiodo Unyu Kaisha (the &#145;National transportation company&#146;), and another for Mitsubishi.<br>
<br>In 1885 Kiodo Unyu Kaisha and Mitsubishi merged to form the Nippon Yusen Kaisha (the &#145;Japanese mail steamship company&#146;) (NYK), Japan's leading shipping line. Brown was appointed general manager, and travelled extensively in the Far East in 1886 to investigate the company's existing services and the potential for expansion. The following year he returned to Britain to supervise the construction of ships for NYK, and in March 1889 he resigned as NYK's general manager in order to stay in Britain to supervise the company's building programme and other business affairs there. Before he left, in the summer, he was awarded the order of the Rising Sun, third class, and appointed consul for Japan in Glasgow.<br>
<br>In 1889 Brown formed his own company, A. R. Brown, to handle his agency work for the Japanese and to trade as Japan merchants and consulting engineers. In 1899 his son joined him as a partner in A. R. Brown &amp; Co., and in 1900 they formed a private limited liability company, A. R. Brown, McFarlane &amp; Co. Ltd, in partnership with George McFarlane, a consulting engineer and naval architect. The firm designed, placed contracts for, and supervised the construction of most of the warships and merchant vessels built in Britain for Japanese customers prior to the First World War.<br>
<br>As Japan's consul in Glasgow, Brown was responsible for the welfare of Japanese students who visited the city, and his young charges included the sons of some of Japan's leading families. In 1909 he was awarded the order of the Sacred Treasure, second class.<br>
<br>Brown was a keen yachtsman and a member of the Royal Clyde and Clyde Corinthian yacht clubs. His Scottish home, Summerhill, was in the village of Shandon, on the Gareloch, and he was a member of the executive&#151;and from 1909 until his death the chairman&#151;of the Clyde training ship for boys, the <i>Empress</i>. The Browns had a home, Furlong House, in Ringwood, Hampshire, and also spent long holidays in Bournemouth.<br>
<br>Albert Brown died at Parkstone, Dorset, on 7 March 1913, and was buried five days later at Ringwood. He was survived by his wife and son. He is remembered in Japan as a pioneer of that country's steam navigation, a hero of the Taiwan expedition, and one of the founders of the Japanese mercantile marine.<br>
