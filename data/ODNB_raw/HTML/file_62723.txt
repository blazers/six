<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lind,  Letty</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Letitia Elizabeth Rudge]</span>  (1861&#150;1923), <span class="occ">actress and dancer</span>, was born Letitia Elizabeth Rudge on 21 December 1861, at her father's residence, Back 159, Irving Street, Birmingham. Letty was the eldest daughter in the family of five daughters and three sons of Henry Rudge, in turn a gas fitter, brass worker, chandelier maker, and brass founder, and his wife, Annie Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hemming. Some sources indicate that her parents had theatre connections; all of their five daughters went on the stage and achieved varying degrees of success. Letty began to dance at the age of four, taking lessons from a &#145;Signor Guerino&#146;&#151;possibly John Guarrino Warren (1828/9&#150;1876), then working in the midlands. In 1867 she made her first stage appearance as Eva in <span class="italic">Uncle Tom's Cabin</span> at the Theatre Royal, Birmingham. In 1872 and 1873, billed as La Petite Letitia, she was seen in several ballets at Day's Crystal Palace in the same city and by 1874, as Letty Rudge, she was in Mme Collier's ballet <span class="italic">La Plaisir</span> at the Metropolitan in London. In the following year she had a minor role in the Drury Lane pantomime <span class="italic">Aladdin!</span> About this period she toured for a while with Emily Saker's company before joining Howard Paul (1830&#150;1905) in his &#145;musical, comical and fanciful entertainments&#146;. By 1877 she had assumed the stage name of Letty Lind and had replaced Paul's wife, both in a professional and a private capacity.<br>
<br>On 10 July 1878, still only sixteen, Lind gave birth to a daughter at Howard Paul's home, 6 Great Russell Street, London. The child, also named Letty Rudge, died a few days later. The father's name was not registered on the birth certificate. On 9 October 1880 Letty gave birth to a son, named Henry Howard Paul Rudge, although in adulthood he became known as Horace Howard. The father's name was not registered, but he was acknowledged to be Howard Paul, with whom Letty and their son were living at 19 Montague Place, London. Soon after the birth Howard Paul ceased his theatrical activities, reverting to his original career in journalism. After a brief period working with Charles du Val, Lind pursued an independent career, achieving some success in plays and musical theatre in London and performing principal roles in provincial pantomimes.<br>
<br>Early in 1887 Lind began her long and successful association with George Edwardes, initially in the last of the burlesques which he staged at the Gaiety Theatre in London, and subsequently in his early musical comedies at Daly's Theatre. She first joined the cast of the burlesque melodrama <span class="italic">Monte Cristo, Junior</span>, taking over a role previously played by Lottie Collins. Although she apparently had little voice Lind was frequently given songs with which she managed, with the addition of a dance and much charm, to make herself a great popular favourite. At Christmas 1887 she found herself &#145;on loan&#146; to Augustus Harris at Drury Lane, appearing as Princess Sweetarte in <span class="italic">Puss in Boots</span>, but she was back with the Gaiety company in 1888, achieving some personal success during their tour of Australia and the USA. After returning to London she created minor roles at the Gaiety in the burlesques <span class="italic">Ruy Blas and the Blas&eacute; Rue</span> and <span class="italic">Carmen up to Data</span>. In the latter she performed two solo songs, one of which deployed her talent for animal imitations (especially birds and farmyard animals), and a solo dance which incorporated moves of the skirt dance with its &#145;swift rush of floating draperies through the air&#146;  (Hindson, 71), pioneered at the Gaiety by her predecessor Kate Vaughan.<br>
<br>Letty Lind became perhaps the foremost skirt dancer during the height of the dance's popularity at the end of the 1880s and in the early 1890s. &#145;Light-footed&#146; and &#145;lissom-limbed&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>), she was one of the few skirt dancers who had the advantage of a &#145;classical&#146; training, but she was not averse to adding the odd acrobatic touch, especially to the conclusion of her dances. For nearly two decades she was universally acclaimed in the press as the foremost dancer in her sphere, the embodiment of charm and grace but also with a lively sense of humour. Widely represented on picture postcards, she was the subject of a portrait by Hubert von Herkomer conveying &#145;the poetry and vivacity of the &#147;serpentine dance&#148;&#146; which she had parodied with her own &#145;imitations and novel ideas&#146; in 1893  (Shaftesbury Theatre advertisement in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, 31 July 1893). She appeared in many charitable and &#145;try-out&#146; matinees, and benefit performances.<br>
<br>On 15 January 1892, at Stanhope Street, Hyde Park Gardens, London, Lind gave birth to her second son, John Reginald Harraton Rudge (whose surname was later changed to Harraton). The father's name was not registered but he was acknowledged to be John George Lambton (1855&#150;1928), third earl of Durham, whose wife was by 1891 a patient in an asylum (Lambton's action in 1885 to nullify his marriage on the ground of her insanity had been dismissed). In May 1892, back at the Gaiety, Lind succeeded to the title role, created by Nellie Farren, in <span class="italic">Cinder-Ellen up Too Late</span>. During 1893 and 1894 she scored immense personal success, becoming the talk of the town, under a new management, in two &#145;musical farcical comedies&#146;, <span class="italic">Morocco Bound</span> and <span class="italic">Go-Bang</span> at the Trafalgar Square Theatre. The illustrated sheet music of her songs was in great demand. She received much press coverage, and even published a short story and articles on dancing and costume. The accomplished mimic Cissie Loftus gave impersonations of both Lind and her sister <a href="#cosubject_105626">Millie Hylton [<i>see below</i>]</a> as part her act at the Palace Theatre, in London, and around the country.<br>
<br>Towards the end of 1894 Lind returned to George Edwardes's management to take over the leading role in a musical comedy, <span class="italic">A Gaiety Girl</span>, on its transfer to Daly's Theatre. A string of notable performances by Lind followed, in which she co-starred with Marie Tempest (1864&#150;1942) in further musical comedies <span class="italic">An Artist's Model</span>, <span class="italic">The Geisha</span>, and <span class="italic">A Greek Slave</span>, all at Daly's. Meanwhile, in 1895, she composed a song, with lyrics by Adrian Ross, for her sister Adelaide Astor to sing in <span class="italic">A Lady Slavey</span> at the Avenue Theatre. In 1899 she took a lengthy engagement in a variety programme at the Alhambra, where she received &pound;90 a week (more than any other solo artist on the bill), followed by a week or two at the London Pavilion. At the end of that year she made her last appearance in pantomime as Princess Ivy in <span class="italic">Puss in Boots</span>, at the Garrick Theatre. In 1902 she made her last appearance in a West End show, again under the banner of George Edwardes, in a musical play, <span class="italic">The Girl from Kay's</span>, at the Apollo Theatre.<br>
<br>After her relatively early retirement from the stage Lind settled at her country property, Brookside, situated on the Bath Road at the fashionable Salt Hill, Slough, near Windsor, in five acres of grounds, well stocked with trees, where she could indulge her passion for gardening and her pets. Her relationship with Durham seems to have continued until her death, at Brookside, on 27 August 1923. Her funeral took place at St Mary's Church, Slough, and she was buried in Windsor cemetery. She left her country house to Durham &#145;for his lifetime&#146;, after which it was to pass to their son, John R. Harraton.<br>
<br>Letty's four younger sisters, all of whom were born in Birmingham, followed her on to the stage at an early age and at one time or another all worked for George Edwardes. The eldest, <a name="cosubject_105626"></a><span class="headword">Millie Hylton</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Sarah Frances Louise Rudge; <em>married name </em>Sim]</span>  (1870&#150;1920)<span class="occ"></span>, was born at 22 Hope Street, Birmingham, on 8 February 1870, and was reputedly only four years old when she first went on the stage at the Theatre Royal, Birmingham. Carving herself a career as a male impersonator in music hall before she was eighteen, she was engaged by George Edwardes for the Gaiety, where she made a success in <span class="italic">Monte Cristo, Junior</span>. After returning to the halls she made successful trips to New York in 1888 and 1889 to appear with Tony Pastor's company. She also became established in pantomime, making the first of her many appearances around the country, as principal boy, at the Theatre Royal, Brighton, in 1890. It would appear that in about 1891 she lived, for about two years, as his common law wife, with the prestigious variety agent Hugh J. Didcott (1836?&#150;1909), who had represented her since 1887. After returning to the regular stage Millie appeared in the Gaiety pieces <span class="italic">In Town</span> and <span class="italic">Don Juan</span> (in the title role), <span class="italic">The Circus Girl</span> on tour, and in <span class="italic">Biarritz</span> at the Prince of Wales's. Among Millie's most successful songs were &#145;The Rowdy-dowdy Boys&#146;, &#145;Linger Longer Loo&#146;, and &#145;The Last of the Dandies&#146;. On 30 April 1894 she married &#145;a young gentleman of means&#146;, Henry Edward Clulow Sim (1872/3&#150;1901), son of William Clulow Sim of the Indian civil service, and in 1895 gave birth to their daughter Millie Sim, who later, for a while, had a promising career as an actress. In 1896 Millie sued Harry Sim for divorce, alleging physical and verbal abuse, but they remained married until his early death, from consumption, in 1901. In her later years Millie successfully appeared in a number of West End plays for various managers including her brother-in-law George Grossmith and Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree. She died of cancer, aged fifty, at her home, 13 Langdale Gardens, Aldrington, Hove, Sussex, on 31 August 1920 and was buried at Putney Vale cemetery.<br>
<br>Letty Lind's youngest sister, <a name="cosubject_105627"></a><span class="headword">Fanny Dango</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Rudge; <em>married name </em>Mackay]</span>  (1878&#150;1972)<span class="occ"></span> was born at 31 Anderton Street, Ladywood, Birmingham, on 20 October 1878. It would appear that she also started her career in pantomime at Birmingham, but she was soon to be found under George Edwardes's banner at Daly's Theatre and on tour in <span class="italic">The Geisha</span> (1896/7). In 1897 she took over roles in <span class="italic">A Runaway Girl</span> (Gaiety Theatre) and <span class="italic">Little Miss Nobody</span> (Lyric Theatre). Under the management of Tom B. Davis (<i>b</i>. 1867) she appeared in <span class="italic">Floradora</span> at the Lyric, but left to undertake a more important role in his touring production of the same piece (1901/2) and then repeated this pattern in <span class="italic">The Silver Slipper</span>. In 1903 she toured with George Dance's company in <span class="italic">Three Little Maids</span>, assuming the role played by her sister Lydia Flopp in London. In 1904 she was back with George Edwardes, playing the title role in the tour of <span class="italic">San Toy</span> and, in 1905, at the Gaiety in <span class="italic">Spring Chicken</span>. Meanwhile she had appeared as principal girl in pantomimes at Newcastle and Liverpool in 1903 and 1904. In 1907 Fanny was invited by J. C. Williamson to join his Royal Comic Opera Company in Australia, where she had much success playing supporting roles in <span class="italic">The Dairymaids</span>, <span class="italic">The Belle of New York</span>, <span class="italic">The Merry Widow</span>, and <span class="italic">The Girls of Gottenburg</span> on tour in Australia and New Zealand. On 28 November 1910 she married, in London, Samuel Peter Mackay (1863&#150;1923), a wealthy Australian with wide pastoral property and racehorse interests, the son of Duncan Mackay; he had previously been married to Florence Gertrude Taylor, from whom he was divorced. After a honeymoon in Scotland they settled in Melbourne. Before the Second World War their son, Peter Angus Mackay (1911&#150;1951), was engaged in film production with London Films, where his cousin, George E. T. Grossmith (1906&#150;1997), was a casting director. After her husband's demise Fanny lived on in Melbourne, in some comfort, until her own death, at Mount Waverley, Victoria, Australia, on 15 July 1972. She was buried with her husband, son, and step-daughter, the actress Elsie Mackay (1894&#150;1963), at Brighton General cemetery, Melbourne.<br>
<br>Of the remaining two Rudge sisters, Elizabeth Gertrude Rudge (1873&#150;1951) had a shorter career, first in music halls as Cissie Lind, but mainly in musical comedy using the name Adelaide Astor. In 1895 she married the actor&#150;manager George Grossmith (1874&#150;1935), and appears to have retired from the stage soon after the birth of the first of their three children. She died in London in 1951. Meanwhile Lydia Flopp 
    (<i>real name</i> Lydia Agnes Rudge; 1877&#150;1963)
   followed in the wake of her sisters in musical comedy. In 1904 she married Maurice ffolliott Rhys Wingfield (1878&#150;1941). They had a child, Muriel Violet, in 1905 but they divorced unhappily in 1911 after he left her. She continued working for several years including a brief spell in 1909/10 with her sister Fanny Dango for J. C. Williamson in Australia. She died in Northwood, Middlesex, in 1963, never having been reconciled with her daughter.<br>
