<span class="headword">O'Donovan,  Edmund</span>  (1844&#150;1883), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born at Dublin on 13 September 1844, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20561/', "Dr John O'Donovan (1806&#150;1861)")</script> and his wife, Mary Anne Broughton, and received his early education at a Jesuit day school, St Francis Xavier's College. Thence he went to the Royal College of Science at St Stephen's Green, Dublin. Subsequently he studied medicine at Trinity College, Dublin, where he gained prizes for chemistry, but never graduated. During his course he held the appointments of clerk to the registrar and assistant librarian. Having also shown great taste for heraldry, he was appointed aide to Sir Bernard Burke, Ulster king of arms, and carried a banner at the installation of the duke of Connaught as knight of St Patrick. According to Justin McCarthy, when a young man O'Donovan was engaged in the Fenian movement, and after its failure turned to journalism, an occupation favoured by middle-class Irishmen.<br>
<br>In 1866 O'Donovan began his newspaper career by occasionally contributing to the <span class="italic">Irish Times</span> and other Dublin papers. Between then and 1870 he made several journeys to France and America, and in the latter continued his medical studies, attending courses at the Bellevue Hospital medical college, New York. After the Franco-Prussian War broke out in 1870, O'Donovan's adventurous spirit led him to join the foreign legion, after Sedan. He took part in the battles round Orl&eacute;ans, and was wounded and made prisoner. Interned at Straubing in Bavaria, he sent to several Dublin and London papers accounts of his experiences. When the Carlist rising took place in 1873 he went to Spain, and many letters from him were published in <span class="italic">The Times</span> and <span class="italic">The Hour</span>. In the summer of 1876, when Bosnia and Herzegovina rose against the Turks, he went to the scene as <span class="italic">Daily News</span> correspondent. In 1877 he went as its correspondent to Asia Minor, where he remained during the Russo-Turkish War (1877&#150;8).<br>
<br>In 1879 O'Donovan, still in search of adventure, undertook, again as <span class="italic">Daily News</span> correspondent, his celebrated journey to Merv in Turkestan&#151;a daring, difficult, and hazardous feat, with which his name became associated. From the Russian advanced posts on the south-eastern shores of the Caspian Sea he travelled through Khorasan, and eventually, with great difficulty and at considerable risk, accompanied only by two native servants, he reached Merv. He was at first suspected by the Turkomans of being an agent of the Russians, who were then threatening an advance on Merv. For several months he consequently remained in Merv in a sort of honourable captivity, in danger of death any day, and with no prospect of release.<br>
<br>According to his own account, O'Donovan helped mount artillery, and was made one of the ruling triumvirate. He managed to send into Persia a message, which was thence telegraphed to John Robinson, the manager of the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>. In this dispatch O'Donovan explained his position, and appealed to his friend: &#145;For God's sake get me out of this&#146;. Robinson applied to the Foreign Office and to the Russian ambassador in London, and immediate steps were taken to effect O'Donovan's release. However, by his own efforts, combining courage with diplomacy, he extricated himself from his perilous position. On returning to London &#145;the man of Merv&#146; was a celebrity, and he read a paper to the Royal Geographical Society. In 1882 he published a book on his adventures, <span class="italic">The Merv oasis: travels and adventures east of the Caspian during the years 1879, 1880, and 1881</span> (2 vols.).<br>
<br>O'Donovan was an eccentric, nomadic &#145;incurable Bohemian&#146; who likened himself while living in London to &#145;a Red Indian in patent leather boots&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fifty Years of Fleet Street</span>, 178). His London rooms were &#145;a cross between a laboratory and an arsenal&#146;  (O'Shea, 15). He enjoyed playing practical jokes, firing pistol blanks out of his windows, smoking a water pipe, and reciting from Thomas Moore's <span class="italic">Lalla Rookh</span>. From the window of his Bloomsbury lodgings he shot the hat off a dozing cabman with his airgun, after which his landlady told him to leave: &#145;this is not a private mad-house&#146;  (ibid., 17). He moved to an Irish hotel in Holborn where his ways were understood.<br>
<br>In 1883 O'Donovan went to the Sudan as <span class="italic">Daily News</span> correspondent, and accompanied the army of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13218/', "William Hicks Pasha")</script>, which marched on al-&#145;Ubayd to suppress the Mahdists in the Sudan. He wrote in a letter that &#145;to die out here, with a lance-head as big as a shovel through me, will meet my views better than the slow, gradual sinking into the grave&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fifty Years of Fleet Street</span>, 178&#150;9). On 3 November 1883 the army was ambushed at Kashgil, near al-&#145;Ubayd, and on that and the two following days was annihilated. No information was received of O'Donovan's fate, but there can be no doubt that he died with the other Europeans. Probate of his will, however, was not granted until 1891, as there was a lingering hope that he would reappear. A tall, handsome man, &#145;slender, black, thin-visaged, and straight in the nose&#146;  (O'Shea, 8), O'Donovan was kindly, genial, generous, and popular, as restless and adventurous as he was brave. His attainments were broad rather than deep. He was a good linguist, speaking French, German, Spanish, and Jagatai Tartar. He knew something of medicine and botany, and was a fair draughtsman and a good surveyor. He was an intrepid traveller who achieved much, though apparently also a flamboyant poseur in the quasi-Byronic tradition of Victorian exotic adventuring.<br>
