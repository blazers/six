<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lygon,  Frederick</span>, sixth Earl Beauchamp  (1830&#150;1891), <span class="occ">Church of England layman and politician</span>, was born on 10 November 1830, the third son of Henry, fourth Earl Beauchamp (1784&#150;1863), and Lady Susan Caroline Eliot (1801&#150;1835), daughter of William, second earl of St Germans.<br>
<br>The Lygon family was settled at Madresfield, Worcestershire, from the mid-fifteenth century, and was connected with the Beauchamp family through Richard Lygon, who married Anne, daughter of Richard Beauchamp, second and last Baron Beauchamp of Powick (<i>d</i>. 1503). William Lygon, seventh in descent from Anne, died in 1720, leaving a daughter Margaret, who married as her first husband Reginald Pyndar, and by him was mother of Reginald Pyndar, who assumed the surname of Lygon. He died in 1788, having married Susannah, daughter of William Hanmer, and was father of <a name="cosubject_17246"></a><span class="headword">William Lygon</span>, first Earl Beauchamp  (1747&#150;1816)<span class="occ"></span>. The first earl, born on 25 July 1747, matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 2 May 1764. He represented the county of Worcester in parliament from 1775, as a follower of Pitt from 1783 until 1806, when he was created Baron Beauchamp of Powyk, Worcestershire. At his father's death in 1788 he had succeeded to estates in Worcestershire, Warwickshire, Derbyshire, and Gloucestershire. These were the patrimony of no more than a well-to-do squire, but in 1798 he inherited part of the vast personal wealth of William Jennens, a kinsman of his mother, enabling him considerably to increase his Worcestershire property and influence. On 1 December 1815 he was made Viscount Elmley and Earl Beauchamp. He died suddenly at his house in St James's Square, London, on 21 October 1816. He had married, on 1 November 1780, Catharine, daughter of James Denn, and their children included William Beauchamp, John Reginald, and Henry Beauchamp, successively second, third, and fourth earls. His widow, a formidable businesswoman and a discriminating collector, survived until 1844, outliving her eldest son, who died in 1823.<br>
<br>Frederick Lygon was educated at Eton College (1844&#150;7), and matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 15 December 1848. He graduated BA in 1852 and was a fellow of All Souls College during 1852&#150;66. As an undergraduate he adopted Tractarian views and formed a lifelong friendship with Henry Parry Liddon. He resisted an attempt by Edward Howard to convert him to the Roman church, but hoped for some kind of inter-communion between Rome and Canterbury. He did not take Anglican orders, but instead became &#145;the ecclesiastical layman par excellence&#146;  (Chadwick, 2.365), representing the high-church party on committees and commissions, and contributing assiduously to journals and newspapers. As a religious author his most influential work was &#145;The day hours of the Church of England, newly transcribed and arranged according to the prayer book and the Authorised Version of the Bible&#146;, published anonymously in 1858. It was generally adopted as an office book by the Anglican communities, and remained in widespread use until recent years  (private information).<br>
<br>From 1857 Lygon also developed a parliamentary career, speaking frequently in the Commons and later in the Lords, although he was always a churchman first and a politician second. From March 1857 to April 1863 he sat as a Conservative for Tewkesbury, briefly holding office as a lord of the Admiralty in March 1859. In 1863, on the death of his father, he succeeded his elder brother Henry as MP for West Worcestershire, a seat he held until he himself became sixth Earl Beauchamp in March 1866. Like his brother before him he was a friend of Benjamin Disraeli, for whom he wrote speeches on church questions and whose second administration he joined, as lord steward, in 1874. Later he served under Salisbury as paymaster of the forces from June 1885 until January 1886, and again from August 1886 until July 1887.<br>
<br>On inheriting the Beauchamp estates in 1866 one of his first tasks had been to complete the reconstruction of Madresfield Court begun by the fifth earl, including the provision of a chapel (the remarkable decoration of which was to be the work of the next generation). In February 1868 he married Lady Mary Catherine Stanhope (<i>b</i>. 1844), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26256/', "Philip Henry Stanhope, fifth Earl Stanhope (1805&#150;1875)")</script>, who died in 1876 having had five children, the eldest of whom, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34643/', "William Lygon (1872&#150;1938)")</script>, was to become the seventh Earl Beauchamp. Two years later, on 24 September 1878, he married Lady Emily Annora Charlotte Pierrepont (1853&#150;1935), daughter of the third Earl Manvers, with whom he had a further four children. His role as a conscientious Victorian landlord, combined with his enthusiasm for education and ecclesiastical architecture, resulted in the building of schools and chapels on his properties. He was involved locally in the foundation of Malvern College and the Alice Ottley School for Girls, Worcester, and at Oxford in the early years of Keble College and later in the establishment of Pusey House. He was made lord lieutenant of Worcestershire in 1876.<br>
<br>Born to a somewhat elderly father, and losing his mother at the age of five, Frederick was perhaps a rather reserved and lonely figure as a young man. Later he acquired a more worldly exterior, being remembered by Archbishop Benson as &#145;brusque&#146; and &#145;a very smart, bright man&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>). He had a love of music, and was a founder member of the St Cecilia Society: an early publication was a hymnal for Madresfield church in 1853. He was an FSA and a member of the Roxburghe Club, for which he edited the <span class="italic">Liber regalis</span> in 1870. He died on 19 February 1891 at Madresfield Court and was buried at Madresfield, characteristically leaving instructions that no tomb or monument was to be erected in his memory.<br>
