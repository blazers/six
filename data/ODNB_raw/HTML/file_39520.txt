<span class="headword">Synge,  Edward</span>  (1691&#150;1762), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland bishop of Elphin</span>, was born in Cork on 18 October 1691, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26901/', "Edward Synge (1659&#150;1741)")</script>, then vicar of Christ Church, Cork, and Jane 
    (or Anne; <i>d</i>. 1723)
  , daughter of the Revd Nicholas Proud (or Proude), also of Cork. His younger brother was Nicholas Synge, later bishop of Killaloe. He was educated in Cork by Mr Mulloy and entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1706, and became BA in 1709; in 1710 he became a fellow of the college, and in the same year junior dean. His father became archbishop of Tuam in 1716, and the younger Synge was therefore well placed for advancement. In 1719 he was given the living of St Audoen's, Dublin, which carried with it a prebendal stall in St Patrick's Cathedral. In the following year he married Jane Curtis (<i>d</i>. 1737), daughter of Robert Curtis of Roscrea, co. Tipperary, MP for Duleek, and Sarah Curtis. Having been made provost of Tuam in 1726, he was consecrated by his father as bishop of Clonfert in 1730, and in 1731 was translated to Cloyne. In 1733 he was again translated, to Ferns and Leighlin, and in 1740 he went to Elphin where he remained until his death.<br>
<br>Like his father, Synge took a robust view of the penal laws, which he criticized on the grounds that they encouraged a &#145;furious and blind zeal for religion&#146; which could disturb the civil state  (E. Synge, <span class="italic">The Care of Toleration Considered</span>, 2nd edn, 1726, 2). In his sermon to the joint houses of parliament in 1725 on the text &#145;Compel them to come in&#146;, he made a clear distinction between legislation to ensure public order and laws controlling private worship. Rather than compelling Catholics to become protestants by law, he advocated the education of Catholic children in protestant schools. This sermon resulted in a pamphlet controversy with Stephen Radcliffe, vicar of Naas, in which Synge, in his response to Radcliffe, set out a form of oath of allegiance suitable for Catholics loyal to the crown.<br>
<br>In the 1720s Synge was a member of the group who were close to Lord Molesworth, a follower of Shaftesbury. George Berkeley, whose lectures Synge had attended at college, was another member of this circle. It was probably here that Synge met the Presbyterian minister Francis Hutcheson, who had been invited to Dublin in 1720 to start a dissenting academy. Hutcheson acknowledges a deep debt to Synge's critique of the text in his <span class="italic">Inquiry into the Original of our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue</span> (1726), and, from Hutcheson's philosophical writing and Synge's correspondence, it is clear that they shared many attitudes.<br>
<br>Politically Synge was active: Chesterfield, as lord lieutenant in 1746, described him as one of the most able members of the Irish House of Lords. With Lord Roden he involved himself in the regulation of the linen trade. During the money bill dispute of 1753, he took the side of the speaker, Henry Boyle, in opposition to Primate Stone and the lord lieutenant, the duke of Bedford. Synge was intellectually lively and extremely well read, and had a considerable library. He was also musical and made a strong impression on Handel, who described him as &#145;a Nobleman very learned in Musick&#146;, when on his visit to Dublin in 1742  (Luckett, 132). Synge attended the first performance of <span class="italic">The Messiah</span> and wrote a warm appreciation of the work to Handel, suggesting a sequel, <span class="italic">The Penitent</span>.<br>
<br>Synge was wealthy through his marriage settlement and because of a life interest he inherited in the estate of his uncle, Samuel Synge, dean of Kildare. He himself acknowledged that he was also prosperous through his active management of his church estates. He was an improving farmer and, as a member of the linen board, he invested in flax seed, looms, and spinning-wheels to encourage the manufacture of cloth in co. Roscommon. Like his father before him he devoted part of his wealth to the improvement of the ministry of the Church of Ireland in his diocese. In Ferns and Leighlin he justified the collection of tithes on dry cattle (tithe agistment) by using the moneys raised to encourage a resident clergy. In Elphin he built a new palace (now in ruins) and new churches. However, his financial judgement was not always wise, and he became involved in a parliamentary enquiry into charitable funds in 1760 because of his rather lax management of a trust.<br>
<br>Synge and his wife suffered the loss in childhood or early youth of all their children, except the youngest, Alicia; Jane Synge died in December 1737 when Alicia was five years old. It is through Synge's letters to Alicia, written between 1746 and 1752, that we know him best. They show him as a loving father, anxious both for his daughter's health and for her education and manners as the only child of a rich man.<br>
<br>Synge died at his house in Kevin Street, Dublin, on 27 January 1762. He was buried in the Synge vault in St Patrick's Cathedral.<br>
