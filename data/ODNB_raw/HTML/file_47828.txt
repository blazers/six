<span class="headword">Abbot,  John</span>  (1751&#150;1840?), <span class="occ">naturalist and artist</span>, born at Bennet Street, St James, London, on 1 June 1751, was the second of the five children of John Abbot (<i>d</i>. 1787), a prosperous attorney, and his wife, Ann Clousinger. As a youth, Abbot developed a passion for entomology and for drawing, an enthusiasm that was supported by his father, who retained Jacob Bonneau, an accomplished draughtsman, as an art instructor for his son. The elder Abbot also bought illustrated works of natural history, including George Edwards's four-volume classic, <span class="italic">A Natural History of Uncommon Birds</span> (1743&#150;51), which exerted a major stylistic influence on his son. The Abbots received as a gift a copy of Mark Catesby's <span class="italic">Natural History of Carolina, Florida, and the Bahama Islands</span> (1731&#150;43), a work that probably contributed to Abbot's later decision to move to America. As a teenager, Abbot achieved a remarkable mastery of artistic technique, and by 1770 was invited to exhibit his watercolour drawings of British insects at the Society of Artists of Great Britain, of which he was an honorary member. Apprenticed to his father as a law clerk in 1769, Abbot found that legal matters were &#145;little to my liking when my thoughts was ingrossed by Natural history&#146;; and in the same year he firmly resolved to pursue natural history as a career, after being awestruck by the vast entomological collections of Dru Drury. Under Drury's influence, Abbot decided to travel to North America; and in 1773, having received sponsorship from the Royal Society and from Drury and Thomas Martyn (<i>fl</i>. 1760&#150;1816), Abbot sailed to Virginia, where he began shipping specimens to his British patrons. In December 1775 he moved to the lower Savannah River area of Georgia, where he lived for the rest of his life, residing at various times in Savannah and in Bulloch, Burke, and Screven counties.<br>
<br>Abbot apparently supported himself almost entirely by providing specimens and watercolour drawings of insects, spiders, and birds to buyers in America and to his correspondents in Britain and Europe, including William Swainson, Heinrich Escher (1776&#150;1853), John Francillon (1744&#150;1816), Baron Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric de Lafresnaye (1783&#150;1861), Edward Smith Stanley, thirteenth earl of Derby, and John Latham. During much of his lifetime, Abbot was the most prolific and talented illustrator of birds and insects in America; and Swainson noted that Abbot's insect specimens were &#145;certainly the finest that have ever been transmitted as articles of commerce to this country&#146;  (Simpson, <span class="italic">North Carolina Historical Review</span>).<br>
<br>Because Abbot never published any works under his own name, the extent of his contributions to ornithology and entomology remained largely unrecognized until the latter half of the twentieth century. Although he may have viewed his work as mostly commercial, his data and illustrations were of considerable significance to a number of major scientific publications. He remains best-known for providing data and the 104 illustrations to the earliest extensive monograph devoted entirely to North American entomology, Sir James Edward Smith's <span class="italic">Natural History of the Rarer Lepidopterous Insects of Georgia</span> (1797). Abbot made an additional 103 drawings intended as a second volume; these were sent to Swainson but remained unpublished until after being rediscovered in the 1980s in New Zealand. Abbot's specimens from Georgia were used for illustrations in Thomas Martyn's <span class="italic">Psyche: Figures of Nondescript Lepidopterous Insects</span> (1797); in Jean A. Boisduval's and John L. Le Conte's <span class="italic">Histoire g&eacute;n&eacute;rale et iconographie des L&eacute;pidopt&egrave;res et des Chenilles de l'Am&eacute;rique septentrionale</span> (1829&#150;33); and in Charles A. Walckenaer's <span class="italic">Histoire naturelle des insectes: Apt&egrave;res</span> (1837, 1841). Some of Abbot's observations on wasps were used by Charles Darwin in his <span class="italic">Journal of Researches during the Voyage of HMS Beagle</span> (1845). Although Abbot's bird illustrations were not reproduced during his lifetime, he provided extensive data for John Latham's second supplement to his <span class="italic">General Synopsis of Birds</span> (1801), for Latham's multi-volume <span class="italic">General History of Birds</span> (1821&#150;8), and for Alexander Wilson's <span class="italic">American Ornithology</span> (1808&#150;14). Thousands of Abbot's original watercolour drawings of insects, spiders, and birds survived in public and private collections in the United States and in Britain.<br>
<br>In creating his illustrations, Abbot used graphite to sketch the outline of the subject on paper and then completed the drawing using watercolours. His entomological drawings demonstrate an extraordinary attention to detail, with individual scales and fine texture shown accurately. His style was heavily influenced by Eleazar Albin's <span class="italic">Natural History of English Insects</span> (1720, 1749), which portrayed the metamorphosis of Lepidoptera by showing a dominant food plant, with feeding larvae, pupae, and adult. Abbot's early use of this format suggests that he may have learned to rear Lepidoptera from larvae while he was still in London. In most of his drawings, Abbot arranged the insects in tabular and geometric patterns radiating around a central point, thus resembling specimens placed in collection boxes or drawers. His ornithological illustrations are remarkable for their detail of morphology and plumage, particularly in recognizing sexual and age differences. These drawings are in the old style, now known as &#145;stump and magpie&#146; or &#145;bonsai&#146;, in which the bird is perched on a small, stunted tree trunk, which is usually gnarled and twisted toward one side and adorned with generalized moss, lichens, or other embellishments. Abbot probably learned this style from his set of Edwards's <span class="italic">Natural History of Uncommon Birds</span>, from at least twenty plates of which he copied the outline figures, as the basis for more than sixty of his own drawings. Abbot also borrowed outlines and plates from Latham's <span class="italic">General Synopsis of Birds</span> (1781&#150;1801) and from Wilson's <span class="italic">American Ornithology</span> (1808&#150;14). He probably used a sketchbook or master set to produce many of his bird drawings, as there is extensive duplication of illustrations among his many surviving collections, which contain more than 1400 plates showing more than 210 species.<br>
<br>Correspondence indicates that Abbot was married and had a son, but no details have been confirmed, and both apparently died before Abbot. He is believed to have died in 1840, but the date is not definitively established. He was buried on the plantation of his friend William McElveen in Bulloch county, Georgia.<br>
