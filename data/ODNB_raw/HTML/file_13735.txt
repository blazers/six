<span class="headword">Hope, Sir  Thomas, of Kerse</span>  (1606&#150;1643), <span class="occ">politician and judge</span>, was born on 6 August 1606, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13736/', "Sir Thomas Hope")</script> of Craighall (1573&#150;1646), future lord advocate, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1660), daughter of John Bennett of Wallyford, Haddingtonshire. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13722/', "Sir James Hope of Hopetoun")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13728/', "Sir John Hope, Lord Craighall")</script>, were his brothers. He graduated from the University of Edinburgh in 1625 and was admitted advocate on 17 July 1631. He had received a grant of the lands and barony of Kerse in 1625 and was knighted, as Sir Thomas Hope &#145;of Wester Granton&#146;, by Charles I at Innerwick on 16 July 1633. He married Helen, third daughter and coheir of Adam Rae of Pitspindie.<br>
<br>Hope played an active part in public affairs, sitting in the Scottish parliament of 1639&#150;41 as commissioner for Clackmannanshire. In 1639, during the first bishops' war, he held joint command of General Leslie's lifeguard, raised by the college of justice, and in 1640&#150;41 commanded the general's lifeguard of horse, again raised from the college, and won praise for his conduct at Newburn. He was named to the 1640 committee of estates, and as collector-general of the tenth and twentieth pennies, raised in 1640&#150;41 to support the Scottish war effort. In September 1641 he proposed in parliament, as speaker for the barons or freeholders, that the estates should appoint officers of state and privy councillors by ballot, though the proposal was lost. He was prominent in opposing Charles's demand for a public inquiry into the &#145;incident&#146;, and was the author of the compromise effected between the king and the estates with reference to the appointment of Loudoun as chancellor. On 13 November 1641 the estates agreed his appointment as an ordinary lord of session, one of four chosen to replace royalist incumbents, and he was named lord justice-general by the king. At the same time he was chosen as one of the conservators of the peace, the body established under the treaty of London to liaise with the English parliament, and acted as a commissioner to treat with Westminster for the suppression of the Irish rising. He was a member for Stirlingshire in the convention of estates of 1643 and was chosen to negotiate with English parliamentary representatives, negotiations which would culminate in the solemn league and covenant. He was, however, replaced owing to ill health and died at Edinburgh on 23 August 1643. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Thomas, who was himself succeeded by his younger brother, Alexander, first baronet. Hope left two legal works in manuscript, the &#145;Law repertorie&#146; and a two-volume commentary on books 12&#150;24 of Justinian's <span class="italic">Digest</span>, held by the National Library of Scotland.<br>
