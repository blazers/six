<span class="headword">Stuart, Sir  James</span>, first baronet  (1780&#150;1853), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician in Canada</span>, was born on 2 March 1780 at Fort Hunter, New York, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59556/', "John Stuart (1741&#150;1811)")</script>, Church of England curate there, and his wife, Jane (1747&#150;1821), the daughter of George Okill of Philadelphia. The son of a loyalist, Stuart moved to Canada with his parents as an infant in 1781. A gifted lad, he later received a strong conservative education at King's College, Windsor, Nova Scotia. He was only fourteen when he entered the office of John Reid, the protonotary of the court of king's bench at Montreal, to study for the law; in 1798 he moved to Quebec and became a pupil of Jonathan Sewell, then attorney-general of Lower Canada. Two years later the lieutenant-governor, Sir Robert Shore Milnes, appointed Stuart his personal secretary. Stuart was called to the bar in 1801, and on 1 August 1805 was appointed by Milnes solicitor-general for the province, whereupon he returned to Montreal and quickly built a prosperous private practice.<br>
<br>In 1808 Stuart entered the house of assembly as a member for Montreal East. After a disagreement with the governor, Sir James Henry Craig, and having been passed over for the post of attorney-general, he joined the nationalist opposition Canadian party, which dominated the assembly. In 1809 he was dismissed by Craig from the solicitor-generalship. He then devoted himself to private practice and to politics. During the administration of Governor Sir George Prevost he constantly opposed the government and became leader of the Canadian party in the assembly. In 1813 he inspired a motion adopted by the assembly to inquire into the conduct of the chief justices Jonathan Sewell and James Monk. He renewed his attacks in 1814, leading to an attempt, ultimately unsuccessful, to impeach them. Stuart's relentless pursuit of this matter, as late as 1817, finally alienated even his best friends in the Canadian party. Frustrated and embittered, he withdrew from the assembly that year. On 14 March 1818 he married Elizabeth (1795&#150;1849), the daughter of Alexander Robertson of Montreal; they had at least three sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>In December 1822 Stuart was once more brought to the fore, this time at the head of the British party, by a movement for the union of Upper and Lower Canada. He drafted a petition from supporters in Montreal, and was sent to London by the unionists to advocate their cause. There in 1824 he published <span class="italic">Observations on the proposed union of the provinces of Upper and Lower Canada under one legislature</span>, as well as a critique of a federalist plan proposed by Sewell. He attracted the attention of the colonial secretary, Lord Bathurst, and on 31 January 1825 was appointed attorney-general for Lower Canada. That year he stood for election to the assembly as member for William Henry (Sorel), but only on the insistence of Governor Lord Dalhousie, who assigned him the unenviable task of defending the executive's policies there. After being elected he became the house's constant target of irony from the former allies of the <i>patriote</i> party, led by Louis-Joseph Papineau. For his service Stuart was appointed by Dalhousie to the executive council on 6 July 1827. Following the dissolution of parliament that year he lost to Dr Wolfred Nelson by two votes in new elections, which led to charges of abuse of power on his part, and eventually, in 1831, to a demand by the assembly for his impeachment; this resulted in March in his suspension by Governor Lord Aylmer from the office of attorney-general. Stuart sailed to England that year to defend himself. Lord Goderich, the colonial secretary, absolved Stuart on this and other charges levelled by the assembly, but, in a controversial decision, dismissed him in November 1832 on other grounds. Stuart persuaded Goderich's successor, Lord Stanley, that Goderich had been unfair, but failed to obtain a reversal, and, after bitterly declining the offer of the chief justiceship of Newfoundland, he returned to Canada in 1834 and resumed his practice at Quebec, with a success which was proof of general confidence.<br>
<br>In the political storm which led up to the rebellions of 1837&#150;8, Stuart took no part; but on 2 April 1838 Governor Sir John Colborne appointed him to the governor's special council. Its members, including Stuart, were all replaced two months later by Lord Durham, who, however, on 22 October 1838 appointed him chief justice of Lower Canada in succession to his former master and rival, Sewell, to compensate for his earlier dismissal as attorney-general. Stuart at once became active politically, encouraged by his reappointment in November 1839 to the special council, over which he presided until shortly before its dissolution in February 1841. He prepared the ordinance establishing register offices in Lower Canada, and was one of Governor Lord Sydenham's chief advisers in framing the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> of 1841. Subsequently he promoted the grant of corporations to Quebec and Montreal, and the institution of municipalities throughout the province. He was created a baronet on 5 May 1841.<br>
<br>On the union of the Canadas (10 February 1841), Stuart became chief justice of Canada, and for the rest of his career he devoted himself to his judicial duties. He was a talented, practical lawyer, knowledgeable in, but largely antipathetic towards, the colony's French civil law. In politics he was conservative and British-orientated but fundamentally self-serving and opportunistic, as demonstrated by his flirtation with the Canadian party. In personality he was ambitious, unlikeable, arrogant, sensitive, and often bitter and frustrated. He died at Quebec on 14 July 1853, and was buried at Holy Trinity Cathedral in the city on 16 July.<br>
