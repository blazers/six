<span class="headword">Frederica, Princess</span>  (1848&#150;1926), <span class="occ"></span> was born Frederica Sophia Marie Henrietta Amelia Theresa in Hanover on 9 January 1848, the eldest daughter of George, crown prince of Hanover&#151;from 1851 king of Hanover as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37449/', "George V")</script>&#151;and Princess Mary Alexandrina (Marie) (1818&#150;1907) of Saxe-Altenburg. Her great-grandfather in the male line was George III of Great Britain and Ireland, and she was thus a princess of Great Britain and Ireland as well as of Hanover. Passionate and outspoken, Lily, as she was known to her family, became her father's favourite child. She was educated at home together with her younger sister Mary (1849&#150;1904). Around her sixteenth birthday rumours about potential marriages to members of the protestant houses of Denmark or Prussia circulated in dynastic circles, but none materialized.<br>
<br>The war between Prussia and the majority of German sovereigns in June and July 1866 changed Frederica's life dramatically. After Prussia's victory the chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, and King Wilhelm I decided to annex the kingdom of Hanover to Prussia. While the deposed King George and Crown Prince Ernest Augustus left for Austria, Frederica, her mother, and her younger sister remained in Hanover for a further twelve months. During this period Frederica only saw her father during a brief visit to the residence of her grandfather, the duke of Saxe-Altenburg. Under increasing pressure from the Prussian authorities, the queen and the two princesses left the royal palace of Marienburg and the Hanoverian royal family was reunited in exile in Austria during the summer of 1867.<br>
<br>The experiences of defeat and exile shaped Frederica's political views and made her a strong opponent of Prussia with an extreme dislike for Bismarck. She supported her father in his campaign for the restoration of Hanover and shared his legalistic views about dynastic sovereignty. A potential political marriage with the Italian prince Umberto failed in 1867. In early 1868 George V purchased two family residences at Penzing near Vienna and Gmunden close to Lake Traunsee. Life in exile proved financially difficult as the largest part of the family's income and fortune had been sequestrated by the Prussian authorities in March 1868. From 1873 King George's assets on the British stock market provided Frederica with a regular income, the so-called princess's fund. However, the king's sudden death in June 1878 again threatened her financial and personal independence. Her brother Ernest Augustus succeeded as head of the family, and demanded that Frederica contribute to the family's expenses with a regular sum. He also pressed his sister to agree to a pension offered by the Prussian authorities, which she refused.<br>
<br>Frederica now turned to her relatives in Britain. She was particularly close to her aunt Augusta, duchess of Cambridge, but also corresponded with her father's cousin Queen Victoria. On Augusta's invitation she had visited Britain in 1876, and decided to stay when she returned there in 1878. In a letter to Ernest Augustus she asserted her independence and informed him that she had Victoria's support. In spite of the protests of her mother and brother, Frederica settled at Hampton Court, where she took up the Prussian pension. The conflict between Frederica and her family gained a further dimension when the princess wrote from Britain to her mother and brother that she was to marry Alfons von Pawel-Rammingen (1843&#150;1932), a former member of the Hanoverian royal household who was naturalized as a British subject, in March 1880. The conflict was resolved only through Queen Victoria's intervention.<br>
<br>Frederica married Pawel-Rammingen at a private chapel in Windsor Castle on 24 April 1880 and the couple moved into apartments at Hampton Court. She wrote annually to thank the queen for her help and protection regarding the marriage. Frederica gave birth to a daughter, Victoria Georgina Beatrice Maude Anne, in March 1881, but the child died three weeks after her birth. Frederica's life in Britain was subsequently characterized by her engagement in charity work in memory of her daughter, and in 1882 she founded a home for poor women recovering from childbirth at East Molesey, Surrey. She supported other institutions but repeatedly ran into debt over &#145;lush&#146; ideas and on several occasions appealed to Queen Victoria for financial assistance.<br>
<br>The loss of her daughter and the birth of Ernest Augustus's children following his marriage to Princess Thyra of Denmark helped Frederica overcome the conflict with her family. She and her brother regularly corresponded during the latter period of the princess's life. Frederica and Alfons moved to Biarritz in 1898, where she died at their home there, Villa Mouriscot, on 16 October 1926; she was survived by her husband. Her obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span> was entitled &#145;A link with the old royal family&#146; (18 October 1926), and a funeral was held at Biarritz on 21 October, followed by a funeral and committal service at St George's Chapel, Windsor, on 18 November. Her dynastic identity as a member of the house of Hanover, effectively expelled from the British royal family following the First World War, weakened her place in the popular memory of the Victorian royal family as much as had her move to France in 1898. But by settling at Hampton Court and participating in the charitable activities pursued by the British royal family in the late nineteenth century Frederica actively emphasized British royal identity at a time when the Hanoverian royal family was expected to maintain a distance from Queen Victoria and her descendants, and provided a reminder of the multi-national character of the British royal house throughout the nineteenth century.<br>
