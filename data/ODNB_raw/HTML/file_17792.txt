<span class="headword">Maguire,  John Francis</span>  (1815&#150;1872), <span class="occ">Irish newspaper proprietor and politician</span>, was the eldest son of John Maguire, a merchant of Cork, where he was born. He was called to the Irish bar in 1843, and the same year he married Margaret, the daughter of Robert Bailey of Cork. They had seven children and Margaret outlived him. He had already established the <span class="italic">Cork Examiner</span> in 1841, as an organ of O'Connellite nationalism. He unsuccessfully contested the small borough of Dungarvan as a repealer in 1847 and 1851 before winning it for the new Independent Irish Party built upon the Tenant League of 1850. He held the seat until 1865, after which he represented his native city until his death. Following the demise of his party, he sat as a Liberal from 1859. In its last years he did more than anyone to keep the Independent Irish Party in being, using its dwindling strength to bargain with the transient governments of the 1850s. These tactics elicited abortive land bills falling far short of the league's original demands, and minor concessions in the Catholic interest. Maguire embodied the strong Catholic element in O'Connellite nationalism, and was a prominent defender of the contemporary papacy and its threatened temporal power. Pope Pius IX, to whom he was known, rewarded him with the order of St Gregory for his book <span class="italic">Rome and its Ruler</span> (1856).<br>
<br>As a Liberal, Maguire continued to press for land reforms, and voiced the growing self-confidence of Irish Catholicism in its uneasy relationship with the protestant state. He joined other Irish Liberal MPs with an O'Connellite background in the National Association of Ireland, set up in 1864 and nicknamed &#145;Cullen's Association&#146; because of its domination by Paul Cullen (1803&#150;1878), the archbishop of Dublin. This initiative was designed to offer a moderate alternative to the attractions of Fenianism, which repudiated O'Connell's constitutional methods, and to exploit the changing attitude of British Liberals to the Irish problem in the 1860s. Maguire obtained in 1865 a select committee of inquiry into Irish land law for which he had first asked two years earlier. As its chairman, he was unable to secure agreement on even a modest diminution of landlord rights  (<span class="italic">Parl. papers</span>, 1865, 11.343) but the question was back on a Liberal government's agenda. His book <span class="italic">Ireland in America</span> (1868), the fruit of six months in the United States and Canada, influenced W. E. Gladstone by its argument that industry and order were the characteristics of an Irish population liberated from the accumulated injustices of centuries. Although Maguire gave priority to the land question, he played a full part in agitating for disestablishment of the Anglican church in Ireland. His Commons motion on the state of Ireland in March 1868 provided the occasion for Gladstone's declaration against the church. While his newspaper carried less weight than the Dublin <span class="italic">Freeman's Journal</span> of another old O'Connellite, Sir John Gray (1816&#150;1875), Maguire was closer than Gray to Gladstone  (Lord Derby, <span class="italic">A Selection from the Diaries &hellip; 1869&#150;1878</span>, ed. J. R. Vincent, 1994, 81&#150;2), who listed him as one of the three Irish Catholic Liberals he trusted to convey the reactions of their countrymen to his reforms.<br>
<br>In his correspondence with Gladstone, Maguire depicted himself as a spokesman not for &#145;Fenians &hellip; [but for] honest and logical nationalists&#146;, as he said when insisting that only &#145;irremovability&#146;, the real meaning of tenant-right, would still endemic agrarian unrest and demonstrate that &#145;national improvement and redemption&#146; were possible under the union  (Maguire to Gladstone, 7 Oct 1869, BL, Add. MS 44422). Gladstone could not go so far in his <span class="roman">Land Bill</span> of 1870, and Maguire's nationalist logic pointed to home rule. He enrolled in the Home Government Association of Isaac Butt in August 1871, and canvassed for the home-rule candidate at the Mallow by-election a year later, shortly before his death. Those actions signalled the end of the attempt to reconcile O'Connellite nationalism with British Liberalism. For most of his career, Maguire's well-defined loyalties had never been exclusive. One of Lord Palmerston's cabinet ministers observed that an article in the <span class="italic">Cork Examiner</span>, arguing against rebellion in support of a rumoured French invasion, was worth any number of prosecutions for sedition  (Lewis to Palmerston, 6 Oct 1860; U. Southampton L., Broadlands MS GC/LE/135). The queen and other political opponents contributed to the national subscription for Maguire's wife and children, left in straitened circumstances.<br>
<br>Maguire was prominent in the civic life of Cork: serving as mayor in 1853 and again in 1862&#150;4, he used his parliamentary influence to promote the construction of a naval harbour in the port and tried to introduce the linen industry into the south of Ireland. The setback to the post-famine recovery of the Irish economy from a run of poor seasons in the early 1860s led him to solicit some special help for his country from government, with limited success. He was, however, instrumental in securing a mitigation of the Irish poor law that cut to six months the qualifying period of settlement required of applicants for relief. Amid all this activity he found time to make a name for himself as a man of letters. In addition to the two important books previously mentioned, of which <span class="italic">Rome and its Ruler</span> went to a third and enlarged edition (1870), he wrote: <span class="italic">The Industrial Movement in Ireland</span> (1852); a biography of the &#145;apostle for temperance&#146; entitled <span class="italic">Father Mathew: a Biography</span> (1863); a three-volume novel, <span class="italic">The Next Generation</span> (1871); and the posthumously published <span class="italic">Young Prince Marigold and Other Fairy Stories</span> (1873). It was the varied output of a professional writer with, perhaps, more industry than talent.<br>
<br>Contemporaries remembered Maguire as the founder of the <span class="italic">Cork Examiner</span>, the leading nationalist paper outside Dublin; as an effective publicist for his church; and, not always gratefully, as the archetype of those who endeavoured to be true to O'Connell's memory in Irish politics through the discouraging period that followed the famine and the collapse of repeal and Young Ireland. In the later twentieth century, historians reassessed the Independent Irish Party and the National Association of Ireland and, at least implicitly, conceded their legitimacy in the context of the continuing national struggle: Maguire's reputation benefited as a result. He died in Dublin on 1 November 1872 and was buried in St Joseph's cemetery, Cork.<br>
