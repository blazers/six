<span class="headword">Weyland,  John</span>  (1774&#150;1854), <span class="occ">writer on the poor laws</span>, was born in Westminster on 4 December 1774, the eldest of three sons and six daughters of John Weyland (1744&#150;1825), of Woodrising, Norfolk, and Wood Eaton, Oxfordshire, and his wife, Elizabeth Joanna (<i>d</i>. 1822), daughter and coheir of John Nourse of Wood Eaton. The family had made money in the City of London and acquired country estates; his father, &#145;a noted farmer&#146;, was high sheriff of Oxfordshire in 1777  (<span class="italic">VCH Oxfordshire</span>, 5.312). Weyland matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, as a commoner in 1792, but migrated in 1794 to St Mary Hall (a move usually suggestive of some delinquency). He left the university, of which he later called himself &#145;an unworthy member&#146;  (<span class="italic">Principles of Population</span>, 1816, vi), without a degree, but was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1800. On 12 March 1799 he married Elizabeth, daughter and heiress of Whitstead Keene MP, of Richmond.<br>
<br>Weyland was a justice of the peace for the counties of Oxfordshire, Berkshire, Surrey, and Norfolk, served as an ordinary member of the board of agriculture, and was elected FRS. In 1811, dissatisfied that the two leading periodical reviews, the <span class="italic">Edinburgh</span> and the <span class="italic">Quarterly</span>, lacked a definite religious tone, he founded the <span class="italic">British Review</span> and appointed William Roberts, an evangelical barrister, as its editor. The journal, which took an evangelical, tory line, reviewed secular works &#145;in a Christian spirit&#146;, as Hannah More approvingly noted  (Roberts, 65n), until its demise in 1822. In 1813 he urged the court of proprietors of the East India Company to endow an ecclesiastical establishment in India and to sanction missionary endeavour  (<span class="italic">Letter to Sir Hugh Inglis Bart on the State of Religion in India</span>, 1813).<br>
<br>Weyland is now remembered as a critic of Malthusian population theory. He was concerned to uphold the existing social order in the countryside, and was an outspoken defender of the existing system of poor relief, for example in his <span class="italic">A Short Enquiry into the Policy, Humanity and Effect of the Poor Laws</span> (1807). His major work, <span class="italic">The principles of population and production, as they are affected by the progress of society; with a view to moral and political consequences</span> (1816; repr., 1994), attacked Malthus's argument on empirical grounds, disputing the belief that the population in England was outstripping the resources for subsistence, and reaffirming the benignity of the providential design. Weyland's principal object was to show that the poor laws were both beneficent and necessary, and were not a cause of pauperism, which he attributed to a lack of moral and religious instruction among the poor. Although his assertion that the population had reached a state of &#145;non-reproduction&#146; was demonstrably absurd (despite the lack of issue from his own marriage), his advocacy of poor relief for large families where the wage-earner could not provide for all his children interested promoters of family allowances a century later. Malthus responded to Weyland in the fifth edition (1817) of his <span class="italic">Essay on Population</span>.<br>
<br>On 31 July 1830 Weyland was elected MP for the borough of Hindon, Wiltshire, whose scale of parochial relief for wage-earners had been held up for criticism by R. A. Slaney's 1828 parliamentary select committee on the poor laws. He continued his defence of the poor laws in parliament. He voted for the second reading of the parliamentary <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> (22 March 1831), which brought about the disfranchisement of Hindon, and the loss of his own seat, in December 1832. On the death of their father, Weyland's younger brother Richard Weyland (1780&#150;1864) succeeded to the Wood Eaton estate, while John Weyland inherited Woodrising Hall, in Norfolk, where he died on 8 May 1854.<br>
