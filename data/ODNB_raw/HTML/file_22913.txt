<span class="headword">Puttenham,  George</span>  (1529&#150;1590/91), <span class="occ">writer and literary critic</span>, was the second son of Robert Puttenham of Sherfield upon Lodon, Hampshire, and his wife, Margery, daughter of Sir Richard Elyot and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8782/', "Sir Thomas Elyot")</script>. He matriculated from Christ's College, Cambridge, in November 1546, aged seventeen, but took no degree. He was admitted to the Middle Temple on 11 August 1556. In late 1559 or early 1560 Puttenham married Elizabeth, Lady Windsor (1520&#150;1588/9). She was the daughter and coheir of Peter Cowdray of Herriard, Hampshire, and widow of Richard Paulet (will proved on 6 February 1552) and William, second Baron Windsor (<i>d</i>. 20 Aug 1558). Most of what is known about Puttenham's subsequent career derives from court records centring on the dissolution of his marriage with Lady Windsor and his efforts to wrest ownership of Sherfield from Francis Morris and his wife, Anne, the daughter of George's elder brother, <a href="#cosubject_22914">Richard Puttenham [<i>see below</i>]</a>.<h2>
<a name="Earlylegalwranglings"></a>Early legal wranglings</h2>Puttenham deposed in 1578 that he made his first trip abroad about 1562&#150;3 to purchase Sherfield from Richard, who had fled to the continent in 1560. George certainly resided at the manor house during the autumn of 1562 when he charged Lady Windsor's brother-in-law Thomas Paulet with inciting others to steal a goshawk from his mew at Sherfield. Paulet admitted that he confronted Puttenham at his home, wounded him in the head with his dagger, and &#145;then agayne with the blade of the said dagger gave unto the said complainant one other little Stroke&#146;  (TNA: PRO, STAC 5, P66/2). Puttenham continued to occupy Sherfield until 1567, when his brother returned secretly to England and gave the property to Anne and Francis Morris. Thereafter, Morris seized the house from Puttenham by force, initiating the quarrel with George that lasted nearly a decade.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, one Richard Hartilpoole had secured a ruling against Puttenham in the court of requests on charges that Puttenham withheld bedding and other furnishings that Hartilpoole had conveyed to Puttenham's house in Trinity Lane, London, in autumn 1565. Puttenham ignored this judgment, and on 24 July 1569, the court ordered the sheriffs of London and Middlesex to arrest Puttenham on sight &#145;to Aunswere not only unto his said contemptes&#146; against Hartilpoole but for other crimes as well  (TNA: PRO, REQ 2 219/25). At about the time of Hartilpoole's suit, John Bardolph, parson of Shalden, just 3 miles south and east of Herriard, sued Puttenham, Richard Aprice, clerk, John Marriner, and others in Star Chamber. Bardolph charged that he was assaulted in the church and again in his parsonage in July and August of 1566 at Puttenham's instigation. In July 1565 Puttenham had obtained a lease to the parsonage from the former parson, Giles More. But More was then deprived of the living on a charge of non-residence, after which Bardolph apparently occupied the parsonage despite Puttenham's claim to it. No outcome to this case is recorded, but in conjunction with the Hartilpoole business it probably influenced Richard Horne, bishop of Winchester, to react with alarm early in 1569 on learning that Puttenham was to be appointed a justice of the peace. Horne wrote to Secretary Cecil praying &#145;that it be not true for his evil life is well known, and also that he is a &#147;notorious enemye to God's Truthe&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 1.392&#150;3, Horne to Cecil, 21 Jan 1569).<br>
<br>By June 1570 Puttenham was lodged in the Fleet prison, apparently in response to one Julio Mantuano's deposition of 7 April that Puttenham had both slandered the queen and incited him to murder the bishop of London. The divorce records mention that George &#145;was comytted to the Flete uppon matter of highe Treason&#146;  (Hants. RO, 44M69/F2/14/1). He was released from prison on 15 June on &pound;200 bail and under guard to attend to his other legal problems at the Winchester assizes. Thereafter he must have thoroughly exonerated himself from Mantuano's charges, for he not only regained his freedom but in 1574 won a court judgment of &pound;20 against Brian Annesley, warden of the Fleet, the sum Annesley had failed to disburse in payment of Puttenham's debts during his imprisonment.<br>
<br>Neither the court cases nor this imprisonment caused Puttenham lasting inconvenience. Early in 1571 he resumed his efforts to regain control of the family home. In April, Puttenham's men seized the mill at Sherfield which Morris reclaimed by force. Puttenham was by this time residing in Sherfield at the house of a Margaret Marriner, probably the widow or mother of the John Marriner who had joined Puttenham in the assault on Parson Bardolph. For her pains, Margaret claimed that Morris's men evicted her and pulled down the house, which she and Puttenham rebuilt only to have Morris and his cronies pull it down again.<h2>
<a name="Domesticdisputes"></a>Domestic disputes</h2>Meanwhile, Puttenham's conflict with his wife served to widen his circle of opponents. According to Lady Windsor's son John Paulet, his mother had sued Puttenham for divorce within five or six years of the marriage; she may have separated from him as early as 1566. George was bound to provide &pound;100 annually to support his estranged wife but his failure to make the required quarterly instalments after 1572 led to his confinement in the Wood Street compter in the autumn of 1575 when the court of arches ordered him to begin paying Lady Windsor &pound;3 weekly. By this time the privy council was involved on Lady Windsor's behalf. The council ordered George to resume the payments in so far as all of his income derived from resources she had brought to the marriage. On 24 June 1576 the privy council accused him of unlawfully conveying the manor of Herriard to his brother-in-law Sir John Throckmorton. In July, Puttenham was served with a writ of <i>excommunicatio capiendo</i>, formally excommunicating him from the Anglican church for non-payment of his wife's alimony.<br>
<br>On 9 June 1578 the sentence of divorce became final, whereon Lady Windsor resumed her appeals for redress to the council which issued an order for George's arrest on 23 June. As late as October, however, Puttenham wrote to the council that he would not appear before them for fear of his wife's children, and he accused Thomas Paulet and Katherine Paulet of twice assaulting him. On 26 October the council issued letters of protection for George's appearance before them and they ordered Throckmorton to ensure that Puttenham did not manage his affairs to the detriment of Lady Windsor's interests. On 20 December George was arrested &#145;with some difficulty&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 2.222), sent to the court the next day to answer to the privy council, but was released by mistake from the Gatehouse at Westminster on 23 December.<br>
<br>The Paulets had, in fact, taken matters into their own hands for on 3 February 1578 John Paulet's son Richard, with his mother, Katherine, and other members of the family confronted Puttenham at his lodgings in the Whitefriars, London, in search of legal documents. According to George's suit in Star Chamber, the Paulets broke open the doors to his rooms, allowing one John Hall to serve him with another writ of excommunication. They then carried &#145;away the said Puttenham by force without any cappe, hatt or carchiffe bare heded&#146; to a prison in Middlesex, after rifling his chests and desks where bonds and indentures to the value of &pound;11,000 or &pound;12,000 were allegedly deposited  (TNA: PRO, STAC 5 P9/4, P3/3). Whether or not the privy council succeeded in returning Puttenham to prison, he had by 13 July 1579 agreed to provide his former wife with six servants, four suits, a coach, and &pound;20 yearly. By November, however, he had again defaulted and the council was pressuring Throckmorton to make George comply with the terms of the settlement.<br>
<br>Puttenham's contention with Lady Windsor plagued him for the next eight years. His conflict with Francis Morris over Sherfield ended in 1581 when Morris was arrested for harbouring the Jesuit Edmund Campion. Francis died in prison in 1584, but Puttenham did not gain title to the property. In the same year, Lady Windsor sued George again in the court of arches, an action that earned him another confinement in the Wood Street compter. He was served with a third writ of excommunication in November 1586, and was once more imprisoned for failing to honour the court's decree in favour of Lady Windsor. A fourth writ was sworn out in November 1588, followed by yet another imprisonment, but this is the final episode in his dispute with his former wife. Puttenham's 1589 bill associated with these matters refers to Lady Windsor as &#145;deceased&#146;  (TNA: PRO, STAC 5 P33/22).<h2>
<a name="Literaryworks"></a>Literary works</h2>George Puttenham the fugitive excommunicant is not easily reconciled with Puttenham the author, whose writings in prose and verse secure his place in English literary history. His rhetorical skills were attested by witnesses for Morris in 1571 who deposed that George was &#145;full of brables of subtyll practyses and slanderous devyses &hellip; overconnynge in defacinge of truthe by wordes &amp; speache eloquente and in invencon of myscheiffe verie perfytte&#146;  (TNA: PRO, STAC 5 P5/10). A single autograph leaf of his translation of Suetonius's <span class="italic">Lives of the Caesars</span> (&#145;<i>in vita Tiberii</i>&#146;, chaps. 58&#150;61, TNA: PRO, SP 12/126/67) bears faint witness to his literary interests. More persuasive is the autograph &#145;inventory of all my bookes and library&#146; for 10 November 1576  (Hants. RO, 44M69/E19/4, fol. 16<i>v</i>). This list of more than ninety titles is weighted toward law, rhetoric (including Aristotle, Erasmus, and Ramus), French history, and politics (from Aristotle to Machiavelli). The Latin poets are well represented (among them Ovid, Catullus, Juvenal, Tibullus, and Horace), along with a few vernacular authors, notably Pierre Ronsard, Luigi Alemanni, and two copies of Jacopo Sannazarro's <span class="italic">Arcadia</span>. What Puttenham's catalogue omits is any reference to English poetry such as Richard Tottel's <span class="italic">Songs and Sonnets</span> or the works of George Gascoigne and George Turberville, all drawn on heavily in the <span class="italic">Arte</span>, and all in print by 1576. Puttenham's inventory does, however, reinforce his claim to &#145;A justificacion of Queene Elizabeth in relacion to the affaire of Mary queene of Scottes&#146;. This prose defence of Mary's execution presents sophisticated legal and political arguments in support of the government's decision to condemn Mary to death. The tract, edited for the Camden Society in 1867, is assigned to Puttenham in two contemporary manuscripts (BL, Add. MS 48027, Harley 831), and there are no conflicting attributions. To reward Puttenham for this work, which circulated widely in manuscript, Thomas Windebank, Lord Burghley's prot&eacute;g&eacute; and a clerk of the signet, secured the queen's signature to a gift of two leases in reversion for Puttenham in May 1588.<br>
<br>On 9 November 1588 <span class="italic">The Arte of English Poesie</span> was entered in the Stationers' register for the first time. It was published anonymously in 1589 with a dedication to Burghley subscribed &#145;R. F.&#146; by the printer, Richard Field. Although <span class="italic">The Arte</span> has been claimed for both Richard Puttenham and John, Baron Lumley, the case for George Puttenham's authorship of this important work of literary criticism is strong if not indisputable. About 1590 John Harington requested that Field set forth portions of Harington's translation of Ariosto &#145;in the same printe that Putnams book ys&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 18920, fol. 336). In his &#145;Hypercritica&#146; (1610), Edmund Bolton cited the rumour that one Puttenham, gentleman pensioner to Queen Elizabeth, wrote <span class="italic">The Arte</span>. Neither George nor Richard served as pensioners or in any other capacity under Elizabeth, yet clearly someone named Puttenham wrote <span class="italic">The Arte</span>. Its author claimed to have written at the age of eighteen the lost <span class="italic">Elpine</span>, dedicated to Edward VI. Richard Puttenham was eighteen in 1538, but George turned eighteen about 1547 just as Edward came to the throne. Moreover, the praise of Sir John Throckmorton in <span class="italic">The Arte</span>, including a verse elegy in his honour, also points to George rather than Richard. Throckmorton was very much involved with George's affairs, especially during the 1570s, but there is no record of Richard's connection with him. Other aspects of <span class="italic">The Arte</span>, such as its author's claim to have studied at Oxford and to have been brought up in foreign courts, fit neither of the Puttenhams. On balance, however, George Puttenham's claim trumps that of any other candidate.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Arte</span> is an ambitious work of literary history and criticism as well as a rhetorical handbook for the practising poet; Ben Jonson carefully annotated his copy of the book. Yet no second edition appeared, perhaps because <span class="italic">The Arte</span> was somewhat out of fashion by 1589, drawing most of its examples from early to mid-sixteenth-century writers. In his &#145;Brief apology for poetrie&#146; prefixed to his translation of <span class="italic">Orlando Furioso</span> (1591), Harington asserted that poetry was a divine gift rather than an art to be learned, and he ridiculed Puttenham's own poetic talent.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">The Arte</span> Puttenham refers to at least eleven of his works in prose and verse, only one of which can now be identified. More than a dozen verse quotations in <span class="italic">The Arte</span> can be traced to his &#145;Partheniades&#146;, a collection of seventeen poems dedicated to Queen Elizabeth which exists in a single manuscript text, BL, Cotton Vesp. MS E.8, fols. 169&#150;78. While some or all of the &#145;Partheniades&#146; were supposedly written as a new year's gift for the queen, about 1579&#150;81, the work's absence among the Royal manuscripts in the British Library argues that it was either not delivered or not accepted, for that collection preserves new year's gifts addressed to the queen by such poets as George Gascoigne and Thomas Churchyard. In addition, Puttenham mentions in <span class="italic">The Arte</span> his interludes &#145;Lustie London&#146; and &#145;The Woer&#146;, his comedy &#145;Ginecocratia&#146;, a verse romance entitled the &#145;Isle of Great Britain&#146;, and the prose tracts &#145;De decoro&#146;, &#145;Ierotekni&#146;, and &#145;Originals and pedigree of the English tongue&#146;. In September 1590 Puttenham made out his will leaving all his goods (unspecified) to widow Mary Symmes, his servant. He was buried at St Bride's, Fleet Street, London, on 6 January 1591.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_22914"></a><span class="headword">Richard Puttenham</span>  (<em>b. </em>1520, <em>d.</em> in or after 1597)<span class="occ"></span> neither attended university nor can be certainly connected with any work of a literary nature. He inherited the property of his uncle Sir Thomas Elyot in 1546, while his father conveyed Sherfield upon Lodon to him in 1550. He married Mary, daughter of Sir William Warham and his wife, Elizabeth; Lady Warham lived in Sherfield during her widowhood and is mentioned several times in George's lawsuits. Richard was convicted of rape in April 1561, a crime that had probably motivated his flight to the continent the year before. He may have returned to England on occasions other than that of 1567, but he was certainly abroad in 1572&#150;3. He apparently was back in England towards the end of 1578 and in February 1579 petitioned to receive certain payments that Francis Morris was making annually to the exchequer in connection with his tenure of Sherfield.<br>
<br>Richard enjoyed little more matrimonial success than his brother George. He termed Mary a &#145;clamorous strumpet&#146; who demanded exorbitant maintenance from him although she had brought nothing to their marriage  (Stretton, 191&#150;2, 220). He had been imprisoned for debt in the king's bench for four years by May 1587 when he petitioned the masters of requests to reduce the &pound;20 to &pound;30 he had paid his wife annually for more than twenty years. Richard is almost certainly not the Richard Puttenham of Amersham, Buckinghamshire, yeoman of the queen's guard, who was buried at St Clement Danes on 2 July 1601, leaving a widow, Mary. George's brother was more likely the Richard Puttenham, prisoner in the king's bench, who signed his will on 22 April 1597. In it he designated as his executor and sole heir &#145;my verilie reported and reputed daughter Katherin Puttinham&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/89/39). Richard's uncertainty about his relationship to Katherine suggests that she is his illegitimate daughter, perhaps an outcome of the rape of 1560.<br>
