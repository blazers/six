<span class="headword">Balcanquhall,  Walter</span>  (<em>c.</em>1586&#150;1645), <span class="occ">dean of Rochester</span>, was born in Edinburgh, one of three sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1150/', "Walter Balcanquhall (1548/9&#150;1616)")</script>, Church of Scotland minister, and his wife, Margaret Marjoribanks. He was educated at Edinburgh University, graduating MA on 27 July 1609. Admitted to Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1610, he became a fellow the following year and proceeded BD in 1616. Now a convinced episcopalian, he was instituted to a series of livings, becoming vicar of Harston in 1615 and of Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, in 1617. He was appointed a chaplain to the king, and on 16 December 1617 was made master of the Savoy Hospital in the Strand, but early the following year he gave up this post (becoming instead a clerk of the closet) in order to represent the Church of Scotland at the Synod of Dort. In his lively letters home, preserved in the <span class="italic">Golden Remains</span> of John Hales, Balcanquhall endorsed the synod's condemnation of the remonstrants, but distanced himself from militant counter-remonstrants like Gomarus and their doctrines of supralapsarianism and limited atonement.<br>
<br>In 1621 Balcanquhall was restored as master of the Savoy and proceeded DD. He married at Bishopsbourne on 21 September 1624 Elizabeth, daughter of Anthony Aucher and widow of Sir William Hamilton. In March 1625 he became dean of Rochester and the same year vicar of Goudhurst, Kent. He acted as one of George Heriot's executors, compiling the statutes for Heriot's Hospital in Edinburgh in 1627. Having become rector of Kingstone, Kent, in 1632 he also acquired a living at Adisham, &#145;the house whairof&#146; according to the marquess of Hamilton, &#145;hee built himselfe from the ground, and wch he hath made the best parsonage house in Kent&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters &hellip; Baillie</span>, 1.478). In <span class="italic">The Honour of Christian Churches</span> (1633), a sermon preached before Charles I, he denounced puritans &#145;who think that all religion consisteth in preaching and hearing of sermons&#146;, and defended the Laudian beautification of English churches and worship.<br>
<br>Balcanquhall's sympathy for the Laudian agenda won him a key role as an intelligence gatherer for the king during the Scottish crisis of the late 1630s. He used his Scottish connections to acquire information about the activities of the covenanters from informants (or &#145;busie fleas&#146;, as Baillie called them) such as William Wilkie, regent at Glasgow University. The marquess of Hamilton told Laud that<blockquote>his Matie hath no chaplain can doe him lyke service, especially in the point of intelligence; for he hath gotten a great hand with that part of the Covenanting clergie, whom he hath made resent the tyrannie of some of the rest of the ministrie, and especially of the laitie and lay elders, even to a verie high discontentment, I hope ere long to an open breach; by these men he cometh to knowe all the secrets of that partie, wch is of singular wse to his Maties service and me. (<span class="italic">Letters &hellip; Baillie</span>, 1.478&#150;9)</blockquote>Balcanquhall advised the king on the perils and advantages of allowing the covenanters to hold a general assembly, and he was an observer at the Glasgow assembly in November and December 1638, speaking in defence of the bishops. He was commissioned by the king to write a historical narrative of the Scottish crisis. <span class="italic">A Large Declaration</span> was published in 1639 under the king's name, though Baillie believed it was written &#145;at Canterburie's direction&#146; and penned by Balcanquhall with help from the bishop of Ross and the archbishop of St Andrews. Baillie confessed that &#145;this booke put us to the extreame lyne of desperation&#146; since it showed that Charles had no regard for the covenanters' grievances  (<span class="italic">Letters &hellip; Baillie</span>, 1.208&#150;9). Baillie confessed,<blockquote>We have been much mistaken with that man: we esteemed him ever a Dordracenist, and opposed to Canterburie in that cause; bot now we see he hes made the king in his Manifesto print as much for Arminians as the heart of Canterburie could wish. (<span class="italic">Letters &hellip; Baillie</span>, 1.140)</blockquote>In recognition of his services to the monarch Balcanquhall was appointed dean of Durham, and installed on 14 May 1639. In 1640 he became vicar of Boxley, Kent. The covenanters denounced him in <span class="italic">Ane Information</span>, and at the end of the year Baillie reported from London that many Englishmen thought Balcanquhall &#145;a vile man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters &hellip; Baillie</span>, 1.286). In 1641 the Scottish parliament condemned him as an incendiary. Soon after the civil war began he was deprived of his mastership of the Savoy by the English parliamentarians; by 1644 he had been sequestered and had fled to Oxford. According to Anthony Wood, he &#145;did afterwards shift from place to place for security. At length flying for the safety of his life to Chirk Castle in Denbighshire&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 1.384), where he died during a cold winter on Christmas day 1645. He was buried in the parish church at Chirk, and some years later a monument was erected there in his honour by Sir Thomas Middleton of Chirk Castle. His widow, Elizabeth, had by 1650 become Lady Hammond.<br>
