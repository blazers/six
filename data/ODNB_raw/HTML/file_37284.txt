<span class="headword">Churchward,  George Jackson</span>  (1857&#150;1933), <span class="occ">railway engineer</span>, was born at Rowes Farm, Stoke Gabriel, south Devon, on 31 January 1857, the second son in the family of three sons and two daughters of George Churchward, a farmer, and his wife, Adelina Mary Churchward, who was his cousin. He was educated at Totnes grammar school. The Churchward family had been squires of Stoke Gabriel from the end of the fifteenth century. George had a keen mathematical flair, and in 1873 became a pupil of John Wright, the locomotive, carriage, and wagon superintendent of the South Devon Railway. Churchward completed his pupillage at Swindon under Joseph Armstrong, the locomotive superintendent of the Great Western Railway.<br>
<br>From 1877 to 1880 Churchward gained experience in the locomotive, carriage, and wagon drawing-offices at Swindon, and from then until 1882 worked with Armstrong's son on the development of an improved automatic braking system which overcame the defects of previous systems which had been the cause of serious railway accidents. In 1882 he became assistant carriage-works manager at Swindon and in 1885 manager. He was involved in the design of the first British train with vestibuled corridor connections between carriages and other improved rolling-stock, as well as the conversion of large numbers of passenger carriages from the broad gauge of 7 feet originated by Isambard Kingdom Brunel to the standard gauge of 4 feet 8&frac12; inches, following conversion of the London to Penzance main line in 1892. He also designed new and much improved axle bearings, which largely eliminated the overheating which had caused serious traffic delays.<br>
<br>Having clearly demonstrated his abilities Churchward was appointed locomotive works manager at Swindon in 1895, and two years later this job was combined with the position of chief assistant locomotive superintendent, with the intention that he should succeed William Dean, whose health was failing. Although not officially appointed locomotive superintendent until 1902, Churchward was effectively in control of the locomotive, carriage, and wagon departments from 1899 and so continued until his retirement at the end of 1921, with the new title of chief mechanical engineer from 1916. He was responsible for over 3000 locomotives, some 9000 carriages, and 80,000 wagons, in addition to a total staff of some 27,000, of whom 12,000 were at Swindon.<br>
<br>Churchward was determined to provide Swindon works with the best and most modern plant and machinery possible, the works having been founded in 1842 by Brunel and Daniel Gooch. When he took over control, machine tools were steam-driven by shafts and belting, which he replaced quickly by electric power from gas-engine-driven generators. He created a large new workshop complex within a single building of 1&frac12; acres, where boilers and other locomotive components were made and erected. By 1912 Swindon was the most modern locomotive works in the country.<br>
<br>Perhaps Churchward's greatest technical achievement was the introduction from 1903 to 1911 of a series of nine standard locomotive types, of which over 1100 were built by 1921. Of advanced design, these were based on detailed studies of the latest practice in Europe and America. Carefully tested prototypes were built and evaluated before quantity production commenced. Churchward purchased three French locomotives of a double expansion type, which had an outstanding reputation, for comparative tests against his own latest locomotives, which proved equally powerful and economical. Nevertheless, he adopted several design features from the French machines. His locomotive designs included the first British heavy freight 2&#150;8&#150;0 type in 1903, the Pacific 4&#150;6&#150;2 express type in 1908, and the first general purpose 2&#150;6&#150;0 type in 1911. Maximum standardization of components was achieved in Churchward's locomotives, the advanced design features of which were later adopted by other railways. He realized the need for a static locomotive-testing plant where detailed scientific investigations could be made. The first British plant was built to his designs in 1904. He was, with George Hughes of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, a British pioneer in the application of locomotive superheating, increasing power and efficiency.<br>
<br>Churchward was a fine figure of a man and his even temperament and dignified bearing suggested the country squire, an impression heightened by his liking for tweed suits. He was a tactful administrator and leader of men. His depth of vision, grasp of essentials, logical thinking, and the intuition by which he seemed to sense what was in the minds of those about him always ensured the best results. He gathered about him a technical staff of diverse talents, whom he inspired with an enthusiasm to give of their best.<br>
<br>During the First World War the Swindon works was devoted largely to the production of munitions under Churchward's direction. He was appointed CBE in 1918. He was an active member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, the Institution of Civil Engineers, and the Association of Railway Locomotive Engineers, of which he was president in 1917. He was also active in the civic life of Swindon, then very much a &#145;railway town&#146;. With the incorporation of the town in 1900 he was elected to the council, and became its first mayor.<br>
<br>Churchward was unmarried. He was killed by a train on 19 December 1933, when crossing the railway between his home and the Swindon works in foggy weather. He was buried at Swindon parish church on 23 December.<br>
