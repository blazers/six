<span class="headword">Knight,  Bert Cyril James Gabriel</span>  (1904&#150;1981), <span class="occ">microbiologist</span>, was born on 4 February 1904 at Glebe Cottage, Chart Lane, Reigate, Surrey, the son of Cyril Fennel Knight (1877&#150;1944), furniture merchant, and his wife, Kate Gabriel (1872/3&#150;1954). Educated at Reigate grammar school and University College, London, he took a BSc (1925) and MSc (1927) in chemistry. Originally biased towards physical chemistry he was appointed a demonstrator in University College's biochemistry department, where he first became interested in microbes. In 1929, the year in which, on 17 August, he married Doris Kemp, he joined the bacteriology team working under Paul Fildes at the London Hospital, moving with them in 1934 to the Middlesex Hospital.<br>
<br>Realizing that little could be learned about the biochemistry of microbes when they were grown in the ill-defined broths then customary, Knight set about devising culture media containing only known chemicals. He showed that some bacteria would multiply in such media only if trace amounts of vitamins or amino acids were made available. In a 1936 review of the topic he proposed that all bacteria need such essential metabolites, but that some had lost the ability to manufacture their own supplies. This concept underpinned much of later chemical microbiology, for example, the microbiological assay of such metabolites, the elucidation of their pathways of biosynthesis, and the design of anti-bacterial drugs which act by interfering with their metabolism. Knight became an international authority on bacterial nutrition, research for which he received the degree of DSc (London) in 1938.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Knight worked at the Lister Institute and the Wellcome laboratories principally on the chemical nature and action of toxins formed by Clostridia, specialized bacteria which often infect war wounds. He also became interested in a then neglected group of tiny bacteria known as Mycoplasmas (later Mollicutes), which cause diseases in plants and cattle. In 1944 Knight and Kemp divorced and on 27 December in that year he married <a href="#cosubject_64013">Frideswide Stewart [<i>see below</i>]</a>, a political activist and writer. They had three sons (one died in infancy) and two daughters.<br>
<br>By the end of the war Knight was very conscious that, though microbiology was a distinctive discipline, no learned society nor any educational centre dedicated to it existed. He joined several like-minded biologists to found the Society for General Microbiology in 1945, served on its original committee, and, when post-war paper shortages eased, became the first and longest-serving editor of its <span class="italic">Journal of General Microbiology</span>. As editor he revealed a deep concern for clarity of language and brevity of expression, and the <span class="italic">Journal</span> rapidly gained an international reputation for carefully written papers of the highest scientific quality. Much laborious editing, not always welcomed by authors, was required to sustain that quality, but the society, and the international reputation of British microbiology, benefited enormously. In 1951 Knight became professor in charge of Britain's first ever department of microbiology, at the University of Reading. There he remained until his retirement in 1969, teaching, building up his department, and developing his research on Mollicutes.<br>
<br>Knight loved France and French literature. He visited France often and, initially pseudonymously as Jonathan Kemp, published translations of French classics; he was a noted authority on the works of Stendhal. He was a left-wing socialist; brought up to the Church of England he abandoned Christianity about 1931 in favour of Marxism. He was a man of imposing appearance, often gruff and forthright in manner, and intolerant of affectation and humbug. Yet he was humorous, kind, and at times unexpectedly diffident. He inspired great affection among his friends and colleagues. On retirement he moved to Cambridge, where he died on 29 October 1981. He was cremated at Cambridge on 9 November.<br>
<br>Knight's second wife, <a name="cosubject_64013"></a><span class="headword">Frideswide Frances Emma <span class="st"> [Frida]</span> Knight <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Stewart]</span></span>  (1910&#150;1996), <span class="occ">communist activist</span>, was born on 11 November 1910, one of four daughters (there was one son) of the Revd Dr Hugh Fraser Stewart (1863&#150;1948), theologian and scholar of French literature and fellow and dean of St John's College, Cambridge, and his wife, Jessie Graham, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Crum (<i>d</i>. 1966), an early Newnham student and the first to gain a first-class degree there. Frida enjoyed a liberal Cambridge childhood, but her schooling was curtailed at the age of fourteen by a rare heart condition. Sent to Italy to recuperate, she became an active anti-fascist, and soon joined the Communist Party. In 1937 she went to Spain under the auspices of the national joint committe for Spanish relief, helping to establish a children's hospital at Malaga, then working in Madrid as a typist and translator for the republican press agency. After the Francoist victory she assisted republicans held in camps in France; in 1940 she was interned by the Germans but escaped, taking to England to de Gaulle a message hidden in a cigarette. For the next two years she worked in London for the Free French. She remained a member of the Communist Party until it formally ended in 1991. At her home in Reading she was also active in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and when back in Cambridge she founded Cambridge Against the Missile Bases, arranged concerts by Soviet performers, and chaired the Cambridge&#150;Cuba solidarity campaign. Her several publications included books on her escape from France, the French resistance, William Frend (1757&#150;1841), reformer and scientific writer, and Cambridge music from the middle ages onwards. She also contributed articles to the communist <span class="italic">Daily Worker</span>, later the <span class="italic">Morning Star</span>. She died on 2 October 1996.<br>
