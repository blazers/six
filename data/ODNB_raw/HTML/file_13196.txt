<span class="headword">Hibbert,  Robert</span>  (1769&#150;1849), <span class="occ">philanthropist</span>, was born on 25 October 1769 in Jamaica, the third and posthumous son of John Hibbert (1732&#150;1769), a Jamaica merchant, and his wife, Janet (<i>d</i>. 1778), daughter of Samuel Gordon. Following his mother's death he returned to England and was enrolled at Eton College in 1779. For a period in the 1780s he was a pupil, at Nottingham, of Gilbert Wakefield, who greatly influenced him. When Wakefield was imprisoned in 1801 for political pamphleteering, Hibbert sent him &pound;1000.<br>
<br>Hibbert entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1787, where he formed a lifelong friendship with William Frend and graduated in 1791. He went to Kingston, Jamaica, the same year as partner in a family business. There he married, on 12 September 1792, Elizabeth Jane (1776&#150;1853), daughter of John Nembhard MD. There were no children of the marriage. Hibbert and his wife returned to England in 1803, and in 1806 he bought the estate of East Hyde, near Luton, Bedfordshire. In 1819 he founded a charity at Luton to provide almshouses for twenty-four widows.<br>
<br>In Jamaica Hibbert owned slaves and was unconvinced by the arguments of Frend that this was immoral. In 1817 he sent out a Unitarian minister, Thomas Cooper, as a missionary to his slaves; he stayed in Jamaica until 1821 in the attempt to improve their moral and religious condition. Controversy attended the publication of Cooper's report describing his failure. Hibbert sold his Jamaica holdings at a loss in 1836, having previously disposed of his Bedfordshire estate in 1833 and moved to London. He died at his home, 13 Welbeck Street, London, on 23 September 1849, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
<br>Hibbert's importance centres on the deed he executed in 1847, to come into effect after his death and that of his wife. A trust was to be set up to apply the income from capital &#145;in such manner as the trustees deem most conducive to the spread of Christianity in its most simple and intelligible form, and to the unfettered exercise of the right of private judgment in matters of religion&#146;. He saw this formula as synonymous with Unitarianism, and the trust was originally called the Antitrinitarian Fund, the object of which was to provide divinity scholarships to encourage learning and culture among heterodox ministers.<br>
<br>However, his legal adviser, Edwin Wilkins Field, widened the founder's purpose, and in the early decades of the trust's history, after its formation in 1853, was mainly instrumental in expanding its scope. Throughout its history the trust has consistently supported pioneering ventures. An annual Hibbert lecture was commenced in 1878, given by a leading thinker of the day and subsequently published. These became an established institution, and, while they were discontinued for periods in the twentieth century, were reintroduced on BBC radio in the 1980s.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Hibbert Journal</span> was first published in 1902 under the editorship of Revd L. P. Jacks, who remained in the post until 1947. Unique at its inception, it was for half a century one of the main theological and philosophical journals published in the United Kingdom; the 1909 issue, entitled <span class="italic">Jesus or Christ?</span>, is considered a key document in twentieth-century theological scholarship. The journal ceased publication in 1968.<br>
<br>The trust has consistently given grants towards learned publications, and supported scholars and fellows at universities both in the UK and abroad. Since the 1850s the trust has given regular support to Manchester College, located first in London and then at Oxford, and its students. During the Second World War it set up Hibbert Houses at several places in the Middle East to provide for the welfare and support of military personnel, an activity which continued into the 1960s within Great Britain.<br>
