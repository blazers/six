<span class="headword">Armorer, Sir  Nicholas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1620&#150;1686), <span class="occ">royalist army officer, conspirator, and courtier</span>, was born at Belford, Northumberland, a younger son of Thomas Armorer (<i>d</i>. 1642), of Belford, and his wife, Margaret, daughter of Robert Clavering of Callaly in the same county. Like his brother William he early broke free from the confines of life as the younger son of a minor country gentleman. As a young man he joined the English forces sent to support the attempts of the lord lieutenant, James Butler, marquess of Ormond, to suppress the Irish rising which erupted in October 1641, but he returned to England after the outbreak of the civil war in 1642.<br>
<br>Armorer served in the Welsh border counties and Staffordshire in a war of skirmishes and sieges. By 1645 he was a captain, commanding the garrison of Sir Richard Newport's fortified house High Ercall in Shropshire. Parliament's capture of Shrewsbury in February, followed by the decisive royalist defeat at Naseby in June, left Armorer's garrison dangerously exposed. In April and July High Ercall withstood sieges, but surrendered on terms after a third assault in March 1646. Armorer withdrew to Worcester which surrendered in its turn in July, by which time the English civil war was effectively over.<br>
<br>Armorer's subsequent movements are obscure but he possibly withdrew for a time to Ireland, where the Stuart cause was not yet seen as lost. By 1652 he was in exile in Holland. On 3 June Sir Edward Nicholas, secretary of state to the exiled Charles II, wrote from The Hague to Lord Hatton in Paris to report a duel between Major Armorer and another exiled cavalier, Lieutenant-Colonel Sir William Leighton.<br>
<br>Notwithstanding this duel, it is clear that Armorer was not prepared to be just another bitter and quarrelsome exiled royalist, living in shabby obscurity and hiding from his creditors. On 15 September 1653 Nicholas reported to Sir Edward Hyde, Charles II's chief counsellor in Paris, that Armorer, a servant of the princess royal, Mary of Orange, was about to go to England &#145;upon some particulars of his own, [and] would be glad to receive his Majesty's commands, being well known to, and well beloved by, all the King's party, not only in the North where he was born, but in Shropshire, Staffordshire and those parts&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 4180, fol. 104).<br>
<br>This journey was the beginning of a career that made Armorer one of the most resourceful and enterprising of the agents employed in the murky and dangerous world of royalist conspiracy. On 24 November Armorer wrote to Nicholas to recommend that Charles &#145;fix on one or two of the most prudent&#146; of his supporters to receive the king's authority &#145;to attend his affairs, and put them in a form that there may be no clashing&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 4180, fol. 108). By February 1654 the secret council of the Sealed Knot was in existence, authorized to plan and carry out a full-scale rising to overthrow the protectorate and restore the Stuarts.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1650s Armorer made a series of dangerous missions to England to advance plots to overthrow the protectorate. He travelled widely, making contact with numerous royalist activists, for example, with Sir Vincent Corbet in Shropshire, with Colonel Edward Grey in Yorkshire, and with Francis Willoughby, Lord Willoughby of Parham, in Lincolnshire. He showed his resourcefulness in several narrow escapes. Imprisoned in Dover Castle in February 1655, when he landed in England to take part in the royalist rising planned to break out in March, he was released as a result of the intervention of the sympathetic clerk of the passage. The discomfited governor of the castle, in an exculpatory letter of 11 February to the protectorate's secretary of state John Thurloe, described Armorer as &#145;a pretty full and somewhat ruddy faced man, of a middle stature, of about thirty-five or thirty-six years of age, having a deep brown hair, short beard, his hair on his beard and face much of a colour&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., Rawlinson MS A 23, fol. 207). Undeterred by this narrow escape, Armorer travelled north with Henry Wilmot, earl of Rochester, who had been appointed to command the royalist rising in Yorkshire. Reduced to the condition of fugitives by the ignominious collapse of the rising in March, Armorer and Rochester were arrested in Aylesbury, but judicious bribery by Rochester enabled them to escape.<br>
<br>Despite the protectorate government's efforts, and the information on the movements of royalist agents provided by Henry Manning, Thurloe's spy at the exiled court, Armorer and most of the other conspirators involved in the rising escaped back to the continent during 1655. Manning's treachery was discovered in December, and after a secret trial he was executed, not, as some historians have claimed, by Nicholas Armorer but by his brother William Armorer, an equerry at the exiled court, and Sir James Hamilton. At the time of Manning's interrogation and execution Armorer was in the Netherlands, in attendance on Mary of Orange.<br>
<br>A feature of Armorer's career is his use of exile, an experience usually represented in totally negative terms, as a means of advancing his fortunes. Having begun as an obscure middle-ranking officer and client of Secretary Nicholas, on his return to the continent in August 1654 he reported not to Nicholas at The Hague but to Hyde and Ormond at the exiled court then in the Rhineland. Nicholas was irritated by this switch of allegiance but was reassured by his friend Thomas Ross on 11 April 1656 that Armorer had explained &#145;it was the King's command, or he would not have relinquished you, to whom he is bound by great obligation and affection&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1655&#150;6</i>, 263).<br>
<br>As royalist conspiracy slowly revived after the suppression of Penruddock's rising, Armorer made several more missions to England. He was in London early in 1658 when Ormond made his brief personal visit to the capital to sound out the possibilites of a rising, and he was one of the agents who withdrew hurriedly to the continent when the plans collapsed in a welter of arrests, followed by show trials and executions. A fortunate survivor of arrest and trial was John Mordaunt, who rapidly emerged as a new and energetic director of royalist conspiracy, far more enterprising than the cautious &#145;wary gentlemen&#146; of the Sealed Knot. With the approval of Hyde and Ormond, Armorer soon included Mordaunt among his patrons. During the first half of 1659 Armorer was almost constantly on the move between the exiled court at Brussels and Mordaunt and other conspirators in England, carrying letters, intelligence reports, royal commissions, and instructions.<br>
<br>Once again the hopes of the royalists were shattered when Sir George Booth's rising was crushed in August 1659. Armorer and Mordaunt, with other conspirators and insurgents, fled back into exile. They were in Calais when General John Lambert carried out a military coup in London and forcibly expelled the recently restored Rump Parliament. Armorer carried the news of the dramatic change in the political situation to Charles II, in attendance on the Franco-Spanish peace conference at Fuentarrabia in the Pyrenees. Mordaunt wrote to Charles on 16 October that &#145;Armorer will inform your Majesty of all particulars I have not time to write&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letter-Book</span>, 42).<br>
<br>Within days of his arrival at Fuentarrabia Armorer's years of dangerous and arduous service to the Stuart cause were rewarded by Charles II with his appointment as equerry in ordinary to the hunting stable. Armorer acknowledged the role of his patrons in this, writing to Hyde on 3 November and to Lady Mordaunt on 7 November of his gratitude and his hope of continued patronage.<br>
<br>Further rewards followed when the monarchy was restored seven months later. Armorer was knighted in 1662, and received several grants of confiscated land and the monopoly on the import of horses for the king's use. As he moved steadily more deeply into Ormond's extensive patronage network he spent more time in Ireland, where he was appointed both to a captaincy in the Irish Guards and to the post of lieutenant-governor of Duncannon fort, which guarded the sea approach to Waterford. Armorer moved easily between the court of Charles II and Ormond's viceregal world in Ireland. Clearly a cheerful and convivial fellow, his traditionally cynical view, expressed to Sir Joseph Williamson in August 1668 of &#145;the crowd, hurry and business&#146; of the court, &#145;one week making private friendships, and before the month ends, breaking them like glass, never to be patched up again&#146;, is contradicted by his own wide circle of friends and companions and by the frequent references in his correspondence to his enjoyment of the pleasures of life  (<span class="italic">CSP dom., 1667&#150;8</span>, 543). Armorer died on 15 February 1686 in Dublin, where he was buried. He seems not to have married.<br>
<br>Armorer's career belies the traditional view that royalist exile was a uniformly bitter and melancholy experience, characterized by grinding poverty, frustrating idleness, widespread immorality, and sterile personal and factional feuds. Having arrived in Holland as an unknown officer who had not held regimental command, Armorer transformed his fortunes through involvement in royalist conspiracy. His energy and courage, his resourcefulness and reliability made him one of the most valued of the agents who risked their lives to maintain communication between the exiled court and the king's supporters in England. Although the plots and risings all failed dismally, their continued occurrence helped to keep alive what Mordaunt called &#145;the habit of loyalty&#146;. The preservation of the Stuart cause in England during the 1650s was materially assisted by Armorer's activities. His eventual rewards illustrate his skill in attaching himself to those patrons best placed to assist their clients. His career is marked by a series of changes of patrons that progressively moved him closer to the leaders of the royalist party.<br>
