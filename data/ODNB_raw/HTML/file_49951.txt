<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Rucker, Sir  Arthur Nevil</span>  (1895&#150;1991), <span class="occ">public servant</span>, was born on 20 June 1895 at 19 Gledhow Gardens, Kensington, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37920/', "Sir Arthur William R&#252;cker (1848&#150;1915)")</script>, a physicist, and his second wife, Thereza Charlotte, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Story-Maskelyne (1863&#150;1941), a promoter of household science teaching [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48425/', "Rucker, Thereza Charlotte")</script>]. A scientist of high distinction, Sir Arthur R&uuml;cker senior eventually became the first principal of the University of London. He had earlier been sought by Joseph Chamberlain for a similar post at the University of Birmingham, a fact which formed a bond between his son and Chamberlain's.<br>
<br>After leaving Marlborough College in the summer of 1914 Arthur R&uuml;cker joined the War Office and worked there unpaid; from 1915 to the end of the war he fought bravely in France and was twice wounded during his service with the Suffolk regiment. After a year of study at Trinity College, Cambridge, he passed the first part of the mathematical tripos, joined the Ministry of Health as an assistant principal, and informed his colleagues there that he wished to drop the umlaut from the spelling of his name. He married on 7 November 1922 Elsie Marion (1899&#150;1991), daughter of George Broadbent, a London solicitor. They had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>At the Ministry of Health, Rucker's zeal and aptitude for business were soon noticed. Douglas Veale, then a senior figure in the ministry and later registrar of the University of Oxford, recorded: &#145;I have a very high opinion of Mr. Rucker's ability and enthusiasm&#146;  (note by D. Veale, January 1924, TNA: PRO, MH 107/62). Within a few years Rucker had been appointed private secretary to the minister of health, first Neville Chamberlain and then in succession Arthur Greenwood, Chamberlain again, Sir Edward Hilton Young, and finally Sir Kingsley Wood. Promoted early to the rank of assistant secretary in 1935, and appointed CBE in 1937, he became director of establishments and public relations at the ministry in the latter year.<br>
<br>Just as Chamberlain admired Rucker's efficiency, industry, and acuity, so Rucker valued Chamberlain's integrity, businesslike habits, and capacity to set a high standard to the civil service. When Rucker was called to be principal private secretary to the prime minister in the spring of 1939, the minister of health wrote: &#145;We have all admired and appreciated your work and it is no surprise to us to perceive that others have been watching you also&#146;  (Walter Elliot to Rucker, 6 May 1939, TNA: PRO, MH 107/62). For sixteen agonizing months Rucker served Chamberlain faithfully. Like the prime minister, he believed that Britain's fault had been to let her diplomacy outrun her strength, and to threaten what she could not fulfil; he was convinced that the government had been right not to precipitate a war with Germany in the autumn of 1938, and equally right to give a guarantee to Poland in 1939. Harbouring no illusions about Russia, he was surprised neither by the Nazi&#150;Soviet pact nor by the invasion of Finland. His junior colleague in the private office, John Colville, noted in December 1939:<blockquote>Alone with Arthur at No. 10 in the morning. He has a most endearing personality and is extraordinarily thorough. At the same time, unlike most people who are thorough and conscientious, he is full of ideas and inspired by ideals. (Colville's diary, 9 Dec 1939, Colville papers 1/1, CAC Cam.)</blockquote>Having unhesitatingly elected to remain with Chamberlain when he became lord president of the council in May 1940, Rucker returned to the Ministry of Health later that year. Thence he was &#145;seconded for special duties&#146; in Cairo. Churchill had decided to establish a minister of state in the Middle East, with wide-ranging tasks which included liaison with the commanders-in-chief and the British embassy in Cairo. The new minister, Oliver Lyttelton, resembled Rucker in no outward particulars, Lyttelton being enormously tall and ebullient, Rucker small and restrained. Nevertheless, Lyttelton made Rucker head of his private office and remembered gratefully his saint-like character and high ability. &#145;He was calm and conscientious. I learnt later that when he put his foot down, he trod on no one's toes, and his decisions did not lead to discussion and resentment&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Lord Chandos</span>, 225). For the better part of two years Rucker threw himself wholeheartedly into complicated and delicate tasks, first under Lyttelton and then under his successor. For these exceptional services he was appointed KCMG in 1942. The only diversion of which there is a record is that he learned to fly and gained his pilot's licence after fourteen hours' instruction.<br>
<br>On his return to the Ministry of Health as deputy secretary in 1943, Rucker was immediately plunged into the preparations for a national health service. Tireless and inventive in seeking the compromises which would lead to an agreed scheme, he had perhaps hoped to become the permanent head of the ministry in 1945. Contrary to what has often been stated, his relations with the new minister, Aneurin Bevan, were good; but there was some incompatibility of temperament, and it is unlikely that Rucker's close association with Chamberlain eased his relations with Bevan. Rucker pressed the case for retaining the voluntary hospitals. Equally, he did not wish to remove control of other hospitals from local authorities, which would constitute the biggest reduction yet made in their powers; and he attached high importance to the close relations between them and the ministry, which they had hitherto regarded as their protector and interpreter in Whitehall. Nevertheless, Rucker entirely recognized the right of the minister to decide differently, as Bevan did when he elected to nationalize almost all hospitals. The legislation passed through parliament during 1946, but was not implemented until the summer of 1948.<br>
<br>Rucker had by then received the offer of a post with the United Nations. His time in Cairo had helped to fit him for this, though he and his family accepted the long separations with sadness. He became deputy director-general of the International Refugee Organization in 1948, grappling with enormous post-war problems in that context, and then deputy agent-general of the UN Korean Reconstruction Agency in 1951, where his services were warmly appreciated and eventually recognized by the award of the Korean order of Diplomatic Merit. Later he acted for six years (1956&#150;62) as deputy chairman of the Stevenage new town corporation and then for four years (1962&#150;6) as its chairman. To provide decent housing, not least for those in need, Rucker believed to be one of the first duties of a civilized society. He was a leading member of the committee which produced the Milner Holland report of 1965 on housing in the slums of London; this played a crucial part in persuading successive governments to support housing associations. A founder of the World of Property Housing Trust, which later changed its name to Sanctuary, he also rendered devoted service to Help the Aged, Hungarian refugees, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, and the University of Wales, which awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1965.<br>
<br>To the end Rucker remained kindly, understanding of others' difficulties, and insistent upon high standards of efficiency and probity. He died at the Curridge House Nursing Home, near Newbury, Berkshire, on 12 July 1991, Lady Rucker having predeceased him by a few weeks. There is a memorial to them both at the parish church in the Berkshire village of Yattendon, Rucker's home for most of his life. They were survived by their four children.<br>
