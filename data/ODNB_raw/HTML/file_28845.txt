<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Watson,  John</span>  (1725&#150;1783), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and antiquary</span>, was born on 26 March 1725 at Lyme Handley in Prestbury, Cheshire, the son of Legh Watson and his wife, Hester, daughter of John Yates of Swinton, Lancashire. He was educated at the grammar schools in Eccles, Wigan, and Manchester before matriculating at Brasenose College, Oxford, on 8 April 1742. He graduated BA in 1745 and MA in 1748, having been elected to a Cheshire fellowship of the college in June 1746. He was ordained deacon in December 1746 and served the curacy of Runcorn for a few months before moving to Ardwick, Manchester, where he also acted as tutor to the family of Samuel Birch. Ordained priest in 1749, he was curate of Halifax from 1750 until September 1754, when he was presented to the perpetual curacy of Ripponden, a chapelry of Halifax parish, where he rebuilt the incumbent's residence at his own expense.<br>
<br>He married first on 1 June 1752 Susanna Allon (<i>d</i>. 1757), daughter of Samuel Allon, vicar of Sandbach, Cheshire, with whom he had a son. After her death he married on 11 July 1761 Ann Jacques, daughter of James Jacques of Leeds; they had a son, who also went to Brasenose, and a daughter.<br>
<br>Watson's antiquarian activities, particularly on Roman antiquities but also on the barrows of the Halifax area, which he referred to as druidical remains, led to his election as FSA in 1759. He continued these researches, but his time at Ripponden was chiefly occupied in writing a history of Halifax, published in 1775, which became a standard source. His determined whig principles made him unable to read the order of service set out for 30 January in memory of Charles I, though he preached on that anniversary publishing two of his sermons, in 1754 and 1755, in which he set out his views. He also wrote a pamphlet in 1756 critical of the Moravian hymnbook, detailing its non-scriptural elements and regretting what he saw as its emotional, or non-rational, emphasis; however, he ended his critique by wishing the congregation well. At Ripponden he embarked on research at the behest of Sir George Warren of Poynton Lodge, Cheshire, in order to prove that Sir George was the legitimate heir to the earldom of Warenne and Surrey. His <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Ancient Earls of Warren and Surrey and their Descendants</span> was published in a limited edition of six copies in 1776, with a second edition of fifteen copies following in 1779, and a third, larger, edition in 1782. Despite Watson's claim in the preface to the work, his researches were unable to establish Warren's right to the title, but this did not deter Sir George from pursuing that claim vigorously, if unsuccessfully, over the next twenty years.<br>
<br>It was through his whig connections and the patronage of Warren that Watson secured further advancement, first to the rectory of Miningsby, Lincolnshire, in 1766 and then to the valuable living of Stockport, Cheshire, in 1769. There, he continued his antiquarian researches, which now focused on his native county. His extensive papers, deposited at the Bodleian Library, Oxford, John Rylands Library, Manchester, and York Minster Library, have been much used by subsequent writers. A fresh edition of his Halifax history was embarked upon by F. A. Leyland in 1869, but only the first part was published. His interests extended to the collection of literary remains, and he was a noted writer and collector of songs.<br>
<br>Watson died at Stockport on 14 March 1783, possibly as a consequence of injuries received from a kick by a horse. He was survived by his wife and all three children, and his will was proved in the prerogative court of Canterbury in May of that year.<br>
