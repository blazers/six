<span class="headword">Shaw,  William</span>  (1749&#150;1831), <span class="occ">Gaelic grammarian and lexicographer</span>, was born on 3 February 1749 at Clachaig on the island of Arran. He received his early education in Ayr and, from about 1768, at the University of Glasgow, where he was awarded the degree of MA, apparently in 1772, though one source gives 1777 as the date of his graduation. While a student he taught at a grammar school in Glenorchy, Argyll, leaving the post under something of a cloud.<br>
<br>Shaw has come to prominence partly through his friendship with Samuel Johnson, to whom he was introduced in London in 1774. Johnson encouraged him to publish <span class="italic">An Analysis of the Gaelic Language</span>, having seen the material in manuscript. Two editions were published in Edinburgh in 1778. The book has been described by a modern Gaelic scholar as &#145;a rudimentary grammar, with no claim to distinction beyond its being the first published work of its kind&#146;  (MacDonald, 4). With the publication of Stewart's <span class="italic">Elements of Gaelic Grammar</span> in 1801, Shaw's work was superseded.<br>
<br>In June 1779 William Shaw was presented by the duke of Gordon to the parish of Ardclach in the presbytery of Nairn. His short ministry in the Church of Scotland was to begin and end in controversy. Before his ordination and induction to the charge, which took place on 14 October 1779, a paper signed by over sixty parishioners, objecting to the morals of their prospective minister and accusing him of preaching unsound doctrine, was submitted to the presbytery. Shaw's ordination went ahead, but after his settlement few attended his services and he was so unpopular that he was even threatened with stoning. One of the objections from parishioners was that they had difficulty in understanding his Arran Gaelic dialect. His opponents also appear to have been protesting against the system of patronage within the church, by which Shaw had been elected.<br>
<br>By May 1780 the synod of Moray heard complaints of absences from the parish against the minister of Ardclach, but before action could be taken the situation was resolved in August by Shaw's demission of his charge. The rest of his life was to be spent in England, where a new phase in his activities brought him a measure of fame as a writer.<br>
<br>In 1780 William Shaw published <span class="italic">A Galic and English Dictionary</span> in two volumes, and claimed to have travelled 3000 miles in Scotland and Ireland collecting material for it. Once again he became involved in a public dispute. Disappointed with the quality of the finished product, some of the subscribers refused to make the payment they had guaranteed. In the litigation that followed the lexicographer won his case, though, again, modern critics have not been favourable to the work. Shaw's dictionary has been dismissed as &#145;a bare list of words and equivalents, at least as many Irish as Scottish Gaelic among them, and as many obsolete as contemporary&#146;  (MacDonald, 14).<br>
<br>Shaw was also involved in the heated controversy regarding the authenticity of James Macpherson's &#145;Ossianic&#146; poems. He shared the scepticism of Samuel Johnson in questioning the genuineness of the material published by Macpherson, and issued in 1781 <span class="italic">An Enquiry into the Authenticity of the Poems Ascribed to Ossian</span>. John Clark wrote a reply to Shaw's <span class="italic">Enquiry</span>. This resulted in a rejoinder from Shaw. According to James Boswell, &#145;Johnson took Mr. Shaw under his protection, and gave him his assistance in writing a reply, which has been admired by the best judges, and by many considered as conclusive&#146;  (Fitzgerald, 458).<br>
<br>Having withdrawn from the Church of Scotland, William Shaw in course of time became an Anglican clergyman, apparently at Johnson's suggestion. (Shaw had published, anonymously, in 1785, <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life and Writings of the late Dr Samuel Johnson</span>.) He enrolled at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1787, and was eventually awarded the degree of bachelor of divinity in 1800. From 1795 to 1831 he served as rector of Chelvey in Somerset.<br>
<br>Shaw continued to be embroiled in controversy, and in 1801 used his pen to publish a pamphlet attacking Hannah More's proposals for establishing Sunday schools. In 1802, using the pseudonym the Revd Sir Archibald MacSarcasm, Bart., he published the <span class="italic">Life of Hannah More, with a Critical Review of her Writings</span>. The long life of this colourful and controversial clergyman came to an end at the rectory, Chelvey, on 16 September 1831.<br>
