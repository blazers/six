<span class="headword">Quick,  Oliver Chase</span>  (1885&#150;1944), <span class="occ">theologian</span>, was born on 21 June 1885 at Sedbergh vicarage, Yorkshire, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22954/', "Robert Hebert Quick (1831&#150;1891)")</script>, educationist, and Bertha, daughter of General Chase Parr of the Indian army. He was Anderson scholar and head of school at Harrow School, winning a scholarship to Corpus Christi College, Oxford, in 1904. He gained a first class in classical moderations, but, partly because of intellectual differences with his tutor, F. C. S. Schiller, was placed in the third class in Greats in 1908. Turning to theology, he won the Ellerton prize in 1911 for an essay on mysticism. After a year at Bishop's Hostel, Farnham, he was ordained deacon in 1911 and priest in 1913, serving curacies in Beckenham and Wolverhampton. He became a friend of H. R. L. (Dick) Sheppard and member of the so-called Clique associated with Oxford House, Bethnal Green. After two years as vice-principal of Leeds Clergy School from 1913, he served as Sheppard's curate at St Martin-in-the-Fields until his appointment as domestic chaplain to Randall Davidson, archbishop of Canterbury, in 1915. He published his <span class="italic">Essays in Orthodoxy</span>, much influenced by Charles Gore, in 1916. In 1917 he married Davidson's secretary, Frances Winifred, daughter of Hugh William Pearson, of Malton, Yorkshire. They had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>After a year as army chaplain, where Quick was associated with his former principal, B. K. Cunningham, at the chaplains' school at St Omer, he became vicar of Kenley, Surrey, in 1918. A series of residentiary canonries followed, beginning with Newcastle in 1920 and Carlisle in 1923, which gave him the opportunity to lecture widely. He published several volumes of lectures and addresses, including his 1922 Paddock lectures, <span class="italic">Liberalism, Modernism and Tradition</span>, delivered at the General Theological Seminary, New York. His powers of synthesis made him an obvious choice for membership of the archbishops' commission on doctrine set up in 1922. He made a considerable contribution, forming a close friendship with the chairman, William Temple.<br>
<br>In 1927 Quick published <span class="italic">The Christian Sacraments</span> which became an important part of the debate over Anglican orders. He was a keen ecumenist, taking part in the Missionary Conference in Jerusalem in 1928, and the Faith and Order conferences in Lausanne in 1927 and Edinburgh in 1937, where he contributed an influential paper. In 1930 he became a canon of St Paul's, an institution he found backward-looking, but where he wrote his apologetic works, <span class="italic">The Ground of Faith and the Chaos of Thought</span> (1931) and <span class="italic">The Gospel of Divine Action</span> (1933), which sought to &#145;soften the lines at present dividing our &#147;schools of thought&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Gospel of Divine Action</span>, viii). In 1934 Hensley Henson, the bishop of Durham, offered him the professorship at Durham which carried a canonry, where he wrote <span class="italic">Doctrines of the Creeds</span> (1938), &#145;one of the outstanding books on Christian doctrine of our generation&#146;  (Robinson, 62).<br>
<br>In 1939 he was appointed regius professor of divinity and canon of Christ Church, Oxford, where, although hampered by illness and producing no substantial writings, he made an impact through his lectures on the atonement (published posthumously as <span class="italic">The Gospel of the New World</span>, 1944), which attempted to reconcile competing theories. He was awarded honorary DDs from St Andrews in 1928, Oxford in 1939, and Durham in 1941, and became chaplain to the king in 1933. In August 1943 he collapsed in the cathedral and was forced into retirement in December of that year. He died at his home at Larch Hill, Longborough, Gloucestershire, on 21 January 1944 and was buried four days later in Lonborough churchyard; he was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Quick, who possessed a personal humility and a sense of humour &#145;both lively and dry, like good champagne&#146;  (Mozley, &#145;Quick as a theologian&#146;, 8), was primarily a philosophical theologian with a theological temper both &#145;catholic and evangelical, and at the same time inherently Anglican&#146;  (Mozley, <span class="italic">Tendencies</span>, 87). Although he was criticized for lacking an acute historical sense and for being &#145;tone-deaf&#146; to religious experience  (Robinson, 62), his &#145;liberal orthodoxy&#146;  (Ramsey, 107), which listened to all opinions, was influential on the post-war generation of Anglican theologians.<br>
