<span class="headword">Turges <span class="st"> [Thorgest, Thorgils, Thurkill]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> 845), <span class="occ">viking leader</span>, led raids into Ireland in the early ninth century and for a time was successful in the north-east. The name Turges given to him in the Irish records suggests that his real name was Thorgest (&THORN;orgestr) or Thorgils (&THORN;orgils). Nothing is known of his ancestry, although the Icelandic historian Snorri Sturluson, in his <span class="italic">Heimskringla</span>, seems to have confused Turges with a son of the Norwegian king Harald H&aacute;rfagri (Harald Finehair). The most complete account of his career in Ireland is found in the tract <span class="italic">Cogad G&aacute;edel re Gallaib</span> (&#145;The war of the Irish and the Foreigners&#146;) in the <span class="roman">Book of Leinster</span>.<br>
<br>Although vikings had been raiding Ireland and Britain since the late eighth century, in the second quarter of the ninth century the raiders began to use systematically the interior waterways of Ireland, and they began the establishment of permanent bases that would lead eventually to the Hiberno-Scandinavian towns. In 832 vikings plundered the monastery of Armagh three times in one month. <span class="italic">Cogad G&aacute;edel re Gallaib</span> claims that Turges led the raids; and at some point the abbot, named Forind&aacute;n, was replaced as abbot by Turges, who assumed the office for a period of time. Those actions need not have been anti-Christian, but rather an indication of an awareness of the important connection between ecclesiastical support and political power in Ireland. He took control of the viking companies in Ireland and maintained fleets on Lough Neagh and in Louth. He also established a fleet on Lough Ree in 845, whence his troops plundered Meath and Connacht, with destruction of the monasteries of Clonmacnoise, Clonfert, Lough Derg, Terryglass, and Lorrha (Tipperary). This campaign seems to have given Turges control of the monastery of Clonmacnoise, the important midland ecclesiastical centre. His wife, Ota, put it to her own uses by giving audiences while seated on the altar of the church. This seems to have been a ceremony of divination. Also in 845 a viking force, possibly led by Turges, was defeated by the high-king Niall Caille mac &Aacute;eda at Mag Itha. Turges's supremacy ended in that year when he was captured by the king of Clann Cholm&aacute;in and future high-king, M&aacute;el Sechnaill mac M&aacute;ele Ruanaid, and drowned in Lough Owel (Westmeath).<br>
<br>The career and death of Turges became part of Irish literature. In the eleventh century the Irish historian Gilla Coem&aacute;in mac Gilla Samthainne included his drowning as a chronological marker in the versified chronicle <span class="italic">Annalad anall uile</span>. By the twelfth century Gerald of Wales was claiming that Turges was responsible for leading the vikings into Ireland, and he gives an interesting, and apparently fictitious, story of the circumstances of his death. In that tale Turges asked for the hand of the daughter of M&aacute;el Sechnaill, who publicly agreed to the union, but secretly disguised fifteen warriors as his daughter and her retinue. When the viking came to claim his bride, Turges and his company were slain by the decoys.<br>
