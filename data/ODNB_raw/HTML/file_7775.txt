<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dolben,  John</span>  (1625&#150;1686), <span class="occ">archbishop of York</span>, was born on 20 March 1625, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7778/', "Dr William Dolben (1588?&#150;1631)")</script>, prebendary of Lincoln and rector of Stanwick, Northamptonshire, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Williams, who had two other surviving sons and two daughters. He was baptized on 27 March. His mother was the niece of Bishop John Williams, who nominated John to be admitted as a king's scholar at Westminster School, some twelve years later, just before Richard Busby's long and influential tenure as headmaster began. In 1640 John was elected a student of Christ Church, Oxford, and in the following year he composed some Latin verses to celebrate the return of Charles I from Scotland during the deepening political crisis. When civil war came in 1642 he was among a large group of students of Christ Church who enlisted in the king's army. He fought at the battle of Marston Moor on 2 July 1644 as an ensign and was shot in the shoulder carrying the colours. He fought on at the siege of York and was wounded again, this time more seriously in the thigh, being confined to bed for a year as a result. He was promoted to the rank of major in recognition of his courage but by the time he was up and about again the civil war was all but lost.<br>
<br>His war service left a lasting impression on Dolben in a number of ways. His youthful royalism had resulted in serious injury. It is possible that his wounds left a certain lameness in him, which may partly explain the corpulence in later life on which contemporaries remarked. He seems to have retained throughout his life a certain military style and bearing as well as a knowledge of and interest in military affairs as is evident from his sermons.<h2>
<a name="OxfordinterregnumandRestoration"></a>Oxford: interregnum and Restoration</h2>Dolben returned to Oxford after the war in the hope of continuing his studies, graduating MA on 9 December 1647, without the usual preliminary of a BA degree. However, he was deprived of his studentship by the parliamentary visitors of the university in 1648. Thereafter he disappears from the record until 1656, in which year he sought out episcopal ordination (from Bishop King of Chichester), as indeed did many of the clergy who conformed during the period as well as those who, like Dolben, did not. In 1657 he married Catherine Sheldon (1626&#150;1706), daughter of Ralph Sheldon of Stanton in Derbyshire, the niece of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25304/', "Gilbert Sheldon")</script>, a connection which was to have a huge impact on his subsequent career. The couple settled down in Ralph Sheldon's house in St Aldates, Oxford.<br>
<br>Dolben began his ministry in the context of proscribed prayer book services, held in the house of Dr Thomas Willis opposite Merton College, in collaboration with Richard Allestree and John Fell, who was Willis's brother-in-law. These services attracted wide support from Church of England loyalists at the time. Given the partly intentional laxity of interregnum regimes about local religious practice, such activity hardly now appears as daring as it seems to have done to Dolben's nineteenth-century biographers. The latter may have been misled by Dolben's own exaggerated references to the precariousness of life in the 1650s, made in a sermon of 1666  (Dolben, <span class="italic">A Sermon Preached before the King Aug. 14 1666</span>, ix). But of course, such semi-clandestine devotion did Dolben no harm when the tables were turned and the traditional Church of England was restored after 1660. It was immortalized in the famous group portrait of Allestree, Dolben, and Fell by Sir Peter Lely, painted at the time of the Restoration and now in the possession of Christ Church. All three appear in clerical garb. Fell (on the left of the picture) seems somewhat detached, while Allestree (on the right) points very emphatically at an open copy of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, which is one of the volumes on the table before them. Dolben (in the centre) looks straight at the viewer. In this as in other portraits, he cuts a striking figure, with a full face, fine light brown hair, and a piercing eye. Altogether it conveys the strong presence to which at least one contemporary account alludes  (Beddard, 420).<br>
<br>Dolben, along with his co-protagonists Fell and Allestree, received prompt recognition in Restoration Oxford. Dolben and Allestree petitioned for canonries of Christ Church as early as April 1660, to which they were duly appointed in July. Fell became dean. On 3 October Dolben took his DD degree alongside the other two. The three of them joined in penning Latin verses mourning the death of the duke of Gloucester, which were published in <span class="italic">Epicedia academiae Oxoniensis</span> (1660). Dolben was further rewarded with the living of Newington-cum-Britwell, Oxfordshire, on the king's presentation.<br>
<br>The trio had their critics, even in Restoration Oxford. Wood mocked them for trying &#145;to reduce the University to that condition as it stood in Laud's time&#146;; something quite unrealistic given the intervening years  (Clark, 1.348&#150;9), though Wood may have been prejudiced by some difficulties he had had with Dolben over access to certain ecclesiastical registers while Dolben was chapter treasurer.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Dolben's fame as a loyalist clergyman was spreading beyond Oxford. He wrote verses mourning the death of the princess of Orange. In October 1660 he was commissioned by the king, along with Dr Barwick, to visit the condemned regicides in an abortive attempt to solicit expressions of remorse.<h2>
<a name="Prefermentandpolitics"></a>Preferment and politics</h2>A series of senior ecclesiastical promotions came Dolben's way soon after 1660, largely due to the influence of his wife's uncle, Gilbert Sheldon, bishop of London and soon to be archbishop of Canterbury. On 29 April 1661 he was installed as prebendary of Caddington Major in St Paul's Cathedral and on 11 October 1662 nominated archdeacon of London; and shortly after that, vicar of St Giles Cripplegate. Finally, he was raised to the deanery of Westminster, being installed on 5 December 1662. Dolben gradually reduced the number of his appointments, starting with the parochial ones and resigning the archdeaconry in 1664, the same year he became prolocutor of the lower house of convocation, in succession to John Barwick. His star continued to rise at court, culminating in his appointment as clerk of the closet, also in 1664. Dolben rapidly acquired the reputation of being a great preacher, which would be reflected some years later in a passing reference to him in Dryden's <span class="italic">Absalom and Achitophel</span> (lines 868&#150;9). Initially Dolben tended to read the sermons which he delivered at court until a word from Charles II encouraged him to adopt a more extempore style, in which he proved highly effective. It is hard to assess Dolben on the basis of the three published sermons that survive. They certainly possess an admirable clarity and directness along with an underlying note of passion, which could have had a powerful effect on the hearers, even at the court of Charles II. A sermon which he gave before the Commons on a fast day for the fire in October 1666 (from which sadly only brief notes survive) helped to prompt MPs to appoint a committee the next day, to consider strengthening the laws against atheism and irreligious behaviour. On one occasion in Westminster Abbey, when the preacher was taken ill having only named his text and the headings of his sermon, Dolben mounted the pulpit and without any preparation &#145;discoursed much better on each head than the other would have don&#146;  (Beddard, 420). Even towards the end of his life, as archbishop of York, he retained a formidable reputation as a preacher. Dolben's eloquence may have contributed to his next ecclesiastical promotion, to the see of Rochester in 1666. Dolben was allowed to keep the deanery of Westminster <i>in commendam</i>, thus beginning a tradition of pluralism which would last into the early nineteenth century, on the grounds of the poverty of the see. However, he resigned as prebendary of St Paul's at this time. He was consecrated at Lambeth Palace by Sheldon on 25 November 1666, the sermon being preached by Robert South, a friend from Oxford days despite the latter's conformism under the Commonwealth.<br>
<br>Dolben was briefly a member of the privy council but almost immediately his standing at court began to fluctuate dramatically. After the fall of Clarendon he lost his place at court (as did Sheldon and George Morley, bishop of Winchester) and was under a cloud for several years. His well-attested contempt for flattery and his quality of plain-speaking, as Burnet noted, hardly fitted him for court life at the best of times  (<span class="italic">Burnet's History</span>, 2.431). It is true that Burnet had a grudge against him for persuading Sir John Cotton to bar him from using his library while Burnet was researching his history of the Reformation, on the grounds that he was &#145;a great enemy of the prerogative&#146;  (ibid., 2.107). But on this, as on other aspects of Dolben's life, Burnet's judgement seems sound. Only with the rise of Danby would Dolben come fully back into favour, rising to be lord high almoner in 1675.<br>
<br>Just as Dolben's influence at court was waning, he was acquiring a distinctive political role elsewhere: in the Lords. He took his seat there just four days after his consecration and rapidly became a regular attender and effective operator there, with an admirable grasp of procedure. He worked closely with Sheldon and used his new found expertise to defend the church. He was linked with the parliamentary initiatives for comprehension in 1673 and 1674, though as with Morley of Winchester, this did not necessarily imply great flexibility towards dissent. When in due course under Danby defending the church became part of the court's agenda as well, it was Dolben who in 1677 introduced the far-reaching bill to safeguard the Church of England under a Roman Catholic successor.<br>
<br>By the late 1670s, despite Sheldon's death, Dolben was again in line for an ecclesiastical step-up. In 1678 he was offered but declined the archbishopric of Dublin, on grounds of ill health and personal inadequacy, provoking a quizzical response from Charles II (who wondered aloud if Dolben would have turned it down had he known its financial value).<br>
<br>Dolben was loyal to the court, but no mere &#145;yes-man&#146; to any party. In parliament he supported an amendment to Danby's test bill in 1675, inspired by the country opposition, which attempted to distinguish between legal and illegal means of seeking to bring about change in the religious settlement. But in 1678 he voted against a very different test bill, apparently because of the accusation of idolatry against the Roman Catholic church which it contained. He briefly chaired the Lords committee to investigate the Popish Plot and as late as March 1679 he was said to be intimate with Sir Thomas Meres, a leading figure in the country opposition. But Meres was his half-brother and even his political stance would change over the ensuing two years. On 15 November 1680 Dolben was among the fourteen bishops in the House of Lords who helped to vote down the <span class="roman">Exclusion Bill</span>. Dolben's loyalty was recognized and in due course rewarded, when he was made archbishop of York in July 1683. He finally relinquished the deanery of Westminster and the almoner's place along with his southern see and moved north to the scene of his youthful military adventures.<br>
<br>Dolben's tenure of the see of Rochester and the deanery of Westminster had not been without its critics. Simon Patrick drew attention to the lack of progress towards weekly communion at the abbey in this period, and Burnet paid Dolben the back-handed compliment that he was later a better archbishop than he had been a bishop  (<span class="italic">Burnet's History</span>, 2.431). Burnet's grudge notwithstanding, his implied criticism of the Rochester episcopate may have had some truth in it.<br>
<br>Dolben comes across as a vigorous dean. On the day of his installation he persuaded the chapter to enhance the financial provision for the repair and upkeep of the abbey. His commitment to its welfare and defence of its interests seem to have remained throughout his tenure. Pepys found him living &#145;like a great prelate&#146; in the deanery at Westminster, &#145;his lodgings being very good&#146;, on 24 February 1668  (Pepys, 9.89). But it was easier to combine this with his heavy parliamentary involvement than it was to care for his diocese. He did not wholly neglect the latter though, rebuilding the episcopal residence at Bromley after civil war damage, at his own expense, and living in it, at least for a time. His securing the appointment of William Trumbull as both chancellor of the diocese and official to the archdeacon in 1671 at least prevented the clash between the two jurisdictions which occurred elsewhere in this period. The diocesan archives are too scanty to form a judgement as to how conscientiously Dolben fulfilled his episcopal duties, though Dolben Paul, one of his nineteenth-century biographers, appears to be mistaken in thinking that no episcopal register was kept between 1663 and 1683.<h2>
<a name="ArchbishopofYork"></a>Archbishop of York</h2>Dolben would be active in his archdiocese for only just over two and a half years before his death but he made a vigorous start in many areas to what could have been a very significant archiepiscopate had he lived. He had Thomas Comber made precentor of York even before his own arrival there and the two would work closely together during Dolben's tenure. Dolben arrived at Bishopthorpe on 25 September 1683 amid early snow, which failed to deter a cavalcade of some five hundred local gentry and clergy from turning out to greet him. In October he initiated meetings of clergy in their own localities for mutual edification. At the same time he delicately began to explore the possibility of establishing a weekly communion in the minster, an initiative which was clearly highly controversial with the dean and chapter. This would not actually bear fruit until April 1685 but before that Dolben had managed to hold a visitation of the chapter, despite a dispute over his jurisdiction there. He also got Comber completely to reorganize the minster library and conduct a survey of the minster with a view to its repair. Dolben himself provided for a rota of vicars-choral to supervise readers and prevent thefts from the minster library. In addition, he reformed the arrangements for preaching at the minster, so that, among other things, absences were properly covered for and further sermons were provided on Wednesdays and Fridays in Lent.<br>
<br>Sometimes Dolben was over-ambitious in what he attempted: writing to Archbishop Sancroft on 11 August 1684, &#145;I know that I have undertaken too much at once to visit Chester Dioces metropolitically &amp; mine own Dioces together&#146;. Nottinghamshire would have to wait until the following summer  (MS Tanner 32, fol. 117). But he continued to be very active in visiting the various parts of his domain and in conducting confirmations. Unfettered by rival commitments at court or (at least until 1685) in parliament, at York Dolben was able to become at once a reforming archbishop, a political broker on behalf of the government, and an invaluable interpreter of the regional political scene for Archbishop Sancroft. Dolben arrived in the north at the height of the tory reaction and this gave his role an added ideological edge. His family was caught up in the partisan divisions of the time. While he was reaching the peak of his ecclesiastical career, his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7779/', "William Dolben")</script> suffered a reverse in his judicial one, for failing to support the <i>quo warranto</i> proceedings against London. John's elder son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7774/', "Gilbert Dolben")</script>, a lifelong tory whom his father had appointed steward of the manor of Ripon, was rapidly adopted to stand for the parliamentary seat there after the borough surrendered its charter to the archbishop personally in September 1684. His younger son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7776/', "John Dolben")</script>, would later emerge as a whig.<br>
<br>The archbishop's support for the regime was unflinching. Dolben featured prominently in the ceremonies to mark James II's accession in February 1685. He deliberately stayed in the north during the general election campaign which followed to support loyal candidates and was involved in promoting loyal addresses. He could be conciliatory towards those whose loyalty had been compromised but this seems to have reflected a sense of political isolation rather than any sympathy for their views. He wrote to Sancroft &#145;we have soe few friends that we ought to have as few enemies as we can&#146;  (MS Tanner 32, fol. 182). His conciliatoriness did not even extend to sharing a loyal address with people whose motives he suspected. Dolben backed James II's succession to the throne and put his trust in the king's assurance that the Church of England was safe in his hands. By the autumn of 1685, on his way to the second session of parliament, he was apparently beginning to have doubts, though he did not confide these to Sancroft, at least in his letters. Comber may have been wide of the mark when he wrote that Dolben's fears for the church shortened his life but there can be no doubt that by the time of his death at Bishopthorpe from smallpox on 11 April 1686 he had become a worried man. Dolben was buried on 12 April in the minster and an impressive monument was erected there in his memory. He made a number of bequests to institutions with which he had been associated, for example, leaving some 367 books to the recently reorganized minster library.<br>
<br>Dolben was survived by his wife for some twenty years. She was buried in due course in the church at Finedon in Northamptonshire, where Gilbert Dolben had acquired property by marriage. His other son, John, also survived him. One daughter, Catherine, had died in infancy.<br>
<br>From his surviving correspondence and published sermons Dolben emerges as a passionate man, sometimes hasty in his judgements of others and occasionally indiscreet but generous to those who won his favour. He was an energetic and practical-minded churchman, who really found his m&eacute;tier as archbishop of York towards the end of an eventful life.<br>
