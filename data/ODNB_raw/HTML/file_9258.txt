<span class="headword">Fell,  John</span>  (1735&#150;1797), <span class="occ">Independent minister and classical tutor</span>, was born at Cockermouth, Cumberland, on 22 August 1735, the son of Daniel Fell, a clerk at the dissenting meeting-house and a schoolmaster. He was apprenticed to a tailor in Cockermouth and after completing his apprenticeship moved to London to continue in this trade. There he developed an ambition to become a dissenting minister and, with the financial support of friends and the King's Head Society, entered Mile End Academy in 1757. Here he received his ministerial training from John Conder, Thomas Gibbons, and John Walker. He proved to be an able, diligent, and well-motivated student and gained the respect of his tutors, especially Walker, the classical tutor, who gave up his time to help him in his studies.<br>
<br>After leaving the academy in 1761, Fell was for a short time an assistant in a school at Norwich and tutor in a gentleman's family. In 1762 he accepted an invitation to minister to an Independent congregation at Beccles, Suffolk. Here he remained until 1770, but declined to accept pastoral responsibility for the congregation as &#145;they were not formed into a regular church&#146;  (&#145;Biographical memoir&#146;, 1). In May 1770 he succeeded David Parry as minister at the Independent chapel in Thaxted, Essex, where he was ordained on 24 October. His ministry in Thaxted proved hugely successful. He became &#145;useful and beloved&#146; and the &#145;object of universal respect even among Anglicans&#146;  (ibid., 3). As a preacher his manner was lively and energetic and though strictly orthodox he was no bigot. The most memorable of his published works, which did much to enhance his reputation as a biblical and classical scholar, date from his time at Thaxted. The first two of note were <span class="italic">Essay on the Love of One's Country</span> (1772) and <span class="italic">Genuine Protestantism, or, The Unalienable Rights of Conscience Defended</span> (1773). The extent of his classical learning was revealed in <span class="italic">The Idolatry of Greece and Rome</span> (1785), which was a reply to Hugh Farmer's treatise on the worship of classical gods. Fell did not confine his literary works to religion and classical themes. He published essays on the penal laws (1774) and English grammar (1784), while his <span class="italic">Remarks on Rowley's Poems</span> (1782) demonstrated a talent for literary criticism.<br>
<br>On 1 October 1787 Fell succeeded Benjamin Davies as resident and classical tutor at Homerton Academy, London, but his period of office there was not enjoyable or successful. He found difficulty maintaining discipline among the students, whose respect and support he failed to gain. One of them, William Walford, accused him of &#145;a want of energy in stimulating his pupils to exertion&#146; and described his methods of teaching Latin and Greek as &#145;very defective &hellip; and deficient&#146;  (Walford, 101&#150;4). It would seem that Fell's quick temper and irritable manner led to frequent altercations with both the students and his fellow tutors. This, together with his republican sympathies, led the academy to insist on his resignation. Fell left Homerton Academy in January 1797. His defenders claimed that his treatment was unjust and &#145;unpardonably severe&#146;  (Hunter) and maintained that the spirit of insubordination and discontent had been rife in the academy for some time before his appointment. His friends rallied to his support. A London merchant procured a sufficient sum of money to provide him with an annuity of &pound;100, while friends collected &pound;200 for him as remuneration for a course of twelve lectures to be delivered on the evidences of Christianity. Fell preached four of these to crowded audiences in the Scots Church, London Wall, but deteriorating health, in part brought on by the depression he felt over his dismissal, prevented him from finishing the lecture course. This was eventually completed by Henry Hunter and the full set of twelve lectures was published in 1798.<br>
<br>Fell never recovered from his illness. He died, unmarried, at Homerton on 6 September 1797 and was buried in Bunhill Fields on 15 September, when a funeral oration was delivered by the Revd Joseph Brooksbank. A funeral sermon by his close friend Henry Hunter was preached on 24 September at the Old Jewry.<br>
