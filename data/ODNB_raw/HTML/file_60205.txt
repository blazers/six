<span class="headword">Hedderwick,  James</span>  (1814&#150;1897), <span class="occ">journalist and poet</span>, was born on 18 January 1814 in Govan, Glasgow, the third son of James Hedderwick (<i>d</i>. 1864), letterpress printer, and Joanna McNeilage. His formative years were spent in Glasgow, but included a short spell in the USA at the age of eight in 1822, where his father had gone in search of work. On the family's return shortly thereafter, his father was appointed the queen's printer, and Hedderwick began an apprenticeship in his father's firm. His literary talents, which he cultivated through contributing to various local literary periodicals and newspapers in his late teens, soon led him to contemplate changing vocations, and in 1836 he began studies in English literature at London University, where he gained distinction in his first year by winning first prize in rhetoric. In 1837, however, he gave up academic study to return to Glasgow, where he started up the <span class="italic">Saltwater Gazette</span>, a short-lived literary periodical. Later that year he joined the staff of the Edinburgh <span class="italic">Scotsman</span>, becoming assistant editor under the direction of its editor, Charles MacLaren. It was a position he retained until 1842, when he returned to Glasgow to establish the <span class="italic">Glasgow Citizen</span>, a weekly paper run in conjunction with his elder brother Robert. The <span class="italic">Citizen</span> distinguished itself by featuring work of prominent Scottish authors such as Alexander Smith, David Gray, and William Black. Hedderwick also contributed original work to journals such as <span class="italic">Chambers's Journal</span>, and in 1844 published his first collection of poetry.<br>
<br>Now firmly established in a career as editor, poet, and newspaper proprietor, Hedderwick became engaged to Ellen Ness, a young woman from South Leith in Edinburgh. They were married on 11 January 1846 in Gorbals, Lanarkshire, and over the next seventeen years were to have seven children, including Thomas C. H. Hedderwick, lawyer and MP for Wickburghs in 1896. Ellen Ness died some time in the 1860s, and Hedderwick subsequently remarried.<br>
<br>Between 1850 and 1882 Hedderwick's career flourished. In addition to publishing further works of poetry (<span class="italic">Lays of Middle Age, and other Poems</span>, 1858; <span class="italic">The Villa by the Sea, and other Poems</span>, 1881) and running the <span class="italic">Glasgow Citizen</span>, in 1860 he founded <span class="italic">Hedderwick's Miscellany of Instructive and Entertaining Literature</span>, a compendium similar to <span class="italic">Chambers's Journal</span>. It was to last only two years, folding in 1862. Undaunted, Hedderwick started the <span class="italic">Glasgow Evening Citizen</span> in August 1864, a daily halfpenny evening newspaper that heralded and gave impetus to the subsequent expansion of cheap late-edition journalism in Britain. While not the pioneer of the first cheap evening paper in Scotland and Britain (that honour lay with the <span class="italic">Greenock Telegraph</span>), Hedderwick's <span class="italic">Glasgow Evening Citizen</span> was the best known and most successful of such enterprises, at one point claiming the largest circulation of any paper in the west of Scotland. Its success bred imitation south of the border, and Hedderwick was instrumental in aiding subsequent start-ups of other evening papers in England, including that of <span class="italic">The Echo</span> (London). Based on his initial success with the <span class="italic">Glasgow Evening Citizen</span>, Hedderwick also established the <span class="italic">Glasgow Weekly Citizen</span>, a weekly literary continuation of the original daily broadsheet. He continued in his capacity as editor of both papers until 1882, when he retired to Helensburgh, near Glasgow. His literary and editorial work was recognized in 1878 by the award of an honorary degree of doctor of laws by the University of Glasgow, and he published a volume of memoirs entitled <span class="italic">Backward Glances</span> in 1891 which focused on the literary acquaintances he had made during his working career. He died from complications arising from a stroke on the morning of 1 December 1897 at his home in Rocklands, Helensburgh.<br>
