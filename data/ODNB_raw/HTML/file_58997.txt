<span class="headword">Roberts, Sir  Charles George Douglas</span>  (1860&#150;1943), <span class="occ">poet and writer</span>, was born on 10 January 1860, in Douglas, near Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada, the elder son of the Revd George Goodridge Roberts LLD and his wife, Emma Wetmore Bliss. His brother was Theodore Goodridge Roberts (1877&#150;1953), also a writer. Emma Roberts's father was of United Empire loyalist stock; her ancestor the Revd Daniel Bliss (1715&#150;1764) was the great-grandfather of Ralph Waldo Emerson. From 1861 Roberts lived in Westcock, New Brunswick, by the remote Tantramar marshes on the upper bay of Fundy, where he was tutored by his father. During 1873&#150;6 he was educated at the Collegiate School in Fredericton, where his cousin (William) Bliss Carman (1861&#150;1929) was a pupil. He attended the University of New Brunswick from 1876, graduating with a BA in 1879 (MA, 1881). He was headmaster of Chatham high school in 1879&#150;82, and of York Street School, Fredericton, in 1882&#150;3. Roberts married Mary (May) Fenety (<i>d</i>. 1930) on 29 December 1880. In 1883 he was invited by Goldwin Smith to edit <span class="italic">The Week</span>, a cultural magazine published weekly in Toronto. As editor, Roberts published works by Bliss Carman and Archibald Lampman, and encouraged other rising poets. He disagreed, however, with Smith's views on the debate over Canada's potential annexation to the United States, and so resigned after three months.<br>
<br>Roberts's reputation became firmly established during his ten fruitful years as professor of English at King's College, Windsor, Nova Scotia, from 1885 to 1895, where he wrote reviews, lectured widely, and produced his best poems. At the height of his poetic career he left to become a freelance writer. Living at first in Fredericton, he soon became restless and moved to New York in 1897 to work briefly as assistant editor of the <span class="italic">Illustrated American</span> and to be at the heart of literary life. From New York he travelled to Europe and London at various times between 1899 and 1907, and resided mainly in London during 1912&#150;25. There he met such celebrities as the prime minister, Ramsay MacDonald, the prince of Wales, Oscar Wilde, and Algernon Charles Swinburne; he also became a friend of Richard le Gallienne. In 1914 he joined the Legion of Frontiersmen as a private, rising eventually to major in 1917; in 1916 he went to the western front as special press officer to the Canadian corps, and in 1918 was recalled to the war records office in London. He finally returned to Canada in 1925 and settled in Toronto.<br>
<br>Roberts became known as the father of Canadian poetry. He had grown up in the 1870s, when the spirit of national idealism following confederation and the debate about independence, imperial federation, or annexation with America, were very much alive. The young nation needed a distinct literature of its own and writers were much in demand. Roberts, Archibald Lampman, Bliss Carman, and Duncan Campbell Scott, emerged as the most prominent poets of that generation, and later became known as the confederation poets. The two most important influences of Roberts's formative years were his father, who had aroused his interest in English and classical literature, and George R. Parkin, his charismatic headmaster in Fredericton, who had fired his passion for Tennyson, Browning, Arnold, Swinburne, Rossetti, and the English Romantic poets. The unusual beauty of the maritime surroundings of his childhood, the farming and fishing communities, and the wild forests of New Brunswick, inspired him throughout his life.<br>
<br>Roberts's first collection, <span class="italic">&#145;Orion&#146; and other Poems</span> (1880), largely drawn from Greek legend and the works of Keats, Shelley, and Tennyson, became a literary landmark in Canada, and an inspiration to other poets, particularly Archibald Lampman. <span class="italic">In Divers Tones</span> (1886) turns to the landscapes of his youth and contains the elegiac &#145;Tantramar Revisited&#146;, possibly his best poem, as well as sonnets, love poems, and three patriotic poems (&#145;Canada&#146;, &#145;Collect for Dominion Day&#146;, and &#145;An Ode for the Canadian Confederacy&#146;). In his best poems the pioneering ethos of the settler and man's confrontation with wild nature are fundamental to his themes and imagery. Roberts found his true voice in <span class="italic">Songs of the Common Day</span> (1893), containing a sonnet sequence following the seasonal work of farmers in New Brunswick, and &#145;Ave! an Ode for the Shelley Centenary&#146;. In poems such as &#145;The Potato Harvest&#146;, he presents the primal activities of farming and husbandry in mythologically archetypal forms. <span class="italic">The Book of the Native</span> (1896), containing several unsuccessful mystical poems, marked a decline. <span class="italic">New York Nocturnes</span> (1898), with its urban themes and nostalgic love lyrics, and other collections published after he had left Canada, such as <span class="italic">The Book of the Rose</span> (1903) and <span class="italic">New Poems</span> (1910), added little to his reputation. <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> appeared in 1901 (revised 1919). His technical facility ranged over a variety of forms, including sonnets, the Petrarchan sonnet, ballad variants, and topographical odes. His effective use of rhyme and rhythm, together with his characteristically lyrical-elegiac tone, was well suited to the content of his verse.<br>
<br>During nearly thirty years of self-exile Roberts wrote little poetry of merit. When he returned to Canada in 1925, however, he was welcomed as a hero. A poetic revival followed with <span class="italic">The Vagrant of Time</span> (1927), in which he began experimenting with new metres, and <span class="italic">&#145;The Iceberg&#146; and other Poems</span> (1931), which contains a haunting free-verse poem about the <i>Titanic</i> narrated by the iceberg. <span class="italic">Selected Poems</span> (1936) was followed by <span class="italic">Canada Speaks for Britain</span> (1941), containing his war poems. A younger generation of poets, including A. M. Klein and A. J. M. Smith, had emerged during the 1930s. Influenced by modernism and contemporary movements outside Canada, they rejected the Victorian-Romantic modes practised by Roberts and his generation. In several reappraisals since the 1980s, scholars have acknowledged his important contribution to the course of Canadian literature. Roberts left only a few memorable poems, but above all he gave Canada an indigenous poetic voice. His <span class="italic">Complete Poems</span>, edited by Desmond Pacey and Graham C. Adams, appeared in 1985, and <span class="italic">The Collected Letters of Sir Charles G. D. Roberts</span>, edited by Laurel Boone, in 1989.<br>
<br>Roberts is also remembered as the originator of the realistic animal story, a title he shared with Ernest Thompson Seton, whose best-selling <span class="italic">Wild Animals I have Known</span> (1898) did much to popularize the genre. Beginning with <span class="italic">Earth's Enigmas</span> (1896), Roberts published over a dozen collections, including <span class="italic">The Kindred of the Wild</span> (1902), <span class="italic">The Watchers of the Trails</span> (1904), <span class="italic">Red Fox</span> (1905), <span class="italic">The Haunters of the Silences</span> (1907), and <span class="italic">They that Walk the Wild</span> (1924). He described the animal story as &#145;a psychological romance constructed on a foundation of natural science&#146;. When accused by President Theodore Roosevelt of being a &#145;nature-fakir&#146;  (<span class="italic">Everybody's Magazine</span>, June 1907), Roberts argued that animals were motivated not just by instinct but by &#145;something akin to reason&#146;.<br>
<br>As with his poetry, Roberts recreated in his prose a maritime environment deeply rooted in the past. The French&#150;English struggle for Acadia (now Nova Scotia) is the background for several historical romances, including <span class="italic">The Forge in the Forest</span> (1896) and <span class="italic">A Sister to Evangeline</span> (1896). Others were set in New Brunswick, such as <span class="italic">The Heart of the Ancient Wood</span> (1900), about a girl brought up in the wilderness; <span class="italic">The Heart that Knows</span> (1906), set in Westcock; <span class="italic">The Backwoodsmen</span> (1909); and <span class="italic">Eyes of the Wilderness</span> (1933). <span class="italic">Barbara Ladd</span> (1902) is a novel set in New England during the American War of Independence. <span class="italic">In the Morning of Time</span> (1919) concerns the evolution of prehistoric man. In a long and versatile career Roberts also produced collections of boys' stories, travel guides, and historical works, including a translation of Philippe Aubert de Gasp&eacute;'s <span class="italic">Les anciens canadiens</span> (<span class="italic">The Canadians of Old: an Historical Romance</span>, 1890) and <span class="italic">A History of Canada</span> (1897).<br>
<br>Roberts was elected to the Royal Society of Canada in 1890; became a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1893; received the Royal Society of Canada's gold medal for literature in 1926; became national president of the Canadian Authors' Association in 1927; and was knighted in 1935.<br>
<br>Charles and May Roberts had three sons and a daughter but from 1896 they ceased to live together for any length of time; May died in 1930. For much of his adult life he was plagued by debt but with the help of Lorne Pierce, the publisher and scholar, he received an annual government pension in 1935. His distinguished appearance&#151;medium height, rugged features, athletic build, and cheerful disposition, endeared him to his colleagues and to several women with whom he became romantically involved.<br>
<br>As co-editor of <span class="italic">A Standard Dictionary of Canadian Biography: the Canadian Who Was Who</span> (2 vols., 1934&#150;8), he employed the assistance of Joan Montgomery. They were married on 18 October 1943, he aged eighty-three and she thirty-three. Roberts died shortly afterwards, in Toronto, on 26 November 1943.<br>
