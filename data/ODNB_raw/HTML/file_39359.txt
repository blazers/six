<span class="headword">McLeod,  Herbert</span>  (1841&#150;1923), <span class="occ">chemist and bibliographer</span>, was born on 19 February 1841 in Stamford Hill, north London, the eldest child of Bentley McLeod (1808&#150;1870), brewer, and Louisa Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cristall (1811&#150;1901). McLeod received his initial education at Stockwell grammar school and at a private school in Deal, to where the family had moved in 1853. In 1855 he went to the (short-lived) Panopticon in Leicester Square, London, where he studied chemistry under George Frederick Ansell. The following year he entered the Royal College of Chemistry, London, to study under August Hofmann. In 1858 he became a junior assistant in the college, and in 1860 assistant chemist. In 1865 Hofmann was appointed professor of chemistry at Berlin. McLeod served as his assistant there during his first semester before returning to the Royal College of Chemistry as assistant to Hofmann's replacement, Edward Frankland. In 1871 McLeod was appointed professor of experimental science at the Royal Indian Engineering College at Coopers Hill, a post which he held (later as professor of chemistry) until his retirement in 1901. In 1888 he married Amelia Sarah (Minnie) Woodley (1862&#150;1945); they had three sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>McLeod was elected a fellow of the Chemical Society in 1868, served on its council from 1871 to 1874 and again from 1880 to 1884, and was vice-president from 1887 to 1890 and from 1901 to 1904. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1881 and was on the council from 1887 to 1889. He was president of the chemistry section of the British Association in 1892. He received an honorary degree of LLD from St Andrews University in 1907.<br>
<br>As a chemist, McLeod's chief contribution was the invention in 1874 of an instrument for measuring very low pressures on an absolute scale; the &#145;McLeod gauge&#146; is still a standard part of the equipment in chemistry and physics laboratories. In 1878, with George Sydenham Clarke, he devised an instrument for determining the speed of machines. In 1880 he showed that ozone was formed in the slow oxidation of phosphorus in air, and in 1884 he invented a sunshine recorder using ferrocyanide paper. From 1888 McLeod read the proofs of the Royal Society's <span class="italic">Catalogue of Scientific Papers</span>, published in the nineteenth century, and from 1902 to 1915 he undertook the direction of this catalogue, giving the later volumes an accuracy not achieved earlier.<br>
<br>McLeod was devoutly religious throughout his life, belonging to the Anglo-Catholic wing of the Church of England. As Alexander Taylor, his chief at Coopers Hill, expressed it, McLeod was &#145;A High Churchman and a Tory, and, in all paths of life, a follower of the most orthodox of the strictest sects of orthodoxy&#146;  (A. C. Taylor, <span class="italic">General Sir Alex Taylor</span>, 1913, 2.257). He was thus deeply disturbed at the way in which science (which was, after all, his profession) and religion were beginning to be placed by some in opposition to each other. Especially problematic in the mid-1860s was the outcome of the trials of some of the contributors to <span class="italic">Essays and Reviews</span> (1860) and of Bishop Colenso, which demonstrated that the Anglican church had very little power over what its members believed. The writings both of the essayists and of Colenso did contain some arguments drawn from modern science, the existence of which prompted McLeod and a few others at the Royal College of Chemistry in 1864 to write and promulgate <span class="italic">The Declaration of Students of the Natural and Physical Sciences</span>. This asserted &#145;that it is impossible for the Word of God, as written in the book of nature, and God's Word written in <span class="roman">Holy Scripture</span>, to contradict one another, however much they may appear to differ&#146;. The <span class="italic">Declaration</span> was circulated throughout the British scientific community and when it was published in May 1865 it had been signed by 717 individuals or about 15 per cent of the community, including sixty-six fellows of the Royal Society (11.1 per cent of the fellowship). The <span class="italic">Declaration</span> attracted strong criticism from some leaders of the scientific community, including Charles Daubeny, John Herschel, William Rowan Hamilton, and Augustus De Morgan. Although the <span class="italic">Declaration</span> has ever since been used as evidence that science and religion are not necessarily in conflict, McLeod, disliking controversy entirely, played down his role in its creation, and indeed none of his obituary notices refers to it.<br>
<br>McLeod died of cerebral thrombosis, at his home, 109 Church Road, Richmond, Surrey, on 1 October 1923. The most meticulous of men, as his chemical and bibliographical work illustrate, he kept a daily diary from the first day of 1860 until he went into a coma three days before his death; it ran to 174 volumes. All commentators agree that he was a clear lecturer who spent much effort in devising lecture demonstrations. Although not a great chemist in the way that Thomas Graham or William Crookes were, nevertheless McLeod's career is representative of the emergence of the chemical profession in the second half of the nineteenth century.<br>
