<span class="headword">Seldon,  Arthur</span>  (1916&#150;2005), <span class="occ">economist</span>, was born on 29 May 1916 in London's East End, the son of Pinchas Margolis, merchant, and his wife, Masha. He was orphaned at the age of two when his parents, Russian Jewish immigrants, both died in the outbreak of Spanish flu in 1918. He was adopted by a cobbler and his wife, Mark and Eva Slabadain (later Anglicized to Seldon), also Russian Jewish immigrants. He was educated at Dempsey Street elementary school, Stepney, and Raines Foundation Grammar School. In 1934 he won a scholarship to the London School of Economics to read economics. Following a brief flirtation with the Fabian side of the school, he came under the influence of the classical liberal economists Lionel Robbins and F. A. Hayek. Small, slightly built, and cursed with a stammer, the young Seldon threw himself into his studies. He graduated with a first in 1937 and then became a research assistant to the economist Arnold Plant. Under the influence of these mentors he was converted to the merits of competitive markets, the rule of law, secure property rights, personal independence, and limited government. These values guided him for the rest of his life. He joined with others to found a student Liberal society. Following war service with the army in Africa and Italy, between 1942 and 1945, he became a tutor for the University of London Commerce Degree Bureau (1946&#150;56), editor of <span class="italic">Store</span> (1946&#150;9), and an economic adviser to the brewing industry. On 23 February 1948 he married the widowed (Audrey) Marjorie Perrott (1919&#150;2014), journalist, and daughter of Lieutenant Wilford Willett, an officer in the London rifle brigade. They had three sons.<br>
<br>In January 1957 Seldon first met Ralph Harris, then director and sole employee of the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA). Antony Fisher, a farmer, had established the IEA in 1955 from the profits of his Buxted Chicken Company. It was founded as &#145;a research and educational trust&#146;; later it would be described as a think-tank. Seldon co-wrote the first IEA pamphlet, <span class="italic">Pensions and a Free Society</span> (1957), arguing the case for personal private pensions. The two men soon began a remarkable thirty-year collaboration. Harris was the public face of the IEA, a skilful networker and fund-raiser. Seldon, retiring but blessed with a fluent writing style, great energy, and tenacity, was soon made editorial director, a post he held until 1981, when he became consultant director until 1988. The two men challenged the post-1948 collectivist Keynesian assumptions about economic policy shared by leading politicians in both the Labour and Conservative parties. Seldon sought out authors, suggesting topics and badgering them to develop early drafts and to push inchoate ideas to a bold conclusion. He was fond of urging them to ignore warnings that their conclusions might be thought administratively impracticable or &#145;politically impossible&#146;. His watchword was &#145;think the unthinkable&#146;.<br>
<br>The IEA emphasized the importance of the pricing mechanism as a means of allocating resources, discovering alternative ways of providing services, and making comparisons between different goods and producers. It therefore opposed the state provision of &#145;free&#146; public services, notably in health and education. It also promoted ideas from abroad (including a public choice school based in the University of Virginia, which argued that interest groups often shaped government policy and that interventions by vote-seeking politicians were often against the public interest) and the monetarist views of Milton Friedman and Hayek; the last two, both Nobel laureates, were IEA authors. It organized lectures and seminars and provided a congenial base for Friedman and Hayek's visits to the UK. Seldon's talent, apart from finding and marrying authors and topics, was in getting people to write in an accessible and jargon-free style and in using IEA media contacts to promote their ideas.<br>
<br>In contrast to some think-tanks, the IEA was more concerned to address the public than politicians. Seldon and Harris believed it was more effective to work indirectly, shaping the climate of opinion, which in turn would influence politicians. Although they provided encouragement for Margaret Thatcher's brand of Conservatism, Seldon in particular was concerned that the IEA should keep its distance from any political party. The IEA's publications successfully urged the case for privatization, the contracting out of services, deregulation, greater autonomy for schools (though it failed with school vouchers), trade-union reforms, an independent university, and student loans. The policy suggestions were designed to empower people, particularly the less well-off; why should the power to choose be confined to the wealthy? Producers and bureaucrats dominated the welfare state. Greater competition and consumer choice, and charging for services, were means of making public services more responsive to the public. The open market could be even more democratic than elections. The cash register operated as a referendum all day and every day.<br>
<br>Seldon was a prolific writer, although his skills were perhaps best demonstrated as a probing and sympathetic editor. Several of his twenty-eight books and over 200 articles were co-written or edited. The books, pamphlets, and collections of essays restated his commitment to the free society, the benefits of free markets and personal choice, and the negative effects of government intervention. They included <span class="italic">Corrigible Capitalism, Incorrigible Socialism</span> (1980), <span class="italic">Wither the Welfare State</span> (1981), <span class="italic">Socialism Explained</span> (1983), <span class="italic">The New Right Enlightenment</span> (1985), and <span class="italic">The Riddle of the Voucher</span> (1986). In retirement he also wrote <span class="italic">Capitalism</span> (1990), <span class="italic">The Dilemma of Democracy</span> (1998), and <span class="italic">The Retreat of the State</span> (1998). Colin Robinson, his successor as the IEA's editor, edited his collected works in seven volumes which were published by the Liberty Fund in 2004&#150;5. Seldon was made a founder president of the IEA in 1990. He was also a founder trustee of the Social Affairs Unit, a vice-president of the Mont Pelerin Society, and an honorary fellow of the London School of Economics. He was appointed CBE in 1983. He died of cancer of the prostate at his home, Thatched Cottage, Godden Green, Sevenoaks, Kent, on 11 October 2005. His wife and their three sons survived him.<br>
