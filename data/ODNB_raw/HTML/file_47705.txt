<span class="headword">Peat, Sir  William Barclay</span>  (1852&#150;1936), <span class="occ">accountant</span>, was born in Forebank St Cyrus, Kincardine, Scotland, on 15 February 1852, second son of James Peat, a farmer, and Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Barclay. Following his education at Montrose Academy, he became an indentured apprentice to a solicitor in Montrose. For reasons unknown, he abandoned the study of Scottish law and in 1870 moved to London where he was employed as a junior clerk by Robert Fletcher, a distinguished public accountant who had connections with railways, insurance companies, and also industrial undertakings, particularly in the iron industry. On 29 December 1873 Peat married Edith (<i>d</i>. 1929), daughter of Henry Roberts, a solicitor of Usk in Monmouthshire; they had six children. In 1876 Peat moved to the Middlesbrough office of Robert Fletcher &amp; Co., and was admitted a partner of the firm in the following year. On Fletcher's death in 1883, the firm's name became R. Mackay &amp; Co. In 1891 Roderick Mackay died in Monte Carlo, leaving behind substantial private debts. Peat immediately returned to London to take charge of the office there and to make sure that Mackay's debts were settled. The name of the partnership, comprising four members, was changed to W. B. Peat &amp; Co. Three of Peat's children, Sir Harry, Roderick, and Charles, later became partners in the firm.<br>
<br>Under Peat's leadership the firm flourished, particularly through audit work. Peat or his firm acted as auditors for many banks and railway companies, and especially iron and steel organizations in the north of England. He was also appointed the auditor of the private accounts of the sovereign. In 1911, Peat met James Marwick, a Scottish chartered accountant practising in North America, while travelling to New York on the <i>Berengaria</i>. By the voyage's end, the two had agreed to a merger, the formal agreement for which was signed on 1 October 1911. The merged firm became Marwick, Mitchell, Peat &amp; Co. in the USA, Canada, and France, while the UK firm remained as W. B. Peat &amp; Co. until 1925 when the name Peat, Marwick, Mitchell &amp; Co. was adopted for the UK, continental Europe, and North America. Peat retired in 1923 after thirty-two years as senior partner. During his active professional life, he engaged in insolvency work and also advised on many amalgamations in the iron and steel industry. He also served the industry as secretary of the National Federation of Iron and Steel Manufacturers during 1918&#150;25.<br>
<br>Peat was a pioneer of the organized accountancy profession in Britain, and an important figure in its development. He joined the Institute of Accountants in 1879 as an associate. The following year he became a foundation member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW), joined its council in 1894, and served as president during 1906&#150;8 in a total of thirty-seven years' service as a councillor. He was a most generous donor to the Chartered Accountants Benevolent Association, over which he presided for twenty years, and also gave generously in prizes awarded for ICAEW examinations.<br>
<br>Peat's public activities were many, including engagements on various government departmental committees. He was chairman of the royal commission on agriculture, 1919&#150;20, sat on the royal commission on food prices, served as chairman of the subcommittee on night baking, and was a member of the Voluntary Hospitals Committee. He received a number of honours, including chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur. He was knighted in 1912, and created CVO in 1921.<br>
<br>Sir William Barclay Peat died at his residence, Wykeham Rise, Totteridge, Hertfordshire, on 24 January 1936, and was buried at Totteridge church three days later. His obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span> stated that Peat &#145;owed his success to a robust constitution, indefatigable energy, and a capacity to form shrewd and penetrating judgements&#146;. The firm which Peat led continued to expand through internal growth and merger.<br>
