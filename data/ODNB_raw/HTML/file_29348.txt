<span class="headword">Wickens, Sir  John</span>  (1815&#150;1873), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 13 June 1815, the second son of James Stephen Wickens, solicitor, of Chandos Street, Cavendish Square, London, and his wife, Anne, daughter of John Hayter of Winterbourne Stoke, Wiltshire. Educated under Dr Keate at Eton College (1829&#150;32), where he won the Newcastle scholarship, he went on to win an open scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford, and matriculated there on 30 November 1832. He graduated BA in Michaelmas term 1836 with a double first in classics and mathematics (though, despite statements to the contrary, he did not win the Newdigate prize), and took his MA in 1839. He was unsuccessful as a candidate for a Balliol fellowship, however, and this was variously attributed to an ill-timed display of his wit and to his smoking having annoyed the master.<br>
<br>Wickens was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 27 April 1837, and was called to the bar in May 1840. His practice grew slowly, but he gained a reputation as a conveyancer, a draftsman of equity pleadings, and an opinion writer. When in 1852 a number of leading juniors took silk as a result of procedural reform in the court of chancery, Wickens became one of the most distinguished juniors at the chancery bar. He was retained in most of the heavy chancery suits of the day, and appeared frequently before the House of Lords and the privy council. He was not a fluent speaker, but had a trenchant and concise way of arguing a point. From January 1843 until his appointment to the bench he was junior equity counsel to the Treasury. His own modesty apart, this appointment prevented him applying to become queen's counsel, and disqualified him from being a parliamentary candidate. In 1845 Wickens married Harriet Frances, daughter of William Davey of Cowley House, Gloucestershire. Their daughter Mary married George Farwell, who became a lord justice of appeal.<br>
<br>In 1868 Wickens became vice-chancellor of the county palatine of Lancaster in succession to Sir William James who became a vice-chancellor. In 1871 Wickens was elected a bencher of his inn, and on 18 April of the same year was appointed to the bench as a vice-chancellor in succession to Sir John Stuart. He was knighted on 29 June 1871. It was said that as a judge he went too slowly and was too much under the influence of precedent, following co-ordinate precedents even if he thought them wrong. But, as his obituary in the <span class="italic">Solicitors' Journal</span> noted, &#145;he understood law&#146;, and brought to his work a conscientious thoroughness and an intimate knowledge of practice. His judgments contained lucid statements of principle, and masterly applications of principle to new cases. His decisions, rarely appealed from, were even more rarely reversed; an appellate position would have made his ability more conspicuous. Apart from the law, he was known for his wit and humour, his general learning, and the brilliancy and interest of his conversation.<br>
<br>Wickens died at his home at Chilgrove, Westdean, near Chichester, in Sussex, on 23 October 1873.<br>
