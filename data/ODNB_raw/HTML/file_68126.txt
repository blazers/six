<span class="headword">Scott <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Howard; <em>other married name </em>Wyndham]</span>,  Mary</span>, countess of Deloraine  (<em>bap. </em>1703, <em>d.</em> 1744), <span class="occ">courtier and royal mistress</span>, was baptized at Winchester Cathedral, Hampshire, on 28 February 1703, the daughter of Charles Howard (<i>b</i>. 1681), a naval officer, and his wife, Elizabeth Batten. Her father was a grandson of Thomas Howard, first earl of Berkshire, and a great-grandson of Thomas Howard, first earl of Suffolk. By 1723 she had become a maid of honour to Caroline, princess of Wales. She lost that post when, on 14 March 1726, she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24874/', "Henry Scott, first earl of Deloraine (1676&#150;1730)")</script>. They had two daughters, Georgia Caroline (<i>bap</i>. 1727), who married Sir James Peachey, master of the robes, and Elizabeth Henrietta (<i>bap</i>. 1729). At the time of their marriage her husband was lord of the bedchamber to George Augustus, prince of Wales [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10539/', "George II (1683&#150;1760)")</script>], and he continued in the prince's service as a gentleman of the bedchamber when the prince became king. It was probably following her husband's death that she was appointed governess to the king's youngest daughters, Mary and Louisa. She held the post on the condition that she did not marry again, but through negotiations with Queen Caroline and the older princesses, in April 1734 she was allowed to marry William Wyndham (<i>d</i>. 1743), of Ersham, Norfolk, eldest son of Colonel Thomas Wyndham. Wyndham was deputy governor to George II's youngest son, William Augustus, duke of Cumberland, and had formerly been the governor of Chelsea Hospital.<br>
<br>Lady Deloraine's likeness appears in William Hogarth's conversation piece <span class="italic">A Performance of &#145;The Indian Emperor, or, The Conquest of Mexico by the Spaniards&#146;</span> (1732&#150;5). She is depicted leaning forward, encouraging one of her children to pick up a fallen fan during a children's performance of John Dryden's play, at the home of John Conduitt, master of the Royal Mint. Her royal charges, Mary and Louisa, stand near her in front of the fireplace. Hogarth's intention may have been to suggest &#145;the tangle of passion, conquest and deception&#146;  (Uglow, 170) that the children in the painting will encounter in adult life. This tangle was evident in Lady Deloraine's career. For example, the nineteenth-century anecdotist, William Drogo Montagu, seventh duke of Manchester, repeated gossip that the countess of Deloraine, whom he described as the &#145;King's Concubine&#146;  (Manchester, 2.330), had poisoned Queen Caroline's maid of honour Mary McKenzie. The motive appears to have been jealousy as a Mr Price, for whom the countess was said to entertain a &#145;tendre&#146;, was in love with McKenzie. According to Manchester, McKenzie recovered and, the day before her marriage to Price, was persuaded by Queen Caroline to meet the countess at supper, as public proof either of the countess's innocence or of Mary's forgiveness of her.<br>
<br>In 1735 George II boasted to Lord Hervey that he had seduced Lady Deloraine the winter before, prompting Hervey to note that the king had made &#145;the governess of his two youngest daughters his whore and the guardian-director of his son's youth and morals his cuckold&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hervey's Memoirs</span>, 196). Lady Deloraine does not seem to have become a serious contender for the king's affections until the summer of 1737, when the king had become separated from his recognized mistress, Amalie von Wallmoden, who was living in Hanover. Then, she was denying to Charlotte Clayton, Lady Sundon, among others, that she had bowed to royal demands and was hinting to prime minister Sir Robert Walpole that if she did consent, she would be well paid for it. None the less, Hervey reported it as common knowledge that the king was &#145;tasting all the pleasures with Lady Deloraine which she was capable of bestowing&#146;  (ibid., 195). He noted that when Walpole questioned the paternity of her son, she teased that it was her husband's &#145;but I will not promise whose the next shall be&#146;  (ibid., 196). Walpole feared that with &#145;a lying tongue and a false heart&#146;  (Hardy, 84) Lady Deloraine might exert political influence: she had already boasted that she alone had kept the king from travelling abroad when the pleas of Walpole and the queen had failed.<br>
<br>Hervey recognized that she was politically harmless, regarding her as a vain and simple woman with a &#145;wretched head&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hervey's Memoirs</span>, 196). Following the death of Queen Caroline in November 1737, some ministers thought that Lady Deloraine could be used to help them influence the king as the queen had done, but both Walpole and Hervey recognized that the king regarded Lady Deloraine as a sexual conquest rather than companion, and Walpole arranged for Amalie von Wallmoden to be brought over from Hanover. Lady Deloraine, who had never been regarded highly by the princesses, was eclipsed as a royal favourite. She died in London on 12 November 1744 and was buried at Windsor. She left &pound;8000 capital bank stock in trust for her daughters; her son with William Wyndham is not mentioned in the will, and must have predeceased her.<br>
