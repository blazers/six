<span class="headword">Lambert,  James</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1725, <em>d.</em> 1788), <span class="occ">watercolour painter and topographical artist</span>, was baptized on 29 December 1725 at Willingdon, near Eastbourne, Sussex, the youngest of the eight children of John Lambert (1690&#150;1764), a flax dresser, and his wife, Susan Bray (1687&#150;1771), daughter of Thomas Bray of Chiddingly, Sussex. About 1730 the family moved to the Cliffe, a suburb of Lewes, Sussex, where Lambert lived for the rest of his life. He attended a common writing-school and later received instruction from a music-master. From 1745 until his death he served as the parish organist, publishing volumes of psalms (1756) and hymns (2nd edn, 1774) and teaching music at least from 1756 until 1758. By 1754 he was in business as a sign painter and gilder and by 1758 as a stationer.<br>
<br>Lambert's ambition was to be a landscape painter. He probably received instruction from a distant relative, George Smith (<i>c</i>.1714&#150;1776), of Chichester, perhaps after his marriage on 29 April 1760 at Stopham, Sussex, to Mary Winton (1736&#150;1810), daughter of Francis Winton of Sompting, Sussex, a farmer. (Their one child died in infancy.) He exhibited at the Free Society of Artists between 1768 and 1773 and at the Royal Academy between 1774 and 1778. His pictures combined elements both of Claudean pastoral and of Dutch picturesque rustic imagery; some featured sheep and cattle prominently. For one such the Society of Arts awarded him a premium of 15 guineas in 1770. About 1776, William Groombridge was his pupil in landscape painting.<br>
<br>More remunerative, from about 1772, was Lambert's quick response to the rising demand for topographical watercolours, with the assistance of his less talented nephew James Lambert (1741&#150;1799). While local gentry commissioned views of their houses, John Elliot (1724&#150;1782) requested images of Lewes's antiquities and Jasper Sprange views for engravings in his <span class="italic">Tunbridge Wells Guide</span> (1786); visitors ordered copies from Lambert's shop stock. His largest client was Dr William Burrell (1732&#150;1796), for whom he worked between 1776 and 1784 and who bequeathed to the British Museum in London 269 watercolours, mainly of medieval buildings, by the two Lamberts. The Sussex Archaeological Society also has many of the Lamberts' works. Those pictures entirely by the elder Lambert are competent but uninspired compositions.<br>
<br>The elder James Lambert died, probably in the parish of St Thomas-at-Cliffe, on 7 December 1788 in straitened circumstances, administration of his estate being granted to creditors. He was buried on 19 December at St John-sub-Castro Church, Lewes. He was survived by his wife. His natural diffidence and taciturnity had held him back from the London art world beyond the exhibitions, but in eastern Sussex he was the first painter to be an artist rather than solely an artisan.<br>
