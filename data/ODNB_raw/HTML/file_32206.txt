<span class="headword">Butler,  Arthur Gray</span>  (1831&#150;1909), <span class="occ">headmaster</span>, born at Gayton rectory, Northamptonshire, on 19 August 1831, was the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4183/', "George Butler")</script>, dean of Peterborough, and his wife, Sarah Maria, eldest daughter of John Gray of Wembley Park, Middlesex. After attending Eagle House at Hammersmith, he entered Rugby School under A. C. Tait in August 1844. In a novel <span class="italic">The Three Friends</span> (1900), Butler later described school life there, recording friendships between Matthew Arnold, A. H. Clough, and Theodore Walrond, and the effect produced on his Rugby contemporaries by the early poems of Tennyson. At school and college he was distinguished in both work and games, and Butler's Leap at Rugby commemorates a youthful athletic feat.<br>
<br>In March 1850 Butler was admitted as a scholar of University College, Oxford. At Oxford he was an original member of the Essay Club founded in 1852 by his friend G. J. Goschen, and was president of the union in 1853. In the same year he won the Ireland scholarship, and graduated BA with a first class in the final classical school. He was elected a fellow of Oriel in 1856, proceeding MA in the following year. Like his brothers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4184/', "George Butler")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32213/', "Henry Montagu Butler")</script>, he became a schoolmaster, returning to Rugby in 1858 as assistant master under Frederick Temple. He was ordained deacon in 1861 and priest in 1862.<br>
<br>On the reconstitution of Haileybury College in 1862 Butler was appointed the first headmaster. In September the school took over the buildings of the East India Company's college near Hertford, which had been founded in 1805 for the training of its civil servants. Haileybury had no endowment, and from the outset Butler was hampered by inconvenient buildings and lack of modern appliances. Nevertheless he set himself to infuse into the school something of the strenuous vitality of the Rugby system, appointing Rugby men as masters and introducing the Rugby football game, which was made compulsory. He himself served as chaplain. He provided racquet and fives courts. He encouraged the growth of corporate spirit in the dormitories, with which he replaced the existing study bedrooms, and maintained the continuity of associations by naming the various houses after prominent Anglo-Indian civilians. Pupil numbers rose rapidly in a few years from 54 to 360. Butler's attractive personality, his enthusiasm, his eloquence, and thoroughness exercised a considerable influence over boys and masters. He was a stimulating classical teacher, and had the faculty of throwing new light on familiar passages. A nervous breakdown caused by overwork compelled his resignation in December 1867. He had by then raised Haileybury to a recognized place among the leading English public schools.<br>
<br>On resuming work in 1874 Butler served as chaplain of the Royal Indian Civil Engineering College at Coopers Hill near Egham. Returning to Oxford in 1875, he settled down to the more congenial duties of dean and tutor of Oriel, where his pupils included Cecil Rhodes. On 4 April 1877 he married Harriet Jessie, who was twenty years his junior, daughter of Michael Pakenham Edgeworth and niece of Maria Edgeworth. Re-election to his fellowship in October 1877 confirmed his place among the first generation of married dons at Oxford. He was disappointed to be passed over for the provostship in 1882; an anti-clerical sentiment among the governing body favoured D. B. Monro, a layman. After resigning his official position at Oriel in 1895 he maintained close relations with his college and was elected to an honorary fellowship in 1907. It was partly owing to his suggestions that both Oriel and Oxford benefited by the will of Cecil Rhodes.<br>
<br>Although not a productive scholar in the narrow academic sense, Butler cherished strong literary instincts, which found expression mainly in verse. He published two dramas, <span class="italic">Charles I</span> (1874; 2nd edn, 1907) and <span class="italic">Harold</span> (1892; 2nd edn, 1906), and two volumes of poetry entitled <span class="italic">The Choice of Achilles</span> (1900) and <span class="italic">Hodge and the Land</span> (1907). The latter reflected a long-standing interest in land reform. A broad-churchman in religion, and a lifelong friend of A. P. Stanley, Butler was a liberal in politics, though, like his friends from the Essay Club, Goschen and G. C. Brodrick, his opposition to Irish home rule led him into Liberal Unionism. In Oxford he was a supporter of women's education, and of social causes such as the housing of the poor. He and his wife were active in the Oxford Cottage Improvement Society.<br>
<br>Butler died at GlenFinnan, Belgrave Road, Torquay on 16 January 1909, and was buried in Holywell cemetery, Oxford. He left one son, Harold Edgeworth Butler (1878&#150;1951), professor of Latin at London University, and three daughters, Olive Harriet Edgeworth Butler (1879&#150;1951), warden of Lady Margaret Hall Settlement in Lambeth; Ruth Florence Butler (1881&#150;1982), tutor in history and vice-principal of the Society of Oxford Home Students; and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37250/', "(Christina) Violet Butler (1884&#150;1982)")</script>, tutor in economics to the Society of Oxford Home Students.<br>
