<span class="headword">Holland <span class="st"> [Holand]</span>,  John</span>, first duke of Exeter  (1395&#150;1447), <span class="occ">soldier and magnate</span>, was born on 29 March 1395, at Dartington, Devon, the second son (his elder brother died in 1400) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13529/', "John Holland, duke of Exeter (c.1352&#150;1400)")</script>, who was Richard II's half-brother, and Elizabeth of Lancaster (<i>d</i>. 1425), Henry IV's sister. His father was executed and attainted for plotting against Henry IV. The younger John was brought up by his mother and her second husband (whom she married in 1400), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54423/', "Sir John Cornewall (d. 1443)")</script>, a dashing knight who served Prince Henry; in 1407 the king gave Cornewall 100 marks a year for the boy's maintenance. Holland was knighted in April 1413, on the eve of Henry V's coronation, and the new king appreciated his military potential, for he was &#145;brave and high spirited though young&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gesta Henrici quinti</span>, 46&#150;7). He spent a lifetime in the French war, but captivity in France between 1421 and 1426 and the Lancastrians' unwillingness to endow him with substantial estates prejudiced his financial security.<br>
<br>Just before Henry V's departure for France in 1415, Holland sat on the tribunal that condemned the &#145;Southampton&#146; plotters, including his own kinsman, Richard, earl of Cambridge. He accompanied the king to Normandy and, with his stepfather, led a force to reconnoitre Harfleur; at Agincourt on 25 October he was distinguished for his valour. He was elected to the Order of the Garter in May 1416, and in July became commander of the fleet to relieve Harfleur and patrol the seas. Holland had begun to style himself earl of Huntingdon, his father's title, earlier in 1416, and formal restoration came in parliament in October; yet he did not receive his father's dukedom of Exeter, which was pointedly granted to the king's uncle, Thomas Beaufort. Livery of his inheritance in the following March included only entailed estates. As a result, he did not enjoy his father's close links with Devon, and his resources were an inadequate foundation for his military career.<br>
<br>While commanding the fleet (ironically under Exeter as admiral), on 29 June 1417 Huntingdon captured Genoese ships, prisoners, and treasure, in an engagement off the Caux peninsula that was admired by contemporary chroniclers. This heralded Henry V's invasion of Normandy in which Huntingdon took the castle of Touques and besieged Caen; in the spring of 1418 he seized Coutances, Avranches, and other fortresses. He rejoined Henry V at the siege of Rouen (1418&#150;19), where his brother, Edward Holland, was killed. He was accomplished alike in the field (as at Fresnay in March 1420) and at sieges, and his stepfather was usually at his side. Henry V rewarded him, notably in 1418 with the lordship of Bricqueville-sur-Mer, which he had subdued; in 1419 he was appointed captain of Gournay and Pontoise, and when Melun fell in November 1420 he became its governor. Following the treaty of Troyes (21 May 1420), Henry V made him constable of the Tower of London for life, with an annuity of &pound;100 (20 August). Huntingdon entered Paris on 1 December with the two royal families: he was appointed captain of Vincennes and custodian of the infirm Charles VI.<br>
<br>Within months Huntingdon's fortunes had collapsed. He was captured at the battle of Baug&eacute; on 22 March 1421 and found himself the prisoner of a Scot, Sir John Sibbald; he spent five years in captivity in Anjou. Raising a ransom was his daunting priority: he was not well endowed with estates and parliament was told in 1424 that he was owed &pound;10,500 from Henry V's day. His stepfather eventually negotiated, in 1425, an exchange with the count of Vend&ocirc;me (captured at Agincourt and in Sir John Cornewall's hands), and Huntingdon returned to England by the beginning of 1426. He later claimed that his captivity cost him 20,000 marks.<br>
<br>Huntingdon's priorities on his return were to repair his fortunes; he also became a king's councillor in March 1426 and an ally of Humphrey, duke of Gloucester. In seeking a wife, a dowager would be more immediately profitable than a young heiress: by 15 July 1427 he had married Anne, daughter of Edmund Stafford, earl of Stafford, and widow of Edmund (V) Mortimer, earl of March (<i>d</i>. 1425), though he was fined 1200 marks for doing so without licence. After his mother's death in 1425 he inherited much of her property, and the king granted him the Norman county of Ivry in 1427. His place in noble society was less comfortable, for he may have quarrelled with the duke of Norfolk in 1428, and with his own brother-in-law, the earl of Stafford, when both came armed to parliament in 1429; he was one of several nobles requested to leave their large retinues at home when attending the parliament of 1430.<br>
<br>When Henry VI visited France in April 1430, Huntingdon accompanied him: he joined the duke of Burgundy at the siege of Compi&egrave;gne but withdrew through lack of funds, and then, as captain of Gournay and Gisors, supported Bedford. At Paris he witnessed Henry's crowning as king of France in December 1431. During his absence from England, his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50223/', "Henry Holland")</script> was born in June 1430, but in September 1432 Anne Stafford died. Huntingdon quickly sought a new wife, and it is not surprising that he chose another dowager: in January 1433, on payment of 200 marks, he married Beatrice, illegitimate daughter of Jo&atilde;o I, king of Portugal and widow of Thomas Fitzalan, earl of Arundel (<i>d</i>. 1415).<br>
<br>With his affairs in fair order, Huntingdon resumed his military career, though it required 1300 marks in recognition of past services to persuade him to go to France in 1433; he displayed his usual flair and relieved Montargis. At the discussions with France and Burgundy at Arras in the summer of 1435, Huntingdon was an English envoy&#151;a noble of repute and royal lineage rather than an experienced diplomat. A licence to take with him household goods worth &pound;6000 reflected lavish tastes, which are confirmed by his will and an inventory of his possessions made after his death  (Westminster Abbey muniments, 6643). Just before leaving for Arras, in July 1435 he and the earl of Northumberland were jointly appointed wardens of the east and west marches towards Scotland after the earl of Salisbury resigned as western warden. On his return he received the office of admiral of England on 2 October, and so helped to defend Calais against the Burgundians in August 1436.<br>
<br>After Henry VI came of age (1436&#150;7), Huntingdon, like Gloucester, was eased out of the king's counsels, though his other services were still valued. In March 1439 he was appointed the king's lieutenant in Aquitaine for six years; &pound;1000 was paid to him personally before he would sail for Bordeaux, accompanied by his wife, in August. He did not stay long, possibly because of inadequate resources: his own situation worsened after Beatrice's death at Bordeaux on 23 October 1439, although he was granted the wine-producing lordship of Lesparre in February 1440. After returning to England in December 1440 he sought an annual allowance, and in July 1441 was given 500 marks per annum in tail male to compensate for losses in France. At the same time, he was caught up in the Gloucester&#150;Beaufort feud, perhaps as a king's councillor once again, and he sat in judgment on the duchess of Gloucester when she was charged with sorcery. His abilities in defence of the realm continued to be acknowledged: in November 1441 he received custody of Southampton Castle for life. He also found yet another wife, Anne Montagu (<i>d</i>. 1457), daughter of the earl of Salisbury and twice widowed. The king's grant of the royal manor of Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, for life in December 1443 may have signalled Henry VI's affection for one of his closest male relatives and reliable commanders; it certainly brought him closer to the court, and on 6 January 1444 John Holland was created duke of Exeter, with precedence next to the duke of York. In 1445 he arranged that his son Henry should marry York's daughter, Anne, and York was prepared to offer a large dowry. The new duke's health may have been failing by 1446, for in February he associated his son with him as admiral, and then, a year later, as constable of the Tower. Exeter died on 5 August 1447 and was buried at St Katharine by the Tower, alongside his first wife and his sister Constance (<i>d</i>. 1437), the countess marshal.<br>
<br>John Holland's finances were precarious: his taxable income in 1436 was almost the lowest among the earls (a little over &pound;1000 per annum). Three widows' dower estates were welcome, but they were hardly the basis for a sustained landed interest, and he never identified closely with the west country. His military reputation was high, despite his capture, and his royal blood was increasingly valued by Henry VI; but his political influence at court seems to have been modest.<br>
