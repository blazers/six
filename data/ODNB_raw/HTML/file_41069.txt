<span class="headword">Stanley <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Montagu]</span>,  (Beatrice) Venetia</span>  (1887&#150;1948), <span class="occ">prime minister's confidante</span>, was born at Easthorpe, Malton, North Riding of Yorkshire, on 22 August 1887, the youngest of the seven children to survive to adulthood of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36244/', "Edward Lyulph Stanley (1839&#150;1925)")</script>, educationist, who succeeded as fourth Baron Stanley of Alderley in 1903 and as fourth Baron Sheffield in 1909, and his wife, Mary Katharine (1848&#150;1929), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30690/', "Sir Isaac Lowthian Bell, baronet")</script>, industrial pioneer, of Washington, co. Durham, and his wife, Margaret.<br>
<br>Venetia Stanley had impeccably Liberal credentials, and she was a close friend of H. H. Asquith's elder daughter, Violet. Asquith was often credited, as he wrote in March 1915, with &#145;a slight weakness for the companionship of clever and attractive women&#146;, and by 1907 Venetia had been enrolled in what his wife, Margot, called his &#145;little harem&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters to Venetia Stanley</span>, 471, 1). She came with Violet to some of Asquith's meetings during the second 1910 election, and the two of them joined him and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35074/', "Edwin Samuel Montagu (1879&#150;1924)")</script> during a Sicilian holiday in January 1912. A few weeks after that Venetia was with him one Sunday morning, as he later recorded, when &#145;the scales dropped from my eyes &hellip; and I dimly felt &hellip; that I had come to a turning point in my life&#146;  (ibid., 532). Letter writing was one of Asquith's recreations. His letters to Venetia became more frequent, and he contrived to meet her when she was in London. Although, unlike an earlier Venetia Stanley (1600&#150;1633), she had few pretensions to beauty, she was superbly equipped to be what Violet called the premier's &#145;companion in brightness&#146;&#151;intelligent, sympathetic, and fond of fun  (ibid., 6). She showed no great anxiety to marry and settle down.<br>
<br>In December 1913, as the wrangle on the naval estimates began and the long-awaited home rule crisis neared, Asquith came to discuss politics with Venetia and to discover how much they interested her. During the next sixteen months she heard from him or read a great many political and war secrets, and remained, as far as is known, completely discreet about them all. On 27 January 1914 part of his letter to her was written &#145;in the full stress of cabinet discussion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters to Venetia Stanley</span>, 43); but hardly anyone except Margot realized that Venetia had become much more than a favoured member of a small group. During the early summer of 1914 Venetia seems to have grown anxious about the premier's increasing dependence on her friendship, and to have warned him that he could not remain the centre of her life. She was too fond of Asquith and too much flattered by his devotion to make these warnings effective: when she saw how much she had distressed him she would &#145;make him happy again&#146; by saying &#145;anything he wanted&#146;  (ibid., 558).<br>
<br>It is practically certain that Venetia never became the premier's mistress, but by the early months of 1915 his dependence on her had become almost obsessional. On 30 March he wrote to her four times. He had no idea that she had already decided to free herself from the relationship. Edwin Montagu had proposed to her in 1912. Asquith, like others, believed that Venetia's refusal then represented her settled will. Apart from being physically ill-favoured, Edwin was subject to a provision in his father's will intended to deprive him of a substantial inheritance if he married outside the Jewish faith. The war had altered her attitude more than the premier realized: the young men were being killed at the front, and the conventions which had come near to barring a religious conversion such as this were losing their force. On 12 May 1915 Asquith was appalled to receive Venetia's letter announcing her engagement to Edwin. This shock may well have affected his handling of the coalition crisis which erupted two days later. The end came at the worst possible time; but, after giving him some years of help and support, this romantic friendship had reached an intensity which spelt danger whenever it might end.<br>
<br>The marriage of Edwin and Venetia, which was celebrated on 26 July 1915, some days after she had been received into the Jewish faith, proved unhappy, her liaison with Beaverbrook in 1919 being the most notorious of her infidelities. Edwin was almost certainly not the father of her daughter, Judith (<i>b</i>. 6 Feb 1923). His death in November 1924 brought little change to her lifestyle; but she retained to the last her courage and her ability to hearten much harassed men. She was one of the few who could lighten Winston Churchill's &#145;black dog&#146; moods. She died of cancer at her Norfolk home, Breccles Hall, near Attleborough, on 3 August 1948, and her ashes were interred in Edwin's grave there according to her instructions.<br>
<br>From September 1910 Venetia seems to have kept all Asquith's letters: her collection contained more than 560 items. During the 1920s she complied with requests for selected copies, first from Beaverbrook and later from Asquith himself. These were used in <span class="italic">Politicians and the War</span>, volume 1, and in Asquith's <span class="italic">Memories and Reflections</span>, volume 2, both volumes being published in 1928. In both, the source of the extracts (which were much garbled) was concealed. Asquith presented his as being derived not from letters, but from &#145;contemporary notes&#146;. To the distress of Violet Bonham Carter, Roy Jenkins had access to a complete text for his <span class="italic">Asquith</span> (1964), and one was also available to Randolph Churchill and Martin Gilbert for the relevant volumes of their <span class="roman">Winston Churchill</span> series. A substantial selection, including virtually all the letters of political importance, was edited by M. Brock and E. Brock and was published in 1982.<br>
