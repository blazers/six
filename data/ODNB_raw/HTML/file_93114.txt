<span class="headword">Doniach <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Abileah]</span>,  Deborah</span>  (1912&#150;2004), <span class="occ">immunologist</span>, was born on 6 April 1912 in Geneva, Switzerland, the eldest of the three daughters of Arieh Abileah (1885&#150;1985), a Ukranian-born concert pianist and accompanist of the violinist Josef Szigeti, and his wife, F&eacute;e H&eacute;lt&egrave;s (1886&#150;1983), born Fea Geller in Poltava, Ukraine. Her parents were of Jewish descent. Her father, who was born Joseph Niswitzki, later emigrated to Palestine where he became a professor at the Jerusalem Conservatory of Music. Her mother, inspired by Isadora Duncan, created a novel school of dance and movement in Paris. The family moved frequently during the First World War and eventually settled in Paris, where Deborah was educated at the Lyc&eacute;e Moli&egrave;re, and later became a medical student at the Sorbonne. On 2 August 1933 she married at St Marylebone register office, London, Israel (Sonny) Doniach (1911&#150;2001), a medical student and son of Aaron Doniach, schoolteacher. The couple had met in Palestine in 1925 and later had a son, Sebastian (<i>b</i>. 1934), and a daughter, Vera (1936&#150;1958). Sonny Doniach subsequently became professor of pathology at the London Hospital and a specialist in the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid cancer. Deborah's studies were interrupted by her move to London, but in time she enrolled at the Royal Free Medical School. After graduation she worked for four years as an assistant lecturer in chemical pathology at the Middlesex Hospital, London, and as a research assistant first at the Royal Free Hospital and then, crucially, at the Middlesex as an endocrinologist with the eminent thyroid surgeon Rupert Vaughan Hudson from 1953. She spent the remainder of her career at the Middlesex where she joined the newly formed department of immunology and soon became an honorary consultant immunopathologist and, from 1974, professor of clinical immunology.<br>
<br>In 1956 Doniach was engaged in research on patients with the thyroid inflammatory disorder Hashimoto's disease. She noted that the serum protein fraction that contains the body's general store of antibodies (which protect against infection) fell from elevated to normal levels after removal of the thyroid. Also aware that the patient's thyroid contained many plasma cells, normally known to produce antibodies to foreign moieties such as microbes, she astutely formed the idea that they were responding to a stimulus within the gland itself. Two colleagues, Ivan Roitt and Peter Campbell, were at the time studying the possibility that autoimmune reactions to milk proteins might help to restrain the growth of certain breast cancers. It was perhaps inevitable that collaboration between Doniach, Roitt, and Campbell would generate the hypothesis that the plasma cells in the Hashimoto gland might be reacting not against external microbes but against <i>normal</i> thyroid components. It was rapidly confirmed that the serum of these patients did in fact react with normal thyroid extracts. The result was the pioneering discovery of the damaging consequence of reaction of a patient's immune system with their own tissues, so-called autoimmune disease. Such was the import of these observations that the preliminary communication was published in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> within a week of receipt.<br>
<br>Their initial collaboration began an extremely fruitful partnership between Doniach and Roitt, which also involved many gifted postdoctoral scientists and clinicians. Together they elucidated the nature of the thyroid components evoking autoantibodies in Hashimoto's disease, revealed the involvement of the acid-producing parietal cells in the gastric autoimmunity of pernicious anaemia, and formulated the concept of a spectrum of autoimmune disorders: this ranged from organ-specific or restricted diseases such as Hashimoto thyroiditis and pernicious anaemia at one pole, to the rheumatological disorders involving antibodies and widely distributed body components such as DNA at the other. Intensive studies later revealed the central role of mitochondrial autoimmunity in the liver disease primary biliary cirrhosis. In the late 1960s Doniach pursued a wonderfully productive independent path which uncovered the critical evidence for autoimmunity in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and the existence of thyroid growth-promoting and growth-inhibitory antibodies. The care she had for the patients in her thyroid clinic and her awareness of the diagnostic value of the antibodies in these autoimmune diseases were driving forces behind the establishment of a diagnostic clinical immunology routine service, which subsequently became a standard provision in virtually all major pathology laboratories. Her contribution was recognized by numerous awards, including the Van Meter prize of the American Goitre Association (jointly) in 1957, the Toronto-based Gairdner award (jointly) in 1964, and in 1967 the prize of the British Postgraduate Medical Federation. She was also elected woman scientist of the year in 1984 by the Association of American Women Scientists.<br>
<br>Deborah Doniach retired from the Middlesex Hospital in the late 1980s, though she never lost her enthusiasm for reading and writing about science and published her last review in 2000. Indeed, she was enthusiastic not just about science but also, as a true scholar, about the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake. She undertook detailed studies of Shakespeare, Byron, Freud, Moli&egrave;re, and latterly Spinoza with great enthusiasm. Among her many talents were a fluency in several languages and an accomplished soprano voice. She loved the arts but hated sports, and could not understand her husband's interest in watching football on television. A warm and friendly person, she was always open to new ideas and willing to help young research workers and clinicians. Her extraordinary zest for life was inspiring and guaranteed that never a dull moment would be had in her company. After a relationship of seventy-five years her husband died in February 2001. Deborah Doniach died of cancer at St John's Hospice, Westminster, on 1 January 2004. She was survived by her son, Sebastian, a professor of physics at Stanford University, California.<br>
