<span class="headword">O'Connor,  John</span>  (1824&#150;1887), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician in Canada</span>, was born on 21 January 1824 in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of John and Mary O'Connor, who had emigrated thence from co. Kerry, Ireland, in 1823. In 1828 they moved to the Roman Catholic settlement of Maidstone township, Essex county, Upper Canada. Unable to work on his parents' farm after an accident in which he lost his left leg, O'Connor began in 1848 to study law, first in Sandwich (Windsor) and then in Toronto. In April 1849 he married Mary Barrett; they had nine children. He was admitted to the bar of Upper Canada in 1854 and worked first in Windsor and then, from 1863 to 1865, in Toronto. He was very active in local politics in Essex in the 1860s, and represented the county in the legislative assembly in 1863 and again from 1867 to 1874. The only Irish Roman Catholic member at a time when Ontario's Irish Catholics were becoming an important political force, he had some success in forging a Catholic&#150;Conservative alliance. From 1872 to 1873 he served in the government of Sir John A. Macdonald as president of the privy council, minister of inland revenue, and finally postmaster-general, but he was defeated in Essex in the federal election of 1874.<br>
<br>O'Connor left Windsor to establish a legal practice in Ottawa, where he was again active in Irish Catholic affairs. He was found a safe seat in 1878 and was returned to parliament as the member for Russell and held a number of minor cabinet offices between 1878 and 1881. By this time illness prevented his regular attendance at cabinet meetings and debates and his cultivating his constituents. He pestered Macdonald for help, not least because he was in financial need. Macdonald dismissed him from his cabinet but was finally persuaded to appoint him judge of the court of queen's bench for Ontario on 11 September 1884, in which office he proved &#145;an embarrassment to both the government and the bench&#146;  (Swainson). While he was regarded by the legal profession as incompetent through illness and lack of practice, O'Connor saw himself as underpaid and generally ill-used. His action against the government for extra payment for legal work was being heard when he died at Cobourg, Ontario, on 3 November 1887. Swainson considers that his successes were won not because of his personal abilities or merits, but because he was the only person able to represent the Ontario Irish Catholics when their support mattered to the Conservative Party.<br>
