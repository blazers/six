<span class="headword">Fowke,  Joseph</span>  (1716&#150;1800), <span class="occ">East India Company servant and free merchant</span>, was born in Madras and baptized there on 22 October 1716, one of the four children of Randall Fowke (1673&#150;1745) of the Madras council, and his wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> May (1680&#150;1734). Joseph probably travelled to England in 1728 with his father, who was making a short visit. He went back to Madras as a writer about 1736, rising to third in council. He returned to England in 1752. A year later he wrote of his fortune, partly acquired through trading in diamonds, as standing at &pound;18,000  (J. Fowke to J. Walsh, 12 Jan 1753, BL OIOC, MS Eur. D546). Although nominated governor of Madras in 1754, he never took up the appointment, having failed to agree a salary with the company.<br>
<br>Joseph's marriage on 7 May 1750 to Elizabeth (1731&#150;1760), the daughter of Joseph Walsh (1694&#150;1731), a company official, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Maskelyne (<i>d</i>. 1734), whose cousin Margaret became Lady Clive, forged an important family link for the Fowkes. Their three children, Francis, Arthur, and Margaret, were born after they had returned to England. As a widower, Joseph married Kitty Lavinia Treacher in London on 1 September 1770. She died at St Helena in 1774. They had three children, Sophia (<i>b</i>. 1769), Louisa (<i>b</i>. 1770), and William, who was born in India. Joseph also had a natural daughter, Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1768), whose mother was Grace Croftes. There appears to have been another natural daughter, born in India of an unknown mother, &#145;who cannot be publickly acknowledged&#146;  (J. Fowke to F. Fowke, [1786], BL OIOC, MS Eur. E6, item 108).<br>
<br>Joseph again departed for India in 1771 with his second wife and set up as a free merchant trading in diamonds, hoping to recoup the modest fortune that he had gambled away after his first wife's death. Family and political links with Clive drew him towards Warren Hastings's opponents, particularly to General Clavering and Philip Francis. In April 1775 he was found not guilty on a charge of conspiracy against Hastings although convicted of conspiracy against Hastings's associate Richard Barwell. Joseph moved to Benares to carry on his diamond trading. In 1780 Francis obtained a sinecure in Calcutta for him, but they quickly fell out, although they were later reconciled. Joseph's appointment was terminated in 1783. On his return to England in 1788 he was worth no more than &pound;1400. He engaged in a bitter dispute with the company over his claim to a pension. Edmund Burke raised the matter in parliament, but Joseph refused the company's only offer of &pound;700 of arrears. He died in Bath on 16 May 1800, bequeathing to the sole beneficiary of his will &#145;a debt due to me from the East India Company of which I have been unjustly deprived&#146;.<br>
<br>Old Fowke, as he was widely known to contemporaries, was a complicated man. Hastings complained of his undeniably violent and morose temperament, yet Burke saw him as &#145;a man of honour even romantick; and of very great natural abilities&#146;  (Burke to Dundas, 22 April 1791, <span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 6.251). Both were right. He was a reckless gambler, querulous with friends and relations, negligent of his children when young and a trial to their patience thereafter, but talented enough to be considered more than once for a governorship, a valued friend of Samuel Johnson, and a discerning lover of music.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_63562"></a><span class="headword">Francis Fowke</span>  (1753&#150;1819)<span class="occ"></span>, eldest son of Joseph, was born on 22 October 1753 and baptized at St George's, Hanover Square, London, on 22 December 1753. He was sent to school at Dr Gilpin's in Cheam, Surrey, and went to Bengal as a writer in 1773. In August 1775 he was appointed resident at Benares to implement the provisions of the treaty of Fyzabad, which had been negotiated by Clavering, Colonel Monson, and Philip Francis against Hastings's opposition. After Monson's death in September 1776 Hastings regained control of the Bengal council and was able to use his casting vote to recall Francis Fowke from Benares in December 1776. Hastings was censured by the company and ordered to reinstate Fowke in 1777, orders which were ignored. A motion in council for Fowke's restoration moved by Philip Francis on 5 April 1779 failed. However, Fowke regained Benares in February 1780 as part of a short-lived truce agreed between Hastings and Philip Francis. In January 1781, a month after Philip Francis had sailed for England, Hastings again recalled Fowke and once more the company ordered his reinstatement, which was finally effected in April 1783.<br>
<br>In between residencies at Benares, Francis lived in Chinsura and Calcutta. He amassed a fortune of at least &pound;70,000 founded on trade in diamonds and opium, and on government contracts. He returned to England in 1786. His natural son William, baptized in Calcutta on 17 October 1781, came back to England with him. By 1788 Francis had entered into a liaison with Mary Lowe (<i>c</i>.1769&#150;1847), said to have been an actress. They had fifteen children but remained unmarried until 19 July 1813, when, apparently in some secrecy, they went through a ceremony at St Olave's, Southwark. This belated marriage took place twelve days after Francis had written a will, which, after securing an annuity of &pound;500 to his wife, declared that all his children were born previous to his marriage but that all should share equally in his estate.<br>
<br>Francis lived in Wimbledon in the 1790s and commanded the Wimbledon light horse volunteers. He later lived at 41 Hertford Street, Mayfair, Westminster, commenced the building of Boughrood Castle in Radnorshire in 1817, and rented property in Worthing and near Torquay. Francis was a more equable man than his father, whom he roundly castigated for improvidence but, none the less, assisted financially. However, they seem to have shared a love of music and a taste for creating bewildering family networks. Francis died at Bochrwyd (Boughrood) on 20 October 1819.<br>

<a name="cosubject_63563"></a><span class="headword">Margaret  Benn-Walsh</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Margaret Fowke]</span>  (1758&#150;1836)<span class="occ"></span>, the youngest child of Joseph and Elizabeth, was born on 13 July 1758 and baptized at St George's, Hanover Square, London, on 16 August 1758. She was a goddaughter of Lady Clive. Left motherless at an early age and forsaken by an impecunious father, she came under the guardianship of John Walsh (1726&#150;1795), her maternal uncle, who had been a councillor in Madras and private secretary to Lord Clive. Member of parliament for Worcester from 1761 until 1780 and a fellow of the Royal Society, he was unmarried, brusque in manner, but a benefactor to all his sister's children. As a young girl Margaret was boarded out. Her carers were not always well chosen and at one time she became quite seriously mentally disturbed. She briefly attended a school in Queen Square, London, but between the ages of seven and seventeen her education was acquired in the library of John Walsh and those of the Clives and the Stracheys. At seventeen Margaret was &#145;a tall and large woman&#146;  (Walsh to F. Fowke, 20 April 1775, BL OIOC, MS Eur. E3, item 38), and in 1776 she embarked for Bengal, &#145;I suppose to get her a husband, which, she has not beauty or fortune enough to get here&#146;  (F. Fowke, sen. [uncle] to F. Fowke, 22 Nov 1775, BL OIOC, MS Eur. E3, item 44). At first she lived in Calcutta but later joined her father and brother in Benares and Chinsura. Independently minded, she was not intimidated by her domineering father, defying him, for example, over an excursion up the Ganges with friends that he considered unsuitable.<br>
<br>Margaret was among the first British women to take an informed interest in Indian music. She was a pioneer of the genre which was termed &#145;the Hindostannie air&#146;, a piece derived from an Indian original arranged in an English idiom. By 1784 she had made a collection of songs and delighted Hastings with her performance. Margaret not only organized musicians and linguists to make transcriptions and to perform the airs but she also took down the airs herself and attempted to play along with Indian musicians. She was also interested in mathematics, excelled as an equestrienne, and, by all accounts, had a compelling manner and presence.<br>
<br>Margaret returned to England with her brother in 1786. The following year she married John Benn (1759&#150;1825), who had been assistant resident at Benares, where he made an estimated &pound;80,000 trading in diamonds and opium. On the death of John Walsh in 1795 Margaret inherited all his property in trust for her as yet unborn son. After four stillborn children, a daughter was born in 1794 and a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28612/', "John Benn-Walsh")</script>, eventually first Baron Ormathwaite, in 1798. The Benns assumed the additional name Walsh in 1795. John Benn-Walsh senior was elected to parliament in 1802 and created a baronet in 1804. He died at Cheltenham in 1825. Margaret died at Binfield Park, Berkshire, on 29 September 1836. The careers of Joseph Fowke and his eldest son and daughter not only illustrate the opportunities for acquiring wealth in eighteenth-century British India, in spite of the hazards of its volatile politics, but also show how individuals responded to Indian culture.<br>
