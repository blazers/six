<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Williams,  Isaac</span>  (1802&#150;1865), <span class="occ">poet and theologian</span>, was born on 19 December 1802 and baptized on 27 December 1802 at Cwmcynfelyn, an estate overlooking the village of Llangorwen, near Aberystwyth, Cardiganshire, the third son, among four sons and one daughter, of Isaac Lloyd Williams (1771&#150;1846), magistrate of Cardiganshire and chancery barrister of Lincoln's Inn, and his wife, Anne, elder daughter and coheir of Matthew Davies of Cwmcynfelyn, formerly high sheriff of Cardiganshire. The family lived in Southampton Street, Bloomsbury, London, and later in Belgravia. Williams and his elder brothers were taught in London by a Revd Polehampton, whose pupils subsequently moved with him when he took a curacy at Worplesdon, near Guildford, Surrey. Unhappy there, Williams entered Harrow School in 1817 along with his brothers Charles Lloyd and Jonathan, gaining a reputation for his skill in Latin composition and winning several school prizes, as well as captaining the cricket team in his final year, 1821. In that year Williams's parents settled at Cwmcynfelyn on the death of his maternal grandfather, though protracted legal action between his mother and her sister over the division of the estate was significantly to diminish the family's means.<br>
<br>Williams was directed to Trinity College, Oxford, by his Harrow tutor the Revd Henry Drury, matriculating there on 7 June 1821. Although he held a scholarship at Trinity from 3 June 1822 until 1831, Williams spent much of his time as an undergraduate in company at Oriel, initially since it was the college of his Harrow friend Robert Dallas, though increasingly because of its associations with many of those later to become prominent in the Tractarian or Oxford Movement. In the summer of 1822 he was introduced to John Keble, then fellow of Oriel, at the Aberystwyth home of a mutual friend, the Revd John Richards, and they became more closely acquainted after 1823 when Williams won the chancellor's prize for Latin verse with his &#145;Ars geologica&#146;, which Keble volunteered to revise for publication. In that year Williams was invited to join a reading party of Keble's at Southrop, near Fairford, Gloucestershire, along with the later Tractarians Richard Hurrell Froude and Robert Isaac Wilberforce. Keble's influence served to inculcate more studious and pious habits than those of school and early college, and Williams came to regard this invitation as the &#145;turning-point&#146; in his life  (Williams, 12). He repeated the excursion to Southrop in 1824, when he began his long association with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22738/', "Sir George Prevost, second baronet")</script>, which was reinforced in March 1828 when the latter married Williams's sister Jane against the wishes of Prevost's family. In 1825 Williams stayed at Prevost's home in Belmont, Hampshire, near Keble's new curacy at Hursley, and in August accompanied Froude to his father's rectory at Dartington, near Totnes, Devon, where he was introduced to the Champernowne family of Dartington House to whom Archdeacon Froude was guardian. Williams first proposed to the sixteen-year-old Caroline Champernowne (1810/11&#150;1886), third daughter of the late Arthur Champernowne, about Easter 1827, though at this point their engagement foundered on the younger Froude's urging Williams towards celibacy.<br>
<br>At Oxford, Williams studied hard in attempting to emulate Keble's double first in classics and mathematics, but his labours especially over the latter broke his health. His London physician Dr Abernethey required him to abort his studies, and he was forced in 1825 to take a pass degree, graduating BA on 25 May 1826, and subsequently MA in 1831 and BD in 1839. Having sat unsuccessfully for a fellowship at Oriel in April 1829, Williams was ordained deacon in December 1829 by Christopher Bethell, then bishop of Gloucester, taking a curacy under the Revd James Davies, a high-churchman with whom he formed a lasting friendship, at Sherborne-cum-Windrush, close to John Keble's parish at Fairford, Thomas Keble's at Bisley, and the Prevosts' home at Chalford. He remained there for two years studying Hebrew and writing poetry, though afflicted by the first of the asthmatic attacks from which he was to suffer chronically the rest of his life.<br>
<br>On 30 May 1831 Williams obtained a fellowship at his former college, Trinity, whereupon he took clerical orders and then went into residence as a tutor in 1832. W. J. Copeland was elected to a fellowship at Trinity in 1832, and in their common churchmanship and their endeavours to improve the religious tone of the college he and Williams formed a close association. Williams served as philosophy lecturer in that year, dean in 1833, rhetoric lecturer from 1834 to 1840, and vice-president from 1841 to 1842, and although his &#145;rule was too strict and his standard too high&#146;  (Pycroft, 1.20) to make much impact on the college's &#145;wilder set&#146;  (ibid., 1.186), Williams's example of moral austerity and academic rigour made a lasting impression on a generation of Trinity scholars, among them the later lord chancellor Roundell Palmer, the theologian Frederick Meyrick, the historian E. A. Freeman, and Arthur West Haddan, who was to succeed Williams as classics tutor in 1842.<br>
<br>Williams's return to Oxford, moreover, coincided with the emergence of the Tractarian movement. In 1832 he enlisted as curate to John Henry Newman, to whom he soon became close, serving St Mary's while Newman was in the Mediterranean with Froude in 1832&#150;3, and thereafter mostly the Littlemore part of the parish. In 1833 Williams, Froude, and Keble, later joined by Newman, began submitting to the high-church <span class="italic">British Magazine</span> the series of verses published collectively in 1836 as &#145;Lyra apostolica&#146;, which went through numerous editions, Williams's writing signified by the Greek letter &#950;. Growing in confidence, though bristling at Newman's superintendence of the venture, Williams increasingly concentrated on his own verse, and among his other contributions to the magazine between 1833 and 1837 were verses which were expanded and published anonymously in 1838 as <span class="italic">The Cathedral, or, The Catholic and Apostolic Church in England</span>, which ran through several editions, and if not his best is now his best-remembered poetry. Inspired schematically by George Herbert's <span class="italic">The Temple</span> and by William Wordsworth's preface to the &#145;Excursion&#146;, and metrically by William Collins and perhaps also William Cowper, the collection explores the structure of a Gothic cathedral in verses celebrating the religious doctrines evoked by its various parts. Emboldened by its success, Williams immediately issued <span class="italic">Thoughts in Past Years</span>, also anonymously (though as &#145;The Author of &#147;The Cathedral&#148;&#146;), a collection mostly of sonnets celebrating the various scenes of his life in Wales, Gloucestershire, and Oxford, and written over the previous twelve years, with further verses, some school exercises, and the &#145;Ars geologica&#146; added in the sixth and final edition of 1852. Though it lacked the obvious coherence of <span class="italic">The Cathedral</span> Williams considered this his best work, and with later verse always serving to promulgate church principles it is notable as his only composition in a conventionally Romantic vein.<br>
<br>Williams published further poems in the <span class="italic">British Magazine</span> between 1833 and 1837, which were collected as <span class="italic">Hymns Translated from the Parisian Breviary</span> in 1839, with a second, posthumous edition appearing in 1874. Despite Williams's own deprecation of metrical hymnody for congregational use other than that of the psalter, these greatly influenced such hymn writers as the Revd John Chandler and John Mason Neale. Williams's inadvertent but thus important role in the development of Anglican hymnody was furthered by his publication of <span class="italic">Ancient Hymns for Children</span>, also from the Parisian breviary, in 1842, and (anonymously) his <span class="italic">Hymns on the Catechism</span> of 1843.<br>
<br>Williams contributed several reviews to the <span class="italic">British Critic</span> after Newman's accession to its editorship in 1838, but much his most controversial publication in these years was his <span class="italic">Reserve in Communicating Religious Knowledge</span>, which appeared in 1838 as no. 80 in the series of the <span class="roman">Tracts for the Times</span>. The tract, whose notoriety was owed rather to its title (which was Newman's) than contents, argued that the sacred truths and mysteries of faith were reserved for those with the preparatory discipline to receive them, and drew numerous reproofs from low-church critics to whom it seemed definitive evidence of Tractarianism's excessive emphasis on the authority of the church hierarchy. In suggesting that indiscriminate religious instruction and church building were ineffectual without antecedent subscription to church principles, the tract was directed against evangelical emphasis on individual atonement and feeling, and was drawn theoretically from antiquity, particularly Origen's <span class="italic">Commentaries on the Gospels</span>, and practically from the example of the Kebles. In <span class="italic">The Cathedral</span> Williams had represented this doctrine of reserve in poetic terms, with the beauty of the natural world found in its remotest places. Williams tried to remain aloof from Tractarian counter-attacks in its defence, but was finally drawn into print in 1841 with <span class="italic">A Few Remarks on the Charge of the Lord Bishop of Gloucester and Bristol</span>, James Henry Monk, who had accused Williams of seeking to withhold scripture from the laity. Williams wrote two further <span class="roman">Tracts for the Times</span>, no. 86, on the prayer book, arguing that the church's purity was brought out by persecution and appealing to the example of the Caroline divines and the nonjurors, and no. 87, which attempted to calm the furore surrounding the tract on reserve.<br>
<br>When Keble resigned as Oxford's professor of poetry in 1841, Williams was thought by many the obvious candidate to succeed him, but after the controversy surrounding the tract on reserve his nomination was unlikely to proceed untouched by religious politics. James Garbett of Brasenose College, a reputable scholar but no poet, was nominated in opposition, and after Edward Pusey issued a pamphlet accusing Garbett's supporters of promoting him solely as an anti-Tractarian candidate the contest became a trial of strength between the theological parties, with Roundell Palmer acting as secretary to a London committee of Williams's supporters and defending Williams from epistolary censures in <span class="italic">The Times</span> by Anthony Ashley-Cooper, Lord Ashley (later seventh earl of Shaftesbury). An appeal was then issued for both parties to retire, Bishop Richard Bagot of Oxford and William Ewart Gladstone among the signatories, but while Williams's natural deference to episcopal authority and personal regard for Bagot led him to wish to accede, Tractarian friends dissuaded him. The matter was only resolved when after a comparison of pledged votes Garbett was found to have 921 to Williams's 621, whereupon, a week before the election was due, he withdrew from the contest, the Tractarians thereby sustaining their first defeat in Oxford's university politics.<br>
<br>Wounded both by the hostile exposure he had suffered and the perceived defection of some he had thought firmer friends, Williams in 1842 resigned his fellowship and his curacy at St Mary's and left Oxford. His deep personal affection for Newman had always been accompanied by distrust of what he was to call a &#145;want of repose in his character&#146;  (Williams, 101), and after Newman confided his increasingly pro-Roman sympathies in 1841 Williams had informed him that they could no longer retain their intimacy. On 22 June 1842 he married Caroline Champernowne at Bisley, Gloucestershire, where they settled and he served as curate to Thomas Keble. In January 1846, having only just recovered from a lumbar abscess, Williams fell gravely ill with consumption, with both Pusey and Henry Manning travelling to see him for what they took to be the last time. Though he unexpectedly recovered after several months, thereafter Williams lived essentially in retirement. In 1848 he moved to Stinchcombe, also in Gloucestershire, to serve as curate to Sir George Prevost, with E. A. Freeman moving to the neighbourhood in the same year. A house was built for Williams near the vicarage, and he dedicated himself to such parochial work as his health permitted, the education of his children (eventually six sons and a daughter), and an unrelenting flow of religious writing.<br>
<br>Williams is chiefly remembered as the poet of the Oxford Movement, but posterity has not been especially kind to his verse, which is unoriginal and often leaden in expression, and inhibited by its adherence to the sonnet form. But it was written to commend church principles to an age with an appetite for religious poetry even of a minor order, and defeat in the poetry professorship contest did nothing to check Williams's output. <span class="italic">The Baptistery</span>, of 1842, a series of thirty-two verse meditations, was inspired by the allegorical drawings of the Flemish engraver Boethius a Bolswert, which Williams had found in Antoine Sucquet's <span class="italic">Via vitae aeternae</span>, or &#145;The way of eternal life&#146;, first published in 1620. Part of Pusey's efforts to introduce foreign books of devotion to the country, and both critically and commercially the most successful of his published poetry, its anti-Roman verses furthered Williams's breach with Newman. In 1845 Williams published <span class="italic">Some Meditations and Prayers</span>, selected and translated from the originals by Sucquet, and issued a companion volume to <span class="italic">The Baptistery</span> entitled <span class="italic">The Altar</span>, comprising thirty-four meditations in sonnet form, in 1847. Of less interest are his <span class="italic">Sacred Verses, with Pictures</span> of 1845, and <span class="italic">The Seven Days, or, The Old and New Creation</span> of 1850.<br>
<br>In his own day, however, Williams was actually better known for his voluminous devotional writings. His series of commentaries entitled <span class="italic">The Gospel Narrative</span>, published serially between 1841 and 1850 and posthumously reissued in a uniform eight-volume edition by Rivingtons in 1869&#150;70, gained Williams a wide public. Other devotional commentary on scripture included his <span class="italic">Thoughts on the Study of the Holy Gospels</span> (1842), <span class="italic">A Harmony of the Four Evangelists</span> (1850), <span class="italic">The Apocalypse</span> (1852), <span class="italic">The Psalms Interpreted of Christ</span> (1864, of which only volume 1 appeared), and <span class="italic">The Daily Events of Holy Week</span> (1865), while <span class="italic">The Christian Scholar</span> (1849) appended Christian comments to passages from various classical writers in order &#145;to render the study of the Classics subservient to a higher wisdom&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Christian Scholar</span>, xiii). <span class="italic">Selections from the Writings of Isaac Williams, B.D.</span> appeared posthumously in 1890.<br>
<br>For much of the 1840s Williams was simultaneously occupied with the task of editing, jointly with W. J. Copeland, the series of <span class="italic">Plain Sermons by Contributors to the Tracts for the Times</span>, which he commenced in 1839 in an attempt to impart a more moderate tone to the movement after the furore provoked by the publication of Froude's <span class="italic">Remains</span>, and which appeared over ten unattributed volumes until 1848. His own sermons featured in the second, fourth, seventh, ninth, and tenth volumes, with <span class="italic">Plain Sermons, on the Latter Part of the Catechism</span> (1851) essentially an addendum to the sermons of volume 9. Williams later issued <span class="italic">A Series of Sermons on the Epistle and Gospel</span> (3 vols., 1853&#150;5, 2nd edn 1875) and <span class="italic">Sermons on the Characters of the Old Testament</span> (1856, 2nd edn 1870), with a companion volume of sermons on <span class="italic">Female Characters of Holy Scripture</span> in 1859. In 1852 Williams also published <span class="italic">A Short Memoir of the Revd. Robert Alfred Suckling</span>, curate of Bussage in the parish of Bisley from 1846 until his sudden death in 1851, and edited a volume of Suckling's <span class="italic">Sermons, Plain and Practical</span> in 1853.<br>
<br>Williams's health declined seriously in 1865. Soon after Easter that year Newman paid a farewell visit to Stinchcombe, and Williams died there three days later on 1 May. He was buried that month alongside his father and sister in the churchyard, where a monument was erected to his memory, along with the reredos at Stinchcombe and two windows in the chancel. A stained-glass window in his memory was placed by subscription in the chapel at Trinity College, Oxford, though it was removed in 1959. Williams left one daughter and six sons, three of whom followed him into the Anglican ministry: the eldest, John Edward, co-founder of the missionary order of St Augustine in South Africa, the second, George Arthur, vicar of Weston Beggard, Herefordshire, and the third, Henry, at whose rectory at Ashleworth, Gloucestershire, Williams's widow, Caroline, died on 1 February 1886.<br>
<br>It is an irony that the tract on reserve and the poetry professorship contest propelled Williams into national controversy, for his was the least disputatious of temperaments. Its natural expression was rather his association with Thomas Keble and George Prevost in forming the nucleus of what has become known as the &#145;Bisley school&#146; of the Oxford Movement, marked by its religious and political conservatism and therefore hostility to Rome, reticence of manner, and pastoral zeal. Williams's <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, written in 1851 and edited and published by Prevost in 1892, remains a valuable source for early Tractarianism, but it ends with his departure from Oxford, and was written for his children and never intended for publication. The modesty and exiguousness of these memoirs, Williams's chronic ill health, and his long seclusion at Stinchcombe have combined to marginalize both Williams's voluminous output and his central place in the Oxford Movement's first generation.<br>
