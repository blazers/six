<span class="headword">McIlroy, Dame  (Anne) Louise</span>  (1878&#150;1968), <span class="occ">obstetrician and gynaecologist</span>, was born at Lavin House, co. Antrim, Ireland, daughter of James McIlroy, general practitioner of Ballycastle, co. Antrim. Her sister, Janie Hamilton McIlroy, became a specialist in ophthalmology. Louise McIlroy graduated MB ChB at Glasgow University in 1898, going on to receive an MD with commendation in 1900. Her postgraduate work took her to Dublin (licentiate in midwifery, 1901), London, Vienna, and Berlin, and she obtained a DSc from Glasgow University in 1910. McIlroy was appointed resident house surgeon at the Samaritan Hospital For Women, Glasgow, in 1900 and in 1906 she succeeded Elizabeth Pace as gynaecologist at the city's Victoria Infirmary. Her first prestigious post came in 1911, when she was appointed first assistant to the Muirhead professor of obstetrics and gynaecology in Glasgow, Professor J. M. Munro Kerr, who was to have a strong influence on her later work.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the First World War McIlroy gave up her promising career in Glasgow to work for the war effort. She was one of the founders of the Scottish Women's Hospital for Foreign Service. Appointed surgeon-in-chief, she served in France, Serbia, and Salonika, and became surgeon at the Royal Army Medical Corps hospital at Constantinople. In recognition of her services she was awarded the Croix de Guerre in 1916, and became OBE in 1920. On her return to Britain she published a book describing her wartime experiences, <span class="italic">From a Balcony on the Bosphorus</span> (1924).<br>
<br>In 1921 McIlroy was appointed consulting obstetrician and gynaecological surgeon at the Royal Free Hospital and became the first woman professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the Royal Free Hospital school of medicine, University of London. Her appointment was seen by some as an unwelcome experiment, not only because she was a woman, but also because she had trained and worked outside London. Yet McIlroy came to be renowned for her teaching as well as for her prolific research and writing. She is remembered particularly for her book <span class="italic">The Toxaemias of Pregnancy</span> (1936), and for her work on the relief of pain in childbirth and the management of asphyxia of the new-born, but her numerous British and American journal articles dating from 1904 to 1951 also cover social issues such as &#145;the problem of the working mother&#146;  (<span class="italic">Index Medicus</span>, 1922). In 1929 McIlroy was promoted to DBE and also elected as a founder fellow of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, if only because her male colleagues &#145;thought it necessary to have a representative of the women&#146;  (Shaw, 47). In 1932 she gained the MRCP.<br>
<br>Dame Louise McIlroy took early retirement in 1934, but continued to practise at 115a Harley Street, London, and as consultant to the Bermondsey Medical Mission, the Thorpe Coombe Maternity Hospital, and to the boroughs of Finchley and Walthamstow. She obtained a second DSc, this time from the University of London, in 1934, and obtained the LLD at Glasgow University the following year. She also received a number of honorary degrees, and was elected FRCP in 1937. During the Second World War she again made a significant contribution by helping to organize the emergency maternity services in Buckinghamshire and by acting as consultant gynaecologist to the Women's Royal Naval Service in Plymouth. She was considered by her contemporaries to have &#145;great personal charm&#146; and a &#145;puckish sense of humour&#146;, but also to be &#145;devastating in criticism if warranted&#146; and to enjoy nothing better than &#145;a wordy battle with her male colleagues&#146;  (<span class="italic">BMJ</span>, 451). Dame Louise McIlroy died on 8 February 1968 in Glasgow Hospital. She was commemorated at the Royal Free Hospital by having a gynaecological ward named after her.<br>
