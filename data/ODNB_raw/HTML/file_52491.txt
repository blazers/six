<span class="headword">Dent,  Abraham</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1729, <em>d.</em> 1803), <span class="occ">shopkeeper</span>, was baptized on 4 February 1729 at Kirkby Stephen, Westmorland, the elder child and only son of William Dent (1698&#150;1774), a shopkeeper and wine merchant of Kirkby Stephen. A sister, Isabel, was baptized in 1732. Little is known of Dent's early life, but since he and his father were in partnership for a time, being addressed as Messrs W. Dent &amp; Son, it might be conjectured that Abraham received his business training from his parent.<br>
<br>On 19 August 1754 Dent married Elizabeth Grainger. Their first two children died shortly after birth, but in 1761 a daughter, Elizabeth, survived, to be followed by sons Thomas and Abraham in 1765 and 1767. Letters and burial records show that a second wife, Anne, about whom nothing is known, died in 1781. Dent's third marriage, two years later, was to a widow, Isabel Metcalfe (<i>d</i>. 1807), of Sedbusk in Wensleydale, where the couple eventually lived.<br>
<br>What is known of Dent's life is gained almost entirely from surviving records of his business, between the years 1756 and 1780: one ledger of purchases for the shop from 1756 to 1777 with names and addresses of suppliers; a daybook of credit sales from the shop from 1762 to 1765; and another of sales from 1767 to 1780 dealing predominantly with stockings. There are also some loose papers, letters, and a letter-book covering the period from 1780 to 1789.<br>
<br>Although they sold goods which can be categorized as groceries, the Dents, father and son, were not called grocers but were variously described as mercers, merchants, and wine merchants. Their stocks were in the tradition of the mercers&#151;who initially sold imported and slightly exotic wares alongside their cloth and other luxury goods. Tea, sugar, dried fruits, tobacco, and spices featured prominently in the Dents' shop, together with a good range of household necessities such as flour, hops, soap, and starch, patent medicines, paper, books, and magazines. A wide variety of individual items, from gardening and building equipment to items of clothing and cutlery, attest to Abraham Dent's willingness to arrange specific commissions for his customers; he also regularly supplied gunpowder to several companies.<br>
<br>Dent stocked everything needed for making clothes, and his records are informative about the quantities and materials required for particular garments. In 1764, for example, we see the same elements of superfine black cloth, shalloon, dimity, buckram, pocket fustian, canvas, thread, tape, twist, and coat and breast buttons being purchased in different quantities for two clerical gentlemen, at a cost of around &pound;3 5<i>s</i>. 11<i>d</i>., while thick-set, shalloon, and flannel were bought for making servants' clothing at a total of &pound;1 15<i>s</i>. 7<i>d</i>.<br>
<br>Again in the tradition of the mercers, Dent sold small items of ready-made clothing: gloves, assorted handkerchiefs, and knitted stockings. He was both manufacturer and retailer of hosiery; he took specific orders for hose, bought wool with which to supply the local hand-knitters with yarn, then collected and dispatched the finished work. Most of his orders came from two main army contractors in London, and were for different types of military stockings&#151;soldiers' and sergeants' hose, marching regiments' hose, and guards' hose&#151;although other types, such as ribbed yarn hose and loop worsted hose, were also supplied. Quantities varied, but the prices Dent charged remained fairly constant over twenty years. Business was brisk in the 1770s, when an individual order could be for as many as 7000 pairs of marching regiments' hose at 12<i>d</i>. a pair, but sales declined considerably in the 1780s.<br>
<br>Dent's daybook of credit sales shows that his shop customers came from a wide social range. The middle class predominates, with a number of clergy, doctors, and schoolmasters, but purchases were made by consumers from both ends of the social spectrum: tea and paper were bought by Sir George Dalston of Smarldale Hall, while sugar, treacle, flour, and candles were bought by labourer James Petty.<br>
<br>Dent was also a brewer, and owned a small acreage of land. His position as a propertied tradesman in a country township conferred a degree of public responsibility: his property qualified him to be a voter in the county elections, he sat on the jury of the local manorial court, and was a churchwarden. For the year 1767&#150;8 he shared the job of overseer of the poor for the township, keeping the accounts in his ledger book, and some years later shared the position of surveyor of the highways.<br>
<br>It might be true to say, as Willan (147) suggests, that Dent was &#145;too versatile&#146;, combining &#145;too many roles&#146;, and that his connections were too wide and his social contacts too broad for him to be viewed as typical of a small town shopkeeper in the 1700s. It may be, however, that his energetic hard work and his innovative diversification make Dent particularly representative of the rising class of retailers whose entrepreneurial spirit made new demands of their suppliers&#151;demands which stimulated and fuelled the growth of consumerism and industrialization.<br>
<br>Dent was buried at Hardraw on 3 March 1803 and was survived by his third wife. Although evidence suggests that during his lifetime Dent's private, public, and business activities had only local impact, his records provide invaluable information: they demonstrate methods of wholesale, retail, and dealership practices; show the social interaction, purchasing customs, and employment of a small community; and provide details of the wares themselves, their range, qualities, and values. They cast light on an extremely important, but historically under-represented group&#151;the small town shopkeepers of eighteenth-century England.<br>
