<span class="headword">Vischer, Sir  Hanns</span>  (1876&#150;1945), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born at Basel, Switzerland, on 14 September 1876, the third of five children of Adolf Eberhard Vischer (1839&#150;1902), a prosperous Swiss silk merchant, and his wife, Carolina Rosalia (Rosalie) Sarasin. His father was a deeply committed evangelical Christian and an Anglophile, sentiments which his son Hanns fully shared. Educated first at the Humanistisches Gymnasium in Basel, Vischer then went on to St Lawrence College at Ramsgate, Kent. He read modern languages at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1899. His early rowing experience on the Rhine got him into the first boat crew: a contemporary recalled the courage, gaiety, and charm of &#145;Swissy&#146;.<br>
<br>From childhood Vischer had been attracted by the idea of Africa, and he spent his last long vacation from Cambridge studying Hausa in Tripoli. He also undertook a medical course at a Swiss hospital. After a year studying theology at Ridley Hall in Cambridge, he sailed for Nigeria in November 1900 as a lay missionary with the Church Missionary Society. He spent a year at Loko on the Benue River, but resigned from his post in 1902. He informed the society that in order to keep in touch with the country where he felt &#145;lies the work of my life&#146;  (Parkinson, 7) he had applied for British nationality and also for a place in the British colonial service. He successfully obtained both, and in 1903 joined Sir Frederick Lugard's staff in Northern Nigeria. Appointed resident at Bornu in 1905, he spent much of these early years having to live down &#145;the objections to employing him which his name at first excited&#146;  (ibid.). A keen linguist, he became proficient not only in Hausa, but also in Arabic and a number of other local languages.<br>
<br>Keen to learn more about the peoples of the region, Vischer obtained permission to return from leave via an ancient slave trading route. His subsequent journey from Tripoli across the Sahara to Lake Chad between July and December 1906 proved to be a memorable experience, and in 1910 he published <span class="italic">Across the Sahara</span>, an account of the journey illustrated with his own sketches. As well as describing the colourful characters he met, he collected much useful information about this neglected region; and the book was given much publicity in the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> and elsewhere.<br>
<br>In 1908 Vischer was seconded to take charge of educational work in the Muslim emirates&#151;a field which he was thereafter to make his own during a long and successful career. In 1910 he was appointed the first director of education in Northern Nigeria. His initial objectives were to open a government school at Kano for training teachers, and to institute a school to provide technical instruction in local agriculture and crafts. He also organized a class for the sons of local chiefs, to familiarize them with European teaching, and to foster good relations within the emirates. He set to work with what Marjorie Perham later described as &#145;enthusiastic idealism&#146;  (Parkinson, 9). After studying what was being done in the Sudan and elsewhere in the region, and despite his evangelical background, Vischer sought to adapt Western educational ideas to local African values and traditions.<br>
<br>On 31 January 1911 Vischer married Isabelle von Tscharner (1884&#150;1963) from Bern; they had four sons. Isabelle shared his love for the Hausa, and between 1912 and 1914 they lived in &#145;a large, rambling mud-brick house &hellip; surrounded by examples of local arts and crafts&#146;  (Parkinson, 11). A popular figure among the Hausa, Vischer became known as Dan Hausa (&#145;son of Hausa&#146;). During this period he built up an ethnographic collection that he later presented to the Basel Museum f&uuml;r V&ouml;lkerkunde, run by an uncle.<br>
<br>Vischer's educational work in Nigeria was unfortunately cut short by the onset of the First World War, but his achievements, though modest, were enlightened, and provided a model for later expansion. Between 1915 and 1919 he served in military intelligence, and from May 1917 was based in Bern with the rank of major. Because of ill health and a desire to be with his young family, however, he chose not to return to the colonial service after the war, but sought other employment in Britain. In 1923 he was approached by J. H. Oldham, the influential secretary of the International Missionary Council, with a view to becoming secretary of the newly established advisory committee on native education in tropical Africa. Vischer's blend of colonial service and commitment to the cause of educational progress in Africa, allied to his linguistic ability in European and African languages, made this an ideal appointment. The committee's role was expanded in 1929 to cover education in the colonies, and Vischer then shared the workload with a joint secretary, Arthur Mayhew. Part of Vischer's role was to provide the committee with up-to-date information on conditions in Africa, and to keep in touch with educational authorities throughout the continent. Through his wide contacts and travels during the following two decades Vischer was able to promote his educational ideals. He played an important role in the investigation carried out by the committee that resulted in the report <span class="italic">The Place of the Vernacular in Native Education</span> (1927). He made important recommendations for the recruitment, training, and selection of education officers; and he also tried to organize support and hostels for African students studying in Britain.<br>
<br>A skilled linguist himself, Vischer was instrumental in the foundation of the International Institute of African Languages and Culture in 1926, and served as its honorary secretary-general until 1945. In this role he worked closely with scholars and missionaries on projects that aimed to transform oral African languages into literate ones. In particular, he played a key role in running the institute's bureau, which produced textbooks for African schools and a quarterly journal, <span class="italic">Africa</span>. He himself continued to write and speak about comparative colonial education and Hausa linguistics. From 1931 he helped organize a series of pioneering social and anthropological studies in Africa, funded by the Rockefeller Institute. His concern was not so much academic as social, writing that &#145;if we are to be true to our ideal these studies must further a practical and human cause, the progress of the African&#146;  (Parkinson, 28).<br>
<br>With the onset of the Second World War, Vischer again served in intelligence. He nevertheless ensured the institute's survival, and it resumed full working from 1 January 1943. During the war he worked for the department of propaganda to enemy countries, and served as its liaison officer with MI6. In addition he broadcast in Hausa, French, and English on the BBC West Africa Service on a variety of subjects ranging from Britain's allies to the colour bar, &#145;a subject about which he had strong feelings&#146;  (Parkinson, 37). He was made a CMG in 1936, and knighted in 1941. Early in 1945 Vischer was invited to Paris to meet the new French minister for the colonies, but unfortunately caught a chill which led to pneumonia. He returned to Britain, and died at his home, Tykeford Lodge, Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, on 19 February 1945.<br>
<br>Vischer devoted his life to the progress of education in Africa. With his cosmopolitan background and strong sympathy with African culture, he made an important contribution to the evolution of British educational policy. As Sir Ralph Furse wrote, &#145;Hanns was unique. So was his contribution to the modern colonial story&#146;  (Parkinson, 1).<br>
