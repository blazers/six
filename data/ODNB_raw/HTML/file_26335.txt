<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stebbing,  Henry</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1687, <em>d.</em> 1763), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious controversialist</span>, was baptized at Malton in Suffolk on 19 August 1687, the fourth son of John Stebbing (1647&#150;1720), a grocer of Malton, and his wife, Mary (<i>c</i>.1652&#150;1721), daughter of Richard Kenington. Educated at Merchant Taylors' School, London, he entered St Catharine's College, Cambridge, as a sizar on 24 February 1705, and graduated BA in 1709, MA in 1712, and DD in 1730. He was elected a fellow of his college on 19 October 1710, but resigned in 1713, when he was presented to the rectorship of Lower Rickinghall, Suffolk. In or before 1716, when his eldest son was born, Stebbing married the daughter of Robert Camel, of Eye, in Suffolk; they had two sons. From 1718 to 1726 he served as rector of Wortham in Norfolk, and on 31 May 1726 he was instituted rector of Garboldisham, in the same county. He was appointed a lecturer at St Mary-le-Bow, London, in 1731 and, on 14 July of that year, preacher to Gray's Inn. He was chaplain-in-ordinary to the king in 1732 and was installed archdeacon of Wiltshire on 19 July 1735, becoming chancellor of Sarum in 1739. He was Boyle lecturer between 1747 and 1749, and was made rector of Redenhall with Halston, Norfolk, in 1748.<br>
<br>Stebbing was a fearless controversialist who wrote against latitudinarian divines, dissenters, and Methodists, as well as deists and freethinkers. A strict high-churchman, he vigorously opposed a number of prominent clergymen who dissented from his particularly tenacious variety of Anglican orthodoxy. He took the high-church side in the Bangorian controversy, opposing the latitudinarian views of Benjamin Hoadly, bishop of Bangor, whom he saw as encouraging a dangerous degree of religious independence which would vitiate the chances of salvation that Stebbing insisted could only be attained through belief in, and visible commitment to, the doctrines of Christ's church on earth. The first of the tracts he devoted to this matter, <span class="italic">Remarks upon a position of the right reverend the bishop of Bangor concerning religious sincerity</span> (1718), contained a preface in his support by Thomas Sherlock, then dean of Chichester. He continued the attack on Hoadly's anti-authoritarianism with some asperity in <span class="italic">A defence of the first head of the charge of the committee of the lower house of convocation against the right reverend the lord bishop of Bangor</span> (1718) and in <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Observations</span> (1718). The latter was condemned in turn for obscurantism by Thomas Pyle in <span class="italic">An Answer to Mr. Stebbing's Miscellaneous Observations</span> (1719), provoking Stebbing to a testy and very closely argued reply in which he argued the case for an established faith against that for religious independence. Towards the close of his reply Stebbing accurately remarked, &#145;Now I am at last got through a piece of Work, the most tedious of any I ever yet undertook in my whole Life&#146;  (H. Stebbing, <span class="italic">The True Meaning and Consequences of a Position of the Right Reverend the Lord Bishop of Bangor Concerning Sincerity</span>, 1719, 70). John Balguy, writing under the pseudonym Silvius, wrote two short tracts that lamented Stebbing's uncharitable brand of orthodoxy and thereby sounded a note that was to become familiar among Stebbing's numerous opponents, both Anglican and dissenting.<br>
<br>Aside from ill-tempered encounters with Quakers, largely over the nature of baptism, Stebbing next clashed with Dr James Foster, whom he accused of excusing heresy as a form of religious sincerity. In <span class="italic">A Letter to Mr. Foster on the Subject of Heresy</span> (1735) he claimed &#145;I do not love <i>hard Words</i>, Sir, nor will I run the Hazard of burning my Fingers&#146;  (p. 15), to which Foster replied that he at least would argue his case with decency, attributing to Stebbing a style and a manner that revealed &#145;captiousness, and petulance, <i>dictatorial</i> airs, and <i>academic</i> pertness and puerility&#146;  (p. 2). The controversy between the two men continued in this vein into 1737, and large excerpts from their entertainingly vituperative exchange of pamphlets appeared in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> in 1735 and 1737. The opportunity that this gave for anticlerical comment in the religiously contentious 1730s was seized upon by several writers, both satirically and regretfully. An anonymous poem attributed to a Quaker author, Mrs Drummond, but much more likely to be the work of an anonymous freethinker, identified the &#145;fierce&#146; Stebbing as &#145;nothing but a <i>Fleshly Priest</i>&#146; whose defence of orthodox doctrines was hypocritically self-interested and confessionally disastrous  (<span class="italic">The Female Speaker, or, The Priests in the Wrong</span>, 1735, 7&#150;8). In <span class="italic">St Paul's Heretic</span> (1735) Caleb Fleming similarly called on both Stebbing and Foster to promote the true interests of Christianity by being gentle with one another and meek with all other men.<br>
<br>Stebbing reserved his greatest anger for a series of encounters with William Warburton in the 1740s. In <span class="italic">An examination of Mr. Warburton's second demonstration, in his projected demonstration of the divine legation of Moses</span> (1744) he sought to undo Warburton's controversial claim that the doctrine of a future life was not declared to the Jews in the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, contending that in promoting it Warburton had done wrong to religion and given ground to unbelievers. In reply Warburton observed of Stebbing's characteristic style of reasoning: &#145;This puts me in Mind of the <i>Constable</i>, who being called in to appease a Quarrel, first knock'd down every one he met; and then said, &#147;Thus much to prevent Disorder&#148;&#146;  (W. Warburton, <span class="italic">Remarks on Several Occasional Reflections in Answer to the Reverend Doctors Stebbing and Sykes</span>, 1745, 69). Stebbing continued his assault on Warburton's readings of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> in <span class="italic">The History of Abraham</span> (1746), a text which also condemned the tone of Warburton's sermon on the Jacobite rising in 1745 in an implicit comparison with his own, delivered at Gray's Inn in 1745. This provoked a further reply from Warburton, who dismissed Stebbing as a high-flying divine, an outdated follower of Henry Sacheverell, whose ideas stood for nothing more in his &#145;Gothic System, than the Monkey-faces in your old Cathedral at Sarum&#146;  (W. Warburton, <span class="italic">An Apologetical Dedication to the Reverend Dr Henry Stebbing</span>, 1746, 7). Their fractious exchanges continued into the 1750s; Warburton identified Stebbing as one of the &#145;Inspectors General over Clerical faith&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 6.571). The Hutchinsonian divine Julius Bate had celebrated Stebbing's part in the battle with Warburton in his tract <span class="italic">The Faith of the Ancient Jews in the Law of Moses</span> (1747), which, unusually, defended Stebbing's argument, style, and decency but went on to criticize his notions of ancient Judaism.<br>
<br>Like Warburton, however, Stebbing had been an inveterate enemy of Methodism and freethinking. His 1739 sermon <span class="italic">A Caution Against Religious Delusion</span> proved popular, reaching six editions within a year. It met with a long reply from George Whitefield and a shorter one from John Wesley, and provoked Stebbing to further defences of orthodox notions of repentance and forgiveness. Stebbing devoted a great deal of energy to the repudiation of &#145;natural religion&#146;, which he read as a Hobbist variant of atheism. His first tract on the theme, <span class="italic">A Discourse Concerning the Use and Advantages of the Gospel Revelation</span> (1730), originally delivered in a fashionable London chapel, was a reply to Tindal's <span class="italic">Christianity as Old as the Creation</span>, a text to which he returned in <span class="italic">A Defence of Dr. Clarke's Evidences of Natural and Revealed Religion</span> (1731). Stebbing took on Thomas Chubb, the Salisbury freethinker, in his <span class="italic">Charge Delivered to the Clergy of the Archdeaconry of Wiltshire</span> (1739), to which Chubb replied in turn. The doctrine of providence was a particular favourite of Stebbing, and he returned to its powers in refuting freethinking in a sermon on the Lisbon earthquake in 1756, which he extended in <span class="italic">A Discourse Concerning the Governing Providence of God</span> (1757). The Boyle lectures, which he delivered between 1747 and 1749, were dedicated to an attempted refutation of freethinking; they appeared in print in 1750, with a notable reply to Middleton's critique of miracles, as <span class="italic">Christianity Justified upon the Scripture Foundation</span>.<br>
<br>Stebbing was convinced that freethinking would undermine the nation's morals, a subject with which he was much engaged in his style of churchmanship, as evinced in such early works as <span class="italic">A rational enquiry into the proper methods of supporting Christianity, so far as it concerns the governors of the church</span> (1720) and <span class="italic">An essay concerning civil government, considered as it stands related to religion</span> (1724); he continued to apply this in the sermons which he originally preached to the lawyers of Gray's Inn and later published in two volumes as <span class="italic">Sermons on Practical Christianity</span> (1759&#150;60). He played his part in the debate over Lord Hardwicke's <span class="roman">Marriage Act</span> (1753) in <span class="italic">A dissertation on the power of states to deny civil protection to the marriages of minors made without the consent of their parents or guardians</span> (1755). This proved a contentious deployment of the natural law arguments of Grotius and Pufendorf, and several replies appeared in quick succession; Nathaniel Forster's manuscript reply is in the British Library (Add. MS 11276). Stebbing had also published <span class="italic">A Brief Account of Prayer, and the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper</span> in 1739, which acted as a defence of religious duty against the fashionable onslaughts of infidelity.<br>
<br>Stebbing died at Gray's Inn on 2 January 1763 and was buried in Salisbury Cathedral, where a mural monument with a Latin inscription was erected to his memory. The elder of his two sons, <a name="cosubject_26336"></a><span class="headword">Henry Stebbing</span>  (1716&#150;1787), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was, like his father, educated at St Catharine's College, Cambridge, where he too became a fellow. In 1749 he succeeded his father as preacher to Gray's Inn. Ordained priest in December 1741, he served as vicar of Coton, Cambridgeshire (1744&#150;8), and as rector of Gimmingham and Trunch, Norfolk (1748&#150;87). He died on 13 November 1787. His <span class="italic">Sermons on Practical Subjects</span> (1788&#150;90) was published posthumously, edited with a memoir by his son Henry, a barrister. The elder Henry Stebbing's younger son, Robert (1719&#150;1800), was a fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, and ended his clerical career as the long-serving rector of Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire.<br>
