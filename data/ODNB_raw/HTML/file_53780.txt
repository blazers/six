<span class="headword">Savery,  Servington</span>  (<em>c.</em>1670&#150;<em>c.</em>1744), <span class="occ">natural philosopher</span>, was almost certainly born on the family estates at Shilston, near Modbury, Devon, the only child of Christopher Servington Savery, sheriff of Devon, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Colonel Cloberry, whom he married in 1669. Related through his grandfather to Thomas Savery, he belonged to a distinguished Devon family that traced its origins back to immigrants from Brittany in the early sixteenth century; his father, a fervent anti-papist, played an active role in William III's accession to the throne. In 1691 Savery married Elizabeth, the daughter of John Hale of Bowringsley and a close relative of Lord Chief Justice Hale; they had three sons and three daughters. He appears not to have been educated at university, unlike close relatives. Although he corresponded with London instrument makers and fellows of the Royal Society, he seems to have spent his entire life in Shilston, studying, experimenting, and inventing scientific instruments. Best known for his work on magnetism, Savery exemplifies the significant numbers of wealthy, reclusive, provincial natural philosophers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.<br>
<br>Savery started to experiment with magnets while still at school, and after several years of private research was encouraged by John Huxham to communicate his results to the Royal Society. His long paper in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> (1730) summarized previous knowledge about magnetism, discussed practical techniques for magnetic experiments, and described an elaborate machine based on a rotating terrella (small spherical lodestone) to test theories about the magnetic structure of the earth. The most influential section of the paper concerned the production of artificial magnets from steel bars, introducing new techniques and giving detailed instructions. Savery's artificial steel magnets were important because they provided the first reliable, cheap substitutes for natural lodestone, essential for remagnetizing compass needles on long voyages and for carrying out experiments. Although lacking influence because he was operating from a distance, Savery was respected in metropolitan circles for his work. However, unlike his successor Gowin Knight, he gained little personal advantage from his magnets, which were marketed in Exeter and London by the Lovelace family.<br>
<br>In addition, Savery devised a telescope that had two adjustable object glasses and incorporated a micrometer, and engaged in lengthy correspondence with George Graham about it. Graham used Savery's instrument to measure the diameter of the sun, and recommended it to Lord Macclesfield and James Bradley, the astronomer royal. But it was not until 1753 that James Short arranged for Savery's paper to be published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>, and not until about 1755 that John Dollond built a Savery heliometer. Savery's other inventions included a barometer with a sensitive measuring device based on alcohol floating above the mercury.<br>
<br>A descendant of Savery recorded that this &#145;man of a very studious turn of mind, and of very retir'd habits: amusing himself in philosophical pursuits&#146; died when he was about seventy-four, presumably at Shilston  (J. Savery, fols. 83, 92).<br>
