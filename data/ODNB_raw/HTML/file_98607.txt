<span class="headword">Nuttall,  Anthony David <span class="st"> [Tony]</span></span>  (1937&#150;2007), <span class="occ">literary scholar</span>, was born on 25 April 1937 at 150 Whitecross Road, Hereford, the younger son of Kenneth Nuttall, schoolteacher, and his wife, Hilda Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Addison. His brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/93149/', "Jeff Nuttall (1933&#150;2004)")</script> was a celebrated figure in the 1960s counter-culture&#151;poet, artist, musician, and author of <span class="italic">Bomb Culture</span> (1968). The two boys enjoyed childhood together in rural Herefordshire, but if Jeff strayed far from his origins, Anthony, known as Tony, was always spiritually close to his roots, and remained devoted to long walks in the countryside until his death. He was educated at Hereford Cathedral School and Watford grammar school, and went to Merton College, Oxford, in 1955. There he formed a lifelong friendship with his fellow undergraduate Stephen Medcalf. Both read for classical moderations (in which both took seconds) before switching to study English (in which both graduated with firsts), both became literary scholars and critics, both taught at the University of Sussex, and both died in the same year. Nuttall's handsome, classical features and dark curly hair, coupled with his wit and charm, made him the heartthrob of &#145;half the girls at Oxford&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 8 Feb 2007). On 1 July 1960, at Leeds register office, he married Mary Donagh (<i>b</i>. 1933), a fellow student, later a secondary school teacher, daughter of Ernest Percy Donagh, engineer's toolmaker. They had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Nuttall retained strong interests in classics and philosophy, which he applied throughout his career to the analysis of English literature. His BLitt thesis (1963) was on the philosophical implications of Shakespeare's <span class="italic">The Tempest</span>, and formed the basis of his second book, <span class="italic">Two Concepts of Allegory</span> (1967). (His first was a short study of <span class="italic">The Winter's Tale</span>, published in Edward Arnold's <span class="roman">Studies in English Literature</span> series in 1966.) He had appreciative supervisors of his work in the philosopher and novelist Iris Murdoch and later the philosopher Tony Quinton. Indeed Murdoch described Nuttall and Medcalf as the most brilliant students she ever taught. But it was said that his path to a doctorate was blocked by the traditionalism of another well-known Oxford figure, Helen Gardner, who objected to the combination of philosophy with literary criticism.<br>
<br>Nuttall had begun lecturing at the University of Sussex in 1962, a year after its foundation, in an institution where interdisciplinarity, the mark of his early work, was embedded in the very structure and ethos of the university. He was appointed to a readership and chair at Sussex in 1970 and 1973 respectively, and to the horror of some colleagues took on the administrative role of a pro-vice-chancellor between 1978 and 1981. But growing responsibilities did not blunt the extraordinary range of his interests or the abundance of his publications. <span class="italic">A Common Sky: Philosophy and the Literary Imagination</span> (1974) examined the relationship between literature and the reality of the external world&#151;one of Nuttall's distinctive interests&#151;in Locke, Hume, Sterne, Wordsworth, and others. A study of <span class="italic">Crime and Punishment</span> in 1978 considered the murder committed by Raskolnikov as an experiment in philosophy. The book grew out of a course on the modern European mind that Nuttall had helped to devise and teach at Sussex. Two years later <span class="italic">Overheard by God</span>, a study of the devotional poetry of George Herbert, Milton, and Dante, considered how God could be made the subject of literature. <span class="italic">A New Mimesis: Shakespeare and the Representation of Reality</span> (1983) was published when the vogue for literary theory was especially intense and was an eloquent defence of traditional ways of thinking and writing about literature in opposition to the then rising tide of discourse analysis and Jacques Derrida's &#145;deconstructionism&#146;. Much of it was based on Nuttall's close reading of Shakespeare, but in its appreciative use of structuralism it was never merely traditional or reactionary. Nuttall's last book written at Sussex was his study <span class="italic">Pope's Essay on Man</span> (1984).<br>
<br>Nuttall seems to have grown weary of Sussex, perhaps as a result of disenchantment with student radicalism and some ignorant criticism of his work in a local student newspaper. His wife noticed that a fellowship in English at New College, Oxford, had just been advertised and Nuttall was duly elected in 1984, though he was much older than the norm for an appointment as a college tutorial fellow. He explained the reasons for his return to Oxford with a characteristic mix of truth and humour: &#145;I want to spend the morning in a library which has every book I could possibly want, and then have lunch in a pub not designed by Basil Spence&#146;  (<span class="italic">PBA</span>, 315). Though it entailed more teaching and a cut in salary as compared with his previous position, Nuttall thrived in collegiate life. The breadth of his interests and publications were well suited to the range of undergraduate teaching he now undertook and he was an inspiring, generous, indiscreet, and always entertaining tutor. In 1992 he was appointed to a personal chair at Oxford.<br>
<br>Despite Nuttall's new responsibilities, publications on the most diverse subjects, all written with his blend of philosophical rigour and playful, witty criticism, continued as before. A brilliant study of <span class="italic">Timon of Athens</span> (1989) was followed by a collection of his essays, <span class="italic">The Stoic in Love</span> (1989). <span class="italic">Openings: Narrative Beginnings from the Epic to the Novel</span> (1992) explored how works of literature start; his next work, <span class="italic">Why Does Tragedy Give Pleasure?</span> (1996), first delivered as the 1992 Northcliffe lectures at University College, London, analysed how tragic heroes come to their end and why we find that compelling. In his study of gnostic heresy in Marlowe, Milton, and Blake, <span class="italic">The Alternative Trinity</span> (1998), he returned to his earlier theme of the relations between literature and theology. A quite different subject then formed the basis of his penultimate book, <span class="italic">Dead from the Waist Down: Scholars and Scholarship in Literature and the Popular Imagination</span> (2003). It cleverly wove together the life and work of Isaac Casaubon, the Renaissance classical scholar; Mark Pattison, the nineteenth-century Oxford don who spent many years studying Casaubon, though he never completed and published his great work on the man; and the dessicated pedant Edward Casaubon, supposedly based on Pattison, who appears in George Eliot's <span class="italic">Middlemarch</span>. The book was dedicated &#145;to Oxford&#146;. Nuttall's final work, published posthumously, was <span class="italic">Shakespeare the Thinker</span> (2007), and in it he returned to his first theme and abiding interest: the place of philosophy in Shakespeare's works. In between his first and this last work Nuttall had followed his remarkably broad interests across four centuries of English literature, exemplifying the best traditions of humane criticism and close reading.<br>
<br>Nuttall was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1997. When he retired in 2004 he had to vacate his rooms in New College. The college bursar looked the other way when Nuttall found himself another room elsewhere in the college and began to &#145;squat&#146;. He was found there on 24 January 2007, having died from a heart attack. A Festschrift entitled <span class="italic">Thinking with Shakespeare</span>, composed of essays by his colleagues and friends and including &#145;The last word&#146; by Nuttall himself, was published shortly after his death. He was survived by his wife and children.<br>
