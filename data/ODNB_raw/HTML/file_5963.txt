<span class="headword">Collinson,  John</span>  (1757&#150;1793), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, the son of the Revd John Collinson of Bromham, Wiltshire, and his wife, Elizabeth, was born in Bromham on 19 July 1757. He matriculated at Brasenose College, Oxford, on 8 April 1775 but from July 1777 until June 1779 was intermittently resident at the Queen's College. He was made deacon by the bishop of Oxford on 21 November 1779 at the request of Thomas Meyler, to whom Collinson had offered his services. Meyler, who described him as &#145;an ingenious, sober and well-behaved youth&#146;  (Wilts. &amp; Swindon HC, D1/14/17), employed Collinson as his curate at Preshute and Marlborough between January and August 1780.<br>
<br>Collinson did not proceed to a degree but in 1779, before ordination, published his first book, <span class="italic">The beauties of British antiquity: selected from the writings of esteemed antiquaries with notes and observations</span>. In June 1780 he issued proposals, never fulfilled, for a history of Wiltshire, for which he had been collecting material for three years.<br>
<br>Probably late in 1780 Collinson moved to Cirencester where, on 25 March 1781, he married Mary Hill (<i>d</i>. 1787). In the following December he was licensed as curate there, and was appointed vicar of Clanfield, Oxfordshire, in 1782. His antiquarian studies, probably undertaken in the library of the second Earl Bathurst at Cirencester Park, were evidently made in association with Samuel Rudder, the Gloucestershire historian, and with Joseph Kilner, collector of material on Cirencester. In June 1784 Collinson was admitted a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London with the support of Daines Barrington, William Boys, and Edward Hasted.<br>
<br>In August 1781 Collinson issued a prospectus for a history of Somerset, but the project was apparently abandoned a year later because he found that the papers of John Strachey, an earlier historian of the county, were not available to him. New proposals were issued in October 1784 under which Collinson's historical material, to be collected from a variety of sources, was to be combined with a contemporary survey to be made by Edmund Rack, then secretary of the Agricultural and Philosophical societies of Bath.<br>
<br>In August 1787 Collinson became vicar of Long Ashton and perpetual curate of Whitchurch, both on the Somerset side of Bristol. He moved to Long Ashton with his young son, John, some time after the death of his wife, Mary, in Cirencester in November 1787. <span class="italic">The History and Antiquities of the County of Somerset</span>, in three volumes, was published in 1791 and gave rise to much criticism. It was, however, based on much accurate unpublished work of earlier antiquaries, some now lost, though on only a limited use of Rack's survey, most of which survives, with evidence of Collinson's use, among the archives of the Smyth family of Long Ashton at Bristol Record Office.<br>
<br>Collinson died after a &#145;lingering illness&#146;  (<span class="italic">Notes and Queries for Somerset and Dorset</span>, 15, 1916, 84) at the Hotwells, Bristol, on 27 August 1793, and was buried at Long Ashton on 1 September.<br>
