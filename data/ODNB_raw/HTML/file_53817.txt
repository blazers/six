<span class="headword">Rymer,  James Malcolm</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseuds. </em>M. J. Errym, Malcolm J. Merry]</span>  (1814&#150;1884), <span class="occ">novelist and journal editor</span>, was born in Holborn, London, on 1 February 1814 (gravestone, Kensal Green; private information, D. Collins), the second son in the family of five sons and one daughter of Malcolm Rymer (<i>b</i>. 1775), engraver and printseller, and his wife, Louisa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dixon (1783/4&#150;1868), a milliner. His parents were of Scottish descent. He married, on 27 April 1839, Caroline (1821&#150;1853?), daughter of John Huttly, boot and shoemaker, with whom he had a son. His first interests were in mechanics; in 1840 he was granted a patent for an improved furniture castor, and in 1841 was listed as a civil engineer living at 42 Burton Street, St Pancras. He soon became, however, one of the most prolific writers of popular fiction in mid-nineteenth-century Britain, although he never published under his own name, choosing instead to employ a number of pseudonyms, the most common of which were M. J. Errym and Malcolm J. Merry, but which also included Marianne Blimber, Nelson Percival, J. D. Conroy, Septimus R. Urban, Bertha Thorne Bishop, and Captain Merry USN. Rymer also appears to have had skills as an engraver, as in 1854, with his son Francis Chadwick, he ran Rymer &amp; Co., lithographers, at 16 Red Lion Square. Some of his own fiction was illustrated by woodcuts with distinctive quality and panache, probably indicating the hand of the author.<br>
<br>In the late 1830s the publisher Edward Lloyd was pioneering fiction for the expanding working-class urban readership, a public which by his profession Rymer knew well. In 1841 Lloyd published Rymer's <span class="italic">Adeline, or, The Grave of the Forsaken</span>, a vivid &#145;domestic&#146; tale, and two years later <span class="italic">Ada the Betrayed, or, The Murder at the Old Smithy</span> became the lead serial in <span class="italic">Lloyd's Penny Weekly Miscellany</span> for 1843. The success of the novel helped establish the popularity of the penny issue form and Lloyd's fortune. Rymer combined powerful melodrama with narrative skills learned from mainstream writers, and Ada, in particular, has a touch of Dickens's Oliver Twist about her as, with parentage unknown, she preserved her innocence through the perils of a criminalized city. Rymer's successive works showed range as well as suspenseful plotting. <span class="italic">The Black Monk, or, The Secret of the Grey Turret</span> (1844) updated both Ann Radcliffe and Walter Scott for his semi-literate readers, while he supplied a contemporary interest in social issues with <span class="italic">The White Slave: a Romance for the Nineteenth Century</span> (1845). Writing anonymously, and adapting some earlier sources, Rymer created two of the most enduring icons of Victorian popular culture. <span class="italic">Varney the Vampyre, or, The Feast of Blood</span>, distantly related to John Polidori's <span class="italic">The Vampire</span> (1819), created a sensation when serialized by Lloyd in penny numbers, and established the aristocratic vampire in the public imagination. Contemporaneously, Rymer may have written <span class="italic">A String of Pearls, or, The Barber of Fleet Street</span>, a work also attributed to Thomas Peckett Prest, for Lloyd's <span class="italic">People's Periodical and Family Magazine</span>. This innocuously titled tale introduced the cannibalistic Sweeney Todd and Mrs Lovett into popular fiction and drama. Rymer was now one of Lloyd's most prolific writers, probably urged on by the need to recover from bankruptcy in February 1847.<br>
<br>In the 1850s Lloyd's publications were becoming superseded for the adult reader by the more sophisticated popular fiction offered by the publisher John Dicks, in particular the novels of G. W. M. Reynolds. In 1858 <span class="italic">The Life Raft: a Tale of the Sea</span> by &#145;M. J. Errym&#146; appeared in <span class="italic">Reynolds's Miscellany</span>. Rymer became one of Dicks's major authors. His most popular titles exploited the current taste for criminal historical romances, but he remained versatile. It is claimed, on the strength of his accurate delineation of American scenes, that he visited the United States, and from the early 1860s his stories appear in the expanding genre of American dime novels. These were published under a bewildering variation of pseudonyms and titles. <span class="italic">The Raft and the Spray</span> was reissued four times, with different titles and attributions. His later writings included the lost novel <span class="italic">A Mystery in Scarlet</span> (which appeared in serial form in the <span class="italic">London Miscellany</span>, 1866), a work that delighted the young Robert Louis Stephenson.<br>
<br>Rymer was said by Thomas Catling to have written up to ten stories simultaneously, and has been credited with over 120 titles, mostly published anonymously or under pseudonyms. Rymer also edited a number of periodicals, including the short-lived <span class="italic">Queen's Magazine</span> (1842) and <span class="italic">Lloyd's Weekly Miscellany</span> (1845). On his death he left two scrapbooks inscribed &#145;Tales and Sketches Contributed by James M. Rymer to Various Periodicals&#146;. These indicate a very different style from that of <span class="italic">Varney the Vampyre</span>&#151;essays in the style of Leigh Hunt, and some accomplished short stories, suggesting that through his pseudonyms he carefully concealed his alternative career as a sensational author. Following the death of his first wife, he married on 6 July 1859 Sarah Rebecca (1824&#150;1909), formerly a governess, daughter of William Carpenter, gentleman. They had a son, who died in 1865. He died on 11 August 1884 at Lawn Cottage, Shepherd's Bush Green, London, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
