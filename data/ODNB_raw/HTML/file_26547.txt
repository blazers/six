<span class="headword">Stockton,  Owen</span>  (1630&#150;1680), <span class="occ">nonconformist minister</span>, was born in Chichester, Sussex, on 31 May 1630 and baptized on 3 June in the cathedral there, where his father, Owen Stockton (1577&#150;1635), held two prebends. He was the fourth son of his father and Elizabeth (<i>bap</i>. 1592), daughter of John Tyler of Soham, Cambridgeshire, and his wife, Catherine. Owen senior, the second son of Owen Stockton of Cuddington, Cheshire, was sometime fellow of Pembroke College, Cambridge, and held the rectory of East Lavant, Sussex, from 1612 and his prebends from 1614, both for life. Upon his death in 1635 his widow moved to Ely, where Owen was educated at the grammar school. Owen claimed that a sermon by Richard Vines, intruded master of Pembroke College, was the cause of his conversion, and he will have seen Cromwell order his headmaster, William Hitch, out of the cathedral pulpit, a more seminal experience evidently than being presented, with other boys, to Charles I, who remarked &#145;Here's a little scholar indeed, God bless him&#146;  (Fairfax, 3). At Christ's College, Cambridge, from January 1646 his tutor was Henry More, the Platonist, and he graduated BA in 1649, migrating to Gonville and Caius College on appointment as a junior fellow by the parliamentary commission in 1651. He became a senior fellow in 1652, proceeded MA the following year, and was successively morning lecturer, Hebrew lecturer, steward, and catechist in the years 1651 to 1654. Taking up the study of divinity in London he read theology at Sion College, attended the Gresham lectures, and heard popular preachers; he received presbyterian orders in London on 20 February 1655. As a layman he had preached in villages around Cambridge lacking ministers, and from July 1656 did so fortnightly in St Andrew's Church, Cambridge. He was chosen town lecturer at Colchester by the mayor and aldermen in 1657, giving a morning lecture at St James's Church, as well as afternoon and weekday lectures elsewhere, until officially silenced by the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> of 1662. In 1658 Stockton gave up his fellowship at Gonville and Caius on marrying, on 9 June, that &#145;most suitable yokefellow&#146;  (Fairfax, 2), Elianor (1627/8&#150;1712), one of four daughters of Roger Rant of Swaffham Prior, Cambridgeshire, all of whom married staunch nonconformists. Stockton and his wife had six children, four of whom died as infants.<br>
<br>After his ejection, in 1662 Stockton and Edmund Warren established a dissenting congregation in Colchester, meeting in the castle by consent of its owner, Speaker Lenthall. Stockton also risked preaching in his own house until St Bartholomew's day 1665, when he moved his wife and family to Chattisham, Suffolk. Here Daniel Meadows, the elder brother of John Meadows, ejected minister of Ousden, whose wife Anne was Elianor's sister, lived at Chattisham Hall. The Stocktons were given a house and grounds large enough for them and Stockton's sister, Sarah, and Stockton's brother Thomas managed the land around. Owen's first published work, <span class="italic">Counsel to the Afflicted</span>, was published in 1667, and for a time he was allowed by John Maidstone, vicar of Chattisham in 1663&#150;71, to preach in the church occasionally. Stockton frequently visited Colchester, Manningtree, White Colne, and other places in Essex, and sometimes narrowly escaped arrest for preaching, once at Colchester being warned by the constable, one of his flock. In 1669 Stockton was reported to Archbishop Sheldon for holding a conventicle in Colchester, and the next year John Maidstone, no longer friendly, presented him in the ecclesiastical court. A second publication, <span class="italic">A Treatise of Family Instruction</span>, appeared in 1672, and at the indulgence of that year Stockton immediately took out three licences, for Ipswich, Colchester, and Hadleigh in Suffolk. That for Ipswich allowed him to be &#145;a Presbyterian and Independent teacher in Grey Friars House in St Nicholas parish&#146;  (Browne, 367), where he shared the work with Henry Havers, ejected from Fyfield, Essex. On alternate Sundays he preached at Colchester, and occasionally in John Smith's house at Hadleigh. He lived latterly at Ipswich, where on 31 August 1680 fever struck him. He died in Ipswich on 10 September and was buried two days later in the nave at Chattisham. His funeral sermon, <span class="italic">The True Dignity of St Paul's Elder</span> was preached by John Fairfax, his successor at Ipswich. The published text (1681) is appended to a long account of Stockton's life, quoting extensively from the introspective and self-condemnatory content of his manuscript diaries, which with others of his writings and his wife's diary are in Dr Williams's Library. Two posthumous works were published, a funeral sermon for Mrs Ellen Asty (1681) and, echoing Samuel Ward's much earlier <span class="italic">Woe to Drunkards</span>, <span class="italic">A Warning to Drunkards</span> (1682). By his will Stockton endowed a fellowship and a scholarship, and left his library, to Gonville and Caius College, and legacies to his brother William and cousin Owen. His daughter Sarah should, he stipulated, &#145;attire herself in a sober manner as becometh one professing godliness&#146;  (will). Should she die in her minority an annuity of &pound;20 at Harvard College, Massachusetts, would train a convert Indian to preach the gospel in his language. Sarah married Isaac Jermy and died in 1708, aged forty-two. Owen's widow lived to be eighty-four. She died on 3 May 1712 and was buried with her husband three days later; their inscribed ledger slab lies under the altar table at Chattisham.<br>
