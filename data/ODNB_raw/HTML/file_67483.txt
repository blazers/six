<span class="headword">Cohen,  Kenneth Herman Salaman</span>  (1900&#150;1984), <span class="occ">intelligence officer</span>, was born on 15 March 1900 at 1 Lower Terrace, Branch Hill, Hampstead, London, the son of Jewish parents, Herman Cohen (1860&#150;1932), a barrister and official reporter of cases heard by the court of criminal appeal, and his wife, Bessie Salaman (1873&#150;1950). He was educated at Elstree School and then at Eastbourne College before joining the Royal Navy as a &#145;special entry&#146; cadet in 1918. He subsequently served on HMS <i>Iron Duke</i>, and later became an expert on torpedos. In 1935, as an interpreter in French and Russian, he transferred to the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS). On 22 July 1932 he married Mary Sarah (1910&#150;1991), daughter of Ernest Martin Joseph, architect, with whom he had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Soon after joining SIS Cohen was placed in charge of the London headquarters of a European network known simply as Z, which operated under commercial cover in parallel to the more overt SIS organization that depended upon a string of passport control offices attached to diplomatic premises abroad. Masquerading as Keith Crane and designated Z-2, Cohen worked through a front company, Menoline Ltd, in Maple Street, and an office in Bush House, to recruit sources, including several distinguished foreign correspondents of British newspapers in France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, and Italy.<br>
<br>Upon the outbreak of war Z's assets were amalgamated into SIS's main organization and Cohen was attached to the French country section known as A5, becoming head of the Vichy section, designated P1 in May 1940. His task was to recruit sources from within the unoccupied zone of France, and one of his successes was Jacques Bridou, who was parachuted into France in March 1941 to establish the Alliance network, based in Pau and Marseilles and later to be headed by the formidable Marie-Madeleine Meric.<br>
<br>In summer 1943, in anticipation of an invasion of Europe, Cohen was selected to take charge of Brissex, the British component of a large scheme, codenamed Sussex, to parachute sixty two-man allied intelligence teams behind enemy lines. This huge paramilitary enterprise was intended to disrupt Nazi communications and logistics immediately after D-day and then liaise with local resistance organizations until overrun by the allies. The role played by Cohen required considerable tact and diplomacy because the American volunteers were inexperienced and the French intransigent.<br>
<br>Cohen was appointed CMG in 1946, and in the aftermath of the war he held senior posts in SIS (chief controller of Europe and director of production). He retired in 1953 and was created CB. With his &#145;sensitivity, astringent mind and understanding of international problems&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>) he served as European adviser to United Steel Companies from 1953 to 1966. During the last twenty years of his life his main interest was in promoting cross-channel friendship, and he served as chairman of the Franco-British Society from 1967 to 1972. He died in the Westminster Hospital, London, on 19 September 1984.<br>
