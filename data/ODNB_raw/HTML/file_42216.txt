<span class="headword">Wastell,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1518), <span class="occ">master mason</span>, was probably born <i>c</i>.1460. He first appears in 1485 in Cambridge with <a name="cosubject_42216"></a><span class="headword">Simon Clerk</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1489), then <span class="occ">master mason</span> of King's College chapel, in association with a contract for work on the church at Walden, Essex. Considering Clerk's great age, Wastell may have been guarantor for the completion of the contract. Wastell dined with the fellows at King's on several occasions from 1486, and by at least 1496 was master mason for King's Hall (now Trinity College), where contemporary work includes the lower facade of the present great gate. Concurrently, he probably designed the new nave for the college's town church, Great St Mary's. The elevations of St Mary's display common and unusual links with the nave of Walden church, built after Clerk's death. Between 1486 and 1490 Wastell settled in Bury St Edmunds, where Clerk had been master mason for the abbey since <i>c</i>.1445. Wastell's continued residence in Bury, and his documented role in its public life, might suggest that he succeeded Clerk as the abbey's master mason. Certainly, he received a corrody or pension from the abbey at some date after 1514.<br>
<br>In the early 1490s Wastell designed the central tower of Canterbury Cathedral for Archbishop John Morton (<i>d</i>. 1500), whose links with Wastell may have been established when bishop of Ely. The great tower, completed before 1509, underwent dramatic changes during construction, resulting in a doubling of its height after Easter 1494. Two years later Wastell was styled master mason for the cathedral when admitted to its monastic confraternity. By this time, essential work was required on the nave, including the strainer arches and the recasting of the eastern piers. Wastell's last contribution to the tower was the fan vault, a work of consummate beauty and strict control. It resembles closely the vaults of the eastern chapels, or New Buildings, at Peterborough Abbey, after 1496, and the tiny Redmount Chapel, Bishop's Lynn, <i>c</i>.1506 both probably attributable to Wastell on stylistic grounds.<br>
<br>While in Cambridge in 1506, Henry VII determined to complete the chapel of his uncle Henry VI's scheme at King's College. Before leaving the city, Henry gave a reward to John Wastell, who was presumably present. Work began in 1508 and over the next seven seasons, the antechapel was built almost from the foundations, the choir completed, the vaults made, and the exterior finished. The work is recorded in a series of fixed-term, fixed-price contracts that make clear Wastell's architectural authorship and supervisory responsibility. The elevational design for the antechapel was inherited from the work of the first master mason, <a name="cosubject_42223"></a><span class="headword">Reginald Ely</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1471)<span class="occ"></span>, with only minor amendments, but the awkward fit of the vault, plus alterations made to the upper sections of the choir bays completed by Clerk before 1485, make it clear that the fan vault is Wastell's alone. The close design links with Canterbury are obvious.<br>
<br>King's College chapel was completed in July 1515, by which time Wastell was perhaps fifty-five. His state of health may have been bad&#151;references within several of the contracts make provision for his death or possible infirmity&#151;and he seems to have undertaken no new major works after King's, though he designed a tomb for the duke of Norfolk in mid-1516, to be housed at Thetford Priory (lost). Other works attributable to Wastell on firm stylistic grounds include the south aisle of Great Barton church, Suffolk, <i>c</i>.1490, the nave of Lavenham church, after 1502 (perhaps a workshop product), St James's Church at Bury, from 1503, and the tomb of Archbishop William Warham (<i>d</i>. 1532), erected in Canterbury Cathedral in 1507.<br>
<br>Wastell had at least two sons and several daughters with his wife, who was probably called Margaret. One son, Thomas, is mentioned in the Cambridge contracts in connection with possible profit sharing in the event of his father's death. Another boy, John, apparently the architect's son, was a student of civil law at Cambridge from 1503/4&#151;Henry VII paid his exhibition in 1506 by way of reward. Judging by his will, the younger John died in 1515, recently married but with no children. He owed money to London and Cambridge booksellers and made bequests to several known Cambridge academics plus a gift for the adornment of King's College chapel. As for his father, in 1518 a &#145;widow of John Wastell&#146; was permitted to settle in Westgate (St Dunstan's), Canterbury. In the same year the architect was described in Bury records as recently dead; it is possible that he was buried at St Mary's Church, Bury. As his widow lived within the archbishop's manor, her new residence may have been arranged by Archbishop Warham.<br>
