<span class="headword">Bennett,  Sarah</span>  (1797&#150;1861), <span class="occ">governess</span>, was born at Spalding, Lincolnshire, on 4 March 1797; her mother was the daughter of a tradesman, her father an architect and builder. Her father died aged thirty-eight, leaving a family of eight children and a ruined business. Sarah, the eldest daughter, was seven at the time of her father's death, and was sent by her godfather, a solicitor at Spalding, to his sister's school at Camden House, Kensington, London, to be educated as a governess, then the main respectable occupation for impoverished ladies. She worked for a number of wealthy families, and seemed to be establishing a stable career. In 1817, however, her former Camden House teachers moved to Spalding and invited Sarah to assist them in running their new school, which she dutifully did for eight years, until the school closed. She then returned to work in private families, entering on her last and longest engagement in 1827 with the daughters of a general. When her situation concluded in 1837, she moved to Melton Mowbray, where much of her family lived, to open a private school, for day and boarding scholars, with a friend, Miss Baldwin.<br>
<br>Sarah Bennett's stress in education was on religious instruction&#151;hence the title of the memoir published in 1862 after her death, <span class="italic">The Christian Governess</span>. While not against an education in the social graces, she refused to include dancing, which she dismissed as &#145;ungodly&#146;, in her curriculum, publishing a short pamphlet, <span class="italic">Worldly Amusements</span> (which can be found in the appendix of the 1862 memoir), explaining her objections. She believed that dancing encouraged vanity and frivolity and discouraged domesticity among young girls, and that it was particularly injurious for the lower orders. Her educational methods, however, were not severe: instead she stressed love, example, firmness, careful attention to religious duties, and punctuality. She tried to enliven lessons by means of anecdote, and to cater for different levels of ability. She also encouraged her elder pupils to engage in charitable work, as she did, in visiting the poor. An Anglican with strong evangelical convictions, she raised funds for a school in Larne, co. Antrim, where protestants and Catholics were educated together, in the hope of ridding Ireland of &#145;Popery&#146;  (Bennett, 94), and she sought to convert Jews (through the London Society for Promoting Christianity amongst the Jews and the London Philojudaean Society). She was also a supporter of the temperance movement, publishing a pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Snare: its Danger</span> (apparently in the late 1830s, and included as an appendix to the 1862 memoir). When she retired in 1852, with hearing and sight impaired, the school closed. She spent much time visiting former pupils as well as family, and continued her charitable activities, including work with blind people for which she learned to read with Moon's embossed characters. Moon type (based on the Latin alphabet, invented in 1845 by William Moon of Brighton) was especially useful for older, newly blind people for whom Braille was too difficult to feel, and proved beneficial as her own sight deteriorated.<br>
<br>Sarah Bennett exemplified Hannah More's (1745&#150;1833) ideal of the dutiful and virtuous middle-class single woman, timid and yet resolute in her faith, always busy, a dedicated philanthropist of the poor and teacher of young ladies, for whom the appearance of being learned was anathema. Her letters (a selection of which are included in the 1862 memoir) give only vague hints of the difficulties encountered by governesses in fitting into a new family. The extent of her correspondence to former pupils, family, and missionaries (profits from the memoir were dedicated to the Church Missionary Society) gives an indication of the esteem in which she was held, especially as a role model for young ladies in similar straitened circumstances. Her memoirist, her nephew the Revd George Bright Bennett (1830&#150;1890), records that after a full working life dedicated to serving others, Sarah Bennett had accumulated only enough to ensure a small annual income, which may explain her itinerant life, staying with friends and family, once the school closed. She died at Nuneaton on 12 March 1861 in the home of a former pupil, and was buried in Birmingham's Anglican cemetery, in her brother's family vault.<br>
