<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Harte,  (Francis) Bret</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Francis Brett Hart]</span>  (1836&#150;1902), <span class="occ">author</span>, was born on 25 August 1836 in Albany, New York, the third child of Henry Philip Hart (1800&#150;1845), who conducted a private school in his home, and Elizabeth Ostrander Hart. His paternal grandfather was Bernard Hart, an English Jew who had emigrated to New York via Canada and married, in 1799, Catherine Brett, of English and Dutch ancestry. They separated after their only son was born.<br>
<br>Henry Hart added an &#145;e&#146; to his surname and moved to wherever he could find paying pupils. Young Frank claimed to have attended eight different schools in eight cities before dropping out in New York city at thirteen to work, as his father had died and his mother could no longer afford the luxury of tuition. When she remarried in 1854 (her new husband was a Californian, Andrew Williams), Bret&#151;as he now called himself&#151;followed the family across the United States to Oakland.<br>
<br>Seeking employment at eighteen, Harte drifted in and out of jobs&#151;some of which he later may have invented&#151;as tutor, typesetter, goldminer, and &#145;shot-gun&#146; on a stage coach, penning poetry all the while. He confided to his diary that he intended to make a livelihood by writing. His opportunity came while he was a &#145;printer's devil&#146;&#151;compositor&#151;for the weekly <span class="italic">Northern Californian</span> in Uniontown, where he filled empty spaces with his own verse and prose, often using Western dialect. Composing sketches while typesetting, he recalled, compressed his style. His six years along the Humboldt River, source of a lifetime of material, would turn that segment of the West, in the popular mind, into &#145;Bret Harte country&#146;.<br>
<br>When, as the <span class="italic">Californian</span>'s sub-editor, Harte denounced a massacre of peaceable Indians by local &#145;diggers&#146; in early 1860, the ire of the white establishment cost him his job, but his frontier experience shaped his writing. His stories and verse would scorn the greed, corruption, lawlessness, brutality, and hypocrisy of miners and ministers, bankers and sheriffs, merchants and politicians. Gamblers, prostitutes, and other social outcasts, open in their ways, were by contrast more worthy.<br>
<br>In San Francisco he contributed to the weekly <span class="italic">Golden Era</span>, often under the pseudonym the Bohemian, and also worked as compositor for this journal. In 1868 he moved to the <span class="italic">Overland Monthly</span> as its first editor. One paper for which he wrote, the San Francisco <span class="italic">Call</span>, employed a writer, Samuel Clemens (Mark Twain), who claimed, before the two had a falling out, that he learned his craft from Harte.<br>
<br>Irony with a realistic texture, yet softened by sentimentality, was the hallmark of Harte's style. Typical of his best fiction was his nativity parable &#145;The Luck of Roaring Camp&#146; (August 1868), published in the second issue of the <span class="italic">Overland Monthly</span>. In a mining camp a prostitute, Cherokee Sal, dies in childbirth, leaving an infant christened by the miners Thomas Luck. For the boy, who is being bottle-fed with ass's milk, they import a rosewood cradle. A metamorphosis begins. They wash, plant flowers, eschew profanity. The &#145;Ingin&#146; baby survives into spring, when melting snow and rain inundate the foothills. A flash flood sweeps away the cabin in which Kentuck, a miner, is sleeping with &#145;The Luck&#146; in his arms. Vanished also may be the brief moment of civilization.<br>
<br>Harte's verse is remembered for &#145;Plain Language from Truthful James&#146;  (<span class="italic">Overland Monthly</span>, September 1870), popularly known as &#145;The heathen Chinee&#146;. In a satiric condemnation of racism&#151;Chinese immigrant labour was abused in the West&#151;the inscrutable Ah Sin confounds the prejudices of narrator and reader by outwitting at euchre two &#145;Anglo&#146; card-sharks. Although Harte would dismiss it as &#145;possibly the worst poem anyone ever wrote&#146;  (Stewart, 181), it was widely reprinted.<br>
<br>Early success had brought Harte into contact with local worthies eager to sponsor him. He received two regional sinecures&#151;with the surveyor-general and then with the United States mint. His rising status led to his marriage, on 11 August 1862, to Anna Griswold, who was four years his elder. With local fame came mannerisms at odds with his uncouth subject matter. So transformed, Harte would not have been out of place in a London club in Pall Mall; he wore elegant clothes and affected a nasal voice.<br>
<br>Publication in the eastern USA led to an invitation from Fields, Osgood &amp; Co. of Boston for Harte to furnish a minimum of twelve contributions annually to its magazines, which included the <span class="italic">Atlantic Monthly</span>. The $10,000 contract was the most lucrative up to that time in American publishing. When he left California with his family he was at the top of his form, but like Antaeus of Greek mythology he would be enervated by separation from the vital soil. He overspent, resorting then to fictional formulas which seemed parodies of past writings. His agreement was not renewed, compelling him to concoct sketches often refused by once-eager editors. He took up lecturing from 1872 to 1875 to augment his dwindling earnings, delivering &#145;The argonauts of '49&#146; &#151;on gold rush California&#151;150 times, but receiving little over expenses. Simultaneously, he struggled to create stage vehicles from his stories, but the plays were stillborn. One, <span class="italic">Ah Sin</span>, based upon his &#145;heathen Chinee&#146; character and with Mark Twain as collaborator, also failed. Mutual recriminations ended their association.<br>
<br>With his career reduced to desperate hack work, Harte appealed to influential acquaintances for a diplomatic post in the tradition of Washington Irving, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and James Russell Lowell, even ridiculing his own efforts in the pages of the New York <span class="italic">Sun</span> as the Office-Seeker. He floated, the Boston <span class="italic">Traveller</span> quipped, &#145;on the raft made of the shipwreck of his former reputation&#146;. Rescue came via an appointment as consul in the Rhenish town of Crefeld on the Rhine. On 28 June 1878 he left his wife, two sons, and two daughters in New Jersey, never to return to the USA.<br>
<br>Crefeld regenerated Harte's pen. While he sent his salary &#145;home&#146; to his wife, whom he had all but divorced, he wrote clich&eacute;d frontier stories as well as fiction about an American innocent abroad in &#145;Sammstadt&#146;. The Germans were enthusiastic. In translation he would become one of the most popular American-born writers there. Yet he did not learn German and appealed for a post where English was spoken. Despite his unconcealed absenteeism he was transferred in August 1880 to Glasgow, where he would encounter even gloomier weather than that of which he had complained in Crefeld, and impenetrable English. (Harte would call Glasgow &#145;a damp cellar&#146;.) He would also abandon business to aides, spending so much time in London that 562 letters and telegrams from him to his Glasgow office are recorded during the five years of his assignment.<br>
<br>Harte's plunge in reputation in the United States had not affected his esteem in Europe. He had already appeared, on 1 May 1880, at the Royal Academy's annual meeting to reply to the toast to literature. In his writings in Britain, where he would live out his remaining years, Glasgow became &#145;St Kentigern&#146;. London editors, however, preferred his more exotic frontier tales, and commissioned them. Eager for further income once his consular salary ceased in 1885&#151;for he had to send maintenance payments to Anna&#151;he turned again to the theatre. Plays promised continuing receipts; stories earned only a fee. Assisted by Marguerite Van de Velde, the wife, then widow, of a Belgian diplomat in whose home at 74 Lancaster Gate in London he usually lived, he collaborated, between 1882 and 1885, upon three plays based upon his fiction&#151;<span class="italic">Thankful Blossom</span>, <span class="italic">The Luck of Roaring Camp</span>, and <span class="italic">A Frontier Penelope</span>. Up until 1897 he wrote eight other plays, mostly with T. E. Pemberton, a knowledgeable stage technician. One, <span class="italic">Sue</span>, an adaptation of Harte's &#145;The Judgment of Bolinas Plain&#146;, actually had twenty-eight performances at the Garrick Theatre beginning on 29 June 1898, following earlier brief runs in Boston and New York.<br>
<br>Harte continued to collect in book form his increasingly benign short stories, many featuring his favourite character, Colonel Culpepper Starbottle. His fiction written in London, like his plays, increasingly betrayed his distance in time and place from &#145;Bret Harte country&#146;. Yet whatever his inaccuracies, his vision of the gold rush days in the West had mapped it for countless English readers.<br>
<br>Parody remained Harte's m&eacute;tier. In 1867 he had published <span class="italic">Condensed Novels and Other Papers</span>, influenced by Thackeray's parodies in <span class="italic">Punch</span>. Perhaps his cleverest was &#145;Lothaw&#146; (1870), mocking Disraeli's <span class="italic">Lothair</span>. <span class="italic">Condensed Novels, New Burlesques</span> (1902), in which his later parodies were collected, satirized, among others, Conan Doyle, Kipling, Caine, Marie Corelli, and, in &#145;Rupert the Resembler&#146;, Anthony Hope's <span class="italic">The Prisoner of Zenda</span>. Stoical in his last illness (throat cancer after decades of smoking strong cigars), he warned his wife, who had finally sailed to England in 1898 but whom he declined to see, that his income was &#145;precarious&#146; and that she could expect little. He wrote anxiously for the McClure syndicate in the United States, which supplied Sunday supplements&#151;and dollars&#151;though in London his work was still welcome in such prestigious monthlies as the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span> and <span class="italic">The Strand</span>.<br>
<br>An exploratory operation in March 1902 confirmed that Harte's cancer was inoperable, and he returned to the care of Marguerite Van de Velde. On 17 April he rallied enough to begin &#145;A Friend of Colonel Starbottle&#146;. It remained a fragment. Following his death on 5 May 1902 at the Red House, Camberley, Surrey, he was interred in the churchyard at Frimley, Surrey, where Marguerite Van de Velde arranged the obsequies and ordered the tombstone. Also at the funeral, however, and uncontested now, was Anna Harte. To her, Harte left all his assets&#151;his copyrights and &pound;360.<br>
<br>His English writings were less deft than his brilliant early fiction, but Harte never abandoned his rude West, merely rearranging his familiar characters within their recognizable settings. Beginning as a frontier Dickens, he faded with failed ambition into inadvertent self-parody. Still, the vision of the frontier he defined remained potent enough to leave its impact upon fiction, drama, and film thereafter. Five years after his death the melodrama <span class="italic">Salomy Jane</span>, drawn from his &#145;Salomy Jane's Kiss&#146;, was a long-running West End hit. Film after film in the silent era emerged from his fiction, and his characters have since stereotyped the mythical West.<br>
