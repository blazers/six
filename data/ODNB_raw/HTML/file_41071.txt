<span class="headword">Alsager,  Thomas Massa</span>  (1779&#150;1846), <span class="occ">financial journalist and businessman</span>, was born on 27 September 1779, probably at Southwark, Surrey, the fifth of the nine or ten children of Thomas Alsager (1738?&#150;1790), a setter in the cloth trade, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Crosby (<i>d</i>. after 1790) of Southwark. The source of his unusual second name is unknown, but it may be derived from Massey, a common surname around Audley, Staffordshire, where the Alsager family originated.<br>
<br>Little is known of Alsager's formal education, though he probably attended school at Congleton, Cheshire, between the ages of five and eleven, returning to London after his father died. Three years later he began a seven-year apprenticeship as a setter in the family business at Southwark, stretching semi-finished cloth to the width then required by law. Alsager appears to have prospered in the twenty years or so after 1800, and his interests grew to include a bleaching works at Faringdon.<br>
<br>If, as seems likely, Alsager was largely self-educated, the results were remarkable. He was a first-rate scholar and linguist, and it was said that he could perform competently on all the instruments of the orchestra. By 1813, the date of his first recorded meeting with Charles Lamb, Alsager was clearly both comfortably situated and highly cultivated&#151;doubly qualified to become an associate of the so-called Elian circle around Lamb. His contribution was not on a par with Coleridge or Wordsworth, but he was a congenial host and a good listener, qualities that were much appreciated. He was a good friend to Leigh Hunt when he was imprisoned in 1813. It was Alsager's copy of George Chapman's <span class="italic">Homer</span>, loaned to John Keats in 1816, which inspired the latter to write &#145;On First Looking into Chapman's Homer&#146;. It was also Alsager, in 1818, who was largely responsible for persuading William Hazlitt to deliver his celebrated <span class="italic">Lectures on the English Poets</span>. On 30 May 1823 Alsager married Elizabeth Roper (<i>d</i>. 1845), when she was seventeen. They had thirteen children in all, eleven daughters and two sons, of whom eight daughters and one son survived infancy.<br>
<br>Alsager's closest friend, also from Southwark, was the journalist Thomas Barnes, who had been appointed editor of <span class="italic">The Times</span> in 1817. In the same year, at the age of thirty-eight, Alsager joined him, taking up the post of City correspondent and supplying music criticism from time to time. When John Walter (1776&#150;1847), the chief proprietor, sold some of his shares in 1819 Alsager bought a modest interest in <span class="italic">The Times</span>. By the end of the year he was ensconced in the paper's newly established City of London office, from where he began to report and comment on the markets. Alsager &#145;appears to have been the world's first financial editor&#146;  (&#145;Financial journalism&#146;).<br>
<br>The craze for financial speculation in 1825 stimulated the demand for news from the City, and most of the leading London dailies responded. <span class="italic">The Times</span>, which published Alsager's &#145;money article&#146; on a daily basis from 1825, was soon regarded as &#145;the chief authority on these matters, and became the favourite medium for circulating official and semi-official communications&#146;  (Marks, 1904). Alsager's City intelligence was regarded as highly reliable; he had good connections and was close to the Rothschilds. His views, especially as they related to the currency, foreign investment, and joint-stock banking, were rather conservative.<br>
<br>Alsager became an increasingly important figure at Printing House Square after 1827, when he purchased a partnership in <span class="italic">The Times</span>. He was by then already known as the joint manager, with William Delane. <span class="italic">The Times</span> prospered under their stewardship until the mid-1840s. It seems likely that Alsager's most important contribution, apart from drawing in financial advertising through the prestige achieved by his money article, was to accelerate the flow of news from abroad by developing &#145;express&#146; channels of communication exclusive to <span class="italic">The Times</span>.<br>
<br>As his career flourished, Alsager moved to the fashionable West End, first to a house in Mecklenburg Square, described by Lamb as &#145;almost too fine to visit&#146;, and then, in 1830, to 26 Queen Square, Bloomsbury. He also appears to have maintained a home in Kingston, Surrey. His lifelong devotion to music could now be indulged munificently, and Queen Square was the venue for an influential series of recitals which led eventually to the formation of the Beethoven Quartet Society. Alsager was particularly devoted to Beethoven's music, and sponsored, in 1832, the first performance in England of the mass in D. Mendelssohn was one of a number of distinguished European participants in Alsager's musical matin&eacute;es.<br>
<br>Alsager's other great interest was the Worshipful Company of Clothworkers, which he entered after completing his apprenticeship, eventually becoming master in 1836&#150;7. Having discovered that the company had neglected its duties in administering various charitable trusts, he undertook painstaking research to clarify the position and, despite some opposition, instituted a system of monitoring committees to ensure that the company avoided further embarrassments of this kind. It was transformed into one of the most efficiently run of the City livery companies.<br>
<br>Having achieved eminence as a journalist Alsager's demise was especially tragic. He was widely praised when <span class="italic">The Times</span> punctured the bubble of railway speculation in November 1845, though at least one rival newspaper claimed that he had a personal interest in creating a bear market. There were also damaging accusations that <span class="italic">The Times</span> had puffed the Direct London and Exeter line, in which Alsager and Delane held shares. A year later, in October 1846, Alsager left <span class="italic">The Times</span> under a cloud, having been accused by the chief proprietor of misrepresenting the financial position of the printing department. Though this did not amount to more than a complacent acceptance of Delane's creative accounting, the termination of his connection with the paper he had served for almost thirty years was a damaging blow. The depression which afflicted him following the death of his wife a year earlier intensified, and on the first anniversary of her funeral, 6 November 1846, he attempted to take his own life, using a knife to cut his throat and slash his left wrist. He lingered until 15 November, when he died exhausted. The coroner resisted pressure to declare that Alsager had been of unsound mind in his last days which would have spared his family the ignominy of a midnight burial. He was buried at Kensal Green.<br>
