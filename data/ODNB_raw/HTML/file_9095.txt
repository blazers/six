<span class="headword">Fairfax, Sir  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1610, <em>d.</em> 1644), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer</span>, was baptized in Steeton Chapel, Bolton Percy, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, the second son of Sir Philip Fairfax of Steeton (<i>bap</i>. 1586, <i>d</i>. 1613), and his wife, Frances Sheffield (<i>d</i>. 1615), daughter of Edmund, Baron Sheffield and earl of Mulgrave, and his wife, Ursula. Sir Philip's extravagance at court left the estate in debt, and William was raised by his grandmother, Mabel, Lady Fairfax, after the early death of both his parents. He was probably the William Fairfax who matriculated at St John's College, Cambridge, in 1625, graduated BA in 1628, and was created MA in 1633. In 1629 he married Frances Chaloner (1610&#150;1692/3), daughter of Sir Thomas Chaloner of Guisborough in Cleveland, and sister of the regicide Thomas Chaloner. In appearance Fairfax was a very tall man with dark eyes and brown hair.<br>
<br>Fairfax was knighted by Charles I at Whitehall on 1 June 1630. On the death of his elder brother Edmund in 1636 he succeeded to the family estates at Steeton and Newton Kyme, and he settled at Steeton in 1640. In July 1641 he accepted a captaincy in his uncle Ferdinando, second Baron Fairfax's regiment of trained bands and by October he was serving as a West Riding JP. He accompanied his cousin Sir Thomas Fairfax (later third baron) to confront the king with a parliamentarian petition on Heworth Moor outside York on 3 June 1642.<br>
<br>William Fairfax probably already possessed considerable military experience, for in August 1642 he travelled south to assume command of an infantry regiment in the earl of Essex's parliamentarian army. He fought at Edgehill, where most of his regiment fled &#145;in despight of the officers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Two speeches of the Lord Wharton</span>). Accompanied by his officers, he joined Lord Fairfax's northern army at Selby in December 1642. Sir William raised a new regiment around Bradford, and commanded the parliamentarian infantry at the capture of Leeds on 23 January 1643. He was briefly governor there, before delivering Lord Fairfax's offer of protection to the queen at Bridlington. On his return his forces occupied Pontefract town, where they blockaded the castle during March 1643. He was among the victorious commanders at Wakefield on 21 May, where the royalist Sir George Goring was captured. Fairfax was in London questioning Goring on 11 August. In November he travelled to King's Lynn to persuade the earl of Manchester to advance against the royalists at Chesterfield, and wrote to his wife from Boston: &#145;for Thomas's partt and mine we rest neither night nor day, nor will willingly till we have done God some good service against his and our enimyes&#146;  (Markham, <span class="italic">Life of Robert Fairfax</span>, 14). He commanded a wing of cavalry at Nantwich on 25 January 1644, and was subsequently engaged in the siege of Lathom House. In May, recovering from a fever, he joined the allied army before York, and he commanded an infantry brigade on the allied right at Marston Moor on 2 July.<br>
<br>In August 1644 Fairfax was sent into Lancashire with 2000 cavalry and was present at the siege of Liverpool. He was mortally wounded relieving Montgomery Castle on 18 September 1644, and died the following day. Lord Fairfax reflected: &#145;blessed be God, the victory obtained over our enemies doth abate my sorrow for any particular friends&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1644</i>, 529), while Sir William's widow &#145;grieved not that he died in the cause, but that he died so soon that he could do no more for it&#146;  (Markham, <span class="italic">Life of Robert Fairfax</span>, 23). In 1647 he appeared as third on a list of slain parliamentarian worthies  (J. Ricraft, <span class="italic">A Survey of England's Champions and Truths Faithful Patriots</span>, 1647, 155). He died without making a will to provide for his children so parliament voted his widow &pound;1500. On 7 September 1655 the council of state voted a further &pound;2000 from his pay arrears.<br>
