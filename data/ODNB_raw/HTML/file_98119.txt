<span class="headword">Strickland, Sir  (Edward) Peter</span>  (1869&#150;1951), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Snitterfield, Warwickshire, on 3 August 1869, the third son of Major Frederick William Strickland (1814/15&#150;1885) of the Warwickshire regiment and his second wife, Frances Annie (Fannie), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pattison. Educated at Warwick School, he was commissioned second lieutenant in the Norfolk regiment on 10 November 1888, before joining the 2nd battalion, with whom he saw active service in the Burma campaign (1887&#150;1889). He was promoted lieutenant on 29 April 1891.<br>
<br>In common with many officers of his generation Strickland served with the Egyptian army, from 1 April 1896 to 31 March 1903, participating in the Dongola expedition (1896), the Berber expedition (1897), and the Nile expedition (1898), where he took part in the battles of Atbara and Omdurman. In 1899 he also took part in operations in south Kordofan, under the command of Francis Reginald Wingate, on the White Nile against Ahmed Fedil's army, for which he was appointed DSO. He was promoted captain in 1899, and was appointed brevet major. He returned to colonial service in Africa on 3 February 1906, joining the West African Frontier Force, and saw service later that year in operations in Northern Nigeria. Promoted major on 8 September 1908, he assumed command of the Northern Nigeria regiment in 1909, returning to regimental duty in England in 1913.<br>
<br>Promoted lieutenant-colonel, on 1 June 1914 Strickland was given command of the 1st battalion, the Manchester regiment, part of the Jullundur brigade in the Lahore division of the Indian army, which along with other units of the Indian corps arrived in France in September 1914. In December 1914 his battalion was involved in heavy close-quarter fighting near the village of Givenchy, and though they took several German trenches they had to retreat in the face of a co-ordinated German advance, on 21 and 22 December. He took command of the Jullundur brigade at the start of 1915, and led it through the battle of Neuve Chapelle, and at the second battle of Ypres in April 1915. He remained in France after the departure of the Lahore division and was given command of the 98th brigade, 33rd division, at the end of 1915.<br>
<br>In June 1916 Strickland took command of the 1st division in succession to Major-General Sir Arthur Holland, following the latter's failure to capture Hulluch during the battle of Loos. Strickland led his division through some of the hardest fighting of the war, in the battles of the Somme, in the defence of Nieuport against a surprise attack by the Germans in July 1917, in which units of the 1st division incurred heavy losses, and in April 1918, at Lys, where it held the German advance after the almost complete destruction of two Portuguese divisions. Finally Strickland's division formed part of the Fourth Army in the allied advance of August to November 1918.<br>
<br>On 17 July 1918 Strickland married Barbara Cresswell (1884&#150;1977), widow of Captain Francis Joseph Cresswell, a friend and fellow officer in the Norfolk regiment; she was the daughter of Martin William Browne ffolkes. They had a daughter, and there were two daughters from his wife's previous marriage.<br>
<br>Twice wounded during his period in France, Strickland emerged from the First World War with a reputation as a capable and competent commander. He was created KCB in 1919 and took part in the occupation of Germany as the commander of the western division of the British army of the Rhine from March to September 1919. In November 1919 he was sent to Ireland and took command of the 6th division, which was responsible for supporting the Royal Irish Constabulary in Munster and in Kilkenny and Wexford. As the Anglo-Irish conflict intensified in 1920, the British army became a key target of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), with Strickland's division bearing the brunt of the fighting on the British side.<br>
<br>During 1920 and 1921 Strickland's troops in Ireland fought a counter-insurgency campaign that proved to be a model for future British twentieth-century campaigns. One of the innovations in his command was the development of British flying columns, termed active service platoons, to conduct small-unit operations against the IRA. He faced real physical danger in Ireland, survived an assassination attempt on King Street in Cork in September 1920, while at Clonbannin in March 1921 an IRA attack on a British column, with the intention of targeting Strickland, resulted in the death of the commanding officer of its Kerry brigade, Hanway Cumming.<br>
<br>Unofficial reprisals and breaches of military discipline were a problem for Strickland from the beginning, with relations between the soldiers and the inhabitants of certain towns, such as Fermoy and Queenstown, being poor. He warned units in Fermoy and Queenstown over their future conduct, and reportedly even threatened the commanding officer of the Cameron Highlanders with dismissal if any further outbreak occurred. He expelled auxiliary members of the Royal Irish Constabulary from the city of Cork after they had burned a substantial part of the city centre on the night of 11 December 1920 in retaliation for an ambush. He was commissioned to investigate the Cork incident, but his report, blaming the auxiliaries, was suppressed by Lloyd George's cabinet in February 1921. His private papers record his bitterness with the British government over the conduct of the campaign, and the loss of life on all sides.<br>
<br>Martial law was proclaimed in four counties of Ireland on 11 December 1920 and was extended to a further four counties on 4 January 1921, an area corresponding to that under the control of Strickland's 6th division in Munster, Kilkenny, and Wexford. As military governor in these counties, where a state of armed insurrection was declared to be in place, Strickland became responsible not just for military operations but also the administration of law and order. He was empowered to give orders for military courts to try offenders, who were liable to the death penalty for the unauthorized possession of arms. The vast majority of the executions of members of the IRA following courts martial were carried out in his command. His powers were the subject of legal challenge in July 1921 when the truce ended armed activity. As the last soldier to exercise control of a substantial area of the United Kingdom under martial law and to impose the death penalty for rebellion against the crown, Strickland occupies a notable place in constitutional history.<br>
<br>Strickland remained in Ireland until May 1922, after which he assumed command of the 2nd division at Aldershot in 1923. He was created KBE in 1923, his wife also being made DBE in recognition of her public services during the previous three years of her husband's service in Ireland. He was promoted lieutenant-general in 1926. In 1927 he went to Egypt, to become general officer commanding the British forces in Egypt, a force charged with the protection of the Suez Canal. He retired from the British army in 1931, and died at his home, the Old Hall, Snettisham, Norfolk, on 24 June 1951.<br>
