<span class="headword">Lok,  Michael</span>  (<em>c.</em>1532&#150;1620<span class="mult">x</span>22), <span class="occ">mercer, merchant adventurer, and traveller</span>, was born in Cheapside, London, the youngest of five surviving sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16951/', "Sir William Lok (1480&#150;1550)")</script> and his second wife, Catherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cooke (<i>d</i>. 1537), and the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67979/', "Rose Throckmorton")</script>. By his own account Lok was taught in &#145;scoles of grammar&#146; until he was thirteen, and was then apprenticed to his family's mercery business in Flanders. He remained there until about 1552, when he and his brothers, moved by their father's death and the Antwerp trade crisis of 1550&#150;51, began to seek more distant, innovative markets for their wares. The Loks were devout converts to protestantism, and during Mary Tudor's reign Michael remained abroad, travelling to France, Scotland, Spain, Portugal, Venice, the Greek islands, and the Levant, acting as his brothers' factor and trading on his own behalf. During this time the sight of the wares of the New World and Far East made a powerful impression on him; it was from this period that Lok himself dated his abiding obsession with the expansion of English commercial activities through the discovery and exploitation of new markets  (Cotton MS, Otho E VIII, fols. 41&#150;3). He collected a significant library of travel literature, charts, and other cosmographical data, to a value of some &pound;500, which he later put at the disposal of Richard Hakluyt the younger during the preparation of his <span class="italic">Divers Voyages</span> (1582).<br>
<br>Lok returned to England at the accession of Elizabeth I. In 1562 he was admitted to the Mercers' Company, and about this time married Joan (<i>d</i>. 1571), daughter of Sir William Wilkinson, sheriff of London; they had eight surviving children. He continued to practise his mercery trade in London, and from 1571 to 1576 he was London agent of the Russia Company  (Willan, 26&#150;7). In 1574 he was approached by Martin Frobisher, with whom he may have had a prior acquaintance through his brothers' involvement in the Guinea voyage of 1554, in which Frobisher had sailed as a young man. Together they prepared a proposal to the privy council, to discover a sea route to &#145;Cathay&#146; via the north-west. They secured a licence to attempt this from the Russia Company, whose charter privileges they were technically infringing, and secured investors from the city and court. For want of sufficient funds to dispatch a voyage during 1576, Lok was obliged to provide loans of over &pound;800 from his own pocket. Two further voyages to Baffin Island followed, in which the queen herself invested, but the enterprise degenerated into a search for gold, incurring large losses (most spectacularly for Lok himself). Frobisher turned violently against Lok, whom he blamed for his own misfortunes, and led moves to impeach him for alleged financial irregularities. Effectively bankrupted, with his name on transactions entered into on behalf of his fellow adventurers, Lok was cynically abandoned to fight a series of creditors' suits. He went to debtors' prison upon at least eight occasions, and claimed to have seen the inside of every London gaol save the Fleet&#151;to which he was also committed subsequently.<br>
<br>By this time Lok had fifteen children or stepchildren. He had married in 1576 or 1577 his second wife, Margery (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1583), widow of Cesare Adelmare and mother of Julius Caesar Adelmare, later judge of the high court of admiralty. Lok emerged from prison for the final time in 1581 and spent most of the rest of his remarkably long life vainly attempting to recover some part of his former fortune and reputation.<br>
<br>In 1587 Lok was in Ireland on unspecified business, though so penurious that he was obliged to send his son Benjamin back to England to raise money to bring him home to fight a suit against one of his rare debtors. In 1591 he took up a four-year tenure as the Aleppan consul of the Turkey Company, where he immediately alienated all the company's merchants by enforcing the letter of its regulations scrupulously. On the initiative of the company's governor, Sir John Spencer (a distant relative), he was dismissed without compensation. Lok fled to Venice and initiated a suit in the courts there for compensation, which effectively paralysed the company's trade in the Levant. Finally, on the privy council's urging, Lok accepted a compromise settlement of &pound;300 in 1601.<br>
<br>Lok retired from his business activities soon after returning to England on Christmas day 1602. He continued his studies, however. In 1612 he translated the last five decades of Peter Martyr's <span class="italic">De orbe novo</span> for a new edition published by Thomas Adams as <span class="italic">De Novo Orbe, or, The Historie of the West Indies</span>. For Samuel Purchas he made a translation from Spanish, the <span class="italic">Mexican History in Pictures</span>, and wrote a brief commentary, <span class="italic">Note on the Strait of Sea Commonly called Fretum Anian, in the South Sea</span>. As late as 1615 Lok was being sued for a debt of &pound;200 incurred during the north-west enterprise. Little is known of his life subsequent to this, but the inquisition post mortem on his estate was conducted only in 1623, and he died in Cheapside, &#145;at the sign of the lock&#146;&#151;possibly his birthplace also&#151;between 1620 and 1622. Lok's eldest sons, Zachary, Benjamin, and Matthew, predeceased him, and their wills (particularly the debts they forgive) offer ample evidence of their father's continuing penury. Lok's reputation remained poor; he is regarded as the role model for the merchant Shylock by those who regard the earl of Oxford as the author of the <span class="italic">Merchant of Venice</span>  (Willan, 27). Hakluyt was more perceptive, regarding him as &#145;a man for his knowledge in divers languages &amp; especially in Cosmographie, able to doe his country good, &amp; worthie in my judgment for the manifold good partes in him, of good reputation &amp; better fortune&#146;  (Hakluyt, 11).<br>
