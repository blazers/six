<span class="headword">Webbe,  Samuel, the younger</span>  (1768&#150;1843), <span class="occ">musician and composer</span>, was born on 15 October 1768 in London, the fourth child and the eldest of the three sons of the seven children of the musician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28933/', "Samuel Webbe the elder (1740&#150;1816)")</script> and his wife, Anne Plumb. His first musical education was from his father, who as the leading figure in Roman Catholic church music in London introduced him at an early age to the music of the embassy chapels and to other Catholic musicians. He may also have studied with Muzio Clementi. His early professional career was as a singer and a performer on the violin, oboe, and trumpet. He took part as a tenor in the Handel commemoration concerts in 1784, and sang in the chorus in the Academy of Ancient Music concerts in the 1787&#150;8 season.<br>
<br>Webbe followed in his father's footsteps as a Roman Catholic church musician, and by the time of his election to membership of the Royal Society of Musicians in 1791 he was already organist of the Bavarian Chapel. Like his father he was also a successful composer of glees and catches; his numerous published compositions also include piano and organ music, and church music for both the Roman Catholic and Anglican rites. Either he or his father was the composer of the operatic farce <span class="italic">The Speechless Wife</span>, performed at Covent Garden on 22 May 1794. It is probable that he and his father were also active in radical politics in the 1790s as members of the London Corresponding Society.<br>
<br>About 1798 Webbe moved to Liverpool, where he became organist of the Unitarian chapel, Paradise Street. On 7 October 1803 he married Diana Smith (<i>d</i>. 1843) at St John's Church, Old Haymarket, Liverpool; they had at least three children. One of their daughters, Louisa, married the writer on music <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13591/', "Edward Holmes")</script> in 1857. Their son <a name="cosubject_58122"></a><span class="headword">Egerton Webbe</span>  (1810?&#150;1840), named after his uncle the Liverpool publisher Egerton Smith, was a <span class="occ">composer</span>, a man of letters, and a friend of Charles Cowden Clarke, Leigh Hunt, and Holmes. He wrote on music, literature, and ballet for the <span class="italic">London Journal</span>, <span class="italic">Bentley's Miscellany</span>, <span class="italic">Atlas</span>, <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, and <span class="italic">Musical World</span>, which he also co-edited with Holmes between October 1838 and April 1839. Egerton Webbe died of tuberculosis at Park Terrace, Wellington Road, Toxteth Park, Liverpool, on 24 June 1840.<br>
<br>Little is known of Samuel Webbe's activities in Liverpool. In 1810 or 1811, for reasons perhaps connected with the advancing years and failing health of his father, he returned to London and resumed his musical career there. He was active in the earliest years of the Philharmonic Society: he was one of its thirty original members at its foundation in February 1813, was a director for the 1815&#150;16 and 1817&#150;18 seasons, and played an active part in the autumn of 1815 in the negotiations with the Professional Concert about a possible merger of the two bodies. In 1817 he visited Dublin to observe the controversial system of piano teaching practised by Johann Bernhard Logier (1777&#150;1846), in which pupils were taught in groups using Logier's patent chiroplast, a device for holding the hands in the correct position while playing. On his return to London he set up his own academy according to Logier's principles. A demonstration of the system to members of the Philharmonic Society led to a lengthy and acrimonious public dispute: Logier was accused of charlatanry and Webbe's own integrity was called into question. He eventually resigned from the society in December 1817.<br>
<br>While in London, Webbe continued his career as a Roman Catholic church musician in the position of organist to the Spanish embassy chapel. In the late 1820s he returned to Liverpool, where he was successively organist of St Andrew's, Renshaw Street, St Nicholas's, and St Patrick's Chapel, Toxteth. He moved back to London in 1840 and died at Park Cottage, Hammersmith, on 25 November 1843. His wife had died a few weeks earlier.<br>
