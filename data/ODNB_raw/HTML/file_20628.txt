<span class="headword">O'Halloran,  Sylvester</span>  (1728&#150;1807), <span class="occ">surgeon and antiquary</span>, was born on 31 December 1728 at Caherdavin, co. Clare, Ireland, the third son of Michael O'Halloran, a substantial farmer, and Mary McDonnell. He attended a school in Limerick run by the Revd Robert Cashin and was taught Irish by the Jacobite poet Se&aacute;n Cl&aacute;rach MacDomhnaill, a distant relative. At the age of sixteen or seventeen he went abroad to study surgery, one of the few professions open to Roman Catholics in Ireland at the time. In London he studied the methods of Joseph Hillmer and Chevalier Taylor, both noted eye surgeons. He was in Paris in 1747&#150;8, during which time he attended the lectures of Antoine Ferrein. Tradition has it that he also studied in Leiden.<br>
<br>In 1749 O'Halloran returned to Limerick and set up practice. He married Mary Casey (<i>d</i>. 1782) of Ballycasey, co. Limerick, in 1752 and had five children, of whom <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20627/', "Joseph O'Halloran")</script> became a major-general with the East India Company. Sylvester O'Halloran was one of the founders of the County Limerick Infirmary which opened in 1761. His first medical work, published in 1750, <span class="italic">A Treatise on the Glaucoma, or Cataract</span>, showed his familiarity with the French literature of eye surgery, and suggested a modification of the current method of cataract treatment. <span class="italic">A New Method of Amputation</span> (1763) and <span class="italic">A Complete Treatise on Gangrene and Sphacelus</span> (1765), published immediately after the Seven Years' War, were directed particularly at the surgical problems posed by injuries sustained in battle, the former proposing a more efficient method of leg amputation. In an appendix to the latter work O'Halloran advocated the licensing of surgeons by public examination and the setting up of a teaching and examining body, and this may have played a part in the foundation of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland in 1784, of which he was elected an honorary member (equivalent to a later fellowship) in 1786. Despite this he felt he had been denied proper recognition by his fellow surgeons in Ireland, believing this neglect to be deliberate and due to his religion.<br>
<br>O'Halloran was unusually outspoken in his condemnation of the penal laws then in force against Roman Catholics and of what he felt was the hostile stereotyping of them as barbarous. All his medical writings adverted to these concerns, including <span class="italic">A New Treatise on External Injuries of the Head</span> (1793), in which he explained that the large number of head injuries that were presented to him had much to do with Irish hot temper, but that this national characteristic had been exacerbated by state oppression. By this stage O'Halloran had given up the thought of state preferment for his surgical works, but, na&iuml;vely, still had hopes that Edmund Burke could procure a civil pension for him in recognition of his antiquarian writing, which began as a pastime but came to have more importance for him in the 1770s and 1780s when the Catholic question was a crucial issue of debate in Ireland.<br>
<br>O'Halloran's first venture into antiquarianism was an article in the <span class="italic">Dublin Magazine</span> in January 1763 on the subject of James Macpherson's Ossian poems, in which he endeavoured to show that the poems were based on material that was originally Irish rather than Scottish. Privately he admired the poems and the heroic Gaelic world which Macpherson had presented in them. All of his own antiquarian works were concerned primarily with the military and heroic aspects of early Gaelic society. In <span class="italic">An Introduction to the Study of the History and Antiquities of Ireland</span> (1772) he argued that all the most distinctive laws, manners, and customs of Europe had originated among the Irish Celts, including the medieval concepts of knighthood and chivalry which had been spread by them throughout the continent. His <span class="italic">General History of Ireland</span> (1778) presented pre-colonial Ireland as a golden age of military valour and scholarly learning which was destroyed by the Anglo-Norman invasion. This was a reprise on a well-established theme in Irish historiography, but what set O'Halloran apart was his propensity for making direct links between the past and the contemporary political situation of the native population, and also the highly romantic colouring of his narrative. This latter was to make him an important influence on later nineteenth-century writers such as Standish O'Grady.<br>
<br>O'Halloran was made a member of the Royal Irish Academy in 1786 and contributed papers on medical and antiquarian matters to its <span class="italic">Transactions</span>. A portrait of him was published in <span class="italic">Dublin Quarterly Journal of Medical Science</span>, 6 (1848). He died in his home at Merchants' Quay, Limerick, on 11 August 1807 and was buried in the family vault at Kileely cemetery, Limerick.<br>
