</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Raffles, Sir  (Thomas) Stamford Bingley</span>  (1781&#150;1826), <span class="occ">colonial governor and founder of Singapore</span>, the eldest and only surviving son of Captain Benjamin Raffles (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1797) and his wife, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Anne Lyde (<i>d</i>. 1824), was born off Port Morant, Jamaica, on 6 July 1781, aboard his father's ship, the West Indiaman <i>Ann</i>. He numbered a seventeenth-century Sir Benjamin Raffles among his ancestors, and his paternal grandfather was a clerk for thirty years in the prerogative office, Doctors' Commons, London, but little is known about Raffles's childhood. He was christened for the second time&#151;on this occasion as plain Thomas&#151;by his uncle, the Revd John Lindeman, at Eaton Bishop in Herefordshire, on 4 July 1784. For two years he attended the reputable Mansion House boarding-school in Hammersmith, but had to leave in 1795 at the age of fourteen because of straitened financial circumstances. His father probably died about this time, leaving Anne to bring up Thomas and four younger sisters, and through a family connection she obtained him a temporary clerkship at East India House. A frail, diffident youth, Raffles's health suffered through the long hours of drudgery, but he also studied French in his own time, and his diligence impressed William Ramsay, secretary to the court of directors, whose son was Raffles's close friend. On 8 March 1805, on Ramsay's recommendation, Raffles was appointed assistant secretary to the government of the East India Company's newly elevated Penang presidency, with a salary leap from &pound;70 to &pound;1500 a year. One week later he married Olivia Mariamne Fancourt (1771&#150;1814), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Devenish, a Madras assistant surgeon's penniless widow, of Irish and possibly Indian extraction, who was ten years his senior but strikingly beautiful, vivacious, and intelligent. Sailing in April, they reached Penang on 19 September 1805.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyears"></a>Early years</h2>On the voyage Raffles taught himself Malay and soon embarked on a lifetime study of the history, flora, and fauna of the region. His meagre schooling left him with a passion for acquiring knowledge and cultivating the friendship of well-educated, clever men, such as Dr John Leyden, surgeon, naturalist, linguist, and Malay scholar, who was his house guest in Penang for three months in 1805&#150;6, and William Marsden, secretary to the Royal Navy, linguist and historian of Sumatra, with whom Raffles initiated a long correspondence in 1806.<br>
<br>Appointed Malay translator and registrar of the recorder's court, in addition to assistant secretary, Raffles fell ill under the strain, and in 1807 he was sent on sick leave to Melaka, which the East India Company had seized from the Dutch during the French wars. Its splendid fortress had already been razed following the directors' orders to demolish Melaka's public buildings and transfer the population to Penang, but the rest of the town was saved on Raffles's recommendation. Indeed, in a report submitted in 1808 he urged its permanent retention, and in 1810 he visited Calcutta, hoping to be appointed governor of the Dutch Moluccas, which had also been occupied by the company. This bid failed, but he impressed Governor-General Lord Minto with his offer to turn local rulers against the Dutch to aid the company's planned invasion of Java. Minto appointed Raffles his agent in the Malay states, accepted his recommendation to use Melaka rather than Penang as the base to prepare for the Java campaign, and posted him back there in December 1810 to gather intelligence and collect supplies.<h2>
<a name="InvasionandadministrationofJava"></a>Invasion and administration of Java</h2>With his customary industry and attention to detail, Raffles amassed voluminous information, sent agents to Madura, Bali, and Java, and won over the sultan of Palembang. On arriving in Melaka in May 1811, Minto approved Raffles's recommended invasion route and took him on his own ship when the fleet set sail the following month. As a civilian Raffles took no direct part in the military operations, which were commanded by Colonel Robert Rollo Gillespie, a brave soldier and admired war hero. But, to Gillespie's chagrin, when the Dutch administration capitulated in September 1811 Minto appointed Raffles as lieutenant-governor, with far-reaching powers and a council comprising Gillespie as the senior member and two Dutch officials.<br>
<br>Unlike the company and the British government, Raffles regarded Java not as temporarily occupied territory but as the permanent base for extending British influence through the rest of the eastern archipelago, and he set out quickly to dismantle the Dutch system of monopoly, compulsory deliveries, and protective tariffs. Early in 1812 Raffles sent Gillespie to seize the tin islands of Banka and Billiton, appointed British residents at the courts of Javanese rulers, remodelled the judicial administration, introduced a jury system, and in 1813 abolished forced labour in favour of money rents in a large part of Java.<br>
<br>Travelling widely to gather information about the history, languages, and products of Java, Raffles enlisted the help and supported the researches of American botanist Thomas Horsfield, who had already spent more than ten years in Java before the British invasion. He arranged for Horsfield to send specimens to the East India Company's museum in London and to Sir Joseph Banks, president of the Royal Society, who was collecting plants for the Royal Garden at Kew and for his own herbarium.<br>
<br>In February 1814 Raffles prepared a minute in council condemning the previous Dutch regime and claiming success for his land rent system, and that same month he recommended to Calcutta an ambitious scheme to extend British interests and appoint agents at all the leading ports in Borneo, Sulu, Riau-Lingga, Bali, east Sumatra, and as far afield as Siam, Cambodia, and Cochin China. Some modern-minded Dutch officials supported Raffles's land rent reform, but the unaccustomed new system resulted in a large financial loss of government revenue, and he resorted to selling government lands on his own authority to bolster a shaky paper currency.<br>
<br>Reducing the number of European troops as an economy measure brought conflict with Gillespie, who, on being posted back to Calcutta, brought charges before the governor-general in council in December 1813, attacking Raffles's whole administration and financial policy, accusing him of humiliating chiefs and regents, and of selling off government lands irresponsibly. Raffles submitted a detailed rebuttal in March 1814, which he also had privately printed in Batavia, and Gillespie was killed in action before judgment was given, but the accusations hung over Raffles for years. His remaining time in Java was fraught with troubles. Olivia's sudden death in November 1814 left Raffles distraught, and she was buried in the European cemetery at Batavia beside the grave of their friend John Leyden, who had died of malaria during the Java invasion. Meanwhile his patron, Minto, died in June 1814, and the new governor-general was critical of Raffles's financial record. In August 1814 Britain and the Netherlands signed a convention agreeing to return Java to Dutch rule. Excited by news of Napoleon's escape from Elba and the renewed outbreak of war, in August 1815 Raffles appealed to the British government to retain Java, but the directors had already issued a preliminary condemnation of his actions as injudicious and extravagant and demanded his recall. Accordingly, on 17 October 1815 the governor-general, reproving him for &#145;persevering imprudence&#146;, ordered Raffles's transfer to the company's ailing west Sumatra residency at Bencoolen, to which Minto had provisionally nominated him in 1813 as insurance in case Java was restored to Dutch rule.<h2>
<a name="HistoryofJava"></a>History of Java</h2>Dispirited and ill, Raffles decided first to go to England and left Java on 25 March 1816, calling at St Helena, where he was disillusioned at meeting the exiled former emperor Napoleon, whom he had hitherto admired. Despite arriving home, in his own words &#145;wretchedly thin and sallow&#146;, in October 1816 he embarked on a two-volume <span class="italic">History of Java</span>, which was written and published within seven months. The spring of 1817 saw an uplift in his fortunes. On 13 February, although they still did not comment on his Java administration, the directors exonerated him from charges of dishonourable personal motives and confirmed his Bencoolen appointment. Nine days later, in a very quiet ceremony, he married Sophia Hull (1786&#150;1858), whom he had met while taking the waters at Cheltenham spa. Thirty years old and rather plain, Sophia appears to have appealed to Raffles as a mature, even-tempered, sensible match. She was to be a model of devotion and resilience, steadfast through personal and financial disasters, accompanying him uncomplaining on the most arduous journeys, and after his death publishing a glowing and detailed biography, but omitting any reference to Raffles's first marriage.<br>
<br>On 20 March 1817 Raffles was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, which brought him into contact with distinguished scientists and dignitaries, such as the duke and duchess of Somerset. On 10 April his <span class="italic">History of Java</span> was published, receiving mixed reviews and betraying hasty composition but causing a stir as the first English-language history. Raffles found himself lionized in London society, and from about this time he assumed the name of Stamford in place of the more pedestrian Thomas. He dined with Princess Charlotte, and on 29 May was knighted by the prince regent, who praised him in a twenty-minute speech at a Carlton House levee. The couple then toured Europe, dining with the Dutch colonial minister and also with King William, to whom Raffles offered advice about Java.<h2>
<a name="TheBencoolenresidency"></a>The Bencoolen residency</h2>In November 1817 Raffles and Sophia embarked for Bencoolen. Charlotte, their first child, was born at sea on 15 February 1818, and the voyage was enlivened by the company of Joseph Arnold, naval surgeon and botanist, who stimulated Raffles's already keen interest in natural history. He had high hopes for Bencoolen. In London he had tried in vain to persuade the East India Company to set up a chain of stations on the China route and develop British trade in the archipelago. At the end of the Napoleonic wars both the British government and the company wanted to reduce their commitments in south-east Asia and returned Melaka, the Moluccas, and Java to the Dutch, but, despite the failure of his Java dreams, Raffles hoped to use west Sumatra as the base to expand British influence. Because of his personal standing, he was dignified with the title of lieutenant-governor, rather than mere resident, and, through the influential contacts he had made in England, he nursed ambitions eventually to become governor-general of Bengal and a peer of the realm.<br>
<br>Raffles's arrival at malaria-ridden Fort Marlborough on 22 March 1818 was sobering. Recent earthquakes had destroyed most buildings, the administration had long been in chaos, pepper production (which represented Bencoolen's sole livelihood) was neglected, and Raffles was horrified to find slaves belonging to the East India Company. He immediately freed the company's slaves, prohibited gambling, and set about reorganizing the administration, improving pepper production, and introducing an enlightened convict labour system.<br>
<br>Raffles arranged for Horsfield to visit Bencoolen to accompany Sophia and himself on an arduous exploration of the Menangkabau territory of central Sumatra, where Horsfield identified many new plants. Raffles also undertook expeditions with Arnold, who discovered a five-petalled, mottled reddish parasite, the largest flower in the world, at Pulau Lebar in west Sumatra on 19 May 1818, shortly before he died of malaria. After Raffles reported the find to Sir Joseph Banks, a paper was presented to the Linnean Society of London in 1820, and the flower was assigned the generic name <i>Rafflesia</i>, and called <i>Rafflesia arnoldi</i>. Subsequently, in Singapore in February 1819 Raffles himself discovered a large, brilliant pitcher plant, which was named the <i>Nepenthes rafflesiana</i>.<br>
<br>But Raffles's primary concern was to establish friendly relations with neighbouring rulers in order to check the spread of Dutch power in Sumatra and the revival of their protectionist measures against British trade. He tried to prevent the Dutch return to Padang and Palembang, and established British posts in the Lampongs area of south Sumatra and islands off the west coast. Alarmed at the prospect of the Dutch dominating both the Melaka and Sunda straits, in September 1818 Raffles went to Calcutta to try to win the support of Governor-General Lord Hastings for a more aggressive policy. While Hastings vetoed Raffles's ambitious Sumatra schemes, he approved a more limited proposal to protect the Melaka Strait trade route by making a treaty with Aceh in north Sumatra and acquiring a trading station at Riau or some other southern point, provided this did not bring the company into collision with the Dutch. Hastings appointed Raffles his agent to undertake this enterprise, with the assistance of Colonel William Farquhar, who had been British resident of Melaka during the wartime occupation.<h2>
<a name="FoundingSingapore"></a>Founding Singapore</h2>Discovering that the Dutch had forestalled them in Riau, Raffles and Farquhar investigated the Karimun Islands but found them unsuitable, and on 29 January 1819 landed at Singapore, part of the Riau&#150;Johor empire. The following day Raffles signed a preliminary treaty with the local chieftain, the <i>temenggong</i>, permitting the East India Company to set up a trading post on the Singapore River. Since the sultanate had been in dispute for some years between two half-brothers, with the Dutch supporting the younger claimant, Raffles invited the elder brother, Hussein, over from Riau, recognized him as sultan, and on 6 February 1819 signed a treaty with Hussein and the <i>temenggong</i> confirming the company's right to establish the post, subject to an annual payment. The next day Raffles departed for Penang to negotiate the treaty with Aceh, leaving Farquhar in charge as resident.<br>
<br>The new settlement's prospects looked precarious. The Dutch authorities in Batavia protested vigorously, and the governor of Penang urged Calcutta to repudiate Singapore, accusing Raffles of acting &#145;like a man who sets a house on fire and then runs away&#146;. The day before he dropped anchor off Singapore, the company's Board of Control had dispatched instructions to the governor-general forbidding the proposed mission, but these did not reach Calcutta until March, and the embarrassing news of the acquisition got back to London only in August 1819. Raffles's actions in Sumatra and the Melaka Strait provoked a &#145;paper war&#146; between Britain and the Netherlands, threatening to jeopardize wide-ranging diplomatic talks, which aimed to settle Anglo-Dutch differences in the East in order to cement their friendship in Europe. But the Singapore issue was put in abeyance for years while the negotiations dragged on.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Raffles returned to Singapore at the end of May 1819, bringing immigrants from Penang, and he spent three weeks drafting plans for the settlement before returning to Bencoolen. Aspiring to gather under his own control all the British possessions in south-east Asia&#151;Penang, Province Wellesley, Bencoolen, and Singapore&#151;he hurried to Calcutta to push his claims when news of the sudden death of the governor of Penang reached Fort Marlborough in October 1819. While sympathetic in principle, Hastings refused to consider the matter further until the Anglo-Dutch negotiations were settled.<br>
<br>Somewhat disappointed, Raffles returned to Bencoolen in February 1820 and concentrated on making it a model colony. He settled his growing family in a country house at Dove's Rise, about 12 miles out of Fort Marlborough, where he kept a menagerie and indulged his passion for natural history. In this he was ably supported by a gifted young Scottish botanist, William Jack, whom he had met in Calcutta and appointed in November 1818 to succeed Arnold. Raffles kept up correspondence with experts in England and Calcutta, and amassed collections of manuscripts, natural history drawings, and paintings, together with botanical and zoological specimens, some of which he sent to Banks and Marsden.<br>
<br>This tranquil interlude was shattered by a series of cruel disasters. Within the space of six months, between July 1821 and January 1822, three of his four children died, and the surviving infant was sent to the safe care of Sophia's parents in England. William Jack died of tuberculosis in September 1822, while Raffles and Sophia themselves were seriously ill. Disheartened and prematurely aged, &#145;a little old man, all yellow and shrivelled&#146;, as he described himself at that time, Raffles decided to retire from the East.<h2>
<a name="SecuringSingapore"></a>Securing Singapore</h2>First Raffles resolved to pay a last visit to Singapore, about which he had received encouraging but only occasional reports over the last three years because of the poor communications with west Sumatra. On landing in October 1822 Raffles was thrilled with the spectacular commercial vigour of what he called &#145;this, my almost only child&#146;, but he became increasingly critical of the resident's old-fashioned ways: his deference to Hussein and the <i>temenggong</i>, his tolerance of slavery and legalized gambling, and his allocation of land. In January 1823 Raffles reported to Calcutta accusing Farquhar of incompetence, in April he took over as resident himself, and the following month he stripped Farquhar of his office as military commandant. On his return to England, Farquhar complained to the directors about wrongful dismissal, claiming that he himself had been primarily responsible for choosing the Singapore site and successfully nursing the infant settlement through its formative years.<br>
<br>Despite blinding headaches, which sometimes left Raffles prostrate for weeks on end, and ignoring the fact that the very survival of the settlement was still being debated in Europe, he hurried to lay down regulations for Singapore's long-term administration. Absolute freedom of trade was declared a permanent principle, not merely a temporary expedient to build up commerce. Supported by a committee comprising European officials and merchants, with representatives of the various Asian ethnic groups, Raffles drew up a town plan and resettled a large part of the population according to their different communities. He established a magistracy administering English law, with Malay social custom where appropriate for the indigenous people. Prohibiting slave trading, he provided for existing debt slaves to work off their obligations in five years, and he introduced Bencoolen's liberal system of convict labour management. He banned the carrying of arms, gambling, and cock-fighting outright, and introduced deterrent taxation on other vices, such as alcohol and opium. In June 1823 he signed an agreement with the sultan and <i>temenggong</i>, commuting their commercial and judicial privileges to money payments. Most dear to Raffles's heart was the promotion of education, which he believed was the key to progress. His ideal was to revive Asian cultures in alliance with the best of Western tradition through a college which would attract the sons of the &eacute;lite throughout the region, and, three days before leaving Singapore, he laid the foundation-stone for the Singapore Institution, with generous donations from himself and his wife and a pledge for annual funding from the East India Company.<h2>
<a name="Disastersanddeath"></a>Disasters and death</h2>Raffles departed from Singapore for the last time on 14 June 1823, returning to Bencoolen, where a fifth child was born but died within two months. On 2 February 1824 Raffles and Sophia set sail for England on the <i>Fame</i>, together with all their worldly possessions, worth between &pound;20,000 and &pound;30,000. That same night the ship caught fire. All on board were saved, but the <i>Fame</i> and its cargo were entirely destroyed, including a large collection of plants, fish, animals, and birds; between 2000 and 3000 unique natural history drawings and paintings; original Malay manuscripts and Raffles's notes about the history of Borneo, Sumatra, and the founding of Singapore; together with Raffles's irreplaceable scientific papers and those left by Arnold and Jack, the latter representing three years' unpublished research in Penang, Kedah, Singapore, and Sumatra.<br>
<br>The couple embarked again on 8 April, reaching Plymouth in August 1824. There Raffles was pleased to learn about the Anglo-Dutch treaty signed in London in March 1824, which recognized the British settlement at Singapore, to be followed by a treaty in August that year in which the Malay chiefs confirmed ceding the whole island to the East India Company. After living in London for a while, in July 1825 Raffles bought a country estate at High Wood, near Hendon, where he took up farming. Meanwhile, in November 1824 he published a <span class="italic">Statement of the Services of Sir Stamford Raffles</span>, justifying his administration over the past twelve years, and, after the author's death, he undertook the editing of George Finlayson's <span class="italic">Mission to Siam</span>, which was published in 1826. In the spring of 1825 he launched a long-cherished proposal for a zoo in London supported by a society to promote the science of zoology. Enlisting the backing of Sir Humphry Davy, president of the Royal Society, Raffles issued a prospectus in March 1825 and was elected first president of the Zoological Society at a committee meeting of the proposers, which he chaired on 26 February 1826.<br>
<br>Raffles's hopes of obtaining a company pension became more pressing when most of his remaining capital was lost through a bank failure late in 1825. In April 1826 the directors finally came to a decision. They acknowledged Raffles's contribution to the successful invasion of Java and, despite questioning the propriety of his land sales, they accepted that he faced a financial crisis from the beginning of his administration in Java. While criticizing his aggressive external policy in Sumatra, they commended his internal administration in Bencoolen, and recognized his crucial role in acquiring and making sound administrative arrangements for Singapore. The overall judgment was favourable, but, so far from granting Raffles a pension, the directors now demanded &pound;22,272 in alleged overpayments and interest going back to 1817.<br>
<br>The following month Raffles suffered an attack of apoplexy, and early in the morning of 5 July 1826 Sophia found him lying dead at the foot of the stairs. He was only forty-five, but an autopsy revealed an unsuspected brain tumour and showed that for years he had been receiving the wrong treatment for supposed digestive complaints. In March 1827 the directors accepted Sophia's offer of &pound;10,000 to cancel her husband's debt. She lived on until 1858, but their only remaining daughter died in 1840 at the age of eighteen and it was left to Raffles's cousin to continue the family name. Raffles died an embittered man, prematurely broken in health, financially ruined, failing to acquire the honours and public recognition he craved, and apparently with little to show for the privations and tragedies he and his family had suffered. He was buried at Hendon church, but the grave was unmarked, allegedly because of family arguments with the vicar, who held investments in the West Indies and objected to Raffles's campaign against slavery. In 1887 his nephew installed a brass plaque, but the coffin was discovered only accidentally during building work in the vault in April 1914.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>In many ways Raffles was a figure of contradictions and anomalies. His slight stature and sickly constitution masked an immense capacity for hard work and an agile mind. Gentle and soft-spoken, he commanded the devotion of friends and subordinates, but could be intolerant and vindictive towards those who crossed him personally or obstructed his policies. Despite his long years in the East in the service of an old-fashioned monopoly company, he sought to put into practice the most advanced Western views of his time on personal liberty, judicial equality, education, free trade, penal reform, and slave emancipation. A man of vision, with great ambitions for himself and his country, he saw Britain's mission to raise the people of the eastern archipelago from ignorance and poverty, not by means of territorial expansion but a combination of commercial and moral pre-eminence: reviving old cultures and spreading European enlightenment through economic progress, liberal education, and the rule of law.<br>
<br>Despite Raffles's scanty formal schooling, his intelligence and thirst for learning inspired respect among leading scientists of his day, and after his death he was singled out for praise by Sir Humphry Davy in his presidential address to the Royal Society. A statue by the eminent sculptor Sir Francis Chantrey was erected in Westminster Abbey in 1832, an oil portrait by G. F. Joseph was presented to the National Portrait Gallery, and another by Sir James Lonsdale hangs in the council room at the London Zoo.<br>
<br>But Raffles's most enduring monument was Singapore itself, which secured British supremacy in the eastern seas for more than a century and represented a triumph for the principles of free trade and <i>laissez-faire</i>. Educational dreams were slower to materialize, although eventually the renamed Raffles Institution became Singapore's premier school. Raffles's statue, which was first installed in Singapore in 1885 to celebrate Queen Victoria's golden jubilee, was torn down during the Japanese occupation but restored after the Second World War. Not only did it survive independence, but the republic of Singapore was unique among liberated colonies in erecting a second monument to honour the foresight of its imperial founder.<br>
