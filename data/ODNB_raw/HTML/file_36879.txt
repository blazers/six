<span class="headword">Whitney,  James Pounder</span>  (1857&#150;1939), <span class="occ">ecclesiastical historian</span>, was born at Marsden, near Huddersfield, Yorkshire, on 30 November 1857, the only son of Thomas Whitney, perpetual curate of Marsden, and his wife, Ann Jane, daughter of James Morice. Both parents were of south Welsh extraction. A precocious boy, he showed an early interest in academic history. He was educated at King James's Grammar School, Almondbury, near Huddersfield, and was a student at Owens College, Manchester (1874&#150;7), under Sir A. W. Ward, who remained his mentor and friend. As a foundation scholar of King's College, Cambridge (1877), he was a wrangler in the mathematical tripos of 1881 and was also bracketed senior in the first class in the historical tripos of that year. In 1882 he won the Lightfoot scholarship for ecclesiastical history and the Whewell scholarship for international law.<br>
<br>Ordained deacon in 1883 and priest in 1885, Whitney became, after holding three curacies, the rector of Hempstead-with-Lessingham, Norfolk (1890), and then rector of Milton, near Cambridge (1895). He continued to study ecclesiastical history, and was assistant lecturer in history at Owens College from 1882 to 1887. In 1900 he was appointed principal of Bishop's College, Lennoxville, Quebec, Canada, and held the office, along with a canonry of Quebec Cathedral, for five years. He returned to Cambridge in 1906 as chaplain of St Edward's Church (1906&#150;8). In 1906 he was also Hulsean lecturer. From 1908 to 1918 he was professor of ecclesiastical history at King's College, London, and after a brief tenure of the rectory of Wicken Bonhunt, Essex, in 1918&#150;19, was elected Dixie professor of ecclesiastical history and fellow of Emmanuel College at Cambridge in 1919. He held both these posts until his death, which took place at 6 St Peter's Terrace, Cambridge, on 17 June 1939.<br>
<br>Whitney was an inspiring teacher, exerting considerable personal influence over his pupils and generously recognizing younger scholars. He was a man of attractive character and in early years notably handsome. His scholarship was wide and deep, but discursive. He was a joint-editor of the <span class="roman">Cambridge Medieval History</span> from 1907 to 1922; he contributed some excellent chapters; but as an editor he was unbusinesslike, and his colleague C. W. Previt&eacute;-Orton's generous tribute to him in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> has to be revised in the light of Peter Linehan's study of the <span class="roman">History</span>. Whitney's own works, which included <span class="italic">The Reformation</span> (1907, revised 1940) and <span class="italic">Hildebrandine Essays</span> (1932), reveal a judicious and widely read historian. But he published little; the <i>coup d'&#339;il</i>, exact, luminous, and instructive, was his forte. He was remembered for his conversational <i>obiter dicta</i>; he could be caustic, but he was without rancour. Himself a devout Anglican, he had friends in other denominations. He married on 29 April 1891 Roberta Frances Anne (<i>b</i>. 1866/7), daughter of Robert Champley, of Scarborough; there were no children of the marriage. After his death, his widow gave his valuable collection of books to the Seeley Historical Library at Cambridge.<br>
