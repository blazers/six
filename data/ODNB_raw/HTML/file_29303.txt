<span class="headword">Whitfield <span class="st"> [Whitfeld]</span>,  Henry</span>  (1590/91&#150;1657), <span class="occ">minister in America</span>, was the son of Thomas Whitfield, an attorney and owner of the manor of East Sheen and West Hall, Mortlake, Surrey, and of his wife Mildred (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Manning). He matriculated from New College, Oxford, on 6 June 1610, aged nineteen, but there is no record of his having received a degree; nor is there any evidence for Cotton Mather's assertion that he studied at the inns of court after leaving Oxford. He was ordained and inducted as rector of St Margaret's, Ockley, Surrey, in 1618 and ministered there until 1638. In 1618 he married Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1669), daughter of Thomas Sheafe, Church of England clergyman, and his wife, Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wilson; they had children.<br>
<br>Whitfield was noted for his charity and hospitality, and was a supporter of protestant unity. In 1631 he was one of the signatories of a testimonial given to John Durie in support of his efforts for reconciliation of protestant churches. He may have been the Henry Whitfield who proceeded BD from Cambridge early in 1632: such a degree would certainly fit with his evident learning and his standing in scholarly and clerical circles. In the spring of 1633 he hosted a conference called to persuade John Cotton and Thomas Hooker to compromise their objections to church practice so that their ministry would not be lost to the English church. Among those joining Whitfield, Cotton, and Hooker were Thomas Goodwin, Philip Nye, John Davenport, and William Twisse. Philip Nye's manuscript account of the meeting does not survive, but the gist of it can be reconstructed from manuscripts in the Hartlib papers. The tables were turned during the debates, with Cotton and Hooker persuading their friends, or some of them, of the idolatrous nature of some of the disputed church ceremonies and that under the changed circumstances of the day conformity was no longer an option. Goodwin, Nye, and Davenport quickly demonstrated their nonconformity. Whitfield retained his parish responsibilities for a time, but found it increasingly difficult. In the mid-1630s letters seized in the studies of John White and John Stoughton seemed to implicate Whitfield in what the government suspected was a clerical underground seeking to undermine the church. He was author of <span class="italic">Some Help to Stir up to Christian Duties</span> (1636).<br>
<br>Whitfield resigned his living, sold his estate, and migrated to New England in 1639, taking a number of parish families with him at his own expense. His was the first ship to sail directly from England to the new colony of New Haven. While crossing the Atlantic Whitfield and a group of his fellow emigrants drew up a covenant which became the foundation of their new town. Whitfield, who had substantial means, purchased land on behalf of the township from the local Native Americans. Initially identified by its Indian name, Menumkatuck, the town was renamed Guilford in 1643. Whitfield served as the pastor of the Guilford church for eleven years without pay. In 1643 the Guilford congregation formally gathered itself in the New England fashion and officially chose Whitfield as pastor and John Higginson as teacher. Cotton Mather reported that Whitfield's preaching style was very much like that of Richard Sibbes, and that &#145;there was a marvelous majesty and sanctity observable in it&#146;, and that he frequently visited &#145;the particular families of his flock, with profitable discourses on the great concerns of their interior state&#146;  (Mather, 1.593).<br>
<br>In 1650 Whitfield, discouraged by the New England wilderness and encouraged by letters from English friends, left Guilford and returned to England, where he resumed his ministry at a parish in Winchester, Hampshire. He retained an interest in New England affairs, however, and particularly in the mission to the Indians. Whitfield knew of John Eliot and his missionary efforts, and on his return to England Whitfield's ship had been forced to put in at Martha's Vineyard; there he had observed and been impressed with the missionary work of Thomas Mayhew jun., listening both to Mayhew and to the tales of Indian converts, and in England he became a member of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in New England. Mayhew urged him to tell the story of the missions in England and in 1651 Whitfield published <span class="italic">The Light Appearing More and More towards the Perfect Day</span>, which related in great detail the work of Mayhew on the islands off the Massachusetts coast. The work also included letters of John Eliot describing his efforts. It was dedicated to parliament in a preface signed by John Owen, Philip Nye, Thomas Goodwin, and other congregationalists. Whitfield encouraged his successor in Guilford, John Higginson, to learn the local native dialect and to preach to and catechize the tribes. He continued his support for the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel and was involved in the publication of <span class="italic">Strength out of Weakness</span> (1652) and further reports in 1655. He died at Winchester in September 1657.<br>
