<span class="headword">Owen,  (Paul) Robert</span>  (1920&#150;1990), <span class="occ">engineer</span>, was born on 24 January 1920 in Dalston, London, the elder son (there were no daughters) of Joseph Owen, estate manager, and his wife, Deborah Grossmith. His secondary education was at the Central Foundation School (1933&#150;8), a grammar school in the City of London. He then entered Queen Mary College, London University, to read engineering, specializing in aeronautics. On the outbreak of war in 1939 the college was evacuated to Cambridge. He graduated there in 1940 with first-class honours and won the Allen Low prize for the best student in engineering.<br>
<br>Owen started work at the aircraft firm Boulton Paul in Norwich, but his potential for research soon became evident and in 1941 he joined the aerodynamics department of the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE), Farnborough. The work there was varied and challenging, ranging from problems of immediate urgency for the RAF to matters of great importance for future aircraft designs. It was evident that high speeds, extending into supersonic flight, would in due course become a reality, calling for new experimental and theoretical research tools. Owen's progress with such problems was remarkable. He quickly matured from his initial junior status to become a creative leader, and his promotion was rapid. Topics he successfully addressed included the development of low-drag wings and bodies, the stability and control of high-speed aircraft, the aerodynamic problems of guided weapons, and supersonic flight. When the war ended in 1945 he expanded his interests to include other applications of fluid mechanics.<br>
<br>In 1953 Owen accepted an invitation to become reader and director of the Manchester University fluid motion laboratory, and three years later he was appointed professor and head of the newly formed mechanics of fluids department. In spite of his heavy administrative load, he became interested in meteorology and was also involved with local industrial problems&#151;for example, cotton spinning, ventilation, and the dangers of coal dust in mines. He became a member of the Safety in Mines Research Advisory Board in 1956. This led him to investigate the transport of dust particles by air flows, including saltation (the lifting of particles from a surface and their subsequent trajectories). This became a major activity, with important applications to soil erosion and desertification. In 1958 he married Margaret Ann, a law graduate of Oxford, daughter of Herbert Baron, solicitor. They had two sons and two daughters, in whom he took great pride and pleasure.<br>
<br>In 1963 Owen moved to the Zaharoff chair of aviation at Imperial College, London. He there extended his interests even further, to the aerodynamics of buildings, heat exchangers, blood flow, and respiration. In 1966 a physiological flows unit was founded in his department. Meanwhile, however, he was an active member of the Aeronautical Research Council and in 1971 was appointed its chairman, a position he retained for a record eight years. Since this was a time of major new developments in aeronautics, the work of the council was of first importance and he took great pride in it.<br>
<br>In 1984 Owen retired early, but he continued teaching and vigorously pursued his research, particularly in saltation. He developed fruitful contacts with workers elsewhere with similar interests, particularly in the Middle East, Africa, the USA, Denmark, and France, and he contributed key papers to international symposia. In 1985 he developed heart trouble and had a bypass operation. Nevertheless, he soon resumed his research, travelling and lecturing extensively, and seemed to recover well.<br>
<br>Owen was passionately interested in music, drama, and the arts. His good looks and musical voice made him a natural choice in his youth for leading parts in the RAE dramatic society productions. He wrote and spoke with grace, wit, and a wry, kindly, self-deprecating humour. His sympathies were with the underprivileged and he constantly sought to apply himself to the problems of the developing world. He was accorded various honours, including election as FRS in 1971, appointment as CBE in 1974, and election as FEng in 1976.<br>
<br>In 1988 Owen fell ill again with what was thought to be a viral infection. He continued writing and collaborating with his international colleagues, but recovery eluded him. He died of cancer in St Mary's Hospital, London, on 11 November 1990.<br>
