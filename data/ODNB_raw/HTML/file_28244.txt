<span class="headword">Vernon,  Joseph</span>  (<em>c.</em>1738&#150;1782), <span class="occ">singer and actor</span>, was born in Coventry illegitimately and grew up in the Coventry charity school. He became a choirboy at St Paul's Cathedral, London, where William Savage was master of the choristers. While still a choirboy he made his Drury Lane d&eacute;but, on 26 December 1750, as Puck in the pantomime <span class="italic">Queen Mab</span>. He also performed that season in T. A. Arne's <span class="italic">Alfred</span>, Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span>, and Boyce's <span class="italic">The Shepherd's Lottery</span>. He continued to perform at Drury Lane after his voice broke and he became a tenor. On 27 June 1755 he married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64357/', "Jane Poitier (b. 1736)")</script>, another singer at Drury Lane. At least one of them was under age. The wedding took place at the Savoy Chapel, whose clergy mistakenly thought they were exempt from the provisions of Hardwicke's <span class="roman">Marriage Act</span> of 1754. The marriage was annulled and both the officiating chaplain and the curate, Tate Wilkinson's father, John, were sentenced to transportation to America. Vernon testified against them. On 27 September, and on several later occasions, Vernon was hissed off the Drury Lane stage for his role in the affair. Tate Wilkinson gave a detailed, though naturally biased, version of the episode: his father died on the voyage.<br>
<br>Vernon spent much of the following six years on the Dublin stage. In 1759 he is said to have witnessed a murder but was paid by the murderer's father not to testify. He returned occasionally to Drury Lane, until on 21 September 1762 he became once again a regular member of the company. He took leading roles in many of the new operas, including most of those by Dibdin, and Rush's <span class="italic">The Royal Shepherd</span>. He also acted in plays, including some by Shakespeare. When Sheridan and Linley took over Drury Lane from Garrick in 1776 he was past his best as a singer, but nevertheless took the title role in Linley's first opera, <span class="italic">Selima and Azor</span>. He made his final appearance on 9 October 1781.<br>
<br>On 8 January 1773 Vernon married Margaret Richardson. He was a freemason, a member of the grand lodge, in the 1770s.<br>
<br>Contemporary critics indicate that Vernon's acting remained strong throughout his career but his singing voice weakened with age. Quoting <span class="italic">The Theatrical Biography</span> of 1772, Genest states:<blockquote>it is seldom found that a good actor is a good singer&#151;Vernon stands an exception to that rule; for tho' he now only lives in point of voice upon the echo of his former reputation, he <i>was</i> excellent in both. (Genest, 6.220)</blockquote>Vernon composed several songs and ballads, mostly for use in stage works in which he performed. He wrote the best-known version of Feste's epilogue in <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span>, &#145;When that I was and a little tiny boy&#146;.<br>
<br>He died on 19 March 1782 in Lambeth of a lingering illness, and the administration of his effects was granted to his widow, Margaret. He was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London.<br>
