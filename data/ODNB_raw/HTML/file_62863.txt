<span class="headword">Smith <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Dalrymple]</span>,  Martha Mary <span class="st"> [Eustacia]</span></span>  (1835&#150;1919), <span class="occ">art patron</span>, was born on 14 October 1835 in Madras, India, the eldest daughter of Captain (William Henry) Clarence Dalrymple (<i>d</i>. 1838) and his wife, Margaret, daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Oswald Werge. Little is known of her upbringing: she presumably went to Britain as a small child on the death of her father&#151;a naval captain who in 1835 became master attendant and a member of the marine board in Madras&#151;and may then have grown up on the family estates in Northumberland. Through a distant cousin, Sir John Dalrymple (whose wife, Sophia Pattle, was the sister of Lady Somers and of the photographer Julia Margaret Cameron), Martha Dalrymple gained an entr&eacute;e to Little Holland House, Kensington, in the 1850s and 1860s the hub of the most vibrant artistic clique of the day. As well as Tennyson and Browning, she would have encountered the young painters Frederic Leighton and Val Prinsep (whose mother was another of the Pattle sisters); G. F. Watts lived in the grounds as painter-in-residence.<br>
<br>In 1855 Martha Dalrymple married <a name="cosubject_62863"></a><span class="headword">(Thomas) Eustace Smith</span>  (1831&#150;1903)<span class="occ"></span>, a member of one of Tyneside's most prosperous shipping families. He was born in Newcastle upon Tyne on 3 June 1831, the son of William Smith (<i>bap</i>. 1787, <i>d</i>. 1860) and Margaret Werge (a cousin of Martha's mother). William, with his elder brother Thomas (<i>c</i>.1784&#150;1856), had built up their father's rope making business into a major concern, which came to embrace the ownership of ships and docks as well as shipbuilding. On his father's death in 1860 Eustace Smith became heir to business interests worth &pound;60,000 a year. Eustace and Martha Smith had ten children, born between 1856 and 1868. The latter year also marked Eustace Smith's election as Liberal MP for Tynemouth, a seat he held until his resignation in 1885.<br>
<br>Between about 1865 and 1875 the Smiths assembled one of the most spectacular collections of paintings of the nascent aesthetic movement. Initially, most were hung at Eustace's family home of Gosforth Park, near Newcastle, then after about 1874 in London, at 52 Prince's Gate, opposite Hyde Park in the fashionable suburb of Kensington. There they were installed in interiors designed by George Aitchison, with the participation of Walter Crane and Thomas Armstrong. Their importance is reflected by Whistler's comment in 1876 or 1877, on completing the &#145;Peacock room&#146; for Frederick Leyland, their neighbour three doors away at no. 49: &#145;it eclipses Mrs Eustace Smith!&#146;  (Wilcox, 49).<br>
<br>Watts's portrait of Ellen Terry, <span class="italic">Choosing</span> (1865; NPG), was one of the first works to be acquired by Eustace Smith, a purchase datable circumstantially to about 1865. He retained a special affection for Watts, who painted his portrait (<i>c</i>.1872; Tate collection). For the remainder of the collection, the surviving records reveal the initiative to have been taken almost entirely by Martha Smith, who adopted the name Eustacia as much as an act of identification with the new classicism in painting as with her husband. Her favoured artist was Leighton, who not only painted her portrait (<i>c</i>.1870; priv. coll.) but may also have used her as the model for one of his most provocative nudes, prominently displayed at Prince's Gate, <span class="italic">Venus Disrobing</span> (1867; priv. coll.). Eustacia teasingly admitted to modelling solely for the feet.<br>
<br>Rosetti's <span class="italic">Pandora</span> (1869; Faringdon Collection Trust), Albert Moore's <span class="italic">A Garden</span> (1870; Tate collection), Watts's <span class="italic">The Wife of Pygmalion</span> (1868; Faringdon Collection Trust), and Burne Jones's <span class="italic">Cupid and Psyche</span> (1867; Cecil French collection, Fulham Public Library) were all ground-breaking essays for their respective artists and their purchase revealed Eustacia Smith's complete commitment to the avant-garde. She showed more than generosity in supporting two indigent prot&eacute;g&eacute;s of Leighton, George Heming Mason and the Frenchman Alphonse Legros, whose largest and most ambitious works entered the collection about 1872&#150;3. In the case of Mason's <span class="italic">The Harvest Moon</span> (1872; Tate collection) the purchase was made posthumously. There is no evidence that any further works were added to the collection after about 1875, although in 1882 Mrs Smith apparently commissioned a statuette from Alfred Gilbert which was never completed.<br>
<br>The adventurousness of Eustacia Smith's collecting also typified her private life. In 1868 she engaged in an affair with Charles Dilke MP, one of her husband's Liberal colleagues at Westminster; the liaison re-ignited briefly in 1874&#150;5 on the death of Dilke's wife. In 1876 Dilke's brother Ashton married the Smiths' eldest daughter, Margaret. The web of connections between the families became fatally tangled when in 1885 Charles Dilke was named as co-respondent in a divorce suit filed by Donald Crawford, the husband of another of the Smiths' daughters, Virginia, a scandal described by Henry James as &#145;queer and dramatic and disagreeable&#146;. The case against Dilke remained unproven, but the shameful implications led Eustace Smith to sell the Prince's Gate house, complete with the paintings, privately to Alexander Henderson, later first Baron Faringdon. The Smiths spent the next fifteen years in self-imposed exile in Algeciras, Spain, their name virtually unmentionable in English society. They eventually returned to England about 1900 and commissioned from W. R. Lethaby a house, High Coxlease, in Lyndhurst, Hampshire, where they lived a retired existence far from the public gaze. Eustace Smith died there on 5 December 1903 following several years' poor health; his wife survived him and died at High Coxlease on 29 December 1919.<br>
