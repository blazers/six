<span class="headword">Baker <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Willcocks]</span>,  Mary</span> <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>Princess Caraboo]</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1791, <em>d.</em> 1864), <span class="occ">impostor</span>, enjoyed a brief period of celebrity beginning when, on Good Friday 1817, a young woman wearing a black turban and speaking an unknown language was found wandering in Almondsbury, north-east of Bristol. Her black hair was long and thick, she had large brown eyes, full lips, and very white teeth, and she aroused the sympathy of the American-born Elizabeth Worrall, wife of the town clerk of Bristol, who had rented the local manor house, Knole Park. The girl became excited when she was shown pictures of China, and when she was offered a bed for the night at The Bowl inn she identified a drawing of a pineapple with the word &#145;ananas&#146;. Mrs Worrall's husband, Samuel, known as &#145;Devil&#146; Worrall and a notorious drunkard, then intervened, declaring that the young woman was a beggar and must be taken to Bristol and tried for vagrancy. It was during her brief imprisonment there that she was identified by a Portuguese sailor, Manuel Enes, who claimed to understand her language: she came from an island called Javasu, had been kidnapped by pirates, and had managed to jump overboard in the Bristol Channel. She was a princess, and her name was Caraboo.<br>
<br>There followed a triumphant summer at Knole. Surrounded by admirers, Caraboo provided examples of the written language of Javasu, performed an exotic war dance involving a gong, showed great skill in archery, cooked a chicken curry, and swam naked in the lake. She had to contend with a Greek manservant who believed her to be a fraud, and was once woken in the middle of the night by shouts of &#145;Fire!&#146; She betrayed no sign of alarm. Her authenticity was proved beyond question by Dr Wilkinson, a polymath from Bath who gave subscription lectures on everything from electricity to washable wallpaper. He considered that incisions on the back of her head could have been made only by oriental surgeons. By showing her Edmund Fry's <span class="italic">Pantographia</span>, a manual of languages, he identified her native dialect as Rejang, spoken in Sumatra. Samuel Worrall, keen to inspire confidence in his private Tolzey Bank, welcomed the presence of a royal visitor, and authorized Wilkinson to publish his findings in the newspapers, asking for any further information about the princess.<br>
<br>Information was provided almost immediately by a Mrs Neale, who ran a boarding-house in Bristol. The &#145;Princess Caraboo&#146; was in fact Mary Willcocks, the daughter of Thomas Willcocks, a cobbler from Witheridge in Devon. For a short time she was internationally famous, and there was much merriment at the expense of Dr Wilkinson, Mrs Worrall, and her husband, whose bank shortly afterwards collapsed.<br>
<br>Mary Willcocks had been baptized in Witheridge church on 23 November 1791 and had suffered as a child from rheumatic fever. Since then, according to her father, she had &#145;never been right in the head&#146;. Always a tomboy, she had left the village when she was nineteen, lived rough on the road, and arrived in London very ill. After a crude cupping operation in a poorhouse hospital that left the scars found by Dr Wilkinson, she had worked as a nursemaid for a family in Clapham, telling the children wonderful stories. She had become fascinated by Hebrew prayers and by the Jewish family next door, and was sacked for attending a Jewish wedding without her employers' permission. Thereafter she succeeded in getting herself admitted to a Magdalen hospital, a home for fallen women, having admired the uniform brown dresses and straw hats of the inmates; when her innocence was discovered, she was expelled. She drifted north across the river to jobs in Smithfield and Islington, and may, as she claimed, have travelled to France: she certainly spoke a smattering of French. She became pregnant, and hired a cab from the Bay Tree in Tottenham Court Road, where she was working, to a secret address where the child was born. After a short time in the workhouse, she took it to the foundling hospital, claiming first that the father was an Exeter bricklayer named John Edward Baker, and then a Frenchman that she had met in a bookshop. The child died, and she again took to the road, travelling with Gypsies, whose language and rituals are recognizable in Princess Caraboo's performance at Knole. Her appearance at Almondsbury followed a period of begging in Bristol. Seeing the success of Breton girls in their traditional headdresses, she made herself a turban and pretended to be French. Taken to the French consul, she claimed to be Spanish. Invited to meet a Spanish cook, she had been reduced to talking what she called her &#145;lingo&#146;.<br>
<br>After Caraboo's exposure, Mrs Worrall paid Mary Willcocks's passage to America under the supervision of two Moravian sisters. She arrived in Philadelphia to find herself famous, and was persuaded by a showman called Sanders to appear at the Washington Hall as &#145;Princess Carraboo&#146;, dancing and speaking her language. The show was not a success, and in her last letter to Mrs Worrall, written in November 1817, she was in New York, complaining of the horrors of celebrity. She appears to have remained in Philadelphia until 1824, when she returned to London and exhibited herself in New Bond Street as Princess Caraboo, again without much success. She may then have visited the south of France and Spain, but was back in Bedminster, south of the river in Bristol, in 1828, where she was married. She used her cousin's name, Burgess, and described herself as a widow. Her husband, oddly enough, was called Richard Baker, and they had one daughter born the following year. For the next thirty years she supplied leeches to the Bristol Infirmary, respectable, genteel, and apparently embarrassed (as when children ran after her calling &#145;Caraboo!&#146;) by her earlier notoriety. She fell dead in Mill Street, Bedminster, on Christmas eve 1864, and was buried in Hebron Road burial-ground. Her daughter, Mary, carried on the business, living alone in Bedminster in a house full of cats until her death in a fire in February 1900.<br>
