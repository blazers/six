<span class="headword">Hillier,  Edward Guy</span>  (1857&#150;1924), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born on 11 March 1857 in Cambridge, the posthumous son of Charles Batten Hillier (<i>d</i>. 1856), British consul in Bangkok and sometime chief magistrate of Hong Kong, and his wife, Eliza Mary, the daughter of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18494/', "Revd Dr W. H. Medhurst (1796&#150;1857)")</script> of the London Missionary Society. He was the youngest son in a family of three sons and one daughter. He was educated at Blundell's School, Tiverton, Devon, and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he gained a BA in Chinese studies. Fluent in the language, he was first employed as tutor to Robert W. Buchanan-Jardine and went to the East as private secretary to the governor of British North Borneo. He briefly joined Jardine Matheson in Hong Kong, but in 1883 was recruited by Ewen Cameron, then Shanghai manager, for the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. In 1885, after training in Shanghai, he was sent north to the Tientsin (Tianjin) office and from there to Peking (Beijing), where Cameron foresaw China's future sovereign-risk loans would be negotiated.<br>
<br>When Hillier first entered Peking it was as a resident representative with no right, as defined by the treaties, to undertake business. Local bankers objected, and the Hongkong Bank for a period lay low. Hillier went on leave in 1886, but the banking activities of the &#145;sub-agency&#146; were tentatively re-established by Charles Addis. After a period in Tientsin, where he was a successful amateur jockey, Hillier returned to Peking in 1891, at which time the existence of the agency was announced formally. In 1894, in Peking, he married his first wife, Ada (<i>d</i>. 1917), the daughter of Frederick William Everett, a stockbroker; they had two daughters and two sons, including the painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31235/', "Tristram Paul Hillier")</script>.<br>
<br>Hillier undertook routine banking while establishing an intelligence network through the compradores. He supervised young bank staff assigned to Peking for language study. He was the intimate of the legations in part helped by his brother Walter Caine Hillier, who was for a time Chinese secretary of the British legation. Hillier was also friendly with Sir Robert Hart, the inspector-general of the Chinese maritime customs. All sought his advice, but Hillier's main negotiations were connected with China's major borrowing&#151;first for the finance of the Sino-Japanese War, then for the 1896 and 1898 indemnity loans, for railway construction, and, finally, for the 1913 reorganization loan.<br>
<br>By 1896 Hillier had lost the sight of one eye; the other was threatened with glaucoma. He left China temporarily for what proved to be an unsuccessful operation in Vienna, and was on leave when the Boxers laid siege to the Peking legations in 1900. The uprising was, however, virtually confined to the north of China; Hillier accordingly negotiated and signed on behalf of the bank, then acting for the British government, a loan with the co-operative Hukuang (Huguang) viceroy, Zhang Zhidang, enabling him to pay his troops. In 1901 Hillier became the British representative on the Shanghai-based International Commission of Bankers dealing with the technical aspects of the Boxer indemnity. For this he was created CMG in 1904.<br>
<br>In Peking loan negotiations had become increasingly politicized. Indeed, of all the foreign bank managers in the capital Hillier was the only qualified banker, the others having been seconded from their respective diplomatic services. By 1907, however, he was virtually blind and offered to resign; instead, the bank provided him with a private secretary, Eleanor Isabella, the daughter of the China missionary Dr Timothy Richard. They were married in 1919.<br>
<br>Hillier continued to represent the Hongkong Bank in Peking until his death. The bank had become the British member of a multinational consortium, popularly known as the &#145;China consortium&#146;. In the early post-Boxer years Hillier had expected to work closely with the British and Chinese Corporation, of which the Hongkong Bank was joint manager in China (with Jardine Matheson), and with the Chinese Central Railways, a combination of British, French, and Belgian interests. The early railway loan negotiations assumed the lender would retain control of each project through the associated companies, but this ran counter to &#145;Young China&#146; sentiment typified by the Rights Recovery Movement. Hillier began reluctantly to negotiate purely financial loans. This brought him into conflict with the outspoken publicist J. O. P. Bland, the British and Chinese Corporation's representative in China; Bland was dismissed. As a principal negotiator for the consortium, in 1911 Hillier successfully concluded the &pound;6 million Hukuang Railways loan, but, fearing that any official recognition would aggravate international rivalries, Sir Charles Addis, then the bank's London manager, advised the Foreign Office against a proposed knighthood for Hillier.<br>
<br>In the intrigues that accompanied the eventually successful negotiations for the &pound;25 million reorganization loan (1913), Hillier underestimated China's ability to find alternative sources of finance. In consequence, China for a time circumvented consortium controls by accepting the Birch Crisp loan (1912), masterminded by Charles Birch Crisp.<br>
<br>During the First World War, European finance for Chinese development was impractical. Hillier, moreover, suffered personal losses; his eldest son was killed and his first wife died, although he was able to return briefly to England in 1917 to be at her deathbed. Political critics of his policies attempted unsuccessfully to brand him &#145;pro-German&#146;, a charge lent credibility because of his official and personal relations with Heinrich Cordes, the manager of the Deutsch-Asiatische Bank and an alleged German agent.<br>
<br>After the war the New China consortium was established by a formal government-to-government agreement, which the experienced Hillier deplored as impractical. He nevertheless remained as representative of a more broadly based British group, his work frustrated by petty arguments and, more importantly, by China's lack of creditworthiness. In his final years in Peking, Hillier, the great banker&#150;diplomat, had become a mere intermediary, with policy decided in London by Sir Charles Addis. Yet he remained a symbol to contemporaries of that unique era&#151;the last days of imperial China. His long experience with the language enabled him to develop a system of Braille for Chinese; in 1917 he founded Peking's first public school for the blind. A Roman Catholic, he played the organ at the French Catholic Cathedral to the last.<br>
<br>In late 1923 Hillier's health deteriorated further, and he died in the German Hospital in Peking on 12 April 1924. His pallbearers included the doyen of the diplomatic corps, the British and French ministers, and representatives of the foreign-managed customs, salt, and postal administrations. Other heads of diplomatic missions followed the cort&egrave;ge on foot through the legation quarter. Hillier was buried on 13 April in the cathedral cemetery. Had he lived but a few more months, he would have received a knighthood: his name was intended for inclusion in the king's birthday honours list.<br>
<br>As the representative of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in Peking 1885&#150;6 and from 1891 to his death in 1924, Hillier tested the very limits of the &#145;treaty system&#146;, establishing close relations both with modernizing compradores and with imperial officials. It was Hillier's genius to understand the politics of the foreign diplomatic community, to learn what was possible in the London market, to determine what was acceptable politically in China, and to match all three&#151;on terms to the benefit of the Hongkong Bank, its associate companies, and, indeed, the general British position in China.<br>
