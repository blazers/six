<span class="headword">Steele,  Anne</span>  (1717&#150;1778), <span class="occ">hymn writer and poet</span>, daughter of William Steele (1689&#150;1769), timber merchant and Baptist pastor, was born at Broughton, Hampshire. In 1769 the family moved from the village to Broughton House nearby. The view from the terrace walk in the garden is said to have inspired her poem &#145;A Rural Meditation&#146;, beginning &#145;What soft delight the peaceful bosom warms!&#146; Her health was delicate, after a hip injury at the age of eighteen; and she suffered a great shock when her fianc&eacute; (probably), James Elcombe, was drowned shortly before their intended wedding. This gave rise to the idea of Anne Steele as the prototype of the tragic unmarried hymn writer, turning her sorrow into song. However, she subsequently received a proposal of marriage from the Baptist pastor and hymn writer Benjamin Beddome, which she refused. She led a quiet and unremarkable life thereafter, though communicating freely with friends and other writers.<br>
<br>Steele is notable for being one of the first of British women hymn writers, and the first to become widely known. In the nineteenth century she was widely regarded as an example to other women, not only in her poetical devotion but also in the supposed preference for an uneventful life: &#145;the duties of friendship and religion occupied her time, and the pleasures of both constituted her delight&#146;  (Evans, preface). In 1760, using the pseudonym Theodosia, she published <span class="italic">Poems on Subjects Chiefly Devotional</span>: it included metrical versions of forty-seven psalms, together with religious poems and hymns. Many of them were concerned with responses to affliction, such as &#145;Desiring Resignation and Thankfulness&#146;, &#145;Desiring a Cheerful Resignation to the Divine Will&#146;, and &#145;The Presence of God the only Comfort in Affliction&#146;. In 1780 Caleb Evans, hymnologist and Baptist minister from Bristol, added prose exercises of a religious kind in <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Pieces in Prose and Verse</span>. These include short essays on human life, on death, on the frailty of humanity, and on the mercy of God. Evans, introducing the book, said that &#145;Her life was a life of unaffected humility, warm benevolence, sincere friendship, and genuine devotion&#146;  (preface). Her complete works were published in the USA (Boston, 1808), with a preface by Evans, and in Britain by Daniel Sedgwick (1863), with a verbose memoir by John Sheppard.<br>
<br>Steele herself was modest about her work, and gave away her profits to worthy causes. She became well known in her own lifetime, and was visited by Hannah More. Her hymns remained in use until recent times, the best-known being:<blockquote>
<div>Father of mercies, in Thy word<br>
</div>
<div>What endless glory shines!<br>
</div>
</blockquote>She read widely, and acknowledged debts to Alexander Pope, Thomas Gray, and Isaac Watts, often echoing Watts, as in &#145;When I survey life's varied scene&#146;, or in her poems about the created world, such as &#145;There is a God, all nature speaks&#146;. This hymn was printed in the fourth edition of J. Ash's and C. Evans's <span class="italic">A Collection of Hymns Adapted to Public Worship</span> (1781), over the signature &#145;T&#146; (Theodosia). That volume contained no fewer than fifty-five of Anne Steele's hymns; &#145;Father of mercies&#146; is the only one that survived into recent times, and even that has disappeared from modern hymn books. The reason is that she was probably not quite original enough in her hymns. Her dependence on the example of Isaac Watts is clear, as in &#145;A Dying Saviour&#146;, when she describes the crucified Christ:<blockquote>
<div>See, from his hands, his feet, his side,<br>
</div>
<div>Runs down the sacred crimson tide.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Steele's brief fame as the great female writer of hymns was probably due to the championship of her work by Caleb Evans, and her hymns began to be lost in hymnbooks during the flood of new writing in the nineteenth century. But she deserves a place in the history of hymnology because she was a woman writer who was able, at least for a hundred years, to articulate the movements of the feeling heart in response to the passion and death of her Saviour. Her own experience of grief gave her an insight into suffering, and the sense of a need for peace: again and again her hymns stress the importance of mercy and the peace to the soul which it brings. That these things were articulated more memorably and dramatically by Charles Wesley does not invalidate her own achievement, nor does it excuse the present-day church for its neglect of her work. Anne Steele died at Broughton House on 11 November 1778 and was buried in Broughton.<br>
