<span class="headword">Cheadle,  Walter Butler</span>  (1835&#150;1910), <span class="occ">physician</span>, born at Colne, Lancashire, on 15 October 1835, was the son of James Cheadle, thirteenth wrangler at Cambridge in 1831, who was vicar of Christ Church, Colne, and later of Bingley, Yorkshire, and his wife, Eliza, daughter of John Butler of Ruddington, Nottinghamshire. Educated at Bingley grammar school, he proceeded in 1855 to Cambridge as a scholar of Gonville and Caius College. In 1859, when a family bereavement prevented him from rowing in the university eight, he graduated BA. In 1861 he took the MB degree, having studied medicine both at Cambridge and at St George's Hospital, London.<br>
<br>In June 1862, with William Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, Viscount Milton (1839&#150;1877), Cheadle set off to explore the then little known western parts of Canada. On their return in 1864 they jointly published a successful account of their travels as <span class="italic">The North-West Passage by Land</span> (1865), which ran to nine editions by 1901. The book was written by Cheadle, and recounts a notable series of hardships faced in mountainous and untracked country. According to V. G. Hopwood, &#145;With its analysis of the prospects of the prairies and British Columbia, the book helped prepare opinion in both Britain and Canada for the end of Hudson's Bay Company rule, and the inclusion of the west in the union. Its intelligent estimate of the value of the Yellowhead pass was vindicated by the route's being chosen for the Grand Trunk Pacific&#146;  (Hopwood, 700). Cheadle's diary of their trip was published in 1931 as <span class="italic">Cheadle's Journal of a Trip across Canada, 1862&#150;1863</span> (ed. A. Doughty and G. Lanctot). Cheadle then returned to Cambridge, proceeding MA and MD in 1865. He became a member of the Royal College of Physicians in that year and was elected a fellow in 1870; he was subsequently councillor (1889&#150;91), censor (1892&#150;3), and senior censor (1898); he acted as examiner in medicine in the college (1885&#150;8). In 1900 he delivered the Lumleian lectures before the college &#145;On some cirrhoses of the liver&#146;. Meanwhile he was elected physician to the Western General Dispensary in 1865, and assistant physician to St Mary's Hospital in 1867, both in London. He remained associated with St Mary's and its medical school for nearly forty years. He was dean of the medical school (1869&#150;73), and guided it through a critical period of its existence, and under his guidance the school more than doubled the number of its students. He became physician to in-patients in 1885, and remained on the staff until 1904, when he was appointed honorary consulting physician. During his career at St Mary's he acted variously as dermatologist and as lecturer in materia medica and therapeutics, in pathology, in medicine jointly with Sir William Broadbent and David Bridge Lees, and in clinical medicine. Cheadle also did much good work for St Mary's medical school, helping to found scholarships and encouraging the athletic clubs. In 1898 he gave over &pound;1000 to endow a Cheadle prize (value &pound;20) and a gold medal for an essay on clinical medicine. As a teacher he was best at the bedside with senior students and qualified men. In treatment Cheadle relied on experience and intuition, and while always careful to ease his patients' suffering he put faith in nature and time as healing agents.<br>
<br>Cheadle is, however, best remembered as a pioneering paediatrician. In 1869 he was also appointed assistant physician to the Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street, where he worked until 1892, when he became honorary consulting physician. Although he disliked being called a specialist, his private practice mainly lay among children and his chief writings dealt with children's health and ailments. Tall and of heavy build, Cheadle was dignified and reserved in manner, but won the confidence of his many child patients by his great kindliness and charm of manner.<br>
<br>Cheadle's professional distinction lies in his original research into the connection between poor nutrition and illness in infancy and childhood. He was the first, in 1877, to define the nature of a then mysterious childhood disease characterized by pain and tenderness of the limbs, haemorrhages, and swelling of the gums. He attributed the disease to artificial foods that possessed no antiscorbutic properties, giving it the name &#145;infantile scurvy&#146;. The pathology of the disease was afterwards worked out by Sir Thomas Barlow, who reported in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> in 1878. In 1889, Cheadle published a series of lectures on the proper way to feed infants, under the title <span class="italic">On the principles and exact conditions to be observed in the artificial feeding of infants; the properties of artificial foods; and the diseases which arise from faults of diet in early life</span>. Among his other interests were the rheumatic diseases of childhood, the subject of his Harveian lectures in 1888. Cheadle maintained that the true type of acute rheumatism is that which occurs with manifold and serious symptoms and complications in childhood, and not the less severe affection of adult life.<br>
<br>Cheadle was married twice: first on 31 January 1866, to Anne, youngest daughter of William Murgatroyd of Bankfield, near Bingley, Yorkshire; and second on 4 August 1892, to Emily, daughter of Robert Mansel, of Rothbury, Northumberland, inspector of Queen Victoria's Jubilee Institute for Nurses. Both wives predeceased him.<br>
<br>A radical in politics, Cheadle was one of the early supporters in face of much professional opposition of the claims of women to enter the medical profession, and was one of the first to lecture at the London School of Medicine for Women. He visited Canada with the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1884, and contracted dysentery, which permanently damaged his health. Cheadle died on 25 March 1910 at his home, 19 Portman Street, Portman Square, London, and was buried on 30 March in Ocklynge cemetery, Eastbourne. He was survived by four sons from his first marriage.<br>
