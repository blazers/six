<span class="headword">Voelcker,  (John Christopher) Augustus</span>  (1822&#150;1884), <span class="occ">agricultural chemist</span>, was born on 24 September 1822 at Frankfurt am Main, the fifth son (in a family of seven sons and one daughter) of Frederick Adolphus Voelcker, a Frankfurt merchant. His father died in 1833 and early ill health postponed the commencement of his formal schooling until the age of twelve. However, with the energy which Voelcker evinced throughout his career, by the age of sixteen he was sufficiently well educated to gain employment as a pharmacist's assistant at Frankfurt; in 1842 he was appointed as a manager of a pharmacy business at Schaffhausen. In 1844 he entered the University of G&ouml;ttingen where he studied chemistry under Professor W&ouml;hler; he also attended Liebig's influential lectures at Giessen. He was awarded the degree of doctor of philosophy at G&ouml;ttingen in 1846, the subject of his doctoral dissertation being the composition of tortoiseshell. He then investigated compounds of manganese and other metals and published the results of his laboratory experiments in German and Dutch scientific periodicals. W&ouml;hler recommended him to Professor Gerrit Jan Mulder at Utrecht; Voelcker became an assistant and aided him in the preparation of <span class="italic">Chemische Untersuchungen</span> (1852). Mulder was much interested in the study of physiological chemistry, especially in its relation to vegetable and animal production, and this work had a considerable influence on Voelcker's later career.<br>
<br>In February 1847 Voelcker went to Edinburgh as assistant to J. F. W. Johnston, then chemist to the Agricultural Chemistry Society of Scotland. He lectured on Johnston's behalf at Durham University, a remarkable transition for a native German speaker. There was scarcely a trace of a foreign idiom in his writing, which was noted for its clarity, although this facility can have been gained only by great determination. While in Scotland he formed a close friendship with George Wilson (1818&#150;1859), the regius professor of technology at Edinburgh. It was at this time that he first came into contact with farmers and their agricultural requirements.<br>
<br>In August 1849 Voelcker was appointed professor of chemistry at the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester (founded in 1844), where he began a series of field experiments and extensive laboratory investigations. In 1852 he married Susanna Wilhelm of Frankfurt; they had four sons and a daughter. The eldest son, George, died at the age of twenty-three in 1876 from diphtheria contracted while training in hospital as a medical student. In 1855 Voelcker was appointed consulting chemist to the Royal Bath and West Society and two years later he gained the same position at the Royal Agricultural Society of England.<br>
<br>Voelcker left Cirencester for London in 1863 and commenced private practice as a consulting chemist at a laboratory which he established in Salisbury Square. His advice was in constant demand on technical and legal inquiries, especially those in connection with sewage, water and gas supply, river pollution, and agricultural holdings. He was one of the jurors of the international exhibition of 1862, of the fisheries exhibition of 1883, and of the health exhibition of 1884. In 1870 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. He was one of the founders and an early vice-president of the Institute of Chemistry of Great Britain and Ireland, established in 1877.<br>
<br>It was through his work for the Royal Agricultural Society of England that Voelcker made his greatest mark. Every half-yearly volume of the society's <span class="italic">Journal</span> between 1857 and 1884 contains one or more of his extensive contributions. He carried out a large range of agricultural investigations for the society and, between 1865 and 1884, completed 13,068 chemical analyses for its members. At a time when farmers were often sold substandard or adulterated samples of fertilizers or feeding-stuffs the publication of Voelcker's impartial and meticulous analyses&#151;which on occasion led to litigation&#151;was an important way in which quality guarantees could be achieved. The high regard in which he was held in the agricultural community was marked by his election to the chairmanship of the London Farmers' Club in 1875; no man, it was said, &#145;ever more happily united &#147;Science with Practice&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">Farmer's Magazine</span>).<br>
<br>Voelcker's experimental work and writings on agricultural chemistry were marked by analytical precision and thoroughness. Although he did not write a comprehensive textbook and made no revolutionary discoveries, his work on the composition of farmyard manures and fertilizers, soil processes, the feeding of animals, milk, and dairy practice contributed significant increments of knowledge to agricultural science.<br>
<br>Voelcker took a considerable interest in religious movements and was an active participant in the affairs of the British and Foreign Bible Society. He died of heart disease on 5 December 1884 at his London home, 39 Argyll Road, Kensington and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery. Two of his sons, John Augustus and William, continued the consulting practice that he had established. The former also succeeded him as the Royal Agricultural Society of England's consulting chemist and occupied the position until 1938. Indeed, a member of the Voelcker family continued to act in that capacity until 1976&#151;an outstanding example of family continuity in professional service.<br>
