<span class="headword">Turner,  Henry</span>  (1656/7&#150;1724), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was the eldest son of John Turner (<i>d</i>. 1669), a merchant of Fulham, London, and his wife, Martha Pettiward (<i>d</i>. 1681) of Putney, Surrey. Turner's parents married in December 1655, John Turner receiving a marriage portion of &pound;2500. With some of this money, in 1658 John Turner purchased some land from the St John family in Leicestershire, and acquired a mortgage on Cold Overton Hall, where he made his seat. Henry Turner was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 6 February 1672, and he may have entered Oriel College, Oxford, on 28 April 1672. The law was his chosen career, and he was called to the bar on 9 July 1679. In 1681 Turner had to ward off a challenge to his right to present to Sapcote, Leicestershire, from the earl of Huntingdon.<br>
<br>Turner married on 9 February 1688 at St Martin Outwich, London, Mary (1671/2&#150;1735), daughter of Thomas Frewen MP of Brickwell House, Northiam, Sussex, and his second wife, Bridget Layton. They had one son and one daughter. In June 1691 Turner and his fellow barrister Edward Strode challenged the right of the masters of the bench of Lincoln's Inn to appoint a preacher in succession to John Tillotson, the new archbishop of Canterbury, but without success. Turner was made a serjeant-at-law in November 1700, being sponsored by his father-in-law, Frewen, and the tory politician Anthony Hammond.<br>
<br>Turner was presumably a very active barrister, for in December 1717 he was sufficiently wealthy to invest &pound;600 in East India Company stock. He served as treasurer of Serjeants' Inn from 1721 to 1724. Turner died on 29 March 1724, aged sixty-seven, while attending the assizes at Coventry, and was buried at Sapcote on 4 April. His will, made in December 1718, made reference to the fact that most of his landed estate had been settled previously. The remainder of his real and personal estate was left to his son, John (1691&#150;1753), also a barrister. In 1727 John married Selina Frewen, the daughter of Sir Edward Frewen and a granddaughter of Thomas Frewen and his first wife, Judith Woolverstone. Turner's daughter, Martha (1695&#150;1752), had married in 1713 Selina's brother, Thomas Frewen. Turner's wife survived him, dying on 13 October 1735.<br>
