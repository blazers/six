<span class="headword">Trevet, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1280/81), <span class="occ">justice</span>, came of a small landowning family in Somerset; the Ralph Trevet who preceded him as lord of Durborough in that county must have been his kinsman, but may not have been his father. Thomas is first recorded in 1241, when he made several appearances as an attorney on the bench, and he pursued a legal and administrative career thereafter. In 1255 he was one of two knights instructed to act with commissioners selling woods in Somerset to pay royal debts, and at about this time he was at least twice a colleague of Henry of Bratton as an assize justice in Somerset. He was also steward to the abbots of Athelney and Glastonbury, in 1256 serving the latter as a justice itinerant within the liberty of the twelve hides of Glastonbury. In 1260 he was an assessor of tallage in the south-western counties, and in 1262 he twice headed commissions to deliver Ilchester gaol.<br>
<br>In the political crisis of the mid-1260s Trevet appears to have been regarded at first as a royalist, since in March 1264 he was among those whom Henry III summoned to come armed to Oxford. But he may have seemed to waver in his loyalty to the king, for after the battle of Evesham (4 August 1265) he was suspected of Montfortian sympathies and his lands were taken into the king's hand; his estate at North Barsham in Norfolk was given to a royalist and not recovered until March 1266. But Trevet clearly managed to prove his loyalty to the crown, for on 2 April 1268 he was appointed a justice itinerant, with a salary of &pound;40 per annum, on the circuit of eyres headed by Richard Middleton in the south-west and midlands between then and July 1269, while in 1272 he served in a similar capacity under Ralph Hengham on eyres in Herefordshire, Staffordshire, and Shropshire. Between the eyres he took assizes in Somerset, Devon, and Dorset, and in 1269 was an assessor of that year's twentieth in Dorset. He did not act as a justice itinerant again after 1272, but during the 1270s he was several times a justice of assize and gaol delivery and a commissioner of oyer and terminer.<br>
<br>Thomas Trevet was still alive in July 1280, when he attended that year's Somerset eyre, but was dead by 5 March 1281. By 1254 he had married Eleanor, daughter of Joan Braunche, who brought him his lands in Norfolk. However, fines from the mid-1250s suggest that this marriage was then fairly recently contracted, and since Trevet's heir at his death was his son William, who was said at that time to be aged forty, it seems likely that Thomas had also made an earlier marriage. The chronicler and Dominican friar <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27744/', "Nicholas Trevet")</script> was a younger son, and may have owed something of his religious vocation to his father, since in April 1263 Thomas Trevet gave the black friars of Ilchester a messuage in the suburbs of that town, and was consequently received by the prior &#145;into all the benefits and orisons in his church&#146;  (<span class="italic">Feet of Fines &hellip; Somerset</span>, 1.204).<br>
