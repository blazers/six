<span class="headword">Steevens,  Richard</span>  (1653&#150;1710), <span class="occ">physician and benefactor</span>, and <a name="cosubject_69279"></a><span class="headword">Grizell Steevens</span>  (1653&#150;1747), his sister, born in Wiltshire, were the twin children of John Steevens (<i>d</i>. 1682), an English royalist clergyman, and his wife, Constance. The family left Wiltshire for Ireland some time after 1654, and John Steevens was made rector of St Mary's, Athlone, by Charles II in 1664. Richard Steevens received his education at the Latin school in Athlone and in 1670 entered Trinity College, Dublin, where he obtained a scholarship in 1674 and graduated BA in 1675 and MA in 1678. He seems to have been intended by his father to enter the church, and took deacon's orders; however, he proceeded no further in the ministry, and, possibly following his father's death in 1682, instead chose the medical profession. In 1687 he received the degree of MD from his university.<br>
<br>Steevens practised as a physician in Dublin, amassing a considerable fortune of &pound;12,000, which must have been from his practice as his family was not wealthy. He remained unmarried and lived in lodgings in William Street. He was named a fellow of the Irish College of Physicians in their 1692 charter and held several offices in the college, including being twice elected president, in 1703 and 1710. He died before the close of his second year of office, on 15 December 1710, in Dublin, where he was buried privately late at night in St Peter's Church, near his mother's grave.<br>
<br>By his will Steevens bequeathed the bulk of his property to his sister Grizell for her life, and directed that upon her death it should be used in building, and subsequently maintaining, a hospital in Dublin &#145;for maintaining and curing from time to time such sick and wounded persons whose distempers and wounds are curable&#146;. Grizell Steevens, being &#145;desirous that the said charitable bequest of her dear brother should begin to take effect in her lifetime&#146;, surrendered her estate to the trustees in 1717, keeping only &pound;100 a year out of an income of &pound;600, together with apartments in the hospital when built. She also gave &pound;2000 towards the cost of building. It took sixteen years before the institution known as Dr Steevens' Hospital was completed, in 1733, at a cost of &pound;16,000. It was the first public hospital established in Dublin, where it became one of the foremost institutions of its kind. Dean Swift was one of its earliest governors, and Stella (Esther Johnson) in her will bequeathed &pound;1000 towards the maintenance of a chaplain of the hospital, so long as the Church of Ireland should remain established. Another benefactor was John Sterne, bishop of Clogher. Grizell Steevens died in Dublin on 18 March 1747. By her will she bequeathed the residue of her property to the governors of the hospital. Her remains were interred in the hospital chapel.<br>
