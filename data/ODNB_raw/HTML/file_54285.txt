<span class="headword">MacDougall,  John</span>, lord of Argyll  (<em>d.</em> 1316), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49385/', "Alexander MacDougall")</script>, lord of Argyll (<i>d</i>. 1310), with whose career his own is largely intertwined, the grandson of Ewen MacDougall, lord of Argyll and king in the Hebrides, and a descendant of Somerled (<i>d</i>. 1164), king of the Hebrides and <i>regulus</i> of Argyll and Kintyre. John's mother, it would appear, was a member of the powerful Comyn family, probably a daughter of John Comyn, lord of Badenoch (<i>d</i>. 1277). Although later historians have almost invariably styled him John of Lorne and he is better known to generations of Scots as such, contemporary accounts style him John of Argyll (<i>de Ergadia</i>). There seems to be no contemporary authority for the byname Bacach (&#145;the Lame&#146;), now often attached to him. This may have arisen through confusion with a cousin and namesake.<br>
<br>MacDougall first appears on record in 1291 when he swore fealty to Edward I. He followed his father, Alexander, in supporting the Balliol party, with whom the Comyns were closely connected. By tradition it was John who was responsible for the death of Cailin Mor, chief of the Campbells, in a skirmish at the String of Lorne about 1296. Like Alexander, John became a committed supporter of Edward I, who expressed his trust in him in a letter written in 1304. In 1305 Alexander was named a member of the advisory council of John of Brittany (<i>d</i>. 1334), Edward I's lieutenant in Scotland. John MacDougall's cousin, the former guardian John Comyn of Badenoch, was slain by Robert Bruce in the church of the Greyfriars in Dumfries in 1306. Later that year MacDougall defeated Robert, now king of Scots, and dispersed his followers at Dalrigh in Argyll, all but bringing to a premature end both his career as king and his life. According to Barbour, MacDougall compared Robert's near miraculous escape to that of Goll MacMorna from Finn MacCumhail. It was on this occasion that a dying MacDougall is said to have wrested from the fugitive king the brooch of Lorne.<br>
<br>In 1307 Edward II appointed MacDougall sheriff of Argyll and Inchegall (the Hebrides). In 1308, however, John wrote to Edward explaining that his position was becoming increasingly desperate and seeking assistance against the advancing forces of Robert I. No help was forthcoming, and later that year Robert defeated MacDougall by Ben Cruachan (&#145;the battle of the Pass of Brander&#146;) and took the MacDougall headquarters of Dunstaffnage. John fled to England to be joined there later by his now elderly father, who had temporarily entered King Robert's peace. (Barbour's statement that John was captured by Robert and sent to Dumbarton and then to Lochleven, where he died in captivity, is without foundation.) Both John and Alexander attended Edward II's council at Westminster in 1310. In 1311 and 1314 John (named as Monsire Jehan Dargail) was appointed admiral and captain of an English fleet, and in 1315 he recovered the Isle of Man for England. He was granted a pension by Edward II in 1316 and died in September that year at Ospring in Kent on pilgrimage to Canterbury, having appointed as his executor another displaced Scot, Dungal MacDowall of Galloway.<br>
<br>The name of MacDougall's wife is not known. His sons Ewen and Alan were members of the household of Edward II of England, the former when Edward was still prince of Wales. Gaelic genealogical tradition gives John two further sons, Somhairle and Alexander Og. He had at least two daughters: Mary, who married John Stirling of Rathoran, and an unnamed daughter married to Patrick Graham. MacDougall's reputation has suffered on account of his opposition to Robert I, yet it is impossible not to discern in the accounts of Barbour in the fourteenth century and Blind Hary in the fifteenth, relayed again in Sir Walter Scott's <span class="italic">Tales of a Grandfather</span> (1828&#150;30), more than a little grudging respect.<br>
<br>John's son Ewen appears to have returned briefly to Scotland in the 1330s in the following of Edward Balliol, but it was John's grandson and namesake, by his son Alan, who re-established the MacDougalls in Argyll, though the circumstances remain obscure. This <a name="cosubject_54285"></a><span class="headword">John MacDougall</span>, lord of Lorne  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1371), is on record in 1338. Known traditionally as John Gallda (&#145;the Foreigner&#146;) and usually styled John of Lorne, he styled himself lord of Argyll in an agreement concerning lands in dispute that he entered into with his remote cousin John MacDonald, chief of his name and lord of the Isles. He married Jonet Isaac, daughter of Thomas Isaac and Matilda Bruce, daughter of Robert I and full sister of David II. MacDougall renewed the family's foothold in Argyll in a modest way, but it never regained the power and status which it had enjoyed before the wars of independence. John seems to have died in or after 1371, leaving two daughters, Isabel and Jonet, married respectively to Sir John Stewart of Innermeath and his brother Sir Robert Stewart of Durrisdeer. The lordship of Lorne passed to John and Isabel and their descendants. MacDougall also appears to have left a son, Alan, perhaps from an uncanonical union. The later chiefs of MacDougall descend from this Alan, rather than from a brother of Alexander of Argyll, named Duncan, as is usually claimed.<br>
