<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wild,  Robert</span>  (1615/16&#150;1679), <span class="occ">nonconformist minister and satirical poet</span>, was born at St Ives, Huntingdonshire, the son of Robert Wild, shoemaker. After attending a private school at St Ives he was admitted as a sizar at St John's College, Cambridge, on 26 January 1632, aged sixteen, and named a scholar on 6 November 1634. He graduated BA in 1636 and proceeded MA in 1639. He was ordained a deacon at Peterborough on 18 February 1638 and a priest on 22 December 1639. For a time he apparently could find employment only as an usher in a free school. In spite of having proceeded BD at Oxford in November 1642, by order of the House of Commons Wild was appointed rector of Aynho, Northamptonshire, on 22 July 1646, and James Long, the previous incumbent, was sequestered on 10 December 1646. By 1644 Wild had married; he and his wife, Joyce (<i>d</i>. 1687), had at least three children&#151;Robert (1644/5&#150;1691), John (<i>d</i>. 1682?), and James.<br>
<br>A definitive canon of Wild's works has not been established. Indeed, the author of <span class="italic">A Scourge for the Libeller</span> (1672) complained, with exaggeration, that every anonymous &#145;sheet&#146; was attributed to Wild. One of his earliest works appears to have been &#145;The combat of the cocks&#146;, which appeared without attribution in Thomas Randall's <span class="italic">The High and Mighty Commendation</span> (1642), and then anonymously as <span class="italic">A Horrible, Terrible, Troublesome, Historical Narration of a Duel</span> (1660); it was identified as Wild's work in the second edition of his <span class="italic">Iter boreale</span> (1661) and in Charles Cotton's <span class="italic">The Complete Gamester</span> (1674). Another early work, although not published until 1689, may have been <span class="italic">The Benefice: a Comedy</span>; in the tradition of the Elizabethan Marprelate tracts, it recounts the bitterness of the Book-worm, a young divine, toward the patron Marchurch who is interested only in selling a clerical living, not in the learning of a prospective incumbent. <span class="italic">The Incomparable Poem Gondibert, Vindicated</span> (1655), which praises Sir William Davenant, has been attributed to Wild. His erudition is manifest in <span class="italic">The Arraignment of a Sinner at the Bar of Divine Justice</span> (1656), a sermon preached at the assizes in Oxford and dedicated to his patron, John Cartwright of Aynho, sheriff of Oxfordshire.<br>
<br>A friend of Richard Baxter, Wild shared his dislike of sectaries though not his interest in theological debate. The execution of the presbyterian minister Christopher Love in 1651 inspired Wild to write <span class="italic">The Tragedy of Christopher Love</span> (1660), in which he denounced &#145;cruell <i>Cromwell</i>, whelp of that mad Star&#146; Sirius, likening him to Herod. Wild later again vented his dislike of the former lord protector in <span class="italic">Oliver Cromwells Ghost</span> [1678?]. He welcomed George Monck's restoration of monarchy, on which he wrote &#145;<i>Exit Tyrannus</i> over <i>Lambert</i>'s dore&#146;. His praise for Monck as the saviour of the nation from tyranny and the sectaries was effusive:<blockquote>
<div>
<i>Monck</i>! the great <i>Monck</i>! That syllable out-shines<br>
</div>
<div>
<i>Plantagenet</i>'s bright name, or <i>Constantine</i>'s. &hellip;<br>
</div>
<div>He took Rebellion rampant, by the Throat,<br>
</div>
<div>And made the Canting <i>Quaker</i> change his Note.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>The poem from which these lines are taken, <span class="italic">Iter boreale</span>  (p. 5), was published on St George's day, 23 April 1660, and achieved wide popularity, with eight editions appearing by 1674, including two in 1668. Its success inspired others to write sequels: <span class="italic">Iter boreale, the Second Part</span> (1660), by T. H., and <span class="italic">An Essay to a Continuation of Iter boreale</span> (1660).<br>
<br>At the Restoration Long regained his cure at Aynho, but Charles II, undoubtedly wanting to reward Wild for his support, presented him with the rectory of Tatenhill, Staffordshire, where he was inducted on 1 September 1660. He was created DD by Oxford on 9 November 1660 and by Cambridge the following year. The publication of a second edition of <span class="italic">Iter boreale</span> in 1661 enabled Wild to append a number of shorter poems, most of which were elegies to the earl of Essex and puritan ministers such as Richard Vines, &#145;our English <i>Luther</i>&#146;  (p. 35), Jeremiah Whitaker, Stephen Marshall, and Jeremiah Burroughs. The works of Edward Reynolds, who conformed and became bishop of Norwich, received special praise. Refusing to conform himself, Wild was ejected from his living at Tatenhill in 1662 and moved to Oundle, Northamptonshire. A corpulent man, he suffered so severely from gout that he was incapacitated from preaching for months at a time, yet he retained a sense of humour, comparing his confinement at the hands of Bishop Gout to Edward Calamy's incarceration for preaching illegally following his ejection. This became the subject of Wild's <span class="italic">A Poem upon the Imprisonment of Mr. Calamy</span> [1663], in which he castigated the bishops:<blockquote>
<div>&hellip; see them Steeple upon Steeple set,<br>
</div>
<div>As if they meant that way to Heaven to get.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>In <span class="italic">Anti-boreale</span> [1663] Bishop Laurence Womock retorted by calling Wild &#145;<i>one</i> of Geneva-<i>Basan Bulls fat breed</i>&#146; and assigning him partial responsibility for the regicide  (fol. a3<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>). No less acerbic was <span class="italic">On Calamy's Imprisonment, and Wild's Poetry</span> [1663], which prematurely wrote Wild's epitaph:<blockquote>
<div>This <i>Presbyterian Brat</i> was <i>born</i> and <i>cry'd</i>,<br>
</div>
<div>
<i>Spit in his Mothers Face</i>, and so he <i>dy'd</i>.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>This work has been unconvincingly attributed to George Sacheverell, presumably because he copied it into his commonplace book  (BL, Add. MS 28758), and to Samuel Butler, who denied authorship in <span class="italic">On the Answer to Dr Wilds Poem</span> (1663) and condemned the anonymous writer for having vilified Wild and Calamy. The other replies to Wild's poem on Calamy's imprisonment were <span class="italic">To R. W., D.D.</span> (1662 [1663]), <span class="italic">Dr. Wild's Echo</span> [1663], <span class="italic">An Answer for Mr Calamie</span> (1663), <span class="italic">To the Ark in Newgate</span> (1663), and <span class="italic">An Answer to Wild</span> [1663], the last of which portrayed him as &#145;a poor <i>Erratick</i>&#146;. His defenders lashed back at &#145;Hudibras&#146;, the reputed author of <span class="italic">On Calamy's Imprisonment</span>, in <span class="italic">Hudibras Answered by True de Case</span> [1663] and <span class="italic">Your Servant Sir</span> [1663].<br>
<br>In the meantime, in <span class="italic">The Recantation of a Penitent Proteus</span> [1663] Wild wrote a biting satire about Nathaniel Lee, effectively making him a representative of puritans who had conformed to the established church:<blockquote>
<div>If the <i>great Turk</i> to <i>England</i> come, I can<br>
</div>
<div>Make <span class="italic">Gospel</span> truckle to the <span class="italic">Alcoran</span>.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Wild took aim as well at Roger L'Estrange, surveyor of the press, whom he linked to the turncoat Lee:<blockquote>
<div>Our Names ty'd taile to taile make a sweet Change<br>
</div>
<div>Mine onely is <i>St[r]ange</i> <i>Lee</i>, and his <i>Le-Strange</i>.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>He was not finished with L'Estrange, whom he ridiculed in <span class="italic">The Grateful Non-Conformist</span> (1665) for his readiness to &#145;smell a Plot, a <i>Presbyterian</i> Plot&#146;  (p. 67). Nevertheless, L'Estrange licensed <span class="italic">An Essay upon the Late Victory Obtained by &hellip; the Duke of York</span> (1665), in which Wild effused patriotic fervour for James's naval triumph over the Dutch. The poem was reprinted in Edinburgh the same year as <span class="italic">A Gratulatory Verse</span>.<br>
<br>Although Wild has been described as a royalist, his principles harmonized with those of most protestant dissenters. In <span class="italic">The Loyal Nonconformist</span> (1666) he professed loyalty to monarchical government and his readiness to take an oath not to alter it, but he repudiated the oath abjuring the solemn league and covenant, the enforced usage of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> and the surplice, and episcopal polity. A defender of Anglicanism responded in <span class="italic">Swearing and Lying</span> (1666), averring that Wild's professions of loyalty notwithstanding, he &#145;yield[ed] all things but obedience&#146;. When Calamy died the following year, Wild saluted him as a prophet and martyr in <span class="italic">On the Death of Mr Calamy</span> (1667). Wild again came under attack in <span class="italic">A Sovereign Remedy for the Presbyterian's Maladie</span> [1667], and in an exchange of verse with Nathaniel Wanley, vicar of Trinity Church, Coventry, published as <span class="italic">The Fair Quarrel</span> (1666; repr. 1668). Here, too, Wild defended nonconformists, in part by satirizing the <span class="roman">Five Mile Act</span>:<blockquote>
<div>Nor is there any Statute of our Nation<br>
</div>
<div>That sayes, <i>in five miles</i> of a <i>Corporation</i>
<br>
</div>
<div>If any <i>Outed-man</i> a Fart should vent,<br>
</div>
<div>That you should apprehend the <i>Innocent</i>.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>He apparently preached when he could, for in July 1669 he was indicted for holding a conventicle at Nuneaton, Warwickshire. Despite his differences with the government, he favourably contrasted Charles II with the popes in <span class="italic">Upon the Rebuilding the City</span> (1670).<br>
<br>When the king issued a declaration of indulgence in 1672, Wild expressed his gratitude but pointedly noted that dissenting clergy, unlike the &#145;<i>Jack-dawes</i>&#146; who held livings in the established church, were interested in preaching rather than material gain: &#145;<i>Peter</i> shall preach, <i>Judas</i> shall bear the purse.&#146; Published as <span class="italic">Dr Wild's Humble Thanks for his Majesties Gracious Declaration</span> (1672), it elicited hostile responses in <span class="italic">An Answer to the Author of Humble Thanks</span> (1672), <span class="italic">Dr. Wild's Squibs Return'd</span> (1672), and <span class="italic">Poor Robin's Parley with Dr. Wilde</span> (1672). In <span class="italic">A Letter from Dr. Wild to his Friend Mr. J. J.</span> (1672) he enthusiastically referred to the declaration as &#145;a second <span class="italic">Magna Charta</span>&#146; and expressed hope that parliament would approve it  (p. 6), not least because he thought it was economically beneficial. Anglican apologists promptly responded in <span class="italic">An Answer to Old Doctor Wild's New Poem</span> [1672?], <span class="italic">Moonshine, or, The Restauration of Jews-Trumps and Bagpipes</span> (1672), and <span class="italic">Flagellum poeticum</span> (1672), which chided Wild for having denigrated Anglicans. Other satirists were directing barbs at him, as in <span class="italic">A Wipe for Iter-boreale Wilde</span> (1670) and <span class="italic">The Wild Goose Chas'd</span> [1672?]. Taking advantage of the indulgence, he obtained a licence as a presbyterian in August 1672 to preach in his house at Oundle. Optimistic about England's prospects in the Third Anglo-Dutch War, he suffused <span class="italic">A Panegyrique Humbly Addrest to the Kings most Excellent Majesty</span> (1673) with patriotism:<blockquote>
<div>Heav'n, that hath plac'd this <i>Island</i>, to give Law,<br>
</div>
<div>To Ballance <i>Europe</i>, and for <i>States</i> to Aw.<br>
</div> (p. 2)</blockquote>Advancing years slowed Wild's pen. In <span class="italic">The Poring Doctor</span> (1674) he denounced a doctor of the church as a &#145;<i>doting Fool</i>&#146; who could neither pray nor preach, and who confused the names of Jesus and Judas. Responding to reports of the Popish Plot, he threw down the gauntlet to the papacy in <span class="italic">An Exclamation Against Popery</span> (1678):<blockquote>
<div>Plot on Proud <i>Rome</i>! And lay thy damn'd Design<br>
</div>
<div>As low as Hell, we'll find a Countermine.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>He also attacked Rome in <span class="italic">Dr. Wild's Poem: In nova fert animus</span> [1679], composed as the First Exclusion Parliament met. <span class="italic">Dr. R. W.'s Last Legacie</span> [1679] is usually regarded as his last poem, but <span class="italic">A Copy of the Last Verses Made by Dr. Wild</span> (1679) may also be his work. In it the author denounced &#145;Papists&#146; as traitors and repudiated the efforts of the court's supporters to draw parallels between 1679 and 1641.<br>
<br>Following his death in July 1679, apparently from apoplexy, Wild was buried at Oundle on the 30th. In the works that marked the occasion, <span class="italic">A Dialogue between Death and Doctor Robert Wyld</span> (1679) observed that &#145;Great <i>Wyld</i> is slain!&#146; and <span class="italic">A Pillar Set upon the Grave of the Reverend Dr. Robert Wilde</span> [1679] praised him as a prophet and a poet, but noted that his verse was sometimes too light and his sermons &#145;too home, Phanatick-like&#146;. His will, dated 10 August 1678 and proved on 17 February 1680, provided bequests of &pound;1050, part of which was used to purchase six bibles each year for winners of a lottery in which six women and six men participated. He was survived by his wife, his sisters Elizabeth Acton, widow, and Esther Wild, and his sons, Robert, John, and James, a London linen draper. Robert (BA, Brasenose College, Oxford, 1665; MA, King's College, Cambridge, 1668) served as vicar of Chiddingly, Sussex (1661&#150;1672?), rector of Blyborough, Lincolnshire (1672&#150;1674?), and rector of Toppesfield, Essex (1674&#150;91). John (BA, St Catharine's College, Cambridge, 1667; MA, Pembroke College, Oxford, 1670) was vicar of Weekley, Northamptonshire (1678&#150;82), and chaplain to Lord Montagu of Boughton. According to Richard Winwood, an old friend of Wild's, the latter was pleased by John's position in Montagu's family.<br>
<br>One of the most popular satirists of the Restoration era, Wild was described by Eugenius in John Dryden's <span class="italic">Of Dramatick Poesie</span> (1668) as &#145;the very [George] <i>Withers</i> of the City: they have bought more Editions of his Works then would serve to lay under all their Pies at the Lord Mayor's <i>Christmass</i>&#146;  (p. 5). When Samuel Pepys read <span class="italic">Iter boreale</span> in August 1663, he &#145;like[d] it pretty well but not so as it was cried up&#146;  (Pepys, 4.285), and he spent part of Christmas day 1667 listening to a friend read Wild's poems. In 1679 John Oldham also associated Wild with Wither:<blockquote>
<div>Should Parts, and Nature fail, yet very spite<br>
</div>
<div>Would make the arrant'st <i>Wild</i>, or <i>Withers</i> write.<br>
</div> (Oldham, 3)</blockquote>Several of Wild's poems were included with those of John Wilmot, earl of Rochester, in <span class="italic">Rome Rhym'd to Death</span> (1683), and an incomplete edition of his <span class="italic">Poems</span>, edited by John Hunt, was published in 1870.<br>
