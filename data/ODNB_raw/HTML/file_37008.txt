<span class="headword">Woodgate,  Walter Bradford</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Wat Bradwood]</span>  (1840&#150;1920), <span class="occ">oarsman and writer</span>, was born at Belbroughton rectory, Worcestershire, on 20 September 1840, the eldest son of the Revd Henry Arthur Woodgate (1801&#150;1874), rector of Belbroughton and canon of Worcester, and his wife, Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bradford. His younger brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29922/', "Major-General Sir Edward Woodgate")</script>. He entered Radley College in 1850, matriculated at Brasenose College, Oxford, as a scholar in 1859, graduated in 1863, and was called to the bar (Inner Temple) in 1872.<br>
<br>For more than half a century Woodgate was the outstanding figure on the upper Thames. He rowed his first race in 1858 for Radley against Eton over the Henley course; he rowed his last race there in 1868. He was in the Oxford winning crew in the university boat races of 1862 and 1863, and won the university pairs three times and the sculls twice; at Henley he won the Grand Challenge Cup in 1865, the Stewards' Cup in 1862, the Diamond sculls in 1864, and the Goblets in 1861, 1862, 1863, 1866, and 1868. He also held the Wingfield sculls in 1862, 1864, and 1867. At Henley in 1868 Woodgate's Brasenose four in the Stewards' Cup jettisoned its cox immediately after the start and the crew was disqualified. Nevertheless, by 1874 his point had been accepted and all the fours events had become coxless. Fred Weatherly (1848&#150;1929), the cox, could not swim but survived to write &#145;Danny Boy&#146; and &#145;Roses of Picardy&#146; among other ballads.<br>
<br>Woodgate was not only a great oarsman, but his knowledge of the sport was unsurpassed and it covered almost a century of rowing: he entered the rowing world soon enough to meet the giants of its early days (he had known Thomas Stainforth, the Oxford stroke in the first university boat race in 1829), and he was present at Henley regatta in 1920. His textbook, <span class="italic">Oars and Sculls, and How to Use Them</span> (1875), remains a classic, as does his <span class="italic">Boating</span> (1888), with its wealth of historical detail.<br>
<br>The breadth and variety of Woodgate's interests are evident in his <span class="italic">Reminiscences of an Old Sportsman</span> (1909), in which he wrote not only about country life, steeplechasing, and school and college life (he was the founder of Vincent's Club at Oxford), but also about the parentage of James I, the Royal Geographical Society's conflicting motives in their search for Dr Livingstone, his own indirect share in Pasteur's researches, politics, and police morality (he never took the law too seriously). As a journalist he helped to launch <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span> and <span class="italic">Land and Water</span>, was associated with the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> in its early days, and contributed to <span class="italic">The Field</span> for half a century. He also wrote a few novels under the pseudonym of Wat Bradwood, and in 1893 published <span class="italic">A Modern Layman's Faith</span>.<br>
<br>Woodgate was a man of unflinching rectitude, of decided opinions, but also of great kindliness, and he was an excellent raconteur. As a young man he was strikingly handsome; in later years his fine, stern face and stalwart figure made him a typical John Bull, an effect accentuated by a low-crowned top hat. He died on 1 November 1920, in his sister's house, Brantwood, Highfield Lane, Southampton, of a heart condition brought on by bronchial trouble. He never married.<br>
