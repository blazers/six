<span class="headword">Burford,  Roesia <span class="st"> [Rose]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> 1329), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was one of the four daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52217/', "Thomas Romeyn (d. 1313)")</script>, a wealthy merchant and pepperer, mayor of London in 1309&#150;10; her mother, Juliana Hauteyn, came from an old city dynasty. At an unknown date Roesia married her father's business associate John Burford (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1322), a rich wool exporter and pepperer from Oxford, who from 1297 traded extensively in spices with the great wardrobe; he was alderman of Vintry ward in 1321&#150;2. Roesia is best known as the recipient of 50 marks in 1317, part payment of 100 marks owed to her by Queen Isabella for an embroidered cope, a royal gift to the pope. The transaction has led many to identify Roesia as a London embroiderer of some standing. However, given her family's affluence and their links with the great wardrobe, it is more probable that she organized and financed the venture on the queen's behalf.<br>
<br>The commission is tentatively linked with two of the magnificent embroidered copes created at this time (generically referred to as <i>opus anglicanum</i>): a lost cope of 1315&#150;35 only known through a seventeenth-century watercolour (now in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool), and more recently&#151;and more probable&#151;the cope presented to Pienza Cathedral in Tuscany by Pope Pius II in 1462 which is still preserved there. This latter cope is also dated to 1315&#150;35, and has scenes from the lives of the Virgin, St Margaret, and St Catherine in three concentric zones. Richly embroidered copes of this kind were extremely expensive but nothing is known about the workshops where they were manufactured. They must have been designed by gifted professional artists and, clearly, were worked by a small team of highly skilled embroiderers. They were valuable diplomatic gifts much sought after by successive popes.<br>
<br>Roesia and John Burford apparently had a son Thomas, born before 1313 when he is mentioned in a document of expenses incurred by the executors of Thomas Romeyn; he did not survive to adulthood. There were two daughters, Joanna and Katherine, and then a further son, James, was born about 1320. On Romeyn's death in 1313 Roesia and John Burford inherited property in Aldermary.<br>
<br>When John Burford died <i>c</i>.1322 Roesia appears to have continued his business, and in 1324 is recorded selling sugar to the great wardrobe. She took John Lammas apprentice at about this time, and at her death in 1329 the apprenticeship was transferred to her son James. In due course Lammas became a leading pepperer and in 1345 was one of those who founded what became the Grocers' Company.<br>
<br>Roesia died in 1329. Her will, dated 25 March 1329, was made at her manor of Charleton in Kent. It reveals that Roesia had built a chapel on the south side of St Thomas the Apostle, London, where she now established a chantry for herself, her husband, and others. She left property in the London parishes of St Thomas the Apostle, All Hallows, Bread Street, and St Benet Sherehog to her young son James who also inherited her manors at Stockwell, Erith, and Combe. He and his sister lived at Charleton, under the guardianship of John Pulteney, a rich draper and alderman, who was later mayor of London. James did not become a merchant like his father, but instead lived as a gentleman on his country estates, and by 1358 was knighted. His sister Joanna was married to Thomas Betoyne, another pepperer.<br>
