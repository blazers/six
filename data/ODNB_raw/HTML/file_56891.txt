<span class="headword">Cade, Sir  Stanford</span>  (1895&#150;1973), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, born on 22 March 1895 in Dvinsk, Russia, was one of five children and the youngest son of Samuel Kadinsky, a diamond merchant. Born Saloman Kadinsky, he changed his name to Stanford Cade by deed poll in 1924, having become naturalized British in 1920. Cade was sent to school in Brussels, Belgium, in 1903. He matriculated in 1913 and entered the University of Brussels as a medical student, in his eighteenth year. At the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 he joined the Belgian army as a private and served at the defence of Antwerp. Evacuated to the United Kingdom, Cade was unable to enlist in the British army because of his insufficient knowledge of English. However, he was given permission to take the first part of his conjoint medical examination in French. Having passed this successfully, he was admitted as a medical student to King's College, London, and then obtained an entrance scholarship to Westminster medical school for his clinical studies. He qualified MRCS, LRCP, in 1917, and also won the Bird prize and gold medal and the Chadwick prize.<br>
<br>After qualification Cade held a series of junior surgical appointments at Westminster Hospital, London, and obtained fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1923. He was deeply influenced by three surgeons on the Westminster staff: Walter Spencer, Arthur Evans, and Ernest Rock Carling. All three were particularly interested in the treatment of malignant disease, and this topic became fundamental in Cade's subsequent career. In 1924 Cade was appointed assistant surgeon and in 1937 full surgeon on the staff of Westminster Hospital, a position he held until 1960. In addition Cade served on the staffs of the Radium Institute and of Mount Vernon Hospital. Cade was one of the early pioneers of radiotherapy in Britain, obtaining the first supply of radium for his hospital from the Radium Institute in Paris. He published <span class="italic">Radium Treatment of Cancer</span> in 1929; his encyclopaedic <span class="italic">Malignant Disease and its Treatment by Radium</span> was published in four volumes between 1948 and 1952.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the Second World War, Cade joined the medical branch of the Royal Air Force as a squadron leader; he reached the rank of air vice-marshal in 1946. He made a great contribution both to surgical organization and to the surgical care of pilots. His services were recognized by his appointment as CB in 1944 and KBE in 1946. He continued as honorary civilian consultant to the air force after the war until 1965. Cade also held numerous appointments of distinction. At the Royal College of Surgeons he served on council from 1949 to 1965; he was vice-president from 1959 to 1961; and he gave many eponymous lectures there, including three Hunterian lectures, the Bradshaw lecture in 1960, and the Hunterian oration in 1963. He held high offices in the British Empire Cancer Campaign and received numerous honorary diplomas, including fellowships of the American (1955), Edinburgh (1957), and Irish (1960) colleges of surgeons. He became MRCP (1941) and FRCP (1960).<br>
<br>In 1920 Cade had married Margaret Hester (1887&#150;1951), daughter of William Agate, organist at Paisley Abbey, and a nurse at Westminster Hospital. Her death on 31 August 1951 of malignant malaria while in Africa was a profound tragedy. They had three daughters, one of whom, Irene, became a radiotherapist at St Mary's Hospital, Portsmouth.<br>
<br>Cade, who was small of stature, was an indefatigable worker, teacher, operative surgeon, diagnostician, and counsellor. He exuded energy, and after exhausting his surgical team he would frequently work in his office until two or three in the morning on his letters and publications. He was a brilliant lecturer and this was accentuated by his picturesque foreign accent, which he never lost. However, his command of English, both spoken and written, was superb. His excitable nature sometimes gave rise to outbursts which were misinterpreted as irascible, for he would not tolerate stupidity either in opinion or, more importantly, in action. To those who did their best for him, and to his patients, he proved a kind friend.<br>
<br>Cade's contributions to the treatment of cancer included his pioneer work on radium and radiotherapy, his concept of the team treatment of malignant disease, and his ground-breaking studies on adrenalectomy in the treatment of advanced cancer, the subject of his third Hunterian lecture, in 1954. His Wednesday tumour clinics at Westminster Hospital were crowded with patients from all over the country and indeed the world, and were attended by surgical visitors from many countries. His encyclopaedic knowledge of the management of cancer was matched by his skill at microscopic pathology.<br>
<br>After retirement Cade settled at Southsea, Hampshire, to be near his daughter Irene. He died at another of his residences, Wick Farm, Finchdean, Hampshire, of bronchopneumonia on 19 September 1973; he was cremated, and his ashes were scattered on the garden of remembrance, at Chichester crematorium.<br>
