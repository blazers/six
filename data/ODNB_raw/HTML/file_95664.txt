<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Melville,  William</span>  (1850&#150;1918), <span class="occ">police officer and intelligence officer</span>, was born in Sneem, co. Kerry, Ireland, on 25 April 1850, the eldest of three sons of James Melville, tenant farmer, and his wife, Catherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> O'Connor. After attending the local Christian Brothers' school until the age of fifteen he worked for his father, who was then a baker and publican in Sneem. He left Sneem in unexplained circumstances; going to collect the weekly stock delivery from the railway station in Killarney he boarded a train, probably bound for Dublin, and eventually reached London.<br>
<br>On 16 September 1872 Melville applied to join the Metropolitan Police, stating on his application that he was employed as a baker in Lambeth, south London. He was admitted into E division of the Metropolitan Police as PC 310 and stationed at Bow Street. He was dismissed on 22 November 1872 for insubordination, having taken part in the agitation for improved police pay and conditions, but was reinstated a week later. Promotion to detective sergeant in the CID came in June 1879. Earlier, on 20 February 1879, he married Catharine (Katy) Reilly, originally from co. Mayo.<br>
<br>In March 1883 Melville was appointed to the special Irish branch. This covert operation within the Metropolitan Police CID, commanded by Superintendent Adolphus Williamson, had been formed in response to the Irish-American dynamite bombing campaign in Britain. He immediately began surveillance work, observing a member of a Liverpool-based group of Fenian dynamiters outside the houses of parliament  (<span class="italic">Irish Times</span>, 26 May 1883). In April 1883 he followed a member of another Fenian group, led by Thomas Gallagher, who were plotting explosions in London, and gave evidence at their subsequent trial  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 14 June 1883).<br>
<br>To identify possible bombers the special Irish branch sent nine of its twelve officers abroad to work alongside seaport customs officials. In March 1884 Melville and his family moved to Le Havre in France. Intelligence that he gathered led to the arrests of Fenians planning to assassinate Queen Victoria in Westminster Abbey during the celebrations of her jubilee in June 1887. Promoted inspector, Melville was awarded &pound;25 for his part in thwarting the jubilee plot. In December 1888 he returned to London, where his wife died on 19 March 1889, leaving him with four young children&#151;two sons and two daughters, one of whom died in infancy. He was remarried, on 8 August 1891, to Amelia Foy (1851/2&#150;1918), widow of William Foy, a former colleague in the special Irish branch.<br>
<br>As the Irish-American bombing threat receded, the special branch (as it had become) was turning its attention to counter-subversion activity against anarchists from the European mainland who had obtained asylum in Britain. In late 1891 Melville uncovered the so-called Walsall plot to manufacture a bomb for use against the tsarist regime in London; he personally arrested the Walsall socialist Joseph Deakin, at Euston Station in January 1892. Melville gave evidence  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 2 April 1892) at the trial of six men allegedly connected with the Walsall conspiracy who were convicted and imprisoned. The publisher and the editor (David Nicoll) of <span class="italic">The Commonweal</span> were subsequently imprisoned for an article that questioned whether Melville was &#145;fit to live&#146; and alleged that the Walsall affair had been a police plot. Detective Sergeant Patrick McIntyre later asserted in articles published in <span class="italic">Reynolds's Newspaper</span>, in April 1895, that the plot had been initiated by Melville's agent Auguste Coulon. Though McIntyre's allegations were coloured by a grievance against Melville, they were corroborated when official papers were released a century later, revealing that Coulon had been in Melville's pay since July 1890.<br>
<br>Melville took over as the head of special branch on 20 March 1893 on the retirement of Williamson's successor, Chief Inspector John Littlechild. Over the remainder of his career within special branch Melville was involved in many well publicized operations against militant foreign anarchists in London. In February 1894 he was present in the aftermath of the explosion in Greenwich Park that killed the French anarchist Martial Bourdin, after which he led a raid by armed police on the anarchist Autonomie Club in Windmill Street. In April 1894, after a violent struggle at Victoria Station, he arrested Th&eacute;odule Meunier, who was extradited to France and imprisoned for his part in bombings in Paris. In the same month, in Farringdon Road, he arrested Francis Polti, an Italian anarchist, carrying a bomb casing wrapped in brown paper, which was apparently intended to be used to blow up the stock exchange. In December 1897, after correspondence with the Russian secret police, he arrested the Russian revolutionary Vladimir Burtsev as he was leaving the British Museum reading room, on a warrant for publishing an incitement to assassinate Tsar Nicholas II.<br>
<br>Melville was increasingly involved in protecting visiting foreign rulers to Britain from terrorist threats. In July 1889 he had protected the shah of Persia during a state visit to Britain. In 1901 he worked with Gustav Steinhauer of the German secret service to thwart a plot against the Kaiser during the funeral of Queen Victoria. He received gifts and awards from many of the crowned heads of state who were beneficiaries of his protection while they were in Britain. After his retirement, in November 1903, he was appointed MVO. The mayor of Westminster started a national testimonial to Melville in recognition of his successful operations, often at the risk of his own life, against militant foreign anarchists based in London  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 1 Jan 1904). Subscribers included the German ambassador and Arthur Conan Doyle, and a cheque for &pound;2000 was presented to him in May 1904.<br>
<br>The public announcement (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 10 Nov 1903) that Melville was retiring from the Metropolitan Police concealed his employment, from 1 December 1903, in counter-espionage investigations for the newly created intelligence departments of the War Office directorate of military operations. Sir Edward Henry, commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, confirmed Melville's qualification for the post, which paid &pound;400 in addition to his police pension of &pound;280: &#145;He is shrewd and resourceful and altho' he has a tendency towards adventuring he can keep this in check when it suits his interests to do so&#146;  (Cook, 147). Working from an office in Victoria Street, London, as &#145;W. Morgan, General Agent&#146;, he monitored tsarist agents in Britain during the Russo-Japanese War, but mainly followed up reports around the country of German agents undertaking reconnaissance, particularly of British coastal defences. In a letter to the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> (28 Feb 1906), however, he informed its readers &#145;I am still in London, quietly enjoying &hellip; my well earned retirement&#146;.<br>
<br>When the Secret Service Bureau was set up in 1909, in response to concerns about the extent of German espionage, Melville continued as chief detective under the military head of the new bureau, Vernon Kell. He was referred to by his initial, M. In 1912 he travelled to Ostend to follow a Royal Naval gunner, George Parrott, who was supplying gunnery secrets to a German agent; he was a prosecution witness during Parrott's trial proceedings, when he was described &#145;as a retired superintendent of the Metropolitan police&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 21 Nov 1912, 15 Jan 1913). His work contributed to the bureau's successful operation on the outbreak of war to round up all the effective agents of the German naval espionage network in Britain.<br>
<br>Melville's health deteriorated during the war as a result of a kidney complaint, and, after an operation, he retired from MI5 (as the bureau had been redesignated) on 31 December 1917. During his residence in Britain he had lived mainly in south London, latterly at Lydon Road, Clapham, and finally at Kenmare, 24 Orlando Road, Clapham. He died in the Bolingbroke Hospital, Wandsworth, Surrey, on 1 February 1918, from kidney failure. After a requiem mass at St Mary's, Clapham Park Road, Clapham, he was buried on 5 February at St Mary's Roman Catholic cemetery, Kensal Green.<br>
<br>Melville was remembered as &#145;a silent, reserved man, never given to talking wildly&#146;  (Andrew, 6). In appearance he was heavily built and physically tough. A supporter of Irish home rule, an enthusiast for Gaelic sports, and a member of the National Liberal Club, he was one of several Irish Catholics in the newly created special branch of the Metropolitan Police, one of whom, Patrick Quinn, succeeded him as head of the branch. His career coincided with a considerable change in British policing. When he joined there was no permanent police agency to deal with political crime; Melville's actions against anarchists helped to justify the continuation of the force. Methods were also transformed; the aversion within the British police hierarchy against underhand methods, such as the use of regularly paid informers, also diminished, and Melville made considerable use of them.<br>
<br>His second son, <a name="cosubject_101260"></a><span class="headword">Sir James Benjamin Melville</span>  (1885&#150;1931), <span class="occ">barrister and politician</span>, was born at Le Havre on 20 April 1885, and after education at Westminster City School worked for the Eagle Insurance Company. He then studied law, and was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1906, and in May 1911 appeared as defence counsel for two of the group of east European revolutionaries whose activities culminated in the Sidney Street siege. Politically a Liberal, he was involved with the Fabian Society, as was his wife, Sarah Tugander (1885&#150;1974), whom he married on 1 July 1915. She was born in Russian-occupied Poland into a Jewish family who settled in the Mile End area of east London, and worked as a typist, becoming private secretary to the Conservative politician Andrew Bonar Law.<br>
<br>James Melville was commissioned in the Army Service Corps during the First World War, and served in Gallipoli and later in the Salonika campaign, where he was badly wounded. He reached the rank of major. In 1918 he joined the Labour Party, and organized the local party in Kensington. Successful in legal practice, he was appointed KC in 1927, and was defence counsel for the bookseller in the trial, in 1928, arising from the publication of the <span class="italic">Well of Loneliness</span>. Adopted as Labour parliamentary candidate in Lancaster (1922) and Walsall (1926), he was selected in 1928 as the party's candidate for Gateshead, amid resentment from some trade unionists within the party that a safe seat was allocated to a former Liberal and lawyer. After winning the seat with a large majority in the general election of 1929 he was made solicitor-general in Ramsay MacDonald's Labour government, and was involved in drafting abortive legislation to reverse the <span class="roman">Trade Disputes Act</span>, introduced by the Conservatives following the general strike. He was knighted in the same year. His health, never robust as a result of his wartime injuries, broke down, and he resigned the office in October 1930; he died in London on 1 May 1931. He was buried at St Mary's Roman Catholic cemetery, Kensal Green, after a requiem mass in Westminster Cathedral. He was survived by his wife and their daughter. He shared his father's strong Roman Catholic and Irish identities, was active in the Gaelic League, the Irish Literary Society, and the Catenian Society of Catholic laymen, and addressed the commemoration of Roman Catholic emancipation in the Albert Hall in September 1929 as the first Catholic solicitor-general since the Reformation  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 14 Sept 1929).<br>
