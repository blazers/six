<span class="headword">Pennecuik,  Alexander</span>  (1652&#150;1722), <span class="occ">physician and poet</span>, was the elder son of Alexander Pennecuik (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1693), an army surgeon under General Bannier in the Thirty Years' War and later surgeon-general to the auxiliary Scots army in England, and his wife, Margaret Murray, a descendant of the family of the Murrays of Philiphaugh. The elder Pennecuik, who claimed descent from the Pennecuiks of that ilk, bought in 1646 the estate of Newhall on the north Esk; by his wife's inheritance, he also acquired the estate of Romanno, within a few miles of his own and on the far side of West Linton in Tweeddale. The precise date of his death is not known, but his son's poem, &#145;Upon the Death of Alexander Pennecuik of New-Hall&#146;, which describes him as &#145;a gentleman by birth, and more by merit&#146;, testifies that he had lived to the age of ninety. He is said to have been buried in the churchyard of Newlands.<br>
<br>The elder son, Alexander Pennecuik, appears to have inherited both his father's estates and his commitment to the medical profession. Passages in his poems imply that, as a young man, he had travelled overseas, a normal practice for young Scotsmen of his time, but little is known of his professional education, beyond the fact that an Alexander Pennecuik graduated with the degree of MA from Edinburgh University on 18 July 1664. His life was peaceful and uneventful. According to A. D. Murray  (<span class="italic">Transactions of the Hawick Archaeological Society</span>, August 1863), he practised &#145;in Edinburgh through the greater part of his life&#146;; but it seems more likely that, though he may have begun there, his life from the age of thirty-three was spent in his native Peeblesshire, caring for his father in his declining years and pursuing his profession as a country doctor, in the course of which he became familiar with every corner of Tweeddale.<br>
<br>Pennecuik's devotion to the country and to country pursuits is revealed in his &#145;Answer to his brother J. P.'s many letters, dissuading him from staying longer in the country, and inviting him to come and settle his residence in Edinburgh&#146;; the poem is addressed to his younger brother James, a member of the Faculty of Advocates, who had endeavoured to persuade him to move to Edinburgh. In it he maintains that he will not expose his old father to the dangers and unhealthiness of the city, &#145;to stifle him with smoke, though he be old&#146;, and describes lyrically the pleasures and comforts of the country life.<br>
<br>It was Pennecuik's devotion to his own neighbourhood and his close familiarity with the topography and botany of the area (he corresponded with James Sutherland, superintendent of the first botanic garden in Edinburgh) that caused Sir Robert Sibbald, who was preparing an account of the counties of Scotland, to invite Pennecuik to prepare a description of Tweeddale. He produced this with the assistance of the advocate John Forbes (who, by an ironic twist of fate, was later to inherit Pennecuik's Newhall estate), but it was not published until 1715, when it appeared in a small quarto volume under the title, <span class="italic">A geographical, historical description of the shire of Tweeddale, with a miscelany and curious collection of select Scotish poems</span>, dedicated to William Douglas, earl of March (and lacking the promised map of Tweeddale, a circumstance attributed to &#145;Mr Adair's gout&#146;).<br>
<br>This volume contained the first published texts of Pennecuik's poems, introduced to the earl in the following words:<blockquote>To the following Treatise, My Lord, I have subjoined a few Pleasant and Select Poems, at the importunity of several Ingenious Gentlemen, my Friends; which were never before Published, or at least with my Consent and Knowledge; and if any of them has been Printed, it's owing to Surreptitious and False Coppies.</blockquote>There is evidence that some of his poems did indeed circulate in broadside form earlier than this, and one of them, &#145;Lintoun address to his highness the prince of Orange&#146; (1689), was included by James Watson in his <span class="italic">Choice Collection of Comic and Serious Scots Poems</span> (1706).<br>
<br>Pennecuik's total poetical output, which was small and undistinguished, was noticed briefly by Campbell in his <span class="italic">Introduction to the History of Poetry in Scotland</span> (1798): &#145;But of his poetry I am unwilling to say much to its dispraise, as I can in no wise qualify such with any commendation; therefore, I pass on, to notice another&#146;. This judgement is corroborated more simply and briefly by an anonymous manuscript note on the flyleaf of a copy of the 1715 edition, &#145;Dr Pennecuik of Newhall, Romanno. A good sort of man tho' a very bad poet.&#146;<br>
<br>It is not known whom Pennecuik married, but he had two daughters, the elder of whom married Mr Oliphant of Lanton, Edinburghshire, in 1702. The estate of Newhall was given to her on her marriage, but her husband, who was financially embarrassed, sold it in 1703 to Sir David Forbes, father of the John Forbes with whom Pennecuik collaborated over his description of Tweeddale, and who was the patron of Allan Ramsay. It was believed by John Pinkerton and later editors that Newhall inspired the setting for Ramsay's <span class="italic">The Gentle Shepherd</span>, but this theory has been discredited by the editors of the Scottish Text Society edition of Ramsay's <span class="italic">Works</span>. The estate of Romanno, where Pennecuik lived until his death, was bequeathed to his younger daughter, who had married Mr Farquharson of Kirktown of Boyne, Aberdeenshire. Pennecuik died there in 1722 and was buried beside his father in Newlands churchyard.<br>
<br>Dr Pennecuik is often confused with another minor poet, <a name="cosubject_21862"></a><span class="headword">Alexander Pennecuik</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1730), often known as Mercator, assumed to be a relative, possibly a nephew. All that is known of him indicates that, though a man of education and some wit, his career was dissipated and impoverished. James Wilson (Claudero), in his &#145;Farewell to the Muses and Auld Reekie&#146;  (J. Wilson, <span class="italic">Miscellanies in Prose and Verse, on Several Occasions by Claudero</span>, 1766), promises<blockquote>
<div>To shun the fate of Pennycuik,<br>
</div>
<div>Who starving died in turnpike-neuk;<br>
</div>
<div>(Tho' sweet he sung with wit and sense,<br>
</div>
<div>He like poor Claud, was short of pence).<br>
</div>
</blockquote>He appears to have been involved in some way in the murder by Nicol Muschet, laird of Boghall, of Muschet's wife in 1721; Muschet's &#145;Last speech and confession&#146; accuses a certain Alexander Pennycuik &#145;at present in the Abbey&#146; (the abbey of Holyrood was the refuge of debtors) of having had a part in his criminal designs, a charge which Pennecuik refuted in <span class="italic">A Gentleman's Letter to the Laird of Boghall, the Day before his Execution</span> (1721).<br>
<br>Pennecuik contributed verses (signed by &#145;Al. P., Mercator Edinburgensis&#146;) &#145;To my honoured friend, Dr. P&#151;k&#146; which were prefixed to Dr Pennecuik's <span class="italic">Description of Tweeddale</span> (1715); these were reprinted in his <span class="italic">Streams from Helicon, or, Poems on various subjects, in three parts, by Alexander Pennecuik, gent.</span> (1720). The other publication by which he is best remembered is his prose <span class="italic">Historical Account of the Blue Blanket, or, Crafts-Mens Banner</span> by &#145;Alex. Pennecuik, burgess and guild-brother of Edinburgh&#146; (1722). It is not known of which guild he was a brother.<br>
<br>Pennecuik's writing, though generally scurrilous, is more accomplished than that of his elder namesake and it frequently mimics the themes of his contemporary Allan Ramsay. All copies of his <span class="italic">Flowers from Parnassus</span>, which he apparently published in 1726, have disappeared. Numerous anonymous works are attributed to him, the most convincing attributions being <span class="italic">Groans from the grave, or, Complaints of the dead against the surgeons for raising their bodies out of the dust</span> (1725, see manuscript note on Maidment's copy in British Library). He died in 1730 and was buried in Greyfriars churchyard, Edinburgh, on 28 November. Collections of his poems published after his death include <span class="italic">A Collection of Poet Pennicuicke's Satires on Kirkmen</span> (1744); <span class="italic">A compleat collection of all the poems wrote by that famous and learned poet, Alexander Pennecuik</span>; and <span class="italic">A collection of Scots poems on several occasions, by the late Mr Alexander Pennecuik, gent., and others</span> (1787).<br>
