<span class="headword">Wise,  George</span>  (1855&#150;1917), <span class="occ">religious controversialist</span>, was born on 4 November 1855 at 25 Bermondsey New Road, London, the fourth son of William Wise (<i>d</i>. 1871), an illiterate tanner, and Sophia Wise (<i>d</i>. 1891), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Slade, niece of John Pounds (1766&#150;1839), accredited founder of the ragged school movement. After a brief formal education, either in Bermondsey or Portsmouth, Wise began work in a London office. He was baptized in 1873, joining the congregation of the Baptist Metropolitan Tabernacle, but five years later reading J. C. Ryle's tract <span class="italic">What do we Owe to the Reformation?</span> (1877) led him to seek confirmation in the Church of England. A brief flirtation with scepticism followed, but attendance at Christian Evidence Society lectures not only resolved his doubts but also encouraged him to undertake further study. Although Wise's later reputation among his supporters for profound scholarship was misplaced, he was justly described as an &#145;omnivorous reader&#146; and &#145;a dual personality, who had in him both the schoolmaster and the agitator&#146;  (<span class="italic">Liverpool Daily Post and Mercury</span>, 3 Dec 1917, 6).<br>
<br>About 1882 Wise became a lecturer for the Christian Evidence Society, working as a full-time staff member from 1886. It was in that capacity that he moved to Liverpool in 1888, so beginning a connection with the city which continued until his death. For three years Wise worked in Liverpool under the auspices of the Christian Evidence Society and the YMCA, concentrating on Christian apologetics in debate with secularists. He was a very effective platform speaker, and his work received the commendation of religious leaders in the city: Bishop Ryle presented Wise with a complete set of his tracts in 1891 as a form of testimonial.<br>
<br>When Wise's official work for the Christian Evidence Society came to an end he stayed in Liverpool, and began to add polemical protestantism to his anti-secularist message. In the context of Liverpool's endemic sectarian tensions, Wise found many opportunities for aggressive protestantism. A further dimension was added, moreover, by the controversies surrounding ritualism in the Church of England, latent throughout this period, but breaking out with renewed virulence in 1897. A year later Wise founded his own organization, the British Protestant Union, to co-ordinate the campaign against &#145;a trinity of evils&#151;Romanism, ritualism, and infidelity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Liverpool Courier</span>, 6).<br>
<br>In the early years of the twentieth century George Wise played a major role in the turbulent politics of Liverpool, for the religious and ethnic geography of the city gave considerable influence to such a prominent protestant figure. In November 1900 Wise stood for election to the Liverpool school board and he topped the poll, achieving a vote of 107,063, double that of any other candidate. Three years later he won a decisive electoral victory in the Kirkdale ward and became a city councillor. Wise was a popular and hard-working councillor, although disqualified from re-election in 1906 by his new status as a nonconformist minister.<br>
<br>The activities which made Wise a significant element in the calculations of Liverpool politicians also brought him into conflict with the police authorities. Disowned by the YMCA in 1898, Wise acquired a hall in Potter Street which became a base for his protestant work. Public demonstrations outside ritualist churches, inflammatory speeches, and marches and mass meetings in Roman Catholic areas of the city, including burlesques of Catholic rites, fanned the flames of sectarian violence. On several occasions Wise was ordered by the Liverpool stipendiary magistrate to cease holding open-air meetings. In 1903 he opted instead to serve two months in Walton gaol, being met on release by 60,000 supporters. Another brief spell in prison followed a further outbreak of rioting in 1909, provoking a parliamentary inquiry into the disorders.<br>
<br>The satirical weekly <span class="italic">The Porcupine</span> described Wise, a lifelong bachelor, on a court appearance in 1902:<blockquote>He is a sturdily-built, bespectacled man under the medium height, looks about fifty years of age, wears side whiskers with moustache turning slightly grey. While there is the light of intelligence in his eyes, there is nothing to bespeak the religious fanatic. When seen in the streets he is generally attired in frock coat, white tie, and soft slouch hat, the headgear being replaced by the orthodox &#145;stove-pipe&#146; on Sundays. (<span class="italic">The Porcupine</span>, 1)</blockquote>In 1903 Wise's supporters bought the Welsh Methodist chapel on Netherfield Road, which became the Protestant Reformers' Memorial Church. Already a powerful preacher, Wise also proved to be a conscientious pastor, and his church grew from small beginnings to claim the largest congregation in the city, with a full programme of ancillary activities.<br>
<br>Contemporaries ascribed the breakdown in Wise's health in 1917 to concern for those of his congregation injured or missing in action in the First World War. Protracted illness ended with his death from myocarditis and dropsy on 29 November 1917 at his home, 3 Swanston Avenue, Walton. Vast crowds attended the funeral service at the Protestant Reformers' Church, which was followed by interment on 4 December in Anfield cemetery.<br>
