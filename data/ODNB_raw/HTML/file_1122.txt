<span class="headword">Baker, Sir  Henry Williams</span>, third baronet  (1821&#150;1877), <span class="occ">hymn writer</span>, was born in London on 27 May 1821, the eldest of the two sons and five daughters of Vice-Admiral Sir Henry Loraine Baker, second baronet (1787&#150;1859), and his wife, Louisa Anne (<i>d</i>. 1861), only daughter of William Williams of Castle Hall, Dorset, sometime MP for Weymouth. His grandfather was Sir Robert Baker of Dunstable House, Surrey, and of Nicholashayne, Culmstock, Devon, on whom a baronetcy was conferred in 1796; his father served with distinction in a naval career of more than fifty years.<br>
<br>After completing his university education at Trinity College, Cambridge, Baker took his BA degree in 1844, was ordained in 1846, and proceeded MA in 1847. In 1851 he was presented to the vicarage of Monkland near Leominster. On the death of his father, on 2 November 1859, he succeeded him as third baronet. While at Monkland, Sir Henry wrote two devotional books&#151;<span class="italic">Daily Prayers for the Use of Those who have to Work Hard</span> and <span class="italic">A Daily Textbook</span> (1854), for a similar readership&#151;and, more importantly, began his hymn-writing career. His greatest accomplishment was the extraordinarily successful <span class="italic">Hymns Ancient and Modern</span>, first published in 1860. One of its instigators, he became chair of the proprietors, and it was to his zeal and business sense that the project owed its success. The original edition was strongly influenced by Tractarianism, and intermittently suspected of &#145;popery&#146;, but an appendix in 1868 and a complete revision in 1875 made it a widely acceptable, and even best-selling, hymnal.<br>
<br>It was Sir Henry's initiative which recruited contributors from different church parties, won over potential competitors, and exploited every opportunity to promote the cause of church music in general, and the sales of <span class="italic">Ancient and Modern</span> in particular. For the 1861 music edition, in which a tune was printed for every text, he put up a considerable share of the capital and recruited W. H. Monk as editor. Many ineradicable associations of hymn and tune can be traced to this and subsequent editions. Sir Henry was also largely responsible for an important change in hymn publishing: he insisted that the proprietors claim copyright and exercise it to protect and promote their work.<br>
<br>Sometimes an irascible and even high-handed man of business, Sir Henry was also a writer of devotional hymns, unflowery translations, and sensitive paraphrases and adaptations. When he died <span class="italic">Hymns Ancient and Modern</span> contained more than thirty of his own texts and two melodies, as well as traces of his editing throughout. His chief enduring hymns include &#145;O praise ye the Lord!&#146;, &#145;We love the place&#146; (with William Bullock), &#145;Praise, O praise our God and king&#146; (drawing upon Milton), &#145;O God of love, O king of peace&#146;, and &#145;The king of love my shepherd is&#146;. He died unmarried on 12 February 1877, at the vicarage of Monkland, Horkesley House, and was buried in the parish churchyard. Stained-glass windows were put up to his memory in his own church and in All Saints', Notting Hill.<br>
