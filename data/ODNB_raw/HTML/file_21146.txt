<span class="headword">Pakington, Sir  John</span>, second baronet  (1621&#150;1680), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 13 August 1621 and was baptized the next day at Hampton Lovett, Worcestershire. He was the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21144/', "Sir John Pakington, first baronet (1600&#150;1624)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21145/', "Pakington, Sir John (1549&#150;1625)")</script>], and Frances, daughter of Sir John Ferrers of Tamworth, Staffordshire. He succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his father in October 1624, and to Westwood Park, Worcestershire, on the death of his grandfather, also <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21145/', "Sir John Pakington (1549&#150;1625)")</script>, in January 1625. He was the ward of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6483/', "Thomas Coventry")</script>, the lord keeper. He would later (<i>c</i>.1648) marry Coventry's daughter, Dorothy [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21142/', "Pakington, Dorothy, Lady Pakington (bap. 1623, d. 1679)")</script>]. He took the oath of allegiance in May 1638, when he was granted permission to travel abroad for three years with the proviso that he should not visit Rome. Returned to parliament in March 1640 for Worcestershire and for the borough of Aylesbury, where he had property, he chose to sit for the county. In the Long Parliament he sat for Aylesbury. In November 1640 he participated in an attack in the House of Commons on Sir Francis Windebank, secretary of state, for remarks he was alleged to have made regarding those who had refused to pay ship money. Although he apparently acquiesced in the attainder of Strafford, by 1642 Pakington's sympathies lay with the court, and he received the king's commission of array for Worcestershire. He was then, in August 1642, disabled from sitting in parliament.<br>
<br>With the other commissioners of array for Worcestershire, in August 1642 he raised a cavalry force to serve in the county. He fought at the battle of Edge Hill and was a member of the royalist committee of safety during the first civil war. In June 1643 he was admitted a freeman of Worcester on condition that he took no advantage from the privilege, and was serving as a justice of the peace for Worcestershire by 1644.<br>
<br>In March 1646 he obtained a pass to travel to London, where he presented himself to the speaker of the Commons with the intention of compounding for his support of the royalist cause. He was imprisoned, and was held for two months. His own figure for the annual value of his estates was &pound;1520, but the sequestrators assessed them as worth &pound;1947 per annum. Pakington put his losses during the civil war at &pound;12,000 in rents sequestered and damage to his woods and houses. He was fined &pound;7670, a third of the value of his estates, with &pound;3000 accepted as first payment. This was paid and in May 1649 he was restored to his estates, with the balance paid in May 1650. But his tenants at Aylesbury refused him possession, petitioning for restoration of their common rights at Heydon Hill, which they claimed had been unjustly taken away, and he was compelled to grant his property there to the inhabitants of the town.<br>
<br>Pakington was arrested as the Scottish army under Charles II approached Worcester in August 1651, but was released when they entered the city. He attended the muster of the army on 26 August and was taken prisoner at the battle of Worcester on 3 September. He was tried in 1653 for appearing at the muster, but was acquitted. Nevertheless he was again fined, paying &pound;1000, and undertook to pay &pound;1000 more. In December 1654 he was one of the recipients of crates, said to contain bottles of wine, sent by the royalist agent Henry Norwood to Sir Henry Littleton. These aroused suspicion and in the following January he was arrested and charged with receiving arms in those crates. He was released in September 1655, but was again taken into custody in 1659, suspected of being involved in Sir George Booth's rising. During the 1650s his Westwood Park residence provided a congenial centre for Anglican and royalist sympathizers, and was the home of Henry Hammond, canon of Christ Church and archdeacon of Chichester, who died there in 1660.<br>
<br>Following the Restoration Pakington was again appointed justice of the peace for Worcestershire, in June 1660, and served as deputy lieutenant for the county. He was returned to parliament unopposed in 1661 as member for Worcestershire. In 1661 a bill was introduced to cancel the conveyance of his property at Aylesbury, but it failed to make progress and was not reintroduced until 1664, when it passed.<br>
<br>In November 1661 two letters dropped in a country lane in Worcestershire were taken to Pakington. Alarmed that they implied the existence of a plot for a &#145;suddaine riseing of the Presbiterian and factious party&#146;  (Greaves, 72), he forwarded them to Sir Edward Nicholas, secretary of state, and informed the lord lieutenant. A number of people were taken into custody, including the entrepreneur Andrew Yarrenton, and Ambrose Sparry, rector of Martley, the addressees of the letters. Richard Baxter was among the ministers implicated in what was referred to as the Pakington Plot or the Yarrenton Plot. He accused Pakington of intercepting a letter from him to his mother-in-law and sending it to George Morley, bishop of Worcester and Pakington's close friend. Impressed by Pakington's testimony, which was supported by that of other members, the Commons requested the king to issue a proclamation ordering all &#145;suspicious and loose persons&#146; to leave London  (Greaves, 76). The proclamation duly appeared and required all cashiered soldiers of the Commonwealth regime to leave the capital by 4 December and not return before 14 June 1662. Writing in 1681, in the context of the exclusion crisis, Yarrenton accused Pakington of having written the letters, and although this was not refuted, it seems possible that they were by another hand, perhaps that of a neighbour of Sparry's who had been rebuked by him for adultery.<br>
<br>Dorothy, Lady Pakington, died on 10 May 1679; Sir John Pakington was buried at Hampton Lovett on 3 January 1680. Their only son, <a name="cosubject_21147"></a><span class="headword">Sir John Pakington</span>, third baronet  (<em>c.</em>1649&#150;1688), matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 3 May 1662. In May 1665 he was granted a licence to travel for three years with his tutor, and visited Italy, Switzerland, Germany, and the Low Countries. He became a notable <span class="occ">Anglo-Saxon scholar</span>, tutored by George Hickes, appointed dean of Worcester in 1683. In 1668 Pakington married Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1690), daughter of Sir John Keyt of Ebrington, Gloucestershire. Pakington was made a freeman of the borough of Droitwich in 1683 and an alderman of Bewdley in 1685. He was returned as member for Worcestershire in 1685 as a tory. He was buried at Hampton Lovett on 28 March 1688. His son, also <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21148/', "Sir John Pakington (1671&#150;1727)")</script>, was a prominent tory politician.<br>
