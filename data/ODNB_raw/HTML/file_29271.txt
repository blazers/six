<span class="headword">White,  Stephen</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1574, <em>d.</em> in or after 1646), <span class="occ">scholar and theologian</span>, was born in Clonmel, Ireland. Although the details of his parentage are unknown it appears that he belonged to the mercantile &eacute;lite which also produced the Jesuit Thomas White, rector of the Irish College at Salamanca, and Peter White, sometime dean of Waterford, who was famed for his grammar school teaching at Kilkenny. Stephen White may have been a pupil at this academy and it was possibly he who was one of the three foundation scholars named in the charter of the newly established Trinity College, Dublin, in 1592. If so he quickly left for the continent, studying first at Lisbon about 1594 and then at Salamanca the following year. There, having attained the degree of BA, he joined the Society of Jesus in 1596. He graduated to teaching philosophy and theology at the college. While on the staff he helped William Bathe, spiritual director of the college, in the compilation of the famous <span class="italic">Janua linguarum</span>, a highly successful manual of linguistics, first published in 1611.<br>
<br>In 1606 White moved to Germany to become professor of scholastic theology, first at Ingolstadt (until 1609) and then at Dillingen, where he taught for fourteen years. As a doctor of divinity he lectured a generation of students, including many Irishmen, and supervised a number of doctoral dissertations. His reputation as a theologian burgeoned within the society, and among scholars in Ireland and on the continent.<br>
<br>The other strand in commentators' admiring assessments emanated from White's achievement as an antiquary and ecclesiastical historian which was to earn him the sobriquet polyhistor. According to his own account he began about 1611 serious study of the history of Ireland, and within a few years produced &#145;Apologia pro Hibernia adversus Cambri calumnias&#146;. In this work (which remained in manuscript until edited and published in 1849) White aimed to refute the views of the twelfth-century historian Gerald of Wales (Giraldus Cambrensis) in his works <span class="italic">Expugnatio Hibernica</span> and <span class="italic">Topographia Hiberniae</span>. He displayed therein an impressive knowledge of medieval and contemporary sources for Irish history, especially those which pertained to the Irish church and its saints.<br>
<br>Evident in the &#145;Apologia&#146; are signs of the painstaking work of transcription of saints' lives which forms White's main literary monument. Having access to the libraries of many German and Swiss monasteries he made copies of several important manuscripts. Among these were Adamnan's life of St Columba which he made available to the hagiographer John Colgan and Archbishop James Ussher, the Church of Ireland primate. Also transcribed were lives of St Brigid, St Colman, St Patrick, St Erhard, and St Columbanus, copies of which White sent to a number of scholars who were engaged in publishing works on early Irish ecclesiastical history. Although none of his own scholarly research was published his selfless work of furnishing vital sources for other writers was fulsomely acknowledged by them. Ussher paid tribute to White's erudition on a number of occasions, and Colgan praised him handsomely in the preface to his <span class="italic">Acta sanctorum Hiberniae</span>.<br>
<br>When in his mid-fifties White was sent back to Ireland, about 1629, to take up an academic post in the short-lived Jesuit university in Back Lane, Dublin. After the closure of that institution by the authorities in 1630 White spent some years in Jesuit residences in Dublin and Waterford. During his stay in the former he visited Ussher, who gave him access to his library, and he corresponded with Colgan. He devoted himself to teaching and adjudicating on cases of conscience. By late 1641 he had moved to Galway. The proposed publication of the ailing scholar's work was considered by his superiors in the Society of Jesus but they were cautious about approving the printing of such ideologically engaged work in the highly charged politico-religious climate of the 1640s.<br>
<br>Stephen White died in or after January 1646, and the bulk of his scholarship was lost.<br>
