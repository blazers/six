<span class="headword">Servat,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1318/19), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was a native of Cahors in southern France; he was the last, and perhaps the wealthiest, of the prominent merchants from that city to engage in English trade and finance. He chose London as the base from which to operate a business extending from Montpellier to Bergen and with some connection to Paris. He was probably one of a group of &#145;men of Bordeaux&#146; at Southampton in 1272, and was occasionally described as a merchant of Gascony. From 1273 onwards he was often named as a merchant of London, of which he had become a citizen by 1281. To the Sienese he was &#145;a Proven&ccedil;al dwelling in London&#146;  (Bigwood, 1, no. 28).<br>
<br>The supply of Gascon wine to the north was one source of Servat's prosperity and, like other merchants from Cahors and its region, he also transmitted spices and silk obtained in Provence. In Britain the main axis of his trade was along the east coast, where he was a major exporter of wool to Flanders, above all through Boston, but also through Hull and London. With other Cahorsins he contracted to manage the wool crop of Pipewell Abbey, Northamptonshire, from 1288 onwards. Wool deals perhaps underlay his relations with leading clergymen and others, but he also provided purely financial services. His interests in shipping enabled him to organize an extensive distributive trade from London. In 1305, for example, he chartered a ship to take wine from London to Aberdeen, returning with coal from Newcastle to London or Southampton. North Sea trade drew him into diplomacy: he delivered the king's loan (supplied by his Riccardi bankers) to the king of Norway's agent at Yarmouth in 1286, and accompanied the bishop of Durham's missions to Norway in 1290 (when he provided the ship) and in 1294. He sold wine and sugar to Durham Priory. Perhaps associated with the coinage in 1281, he ran the bishop of Durham's mint in 1300&#150;02. In London he was a dealer in bonds, and supplied spices to a pepperer and silk to a tailor; a dyer and a Cheapside vintner were heavily in his debt.<br>
<br>Servat was already lending to the king by 1283, and helped finance the defence of Gascony after the fall of the Riccardi in 1294. By 1302 he had a lucrative contract to supply the royal wardrobe with spices, linen, cloth, and furs, and in that year, with partners from Montpellier and Provence, met almost a quarter of the wardrobe's demand for spices. In 1302&#150;3 Flemish pirates in the channel seized his twelve-year-old son and a cargo of spices destined for the wardrobe, both in the care of his servant returning from Provence, and then seized another of his cargoes that was bound for Scotland. In 1303/4 Servat supplied wax to the wardrobe and contracted to supply 300 tuns of wine. In 1309 he agreed to supply 300 quintals of wax annually for five years, for which in 1312 an equivalent value of cloth was substituted. In 1311&#150;12 he helped organize money and soldiers in London for the Scottish campaign, and in 1313 again supplied wine to the king. These debts were to be repaid out of the customs receipts at Marmande, in Gascony, and at several English provincial ports. At dates between 1305 and 1315 he had joint charge of the London customs and other royal interests in the city.<br>
<br>These years marked the peak of Servat's career. In or shortly before 1302 he moved from Cordwainer ward to take over the former headquarters of the Riccardi in Bucklersbury, the heart of London's financial district. In 1305 he obtained licence to crenellate the house and to build a stone tower above its gateway, a notable symbol of success. Alderman for Walbrook from 1308 until his death, he represented the city in parliament in 1309 and 1313. The scale of Servat's dealings with the crown, however, did not match that of the leading Italians with whom he sometimes did business. Eventually he was eclipsed by Edward II's ambitious Genoese banker, Antonio Pessagno, who early in 1313 was rumoured to have purchased his tower; the deal was in fact completed by 1315. In the summer of that year, which perhaps marked Servat's effective retirement from business, the king's outstanding debts to him amounted to &pound;2246. Almost half that sum had been contracted under Edward I, and in December 1318 a third of it was still due. William Servat died in London between 7 December 1318 and 18 January 1319.<br>
<br>Servat had conducted his business through a kaleidoscopic network of servants, attorneys, merchants retained on contract, and partners. Those who traded while lodging at his London houses may also have been commercial associates. His connections with some of these individuals lasted for three or four decades. He spent his last years back in Cordwainer ward, at a house in a neighbourhood favoured by pepperers and Gascon wine merchants. There his chaplain received his income from the customs, traded in spices on his behalf, and tried to defraud him. Neither his wife, identified as Alice or (Alison) in 1302 and for whom a diamond ring had been purchased in 1305, nor his son is recorded as having been still with him. Despite his civic office, Servat seems to have identified himself primarily as the London-based member of a loose group of Gascon and Proven&ccedil;al partners for which, as a citizen of London, he provided crucial services. Thus his fortune, if he left one, may have been repatriated to Gascony, where the Servat family (its relationship to William is not proven) was soon to be prominent in the Agenais. In London his one memorial was &#145;Servat's tower&#146;, still renowned 250 years after his death.<br>
