<span class="headword">Fanshawe, Sir  Henry</span>  (1569&#150;1616), <span class="occ">exchequer official</span>, was born in August 1569, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9150/', "Thomas Fanshawe (c.1533&#150;1601)")</script>, queen's remembrancer in the exchequer, and his first wife, Mary Bourchier (<i>c</i>.1550&#150;1578), daughter of Anthony Bourchier of Barnsley, Gloucestershire. After entering Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1581, and graduating BA in 1584 he became a member of the Inner Temple in 1587. He was related by marriage or friendship to most of the senior bureaucrats of the period, particularly to the Hattons, and it was a family friend who obtained him a seat at Westbury in the 1589 parliament when he was not quite twenty-one. In 1593 he sat again and served on one or two committees. He was being groomed for the high exchequer office which was his in reversion and in 1594 he obtained the reversion of the office of auditor for the north parts of the duchy of Lancaster. He held this office by 1596, which explains his election for Boroughbridge. At the same time he was actively assisting his father in the exchequer.<br>
<br>By this time Fanshawe had married his stepmother's younger sister, Elizabeth Smythe (1577?&#150;1631). His heir, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9151/', "Thomas Fanshawe, later Viscount Fanshawe")</script>, was born in 1596, the eldest of eleven children. His youngest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9149/', "Richard Fanshawe")</script>, was born in 1608. In 1601 Henry inherited the powerful and lucrative post of queen's remembrancer, the third of his name to hold that position, with the large house in Warwick Lane, London, which served as the remembrancer's office, and Ware Park, near Hertford, which was convenient when the exchequer moved to Hertford because of plague in London, and for its proximity to such places as Hatfield House and Theobalds. Here he was also a prominent local administrator. Fanshawe was frequently required to serve on special commissions and advise on financial matters. His advice, always profoundly conservative, was influential in determining exchequer procedure and proposing improvements in revenue raising. He saw the court as having always been the instrument of the power and prerogative of the land, but having customs and laws designed for the safety of the king's subjects. It is doubtful that he was a member of the Society of Antiquaries, but he was friendly with many of them, especially William Camden, shared many of their interests, collecting prints, drawings, coins, medals, engraved stones, armour, books, and musical instruments, and was an accomplished Italianist. His fifth son's wife, Anne, recording family tradition about him, writes that he was thought to be popular with Prince Henry, who might have made him a secretary of state, and that he was a skilled breeder of horses. His gardens at Ware Park were praised by Sir Henry Wotton for their fruits, flowers, and herbs, being described as &#145;a delicate and diligent curiosity, surely without parallel among foreign nations&#146;  (Wotton, 196). His income was said to be &pound;4000 per annum and his retinue numerous, but he left no debts and was able to provide &pound;1500 apiece for his five surviving daughters. He died unexpectedly of an apoplexy at Ware on 10 March 1616 and was buried on 19 March in the south aisle of Ware church next to his father. He took care in establishing the reversion to his office so that it could be held in trust for his eldest son. His will, drawn up in 1613, details his religious beliefs, stressing his commitment to the established church, to justification by faith alone but also to the role of works in making faith effectual.<br>
