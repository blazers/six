<span class="headword">Coles,  John</span>  (1623/4&#150;1678), <span class="occ">translator</span>, was born in Adderbury, Oxfordshire, the son of John Coles, a clergyman. Having been educated at Winchester College, which he entered in 1638, he was admitted as a scholar of New College, Oxford, on 19 August 1643 and matriculated there on 27 October aged nineteen, by which time he appears to have been also teaching at the grammar school in the college's cloister. He was made a full fellow of the college on 19 August 1645. Coles was ejected from the university by the parliamentary visitors in May 1648, before he had taken a degree. In 1652 he became first undermaster at the Merchant Taylors' School in London but resigned in 1658 when he was appointed master of Wolverhampton grammar school, of which the Merchant Taylors' Company were also trustees. With his wife, Joyce, who Coles married when he was still in Oxford (&#145;but not to his content&#146;, according to Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4.540), he had ten children, of whom the eldest, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5892/', "Elisha Coles (c.1640&#150;1680)")</script>, published books of lexicography. The maintenance of his family brought Coles into debt, from which the Merchant Taylors' Company extracted him on more than one occasion.<br>
<br>Coles translated several parts of the romance <span class="italic">Cl&eacute;opatre</span> by Gauthier de Costes de la Calpren&egrave;de, which describes the adventures of the daughter of Antony and Cleopatra. Although the translation was begun by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17048/', "Robert Loveday")</script>, Coles's collaboration, according to his address to the reader in the 1656 edition, led to the completion of part 4: &#145;It was committed to my hands, and finished in his lifetime, but whether he would have laid it by, or have sweetened it with some live-touches of his own, and permitted it to have been publick, I know not&#146;  (Calpren&egrave;de, pt 4, sig. A1<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>Coles deprecated this first offering, declaring a preference for &#145;sence before sound&#146;, and likened his subsequent efforts in translating parts 5 and 6 (both published 1656) to those of a candle that &#145;may be sometimes serviceable, when the Sun affords not his rayes&#146;  (Calpren&egrave;de, pt 4, sig. A1<i>r</i>; pt 6, sig. A4<i>v</i>). His translations, however, have not always been correctly attributed and in the complete version of the romance (1665) Loveday is erroneously credited with parts 4, 5, and 6. This edition also contains Coles's version of part 7 (first published in 1658 under the title <span class="italic">Hymen's praeludia, or, Love's Master-Piece</span>, by which name the entire translation later became known). To all his publications are prefixed laudatory verses by, among others, Kenelm Digby and Thomas Manley. Taken together Coles's translations form a hefty work and, on completing part 7, he &#145;willingly quit[s] the employment&#146;  (ibid., pt 7, sig. A2<i>v</i>). Nevertheless, for all the romance's rambling, cumbersome narrative, his rendering is lucid and coherent and even allows of some elegant touches. It stands well alongside the earlier sections by Loveday and the later ones by James Webb and John Davies, and often exceeds them in terms of readability.<br>
<br>In 1666 Coles published his thoughts on education in <span class="italic">Apotheca scholastica</span>. Alongside the schoolmaster's unorthodox means of increasing his pupils' Latin vocabulary via rhyming English equivalents&#151;for example, &#145;<i>Lepidus</i>, pretty; <i>Ingeniosus</i>, witty; <i>Lendosus</i>, nitty&#146;  (Coles, 11)&#151;the book contains some verses in Latin and English and a Latin speech on Charles II's coronation. Coles was buried in Wolverhampton, Staffordshire, on 3 February 1678. He was survived by his wife.<br>
