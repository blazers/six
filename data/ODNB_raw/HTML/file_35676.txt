<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Rashdall,  Hastings</span>  (1858&#150;1924), <span class="occ">moral philosopher, theologian, and historian</span>, was born at 34 St George's Road, Kensington, London, on 24 June 1858, the eldest child of the Revd John Rashdall (<i>d</i>. 1869?), incumbent of Eaton Chapel, Eaton Square, London, and afterwards (1864&#150;9) of Dawlish, and of Emily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hankey (1831&#150;1923), who came from a prominent Clapham evangelical family. Although he was to reject evangelicalism, Rashdall retained the moral seriousness of his upbringing and the combination of broad sympathy and firm churchmanship presented by his parents. John Rashdall was widely read and travelled, with many literary contacts; as a clergyman he worked closely with dissenters, an example which his son followed. At the same time he had an intense love of church order and worship, from which Hastings derived an appreciation of beautiful ceremonial, and of the liturgical proprieties. As a small child he preached sermons to his brother and sister in a night-gown with a red stocking for a hood. On his father's death the family moved to Cheltenham. Rashdall remained particularly close to his mother, an intellectually serious woman, with whom he talked and corresponded about theology and religious history, among many other things.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>In 1871 Rashdall went to Harrow School, to the house of the headmaster, Montagu Butler, whom he greatly admired and from whom he drew the initial inspiration for his liberal churchmanship. When later asked whom he considered his most distinguished pupil, Butler replied: &#145;It is not easy to say, but, if you press me, I think&#151;Rashdall&#146;  (Matheson, 26). During his school holidays he visited art galleries and law courts, and developed a fascination for legal questions (indeed he later said that he would have liked to be a judge). In 1876 he became head of house and in 1877 head of school. In 1877 Rashdall won a scholarship to New College, Oxford, where he got a second both in classical moderations (1878) and in Greats (1881). He was never a very accurate classicist, and was probably not helped in examinations by his appalling handwriting. He had spent much of his time as an undergraduate working on history, and in 1879 won the Stanhope essay prize with an essay on John Hus. He twice failed to win a fellowship by examination, but won the chancellor's essay prize in 1883 for an essay on the universities of the middle ages. After teaching briefly at the recently founded Oxford high school he went in 1883 as a lecturer to St David's College, Lampeter (where he became a friend of T. F. Tout, then professor of history), and then to University College, Durham, between 1884 and 1888. In 1884 and 1886 he was ordained deacon and priest respectively. In 1888 he returned to Oxford as a fellow of Hertford College, to teach philosophy for <i>literae humaniores</i>. He remained there until 1895, although in 1894&#150;5 he held the fellowship in combination with the chaplaincy (and tutorship in divinity) at Balliol, where he lived. In 1895 he was elected to a fellowship and tutorship in philosophy at New College, a post which he held for the next twenty-two years.<br>
<br>A legend for his absent-mindedness, untidy appearance, and lack of physical co-ordination, Rashdall was a much loved tutor, remembered for being fresh and interested during tutorials, and for taking his pupils for long argumentative walks or on reading parties, and for drawing out the socially awkward. A colleague recalled returning to his room to find all his chairs borrowed for one of Rashdall's fortnightly symposia on the philosophy of religion, which were occasions of great high spirits. His lectures attracted large audiences and provoked lively discussion. Even as an undergraduate he had been known as &#145;the Socrates of the Cornmarket&#146;: he believed in the challenge of critical exchange, whether in the lecture hall, in his study, in the park, or on street corners, and his fundamental seriousness of purpose was reinforced by an infectious sense of humour. A fairly short man, with a large round head and high brow, his thoughtful eyes under shaggy eyebrows were frequently filled with laughter.<br>
<br>Rashdall corresponded extensively with former pupils, and with many who read and used his writings as aids to teaching or stimuli to creative thought. A man of vehement opinions&#151;&#145;It is astonishing how I hate a Tory peer&#146;  (Joseph, 276)&#151;and of great kindness&#151;a tory peer was in the flesh quite safe with him&#151;he was an influential teacher and critic, and in all that he did emphasized the importance of study as the prerequisite to action.<h2>
<a name="Works"></a>Works</h2>During this period Rashdall wrote, preached, lectured, and published over an extraordinary intellectual range. He never thought in compartments. He had the spirit and courage to take on research projects which would have daunted others (he habitually worked late into the night) and to champion unpopular causes and lines of argument, to the ultimate detriment of his career in the church. The central contours of his thought remained consistent throughout his life. His first major publication, the three-volume historical work <span class="italic">The Universities of Europe in the Middle Ages</span> (1895)&#151;an expansion of his chancellor's prize essay&#151;remains to this day a standard work. A volume of university sermons was published in 1898 as <span class="italic">Doctrine and Development</span>. <span class="italic">The Theory of Good and Evil</span> (1907) brought together and elaborated his lectures on moral philosophy. Both works incorporated distinctive and controversial arguments about the limitations of divine power. Both were widely read, and appreciated: Rashdall received many letters from lay people and clergy thanking him for making it philosophically respectable to be a theist. He also published extensively in periodicals such as <span class="italic">Mind</span> and the <span class="italic">International Journal of Ethics</span>, as well as in the <span class="italic">English Historical Review</span> from its first number.<br>
<br>The historical perspective remained fundamental to Rashdall. His work on medieval universities focused on the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, significantly a period of revived incarnationalism and natural philosophy. The twelfth-century theologian Peter Abelard was a major inspiration, both in his stress on the exemplary aspects of the incarnation and the crucifixion, and in the attention which he paid to the context in which intellectual and theological positions were developed. Rashdall always stressed the importance of recognizing the existence of traditions, to which one should apply critical reason. He sharply attacked any philosophical approach which tried to present Christianity without reference to the historical person of Christ, and worked to demonstrate how the Christian tradition could be discussed in a modern intellectual context, and the implications of this for a successful moral philosophy. As a historian he pointed out the futility of looking for biblical proof texts to support particular social or moral positions, instead of realizing that the real meaning of an ethical formula can only be discovered from its context, which is a developing one. He was preoccupied with the fundamental nature of the relationship between philosophy and theology, and its bearing on moral understanding, and was concerned about how the philosophical trends of his day threatened to undermine the force of this relationship. His own philosophical position, which he called &#145;ideal utilitarianism&#146; or &#145;empirical idealism&#146;, modified the extremes of both utilitarianism and idealism in an attempt to draw on the strengths of both Henry Sidgwick and T. H. Green. He tried to trace a path between the relativism which could come from fashionable reference to the psychology of religious experience, and the forms of philosophical absolutism which seemed to lower the philosophical status of personality and to deny significance to history.<br>
<br>Rashdall's philosophical and theological concerns were always practical, and were always directed educationally. The full force of his invective was directed against facile polarization between the spiritual and the worldly, which could provide an excuse for failure to apply faith practically. He passionately believed that theology had to be reconstructed to be both metaphysically plausible and practically engaging. This project he pursued as a member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96304', "Synthetic Society")</script> for philosophical and theological discussion, set up in 1896 (out of the Metaphysical Society) by Arthur Balfour, Wilfrid Ward, and Bishop E. S. Talbot to confront the challenge of agnosticism and to reinforce a working philosophy of religious belief. He pursued it more broadly in his work for the Workers' Educational Association, and in his lectures to university extension students and to Toynbee Hall in London. He was a founding member of the Christian Social Union from 1890, and from 1892 to 1910 was an editor of its organ, the <span class="italic">Economic Review</span>. He was among the most effective defenders of the rationale for such a body, set up to stimulate Christian reflection on ethics and economics, and to revive a commitment to Christian social ethics. He published influential articles, especially on the relationship between the individual, the church, and the state. In 1897 he was appointed preacher (for five years) at Lincoln's Inn. From its establishment in 1898 he was vice-president of the Churchmen's Union &#145;for the advancement of liberal religious thought&#146;, and took an active role in its work (which was recognized by his election as its president in 1923). He published frequently in the <span class="italic">Liberal Churchman</span> (later the <span class="italic">Modern Churchman</span>). A supporter of progressive movements in general (such as women's suffrage), he was a liberal in politics (although unionist by inclination: until 1906 he opposed home rule for Ireland, and he argued strongly against disestablishment of the Welsh church).<h2>
<a name="Marriagelatercareer"></a>Marriage: later career</h2>In July 1905 Hastings Rashdall married Constance Makins, and they settled in 18 Longwall, Oxford, where they entertained generously. Theirs was a very close and happy marriage. In Oxford, Rashdall continued to be active on many fronts, and was called on to contribute to the debate on university reform. His proposals on how to enhance the career of the college tutor had an influence on the revised statutes of 1926. He also strongly supported granting degrees to women in Oxford. In 1909 Rashdall was appointed by the liberal bishop John Percival to a canonry at Hereford, and to share in running a (short-lived) experiment in reformed clerical education. He was installed in 1910, and for the next seven years was resident for five months of the year, retaining his fellowship (without the tutorship) at New College, where he spent the rest of each year. Rashdall was consistently committed to improving clerical training, and believed that the church would lose its influence in national life if it failed to prepare the clergy better for responding to the intellectual demands of the laity. He emphasized that such intellectual demands came just as much from working people as from the middle classes, and regarded the wide range of contexts in which he pursued his own preaching and teaching ministry in this light.<br>
<br>In 1913 Rashdall went with his wife to the United States to lecture in California and Ohio and to visit New York and Harvard. In 1915 he delivered the Bampton lectures in Oxford, published in 1919 as <span class="italic">The Idea of the Atonement in Christian Theology</span>, which drew on his lifelong engagement with Abelard's resolution of the relationship between the life and death of Christ in the work of redemption. The lectures were well received and reinforced the seriousness of his reputation as a theologian. Meanwhile, Rashdall hoped that the outbreak of war would focus the church more effectively on reforming itself and defining its role in national renewal. He continued to publish energetically, on the problem of evil, on the moral dilemmas associated with conscientious objection, on social and educational reform. He also yearned to find a way of getting personally involved in the war effort. He joined the volunteer corps in Oxford in 1915, and in 1917 finally obtained employment in the Admiralty intelligence department. In May 1917, under the aegis of the coalition government, he was appointed dean of Carlisle, and resigned the canonry and his fellowship at New College (he was elected to an honorary fellowship in 1920). He and Constance put enormous energy into their role in Carlisle. A notable feature of this was the bringing together of other city clergy and of nonconformist ministers in cathedral life and worship, which began during the last year of the war. Rashdall's consistent respect for nonconformity was rewarded when all the nonconformist ministers of Carlisle signed a letter of protest against allegations in 1921 that he had denied the divinity of Christ. These allegations caused Rashdall much distress, compounded by increasing problems of ill health. Long a sufferer from rheumatic pain, he was now diagnosed with cancer, and on 9 February 1924 he died at Worthing. He was buried on 13 February at Holywell cemetery in Oxford; his wife survived him. A memorial tablet was placed in New College cloister by the warden and fellows, and another was placed in the south aisle of Carlisle Cathedral by his wife, who also gave two bells to complete a peal to be rung annually on his birthday. An exhibition was founded by his friends for boys and girls from the diocese of Carlisle awarded scholarships or exhibitions at Oxford.<h2>
<a name="Reputationandlegacy"></a>Reputation and legacy</h2>Rashdall's personal influence was deep and extensive, as was revealed by the appreciations of his life by major figures in liberal churchmanship, as well as by the tributes paid by much wider circles of people. The fertility of his published work was striking. Yet his reputation suffered something of the fate which he perceived to have befallen several of the medieval philosophical and theological thinkers whom he himself had studied and in whose ideas he had helped to revive interest. His intellectual position was an independent one, for he stood outside established camps and was not by temperament a systematizer. He said of himself: &#145;My position is very difficult. You see I am on the left wing of the Church and the right wing of the philosophers&#146;  (Matheson, 78). Historians of religious thought have taken some account of his liberal churchmanship. But philosophers have underplayed the persistence and vitality of the idealist tradition in the early twentieth century, and have ignored as leading nowhere the distinctively modified idealism which Rashdall developed. They have tended to take an unhistorical view, and to regard as insignificant what seemed in terms of later philosophical fashion to be outmoded. Although even in his own day Rashdall was a maverick, he was highly respected as such, and the issues with which he engaged were central ones. The challenge of reinforcing an intellectually satisfactory Christian moral and social philosophy continued to be real, and was one to which Rashdall was principally devoted. Only from the late 1980s have there been renewed flickers of interest in Rashdall among liberal intellectual churchpeople facing a new set of challenges to the sorts of approach to faith and reason which he advocated.<br>
