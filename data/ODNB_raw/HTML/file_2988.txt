<span class="headword">Bourchier,  Henry</span>, second earl of Essex  (1472&#150;1540), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the son of Sir William Bourchier (<i>d</i>. 1483) and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1489), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29939/', "Richard Woodville (Wydeville), Earl Rivers")</script>. His father's death made Henry heir to his grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2987/', "Henry Bourchier, first earl of Essex")</script>, who died later in 1483. His inherited position was strong in both political and dynastic terms: his grandfather had been a leading Yorkist councillor, his great-uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2993/', "Thomas Bourchier")</script> was archbishop of Canterbury, and through his mother he was first cousin to Henry VII's queen Elizabeth. His background fitted him for a central place at the new Tudor court and he was duly prominent in all its great ceremonial occasions, from Henry's coronation in 1485 to Elizabeth's funeral in 1503 and beyond. As he reached maturity in the 1490s he also took a leading part in court jousts and revels. He sat occasionally in the king's council and was named to royal commissions but held no great responsibility in Henry's government. His limited aspirations perhaps helped to preserve him from the political turmoil that engulfed other aristocratic courtiers from 1501, but his service to Henry was not without reward in small grants of land and other favours.<br>
<br>Greater prospects beckoned with the accession of Henry VIII, who made Essex captain of his new guard, the king's spears, in November 1509 and constable of Windsor Castle in July 1511. For the first two years of the new reign Essex jousted and danced with the king as much as anyone, but thereafter he was supplanted by younger favourites. He last jousted at court in June 1517 and began a steady retreat into the life of a country peer. His military career equally never matched those of his forebears. He raised troops and fought loyally in France in 1492 and against the rebels of 1497; he oversaw musters in 1512 and contributed 469 men to Henry's French campaign of 1513, when he led a cavalry charge to rescue captured artillery. Yet in 1521, when his &#145;hardinesse&#146; brought him to the king's mind as a possible commander for an expeditionary force, it was stressed that he would need &#145;sad [counsillors] adjoyned to hym&#146;, and he was not chosen  (<span class="italic">State Papers, Henry VIII</span>, 1.32).<br>
<br>In the 1520s Essex still appeared at court on occasion, serving as marshal of the English party at the Field of Cloth of Gold in 1520, and attended some sessions of the council. But in the 1530s he generally turned out only for the greatest events. He was licensed to miss every session of the Reformation Parliament and he attended only sparsely in 1536 and 1539. Officially it was ill health and deafness that prevented his attendance, but he could be lively enough at home in Essex, whether on his own business or the king's. His household accounts for 1533/4 show him hunting and travelling between his houses, and in 1539 he reviewed coastal defences in the spring and oversaw the trial of the abbot of Colchester in December. Though his religion was conservative it does not seem to have been passionately so: it was more likely indifference than dissidence that kept him away from the centre of affairs.<br>
<br>At the local level Essex's influence rested on an unusually concentrated body of estates in Essex, Hertfordshire, and Suffolk, sufficient to generate a taxable income just below the mean for the peerage, at &pound;568 11<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>. in 1523 and &pound;850 in 1534. The main inheritance, of which he had livery in September 1493, had been reduced amid the complex politics of 1483&#150;5 to less than half his grandfather's holdings at their peak, but it was subsequently complemented by lands inherited from his uncle Sir Thomas Bourchier in 1491 and from his mother in 1503 on the death of her second husband, the earl of Kent. Essex was not very active on the land market, but he did make some efforts to expand his estates further. His bid for the lands of dissolved Beeleigh Abbey, where his ancestors lay buried, was unsuccessful. More effective, but at the cost of considerable trouble, was his marriage to Mary, one of the two daughters and heirs of the Hertfordshire knight Sir William Say. Their marriage contract of 1497 promised them a share of Say's lands worth &pound;200, but failed to specify which estates should make it up. In 1499 Mary's sister Elizabeth married William, Lord Mountjoy, and it took lawsuits lasting from 1505 to 1515 to settle which of Say's manors would pass to which daughter. Essex could be pleased with the final outcome, which at Say's death in 1529 gave him estates near his own and sufficiently valuable to make up more than a quarter of his income by his death. Mary was alive in 1535, but not at her husband's death in 1540. Essex seems to have been an attentive and effective landlord and though often in debt was never in serious financial difficulties. He maintained a household of about fifty servants and rebuilt his main seat, Stanstead Hall in Halstead, as a moated brick courtyard-house with elaborate turrets and chimneys.<br>
<br>Essex's following among the greater gentry of his region was less impressive than that of his richer and more politically prominent neighbours, the de Vere earls of Oxford. His affinity&#151;a tight network of his tenants and local officers and above them a dozen Essex and Hertfordshire gentlemen of middling rank, frequent occupants of county administrative offices and in several cases highly assiduous justices of the peace&#151;none the less met his rather limited aims. Those aims were perhaps constricted further by his lack of a son. His daughter Anne had married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21405/', "Sir William Parr")</script> in 1527. When Essex fell off a young horse and broke his neck on 13 March 1540, they inherited his estates, but his title was granted to Thomas Cromwell. It was only in 1543, when his sister Katherine married the king, that Sir William followed his father-in-law as earl of Essex. Henry Bourchier was buried at Little Easton, Essex.<br>
