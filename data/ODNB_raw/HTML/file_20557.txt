<span class="headword">O'Donnell, Lady  Mary Stuart</span>  (<em>b. </em>1607?, <em>d.</em> in or after 1639), <span class="occ">noblewoman</span>, was the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20559/', "Rury O'Donnell, first earl of Tyrconnell (1574/5&#150;1608)")</script>, and his wife, Lady Brigid Fitzgerald (<i>c</i>.1589&#150;1682), only daughter of Henry Fitzgerald, twelfth earl of Kildare, and Frances, daughter of Charles Howard, first earl of Nottingham. In September 1607 her father, disappointed with the numerous exclusions to his patent as earl, fled Ireland for the continent with his infant son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74430/', "Hugh Albert O'Donnell (1606&#150;1642)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20559/', "O'Donnell, Rury")</script>], and Hugh O'Neill, earl of Tyrone. At the time of this flight, Tyrconnell's wife was at her family's Maynooth estate waiting to give birth. Although the earl intended Brigid to follow him abroad, she found herself in a disturbing predicament, forsaken by her husband and caught up in the political wake stirred by his actions. Guiding her through this crisis was her mother, the dowager countess of Kildare. She counselled her daughter to dissociate herself from her exiled husband, by denying foreknowledge of his &#145;unfortunate journey&#146; and repudiating her husband's &#145;ungrateful behavior&#146; in &#145;so wicked an enterprise as to rebel against his prince&#146; (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1600&#150;08</i>, 296&#150;7, B. O'Donnell to lord deputy, September 1607; <span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 9.482, B. O'Donnell to lord deputy, 1607).<br>
<br>After her disavowal, Brigid went to England to defend herself, and in London gave birth to Mary, probably in late 1607. Brigid, at an opportune moment, took the infant and pleaded her case before the king. James I was moved by her desperate condition and her &#145;sweet&#146; and &#145;well favoured&#146; appearance. He confessed that he could not understand how her husband &#145;left so fair a face behind&#146;  (Nichols, 2.157). The king granted her a pension of &pound;200 from the revenues of her husband's escheated estates and the baby was placed under royal protection. Henceforth, the child was known as Mary Stuart O'Donnell.<br>
<br>Mary returned while still an infant with her mother to Ireland, where she was raised as a Catholic on the Maynooth estate. In 1619, two years after Brigid remarried, Mary was sent to England to live with her maternal grandmother. (Her stepfather was Nicholas Barnewall, first Viscount Kingsland.) Within a few years, the strong-willed adolescent estranged her benefactors and family with disputes over her annuities, her Irish Catholic associations, and her marital status. She was a desirable heiress and both the Howard family and her grandmother believed that a protestant husband would resolve many of Mary's difficulties. But in 1626 she became involved in a plot that freed two young native Irish hostages from the Tower. Summoned to testify before the royal council, Mary, disguised as a young man, escaped to the continent and made her way to the Spanish Netherlands. In Brussels she met for the first time her brother, Hugh Albert O'Donnell, titular second earl of Tyrconnell. Through his influence she was well received at the infanta's court and was recommended by the Roman Catholic archbishop of Tuam, Florence Conry, and Guido di Bagno, the papal nuncio, to Cardinal Barberini, the papal secretary of state. Before their dispatches were forwarded, Pope Urban VIII sent his blessings: &#145;You, our daughter, have given to the world proof of &hellip; what strength and courage are imparted by the true faith.&#146; Praising her &#145;heroic&#146; nature and her resistance to the allurements of court, the menaces of the English king, and the &#145;horrors of an alliance with a Protestant&#146;, Urban celebrated her defiance and welcomed her tenderly into the bosom of the Roman church (Urban VIII to M. S. O'Donnell, 13 Feb 1627, Barberini Latini MS 6207, fol. 7<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>; MacGeoghan, 545).<br>
<br>These good feelings were spent when Mary refused to be used as a marital tool to heal the tensions between the O'Donnell and O'Neill factions. Florence Conry secured her a dowry and the support of the infanta for a marriage to John O'Neill, third earl of Tyrone. Anticipating a serious estrangement if she rejected this match, Mary took matters into her own hands. In the spring of 1627 she made a desperate appeal to Lord Conway, the English secretary of state. She explained away her London flight on her &#145;smallness of means and the fear of losing her reputation&#146;. Mary also suggested she might &#145;draw her brother into the King's service&#146; with the right royal guarantees  (O'Donnell to Conway, <i>c</i>.March 1627, <span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1625&#150;32</i>, 108). The futility of her appeal exposed the hopelessness of her position. She was in love with a poor Irish captain, Dudley (Dualtach) O'Gallagher, (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1635), and, true to her own legacy, in 1631 the pregnant Mary fled to Italy with her companion. About this time the young couple married, and while living in Genoa, Mary gave birth to a boy. With Rome unwilling to support their &#145;worthy daughter&#146; the young couple survived on a meagre subsidy from the infanta. As for her brother, Tyrconnell complained that a woman posing as his sister was defaming him and his house. Mary and her husband ultimately found refuge in Austria where Dudley perished in the imperial service about 1635. The widowed Mary made her way back to Rome and was last heard of in 1639.<br>
<br>Mary Stuart O'Donnell was a shadowy romantic figure whose notoriety was regularly noted in the dispatches and reports of gossipy field agents. Her father, Rury O'Donnell, died in Rome in July 1608 and his brother Caffar died there about a week later. This left Mary's brother Hugh Albert to claim the title of titular earl of Tyrconnell. He commanded an Irish regiment in the Spanish Netherlands with the title of colonel and died in the service of Spain in August 1642. Mary's mother, Brigid, eventually became Viscountess Kingsland from her second marriage, and had five sons and four daughters with her new husband. Widowed in 1663, she lived until 1682, the oldest surviving person associated with the 1607 &#145;flight of the earls&#146;.<br>
