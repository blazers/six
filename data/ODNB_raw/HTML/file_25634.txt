<span class="headword">Sinclair,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1337), <span class="occ">bishop of Dunkeld</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25632/', "Sir William Sinclair (d. 1299x1303)")</script>, lord of Roslin. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25618/', "Sir Henry Sinclair (d. c.1330)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25632/', "Sinclair, Sir William")</script>] was his brother. He was an early opponent of the English domination of Scotland, being captured with other members of his family in Dunbar Castle in 1296 and imprisoned for a while thereafter. In 1309, when he was already a canon of Dunkeld, a university graduate, and in possession of the church of Kinross, Sinclair was elected bishop of Dunkeld by the cathedral chapter on the death of Matthew Crambeth and travelled to the curia to seek consecration. The election was disputed by John Leek, a nominee of Edward II, but following unfinished litigation at the curia Leek's promotion to the archbishopric of Dublin left the path open for papal confirmation of Sinclair's election in May 1312. Although he had made his peace with the English king, he seems to have been treated with some suspicion by Edward II, who, in giving him a safe conduct to Berwick in 1313 (presumably on his return from the curia), made it conditional upon his not proceeding further into Scotland, nor communicating with &#145;the enemy&#146;.<br>
<br>Sinclair certainly supported Robert I after Bannockburn. He attended several parliaments from 1314 onwards, and the frequency of his appearances in the witness lists of King Robert's <span class="italic">acta</span> suggests that he was regarded as a favourite of the king. Bower recounts how Sinclair endeared himself to Robert I by personally leading a small force to defeat an attempted English invasion of Fife. He none the less joined the political majority in 1332, adhering to the pro-Balliol faction. On 24 September 1332 he crowned Edward Balliol at Scone, and he was present at Balliol's parliament of February 1334. Later, however, the English appear again to have mistrusted him, for in 1335&#150;6 he was reported as acting contrary to his allegiance, and therefore, although he witnessed none of David II's royal acts, his loyalties may have reverted to the Bruce kingship before his death on 27 June 1337. Apparently active in his diocese as well as at court, Sinclair is credited with achieving significant building work on his cathedral church, where he was buried.<br>
