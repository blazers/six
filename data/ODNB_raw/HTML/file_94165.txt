<span class="headword">Ware,  Richard  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1283), <span class="occ">abbot of Westminster</span>, is of unknown origins. His life is unknown before 1257 when he appears as a Westminster monk acting as the proctor for Abbot Richard of Croxley. The career and connections that secured his elevation to the abbacy late in 1258 are thus obscure. Ware, however, was evidently a man of imagination and of business, although his promotion was somewhat fortuitous, his predecessor, Philip of Lewisham, having died in office only a few months after succeeding Croxley. Licence to elect a successor to Lewisham was granted on 1 December 1258, and Henry III gave his assent on the 15th. In the following year Ware travelled to Italy to secure confirmation from Pope Alexander IV (who made him a papal chaplain on 11 March), and saw at Anagni, in the crypt and nave of the cathedral, the superb pavements made by craftsmen (described later as Cosmati) who specialized in mosaics made from porphyry and other stones taken from the buildings of antiquity. On his return Ware may well have inspired Henry III, then pressing on with the rebuilding of Westminster Abbey in honour of Edward the Confessor, to scrap previous plans and commission a Cosmati shrine for the saint, a shrine that was probably under construction in 1262. This first commission led to another. On a later visit to the papal court, either in 1266 or 1267, Ware secured and brought back to England &#145;for the king's use&#146; the stones and craftsmen to make the great pavement which still survives before the high altar of the abbey, a pavement dated by its contemporary inscription to 1268. Although the next year Ware received some recompense from the king for the cost of the pavement, he may well have shouldered the main burden himself, as the Westminster monk John Flete claimed in his history of the abbey written in the early fifteenth century. The pavement, a magnificent, multicoloured combination of zones and spheres, depicts the universe. A riddling inscription (now mostly lost) gave the date of the universe's end, and thus of the second coming of Christ and the last judgment. How necessary, therefore, was the intercession of the saint whose glittering shrine rose immediately to the west of the pavement beyond and above the high altar.<br>
<br>Ware was a man of varied skills. In 1265 he was sent by Simon de Montfort on a mission to the French court, and he was employed again as a diplomat by Edward I, most notably in 1279 when he negotiated the marriage between the king's daughter, Margaret, and the eldest son of the duke of Brabant. A year earlier he had been named as chief justice for an eyre that was about to begin in the north of England, but in the end he took no part in it. The climax of his career as a public servant came on 18 June 1280, when he was made treasurer of the exchequer, the chief financial officer of the realm, a post that he held until his death. The king's favour enabled Ware to protect and extend the privileges of the abbey, and in 1280 he secured the confirmation of many of its royal charters. Three years later he vigorously resisted an attempt by Godfrey Giffard, bishop of Worcester, to exercise authority over the abbey's dependent priory at Great Malvern. Ware had long displayed his business acumen. He freed the monastery from a &pound;400 debt to Italian merchants, purchased the manor of Great Amwell in Hertfordshire for &pound;566, enclosed his park at Tiddesley near Pershore, and built a house in the abbey's cemetery so that its rents could support the lights at the high altar and the shrine of Saint Edward.<br>
<br>Ware was also concerned with the health of the abbey's internal life, doubtless much disrupted by the building of the new church. He thus commissioned the writing of a customary, a book &#145;very necessary for the common utility of all, both for divine office and for the diverse customs of the monastery&#146;, as Flete put it  (<span class="italic">History of Westminster Abbey</span>, 114). Ware made use of earlier materials, but the work was unprecedented in its scale. The fourth section (all that survives) forms a separate book, running to 247 pages of modern print. It ranges from the office of the abbot to that of the gardener, and gives minute instructions for the care of sick and dying monks. In 1268, two years after the customary was begun (it took many years to complete), the papal legate Ottobuono held a visitation of the abbey, although delegating the actual work to Pierre de Tarentaise (later Pope Innocent V) and the dean of Bayeux. Their reforms included moving the prior's chamber into the heart of the monastic buildings, and closing a postern gate so that the infirmary could not be used as a thoroughfare between the abbey and the royal palace. Ware must have been pleased that henceforth the monks were not to engage in property transactions without the abbot's consent. He himself emerged unscathed, and that so little generally was found amiss is a considerable tribute to his rule.<br>
<br>Ware died suddenly in London about the beginning of December 1283, reportedly while on the king's service. According to the Dunstable annalist his severity meant he was little mourned by the convent. The customary itself shows that he had tried to restrict contact between the monks and the abbey's resident almsmen or lay brothers. The endowment he provided for the celebration of his anniversary was reduced, the monks preferring to retain a portion of the income and assign it to their kitchen. Flete, however, described Ware as a wise and discreet man (<i>vir sapiens et discretus</i>), and his greatest achievements, the pavement and the customary, were certainly remembered and valued at Westminster. Ware was buried under the pavement before the high altar, and an inscription (now lost) explained how he had brought thither the stones to make it: &#145;Abbot Richard de Ware who rests here, now carries the stones he carried here from Rome&#146;  (Foster, 20&#150;21). A graceful image of Ware survives on his abbatial seal, where he is not shown standing four-square in the usual way but turns a little to his right. Influenced by continental models, the design reflects the aesthetic sense and cosmopolitan outlook that were so important in Ware's career.<br>
