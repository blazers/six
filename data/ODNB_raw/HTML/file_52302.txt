<span class="headword">Hlothhere</span>  (<em>d.</em> 685), <span class="occ">king of Kent</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39239/', "Eorcenberht (d. 664), king of Kent")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25150/', "Seaxburh (d. c.700)")</script>, daughter of Anna, king of the East Angles, and later abbess of Ely. He succeeded to the kingship after the death of his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54039/', "Ecgberht I")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39239/', "Eorcenberht")</script>] in July 673. It has been argued that there was an interregnum of several months before Hlothhere managed to establish himself as king; but this hypothesis is based on the testimony of an unreliable charter (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 7), and it seems best to follow Bede, who dates the period of Hlothhere's rule from July 673 to February 685. Hlothhere does, however, appear to have experienced difficulties at the beginning of his reign. His brother Ecgberht had had some degree of control in Surrey (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 1165), but overlordship of that area had passed to Wulfhere, king of the Mercians, at some point before 674; even more indicative of a new Kentish weakness was the devastating invasion of the kingdom in 676 by Wulfhere's successor, &AElig;thelred, during which the city of Rochester was sacked and destroyed. It is possible that the instability of the kingdom in this period was the result of dynastic conflict. King Ecgberht's two sons, <a href="#cosubject_52302">Eadric [<i>see below</i>]</a> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29381/', "Wihtred")</script>, had been passed over on his death. Eventually Eadric enlisted the help of the South Saxons to oust his uncle from the kingship; Hlothhere was fatally wounded in the ensuing battle and died on 6 February 685. He was buried in the monastery of St Peter and St Paul (later St Augustine's Abbey) in Canterbury.<br>
<br>Before this encounter Eadric may at some stage have ruled jointly with his uncle: his consent is referred to in the record of a land grant which Hlothhere made in 679 (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 8), and a law-code has survived which is said to represent &#145;the decrees which Hlothhere and Eadric, kings of Kent, established&#146;  (<span class="italic">English Historical Documents</span>, 1.360). The lawgivers declare explicitly that their new laws are additional to the existing law of the Kentish people (which may be a reference to the law-code of &AElig;thelberht I), and for the most part the decrees simply give supplementary detail about the fines for criminal activity and about legal procedure. However, some extra interest attaches to a series of provisions regarding the purchase of land in London by a Kentishman, which seem to indicate that the Kentish kings maintained a hall and a reeve in that city; it is not clear whether this means that Hlothhere and Eadric enjoyed some degree of political control over London, or whether these arrangements were simply a reflection of the city's importance as a trading centre, an &#145;emporium of many peoples&#146;  (Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 2.3).<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_52302"></a><span class="headword">Eadric</span>  (<em>d.</em> 686), <span class="occ">king of Kent</span>, ruled for a year and a half. His violent bid for the kingship appears to have formed a precedent, for after his death, in Bede's words, &#145;various usurpers or foreign kings plundered the kingdom for a certain space of time until the rightful king, Wihtred, son of Ecgberht, established himself on the throne and freed the nation from foreign invasion&#146;  (Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 4.26). The first of these incursions came from Wessex. The <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> notes that in 686 King C&aelig;dwalla and his brother Mul ravaged Kent; in the following year Mul and twelve companions were &#145;burnt&#146; in Kent, prompting another West Saxon ravaging of the kingdom. There is some evidence that Mul was installed for a short time as king of Kent, and that he was buried in the monastery of St Peter and St Paul, Canterbury, at that time the principal Kentish royal burial church. During the West Saxon occupation of the kingdom C&aelig;dwalla appears to have founded a monastery at Hoo.<br>
<br>The next &#145;usurper&#146; was Sw&aelig;fheard, who came to power in Kent at some point in the year before 29 February 688. He was the son of S&aelig;bbi, king of the East Saxons, and his success in Kent was probably due at least initially to an invasion by an East Saxon army; at some stage he also came to rely on Mercian support, acknowledging the overlordship of &AElig;thelred, king of the Mercians. Another Mercian candidate, a certain Oswine, also emerged as king in Kent in the course of 688, or perhaps in very early 689; about 690 he was reigning jointly with Sw&aelig;fheard, but he quickly disappears from the record. One very difficult charter in the archive of Minster in Thanet (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 11) suggests that there may have been a King Sw&aelig;fberht in Kent at this time, also ruling jointly with Oswine (although there is a good chance that the name in the charter is a corruption of Sw&aelig;fheard's).<br>
<br>In the early 690s Eadric's brother Wihtred was able to gather enough support to make a bid for the kingdom. In July 692 he was ruling jointly with Sw&aelig;fheard in Kent; by 694 Sw&aelig;fheard had disappeared and Wihtred was the sole ruler of the kingdom.<br>
