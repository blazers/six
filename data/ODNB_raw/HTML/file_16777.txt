<span class="headword">Littledale, Sir  Joseph</span>  (1767&#150;1842), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 31 May 1767, the eldest son of Henry Littledale, a mercer and draper, of Eton House, Lancashire, who came from a Cumberland family, and his wife, Sarah (<i>d</i>.1807), daughter of Isaac Wilkinson of Whitehaven. He was educated at St John's College, Cambridge, where he was senior wrangler and Smith's prizeman, and graduated BA in 1787, proceeding to an MA in 1790. In 1789 he was elected to a fellowship at St John's, which he held until his marriage. He was admitted at Lincoln's Inn in 1786, migrating in 1793 to Gray's Inn, and practised as a special pleader until he was called to the bar on 28 June 1798. Asked about his politics, he is said to have given the reply, which became a <i>bon mot</i> in legal circles: &#145;My politics are the politics of a special pleader&#146;. He joined the northern circuit, attending the Chester sessions, and in 1813 was appointed counsel to the University of Cambridge. In 1813, along with his younger brother Edward Littledale (1779/80&#150;1837), also a bibliophile, he was elected a member of the Roxburghe Club, for which in 1821 he edited Skelton's <span class="italic">Magnyfycence, an Interlude</span>. He married on 26 February 1821 Hannah Timberlake (<i>d</i>. 1857).<br>
<br>On 30 April 1824 Littledale succeeded Mr Justice Best as judge in the court of king's bench, although he had never been made a king's counsel or sat in parliament. Nor did he find any government patronage, beyond being appointed to assist in government prosecutions in Scotland in 1822. He was knighted on 9 June 1824.<br>
<br>Littledale resigned because of poor health on 31 January 1841. He was sworn of the privy council, but died shortly afterwards at his house in Bedford Square on 26 June 1842 and was buried in St George, Bloomsbury. He left a daughter, Elizabeth, who afterwards married Thomas Coventry, a barrister.<br>
