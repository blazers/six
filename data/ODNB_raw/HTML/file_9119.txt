<span class="headword">Falconer,  William</span>  (1801&#150;1885), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born on 27 December 1801 at Corston, Somerset, the eldest son of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9115/', "Revd Thomas Falconer MD (1771&#150;1839)")</script> and Frances, only child of Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Raitt. He was a member of a remarkable family. His paternal grandfather (1744&#150;1824), also named William, was a physician and a writer of some twenty-five miscellaneous tracts. William the younger had two brothers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9116/', "Thomas Falconer (1805&#150;1882)")</script>, jurist and writer largely on legal matters, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9113/', "Randle Wilbraham Falconer (1816&#150;1881)")</script>, physician and writer on medical matters. William Falconer matriculated from Oriel College, Oxford, on 10 December 1819, took a first in mathematics and a third in classics, graduated BA in 1823 and proceeded MA in 1827. On 30 June 1827 he was elected a Petrean fellow of Exeter College where he examined in mathematics in 1832&#150;3 and from 1836 to 1838. In 1839 he opened the Petrean scholarship to natives of Cheshire and on 26 January the same year he was given the rectory of Bushey, Hertfordshire. On 8 August 1839 he married Isabella Jane, daughter of J. Robinson, and widow of W. S. Douglas; she died at St Alessi, near Pistoia, on 7 February 1869.<br>
<br>William's father edited the text of Strabo's <span class="italic">Geography</span> in 1807, using materials left by his uncle Thomas Falconer (1738&#150;1792). He also left a manuscript translation of that work. Hans Claude Hamilton of the Public Record Office, antiquary and classical scholar, was appointed to translate Strabo for the <span class="roman">Bohn Classical Library</span>. It took him three years to finish the first six books, and Falconer, as son of the Oxford editor of Strabo, known to have had a translation of the <span class="italic">Geography</span> intended for publication, was asked to complete the translation of the remaining eleven books. The &#145;Notice&#146; prefatory to the first volume of the <span class="roman">Bohn</span> edition states that the text used for the translation was that of the edition by the German scholar Gustav Cramer. There is no mention of the two Thomas Falconers. The <span class="roman">Bohn</span> translation did not attract much attention, the reviewer of the first volume for the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> displaying his knowledge of the descent of the text of Strabo, but expressing no opinion of the translation  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 2nd ser., 43, 1855, 55&#150;6). William Falconer died at Bushey, Hertfordshire, on 9 February 1885.<br>
