<span class="headword">Gardner,  Martin John</span>  (1940&#150;1993), <span class="occ">medical statistician</span>, was born on 25 July 1940 at 253 Coventry Road, Ilford, Essex, the eldest child in the family of two sons and two daughters of Thomas Murray Gardner, marine superintendent, and his wife, Nellie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jackson. Educated at Palmer's Boys' School, Grays, Essex, he graduated from the University of Durham in 1961 with a first-class degree in mathematics. In 1962, after a year at Cambridge University working for the diploma in mathematical statistics, he joined the social medicine unit of the Medical Research Council at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and spent a year teaching at the University of California from 1966 to 1967. While in California, in 1967 he married Linda Claire Fritz, daughter of Edward C. Fritz, lawyer, of Dallas, Texas; they had two sons and one daughter. He moved to the University of Southampton in 1972 as senior lecturer in medical statistics, and reader from 1979, and was appointed professor of medical statistics in 1985. He also held a post at the environmental epidemiology unit of the Medical Research Council at Southampton General Hospital from 1980.<br>
<br>Gardner's research centred on the geographical distribution of major diseases, and he published an <span class="italic">Atlas of Cancer Mortality in England and Wales, 1968&#150;78</span> (1983) and an <span class="italic">Atlas of Mortality from Selected Diseases in England and Wales, 1968&#150;1978</span> (1984). Much of his time was spent teaching medical scientists the importance of a study's initial design, and his success in raising the quality of statistical methods used in medical studies led to his appointment in 1980 as the main statistical adviser for the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span>.<br>
<br>In November 1983 Gardner was asked to join the committee chaired by Sir Douglas Black examining cases of childhood leukaemia around British Nuclear Fuels' nuclear-fuel reprocessing plant at Sellafield, in west Cumbria. The committee had been set up by the government in response to the television documentary <span class="italic">Windscale&#151;the Nuclear Laundry</span> (1983), which argued that the cluster of children's deaths from leukaemia in Seascale could be attributed to contamination from radioactive waste discharged from the plant into the Irish Sea. The programme caused much public concern about the safety of nuclear plants. The Black report (1984) concluded that while there did seem to be an excess of childhood leukaemia in the Sellafield area, this could not be explained by an excess of environmental radioactivity, since not enough radioactive material had been released, and recommended further study. Gardner directed the research commissioned by the Department of Health and Social Security, setting up a study of all children born or attending schools in Seascale between 1950 and 1983. This showed that leukaemia occurred only in children born in the village, and that these cases were statistically related to their fathers' exposure to radiation while working at Sellafield before the children's conception. These findings were published in the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span> in 1990 in an article, &#145;Results of a case-control study of leukaemia and lymphoma among young people near Sellafield plant in west Cumbria&#146;. In the same article Gardner stated his hypothesis that exposure to very low levels of radiation, previously thought safe, could have damaged the sperm of men working at Sellafield, introducing a mutation passed on to their children, who would have been born with a susceptibility to leukaemia. This became known as the Gardner hypothesis, and led to further studies both in England and abroad to see whether childhood cancer could be linked to fathers' exposure to radiation. Gardner's study was highly controversial, and leading medical scientists began to question his hypothesis, asking why, if childhood leukaemia was linked to fathers' employment in the nuclear industry, it should be confined to children born in Seascale and not elsewhere in Cumbria, and to develop the theory that infection could be a cause of childhood leukaemia. Nevertheless Gardner's work stimulated some of the most thorough investigations of childhood cancer ever undertaken, and expanded the understanding of its causes. In its report in 1996 the Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment found no evidence to support Gardner's hypothesis.<br>
<br>Gardner died on 22 January 1993 in Countess Mountbatten House, Moorgreen Hospital, West End, Eastleigh, Hampshire. After his death <span class="italic">Childhood Cancer and Nuclear Installations</span> (1993), a collection of papers, letters, and reports, edited by Valerie Beral, Eve Roman, and Martin Bobrow, was dedicated to his memory. He was survived by his wife, Linda, and their three children.<br>
