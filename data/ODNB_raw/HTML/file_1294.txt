<span class="headword">Banks, Sir  Edward</span>  (1770&#150;1835), <span class="occ">builder and contractor</span>, was born near Richmond, Yorkshire, on 4 January 1770; nothing is known of his parentage. As a young man he went to sea for two years. After returning to Yorkshire, in 1789 he became involved with the first of many construction projects, undertaking sea banking and draining in Holderness.<br>
<br>In 1791 Banks became contractor on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, and in 1793 under the engineer John Rennie (1761&#150;1821) worked on the Lancaster and Ulverston canals, rapidly extending his operations in 1795&#150;7 to the Huddersfield (including the 3&frac12; mile Marsden Tunnel), Peak Forest, and Ashton under Lyne canals. In 1800 he worked on several Derbyshire canals under William Jessop, as well as on tram roads and turnpikes, and began a carrying trade in coal and limestone, employing thirty barges. Jessop then engineered the Surrey iron railway (on which trucks were drawn by mules), which in 1803 Banks extended from Croydon to Merstham, where Colonel Hylton Jolliffe MP had an interest in lime works. Banks formed a partnership with Jolliffe, developing a considerable trade with London in building materials. Banks himself in 1810 surveyed the line of a canal to link Merstham with the proposed Grand Southern Canal to Portsmouth.<br>
<br>In 1807 the Revd William John Jolliffe (1774&#150;1835) replaced his brother in the partnership, which rapidly became a major contractor&#151;probably the largest of the day&#151;for public works, principally of an engineering character, such as embanking Cardiff marshes (1808), erecting a lighthouse at Heligoland, and constructing Rennie's Howth harbour in Dublin Bay (1809&#150;19). More conventional building such as the Croydon court house (1809) and prisoner-of-war accommodation at Princetown, Dartmoor (1809&#150;10), was also undertaken. In 1822 they contracted for the canal and locks which created the port of Goole on the Humber, and also tendered unsuccessfully for Nash's new Royal Mews, Pimlico, which they later completed as assignees of Want and Richardson.<br>
<br>Rennie's knowledge of Banks's efficiency doubtless assisted in gaining the latter a footing in London's rapidly developing enclosed dock system. By submitting what Rennie described as very reasonable competitive tenders, and carrying out excellent work, including state-of-the-art coffer dam techniques, Banks undertook a number of important projects from his yard at Beaufort wharf, Strand. In 1811 Jolliffe and Banks reconstructed the Limehouse entrance to the West India Dock at their own estimate, work by another contractor having collapsed; in 1813 they made good failed piling for a dock at Chetney Hill lazaretto; in 1816 they excavated for the no. 2 rum warehouse at West India Dock; and in 1817 they built a new entrance for London docks, and contracted at a low price for similar work and river walls at Deptford Dockyard. Although theirs was not the lowest tender for a new river wall and wharf at the London custom house in 1817, Rennie recommended them because they had all the required materials in hand as well as pile engines and other machinery from work on Southwark Bridge, &#145;and from their great experience in works of this sort there is the best assurance of its being well and speedily executed&#146;  (Rennie, 9.70). In 1828 the partners built the saltpetre warehouse on the south side of the Blackwall basin, West India Dock, having previously in 1811 rebuilt the outer wing walls of its western Limehouse basin.<br>
<br>Rennie had established himself as the principal bridge builder in the capital, and Jolliffe and Banks became contractors for his granite Waterloo Bridge (1811&#150;17), described by Canova as the noblest bridge in the world, under the new system of lump-sum contracts with a single firm; for the piling, masonry, and centering for Southwark Bridge (1814&#150;19), the largest cast-iron bridge ever built, with a central span of 240 ft; and under the younger Rennie for the new thousand-foot granite London Bridge (1824&#150;31), the smaller but socially conspicuous bridge over the Serpentine, Hyde Park (1821&#150;4), and Staines Bridge which was also of granite. The stoneyard at Millwall was probably laid out specifically for the London Bridge contract, their bridge-building operations having led them to open a trade with Aberdeen (from where they also drew masons) for large blocks of granite, expending &pound;155,000 by 1821. Later they drew supplies from Dartmoor. For building the arches of London Bridge they employed preframed centering ingeniously floated into position, a device sometimes credited to Banks rather than to Rennie.<br>
<br>Jolliffe and Banks were also, with Nicholson of Rochester, employed in a series of excavation, piling, and walling contracts for Rennie's vast Sheerness naval dockyard (1812&#150;30), a &pound;3 million work designed for &#145;the building and equipment of ships of war of the largest dimensions&#146;  (Westall and Owen, 167). Their 1815 contract for tonguing-and-grooving sheet piling proved unremunerative so Rennie invented a machine, executed at their cost, which greatly reduced the expense and performed the work more efficiently. Because they already had on site steam-engines, mortar mills, lime-kilns, railways, and scaffolding, Rennie recommended employing them for a further large contract in 1817 if they would bring down their price to within &pound;2000 of the lowest tender. They failed to do so and were replaced by another contractor, though they subsequently constructed the northern sector, an &pound;850,000 contract. Close by, Banks founded Banks Town (later Sheerness-on-Sea) as a speculation, instituting a tri-weekly service from London by steamboat (built by Jolliffe, Banks &amp; Co.). With Jolliffe, he was a founder of the General Steam Navigation Company (1824).<br>
<br>Another extensive enterprise undertaken by the partners in association with Rennie was the 3 mile Eau Brinck Cut on the Ouse at King's Lynn, 1817&#150;21, to drain 300,000 acres of the Great, or Bedford, Level of the fens, where they executed &pound;40,000 worth of works before receiving any return. This was a labour by which &#145;an immense value has been given to otherwise worthless swamps and wastes&#146;  (Smiles, 169). Similar works executed on the Nene (a new cut of over 5 miles, where they employed about 1300 men, 1827&#150;31), Witham (1828), and Ancholme (1828) were engineered by Telford or the younger Rennie. The partnership was dissolved in 1834, the year before both Banks and Jolliffe died.<br>
<br>Banks lived in Adelphi Terrace, Westminster, and had country properties at Oxney Court, Dover, and Sheppey Court, both in Kent. In 1793 he married Nancy (<i>d</i>. 1815), daughter of John Franklin, with whom he had five sons and three daughters; in 1821 he married Amelia (<i>d</i>. 1836), daughter and coheir of Sir Abraham Pytches of Streatham, and sister of his partner's wife. One of his daughters married Jolliffe's son. There were no children from his second marriage.<br>
<br>Banks was knighted on 12 June 1822 for his skill and perseverance in building Waterloo and Southwark bridges, the first knighthood bestowed on an engineer (the elder Rennie having declined one in 1817). Obituaries remarked on his perseverance, integrity, piety, and benevolence. He died at his daughter's house at Tilgate, Sussex, on 5 July 1835. He was buried in a family grave at Chipstead, Surrey, the beauty of which spot he had observed when working on the Merstham tram road many years earlier.<br>
