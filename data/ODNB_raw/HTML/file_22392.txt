<span class="headword">Plugenet,  Alan (II)  de</span>, first Lord Plugenet  (<em>d.</em> 1298), <span class="occ">baron and royal councillor</span>, was the son of Alan (I) de Plugenet (<i>d</i>. after 1230) and Alice, his wife, daughter of Thomas of Rochford and Isabella de Berkeley. The Plugenets were almost certainly of Breton descent, perhaps native to Planco&euml;t near Dinan, and had first risen to prominence in the mid-twelfth century when Hugh de Plugenet (<i>d</i>. 1200) received the manor of Headington by grant of the Empress Matilda. Hugh married Sibilla, daughter of Josce de Dinan and sister-in-law of the notorious outlaw Fulk (III) Fitzwarine (<i>d</i>. 1258). By 1242 his lands at Lambourn in Berkshire and Westbury in Wiltshire had passed via his sons Alan (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1202) and Josce (<i>d</i>. 1229/30) to William de Plugenet (<i>d</i>. 1257), son of Josce. Through Josce de Dinan and the Fitzwarines the family also enjoyed associations with the Welsh marches and the county of Hereford. Alan (II) de Plugenet's father, Alan (I), was probably a younger son of Josce de Plugenet (<i>d</i>. 1229/30) and held a minor estate at Lambourn. Robert de Plugenet, probably another of Josce's sons, served as deputy sheriff of Wiltshire in 1235&#150;6, and as a leading member of the household of William (II) Longesp&eacute;e (<i>d</i>. 1250), claimant to the earldom of Salisbury.<br>
<br>Alan (II) de Plugenet first appears in 1256, when he was promised an heiress at the behest of his kinsman Robert Walerand (<i>d</i>. 1273), the son of Plugenet's grandmother Isabella de Berkeley by her second marriage. In 1260 he was knighted by the king at Westminster, and in the following year received an annual fee of 20 marks to retain him in royal service. He served throughout the baronial rebellion of the 1260s as a staunch adherent of the king and his son, the Lord Edward. Following the royalist victory at Evesham in 1265 he seized temporary possession of a large number of rebel estates and was appointed constable of Dunster Castle. Through royal favour he was also confirmed in possession of the rebel manor of Haselbury Plucknett in Somerset and granted life custody of the Hampshire forest of Woolmer. In 1269 he received possession of the lands of his kinsman Robert Walerand, centred upon the castle and barony of Kilpeck in the Welsh marches. Following a complicated exchange between Plugenet, Walerand, and Eleanor of Castile, wife of the Lord Edward, Walerand was allowed to draw an annuity from these lands until his death in 1273, after which Plugenet obtained Kilpeck, part of Walerand's estate in southern England, and the royal manors of Piddington in Oxfordshire and Pitney and Wearn in Somerset. As a follower of the Lord Edward, in 1267 Plugenet was appointed keeper of the Isle of Wight and of the royal manor of Gillingham. In 1270 he acted as Edward's deputy sheriff for Somerset and Dorset and as constable of Corfe.<br>
<br>From 1276 onwards Plugenet participated in Edward's Welsh wars, and by 1287 had been appointed one of the king's seneschals for west Wales. As seneschal, he is said to have goaded Rhys ap Maredudd (<i>d</i>. 1292) into rebellion by demanding suit of court from Rhys's men. Following the capture of Rhys's castle of Dryslwyn, Alan was appointed constable, and was engaged over the next two years in the castle's rebuilding and defence. He was summoned to parliament as a baron in 1295, to the king's proposed expedition to Gascony in 1294, and to the wars in Scotland from 1294 until 1298. During the king's expedition to Flanders in 1297, he served as one of the counsellors of Prince Edward, the king's son, and played a conspicuous part in negotiations with the baronial opposition. He died shortly before 25 December 1298, having earlier made gifts to the nuns of Aconbury in Herefordshire. With his wife, Joan (<i>d</i>. 1315), daughter of Andrew Wake of Dowlish in Somerset, he had two children: a son <a href="#cosubject_22393">Alan [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and a daughter Joan, married first to Thomas Corbet (<i>d</i>. before 1295) and second to Henry de Bohun (<i>d</i>. 1314), son and heir of John de Bohun of Haresfield in Gloucestershire, and grandson of Humphrey (IV) de Bohun, earl of Hereford (<i>d</i>. 1275).<br>
<br>Plugenet's son, <a name="cosubject_22393"></a><span class="headword">Alan (III)  de Plugenet</span>, second Lord Plugenet  (<em>d.</em> 1325), <span class="occ">baron</span>, succeeded to his father's lands in 1299 and was knighted in 1306. Between 1300 and his death he was summoned regularly to the king's wars in Scotland and Gascony, and as a baron to parliament. At the death of his mother, Joan, in 1315 he was instructed by John of Droxford, bishop of Bath and Wells, to comply with Joan's wish that she be buried at Sherborne. Sir Alan is said to have made the bishop's messenger eat the letter and wax. He later denied the charge, but admitted that he had commanded the messenger to be so soundly beaten that, in his terror, he ate the letter. Alan (III) de Plugenet died in 1325 and was buried at Abbey Dore in Herefordshire. He and his wife, Sybil, had no children, so that his barony passed to his sister Joan. Joan, who died in 1327 and was buried in the lady chapel of Hereford Cathedral, granted a life interest at Kilpeck to her kinswoman by marriage, Eleanor de Bohun. Most of the Plugenet estate passed thereafter to Richard de la Bere, who claimed descent from Alice, mother of Alan (II) de Plugenet, who had remarried after the death of Alan (I).<br>
