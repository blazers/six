<span class="headword">Temple,  Georgina  Cowper-</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Georgina Tollemache]</span>, Lady Mount-Temple  (1821?&#150;1901), <span class="occ">religious enthusiast</span>, was born on 8 October, probably in 1821 in Ireland, the ninth daughter and twelfth child of Admiral Richard Delap Halliday (1772&#150;1837), who in 1821 assumed the name and arms of Tollemache, and his wife, Elizabeth Stratford (<i>d</i>. 1861), daughter of John, third earl of Aldborough. At the time of Georgina's birth her father was still a serving naval officer. With three brothers and seven surviving sisters she would have felt the stimulation of a full family life and the influence of a religious father of a strong evangelical persuasion. After his death in 1837, Georgina lived quietly in London with her mother at 11 Chesham Place and at Brighton. She was slight of figure and tall, her hair golden brown, with an aquiline nose and light warm grey eyes. She married the Hon. William Francis Cowper (1811&#150;1888) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6515/', "Temple, William Francis Cowper-")</script>], apparent son of the fifth Earl and Countess Cowper, at St George's, Hanover Square, on 21 November 1848; his father was actually almost certainly Lord Palmerston, whom Lady Cowper subsequently married. Her marriage was one of complete happiness, finding in her husband a man sharing her own religious fervour with whom she could join in his philanthropic work. At the start she owned to feeling out of her element, so different was the world of gaiety and brilliance at the Palmerston's Broadlands to the quiet life of faith and prayer at home. In their Curzon Street house, where D. G. Rossetti took exception to rose-garlanded chintzes, the firm of William Morris &amp; Co. was called in when the staircase needed renovation.<br>
<br>John Ruskin was introduced to Mrs Cowper in 1853, having first seen her in Rome in the winter of 1840. In 1863 spiritualism and possibly occult phenomena brought them more intimately together. Ruskin was suffering from the complexity of his obsession for Rose La Touche and found in Mrs Cowper a ready sympathizer, sensitive to a mind in great distress. His letters to his tutelary power during the following decade demonstrate the claims he made on her never-failing loyalty. He called her Phil&eacute;, Egeria, and Isola. He dedicated his second edition of <span class="italic">Sesame and Lilies</span> (1871) to her.<br>
<br>Lady Palmerston died in 1869; Broadlands, inherited by her son, who changed his name to Cowper-Temple, became Georgina's home, the centre of religious activity and philanthropic work, and also a refuge to their many friends. According to Leicester Warren there were no clocks or fixed hours: breakfast when one rose, luncheon when hungry, and dinner on returning home. Mrs Cowper-Temple was a vegetarian and total abstainer. Older now, though still upright and stately, her silvered hair suggested a halo; her eyes seemed those of a mystic while her countenance was one of deep serenity, though Arthur Benson observed that her smile was the sort that comes of having been told daily for many years that your smile is like a sunset or a strain of music. Her long plain dress of black merino worn with a high white mob cap bore resemblance to an abbess of the past. A necklace of little silver cherubs with a tiny ladder was her only ornament, sometimes relieved by a bunch of lilies of the valley at the neck. Giving herself unsparingly for all who came to her, she numbered among her friends not only clergymen, including F. D. Maurice, Charles Kingsley, bishops, and curates, but those from other walks of life, such as Charlotte Yonge, Louisa, Lady Waterford, the George Macdonalds, Louisa, Lady Ashburton, Thomas Carlyle, and Augustus Hare. The first annual religious conference at Broadlands was held in the Orangery and under the cedars in the park in July 1874. Here Mrs Cowper-Temple, as high priestess, found common ground with Quakers, spiritualists, Shakers, budding theosophists, nonconformists, ritualistic curates, and members of the Church Army: all were welcome. Working there on his predella for <span class="italic">Dante's Dream</span>, Rossetti found the company all on the parsonic tack (1876) and made a portrait drawing of his hostess (unlocated).<br>
<br>Georgina's husband was raised to the peerage as Baron Mount-Temple in 1880 and died in 1888. Lady Mount-Temple presented Rossetti's <span class="italic">Beata Beatrix</span> to the National Gallery in memory of her husband. She left Broadlands and their house at 1 Cheyne Walk, moving to no. 9, but living predominantly at Babbacombe Cliff, Torquay, built for them by W. E. Nesfield. Here she died on 17 October 1901 after five weeks' illness. Her funeral took place at Romsey Abbey on 21 October; a window erected to her memory there celebrates her work among the fishermen at Torquay, as does a statue raised in gratitude on Babbacombe Downs. At her death she left almost all her possessions to Mme Juliet Deschamps, whom she had adopted as a child in 1869. Other bequests went to the Church Army and the Victoria Street Society of Protection of Animals from Vivisection. In 1909 Mme Deschamps, who had inherited Rossetti's <span class="italic">Blessed Damozel (Sancta Lilias)</span>, gave it to the Tate Gallery in memory of Georgina Mount-Temple.<br>
