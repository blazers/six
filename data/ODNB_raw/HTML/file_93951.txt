<span class="headword">Nicolson,  Nigel</span>  (1917&#150;2004), <span class="occ">politician, publisher, and author</span>, was born on 19 January 1917 at 182 Ebury Street, London, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35239/', "Sir Harold Nicolson (1886&#150;1968)")</script>, diplomat, politician, and author, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35903/', "Victoria Mary (Vita) Sackville-West (1892&#150;1962)")</script>, poet, novelist, and gardener. His preparatory school was Summerfields, Oxford, and in 1930 he followed his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31500/', "Lionel Benedict (Ben) Nicolson")</script>, the future art historian and editor of the <span class="italic">Burlington Magazine</span>, to Eton College.<br>
<br>In 1930 Nicolson's mother bought an Elizabethan ruin, Sissinghurst Castle, near Cranbrook in Kent. She and Harold Nicolson collaborated on its transformation into a complex family home, and on the ambitious planning and planting of the gardens, which became famous. While devoted to their sons&#151;Nigel was affectionately known as Niggs&#151;and to each other, both Nicolson's parents had numerous affairs with members of their own sex, and spent much time apart. Their intimacy was sustained by an almost daily exchange of letters. The family, like Sissinghurst itself, evolved as a grouping of separate units, which affected Nicolson's mental and emotional formation. Vita was shy and undemonstrative with him, and he rarely intruded upon her in the tower at Sissinghurst where she worked. His father was a far more accessible parent.<br>
<br>From 1935 Nicolson read modern history at Balliol College, Oxford, where he organized a branch of the National Labour Party, of which his father was then a member, and achieved a disappointing third-class degree. Like his father, he flirted briefly with fascism, but on the declaration of war in 1939 took a commission in the Grenadier Guards; his first book was the official history of the Grenadier Guards at war (1949). In 1944 the brigade in which he was a captain fought its way through Italy, reaching Austria on VE-day. His brigade was involved in the handover to the Red Army of anti-Soviet Cossacks and, to Tito, of anti-Tito Yugoslavs. When in 1989 Count Nikolai Tolstoy accused Lord Aldington, who had been staff officer, of consigning the Cossacks and Yugoslavs to an inevitable fate, Nicolson gave evidence in court for Tolstoy, using his own diary notes and confessing to his complicity in the betrayal, while defending Aldington, who won the case, against ultimate responsibility. Nicolson's scrupulous honesty in this distressing affair was emblematic of his moral courage and of his integrity. He was a trustee of the fund established to help the Tolstoy family, bankrupted by legal debts.<br>
<br>After the war Nicolson stood unsuccessfully as a Conservative candidate for West Leicestershire, and then for Falmouth and Camborne, before entering parliament as the member for Bournemouth East and Christchurch in 1952. He was re-elected in 1955. In 1956, characteristically following his conscience, he seconded a Labour private member's bill to abolish capital punishment, and in the same year abstained in a vote of confidence in the government over the Suez crisis. The Bournemouth Conservatives were outraged, and he was ousted in a postal ballot. He retired from the Commons at the election of 1959. In the same year Weidenfeld and Nicolson published Nabokov's <span class="italic">Lolita</span>&#151;against Nicolson's judgement, but with his support. <span class="italic">Lolita</span> was phenomenally successful. Nicolson had co-founded the publishing house with George Weidenfeld in 1949, with the help of family loans. He worked in the firm&#151;full-time only from 1960&#151;until his resignation in 1964, and remained an outside director until it was sold in 1992.<br>
<br>Authorship took over from publishing. After his mother's death in 1962 Nicolson discovered, in a locked Gladstone bag in her tower, her account of her passionate three-year love affair with Violet Trefusis, which began when he was about eighteen months old. This document formed the basis of his bestselling <span class="italic">Portrait of a Marriage</span> (1973), which incurred the bitter disapproval of some members of the family and considerable public controversy. But he felt his mother would have wished it to be published, and presented the story as a hard-won confirmation of the love and commitment that underpinned his parents' unorthodox marriage. In the same year he published <span class="italic">Alex</span>, the biography of Lord Alexander of Tunis. His reputation was reinforced by <span class="italic">Mary Curzon</span>, which won the Whitbread prize for biography in 1977. In the following years he wrote, <i>inter alia</i>, books about Fanny Burney, Napoleon, and Jane Austen. He was a lucid, vigorous writer, without stylistic mannerisms. A convinced European, he spoke French, Italian, and German.<br>
<br>The love of Nicolson's early life was Shirley Morgan, daughter of the novelist Charles Morgan. She married the marquess of Anglesey in 1948, but they remained lifelong friends. On 30 July 1953 he married Philippa Janet Tennyson-d'Eyncourt (1928&#150;1987), daughter of Sir Eustace Gervais Tennyson-d'Eyncourt, second baronet, who shared with him at Sissinghurst the care of his widowed father in his last illness. They were divorced in 1970. She later married Sir Robin McAlpine. Nicolson remained extremely close to their three children, Juliet, Adam, and Rebecca. Although he became fond of several distinguished and attractive women, he did not marry again.<br>
<br>Sissinghurst was transferred to the National Trust in 1967, with the family retaining the right to live in a generous part of it. There Nicolson was a modest, hospitable host. He enjoyed the popularity and prestige of the famous garden&#151;though no gardener himself&#151;and was supremely courteous in his reception of interested visitors and of countless students, biographers, and scholars. Tall and lean, constantly with a cigarette until his last years, he cut an elegant figure at London parties, but was essentially diffident and a loner. He did not inherit his parents' predilection for smart society, though by virtue of who he was, and of his unassuming and charming demeanour, he had every access to it. As a young man, he acquired three uninhabited Hebridean islands, the Shiants, as a haven of solitude, which he passed on to his son.<br>
<br>Like his parents Nicolson was a copious letter writer, and like them he kept diaries. In order to offset the expenses of his father's illness he edited his father's letters and diaries in three volumes (1966&#150;8) and, later, his parents' correspondence (<span class="italic">Vita and Harold: the Letters of Vita Sackville-West and Harold Nicolson</span>, 1992). For years, before the originals were sold to American universities, he lived surrounded by his parents' letters and diaries, just as, seemingly, he lived in their shadow as their son. He chose to see this not as a disadvantage or a burden, but as a privilege and a fortunate legacy. His parents and their circle, including the Bloomsbury group, became his main subject and he edited, with Joanne Trautmann, <span class="italic">The Letters of Virginia Woolf</span> in six volumes (1975&#150;80). He was an immaculate and ingenious editor. Woolf, whom he had known since childhood as the intimate friend of his mother, was the frequent subject of Nicolson's successful public lectures worldwide. He published a short biography of her in 2000, and a one-volume edition of his father's diaries in the last year of his life.<br>
<br>In his later years Nicolson wrote a regular column, &#145;Long life&#146;, for the <span class="italic">Spectator</span> magazine, and another, &#145;Time of my life&#146;, for the <span class="italic">Sunday Telegraph</span>. His autobiography, <span class="italic">Long Life</span>, was published in 1997. He was appointed MBE in 1946 and OBE in 2000, and was a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. His father had longed, in vain, for a peerage; by a chance of genealogy, Nicolson became heir presumptive to his grandfather's barony of Carnock, an expectation that passed to his son Adam. He had been suffering from myelodysplastic syndrome and died at Sissinghurst Castle, Cranbrook, on 23 September 2004; he was survived by his three children.<br>
