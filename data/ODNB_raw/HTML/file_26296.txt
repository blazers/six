<span class="headword">Stapeldon,  Walter</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1265, <em>d.</em> 1326), <span class="occ">administrator and bishop of Exeter</span>, was born on 1 February in a year no later than 1265, the son of William and Mabel Stapeldon of Stapeldon near Cookbury in north-west Devon. There is no evidence of noble ancestry. His elder brother Richard held the manor of Stapeldon and sat in parliament, and there were two other brothers and three sisters. Walter Stapeldon was educated at Oxford and first occurs as <i>magister</i> in July 1286. He appears as rector of Aveton Gifford in September 1294. By 1298 he owned property in the city of Exeter, of which he was admitted a freeman in January 1300. He had become the official of Bishop Thomas Bytton of Exeter in August 1300, while by 1301 he was a cathedral canon, and by 1305 precentor. In April 1306, moreover, he incepted as doctor of canon and civil law, a degree that helped to qualify him for royal, and especially diplomatic, employment; in June 1306 he received protection for royal service in Gascony, probably in connection with the investiture of the prince of Wales with the duchy of Aquitaine.<br>
<br>Following Bytton's death on 21 September 1307 Stapeldon was elected by the cathedral chapter on 13 November by fifteen votes to eight. He would appear to have owed his elevation primarily to his local connections. Royal assent was obtained on 3 December, but the election was challenged by Richard Plympstoke, an old enemy, who took his case to the Roman curia. Plympstoke withdrew his appeal in January 1308, and on 16 March the king released the temporalities. But Plympstoke then sued for admission as archdeacon of Exeter. Stapeldon refused. The case was dismissed in king's bench in July, but not before the bishop-elect had incurred considerable expense. He was consecrated at Canterbury on 13 October and enthroned at Exeter early in December.<br>
<br>Stapeldon's legal training made him useful in government. He regularly attended parliament, missing none between 1313 and his death, and was auditor of Gascon petitions there in February 1316 and October 1318. He was appointed to a mission to Gascony in 1310 and as a royal nuncio to the Council of Vienne in 1311. Although nothing came of either, he was subsequently employed on missions to France, usually relating to Gascony, in 1313, 1315, 1316, and 1319; and in 1318 he was sent to the Low Countries, possibly (among other things) to canvass the marriage of Philippa of Hainault to the future Edward III. Such work may have been the spur to the creation of the calendar of principally diplomatic documents that was compiled during his treasurership and that bears his name. It also brought him valuable contacts at court. In 1310, at Gaveston's request, he was excused service in Scotland. A cluster of relatively small grants followed in 1311. In 1315 he was appointed to the king's council and distributed patronage among his fellow administrators in a manner that suggests he was becoming a man of influence. He was present at the meetings in 1317 that led to a breach between Thomas of Lancaster (<i>d</i>. 1322) and the court, but took no part in negotiations preceding the treaty of Leake in August 1318.<br>
<br>Stapeldon's appointment as treasurer on 18 February 1320 was part of a reorganization of government; in January John Salmon (<i>d</i>. 1325), bishop of Norwich, had been appointed chancellor and Robert Baldock (<i>d</i>. 1327) keeper of the privy seal. All three appointments were made outside of parliament, in contravention of the ordinances of 1311, Stapeldon's being unequivocally &#145;by the king&#146;. He accompanied the king to France in June 1320, and at the Westminster parliament in October obtained a number of favours. He was one of ten bishops who tried to make peace between the king and those barons who insisted on the exile of the Despensers in the summer of 1321. After the exile had been pronounced, he retired from the treasurership&#151;which was transferred to Walter Norwich (<i>d</i>. 1329)&#151;on 25 August and returned to his diocese. He did not approve of the Despensers' exile but, in a remarkable correspondence early in 1322, he counselled the king that, since it had been imposed during parliament, it ought only to be revoked in like manner. Edward II replied, expressing irritation that the bishop of whose support he had felt most assured should have responded to him in such a manner, and summoned Stapeldon to his presence. After the royal victory at Boroughbridge on 16 March 1322 the Despensers' exile was revoked by statute at the York parliament in May. On 9 May Stapeldon was reappointed treasurer, and remained in the king's service thereafter. There followed the abortive Scottish campaign of 1322; Stapeldon participated in the negotiations that led to a thirteen-year truce in May 1323. After the escape of Roger Mortimer from the Tower of London in August he held the post of constable until the following November. Stapeldon was already at work on the government records stored in the Tower, a consideration which, added to his political reliability, doubtless explains his appointment to this position.<br>
<br>The pressures of civil war, war in Scotland, and the War of St Sardos in Gascony ensured that Stapeldon's treasurership saw considerable intensification of the government's efforts to increase its revenue. With this end in view a huge sortation of records was undertaken. The stringent auditing of accounts was hastened; and debts, some of them dating back more than a century, were called in. The Cowick and Westminster ordinances of June 1323 and May 1324 represent major initiatives in these areas, but they were not the only ones. The king frequently demonstrated impatience at the pace of reform, which may account for the scheme of June 1324 to divide the exchequer's administration that is associated with the name of Roger Beler (<i>d</i>. 1326). Stapeldon first opposed the scheme, then delayed its implementation, and was roundly reproved by the king. This may explain why in July he was sent to supervise preparations in his diocese for the War of St Sardos. In September 1324 Queen Isabella's lands in the south-west, the bulk of which lay in Stapeldon's diocese, were seized, soon to be followed by those of all French aliens. The queen's humiliation (she was reduced to a meagre allowance) may account for her subsequent hostility towards Stapeldon.<br>
<br>Stapeldon was replaced as treasurer on 3 July 1325 during parliament. The <span class="italic">Vita Edwardi secundi</span>, a contemporary source, accusing him of avarice, alleges that this was to allow those wronged by him to bring writs against him. But it may also be that he was being released in order to accompany the prince of Wales, who was being sent to do homage to the new French king, Charles IV, on behalf of his father. This mission materialized in September but, perceiving conspiracy at the French court, Stapeldon fled, leaving the young prince and his mother; he had returned to England by 29 October. He preached at the opening of parliament in the Tower of London on 18 November. In December Queen Isabella wrote to Stapeldon, excoriating him for returning home without paying her household, and attributing his treatment of her to his complicity with the younger Hugh Despenser (<i>d</i>. 1326). With an invasion now imminent Stapeldon devoted himself to the defence of the south-west, although, following the murder of Roger Beler in January 1326 he was also again closely involved in exchequer business. After the queen's invasion in September he returned to London, where his association with the Despenser regime and his possible responsibility for the eyre of 1321, which had been aggressively hostile to the privileges claimed by the city, may have made him especially unpopular. There his house was looted and burned, and he himself was set upon, lynched, and decapitated in Cheapside with a breadknife on 15 October. His head was sent to the queen; his body was eventually returned, on her orders, to Exeter Cathedral, where it was buried on the north side of the high altar on 28 March 1327.<br>
<br>The location of his tomb marks Stapeldon out as virtually the cathedral's second founder. He not only contributed enormous sums to its rebuilding, but his first episcopal statute (1310) obliged all beneficed clergy of the diocese to do likewise. Despite government business, he was a vigorous diocesan bishop, who undertook frequent visitations and enhanced considerably the value of episcopal property. He engaged strenuously in litigation to contest royal claims that the collegiate church of St Buryan in Cornwall was a royal free chapel, while simultaneously asserting his own rights as dean of the royal free chapel of Bosham in the diocese of Chichester.<br>
<br>Stapeldon's interests extended to scholarship, and he actively promoted learning. In 1326 he set in train plans to endow grammar scholarships at St John's Hospital in Exeter. He granted the highest known rate of licences of non-residence to study issued by any of Edward II's bishops. But his most notable achievement was the foundation in 1314 of Stapeldon Hall in Oxford for a priest and twelve poor scholars from his diocese. He was visitor of the foundation and in 1316 provided it with its first statutes, a distinctive feature of which was the democratic election of new fellows and of the rector by existing fellows. The foundation survives today as Exeter College, Oxford.<br>
