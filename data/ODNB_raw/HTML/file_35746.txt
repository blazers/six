</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ricketts,  Charles de Sousy</span>  (1866&#150;1931), <span class="occ">artist and art collector</span>, was born on 2 October 1866 at Maison Turretine, Grand Quai, Geneva, Switzerland, the only son of Charles Robert Ricketts (1838&#150;1883), a retired English naval officer, and H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Corn&eacute;lie de Soucy (1833/4&#150;1880), daughter of Louis, marquis de Soucy. His mother was musical; his father, a painter of marine subjects. Ricketts spent his infancy in Lausanne and London, and his youth at Boulogne and Amiens in France, and was educated by governesses, except for a year at a French boarding-school near Tours. After his mother's death at Genoa in 1880, Ricketts, hardly able to speak English, returned to London with his father and his younger sister Blanche (1868&#150;1903). Too delicate to attend school, he spent the next two years reading voraciously and &#145;basking&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>) in museums; he thus escaped being moulded along conventional lines. In 1882 he entered the City and Guilds Art School in Kennington, London, where he was apprenticed to Charles Roberts, a prominent wood-engraver. A year later his father died, and Ricketts lived on a quarterly allowance of &pound;25 from his grandfather, Edmund Woodville Ricketts (1808&#150;1895). On his sixteenth birthday he met his lifelong partner, the painter and lithographer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36038/', "Charles Haslewood Shannon (1863&#150;1937)")</script>.<br>
<br>Ricketts and Shannon founded an occasional art journal, <span class="italic">The Dial</span> (1889&#150;1897), which promoted a blend of English Pre-Raphaelitism and French symbolism, reflecting Ricketts's origins. The two artists also began designing and illustrating books, including <span class="italic">Daphnis and Chloe</span> (1893) and <span class="italic">Hero and Leander</span> (1894), which were unique in that the designs were cut by the artists who drew them, rather than by a professional engraver. Ricketts also worked for commercial publishers, designing books in an art nouveau style: his most famous were John Gray's <span class="italic">Silverpoints</span> (1893) and Oscar Wilde's <span class="italic">The Sphinx</span> (1895).<br>
<br>Meeting a wealthy barrister, Llewellyn Hacon, enabled Ricketts to realize his dream of being a publisher and he set up the Vale Press in 1894. An inheritance of &pound;500 from his grandfather in 1895 was invested in it. For over eighty volumes, mostly reprints of English poetic classics, he designed three fonts and numerous decorations and illustrations. Although influenced by the aesthetic movement and by William Morris, whom he admired, his books are more classical than medieval in style. After a fire destroyed his stock and decorative material in 1899, he lost interest in publishing and closed the press with his <span class="italic">Bibliography of the Vale Press</span> (1904). Afterwards he designed books for friends such as Katherine Harris and Emma Cooper (who collaborated under the pseudonym Michael Field), and Gordon Bottomley.<br>
<br>Ricketts had already taken up painting and sculpture. Thomas Lowinsky points out how &#145;his books expressed in their pre-Raphaelitism the English side of his character, whilst his pictures, with their debt to Delacroix and Gustave Moreau, the French&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). In the Symbolist tradition, his themes are tragic and romantic, and they focused on key moments in the destiny of his subjects, such as Salome, Cleopatra, Don Juan, Montezuma, and (though Ricketts was a non-believer) Christ, figures he admired for the way they courageously met their fates. Among his best paintings are <span class="italic">The Betrayal of Christ</span> (1904, Carlisle Museum and Art Gallery), <span class="italic">Don Juan and the Statue</span> (1905), <span class="italic">The Death of Don Juan</span> (1911, Tate collection), <span class="italic">Bacchus in India</span> (<i>c</i>.1913, Atkinson Art Gallery, Southport, Cheshire), <span class="italic">The Wise and Foolish Virgins</span> (<i>c</i>.1913, priv. coll.), <span class="italic">The Death of Montezuma</span> (<i>c</i>.1915, priv. coll.), <span class="italic">The Return of Judith</span> (1919), and <span class="italic">Jepthah's Daughter</span> (1924, Ashmolean Museum, Oxford). His great scholarship often inhibited his painting, before which he was often hesitant, and some paintings are overworked. His twenty or so sculptures, one of which, <span class="italic">Silence</span>, was a memorial to Oscar Wilde, are indebted to Rodin's smaller works. Bronzes such as <span class="italic">Orpheus and Eurydice</span> (Tate collection) and <span class="italic">Paolo and Francesca</span> (Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge) are powerful interpretations of their themes. In 1922 he was elected ARA and in 1928 RA.<br>
<br>In his lifetime Ricketts was probably best-known for his theatre designs. Here, his spontaneity, his sense of design and colour, and his understanding of the theatre united in harmony. His gift for linear arabesque, evident in his book illustrations, is also shown in the finished watercolours he drew from his designs. Among his most important productions were the first English production of Wilde's <span class="italic">Salom&eacute;</span> (1906), which was boycotted by the press; Shakespeare's <span class="italic">King Lear</span> (1909); W. B. Yeats's <span class="italic">The King's Threshold</span> (1914); Bernard Shaw's <span class="italic">Don Juan in Hell</span> (1907) and <span class="italic">Dark Lady of the Sonnets</span> (1909); John Masefield's <span class="italic">Philip the King</span> (1914) and <span class="italic">The Coming of Christ</span> (1928), the success of which initiated the Canterbury festival plays; the D'Oyly Carte Company's production of <span class="italic">The Mikado</span> (1926); the first production of Shaw's <span class="italic">Saint Joan</span> (1924), probably his greatest achievement; and Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Henry VIII</span> (1925). He did theatre work with gusto, often staying up all night to do the designs. The largest public collection of his designs is in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.<br>
<br>Ricketts's great connoisseurship led to his being offered the directorship of the National Gallery in London, which he refused (and regretted later), to his acting as art adviser to the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa (1924&#150;31), and to his forming with Shannon a fine collection of French, English, and old master drawings and paintings, Greek and Egyptian antiquities, Persian miniatures, and Japanese prints and drawings. Never well off, they had in the early days made sacrifices to build their collection, which was left to museums, mainly the Fitzwilliam in Cambridge. Ricketts wrote <span class="italic">The Prado and its Masterpieces</span> (1903) and <span class="italic">Titian</span> (1910) which, though superseded by modern scholarship, remain among the most evocative books on art in English, and <span class="italic">Pages on Art</span> (1913), a selection of his articles. He also wrote and designed two collections of short stories, <span class="italic">Beyond the Threshold</span> (1928) and <span class="italic">Unrecorded Histories</span> (1933), as well as <span class="italic">Recollections of Oscar Wilde</span> (1932), his memoir of the man he considered the most remarkable he had met.<br>
<br>Ricketts's last years were overshadowed by the illness and hostility of Shannon, whose brain was damaged in a fall in 1929. For once, his aesthetic values took second place, and to pay for Shannon's care he sold the Persian drawings for &pound;4000. The strain of the situation and of overwork to escape it contributed to his death from angina pectoris at his home, Townshend House, Albert Road, Regent's Park, London, on 7 October 1931, six years before his partner. A memorial service was held at St James's, Piccadilly, on 12 October, after which he was cremated; his ashes were scattered in Richmond Park, London, and the remainder buried at Arolo, Lake Maggiore, Italy. His estate was valued for probate at &pound;36,283.<br>
<br>Small in stature, Ricketts was &#145;a man of masterful personality&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>) and loved to influence people. He could be touchy and belligerent, and was implacably opposed to &#145;modern art&#146; and especially to the influence of C&eacute;zanne. He was witty and a brilliant conversationalist. Although his quick mind and vivacity seemed more French than English, he resided in London. He lived entirely for art, not only for creating, collecting, or writing about it, but also for music and literature, which he read in five languages. When he travelled in Italy, Spain, Greece, Egypt, Tunisia, the USA, Canada, and other countries, it was to study or promote art. Shaw described him as &#145;the noble and generous Ricketts, who always dealt <i>en grand seigneur</i>, a natural aristocrat as well as a loyal and devoted artist&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>There is a drawing (1899) and an oil painting (1898) of Ricketts by Shannon in the National Portrait Gallery, London, as well as a head (<i>c</i>.1920s) by Laura Anning Bell. A bust (1902) by Reginald Wells is a good likeness. In 1979 his work was exhibited in &#145;Charles Ricketts and Charles Shannon: an Aesthetic Partnership&#146; at the Orleans House Gallery, Twickenham, London.<br>
