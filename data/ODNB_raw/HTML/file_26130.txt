<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Spencer, Sir  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1610), <span class="occ">merchant and lord mayor of London</span>, was the son of Richard Spencer of Waldingfield in Suffolk, but details of his family background and early years are not known. There is no record of his London apprenticeship or freedom, but he entered the livery of the Clothworkers' Company in 1570. By that date he was already a successful merchant trading to Spain, importing raisins, oil, iron, and wine. He was among the founder members of the Spanish Company in 1577, and a pioneer, with fellow clothworkers Sir Edward Osborne and Richard Staper, of the Levant trade (chartered from 1582). Dizzying fortunes could be made in the exchange of cloth, rabbit skins, and tin for the spices, dyestuffs, cotton wool, and silks of the Levant, but Spencer was in the forefront of those anxious to limit membership of the company in the 1590s. In 1599 he was one of the leading investors in the East India Company. In later years he seems to have turned to moneylending, counting the crown and the earls of Essex and Northumberland among his creditors. His subsidy assessments (&pound;300 in the 1570s, &pound;410 in 1589) placed him at the pinnacle of the city's pyramid of wealth, and at his death his estate was variously (and implausibly) estimated at between &pound;300,000 and &pound;800,000. His wealth was legendary. An unsubstantiated mid-seventeenth-century account records a plot by Dunkirk pirates to kidnap and ransom him, only foiled by his being detained in the city on business. Although he was regarded as parsimonious (a libel circulating after his death alleged that he &#145;spent by the dramme and laid up by the pound&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Ashmole 781, p. 152), he lived in some style. From the sons of William Bond (<i>d</i>. 1576) he purchased Crosby Place in Bishopsgate, a late fifteenth-century mansion described by Stow as very large and beautiful. Although Spencer kept his mayoralty at Crosby Place, and spent large amounts on it, he does not seem to have resided there in his later years, and it was regularly used to house visiting foreign dignitaries. His preferred residence was at Canonbury in Islington, purchased from Lord Wentworth for &pound;2000. The surviving long gallery (still <i>in situ</i>, with a plaster ceiling dated 1599 decorated with medallions of classical heroes) and three of the chimney-pieces (removed in 1865 to Compton Wynyates and Castle Ashby) show him to have been a man of some taste.<br>
<br>Spencer was a difficult man who, although attaining the highest offices, clearly lacked enthusiasm for his civic obligations, and he proved a truculent colleague. As a junior liveryman of his company he repeatedly refused to serve as steward for the lord mayor's feast and, unusually for a man of his standing, he never served as master of his livery company, refusing the office when elected in 1580. He was a common councillor for Bishopsgate ward between 1576 and 1583, and was elected to the court of aldermen on 27 June 1583, serving successively in the wards of Bridge Without (1583&#150;7), Langbourn (1587&#150;94), and Bassishaw (1594&#150;1610). He was sheriff of London in 1583&#150;4 (but only after having been nominated three times) and lord mayor in 1594&#150;5. His mayoralty took place in the difficult circumstances of the social distress caused by escalating prices, heavy wartime taxation, and trade disruptions. But the situation seems to have been aggravated by his noxious personality. He was at loggerheads with his fellow aldermen over patronage matters, and rumours of his corruption circulated widely. Unusually for the sixteenth century when the lord mayor usually took a mediatorial role in popular disturbances, his character was an issue in the apprentice riots of June 1595. Libels circulated comparing him unfavourably with another alderman, Sir Richard Martin, and it was rumoured that apprentices had set up a gallows outside his house. So great was his loss of control that martial law was humiliatingly imposed by the privy council on the city in July. Although reports of Spencer's partiality had reached the crown's ministers, they did not endanger the customary knighthood, bestowed on the lord mayor at some point between 27 May and 13 June 1595.<br>
<br>Spencer married Alice (<i>d</i>. 1610), daughter of Thomas Bromfield of London and widow successively of Henry Leake (<i>d</i>. 1563), a wealthy Southwark brewer, and of William Cockes, citizen and haberdasher of London (<i>d</i>. 1569). Their only surviving offspring was a daughter, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1632), who became a target for fortune-hunters such as Spencer's colleague on the aldermanic bench Anthony Ratcliffe. Spencer saw him off with little difficulty but the heavily indebted William Compton, Lord Compton and later earl of Northampton (<i>c</i>.1570&#150;1630), proved a more serious challenge. By January 1599 it was widely reported that they were to marry but that Spencer was doing all in his power to hinder the match, hiding Elizabeth and alleging a precontract with Sir Arthur Heveningham. Spencer was committed briefly to the Fleet prison and on his release his daughter was taken out of his care, allegedly because of his cruelty. The marriage took place shortly after 15 March 1599. The bitterness between Spencer and his feckless son-in-law intensified when Compton delivered a spectacular snub to the merchant at a tournament in the queen's presence soon after the wedding. In spite of the efforts of Sir Robert Cecil (and possibly even the queen) to mediate, Spencer &#145;the hardhead&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 1.124) remained obdurate, even when his daughter gave birth to a son in 1601.<br>
<br>Spencer died in the parish of St Helen, Bishopsgate, on 3 March 1610, followed a few weeks later by his wife. He was buried in St Helen's Church on 22 March. Given that there are no indications that he was reconciled with his son-in-law, who continued his improvident lifestyle after the marriage, it is difficult to understand why he died intestate, his estate thereby passing to Compton. This was a stroke of good fortune so extraordinary as to turn Compton's wits. After a brief orgy of conspicuous consumption, he was &#145;oppressed with the greatnes of his sudaine fortune [and] fell madde&#146;  (<span class="italic">Abergavenny MSS</span>, 83&#150;4), apparently necessitating a brief spell in the Tower. It was in fact alleged by Spencer's nephews in a Star Chamber lawsuit that Compton had suppressed the will, and they had the testimony of Sir Henry Montague, the recorder of London, in their favour. The sad episode perhaps contributed to Spencer's reputation for avarice, for there were no charitable bequests. And yet contemporaries were impressed by the extraordinary largess to the poor at his funeral on 22 March 1610 (conscience money from Compton or a sign of Spencer's more conventionally charitable instincts?), and it was rumoured that the suppressed will contained bequests to his poor kindred amounting to &pound;20,000 and as much again to charities. Spencer's was unquestionably one of the most controversial sixteenth-century mercantile careers, but his reputation as the &#145;old usurer&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 14/53/107) may have been exploited by his unscrupulous son-in-law to further his own ends.<br>
