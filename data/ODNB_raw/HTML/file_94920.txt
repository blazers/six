<span class="headword">Walker,  George Patrick Leonard</span>  (1926&#150;2005), <span class="occ">geologist and vulcanologist</span>, was born on 2 March 1926 at 24 Cecil Road, Harlesden, Middlesex, the son of Leonard Thomas Richard Walker, dynamo tester, and later farmer, and his wife, Eveline Frances, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McConkey. Brought up in London and then Northern Ireland, he became fascinated as a teenager by geology and the minerals in the lavas of Antrim. He was educated at Wallace High School, Lisburn. Following BSc and MSc degrees in geology at Queen's University, Belfast, from 1948 he studied zeolite mineralogy in ancient basalt lava sequences for his PhD degree at Leeds University, eventually awarded in 1956. He was appointed an assistant lecturer at Imperial College, London, in 1951, becoming lecturer in 1954 and reader in 1964. On 22 March 1958 he married Hazel Rosemary Smith, a 28-year-old nursery nurse, and daughter of Walter Smith, farmer. They had a daughter, Alison, and a son, Leonard.<br>
<br>Walker used his knowledge of zeolites brilliantly in his seminal studies of the geology of eastern Iceland, where he displayed his flair as a field geologist, and his ability to make critical observations and make fundamental inferences about volcanic processes. He mapped the lavas and zeolite zones, and the geological structure of a large part of the east coast of Iceland, showing that the distribution of the zeolite minerals was systematically related to the depth of burial of the lavas. From these observations he inferred the processes that formed Iceland. This work was one of the first studies to gather geological evidence for sea-floor spreading at the inception of the theory of plate tectonics. His research revolutionized understanding of the geology of Iceland and in 1980 Walker was one of the few foreign citizens to be awarded the Icelandic order of the Falcon, conferred by the president of Iceland. He also received an honorary doctorate from the University of Iceland in 1988.<br>
<br>In the late 1960s and through the 1970s Walker increasingly focused on volcanic eruptions and geological studies of young active volcanoes. He combined supreme observational skills with a remarkable ability to integrate apparently unconnected observations into coherent conceptual models that gave powerful new insights into how volcanoes worked. He adopted a quantitative approach of gathering prodigious quantities of systematic data, and using his imaginative powers and intuition to extract major advances in understanding. His work was the foundation of much later understanding in vulcanology. He played a major role in turning vulcanology from a qualitative and descriptive enterprise to a robust and quantitative science. Among his many achievements in this period were finding the controls on lava flow emplacement, elucidating the relationships between the geology of pyroclastic deposits and the explosive eruptions that formed them, advancing understanding of what controls the morphology of volcanoes, and establishing new ways to assess volcanic hazards.<br>
<br>In 1978 Walker took up a Captain James Cook research fellowship of the Royal Society of New Zealand, based at the University of Auckland. There he devoted his energy to studying the young explosive vulcanism of the North Island, centred on Lake Taupo, which he recognized as a volcano of remarkable violence. In 1981 he was appointed as the first Gordon Macdonald chair in vulcanology at the University of Hawaii, where he continued his highly innovative research, focusing on the evolution of basaltic volcanoes and the dynamics of basalt lava flows. He retired in 1996 and returned to the UK to live in Gloucester, but continued his research as a visiting professor at Bristol University. His achievements were recognized by many awards, including election as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1975, an honorary fellowship of the Royal Society of New Zealand in 1987, the Thorarinsson medal (the highest award in vulcanology) in 1989, and the Wollaston medal of the Geological Society of London in 1995.<br>
<br>Walker was a brilliant teacher and devoted much of his time to encouraging and nurturing young scientists. His first love was for field geology and he was inspirational when showing students how to read the rocks on field classes, or training graduate students how to extract the secrets of nature by simple systematic observations and logical deduction. He was supremely fit and could see off most students in marches across Scottish mountains or to volcanoes in exotic and remote places. An extended line of exhausted but still enthusiastic students or colleagues as the sun set was a common feature of his field trips. In Hawaii he gave countless presentations to schools and community groups. He helped and encouraged many scientists from the developing world, where most active volcanoes are located. He inspired thousands of people, from primary school children to eminent professors.<br>
<br>Walker never sought the limelight. He was at his happiest in the field in remote parts of the world. He was devoted to geology and much of his work was done on a shoestring budget, sometimes also at his own expense. His contributions to science were seminal and far-reaching, and he was remembered with admiration and great affection by everyone who crossed his path. He was a devoted husband and father. He died on 17 January 2005 at Woodstock Nursing Home, 35 Upton Lane, Barnwood, Gloucester. He was survived by his wife, Hazel, and their two children.<br>
