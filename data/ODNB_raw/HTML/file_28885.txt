<span class="headword">Watts,  Gilbert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1657), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and translator</span>, was born, reportedly, at Rotherham, Yorkshire, the second son of Richard Watts and his wife, Isabel, daughter of Arthur Alcock of St Martin Vintry, London, and widow of Richard's cousin Thomas Scott of Barnes Hall, Ecclesfield, Yorkshire. From about 1607 Watts kept some terms at Cambridge and after moving to Lincoln College, Oxford, was allowed, on 10 October 1610, to count them towards his BA, taken on 28 January 1611. As founder's kin to Thomas Rotherham he was elected a fellow of Lincoln on 9 November 1611, proceeding MA on 7 July 1614 and BD on 10 July 1623. Watts was put out of commons for six months on 6 May 1625 for &#145;being sixe severall nights in the towne&#146;; on 19 December 1629 part of a book he wrote &#145;redounding to the scandal and discredit of the College&#146; was ordered to be burnt; he was &#145;divers times distempered in drink&#146; and in chapel told the rector he &#145;spake like a mouse in a cheese&#146;  (Green, 184).<br>
<br>Watts was, however, a notable scholar and &#145;a Master of so smooth a Pen, whether in <i>Lat.</i> or <i>English</i>, that no Man of his time exceeded him&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.212). His English version, published in 1640, of Bacon's <span class="italic">De augmentis scientiarum</span> had several printings. Unfortunately a rival translation of Davila's history of the French civil wars prevented his being published. He catalogued Charles I's works (including proclamations), as groundwork for a projected book called &#145;Imperiale politiques&#146;  (Oxford, Corpus Christi College, MS 326).<br>
<br>When Charles was visiting Oxford, on 1 November 1642, Watts was created DD. His rectory of Willingdale Doe, Essex, held since 1621, was sequestered some time before 9 October 1646. He petitioned the committee for plundered ministers, which on 11 August 1647 asked the county committee to certify the cause of sequestration. Watts lost his suit against the next incumbent but, having pleaded great poverty, was recommended on 26 September 1649 to be discharged without paying fees. In 1653 Lincoln gave him leave of absence because of his &#145;age and poverty&#146;  (Green, 185). Watts died at Eynsham, Oxfordshire, on 9 September 1657, while returning from Bath, &#145;where he had overcome his antient Body by too much sweating&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.213); he was buried in Lincoln's chancel of All Saints' Church, Oxford. His will, dated 5 September that year, left Lincoln &#145;soe many Bookes as cost mee Threescore pounds&#146;, each fellow one book, and his brother Abraham the residue of his estate  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/270, fols. 81<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>).<br>
