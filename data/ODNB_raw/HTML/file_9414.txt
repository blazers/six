<span class="headword">Fiennes,  Thomas</span>, ninth Baron Dacre  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1516, <em>d.</em> 1541), <span class="occ">nobleman and murderer</span>, was the son and heir of Sir Thomas Fiennes and Jane (<i>d</i>. 1539), daughter of Edward Sutton, Lord Dudley. He succeeded his grandfather Thomas, eighth Lord Dacre, in 1533, his father having died on 26 October 1528. The principal seat of this southern branch of the Dacre family was at Herstmonceux, Sussex. In 1536 he married Mary, daughter of George Neville, Lord Bergavenny; she probably died in 1576. Despite his youth on joining the peerage (he was said to be eighteen or more in 1534), Dacre was soon called upon to meet the responsibilities to which his rank committed him. In May 1536 he was included in the jury which tried Anne Boleyn, and five months later he was ordered to attend the king with 200 soldiers as part of the force to be dispatched against the uprising in Yorkshire. Although he was not required to march against the rebels, he was one of the jury which tried Thomas, Lord Darcy, and John, Lord Hussey, in May 1537. Dacre attended the baptism of Prince Edward in October 1537, and bore the canopy at Queen Jane's funeral the month following. He was also among those lords who greeted Anne of Cleves at Rainham Down on new year's eve 1539.<br>
<br>Dacre's career was ended prematurely by an ill-advised hunting trip. On 30 April 1541 he led a party on a poaching expedition to Nicholas Pelham's estates at Laughton, Sussex. While pursuing their prey they encountered a group of Pelham's servants, one of whom was fatally injured in the ensuing scuffle. Dacre and his companions were charged with murder and tried at the court of king's bench on 27 June. Dacre originally entered a plea of not guilty to the charge of wilful murder, but was later induced to change it to guilty and throw himself upon the king's mercy. Despite the intercession of the council on Dacre's behalf the king refused to grant him a reprieve. His execution by hanging took place two days later, on 29 June 1541; a brief account of the execution can be found in Hall's <span class="italic">Chronicle</span>: &#145;he was led on foot between the two sheriffs of London from the Tower through the city to Tyburn where he was strangled as common murderers are and his body buried in the church of St Selpulchre&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hall's Chronicle</span>, 842). Although Dacre's fate has previously been used as an example of Henry's growing intolerance and brutality, the sentence was just: as Miller has pointed out, the baron was indisputably an accessory to murder, the punishment for which was death. Dacre left two sons: Thomas, who died aged fifteen in 1553, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9410/', "Gregory Fiennes, tenth baron Dacre")</script>, who was restored to the lands and title of his father in 1558.<br>
