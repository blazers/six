<span class="headword">Davies, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1631/2&#150;1680), <span class="occ">bookseller and lord mayor of London</span>, was born between March 1631 and February 1632, one of the five children of John Davies (<i>d</i>. 1652) of Old Jewry in the City of London, merchant adventurer and member of the Drapers' Company, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1665), daughter and heiress of Stephen Pecock and his wife, Elizabeth, sister of the &#145;infinitely rich&#146; Hugh Audley. His grandfather was a Leicestershire man. Educated at St Paul's School, Davies was apprenticed to a bookseller in April 1648 and to his father in November 1648. The latter apprenticeship was probably a formality; John Davies died in a debtors' prison four years later, and Thomas was made free of the Stationers' Company in April 1655. He set up as a bookseller at the Sign of the Bible, St Paul's Churchyard, and entered into several joint publishing agreements between 1656 and 1662, apparently specializing in books in or translated from French and Latin. In 1662, Hugh Audley, who had made and changed a number of testamentary dispositions, finally gave his valuable property in Middlesex to Thomas and his brother Alexander Davies, and made Thomas one of his executors and residuary legatees. Alexander bought Thomas's share of the Middlesex land, and died in 1665, leaving his fortune to his daughter Mary, who married Sir Thomas Grosvenor; there were disputes as to whether Alexander had left money to Thomas, or died in his debt, but Thomas was, at any rate, a rich man.<br>
<br>Davies became less active in the book trade (although as late as 1672 the copyrights of Milton's <span class="italic">History of England</span> and the second part of <span class="italic">Hudibras</span> passed through his hands), and entered civic life as alderman of the ward of Farringdon Without in 1667. As sheriff in the same year, he was present when the foundation stone of the new Royal Exchange was laid, and was knighted on that occasion, &#145;a strange turn methinks&#146;, as his old schoolfellow Samuel Pepys observed in an unfriendly note  (diary, 23 Nov 1667); he also became a member of the governing body of his livery company. This entailed a payment of money to the company, which he did not make for many years. He became its master in 1668 and 1669, and neglected or refused to make the appropriate payment of venison on his election. In February 1669 he married Elizabeth, daughter of an alderman, William Ridges, with whom he had four sons.<br>
<br>In 1676 Davies became lord mayor of London, which necessitated his transferral to the Drapers' Company, of which he became master in the following year. His mayoralty is commemorated by inscriptions on Lamb's Conduit (rebuilt, like the Royal Exchange, after the great fire) and the Monument, and his life by a monument in St Sepulchre's Church, where he was buried in 1680. He died about March or April 1680, leaving property in Yorkshire, and a house at Cressing in Essex, where his eldest son shot himself. He was survived by his wife. A report said to have been prepared for Charles II in 1672 described Davies as &#145;A mean spirited person; when he was Sheriff of London he would (in a blind tavern) be drunk with his bailiffs and sergeants &hellip; He seldom appears in any business but his own&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 516).<br>
