<span class="headword">Aston,  Herbert</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1614, <em>d.</em> 1688/9), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was baptized in Chelsea on 16 January 1614, the third son in the family of ten children of Sir Walter Aston, later Baron Aston of Forfar (1583&#150;1639), of Tixall, Staffordshire, and his wife, Gertrude, daughter of Sir Thomas Sadleir of Standon Lordship, Hertfordshire, and his wife, Gertrude. He accompanied his father on his second embassy to Madrid between 1635 and 1638, as letters addressed to him in the private correspondence of the Aston family indicate  (BL, Add. MS 36452). Eight of those letters are from his youngest sister, <a name="cosubject_68057"></a><span class="headword">Constance Fowler</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1664)<span class="occ"></span>, who laments his absence and begs for more of his poems. Constance helped bring about the union of her brother and Katherine Thimelby (1617/18&#150;1658), his &#145;Seraphina&#146;, a member of a prominent Catholic family in Irnham, Lincolnshire, after his return from Spain in July 1638. The marriage probably took place that October.<br>
<br>Aston compiled a miscellany of popular poetry from 1634 onwards  (Beinecke MS Osborn b.4) and continued to write his own poems, fifty of which are recorded or alluded to in <span class="italic">Tixall Poetry</span> and BL, Add. MS 36452. He took up arms for the king during the civil war. In his account of Katherine's death at the age of forty on 9 July 1658, Aston writes that they had ten children  (BL, Add. MS 36452, fols. 53&#150;58<i>v</i>); two daughters were educated at the Augustinian priory headed by their aunt <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/105825/', "Winefrid Thimelby")</script>. After his wife's death Aston retired to Bellamore in Colton, Staffordshire, the house he built for her by 1656, where he died intestate; he was buried at Colton on 9 January 1689.<br>
<br>Constance was married about 1634 to Walter Fowler (<i>bap</i>. 1620, <i>d</i>. 1684) of St Thomas Priory, Staffordshire; they had twelve children. She also compiled a manuscript miscellany (Huntington MS HM 904), which preserves poetry written largely to and by her circle of predominantly Roman Catholic family and friends, who included Lady Dorothy Shirley and Sir Richard Fanshawe. It contains eight poems by her brother. Constance Fowler was buried at Baswich, Staffordshire, on 29 March 1664.<br>
