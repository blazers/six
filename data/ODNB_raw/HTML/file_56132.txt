<span class="headword">Dundas,  Robert Hamilton</span>  (1884&#150;1960), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born on 30 August 1884 at 14 Athole Crescent, Edinburgh, the only son of George Smythe Dundas of Duns (1842&#150;1909) and his wife, Georgina Lockhart Ross (<i>d</i>. 1927). His father, a lawyer, was later sheriff substitute of Roxburgh, Berwick, and Selkirk. Robert was a descendant of the younger Pitt's cabinet colleague Lord Melville, but seldom if ever mentioned him. From Summer Fields, Oxford, Dundas went to Eton College as king's scholar (ninth on the list) in 1897, and thence to New College, Oxford, as a scholar in classics in 1903; he was taught by Alfred Zimmern, and after firsts in classical moderations and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1905, 1907) was appointed to a lectureship in classics at Liverpool University in 1908, his superior (and another strong influence) being Professor Sir John Myres. In the following year he was elected to a studentship and tutorship at Christ Church, Oxford, where he taught Greek history for most of the next forty-six years.<br>
<br>Dundas quickly made an impression on his Christ Church colleagues, and was elected (junior) censor and put on two key committees on 2 December 1914, in the knowledge that he would soon accept a commission in the Black Watch. He served briefly in France in 1915 and then in Mesopotamia; wounded during the Kut campaign, he was posted to India, where he was a military censor in Delhi, Simla, and Rangoon. He was twice mentioned in dispatches, and ended the war as a captain. Back at Christ Church by May 1919, he was at once reinstated as censor (to 1924); from 1925 his tutorial rooms, once occupied by C. L. Dodgson, and borrowed by A. Einstein during Dundas's world tour in 1930&#150;31, were known to a long succession of Christ Church undergraduates, whatever their subject, as the place where Dundas had interrogated them on their arrival as to their knowledge of life and particularly of its financial and sexual aspects; some public schoolboys, forewarned by others, may have pulled his leg.<br>
<br>Dundas regarded his tutorial and counselling activities as more demanding calls on his time than printed contributions to classical scholarship. He had long been intending to publish a work on Thucydides, but the material which he had collected was stolen or lost on a wartime train journey to Scotland and, given the advance of scholarship, it was then too late for him to start all over again. His publications were therefore limited to a rather over-written reminiscence entitled &#145;The last place in India&#146; (1920), and the privately published Christ Church reports. Nevertheless, he taught many distinguished classicists, including E. S. G. Robinson. Sir John Masterman, Dundas's fellow censor, later commended him as &#145;the best-known and most honoured of all Christ Church tutors &hellip; the type of tutor who devoted his life to his pupils without any other competing activity&#146;.<br>
<br>In the senior common room, though never elected curator, Dundas often presided at formal sessions by seniority; here his inquisition had little place, the new arrivals being older (and, latterly, former service personnel); but he sang the praises of Christ Church&#151;without, it seemed, much detailed knowledge of its earlier history. He believed that he had lived in and had contributed to a golden age which his hearer, if Dundas's hopes were realized, could help to continue, especially if he held what to Dundas was the House's most important office: the censorship itself. When he reached retirement age (1955) Dundas was allowed to retain his rooms, and remained an active senior member. It is from this period that most reminiscences survive. In a stern reassessment, &#145;Mercurius Oxoniensis&#146; (H. R. Trevor-Roper) held that &#145;as a scholler he was no great shakes&#146;, but for fifty years Christ Church was the centre of his life and efforts: to that institution and its members, and to his relatives and house in Scotland, he gave the time and affection which others would have lavished on immediate family and home.<br>
<br>His <span class="italic">Times</span> obituarist (K. G. Feiling, a colleague from 1909 to 1946 in Oxford and briefly in India) attributed Dundas's attitudes and values to his experience of Lothian and to the influence of his mother's &#145;long and admirable&#146; life; the same writer thought that to Dundas college life was a &#145;training ground for action&#146;, and called him &#145;a pillar, in some ways the central pillar, of Christ Church&#146;. There Dundas much enjoyed a duty which he performed from 1938 to 1959: compiling the Christ Church annual report circulated to all members of the House. Each year he accumulated and brought together all that he could discover of the activities of members, with lapidary comments on the deeds and attitudes of many; his first six reports described the impact of war (he was himself again censor in 1944&#150;5), and the remainder the adjustment to peace and its novelties&#151;all this in economical and deeply considered prose (not without its Scotticisms), some of it rehearsed in advance to his often hard-pressed colleagues. The task allowed him to welcome, in somewhat guarded terms, the spouses of colleagues to the House's first Ladies Nights.<br>
<br>Dundas was an example of the lay bachelor don after 1882: a kind if idiosyncratic host to many pupils, former pupils, and friends (there were 1648 names in his visitors' book). He was a generous and unproclaimed benefactor of the needy young, and by his will left &pound;2000 to assist their travel (music, swimming, and travel were his own chief pleasures). He died at his home at Laurel Hill, Stirling, on 1 October 1960; his last words (&#145;You women always want to have the last word&#146;&#151;to his nurse), cited by Venables, are among the few such recorded of members of Christ Church.<br>
