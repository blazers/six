<span class="headword">Tresham,  William</span>  (1495&#150;1569), <span class="occ">priest</span>, was born in the parish of Oakley Magna, Northamptonshire, the son of Richard Tresham of Newton, Northamptonshire, and Rose Billing of Astwell, granddaughter of Sir Thomas Billing, lord chief justice. He studied at Merton College, Oxford, and graduated BA on 16 January 1515, MA in 1520, BTh in 1528, and DTh on 8 July 1532. In 1526 he was ordained priest. From 11 March 1524 to 11 February 1529 he served as registrar of the university. He occupied the office of vice-chancellor in 1532&#150;47, 1550, 1556, and 1558, and was a canon of Cardinal College between 1529 and 1531. In 1527 he was king of the beans at Merton, and was also the college's first bursar (1521&#150;2), third bursar (1526&#150;8), and third dean (1524&#150;6). Upon the transformation of Cardinal College&#151;first to King Henry VIII College, then to Christ Church&#151;Tresham became a canon, occupying the second stall in 1532&#150;5 and in 1546&#150;60. While a canon he oversaw the enlargement of the priory house. He served as vicar of St Mary Magdalen, Oxford, in 1534&#150;7, and of Bampton, Oxfordshire, in 1554&#150;60. He was admitted chancellor of Chichester in 1539, but had been deprived by 1560; he was deprived of his canonry of Lincoln the same year, and of his rectory of Bugbrooke, Northamptonshire. However, he held the Northamptonshire rectory of Towcester until his death.<br>
<br>Occasionally caught up in the religious controversies of his age, Tresham was a theological conservative throughout his career. His preferment in the refoundation of Cardinal College, along with his appointment as a canon of the new diocese of Oxford by royal charter in 1542, are usually seen as connected to his support for the king's divorce from Katherine of Aragon and the subsequent religious policies of Henry's reign. But he may simply have been deft at understanding the system of patronage and promotion within the Tudor church; surviving letters show him appealing to Wolsey, Cromwell, and the king to be generous in their support, and he even informed them of ill incumbents and possible vacancies. This, of course, does not deny a sincere religious conviction, and indeed Tresham appears to have enjoyed a reputation for being forthright, active, and intelligent. In 1535 he was a member of the commission for spiritualities in Oxfordshire, and in 1540 sat on a commission appointed to evaluate the grounding of church rituals in scriptural doctrine; it issued <span class="italic">A Necessary Doctrine and Erudition for any Chrysten Man</span>, popularly known as the <span class="roman">King's Book</span>, in 1543. In 1549 Tresham joined William Chedsey and Morgan Philips in a public debate with Pietro Martire Vermigli (known as Peter Martyr), supporting the doctrine of the real presence in the eucharist against Martyr's more Calvinist position. An account of the debate by Tresham was sent to the privy council with the title <span class="italic">Disputatio de eucharistiae sacramento</span> (BL, Harley MS 422), and was published under Martyr's name the same year.<br>
<br>Tresham was committed to the Fleet for his conservative religious position and criticism of church policy under Edward VI on 21 December 1551, but returned to freedom and church affairs with the accession of Mary I in 1553. In 1554 and 1555 he was one of the conservatives who debated with Thomas Cranmer, Hugh Latimer, and Nicholas Ridley on issues of orthodoxy and faith. This disputation was represented in an anonymous publication of 1554, later quoted in large part by John Foxe's <span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>. Also in 1554 he met Cardinal Pole to discuss the threatened spoliation of the building that once housed St Mary's College, Oxford, an institution for Augustinian canons which had closed in 1541. On behalf of the university Tresham and Thomas Raynolds, warden of Merton, offered congratulations to Elizabeth I upon her succession. But with his refusal to take the Elizabethan oath of supremacy, Tresham was stripped of all preferments except the rectory of Towcester and placed at Lambeth Palace in the custody of Archbishop Parker. Having made promise upon security that he would not interfere in religious affairs as established by law, he was allowed to retire to Northamptonshire, where he died in 1569. He was buried in the chancel of Bugbrooke church.<br>
