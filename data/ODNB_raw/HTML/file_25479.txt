<span class="headword">Evelyn, Sir  George Augustus William  Shuckburgh</span>, sixth baronet  (1751&#150;1804), <span class="occ">mathematician</span>, was born George Augustus William Shuckburgh on 23 August 1751, the eldest son of Richard Shuckburgh (1728&#150;1772) of Limerick and his wife, Sarah, daughter of Captain John Hayward RN, of Plumstead, Kent, and widow of Edward Bate. Sir Richard Shuckburgh (1596&#150;1656) was his direct ancestor. Shuckburgh was educated at Rugby School from June 1760 until he entered Balliol College, Oxford, in April 1768, graduating BA in 1772. On the death of his uncle, Sir Charles Shuckburgh, fifth baronet, on 10 August 1773, he succeeded to the baronetcy and the family estates at Shuckburgh, Warwickshire. He was elected to the Royal Society in December 1774, by which time he had already departed on a tour of Europe.<br>
<br>The weather diary which Shuckburgh maintained during this period shows that he spent the winter of 1774&#150;5 in Amiens, the following summer in Paris, then travelled via Lyons, where he was admitted to the Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences, Belles-Lettres et Arts, and reached Geneva in July 1775. Shuckburgh was particularly interested in the heights of the Alps, and in the structure and quality of the atmosphere. He took with him on his travels two fine travelling barometers by Ramsden, from which he could ascertain his altitude, also small hygrometers and an anemometer. From Geneva he went to Chamonix to explore its glacier, and continued over the Alps via Turin and Bologna to Florence, where he stayed for the rest of the winter. In the summer of 1776 he toured the Italian cities as far south as Rome, before returning to Paris, thence to London, which he reached in September 1776.<br>
<br>After his grand tour Shuckburgh frequently travelled within Britain, and occupied himself with various scientific experiments. He was elected to the Society of Antiquaries in 1777, and was among the medical and political membership of the Eumelean Club, which met in a tavern in Bond Street, Westminster. On 27 September 1780 he was returned to parliament for the county of Warwick, and retained the seat until his death. He mostly supported Pitt and Fox; one of the few subjects on which he spoke in the house was applied mathematics, on which he presented several papers to the Royal Society. In 1790 he was one of the committee that declined the petition of Thomas Mudge who was seeking a reward for his chronometer, and he spoke on the debate in 1793. In February 1796 he actively supported the public purchase of John Hunter's museum, which was given into the care of the Royal College of Surgeons.<br>
<br>Shuckburgh's first marriage, on 3 July 1782 to Sarah Johanna (1755&#150;1783), daughter of John Darker, merchant and MP for Leicester, was brief; on 10 April 1783 she died at Bristol where she had gone to take the medicinal waters. His second marriage, on 6 October 1785 at St Margaret's, Westminster, was to Julia Annabella (1757&#150;1797), daughter of James Evelyn of Felbridge, Surrey. Their only child, Julia Evelyn Medley Shuckburgh, was born in her father's town house, in Park Street, Westminster.<br>
<br>The painstaking barometric measurements made by Shuckburgh and General William Roy in Savoy, concerning the heights of mountains, were published in 1777. Shuckburgh also toured Wales in 1779, taking barometric readings at the foot and summit of Snowdon. Astronomy was another of his interests; his observatory at Shuckburgh was equipped with an equatorial telescope and other instruments by Jesse Ramsden. From 1780 Shuckburgh began to consider how best to set up a universal measure of length, such that if the physical standard should be destroyed, the measure could be reconstructed from first principles. He devoted much time to determination of standards of length, capacity, and weight. In contrast to similar work being undertaken in France, where the metre was taken as one part in ten million of the distance between pole and equator along a great circle, Shuckburgh chose to derive the yard by reference to the length of a pendulum beating seconds. He procured the apparatus which John Whitehurst had constructed before his death, and obtained a chronometer from Arnold, and from the instrument maker Edward Troughton a 5 foot standard, fitted with reading microscopes, and a precision beam balance. The microscopes allowed a far more accurate measurement than the beam-compasses used hitherto, and did not need to be in contact with the standard. In the event, Whitehurst's apparatus was unequal to the task, but with the aid of Whitehurst's data, and comparisons with existing standards dating from the reign of Henry VII, Shuckburgh achieved his aim. For this work, the Royal Society awarded him its Copley medal.<br>
<br>The condition of inheritance following the death of his father-in-law in 1793 required Shuckburgh to adopt the name of Evelyn, which he took by private act of 1794, being henceforth known as Shuckburgh Evelyn. Another private bill dealt with enclosure of his lands, possibly in connection with the construction of a canal through this area. He died at Shuckburgh Park on 11 August 1804 and was buried on 20 August at Shuckburgh church, alongside his wives. His daughter married in 1810 Charles Cecil Cope, third and last earl of Liverpool.<br>
