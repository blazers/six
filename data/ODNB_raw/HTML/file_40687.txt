<span class="headword">Jones,  (William) Clifford <span class="st"> [Cliff]</span></span>  (1914&#150;1990), <span class="occ">rugby player and administrator</span>, was born on 12 March 1914 in the Rhondda valley at Porth near Pontypridd, Glamorgan, the second son in a family of two sons and two daughters of Daniel Jones, wholesale fruit and vegetable merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth Mary Lewis. He was educated at Porth secondary school and, from the age of fourteen, at Llandovery College. From 1933 he attended Clare College, Cambridge, where he obtained a third class in part one of the law tripos (1935) and a second (division two) in part two (1936). There he proved himself to be among the very first order of rugby players, winning a blue three times.<br>
<br>It was at Llandovery College that Jones's extraordinary talent had been revealed. For five years, five afternoons a week, under the coaching of T. P. (Pope) Williams, he had been initiated into the arts of rugby, for which, at 5 feet 8 inches and only 10&frac12; stone, he was not well tailored. To survive, he relied on his quick wits and his electrifying speed off the mark. His swift, breathtaking sidestep (off either foot) he attributed, as he claimed in one of the embroidered anecdotes of which he was fond, to the daily necessity of avoiding the crowd, traffic, and lamp-posts of the narrow Welsh valleys and the cluttered passages of his college. Having played for the Welsh secondary schools between 1931 and 1933, he left a legacy of virtuoso running. He played his first senior game for Wales (against England) at the age of nineteen. He continued to play for Wales while at university, but his national career lasted only four years. He was unable to escape the ravages of rugby's muscular confrontations: bones were cracked and joints displaced. He missed an international season because of injury in 1937. This prompted his early thoughts of quitting, so that he played only thirteen times for his country (as captain in 1938) and a mere twenty-two for his club, Cardiff. He was one of the greatest outside-halves to have graced the game.<br>
<br>While Jones was playing he insisted on assiduous preparation, bringing along his own masseur at a time when such assistance was unheard of. Although he was a supreme individualist he valued teamwork, as he emphasized in his book, <span class="italic">Rugby Football</span>, published in 1937. He benefited from the long pass from his partner at scrum-half, Haydn Tanner, while he in turn was able to utilize, as in the 1934 Oxford&#150;Cambridge match, the powerful, long-striding skills of Wilfred Wooller outside him. This technique came to mature fruition in Wales's 13&#150;12 victory against the New Zealand All Blacks in 1935, at Cardiff Arms Park.<br>
<br>Jones declared his temporary retirement in 1938 in order to concentrate on further legal studies, but he had played his last game for Wales. In 1939 he married Gwendoline Mary, daughter of Frederick Bartle Thomas, wholesale butcher in Tonypandy; they had three sons. He returned to play for Cardiff against Bridgend on the first Saturday in September 1939, and war was declared the following day. In the same year he was appointed assistant solicitor to Glamorgan county council and assistant prosecuting solicitor to Glamorgan police. However, he took up these posts only briefly, because when war broke out he joined the 77th regiment of the heavy anti-aircraft Royal Artillery (Territorial Army), where he rose to the rank of major. Stationed in Berlin at the end of the war he was assistant to the chief legal officer.<br>
<br>In 1946 Jones returned to Porth to join his father's business and later to start his own, Clun Fruits, in Pont-y-clun, where the family lived, before finally embarking on a property business. He had little contact with rugby for ten years and developed an enduring interest in watercolours, particularly marine and Victorian paintings.<br>
<br>In 1956 Jones's interest in rugby revived and he became a member of the Welsh Rugby Union committee. In the following year he became a selector, a position he held until 1978. In the 1960s he was chairman of the committee which developed, in Wales, following the Welsh team's disastrous visit to South Africa in 1964, the world's first comprehensive rugby coaching scheme, from which was established a permanent national coaching organizer, the first of its kind in the rugby world. He was the union's president in the centenary year of 1980&#150;81. He was also a member of the Sports Council of Great Britain from 1967 to 1971, and in 1971 was a founder member of the Sports Council for Wales. He presided over the &#145;golden age&#146; of Welsh rugby football in the late 1960s and 1970s, being behind the squad training system which enabled Wales to dominate their European rivals. In 1979 he was appointed OBE.<br>
<br>Jones was dapper, with fair hair and, in later years, nicely rounded features. He was animated and gregarious, as vibrant in his conversation as he was on the field. He invariably wore his Hawks' club tie and Cambridge blues' scarf. Jones died of a heart attack on 27 November 1990 at his home, Buttress House, Bonvilston, near Cardiff, to which he and his wife had moved in later years. He was buried in the churchyard of St Nicholas near Cardiff. His wife and sons survived him.<br>
