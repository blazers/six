<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stanley,  John</span>  (1712&#150;1786), <span class="occ">organist and composer</span>, was born in London on 17 January 1712, the third but eldest surviving child (of six) of John Stanley (<i>d</i>. 1735), a Post Office official, and his wife, Elizabeth Davy (<i>d</i>. 1730), sexton at the church of St Mary Bothaw. When two years old he was blinded by falling on a marble hearth while holding a china basin in his hand. At the age of seven he was placed under John Reading, then organist at St John's, Hackney, but soon after he became a pupil of Maurice Greene, organist at St Paul's Cathedral. Evidently making rapid progress, in October 1723 Stanley was appointed organist of All Hallows, Bread Street. Just three years later he won the more prestigious position at St Andrew's, Holborn, where he succeeded Daniel Purcell and John Isham. In 1729 he presented as his exercise at Oxford the ode <span class="italic">The Power of Musick</span> and became the youngest person there to graduate BMus. He was elected organist to the Society of the Inner Temple in 1734, and held this post, with that at St Andrew's, until his death. Stanley's reputation as a performer was such that, according to John Alcock:<blockquote>it was common, just as the service at St. Andrew's church, or the Temple, was ended, to see forty or fifty organists at the altar, waiting to hear his last voluntary: even Mr. Handel himself I have many times seen at each of those places. (<span class="italic">Universal Magazine</span>, 79, July 1786, 44)</blockquote>On 22 July 1738 Stanley married his pupil Sarah Arlond (<i>d</i>. 1780), the daughter of Captain Edward Arlond, a merchant in the East India Company; they had no children.<br>
<br>Despite the loss of his sight, Stanley was a good player at skittles, shovelboard, billiards, and of whist, using perforated cards. He also enjoyed walking and horse-riding. His musical ear and memory were exceptional: he could remember and perform any piece after hearing it once, and even when he had to accompany a new oratorio his sister-in-law, Ann Arlond (who lived with Stanley and his wife), needed to play it through to him once only. Having to accompany a <span class="roman">Te Deum</span> in D by Handel (probably the <span class="roman">Dettingen</span>), and finding the organ to be tuned a semitone sharp, he transposed the entire composition without hesitation, a feat that seems to have impressed his contemporaries. He played regularly in concerts in London, and sometimes too in the provinces, and he was in much demand as a teacher; among his earliest pupils was John Alcock, only three years his junior. Stanley was a member of the Academy of Vocal (later Ancient) Music. He also played the violin, and led the subscription concerts at The Swan tavern in Cornhill and The Castle in Paternoster Row, using a Stainer violin for orchestral playing and a Cremona for solos; both were lost when The Swan burnt down in 1748. During this period Stanley was a prolific composer of cantatas. Most were published, including three sets (1742, 1748, 1751), and many of them have texts by John Hawkins. Yet he is much better known for his three sets of organ voluntaries (1748, 1752, 1754), and also for the six concerti grossi (op. 2, 1742), which rank among the finest of their type.<br>
<br>When Handel became blind and could not accompany his oratorio performances, Stanley was recommended to him as a substitute; but Handel preferred John Christopher Smith, objecting, he said, to the blind leading the blind. After Handel's death, in 1760 Smith and Stanley entered into partnership and continued the Lenten oratorio performances at Covent Garden. The seasons consisted mostly of oratorios by Handel, though the new managers took the opportunity to include their own works. Stanley had written an oratorio, <span class="italic">Jephtha</span>, in the early 1750s, but it was apparently never performed. For their first season (1760) Stanley composed <span class="italic">Zimri</span>, which was published in full score but without the choruses and most of the recitatives. He played organ concertos in the intervals of the oratorio performances, as Handel had done (though other instrumentalists were permitted to play solos too), and he accompanied the oratorios throughout. He published six of his organ concertos as op. 10 in 1775. Stanley also wrote secular theatre works: for Drury Lane he composed incidental music to John Hawkesworth's <span class="italic">Oroonoko</span> (1759) and the masque <span class="italic">The Tears and Triumphs of Parnassus</span> (1760), the latter an elegy on the death of George II and a homage to George III, but these are now lost. However, the pastoral <span class="italic">Arcadia, or, The Shepherd's Wedding</span>, performed at Drury Lane on 26 October 1761 to mark the recent marriage of George III and Queen Charlotte, survives, as does the opera <span class="italic">Teraminta</span> (probably never performed), which was once thought to be by John Christopher Smith but is now attributed to Stanley.<br>
<br>In 1770 the oratorios moved to the Drury Lane Theatre; in 1774 Stanley's <span class="italic">The Fall of Egypt</span> was performed, and in that same year Smith retired. His place was taken in 1776 by the elder Thomas Linley, and he and Stanley continued the oratorios until Stanley's retirement in 1785. From 1775 to 1777 Stanley directed the annual performances of <span class="italic">Messiah</span> in aid of the Foundling Hospital, where he had become a governor in 1770. In February 1779, on the death of William Boyce, Stanley was appointed master of the king's band, in which capacity he supplied fifteen new year and birthday odes; the music for all of them is now lost. He became, in addition, &#145;Conductor of the Musick at the Balls at Court&#146; in 1782, after the sudden death of Charles Weidemann. His last composition was probably the ode, with a text by the poet laureate, Thomas Warton, written for the king's birthday on 4 June 1786. It was duly performed, but Stanley had died at his house in Hatton Garden on 19 May. He was buried on the evening of 27 May in the new ground attached to St Andrew's, Holborn. On the following Sunday an appropriate selection was performed &#145;on that organ on which Mr. Stanley had with much eminence displayed his musical abilities near sixty years&#146;.<br>
