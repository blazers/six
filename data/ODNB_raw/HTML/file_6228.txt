<span class="headword">Cooper,  Samuel</span>  (1780&#150;1848), <span class="occ">surgeon and writer</span>, was born on 11 September 1780, the second son of a businessman who had made a fortune in the West Indies, but who died when his three sons were still young. He was trained by Dr Burney at Greenwich Hospital, and in 1800 entered St Bartholomew's Hospital, where he showed great promise. In 1803 he became MRCS, and settled in Golden Square, London. In 1806 he gained the Jacksonian prize at the Royal College of Surgeons for the best essay; his subject was diseases of the joints. In 1807 he published his <span class="italic">First Lines of Surgery</span>, which went through seven editions. In 1809 the first edition of his great <span class="italic">Surgical Dictionary</span> appeared, and it achieved instant popularity. During Cooper's lifetime seven large and carefully revised editions appeared.<br>
<br>In 1810 Cooper married a Miss Cranstoun (<i>d</i>. 1811), but she died in the following year, leaving a daughter, who afterwards married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19376/', "Thomas Morton")</script>, surgeon to University College Hospital. After his wife's death Cooper in 1813 entered the army as surgeon, and served at the battle of Waterloo. Afterwards he devoted his attention to editing the successive editions of his two principal works. He also ran a successful surgical practice. In 1827 he became a member of the council of the Royal College of Surgeons, and from 1831 was surgeon at University College Hospital and professor of surgery in the college. In 1845 he was elected president of the Royal College of Surgeons, and in 1846 fellow of the Royal Society. In 1848 he resigned from both his posts in protest at the appointment of James Syme as professor of clinical surgery. Cooper died of gout on 2 December 1848.<br>
<br>Besides his principal works Cooper wrote a book on <span class="italic">Cataract</span> (1805), and edited the third and fourth editions of Mason Good's <span class="italic">Study of Medicine</span>. He delivered the Hunterian oration in 1834. The <span class="italic">Dictionary</span> was translated into French, German, and Italian, and several times was republished in America.<br>
