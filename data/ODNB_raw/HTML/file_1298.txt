<span class="headword">Banks,  John</span>  (1709&#150;1751), <span class="occ">poet and biographer</span>, was born at Sonning, Berkshire. After the death about 1715 of his father, John, his education was entrusted to his uncle, who placed him at a local private school run by Mr Belpene. Banks proved to be a bright and able scholar but was shortly afterwards withdrawn from the school, allegedly because his schoolmaster was jealous of his ability. A more plausible explanation would be that the uncle was unwilling or unable to continue to pay for his nephew's education. Banks was placed as an apprentice to a weaver in Reading but before he could complete his apprenticeship he broke his arm, which prevented him from working. He was saved from destitution by a timely legacy of &pound;10 from a distant relation. He moved to London and set up a bookstall in Spitalfields.<br>
<br>Banks, impressed by the success of Stephen Duck's poem <span class="italic">The Thresher' Labour</span> and the patronage Duck received from Queen Caroline, was inspired to emulate him. He published in imitation in 1730 <span class="italic">The Weaver's Miscellany</span>, but this failed to produce the required effect. Even Banks admitted that it was a work of little distinction. Soon afterwards he gave up his bookstall and became an assistant at the bookshop of Mr Montague. He now found time to write poetry and sent a poem to Alexander Pope, who was sufficiently impressed to agree to subscribe to Banks's forthcoming publication, which appeared in 1738 entitled <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Works in Verse and Prose</span>. This not only enhanced Banks's reputation as a poet but enabled him to become a writer by profession. His next work, <span class="italic">A Life of Christ</span>, also proved popular with the public. His most renowned work was <span class="italic">A Short Critical Review of the Political Life of Oliver Cromwell</span> (1739), which, unlike previous biographies of Cromwell, was sympathetic towards its subject. This led to accusations by staunch tories that Banks was a subverter of the truth and an enemy of the monarchy. Nevertheless the book was well received by the public and by 1769 had reached a fifth edition. Further biographical works followed: in 1740 he wrote a biography of Peter the Great and in 1744, amid increasing fears of an imminent French invasion and a landing by James Stuart, the Pretender, published <span class="italic">The History of the Life and Reign of William III</span>. This did much to restore his reputation as a true patriot and dispel any lingering doubts that he entertained Jacobite sympathies. In the late 1740s Banks wrote for, and may have edited, the opposition essay newspapers, the <span class="italic">Old England Journal</span> and the <span class="italic">Westminster Journal</span>.<br>
<br>Towards the spring of 1751 Banks's health, which for long had been delicate, visibly deteriorated. He was diagnosed as suffering from a nervous disorder which ultimately proved fatal. He died at his home in Islington on 19 April 1751.<br>
