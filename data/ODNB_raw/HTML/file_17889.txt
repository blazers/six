</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mallet, Sir  Louis</span>  (1823&#150;1890), <span class="occ">civil servant and economist</span>, was born on 16 March 1823 in Hampstead, Middlesex, the second son of John Lewis Mallet (<i>b</i>. 1775) and his second wife, Frances (<i>d</i>. 1851), sister of John Herman Merivale of Barton Place, Exeter. Louis was descended from a Huguenot family which left France because of religious persecution and settled in Geneva. His grandfather Mallet du Pan (<i>b</i>. 1749), a celebrated publicist, fled from Paris to Britain in 1798, with John Lewis, to escape the French Revolution. Mallet's father was appointed through Pitt's influence to a clerkship in the Audit Office in 1800 and rose to be secretary to the board of audit.<br>
<br>Mallet was privately educated because of an unspecified constitutional delicacy inherited from his father. In 1839 he was appointed junior clerk in the Audit Office, where monotonous regularity plagued him&#151;as it did throughout his life. He turned to reading poetry and Shakespeare, studying German, playing the guitar, and initiating a lifelong correspondence with &#145;a brilliantly gifted cousin of about his own age&#146;, Louisa Merivale  (Mallet, <span class="italic">Sir Louis Mallet</span>, 12). In 1847 he moved to the more congenial and stimulating atmosphere of the statistical department of the Board of Trade, which expanded vigorously in responsibility and staff during the 1850s. A whig with radical sympathies, he studied political economy, embraced free trade before meeting Cobden personally, and rose through the ranks to assistant secretary and head of the commercial department on 2 January 1867. While doing so he became private secretary (1848&#150;52) to the president of the board, Henry Labouchere, and then (1855&#150;8) to Stanley of Alderley as vice-president and president. In 1858 he married Frances Helen, daughter of the Hon. and Revd Edward Pellew. They had four sons, of whom Bernard wrote a biography of his father.<br>
<br>In 1860 Mallet was appointed assistant commissioner, under Richard Cobden, for negotiating the commercial treaty with France. Cobden was impressed by his exceptional competence. This was the turning point in Mallet's career. He became an enthusiastic proponent of Cobden's ideas and was launched into diplomatic work, resulting in some sixty commercial treaties in Europe. Cobden's death in 1865 left him the principal authority on commercial policy, and the chief official representative of free-trade opinion. He was joint plenipotentiary for negotiating treaties of commerce and navigation with Austria in 1866. This established his reputation as chief adviser to the British government in matters of commercial foreign policy. He was accorded the CB in 1866, and was knighted in 1868.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, in 1864, a parliamentary select committee report recommended that the Foreign Office and its consular staff become the clearing house for Board of Trade commercial negotiations and treaties. By 1868 the commercial department withered to an assistant secretary and four under-employed clerks. Mallet pragmatically recommended that the consultative business of the commercial department be transferred to the Foreign Office, and resigned in January 1872.<br>
<br>Largely because of his commercial experience, Mallet was appointed to the Council of India, on which he served from 8 August 1872 until 16 February 1874, when he succeeded his cousin Herman Merivale as permanent under-secretary in the India Office. A stickler for discipline, punctuality, and protocol, he was dismayed by the persistence of the easy-going ways of the East India House, and complained to the newly appointed secretary of state, Salisbury, of the &#145;laxity&#146; which had been &#145;allowed to grow up in this office&#146;. Certain heads of department were singled out for criticism of their &#145;superficial&#146; and &#145;misguided&#146; opinions, or for being &#145;literary men&#146; with press connections. In his opinion &#145;the personality of an official should be vigorously and systematically suppressed&#146;. As for the council, it was &#145;too young&#146;, given to holidays, and rushing off to the train at the end of meetings  (Williams, 102&#150;5). He did not discourage Markham, head of the geographical department, from resigning in 1877. Even the young, inexperienced parliamentary under-secretary Hamilton was loaded with work to test his durability  (Hamilton, 69).<br>
<br>Mallet's exorcism of the ghost of &#145;John Company&#146;, which included tidying up the secret department, made it easier for his successor, J. A. Godley, to consolidate office reform. Mallet exercised considerable influence on the finance committee. His financial and commercial expertise, underpinned by Salisbury, improved the standing of the office in economic matters. Both were anxious to curb expenditure, especially in public works, which Mallet regarded as &#145;a bottomless pit of expense and waste&#146;, not to be funded by government  (Mallet, <span class="italic">Northbrook</span>, 70; Mallet, <span class="italic">Sir Louis Mallet</span>, 122).<br>
<br>Mallet's relationship with Salisbury was cordial, with considerable agreement on policy. The viceroy from 1872 to 1876, Northbrook, was a personal friend. Notwithstanding, the 1875 <span class="roman">Indian Tariff Act</span>, with its duty on raw cotton, was ill received in the India Office, where Sir Erskine Perry warned Northbrook that Mallet &#145;as a rigid Member of the Cobden Club would annihilate everything that in the least involves protection&#146;  (Moulton, 197&#150;8) [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/45600', "Cobden Club")</script>]. In an unprecedented move, Mallet was sent to India to negotiate suitable amendments. There he fell ill, but he benefited from this valuable, if short-lived, Indian experience. Meanwhile Salisbury disallowed parts of the act. Later Mallet contributed to its repeal, and the reform and reduction of the salt tax. Nevertheless, Indian policy generally was subject to vagaries in the relationship between the home and supreme governments. Ultimately, even Mallet, with his strong aversion to &#145;feeble and slipshod Government&#146;, was convinced that because of this weakness, and lack of knowledge on the part of transient ministers, it was impossible for the India Office to initiate effective measures for reform  (Mallet, <span class="italic">Sir Louis Mallet</span>, 39, 147&#150;9).<br>
<br>Mallet believed in a secure India within the empire, governed according to British ideas, but he disapproved strongly of the title empress of India conferred on Queen Victoria, as encouraging disloyalty among Indians. In 1877, during the Russo-Turkish War, he agreed with Salisbury that restless Muslims did not constitute a threat either in India or to British policy in Europe. He supported the employment of Indians in the lower ranks of the civil service, believing that the material condition of the Indian masses should be improved to equip them for self-government. His strong sense of justice and equity thus laced his view of England's mission abroad, which owed much to Cobden's lifelong aim &#145;to lay the foundations of her empire in her moral greatness&#146;  (Mallet, <span class="italic">Free Exchange</span>, 71). He opposed the &#145;forward&#146; policy in India, believing that further expansion of empire generally should not be at the cost of failure to alleviate suffering at home. The surge of imperialism after the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1878) troubled him, since he took no pride in assuming the &#145;white man's burden&#146;. Increasingly, therefore, he no longer felt at home in government.<br>
<br>Mallet represented the varied interests of India and Britain, as a royal commissioner at the Paris and London exhibitions (1878) and, with Lord Reay, at the international commission on gold and silver in Paris (1881), where he became a convinced bimetallist. In retirement he was a member of the royal commission on the relative value of precious metals (1887&#150;8). Earlier he was a member of the royal commission on the copyright laws (1875).<br>
<br>Mallet, like his father, did not publish extensively, and read widely in French and English literature (including <span class="italic">Treasure Island</span>) for relaxation. He preferred to live among those who divided their time between &#145;letters and affairs&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Morley's biography of Cobden owed much to his suggestion and help. His contributions to the publications of the Cobden Club, and various other writings, were collected in <span class="italic">Free Exchange</span> (1891). Sympathetic to Frederic Bastiat and the French school, and unhappy with Ricardo and Mill, his view of Cobden's ideas identified a carefully conceived political scheme which embraced all aspects of national life, seeking a solution to the social problem. In its international aspect, it was a policy of concord and peace  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). As he put it:<blockquote>If, as an economist and Liberal, I did not believe that the free operation of natural economic laws tended to raise the condition of the masses and to bring about a less unequal distribution of wealth, I should take very little interest in political economy or in public affairs. (Mallet, <span class="italic">Free Exchange</span>, frontispiece)</blockquote>Mallet belonged to an &#145;inner circle of influential political thinkers&#146; who had personal access to all levels of government  (Mallet, <span class="italic">Sir Louis Mallet</span>, 53). At congenial gatherings in the homes of Grant Duff and Lord Arthur Russell he enjoyed the company of friends who included Indian civilians and soldiers. The Athenaeum also was a meeting-place with, among others, Maine, Cobden, and Matthew Arnold. However, the new spirit in imperial government was at odds with his high principles of peace abroad and retrenchment at home, while living in London had become &#145;impossible&#146; for health reasons. Accordingly, he resigned on 29 September 1883. A month earlier he had been sworn of the privy council.<br>
<br>Mallet moved to Englefield Green, Surrey, in 1884. As a young man he delighted in natural beauty and country life, riding his horse to work. But chronic ill health, including a partial failure of eyesight during the 1850s and 1860s, resulted in frequent absences from the office. Persistent infirmity saddened him, but there was no self-pity or shirking of duty. His firm, austere looks denoted a magisterial presence, whose challenging eyes belied unusual sensitivity and compassion. He was essentially a family man, whose wife &#145;brought him the lifelong devotion and intelligent and cheerful companionship which was precisely what his own deeply affectionate nature needed&#146;  (Mallet, <span class="italic">Sir Louis Mallet</span>, 31). Endowed with many statesman-like attributes, including perspicacity, persuasiveness, and humour, Mallet carried authority graciously and with humility. His unassuming <i>savoir-vivre</i> was derived from his forebears, parents, and family connections and friends in Britain and the continent, which he visited regularly from the age of ten. He died of influenza at 13 Royal Crescent, Bath, on 16 February 1890.<br>
<br>There were those who believed that Mallet was too single-minded in his quest for universal free trade as a panacea, failing to appreciate fully the weaknesses of commercial treaties; that he was on the wrong side in the bimetallic controversy, and appeared to have underestimated the capacity of Britain to pay additional taxes. Yet he was admired, especially because he never lost sight of his life's main question: &#145;Why have I so much and others so little?&#146; For him the solution lay in the teachings of the economists, reflected in his dictum that &#145;A man may be an economist without being a statesman; he most certainly cannot be a statesman without being an economist&#146;  (<span class="italic">Spectator</span>, 95, 1905, 654).<br>
