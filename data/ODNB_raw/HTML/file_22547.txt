<span class="headword">Pordage,  Samuel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1633, <em>d.</em> in or after 1691), <span class="occ">poet and translator</span>, was baptized on 29 December 1633 at St Dionis Backchurch, London, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22546/', "John Pordage (bap. 1607, d. 1681)")</script> and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69335/', "Mary Pordage, n&#233;e Lane (d. 1668)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22546/', "Pordage, John")</script>]. In 1644 Samuel went to study at the Merchant Taylors' School, but how long he remained there is uncertain. He had certainly spent enough time at Bradfield to testify in 1654 to the harmlessness of his father's occult interests.<br>
<br>Pordage was living with his father when he finished work on his first publications, a translation of Seneca's <span class="italic">Troades</span> and <span class="italic">Poems Upon Several Occasions</span>, both published in 1660. The latter contained panegyrics to the king and to Monck, in addition to love poems. The influence of his father's occult interests is evident from the description of the restoration of the monarchy in these poems and in <span class="italic">Heroick Stanzas on His Majesties Coronation</span> (1661) as an alchemical refinement.<br>
<br>At this time, in 1660, Samuel married Dorcas Langhorne. A son, Charles, was born in 1661, and two children are mentioned in the will of Samuel's father, John. Pordage may have entered the service of the duke of Buckingham before spending the mid- and later 1660s as steward to the earl of Pembroke. In 1661 Pordage's long poem <span class="italic">Mundorum explicatio</span> was published by Lodowick Lloyd, who was well known for his interest in mystical works. This, Pordage's longest and most important poem, is a Creation epic written in accordance with the German mystic Jakob Boehme's version of the book of <span class="roman">Genesis</span>. Most significant here is the double Fall, first from the androgynous Adam into man and womankind, and second the temptation to eat the forbidden fruit. After the Fall, magic and prophetic gifts are the means available for mankind to return to a prelapsarian state. The &#145;Hieroglyphical Figure&#146; attached to some copies of the poem, and of which the subtitle proclaims it to be an interpretation, contains a fusion of imagery from familist and Boehme works. The strong presence of Boehme in the poem (typified in the extensive explanation of the principles of light and darkness that permeate the created world) has led some to suggest that John Pordage was the author. There is no doubt that John Pordage introduced his son to Boehme, but equally no doubt that the poem, by dint of some stylistic similarity with his other works, is Samuel's. Collaboration between father and son is quite possible.<br>
<br>To Pordage has also been ascribed the unsigned prose romance <span class="italic">Eliana</span> (1661). If this long work, largely concerned with passion and desire, as opposed to politics and war, is indeed Pordage's, it was probably written during the 1650s: like <span class="italic">Mundorum explicatio</span>, it was most probably a product of the relative confinement of these years.<br>
<br>Pordage published nothing more in the 1660s, but spent most of the following decade writing heroic tragedies, which were favourably received on the London stage: <span class="italic">Herod and Mariamne</span> (first published in 1673, probably first performed in September 1671, and possibly written as early as 1661) and <span class="italic">The Siege of Babylon</span> (performed in September 1677, first published in 1678). The dominant theme, common to this genre, was love versus honour, of Platonic love versus the passions, and the conflicting claims of public versus private life. Pordage combed the huge French prose romances of the mid-seventeenth century for plots and characters: he was indebted particularly to Gauthier de Costes de La Calpren&egrave;de's <span class="italic">Cleopatra</span> (1647) and <span class="italic">Cassandre</span> (1645&#150;60). <span class="italic">Herod and Mariamne</span> was published anonymously, but contained an epistle dedicatory to the duchess of Albemarle, written by Elkanah Settle. Pordage claimed that the play was in fact assumed to be Settle's, who in turn claimed that Pordage had asked him to finish the play. Pordage himself claimed that he had been out of the country while the play passed as Settle's.<br>
<br>Pordage's connections with aristocrats, like Buckingham, who were out of power in the 1660s, and hence likely to be opposed to government policy, was a foretaste of things to come. During the Popish Plot furore, Pordage dedicated an edition of John Reynolds's <span class="italic">The Triumph of God's Revenge Against the Sin of Murther</span> (1679) to the whig leader, the earl of Shaftesbury. In 1681 Pordage's libellous attack on Danby, then Charles II's chief minister, <span class="italic">A New Apparition of S. Edmund-Bery Godfrey's Ghost to the E. of D&#151;</span>, was issued anonymously. Its appearance was shortly followed by a public apology from its printer. In 1682 Pordage produced <span class="italic">Azaria and Hushai</span>, an attack on Dryden's famous satire of Shaftesbury, <span class="italic">Absalom and Achitophel</span> (1681), turning Dryden's allegorical technique against himself. Later in the same year Pordage answered Dryden's next attack on Shaftesbury, <span class="italic">The Medal: a Satire Against Sedition</span> in <span class="italic">The Medal Revers'd: a Satire Against Persecution</span>. Both responses have had their admirers, some claiming that Pordage was the best of the whig poets responding to Dryden. Tory pens, including Dryden and L'Estrange, ignored the courteous temperance that was present in his writings as well as his character, and mocked him for poverty, anti-literary sentiments, for being out of fashion, and for being the son of a notorious enthusiast. Pordage reserved his strongest criticism for the duke of York, the duchess of Portsmouth, and for Dryden. He exposed time-servers on both sides of the dispute, and the tyranny of mob rule, while defending monarchy founded on a sovereignty which was located ultimately in the people. Despite his whig connections, Pordage remained loyal to Charles II, and wrote <span class="italic">The Loyal Incendiary, or, The Generous Boutefieu</span> in 1684 on the burning of Rye House, and the consequent frustration of the plot to assassinate the king there.<br>
<br>In his later years Pordage devoted himself to further translations: in particular, several treatises on neurology and psychology by Thomas Willis, which appeared in English between 1681 and 1684. In the translation of <span class="italic">De anima brutorum</span> (1683), Pordage gave &#145;psychology&#146; its first use in the modern English sense. He is last mentioned in 1691 as a member of the Worthy Society of Lincoln's Inn.<br>
