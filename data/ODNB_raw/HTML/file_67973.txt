<span class="headword">Stoeffken <span class="st"> [Steffkin]</span>,  Dietrich</span>  (<em>c.</em>1600&#150;1673), <span class="occ">viol player and composer</span>, was born probably in northern Germany. Nothing is known of his parentage. His name may originally have been St&ouml;ffchen. He signed himself &#145;Ditrich St&ouml;effken&#146;, but in later years the surname was Anglicized as Steffkin or Steffkins and he was often called Theodore. Some authorities have stated that Dietrich and Theodore were brothers  (eg. Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>, 14.257&#150;8); but official records, which describe his widow, Sarah Steffkin, variously as the relict and administratrix of Dietrich and of Theodore, prove that Westrup was right to treat these as variant names of the same man (Westrup, 81&#150;2; Ashbee, 5.127, 146).<br>
<br>In 1622 Stoeffken was employed at the court of Christian IV of Denmark, probably in a viol consort led by the English musician William Brade. From there he may have moved to the ducal court at Gottorf. By 1628 he was in England as a musician to Queen Henrietta Maria, and in 1634 he took part in the court masque <span class="italic">The Triumph of Peace</span>; from 1636 he was also a &#145;musician for the consort&#146; to Charles I. Shortly before the civil war Stoeffken left England, and in May 1642 he was appointed violist to Friedrich Wilhelm, elector of Brandenburg. He was married to Sarah by 1646; two sons, Frederick William (1646&#150;1709) and Christian Leopold (<i>d</i>. 1714), became eminent violists at the English court. During 1647&#150;8, following the elector's marriage to the princess of Orange, Stoeffken was seconded to the stadholder's service in The Hague. Constantijn Huygens, the stadholder's secretary, remarked on his outstanding skill in a letter to Mersenne of 14 January 1647, and later engaged in friendly correspondence with the musician himself  (Crawford, 46&#150;51). By 1653 Stoeffken was living in Hamburg. He performed for Archduke Leopold Wilhelm at Regensburg in 1654, and in 1659 he appears to have been in Rome. At the Restoration he returned to the English court as a member of Charles II's private musick and a musician to the queen mother. In 1673 he accompanied the king's ambassadors to the council of Cologne; his death there, probably in December, is recorded in a probate administration of February 1674. His widow continued to receive arrears of his court pay at least until 1677.<br>
<br>Pepys described Stoeffken as &#145;a temperate sober man&#146;  (Pepys, 17 July 1663). Roger North remembered the &#145;particular friendship cultivated&#146; between Stoeffken and the composer John Jenkins  (<span class="italic">Roger North on Music</span>, 21, 298, 347). Knowledge of Stoeffken's own compositions has been greatly enriched through the discovery of four manuscripts of Dutch provenance: three belonging to the Go&euml;ss family at Schloss Ebenthal, near Klagenfurt, the other bought by the British Library in 1995 (MS Mus. Dep. 9562). Most are pieces for unaccompanied lyra viol, using various string tunings&#151;an area of performance in which he seems to have been regarded as peerless by those who heard him play.<br>
