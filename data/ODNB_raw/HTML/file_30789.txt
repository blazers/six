<span class="headword">Baring,  (Charles) Evelyn</span>, first Baron Howick of Glendale  (1903&#150;1973), <span class="occ">colonial governor and Commonwealth diplomat</span>, was born in Manchester Square, London, on 29 September 1903, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30583/', "Evelyn Baring, first earl of Cromer (1841&#150;1917)")</script>, and his second wife, Lady Katherine Georgiana Louisa Thynne (1865&#150;1933), daughter of the fourth marquess of Bath. He was educated at Winchester College and New College, Oxford, where he graduated with first-class honours in history in 1924.<br>
<br>Almost from birth Baring was destined&#151;and from an early age saw himself as destined&#151;for imperial service. While still a young boy he had visited his father, then consul-general in Egypt, in Cairo. He joined the Indian Civil Service in 1926, serving as an administrative officer in the United Provinces, first at Lucknow and later at Meerut. His work led him to his lasting interest in field administration, the problems of custom and religion, and the need for agricultural development. Indian service also took him in 1929 to South Africa as secretary to the Indian government's agent-general, and there Baring first came face to face with racial problems, which provided him with valuable experience for the future. In 1929 he returned to India for a tour of duty in the turbulent North-West Frontier Province, but in 1933 ill health forced him to return to Britain. Indifferent, at times poor, health was to dog him for the rest of his life; a damaged liver obliged him to become a teetotaller and he suffered frequent periods of exhaustion.<br>
<br>In Britain, Baring joined the family banking firm, working with trainee bankers. This experience of City of London life, which he did not particularly enjoy, was nevertheless subsequently to prove very useful, both in his governorship of Kenya and with the Commonwealth Development Corporation, providing him with some insight into and contacts with the world of finance. Later he left Barings to become a director of Sudan Plantations, concerned with cotton growing in Sudan, work that he found more congenial. On 24 April 1935 Baring married Lady Mary Cecil (Molly) Grey (1907&#150;2002), elder daughter of the fifth Earl Grey. They had one son and two daughters.<br>
<br>Being unfit for military service Baring joined the staff of the Foreign Office after the outbreak of war in 1939, his duties being concerned with Egypt, in particular the Egyptian economy. In Whitehall his abilities were recognized and in 1942, while still only thirty-eight years old, he was offered the appointment of governor of Southern Rhodesia. The territory had been given full internal self-government in 1923, with government in the hands of the white resident community who elected their own prime minister and produced their own administrative officials. The role of the governor, although a London appointee, was therefore in practice limited to tactful diplomacy and example. The white community was seeking to entrench its privileged position; Baring's views were the reverse, essentially liberal, and it was greatly to his credit that he managed to develop a close and friendly relationship with the territory's prime minister, Sir Godfrey Huggins, despite their differing views on the best future for Southern Rhodesia. Here Baring urged co-operation with the two northern Colonial Office territories, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, while Huggins remained cautious, fearing that an eventual amalgamation might prejudice Southern Rhodesia's white rule. In the day-to-day exercise of his governorship Baring took especial interest in African affairs, local customs and structures, African agriculture, and social development. These interests led to criticism from some among the white settler community, with whose blunt, at times rough, political voice Baring was always ill at ease.<br>
<br>In 1944 Baring was appointed high commissioner to the Union of South Africa, an appointment diplomatic in its aspect of relations with Pretoria, but also gubernatorial in that the high commissioner was, in practice, governor of the protectorates of Bechuanaland, Basutoland, and Swaziland. These territories had not been included in the Union of South Africa in 1910, but their incorporation had remained an aim of the union government. Baring's day-to-day diplomatic work with the union government remained smooth (and was facilitated by the visit of the royal family in 1947&#150;8) while Field Marshal Smuts remained in power. With the victory of the Nationalist Party under Dr D. F. Malan in 1948 difficulties arose, Nationalist racial policy with its early apartheid legislation being sharply criticized in Britain, where the Labour Party had come to power in 1945.<br>
<br>In the Smuts period Baring passed on the British government's reservations over South Africa's desire to move towards an annexation of the League of Nation's mandate territory of South-West Africa, and, after some negotiation, he secured the supply of South African uranium for Britain's nuclear weaponry. The question of the three &#145;high commission&#146; territories, however, was irreconcilable. At first Baring feared that the Churchill government might give the territories to Pretoria, despite clear local opposition. Later, especially after the return to power of the Nationalists, his fears centred on London's expressing such firm opposition to any transfer that the Commonwealth relationship with Pretoria would be damaged, possibly lost.<br>
<br>The issue was complicated by the marriage of the young Bechuanaland Bamangwato prince, Seretse Khama, to an English woman, at a time when one of the Malan government's early apartheid measures was to forbid mixed marriages. Opinion in the union, as expressed in the white media, was strident on the subject. Seretse's uncle Tshekedi, acting chief of the Bamangwato, also opposed the marriage but was soon faced with dwindling tribal support, Seretse himself becoming increasingly well regarded. Pretoria saw the issue as an added incentive for annexation. Baring's advice to a London where several changes of ministers added to the confusion was that British policy should be that of the lesser evil: Seretse should not succeed to the chieftainship, as British recognition would damage fatally relations with Pretoria and bring about conflict in Bamangwato society. Events were to prove him wrong on this, and the credit due to him for his rural development policies in the three territories has been overshadowed by criticism of his views on the Seretse issue.<br>
<br>In 1952, the year after his return from Pretoria, Baring received the most difficult and testing appointment of his career, the governorship of Kenya just at the moment of the outbreak of the Kikuyu Mau Mau uprising. The period of his governorship, 1952&#150;9, saw first the containment and then the virtual extinction of Mau Mau; fundamental political change, despite the Mau Mau troubles; impressive economic development; and programmes prepared for a massive expansion of African agriculture. Supported by a Colonial Office in London as anxious as he to see a return to order and development, Baring played the lead role in the last three of these ongoing events. From the start Baring appreciated that lasting peace could be secured only with at least the acquiescence, if not the full support, of the majority of the colony's population. In order to secure this Baring's experience and personal interests led him to devote much of his time and energy to economic development, which he saw as essential for the success of political change. Successive constitutional changes in the colony followed, providing for ministerial participation in the government by members of all races and extension of African representation in the legislature. Such developments were not welcomed by many of the European settlers, with whom Baring often found it as difficult to deal as he had in Southern Rhodesia. By diplomacy and tactful argument, however, he was able to secure the co-operation of the more liberal settler spokesmen, notably Michael Blundell.<br>
<br>The colony's remarkable economic development, which owed much to specific government intervention, together with the ending of unequal racially based salary scales in the public services, served to create an emerging African middle class which could appreciate that real political change had begun and would accelerate, and among the African peoples generally, including the Kikuyu, the realization that violence was unnecessary and undesirable.<br>
<br>Perhaps singly the greatest achievement of Baring's entire career was in Kenya's African agriculture, where he secured funds from Britain and the World Bank for the Swynnerton Plan, a total revolution in African farming based on redistribution, consolidation, efficient farming, and the opening up of new areas for cash crops, all aimed at creating self-sufficient peasant family holdings with one or more cash crops. The development of this policy was facilitated by emergency legislation resulting from the Mau Mau uprising, which provided the government with powers for compulsory resettlement of Mau Mau detainees in areas of the government's choice and of agricultural potential. By 1959 a highly successful African farmer class was growing cash crops previously reserved for European farms.<br>
<br>Baring found the role of governor of a colony at a time of a violent and bloody uprising exceedingly difficult and uncongenial. He himself suffered periods of debilitating ill health. The white farmers and some of the military, police, and administration felt that he was too weak. Nevertheless he was convinced that Mau Mau had to be fought and suppressed. He firmly believed that Jomo Kenyatta had been its instigator, and that Kenyatta's trial, despite highly dubious witnesses and a controversial conviction, had been just. He held that, in governing a turbulent country, a strong and efficient secretariat and provincial administrative officers loyally supported by the governor were as important as the military and police. However, a number of senior Kenya administrative officers, faced with daily violence in their districts, were deliberately less than frank with him (and with his attorney-general and police commissioner) when continuing systematic excesses leading to torture and deaths were committed by their local security forces. In particular, these centred on locally recruited police and home guards, and in the huge, overcrowded, and insanitary detention camps through which some 70,000 Kikuyu were processed for rehabilitation. The most notorious example was the attempt to conceal from Baring the true facts of the Hola prison camp scandal, where eleven prisoners were killed by prison staff. Baring believed the initial story that he had been given and advised the Colonial Office that the prisoners had died from drinking poisoned water. Later, revelation of the real cause created a major political and parliamentary crisis in London. It can justly be argued that Baring, in his conviction that Mau Mau was evil and had to be suppressed, did not exercise a proper supervision of the administration, which he believed he had to support to the hilt. He also authorized the establishment of emergency courts for a wide variety of capital crimes, some relatively minor, in which procedures, on occasions mass trials, were more brutally arbitrary than just, with a very large number of death sentences imposed.<br>
<br>This necessary criticism of one aspect having been made, overall Baring's governorship of Kenya was one of the most important and outstandingly successful in the decades of decolonization, well summarized in his <span class="italic">Times</span> obituary: &#145;he found it a land of danger and left it a land of hope&#146;  (12 March 1973). And it was for him a personal pleasure that in the last days of his governorship he saved, at considerable risk to himself, an Indian girl from drowning off the Kenyan coast. For this gallantry he was awarded the queen's commendation for brave conduct.<br>
<br>In 1960 Baring became deputy chairman of the Commonwealth Development Corporation, succeeding as chairman later in the year. Here his wide experience and personal prestige enabled him to secure funds from the British government, the World Bank, and other European governments for a series of partnerships for development projects. Among them were the Kenya Tea Smallholders scheme and the Swaziland Usutu Forests, which he had helped to start earlier in his career. Other programmes included tobacco curing in Malawi, wattle tanning in Tanzania, oil palm in Sarawak and the Solomon Islands, together with help for smallholders, loans to public utilities, and assistance to manufacturing and processing industries in a number of countries&#151;the range of the corporation's work being extended beyond the Commonwealth.<br>
<br>Baring was tall and distinguished in appearance, patrician&#151;at times a little aloof&#151;in style, and often a poor speaker. He was a very devout Christian. He possessed great strength of character and determination, at times ruthless but with his high intelligence ready to consider new ideas; ill health could, however, make him at times difficult to work with and slow to reach decisions. He was appointed KCMG in 1942, KCVO in 1947, GCMG in 1955, and KG in 1972. Baring received a hereditary barony in January 1960, taking the title of Lord Howick of Glendale. He had a passion for physical exercise, a characteristic that led to a fall while rock climbing and his death on 10 March 1973 in the Alnwick Hospital, Alnwick, Northumberland. He was buried in Howick churchyard, and was survived by his wife.<br>
