<span class="headword">Shakerley,  Jeremy <span class="st"> [Jeremiah]</span></span>  (1626&#150;1653?), <span class="occ">astronomer</span>, was born and baptized at Halifax, Yorkshire, in early November 1626, the son of William Shakerley and his wife, Judith Brig. His parents had married at Halifax on 7 February of that year; as Brig is also written in the registers as Brigge or Briggs, Jeremy could probably claim kinship with the mathematician Henry Briggs of Halifax. He records that he &#145;was brought up at a Free Schoole, and by the mediation of the Schoolemaster &hellip; went into Ireland continuing there until the Rebellion begun there, and then returning to my native place&#146;, and that from early 1647 he &#145;gave my mind to the Mathematicks&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Ashmole 243, fol. 117r). His correspondence with the astrologer William Lilly between January 1648 and March 1650 reveals that he was then living at Carr Hall, near Wheatley Lane, Pendle Forest, Lancashire, the home of the antiquarian Christopher Towneley, &#145;from whom meat and drinke is all I can expect&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Shakerley thus looked to Lilly to advance his career. He seems genuinely to have shared Lilly's enthusiasm for reforming astrology with the aid of modern astronomy; when another correspondent submitted a problem to his judgement, he declared that without such reform no reliable guidance could be provided. Concerns he mentioned to Lilly included predicting eclipses, translating the third book of Ptolemy, acting as amanuensis to the astrologer John Stephenson, for whom he calculated an ephemeris from Kepler's tables, and conversing with the mathematically minded Nathan Pighells. He composed annual almanacs, one of which was published as <span class="italic">Synopsis compendiariae, or, A Brief Description &hellip; MDCLI</span> (1651).<br>
<br>In February 1649 Shakerley announced that he would &#145;performe something against Wing&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Ashmole 243, fol. 117<i>r</i>). The result was <span class="italic">The anatomy of Urania practica: &hellip; laying open the errors and impertinencies delivered &hellip; by Mr Vincent Wing, and Mr William Leybourne, under the title of Urania practica</span> (1649). In this he argued that papers of the late Jeremy Horrocks (available to him through Towneley) provided a better basis than Wing's for astronomical calculations, especially in lunar theory. Wing replied in <span class="italic">Ens fictum Shakerlaei, or, The Annihilation of Mr Jeremie Shakerley</span> (1649). The dispute evidently worried Lilly, who had suggested the production of planetary tables in English but now declined to act as their patron. Shakerley records this in a letter of March 1650, and goes on: &#145;you taxe my tables for being the same with those of Jonas Moore &hellip; I make no doubt to cleare my selfe from your suspition of conspiring with Moore against you&#146;; he concluded that &#145;now you have rid your selfe of mee, you need not long be separated from the friendship of Mr Wing and Mr Leybourne&#146;  (ibid., fol. 128<i>r</i>). Here the correspondence ends. Shakerley's tables were published by Robert and William Leybourne as <span class="italic">Tabulae Britannicae: the British Tables</span> (1653), with a subtitle offering &#145;logistical arithmetic, the doctrine of the sphere&#146;, material on chronology, the calendar, and time, and &#145;the calculation of the motions of the fixed and wandering stars, and the eclipses of the luminaries. Calculated &hellip; from the hypothesis of Bullialdus and the observations of Mr Horrox&#146;. If the volume had any significant influence it was as a source of information about Horrocks's work.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Shakerley had sailed for the Far East, apparently under the auspices of the East India Company. One of his aims was to view a transit of Mercury predicted for 1651; an equivalent observation had been made only once before. A letter of 15 January 1653, addressed to Henry Osborne from Surat, on the north-west coast of India, shows that he successfully observed the transit, made other observations, and planned to collect records of Indian astronomy. He is believed to have died soon afterwards.<br>
