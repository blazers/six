<span class="headword">Hamilton,  Alexander  Douglas-</span>, tenth duke of Hamilton and seventh duke of Brandon  (1767&#150;1852), <span class="occ">aristocrat</span>, was born on 3 October 1767 in St James's Square, London, the elder son of Archibald (1740&#150;1819), the ninth duke, and Lady Harriet Stewart (<i>d</i>. 1788), fifth daughter of Alexander, sixth earl of Galloway. The marquess of Douglas (as he was known until 1819) was educated at Harrow School and Christ Church, Oxford. His earlier years were spent in Italy, where he acquired a taste for the fine arts. In 1801 he returned home, and in the following year was appointed colonel of the Lanarkshire militia and lord lieutenant of the county. He was whig MP for Lancaster, 1802&#150;6, and made his maiden speech on 22 March 1804 against an alteration in the <span class="roman">Militia Bill</span> proposed by Pitt. In 1806 he was sent as ambassador to the court of St Petersburg, and was sworn of the privy council. In the same year he was summoned to the House of Lords by writ, in his father's barony of Dutton. Recalled on the change of ministry in 1807, he remained in the interior of Russia and Poland until October 1808 on account of his infatuation with an &#145;old battered beauty&#146;, the Polish Countess Potocka  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>). He married, on 26 April 1810, his cousin-german, Susan Euphemia Beckford (1786&#150;1859), second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1905/', "William Beckford")</script>, and Lady Margaret Gordon, daughter of Charles, fourth earl of Aboyne. They had two children, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7939/', "William Alexander Anthony Archibald Douglas-Hamilton")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39436/', "Lady Susan Harriet Catherine Opdebeck")</script>, married first in 1832 to Lord Lincoln, afterwards duke of Newcastle, from whom she was divorced in 1850.<br>
<br>Douglas succeeded his father on 16 February 1819, as tenth duke of Hamilton in the peerage of Scotland. He was also duke of Brandon in the peerage of Great Britain and duke of Ch&acirc;telherault in the peerage of France, and was appointed a knight of the Garter in 1836. He was hereditary keeper of Holyroodhouse. He took no prominent part in the debates of the House of Lords. He was lord high steward at the coronations of William IV and Queen Victoria. He was a trustee of the British Museum, vice-president of the Royal Institution for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts in Scotland, FRS, and FSA. He died at his house, 12 Portman Square, London, on 18 August 1852.<br>
<br>The chief characteristic of the duke&#151;at least in his later days&#151;was his intense family pride. He firmly believed that as the descendant of the regent Arran he was the true heir to the throne of Scotland. For the same reason he was buried with &#145;oriental&#146; pomp (and a Presbyterian service), after the body had been embalmed, in an Egyptian sarcophagus, which was deposited in a colossal mausoleum erected near Hamilton Palace, in Lanarkshire. He showed intelligence in the improvement of his estates, and taste in the large collection of pictures and objects of virtu with which he adorned Hamilton Palace. This collection, which included the famous <span class="italic">Laughing Boy</span> of Leonardo da Vinci and other gems of art, together with a valuable collection of old books and manuscripts, part of which was made by Beckford, was auctioned by Sothebys in July 1882.<br>
