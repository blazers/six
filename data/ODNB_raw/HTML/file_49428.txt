<span class="headword">Frithestan</span>  (<em>d.</em> 932/3), <span class="occ">bishop of Winchester</span>, held the see from 909 to 931. Soon after his appointment, the two West Saxon bishoprics were divided into five and Winchester lost control of what is now Wiltshire and Berkshire to the new Ramsbury diocese. Frithestan is generally presumed to be the man of that name who witnessed as deacon two charters of 904 in which King Edward granted land to Old Minster, Winchester. An eighth-century manuscript of Sedulius's <span class="italic">Carmen Paschale</span>, which was bound with the Parker manuscript containing a version of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span>, has the inscription &#145;Frithestan <i>diacon</i>&#146; on its first page and is generally assumed to have once belonged to the bishop; William of Malmesbury comments that a number of books once owned by Frithestan were known in his day. Also surviving are a stole and maniples which, according to their inscription, were commissioned by Queen &AElig;lffl&aelig;d, wife of Edward the Elder, for the bishop; these were subsequently presented by King &AElig;thelstan to the shrine of St Cuthbert and are now preserved in Durham. The removal of the vestments from Winchester may have been linked with an apparent breach between Frithestan and Edward the Elder's eldest son and successor, &AElig;thelstan. Frithestan is notable for his absence from the witness lists of &AElig;thelstan's charters from the period of his coronation in 925 until 928, even on occasions when all other bishops were present. The reasons may be found in the succession disputes which followed the death of King Edward. The councillors of Wessex had chosen &AElig;lfweard (Edward's eldest son with his second wife, &AElig;lffl&aelig;d) as king and it was only &AElig;lfweard's death a few weeks after his father that had enabled &AElig;thelstan to become king in both Wessex and Mercia. William of Malmesbury records that Winchester was a centre of resistance to &AElig;thelstan and support may have continued there for Edward and &AElig;lffl&aelig;d's second son, Eadwine, who makes a rare appearance in a New Minster charter. Whatever Frithestan's involvement may have been, he reappears in the witness lists of royal charters in 928, which means that he was attending meetings of the king's councillors from that time, and in 929 he was recorded as a member of the confraternity of the monastery of St Gallen with other members of &AElig;thelstan's court.<br>
<br>At Winchester Frithestan was remembered for establishing good relations and common regulations between the Old and the New minsters. These included the provision that when a priest of either Old or New Minster died, members of both foundations would take part in the funeral observances. Frithestan's arrangements were continued by Bishop &AElig;thelwold (who was born in Winchester during Frithestan's episcopate) though adapted for monastic use. It was probably in Frithestan's time that a series of lateral chapels were added to the west end of the Old Minster. Frithestan resigned his position as bishop in 931 and died probably the following year, possibly 933, having continued to live in Winchester according to one tradition. He was buried in the Old Minster. There was an attempt to develop a cult of Frithestan in Winchester; he is included among the Old Minster saints in one recension of the list of saints' resting places and in some later Winchester martyrologies. However, the cult does not seem to have become well-established and William of Malmesbury records that in his day the whereabouts of Frithestan's tomb was not known.<br>
