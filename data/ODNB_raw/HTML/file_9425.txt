<span class="headword">Fin&aacute;n</span> <span class="st"> [St Fin&aacute;n]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 661), <span class="occ">missionary and bishop of Lindisfarne</span>, was an Irish monk of Iona who succeeded &Aacute;ed&aacute;n as second bishop of Lindisfarne in 651. No life of Fin&aacute;n is extant and the authority for what little is known about him is Bede's <span class="italic">Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum</span>, which was completed in 731.<br>
<br>Fin&aacute;n, like his predecessor &Aacute;ed&aacute;n, had been sent to Lindisfarne from Iona. Upon his succession to the bishopric of Lindisfarne, Fin&aacute;n built a church there suitable for an episcopal see  (Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 3.17). He had striking successes as a missionary, due in large part to the support he received from the powerful Northumbrian court. The first of these was his baptism of Peada, son of Penda, the heathen king of the Mercians. Having been appointed king of the Middle Angles by his father, Peada sought in marriage Alhfl&aelig;d, the daughter of King Oswiu of Northumbria. Oswiu would consent to this marriage only on condition that Peada and his people were converted and baptized Christians. When Fin&aacute;n had baptized Peada and many of his followers, Peada returned to his kingdom with four priests, who had been carefully selected to instruct and baptize his people. These four Northumbrian priests, Cedd, Adda, Betti, and Diuma, successfully spread Christianity to the Middle Angles and Mercians. After Penda was killed and Oswiu acquired his kingdom, the only Irishman among these four missionaries, Diuma, was consecrated the first bishop of the Middle Angles and the Mercians by Fin&aacute;n.<br>
<br>Fin&aacute;n's second missionary success was his baptism of the king of the East Saxons, Sigeberht, who had been persuaded to accept Christianity by his friend King Oswiu. Sigeberht subsequently requested that Oswiu send him teachers to convert his people. Cedd, who had been dispatched on the mission to the Middle Angles and Mercians, was recalled by Oswiu and sent with another priest to the kingdom of the East Saxons. When Cedd reported the success of this mission to Fin&aacute;n in Lindisfarne, Fin&aacute;n, with two other bishops, consecrated him bishop of the East Saxons.<br>
<br>Despite Fin&aacute;n's missionary successes, Bede does not represent him in a particularly favourable light, perhaps because of the bishop's obstinacy over the Easter question. The differences between the Irish and the Roman practices of Easter observance had been an issue in Anglo-Saxon England even during &Aacute;ed&aacute;n's episcopacy, but though Bede did not approve of &Aacute;ed&aacute;n's adherence to the Irish custom of computing Easter, he reports that this was patiently tolerated by all because &Aacute;ed&aacute;n was so greatly admired and loved for his virtuous character and exemplary work. Bede's attitude to Fin&aacute;n's observance of the Irish Easter, however, is remarkably different. He suggests that it was during Fin&aacute;n's time that this issue escalated into a bitter controversy, which was complicated by the conflicting interests of King Oswiu, who had become a firm supporter of Irish customs when exiled in Iona, and his wife, Eanfl&aelig;d, the daughter of King Eadwine, who had learned the Roman practice in Kent. It was further complicated by another Irishman, R&oacute;n&aacute;n, who defended the Roman practice of Easter he had learned in Gaul and Italy. Fin&aacute;n engaged in a violent dispute with him, and even though through it many were persuaded to accept the Roman practice, and others at least to question the truth concerning the correct observance of Easter, R&oacute;n&aacute;n did not succeed in altering Fin&aacute;n's convictions. Bede reports that &#145;on the contrary, as he was a man of fierce temper, R&oacute;n&aacute;n made him the more bitter by his reproofs and turned him into an open adversary of the truth&#146;  (Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 3.25). Rather than taking the view that Fin&aacute;n was faithfully following the example set by &Aacute;ed&aacute;n, Bede is extremely critical of Fin&aacute;n. It is possible that Fin&aacute;n had become a highly influential figure and that Irish influence was growing during his time (a phenomenon with which Bede was becoming increasingly uncomfortable). Bede's report that many in England went to Ireland during the episcopate of Fin&aacute;n and his successor, another Irishman named Colman, either to study or to pursue a more strict religious life  (Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 3.27) implies as much.<br>
<br>If Bede's knowledge of Fin&aacute;n derived from oral tradition preserved at Lindisfarne, the animosity underlying his characterization of him, despite Fin&aacute;n's successful missionary activities south of the Humber and the royal support he received from King Oswiu, might suggest that the bishop was not well thought of by his contemporaries. On the other hand, it is perhaps more likely that Fin&aacute;n was rather more powerful and successful than Bede would have cared to acknowledge; but, if he was in fact remembered as such, Bede could not ignore his achievements altogether and could only play them down. Although some Irish annals place Fin&aacute;n's death variously in 659 and 660, Bede states that he was bishop for ten years and died in 661  (Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 3.26).<br>
