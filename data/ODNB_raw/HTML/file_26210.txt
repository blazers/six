<span class="headword">Stafford,  John</span>  (1728&#150;1800), <span class="occ">Independent minister</span>, was born at Leicester in August 1728, probably the eldest son of the wool-comber John Stafford. At first he earned his living as a wool-comber, but he left this employment to devote himself to the work of the ministry, and in 1749 entered the Independent academy at Northampton, where he was prepared for the ministry by Philip Doddridge. On Doddridge's death in 1751 he went to the academy at Plaisterers' Hall, Addle Street, London, and finished his seven years' course of study under John Conder at Mile End.<br>
<br>Some of Stafford's earliest ministerial work was as a supply preacher at Royston, Hertfordshire, and St Neots, Huntingdonshire. In March 1758 he became co-pastor, with John Guyse, of New Broad Street Chapel in London and was ordained on 11 May in that year. He remained minister of New Broad Street until his death, forty-two years later. He married, on 31 July 1758, Hannah Blythe, daughter of Samuel Blythe. They had nine children, eight girls and a boy, five of whom predeceased both parents. The death at the age of fifteen, in 1774, of their eldest daughter, Elizabeth, caused him particular grief, and he published <span class="italic">A Sermon Occasioned by the Death of Elizabeth Stafford</span> in 1774. Stafford was not a prolific writer, and was the author of only one other work, which was published in 1772, <span class="italic">The Scripture Doctrine of Sin and Grace Considered in 25 Discourses on Romans VII</span>. This ran to a second edition in 1774 and earned him plaudits from such notable dissenting luminaries as Walter Wilson, John Ryland, and Edward Williams. His theology was rigidly Calvinistic.<br>
<br>Several years after Stafford's ordination his reputation suffered as a result of his having interpreted in favour of himself and his family the terms of a bequest providing for an annual sum to be paid for the time being to the minister of New Broad Street. A court of law decided in his favour on technical grounds, but accompanied the decision with a strong censure on his conduct. It was probably partly as a result of his laying claim to this money that he died a rich man with an estate worth several thousand pounds. From mid-summer 1799 Stafford became afflicted by violent stomach pains. He preached for the last time on 6 October 1799 and died at his house in Chiswell Street, Finsbury, on 22 February 1800. He was buried in Bunhill Fields, where his five children had been buried and where his widow was subsequently buried.<br>
