<span class="headword">Dodd,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1834), <span class="occ">musical instrument maker and music-seller</span>, was the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45874/', "Edward Dodd (1704/5?&#150;1810)")</script>, bow maker. His family moved from Sheffield to London and he was originally apprenticed to a firm of brewers. From 1786 to 1789 he worked as a bow maker in Blue Bell Alley, Mint Street, Southwark, and from 1794 he appears in city directories as a music-seller. He maintained a shop at 11 New Street, Covent Garden, from 1798 and became a successful dealer in instruments and music. Publications that bear his name as printer and vendor and quote this address include a treatise from around 1800 (which uses material originally by Francesco Geminiani) entitled <span class="italic">Compleat Instructions for the Violin</span>. The shop was at 92 St Martin's Lane, Charing Cross, from 1809 to 1826, and another branch producing harps and pianos was located at 3 Berner's Street from around 1819 until 1843. In that year Thomas's son Edward was drowned. Both he and his brother Thomas, who died while his father was residing in St Martin's Lane, were pupils of Bernhard Fendt and were involved with the instrument business, but neither managed to emulate their father's success.<br>
<br>Dodd's business produced violins, violas, cellos, and basses of excellent quality, using Stradivari, Guarneri, Amati, and Stainer models, but the construction of the instruments appears to have been the work of Fendt and John Frederick Lott. Dodd was responsible for what he described on his label as &#145;the original Cremona oil varnish&#146;, the formula for which was a closely guarded secret. It is therefore often the name of the dealer and not the maker that appears on the instrument labels and bows. Dodd almost certainly sold bows made by his brother John Dodd (1752&#150;1839), and Thomas Tubbs's bows are frequently found with the Dodd brand, as are thousands of inferior German bows from the end of the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Dodd died in London on 8 February 1834, and, according to a nephew, was buried at St Giles-in-the-Fields.<br>
