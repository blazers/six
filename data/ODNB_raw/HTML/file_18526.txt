<span class="headword">Melia,  Pius</span>  (1800&#150;1883), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest</span>, was born in Rome and joined the Society of Jesus at the age of sixteen. He became professor of literature at the Jesuit college in Rome, and afterwards served as a missionary priest in Corsica, Tuscany, and elsewhere. In 1848, when the society was dispersed, he went to England at the invitation of Cardinal Wiseman to minister to immigrant Italians and to act as confessor to the cardinal. He became a naturalized British subject on 13 September 1849.<br>
<br>After officiating at Lincoln's Inn, Melia was in charge of the mission at Hastings and St Leonards from 1850 to 1853. He then moved to Walthamstow, where he was missioner from 1855 to 1861, residing at 14 Gray's Inn Square, where he lived for the rest of his life. About 1853 he was appointed almoner to the Italian Benevolent Society, a post which he held until his death. He was Wiseman's private chaplain until the cardinal's death in 1865, after which he continued to preach the Sunday morning sermons at Brentwood, Essex.<br>
<br>Melia was closely associated with the Pallottini Fathers, in which society his brother Raphael Melia (<i>b</i>. 1804) served as rector-general from 1856 to 1862 and again from 1869. The Pallottines (known from 1854 to 1947 as the Pious Society of Missions) were founded in 1835 and were devoted to the spiritual welfare of Catholic emigrants, particularly from Italy. The society had gone to London in 1844, founding the Italian church of St Peter at Hatton Garden. Pius Melia helped to collect money for the building of the church, and regularly preached in Italian there. In 1863 he bought an action against the builder's solicitor, Neate, for false imprisonment; the builder, claiming that he had not been fully paid for his work, had had Melia imprisoned on the grounds that he was about to travel abroad.<br>
<br>In the late 1860s Melia spent some time in Italy. He read a laudatory article on the Waldensian sect in the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> in April 1868, which provoked him to write <span class="italic">The Origin, Persecution, and Doctrines of the Waldenses</span> (1870). Based on original documents which Melia had read in Roman libraries, the king's library at Turin, and elsewhere, it was a scholarly work which was &#145;regarded by competent judges as the standard work on the subject&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annual Register</span>). He also published <span class="italic">Doctrines of St Thomas Aquinas on the Rulers and Members of Christian States</span> (1860) and <span class="italic">Hints and Facts on the Origin of Man</span> (1872).<br>
<br>Melia died on 25 May 1883, after an operation, at the University College Hospital, London, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery on 30 May.<br>
