<span class="headword">Campbell, Dame  Janet Mary</span>  (1877&#150;1954), <span class="occ">medical officer</span>, was born in Brighton on 5 March 1877, the daughter of George Campbell, bank manager, and his wife, Mary Letitia Rowe. She attended Brighton high school and later went to Germany for some months; there she acquired a good knowledge of the language, which served her when she attended a postgraduate course in Vienna. After graduating MB in London in 1901 at the London School of Medicine for Women, Campbell took her MD and MS degrees in 1904 and 1905, a remarkable achievement. There followed house appointments in London at the Royal Free Hospital followed by the position of senior medical officer at the Belgrave Hospital for Children, a post eagerly sought by women graduates since at that time it was one of the few London hospitals to employ them.<br>
<br>Janet Campbell was a member of the Medical Women's Federation and eventually became its president. At one time she was closely associated with Dartford Physical Training College, first as honorary secretary and afterwards for a time as chairman. As a result of the South African War, public interest in the concern for national physique had been aroused and under the <span class="roman">Education Act</span> of 1902 school medical officers were appointed by some education authorities. An interdepartmental committee appointed in 1903 recommended, after extensive inquiries, among other measures the introduction of systematic medical inspection of children in elementary schools. In 1904 Campbell became an assistant school medical officer in the London school medical service, where she came under the stimulating influence of James Kerr, the &#145;father&#146; of school hygiene and author of <span class="italic">The Fundamentals of School Health</span> (1926). She went on to join the Board of Education as its first full-time woman medical officer in 1907.<br>
<br>The high rate of infant mortality was another issue giving concern to the public and to local authorities, and in 1919, when the Ministry of Health was formed with Sir George Newman as chief medical officer, Campbell was appointed senior medical officer in charge of maternity and child welfare. At the same time she retained her connection with the Board of Education as chief woman adviser. She gave her time and her energies wholeheartedly to the organization of a vigorous and progressive scheme for the welfare of mothers and children. During the First World War, in addition to her specialized work her services had been at the disposal of government and international committees; she later became a medical member of the war cabinet committee on women in industry, and from 1930 to 1936 served on the health committee of the League of Nations.<br>
<br>In 1917 Campbell wrote a valuable and influential report for the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust on the physical welfare of mothers and children. She also produced official reports on the recruitment and training of midwives and on the teaching of obstetrics and gynaecology in medical schools. In 1924 her well-known report on maternal mortality was published. She was appointed DBE, and Durham University made her an honorary doctor of hygiene in the same year. Her reports from 1923 to 1932 on the protection of motherhood, on neonatal and infant mortality, and on the maternity services all had an important influence on administrative reforms and helped in large part to reduce the mortality and morbidity rates of women and children.<br>
<br>In 1934 Dame Janet Campbell married Michael Heseltine (1886&#150;1952), registrar of the General Medical Council and the son of the Revd Ernest Heseltine. Under the rules of the civil service she had to give up her office, but her influence on the public health services of the whole country as they affected women and children was nevertheless profound. She was the great pioneer of maternity and child welfare services and as such was universally acknowledged. It was not only the charming and rather diffident manner of this tall, good-looking, well-dressed woman which attracted the admiration and respect of those who came into contact with her. Her clear-thinking brain and her sound knowledge of her subject enabled her to grasp essentials quickly so that her wise, considered opinion and advice were sought by local authorities, medical officers, and hospitals throughout the country and by organizations far beyond the confines of the United Kingdom.<br>
<br>Dame Janet was a very good horsewoman and riding gave her special pleasure, as did walking and physical exercise, which probably accounted for her upright carriage. Gardening was a favourite hobby and when she lived outside London she grew a wonderful display of roses. She had always taken a keen interest in current affairs and in the politics of the day, and she was a JP for both Surrey and Gloucestershire. She loved a good play and had a lifelong interest in modern literature and in the world around her. Towards the end of her life she lived with her two cousins in Chelsea. After a long and painful illness, when she was in a nursing home, she died on 27 September 1954 at 12 Hornsey Lane, Upper Holloway, London.<br>
