<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Zincke,  Christian Frederick</span>  (1684?&#150;1767), <span class="occ">miniature painter</span>, was born in Dresden, probably in 1684 (other accounts say 1683 or 1685). His father, Christian Zincke (<i>d</i>. 1719), and his grandfather, Paul Zincke (1608&#150;1678), were Dresden goldsmiths. Having learned enamelling and attended the drawing-school in Dresden conducted by Heinrich Christoph Fehling, he was invited to England either in 1704 or 1706 by Charles Boit, the leading practitioner of enamel portraiture. Boit had started a very large enamel commemorating the victory of Blenheim, and Zincke worked on this uncompleted project. He soon became proficient enough to form his own practice. On 4 November 1718 he married Elizabeth Tanton at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London. Their son, Christian Zincke, was baptized on 27 January 1724 at St Paul's, Covent Garden, London.<br>
<br>The earliest known signed work by Zincke is an enamel miniature of Sarah, duchess of Marlborough, based on a painting by Sir Godfrey Kneller and dated 1711 (Royal Collection). After Boit fled to France in 1714 to avoid his creditors Zincke enjoyed a near monopoly of enamel portraiture in England. The accession of George II in 1727 consolidated his position at court. The king, who usually hated sitting to painters, enjoyed Zincke's company and admired his portraits. Zincke was also patronized by Frederick, prince of Wales, who in 1732 made him his cabinet painter. He was complaining of eye strain in 1725, and in 1742 raised his price for an enamel from 20 guineas to 30, to reduce the demand for his work. He had effectively retired by about 1746 and at that time moved from Covent Garden to South Lambeth.<br>
<br>Vertue recorded in 1726 that Zincke &#145;has had more persons of distinction daily sitting to him than any other painter living&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 3.30). Although he copied other portraits he preferred to paint sitters <i>ad vivum</i>. His earlier works embody the staid qualities of Kneller and Michael Dahl, but his later miniatures have a more relaxed air. His handling at its best is exquisite. Horace Walpole owned one of his finest enamels, now in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge. Once regarded as a portrait of the poet Abraham Cowley, it is copied from a painting of an Arcadian shepherd by Sir Peter Lely. Shortly before he retired he made a remarkable portrait of Sir Robert Walpole (priv. coll.; another version in the Royal Collection). He was not always truthful in his images. George II asked him to paint Queen Caroline as if she were twenty-eight when she actually was forty-nine, and the queen urged him to make the king look twenty-four years younger. The similarity of his female portraits is satirized in a poem of 1740 describing a visit of Venus, Juno, and Minerva to Zincke's studio, during which each goddess takes a portrait of the poet's mistress Chloe to be her own.<br>
<br>The Royal Collection contains many enamels by Zincke of George II, Caroline of Ansbach, and Frederick, prince of Wales, and their other children. The numerous family portraits he made for Edward Harley, earl of Oxford, became part of the Portland collection at Welbeck Abbey, Nottinghamshire. There are many examples of his work in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, and other collections.<br>
<br>Zincke, who was short in stature, was not made vain by his success. When Philip Mercier tried to prevent him making an <i>ad vivum</i> portrait of the prince of Wales, leading to a bitter quarrel, Zincke was clearly in the right, and he seems to have been a well-loved character. The fact that he got on well with both George II and the prince of Wales testifies to his amenable temperament. An abstemious man, he generally drank port, though when Prince Frederick prophesied that Zincke would celebrate the treaty of Vienna in 1731 by getting drunk, he agreed that he would indulge himself in claret. On 25 May 1748 he married his second wife, Elizabeth Bothmar (<i>d</i>. 1772), at St George's, Hanover Square, London. A double portrait of him and his first wife was engraved in mezzotint after Hans Hysing by John Faber.<br>
<br>The portrait of Zincke drawn in 1752 by his friend William Hoare is an exceptionally informal representation of an artist at work; it shows him in retirement painting his daughter's portrait at a standard miniaturist's desk. Zincke died on 24 March 1767 at South Lambeth, Surrey; he was survived by his second wife. One of his sons was appointed to the six clerks office, chancery. A grandson, Paul Francis Zincke (<i>d</i>. 1830), attained notoriety as a faker of Shakespeare portraits; one of them, the &#145;Bellows&#146; portrait, belonged to the French actor Fran&ccedil;ois-Joseph Talma.<br>
