<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sheppard,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1595, <em>d.</em> 1674), <span class="occ">barrister and legal writer</span>, was baptized on 14 December 1595 at St Andrew's Church, Whitminster, near Frampton-on-Severn, Gloucestershire, the eldest of five children born to Philip Sheppard (<i>d</i>. 1623) and Elizabeth Tyrell. Two more sons and two daughters were born between 1597 and 1605 (Sarah, Rebecca, John, and Samuel), and in 1608 the family moved to Horsley in the Cotswold region south of Stroud.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearseducationandthecivilwar15951654"></a>Early years, education, and the civil war, 1595&#150;1654</h2>Horsley remained Sheppard's principal home until 1637. His first marriage, about 1617, to Mary of Wingfield, Wiltshire, brought them two children, John in 1618 and Mary in 1620; his wife apparently died soon after her daughter's birth. (John attended Wadham College, Oxford, and became a minister. Mary married John Clifford of Frampton.) In 1620 Sheppard was admitted to the Middle Temple where he was called to the bar in 1629. He retained the Temple lodgings he shared with William Hussey until 1631 when he returned to Horsley to establish a country law practice. In 1621 Sheppard married his second wife, Anne, daughter of George Worth of Buckington Manor, Wiltshire. Their children Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1623), Sarah (<i>b</i>. 1624), Samuel (<i>b</i>. 1627), and Anne (<i>b</i>. 1628) were baptized in Horsley. Another son, William, was born during that decade, possibly to his third wife, the Widow Fisher. In August 1637 when he married his fourth wife, Alice Coney, Sheppard moved to Hempsted, a parish bordering Gloucester, where his daughter Rebecca was born in 1649. Apart from three years spent in Cromwell's service in London, Hempsted remained his home for the rest of his long life.<br>
<br>In his native county and neighbouring areas Sheppard practised as a conveyancer and served as steward on several manors, presiding over their courts. He was an attorney of Gloucester's local court, and attended the great sessions of Wales, the Oxford and western circuit assizes, and quarter sessions; the legal texts he published are filled with citations to cases heard in those courts. His undoubted expertise in conveyancing is apparent in <span class="italic">The Touchstone of Common Assurances</span> (1648, not 1641 as often given; English edns to 1826, Irish edn 1785, United States edns to 1840&#150;41), a collection of twenty-three essays. Other early works reflecting his local country practice were several manuals for local law enforcement, <span class="italic">The Offices and Duties of Constables</span> (1641, rev. 1652, 1657), <span class="italic">The Court-Keepers Guide</span> (1649, 1650, 1654, 1656, 1662, posthumous edns in 1767 and 1791) for stewards of manor courts, and <span class="italic">The Whole Office of the Country Justice of the Peace</span> (1650, 1661, 1662). <span class="italic">An Exact Collection of Choice Declarations</span> (1653) by &#145;W. S., one of the clerks of the upper bench office&#146;  (title-page) was incorrectly attributed to Sheppard by the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>. It was written by William Small, a clerk of the king's bench. Sheppard's initial effort to compile a legal encyclopaedia, the two-part <span class="italic">The Faithfull Councellor, or, The Marrow of the Law in English</span> (1651 and 1654), was the base for later works. In each of these books Sheppard presented in English an updated account of the law with clear and concise definitions and citations to recent cases. His goal from his first to his last publication was to clarify current law in the interest of accessibility to justice.<br>
<br>Sheppard's commitment to legal reform was mirrored by a passion for religious reform, and his call by Cromwell owes as much to his religious commitment as to his proven legal skills. His first two religious publications (both 1649) were a catechism dedicated to the people of Gloucester and an essay on salvation. His argument of 1652 advocating lay preaching identified Sheppard as a follower of John Owen and the Independents and was undoubtedly critical in bringing him to Cromwell's attention.<h2>
<a name="Theprotectorateyears16541657"></a>The protectorate years, 1654&#150;1657</h2>Sheppard was summoned to London in the spring of 1654 to advise Cromwell on legal matters and to create a law reform programme. There are strong inferential grounds that Sheppard drafted the chancery ordinance, a reform document issued in August 1654, and internal evidence&#151;a determination to avoid delays, reduce costs, and eliminate corruption through regulating procedure&#151;reflects Sheppard's approach to reform. Despite opposition, Cromwell implemented the ordinance in 1655 and it remained in effect until 1658.<br>
<br>Sheppard's outstanding achievement and the centrepiece of his contribution to the protectorate was <span class="italic">England's Balme</span> (1656, but 1657 on the title page). Dedicated to Cromwell &#145;and your council, by whose care it hath been brought forth&#146;, it was the fullest design for the reform of English law published in the seventeenth century. In it Sheppard gathered &#145;other men's grievances&#146;, including reforms advocated by earlier writers, and wove them into an original scheme, producing a plan notable for the comprehensiveness of its scope. A number of his recommendations were drafted as bills presented to the parliament of 1656, and the guiding principles and many particular reforms were adopted in the nineteenth century. A central tenet was the legal unification of England, with the fusion of law and equity in an integrated appellate judicial system, uniformity of process, abolition of special pleading and of benefit of clergy, reduction of capital crimes and abolition of imprisonment for debt, registration of title, simplified conveyancing, county courts for small claims, defendants in felony cases allowed counsel and sworn witnesses, and a number of social reforms. One jarring note in this package of essentially moderate reforms is a provision that &#145;godless and wicked men &hellip; dangerous in their principles &hellip; or notoriously wicked or scandalous &hellip; so long as they continue so, be incapable of any office in the commonwealth&#146;  (W. Sheppard, <span class="italic">England's Balme</span>, 1656, 41&#150;2). Predicated on Sheppard's belief that only godly men &#145;who declare the power of godliness in their lives&#146; and a second rank of &#145;all sober and civil men&#146; were fit to rule, his aim was to establish a new political order based upon a reformed law made more rational, simpler, and more humane  (ibid.). Looking to the example of the Massachusetts Bay colony settlement for many of his ideas, he hoped to bring the laws and the governance of England into closer accord with the laws of God.<br>
<br>Sheppard prepared nine books to support the protector's agenda for reform during the three years he served as Cromwell's legal adviser (June 1654 &#150; August 1657). To ensure support for a preaching ministry, <span class="italic">The Parson's Guide</span> providing guidance on tithe collection was issued three times in 1654. A handbook of warrants used by justices of the peace was published the same year (1654, updated edns 1660, 1672). In 1655 <span class="italic">A View of All the Laws &hellip; Concerning the Service of God or Religion</span> set out the legal framework of the religious settlement that had been promulgated by ordinance in 1654. Published to serve immediate goals of the administration, these works were short-lived. In contrast, <span class="italic">The President [Precedent] of Presidents</span> (1655, edns to 1870) was issued in at least ten editions. A companion volume to his <span class="italic">Touchstone</span> (1648), it introduced standard forms to register land and was endorsed by the government newspaper as a conveyancing precedent &#145;of singular use and profit to all men&#146;  (<span class="italic">Publick Intelligencer</span>, 10 Feb 1656, 280). In April 1656 his <span class="italic">A Survey of County Judicatures</span> called for the reinvigoration of ancient courts to hear suits of small value, and the same month the fourth edition of his <span class="italic">Court-Keepers Guide</span>, also a review of local jurisdictions, was recommended in the government newspaper, the <span class="italic">Publick Intelligencer</span> (21 April 1656, 509). Official approval of Sheppard's work was signalled by renewing his annual salary of &pound;300 in January 1656, by the February appointment of a committee to consider his law reform proposals, and by the introduction of bills for both land registration and country courts to the second protectorate parliament in September. In May 1656 Sheppard's second legal encyclopaedia, <span class="italic">An Epitome of All the Common and Statute Laws of the Nation now in Force</span> (1656), was printed &#145;by his highness's special command&#146;  (title page). His last assignment under the protectorate provided material for his 1659 book, <span class="italic">Of Corporations, Fraternities, and Guilds</span>, the first book in English on the law of corporations which included the texts of five Cromwellian charters. In June 1656 the council of state assigned Sheppard to head a commission that prepared or revised at least fourteen corporation charters for boroughs throughout England and Wales.<br>
<br>The zenith of Sheppard's public career came in October 1656 when the government created him a serjeant-at-law just weeks after <span class="italic">England's Balme</span> was published. He continued working on borough charters until August 1657 when his employment under the protectorate government ended. Sheppard was paid some back salary owed him and he returned to his family and his country practice.<h2>
<a name="LaterpublicationsandtheRestorationyears16571674"></a>Later publications and the Restoration years, 1657&#150;1674</h2>Back in Hempsted and faced with financial hardship Sheppard petitioned Cromwell in November 1657 for &#145;some office or place to continue some part of [my] salary&#146;. Finding that his association with the protectorate government was &#145;distasteful to many&#146; and he had &#145;lost his law practice utterly in his country&#146;, the petition noted that he had five children of his own and the widow and three children of his son John, a minister, in his household, &#145;all as yet unprovided for&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 18/157/131, fol. 150). The council authorized an annual pension of &pound;100, but no record of payments has been discovered. His final religious work, <span class="italic">Of the Foure Last and Greatest Things: Death, Judgement, Heaven and Hell</span>, was published in April 1658 in collaboration with Thomas Barlow, provost of Oxford's Queen's College. Sheppard, who returned to writing legal texts, heard no more from Westminster until September 1659, when he was called back into the political arena by the restored Rump Parliament and appointed to the Welsh bench and sworn as chief justice of the north Wales circuit. That autumn two works written during his service to Cromwell were published, <span class="italic">A New Survey of the Justice of Peace</span> (1659) and the more important <span class="italic">Of Corporations</span> (1659).<br>
<br>At the time of the Restoration, Sheppard was sixty-five years old, and in the remaining years of his life he published another seven books, principally dealing with local law enforcement and property law, topics that had long occupied his attention, but with two innovative studies, <span class="italic">Action upon the Case for Slander</span> (1662) and <span class="italic">Actions upon the Case for Deeds</span> (1663), both reprinted in the 1670s without the lengthy case illustrations. An entirely new handbook for magistrates, <span class="italic">A Sure Guide to his Majesties Justices of the Peace</span> (1662), bravely criticized the intolerance of the Restoration religious settlement, introducing legal arguments to soften persecution. A short manual, <span class="italic">Of the Office of the Clerk of the Market</span> (1665), illustrates Sheppard's indefatigable drive to define yet another local office. <span class="italic">The Practical Counsellor in the Law</span> (1671) and <span class="italic">The Law of Common Assurances</span> (1669) together constituted an enlargement on the <span class="italic">Touchstone</span>, but the added material did not improve upon the original. His final work, <span class="italic">A Grand Abridgment of the Common and Statute Law of England</span> (published posthumously in 1675), was a partly rewritten expansion of his two earlier encyclopaedias, <span class="italic">Faithfull Councellor</span>, 1 and 2 (1651, 1653) and <span class="italic">The Epitome</span> (1656).<br>
<br>Sheppard died on 26 March 1674 at Hempsted, Gloucestershire, and was buried in the nave of St Swithin's Church, Hempsted, four days later. His widow, Alice, died on 29 July 1693 and was buried with her husband.<h2>
<a name="Historicalsignificancechanginginterpretationsoflifeandcareer"></a>Historical significance&#151;changing interpretations of life and career</h2>Over a thirty-three-year writing career Sheppard produced forty-nine editions of his twenty-three books on the law and there is a fundamental consistency in the considerable contributions to legal literature of this formidably industrious and productive author. He broke new ground in the literature of actions on the case, the law of corporations, and standardized precedents for land records. His manuals for local officials updated and often improved on earlier efforts and are valuable for what they reveal about the way the law actually functioned in his generation. His three encyclopaedic compilations, which combined statutes, case law, and legal definitions, were the first published in English. They were, by the author's admission, incomplete, yet they demonstrate Sheppard's confidence that, with the right tools, the law could be made accessible and the legal system more efficient. The nine books he prepared for the protectorate typify the pragmatic reforms of Cromwell's administration and add an authoritative dimension to the evidence supporting Cromwell's reputation as an advocate of law reform. Sheppard's master-work of law reform proposals, <span class="italic">England's Balme</span>, the most comprehensive law reform document of this fruitful period, clearly places Sheppard in the historical continuum with Finch and other earlier reformers and the moderate lawyers who supported Cromwell. The failure of his programme can be partly explained by opposition from powerful forces within the legal establishment as well as challenges in the political realm, and the book was largely forgotten or ignored for more than a century. It is to Sheppard's credit that he never lost his confidence that the law could be made more rational and humane, and his tenacity in pursuing this goal is remarkable.<br>
<br>Sheppard's two most influential books endured for two centuries and served the profession well. In the <span class="italic">Touchstone</span> (1648, edns to 1840&#150;41) and <span class="italic">The President</span> (1655, edns to 1870), he wrote clearly on the subject he knew best. The political discredit arising from his close association with Cromwell may have led to the allegation in 1760 that Sheppard plagiarized the <span class="italic">Touchstone</span>'s text from a manuscript found in John Doddridge's library. This charge was written by J. Booth of Lincoln's Inn on the title page of his copy, the story admittedly emanating from third-hand hearsay. Edward Hilliard, editor of the 1780 edition of the <span class="italic">Touchstone</span>, published the accusation as did later editors. Years later R. W. Bridgman in <span class="italic">A Short View of Legal Bibliography</span> (1807) and John Clarke in <span class="italic">Bibliotheca legum</span> (1810) disputed the allegation, noting that much of the text was grounded in material not available until the year of Doddridge's death (1628). Sheppard most certainly wrote the book himself, but the slur on his reputation persisted and was repeated by John Hutchinson in <span class="italic">A Catalogue of Notable Middle Templars</span> (1902), pages 223&#150;4; W. R. Williams in <span class="italic">A History of the Great Sessions in Wales</span> (1899), page 60; P. H. Winfield in <span class="italic">The Chief Sources of English Legal History</span> (1925), pages 240&#150;41; W. L. Holdsworth in <span class="italic">A History of English Law</span> (1923&#150;37), volume 5, page 83, and by others. The evidence distinctly supports Sheppard's authorship and the <span class="italic">Touchstone</span> remained the best introduction to conveyancing in that 200-year period.<br>
