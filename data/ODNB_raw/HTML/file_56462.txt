<span class="headword">Hardwicke,  Robert</span>  (1822&#150;1875), <span class="occ">publisher</span>, was born on 2 October 1822 at Dyke, near Bourne, Lincolnshire, the third son of William Hardwicke, farmer (or butcher) and his wife, Mary. Nothing is known of his early education, but by 1897 he had obtained his articles as a printer. In that year he became a partner in the firm of Salisbury and Bateman, printers, of 4 Clement Court, near Lincoln's Inn in London. By 1850 the firm had moved and become Bateman and Hardwicke, printers, publishers, stationers, and booksellers, and in 1852 Hardwicke set up on his own at 192 Piccadilly.<br>
<br>Initially Hardwicke published general titles, but he had a lifelong interest in natural history, especially botany. His older brother William, a surgeon in private practice, introduced him to Edwin Lankester (1814&#150;1874). Lankester was very active in the contemporary movement for the popularization of science and Hardwicke subsequently published a number of works by him, and by his botanist wife, Phebe. Lankester introduced Hardwicke to the Ray Society (established in 1844 for the publication of works concerning natural history), for which he eventually published thirty-six titles. Lankester also introduced Hardwicke to M. C. Cooke, then about to start his remarkable mycological career. Hardwicke subsequently commissioned Cooke's first book on fungi, an example of his &#145;judgement [to which] many valuable and popular books owe their existence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of the Quekett Microscopical Club</span>). However, he had a hard head for business too, and both Cooke and T. H. Huxley complained of his treatment of them on occasion. Most of Hardwicke's publications were in the popular field, but his medical list was almost entirely professional and technical, the authors doubtless having been recommended to him by his brother.<br>
<br>In 1861 Hardwicke started a quarterly journal, the <span class="italic">Popular Science Review</span>, and three years later Cooke proposed an even more popular magazine, the monthly <span class="italic">Hardwicke's Science Gossip</span> which flourished for many years. Hardwicke's growing contribution to biological science was recognized in 1863 when he was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society for his interest in &#145;the progress of natural history, especially botany&#146;.<br>
<br>A number of Hardwicke's authors had been meeting regularly on his premises for several years for informal discussions and in 1865 Cooke, Hardwicke, and his manager, Thomas Ketteringham, formalized this arrangement by setting up the Quekett Microscopical Club with Lankester as president and Hardwicke as treasurer. Membership rose rapidly, excursions were organized, and a journal published, and the club still flourishes.<br>
<br>Hardwicke was reported to be a warm and attractive character, portly, but with a pleasant face. His genial temperament allowed him to make friends easily. He had a wife, Harriet Martha; no details are known about her, and the couple had no children. Hardwicke died suddenly on 8 March 1875 at the age of fifty-two, following a stroke suffered while travelling to work from his home at 1 Versailles Villas, Upper Norwood. He died at 24 Queen Square, Bloomsbury.<br>
<br>In 1863 Hardwicke had made an error of judgement, undertaking the publication of Smith and Sowerby's multi-volume <span class="italic">English Botany</span> which, with its numerous hand-coloured illustrations, was extremely expensive for so small a firm to produce; indeed, it almost bankrupted it, so that on his death Hardwicke left under &pound;1500 and leaseholds. The combination in Hardwicke of a sound knowledge of biology, encouragement of promising new authors, and an enthusiasm for popularizing natural history make his contribution to the science of his time a unique one.<br>
