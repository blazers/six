<span class="headword">Cable,  (Alice) Mildred</span>  (1878&#150;1952), <span class="occ">missionary and author</span>, was born on 21 February 1878 in Sydenham Road, Guildford, the daughter of John Cable, master draper and sometime borough councillor and magistrate, and his wife, Eliza Kindred. From early youth she believed that she had a missionary vocation, and while still at Guildford Girls' High School she began training with the China Inland Mission. Confirmed in her intentions, she went to London to receive formal training as a pharmacist, taking courses which would be useful in her future endeavour including anatomy, surgery, and midwifery, and qualifying as MPS. Her plans were seriously threatened when the Boxer uprising in 1900 disrupted Chinese missionary work; and this was further compounded by the ending of a love affair, to which she only ever made one public reference, in the spiritual autobiography, <span class="italic">Something Happened</span> (1934), where, thirty-five years after the event, she described receiving news which made a &#145;goblin of the sun&#146; and where &#145;the brightest things of life burnt themselves to ashes&#146;  (p. 75).<br>
<br>Despite these set-backs Cable left England for China in September 1901, as soon as it was safe for missionaries to return there. She was sent to Huozhou in Shanxi province, where she joined the veteran missionary <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33269/', "Evangeline French (1869&#150;1960)")</script> in setting up a girls' school, which eventually developed into a women's teacher training college. They also campaigned against foot binding and were active in the rehabilitation of opium addicts. In 1907 they were joined by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33270/', "Francesca Law French (1871&#150;1960)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33269/', "French, Evangeline")</script>], younger sister of Evangeline, and, as the Trio, they were to spend the rest of their lives together.<br>
<br>Cable was committed to the idea of an indigenous church, and sought to involve Chinese Christians in all areas of their mission. She believed that their work in Huozhou could be self-sustaining and that her skills might be more usefully exploited in areas still relatively untouched by the protestant missionary movement. It was with this intention that she gained permission to initiate a mission in north-west China. The Trio left Shanxi in June 1923 and arrived in Jiuquan in Gansu province in late 1924. After establishing a base and native church at Jiuquan they devoted the next thirteen years to travelling, by mule cart, across the trade routes of the Gobi Desert, &#145;gossiping the Gospel&#146;, as Cable described their method of proselytizing; leaving biblical tracts in hostelries, visiting country fairs, and disseminating their Christian message on a personal level by befriending local people.<br>
<br>It is for the Trio's work in this part of central Asia that they were to become widely known in missionary circles and also to the British public. While their numerous journeys across the Gobi Desert were motivated by their evangelical calling, the hardships and frequent dangers endured made them pioneer women travellers and explorers of this region, and they were the first British women to visit the city of Urumchi. Their work was frequently obstructed by growing political disturbance, and Cable's medical skills, which saved the life of Muslim warlord Ma Zhangying, proved a valuable passport to their own survival. She was recognized as a leading authority on the Gobi Desert, and her most famous book, of eponymous title, was published in 1942. It was in recognition of that expertise that she was awarded the Lawrence memorial medal by the Royal Central Asian Society in 1942, and, with the French sisters, the Livingstone memorial medal of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society in 1943.<br>
<br>Although Cable was the youngest of the Trio she soon established herself as its dominant partner. The numerous books published while they were in China and afterwards, though written with Francesca French, were largely Cable's work, and their tone and views more accurately reflect her own personality. Cable described herself as someone for whom faith was difficult, but she seemed not always to appreciate that this might also be true for the people among whom she evangelized. While generally appreciative of the various cultures in that part of China, she maintained a horror of all forms of idolatry, a prejudice which is reflected in her descriptions of Tibetan lamaism and, occasionally, in the methods of the mission's Roman Catholic rivals.<br>
<br>In 1936, as China collapsed into further political instability and Soviet influence increased in the north-west, the Trio were finally forced to leave. On their return to England, Cable immediately threw herself into the work of the British and Foreign Bible Society and, as its vice-president and chairman of the women's committee, it was to the service of this organization that she devoted the rest of her life. Cable and Francesca French toured England and Wales on the society's behalf and, in 1947, the Trio visited Australia, New Zealand, and India as part of their ongoing missionary project. In 1951 they were invited to Brazil by the Evangelical Union of South America, and Cable was enthusiastic about the future of the protestant church in that part of the world.<br>
<br>Cable was of medium height with hair, turned grey at a young age, scraped back in a bun, and dark rings around her eyes which made her look rather like a panda. She was generally seen as a formidable and rather intimidating personality, which earned her the nickname Napoleon among Bible Society activists. Her life was shared in total companionship with the French sisters and as a guardian to Eileen Guy, a Tibeto-Mongolian deaf mute adopted in Jiuquan in 1925. Cable died on 30 April 1952 at her London home, 13 Buckingham Mansions, West End Lane. She was cremated at Golders Green on 6 May. She bequeathed her estate to the French sisters and, after their deaths, to Eileen Guy.<br>
