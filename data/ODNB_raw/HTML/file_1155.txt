<span class="headword">Baldock,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1327), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was of obscure origins, but was probably born in Baldock in Hertfordshire. He was an executor, and almost certainly a relative, of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1154/', "Ralph Baldock (d. 1313)")</script>, bishop of London (1306&#150;13) whose family name, the Pauline annalist suggests, was Catel. His brother Richard was a royal clerk. He was educated at Oxford, where he was BCL by 1294, and also entered royal service. Named king's clerk in 1316, he embarked upon a number of diplomatic missions in France and Scotland, before in January 1320 assuming custody of the privy seal. He remained keeper until 7 July 1323, being the first holder of the office to take an important role in a wider political and administrative sphere. This arose from the confidence placed in him by Edward II&#151;he is occasionally described as his secretary&#151;and by the younger Hugh Despenser, whose prot&eacute;g&eacute; he seems to have been. He reunited the office of keeper with that of controller of the wardrobe, thereby circumventing an intention of the ordinances of 1311. Other activities often prevented Baldock from discharging all the responsibilities of these dual offices in person. Thus he was scheduled to accompany the king abroad in the spring of 1320 and in anticipation located his household at Wissant. He did go to the continent in June when he left behind a &#145;small seal of absence&#146;. In September of the same year he was appointed to treat with Robert I of Scotland and on 3 December received safe conduct for attending to royal affairs in various parts of the realm.<br>
<br>The Bridlington chronicler cited as a grievance of the lords assembled at Sherburn in Elmet (28 June 1321) the fact that the keeper and other officers had been appointed contrary to the ordinances and were the source of novelties, evils, and oppressions. In July of that year Baldock was named first among the evil and false councillors whom the younger Despenser had allegedly appointed for the disinheritance and destruction of magnates and people. But his rise continued. He succeeded Bishop Salmon as chancellor on 20 August 1323 and in November of the following year was a commissioner for negotiating peace with the Scots. He retained the chancellorship until 26 October 1326, by which time the king was a fugitive.<br>
<br>Despite Edward's efforts Baldock was the only chancellor of the reign who was not supported by the resources of a bishopric. This may be attributed in part to the deliberate policy of Pope John XXII, and in part to the opportunism of other potential candidates, coupled with Baldock's unpopularity at the curia. And so the king's attempts to secure for him the sees of Coventry and Lichfield, Winchester, and Norwich, in 1321, 1323, and 1325 respectively, all came to nothing. He did secure a number of canonries and the archdeaconry of Middlesex, but this and most of the canonries were for varying periods subject to litigation. The king's attempt to give him the Lincoln prebend of Aylesbury in 1322 led to an acrimonious conflict at Avignon which lasted for the remainder of the reign. He was summoned to the curia, and in 1324 excommunicated.<br>
<br>His close association with their regime meant that Baldock shared the intense unpopularity of Edward II and the Despensers; in particular he was held responsible for the measures against bishops Stratford, Orleton, Burghersh, Hotham, and Droxford. He stayed by the king in his retreat from London in October 1326 and was captured with him and the younger Despenser in the neighbourhood of Neath Abbey on 16 November. At Hereford he was claimed as a clerk by Bishop Orleton, who allegedly took him to London to answer in convocation for his misdeeds. A mob, claiming infringement of the city's liberties, dragged Baldock from Orleton's house, Monthalt, and lodged him in Newgate gaol where, miserably abused, he died on 28 May 1327. He was buried in the cemetery of the canons, St Paul's, London.<br>
