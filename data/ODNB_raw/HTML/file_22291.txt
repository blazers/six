<span class="headword">Pindar, Sir  Paul</span>  (1565/6&#150;1650), <span class="occ">merchant and diplomat</span>, was born in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, the second son of Thomas Pindar of that town. Originally intended for the university, he chose instead a mercantile career. Following his apprenticeship to a London merchant engaged in the Italian trade, he was sent to Venice, where he was to serve as his master's factor. While there he prospered, both acting on commission for others and trading on his own account. In 1602 he was said to be managing some of the Italian investments of Sir Robert Cecil. Such activities both reflected and furthered a detailed knowledge of Italian&#151;and more especially Venetian&#151;banking systems; this bore fruit in the later years of James I's reign in Pindar's interesting, though disregarded, proposal for the establishment of an English national bank which would benefit the crown by furnishing &#145;exacte knowledge of the trewe estate of everye perticular man, by meanes wherof dewties might be Imposed proportionable to the effectuall valliditie of mens trewe Estates&#146;. While this consideration alone might account for the failure of such proposals to attract the English mercantile community&#151;at least before 1694&#151;even more significant was Pindar's suggestion that deposits in the bank would provide a potential source of loanable funds &#145;uppon which his Majestie may prevayell at pleazure eyther by Consente or withoute the privitie of the Propryetaryes at all tymes&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 108, art. 90).<br>
<br>From 1609 Pindar became involved in commercial diplomacy as the consul of the English merchants at Aleppo and, after 1611, as English ambassador at Constantinople, an appointment virtually in the gift of the Levant or Turkey Company at this time. He was knighted in 1620 during a prolonged visit to England, but appears not to have resettled in the country permanently until 1623. During the reign of Charles I much of the great wealth which he had accumulated abroad went into the management of the great and petty customs farms, of which he became the dominant figure, as he was also in the less important farm of the tobacco subsidy from 1632. He also invested in and managed the farm of the royal alum manufacture in Yorkshire in 1628. A notable white elephant during the previous reign, the alum business prospered under the efficient management of Pindar and his partner, William Turner, with the result that the king was able to grant the reversion of the lease of the farm to Sir John Gibson in June 1630 at an annual rent of &pound;12,500, an improvement of &pound;1500 on that paid by Pindar and Turner. In 1640 Pindar bought up the remainder of the lease, which he held until 1647 when he was ousted by a parliamentary order in favour of the earl of Mulgrave. However, over the first decade and a half of the reign Pindar's other interests were dwarfed by his massive customs-farming concerns, in which he had not only an investor's interest but also that of an active entrepreneur and director. He employed his wealth and business acumen to acquire a directoral power amounting to little less than complete predominance, buying up shares of subsidiary partners in order to obtain a controlling interest. The farmers' heyday was reached during the 1630s with syndicated loans of increasing size and longer duration anticipating their rents years in advance as well as granting large overdrafts to the crown by honouring a far greater amount of tallies than the rent could bear.<br>
<br>This golden period (for Pindar) ended in July 1637. Following the accession of Bishop William Juxon to the office of lord treasurer the security which Pindar and his fellow concessionaires had enjoyed under Lord Treasurer Portland and the succeeding treasury commission vanished almost overnight. Whether or not Juxon was, as one account maintained, the &#145;creature&#146; of the courtly multi-concessionaire Lord Goring  (BL, Stowe MS 326, fols. 62(b)&#150;63), he now proposed that the existing farmers should join forces with Goring and his associates, Sir Nicholas Crisp, Sir Job Harby, and Sir John Nulls. But this proposal, and its corollary that the farmers should raise money to be lent to the king on joint security rather than on their individual credits, was acceptable to only one member of the existing syndicate of farmers of the great customs, and Pindar and the others withdrew. For a short time Pindar played dog-in-the-manger to the new farming syndicates by associating himself with John Harrison's project for the renationalization of the customs revenue. But this was a short-lived episode curtailed by a personal appeal from Charles I that Pindar should rejoin his former colleagues, to which Pindar agreed, moved to tears by the king's plea that his crown itself was in jeopardy in the desperate financial situation due to the Scottish war and the new farmers' inadequate response to his needs. Harrison yielded to a similar request and the great and petty farms were let to combinations of the new and old syndicates (led by Pindar and minus Goring) from Christmas day 1640 and Lady day 1641 respectively. Pindar had already underlined his own indispensability by his massive personal loans to the crown in 1638&#150;9, when he advanced in all about &pound;93,000, &pound;8000 of which was for a large pendant diamond for the king in May 1638. &#145;This Sir Paul&#146;, observed Sir Edmund Rossingham, &#145;never fails the King when he has most need&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1639</i>, 3). His loans to others were also impressive; for example &pound;36,000 was fruitlessly advanced in 1635 towards the charges of Sir William Courteen's interloping East India expedition, while in October 1637 &pound;18,620 was reckoned to be due to Pindar for his advances to the naval treasurer, Sir William Russell, for payment of seamen's wages in anticipation of the receipts of ship money.<br>
<br>The newly reconstituted syndicates of customs farmers responded spectacularly to the royal needs. It is uncertain how many of the tallies directed upon them by the crown were honoured, but certainly their advances amounted to at least &pound;100,000, so that the sum of &pound;253,000 reckoned to be due to them for principal and interest after the Restoration cannot be very far out. In May 1641 Pindar and the other farmers were ordered by the Long Parliament to pay a fine of &pound;150,000 in order to compound for their delinquency in collecting customs duties which parliament had never voted. Their leases were sequestered and all prospect of their loans being repaid in the foreseeable future consequently disappeared. The same is true of Pindar's individual advances to the king which had been assigned upon different branches of the royal revenue down to Christmas 1645, since effectively that revenue was no longer the king's to dispense. In the circumstances it is hardly surprising that Pindar returned a temporizing reply to a parliamentary request for a loan of &pound;20,000 in 1643. Far from aiding the parliament which had penalized him two years earlier, he was engaged in shipping gold to the king at Oxford. In 1650 he offered his services to the now pretender, Charles II, who proposed that he should act as treasurer of the money which was being clandestinely collected on the royal behalf. Nothing came of this since Pindar died on 22 August. He was buried on 3 September in an enormous lead coffin in St Botolph without Bishopsgate, London, a church which, along with others in his native Northamptonshire, had been a beneficiary of his largess. St Paul's Cathedral had also benefited from his generous contribution of &pound;10,000 towards Archbishop William Laud's rebuilding fund in the 1630s. While still engaged in trade abroad, Pindar had in 1611 presented twenty Arabic, Persian, and other manuscripts to the Bodleian Library.<br>
<br>Pindar never married. His magnificent and much-admired house in Bishopsgate was taken down in 1890, but its splendid oak front is preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum. A reproduction of one of the richly ornamented ceilings of his house can be seen in the former library at Leeds Castle, Kent. By his will dated 24 June 1646 (proved 1651) he left one-third of his estate to the children of his eponymous nephew who predeceased him, and another third to his executor and kinsman, William Toomes. In 1655 the latter took his own life after failing to satisfy Pindar's debts and legacies since, of the &pound;236,000 at which Pindar's estate had been valued in 1639, desperate debts now preponderated. Also largely irrecoverable was the final third of the estate, consisting of miscellaneous legacies to friends and relatives.<br>
