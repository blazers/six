<span class="headword">Buchan <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Thomson]</span>,  Priscilla Jean Fortescue</span>, Lady Tweedsmuir and Baroness Tweedsmuir of Belhelvie  (1915&#150;1978), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at 13 Rosary Gardens, Kensington, London, on 25 January 1915, the younger daughter of Major Alan Fortescue Thomson (1880&#150;1957) of the Royal Artillery and his wife, Edythe Mary Unwin. She was educated in England, Germany, and France. On 14 May 1934 she married Sir Arthur Lindsay Grant, eleventh baronet (1911&#150;1944), of Monymusk, Aberdeenshire. They had two daughters. Her husband, who served as a major in the Grenadier Guards, was killed in action in Normandy on 18 July 1944.<br>
<br>Lady Grant began her political career in the general election of 1945, when she stood as the Conservative candidate in Aberdeen North. She was defeated, but in November 1946 she was elected to parliament at a by-election in Aberdeen South. When she entered the House of Commons in 1946 she was a pretty war widow with fair hair and blue eyes, and the mother of two small children. She was also, at the age of thirty-one, the youngest woman in the House of Commons at the time and one of only two Conservative women. Not surprisingly, she quickly attracted the attention of the press, who dubbed her the &#145;glamour girl&#146;. She held the Aberdeen South seat for twenty years.<br>
<br>On 27 July 1948 Lady Grant married John Norman Stuart Buchan, second Baron Tweedsmuir (1911&#150;1996), of Elsfield Manor, Oxfordshire, son of the author <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32145/', "John Buchan")</script>. They had one daughter. Lady Tweedsmuir was a delegate to the consultative assembly of the Council of Europe from 1950 to 1953, and was a member of the Commonwealth parliamentary delegation to the West Indies in 1955. In November 1957 she became the second woman to move the address in reply to the queen's speech at the opening of parliament. She was elected a member of the executive of the 1922 committee of the Conservative Party, only the second woman to have reached this position. During 1960&#150;61 she served as one of the British delegates to the United Nations general assembly. She was joint parliamentary under-secretary of state at the Scottish Office from 1962 until the Labour victory of 1964.<br>
<br>Lady Tweedsmuir lost her Aberdeen seat in the general election of 1966. Her political career seemed at an end, and she established business connections, becoming, notably, a member of the management team at Cunard from 1966 to 1970. However, in 1970 she was elevated to the House of Lords in her own right, with a life peerage, as Baroness Tweedsmuir of Belhelvie. At this point her career entered a new and even more distinguished phase. She served as minister of state at the Scottish Office from 1970 to 1972. As the Scottish minister in the Lords, she was expected to reside in Scotland and undertake local responsibilities there, while the secretary of state stayed in London. Her success in this position was rewarded in 1972 by a promotion to minister of state at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the first woman to be appointed to ministerial office in that department. As a Scottish MP she had learned a great deal about the fishing industry, and was well qualified to be chief negotiator during the first so-called &#145;cod war&#146; with Iceland. In 1974 she was sworn of the privy council, and became a deputy speaker of the Lords.<br>
<br>Lady Tweedsmuir's greatest achievement, however, was her role as chair, from 1974, of the European Communities select committee of the House of Lords. Although a committed European, she was quite ready to examine the community's actions with a critical eye. She recruited about eighty lords of different backgrounds&#151;trade unionists, judges, and former diplomats, among others&#151;to examine in detail all proposed legislation of the European Community. They did so with a thoroughness that put to shame the equivalent House of Commons committee. It was said of the committee: &#145;Time and again the Lords select committee produced reports based on weeks of close examination and careful analysis that provided cogent evidence of the malfunctioning of the Brussels bureaucracy which gave other European parliamentarians cause to marvel&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 13 March 1978). Her achievement was also constitutionally significant, for she managed to establish a politically effective body within the House of Lords. Lady Tweedsmuir resigned from this position in 1977 because of ill health, and died at her home, Potterton House, Balmedie, Aberdeenshire, on 11 March 1978.<br>
