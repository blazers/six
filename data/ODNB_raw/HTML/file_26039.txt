<span class="headword">Sothel,  Seth</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1693/4), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was born in England; his parents' identity is unknown. By 1675, however, he had sufficient status for the Carolina proprietors to identify him as &#145;a person of considerable estate here in England&#146;  (Cheves, 468&#150;9) who intended to acquire 12,000 acres in Carolina, on which he would establish settlers from England. That plan never came to fruition, but Sothel bought the earl of Clarendon's share of the proprietorship in 1677, and because of the political chaos in the Albemarle settlement (North Carolina), which culminated in &#145;Culpepper's rebellion&#146;, he agreed to serve as governor of the area. On the voyage out north African pirates captured and held him for ransom at Algiers, where he spent time at hard labour before being freed two years later. Characteristically, he failed to recompense those who had posted bond for him until forced to do so by legal action.<br>
<br>In 1682 Sothel arrived at Albemarle, where he governed relatively well at first. He also received land grants for two seignories totalling 24,000 acres, participated in the American Indian trade, and in the second half of 1686 married a wealthy widow, Anna Blount, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Willix. The marriage remained childless but, behaving as if he had a large family to support, Sothel soon became extraordinarily avaricious. At least, according to the testimony of his enemies, he preyed upon his political opponents and the powerless, imprisoning them and seizing their property. In 1689 Thomas Pollack, whom he had gaoled, led an armed force that overthrew and arrested Sothel. The local assembly then tried and sentenced him to a year's banishment and permanent disbarment from political office in the colony. A Virginian, Philip Ludwell, became governor.<br>
<br>Sothel went to Charles Town in South Carolina, arriving in 1690 while this settlement was also in the middle of a political crisis. Aligning himself with factional opponents of Governor James Colleton, he maintained that the fundamental constitutions of Carolina gave him the right as a proprietor to claim the governorship. Although the legal status of this document was debatable, Sothel's support was strong enough that the threat of an armed confrontation enabled him to prevail in a bloodless coup. He then called a local parliament which passed several constructive acts. It also, however, banished Colleton and barred him, as well as some of his supporters, from future public office. Simultaneously Sothel resumed his avid and questionable pursuit of wealth. Ordering the survey of 24,000 acres for himself was probably legitimate; apparent preparations for acquiring a monopoly of the West Indian trade were more doubtful; and trafficking with pirates was clearly prohibited. News of these actions prompted the proprietors to disallow all acts passed by Sothel's parliament and in November 1691 remove him from office. Once again, they turned to Philip Ludwell, who on 13 May 1692 officially informed Sothel that he was out. Sothel remained in the area for about a year, futilely claiming the office, but by November 1693 he was back in Albemarle. At some time before 3 February 1694, when his will was proved, he died, apparently in Virginia, where he was presumably buried. Most of his property went to his wife, Anna, but a bequest to his father-in-law, Edward Foster of Albemarle county, indicates that he had been previously married. Final settlement of his extensive and complex estate required prolonged litigation. After his death his widow married John Lear but she died at some time before May 1695.<br>
<br>Sothel's political career produced significant constitutional changes in Carolina. Partly because his claims to the governorship at Charles Town rested on the fundamental constitutions, the proprietors in 1691 suspended it and restructured the government by reducing membership in the council and permitting the lower house to meet separately. These steps influenced the configuration of local government for the rest of the colonial period and laid the foundation for the rise to power of the assembly.<br>
