<span class="headword">O'Neill,  John</span>, first Viscount O'Neill  (1740&#150;1798), <span class="occ">politician and landowner</span>, was born on 16 January 1740 at Shane's Castle, co. Antrim, the eldest son of Charles O'Neill (<i>d</i>. 1769), MP and landowner, and Catherine Alice (<i>d</i>. 1790), third daughter of St John Brodrick MP. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, which he entered on 21 April 1757, and Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated on 14 April 1762 and graduated MA on 15 June of the same year. The extent of the O'Neill family influence in co. Antrim was reflected in his appointment as high sheriff of the county in 1772, and subsequently as deputy governor, then as governor (1792&#150;8). He entered the Irish parliament in 1761 as representative for the borough of Randalstown, which the O'Neill family controlled. In 1783 and 1790 he was elected as one of the MPs for the county, but preferred to continue sitting for the borough. On 18 October 1777 he married Henrietta (<i>d</i>. 1793), only daughter and heir of Charles Boyle, later styled Lord Dungarvan, and Susanna Hoare. They had two sons, who are noted below, and a daughter, who married George Hartwell on 20 June 1792.<br>
<br>O'Neill was regarded as a moderate in politics, a great landowner who was a good and considerate landlord, an amiable and much respected man in public and private. He entered with enthusiasm into the volunteer movement which developed after 1778, when Ireland was denuded of troops during the American war, and became colonel of the first regiment raised in Antrim in 1781. In parliament he aligned himself with the whig and &#145;patriot&#146; interest on popular issues, but without losing the respect of government. He was a warm supporter of the reform of parliament, and, after some initial hesitation, Catholic emancipation. Early in his parliamentary career he temporarily lost the goodwill of the Presbyterians (who predominated in Antrim and eastern Ulster) by introducing in 1774 a <span class="roman">Vestry Bill</span> which would have infringed their customary rights, enabling vestries consisting of Church of Ireland members alone to impose taxes for the repair of churches on dissenting residents of the parish, but the bill was defeated. Almost all of O'Neill's tenants were Presbyterians and henceforward he tended to support measures which had the broad approval of the dissenters.<br>
<br>O'Neill attended the first great volunteer convention in Dungannon on 15 February 1782, as a delegate for co. Antrim, in the historic closing stages of the agitation which helped to bring about the independence of the Irish parliament. He was one of the four delegates appointed by the Irish House of Commons to present a petition to the prince of Wales in 1789 requesting him to assume the regency in Ireland without conditions. O'Neill spoke seldom in the house, but when he did he acquitted himself effectively. He was tall and well-proportioned, his voice well-toned and harmonious, though &#145;somewhat hurt by a tendency to a lisp&#146;  (Johnston-Liik). He was described by a contemporary as addicted to the interests of Ireland and acting as the independent representative of a free people, shunning alike &#145;the meanness of factious opposition and the servile subserviency of the hireling tribe&#146;  (ibid.). Although the borough of Randalstown had been in the control of the O'Neill family &#145;from time immemorial&#146;, he insisted on the inhabitants having the uninfluenced choice of their representatives. He was one of the founders of the Northern Whig Club in 1790, his name appearing alongside those of radicals and United Irishmen such as Archibald Hamilton Rowan, Samuel McTier, and Theobald Wolfe Tone, but O'Neill's loyalty was never in doubt, and this was recognized by his elevation to the rank of Baron O'Neill in 1793 and Viscount O'Neill in 1795. During his viceregal tour of the north of Ireland in 1787 the lord lieutenant, the duke of Rutland, visited him at Shane's Castle, and like other guests expressed admiration for the residence and its magnificent setting on the shore of Lough Neagh. To indulge his wife's enthusiasm for the acting of Sarah Siddons, O'Neill built a private theatre there, and persuaded the celebrated actress to give a performance in it; Siddons wrote of her enchantment on the occasion in her memoirs.<br>
<br>Although sympathetic to the cause of reform, Lord O'Neill was totally opposed to the United Irishmen, who by the late 1790s were planning insurrection. From 1793 he had been colonel of the Antrim militia, and he was active in helping to raise and train the yeomanry. When the Irish rising broke out on 23 May 1798 the north at first remained quiet, but early in June O'Neill, who was in Dublin, had reports of an imminent rising in Antrim. As governor of the county he summoned a meeting of the magistrates for 7 June in Antrim town, a decision which precipitated the calamity he wished to avert, for Henry Joy McCracken, the leader of the Presbyterian insurgents in the county, planned to attack the town on that day and seize the magistrates as hostages. Hastening towards Antrim, O'Neill passed through Lisburn without stopping, and so failed to receive an urgent warning from General Nugent, the army commander in the north. He arrived in the town to find the battle in progress, and at the moment when Colonel Lumley's dragoons were hastily retreating after their disastrous charge along the main street. Accounts of what followed are conflicting, but it is clear that Lord O'Neill found himself alone on horseback near the market house. He fired his pistols at the advancing rebels and one of them drove a pike into his side, probably without recognizing him. After a sortie from the wall of the Massereene estate by the defenders, he was carried into Lord Massereene's residence. When the rebels abandoned the town, Colonel Durham of the Fife fencibles, learning of Lord O'Neill's injuries, went to see him, and sent for two of the army surgeons to dress his wounds. They told Durham that O'Neill &#145;could not live, as the pike had pierced his stomach&#146;  (Dundas MS). That night the exhausted soldiers slept on the benches of O'Neill's private theatre at Shane's Castle, while he lay dying in the house of his neighbour, scarcely a mile away. Against all expectations, he survived for almost two weeks, conscious and able to communicate with family and friends. His death, on 18 June at Massereene House, co. Antrim, was greatly mourned, not least by the United Irishmen themselves. It was widely believed that his assailant had been one of his own tenants.<br>

<a name="cosubject_20766"></a><span class="headword">Charles Henry St John O'Neill</span>, Earl O'Neill  (1779&#150;1841), <span class="occ">landowner</span>, elder son of the first Viscount O'Neill, was born on 22 January 1779. He was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford, matriculating on 23 November 1795. On his father's death in 1798 he became second Viscount O'Neill. At the time of the passing of the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> in 1800 Lord Cornwallis, in a letter to the duke of Portland (3 June 1800), recommended that O'Neill and Lord Bandon should have precedence in the creation of Irish earls then contemplated. On 7 August 1800 O'Neill accordingly became first Viscount Raymond and first Earl O'Neill of Shane's Castle. His borough of Randalstown was disfranchised. In September 1800 he was elected one of the first Irish representative peers in the Westminster parliament. In 1807 he was appointed joint postmaster-general of Ireland with the earl of Rosse. This was a comparatively new appointment, and in practice the Post Office was run by the secretary, Sir Edward Lees. The postmasters-general appeared rarely in the office, and never together. On 13 February 1809 O'Neill was created a knight of the Order of St Patrick. In 1831 he was appointed lord lieutenant of the county of Antrim. Understandably, perhaps, he did not share his father's political views and could not bring himself to travel through the town of Antrim. He was a strong supporter of the union and became grand master of the Orange order in Ireland until the union of the Irish and English bodies under the duke of Cumberland. He died unmarried at the Bilton Hotel, Sackville Street, Dublin, on 25 March 1841. The earldom then became extinct and the viscountcy devolved on his younger brother, <a name="cosubject_20780"></a><span class="headword">John Bruce Richard O'Neill</span>, third Viscount O'Neill  (1780&#150;1855), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, who was born on 30 December 1780 at Shane's Castle. After being educated at Eton, he entered the army as an ensign in the Coldstream Guards on 10 October 1799, saw much active service, and attained the rank of major-general on 27 May 1825, lieutenant-general on 28 June 1838, and general on 28 June 1854. He represented the county of Antrim from 19 July 1802 until his succession to the peerage on the death of his brother in 1841. In 1811 he was appointed constable of Dublin Castle. He took little part in politics, though he supported the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>. In February 1842 he was elected a representative peer of Ireland in the House of Lords at Westminster. Among his honorary appointments was that of vice-admiral of the coast of Ulster. He died unmarried of a complication of gout and influenza at Shane's Castle on 12 February 1855. His title became extinct but the name of O'Neill was assumed by the inheritor of the estates, the Revd William Chichester [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20787/', "O'Neill, William Chichester, first Baron O'Neill (1813&#150;1883)")</script>].<br>
