<span class="headword">Story,  Edward</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1503), <span class="occ">bishop of Chichester</span>, was a native of the diocese of York. He was admitted to Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he was a fellow by 1446 and treasurer in 1446, 1448, and 1450. MA by 1447 and DTh by 1460, he was elected master of Michaelhouse in 1466, and continued in that office until 1474. He was chancellor of the university in 1468&#150;9 and again from 1471 to 1473.<br>
<br>Between March and April 1444 Story had advanced through the minor orders at speed, but he was only admitted to his first known benefice, the rectory of All Hallows, London, on 9 February 1460, and had only added a prebend in Crediton collegiate church, Devon, by the time of his episcopal promotion. At the end of 1464, according to Gregory's chronicle, he entered into a controversy raging in London after certain friars had revived emphasis on Christ as beggar. At Paul's Cross, Story &#145;as moche as he myght, wolde have passefyde the mater, and sayde that hys [was] blasphemy soo to reherse and say by oure Lord Cryste&#146;  (Gairdner, <span class="italic">Historical Collections</span>, 229). This did not cool passions at all. Not long afterwards Story became confessor to Queen Elizabeth Woodville, with an annuity from Easter 1468 of at least &pound;10 p.a. during pleasure.<br>
<br>Story was promoted by papal provision to the bishopric of Carlisle on 18 July 1468. He received the temporalities on 1 September and was consecrated in St Stephen's Chapel, Westminster, on 2 October. He appears to have taken his diocesan duties seriously, holding synods and conducting visitations, but having to use the prior of the cathedral as his vicar-general, for he was still often absent. These absences were probably at least partly due to his appointment to commissions of the peace in counties far removed from the north-west&#151;Cambridgeshire, Gloucestershire, Shropshire, and Worcestershire. However, when Edward IV was in York in March 1470, having put the earl of Warwick and duke of Clarence to flight, it was Story who passed on the king's orders to the mayor of Carlisle to seize the castle out of Neville hands.<br>
<br>Story used his connections with the royal family to the advantage of the city and diocese. He served on the council to govern England while Edward IV conducted his French expedition in 1475 and he remained confessor to Queen Elizabeth Woodville. Perhaps it was partly for greater convenience that on 11 February 1478 he was translated to the slightly more lucrative and certainly more congenial see of Chichester. His attachment to the court meant that he was only occasionally resident in his diocese at first. On 17 April 1483 he helped officiate in the prolonged funeral rites of Edward IV, and evidently remained in and around the capital during the difficult months that followed. However, on 28 July he is to be found in his diocese and there he remained, mainly at Aldingbourne, disenchanted presumably with the usurpation of Richard III, but not known to have been involved in the rebellion in the southern counties that autumn. His patron, the queen, remained in sanctuary. Even after 1485 he does not seem to have returned to any duties that required his extended absence. He arranged the attachment of a prebend to the free school at Chichester, henceforth known as the prebendal school, and erected a market cross in the city.<br>
<br>By his will Story left a set of vestments of white satin to Pembroke College and 20<i>s</i>. to Michaelhouse, and requested burial in the tomb he had prepared on the north side of the altar of Chichester Cathedral. He died on 16 March 1503. His register for Chichester is in the West Sussex Record Office, but his Carlisle register is lost.<br>
