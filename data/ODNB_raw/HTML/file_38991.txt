<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lord,  Cyril</span>  (1911&#150;1984), <span class="occ">carpet manufacturer</span>, was born on 12 July 1911 at 129 Moorside Street, Droylsden, Manchester, the son of Richard Lund Lord and his wife, Kate, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hackney. His family had impeccable textile connections linking Macclesfield and Saddleworth hand-loom weavers, and his was a Wesleyan Methodist upbringing within a close mill community. In later life he rebelled against many of his early associations, was educated at the central school in Manchester, and defied his father, a worker in the co-operative movement, by taking an apprenticeship with a local textile firm. Working in the expanding rayon industry, he studied at the Manchester College of Technology and in 1935 moved to a London firm of wholesalers and merchant converters. During the Second World War he was an adviser to the Cotton Board and an instructor in the weaving of &#145;cotton&#146; from utility fibres in Northern Ireland.<br>
<br>By 1945 the basis of Lord's remarkable post-war rise had been laid. A specialist in man-made fibres and their applications, he had connections with both producers and those in merchandising, and was a remarkable salesman. A short but strong man, intolerant of bureaucracy and compromise, he showed bravery verging on recklessness in business. With the support of the Irish banks, and in association with William McMillan, the assemblage of his company began with the purchase of two mills in Chorley. Its partial flotation in 1954 was oversubscribed twelvefold. Following a world tour in 1953, Lord was to the forefront of the campaign for trade protection, culminating in the <span class="roman">Cotton Industry Act</span> (1959). He gained much publicity when he sent 1200 members of the political and economic establishment spindles of cotton and wallets stuffed with Japanese money. Specializing in &#145;from the factory&#146; sales, and the Taiho fabric, his mills made good profits, making him a millionaire by the early 1960s.<br>
<br>Lord responded to the further contraction of the cotton industry with an ill-fated enterprise in South Africa, and by diversifying into carpet production. Backed by government funds, he established a large factory at Donaghadee, co. Down, Northern Ireland, in 1956. His greatest venture, this plant could produce 5 yards of carpet per minute, and employed 800 people in a town of only 3700. Relentless sales campaigns, in which Lord, with his jingle &#145;This is luxury you can afford by Cyril Lord&#146;, was much to the fore, fed the consumer boom of the 1960s. The pace of expansion could not be maintained, new product lines failed, and, amid increasing difficulties, Lord's health broke down in September 1967, and he retired to the West Indies. The collapse of his firm in October 1968 was one of the spectacular failures of the period. The firm's prospects, trumpeted in a second share issue in 1965, were revealed to have been unfounded, and directors had much reduced their holdings. The collapse was the subject of a libel action in 1974, and a final payment to creditors was made only in 1987.<br>
<br>Lord was a colourful personality who played the part of the millionaire to the full: a character based on him appeared in a 1967 episode of the American television series <span class="italic">Batman</span> in the shape of &#145;Mat Man, the Karpet King of Europe&#146;. Though principally remembered for the spectacular demise of his company, Lord was a genuine innovator, whose career, up to a point, represented a logical, if individualistic, business response in a declining industry.<br>
<br>Lord was married three times: on 26 December 1936 to Bessie Greenwood (<i>b</i>. 1913/14), whom he divorced in 1959 and with whom he had two sons and two daughters; on 17 January 1960 to the journalist and novelist Shirley Florence Hussey, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stringer (<i>b</i>. 1932/3), whom he divorced in 1973; and in 1974 to Aileen Parnell, widow of impresario Val Parnell. Lord died after a long illness at his home in Barbados on 29 May 1984.<br>
