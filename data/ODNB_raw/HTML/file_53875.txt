<span class="headword">Bond,  Frederick Bligh</span>  (1864&#150;1945), <span class="occ">architect, author, and psychical researcher</span>, was born on 30 June 1864 at Marlborough, Wiltshire, the third son of the Revd Frederick Hookey Bond, headmaster of Marlborough Royal Free Grammar School, and of his wife, Mary Isabella Dela Fosse. He was educated at Bath College, where his father had taken up a post, and in 1882 was articled to the Bristol architect Charles F. Hansom. In 1887 he went into partnership with Hansom, working with him and, after Hansom's death in 1891, with his son Edward, on Clifton College and on the buildings of the University College, Bristol.<br>
<br>From 1900 Bond practised alone, built a solid reputation as both an ecclesiastical and domestic architect (his most important building is the public hall in the Bristol suburb of Shirehampton), and gained his FRIBA. In 1909 he cemented his reputation with the publication of his first book, <span class="italic">Roodscreens and Roodlofts</span>, written jointly with Bede Camm, and with his appointment as consulting architect to Malvern Priory church. Shortly before this Bond had become director of excavations at Glastonbury Abbey, which in 1908 had been purchased by the Church of England and was administered by the Bath and Wells Diocesan Trust. Bond's fascination with Glastonbury, which rapidly became an obsession, had begun in 1907 and provided him not only with a mission, but also with solace for an unhappy marriage.<br>
<br>In late 1893 he had married Mary Louise Mills, at Newport, Monmouthshire, and their only child&#151;Mary Theodora St Vincent Bligh Bond&#151;was born the following year. The marriage rapidly failed, and by 1898 Bond and his wife were legally separated; bitter legal battles over custody of his daughter continued for many years. It was, perhaps, symptomatic of Bond's growing enthusiasm for esoteric subjects, and especially with what was later termed &#145;sacred geometry&#146;, that he should name his daughter after the masonic lodge, St Vincent, no. 1404, at Bristol, of which he was then the master. His enthusiasm also carried over into his work at Glastonbury.<br>
<br>From the outset Bond saw himself as a pioneer, describing himself as the &#145;first in applying psychical research methods to archaeological work&#146;  (<span class="italic">WWW</span>, 4.119). He was not the active agent in these controversial methods, that role being taken by Captain John Allen Bartlett (&#145;John Alleyne&#146;), a west country poet and folklorist. At Bond's direction Bartlett produced, by automatic writing, a long series of scripts about the history of Glastonbury Abbey, together with sketch plans of the site. On the basis of these Bond excavated and uncovered the foundations of two previously unknown structures, the Edgar and Loretto chapels. The story of their discovery was publicized in Bond's book <span class="italic">The Gate of Remembrance</span> (1918), and alleged messages from medieval monks were published in two further books, <span class="italic">The Hill of Vision</span> (1919) and <span class="italic">The Company of Avalon</span> (1924), and in a long series of pamphlets, <span class="italic">The Glastonbury Scripts</span> (1921&#150;5).<br>
<br>Bond's research was highly controversial and the diocesan trust, uneasy over his methods&#151;despite his successes&#151;and unhappy with the publicity, dismissed him from his post as director of excavations in 1922. He was no longer practising as an architect, and relied increasingly on his writing and research for an income. From 1921 to 1926 he edited the journal <span class="italic">Psychic Science</span>, and, with the Revd T. S. Lea, published works on the Greek cabbala. This was an application of symbolic word numbers to the symbolic interpretation of the Greek text of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> and to the true interpretation of geometrical forms. But such works as <span class="italic">The Apostolic Gnosis</span> (1919&#150;21) had a limited appeal and did little to provide an income. Far more successful were books purporting to reveal hitherto unknown gospels, but they were not destined to bring success to Bond. While acting as editor of <span class="italic">Psychic Science</span>, Bond had been associated with the automatic writing of Geraldine Cummins, but when in 1926 he attempted to publish and to claim copyright in her <span class="italic">Chronicle of Cleophas</span>, on the grounds that his presence and influence had been essential to its production, she brought a successful legal action against him. When the book appeared in 1928, it was in her name and to her sole financial advantage.<br>
<br>Bond then took up a series of lecture tours in the USA, encouraged by his friend and fellow architect Ralph Adams Cram. During one of these he met Archbishop W. H. F. Brothers of an American branch of the Old Catholic church and felt a calling to the priesthood. In 1932 Bond was ordained by Archbishop Brothers and in the following year consecrated as a bishop. He had, however, neither parish nor diocese, and after he returned to England in 1937 ceased to use the title the Right Revd Monsignor Bond OSB. This clerical phase was the last in his curious career; his attempts to excavate at Glastonbury once again came to nothing and he settled for retirement. From 1938 to 1942 Bond lived with his married daughter at Wimbledon, and then moved to Dolgellau in north Wales, where he died, at the Cottage Hospital, on 8 March 1945. He was buried in Llanelltyd churchyard, Dolgellau.<br>
<br>Bond had left a respectable legacy as an architect, but his real achievement was to set Glastonbury firmly in the English psyche and to link it inseparably to the sacred geometry which he had helped to formulate.<br>
