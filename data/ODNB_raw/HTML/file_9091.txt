<span class="headword">Fairfax,  Thomas</span>, first Lord Fairfax of Cameron  (1560&#150;1640), <span class="occ">diplomat, soldier, and horse breeder</span>, was born at Bilbrough, near York, the eldest son of Sir Thomas Fairfax (1521&#150;1600) of Denton and Nun Appleton, Yorkshire, and Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1596), daughter of George Gale, goldsmith and lord mayor of York, and widow of John Rokeby of Sandal. In the Easter term of 1577 he matriculated from Queens' College, Cambridge, and on 22 October 1579 was admitted to Lincoln's Inn. In 1582 he married Ellen (<i>d</i>. 1620), daughter of Robert Aske of Aughton, and they had nine sons and two daughters. Their seventh son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9078/', "Charles Fairfax")</script>, became an antiquary and genealogist.<br>
<br>Fairfax's early career was diplomatic. During the 1580s he undertook several government missions to Scotland which earned him a reputation for loyalty and discretion. King James offered him a peerage which he wisely refused, no doubt aware of Queen Elizabeth's disapproval of other people's collars for her dogs. In 1588 he was back in Scotland to help James suppress Maxwell's pro-Spanish rising there. Yet Fairfax seems to have lacked political ambition. Although he sat for Lincoln in 1586&#150;7, for Aldborough in 1589, and for the county of Yorkshire in 1601, he made no mark in the House of Commons. However, he was a JP in Cumberland and Westmorland from about 1583, as well as in the West Riding of Yorkshire from about 1592.<br>
<br>Fairfax's political activity may have been curtailed by his love of soldiering. Probably in 1589 he went to the Netherlands to serve under Sir Francis Vere, and after brave conduct at the siege of Rouen in 1591 he was knighted by the earl of Essex. After the deaths of four of his sons in foreign wars and his disappointment with the others, his hopes of military glory centred on his eldest grandson, the future general, to whom in his will he left his best arms and his best horse. After his father died he built, on the strength of his substantial and increasing income, a fine mansion house at Denton, near Ilkley, in Wharfedale, yet even at home he demanded military discipline from his servants and every event of the day was timetabled precisely. His greatest pleasure was in horses and horsemanship: his stud at Denton was one of the best in the country and among his many treatises was one entitled <span class="italic">Conjectures about Horsemanship</span> and another on Yorkshire cavalry.<br>
<br>Although from 1599 Fairfax, in succession to his father, had a seat on the council of the north, he seemed content to live in the shadow of other Yorkshiremen. In 1607 <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9081/', "Ferdinando Fairfax")</script>, his heir, married Mary, daughter of his friend and patron Lord Sheffield, the council's president. Later, Fairfax associated himself with his younger neighbour Thomas Wentworth, and together they successfully contested with the Saviles for Yorkshire's two seats in the infamous election of 1625. King Charles's need for ready money and his activity in collecting the forced loan of 1627 explain why Fairfax was created Lord Fairfax of Cameron in the Scottish peerage on 4 May of that year on down payment of &pound;1500 in gold. Fairfax died at Denton Hall on 1 May 1640 and was buried the next day in the south transept of All Saints' Church, Otley, Yorkshire, next to his wife, who had died on 23 August 1620.<br>
