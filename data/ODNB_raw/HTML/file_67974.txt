<span class="headword">Tollet,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1696?), <span class="occ">musician and composer</span>, is first known in 1669 when, along with two men who were perhaps his brothers, John Tollet (possibly the John &#145;Tallat&#146; who had married an Ann Bates in Dublin in 1665, the earliest reference to the family name in Dublin) and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/60262/', "George Tollet (d. 1719)")</script>, he is listed as one of the ten Dublin city musicians; a Charles Tollet was also appointed to the city musicians in 1677. Thomas, John, and Charles were again named as Dublin city musicians in 1688. Between 1673 and 1687 Christ Church, Dublin, purchased violins and music (unspecified except in one reference to &#145;3 anthems&#146;) on a number of occasions from &#145;Mr Tollett&#146; or &#145;the Tolletts&#146;, indicating that they ran a family music business alongside their activities as musicians. Richard, a son of &#145;Thomas Tallet, gent. and his wife Esther&#146;, was buried at St Michan's Church, Dublin, in 1680, and a second, unnamed child in 1684.<br>
<br>Some instrumental music by both Thomas and George Tollet, included in a manuscript collection dating from the 1660s and 1670s and associated with the twenty-four violins of the English royal court, indicates professional links with England at this period. Thomas Tollet moved to London probably in 1688 or 1689 and there composed incidental music for the theatre including <span class="italic">Love or Money</span> (January 1690?), <span class="italic">The Marriage-Hater Match'd</span> (1692), and <span class="italic">The Virtuous Wife</span> (1694?), all by Thomas D'Urfey and given at Drury Lane. Tollet also wrote music for <span class="italic">Henry the Second</span> (by J. Bancroft, 1692), <span class="italic">The Volunteers</span> (T. Shadwell, 1692), <span class="italic">The Cheats</span> (J. Wilson, <i>c</i>.1693), <span class="italic">The Lover's Luck</span> (T. Dilke, 1695), and <span class="italic">The Generous Enemies</span> (J. Corye, 1696?). As a composer Tollet has been described as &#145;a reasonably competent follower of Purcell, though his music is unenterprising&#146;  (Holman, &#145;Tollett, Thomas&#146;).<br>
<br>Tollet published an instruction book, <span class="italic">Directions to Play on the French Flageolet</span> (now lost), in London in 1694. A number of shorter instrumental pieces by him survive, including &#145;The queen's farewell&#146; written on the death of Queen Mary in 1694. It is likely that George Tollet composed some of the music attributed to Thomas Tollet including &#145;Tollett's ground&#146;, which first appeared in John Playford's <span class="italic">The Division Viol</span> (10th edn, 1685, and later edns) and remained popular into the eighteenth century. The fact that, unlike Thomas, John, and Charles Tollet, he was no longer a Dublin city musician in 1688 may be explained by his having developed his interest in mathematics if, as seems probable, he can be identified with the George Tollet who later became a commissioner of the navy and died in 1719. Tollet was sworn in as a member of the royal private musick in March 1695 but must have died (presumably in London) not long before 2 September 1696, when his place was taken by John Eccles.<br>
