<span class="headword">Young, Sir  Aretas William</span>  (1777/8&#150;1835), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial governor</span>, entered the earl of Portmore's regiment as an ensign on 3 September 1795, aged seventeen. He purchased a lieutenancy in the 13th foot on 28 November 1795, and a company on 15 September 1796. He served with the 13th in Ireland during the 1798 uprising, and in Egypt in 1801. Between 1804 and 1806 he acted as aide-de-camp to General Henry Edward Fox at Gibraltar and in Sicily. On 17 December 1807 he was promoted major in the 97th, with which he served in the Peninsular campaigns of 1808&#150;10 and 1811, and served at the battles of Vimeiro, Talavera, and Busaco, at Redinha, the taking of Oliven&ccedil;a and the first siege of Badajoz. Whenever the 4th division moved, the light companies were entrusted to his charge, and during a part of the retreat to the lines of the Torres Vedras in 1810, those companies were embodied under his command as a light battalion.<br>
<br>Depleted, the 97th was ordered to England, and Young was promoted, on 25 January 1813, lieutenant-colonel in the 3rd West India regiment, stationed in Trinidad. With five companies he joined the expedition against Guadeloupe in 1815, and received one of the badges of the order of merit presented by Louis XVIII. After his return to Trinidad he was chosen by Sir James Leith to command the troops in Grenada. On his being ordered back to Trinidad in August 1816, the council of assembly of Grenada presented him with a sword. In 1820, during the absence of Sir Ralph James Woodford, he administered the government of Trinidad for four months, on the termination of which he was requested to continue as a member of the council. During a second absence of Woodford he filled the office of governor for nearly two years, and on his resignation in February 1823 received the thanks of every section of the community. In 1825 the 3rd West India regiment was disbanded, and in January 1826 Young was appointed to the newly created office of his majesty's protector of slaves in Demerara. He retired from the army by sale of his commission on 13 May, with permission to retain the local rank of lieutenant-colonel. On 25 July 1831 he was gazetted lieutenant-governor of Prince Edward Island, Canada, and on 9 July 1834 he was knighted. He married Sarah Cox of Coolcliffe, Wexford; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30264/', "Sir Henry Edward Fox Young")</script> was their son. Young died at Government House, Prince Edward Island, on 1 December 1835, and was buried at the new English church.<br>
