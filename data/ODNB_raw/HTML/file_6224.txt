<span class="headword">Cooper,  Robert</span>  (1649/50&#150;1732), <span class="occ">mathematician and Church of England clergyman</span>, was the second son of the seven children born to Robert Cooper of Kidderminster, Worcestershire, and his wife, Elizabeth. He entered Pembroke College, Oxford, as a servitor in 1666, aged sixteen, graduated BA in 1670, and was elected fellow through the influence of Dr Hall, master of Pembroke. Cooper is credited by Wood  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4.749) as the author of the anonymous tract <span class="italic">Proportions Concerning Optic-Glasses, with their Natural Reasons Drawn from Experiments</span> (1679), which expounds in simple fashion the laws governing reflection and refraction through glass. Elsewhere this work has been attributed to Obadiah Walker, who had an interest in mathematics but who never put his name to his own works, and also to Abraham Woodhead, who had no scientific interests. The likeliest explanation is that it was found among Walker's papers at his death in 1678, and that Cooper, who was a competent mathematician, edited it and passed it to Woodhead, who was a delegate of the university press, for publication. Five hundred copies were printed.<br>
<br>The anonymous &#145;General introduction to geography&#146; which prefaced the first volume, published in 1680, of Moses Pitt's multi-volume but incomplete <span class="italic">English Atlas</span> has also been attributed to Cooper. The author of this text includes an explanation of the calculations for latitude and longitude and other aspects of mathematical geography.<br>
<br>On 8 April 1681 Cooper, who was considered an able preacher, was presented to the rectory of Harlington, Middlesex, where he resided at least part of the time until his death. From 1698 he was also archdeacon of Dorset. Cooper never married. He died in March 1732 and was buried at Harlington, where his tomb bears the incorrect death date of 1722, which is corrected on a memorial inside the church. He left his books to his nephew Robert Pyre, vicar of Heath, and over &pound;1500 in South Sea shares to his sister Rachel and various nieces. He also requested that &pound;100 promised to Pembroke College towards the cost of the chapel then under construction should be paid.<br>
