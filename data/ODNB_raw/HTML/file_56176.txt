<span class="headword">Butt, Sir  Alfred</span>, first baronet  (1878&#150;1962), <span class="occ">music-hall entrepreneur and racehorse owner and breeder</span>, was born on 20 March 1878, the only son of Frederick Butt, a builder. He was educated at Westminster School and, after leaving school, worked in the accounting department at Harrods as a clerk on a salary of 15<i>s</i>. per week. He was then employed by the Palace Theatre, Cambridge Circus.<br>
<br>Butt's subsequent career was built around the management of this theatre, which he made into one of the most prestigious, fashionable, and financially successful variety theatres in London. Appointed company secretary of the Palace Theatre Ltd in 1898, at the age of nineteen, he soon after became assistant manager and, on the death of Charles Morton in 1904, manager of the music-hall. In 1906 Butt was promoted to managing director, a position he retained until 1920. Butt's management of the Palace was characterized by the production of novel and lavish entertainments and he became especially associated with the introduction of foreign performers to British music-hall audiences. The most notable of these included famous continental performers such as Anna Pavlova (1909) and Yvette Guilbert (1910), although he also developed very close business links with American vaudeville which ensured a continuous flow of top American stars to Britain.<br>
<br>In 1910 Butt greatly extended his music-hall business by assuming control of the deceased <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56527/', "Thomas Barrasford's")</script> circuit of halls and by merging his interests with those of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56186/', "Walter de Frece")</script> to create the Variety Theatres Controlling Company Limited (VTCC). These developments rapidly made Butt one of the most influential figures in the music-hall industry and enabled him and de Frece to challenge the dominance of Moss Empires within the industry. Butt also became involved in the management of the Globe, Queen's, and Empire theatres (1914), and the Gaiety and the Adelphi (1915), and was responsible for the construction of the Victoria Palace and Glasgow Alhambra.<br>
<br>During the First World War, Butt became involved with the Ministry of Food and oversaw the introduction of compulsory rationing in 1917. In acknowledgement of this role, and also for his contributions to war charities, Butt was knighted in 1918. Having been adopted as the Unionist parliamentary candidate for North Paddington in June 1918, Sir Alfred reduced his involvement in the variety theatre, disposing of his interests in the VTCC (1919) and the Gaiety, Adelphi, and Palace theatres (1920). He did, though, take on the chairmanship of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, in 1919, and was its managing director from 1925 to 1931. Butt finally obtained a seat in parliament in November 1922 as the representative for Balham and Tooting. He enjoyed a lengthy parliamentary career, the apogee of which was the award of a baronetcy in the 1929 dissolution honours list for his political and public services. His political career ended in disgrace, however, when in 1936 he was forced to resign after a scandal implicating him in obtaining personal financial gain from leaked budget proposals disclosed to him by his friend J. H. Thomas, the colonial secretary.<br>
<br>Butt held a long-standing interest in gambling and in his younger days he played chemin de fer at casinos in Deauville and other resorts. Horse-racing was another passion, and after his enforced retirement from public life he turned his attention towards the racing world, acquiring the Brook stud in Newmarket. He was a successful owner&#150;breeder, winning the 1946 Oaks with Steady Aim. He was also responsible for the breeding of Petition. As a two-year-old, the horse won the New Stakes at Ascot, and also finished first in the Gimcrack and the Champagne Stakes. Although fancied to win the 2000 Guineas, Petition had an accident at the start. Other successful mares that Butt owned were Quick Arrow, Solar Flower, and Spend a Penny.<br>
<br>Butt married Georgina Mary, daughter of Frederick Say of Norwich, in 1902; they had a son, born in 1908. Georgina died in January 1960 and, in August 1960, Butt married Wilhelmine Wahl, who had been his nurse&#150;companion for a number of years  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 10 Dec 1962). He died at his home, Clarehaven, Bury Road, Newmarket, on 8 December 1962; his funeral was held at Cambridge crematorium on 12 December. His only son, (Alfred) Kenneth Dudley Butt, succeeded to the baronetcy.<br>
