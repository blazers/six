<span class="headword">Cobbold <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Murray]</span>, Lady  Evelyn</span>  (1867&#150;1963), <span class="occ">traveller and convert to Islam</span>, was born on 17 July 1867 at 13 Great Stuart Street, Edinburgh, the eldest of the six children (five daughters and one son) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35156/', "Charles Adolphus Murray, seventh earl of Dunmore (1841&#150;1907)")</script>, and his wife, Lady Gertrude (1847&#150;1943), who was a daughter of Thomas Coke, second earl of Leicester of Holkham, and his first wife, Juliana. Her father, the seventh earl of Dunmore, was an officer in the Scots Guards, lord-in-waiting during Disraeli's government of 1874&#150;80, and a noted traveller, who published in 1893 an account of his journeys in the Pamir mountains of central Asia. In later life he became a Christian Scientist. Her elder brother, Alexander Edward Murray (1871&#150;1962), who succeeded as eighth earl of Dunmore, won the Victoria Cross in 1897 during the Tirah campaign on the north-west frontier of India.<br>
<br>Lady Evelyn's interest in both travel and Islam developed during a childhood punctuated by winters in Algeria and Egypt, where she accompanied her father on sorties into the desert. In Algeria she learnt to speak Arabic and delighted in escaping her governess to visit local mosques with her Algerian friends. She later considered that, &#145;unconsciously I was a little Moslem at heart&#146;  (<span class="italic">Pilgrimage</span>, xiii). However, she forgot Arabic and her Muslim friends amid the European social scene in Cairo, where, on 23 April 1891, she married John Dupuis Cobbold (1861&#150;1929), a country gentleman, sportsman, and brewer who at the age of twenty-one had succeeded as head of Cobbold's brewery in Suffolk. Their marriage was unhappy, but produced a son and two daughters.<br>
<br>Influenced by her traveller father and perhaps encouraged by tales of her relative, Jane Digby, who settled in Syria with her Bedouin husband, Lady Evelyn yearned to escape Suffolk and the &#145;restlessness and mad endeavour of modern life&#146; to return to the desert  (<span class="italic">Wayfarers</span>, 4). In 1911 she set out with an American friend, Frances Gordon Alexander (<i>d</i>. 1931), on a comfortable three-week round trip from Cairo to the Libyan desert. The diary of their uneventful but romantic journey was published in 1912 under Lady Evelyn's name in London and Frances's in New York. The two texts are almost identical but Lady Evelyn's is more enthusiastic for Islam as a simple, democratic, living faith.<br>
<br>Lady Evelyn travelled further in the Middle East before the First World War. She chanced upon T. E. Lawrence near Petra in 1914, and lent him enough money to return to Damascus  (Lawrence, 287). By the time they met again in Egypt the following year, Lady Evelyn had renounced Christianity for Islam and taken the Muslim name Zainab (&#145;scented flower&#146;). Though Islam seemed to offer an antidote to modern, secular Western society, she only began to question her religious identity after a chance meeting with the pope, who assumed she was Catholic. Subsequent study of Islam persuaded her that Islam was the religion &#145;most calculated to solve the world's many perplexing problems, and to bring to humanity peace and happiness&#146;  (<span class="italic">Pilgrimage</span>, xiv).<br>
<br>A private and independent person, Lady Evelyn eschewed the mosque and Muslim Mission at Woking, but attended affiliated social and pan-Islamic meetings in nearby London. There she befriended numerous Turcophiles, including Marmaduke Pickthall, whom she unsuccessfully encouraged publicly to profess Islam during dinner at Claridge's in 1915, two years before his eventual public declaration  (Fremantle, 257). After the First World War she urged the British government to prevent further fragmentation of the Ottoman empire and guarantee the temporal power of the Ottoman caliph. She donated money to Pickthall's pro-Turkish Islamic Information Bureau, and in 1919 was the only female signatory of a memorial to the government calling for appeasement towards Turkey.<br>
<br>Lady Evelyn did not attempt to convert members of her family and though her husband sympathized with Turkey, he was not attracted to Islam. When they finally separated in 1921 Lady Evelyn took possession of a house in London and the substantial Glencarron estate on the north-west coast of Scotland, where she pursued her passion for deerstalking, shooting, and fishing.<br>
<br>In 1933, at the age of sixty-five, Lady Evelyn became the first British Muslim woman to make the <i>hajj</i> (pilgrimage to Mecca). She travelled in style, hiring a chauffeured car and receiving special attention through introductions from Harry St John Bridger Philby. Her <i>hajj</i> diary, published by Murray's in 1934, received a mixed reception because it combined travelogue with a bold treatise on Islam and Muslim history for Western, non-Muslim readers. Lady Evelyn presented Islam as a tolerant, peaceful, flexible Abrahamic faith. She also drew upon her privileged experience of both the male and female spheres in Arabia to defend and justify Islamic codes regarding the social and legal position of Muslim women. Her second book for Murray's, by comparison a dull account of a trip to Kenya, was published in 1935. But it was for making the <i>hajj</i> that Lady Evelyn became known. Overcoming prohibitions against women, she talked about her experience at the Central Asian Society's dinner club and the Travel Club, contributed articles to such journals as the <span class="italic">Geographical Magazine</span>, and became a patron of the Muslim Society of Great Britain.<br>
<br>For all her love of travel, Lady Evelyn considered Britain home. On the eve of the <i>hajj</i>'s concluding feast of sacrifice she longed to see &#145;green fields, grey skies, to hear the splash of rain&#146;, and so obtained permission from Ibn Sa&#145;ud to leave early  (<span class="italic">Pilgrimage</span>, 237). Eccentric and difficult in later life, Lady Evelyn continued to flit between London and Glencarron until, about 1959, a broken hip forced her into an Inverness nursing home, where she remained bedridden and died of cardiovascular degeneration on 25 January 1963. In accordance with her wishes, she received a Muslim burial in a remote spot at Glencarron. Her family persuaded the doubtful officiating imam that the grave was facing Mecca, and a slab of stone was placed upon it inscribed with a Koranic verse describing God as &#145;the light of the heavens and the earth&#146;  (<span class="italic">Koran</span>, 24: 35).<br>
