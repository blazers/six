<span class="headword">Spence <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>Butler]</span>,  William</span>  (1650/51&#150;1699), <span class="occ">conspirator and private secretary</span>, was &#145;born of mean parents&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1683</i>, 370) at Sandreford in Fife, the son of Margaret Millar, though Spence is an Orcadian name and local tradition has it that his family hailed from the Orkney Isles. On 19 August 1684 he was said to be aged about thirty-three. He had a brother, Thomas, and four sisters. About 1676&#150;7 he entered the service of Sir Daniel Carmichael, in whose employ he remained for about a year, before becoming secretary to the earl of Argyll. He served as courier for Argyll at the time of the Rye House plot and Monmouth rebellion, operating under the name of Butler. He travelled to London in October 1682, possibly to meet with the English dissidents who were planning an insurrection, and left for the Netherlands on 8 November, where Argyll, by now a condemned traitor who had fled justice, had taken refuge. Spence was back in London by June 1683, and was apprehended at his lodgings at the Pewter Pot, in Leadenhall Street, on the early morning of the 27th, following the arrest the day before of Major Abraham Holmes, who was taken in possession of a number of ciphered letters from Argyll which he said he had received from Butler (Spence). Spence insisted he knew nothing of any political plots, claiming that he was a student of divinity at the College of Utrecht and had come to London to buy books, though he did admit that he recognized one of the letters to be in Argyll's hand.<br>
<br>Spence was imprisoned in the Marshalsea in heavy irons, but he continued to protest his innocence and so was deported to Scotland in November 1683, where the government had the option of using torture. Although Charles II wrote to his Scottish council ordaining Spence to be put to the boots &#145;to extort a discoverie of the late designes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Historical Notices</span>, ed. Laing, 463), and despite the fact that Holmes, in his examination of December 1683, had revealed that Spence knew how to decipher Argyll's letters, the Scottish chancellor, the earl of Aberdeen, refused to put Spence to the question. English experts managed to decipher enough of the correspondence to confirm that it contained highly incriminating material, and, following the replacement of Aberdeen as chancellor by the earl of Perth and the receipt of a further letter from Charles II in the summer of 1684 authorizing torture, the Scottish council finally decided to proceed against Spence. Torture could be used in Scotland in capital cases when there was a solid presumption of guilt but only one witness to the crime, instead of the required two (the so-called <i>semiplena probatio</i>, or half-proof). However, enduring the torture was supposed to purge one of all suspicion; the suspect was not to be put to the torture again. There was no half-proof against Spence for a capital offence, but he was subjected to three different types of torture on different occasions: first, on 26 July 1684, he was put to the boot; then he was deprived of sleep for several days and nights; and finally, on 7 August, he was subjected to the thumbscrews. At last he agreed to co-operate. He helped decipher a letter written by Argyll from the Netherlands dated 21 June 1683 which talked about plans for a co-ordinated uprising in Scotland and England, and although he was probably telling the truth when he said that he did not know what was in it, he nevertheless confessed that he did &#145;truly believe there was an Insurrection intended&#146;, the grounds being &#145;the defence of the Protestant Religion&#146; and &#145;the Liberties of the Kingdom&#146;  (Mackenzie, 26).<br>
<br>After a brief spell in Dumbarton Castle, Spence was set at liberty in January 1685, whereupon he rejoined Argyll and the exiled dissident community in the Netherlands, becoming secretary to Argyll's council of war. In early February he was arrested at Harwich, posing as an art buyer, carrying letters from English malcontents in Utrecht, though the letters appear to have been devoid of political information (the more important messages were to be transmitted orally) and he was soon released. Later that month, back in the Low Countries, he sent a letter to the duke of Monmouth in Brussels informing him that Argyll was preparing to launch an invasion and inviting him to lend his support. Spence sailed with Argyll's invasion force in May, which stopped first at the Orkney Isles, where Spence, who had an uncle living at Kirkwall, was sent ashore to enlist recruits. Spence was captured along with his co-conspirator, Dr William Blackader, and the pair were subsequently sent as prisoners to Edinburgh in early June. Spence was tried for treason on 16 July 1685, found guilty, and condemned to be hanged on 22 July, but was reprieved at the intercession of Lord Dumbarton in the hope that he might be made use of to make a fuller discovery of the plot or to secure convictions against other leading Scottish malcontents. According to Robert Wodrow, he remained in prison until the revolution; he was certainly still in custody in April 1686, though he may have been free by August 1687, when &#145;two parcels containing scandalous libels against the King and his Government&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1687&#150;9</i>, 61) and intended for William Spence or his assigns were found on board a ship recently arrived in England from the Netherlands.<br>
<br>After the revolution, the Williamite regime made some attempt to compensate Spence for his sufferings. In January 1690 he was appointed principal warden of the mint in Scotland, and in December of the following year receiver-general of the bullion: positions which together probably carried a salary of &pound;1250 Scots. Marriage followed position and income, and on 17 October 1692 Spence married Jean Alexander, the widow of an Edinburgh brewer named Alexander Inglis. Spence died in 1699: he was explicitly described as deceased when the successors to his offices were appointed on 26 October. Twelve years later his widow and son William sought (eventually successfully) to be released from a debt of &pound;310 still owing to the crown on Spence's account as receiver-general, pleading against it &pound;160 that he had spent in 1691 in getting the instruments and materials necessary for setting up the mint in Scotland, and also that he had died leaving his widow with several small children unprovided for. The clause in the <span class="roman">Scottish Claim of Right</span> (1689) regulating the use of torture was in part a response to the treatment meted out to Spence in 1684.<br>
