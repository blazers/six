<span class="headword">Wakefield <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Brewin]</span>,  Rebecca</span>  (1844&#150;1873), <span class="occ">missionary wife</span>, was born in Mountsorrel, Leicestershire, on 19 August 1844, the only daughter and youngest of four children born to Simeon Brewin (<i>d</i>. 1857), a hosier and draper and Methodist local preacher, and his wife, Rebecca (1802/3&#150;1862), daughter of Richard Wale, baker, of Mountsorrel, and herself active in local Methodist and temperance activities, and a role model for her daughter. Theirs was a close-knit, middle-class Methodist community. By 1857 Rebecca Brewin had lost two brothers, and she experienced a new religious commitment. By 1861, at seventeen, after attending school in Mountsorrel and in Loughborough, she became mistress of a school for &#145;young ladies&#146;. After the death of her father and mother, she left the school in 1864 and moved to Birmingham to live with an aunt. In the same year she received a letter from her childhood friend John Mitchel, a missionary in Ceylon; he proposed marriage and she accepted, believing that she must redouble her efforts in the service of God. She was twenty, with dark brown hair and eyes, &#145;above the average height, well formed, and inclining to stoutness&#146;  (Brewin, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 22).<br>
<br>Wherever she lived, Rebecca taught Sunday school and actively joined in other church-related activities. Late in 1865 she lost both her aunt and her fianc&eacute;, who died of cholera in Ceylon, and went to live with her remaining brother Robert Brewin, a Methodist minister. In 1867 they moved to Plumstead, near Woolwich, and in 1868 to Louth, Lincolnshire. She met Thomas Wakefield (1836&#150;1902) in May 1869 at the annual assembly of the United Methodist Free Churches Missionary Society. A pioneer missionary in east Africa, he had established a station at Ribe, among the Nyika north of Mombasa. They married on 2 December 1869 and left England on 24 February 1870.<br>
<br>Their storm-tossed voyage to Zanzibar took ninety-seven days in a small sailing ship and the discomfort was aggravated by Rebecca's pregnancy; their daughter, Helena Rebecca (Nellie), was born at Zanzibar on 16 October 1870. The Wakefields moved to Ribe to a two-room stone house and Rebecca took up her duties as a missionary wife. She taught the women sewing, led the singing at services, and occasionally taught the boys as well. Like other Europeans she met, she complained about Arab and African laziness and thievery. Yet she was truly distressed that British missionaries were not allowed to aid escaped slaves. She suffered periodic bouts of fever, and disastrous household losses wreaked by ants and rats that ate their way through books, clothing, and the mission's piano. Outside, night-prowling leopards scavenged their fowl and goats. In March 1873 Sir Bartle Frere visited Ribe on a government mission. His servants cooked for the thirteen officers of his party; Rebecca, again pregnant, fed his escort of fifty soldiers. Grave illness followed the birth of the Wakefields' son Bertie on 8 June 1873, and Rebecca died on 16 July, four days after she lost her son. They were buried together in the cemetery at the Ribe missionary station.<br>
<br>For Rebecca Wakefield growing up in an earnest religious environment made the choice of being a missionary wife a desirable challenge. To preach the gospel to the &#145;heathen&#146; was an exciting religious adventure for women as well as for men. When she died at twenty-nine, she was experienced as a worker in the field, dispensing medicine daily, planning Christian festivals, and self-consciously providing a model for Christian womanhood. Her brother Robert Brewin turned her graphic letters home into her memorial, <span class="italic">Memoirs of Rebecca Wakefield, wife of the Rev. T. Wakefield, United Methodist Free Churches missionary in eastern Africa</span> (1876).<br>
