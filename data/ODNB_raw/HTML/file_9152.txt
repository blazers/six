<span class="headword">Fanshawe <span class="st"> [Fanshaw]</span>,  Thomas</span>, first Viscount Fanshawe of Dromore  (1596&#150;1665), <span class="occ">exchequer official</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9148/', "Sir Henry Fanshawe (1569&#150;1616)")</script> and Elizabeth (1577?&#150;1631), youngest daughter of customer Thomas Smythe, and was born on 16 November 1596. Apparently less brilliant than his father and uncle, or his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9149/', "Richard Fanshawe")</script>, he was given an MA degree at Cambridge in 1624 at the king's request. The office of king's remembrancer, previously held by his father, was held in trust while he went to France in 1618 to finish his education. In 1619 he was sworn in and although he evidently carried out his duties adequately, he was overshadowed as a financial adviser by his uncle, also Thomas Fanshawe. His sister-in-law Ann Fanshawe praised him moderately as &#145;a very worthy, valiant, honest, good natured gentleman, charitable and generous, and had excellent naturall parts, yet cholerick and rash; which was onely incommode to his own domestick family&#146;. His devotion to Charles I was unswerving and he was rewarded with creation as a knight of the Bath at Charles's coronation on 2 February 1626. He was a devout member of the Church of England, and an interesting account survives of the consecrating of his chapel at Ware Park, Hertfordshire, by the bishop of Durham. His first marriage, on 23 September 1627 to Anne (<i>bap</i>. 1607, <i>d</i>. 1628), daughter of Giles Alington, a powerful Hertfordshire neighbour, gave him a distant link to the Cecils; his second marriage, on 24 June 1629 to Elizabeth (<i>bap</i>. 1609, <i>d</i>. 1668), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5824/', "Sir William Cokayne")</script>, brought him a &pound;10,000 dowry, and the couple had nine sons, and seven daughters. Fanshawe was active in local government and took a paternal interest in the welfare of the poor, for example protesting at the sudden reorganization of Christ's Hospital (near Newgate), which was responsible for 1000 orphans who were mostly put out to nurse; when those at Ware were recalled to London, their nurses were obliged to travel with them.<br>
<br>Fanshawe sat for Hertford in every parliament from 1624 to 1641. In December 1640 on the question of the six judges' impeachment he gave his opinion that the House of Commons articles were destructive to the fundamental laws of the realm and the subject's right of property, and contrary to former resolutions in parliament and to the petition of right. In 1641 he voted against the bill for the attainder of Strafford and in 1642 he was expelled from the parliament. He gave unquestioned allegiance to the royalist cause and came under attack for misuse of office. It was suggested that he wrongly admitted his personal clerks and assistants to practise as attorneys on the legal side of the exchequer. As there was the usual family reversion, he relinquished his office to his brother Richard. Richard's delinquency, however, saw the office temporarily lost to the family. His brother, Sir Simon (<i>d</i>. 1680), thought that there was &#145;much animosity against his whole family&#146;  (<span class="italic">Seventh Report</span>, HMC, 137b).<br>
<br>Thomas Fanshawe fought on the royalist side at Edgehill in 1642 and was subsequently at either the king's or Prince Charles's side. In June and July 1643 he and others lent Charles &pound;27,400 on the security of the New Forest, Sherwood Forest, Clarendon Park, and Bowood Park. For a time he was the prince's secretary and as such used in various sensitive missions. He took ships to the Scillies when the prince fled there. In 1649 Charles II gave him a grant from Jersey augmenting his arms. He was abroad with the king at some point since in December 1660 an act naturalizing one of his children had to be obtained. On 13 November 1648 however he petitioned to be allowed to compound for his estate and compounded for &pound;1300. After 1652 he seems to have lived quietly at Ware. Nevertheless, when royalist plans were being developed in 1659 it was taken for granted that he would be involved. Subsequently, he was arrested and his eldest son was sent to the Tower for involvement in a royalist rising (the Booth plot). At the Restoration he was created Viscount Fanshawe of Dromore in the Irish peerage on 5 September 1661. The recovery of the office of king's remembrancer was achieved by a new patent. It brought a comfortable income but it was less valuable than it had been and less influential. While the routine practices were re-established the financial bureaucratic structure was changing. His advice was only sought on matters of routine and much was clearly done by deputy. He was elected MP for Hertfordshire in 1661 and became an active parliamentarian particularly concerned with religious bills.<br>
<br>Fanshawe's personal finances were, however, in dire straits. After 1660 his office was probably worth less than the &pound;1,000 per annum at which it was estimated in the 1630s. Records suggest a certain income of around &pound;250 plus reduced casual amounts, many of the new taxes not making sufficient allowance for the routine exchequer fees. Despite his good will, Charles II did not have the money to repay his father's debts and although warrants were issued they were not paid. Ever loyal, Fanshawe had none the less obediently stripped himself of his legal rights over the New Forest. He died intestate at Hatton Gardens, London, on 26 March 1665, from apoplexy, and was buried on 30 March at Ware. Administration was granted on 23 June 1667 and finalized on 29 May 1671. Perhaps recognizing how shabbily the Fanshawes had been treated, Charles II, who apparently said he had lost the best of men and subjects, granted his widow, Elizabeth, and her heirs an annuity of &pound;600 for thirty-one years.<br>
<br>Fanshawe's sons were all members of the dissolute Stuart court, participating in the high stakes, sports, and gambling. A letter tells the story of a sudden bet between Fanshawe's son, Sir Thomas, and Sir John Morton on the road from Ware to London, in the company of Lord Fanshawe which produced a jape &#145;for which King and Duke laughed not a little&#146;  (<span class="italic">Seventh Report</span>, HMC, 487b). They did not have the resources to support this lifestyle. <a name="cosubject_9152"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Fanshawe</span>, second Viscount Fanshawe of Dromore  (1632&#150;1674), <span class="occ">courtier and exchequer official</span>, who had been deeply involved in the restoration of Charles II, was said by Clarendon to be a rash, foolish, and hotheaded man, although Ann Fanshawe thought him &#145;of excellent understanding, and of great honour and honesty&#146;. In the 1650s the family estate of Ware Park, now worth &pound;1652 per annum, was made over to him, and in return he sold most of the considerable inheritance in Hertfordshire of his childless first wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73927/', "Catherine Ferrers (d. 1660)")</script>, apparently to meet his father's debts. He was active as MP for Hertford in the Cavalier Parliament and a strong supporter of the Church of England. When he inherited the office of king's remembrancer his advice was sought on administrative matters and he evidently carried out many of its duties in person. Nevertheless, his finances declined and in 1668 he sold Ware Park. At his death in 1674 his son Evelyn was a minor and the Treasury had to consider the various letters patent by which the Fanshawes had sought to secure the office. His unmarried brothers, despite their education, legal training, and apparently their exchequer knowledge, could obtain no more than minor positions. Charles was a commissioner for revenue (1670&#150;76) and for excise appeals (1676&#150;89), Henry registrar to the king's remembrancer. Under Charles II, seeking offices where they could, they were scorned by the parvenu Pepys, who described Henry (1634&#150;1685) as a witty but rascally fellow. Such words hardly fitted Charles (1643&#150;1710), who had been a soldier and envoy to Portugal for Charles II, and after his nephew Evelyn's death in 1687 became fourth viscount and king's remembrancer. True to the family, in 1689 he voted against the declaration, declared that the throne was not vacant, refused the oath to William III and was sent to the Tower. On his release he was a comparative nonentity. He died in 1710 and with the death of his youngest brother, Simon, in 1716 the viscountcy became extinct.<br>
