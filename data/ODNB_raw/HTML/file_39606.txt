<span class="headword">Alden, Sir  Percy</span>  (1865&#150;1944), <span class="occ">social worker and politician</span>, was born at Walton Street, in St Thomas's parish, Oxford, on 6 June 1865, the third of six sons (there was also a daughter) of Isaac Alden (<i>b</i>. 1834), a master butcher, and his wife, Harriett Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kemp. It is not known where he received his schooling, though by 1881 he was a pupil teacher in Oxford. At fifteen, while acting as a messenger for the Oxford local examinations delegacy, he met the philosopher T. H. Green, who encouraged him to pursue his studies at Balliol College, Oxford. He was admitted there in October 1884 as one of the talented local boys whom Benjamin Jowett brought into the college during his later years as master. After graduating with thirds in classical moderations (1886) and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1888), he embarked on a course at Mansfield College, the Congregationalist theological college which had recently been founded at Oxford, with the aim of becoming a Baptist minister. His studies were interrupted when, through the influence of A. M. Fairbairn, Mansfield's first principal, he was appointed in 1891 the first warden of the Mansfield House settlement. Inspired by the ideas of T. H. Green and Arnold Toynbee, Mansfield House had been established at Canning Town in West Ham, to the east of London, to enable university men to undertake social work and live among the inhabitants in one of the most deprived areas serving the capital. Its objective was &#145;to provide the conditions for a good life, economically, socially, aesthetically, intellectually, and spiritually for all groups in society&#146;  (Kaye, 134).<br>
<br>Alden, who remained at Canning Town for ten years, was recognized as a pioneer of the settlement movement, adept at generating enthusiasm for the venture both among helpers and local people. His distinctive contribution was to involve the settlement in the municipal politics of West Ham, believing that such political activity was essential to improve social conditions. He set out his views on the role of settlements in local government in a contribution to <span class="italic">University and Social Settlements</span> (1898) edited by his friend the Christian socialist Will Reason. Mansfield House backed candidates for the school board and board of guardians; as a member of the school board, Alden developed provision for children with special educational needs. He was also elected a member of West Ham borough council (1892&#150;1901), of which he was deputy mayor in 1898. In 1895 he organized a census of unemployment in the borough, which led the council to petition parliament that it was the duty of the state to provide employment for able-bodied persons who were out of work. Although not a member of the Independent Labour Party (ILP), Alden supported the Labour group in West Ham, which in 1898 became the first in Britain to run a local council. An exponent of co-operation between middle-class and working-class radicalism, he was labelled a &#145;kid-gloved sort of socialist&#146; by one critic  (Fink, 297).<br>
<br>Alden married on 14 September 1899 Margaret Elizabeth Pearse (1867&#150;1958), a doctor of medicine, the daughter of Joseph Pearse, a missionary. They had four daughters. Margaret Alden, who had been educated at Walthamstow Hall, the school for the daughters of nonconformist missionaries, studied medicine at Edinburgh, Bern, and Geneva. She was senior resident physician of the Canning Town Medical Mission Hospital, part of the Canning Town Women's Settlement, a sister organization to Mansfield House. The author of <span class="italic">Child Life and Labour</span> (1908), she became in the 1920s a medical officer at infant welfare centres.<br>
<br>Alden's political activities grew out of his strong commitment to the Christian inspiration of the Mansfield settlement. &#145;I regard the Labour movement as a religious movement&#146;, he wrote, &#145;and can honestly say that I have found more unselfishness among working men than among any other class&#146;  (Kaye, 145). During the 1890s he became involved in a number of Christian socialist organizations, including the Christian Socialist League and Christian Social Brotherhood. He was concerned, however, at the alienation of working people from organized religion. This he described in his contribution to R. Mudie-Smith's <span class="italic">The Religious Life of London</span> (1904), based on the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> survey of attendance at public worship in London during 1902&#150;3. He viewed the institutional church movement, whose success he had witnessed on travels in the USA, as the most promising way to bring Christian influences to bear upon working-class life. Non-sectarian churches would function as centres of social and educational as well as religious activity for their communities.<br>
<br>Alden stepped down as warden of Mansfield House in 1901, though he retained links as honorary warden and vice-president. He became a Quaker and organized social work for the Society of Friends. During 1901&#150;2 he edited the Liberal daily paper <span class="italic">The Echo</span>, whose writers included Ramsay MacDonald. Alden was a member of the Fabian Society, and in 1903 joined the progressive Liberal discussion group in London the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/47827', "Rainbow Circle")</script>, which promoted collectivist causes. The topics of the papers which he read to the circle included property redistribution and peasant proprietorship, local-government reform and rural housing. In 1904, with other members of the Rainbow Circle, he helped to found the British Institute of Social Service, whose object was principally to gather and distribute data relevant to social service projects, but which in practice became a co-ordinating agency for social reformers.<br>
<br>Alden's own most influential contribution to social policy making was on unemployment. He became secretary of the National Unemployed Committee, created after a meeting in December 1902 sponsored by the ILP and attended by both Labour and radical Liberal figures, to put forward a programme for government action. Alden's book <span class="italic">The Unemployed: a National Question</span> (1905) drew both upon his experience in Canning Town and upon travels in Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium to investigate continental approaches to the problem. He insisted that the state had a responsibility towards the unemployed. His prescriptions included the creation of a minister of commerce and industry, the provision of labour colonies to deal with vagrancy, state subsidies to insurance schemes run by trade unions, and public works to provide employment for those made jobless during trade depressions. His account of the German network of labour exchanges contributed to the development of William Beveridge's ideas on the subject. To Alden, the problem of unemployment exposed the inefficiency and damaging effects of the free market, which needed to be addressed by an ethical reorganization of industry.<br>
<br>Alden was one of the progressive politicians with an appeal to Labour voters for whom Herbert Gladstone, the Liberal whip, found a constituency and provided finance following the electoral pact with MacDonald, on behalf of the Labour Representation Committee, in 1903. He won the Tottenham division of Middlesex from the Conservatives at the general election of 1906 and held it until 1918. Before 1914 he was a leading exponent of the &#145;new Liberalism&#146;, and was among the critics of the failure of John Burns, president of the Local Government Board, to produce radical initiatives to deal with unemployment. Among the many radical causes which he advocated in parliament, he was notable as a defender of the land rights of the indigenous peoples of South Africa. During the First World War he undertook relief work for the Belgian Relief Committee in London, with which his wife was also involved, and was a government commissioner for the relief of Belgian refugees in the Netherlands, for which he was later decorated by the king of Belgium.<br>
<br>A breach between Alden and the Liberal leadership opened up when he opposed military conscription in a parliamentary debate on 6 January 1916. He remained within the party, however, and contributed the chapter on housing to the manifesto <span class="italic">Liberal Policy</span> (1918) put forward by the Asquith Liberals at the general election of 1918. On standing for Tottenham North he was defeated by a coalition Conservative at that election. His sympathy towards ethical socialism and his advanced views on public ownership, set out in an article in the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span> in April 1919, led him into the Labour Party. After unsuccessfully contesting Luton as a Labour candidate in 1922 he was elected for Tottenham South in 1923, but lost the seat in the general election of 1924. Disappointed with the performance of Ramsay MacDonald's first Labour government, and attracted by the innovative proposals for tackling unemployment developed by the Liberal industrial inquiry, he resumed his affiliation to the Liberal Party late in 1927.<br>
<br>Apart from his brief interval in parliament, Alden's principal post-war activity was as a charity administrator. He became chairman of the Save the Children Fund, taking part in refugee relief work in the Balkans, for which he received Hungarian and Bulgarian honours. He was bursar of the trust founded by his friend Sir Richard Stapley (1842&#150;1920), a businessman, philanthropist, supporter of the Liberal Party, and stalwart of the Rainbow Circle, to help those who were too poor to pursue studies at university or at other institutions of higher education. He also chaired the Christian Social Research Trust founded in 1924 by Sir Halley Stewart, his own Halley Stewart lectures for 1936 being published as <span class="italic">Aspects of a Changing Social Structure</span> (1937). Their theme, &#145;the growing interest of the State in social and industrial problems&#146;, had been Alden's lifelong concern. In 1933 he was knighted on the recommendation of Ramsay MacDonald. He was killed during an air raid by a German flying bomb in Tottenham Court Road, London, on 30 June 1944.<br>
