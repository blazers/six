</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Onslow,  Arthur</span>  (1691&#150;1768), <span class="occ">speaker of the House of Commons</span>, born at Kensington, London, on 1 October 1691, was the elder son of Foote Onslow (1655&#150;1710), first commissioner of excise, and his wife, Susannah, the daughter and heir of Thomas Anlaby of Etton, in the East Riding of Yorkshire, and the widow of Arnold Colwall of Woodford, Essex. His great-grandfather was the politician Sir Richard Onslow (1601&#150;1664). He was educated at Winchester College and matriculated at Wadham College, Oxford, as a fellow commoner on 12 October 1708, but took no degree. He was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1713. However, he made little headway in the practice of law. He became a bencher of the Inner Temple in 1728 and served as recorder of Guildford and high steward of Kingston in 1737.<br>
<br>On 8 October 1720 he married Anne (1703&#150;1763), the daughter of John Bridges of Thames Ditton, Surrey, and the niece and coheir of Henry Bridges of Ember Court in the same parish. They had a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20790/', "George Onslow, first earl of Onslow (1731&#150;1814)")</script>, and a daughter, Anne, who died unmarried on 20 December 1751. Onslow had not been a wealthy man, but his marriage greatly improved his financial circumstances.<br>
<br>At a by-election in February 1720 Onslow had been returned to the House of Commons as a whig MP for the borough of Guildford, which he continued to represent until the dissolution of parliament in July 1727. Only three references to his speeches during the period he was a private member are known. He took part in the debate in November 1722 on the proposal for raising &pound;100,000 upon the real and personal estates of the Roman Catholics, and &#145;declared his abhorrence of persecuting anybody on account of their opinions in religion&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 8.52). In April 1725 he strenuously opposed the motion for the reversal of Bolingbroke's attainder, and in March 1726 he supported Richard Hampden's petition on behalf of the latter's great-grandfather, who had opposed Charles I's ship-money levy in 1637. In 1726 he was one of the Commons managers at the trial before the House of Lords of Lord Chancellor Macclesfield, who had been impeached for embezzlement. At the general election in August 1727 he was returned for both Guildford and Surrey. He elected to serve for Surrey, and continued to represent that county until his retirement from the Commons at the dissolution in March 1761.<br>
<br>At the opening of the new parliament, on 23 January 1728, Onslow was unanimously elected speaker. He was the third member of his family to hold this office, to which he was unanimously re-elected in 1735, 1741, 1747, and 1754. His speakership spanned the entire reign of George II, and by the end of the twentieth century he still held the record for length of service in the office. He was sworn of the privy council at Hampton Court on 25 July 1728, and on 13 May 1729 accepted the post of chancellor and keeper of the great seal to Queen Caroline (who was godmother to his son).<br>
<br>Onslow was a man of rare integrity in an age of corruption, and he realized that the stability of parliament was being undermined by the sordid political intrigues of the day. He was the first speaker to recognize the crucial importance of distancing the chair from all such discreditable activity and of asserting its independence and authority. It was a task for which he was eminently suited, and his renown rests exclusively on his greatness as a speaker. Onslow set the pattern for the impartiality of the chair, but it would be misleading to suggest that he shed his party associations: the total political detachment of the office was to await a later era. He regularly exercised his right to speak and vote in committee, he was known to attend ministerial meetings, and his close friendship with Sir Robert Walpole undoubtedly assisted the furtherance of his early career. But he did not hesitate to oppose government policy when he felt strongly about an issue, and he spoke out against measures he disliked, such as the <span class="roman">Regency Bill</span> of 1751 and the <span class="roman">Marriage Bill</span> of 1753. Above all other considerations he saw the speaker's role as to protect the institution of parliament and the constitution established by the revolution of 1688.<br>
<br>Onslow insisted on the strict observance of the procedure and practice of the house, a discipline which he saw as an indispensable protection against assaults on the integrity of parliament, whether by bullying ministers or intriguing factions. He had a special regard for the rights of independent members, representing the minority, who were beyond the influence of factions. For him, no procedural detail was too trivial to be enforced, and his rulings amounted to a massive codification of contemporary parliamentary practice. Some regarded this insistence on detail as a tiresome obsession, but John Hatsell, who became a clerk-at-the-table during Onslow's tenure of office, confirmed the speaker's view<blockquote>that the forms of proceedings, as instituted by our ancestors, operated as a check and controul on the actions of ministers; and that they were, in many instances, a shelter and protection to the minority, against the attempts of power. (Hatsell, 2.230)</blockquote>His rigid attachment to precedent probably explains his reactionary stand on the question of the reporting of parliamentary debates. In Onslow's day this was held to be a breach of privilege, and on 13 April 1738 he brought the matter to the attention of the house. A debate ensued which led to a resolution condemning the practice.<br>
<br>Onslow insisted that members show proper respect for the dignity of his office and &#145;never permitted a member to come in, or go out of the House, whilst he was in the Chair, without calling him, if he observed, that the member did not make his obeysance to the Chair&#146;  (Hatsell, 2.232). In his relations with the House of Lords he was ever protective of the privileges of the Commons and swift to protest against attempted encroachments on the part of the peers. To protect his own independence he did not hesitate to sacrifice financial advantage. On 20 April 1734 he was appointed to the lucrative office of treasurer of the navy, but he resigned it eight years later, the day after giving his casting vote on a highly political issue, in order to refute the assertion that he was influenced by personal interest. Thereafter he contented himself with the emoluments attached to the speaker's office, which included the fees from private bills. Onslow introduced important administrative reforms in the House of Commons, and it was due to his influence that in 1742 the house first ordered its journals to be printed.<br>
<br>In consequence of failing health Onslow resolved to retire from parliamentary life, and on 18 March 1761 the thanks of the House of Commons were unanimously voted to him &#145;for his constant and unwearied attendance in the chair during the course of above thirty-three years in five successive parliaments&#146;. In returning thanks Onslow was deeply affected, and in a moving speech he expressed all that his life's work had meant to him. A further resolution for an address to the king, that he would be &#145;graciously pleased to confer some signal mark of his royal favour&#146; upon the retiring speaker, was also unanimously carried. Accordingly the king, by letters patent dated 20 April 1761, granted Onslow an annuity of &pound;3000 for the lives of himself and his son George, a provision which was further secured to him by an act of parliament passed in the following year. This was the first occasion when a pension was granted to a retiring speaker. The freedom of the city was voted to Onslow at a court of common council on 5 May 1761 &#145;as a grateful and lasting testimony of the respectful love and veneration which the citizens of London entertain of his person and distinguished virtue&#146;. He was the first speaker to be so honoured. He was admitted to the freedom on 11 June following, but declined, &#145;on account of his official position&#146;, to accept the gold box of the value of 100 guineas which had also been voted by the court. Shortly after his retirement he was elected a trustee of the British Museum. He died at his home in Great Russell Street, London, on 17 February 1768, aged seventy-six. He was buried at Thames Ditton, but his body and that of his wife, who had died in 1763, were afterwards removed to the burial-place of the Onslow family in Merrow church, Surrey.<br>
