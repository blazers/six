<span class="headword">Crowe, Sir  Sackville</span>, first baronet  (<em>c.</em>1600&#150;1683), <span class="occ">entrepreneur and diplomat</span>, was the son of William Crowe of Socketts in Kent and his wife, Anne, daughter of John Sackville of Sussex. He owed the rise of his fortunes in the 1620s to the patronage of George Villiers, first duke of Buckingham, of whose accounts he was treasurer from 1624 to 1628. Buckingham's influence was responsible for Crowe's being entrusted with the delicate mission of pawning some of the duke's and king's jewels at Amsterdam in 1626, his being created baronet in 1627, and his appointment as treasurer of the navy in March 1627. He proved incapable of meeting the financial demands of this last office, and his predecessor Sir William Russell had to step into the breach and ultimately replaced him in 1630. Crowe's long-standing ambition to secure the lease of the royal ironworks in the Forest of Dean was finally rewarded in 1635 when he and his partners obtained the lease after the existing lessees had fallen foul of the royal forest jurisdiction.<br>
<br>In November 1633 Crowe was appointed ambassador at Constantinople, though he was unable to take up the appointment for five years. In the meantime he engaged in a fierce dispute, both with the Levant Company, which financed the embassy but no longer nominated its occupant, and with the retiring ambassador, Sir Peter Wyche. The issue was the right to &#145;strangers' consulage&#146;, the duties payable by foreigners shipping goods under the protection of the English flag. The Levant Company claimed the right to these dues, but both Wyche and Crowe claimed them for the crown. Charles I provided further occasion for dispute among all three parties by formally alienating the right to Crowe in 1636, though the latter, in return for compensating payments by the company, waived it until his arrival in Constantinople in October 1638. Thereafter the dispute grew fiercer and was to be further exacerbated by Crowe's royalist and the company's parliamentarian sympathies. Believing that the merchants were responsible for his sequestration in 1644, following the interception of a letter of his to Charles I, Crowe retaliated in 1646 by bribing the grand vizier to arrest all the company's factory at Constantinople and some of its merchants at Smyrna. However, the company's far greater resources of baksheesh soon restored them to liberty.<br>
<br>In January 1647 a new ambassador, Sir Thomas Bendysh, was appointed and, following his arrival in Constantinople, Crowe and his wife were forcibly deported in November. On reaching London in April 1648, Crowe was sent to the Tower, where he remained until 1656. While there he submitted to an unsympathetic government in 1652 and 1653 projects for the improvement of the manufacture of iron ordnance and for general economic improvement, similar to his later and, in the former case, more successful, schemes after the Restoration.<br>
<br>In other respects the Restoration did not bring the looked-for revival of Crowe's fortunes. In 1662 the royal grant of control of the tapestry manufactory at Mortlake founded by Charles I brought disaster, even though it was coupled with an annual subsidy of &pound;1000. Writing to the countess of Rutland in 1670 from his &#145;uncouth cell&#146; in the Fleet prison, where he had been committed for debt, Crowe was scathing about the quality of the tapestries produced by William, earl of Craven, and his associates, who had taken over from him at Mortlake in 1667. After his release the fairly lucrative office of secretary and clerk of the signet in Wales and the marches was bestowed upon him in October 1671. He had acquired an estate in Carmarthenshire and became a deputy lieutenant of that county in July 1674. But insolvency again intervened and he died in the Fleet prison in 1683.<br>
<br>One product of Crowe's connection with Buckingham in the 1620s was his spectacular marriage in 1634 into the duchess's family&#151;to Mary, daughter of Sir George Manners and sister of John Manners, later eighth earl of Rutland. The bride's mother bitterly deplored &#145;my daughter's offence to God and disobedience to me&#146; in marrying so far beneath her, but Lady Crowe seems loyally to have shared her husband's sharp vicissitudes of fortune. Crowe was succeeded by his only child, Sir Sackville Crowe, on whose death the baronetcy became extinct.<br>
