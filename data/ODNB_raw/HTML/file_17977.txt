<span class="headword">Manning,  Samuel</span>  (1821&#150;1881), <span class="occ">Particular Baptist minister and journal editor</span>, was born on 26 November 1821 in Leicester. His family were well known there: his father, John Manning, was several times elected mayor, and before his conversion to Baptist principles was a churchwarden at St Martin's, Leicester. Samuel grew up in &#145;the bracing spiritual atmosphere&#146;  (<span class="italic">Baptist Hand-Book</span>, 308) provided by the ministry of the Revd James Philippo Mursell, a political radical and founder of the Leicester and Leicestershire Political Union. Although little is known of his early education, it seems Manning was destined not for the ministry but for commerce, and aged eighteen he was sent to work for a Liverpool business house. While in Liverpool he worshipped with a Baptist congregation at Pembroke Chapel, and was baptized by the Revd C. M. Birrell on 27 November 1842, the day after his twenty-first birthday. About six months later Manning expressed a desire to enter the ministry, and with the support of Birrell and the church he went to study at Bristol Baptist college in the autumn of 1843. Before completing the course at Bristol, Manning, on his tutors' advice, studied for a time at Glasgow University. At the end of 1847 Samuel Manning was invited to preach (initially on a trial basis) at the church at Sheppard's Barton, Frome, Somerset; he accepted its call and was ordained on 21 April 1848. During his fifteen-year pastorate the chapel was rebuilt and large schoolrooms added.<br>
<br>In 1850 Manning's first serious publication, a collection of essays defending the historical truth of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> reprinted from <span class="italic">The Church</span>, appeared as <span class="italic">Infidelity Tested by Fact</span>. While at Frome, Manning wrote some tracts for the Religious Tract Society and articles for the <span class="italic">Eclectic Review</span>, the <span class="italic">Christian Spectator</span>, and <span class="italic">The Freeman</span>. His literary output earned him the editorship of the <span class="italic">Baptist Magazine</span>, which he held from 1857 to 1861. His next project, <span class="italic">Selections from the Prose Writings of John Milton</span>, was published in 1862 for the <span class="roman">Bunyan Library</span> series. At Frome he was a popular lecturer on politics (he was a Liberal) as well as on literary and religious subjects. Manning was well liked and was regarded by contemporaries as an entertaining storyteller and a witty conversationalist. He married the daughter of a Mr Hope of Liverpool, and they had three sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>In 1863 the Religious Tract Society appointed Manning its book editor, and he resigned his Sheppard's Barton pastorate. In keeping with the society's goal of producing &#145;Christian literature&#146; in its widest sense, Manning began what would become a series of travelogues, beginning with <span class="italic">Swiss Pictures: Drawn with Pen and Pencil</span> (1866). These travel books, attractively produced, proved popular Christmas sellers, and offered not only a physical description of a country (they were lavishly illustrated) but an assessment of the social, moral, and religious life of the people. <span class="italic">Swiss Pictures</span> was followed by books on Spain (1870), Italy (1872), Egypt and Sinai (<span class="italic">Land of the Pharaohs</span>, 1875), America (1876), England (1877), and the Holy Land (a compilation of <span class="italic">These Holy Fields</span>, <span class="italic">Land of the Pharaohs</span>, and <span class="italic">Pictures from Bible Lands</span>, 1879); the last two books were produced jointly with his friend Samuel Gosnell Green. He accepted an honorary LLD from the University of Chicago in 1869 and in 1876 was appointed a secretary of the Religious Tract Society, where he supported (along with S. G. Green and Sir Charles Reed) the candidature of G. A. Hutchinson for the editorship of the <span class="italic">Boy's Own Paper</span>. Manning was a member of the committee of the Baptist Missionary Society and served as a deacon to the church at Cornwall Road, Notting Hill. His health began to fail, but he continued to work at the society's offices in Paternoster Row until about three months before his death. He died at his home, 35 Ladbroke Grove, Notting Hill, London, on 13 September 1881, and on 16 September was buried in Kensal Green cemetery, London.<br>
