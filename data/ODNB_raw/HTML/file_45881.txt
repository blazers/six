<span class="headword">Dicks,  John Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1818, <em>d.</em> 1881), <span class="occ">publisher</span>, was born in London and baptized on 20 September 1818 at the church of St Dunstan, Stepney, the son of John Dicks and his wife, Sibyl. Not much is known of his early life, but he appears to have had at least three sisters, Elizabeth, Sibyl Rebecca, and Jane, as well as one brother, Walter George. John Thomas Dicks himself later married, and he and his wife, Maria Louisa, had ten children, including the two sons named in his will as executors, Henry and John Thomas, and a daughter, Kate Alice Taylor, whose husband William and children he excluded from his will by codicil.<br>
<br>Dicks began in the printing trade in 1832, being employed in the Stationery Office by the queen's printer, as well as in other offices. In 1841 he became the chief assistant of P. P. Thomas, a scholar of Chinese, who was at that time in the business of publishing, printing, and stereotyping in Warwick Square. Dicks's subsequent career and the expansion of his publishing business were intricately tied up with the fortunes of G. W. M. Reynolds, a radical, and purveyor of popular and often sensational fiction; he was the &#145;most popular writer in England&#146; in the nineteenth century according to <span class="italic">The Bookseller</span> (July 1868, 447). Early in his career Reynolds had several bankruptcies, but his association with Dicks turned him into a wealthy man. In turn, Reynolds's popular novels and periodicals, which provided a good portion of Dicks's list throughout most of the mid-nineteenth century, made a fortune for Dicks.<br>
<br>Their connection began in 1848 when Dicks, still employed by Thomas, took over as publisher of <span class="italic">Reynolds's Miscellany</span>, establishing an office at Wellington Street North, Strand, London. For a decade after 1848 Dicks published Reynolds's novels and periodicals including a very successful Sunday paper, <span class="italic">Reynolds's Weekly Newspaper</span>, which started in 1850. He was also the publisher of Reynolds's massive multi-novel series, <span class="italic">Mysteries of the Court of London</span> (1849&#150;56). In 1852 Dicks, &#145;the managing and confidential clerk&#146; of Reynolds's publications, had &#145;all the details of the business placed under his supervision&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reynolds's Weekly</span>, 18 July 1852, 3). In 1863 the two men formed a partnership, and eventually (probably at Reynolds's death in 1879) Dicks purchased for a large sum the name and copyrights of G. W. M. Reynolds.<br>
<br>In the 1860s Dicks's publishing house had begun to expand dramatically by reprinting novels, plays, &#145;classics&#146;, and miscellaneous material rather than originating new works. According to Montague Summers, during the latter half of the century the firm was &#145;one of the largest and busiest printing and publishing offices in England&#146;  (Summers, 552). In 1866 Dicks began his first and one of his most popular series of cheap reprints, <span class="roman">Dicks's Shakespeare</span> (individual plays for a penny, thirty-seven plays in one volume for a shilling); in 1868 Reynolds announced at the annual dinner of the firm that 150,000 copies of the penny Shakespeare had been sold  (<span class="italic">Reynolds's Weekly</span>, 12 July 1868, 1). In 1864 Dicks began to issue <span class="roman">Dicks's Standard Plays</span>, at 1<i>d</i>. each. For over twenty years he published a play a week and from 1882 two a week. Over 1000 were published altogether, and include such titles as Dion Boucicault's <span class="italic">The Shaughraun: an Original Drama in Three Acts, Illustrative of Irish Life and Character</span>, numbered 390 in the <span class="roman">Standard Plays</span> series; Henry Hersee's <span class="italic">All's Fair in Love: an Original Charade Written Expressly for Drawing-Room Acting</span>, billed as number 490 of <span class="roman">Dicks's Standard Charades and Comedies</span>; and F. F. Cooper's <span class="italic">The Spare Bed, or, The Shower Bath: a Farce in Two Acts</span>, number 786 in the <span class="roman">Standard Plays</span>. Dicks's dramatic series also included adaptations of popular novels, with dramatizations of Charles Dickens's proving especially popular. At least one catalogue of Dicks's publications was printed, as the <span class="italic">List of Dicks' Standard Plays and Free Acting Drama</span> (1884). Many of the popular melodramas, farces, and comedies of the nineteenth century exist only in a Dicks imprint.<br>
<br>In 1869 Dicks merged <span class="italic">Reynolds's Miscellany</span> with <span class="italic">Bow Bells</span>, the latter being a popular family magazine that he had begun in 1864, designed &#145;to cultivate a taste for beauty and goodness in humanity&#146;. One historian has suggested that as Dicks prospered, his increasing respectability contrasted sharply with the nature of the earlier publications on which he had collaborated with Reynolds, and that the title change of <span class="italic">Bow Bells</span> was perhaps a tactic used &#145;to conceal the way by which he had come to his wealth&#146;  (James, 47). Also in 1869 he began the series <span class="roman">Dicks's English Novels</span> (6<i>d</i>. a volume), which eventually included 243 titles, by authors such as Dickens and Thackeray, but also by lesser-known novelists of the period. The wide variety of other publications that were issued at one time or another under the Dicks imprint included various albums of songs (such as <span class="italic">Gems from the Great Composers</span>); illustrations and prints (Hogarth's various works and Francis Wheatley's <span class="italic">London Cries</span>); and chromolithographs (at 6<i>d</i>.) &#145;for framing&#146;, including works by Landseer and portraits of various politicians. In 1884, three years after his death, the firm began a new series in his name, <span class="roman">Dicks's English Library of Standard Works</span>.<br>
<br>Dicks retired from the firm in the late 1870s. His two sons, Henry and John Thomas, continued to manage the firm for him, and he moved to the villa St Valentine in Menton, France. Apparently he maintained some connection with the business: writing long after the fact, George Augustus Sala gives the only known personal account of Dicks, recalling that:<blockquote>at a pretty little villa at Menton there resided a very old business friend of mine, the Late Mr. John Dicks &hellip; [whose] appetite for novelettes was insatiable, and whenever I wanted cash I had only to scribble for a few hours, take the copy over to Menton and receive from the hands of my friendly publisher a crisp ten-pound note and two louis and a half in gold. (<span class="italic">Life and Adventures</span>, 2.367)</blockquote>Dicks died at Menton on 4 February 1881. After this the firm bearing his name published from several different London locations, including Effingham House, Arundel Street, Strand (beginning 1905), and finally in 1909 as John Dicks Press Ltd, at 8 Temple Avenue. In 1929 <span class="italic">Reynolds's Newspaper</span> (which continued until 1963) ceased to be published by John Dicks Press Ltd. No further publication was issued under this imprint.<br>
<br>The survival in libraries of books that bear the Dicks imprint is haphazard and his several series of cheap reprints of English classics are almost everywhere incomplete. Because of his policy of issuing and reissuing publications and series almost constantly, the initial publication dates of many of his series are uncertain. But his achievement is clear: he was one of the most important forces in the increase of cheap reading material for the masses. As his obituary indicated, his publishing concern was &#145;a marvel in cheap and good literature&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bow Bells</span>, 2 March 1881).<br>
