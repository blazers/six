<span class="headword">Sturge,  Mary Darby <span class="st"> [Maida]</span></span>  (1865&#150;1925), <span class="occ">medical practitioner</span>, was born at Stoney Lane, Yardley, Birmingham, on 16 October 1862, the daughter of Wilson Sturge (1834&#150;1899), corn merchant, and his wife, Sara, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lloyd (1831/2&#150;1922), a keen Quaker, progressive educationalist, and philanthropist. She was the eldest of ten children in a leading Quaker family in Birmingham&#151;her grandfather Charles Sturge was mayor of Birmingham when she was born. She lived in Birmingham for most of her life, much of it in Edgbaston.<br>
<br>Known to her immediate circle as Maida, Sturge entered Edgbaston High School for Girls, the first such school for girls in Birmingham, on its opening day in 1877. Always in the highest class, she appreciated the wide academic curriculum and learning &#145;to think straight&#146; while also loving poetry, music, and painting. Subsequently, she was one of the first four women scholars at the new Mason Science College, founded in 1880 and, despite some of the academic staff's unease at females studying science, offering women a rare chance of higher education, especially once its students could take the degrees of Victoria and London universities. Sturge helped form the students' union, before leaving in 1886 to study medicine at London University, open to women since 1878. While there she won many honours, including the Prideaux scholarship. She qualified at the London School of Medicine for Women in 1891, the prime institution for women's medical education, thence becoming resident medical director at the Clapham Maternity Hospital and, from 1892 to 1894, resident medical officer of the North Eastern Fever Hospital of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. Addressing the London School of Medicine for Women in 1894, she stressed the high professional demands of medicine.<br>
<br>Obtaining such an education was a Herculean struggle for most women at this time, but Birmingham, albeit not entirely easily, offered more opportunities than most, particularly at the Birmingham and Midland Hospital for Women, established in 1871 principally by men and women from Birmingham's new liberal &eacute;lite. This hospital was highly uncommon both in the control it gave to lay governors and in constitutionally having 50 per cent each of females and males on its committee of management. Unusually, it appointed qualified women doctors before they could be registered in Britain. Its first permanent woman appointee was Sturge's cousin Annie Clark, who had also worked at the Children's Hospital. The respect she earned smoothed the way for Sturge who, after a visit to Egypt and Europe with her father, returned to Birmingham in 1895 to take up general practice. From 1896 she took over the administration of anaesthetics at the Women's Hospital, becoming acting honorary surgeon in 1905, a position she held until February 1924, retiring through ill health although she remained as consulting physician.<br>
<br>Sturge was also secretary of the medical board and involved closely with the Women's Hospital for eleven years, particularly valued for initiating the idea of the Taylor Memorial Home of Rest for older terminally ill women and working so wholeheartedly to ensure it materialized. Her siblings carried out her dying wish for them to support it, by successfully launching a memorial fund which allowed the building of the Dr Mary Sturge Memorial Wing as an extension to the rest home in 1926. Here poorer women could end their lives in quiet dignity.<br>
<br>Aware of the low salaries that nurses earned, Sturge agitated both for a pension fund for staff working at the home and for proper accommodation of the nursing staff. She promoted opportunities for women medical students at the hospital and, on resigning, expressed her desire that a woman doctor should always be chosen as physician to the outpatients, teasingly adding the hope that the medical board would &#145;recognise my ideas as harmless&#146;. She joined the Association of Registered Medical Women in 1892 when its low membership was just beginning to grow and played an active part in the more interventionist Medical Women's Federation (MWF) which evolved from this, becoming its second president from 1920 to 1922. In these years the MWF worked hard for justice for all medical women, achieving some success on equal pay but less on removing the marriage bar. According to Sturge, by 1922 the MWF had become a power recognized by government. Although some women medics questioned the need for a separate women's organization, Sturge had no doubts that it was the only way to stop the daily slights that were such a strain to them and to demonstrate the necessity of having medical women who could advise the state properly on matters such as infant welfare, venereal disease, and birth control.<br>
<br>In Birmingham Sturge energetically promoted the local MWF branch. Indeed, she was at the centre of a growing community of women medics in Birmingham, within which she earned a high reputation as a skilful, devoted doctor who particularly loved being with and observing children. Revering scientific evidence, she promoted her belief in the importance of preventive medical care and the value of sleep, sunshine, and fresh air to treat illness. Described as &#145;much beloved&#146;, energetic, untiring, resourceful, with infectious humour which took the sting out of her &#145;home-truths&#146;, she was extremely generous to all and expected others to be the same.<br>
<br>Ever conscious of women's position, Sturge, like her aunt <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56273/', "Eliza Sturge")</script>, was a keen suffragist, becoming a doughty fighter for women's rights and an active member of the Birmingham Society for Woman's Suffrage. She was also known for her advocacy of temperance, a cause dear to many of her fellow Quakers. Her 1907 book, co-authored with Sir Victor Horsley, <span class="italic">Alcohol and the Human Body</span>, full of current scientific evidence and illustrations from across Europe, sold 85,000 copies in Britain and the USA and went into six editions. Their &#145;Introduction&#146; stressed their desire to present up-to-date knowledge of alcohol solely based on experimental, anatomical, and statistical evidence, although realizing it also had &#145;grave socio-political and national importance&#146;. The book nodded towards eugenics but was principally concerned with the health of all&#151;men, women, and children. Sturge, calling the cause of &#145;Scientific Temperance&#146; her &#145;vocation!&#146;, lectured on it all over the country, using her medical knowledge to back her arguments.<br>
<br>Similarly, like other women in her Quaker community, Sturge backed local nursery education and was much involved in both peace and refugee work during and after the First World War. In particular she did much to help Belgian refugees in Birmingham and on their return home. The success of the Birmingham Children's Home in north Tyrol in 1920 was attributed to her initiative, planning, sympathy, and untiring zeal behind the scenes, especially in collecting and transporting medical supplies across Europe.<br>
<br>Sturge's last letter to the Quakers at Bull Street where she worshipped acknowledged her debt to Quakerism, the &#145;background to my life&#146;. Certainly its values underpinned all her commitments. For example, as the sole woman in an audience of about 200 secretaries of friendly societies, she persuaded them and then the small but powerful medical committee on venereal disease backed by the war cabinet not to undo the work of Josephine Butler. She died at 39 Fox Hill, Selly Oak, Birmingham, from the painful and debilitating illness of Bell's palsy, on 14 March 1925. She left a legacy of goodwill to women doctors in Birmingham.<br>
