<span class="headword">Whitney,  Geoffrey</span>  (1548?&#150;1600/01), <span class="occ">author</span>, the son of Geoffrey Whitney, was most probably born in 1548, though 1552 has been suggested as an alternative  (Borris, 336), near Nantwich, Cheshire, or possibly in London. His family, of minor gentry status descended from the Whitneys of Whitney, Herefordshire, had held a manor at Coole Pilate, near Nantwich, since 1388. His parents held a tenancy at nearby Combermere, where Whitney was probably brought up. He had at least one brother and four sisters, one of whom may have been the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45498/', "Isabella Whitney")</script>. Geoffrey Whitney attended Audlem School, near Nantwich, and then studied briefly at Oxford, and for a longer period at Magdalene College, Cambridge, where his tutor was Stephen Limbert, later master of Norwich School. He appears not to have taken a degree. Between 1570 and 1574 he probably studied law at Thavies' Inn or Furnivall's Inn in London, though he was not called to the bar.<br>
<br>From 1580 (and possibly earlier) to 1586, Whitney was under-bailiff of Great Yarmouth. On 2 August 1580 he made a visit to Scratby Island, off Great Yarmouth, and wrote an account in Latin of the journey. About this time, if not earlier, Whitney increasingly sought and attained the patronage of Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, who was high steward of Great Yarmouth. In 1584 Whitney became acting under-steward of Great Yarmouth, and Leicester supported his application for official tenure of the office. However, Whitney's application was unsuccessful, and he was forced to resign the acting under-stewardship in 1586 in favour of John Stubbes, author of <span class="italic">A Gaping Gulfe</span>. Whitney responded with legal proceedings against the corporation of Great Yarmouth; in 1587, with Leicester's support, he received &pound;45 in compensation on condition that he make no further claim for an office. In late November or early December of 1585 Whitney presented to Leicester a manuscript version of an emblem book, just before the earl's departure to the Low Countries as governor-general. Whitney seems to have come into contact with Dutch intellectuals during his sojourn in Norfolk. In 1586 he contributed verses in commendation of Jan Dousa the elder's <span class="italic">Odae Britannicae</span>. In the early months of 1586 he visited Leiden as a supernumerary in the party of Dousa, taking lodgings from 12 January 1586 for a few nights. On 1 March 1586 he became a student at the new University of Leiden. His period in the Netherlands thus coincided with Leicester's campaign, and Whitney doubtlessly sought to continue his association with the earl, possibly offering himself as a guide to the intellectual culture of Leiden  (Manning, 160).<br>
<br>In the Netherlands, Whitney was persuaded by Leicester and Dousa to publish the emblem book presented in manuscript in the previous year to the earl. Whitney's most famous work, <span class="italic">A Choice of Emblemes and other Devises</span>, was printed at the Plantin press by Fran&ccedil;ois Raphelengius in Leiden in 1586 and dedicated to Leicester. It contains 248 emblems, consisting of illustrations, mottos, and explicating verses generally drawing a moral lesson; the work is a considerable expansion and revision of the manuscript version  (Tung). It draws upon continental emblematists and is preceded in English by the manuscript emblem book of Thomas Palmer as well as comparable works such as Van der Noot's <span class="italic">A Theatre for Voluptuous Worldlings</span> (1569). Nevertheless, Whitney became the pre-eminent emblematist of the Elizabethan period, as recognized by Francis Meres in <span class="italic">Palladis tamia</span>  (1598, 285). Whitney's <span class="italic">Emblemes</span> arguably supports Leicester's militant expansionist protestantism, though the work has also been interpreted as more broadly moralistic and politically cautious. The dedication to Leicester, dated from London on 28 November 1585, praises the earl as &#145;a zelous favorer of the Gospell, and of the godlie Preachers thereof&#146;  (sig. *3); the first emblem celebrates Elizabeth's restoration of reformed religion. Most emblems carry a dedication, such as those on pages 193&#150;5 to the leaders of Leicester's forces in the Netherlands and a number to Whitney's relations and friends.<br>
<br>At some stage Whitney returned to England and apparently to the neighbourhood of his upbringing. He made his will at Royals Green, near Combermere Abbey, on 11 September 1600, and the will was proved on 28 May 1601. He appears to have died unmarried.<br>
