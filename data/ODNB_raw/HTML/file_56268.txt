<span class="headword">Lee,  William</span>  (1815&#150;1883), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland clergyman</span>, was born on 3 November 1815 at Newport, co. Tipperary. He was the son of William Lee, curate of Newport, and afterwards rector of Mealiffe in the diocese of Cashel, and Jane, daughter of Richard White of Green Hall, co. Tipperary. In 1825 he was sent to the nearby endowed school of Clonmel, and on 20 October 1831 he entered Trinity College, Dublin, where he obtained the first (classical) scholarship in 1834. In August 1835 his father died, leaving a wife and five other children, but Lee nevertheless did well at university: at his degree examination in 1836 he obtained the first senior moderatorship in mathematics, and he won the Law mathematical prize in 1837 and the Madden fellowship premium in 1838. After graduating BA in 1837 he was elected a junior fellow in 1839 and proceeded MA in 1840.<br>
<br>In 1841 Lee was ordained in the Church of Ireland, and in 1844 he married Anne, daughter of William English of Farmley, Castleknock, co. Dublin. They had two sons and three daughters. In 1857 Lee was created DD and appointed professor of ecclesiastical history in the University of Dublin. In 1862 he became Archbishop King's lecturer in divinity, and also rector of the college living of Arboe in the diocese of Armagh. Archbishop Trench of Dublin made him his examining chaplain late in the year 1863 and in 1864 preferred him to the archdeaconry of Dublin and the rectory of St Peter's, Dublin. He played an influential role in the reconstruction of the Church of Ireland in the period immediately after disestablishment, becoming a prominent member of the house of convocation, and subsequently of the general convention. When it was proposed to give the laity a share in legislating on matters of doctrine and discipline, however, he entered a strong protest and ceased to attend. In February 1870 he was elected a member of the New Testament Revision Company. He was a prolific writer whose most important works include: <span class="italic">The Inspiration of Holy Scripture: its Nature and Proof</span>, (1854), <span class="italic">Three Introductory Lectures on Ecclesiastical History</span> (1858), and a <span class="italic">Commentary on the Revelation of St. John</span> (1882), in the <span class="roman">Speaker's Commentary</span> on the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. <span class="italic">The University Sermons of William Lee</span>, edited by G. Salmon and J. Dowden, were posthumously published (1886). Lee was a high-churchman and a learned theologian, of strong conservative convictions. His influence was great as a preacher and lecturer. He died of pneumonia at his home, 24/64 Merrion Square South, Dublin, on 11 May 1883 and was buried on 15 May at Mount Jerome cemetery, Dublin. A tablet was erected to his memory in St Peter's Church, Dublin. His daughter <a name="cosubject_56268"></a><span class="headword">Jane Lee</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1895) studied Sanskrit and Lithuanian in Bonn, Germany, and was afterwards <span class="occ">college administrator</span> from 1889. She died on 6 November 1895 at her home in Elgin Avenue, Maida Vale, London.<br>
