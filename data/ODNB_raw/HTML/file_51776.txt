<span class="headword">Burgwin <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Canham]</span>,  Elizabeth Miriam</span>  (1850&#150;1940), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born on 3 September 1850 at Occold, Suffolk, the second child of Samuel Canham, an agricultural labourer, and his wife, Miriam. After moving to London she attended the Practising School attached to Whitelands Training College before taking up a five-year pupil-teaching apprenticeship at St Luke's Parochial Girls' School, Chelsea, in 1864. Soon after completing this she married a London butcher, Thomas William Burgwin (<i>d</i>. in or before 1891), on 12 February 1870. Their only child, Thomas Lane, was born on 3 November in the same year.<br>
<br>From January 1872 to December 1873 Elizabeth Burgwin taught in West Ham, gaining her teacher's certificate by external examination in December 1872. In January 1874 she took up a post as head of Union Street Girls' School, Southwark, a newly established temporary school under the London school board, and it was from there that she and her fellow teachers moved to the new Orange Street Girls' School, also in Southwark, in June 1874. This was located in one of the poorest districts in London, and the pupils were unkempt and malnourished. Soon Mrs Burgwin, as headmistress, began to provide simple midday meals of bread and a hot drink. That led to the establishment of a small local organization to raise funds to supply food to pupils during the winter months. Early in the 1880s the venture received a major boost when she persuaded the journalist and author, George R. Sims, to publicize it in the column he wrote for <span class="italic">The Referee</span>, a leading sporting newspaper. That was repeated in subsequent years, with Elizabeth Burgwin acting as the fund's treasurer, and by the beginning of the twentieth century the Referee Children's Free Breakfast and Dinner Fund had become the largest agency for supplying free meals to scholars in London. In 1895 and 1899 she gave evidence to special committees of the London school board concerning underfed children. She also gave evidence to the Cross commission on the <span class="roman">Elementary Education Acts</span> on 26 November 1886, and to the inter-departmental committee on medical inspection and feeding of children on 23 May 1905, concerning her work to promote the welfare of her pupils.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Burgwin remained at Orange Street until her appointment in October 1891 as the London school board's first superintendent of schools for special instruction. By this time she was a widow, and prior to taking up the post she visited various institutions catering for mentally handicapped people in Britain, France, Germany, and Denmark. She opened the capital's first special classes in the summer of 1892. By 1897, when seven school boards in the country were providing classes for the &#145;feeble-minded&#146;, over a thousand of the 1300 pupils under instruction were taught in one of London's twenty-seven centres or classes, under Mrs Burgwin's direction. In 1905 she was described as having &#145;probably more experience of Special Schools than anyone else in the world&#146;, and the education authorities in Bristol, Brighton, and Birmingham sent their special-school teachers to her for training. She became one of the seven members of the departmental committee on defective and epileptic children in 1896&#150;8. In 1898 she was involved in the establishment of a special school for the physically handicapped, and the provision of facilities for disabled children soon became an important aspect of her work. On 30 June 1905 she gave evidence to the royal commission on the care and control of the feeble-minded.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Burgwin was an enthusiastic supporter of the National Union of Elementary Teachers (or National Union of Teachers (NUT), as it became in 1889). In 1885 she was the first woman to be elected to its executive committee and remained a member of the executive until 1896. She was an enthusiastic and able supporter of the union's charitable activities and in 1878 was present at the inauguration of its Benevolent and Orphan Fund. She was a fund trustee from 1914 until 1936, and was closely involved in the work of the Boys' Orphanage.<br>
<br>Perhaps surprisingly, in view of her determined character and her general breaking of gender moulds, Elizabeth Burgwin was a strong opponent of the cause and tactics of the female suffrage movement; she was a member of the executive committee of the National League for Opposing Woman Suffrage. In 1912 she was an outspoken critic of a motion at the NUT annual conference in favour of votes for women. She was also opposed to the provision of sex education for elementary pupils, arguing in evidence to a London county council sub-committee in 1914 that it was the responsibility of parents rather than teachers to bring up their offspring &#145;in a healthy manner&#146;.<br>
<br>Until her retirement in September 1916, Elizabeth Burgwin remained superintendent of London's special schools and as a sign of their regard, fellow teachers contributed a testimonial of &pound;1000 to commemorate the occasion. She then took up a post with the Ministry of Labour, advising on the award of pensions to widows and children of officers killed in action during the First World War. For this she was made an OBE.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Burgwin died on 1 February 1940 at 147 Brixton Road, London. In an obituary <span class="italic">The Times</span> praised her as &#145;one of the outstanding authorities on the subject of the education of the mentally subnormal child and the technique of teaching which was developed was due in great measure to her initiative, her sympathy, and her understanding&#146;. London's own pre-eminence in this field at the beginning of the twentieth century was a product of her hard work and commitment. <span class="italic">The Times</span> also paid tribute to the wit and good humour which had characterized her long association with London education.<br>
