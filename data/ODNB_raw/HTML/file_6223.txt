<span class="headword">Cooper,  Richard, the elder</span>  (1701&#150;1764), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was born in London on 26 October 1701, the son of William Cooper (<i>d</i>. 1708), bricklayer, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith (<i>d</i>. 1709). He studied at the Merchant Taylors' School, London, until 1712, and in 1717 was apprenticed to John Clarke, stationer: he may also have trained in London with John Pine, who collaborated with Clarke. In 1722 he travelled to Italy, where he began a collection of prints and drawings; in this period he may also have become an associate of the first St Martin's Lane Academy and of Louis Cheron, who taught drawing there and at Great Queen Street. On his return to Britain about 1725 he moved to Edinburgh, originally at the invitation of a Mr Guthrie whom he had met in Rome, and who was probably either the painter Alexander Guthrie or the Alexander Guthrie who was secretary to the board of trustees.<br>
<br>Cooper's arrival in Edinburgh precipitated some remarkable developments in the city's cultural life. In 1726 he engraved the music for Allan Ramsay's <span class="italic">Collection of Scots Songs</span>, and over the next thirty years his studio engraved almost all the music published in Scotland. He was a founder in 1729, and the first treasurer, of the Edinburgh School of St Luke, the earliest academy of artists in Scotland. Other signatories to the founding indenture included the poet Allan Ramsay, the bookseller James Balfour, the art dealer Andrew Hay, the painters John Alexander and Richard Chalmers, the architect William Adam, and the decorator James Norie. The school probably originated through the interaction between Cooper and the academic staff of Edinburgh University, notably Alexander Monro, and from 1731 until at least 1733 the school met at the university. In 1735 Cooper bought a large plot of land in St John Street and established a private academy close to his house. In that year he became first junior and then senior warden of the Canongate lodge of freemasons. He was made a burgess of Edinburgh in 1736 &#145;for good services done and performed to this City&#146;  (Watson, 44). Cooper had quickly established a flourishing business as a general engraver of tickets, music, portraits, views, maps, and book illustrations, having more or less a monopoly of engraving business in the city. He made botanical studies for James Justice and anatomical studies for Alexander Monro. He also sold prints and related items such as wallpaper and acted as an interior decorator to various noblemen and institutions. In 1736 he took Robert Strange as a boarding apprentice. Strange was not entirely pleased when Cooper's marriage, on 24 December 1738 to Ann Lind (1708&#150;1775), the youngest daughter of George Lind, an Edinburgh merchant and baillie, brought about changes in the big house in St John Street, and very shortly a son, also <a href="#cosubject_6223">Richard Cooper [<i>see below</i>]</a>. Samuel Taylor was apprenticed to Cooper in August 1738 and Andrew Bell in 1741. A second son, George (1747&#150;1777), became a writer to the signet and may have travelled in Italy with the third earl of Rosebery in 1757. The School of St Luke probably ceased to function in 1745, when most of the members who had not already died came under suspicion of treason, and Cooper's pupil Strange fled to France.<br>
<br>Cooper, however, remained in Edinburgh. In 1747, after years of determined opposition from the town council and the clerical and university authorities, he completed the building of a theatre on his land in Canongate (which through ancient burgh status was legally outside the jurisdiction of the town council). He leased his theatre for twenty-five years to the managers of the Canongate Concert Hall but took an active part in its operations, employing William Delacour as a scene-painter. He continued to prosper. In September 1749 he bought the house of the Incorporation of Tailors in Canongate and in January 1751 he bought the dean's house in Restalrig village. Here Cooper's third son, William, died in infancy in 1752; in the following year a daughter, Ann, was born. By now he was acting as drawing-master to various noble ladies, while his studio continued to produce anatomical and medical illustrations and most of the maps and prints of any consequence that were produced in Scotland. He made a will in March 1757 leaving all his stock in trade to his son Richard. Cooper died on 20 January 1764 and was buried in Restalrig parish churchyard.<br>
<br>The younger <a name="cosubject_6223"></a><span class="headword">Richard Cooper</span>  (1740&#150;1814)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 6 February 1740 in Edinburgh and trained under his father before, in 1758, following Robert Strange to Paris to study under the famous French engraver J. P. Le Bas. He moved to London in 1761 and launched a proposal for a print of Van Dyck's <span class="italic">The Children of Charles I</span>, and he exhibited figure drawings and engravings at the Society of Artists and at the Free Society until 1764. <span class="italic">The Children of Charles I</span> was published in 1763 and favourably noticed in the <span class="italic">Critical Review</span>. Cooper then travelled in Spain and was the first British engraver to record old masters in Spanish collections. In 1768 he succeeded Alexander Cozens as drawing-master at Eton College, then in 1771 went to Italy, travelling with Thomas Merriman, and visiting Venice, Capua, and Naples, where he was patronized by Sir William Hamilton in 1772&#150;3. The Edinburgh banker Robert Alexander assisted him in getting to Rome, where he became friendly with the Runciman brothers and developed a style of landscape painting close to that of Alexander Runciman. A series of tinted drawings of Rome and its vicinity earned him the nickname the English Poussin. He also became a friend and associate of the painter Jacob More, subsequently acting as More's executor. Cooper painted many Italian views, particularly of Rome, Tivoli, and Naples, some of which were exhibited at the Society of Artists in 1783.<br>
<br>On 11 August 1777 Cooper married Frances Ramsay in Edinburgh; it is not clear whether he took up residence in Edinburgh, but in 1778 he exhibited Italian views at the Royal Academy. About 1787 he settled in Charles Street, in Westminster's fashionable district of St James, and devoted himself to drawing and exhibiting numerous examples of his work at the Royal Academy up to 1809. He taught drawing to Princess Charlotte (1796&#150;1817) and died in 1814.<br>
