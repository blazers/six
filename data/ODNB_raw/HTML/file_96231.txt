</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Heilbron, Dame  Rose</span>  (1914&#150;2005), <span class="occ">barrister and judge</span>, was born on 19 August 1914 at 27 St James Road, Abercromby, Liverpool, the younger daughter of Max Heilbron and his wife, Nellie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Summers. She was originally named Rosie, but this was later changed to Rose. Her father, described as an emigration agent on her birth certificate, ran a boarding house for Jewish emigrants <i>en route</i> to the United States, and then took over a small hotel, in which his daughters were expected to help. But it is said that Rose was allowed to get on with her studying while her elder sister, Annie, did much of the work. Her parents clearly thought it important that she be properly educated. She was sent to the Girls' Public Day School Trust's Belvedere School, Liverpool. There she regularly won prizes in history and drama. She also took elocution lessons, becoming a licentiate of the Guildhall School of Music and Drama at the age of sixteen. Her &#145;mellifluous voice&#146; was a great asset to an advocate, although she never entirely lost a &#145;faint tang of the Mersey&#146;  (Rose, memorial oration). Another great asset was her intelligence. From Belvedere she went to Liverpool University, graduating LLB with first-class honours in 1935 and LLM in 1937. Meanwhile she joined Gray's Inn and in 1936 was the first woman to be awarded a Lord Justice Holker scholarship.<br>
<br>Heilbron was called to the bar on 3 May 1939. She joined the chambers of her pupil master, Richard Trotter, at 43 Castle Street in Liverpool and was elected to the northern circuit on 2 February 1940, proposed by the recorder of Liverpool, Edward Hemmerde. She rapidly built up a substantial criminal defence and personal injury practice. Like Elizabeth Lane, she may have found it easier to get started, despite the ingrained prejudices of clients, solicitors, clerks, and other barristers, because so many of the men were away during the Second World War. But by the time they returned she had proved her worth and her practice continued to grow apace. She was known as &#145;a persuasive advocate who gave her all in the preparation of a case and the mastery of detail&#146;  (Lynch, &#145;Mrs Justice Heilbron&#146;, 159). She worked extremely hard, no doubt because she &#145;always loved her work&#146;  (private information), but also because she had to support herself.<br>
<br>Heilbron was junior counsel in some notable reported cases: <i>Constantine v. Imperial Hotels Ltd</i> (1944), establishing that a common innkeeper could not refuse a room to the famous West Indian cricketer Leary Constantine; <i>Christie v. Leachinsky</i> (1947), establishing that an arrested person must be told the reason for his arrest at the time; and <i>Braddock v. Bevins</i> (1948), in which the Liverpool MP Bessie Braddock sued a Conservative candidate for saying that she had a tacit deal with the Communists. Heilbron appeared alone before the House of Lords in <i>Adams v. Naylor</i> (1946) representing two boys who were injured (one fatally) in a minefield on the sandhills between Crosby and Southport. The wind had blown the sand to cover the warning sign and most of the barbed wire fence. They lost the case for technical reasons but Heilbron was commended by the lord chancellor for her &#145;excellent argument&#146;, and the case led directly to the reform of civil proceedings against the crown in the <span class="roman">Crown Proceedings Act</span> 1947.<br>
<br>Heilbron's personal life also prospered. She met Nathaniel (Nat) Burstein (1905&#150;2010), an Irish-born Liverpool general practitioner, at a VE-day party. They were married on 9 August 1945 at the Harrogate synagogue (because the rabbi was a distant relative of the bride). Their daughter, Hilary, was born on 2 January 1949 (and in due course also became a successful barrister). Not only was Heilbron the first woman to achieve spectacular success at the bar, she was also a pioneer in combining her career with a happy family life, helped by a live-in nanny and other domestics, as well as her husband, who as a GP could stay at home when she had to travel. She continued to use her maiden name.<br>
<br>Three months after Hilary's birth Rose Heilbron and Helena Normanton became the first women to be appointed king's counsel in England and Wales. Their careers had been very different. Normanton was then aged sixty-six, of twenty-seven years' call, and had had to struggle to build up a practice in the difficult years between the wars. Heilbron was aged only thirty-four (younger than anyone since Thomas Erskine, who took silk in 1783 at the age of thirty-three) and had built up the practice to justify it in only ten years. At that time northern circuit silks were not allowed to live within fifty miles of any assize town on the circuit. Heilbron had to ask permission to go on living in the family home with her husband and baby, a request which was &#145;somewhat grudgingly&#146; granted  (Glidewell, 88).<br>
<br>Once she had taken silk Heilbron's practice really took off and she became one of the most famous and successful defence advocates of the day. In the 1950s the broadsheet newspapers covered sensational trials in great detail and she became a household name. In 1949 she defended George Kelly, accused with George Connolly of shooting the manager and deputy manager of the Cameo Cinema in a bungled robbery. Kelly protested that &#145;I want no Judy defending me&#146;, but later praised her for her prodigious efforts on his behalf  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>). She should have won. The prosecution knew that its case was weak. It depended on the evidence of two people, who were rightly treated as accomplices, but they were corroborated by Robert Graham, who said that he had heard Kelly and Connolly confess in prison. The jury could not agree a verdict. Quite inexplicably a judge ordered that Kelly and Connolly be retried separately. Kelly was tried first, convicted and sentenced to death. Connolly was then persuaded to plead guilty to robbery and sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. After losing his appeal Kelly was hanged on 28 March 1950. But in 2003 both convictions were quashed by the Court of Appeal (<i>Kelly and Connolly v. R</i>, 2003). The prosecution had failed to disclose to the defence that Graham had earlier told the police that another man, Donald Johnson, had confessed to the murder months before, ironically just after Heilbron had successfully defended him on a charge of helping to dispose of the murder weapon.<br>
<br>In 1951 Heilbron defended three Liverpool dockers accused at the Old Bailey of conspiracy to incite an illegal strike. The attorney general, Sir Hartley Shawcross, withdrew the case shortly before it was to go to the jury. Among her other clients were Harold Winstanley, the Knowsley Hall footman found guilty but insane of murdering the butler, after her bold decision to call only a psychiatrist in his defence; Louis Bloom, the Hartlepool solicitor found guilty of manslaughter rather than murder of his mistress in his office; Violet Clark, also known as Vicky Wright, found guilty of manslaughter rather than murder when her twin sons died in a fire on the houseboat <i>Windmill</i>; and Jack &#145;Spot&#146; Comer, acquitted of stabbing in a Soho affray, who called her &#145;the greatest lawyer in history&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>). This, she felt, was &#145;something of an exaggeration&#146;  (Rose, 3).<br>
<br>Heilbron was a good lawyer as well as a good advocate. She continued to feature in the law reports as well as the press reports. Among the cases which she argued as leader were <i>Ormrod v. Crossville Motor Services Ltd</i> (1953), <i>Attorney-General v. Harris</i> (1961), <i>Gore v. Van Der Lann</i> (1967), and <i>S (an Infant) v. Recorder of Manchester</i> (1971). The most important was probably <i>Sweet v. Parsley</i> (1970), where the House of Lords held that <i>mens rea</i> (a guilty mind) was required for every criminal offence created by statute unless parliament had expressly said that it was not. A landlord was not guilty of &#145;being concerned in the management of&#146; premises used for smoking cannabis if she did not know and had no reason to know that cannabis was being smoked there.<br>
<br>By then Heilbron was also established in a judicial career. In 1956 she was appointed recorder of Burnley, a post she held until it was abolished by the <span class="roman">Courts Act</span> 1971, when she became a recorder of the crown court and honorary recorder of Burnley. The first woman to hold salaried judicial office was Sybil Campbell (appointed a metropolitan stipendiary magistrate in 1945), the first woman to preside over a jury trial was Dorothy Dix (as deputy recorder of Deal in 1946), but Heilbron can properly be claimed as the first woman to be appointed judge. In 1957 she also became the first woman commissioner of assize, and in January 1972 the first woman to sit as a judge at the Old Bailey.<br>
<br>Despite (or perhaps because of) her success with juries and the public Heilbron's profession was slow to give her the recognition she had earned. In 1968 she was elected a bencher of Gray's Inn, nineteen years after she had taken silk, and long after her standing at the bar would have merited it. In 1973 she was elected leader of the northern circuit, the first woman to be leader of any circuit; by rights she should have been leader long before. Customarily this honour went to the most senior silk on the circuit, but, as a senior barrister said in 1970, &#145;with a certain amount of care to avoid Rose Heilbron&#146;  (personal knowledge). The northern circuit was in many ways more open and progressive than the London bar, but it was not until 1970 that women were admitted as full members of the bar mess, the dining club of which all male members of the circuit were automatically members. Heilbron always refused to take part in the circuit's &#145;ladies' nights&#146; because they treated women barristers as second-class citizens.<br>
<br>In 1974 Heilbron became the second woman High Court judge. As a criminal and personal injuries practitioner of such repute she might reasonably have expected to be assigned to the Queen's Bench Division. There was a vacancy, but Sir Tasker Watkins was transferred from the Family Division to fill it, while Heilbron took his place in the Family Division. However, from 1979 to 1982 she was presiding judge on the northern circuit, again the first woman to be a presider. While on circuit she tried mostly criminal or civil cases. These included the six-month-long trial at Lancaster in 1981 of an international drug trafficker and his associates for the murder of the &#145;handless corpse&#146; found in a flooded quarry. In 1980 the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> reported that &#145;Heilbron rules her courtroom with a rod of silk&#151;smooth and elegant, but very tough&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>).<br>
<br>Heilbron's expertise as a criminal lawyer was also put to good use in 1975, when she was appointed by the home secretary, Roy Jenkins, to chair the advisory group on the law of rape. This was prompted by the outcry raised after the decision in <i>DPP v. Morgan</i> (1975) that a man was not guilty of rape if he believed that the woman was consenting, no matter how unreasonable that belief might be. In its report  (<span class="italic">Parl. papers</span>, Cmnd 6352 of 1975) the advisory group accepted that principle, but recommended that, among other things, it should be made clear that absence of consent (and not violence) was the crux of the offence; that questions should not be asked about the previous sexual history of the complainant with men other than the accused without leave of the judge; and that complainants should be and remain anonymous.<br>
<br>Heilbron showed a similar sensitivity to the realities of sexual politics in her most famous decisions as a judge in the Family Division. In <span class="italic">Re D (a Minor) (Wardship: Sterilization)</span> (1976) she made an eleven-year-old girl a ward of court at the invitation of an educational psychologist in order to prevent the sterilization which her mother had agreed with her paediatrician and gynaecologist. The child suffered from a rare congenital syndrome but it was common ground that she had sufficient intellectual capacity to marry in due course. Heilbron held that it was neither medically necessary nor in her best interests to perform an operation which would involve &#145;the deprivation of a basic human right, namely the right of a woman to reproduce&#146;. On the other hand in <i>C v. S</i> (1988) she held that the putative father of an unborn child could not prevent the mother having an abortion, either on his own behalf or on behalf of the unborn child; the question was whether the proposed termination would have been a crime and she held that on the particular facts it would not. She was upheld by the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords swiftly refused leave to appeal so that the abortion could be performed before it was too late.<br>
<br>When Heilbron was appointed to the High Court bench her husband had retired from his medical practice. Their daughter was practising at the London bar. So they left their home in the Wirral to live in the flat at 2 Gray's Inn Square which was to be their home for the rest of her life. In 1985 she was elected treasurer (leader for a year) of Gray's Inn, the first woman to be treasurer of any of the four inns of court. It was the final accolade in a life full of firsts. But the recognition which she eventually achieved should not obscure the prejudice and discrimination which delayed it for so long.<br>
<br>Damned with faint and patronizing praise by some of the men, Heilbron was a beacon to all the women who joined the northern circuit in her wake. In 1994 there were six women High Court judges, five of whom (Dame Joyanne Bracewell, Dame Ann Ebsworth, Dame Janet Smith, Dame Heather Steel, and Dame Brenda Hale) were members of the northern circuit (and the sixth, Dame Mary Arden, came from a family of Liverpool lawyers). However slow the circuit had been to acknowledge one of its most successful practitioners, others had been able to follow where she had led.<br>
<br>Heilbron retired from the High Court bench in 1988. On appointment to it in 1974 she had become a DBE. Other honours included being an honorary colonel in the Women's Royal Army Corps (TA); an honorary fellow of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford (1976), where her daughter had been a student, and honorary doctorates from the universities of Liverpool (1975), Warwick (1978), and Manchester (1980). Along with &#145;strength of mind and tenacious industry&#146; she also had &#145;striking good looks&#146;  (Cowper, 182). The portrait by June Mendoza which hangs in Gray's Inn shows a woman of great beauty. She died at Highgate Nursing Home, Hornsey Lane, Islington, after some years there, on 8 December 2005, of pneumonia and cerebrovascular ischaemia. She was survived by her daughter, Hilary, and her husband, Nat, who was still living in Gray's Inn at the age of a hundred.<br>
