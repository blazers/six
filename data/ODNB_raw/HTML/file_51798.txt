<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kelynack,  Theophilus Nicholas <span class="st"> [Theo]</span></span>  (1866&#150;1944), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born at High Street, Wells, Somerset, on 26 June 1866, the son of a Wesleyan minister, Nicholas Kelynack, and his wife, Anne Wesley Dor&eacute;. Educated at University College School, London, he studied medicine at Manchester University, graduating MB ChB with distinction in 1889. Four years later he was awarded the gold medal for his MD thesis on the pathology of the vermiform appendix. He gained the MRCP in 1895. In Manchester he served as house physician, pathologist, and medical registrar at the Manchester Royal Infirmary, as well as demonstrator and assistant lecturer in pathology and assistant to the professor of pathology and medicine at the university. It was here that he launched his writing career with a book on renal growths in 1898 and the <span class="italic">Pathologist's Handbook</span> in 1899.<br>
<br>After returning to London, Kelynack was appointed honorary visiting physician to the Mount Vernon Hospital for Consumption and Diseases of the Chest. His active association lasted for many years, latterly as a governor. Through his work at Mount Vernon he became an acknowledged expert on tuberculosis. Kelynack was particularly interested in the welfare of children, and he became honorary medical adviser to the Shaftesbury Society (for socially handicapped children), the Ragged School Union, the National Association for the Feeble Minded, and the National Children's Home. He was also honorary visiting physician to the home's sanatorium at Harpenden, Hertfordshire, and the Infant Hospital, Westminster. On 27 April 1904 Kelynack married Clara Violet McLaren MB ChB (1875/6&#150;1940), daughter of James Grieve McLaren, tea broker. She later became medical secretary of the Medical Women's Federation and also assisted Kelynack in his editorial work. They had a daughter.<br>
<br>Kelynack's major contribution to medicine came through skilled editorship and an ability to collate current research and other useful information and make it publicly accessible. He edited the <span class="italic">British Journal of Tuberculosis</span> (1907&#150;34), the <span class="italic">British Journal of Inebriety</span> (1903&#150;41), and <span class="italic">The Child</span> (1910&#150;27). In 1907 he edited <span class="italic">The Drink Problem of To-Day in its Medico-Sociological Aspects</span>; this went into a second edition in 1916 and became a classic on the subject. Among his edited volumes was <span class="italic">Medical Examination of Schools and Scholars</span> (1910), a guide for school medical officers, educationists, and others involved in child welfare. From 1910 to 1914 he edited four <span class="italic">National Health Manuals</span>. Covering infancy, childhood, school life, and youth, these presented social workers with governing principles in simple non-technical words. He did the same for those involved in tuberculosis work with his <span class="italic">Tuberculosis Year Book and Sanatoria Annual</span> (1913). This comprised papers on current medical research and a guide to treatment centres and preventive organizations. <span class="italic">The Yearbook of Open Air Schools and Children's Sanatoria</span> followed in 1914. In the same year he edited <span class="italic">Human Derelicts</span>, a collection of medico-sociological studies for teachers of religion and social workers.<br>
<br>Kelynack's own contributions to his edited volumes were based on a thorough knowledge of the subject area, and always included extensive bibliographies. Not only was he widely read but he also made a point of visiting relevant centres before writing about them. He was especially interested in the social aspects of disease, and he possessed, as his obituary in the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span> noted, a deep feeling of social responsibility. This was complemented by his warm, friendly, and sympathetic personality. While he believed that poverty was a predisposing factor in tuberculosis, he did not press for social or political reform.<br>
<br>Kelynack was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine, a member of council of the Royal Institute of Public Health and Hygiene, and he was for a number of years secretary of the institute. For many years he was honorary secretary to the Society for the Study of Inebriety, and was appointed vice-president in 1941. As justice of the peace for the county of London from 1919 he carried out his duties with the thoroughness for which he was renowned. Kelynack died at his home, 9 Arden Grove, Harpenden, Hertfordshire, on 23 December 1944. He was survived by his daughter, Agnes, who was assistant secretary to the British Medical Association at the time of her father's death.<br>
