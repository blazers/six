<span class="headword">O'Connor,  Luke Smythe</span>  (1806&#150;1873), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born in Dublin on 15 April 1806, was appointed ensign in the 1st West India regiment on 27 April 1827, becoming lieutenant on 22 March 1831, captain on 17 January 1834, brevet major on 9 November 1846, major on 1 January 1847, brevet lieutenant-colonel on 3 February 1853, brevet colonel on 28 November 1854, regimental lieutenant-colonel on 21 September 1855, and major-general on 24 April 1866. All his regimental commissions were in the 1st West India, of which he was adjutant in 1833&#150;4. When it was decided, in 1843, that the garrisons on the African west coast should be supplied by the West India regiments instead of by the 3rd West India alone, as previously, O'Connor was detached from Barbados to Sierra Leone with two companies of his regiment. In 1848, as major, O'Connor was sent from his regiment in Jamaica to British Honduras, where there were disturbances with the Yucatan.<br>
<br>In September 1852 O'Connor was appointed governor of the Gambia, and was invested with the command of all the troops in west Africa. On his advice the headquarters were removed from Sierra Leone to Cape Coast Castle. He commanded detachments of the three West India regiments, black pensioners, Gambia militia, and seamen and marines against the Muslim rebels of Combos, stormed their stronghold of Sabajee on 1 June 1853, and acquired by treaty a considerable tract of territory, for which he received official praise from the government. On 16 July 1853 he attacked and repulsed a numerous force of Muslims under Omar Hadjee, the &#145;Black Prophet&#146;, during which action, out of 240 British, 29 were killed and 53 wounded. O'Connor was wounded with two shots through the right arm and one in the left shoulder, but remained in action. He subsequently commanded the combined British and French forces against the Muslim rebels of Upper and Lower Combos. After four hours' fighting in the pass of Boccow Kooka on 4 August 1855, he stormed the rebel stockade and routed the enemy, who lost some 500 men. He received the reward for distinguished service in 1855 and the CB on 4 February 1856.<br>
<br>O'Connor was brigadier-general commanding the troops in Jamaica during the 1865 rebellion, and was thanked for his prompt and efficient measures by Governor Eyre, the legislative council and house of assembly, and by the magistrate and inhabitants of Kingston. He was president of the legislative council and senior member of the privy council of Jamaica in January 1867; he administered the government during the absence of Sir John Peter Grant and retired shortly afterwards.<br>
<br>O'Connor married Anne Mitchell in 1856; she survived him. He died of dropsy and atrophy at 7 R&auml;cknitzstrasse, Dresden, Saxony, on 24 March 1873.<br>
