<span class="headword">Bevan,  William Latham</span>  (1821&#150;1908), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, born on 1 May 1821 at Beaufort, Brecknockshire, was eldest of three sons of William Hibbs Bevan (1788&#150;1846), then of Beaufort, but later of Glannant, Crickhowell, high sheriff for Brecknockshire in 1841, and Margaret, daughter of Joseph Latham, also of Beaufort, but originally from Broughton in Furness. With a stepbrother, Edward Kendall, his father ran the Beaufort ironworks, trading as Kendall and Bevan, until 1833.<br>
<br>Educated at Rugby School under Thomas Arnold, Bevan matriculated from Balliol College, Oxford, on 14 December 1838; but he immediately moved to Magdalen Hall on being elected Lusby scholar there. He graduated BA in 1842, with a second class in the final classical school, and MA in 1845. In 1844 he was ordained deacon, and in 1845, after a short curacy at Stepney, he was ordained priest and presented to the living of Hay, Brecknockshire, by Sir Joseph Bailey, who was married to his aunt. This living, though a poor one without a parsonage, he held for fifty-six years. He lived in no little style at Hay Castle, leased from Sir Joseph Bailey, later Lord Glanusk, who had bought the property in 1844. Francis Kilvert, the diarist, was a frequent visitor there. His private means enabled him to contribute largely to the restoration of the church, in 1866, and the erection of a town clock and tower, besides building a parish hall at his own expense in 1890. He was also prebendary of Llanddewi Aber-arth in St David's Cathedral (1876&#150;9); canon residentiary of St David's (1879&#150;93); archdeacon of Brecon from 1895 until 1907; proctor for the diocese of St David's (1880&#150;95); examining chaplain to the bishop (1881&#150;97); and chaplain of Hay Union (1850&#150;95). Bevan married on 19 June 1849, at Whitney church, Herefordshire, Louisa (1829&#150;1909), fourth daughter of Tomkyns Dew of Whitney Court; they had three sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>Bevan was known in his day for a number of pamphlets written in defence of the Church in Wales during the controversy over disestablishment. A contributor to William Smith's <span class="italic">Dictionary of the Bible</span>, he also wrote some manuals on ancient geography. A competent historian, he is now remembered for his brief history of the diocese of St David's in the SPCK series of diocesan histories (1888).<br>
<br>In November 1901 Bevan retired from Hay to Ely Tower, Brecon. The house was so named because, built on ground which once was the bailey of Brecon Castle, there is in the garden the ruin of a tower where a bishop of Ely, John Morton, was imprisoned in the fifteenth century. Bevan died there on 24 August 1908, and was buried on 1 September at Hay, where his widow, who died on 23 October 1909, was also buried. He is commemorated in Hay church by carved oak choir stalls and a marble chancel pavement, given by his family in August 1910. The St David's diocesan conference in 1908 resolved on founding a diocesan memorial to him. The Archdeacon Bevan Trust, now administered in the diocese of Swansea and Brecon, is designed to encourage historical research.<br>

<a name="cosubject_56828"></a><span class="headword">Edward Latham Bevan</span>  (1861&#150;1934), <span class="occ">Church in Wales clergyman</span>, the youngest son, the Teddy Bevan of Kilvert's diary, was born at Weymouth, where the family had property, on 27 October 1861. Educated privately, he entered Hertford College, Oxford in 1881 and graduated BA in 1884. Ordained to a title to Holy Trinity, Weymouth, 1886&#150;91, he then became chaplain of the Gordon Boys' Home, Worthing (1891&#150;6); then vicar of Brecon from 1897. He succeeded his father as archdeacon of Brecon in 1907 and was appointed suffragan bishop of Swansea in 1915. He became the first bishop of the diocese of Swansea and Brecon, created in 1923. He was then the national chairman of the Church of England Men's Society. His benefactions to the new cathedral, formerly the priory church, were considerable and the family home, Ely Tower, became the residence of his successors. He died unmarried on 2 February 1934 at Ely Tower, Brecon, and was buried on 8 February in Brecon Cathedral grounds.<br>
