<span class="headword">Waddington,  George</span>  (1793&#150;1869), <span class="occ">traveller and church historian</span>, son of George Waddington (<i>bap</i>. 1753, <i>d</i>. 1824), vicar of Tuxford, Nottinghamshire, and his wife, Anne, youngest daughter of Peter Dollond [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49855/', "Dollond family")</script>], optician, was born at Tuxford on 7 September 1793. He had a younger brother and two younger sisters. His paternal grandfather was Joshua Waddington (1710&#150;1780), also a clergyman, and the family was long established in the Halifax area. Waddington was educated at Gainsborough School, at Charterhouse from 1808 to 1811, and then at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1811 and was admitted scholar in 1812. His career at the university was distinguished. He was Browne medallist in 1811 and 1814, Davies's university scholar in 1813, and chancellor's English medallist in 1813. He graduated BA in 1815, being senior optime in the mathematical tripos and the first chancellor's medallist, and in 1816 he was member's prizeman. He was admitted minor fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1817, and major fellow in 1818; he proceeded MA in 1818.<br>
<br>Waddington turned to travel in the east and in 1822, in conjunction with the Revd Barnard Hanbury, published <span class="italic">Journal of a Visit to some Parts of Ethiopia</span> describing a journey from Wadi Halfa to Merawe and back and illustrated by Waddington. This included some entertaining adventures on a journey which took them further up the Nile than Burckhardt had reached and resulted in the publication of some useful maps and the presentation of some valuable artefacts to the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. Waddington's <span class="italic">Visit to Greece in 1823 and 1824</span> (1825) passed into a second edition in the same year after having been well reviewed. In 1829 he published <span class="italic">The present condition and prospects of the Greek or oriental church, with some letters written from the convent of the Strophades</span>. The letters were addressed to &#145;T.&#146;, probably Connop Thirlwall, his contemporary at school and at college.<br>
<br>About 1826 Waddington was ordained. His college presented him to the perpetual curacy of St Mary the Great, Cambridge, on 1 February 1833, and to the vicarage of Masham and Kirkby Malzeard in Yorkshire on 17 June 1834. On 1 October 1834 he was appointed commissary and official of the prebend of Masham and did valuable work in the parish, improving secular and Sunday schools, founding a library, and commuting tithes. From 1833 to 1841 he was prebendary of Chichester Cathedral. He was installed dean of Durham on 25 September 1840, graduating DD from Durham in that year. His attentions to the cathedral fabric were intended to encourage people into the church, although some were later regretted. An ardent Liberal, he was active in local politics. Although he opposed the appointment of outsiders to examine the state of Durham University, he was ready to give money for the improvement of teaching there, became warden of the university in 1862, and oversaw several important reforms.<br>
<br>Waddington died, unmarried and widely mourned, at Durham on 20 July 1869, and on 23 July was buried on the north side of the cathedral yard. He was a rich man, his will being proved at &#145;under &pound;60,000&#146;, and was a generous subscriber to charities and individuals. He left the cathedral library a small but good collection of Greek vases. In 1870, in memory of him and his brother Horatio (1799&#150;1867), his sisters Anne and Clara founded the Waddington classical scholarship at Cambridge. His best-known works were those on ecclesiastical history, especially <span class="italic">History of the Church from the Earliest Ages to the Reformation</span> (2 vols., 1833) and <span class="italic">History of the Reformation on the Continent</span> (3 vols., 1841). Each got mixed reviews, as was unsurprising in such wide-ranging texts.<br>
<br>A founder member of the Athenaeum in 1824, Waddington &#145;could never have been fairly charged with any tendency to asceticism, but rather the reverse&#146;  (Klottrup, 3). His dinners were abundant and convivial and he enjoyed asking Puseyite undergraduates to dine on Ash Wednesday. He was a keen advocate of education for children and adults and gave generously to support local schools. Jovial and well intentioned, he was long remembered in Durham with affection.<br>
