<span class="headword">Phipps <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Duncan]</span>, Dame  Jessie Percy Butler  Wilton</span>  (1855&#150;1934), <span class="occ">educational administrator</span>, was born on 9 February 1855 at 1 Fifth Avenue, New York, USA, the eldest child of William Butler Duncan and his wife, Jane Sargent. Her early years were spent in America where, on 9 November 1876, she married William Wilton Phipps (1847&#150;1911), a company director of London and New York, second son of Charles Paul Phipps (1815&#150;1880) of Chalcot and Dilton Court, Wiltshire, MP for Westbury from 1869 to 1874, and his wife, Emma Mary, daughter of Moses Benson of Liverpool. In 1880 William and Jessie Wilton Phipps moved to England, and in 1881 set up home at 3 Culford Gardens, Chelsea, with their family of two sons and two daughters. Jessie Phipps was regarded as both beautiful and charming, and a portrait of her as a young woman by John Singer Sargent, to whom she was related through her mother, was exhibited by him at Burlington House in January 1926.<br>
<br>A friendship with Maude Lawrence led to Jessie Phipps becoming manager of a group of public elementary schools in Chelsea and also of &#145;special schools&#146; under the London school board. In 1907 she was co-opted on the education committee of the London county council (LCC). In 1909 she became the first woman to chair a subcommittee&#151;the special schools subcommittee. After her husband's death in 1911 she was elected, as a tory, an alderman of London (13 March 1913). In 1920 she was appointed a justice of the peace for the City. On 16 March 1920 she was unanimously elected vice-chair of the LCC, the first woman to hold the office. On retirement from the office in 1921 she became an additional member of the public health committee. On 14 March 1923 she was elected the first female chair of the education committee, a position she held until 1926. She was also chair of several important subcommittees and represented the LCC on various external bodies. An excellent chair and able administrator, her good sense and sound judgement made for happy relations with both colleagues and opponents on the council. She was appointed DBE on 5 June 1926. From 1926 to 1931 she was chair of the Central Council for the London Blind.<br>
<br>From her first arrival in London Jessie Phipps was a well-known society hostess. She was said to possess a simplicity and straightforwardness of character. Accustomed to do the thing before her as soon as she understood it, she made up her mind quickly, and was impatient of long discussions. Work for the LCC absorbed much of her natural energy; the failure of her eyesight in 1931 eventually compelled her to give up her public activities.<br>
<br>Dame Jessie Phipps died from heart failure on 7 August 1934 at her cottage, the Two Gables, on Chorleywood Common, Hertfordshire. The flower garden which she made at Chorleywood was her main interest outside her public life. She was buried on 9 August at Chorleywood; the mourners included the chairman of the LCC education committee and the clerk to the council. She was survived by her sons, Paul Phipps (1880&#150;1953), an architect, and William Duncan Phipps (1882&#150;1967), captain RN and gentleman usher to George VI and Elizabeth II from 1937 to 1964, and by her eldest daughter Margaret Percy Phipps (<i>d</i>. 1944), who had in 1906 married Sir Edmund Bampfylde Phipps, a civil servant in the Board of Education. Margaret Phipps was mayor of Chelsea from 1929 to 1931. Jessie Phipps's younger daughter, Rachel Mary Hele, who married in 1912 the diplomat Miles Wedderburn Lampson, first Baron Killearn, predeceased her in 1930.<br>
