<span class="headword">Finet <span class="st"> [Finett]</span>, Sir  John</span>  (1570/71&#150;1641), <span class="occ">courtier and writer</span>, was born at Soulton in Kent, the eldest son of Robert Finet (<i>d</i>. 1582), and Agnes Wenlock, daughter of a captain of Calais. His early life is obscure. Whatever his standing, he mixed with the leading Kentish gentry of his day. The Dacres were &#145;that noble family to whose love I owe so much service&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 17.322), while to Henry Wotton, Finet was &#145;mine honest countryman and friend&#146;  (Smith, 1.444). In the dedication to his 1606 translation of Ren&eacute; de Lucinge's <span class="italic">De la naissance, dur&eacute;e, et cheute des estats</span>, Finet indicates that he had enjoyed the favour of Archbishop Whitgift. In 1588 he matriculated a fellow-commoner from St John's College, Cambridge, and in 1595 he was granted a licence to travel overseas. He seems to have spent the next few years doing so.<br>
<br>By his early thirties, Finet was undertaking general duties for Thomas Wilson, the earl of Salisbury's principal secretary. On the continent in 1607, he attached himself to the English diplomats in Paris and followed the court. These connections, his recent book, his languages, and travel experience, prompted Finet's appointment as tutor and guardian to Salisbury's son and heir, Lord Cranborne, who toured France from December 1608. Finet's colleague was the physician Lister, but he himself was at this time, according to John Chamberlain, &#145;a travayler of no note or account&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 1.268). Henri IV's assassination in May 1610 precipitated an early return to England, but Cranborne and his tutors made an Italian journey a few months later, mainly in Venice, hosted by Wotton.<br>
<br>Back in England, Finet continued as one of Salisbury's secretaries, attending the treasurer in his last days and remaining in the service of the new earl. In October 1612 he was appointed to assist Sir Lewes Lewknor, master of the ceremonies, the office responsible for the reception and entertainment of diplomats and other foreign dignitaries. Finet's account of the prince palatine's visit that month began a continuous record of protocol and precedent that he would maintain until six weeks before his death. He moved now to Salisbury's St Martin's Lane development, his principal home for the rest of his life. Long-term neighbours included Sir Theodore de Mayerne and close friends Sir Thomas Roe, Sir Benjamin Rudyard, and Sir William Ashton. With few ceremonial duties, he filled various functions. He accompanied Prince Charles to Cambridge in 1613 (receiving an MA) and attended the king there in 1615. Often abroad, he presented gifts to Felipe III at the Escorial in 1614 and accompanied Lady Harrington to visit Elizabeth of Bohemia at Heidelberg in 1617 and to Dunkirk in 1619.<br>
<br>James knighted Finet on 23 March 1616 &#145;to make me fytter for his service&#146;, as Finet told Trumbull  (<span class="italic">Downshire MSS</span>, 5.453), or else &#145;upon pretence he shold have a widow that must needes be a lady&#146;, as Chamberlain told Carlton  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 1.618). Two days before Christmas 1617, Finet married Jane Wentworth (<i>d</i>. 1652), a &#145;lame&#146; daughter of Lord Wentworth and related to his early patrons the Dacres  (ibid., 2.126). Her brother Thomas was created earl of Cleveland in 1625, her stepfather, William Pope, earl of Downe in 1628.<br>
<br>Finet seems to have become a fixture at court, known for writing and singing bawdy songs with Zouche and Goring. One such performance just days after his marriage was so exceptionally offensive that even James was displeased. No examples of its kind are preserved, but Finet's wit and polish stand out in his surviving work. Thriving at court, he incurred Lewknor's jealousy, who felt Finet was encroaching on his job. On 13 September 1619 he was granted the reversion to Lewknor's office. Later that year he attended Lord Treasurer Suffolk's trial for corruption and reported it in detail to Salisbury, providing an important historical source. In 1622 he was present at a confirmation service and dinner held by the bishop of London for Buckingham's family. The following year Buckingham presented him with a three-carat diamond ring in Spain, when he was among those who fetched back the prince and the duke, following the failed Spanish match. Lewknor's death on 12 March 1627 saw Finet become master of the ceremonies. Now there would be no more travel abroad, as he spent his time either following the court or at one of his houses in Westminster and Chiswick. Besides the ridiculous punctilios that every master sometimes had to cope with, he met the additional challenge of an impoverished court, and claimed to have saved the king over &pound;10,000 through proper regulation during his mastership.<br>
<br>Sensing his age, Finet began putting his affairs in order in 1638, when he sold lands in Lincolnshire to establish a trust for his son William. He continued working until May 1641, when he had his notebooks copied and wrote his will, and died on 12 July with his family around him at home in St Martin's Lane. He was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields. His executors and the overseers of his will, Roe and Rudyard, supervised major bequests to Lady Finet and the children of the marriage, Lucy, Elizabeth, William, Anne, Finetta, and Jane, besides generous gifts to other family and friends. Following his widow's death in 1652, a portion of Finet's notebooks was edited and published by James Howell as <span class="italic">Finetti philoxenis: Some Choice Observations of Sir John Finet Knight</span> (1656), which became a major source for Wicquefort and others. Only in 1987 was the bulk of the remainder published, edited by Albert Loomie. Although at least three portraits of Finet once existed, only two copies of one of them are known to survive. These show a handsome Finet in Venice, at the time of Cranborne's tour. The original may have been painted by Domenico Tintoretto, since the two corresponded shortly afterwards.<br>
