<span class="headword">Medbourne,  Matthew</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1637?, <em>d.</em> 1680), <span class="occ">actor and playwright</span>, may have been the Mathew Medburne, son of George Medburne, who was baptized at St Margaret's, Westminster, London, on 17 June 1637. He performed with the Duke's Company, London, from 1661, and is the author or translator of at least one play. His earliest documented appearance on stage was as Delio in John Webster's <span class="italic">The Duchess of Malfi</span> on 30 September 1662, though he was active in the company before that date. Medbourne played many secondary roles for the Duke's Company throughout his career: Lennox in <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>, the Ghost in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, Morat in Elkanah Settle's <span class="italic">Ibrahim the Illustrious Bassa</span>, and Don Pedro in Aphra Behn's <span class="italic">The Rover</span>. He played the count of Blamount in Roger Boyle's <span class="italic">History of Henry V</span>, and John Downes notes that Medbourne played Clermont, though no role by that name appears in the play.<br>
<br>Medbourne may have been the author of <span class="italic">Saint Cecily, or, The Converted Twins</span>, which was licensed on 11 June 1666, during the time when the theatres were closed because of the plague. The play's title-page assigns authorship to &#145;E. M.&#146;, but Medbourne's name appears at the end of the dedication. Lori Sonderegger makes a convincing case for attributing the play to him. Medbourne's other known literary effort was a translation of Moli&egrave;re's play entitled by Medbourne as <span class="italic">Tartuffe, or, The French Puritan</span>. Judith Milhous and Robert D. Hume date this play as being performed in autumn or winter 1669&#150;70  (Milhous and Hume, &#145;Dating play premieres&#146;). Gerard Langbaine repeats the author's claim that it &#145;was receiv'd with universal Applause on our English Stage&#146;  (Langbaine, 367), but we have record of only one performance. An epilogue by Charles Sackville, earl of Dorset, from March 1670, credits Medbourne with ten plays, but only the two mentioned survive. His engagements with the Duke's Company are fairly steady throughout his career, though after the reopening of the theatres in autumn 1666 he is not listed in the company roster until 1668. He seems to have worked for the rival King's Company in the season 1669&#150;70, since he appears to have spoken the epilogue to <span class="italic">Tartuffe</span>, which was performed at the King's Bridges Street Theatre. He appears to have returned to the Duke's Company for the 1670&#150;71 season.<br>
<br>Medbourne's career was marred, however, by legal and political difficulties. On 18 July 1662 he was fined 3<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. for assaulting a messenger from the office of the revels on 4 July. The bill states that he and eleven others, &#145;all twelve late of St. Clement's Danes' &hellip; with divers unknown disturbers of the peace, riotously assembled together and assaulted Edward Thomas, gentleman, and beat and maltreated him, and held him their prisoner for the space of two hours&#146;  (Jeaffreson). On 9 December 1669 an arrest warrant was issued for Medbourne and his fellow actor Samuel Sandford for &#145;refractory &amp; disorderly&#146; conduct  (Milhous and Hume, <span class="italic">Register</span>, vol. 1, p. 110). Medbourne's greatest trials were ahead. In November 1678 he played Agamemnon at Dorset Garden Theatre in John Banks's <span class="italic">The Destruction of Troy</span>. This was his last known stage role, for he was arrested, charged with high treason, and sent to Newgate prison on 26 November. As a Roman Catholic and an acquaintance of Titus Oates from at least 1676, he became swept up in the Popish Plot. A man named Phillips &#145;in Black Friars at the Wonder Tavern&#146; swore on 3 February 1679 that &#145;Medbourne's wife, in the presence of another woman, offered in her husband's name to make him a man forever, if he could invalidate Oates' testimony&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>). On 7 February Phillips maintained that &#145;a certain woman brought to him by Mrs. Medbourne offered him money to swear that Oates offered him money to bring witnesses against Medburne&#146;  (ibid.). Medbourne remained in Newgate until his death on 19 March 1680. In May 1679 he made out his will to &#145;give all that I have unto my wife&#146;, Catherine. Langbaine wrote that Medbourne was &#145;One, whose good parts deserv'd a better fate than to die in prison, as he did in the time of the late <i>Popish-Plot</i>; thro' a too forward and indiscreet Zeal for a mistaken Religion&#146;  (Langbaine, 366).<br>
