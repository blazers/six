</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Blake,  William</span>  (1757&#150;1827), <span class="occ">engraver, artist, and poet</span>, was born on 28 November 1757 at 28 Broad Street, Soho, London, the third son of James Blake (1723?&#150;1784), a hosier, and his wife, Catherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wright (1723&#150;1792), the widow of Thomas Armitage. Blake had four brothers, James (1753&#150;1827), John (<i>b</i>. 1755, <i>d</i>. before 1760), Robert (1762?&#150;1787), and John (1760&#150;1800?), and one sister, Catherine (1764&#150;1841). Records at St James's, Piccadilly, note the baptism of a Richard Blake in 1762, but this may be an error for Robert. Only James, who continued the family business, and Catherine played roles in Blake's adult life. The younger John was apprenticed to a baker but ran away to &#145;enlist as a Soldier &amp; died&#146;  (Tatham in Bentley, <span class="italic">Records</span>, 509). William Blake was baptized on 11 December 1757 in St James's Church, Piccadilly. Blake was born into the class of London shopkeepers and artisans known for its hard work in pursuit of financial security and a tendency toward independent opinions in religion and politics. His mother had been a member of the Moravian church while married to Armitage. She left that sect shortly before marrying James Blake on 15 October 1752, but their children's early education may have been shaped by Moravian concepts and customs.<h2>
<a name="Childhoodeducationandapprenticeship17571779"></a>Childhood, education, and apprenticeship, 1757&#150;1779</h2>Little is known about the outer circumstances of Blake's childhood, but the special character of his inner life made itself apparent at an early age. When walking on Peckham Rye, aged &#145;eight or ten perhaps&#146;, he beheld &#145;a tree filled with angels&#146;  (Gilchrist, 1.7). On another occasion &#145;his mother beat him for running in &amp; saying that he saw the Prophet Ezekiel under a Tree in the Fields&#146;  (Tatham in Bentley, <span class="italic">Records</span>, 519). At about this same time, Blake showed an interest in the pictorial arts. While still a youth, he began sketching and attending auctions to acquire old and then unfashionable prints after artists such as Raphael, Michelangelo, and D&uuml;rer. The intertwining of extrasensory perception and artistic expression continued throughout Blake's life and is integral to his concepts of mind, art, and religion.<br>
<br>Blake's father disapproved of his son's reports about angels in trees, but he was supportive of William's ambitions in the arts, buying for his young connoisseur casts of antique sculpture for copying with pencil or pen. When ten years old Blake began to attend a drawing school directed by Henry Pars&#151;apparently his first contact with formal education. His character and interests indicated that Blake would become an artist; his family's finances would dictate the first step toward such a career.<br>
<br>At the age of fourteen it was time for Blake to begin an apprenticeship. A &#145;painter of Eminence&#146;  (Tatham in Bentley, <span class="italic">Records</span>, 510)&#151;or, according to Gilchrist, the fashionable engraver William Ryland  (1.13)&#151;was first considered as a master, but the fee was too high for the family purse. The Blakes settled instead on James Basire, an old-fashioned line and stipple printmaker who practised the &#145;mixed method&#146; of preliminary etching followed by engraving. William was apprenticed to Basire on 4 August 1772 for a bond of 50 guineas. Blake probably lived for the traditional period of seven years with his master at 31 Great Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields.<br>
<br>Blake learned from Basire the profession he would practise throughout his life. Gaining the necessary skills involved a good deal of drudgery preparing copperplates and replicating the abstract linear patterns of Basire's graphic technique. Blake mastered his craft quickly&#151;given the 1773 date he later inscribed on &#145;Joseph of Arimathea among the Rocks of Albion&#146;, a plate based on a figure by Michelangelo. The print's competent conventionality gives no hint of Blake's later graphic innovations.<br>
<br>In addition to providing professional instruction, Blake's master introduced him to the intellectual life of London. Basire was engraver to the Royal Society and the Society of Antiquaries, and Blake assisted in the execution of many plates for them. He probably also worked on engravings for Jacob Bryant's <span class="italic">A New System, or, An Analysis of Ancient Mythology</span> (1774&#150;6), which influenced Blake's later excursions into syncretic myth-making. From these projects, and possibly from authors and publishers who visited Basire's shop, Blake learned about the natural sciences, philology, and archaeology.<br>
<br>Beginning in 1774, Basire sent Blake to Westminster Abbey to make drawings of its medieval monuments and wall paintings for later engraving. This assignment, which probably lasted on and off for three years, may have been prompted by a desire to separate Blake from fellow apprentices and thereby end a quarrel with them  (Malkin in Bentley, <span class="italic">Records</span>, 422). Blake's earliest known drawings record the opening of the coffin of Edward I on 2 May 1774. Later efforts are careful copies of the effigies and tombs of monarchs; many were subsequently engraved in Basire's shop (some probably by Blake) as book illustrations. The sculpture filling the abbey &#145;appeared as miracles of art, to his Gothicised imagination&#146;  (ibid., 423) and shaped Blake's lifelong interest in early British history and medieval art.<h2>
<a name="Acareerinthearts17791787"></a>A career in the arts, 1779&#150;1787</h2>At the end of his apprenticeship in August 1779, Blake began his career as a journeyman copy engraver. He was hired by the print-publisher Thomas Macklin to execute stipple engravings after Watteau and by several booksellers, including the liberal publisher Joseph Johnson, to engrave illustrations. Many of these were based on designs by Thomas Stothard, a friend of Blake's from at least 1780 and an artist just beginning a career as Britain's most prolific book illustrator. Blake became part of a circle of engravers regularly employed to reproduce Stothard's designs.<br>
<br>Blake's efforts as a commercial engraver in the 1780s are what one would expect for a young man trained in that craft. His ambitions in the arts, however, extended beyond what copy engraving could satisfy&#151;or was expected of engravers. He began training as an original artist by enrolling, probably in July 1779, as a student in the Royal Academy of Arts. After a three-month probation, Blake was granted permission to study works in the academy's collections, featuring casts of classical sculpture, for six years. Among his first compositions was a series of watercolours illustrating the history of England from the legendary arrival of Brutus to the reign of Edward IV. Blake exhibited one design, <span class="italic">The Death of Earl Goodwin</span>, at the Royal Academy in 1780. Many other drawings based on historical, literary, and biblical subjects followed, with two on the consequences of warfare in the academy's 1784 exhibition and four on the story of Joseph in 1785. These works exhibit the strong outlines and frieze-like arrangement of figures typical of the then dominant neoclassical style, but with an attempt at monumentality influenced by Michelangelo, Raphael, and Blake's contemporary James Barry. Blake was aiming at a career in &#145;history&#146; painting, then considered the highest genre of pictorial expression.<br>
<br>Blake's circle of friends was growing. In addition to Stothard, Blake became acquainted in the early 1780s with the sculptor John Flaxman, the connoisseur John Hawkins, the artist (and later biographer) John Thomas Smith, and George Cumberland, an amateur artist and collector of early Italian prints. In 1784 Hawkins tried, but failed, to raise funds to send Blake to Italy. Stothard, Flaxman, and Cumberland would play significant roles in Blake's later life. The arts provided a common interest for these young men and prompted activities such as sketching tours. One such, on the River Medway late in the summer of 1780, proved memorable. Stothard, Blake, and another friend strayed too close to the naval base near Upnor Castle and the trio was briefly detained as suspected spies. This may not have been the first time Blake was caught up in political events. A few months earlier, London had been swept by the anti-Catholic Gordon riots. According to Gilchrist  (1.35), Blake &#145;encountered the advancing wave&#146; of the mob and &#145;was forced &hellip; to go along in the very front rank, and witness the storm and burning&#146; of Newgate prison.<br>
<br>Blake's social life in the early 1780s included romantic interests. His first proposal of marriage was rejected. He told his broken-hearted tale to Catherine Sophia Boucher (1762&#150;1831) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64608/', "Blake, Catherine Sophia")</script>], the daughter of a market gardener, and a bond of affection soon developed  (Tatham in Bentley, <span class="italic">Records</span>, 517&#150;18). About a year after first meeting, they were married on 18 August 1782 in the church of St Mary, Battersea. Catherine may have been illiterate, or at least embarrassed by her penmanship, for she signed the register with an X. Blake probably lived in his father's house until his marriage; soon after, the couple took lodgings at 23 Green Street, near Leicester Square. Little is known about Catherine Blake, but she managed the family purse and, in later years, would place an empty plate before her husband at mealtime to remind him of monetary necessities  (Gilchrist, 1.313). She was the most important person in Blake's adult life, a constant companion, helpmate, and faithful believer in his genius. The couple had no children.<br>
<br>From the age of twelve Blake had been testing his powers as a poet. Some of these efforts were privately published as <span class="italic">Poetical Sketches</span> (1783). The collection shows an indebtedness to eighteenth-century verse, but also an uneasiness with its conventions and a desire to reach back to earlier models&#151;Shakespeare, Spenser, and the supposedly ancient works of Ossian&#151;to revivify present sensibilities. The cost of producing the volume was borne by Harriet Mathew, her clergyman husband, and Flaxman, who had introduced Blake into the Mathew home, one &#145;frequented by most of the literary and talented people of the day&#146;  (Smith in Bentley, <span class="italic">Records</span>, 456). The group included Thomas Taylor &#145;the Platonist&#146;, who apparently instructed Blake in mathematics  (Bentley, <span class="italic">Records Supplement</span>, 94&#150;5). Blake had impressed these worthies by reciting and singing his compositions, but by 1784 he became uncomfortable with their pretentious conversations. His criticism found expression in <span class="italic">An Island in the Moon</span> (<i>c</i>.1784&#150;5), a fragmentary manuscript that playfully satirizes contemporary speculations in the arts and sciences.<br>
<br>It may have been a small inheritance from his father, who died in July 1784, that helped Blake begin a print-publishing partnership with another former Basire apprentice, James Parker. The two families moved to 27 Broad Street, next door to the Blake family home. Blake probably acquired his engraver's rolling press at this time. Only two prints bear the partnership's imprint and the business may have ceased when the Blakes moved to 28 Poland Street, Soho, late in 1785. Blake's first attempt at artistic and financial independence had not prospered.<h2>
<a name="Graphicinventions17871789"></a>Graphic inventions, 1787&#150;1789</h2>Blake was exceptionally close to his youngest brother, Robert, who was also set on a career in the arts and was perhaps a lodger with the Blakes. When a quarrel developed between brother and wife, Blake made Catherine apologize humbly to Robert  (Gilchrist, 1.58&#150;9). The youth fell ill in the winter of 1786&#150;7 and died in early February. In his exhaustion after the &#145;last fortnight&#146; of Robert's life, having tended him &#145;day and night by his bedside&#146;, Blake fell into &#145;an unbroken sleep of three days' and nights' duration&#146;  (ibid., 1.59). But his brother's spirit remained alive for Blake and grief turned to inspiration in the following year. &#145;Robert stood before him in one of his visionary imaginations, and so decidedly directed him&#146; in how to publish his works without &#145;the expense of letter-press&#146;  (Smith in Bentley, <span class="italic">Records</span>, 460). Whatever its other-worldly origins, Blake's invention of relief etching also developed from his craft as an engraver. His new method was more direct, faster, and required less technical expertise than intaglio printmaking. It permitted Blake the artist to paint his images directly on a copperplate in acid-resistant varnish; Blake the poet could write his words in the same medium. The text must be executed in reverse, so that impressions would print right-way around, but this was only a slight impediment for a trained engraver. After the uncovered areas of the metal were etched away, the images stood in relief and could be inked quickly on, and printed with low pressure from, the surface. The process embodied a unity between conception and execution&#151;a practice that became a principle of Blake's later aesthetic doctrines&#151;rather than the divisions between invention and production embedded in eighteenth-century print technology and its class distinctions among authors and printers, artists and engravers.<br>
<br>Blake's first relief etching, one that includes the related technique of white-line etching, may have been <span class="italic">The Approach of Doom</span>, a print based on a wash drawing by Robert in his notebook, a treasured memento that Blake used for his own compositions. A combination of words and pictures soon followed: <span class="italic">All Religions are One</span> and <span class="italic">There is No Natural Religion</span>, both of 1788, are Blake's first &#145;Illuminated Books&#146;, as he called his new genre in 1793  (Blake, 693). These aphoristic tractates reject rationalist doctrines and welcome the imaginative truths of revealed religions which were, in Blake's view, one with artistic expression.<br>
<br>Blake produced his first illuminated book of poems, <span class="italic">Songs of Innocence</span>, in 1789. These brief lyrics, their illustrations, and interlinear decorations, reach beyond the genre of children's literature to express Blake's ideal of a unified sensibility incarnate in children, as in Christ. The poems may have been influenced by Moravian hymns Blake had learned from his mother. Catherine Blake helped with the presswork and hand colouring of this and other illuminated books and bound the leaves in wrappers. Although he may have exhibited a few of these singular works at Johnson's shop, Blake apparently sold his illuminated books directly to collectors rather than through booksellers. He and his wife thereby had complete control over all stages of production and distribution.<br>
<br>At about the same time that he developed relief etching, Blake was composing a narrative poem, <span class="italic">Tiriel</span>, his first extensive attempt to create mythic texts by conflating ancient Greek, British, and Hebraic motifs. The format of the <span class="italic">Tiriel</span> manuscript and its associated wash drawings indicate that it was intended for letterpress publication illustrated with intaglio engravings. In <span class="italic">The Book of Thel</span> (late 1789), Blake combined for the first time his new mode of illuminated printing with so-called &#145;prophetic&#146; verse in long lines evocative of allegorical meanings couched in rhetoric alternately gentle and horrific.<h2>
<a name="Revolutionandreaction17901795"></a>Revolution and reaction, 1790&#150;1795</h2>Illuminated printing supplemented, without replacing, Blake's other graphic activities. In 1788 the great print-publishers John and Josiah Boydell hired Blake to execute his largest copy engraving, <span class="italic">Beggar's Opera</span>, after a painting by William Hogarth. He completed the plate in the summer of 1790 and it may have been the fee (unrecorded, but probably substantial) that permitted the Blakes to move to a fine terrace house at 13 Hercules Buildings, Lambeth. Their relative prosperity in this period is indicated by Tatham's story that Blake's house was robbed of goods valued at &pound;100  (Bentley, <span class="italic">Records</span>, 522).<br>
<br>London's booksellers continued to use Blake's skills, commissioning him to engrave illustrations for modest volumes of poetry, mathematics, and medicine, and for influential works such as Erasmus Darwin's <span class="italic">The Botanic Garden</span> (1791) and James Stuart and Nicholas Revett's <span class="italic">The Antiquities of Athens</span> (vol. 3, 1794). After a brief hiatus in the mid-1780s, perhaps caused by Blake's dilatoriness in completing assignments, Johnson was again his main employer. He appears to have appreciated Blake's abilities as an artist and poet, for he hired him to both design and engrave illustrations for Mary Wollstonecraft's <span class="italic">Original Stories from Real Life</span> (1791) and agreed to publish Blake's verse narrative, <span class="italic">The French Revolution</span> (1791), and a small emblem book, <span class="italic">For Children: the Gates of Paradise</span> (1793). Sales of the latter must have been meagre; the poem never progressed beyond proofs of &#145;Book the First&#146;. <span class="italic">The French Revolution</span> set a pattern repeated throughout most of Blake's life: ambitious projects begun with great hopes, only to be cut short by financial or personal failings.<br>
<br>Johnson's commercial importance to Blake's career was matched by his role in introducing Blake to some of England's leading liberal writers and artists, many of whom regularly gathered at the bookseller's. It was probably through Johnson that Blake met and befriended the Swiss-German artist Henry Fuseli, for whose translation of J. C. Lavater's <span class="italic">Aphorisms on Man</span> (1788) Blake engraved the frontispiece. Other plates based on Fuseli's compositions, similar to Blake's own, followed. Blake may have also met more radical figures in the Johnson coterie, including Joseph Priestley and Thomas Paine. Tatham asserts that Blake warned Paine of imminent arrest, just before he left England in 1792, but the story is questionable (Tatham in Bentley, <span class="italic">Records</span>, 530; expanded in Gilchrist, 1.95).<br>
<br>Blake and his wife attended an organizational meeting of the New Jerusalem church, which based its doctrines on the writings of Emanuel Swedenborg, on 13 April 1789. Blake was no thoughtless convert; his annotations to two of Swedenborg's works express growing misgivings. These turned to outright rejection in <span class="italic">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</span> (1790), Blake's most heterodox illuminated book in both its form, a loose gathering of prose and poetry, and content. Through the &#145;voice of the Devil&#146; and &#145;Proverbs of hell&#146;  (Blake, 34&#150;5), he parodies Swedenborg, reverses the cosmology of Milton's <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span>, pronounces that the sensual is an avenue to the spiritual, and attacks the biblical history and morality constructed by the &#145;Angels&#146; of the established church. Energy is celebrated as eternal delight, at war with the restraints of reason. The book concludes with &#145;A Song of Liberty&#146; calling for the revolutionary overthrow of tyrannies religious and secular.<br>
<br>Blake's radical political views continue in <span class="italic">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</span> (1793). Like <span class="italic">The Book of Thel</span>, the poem and its designs centre on a female character. Her rape initiates an incantatory protest against exploitation and enslavement influenced by Wollstonecraft and by John Gabriel Stedman, for whose <span class="italic">Narrative</span> (1796) about a slave revolt in Surinam Blake began engraving illustrations in 1791. <span class="italic">America a Prophecy</span>, also dated 1793, was the first of Blake's &#145;Continental Prophecies&#146; that continued through <span class="italic">Europe</span> (1794) and concluded, somewhat diminished, in <span class="italic">The Song of Los</span> (1795), divided into sections entitled &#145;Africa&#146; and &#145;Asia&#146;. The designs in these books extend beyond direct illustration to establish their own iconographic drama. The texts intermingle figures real (Washington, Franklin) and fictive (Enitharmon, Rintrah), places local (Great George Street) and biblical (Mount Sinai). Blake alludes to contemporary events, but he typically seeks for their ancient origins and millennial conclusions. Three separate engravings of this period, <span class="italic">Albion Rose</span>, <span class="italic">The Accusers of Theft Adultery Murder</span>, and <span class="italic">Lucifer and the Pope in Hell</span>, also herald apocalyptic revolution.<br>
<br>The record of Blake's active engagement with politics is equally complex. Gilchrist claims that Blake was &#145;a vehement republican&#146; who &#145;donned the famous symbol of liberty and equality&#151;the <i>bonnet rouge</i>&#151;in open day&#146;  (1.93&#150;4). But, when Blake learned of &#145;the Days of Terror&#146; in France in September 1792, he &#145;assuredly never wore the red cap again&#146;  (1.94). His cancellation of three plates in <span class="italic">America</span>, one containing direct reference to George III, suggests that Blake may have feared prosecution if his views were stated too directly. Perhaps such fears, coupled with a general sense of dread, led Blake to scribble in his notebook, &#145;I say I shant live five years And if I live one it will be a Wonder June 1793&#146;  (Blake, 694).<br>
<br>There is no record of Blake attending political gatherings of any sort; perhaps his anti-deistic convictions separated him from the secular revolutionaries of his day. His singular religious beliefs also seem to have set Blake on a lonely course. There are striking parallels between Blake's poetry and the writings of several radical protestant groups; but, except for the meeting with Swedenborgians in 1789, it may be true that Blake did not &#145;attend any place of Divine worship&#146; for the last forty years of his life  (Smith in Bentley, <span class="italic">Records</span>, 458).<br>
<br>By October 1793 Blake had built up a stock of illuminated books and other prints sufficient to issue an advertisement &#145;To the Public&#146;. This handbill includes <span class="italic">Songs of Experience</span> (1794), the contrary companion to <span class="italic">Songs of Innocence</span>. Blake first issued <span class="italic">Experience</span>, etched on the backs of the <span class="italic">Innocence</span> copperplates, as a separate volume, but soon combined the collections under a general title-page, <span class="italic">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</span>. Its subtitle, &#145;Shewing the two contrary states of the human soul&#146;, indicates that child and adult are temporal expressions of eternal mental states. Experience enacts a fall into division, but the Bard, &#145;Who Present, Past, &amp; Future sees&#146; and &#145;Whose ears have heard, / The Holy Word&#146;, can reclaim a unified vision  (Blake, 18). Yet these spiritual concerns did not carry Blake away from this world: several poems, including &#145;The Chimney Sweeper&#146; and &#145;London&#146;, are lyrics of social protest.<br>
<br>Blake's next project in illuminated poetry was potentially enormous&#151;a version of <span class="roman">Genesis</span>, perhaps as the first book in the &#145;Bible of hell&#146; announced in <span class="italic">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</span>  (Blake, 44). <span class="italic">The First Book of Urizen</span> (1794) ranges beyond a satanic retelling of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> to establish an even more primordial perspective and construct an ur-myth in which material creation&#151;spatial, temporal, and biological&#151;is one with the fall. Urizen and Los, representatives of both cosmic and psychic forces, are the chief actors in the agonistic drama. There is no &#145;second&#146; book of Urizen; but the brief poems <span class="italic">The Book of Los</span> and <span class="italic">The Book of Ahania</span>, both etched in conventional intaglio in 1795, are fragments of Blake's grand intentions.<h2>
<a name="Epicventures17951800"></a>Epic ventures, 1795&#150;1800</h2>Blake ceased producing illuminated books in 1795, probably owing to poor sales of all but <span class="italic">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</span> and the commencement of other, time-consuming projects. In the previous year, Blake had begun to print his relief etchings in dense, glue-based pigments. He used the technique to create a group of twelve large colour prints without accompanying texts in 1795. Most were printed planographically rather than from relief surfaces. They are among his most powerful designs, with subjects ranging from the <span class="roman">Bible</span> to Shakespeare and Milton. Word and image were further disengaged when, in 1796, the miniature painter Ozias Humphry commissioned a selection of colour-printed designs without texts from Blake's illuminated books. Blake next separated his colouring medium from printing and began to produce his so-called &#145;tempera&#146; or &#145;fresco&#146; paintings on biblical subjects. He exhibited two at the Royal Academy, <span class="italic">The Last Supper</span> in 1799 and <span class="italic">The Loaves and Fishes</span> in 1800. The temperas were commissioned by Thomas Butts, a clerk to the commissary general of musters, the government office in charge of military pay. Butts became Blake's major patron for his drawings and paintings, hiring him to execute over eighty watercolours, also illustrating the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, between 1800 and 1805. Presumably Butts had financial resources beyond his clerk's salary, but the source of additional funds is not known. Perhaps &#145;like most government servants of the period, the system of fees and patronage allowed him to acquire a modest fortune&#146;  (Ackroyd, 206).<br>
<br>Butts is the source for a famous incident related by Gilchrist. Visiting the Blakes while they lived in Lambeth, Butts found the couple nude in their garden summer house. &#145;&#147;<i>Come in!</i>&#148; cried Blake; &#147;<i>it's only Adam and Eve you know!</i>&#148; Husband and wife had been reciting passages from <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span>, in character&#146;  (Gilchrist, 1.115). Although friends who met Blake later in his life and Butts's grandson denied the tale, it does not seem out of character for the man who wrote that &#145;The nakedness of woman is the work of God&#146; and that &#145;Art can never exist without Naked Beauty displayed&#146;  (Blake, 36, 275). Similarly, Tatham's story  (Bentley, <span class="italic">Records</span>, 521) about how &#145;Blakes blood boiled&#146; when he saw a boy punished by having his foot tied to a log befits the man who wrote<blockquote>
<div>A Robin Red breast in a Cage<br>
</div>
<div>Puts all Heaven in a Rage.<br>
</div> (Blake, 490)</blockquote>Blake began the largest commercial project of his career in 1795. The publisher Richard Edwards contracted Blake to execute designs for Edward Young's then famous poem, <span class="italic">Night Thoughts</span>, first published in 1742&#150;6. With his usual attention to what he called &#145;minute particulars&#146;  (Blake, 194), Blake carefully translated Young's words into pictures; but by using his own vocabulary of images, Blake created a visual commentary on the poem. By 1797 Blake had produced 537 large watercolours surrounding the printed text of <span class="italic">Night Thoughts</span>. The modest fee of &pound;21 was probably based on the expectation of much more to follow for engraving the designs. Forty-three plates grace the 1797 volume, the first of four announced, but Edwards closed his business shortly thereafter and no further instalments appeared. Blake's immense labours had failed to produce profit or fame.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Night Thoughts</span> project inspired two others. Blake's 116 watercolours illustrating the poems of Thomas Gray, which repeat the format of the <span class="italic">Night Thoughts</span> designs, were commissioned in 1797 by Flaxman as a gift for his wife. Probably in the previous year, Blake began to compose an epic, first titled <span class="italic">Vala</span> and later changed to <span class="italic">The Four Zoas</span> as layers of revision accumulated. Like Young's poem, Blake's is divided into &#145;Nights&#146; and treats some of the same vast subjects&#151;life, death, immortality. Blake wraps these issues in his own mythology centred on the Zoas (Urizen, Los, Luvah, Tharmas) and their female counterparts, or &#145;emanations&#146;. These beings, their speeches, and contentions, represent phenomena both physical and mental, the two being one in Blake's system. Blake probably worked on the manuscript and its marginal drawings, many sexually explicit, until 1807, but finally abandoned a poem that had spiralled beyond control.<br>
<br>Blake's fortunes waned as the new century approached. In August 1799 he told Cumberland that &#145;even Johnson &amp; Fuseli have discarded my Graver&#146;  (Blake, 704). Lacking these employers, Blake turned increasingly to patrons for his paintings and drawings. Among these were Butts, a good friend by 1799, and Dr John Trusler, who commissioned a watercolour of <span class="italic">Malevolence</span> and apparently tried to instruct the artist in its composition. Blake could not brook interference with his talents and defended his work in two letters of August 1799, the second implying that Trusler was an &#145;Idiot&#146;  (ibid., 702). Patronage ceased.<br>
<br>Another prospect began more propitiously. Blake had been in contact with the popular writer William Hayley, or at least his son Thomas, a student of Flaxman's, since June 1796. By February 1800 Blake was engraving plates for Hayley's <span class="italic">Essay on Sculpture</span>. Hayley was dissatisfied with Blake's copy of a portrait of Thomas, but Blake seems not to have reacted as he did with Trusler. The professional relationship became more personal when Thomas died in May and Blake wrote a letter of condolence to Hayley comparing the father's grief to his own when, years earlier, Blake's brother had died at a similarly early age. The growing friendship between the men, each perhaps a replacement for the other's loss, was strengthened by Hayley's tendency to take under his wing talented men who, he believed, needed him to direct their genius. Blake was a good candidate, a man of heightened imagination who also possessed artisanal skills Hayley could use advantageously.<br>
<br>Blake visited Hayley in July 1800 at his home in Felpham on the Sussex coast. There they apparently came to an informal agreement: Blake would take up residence in Felpham&#151;he immediately made arrangements to rent a cottage&#151;and Hayley would engage him on several designing and engraving projects. Blake had confessed to Flaxman, in a letter written just before his trip, that he was emerging &#145;from a Deep pit of Melancholy&#146;  (Blake, 706), a return to optimism stimulated by the developing relationship with Hayley. Letters to friends through the summer evince Blake's overwrought joy as he and his wife prepared to move to their new home. He associated the change in residence, an escape from &#145;Londons Dungeon dark&#146;, with financial and artistic independence, for under Hayley's patronage Blake hoped to be sufficiently compensated, yet able to &#145;be Poet Painter &amp; Musician as the Inspiration comes&#146;  (letter to Cumberland, 1 Sept 1800, in <span class="italic">Blake: an Illustrated Quarterly</span>, 32, 1998, 4&#150;5). The journey took all day, 18 September. The party included Blake's sister Catherine; the seven chaises of household goods included his rolling press.<h2>
<a name="InterludeinFelpham18001803"></a>Interlude in Felpham, 1800&#150;1803</h2>As his letters indicate, Blake's enthusiasm continued once in Sussex. Hayley received him &#145;with his usual brotherly affection&#146; and Felpham was certain to prove &#145;propitious to the Arts&#146;  (Blake, 710&#150;11). In a letter to Butts of 2 October 1800 Blake included a poem in couplets testifying to his renewed &#145;Vision&#146; by the sea  (ibid., 713). Hayley provided ample employment: a series of portraits of poets to decorate his library; a broadside etched in relief and white-line of Hayley's poem, &#145;Little Tom the Sailor&#146;; portrait miniatures; illustrations for a series of ballads authored by Hayley and distributed (with scant success) by his friends; and engravings for Hayley's <span class="italic">Life of William Cowper</span>. In May 1801 Blake reported to Butts that &#145;Hayley acts like a Prince&#146; and that Felpham remained &#145;the sweetest spot on Earth&#146;  (ibid., 715).<br>
<br>The first dissonant notes emerged from work associated with the biography of Cowper. Beginning in March 1801, Cowper's cousin Lady Harriet Hesketh criticized Blake's miniature, and later his engraving, based on George Romney's portrait of her beloved relation. More generally, Hayley tried to divert Blake from poetry and history painting and direct him into the practical crafts of copy engraving and miniature portraiture. As Blake later jotted in his notebook:<blockquote>
<div>When H&#151;y finds out what you cannot do<br>
</div>
<div>That is the Very thing hell set you to.<br>
</div> (Blake, 506)</blockquote>Although he assisted Blake in acquiring at least a little Latin, Greek, and Hebrew and thereby elevated the London artisan closer to the society of educated gentlemen, differences in class and taste persisted. Hayley treated Blake as a prot&eacute;g&eacute; possessing &#145;admirable Talents&#146; and &#145;uncommon powers of mind&#146;, but also an &#145;eccentric Soul&#146; evincing &#145;Touches of nervous Infirmity&#146; verging on &#145;Insanity&#146;  (Hayley's letters in Bentley, <span class="italic">Records</span>, 83, 87, 106, 164). The decaying relationship with Hayley was compounded with poor health: Catherine Blake's recurring bouts of rheumatism began in November 1800; husband and wife were both ill in spring 1802 and again in January 1803.<br>
<br>Blake's distresses went beyond professional and medical inconvenience. Growing tensions with his patron created, or at least augmented, profound psychic disturbances; indeed, Hayley's characterizations of Blake's mental states may have been reasonably accurate. Blake initially suffered in silence from Hayley's &#145;Genteel Ignorance &amp; Polite Disapprobation&#146;  (letter to Butts, July 1803, Blake, 730), in part because of pecuniary dependence on Hayley's patronage. Such repression produced anguish and a disruption of those extrasensory perceptions that Blake believed to be one with his imagination. He was increasingly torn between fulfilling commissions from Hayley and from Butts, between his calling as an artist and the advice of his more worldly companions (including Hayley, Flaxman, and possibly Catherine Blake), and between temporal and spiritual responsibilities. This fall into a divided consciousness&#151;a dominant motif in much of Blake's poetry&#151;emerges in his letters from the autumn of 1801 to 1803.<br>
<br>In September 1801 Blake confessed to Butts that his &#145;Abstract folly hurries&#146; him away from &#145;Duty &amp; Reality&#146;  (Blake, 716). If by &#145;folly&#146; Blake meant his inner visions, then he had become alienated, however temporarily, from the wellsprings of his art. Unspecified distresses led Blake to write, in November 1802, that he had been &#145;very unhappy&#146;, having &#145;traveld thro Perils &amp; Darkness&#146;, but that he had &#145;again Emerged into the light of Day&#146; with renewed faith in &#145;him who is the Express image of God&#146;  (ibid., letter to Butts, 720). The restoration was short-lived; for several years, Blake's moods alternated between depression and hope, the former expressed in letters and poems through images of darkness, the latter through images of intense illumination and a turn toward Christ as saviour. By January 1803 Blake hinted that Hayley was the &#145;source&#146; of his difficulties and stated his determination &#145;not to remain another winter&#146; in Felpham  (ibid., 724&#150;5). This letter to Butts and an equally revelatory one to his brother James record Blake's most intimate observations on his practical circumstances and psychological state. Prompted (or excused) by ill health and the impending end of the lease on his cottage, Blake states his determination to distance himself from Hayley's friendship, now seen as malevolent. But why would Hayley, outwardly so mild, appear to Blake as a sneaking serpent?&#151;Because he was &#145;jealous&#146; of Blake's talents  (ibid., 725). Surprisingly, Blake likens Hayley's motivation to similar feelings on Stothard's part. It is difficult to believe that either the popular author or successful illustrator coveted the abilities of a man they considered an engraver needful of their advice, but Blake became convinced that &#145;Corporeal Friends are Spiritual Enemies&#146;  (ibid., 98). Blake concluded that he could &#145;alone carry on&#146; his &#145;visionary studies in London unannoyd&#146; by &#145;the Doubts of other Mortals&#146;  (ibid., letter to Butts, 25 April 1803, 728).<h2>
<a name="Confrontationandacquittal18031804"></a>Confrontation and acquittal, 1803&#150;1804</h2>Hayley was aware, by May 1803, of Blake's plans to leave Felpham, but the Blakes were still in their cottage when, on 12 August 1803, a private soldier in the 1st regiment of dragoons, John Scolfield, entered the garden. Not knowing that the man was there on the gardener's invitation, Blake told him to leave. Scolfield refused; heated words were exchanged. Finally Blake, short of stature but not of strength, took Scolfield &#145;by the Elbows &amp; &hellip; pushed him forwards down the road&#146;  (letter to Butts, 16 Aug 1803, Blake, 732). The confrontation, witnessed in its final stages by several villagers and Scolfield's fellow soldier John Cock, ended at The Fox inn, a public house where Scolfield may have been drinking. Three days later Scolfield went before the Chichester justice of the peace, John Quantock, and accused Blake of seditious expressions favouring the French and damning the king of England. Blake refuted the charges vigorously but was ordered to appear at the Michaelmas quarter sessions of the court  (Bentley, <span class="italic">Records</span>, 124&#150;8). Blake's bond of &pound;200 was paid by the accused, Hayley, and Joseph Seagrave, a local printer who had worked with both men. At its sessions on 4 October in Petworth, the grand jury returned bills indicting Blake for sedition against king and country and assault against Scolfield. Blake pleaded not guilty, but it would hardly have been inconsistent with Blake's anti-monarchical views, so evident in his work of the 1790s, to have damned the king while struggling with one of his soldiers.<br>
<br>Blake was &#145;in anguish&#146;, as he states among the inscriptions he cut into a glass rummer in August  (Bentley, <span class="italic">Records Supplement</span>, 24). And not without cause, for sedition was a grave charge at a time when England was fearful of Napoleonic invasion on the coastline where Blake resided. The encounter with Scolfield and its legal consequences increased Blake's paranoia and influenced his writings and friendships for years. He was initially grateful to Hayley for his support and regretful of earlier misgivings, even asking Butts to &#145;burn what I have peevishly written about any friend&#146;  (letter, 16 Aug 1803, Blake, 733). Yet gratitude can become a burden and the benefactor insufferable in the mind of the debtor. Such may have led Blake to believe, contrary to all appearances, that Hayley was implicated in a conspiracy against him, and thus to write a few years later in his notebook that Hayley, having failed to<blockquote>
<div class="indent">act upon my wife<br>
</div>
<div>Hired a Villain to bereave my Life.<br>
</div> (Blake, 506)</blockquote>The Blakes moved to London in September, staying briefly with James Blake before taking rooms at 17 South Molton Street, Westminster, on the edge of Mayfair. Blake returned to Sussex in October to answer the indictment and again for trial on 11 January 1804 in the Chichester Guildhall. He was represented at trial by Samuel Rose, a London barrister retained and paid by Hayley. Before the duke of Richmond and six other magistrates, Rose opened his defence by acknowledging the seriousness of the charge of sedition, impugning Scolfield's character, and insisting on the defendant's innocence. Rose's speech was cut short by illness, but several witnesses testified on Blake's behalf and he was acquitted of all charges.<h2>
<a name="Commerceandpoetry1804"></a>Commerce and poetry, 1804</h2>Shortly after his return to London, Blake complained that &#145;Every Engraver turns away work &hellip; Yet no one brings work to me&#146;. He had little taste for the hurly-burly of the commercial arts in &#145;a City of [character] Assassinations&#146;  (letters to Hayley, 7 Oct 1803 and 28 May 1804, Blake, 736, 751). Blake had to rely on friends, principally Fuseli, Flaxman, and Hayley, for engraving commissions. He assisted Hayley in preparation for a biography of Romney and negotiated with the publisher Richard Phillips for an edition of Hayley's ballads with new engravings of Blake's illustrations. Blake invested in the 1805 <span class="italic">Ballads</span>, but probably lost money. For the Romney biography Blake began to engrave two plates, but only one appeared in the 1809 volume. Commissions for most of the Romney engravings, and for plates in a new edition of the Cowper biography, were given to Caroline Watson, whose softer style Hayley preferred. Blake must have been disappointed, but he told his patron that &#145;the Idea of Seeing&#146; Watson's <span class="italic">Engraving of Cowper</span> was &#145;a pleasing one&#146;  (letter, 22 March 1805, Blake, 764). This and other insincerities prompted by financial dependence led Blake to scrawl in his notebook,<blockquote>
<div>I write the Rascal thanks till he &amp; I<br>
</div>
<div>With Thanks &amp; Compliments are quite drawn dry.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Another couplet addressed &#145;To H&#151;&#146; summarizes Blake's view of the relationship:<blockquote>
<div>Thy Friendship oft has made my heart to ake<br>
</div>
<div>Do be my Enemy for Friendships sake.<br>
</div> (Blake, 506)</blockquote>In October 1804 Catherine Blake received electrical treatment for her rheumatism that reduced &#145;the swelling of her legs and knees&#146;  (Blake, 756). Blake reported, in this same letter to Hayley, an equally dramatic restoration in his psychic condition. After visiting the Truchsessian Gallery, an exhibition of paintings dubiously attributed to artists such as Michelangelo and Rembrandt, Blake &#145;was again enlightened with the light&#146; he had enjoyed in his youth. &#145;I am really drunk with intellectual vision &hellip; as I have not been for twenty dark, but very profitable years&#146;. Blake had &#145;reduced &hellip; to his station&#146; the &#145;Spectrous Fiend&#146;&#151;a personification of those distresses internal and external that had led him astray as an artist, &#145;incessantly labouring and incessantly spoiling&#146; his work  (ibid., 756&#150;7). Blake remained ebullient in early December, telling Hayley that he had &#145;fought thro a Hell of terrors &amp; horrors &hellip; in a Divided Existence now no longer Divided&#146;  (ibid., letter, 4 Dec 1804, 758). While it is difficult to discern any significant change in Blake's pictorial art datable to autumn 1804, his improved spirits may have affected his labours as a poet, an activity known to few, and appreciated by none, except for his wife.<br>
<br>When still in Felpham, Blake had begun to compose in his notebook (and probably in separate drafts now lost) a group of short poems integrating his mythic structures and imagery with a more personal, often anguished, voice. A few years later, Blake wrote out in a clear hand ten poems of a similar tenor in what is now known as the Pickering manuscript, including &#145;The Mental Traveller&#146; and &#145;Auguries of Innocence&#146;. It may have been about this time that Blake began to rise &#145;in the middle of the night&#146; and &#145;write for two hours or more&#146;, often with Catherine Blake at his side (Smith in Bentley, <span class="italic">Records</span>, 475; Gilchrist, 1.316). His renewed poetic instinct culminated in two epics in illuminated printing, <span class="italic">Milton</span> and <span class="italic">Jerusalem</span>, dated 1804 on their title-pages. Both evolved out of, and incorporated many passages from, <span class="italic">The Four Zoas</span> manuscript. As Blake reported to Butts, these interrelated poems were written &#145;from immediate Dictation &hellip; without Premeditation&#146;. The result was a &#145;Sublime Allegory&#146; of which Blake was &#145;the Secretary&#146; for &#145;Authors &hellip; in Eternity&#146;  (letters, 25 April and 6 July 1803, Blake, 729&#150;30). All three poems turn from political revolution and toward mental reconfigurations leading to biblical apocalypse. All three question conventional suppositions about imagination and reality, time and space, self and other, to entertain alternative ways of thinking and being at the core of Blake's visionary literalism.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Milton</span>, not printed until 1810&#150;11, follows the titular hero in a journey of self-discovery and renewal that also reconstructs the bond between Blake and his great predecessor. In the poem's second &#145;Book&#146;, Milton unites with his feminine aspect, Ololon, in progress towards the apocalyptic overcoming of divisions between the sexes, between the living and the dead, and between mind and its projections into the external world. This plot is interwoven with allusions ranging from the <span class="roman">Bible</span> to Blake's own life, particularly the difficult relationship with Hayley. The lyric beginning &#145;And did those feet in ancient time&#146;, now well known as the hymn &#145;Jerusalem&#146;, appears in the &#145;Preface&#146; to <span class="italic">Milton</span>.<br>
<br>The illuminated book entitled <span class="italic">Jerusalem</span>, the one hundred plates of which were not completed until 1820, takes for its subject all of history as a record of desire struggling for fulfilment. The cast of characters is vast, with Los (the artist's imagination at work in the material world), Jerusalem and Albion (the female and male portions of divided humanity who must be reunited), the nature goddess Vala, and Jesus playing major roles. The poem is divided into four chapters, each with a preface addressed to a different audience (the Public, the Jews, the Deists, the Christians), and concludes with a vision of consciousness, liberated and empowered, in a post-apocalyptic universe. Blake beautifully hand-coloured one complete copy of <span class="italic">Jerusalem</span>, but it remained unsold at his death.<h2>
<a name="Patronageandthearts18051817"></a>Patronage and the arts, 1805&#150;1817</h2>Blake's commercial prospects (and probably his spirits) were again rising when, late in the summer of 1805, he was commissioned by the engraver and would-be publisher Robert H. Cromek to illustrate Robert Blair's poem <span class="italic">The Grave</span>, first published in 1743. Blake quickly produced about twenty designs for &#145;the insignificant sum of one guinea each&#146;  (Smith in Bentley, <span class="italic">Records</span>, 464). Fifteen were selected for Blake to engrave, as Cromek announced in a November prospectus. Blake etched one design, <span class="italic">Death's Door</span>, as an example; Cromek exhibited it, along with the drawings, at his shop. The darkly reticulated white-line etching proved so out of step with contemporary tastes that Cromek soon hired the fashionable engraver Louis Schiavonetti to engrave all twelve designs actually published. Blake's loss of this potentially lucrative commission motivated his detached mood, as &#145;one who cares little for this World&#146;, in his letter of 11 December 1805 to Hayley  (Blake, 767). Relations with Cromek may have remained polite until the publisher rejected Blake's dedicatory vignette &#145;To the Queen&#146; in May 1807. Blake recorded his opinion of Cromek in his notebook:<blockquote>
<div>Cr&#151; loves artists as he loves his Meat<br>
</div>
<div>He loves the Art but tis the Art to Cheat.<br>
</div> (ibid., 509)</blockquote>When <span class="italic">The Grave</span> finally appeared in 1808, it included a frontispiece based on Thomas Phillips's 1807 portrait of Blake. The painting emphasizes Blake's hypnotic eyes, by all accounts his most prominent feature and even more evident in an anonymous wash drawing (probably a self-portrait) of <i>c</i>.1803.<br>
<br>The unhappy results of Blake's dealings with Cromek did not forestall another attempt to reach a wide audience. Blake began preparations in 1806 for a panoramic engraving of Chaucer's Canterbury pilgrims starting on their journey. The project was soon embroiled in controversy. When Blake learned that Stothard was painting a similar scene for Cromek, he believed that the publisher, having first commissioned Blake's design and seen the preliminary drawings, had stolen his idea. Although Stothard was almost certainly innocent of any double-dealing, Blake was furious with his old companion. <span class="italic">Chaucer's Canterbury Pilgrims</span>, Blake's largest print, found few purchasers when he published it in 1810. The engraving of Stothard's version, published in 1817, was a popular success.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Grave</span> and Canterbury imbroglios, coupled with reactions to his work of the sort represented by Robert Southey's condescending review of the 1805 <span class="italic">Ballads</span> illustrations, led to Blake's discomfort with commerce in the arts. He felt &#145;stigmatised as an engraver, who might do tolerably well, if he was not mad&#146;  (Malkin in Bentley, <span class="italic">Records</span>, 424). A few words Blake jotted in his notebook offer an even darker self-description: &#145;Tuesday Jan<sup>ry</sup>. 20. 1807 between Two &amp; Seven in the Evening&#151;Despair&#146;  (Blake, 694).<br>
<br>There are no known commercial engravings from Blake's hand between 1806 and 1813. Sales to Butts of watercolours, paintings, a set of the large colour prints designed in 1795, and several illuminated books became a major source of income. During a five-year period beginning in 1806, Butts paid Blake over &pound;400, including fees for teaching engraving to his son  (Bentley, <span class="italic">Records</span>, 175&#150;6). Among the more important projects were series of watercolours illustrating Milton's major poems. The Revd Joseph Thomas commissioned a group of eight designs for <span class="italic">Comus</span> in 1801, followed by <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span> (1807) and &#145;On the Morning of Christ's Nativity&#146; (1809). Between 1808 and 1815, Blake produced similar sets for Butts, to which he added twelve illustrations to &#145;L'allegro&#146; and &#145;Il penseroso&#146; about 1816&#150;20. Perhaps prompted by the &#145;Day of Judgment&#146; design he drew for Blair's <span class="italic">Grave</span>, Blake painted a more elaborate watercolour of that subject for Butts in 1806. A year later, the countess of Egremont commissioned a similar watercolour, for which Blake wrote a detailed description. Patronage supplied what commerce denied.<br>
<br>The 1808 Royal Academy exhibition included two of Blake's watercolours, but a year later he complained that his designs were &#145;regularly refused&#146; by the academy  (Blake, 527). Blake took matters into his own hands and, in May 1809, opened an exhibition of his tempera paintings and watercolours at the family home, 28 Broad Street, now occupied by his brother James. The display may have lasted until June 1810, when Charles and Mary Lamb saw Blake's paintings. Among the sixteen works were &#145;Apotheoses&#146;  (&#145;Prospectus&#146;, Blake, 527) of Admiral Nelson, William Pitt, and Napoleon; the tempera of Chaucer's pilgrims; <span class="italic">Satan Calling up his Legions</span>; and <span class="italic">The Ancient Britons</span>, Blake's largest painting, commissioned by the Welsh antiquary William Owen Pughe, now lost but reported to have been 10 by 14 feet. A letterpress <span class="italic">Descriptive Catalogue</span> contains notes on each design, the longest an analysis of Chaucer's characters and the errors in Stothard's portrayal. This catalogue, along with the harshly critical annotations of <i>c</i>.1808 to Joshua Reynolds's <span class="italic">Discourses</span> and the &#145;Public address&#146; and &#145;A vision of the last judgment&#146; Blake drafted in his notebook <i>c</i>.1810, presents his basic aesthetic concepts: the rejection of classical art in favour of a synthesis of the Hebraic and the Gothic (also boldly stated in the &#145;Preface&#146; to <span class="italic">Milton</span> and there intertwined with a rejection of Hayley's tastes), the superiority of line to colour (in part an inheritance from Blake's training as a line engraver), and the unity of conception and execution (in part a reaction against the complaint that Blake could conceive but could not adequately execute his sublime images). As he wrote in the &#145;Public address&#146;, &#145;Resentment for Personal Injuries&#146; played a role in shaping Blake's views  (Blake, 574).<br>
<br>There is no record of sales resulting from the 1809 exhibition. The single review, by Robert Hunt in <span class="italic">The Examiner</span> on 16 September 1809, mocked the paintings and branded the artist &#145;an unfortunate lunatic&#146;  (Bentley, <span class="italic">Records</span>, 216). After 1810, even commissions from Butts appear to have slowed as Blake sank deeper into obscurity and into his visions as he laboured on <span class="italic">Jerusalem</span> and on another painting of the last judgment, measuring 7 feet by 5 and &#145;containing upwards of one thousand figures&#146;  (Smith in Bentley, <span class="italic">Records</span>, 467), left unsold at Blake's death and now lost. It was during this period that Catherine Blake told the artist Seymour Kirkup, &#145;I have very little of Mr. Blake's company; he is always in Paradise&#146;. In June 1814, George Cumberland's son found Blake &#145;still poor still Dirty&#146;&#151;the dirt probably ink from printing copperplates  (Bentley, <span class="italic">Records</span>, 221, 232). After a period of coolness between the two in 1808, Blake was once again on good terms with Flaxman, on whose recommendation Blake received, by September 1814, the commission to engrave Flaxman's thirty-seven outline illustrations to Hesiod. Without this employment, lasting until 1817, and work (also gained with Flaxman's help) engraving illustrations for Rees's <span class="italic">Cyclopaedia</span> and Wedgwood's catalogue of earthenware, the Blakes might have fallen into dire poverty.<h2>
<a name="Newfriendsandprojects18181826"></a>New friends and projects, 1818&#150;1826</h2>The artist John Linnell visited Blake in June 1818 and hired him to etch the preliminary stages of a portrait of James Upton. From this modest beginning developed a relationship that shaped the final nine years of Blake's life. Although Linnell was thirty-five years Blake's junior, they became good friends, attending art exhibitions and the theatre together. After Linnell moved to Hampstead in March 1824, Blake, always a great walker, often made the uphill journey on foot. There he &#145;sang, in a voice tremulous with age, sometimes old ballads, sometimes his own songs, to [unrecorded] melodies of his own&#146;  (Gilchrist, 1.294).<br>
<br>The artist John Varley was among the first in a new circle of friends to which Linnell introduced Blake. During s&eacute;ance-like sessions, beginning in October 1819 and intermittently repeated during the next six years, Blake drew for Varley over one hundred &#145;Visionary Heads&#146; of persons historical (Edward I, William Wallace) and spiritual (<span class="italic">The Man who Taught Blake Painting in his Dreams</span>). Varley, prompted by his interests in physiognomy and astrology, apparently believed in the literal presence of these figures. Blake may have taken the conjurations less seriously, yet his belief in the reality of imaginative apperception is consistent with visionary portraiture. Blake developed one of his more bizarre images, <span class="italic">The Ghost of a Flea</span>, into a tempera painting; Linnell's engravings of the creature's anthropomorphic head were published in Varley's <span class="italic">Treatise on Zodiacal Physiognomy</span> (1828).<br>
<br>In September 1819 Linnell introduced Blake to his family physician, Robert Thornton, who soon after hired Blake to design illustrations for Ambrose Philips's &#145;Imitation&#146; of Virgil's first eclogue to appear in the third edition of Thornton's school text of Virgil. Blake first produced a relief etching of four small vignettes. These were rejected, probably for reasons both technical and stylistic. As with the <span class="italic">Grave</span> project years earlier, Blake had failed to introduce one of his special graphic methods into a commercial publication. He next prepared twenty-one wash drawings&#151;apparently accepted by Thornton and his publishers&#151;and executed seventeen as wood-engravings. These were so ruggedly different from established conventions that they would have been excluded from Thornton's 1821 edition except for praise from several respected artists, including Sir Thomas Lawrence. The images of melancholy and disruption pictured in Blake's only engravings in wood suggest that Virgil's pastoral lament reminded Blake of his own pastoral sojourn in Felpham under Hayley's burdensome patronage.<br>
<br>Blake's financial circumstances had not improved by the early 1820s; indeed, he may have become poorer. In 1821 he sold his collection of old master prints and moved to just two rooms at 3 Fountain Court, Strand. Blake received a charitable grant of &pound;25 from the Royal Academy in June 1822; Thomas Lawrence also assisted with a gift of money. Blake persevered through these trying times, painting in 1821 one of his most mysterious allegorical designs, <span class="italic">The Sea of Time and Space</span>, illustrating Milton's <span class="italic">Paradise Regained</span> with twelve watercolours, and in 1822 etching in relief two brief works, <span class="italic">On Homers Poetry</span> [and] <span class="italic">On Virgil</span>, a disquisition on the errors of classicism, and <span class="italic">The Ghost of Abel</span>, a response to Byron's <span class="italic">Cain: a Mystery</span>. In the latter, Blake emphasizes the need for forgiveness, suggesting that Blake was seeking release from self-defeating anger through the forgiveness of erstwhile enemies.<br>
<br>Linnell's commissions may have been motivated in part by a desire to provide the ageing artist with a regular income. Blake had produced for Butts a series of nineteen watercolour illustrations to the book of <span class="roman">Job</span> in 1805&#150;6. Linnell traced these in September 1821; Blake later coloured the tracings and added two more designs. This work provided the basis for the contract, signed by Linnell and Blake on 25 March 1823, to engrave the <span class="roman">Job</span> illustrations. The commission provided Blake an income of about &pound;1 a week from 1823 through 1825. The task proved arduous, for Blake engraved the plates without preliminary etching, and the twenty-one designs plus an engraved title-page were not published until March 1825. Blake's graphic retelling of the story begins with Job's blind adherence to the letter of the law; follows Job and his wife through miseries inflicted by Satan, a projection of Job's false vision; and concludes with Job restored to prosperity, the physical sign of his spiritual awakening. Blake's mastery of traditional line engraving in the <span class="roman">Job</span> illustrations recalls the Renaissance artists he so much admired, particularly D&uuml;rer; but the interplay between darkness and light exhibited throughout the series may have been influenced by Linnell's engraving style. This revival of traditional graphics prompted Blake, probably at some point after 1818, to return to intaglio plates he had executed years earlier, including <span class="italic">Joseph of Arimathea</span> and the large <span class="italic">Job</span> and <span class="italic">Ezekiel</span> separate plates, thoroughly to revise them and add new inscriptions. The emblems <span class="italic">For Children</span> became <span class="italic">For the Sexes: the Gates of Paradise</span>.<br>
<br>Through Linnell, a group of young artists met Blake and came to admire him greatly, both for his character and his art. They looked upon him as a seer or <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> prophet come to life; in turn, Blake's peace of mind was enhanced by finding a worshipful audience. Samuel Palmer, only nineteen when first recorded in Blake's company in May 1824, would kiss the &#145;bell-handle&#146; before entering Blake's home, which the group called &#145;the House of the Interpreter&#146; after a passage in Bunyan's <span class="italic">Pilgrim's Progress</span> illustrated by one of Blake's white-line etchings  (Bentley, <span class="italic">Records</span>, 292, 295). George Richmond was the most influenced by the figural style of Blake's art. Works by Palmer and Edward Calvert reveal their profound debt to the Virgil wood-engravings, described by Palmer as &#145;visions of &hellip; Paradise; models of the exquisitest pitch of intense poetry&#146;  (ibid., 271). This loose brotherhood of Blake followers, one that also included Francis Oliver Finch, Frederick Tatham, and Welby Sherman, called themselves &#145;The Ancients&#146; and often sought their own intense responses to nature in the environs of Shoreham, Kent, which Blake visited in late summer 1825.<br>
<br>Blake's youthful associations, perhaps rich with memories of the lost bond with his brother Robert, were complemented by gatherings at the home of Linnell's patrons Charles and Elizabeth Aders. There Blake met Henry Crabb Robinson, who had written an article about Blake in 1811 for a German periodical and had discussed Blake's poems with William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Late in 1825, Robinson began to record Blake's conversations, including gnomic observations uttered in all honesty, but in such a way as to perplex the audience. Robinson writes in his <span class="italic">Reminiscences</span> that Blake said:<blockquote>the most strange things in the most unemphatic manner, speaking of his <i>visions</i> as any man would of the most ordinary occurances. &#145;&hellip; I was Socrates&#146;&#151;and then as if he had gone too far in that&#151;&#145;Or a sort of brother&#151;I must have had conversations with him&#151;So I had with Jesus Christ.&#146; &hellip; Concerning the imputed Divinity of Jesus Christ He answered&#151;&#145;he is the only God&#146;&#151;but then he added&#151;&#145;and so am I and so are you&#146;. (Robinson in Bentley, <span class="italic">Records</span>, 538&#150;40)</blockquote>As in <span class="italic">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</span> and the &#145;Visionary Heads&#146;, Blake again intertwined the profound and the playful.<br>
<br>Continued creativity, in spite of declining health, characterizes Blake's final years. He executed a separate etching/engraving of the <span class="italic">Laoco&ouml;n</span> <i>c</i>.1826, surrounding the famous Hellenistic sculpture with aphorisms on the unity of art and religion and the evils of money and empire. New customers for the <span class="italic">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</span> led Blake to print and elaborately hand colour five copies in the last three years of his life. In the summer of 1824, long before the <span class="roman">Job</span> engravings were completed, Linnell commissioned an even larger project, the illustration of Dante's <span class="italic">Divine Comedy</span>, which provided Blake an income of about &pound;2 a week. He &#145;applied himself to learning Italian&#146;  (Gilchrist, 1.334) and produced 102 watercolours which, like the seven Dante engravings, remained incomplete at his death. Other endeavours cut short by mortality included twenty-nine watercolour illustrations to Bunyan's <span class="italic">Pilgrim's Progress</span>, begun in 1824, and an illuminated manuscript of <span class="roman">Genesis</span>.<h2>
<a name="Thefinalmonths1827"></a>The final months, 1827</h2>Blake began, in the spring of 1825, to have periodic bouts of &#145;Shivering Fit[s]&#146; and &#145;Ague&#146;&#151;perhaps a return of the abdominal maladies he had suffered in Felpham  (letters to Linnell, Blake, 773&#150;4). Although growing ever weaker in the winter of 1826&#150;7, he carried on heroically with the Dante designs and a small calling card for his old friend Cumberland. In April 1827 Blake told Cumberland that he had been &#145;near the Gates of Death &amp; have returned very weak &amp; an Old Man feeble &amp; tottering, but not in Spirit &amp; Life not in The Real Man The Imagination which Liveth for Ever&#146;  (Blake, 783). A failing liver caused jaundice, but still he laboured on. According to Tatham, in his last few days Blake coloured an impression of the <span class="italic">Ancient of Days</span> (the frontispiece to <span class="italic">Europe</span>) and drew Catherine Blake's portrait  (Bentley, <span class="italic">Records</span>, 527&#150;8).<br>
<br>Blake died at 3 Fountain Court on 12 August 1827. Three days later, Richmond informed Palmer that Blake<blockquote>died on Sunday Night at 6 Oclock in a most glorious manner. He said He was going to that Country he had all His life wished to see &amp; expressed Himself Happy hoping for Salvation through Jesus Christ&#151;Just before he died His Countenance became fair&#151;His eyes brighten'd and He burst out in Singing of the things he Saw in Heaven. (Bentley, <span class="italic">Records</span>, 346&#150;47)</blockquote>The precise cause of Blake's death is not known, but the most detailed analysis of the symptoms suggests biliary cirrhosis, possibly caused by years of inhaling cupreous fumes while etching  (Robson and Viscomi). Blake was buried on 17 August at Bunhill Fields, Finsbury, traditionally a cemetery for nonconformists where his parents and other family members were interred. Yet, according to Smith, Blake had requested a funeral service &#145;of the Church of England&#146;  (Bentley, <span class="italic">Records</span>, 476). Catherine Blake went to live with Linnell, but after about six months she moved to Tatham's home, where she served as housekeeper. In 1829 the earl of Egremont purchased from her Blake's <span class="italic">The Characters in Spenser's Faerie Queene</span>, a companion to the Canterbury pilgrims painting, for 80 guineas, a sum sufficient to supply her needs for the rest of her life. She died on 18 October 1831, leaving to Tatham the remaining stock of Blake's works, possibly including manuscripts which Tatham destroyed. After reprinting some of Blake's illuminated books, he claimed that most of the copperplates had been stolen  (Gilchrist, 1.126); only one small fragment of a relief-etched plate has survived.<h2>
<a name="Nineteenthcenturyreputation"></a>Nineteenth-century reputation</h2>The mythologizing of Blake's life began with the (embellished?) descriptions of his final days written by friends who considered him a sage. A different characterization emerged in obituaries: Blake was &#145;one of those ingenious persons &hellip; whose eccentricities were still more remarkable than their professional abilities&#146;  (<span class="italic">Literary Chronicle</span>, 1 Sept 1827, in Bentley, <span class="italic">Records</span>, 351). J. T. Smith's reasonably straightforward memoir of 1828 was followed two years later by Allan Cunningham's more dramatic account of Visionary Blake, a compound of genius and madness. For the next three decades, Blake was remembered primarily as a psychological curiosity, his poetry unknown beyond <span class="italic">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</span> (first published in letterpress in 1839), his designs little known beyond the illustrations to Blair's <span class="italic">Grave</span>.<br>
<br>Alexander Gilchrist's <span class="italic">Life of William Blake</span> (1863) soon belied its subtitle, &#145;Pictor ignotus&#146;, by bringing the man and his work to the attention of a far larger audience than he had previously commanded. Although he rarely indicates his sources, Gilchrist includes information learned from people who had known Blake. Gilchrist died two years before publication; his widow saw the biography through the final stages of its production, assisted by Dante Gabriel Rossetti and his brother William Michael, whose catalogue of Blake's art appeared in the second volume of the work. Arguably the most important book ever published on Blake, Gilchrist's biography sets Blake within his intellectual and social milieu, but presents him as a secular saint&#151;a perspective influenced by Thomas Carlyle's theories of the artist as hero. Growing interest in Blake led to the first exhibition devoted to his art at the Burlington Fine Arts Club (London) in 1876.<br>
<br>Algernon Charles Swinburne, also a Blake enthusiast in the Gilchrist/Rossetti circle, published the first book-length study of Blake's poetry in 1868. A heterodox and revolutionary Blake emerges in Swinburne's critique, one that includes high praise for <span class="italic">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</span>. While even Swinburne could do little more with Blake's later poetry than extract brief passages for comment, Edwin John Ellis and William Butler Yeats plunged headlong into the apparent chaos. Unfortunately, their three-volume edition and study of 1893 is marred by poor scholarship, a Procrustean notion of mystic symbolism, and a belief that Blake was Irish.<h2>
<a name="Twentiethcenturyreputation"></a>Twentieth-century reputation</h2>John Sampson brought scholarly expertise to the editing of Blake's poetry in 1905, but a full and accurate edition of Blake's writings was still wanting. The challenge was taken up by Geoffrey Keynes, who more than any other individual shaped the public perception of Blake in the twentieth century. In 1921 Keynes published a detailed bibliography of Blake's writings, engraved book illustrations, and texts about him, followed four years later by a complete edition. Keynes continued to produce editions and scholarly essays devoted to Blake until his death in 1982. He was the key figure in founding in 1949 the William Blake Trust, which sponsored publication of facsimiles of the illuminated books (1951&#150;76) and a second series of more affordable reproductions with scholarly introductions (1991&#150;5).<br>
<br>Joseph Wicksteed's commentary on the <span class="roman">Job</span> engravings (1910) set a new standard for the study of Blake's pictorial art; S. Foster Damon's <span class="italic">William Blake: his Philosophy and Symbols</span> (1924) made a similar but more extensive contribution to the study of Blake's ideas and poetry, thereby initiating the critical appreciation of Blake in the United States. His reputation continued to develop in America through the inter-war years, assisted by major collectors (particularly Henry Huntington and Lessing Rosenwald) and a comprehensive exhibition of his works in Philadelphia in 1939; but it was not until 1947, with the publication of Northrop Frye's <span class="italic">Fearful Symmetry</span>, that Blake's reputation as a poet began an exponential ascent. By setting Blake within a tradition of poetry extending from the <span class="roman">Bible</span> to Virgil, Spenser to Milton, Frye's book, more than any other single study, established Blake as a defining presence in the pantheon of English Romantic poetry, the equal of Wordsworth and Coleridge. Seven years later, David Erdman's <span class="italic">Blake: Prophet Against Empire: a Poet's Interpretation of the History of his Own Time</span>, constructed an alternative foundation for the scholarly understanding of Blake in the second half of the century. Whereas Frye's perspective tended to emphasize a unifying system in Blake's work, nascent at the beginning and fleshed out in the later (and now fully appreciated) epics, Erdman perceived an evolution in response to shifting events in a revolutionary age. Frye's Blake rose above history; Erdman's Blake was fully engaged in time.<br>
<br>By the last two decades of the century, Erdman's view became dominant, as a host of scholars set Blake within various historical and cultural contexts, ranging from printmaking to radical protestant and political groups. Others argued for Blake as a prophet of twentieth-century intellectual fashions, finding him a Marxist, Freudian, or deconstructionist <i>avant la lettre</i>. The illuminated books, with their complex interactions between words and pictures, remained at the centre of critical debate, but every document, visual and verbal, received attention. During this same period, all requisite scholarly tools were produced: editions true to Blake's unconventional spelling and punctuation; a concordance to his writings; an exhaustive bibliography; complete catalogues of his paintings, drawings, and prints; several biographies; a journal-of-record devoted to its eponymous hero; and, by the century's final decade, an electronic archive on the internet. &#145;Blake&#146; signified an academic industry as much as a man.<br>
<br>Blake's influence on the arts and on popular culture forms an important part of his twentieth-century legacy. In 1916 Charles Hubert Parry set to music the &#145;Jerusalem&#146; lyric from <span class="italic">Milton</span>; it soon became one of the most sung hymns in the Church of England. The dramatic postures in Blake's <span class="roman">Job</span> designs led Keynes to conceive of the ballet <span class="italic">Job</span>, which d&eacute;buted in 1931 with music by Ralph Vaughan Williams, stage and costume designs by Gwendolen Raverat, and choreography by Ninette de Valois. Except for his profound effect on Yeats, Blake was not a major influence on twentieth-century British poetry. In America, however, the important poets Theodore Roethke and Allen Ginsberg, and the author and illustrator Maurice Sendak, considered themselves inspired by Blake. His impact on the visual arts was similarly limited, but intensely felt in the 1920s by a group of young printmakers, including Graham Sutherland.<br>
<br>By mid-century Blake had become one of the cultural icons of the English-speaking world. The British Museum, the British Library, and the Tate Gallery housed important collections of his works, as did the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, Australia, and several major institutions in the United States, including the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC, the Yale University Center for British Art, and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. Single drawings and letters fetched at auction more than Blake made in his lifetime; copies of his illuminated books sold for over &pound;1 million. &#145;The Tyger&#146; from <span class="italic">Songs of Experience</span> became the most anthologized text in the language, <span class="italic">The Ancient of Days</span> one of the most widely recognized images. The installation of Jacob Epstein's bust of Blake in Westminster Abbey in 1957 signalled Blake's acceptance by the establishment; in the next decade he became a hero to a youthful counter-culture. &#145;The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom&#146;  (Blake, 35) and other energetic outbursts in Blake's writings became rallying cries for those advocating political, sensual, and intellectual liberation.<br>
<br>Blake's reputation reached international proportions by the end of the century. Translations of his poetry were complemented by exhibitions of his art in Germany, Italy, Japan, Israel, and Spain. In his homeland, a single sculptural response epitomized Blake's stature. Eduardo Paolozzi's monumental bronze of Isaac Newton, installed in the forecourt of the new British Library in 1995, copies Blake's <span class="italic">Newton</span> colour print of 1795. Britain entered a new millennium with the image of its greatest scientist, placed at the entry to its greatest repository of knowledge, shaped by the vision of William Blake.<br>
