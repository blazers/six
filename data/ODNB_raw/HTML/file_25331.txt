<span class="headword">Shepherd,  George Sidney</span>  (1784&#150;1862), <span class="occ">draughtsman and watercolour painter</span>, was born on 5 December 1784 in Old Street, Finsbury, London, the son of George Shepherd, a watchcase maker, and his wife, Nancy Hosmer. He was baptized on 22 March 1785 at his parish church of St Luke's, Old Street. Shepherd's dates and life have long been somewhat unclear. Until the late twentieth century George Shepherd&#151;the present subject&#151;was understood to be the father of George Sidney Shepherd, whose monogram G.S.S. first appears on two careful monochrome wash drawings of Highgate about 1810. It is now thought that George and George Sidney were not father and son but the same person. Even though reconciling the separate signatures remains problematic and despite the fact that there are significant stylistic differences between their work, conflating these two men helps to explain various biographical discrepancies. The full signature &#145;George Sidney Shepherd&#146; first appears on a watercolour of Smithfield Market of 1824, the year in which he similarly baptized his son Algernon Sidney Shepherd. It was also the period when his style began to develop from delicate, small-scale, and precise <i>views</i> of places to larger-scale, more painterly, and impressionistic <i>scenes</i> of life, an evolution which can be understood in relationship to the changing taste for topography and genre. The possibility that George Shepherd changed his professional name in order to mark distinctions in his work is reinforced by the parish records which show that he continued as George when registering the baptism of his eight children.<br>
<br>Taking George Shepherd to be the youthful George Sidney helps to plot the events of this artist's career. Like his brother <a href="#cosubject_25339">Thomas Hosmer [<i>see below</i>]</a>, who became a topographical draughtsman and drawing master, George showed talent early; by 1800 he had exhibited the first of many topographical views at the Royal Academy. During his late teens he also won silver palettes at the Society of Arts in 1803 and 1804 and may have mixed with other artists at Dr Cox Macro's sketching academy where there is a reference to a Mr Shepherd in 1806. Like the watercolour <span class="italic">Tottenham Court Church</span> (1800), Shepherd's earliest subjects were all within striking distance of his home, off the City Road in rural Islington. By 1807, however, he began to travel further afield, going to Cambridge and Northampton to produce sketches for John Britton's <span class="italic">Architectural Antiquities of Great Britain</span> in 1807. While his work for various publishers sent him to many areas of England, on 16 March 1812 Shepherd married Anna Sarah Lonnon (<i>b</i>. 1790, <i>d</i>. before 1831) of Bedfordshire and this explains his trips and watercolours of that region. Despite his reputation as a metropolitan topographer, Shepherd's marked sympathy with rural and natural landscapes can be seen in a number of his watercolours including <span class="italic">At East Acton</span> (1814) or his several scenes on the River Thames (<i>c</i>.1818&#150;25). Doubtless Shepherd's greatest strength was in depicting the urban sphere and particularly London. He was an excellent topographical draughtsman who was able to express complicated perspectives and detailed architectural elevations in the many, deceptively simple, pen-and-wash drawings that he prepared for others to engrave. This can be seen to great effect in general works such as the <span class="italic">European Magazine</span> as well as in J. Booth's <span class="italic">Architectural Series of London Churches</span> (1818) or Robert Wilkinson's <span class="italic">Londina illustrata</span> (1825&#150;34), which was published to fuel the increasing fashion for images which depicted the ancient roots of the modern metropolis.<br>
<br>Living on the outskirts of a bustling city, Shepherd evidently had an implicit understanding of urban life. Even in the most abbreviated lines he eloquently captured the humanity and humour that typified London life. This was consolidated in the second half of his career when he began to concentrate on these elements and seems to have sought recognition as a more painterly watercolour artist. Although he continued to favour scenes of London life, his views of Charing Cross, Hungerford Stairs, and demolition work near the Monument were executed in a larger format which gave him the opportunity to develop the genre and even caricature of these subjects. By the 1830s and 1840s he had expanded his palette and his technique; skies became more impressionistic and costumes more colourful.<br>
<br>In 1832 Shepherd began exhibiting at the Society of British Artists and was a founder subscriber to the New Society of Painters in Water Colours in 1834. Because he worked less frequently for publishers after the 1840s the minutes of that society give the best sense of Shepherd's activities during this time. Despite being fined for non-attendance at their meetings in 1840 he was evidently still active as he also owed them money for selling paintings at their exhibitions. By 1859 his name no longer appears on their list of members and a begging letter from his son, of 5 November 1860, records why the twice-widowed and ailing Shepherd was no longer heard from. After suffering a stroke in March 1858, Shepherd ceased working and became increasingly ill and impecunious until his death in 1862. He was supported by the New Society of Painters in Water Colours who made their final donation to his cause on 3 February 1861.<br>
<br>During his career Shepherd worked several times for the publishing magnate Rudolph Ackermann and it was under his auspices that he first collaborated with his younger brother <a name="cosubject_25339"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Hosmer Shepherd</span>  (1793&#150;1864) in 1813. Together they prepared a series of street views for Ackermann's <span class="italic">Repository of the Arts</span> where Thomas had already published his view of the East India House in 1809. Although the interests and skills of the two brothers certainly overlap, Thomas was less interested in antiquarian themes. In 1816 he designed a series of six London street scenes whose detail and vivacity characterized his <i>&#339;uvre</i>. Despite a reputation built upon depicting a variety of modern, fashionable cities Thomas Hosmer showed a similar skill with nature. He made his first sketching tour aged seventeen and as the illustrations in Thomas Rose's <span class="italic">Westmorland</span> (1832) or William Gray Fearnside's <span class="italic">Views of the Rhine</span> (1832) demonstrate this was followed by several others. Due to the existence of a watercolour of the site of a former Napoleonic encampment at Boulogne it also appears that Thomas visited France in 1818 and it is thought that this was by way of a honeymoon with his new bride, Jane Maria (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1797, <i>d</i>. in or after 1864). Perhaps the trip left the couple with especially fond memories; in June 1819 they named their first born, the artist, Frederick Napoleon Shepherd (1819&#150;1878).<br>
<br>Although Thomas Shepherd had no problems finding work as a topographical draughtsman, his real break came in 1826 when Jones &amp; Co. commissioned a series of views of London's newest buildings, streets, and squares for engraving on steel and issuing as a part work. With its text by the architect James Elmes, <span class="italic">Metropolitan Improvements</span> (1827) was principally received as a visual celebration of modern London. Such was the success of this publication that Jones &amp; Co. capitalized on the formula with <span class="italic">Modern Athens</span> (1828), a similar volume on Edinburgh, and another called <span class="italic">Bath and Bristol &hellip; Displayed</span> (1829). Between 1826 and 1831 Jones &amp; Co. &#145;appear to have monopolised Thomas Hosmer's pencil&#146;  (Phillips, <span class="italic">Shepherd's London</span>, 11) and during this time he produced about 450 plates by sketching on the spot, then working up finished wash drawings at home in his studio. However, as one surviving advertisement reveals, he also found time to offer his services as a drawing master, at his home in Chapman Street, Islington.<br>
<br>Work for Jones &amp; Co. did eventually dry up but it was definitely the cornerstone to Thomas Shepherd's later career. He was able to rework or reduce many of these designs for his next (rather more modest) project, 400 drawings for Charles Frederick Partington's <span class="italic">Natural History and Views of London</span> (1835). Other London projects were soon forthcoming; Charles Knight commissioned thirty-four wood-engravings for his <span class="italic">London</span> (1841&#150;4) and Ernest Gambart published twenty-two coloured lithographs after Shepherd in his <span class="italic">London in Miniature</span> (1854). The last major commission of his career was for sixteen drawings to illustrate <span class="italic">Mighty London</span> (1855) where a thronging, fashionable, and cosmopolitan London was proudly positioned at the very heart of the empire.<br>
<br>Although he found regular work providing topical and topographical images for the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>, after 1842, Thomas Hosmer Shepherd was often drastically poor. Indeed, Thomas's lengthy relationship with Frederick Crace, the collector, was his saving. Between 1809 and 1859 Crace consistently commissioned him to make watercolours of specific London sites, buildings, and locations. Such was the renown of Crace's topographically organized, near-comprehensive, metropolitan collection that this led to further commissions for Shepherd. It is for this reason that many of his watercolours are known in multiple versions; the best version is usually in the Crace collection, now at the British Museum. Thomas's dependence on this patron is clear from the fact that his last dated drawing comes from five weeks before Crace's death on 18 September 1859. Five years later, on 4 July 1864, Thomas Hosmer Shepherd died in Islington. He was survived by two sons, Frederick Napoleon and Valentine Claude, who were both practising artists.<br>
