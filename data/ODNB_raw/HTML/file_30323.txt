<span class="headword">Aberhart,  William</span>  (1878&#150;1943), <span class="occ">politician and evangelist in Canada</span>, was born in Hibbert township, near Seaforth, Perth county, Ontario, on 30 December 1878, the son of William Aberhart (who as a child had been brought from Germany) and his wife, Louisa Pepper, the daughter of an Englishman. He was educated at schools in Ontario and at a business college at Chatham, Ontario, and he graduated from a correspondence programme of Queen's University, Kingston, as BA in 1906. He married in 1902 Jessie, daughter of George Flatt, of Galt, Ontario, with whom he had two daughters.<br>
<br>Aberhart took up school teaching and became principal of a school at Brantford. In 1910 he moved to Alberta, then an agricultural region recently established as a province, and in 1915 became principal of Crescent Heights high school, Calgary, a post which he held until he entered the provincial government in 1935. As an active lay preacher he formed in 1918 an institute for the study of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. He began broadcasting in 1924 and funds from his audience quickly enabled the institute to build premises for its classes in 1927 and to extend its broadcasting. It was known as the Calgary Prophetic Bible Institute.<br>
<br>The universal collapse of wheat prices after 1929 caused profound distress among the wheat farmers, and to them, as to the urban unemployed in the years of depression, Aberhart's vigorous broadcasts at once brought the comforts of evangelical preaching and the hope of economic relief through the issue of a free, popular currency known as social credit. His monetary theories, which he began to broadcast after 1932, were adopted from those of Major Clifford Hugh Douglas, of Fearnan, Perthshire, who visited Canada several times and whose views had already been made familiar by the United Farmers Party of Alberta, which had formed the Alberta government since 1921 and was also represented in the House of Commons at Ottawa. In 1933 Aberhart published a pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Douglas System of Economics</span>, which found a wide sale.<br>
<br>Aberhart's advocacy of social credit drew increasing attention to his broadcasts and led to the formation of listening or study groups throughout Alberta, which were later organized as the Alberta Social Credit League. This league at first had no intention of challenging the provincial government, but it adopted political tactics in pressing its policies upon the government by petitions, delegations, and extensive activity by the local study groups, to which the government replied by appointing Douglas as one of its advisers. In the elections of August 1935 Social Credit candidates, approved by Aberhart and the party leaders, won fifty-six out of the sixty-three seats in the provincial legislature, and Aberhart, who later was returned for Okotoks&#150;High River by acclamation, was called upon to form a government. He became premier and minister of education.<br>
<br>Aberhart was a man of robust physique and mercurial temperament, who won respect for his energy and fervour. In office, as in education, he proved a sound administrator and organizer. His electoral success, in the critical economic situation of the time, flowed from his popular influence as a <span class="roman">Bible</span> teacher and an advocate of social credit, one of the aspects of which was an election promise to distribute a &#145;social dividend&#146; of &pound;25 a month to every adult in the province. More significantly, his power with the public was due to his championship of the debtors against their creditors, whom he described as eastern Canadian and international bankers and financiers. In its early, more radical years, the Social Credit Party resembled earlier farm debtors' movements in western America, such as that for &#145;free silver&#146;. But the movement's leadership was primarily urban-based and party support in the 1935 provincial election reflected a split between better-off Albertans and those struggling to make it through the depression, rather than an urban&#150;rural split. Provincial legislation to control banks and cancel debts, public or private, was, however, found <i>ultra vires</i> by the courts and disallowed. Attempts to control the press were also ineffective. The government had to be content with establishing a parallel provincial banking system of so-called treasury branches.<br>
<br>Aberhart's outlook remained greatly influenced by the Douglas social crediter, L. D. Byrne, the technical adviser to the Alberta Social Credit Board. But, for the most part, after his re-election in 1940 Aberhart's policies reflected an acceptance of the limitations on a provincial government in the area of credit and banking. During its first term in office the Social Credit government passed legislation of benefit to farmers and workers, and alienated most of the business community. In its second term, although the government was active in social welfare, labour questions, and the field of education, it moved away from radical experimentation, turning towards both cautious administration and opposition to the state activity in business advocated by socialists. Aberhart died in Vancouver on 30 May 1943, while still in office. He was survived by his wife.<br>
