<span class="headword">Wedderburn, Sir  John</span>  (1599&#150;1679), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was the fifth son of Alexander Wedderburn (1561&#150;1626) of Kingennie, and Helen, daughter of Alexander Ramsay of Brachmont in Fife, and was born at Dundee. Alexander was the second town clerk of Dundee, representative in the Scottish parliament, and one of the commissioners for union between England and Scotland. John Wedderburn matriculated at St Andrews University in 1615, graduated in 1618, and was professor of philosophy there in 1620&#150;30. Having chosen the medical profession and become &#145;a gentleman of known learning and vast experience&#146;  (Wood, 93), he was appointed physician to the king and obtained a pension of &pound;2000 Scots from Charles I, which was confirmed to him by Charles II. Following family example, Wedderburn studied medicine on the continent, and was with Prince Charles in the Netherlands. On 9 April 1646 he was incorporated DM of Oxford University upon the recommendation of the chancellor. On 14 December 1649 he was admitted a licentiate of the College of Physicians. He acquired a large fortune, and was so generous to his two nephews that one, Sir Alexander Wedderburn, acquired the estate of Blackness, while the other, Sir Peter Wedderburn, bought Gosford in Haddingtonshire in 1659. Wedderburn was knighted between January 1661 and April 1663. Infirmity and old age compelled his partial retirement to Gosford in 1662. There he was still sought for his hospitality, advice, and conversation. He died there in July 1679 and was probably buried in the churchyard of Aberlady, Haddingtonshire. He was unmarried. By his will he bequeathed his extensive and valuable library to St Leonard's College, St Andrews University, of which he was regent.<br>
