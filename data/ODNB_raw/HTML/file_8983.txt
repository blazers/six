<span class="headword">Evans,  Thomas</span>  (1738/9&#150;1803), <span class="occ">bookseller</span>, was born in Wales and although the identity of his parents is unknown, his background, by all accounts, was humble, with the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> discerning &#145;very little to boast of in point of [his] origin&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 696). Evans eventually moved to London, where at first he lived with and served as porter to William Johnston, a bookseller in Ludgate Street, and on 23 April 1776 was made free of the Musicians' Company. It was by &#145;industry and perseverance&#146; that he became an &#145;eminent bookseller&#146;  (ibid.), working in the centre of London's book trade precinct from several addresses in Paternoster Row between 1770 and 1797. For a number of years during the early 1770s Evans was publisher of the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> and <span class="italic">London Packet</span>, by means of which he became acquainted with many literary characters of the day. Although friendly with many members of London's literati, his association with the Irish writer Oliver Goldsmith was less amicable as a result of one article, reflecting upon Goldsmith and Miss Horneck, a female acquaintance, published by Evans in the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>. Goldsmith was so incensed by the article that he resorted to a physical confrontation, but Evans reputedly defended himself &#145;in a true pugilistic style&#146;, and in a few moments the author of <span class="italic">The Vicar of Wakefield</span> &#145;was disarmed, and extended on the floor, to the no small diversion of the by-standers&#146;  (ibid.). Goldsmith was subsequently indicted for an assault and compromised by paying &pound;50 to a Welsh charity.<br>
<br>By 1779 Evans had taken control of the extensive bookselling business of Hawes, Clarke, and Collins at 32 Paternoster Row, and was by this time a competent master of his trade, training apprentices who, according to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, became &#145;ornaments of their profession&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 696). Evans had married a woman named Ann about this time and was the father of his only son, James Evans. In 1789, father and son were working together, but the following year James was trading alone and married a daughter of Archibald Hamilton II. In 1792 James was made free of the Stationers' Company, but on 18 July 1795 he was declared bankrupt and went to America before returning to England, where he died in poverty eighteen months before his father. Thomas Evans, by contrast, had amassed a significant personal fortune and was able to retire in 1797, before separating from his wife the following year, apparently on account of her partiality for one of her sons.<br>
<br>Evans died, aged sixty-four, on 2 July 1803 at his lodgings in Chapter House Court, London, after suffering from a short and unknown illness. Considered by some contemporaries as a man of rough and eccentric habits, Evans requested in his will that he was to be buried without a coffin, that his grave should not have a tombstone, and that the funeral would cost no more than 40 shillings. His son was to be a beneficiary of his will to the amount of &pound;200, while to his wife he bequeathed &pound;40 a year and a further &pound;20 per annum to a niece, Sarah Morgan, as well as a share of his property to his sister, Eleanor Vaughan. The remainder of his estate was left to his friend of forty years and fellow bookseller, Christopher Brown.<br>
