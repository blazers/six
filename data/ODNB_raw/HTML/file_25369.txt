<span class="headword">Sheridan,  Thomas</span>  (1687&#150;1738), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and Church of Ireland clergyman</span>, was born in co. Cavan, Ireland, the son of Patrick Sheridan, a farmer of whom nothing more is certainly known. He attended the school of John Jones, the Dublin schoolmaster who was Jonathan Swift's contemporary at Trinity College, Dublin, and in 1707, at the relatively late age of twenty, entered Trinity himself. He graduated BA in 1711, was ordained priest in 1712, and took his MA in 1714. In 1710 or 1711, still &#145;in the mad years of life&#146;  (Dolan, 5), he married Elizabeth, only child of Charles and Anne McFadden of Quilca, near Virginia, in co. Cavan.<br>
<br>Sheridan apparently began his teaching career before 1714, in Irish classical schools, which emphasized the Latin classics and trained their boys to be young gentlemen. Like other enlightened schoolmasters of the period he decried teaching Latin through &#145;a Heap of Rules&#146; and by &#145;frightening &hellip; [boys] out of their Wits&#146;  (T. Sheridan, <span class="italic">An Easy Introduction of Grammar in English for the Understanding of the Latin Tongue</span>, 1714, preface), and in 1714 published his own improved version of Lily's <span class="italic">Royal Grammar</span>, using English verse as a mnemonic aid. It is not certain how he met Swift but their acquaintance probably began in 1717, when Sheridan was a well-established and notably successful Dublin schoolmaster. His remarkable talents as a classical scholar and modern linguist impressed and attracted Swift, as, even more so, did his taste for satire and wordplay in both verse and prose. He was soon tutoring Swift in Greek, while Swift for his part took an active interest in Sheridan's school, finding peculiar delight in his role as examiner. Sheridan's preference in school for the verbal&#151;rather than the actual&#151;lash found favour with Swift, who described his friend as &#145;doubtless the best instructor of youth in these kingdoms&#146;  (Swift, 216).<br>
<br>Though a priest, Sheridan had no benefice until 1725, when he was thirty-eight, and ran his school as a private enterprise. Probably with an eye to preferment and additional income, he took the degrees of BD in 1724 and DD in 1726. In the meantime, in 1725, Swift interceded with the lord lieutenant of Ireland, Lord Carteret, to obtain for Sheridan the living of Rincurran, in co. Cork, and an appointment as one of Carteret's domestic chaplains. Seldom far from the ludicrous, Sheridan&#151;it seems through sheer carelessness&#151;promptly chose the anniversary of the Hanoverian succession to preach a sermon on the text &#145;Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof&#146;. If no malice was intended, such a sentiment coming from a high-church tory was bound to cause comment, and when Carteret was informed of what had happened he stripped Sheridan of the chaplaincy and barred him from Dublin Castle. Subsequent attempts to secure patronage and gain preferment failed, and in 1730 Sheridan exchanged the living of Rincurran for that of Dunboyne and Kilbride, in co. Meath, near Dublin and on the way to his estate in Quilca. In 1735, with the income from his school in Dublin declining, he closed the school and exchanged the Dunboyne living for the Royal School in Cavan, a move that helped to stabilize his always rickety finances.<br>
<br>To a mind teeming with learning and humour were added a feckless and vague character and a build more suited to a mouse than a man, with accompanying shrill and squeaky voice. The nicknames Tom Titt and Tom Dingle suited Sheridan well, as did his <i>nom de guerre</i>, Tom Pun-sibi, under which name his <span class="italic">Art of Punning</span> appeared in 1719 and which more generally expressed the &#145;pun-ishment&#146; he took and inflicted on Swift and others in his mock-serious &#145;pun-ic wars&#146;. On the subject of his unhappy marriage, which produced nine children, including the actor&#150;manager <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25371/', "Thomas Sheridan (1719?&#150;1788)")</script>, his humour turned to acid, and in 1735 he told Swift that he had been &#145;linked to the Devil for twenty-four years, with a coal in my heart, which was kindled in the first week I married her&#146;  (Dolan, 5). The sad union reinforced his own view of his greatest failing: &#145;I am famous for giving the best advice and following the worst&#146;  (ibid., 22). Consolation came from his intimacy with Swift, and though the relationship was at times strained, since neither was afraid to dwell on the other's faults, its closeness may be seen from their long stays with one another, the financial help given by Swift to Sheridan, and the care that Sheridan bestowed on Esther Johnson (Stella) in her last illness.<br>
<br>Sheridan's literary work was, like Swift's, in large part an extension of his character. Doggerel and other nonsense, including farces performed on the Dublin stage, poured from his pen. On his more serious side, he translated Sophocles, Persius, Guarini, and Tasso. In 1728 and 1729 the Dublin periodical <span class="italic">The Intelligencer</span> appeared, each number comprising a separate contribution from Swift or Sheridan, with Irish economic, social, and political issues as the general theme.<br>
<br>By 1737 Sheridan was in failing health, and he left the school in Cavan to return to Dublin. According to his son Thomas he was at the end insulted and shunned by the increasingly gloomy dean. He retired to a friend's house in Rathfarnham and died there on 10 October 1738, of &#145;a dropsy and asthma&#146;, according to Swift, or of &#145;a polypus in the heart&#146;, according to his son. In his will he left only 5<i>s</i>. to his &#145;unkind wife&#146;.<br>
