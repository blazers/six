<span class="headword">Williams,  George</span>  (1814&#150;1878), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and topographer</span>, born at Eton on 4 April 1814, was the son of Edward Williams, a bookseller and publisher in Eton, and his wife, Sarah Turner. He was educated on the foundation at Eton College, being in the first form of the lower school in the election for 1820, and was admitted scholar on 15 September 1829. In 1832 he received the money collected at the traditional Eton montem ceremony as captain of the school, and obtained &pound;957. On 14 July 1832 he was admitted to a scholarship at King's College, Cambridge, and was a fellow from 14 July 1835 to 1870. He graduated BA in 1837 and MA in 1840, was admitted <i>ad eundem</i> at Oxford on 10 June 1847, and proceeded BD at Cambridge in 1849.<br>
<br>In 1837 Williams was ordained, and on 22 September 1838 he was appointed by Eton College to the perpetual curacies of Great Bricet and Wattisham, Suffolk, which he held until Michaelmas 1840. He was appointed by Archbishop Howley to accompany Bishop Alexander as chaplain to Jerusalem, and was in that city from 1841 to May 1843. He then served as chaplain at St Petersburg (1844&#150;5), and it was through holding those posts that he became imbued with the desire of bringing together the Greek and Anglican churches. In 1846 he took up his residence at Cambridge, where he filled the post of dean of arts at his college until 1848, and was dean of divinity from 1848 to 1850. He contributed to the <span class="italic">Christian Remembrancer</span>, <span class="italic">The Ecclesiologist</span>, and <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>.<br>
<br>Williams was appointed warden of St Columba's College at Rathfarnham, near Dublin, in 1850. The college was kept in existence mainly by the liberality of Lord John George de la Poer Beresford, archbishop of Armagh. When, in 1853, Williams joined with Archdeacon Denison, Dr Pusey, and others in protests against the action of Bishop Gobat, the bishop of Jerusalem, for attempting to seduce from their creed the adherents of the Greek church, the archbishop called upon him to resign. An angry correspondence then ensued on the position and principles of Williams, and the archbishop severed his connection with the institution, though Williams retained his post until 1856. From 1854 to 1857 he was vice-provost of King's College, Cambridge, and in 1858 acted as pro-proctor to the university, but he incurred some unpopularity, and his nomination as proctor was rejected by the senate on 1 October 1860, the <i>non-placets</i> being 29 and the <i>placets</i> 26.<br>
<br>In 1858 Williams took temporary charge of Cumbrae College, and was appointed an honorary canon of that institution in 1864. He made &#145;a long and arduous journey in Russia&#146; in 1860, with a view to spreading knowledge of the benefits available for foreign communities at English universities. He printed in that year a French tract on a project to establish at Cambridge &#145;des h&ocirc;telleries en faveur des &eacute;trangers&#146; of the Greek or Armenian churches, but the scheme proved abortive.<br>
<br>After a tour in the East with the marquess of Bute and several years in residence at Cambridge, Williams was presented by his college on 9 February 1869 to the important vicarage of Ringwood in Hampshire. He was Lady Margaret preacher at Cambridge in 1870, and was created honorary canon of Winchester Cathedral in 1874. One of his last deeds was to send his signature to the clerical declaration against war with Russia. He died suddenly at Church Farm, Harbridge, one of the chapelries of Ringwood, on 26 January 1878, and was buried at Harbridge on 1 February. Williams was endowed with a noble presence and dignified voice. A reredos was erected in Ringwood church as a memorial to his memory, and a George Williams prize for distinction in the theological tripos was founded by his friends at Cambridge.<br>
<br>Williams had an extensive knowledge of the topography of Jerusalem which was, in his lifetime, unsurpassed by any English writer. He brought out in 1845 a volume entitled <span class="italic">The Holy City, with Illustrations from Sketches by the Rev. W. F. Witts</span>. For this work he received from the king of Prussia a medal for literary merit. Williams invited Dr Ermete Pierotti to Cambridge, assisted him in preparing his work <span class="italic">Jerusalem Explored</span> for the press, and revised it during printing. The author was accused by James Fergusson and others of plagiarism, and Williams defended him in <span class="italic">Dr Pierotti and his Assailants</span> (1864). He published in 1846 a collection entitled <span class="italic">Sermons Preached at Jerusalem in 1842 and 1843</span>, and supplied the introduction to William Wey's <span class="italic">Itineraries to Jerusalem and Compostella</span> printed for the Roxburghe Club in 1857. His work <span class="italic">The Holy Land: Travels in Palestine from Dan to Beersheba</span>, announced in 1849 as &#145;preparing for publication&#146;, never appeared.<br>
<br>Williams edited in 1868 <span class="italic">The Orthodox Church of the East in the Eighteenth Century</span>, correspondence between the Eastern patriarchs and the non-juring bishops on the reunion of that church and the Anglican communion. He also edited, with a long introduction and an appendix of illustrative documents, for the <span class="roman">Rolls Series</span>, in 1872, two volumes of official correspondence of Bishop Beckington. He was one of the two cataloguers of monastic cartularies for the catalogue of manuscripts at the Cambridge University Library, volume 4, and he described the <span class="roman">Baumgartner Papers</span> in volume 5. Other miscellaneous writings included many articles in Smith's dictionaries of Greek and Roman geography, Christian biography, and Christian antiquities.<br>
