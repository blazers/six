<span class="headword">Mainwaring, Sir  Thomas</span>, first baronet  (1623&#150;1689), <span class="occ">antiquary and local politician</span>, was born in Cheshire on 7 April 1623, the third, and oldest surviving, son of Philip Mainwaring (1589?&#150;1647) of Baddiley and Over Peover and his wife, Ellen (<i>d</i>. 1656), daughter of Edward Minishull of Nantwich, and the great-nephew of Philip Mainwaring (1589&#150;1661), the future secretary to the earl of Strafford. He matriculated on 28 April 1637 from Brasenose College, Oxford, a college favoured by north-western families, and entered Gray's Inn on 15 February 1638 with his elder brother Randle and a Walley cousin. As is evident from his strangely dispassionate diary, begun in 1648, he relied throughout his life on just such an extended circle of kin and friends. From his father, an active county gentleman, who as sheriff in 1639 had to implement unpopular royal policies, and from his contemporaries at the inns, Mainwaring early developed antipathy to Charles I. On 26 May 1642 he married, in Wybunbury, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1671), daughter of Sir Henry Delves of Doddington and a distant cousin; they had five sons and six daughters.<br>
<br>During the civil war Mainwaring's father was a captain of horse in the parliamentary forces, and Mainwaring himself took the covenant while still at Gray's Inn. In 1647, he inherited the family estates, and thereafter divided his time between Baddiley and Over Peover. He was assiduous in local committee work, becoming a JP in 1649, sitting as a commissioner for assessment, the militia, and the regulation of ministers, and serving as sheriff in 1657&#150;8, but kept well clear of the wider political scene. He had lifelong leanings towards Independency, but, while patently mistrusting the Stuarts, as a political and social conservative, he came to dislike even more the godly regime which replaced them. Here he echoed his kinsman George Booth, who seems to have been a mentor as well as a friend, and whose career his own paralleled, if on a lesser scale. He was almost certainly involved in Booth's rising in 1659. Like Booth he sat (for Cheshire) in the Convention Parliament, although he proved an inactive member. After the Restoration he was reappointed to his local offices, nominated to the order of the Royal Oak, and, on 22 November 1660, created baronet.<br>
<br>Like his father, Mainwaring loved books and cultivated learning. Between 1673 and 1679 he and his kinsman Sir Peter Leycester exchanged insults and arguments in print over the illegitimacy of their remote common ancestress, Amicia, daughter of Hugh of Cyfeilog, earl of Chester, alleged in Leycester's <span class="italic">Historical Antiquities</span> (1673) and denied by Mainwaring. Eventually their arguments ranged over much of the social and political life of the twelfth century, and in so doing represented a milestone in historiography. These antagonists&#151;both possessed of legal training, antiquarian zeal, and significant personal muniments&#151;were able to urge each other, and occasionally themselves, to interpret twelfth-century material from the viewpoint of a twelfth-century nobleman, and not as a quaint aberration.<br>
<br>Between 1675 and 1681 Mainwaring served as a deputy lieutenant for Cheshire, but when Charles II moved to purge local government of puritan sympathizers in 1680 Sir Thomas was removed from the commission of the peace. Representations as to his effectiveness and impartiality led to a temporary restoration to the bench, but he was soon deprived again. He and his son John (1656&#150;1702) associated publicly with the duke of Monmouth during the latter's progress through Cheshire in 1682, and after the Rye House plot he was disarmed and bound over at the assizes. Having actively supported John's unsuccessful candidature for a county seat in the 1685 election, Mainwaring was listed as in opposition to James II. On 29 November 1688 he accompanied George Booth's son Henry, Lord Delamere, when he went with a large party to seize arms at Newcastle under Lyme &#145;in Defence of the protestant Religion&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 41805, fol. 234). Within weeks Mainwaring was restored to his deputy lieutenancy.<br>
<br>Mainwaring died at Over Peover in 1689 and was buried there on 28 June in the family vault. Having greatly enhanced the estate bequeathed to him by his father, he left about &pound;25,000. John, his fourth but oldest surviving son, succeeded to the baronetcy and sat as a whig in six parliaments between 1689 and 1701, but was no more an active member than his father. He died in debtors' prison on 4 November 1702.<br>
