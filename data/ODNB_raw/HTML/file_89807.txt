</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hird, Dame  Thora</span>  (1911&#150;2003), <span class="occ">actress and broadcaster</span>, was born on 28 May 1911 at 49 Cheapside, Morecambe, Lancashire, the younger daughter and youngest of three children of James Henry Hird, theatrical manager, and his wife, Mary Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mayor, mezzo-soprano and actress. She described her family life in one of her autobiographies as &#145;one of the happiest in the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">Scene and Hird</span>, 2), and in it were the roots of her self-confidence and of her disinclination to be overawed or bullied by anyone.<br>
<br>Hird's background made a theatrical career seem almost inevitable. She first appeared on stage at the age of eight weeks, when her mother, playing the part of an innocent maid seduced by the young master in a Victorian melodrama, carried her on to the stage of the Royalty Theatre, Morecambe, as proof of his wrongdoing. The family lived in a house adjoining the theatre, which her father managed, and from where she could hear what was happening on the stage, including her mother's performances. At three she learned tap dancing, at four she sang for a concert in aid of injured troops in the First World War, at eight she danced in a George Hall benefit concert (named after a local celebrity), and at fourteen she left school, had walk-on roles at Morecambe Pier Pavilion, and appeared with the John Riddings Opera Company for a season of <span class="italic">The Bohemian Girl</span> on Morecambe Central Pier. Ever practical, when the season's stage work was over, she attended night school four nights a week to study French, cookery, bookkeeping, accounts, English grammar, shorthand, and typing. She became a cashier at Lancaster and District Co-operative Society's branch in Queen's Square, Morecambe, and kept this job for ten years, studying the ways of her customers and determining to use them one day on stage. While the Co-op was still her day job, she built up a theatrical career, beginning with the Morecambe repertory company at the Royalty Theatre. The burning down of Central Pier in 1933, followed by the musical event to open the renovated Winter Gardens, led to her meeting James &#145;Scottie&#146; Scott, a drummer five years her senior, whom she married on 3 May 1937, after a three-year engagement. The son of James Scott, also a musician, her husband became her business manager, house-husband (before the term had been invented), and sometimes the sole carer of their only child, Janette.<br>
<br>Hird's first part in repertory at the Royalty Theatre was in Eden Philpotts's <span class="italic">Yellow Sands</span>. The play was about twins, one dominant, the other little more than an echo of what the other said. Playing the echo, Hird began to show how her flair for attracting human sympathy could make even negative characters compellingly individual. During the Second World War her husband joined the RAF and she became a civilian clerk at the RAF headquarters and billeting office at the local Clarendon Hotel, rehearsing with the repertory company in the lunch hours and appearing on stage in the evenings. In <span class="italic">As You Are</span> she played the sixty-year-old mother-in-law of the heroine. The comedian and ukelele player George Formby was in the audience, and decided he would like her to play the same part in his forthcoming film of the play. She was offered a contract at &pound;10 a week and &pound;10 a day when she worked; she replied that she did not fancy getting paid when she was not working&#151;an unusual, but for her characteristic, objection which was brushed aside with incredulity.<br>
<br>Hird and Formby did not in fact appear together as planned. Instead, in <span class="italic">The Black Sheep of Whitehall</span> (1941), a vehicle of the equally popular comedian Will Hay, she played Hay's secretary. Also in 1941 she appeared with Hay and Michael Redgrave in <span class="italic">The Big Blockade</span>, in which she played a buffet barmaid at a German railway station. She played an ATS girl in <span class="italic">Next of Kin</span>, and a horsey landgirl in <span class="italic">Went the Day Well</span> (both 1942). Her life took on a pattern of films punctuated by repertory theatre work. She made as many as seven films a year, including <span class="italic">The Foreman Went to France</span> (1941), <span class="italic">Two Thousand Women</span> (1944), and <span class="italic">The Courtneys of Curzon Street</span> (1947); and she played Dirk Bogarde's mother in <span class="italic">Once a Jolly Swagman</span> (1948). She made over 100 films altogether. The consistent thread that clearly emerged was her success at portraying idiosyncratic younger women or women older than her real mother. She did this in 1950s films including <span class="italic">The Quatermass Xperiment</span> (1955), <span class="italic">Simon and Laura</span> (1955), and <span class="italic">Sailor Beware!</span> (with Peggy Mount, 1956); in the 1960s she was in John Osborne's <span class="italic">The Entertainer</span> (1960) and <span class="italic">Rattle of a Simple Man</span> (1964).<br>
<br>Hird's stage career also grew steadily rather than sensationally. In 1944 she appeared for the first time on the West End stage as Mrs Gaye in <span class="italic">No Medals</span> at the Vaudeville Theatre, though her first major role did not come until 1948, when she appeared in <span class="italic">Flowers for the Living</span>. In 1949, in the West End, she played Emmie Slee in <span class="italic">The Queen Came By</span>, and in 1960 she played the same part in the BBC television production, with her daughter Janette Scott playing Kitty Tape. Hird did not neglect even more populist ways of reaching a live audience&#151;though in 1966 she was reported to have turned down West End offers to play a thirty-two-week season of twice-nightly shows, <span class="italic">London Laughs</span>, at the London Palladium, appearing with the comics Harry Secombe and Jimmy Tarbuck and the popular pianist Russ Conway.<br>
<br>Though she thrived in the theatre, Hird was remembered most in her own lifetime for the television series in which she starred, especially with the comic actor Freddie Frinton as her husband in <span class="italic">Meet the Wife</span> in the 1960s, but also in <span class="italic">The First Lady</span> (1968&#150;9), in which she played a formidable independent councillor on a northern council controlled by Labour; <span class="italic">In Loving Memory</span> (1969 and 1979&#150;86), in which, as Ivy Unsworth, she ran an undertaking firm with her gormless nephew; <span class="italic">Hallelujah!</span>, in which from 1981 she was a well-intentioned and energetic but often blundering Salvation Army captain; <span class="italic">Last of the Summer Wine</span>, in which from 1986 to 2003 she played Edie Pegden, who remorselessly nags her car mechanic husband Wesley; and the religious series <span class="italic">Your Songs of Praise Choice</span> (1977&#150;83), which became <span class="italic">Praise Be!</span> (1984&#150;93).<br>
<br>Hird's association with four highly individual writers helped give her career added distinction. The first was Walter Greenwood, who had become famous with his play about unemployed Lancashire cotton workers, <span class="italic">Love on the Dole</span> (1933). In the mid-1950s Hird was in his <span class="italic">Saturday Night at the Crown</span>, first at Oldham Rep (1953), then at Blackpool, then on tour. She improvised some of the comedy as she played Ada Thorpe, a woman who was tiddly in the last act. She cut a pork pie in half, dropped the meat from one half on the floor, gave her husband the empty crust, then visibly had second thoughts, picked the meat up from the floor, and put it in his crust. Greenwood wrote <span class="italic">Happy Days</span> (1958) for her, and in the 1970s she appeared in <span class="italic">Saturday Night at the Crown</span> in the Perth festival in Australia, playing Ada for the thousandth time on her second night in Perth.<br>
<br>The second writer to write parts that suited Hird admirably was Alan Bennett, also from northern England. She starred on television in Bennett's <span class="italic">Me, I'm Afraid of Virginia Woolf</span> (1978), and in his <span class="italic">Intensive Care</span> (1982). When the BBC presented a Bennett series of monologues entitled <span class="italic">Talking Heads</span> she starred in &#145;Cream Cracker under the Settee&#146; as an old woman resisting plans to put her in a home who falls, sits staring under the sofa, and finds the cracker which she sees as gratifying proof of the inefficiency of her cleaner. This won her the BAFTA best actress award in 1988, her first BAFTA award. For Bennett's second <span class="italic">Talking Heads</span> series in 1998 she again won the BAFTA best actress award for &#145;Waiting for the Telegram&#146;, in which a 94-year-old woman bitterly and ramblingly regrets evading sleeping with her boyfriend on the night before he goes off to die in the First World War.<br>
<br>The third writer to favour Hird's homely but far from passive playing was Deric Longden, who wrote an autobiographical play about his first wife, Diana, produced for television as <span class="italic">Wide-eyed and Legless</span> (1993). Hird later appeared in Longden's <span class="italic">Lost for Words</span> (1999) playing his mother, who dies after three strokes. For this she yet again won the BAFTA best actress of the year award and collected an American International Emmy award for best drama for the production's team&#151;while in the wheelchair she sometimes used by then because of her painful arthritis.<br>
<br>The fourth writer who found Hird an elegant interpreter was Victoria Wood. In 1994, in Wood's <span class="italic">Pat and Margaret</span>, Hird was a northern woman busy dominating her son and daughter-in-law. With Eric Sykes and Dora Bryan, she played a cameo role in Wood's <span class="italic">Dinnerladies</span> (1999), as one of the whacky parents of the main characters.<br>
<br>Hird's health declined in later years, and she underwent two double hip replacements, but this did not prevent her completing seventeen years with <span class="italic">Songs of Praise Choice</span> and <span class="italic">Praise Be!</span> It was <span class="italic">Praise Be!</span> that best summed up the woman she was: she often said that she supposed she had been a Christian since she was small, but had not realized it until later. For 15 million viewers, every Sunday, she interviewed people about their religious beliefs as well as presenting her favourite hymns and those of viewers. She aimed to be genuinely nice to everyone, and was appreciated both by the public and the establishment. She was appointed OBE in 1983, was made an honorary DLitt by Lancaster University in 1989, and was made a dame in 1993. Her other awards included the Pye female comedy star award (1984), the Royal Variety Club's award for outstanding contribution to the world of entertainment, the British Comedy lifetime achievement award (1998), the Help the Aged award, and the Woman of the Year award. She was the first woman member of the Royal Television Society's hall of fame (1993). In 1999 a newspaper poll dubbed her the second most popular person living, after the queen mother. None of this adulation blunted her sharp eye for the business in hand, whether for radio, television, charities, Christianity, or her daughter Janette or her grandchildren. Even in her eighties she regularly visited the Star and Garter Home at Richmond to see some of those disabled in war; she helped many other charities, and founded the Thora Hird Charitable Trust. She wrote three volumes of autobiography, <span class="italic">Scene and Hird</span> (1976), <span class="italic">Is It Thora?</span> (1996), and <span class="italic">Not In the Diary</span> (2000). Her other books were <span class="italic">Thora Hird's &#145;Praise Be!&#146; Notebook</span> (1990), <span class="italic">Thora Hird's &#145;Praise Be!&#146; Year Book</span> and <span class="italic">Thora Hird's &#145;Praise Be!&#146; Christmas Book</span> (both 1991), <span class="italic">Thora Hird's &#145;Praise Be!&#146; Prayer Book</span> (1992), and <span class="italic">Praise Be! I Believe</span> (1993).<br>
<br>Hird died at Brinsworth House retirement home, Staines Road, Twickenham, Middlesex, on 15 March 2003 after a stroke, a uniquely formidable but disarming show business phenomenon whose death caused many of her fans at all social levels to experience not a remote but a highly personal awareness of loss. She was survived by her daughter, Janette, her husband having predeceased her in 1994.<br>
