<span class="headword">Evans,  John</span>  (1784&#150;1831), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and writer</span>, was born in Bristol and educated there by John Prior Estlin, a Unitarian minister and schoolmaster. He married Lucy, daughter of Bernard Hickason, a Bristol custom house officer, in or after 1807. He kept a school in Bristol from about 1809 to about 1825 at various addresses in Clifton, except for a short period around 1816 when his school was at 1 Somerset Street, Kingsdown. From 1816 to 1820 he was also minister of the Presbyterian congregation at the Old Meeting-House, Marshfield, and for a shorter time at the Grove Meeting, Bradford-on-Avon, where Presbyterians had adopted Unitarian views. He moved to Bath and then to London, where he had a school in Drummond Street, Euston Square. He died in London in December 1831 and was survived by his wife. Besides some schoolbooks Evans wrote <span class="italic">An Oration on the Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity</span> (1809) and <span class="italic">The Ponderer</span> (1812), a series of essays originally published in the <span class="italic">Bristol Mercury</span>. More important are his topographical works, including <span class="italic">The Picture of Bristol &hellip; Including Biographical Notices of Eminent Natives</span> (1814), which appeared in various forms and editions, and the second volume of <span class="italic">The History of Bristol</span> (1816), the first volume having been written by John Corry. This last work was soon eclipsed by Samuel Seyer's history of the city (1821&#150;3) and was criticized for being very largely drawn from the works of William Barrett (1733&#150;1789). Evans also edited, with a memoir, the <span class="italic">Remains</span> (1815) of William Reed of Thornbury.<br>
<br>Evans is to be distinguished from <a name="cosubject_8965"></a><span class="headword">John Evans</span>  (<em>b. </em>1767/8, <em>d.</em> in or after 1812), who was also a <span class="occ">schoolmaster, topographer</span>, and sometime resident of Bristol. He was the son of Benjamin Evans of Lydney, Gloucestershire. He matriculated on 4 April 1789, aged twenty-one, at Jesus College, Oxford, and graduated BA in 1792. He kept a boarding-school at Colston's Parade, Bristol, and in 1807 at Winterbourne Court, near Bristol. He was the author of <span class="italic">A Tour through Part of North Wales</span> (1800) and <span class="italic">Letters Written during a Tour through South Wales</span> (1804). He also wrote volume 12, on <span class="italic">North Wales</span>, and contributed to volume 11 of <span class="italic">The Beauties of England and Wales</span>, compiled by E. W. Brayley and J. Britton. At the time of his last publication, in April 1812, Evans was residing at Delancy Place, Camden Town, London. He had intended to write the account of south Wales for the <span class="italic">Beauties</span>, but died shortly after the completion of the first part of the undertaking.<br>
<br>These two John Evanses must further be distinguished from their namesake the Bristol writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8967/', "John Evans (bap. 1774, d. 1828)")</script>.<br>
