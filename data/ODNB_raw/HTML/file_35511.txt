<span class="headword">Phillimore,  Walter George Frank</span>, first Baron Phillimore  (1845&#150;1929), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born in London on 21 November 1845, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22138/', "Sir Robert Joseph Phillimore, first baronet (1810&#150;1885)")</script>, one of the last judges of the high court of Admiralty, and Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 19 January 1892), third daughter of John Denison, of Ossington Hall, Nottinghamshire, whose brothers included John Evelyn Denison, Viscount Ossington, speaker of the House of Commons, and Edward Denison, bishop of Salisbury. His grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22137/', "Joseph Phillimore")</script>, regius professor of civil law at Oxford University, and first cousin of John Swinnerton Phillimore, professor of Greek at the University of Glasgow. Phillimore was educated at Westminster School, where he became captain of the school and won a studentship to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1863. He obtained first classes in classical moderations in 1865, in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1866, and in law and modern history in 1867. He was secretary and treasurer of the union. In the interval between the last two degree examinations he was elected to a fellowship at All Souls College. In 1868 he won the Vinerian law scholarship. He entered the Middle Temple, was called to the bar in 1868, and joined the western circuit. In 1870 he married Agnes (<i>d</i>. 1929), daughter of Charles Manners Lushington, MP for Canterbury; they had four sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Phillimore was counsel in many famous ecclesiastical cases during a period of animosity between evangelical and Anglo-Catholic factions within the Church of England. Among the most famous were <i>Boyd v. Philpotts</i> (the Exeter reredos case, 1874) and <i>Reed v. Bishop of Lincoln</i> (1891) in the court of the archbishop of Canterbury. He was also counsel in other cases involving controversy over ritualism, such as the use of lighted candles on the communion table, the wearing of Catholic-style ecclesiastical vestments, the eastward position during the prayer of consecration, the singing of the <span class="roman">Agnus Dei</span>, and sculptural representations of the transfiguration and ascension on a church reredos. In 1872 Phillimore became chancellor of the diocese of Lincoln. He held that a nonconformist minister was not entitled to describe himself by the title of &#145;Reverend&#146; on the tombstone erected to his daughter (<i>Keet v. Smith</i>, 1876). The decision was upheld by his father, Sir Robert Phillimore, but reversed by the privy council.<br>
<br>Phillimore never became queen's counsel, but in December 1883 a patent of precedence was conferred upon him which gave him the same privileges as a QC. In 1885 he succeeded to his father's baronetcy. Apart from ecclesiastical cases he appeared almost entirely in the Admiralty court, and for many years was its acknowledged leader. As a politician Phillimore was not successful. An admirer of W. E. Gladstone and the Liberal Party, he contested St George's, Hanover Square, in 1885, and the Henley division of Oxfordshire in 1886 and again in 1902, but without success.<br>
<br>Phillimore seldom appeared in common-law courts, so there was some surprise when, in December 1897, he was appointed a judge of the Queen's Bench Division. He remained a judge of first instance for sixteen years. His lack of experience of criminal law led to considerable criticism of him when he presided at assizes. His sentences were thought too severe, especially in sexual cases, though he mellowed with time. In civil cases at <i>nisi prius</i> before a jury he tended to interrupt cross-examination of counsel. He was more at home as the single judge and excelled in interpreting confusing and apparently conflicting acts of parliament, although here too he could be rather pedantic. His decision on facts was not so sound as his determination of the law, where he drew on his classical training to express his judgments concisely and lucidly. His versatility was acknowledged when he was appointed to administer the bankruptcy jurisdiction of the King's Bench. He was a rapid judge and no time was wasted in his court. He had the unusual gift of being ambidextrous, and took notes of evidence with either hand. Though he was never a great judge, his abilities improved with time and the benefit of experience. He was an alderman of the borough of Kensington, where he lived, and mayor from 1909 to 1911.<br>
<br>In 1913 Phillimore was made a lord justice of appeal and admitted to the privy council. Again, the appointment was a surprise, but it was justified by results. The Court of Appeal benefited greatly during the First World War from Phillimore's expertise in international law. He was party to the judgment in the <i>Continental Tyre Company v. Daimler Company</i> (1915), concerning the status of an English company controlled by Germans resident in Germany. He helped decide <i>R. v. Speyer</i> (1916) as to whether naturalized British subjects were eligible for membership of the privy council. His judgment in <i>Beal v. Horlock</i> (1915) on the effect under the <span class="roman">Merchant Shipping Act</span> of the detention of a British ship in a German port at the outbreak of war was subsequently affirmed in the House of Lords.<br>
<br>Phillimore retired from the bench in 1916, and in 1918 was raised to the peerage under the title Baron Phillimore of Shiplake, in Oxfordshire. He regularly heard cases in the House of Lords and the privy council over the next ten years. He had a good deal of knowledge of Roman and canon law and showed a great ability to deal with other codes and new problems, as was seen in his treatment of Burmese, Hindu, and Islamic law in the judicial committee. By the <span class="roman">Naval Prize Act</span> of 1918 he was appointed chairman of the naval prize tribunal. His career as a lord justice and in the highest courts showed him to be one of the best lawyers of his generation.<br>
<br>As an international jurist, Phillimore acquired a European reputation. He was a regular attender at the meetings of the International Law Association at Grenoble, Stockholm, Vienna, and Warsaw. He was president of the association in 1919&#150;20. At the request of the then foreign secretary, he had been appointed in 1917 and 1918 chairman of a committee to consider early schemes for the League of Nations. His report was sent to the cabinet, taken up by General Smuts, and communicated to President Woodrow Wilson. The president deputed Colonel E. M. House to use Phillimore's draft, thus linking the British empire with the institution of the league. In 1917 Phillimore published <span class="italic">Three Centuries of Treaties of Peace and their Teaching</span>, and in 1920 was a member of the committee which drew up the statute constituting the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague.<br>
<br>Phillimore found time for many outside activities. He was an active governor of his old school, Westminster, from 1885 until his death, and he took a prominent part in the affairs of the Middle Temple, being reader (1898) and treasurer (1907). He joined the English Church Union in 1865 and was president in 1919. For many years he was treasurer of Pusey House, Oxford, and after his retirement from the Court of Appeal he took part in the sessions of the church assembly, especially in the controversial revision of the prayer book (1927&#150;8). He was one of the chief authors of the scheme for clergy pensions.<br>
<br>In the House of Lords, Phillimore's speeches were not eloquent, but he took a large share in the debates upon the <span class="roman">Legitimacy Bill</span> (1926) and the <span class="roman">Guardianship of Infants Bill</span> (1925). He had strongly held though rather narrow views, which were, however, advanced with courtesy and consideration for the opinions of others.<br>
<br>Phillimore was responsible for the second edition of his father's <span class="italic">Ecclesiastical Law of the Church of England</span> (2 vols., 1895), for the third edition of the fourth volume of his father's <span class="italic">Commentaries upon International Law</span> (1889), and for many editions (1872&#150;1905) of J. H. Blunt's <span class="italic">Book of Church Law</span>.<br>
<br>To the end Phillimore retained his youthful appearance, and quick and incisive manner of speech and walk. He died at his home, Cam House, Campden Hill, in Kensington, on 13 March 1929, two months after the death of his devoted wife of sixty years, and was buried five days later in Shiplake church. Phillimore was succeeded as second baron by his third son, Godfrey Walter (<i>b</i>. 1879).<br>
