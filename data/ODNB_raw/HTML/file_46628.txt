<span class="headword">Bettmann,  Siegfried</span>  (1863&#150;1951), <span class="occ">cycle and motor vehicle manufacturer</span>, was born on 18 April 1863 at Nuremberg, Bavaria, youngest of the eleven children of Mayer Bettmann and his third wife, Sophie Weil. Educated in Germany, he taught himself the linguistic skills which enabled him to take up clerical posts throughout Europe. In London he befriended Maurice Schulte, a fellow Nuremberger and trained engineer, later his business partner.<br>
<br>On the continent Bettmann noticed that bicycles were appearing, and determined to exploit the new market. He established a London office and arranged for two Coventry firms to supply bicycles which were to carry Bettmann's own logo, Triumph, a name chosen because it sounded sufficiently English and superior to attract continental buyers. His company, S. Bettmann &amp; Co., struggled at first and did not start to prosper until Schulte joined in November 1886. Schulte found a manufacturing base at Much Park Street, Coventry. Shortage of capital almost killed the venture, but a coterie of wealthy directors was assembled and the firm soon moved into a modern factory in Priory Street, Coventry, the financing being arranged by Bettmann. He contributed nothing to the design and manufacturing side, which was Schulte's province. Bettmann's role lay in marketing, in which capacity he travelled widely.<br>
<br>The New Triumph Cycle Company was successfully floated in May 1895 and the following three boom years saw Triumph's profits rise into six figures, persuading Bettmann to refloat the company at a grossly inflated capital of &pound;130,000 which involved heavy debenture liabilities. A stormy period followed as the cycle boom petered out, until the motorcycle provided a product with which to forge a recovery. Bettmann claimed the credit for this inspirational move, though the fact that Schulte test-rode a German motorcycle suggests his role was greater than his jealous partner would admit to. Whatever the provenance of the Triumph motorcycle, its appearance in 1902 was a turning point for the company. Until the Triumph Trusty of 1904, motorcycles were notoriously unreliable. The design was Schulte's, with Bettmann's role being to seek orders from dealers and public bodies. By 1909 annual production at the Priory Street works had reached 3000.<br>
<br>On the Thursday before Britain entered the First World War in August 1914, the War Office asked Bettmann to organize a meeting of motorcycle manufacturers. They were informed that an expeditionary force would be sent to Belgium, and that motorcycles were required for dispatch riders. Shortly afterwards Bettmann received a request for one hundred, the first of many orders. The Model H, introduced in 1915, proved so reliable that 30,000 were ordered by the army during the conflict, a greater quantity than that ordered from any other motorcycle manufacturer.<br>
<br>In 1919 Bettmann, incensed at Schulte's desire to end bicycle production, engineered his removal. Schulte's departure was soon felt; the Model P motorcycle, launched in 1924, was a commercial disaster and soured Triumph's trustworthy reputation. At Bettmann's behest, the company moved uncertainly into motor car manufacture under the guidance of Captain Claude Holbrook. The Super Seven, a more sophisticated rival to the Austin Seven was produced by the Triumph Motor Company in the premises of a failed marque in Clay Lane, Coventry. Healthy export sales underpinned its success until the depression of the 1930s, which also adversely affected motorcycle sales. This time, the sale of the bicycle division could not be averted. Nor did Bettmann get his way over staying with light cars rather than moving into sports car production, and he resigned as managing director on 18 April 1933. He remained bitter about the turn of events, but his attempts to wallow in nostalgia by buying the rights to manufacture Triumph bicycles in 1936 proved unsuccessful.<br>
<br>Although he became a British citizen in 1895, Bettmann remained an outsider. In September 1914, anti-German hysteria led to his resignation as mayor of Coventry. After dallying with the Labour Party, Bettmann returned to the Liberal fold, serving as president of the Coventry Liberal Association (1937&#150;40). In 1895 Bettmann married Annie Mayrick, a tradesman's daughter. The marriage was childless, and his wife was seriously ill from 1916 until her death in 1941. In 1920 Bettmann established the Annie Bettmann Foundation, a school for young business people. He died at his home, Elm Bank, Stoke Park, near Coventry on 23 September 1951.<br>
