<span class="headword">Carnegie,  James</span>, sixth earl of Southesk  (1827&#150;1905), <span class="occ">poet and antiquary</span>, was born at Edinburgh on 16 November 1827, the eldest son of the three sons and two daughters of Sir James Carnegie (1799&#150;1849), of Pittarow, fifth baronet, and his wife, Charlotte (1800&#150;1848), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17296/', "Daniel Lysons (1762&#150;1834)")</script> of Hempstead Court, Gloucester. The father, who was fifth in descent from Alexander, fourth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4717/', "David Carnegie, first earl of Southesk")</script>, laid claim without success to the family earldom which had been forfeited in 1715 on the attainder of James Carnegie, fifth earl, for his share in the Jacobite rising of that year.<br>
<br>Educated at Edinburgh Academy and at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, James Carnegie was commissioned in the Gordon Highlanders in 1845, was transferred in 1846 to the Grenadier Guards, and retired on succeeding his father as sixth baronet in 1849. On 19 June of that year he married Lady Catherine Hamilton (<i>d</i>. 1855), second daughter of Charles Noel, first earl of Gainsborough. They had one son, Charles Noel, who was to succeed as seventh earl of Southesk, and three daughters. By 1854 Carnegie had restored the family residence, Kinnaird Castle at Brechin, and began collecting antique gems, books, old master paintings, and a large assortment of mid-eastern cylinders. He also disposed of much of the extensive family property, selling his estate of Glendye to Sir Thomas Gladstone of Fasque, baronet, brother of the prime minister. Renewing his father's claim to the earldom of Southesk in 1855, he obtained on 2 July an act of parliament reversing the attainder of 1715, and was confirmed in the title by the House of Lords on 24 July. In 1869, on Gladstone's recommendation, he was made a knight of the Thistle, and on 7 December of the same year a peer of the United Kingdom, with the title Baron Balinhard of Farnell.<br>
<br>Southesk's wife died in 1855, and in 1859, for health reasons, he went on a long hunting expedition in western Canada. On his return in 1860 he married, on 29 November, Lady Susan Catherine Mary Murray, daughter of Alexander Edward, sixth earl of Dunmore, with whom he was to have three sons and four daughters. Also in 1860 he was made a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, but the diary of his Canadian travels, <span class="italic">Saskatchewan and the Rocky Mountains</span>, was not published until 1875. The work records his travel and sporting adventures and has some interesting plates, maps, and illustrations.<br>
<br>However, Carnegie's chief writing interests were literary. He had published <span class="italic">Herminius, a Romance</span> in 1862 and an essay, &#145;Britain's art paradise&#146; (on the Royal Academy exhibition of 1871). In 1875 he published anonymously <span class="italic">Jonas Fisher: a Poem in Brown and White</span>, which caused some controversy. In a hostile review in <span class="italic">The Examiner</span>, the book was incorrectly ascribed to Robert Buchanan, who successfully sued the editor of the journal, Peter A. Taylor, for libel. This title, and those which followed, were minor poetic works. Rhys described Carnegie as having a &#145;certain mystic tendency&#146;  (Rhys, 345) and this attraction to fantasy and the occult is reflected in the titles of some of his publications: <span class="italic">Lurida lumina</span> (1876), <span class="italic">Greenwood's Farewell</span> (1876), <span class="italic">The Meda Maiden</span> (1877), <span class="italic">The Burial of Isis</span> (1844), and <span class="italic">Suomira, a Fantasy</span>, which was printed privately in 1899.<br>
<br>In later years Carnegie's interest in the recondite found a more productive outlet in his antiquarian and archaeological research, particularly in Pictish stones and symbols. A distinguished member of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, he read several papers, some of which were later published: &#145;The Newton stone&#146; (1884), &#145;The ogham inscriptions of Scotland&#146; (1885), and &#145;The origins of Pictish symbolism&#146; (1893).<br>
<br>Carnegie was made an honorary LLD of St Andrews in 1872, and of Aberdeen University in 1875. He died at Kinnaird Castle on 21 February 1905.<br>
