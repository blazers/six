<span class="headword">Hobson,  Paul</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1666), <span class="occ">Particular Baptist preacher</span>, was a tailor from Buckinghamshire according to the heresiographer Thomas Edwards. An opponent of the solemn league and covenant in 1643, Hobson had probably by this time joined the London separatist church founded by John Spencer and John Green in 1639. By 1644 Hobson had organized a Particular Baptist church; in 1644 and 1646 he and Thomas Gower, on behalf of their congregation, signed the Particular Baptists' confession of faith articulating their Calvinist and separatist tenets and their belief in believers' baptism by immersion. Hobson's tenets prompted the presbyterian Sion College to condemn him along with Milton, Roger Williams, John Biddle, and other radicals in December 1644. Hobson was now serving as a captain in Charles Fleetwood's regiment in the eastern association army. When Lawrence Clarkson heard him preach, Hobson &#145;brake forth with such expressions of the in-comes and out-goes of God, that my soul much desired such a gift of preaching&#146;  (L. Clarkson, <span class="italic">The Lost Sheep Found</span>, 1660, 10). In 1645 Hobson published three works, a collection of sermons entitled <span class="italic">Christ the Effect not the Cause of the Love of God</span>, <span class="italic">A Discoverie of Truth</span>, and <span class="italic">The Fallacy of Infants Baptisme Discovered</span>, which had been written for a debate, subsequently banned by the lord mayor, between various Baptists and the presbyterian Edmund Calamy. Opponents such as Edwards and Richard Baxter denounced Hobson as an antinomian. In June 1645 Sir Samuel Luke had captains Hobson and Richard Beaumont, who were travelling on a pass from Fleetwood, arrested at Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, for preaching contrary to the Westminster assembly regulations. Luke sent them to Sir Thomas Fairfax in Leicester, where they complained that Luke's officers had maltreated them. Praising Hobson's and Beaumont's military service, Fairfax had Luke's officers cashiered. Fleetwood too defended the captains and protested about their uncivil treatment. Infuriated by their return to Newport, Luke complained to the MP Richard Knightley, but a parliamentary committee released Hobson after examining him in London. Until he received orders in August to go to Leicester, Hobson preached in London. Thereafter he was ordered to Bristol, which Fleetwood's troops helped capture and garrison. Here too Hobson preached. After a farewell sermon to the army in June 1646, he went to Exeter to raise support for the godly cause. He published <span class="italic">Practicall Divinity</span> (1646), an exposition about the Christian life, and <span class="italic">A Garden Inclosed</span> (1647), articulating an almost mystical experience.<br>
<br>Hobson returned to the army in 1647 as a major in Robert Lilburne's infantry regiment. As an army agent he met the royalist Sir Lewis Dyve, who gave him an introduction to Charles in search of a negotiated settlement. In the autumn Dyve told Charles that John Lilburne deemed Hobson &#145;the fittest man to be employed&#146; by the king to strike an agreement with army dissidents such as Edward Sexby  (&#145;Letter-book&#146;, 92), but when troops in Robert Lilburne's regiment mutinied at Ware in November, Hobson joined other officers in denouncing the rebels. By July 1648 Hobson was in Newcastle upon Tyne, where his troops were quartered on the residents, raising fears of an uprising. At Newcastle he served as deputy governor to Sir Arthur Hesilrige. After signing a letter supporting the Leveller petition of 11 September condemning negotiations with Charles, on 9 October he endorsed <span class="italic">The Declaration of the Armie</span> to Fairfax, denouncing the Newport talks with the king. Promoted lieutenant-colonel by October 1648, he was appointed an assessment commissioner for Durham and Newcastle in December 1649, November 1650, and (for Durham only) December 1652. His prominence prompted a conservative attack in 1649 entitled <span class="italic">Newes from Powles</span>, alleging his troops had baptized a colt in St Paul's Cathedral, London. At Newcastle he became embroiled in controversy when he exposed a Scottish witchpricker commissioned by the common council as a fraud. In January 1650 he quashed a minor rebellion by cavaliers and moss-troopers. During the spring he lamented the distrust between the &#145;honest&#146; parties in England and Scotland, which may explain the council of state's suspicion in July that he was prepared to serve Scottish interests and was thus unfit to be deputy governor. Nevertheless, during the ensuing Scottish campaign Cromwell put him in charge of four garrisons at Leith, and he was responsible for conveying Scottish prisoners from Dunbar to Durham. An estimated 1600 died <i>en route</i>, and comparable numbers perished in Durham owing to inadequate food. Some time after this, Hobson resigned from the army.<br>
<br>Hobson now focused on religious activities, especially in Newcastle, where he and Gower had founded a Baptist church about 1649. In February 1653 he was appointed a commissioner for propagating the gospel in the north. He welcomed the nominated assembly as an indication of the imminence of Christ's earthly kingdom, signing a congratulatory address to Cromwell from the people of co. Durham on 28 April 1653. After the assembly's dissolution, he called for the excommunication of church members who signed addresses of loyalty to Cromwell. He was involved in religious controversies, including one with Hexham Baptists in 1653 over the belief that ministers should not be wholly dependent on their churches for financial support; the following year Thomas Tillam and the Hexham Baptists accused Hobson of fomenting dissension. The General Baptist Henry Haggar accused Hobson of being out of communion with other Baptists. Hobson's attack on the Arminian doctrine of a limited atonement, <span class="italic">Fourteen Queries and Ten Absurdities</span> (1655), provoked a response from William Pedelsden, <span class="italic">Sound Doctrine</span> (1657), and Tillam's <span class="italic">The Fourth Principle of Christian Religion</span> (1655) criticized Hobson's opposition to the laying on of hands. Hobson also battled with the Quakers, who converted six of his followers. On a preaching foray in Wiltshire about 1655 he denounced Quaker tenets, prompting John Story and John Wilkinson to complain that he said &#145;many filthye things to render the truth odyouse&#146;  (Swarthmore papers, 1, fol. 35<i>r</i>). In <span class="italic">The Quaker's Jesus</span> (1658) William Grigge unconvincingly associated Hobson with Socinians. From 1654 until his ejection in 1660 Hobson served as chaplain of Eton College, and about 1657 he was a visitor of Durham College. Appointed a militia commissioner for Durham in July 1659, he subsequently supported Lambert's efforts to prevent the restoration of monarchy.<br>
<br>On settling in London in 1660, Hobson joined William Kiffin's church. With Tillam and Christopher Pooley he established a godly community for several hundred families from the Durham area on former monastic lands in the palatinate, and while abroad he preached to congregationalists in Rotterdam. On his return to London, he apparently associated with Nathaniel Strange, but he was in Durham by August 1661, when Bishop Cosin arrested and briefly imprisoned him owing to suspicions about his German project. To avoid interrogation by deputy lieutenants in November Hobson fled to London, where he was briefly detained in the spring. Suspected of complicity with the Tong plotters, he was rearrested in November 1662, but released on a &pound;1000 bond. By this time he was practising medicine at Bishopsgate, London. The following year, Hobson, alias Dr Love, participated in the conspiracy that culminated in the northern rebellion in October. Hobson was arrested on 20 August. According to a fellow conspirator, Robert Atkinson, Hobson informed on his compatriots, though continuing to urge them to act, partly by ambushing Buckingham's troops as they marched north in August (a plan the conspirators were unable to implement). Accused of treason, Hobson was incarcerated in the Tower, moved to Chepstow Castle in March 1664, and then back again in January 1665. Suffering from ill health, he repeatedly sought permission to go to Jamaica. He was finally released on 28 April 1665 on condition that he move to Carolina, though he never went. His final work, <span class="italic">Innocency, though under a Cloud, Cleared</span> (1664), was an apologia. After his release he was accused of sexual misconduct with two female members of the Devonshire Square Baptist Church. His will, in which he described himself as a barber&#150;surgeon, was dated on 12 March 1664 and proved on 13 June 1666. He expected his wife, Hester, and his children, Paul, Lydia, Sara, and Reubenah, to settle on his property at Sacriston, Durham; a fourth daughter, Hester, was married to Henry Woolfe. One of the leading Baptists in the north-east, Hobson was a tireless promoter of godly government and society.<br>
