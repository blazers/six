<span class="headword">McIntosh,  Hugh</span>  (1768&#150;1840), <span class="occ">civil engineering contractor</span>, was born on 4 December 1768 at Milntown of Kildrummie, Nairn, the second son of David McIntosh (<i>c</i>.1730&#150;1790) and Margaret Tolmie. The family had an agricultural background. After a brief education at Inverness he went south in search of work with the canal contractor Alexander Mackenzie (1769&#150;1836). His career began as a navvy on the Forth and Clyde Canal, then in its final stage of construction under Robert Whitworth. The first contracts which McIntosh took in his own name were on the Lancaster Canal, where the engineer was John Rennie.<br>
<br>In 1797 McIntosh began work on a succession of contracts on the Grand Trunk Canal system. On 10 December 1798 he married Mary (1773&#150;1833), the daughter of William Cross (1744&#150;1827), an agent of the canal company, at Cheddleton, Staffordshire. Here, where their home was a contractor's hut, their only surviving child, David (1799&#150;1856), was born. In 1803 they moved to Poplar to enable McIntosh directly to supervise the massive East India Dock excavations. Within ten years he had built up a national organization and his prosperity led to the opening of an office in Bloomsbury. His son attended Glasgow University, from 1814 to 1817, before starting to work for his father on the Edinburgh and Glasgow Union Canal.<br>
<br>McIntosh's contracts are too numerous to detail. While the Grand Trunk Canal works were in progress he took other contracts on the Kennet and Avon, Croydon, Thames and Medway, and Regent's canals. With his son he took contracts on the Great Western, Thames and Severn, and Gloucester and Berkeley canals, and on Sharpness docks. He remained a canal contractor throughout his career; among his final works were contracts on the Aire and Calder Navigation and the Grand Junction Canal. Meanwhile, he was heavily involved in the construction of new docks and their associated roads in London, carrying out works for almost all the docks companies. Other road contracts included Highgate Archway and Vauxhall Bridge Road in London and turnpikes near Manchester and Brighton. He became an important contractor for gas and waterworks companies in the London and Bristol areas, and laid sewers around London.<br>
<br>McIntosh's ability was rewarded by substantial government contracts. In addition to enormous works at Pembroke, Plymouth, and Portsmouth dockyards, he built the North Hyde Canal and mounds. He carried out much work for the royal parks and palaces. He was the contractor at Chetney Hill lazaretto near Sheerness. He was also possibly the first British contractor to work overseas when he undertook demolition work at Flushing for Lord Liverpool. He carried out harbour works at Shoreham, Whitstable, Dover, Hull, and Southampton, and various sea defence works, most notably at Dymchurch.<br>
<br>McIntosh built bridges at Harmondsworth, Brentford, and Northampton, widened Clopton Bridge, Stratford upon Avon, and repaired Rochester Bridge. He was contractor for Telford's Mythe Bridge near Tewkesbury, and he built floating bridges over the Itchen and at Portsmouth. In 1821 he gave evidence to the House of Commons on London Bridge, and he carried out site investigations for the new bridge; his son provided evidence on the new bridge's stability in 1831 and also repaired Blackfriars Bridge (1834&#150;42).<br>
<br>McIntosh embraced the opportunities offered by the railway boom of the 1830s, and built the London to Greenwich railway. His son was responsible for extensive works on the London and South Western and Midland Counties railways, Dutton Viaduct on the Grand Junction, and smaller contracts on the Northern and Eastern, and Birmingham and Derby Junction railways, and together they also took eight contracts on the Great Western Railway. Their claims for payment were turned down by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, who refused to settle McIntosh's account until David McIntosh's accounts were submitted, and refused also McIntosh senior's demand for an independent arbitrator. One factor was probably the precarious finances of the railway company at the time, and it emerged that Brunel had never properly certified the work actually carried out by the contractors, concealing its true cost. Their claims were pursued through chancery and finally settled in their favour in 1866. McIntosh suffered an eye infection while working on the Gloucester and Berkeley Canal in 1826, and this resulted in blindness. This may in part explain why many of the later contracts, particularly the railway contracts, were taken in his son's name, although McIntosh remained active until his death and kept a tight control on site visits by asking detailed questions.<br>
<br>McIntosh was one of the key individuals in developing the British civil engineering industry. He relied on his family, chiefly his brother James and his own son, to manage his works, but many famous contractors worked under him&#151;the Airds, the Betts, the Ross and Radford families, William Henderson, James Leishman, and William Mackenzie. They enabled McIntosh to establish himself as the first contractor with a nationwide organization. McIntosh died of apoplexy on 31 August 1840, while meeting his agents for his contracts on the North Midland Railway and Manchester and Leeds line, at the Strafford Arms Hotel, Wakefield. He was buried in the family vault at St Matthias Church, Poplar. He left a considerable fortune of &pound;300,000, more than any civil engineer to that date, and had acquired numerous properties in the East End of London and Essex.<br>
