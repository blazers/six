<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Deverell,  Walter Howell</span>  (1827&#150;1854), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born in Charlottesville, Virginia, USA, on 1 October 1827, the eldest child in the family of five sons and three daughters of Walter Ruding Deverell (1800&#150;1853), originally from Lincolnshire, and his wife, Dorothy Margaretta, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Phillips (1799&#150;1850). After marrying in London in 1824, his parents had travelled to America with his father's former teacher of German, Dr George Blaetterman, who had been engaged as a professor of modern languages at Thomas Jefferson's newly founded University of Virginia. Walter Deverell senior enrolled at the university in 1825 and in 1826 ran a school for boys near Charlottesville. By 1829 the family had returned to England where, at St Clement Danes, Westminster, on 18 August 1829, Walter Howell Deverell was baptized, along with his sister Margaretta (<i>b</i>. 1829). His father's peripatetic career led them to Dublin in 1833; London in 1835, where his father was assistant secretary of the Statistical Society; and then, in February 1841, to Perth, where Deverell senior was assigned to the office of governor of the general prison, a post from which he was removed. While in Scotland, in addition to the educational guidance of his father, the young Walter, then aged about fourteen, went to a private tutor who &#145;initiated me into the mysteries of Greek participles and Latin verbs&#146;  (Memoir).<br>
<br>In February 1843 Deverell's father became assistant secretary (and, for a time, curator) at the Government School of Design in London. The accommodation at Somerset House provided with the job situated him and his large family of eight children in a building that had been the home of the Royal Academy of Arts until its move to Trafalgar Square in 1837. Deverell's father had plans for his son to train as a solicitor, but eventually he acquiesced in his son's wish to study art. In 1844 Deverell registered at the National Gallery as an art student; in 1845 he joined Henry Sass's academy (then run by F. S. Cary) to learn drawing techniques, while also attending life classes in the evenings.<br>
<br>At Sass's Deverell befriended the charismatic Gabriel Rossetti with whom he shared an interest in painting and writing poetry. In July 1845 Deverell was admitted as a probationer at the Royal Academy Schools, before becoming a full student in December 1846. Here, with Rossetti, he joined with William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais to revive a sketching club, known as the Cyclographic Society, with which he had earlier been involved. Deverell inevitably had close links to the school of design: John Rogers Herbert taught him and Richard Burchett was a friend and later superior. By the time the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood formed in September 1848, Deverell was employed as one of the assistant masters at the school of design, a job his father would have had a hand in arranging. Even more important, as a resident in rooms at Somerset House, the young artist had a strong sense of the history surrounding him and he is known to have studied the old masters and admired the work of some current academicians.<br>
<br>Deverell's first exhibited work, a genre portrait study (priv. coll.), appeared at the Royal Academy in 1847, and was followed the next year by a scene from Faust, a subject shared with Rossetti. As an amateur actor, his love of acting and performance informed <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span> (exh. 1850; priv. coll.), which is his best-known and most fully realized work. He himself modelled for Duke Orsino, Rossetti for Feste, and, famously, in her first appearance in a work by the Pre-Raphaelites, Elizabeth Siddal as Viola. Retrospective accounts for the most part concur that Deverell &#145;discovered&#146; the young red-haired Lizzie while accompanying his mother on a foray to buy a hat at Madame Tozer's millinery shop in Cranbourne Alley, Leicester Square, in the later part of 1849, as he sought a model for Viola. (An alternative but more prosaic account is that Lizzie showed her own drawings to Deverell's father and that way met the young Deverell.) According to one contemporary account, Deverell himself harboured affections for Lizzie, prior to her relationship with Rossetti.<br>
<br>Close collaboration among the Pre-Raphaelites extended to painting sections of one another's works&#151;Deverell assisted Rossetti with <span class="italic">Ecce ancilla domini!</span> in 1850. Writing and making art also went hand in hand. Deverell played a key role in the realization of <span class="italic">The Germ</span>, the short-lived journal, as one of the proprietors who organized the printing and distribution. Here he published the poems &#145;The Sight Beyond&#146; and &#145;A Modern Idyl&#146;; his etching <span class="italic">Viola and Olivia</span> appeared in the last issue of May 1850. He essayed other Shakespearean subjects at this time, including the <span class="italic">Banishment of Hamlet</span> (exh. 1851; destroyed), known by a drawing (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford) which displays the characteristically idiosyncratic traits of Pre-Raphaelite draughtsmanship.<br>
<br>In October 1850 William Michael Rossetti named Deverell as a member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, having &#145;worthily filled up the place left vacant by [James] Collinson&#146; who had resigned earlier that year  (Fredeman, <span class="italic">P. R. B. Journal</span>, 72). Although Deverell was regarded as effectively a member of the brotherhood by at least some of its members, and expected to be elected at its meeting in January 1851, his election was never ratified for reasons which remain unclear  (ibid., 241). From January to May 1851 Rossetti and Deverell shared a studio in Red Lion Square. Careless of his attire yet exceptionally handsome, Deverell often modelled for his friends, most notably as the page in Ford Madox Brown's <span class="italic">Chaucer</span> (1849&#150;) and Claudio in Hunt's <span class="italic">Claudio and Isabella</span> (exh. RA, 1853). He was particularly close to Hunt, whom he relied on as a confidant and adviser.<br>
<br>With the death of his mother in October 1850 and his father's diminishing role at the school of design following the arrival of Henry Cole as secretary in 1851, family circumstances weighed heavily on Deverell. In 1852, when the school of design relocated to Marlborough House, the Deverells were forced to move. Evening teaching meant that Deverell travelled back and forth from central London to the new family home, Heathfield House, near Kew Gardens, which took its toll on his health. His art, however, flourished, with the beautiful garden and a new muse and model, named Eustatia Davie, serving as inspiration for several scenes of modern life, such as <span class="italic">A Pet</span> (exh. 1853; Tate collection) and <span class="italic">The Pet Parrot</span> (1853; National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne).<br>
<br>In June 1853 Deverell's father, with whom he had a tense and unhappy relationship, died. The family had to leave Kew for a smaller house in Chelsea. Under stress from being the sole support of his family, Deverell neglected his health, developing disease of the kidneys. His painful condition worsened and by early 1854 he was bedridden, yet he carried on with ambitious oils such as <span class="italic">The Irish Beggars by the Roadside</span> (1853&#150;4; Johannesburg Art Gallery, South Africa). One of his last works was the design for the vignette which appeared on the title-page of William Allingham's <span class="italic">Day and Night Songs</span> (1854). Doctors knew the young artist's death was imminent. His friends rallied: Millais visited regularly in the evenings to read the <span class="roman">Bible</span> aloud; Millais and Hunt arranged the secret purchase of Deverell's painting <span class="italic">A Pet</span> for 90 guineas; Rossetti also lent his moral support and tried to arrange sales with some of his own patrons during the last months and beyond. Deverell died at 3 Margaretta Terrace, Oakley Street, Chelsea, on 3 February 1854, aged twenty-six. It was recorded that he had suffered from albuminuria for some years, ulceration of the bowels for six months, and asthenia from dysentery for six months  (d. cert.). His funeral and burial took place at Holy Trinity Church, Brompton.<br>
<br>Deverell's death marked the end of the great camaraderie of the early Pre-Raphaelites. His friends were loyal well beyond his death, particularly Rossetti, who eventually took charge of Deverell's remaining paintings and planned a raffle in 1869&#150;70 to sell them to raise money for the artist's impoverished sister (two of his other siblings had emigrated to Australia in the 1850s). Closely involved in the earliest years of Pre-Raphaelitism and a member in all but name, Deverell, with his endearing personality, good looks, and sense of humour, was much loved. Owing to his early death and small oeuvre, he did not feature in accounts of the group until retrospective publications, chiefly by William Michael Rossetti, begin to appear in the 1890s. Still later, Deverell's few paintings emerged from his family's collections into exhibitions and then entered public collections. He is now known primarily as the man who discovered Elizabeth Siddal but his work shows many of the salient features of Pre-Raphaelitism both in style and choice of subject.<br>
