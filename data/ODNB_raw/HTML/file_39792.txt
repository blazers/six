<span class="headword">FitzRoy, Sir  Almeric William</span>  (1851&#150;1935), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born on 12 November 1851, the elder son of Francis Horatio FitzRoy (1823&#150;1900), the grandson of Admiral Lord William FitzRoy KCB (1782&#150;1857), and the great-grandson of the third duke of Grafton (1735&#150;1811). He was therefore descended from Charles II through his liaison with Barbara Villiers. His mother, Gertrude, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Duncombe (<i>d</i>. 1916), was the second daughter of the second Baron Feversham.<br>
<br>FitzRoy was sent to Cheam preparatory school, Surrey, but after two years his formal schooling was ended by rheumatic fever. His private studies, however, enabled him in 1870 to enter Balliol College, Oxford, where he obtained a first-class degree in history.<br>
<br>In 1876 FitzRoy joined the inspectorate of schools within the education department, then under the aegis of the privy council. Between 1885 and 1892 he was successively private secretary to Edward Stanhope, Sir Henry Holland, and Sir William Dyke. One of his duties was to negotiate with Cardinal Manning to secure the votes of the Irish members to the <span class="roman">Technical Education Bill</span> of 1889, and he retained a vivid sense of the cardinal's &#145;genius of command&#146; and &#145;magnetism of will&#146;  (FitzRoy, 1.xiv; 2.537&#150;8).<br>
<br>FitzRoy greatly admired the eighth duke of Devonshire, lord president of the council from 1895 to 1905, who immediately appointed him departmental private secretary. In 1898 the duke recommended FitzRoy to the queen to succeed Sir Charles Peel as clerk of the privy council. When FitzRoy was received at Balmoral, Queen Victoria was fascinated by his resemblance to Charles II. &#145;He was very much at his ease, rather too much, I thought&#146;, considered Marie Mallet, one of the ladies-in-waiting. &#145;He is so cynical and makes fun even of his poor little wife, because she is fond of her children. He has secured a tremendous place and looks extremely self-satisfied&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life with Queen Victoria</span>, 141&#150;2).<br>
<br>The establishment in 1900 of a separate Board of Education reduced the work of the privy council, which, however, retained miscellaneous responsibilities in higher education, local government, medicine, and scientific research. FitzRoy chaired the interdepartmental committee on physical deterioration (1903&#150;4), set up as a result of concern about the poor physical condition of potential recruits in the South African War. The committee advised that all county councils should have full-time medical officers of health (achieved in 1909), while other recommendations led to the systematic medical inspection of schoolchildren, established by the <span class="roman">Education Act</span> of 1907. This act also empowered local education authorities to provide school meals.<br>
<br>FitzRoy presided over a committee on the <span class="roman">Midwives Act</span> (1909), and served on the royal commission on venereal diseases (1913&#150;16), which concluded that not less than a tenth of the population suffered from syphilis. He also sat on the committee on the <span class="roman">Dentists Act</span> (1918&#150;19). His routine work, however, was simply to organize meetings of the privy council and to arrange for the formal presentation to the sovereign of legislation brought into force by orders in council. Much concerned with ceremony and protocol, FitzRoy read the official proclamation of the accession of Edward VII in 1901 and that of George V in 1910; in 1917 he also submitted a draft of the declaration by which George V changed the name of the royal family to Windsor. But despite FitzRoy's self-important air and his relish for being at the centre of events, attributes which attracted some mockery, he played no part in the formation of policy.<br>
<br>FitzRoy was always immaculately turned out, with a keen instinct for social niceties. In October 1922, however, he was fined &pound;5 at Marlborough Street magistrates' court for &#145;wilfully interfering with and annoying persons using Hyde Park&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 9 Oct 1922). He maintained that he had merely approached a woman under the delusion that she was someone he knew  (FitzRoy to Stamfordham, 10 Oct 1922, RA/PS/GV/O1812/2). The conviction was dismissed on appeal, and he was granted costs  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 11 Nov 1922). Though Lord Balfour (lord president at the time of the incident), Lord Stamfordham (George V's private secretary), and the king himself were all supportive, the fourth marquess of Salisbury, who replaced Balfour in October 1922, considered that FitzRoy had been &#145;indiscreet, to put it mildly&#146;, and advocated that he should retire after a few months  (Salisbury to Stamfordham, 12 Nov 1922, RA/PS/GV/O1812/9). FitzRoy duly left the clerkship at the end of May 1923. His successor, Sir Maurice Hankey, was also secretary of the cabinet and of the committee of imperial defence.<br>
<br>In 1925 FitzRoy published two large and ill edited volumes of memoirs. Though overladen with unremarkable accounts of council meetings and dinner parties, these tomes contain some interesting anecdotes, notably about the duke of Devonshire, Winston Churchill, and Lord Morley. There is also a fine purple patch on his attending mass in Westminster Cathedral at Christmas 1903. FitzRoy was instinctively attracted to Roman Catholicism, though he never renounced the Anglican faith in which he had been born.<br>
<br>The memoirs did not find favour at court. Lord Stamfordham was horrified that FitzRoy should have included an account (12 July 1904) of Edward VII's receiving an address from the House of Commons while having his corns cut. He also found it &#145;impertinent&#146; that &#145;this noble descendant of Charles II&#146; should have presumed to express his approval of Queen Mary's intelligence  (Stamfordham to Rosebery, 18 Sept 1925, RA/PS/GV/O1812/16). When FitzRoy sent a copy of the <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> to the queen, it was politely returned.<br>
<br>FitzRoy served on the council of the Stage Society, and helped the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art to obtain its charter. He published <span class="italic">Henry Duke of Grafton</span> (1921), <span class="italic">History of the Travellers' Club</span> (1927), and <span class="italic">History of the Privy Council from Earliest Times</span> (1928). He was appointed KCVO in 1909 and KCB in 1911.<br>
<br>FitzRoy married, on 30 July 1887, Katharine, daughter of Sir Henry Farquar, fourth baronet. They had a son and a daughter. Lady FitzRoy died on 24 November 1933, and FitzRoy himself on 31 May 1935 at his home, 4 Eaton Terrace, London. His funeral took place on 5 June 1935 at Holy Trinity, Sloane Street, and his body was subsequently interred at Holy Trinity, Hawley, Hampshire.<br>
