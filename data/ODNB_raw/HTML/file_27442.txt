<span class="headword">Tiffin,  William</span>  (1695/6&#150;1754), <span class="occ">phonetician and stenographer</span>, was born at Crimplesham, near Downham Market, Norfolk, the son of Roger Tiffin, gentleman, of a family long settled in that area. He was educated at Downham Market under Mr Robinson, and at Norwich under Mr Pate, before matriculating aged seventeen at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, on 11 February 1713, under surety of Mr Macro. Tiffin was a scholar at Cambridge from 1713 to 1718 and graduated BA in 1716/17. On 21 September 1718 he was ordained deacon at Norwich and became curate of the parishes of Wereham and Wretten, near Downham Market. His unwillingness to subscribe to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> limited his opportunities for preferment, but in 1735 Tiffin was recommended by the Revd Thomas Pyle of King's Lynn to the Revd John Jackson, master of Wigston's Hospital, Leicester, who advanced him for the position of confrater. The place was congenial to Tiffin, a &#145;very worthy, modest clergyman&#146;  (Nichols, 1, pt 2, 503), for it did not require subscription. Tiffin assisted Jackson with his collations of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. A son William, born to him and his wife, Margaret, was baptized at St Martin's, Leicester, on 29 April 1739. Another child, a daughter Ann, was mentioned in his will.<br>
<br>In 1751 Tiffin published by subscription a shorthand textbook entitled <span class="italic">A New Help and Improvement of the Art of Swift Writing</span>. An abject failure as a practical shorthand system&#151;John Nichols remarked that &#145;it never got on&#146;  (Nichols, 1, pt 2, 503)&#151;Tiffin's <span class="italic">New Help</span> is now generally viewed as the first system constructed on a phonetic basis, a discovery made by Sir Isaac Pitman only after he had published his seminal <span class="italic">Stenographic Sound-Hand</span> (1837). &#145;Tiffin was much more interested in phonetics than in shorthand, and one might claim with some justice that he was the best English phonetician before the 19th century&#146;  (Matthews, &#145;English pronunciation&#146;, 138).<br>
<br>Acutely aware of the defects of English orthography and the lack of a &#145;sufficient Alphabet&#146;  (Tiffin, 32), Tiffin stated that it was his &#145;peculiar Intention &hellip; to suit the Alphabet to the Utterances of the Language&#146;  (ibid., 5), taking care &#145;to give every Character one Power of its own, in which no other Character is allow'd to interfere&#146;  (ibid., 7).<br>
<br>In the lengthy appendix, Tiffin discusses vowels (recognizing nine distinct sounds) and diphthongs, articulation, and early eighteenth-century dialects. Tiffin's is perhaps the earliest study of English dialects, of which he was a keen observer, remarking on county and sometimes local pronunciations in Norfolk, Lancashire, Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, and North Britain (Scotland). His interest in dialect for its own sake, coupled with his powers of scientific detachment and observation, suggest that he was &#145;unique in his age&#146;  (Matthews, &#145;William Tiffin&#146;, 105). Unlike many contemporary orthoepists, he was not prescriptive:<blockquote>But be pleas'd to understand, that when the Pronunciation of particular Counties, of Rustics, of the Polite, or illiterate is mention'd, it is not with Intention either to recommend or censure; but in Compliance with the Opinion of the Public; the Purpose and End of every Remark being to give the Reader Opportunity to discern the Description of his own Pronunciation. (Tiffin, 37)</blockquote>Tiffin's own style is lively and colloquial but (unfortunately for prospective students of his system) diffuse and disorganized. Notably absent is the fulsome dedication to patrons that characterized shorthand textbooks of the day.<br>
<br>On 15 September 1754 Tiffin made his will, bequeathing to his wife and daughter the books in which he had written their names, and disposing of properties in Norfolk for the future benefit of his wife and children. He died before 3 December when the will was proved, and was buried in the cross aisle of St Martin's Church, Leicester, under the steeple. The brass plate on his tomb containing a Latin inscription written by John Jackson was removed by the next incumbent.<br>
