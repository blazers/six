</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wolfit <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Woolfitt]</span>, Sir  Donald</span>  (1902&#150;1968), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was born on 20 April 1902 at Homeleigh, 8 London Road, New Balderton, near Newark, the fourth of the five children of William Pearce Woolfitt (1862&#150;1938), brewer's clerk, and his wife, Emma Tomlinson (1868&#150;1925). He was educated at Barnby Road elementary school and at Magnus Grammar School, Newark. He became obsessed with the theatre from an early age, neglected his school work, and wanted above all else to be an actor. In 1918 Fred Terry, a leading actor&#150;manager of the day, took his touring company to Nottingham. Wolfit (as he spelt his surname from 1924) wrote to him and was interviewed, but Terry advised him to reapply at a later date. Wolfit's parents, however, were opposed to the theatre as a career and urged him to try schoolmastering instead; he agreed because, being stubborn and single-minded&#151;traits he was to demonstrate throughout his life&#151;he was secretly plotting his escape from Newark and parental influence. He found employment at a small private boarding-school in Eastbourne and achieved his ambitions in 1920 when Charles Doran's touring Shakespearian company visited the town. Wolfit auditioned and was employed as assistant stage manager, walk-on, and understudy. He was a quick learner and ambitious. When an actor fell ill, the chance occurred to step in and play a string of small speaking-parts. He impressed with his remarkable, if sometimes uncontrolled, energy and was promoted to larger roles. After two years with Doran and a tour with another actor&#150;manager, Alexander Marsh, Wolfit decided to try Fred Terry again, and landed the part of Armand St Just in <span class="italic">The Scarlet Pimpernel</span>. For a year he toured with Terry and his wife, Julia Neilson, a glamorous couple whose choice of plays, mannered acting, and unwieldy productions Wolfit much admired.<br>
<br>In 1924 Wolfit made his London d&eacute;but under Matheson Lang who engaged him to play small parts in a season that included <span class="italic">The Wandering Jew</span>, at the New Theatre. There followed several years of touring and repertory engagements. In Sheffield, on 16 April 1928, he married an actress, Chris Frances Castor (<i>b</i>. 1895/6); they had a daughter. Professionally, the most important engagement at this time was with the Arts League of Service, founded by a cultural missionary, Eleanor Elder, whose small company of players travelled by bus to perform in remote towns and villages in Scotland. These early engagements had a lasting influence on Wolfit, encouraging his love of Shakespeare, his sense of service to the community, and, above all, his attachment to the dying actor&#150;manager system.<br>
<br>Wolfit's opportunity to make a real impression came when Lilian Baylis engaged him to play at the Old Vic during 1929&#150;30. He displayed his versatility in a range of parts and was highly praised, especially as the King in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>. But for Wolfit it was not a happy time either professionally or privately. He made himself unpopular with some of his colleagues, and he was envious of the leading man, John Gielgud. Wolfit was not invited back for another season. His sense of being an outsider was intensified. Added to all this, his marriage ended.<br>
<br>For the following six years Wolfit worked more or less continually in and around London or on tour. In 1930 he was employed by William Poel, the director who revolutionized the presentation of Shakespeare, and the following year he toured Canada with Sir Barry Jackson's company. He was back at the New Theatre in 1932 in <span class="italic">Too True to be Good</span> by Bernard Shaw, who praised him for his performance as the Parson-Burglar; in 1933, at the same theatre, he was a last-minute replacement for the part of Thomas Mowbray in the highly successful <span class="italic">Richard of Bordeaux</span>, with Gielgud directing and playing the name-part.<br>
<br>This uninspiring period was notable, however, for Wolfit's first brief venture into management in his home town of Newark. In 1934 he persuaded the town council to guarantee his expenses so that he could present a week-long festival of drama. He produced <span class="italic">Arms and the Man</span>, <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span>, and <span class="italic">The Master Builder</span>, in which he played the leading parts with a company including John Clements and Margaret Rutherford. In the same year, on 15 September, he married Susan Katherine Anthony (<i>b</i>. 1906/7); they had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Wolfit at last won national recognition for his performances at Stratford upon Avon in 1936 and again in 1937, under the direction of Ben Iden Payne, whose daughter Rosalind Iden (1911&#150;1990) was to become Wolfit's leading lady. He fell deeply in love with her, left his wife, and lived with Rosalind, eventually marrying her on 20 April 1948. They remained a devoted couple.<br>
<br>In Stratford, Wolfit was praised for his Kent in <span class="italic">King Lear</span> and for his Hamlet. In between these two seasons he appeared as Antony opposite the Cleopatra of the Russian actress Eugenie Leontovich, directed by Theodore Komisarjevsky. The speaking of Leontovich was much ridiculed, but Wolfit was again lauded. His success encouraged him to take the plunge into full-time actor-management. In autumn 1937 he recruited a company of actors, many of whom had been with him in Stratford, and toured six plays by Shakespeare and <span class="italic">Every Man in his Humour</span>, as Bobadil. After nine weeks on the road he more or less broke even.<br>
<br>Actor-management was a way of life that Wolfit followed for the next twenty-six years, presenting plays by Shakespeare and other dramatists, mostly on tour but with occasional forays into London. Each spring and autumn he ventured forth, criss-crossing the British Isles, changing trains at Crewe station on Sundays&#151;leading a company of players, most of whom were not of the front rank. The regular touring battered the scenery; the costumes became worn and shabby. His curtain-call was a theatrical event in itself. Whether or not the part was truly demanding, he appeared totally exhausted, holding on to the curtain for support. A speech followed in which he first thanked the audience for their reception, then announced the programme for the remainder of the week. His reputation suffered: he soon came to be regarded as unfashionable, his productions were regularly savaged by the critics; smart London disdained him, prompting Hermione Gingold's quip, &#145;Olivier is a <i>tour-de-force</i>, and Wolfit is forced to tour&#146;  (Harwood, 208). Often embattled, he developed a majestic persona, grandiose, passionate, often pompous. He could be frightening and brutal but also astonishingly kind and genuinely humble.<br>
<br>Perceptive theatregoers and some critics, however&#151;especially James Agate&#151;acknowledged that Wolfit was a great actor in the grand tradition, and unequalled in certain roles. Possessed of a robust physique, he was unashamedly virile and full-blooded, able to generate crude, barbaric power. But he could also be delightful in comic roles. His voice had a remarkable range from bass to resonant falsetto, and he used it to startling effect.<br>
<br>Wolfit's versatility was never in doubt. From 1937 to 1950 his repertory included Shylock, Touchstone, Macbeth, Richard III, Othello, Petruchio, Malvolio, Benedick, Falstaff in <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span>, and Solness in <span class="italic">The Master Builder</span>. In two parts, however, he reached the summit of his art: Volpone, which he first played in 1938, a gloriously rich creation of a character relishing in his own evil; and his greatest achievement, King Lear. In 1942 he made an unsatisfactory attempt at the role, but in 1944 at the Scala Theatre, London, he was triumphant and was thereafter universally acclaimed as the greatest Lear of his generation.<br>
<br>Wolfit's energy and strength were boundless. At the outbreak of the Second World War, against all advice, he carried out his plans for an autumn tour. He also joined the Home Guard at Frensham, and managed to combine both activities, including a short season in 1940 at the Kingsway in London. Later that year, he gave lunch-time &#145;Scenes from Shakespeare&#146; at the Strand during air-raids. A bomb completely destroyed his scenery and costume store. Undaunted, he continued to tour, and in 1944 visited Egypt for the Entertainments National Service Association, followed by seasons in Paris and Brussels. He was deeply disappointed that his war service was not rewarded, but resumed his annual tours and in 1947 managed two highly successful visits to Canada and a season in New York. In 1950 he was appointed CBE.<br>
<br>The pattern of Wolfit's career was broken when, in 1950, Tyrone Guthrie invited him to appear with a first-class company at the Old Vic as Lear, Timon of Athens, Lord Ogleby in <span class="italic">The Clandestine Marriage</span>, and Marlowe's <span class="italic">Tamburlaine the Great</span>. Wolfit's Tamburlaine, directed by Guthrie, was another of his great performances and the critics showered him with praise. This was followed by Lord Ogleby, which also proved to be outstanding. But Wolfit chafed at performing in a company other than his own and surrounded by excellent supporting actors. He began to misbehave, resorting to the cheap tricks of a ruthless virtuoso performer to unsettle his colleagues. He was reprimanded by Guthrie, who admitted to being angry and brutal. Shortly afterwards, Wolfit claimed breach of contract for a trivial reason and left the Old Vic. He had destroyed a great opportunity to conform to the contemporary demands of working in an ensemble; he was unable to change his ways.<br>
<br>In 1953 Wolfit returned to actor-management when he mounted a series of plays at the King's Theatre, Hammersmith, with a stronger company than usual. He opened to rave reviews and full houses for <span class="italic">Oedipus the King</span> and <span class="italic">Oedipus at Colonus</span>, played as a double bill. There were revivals of <span class="italic">The Wandering Jew</span> and <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span> but having started so promisingly, by year's end, and for the last time, he resorted to his tired Shakespearian productions, in which, however, he gave some magnificent performances.<br>
<br>Wolfit was the subject of many stories that became part of theatrical folklore. Playing eight performances a week in eight leading roles, he developed a prodigious memory. Asked by a woman why, when playing Lear, for example, he did not get confused and speak bits of Macbeth, he replied, &#145;Madam, if you're invited to play golf, you do not take your tennis racket&#146;  (Harwood, 250). Also asked why he cut the Sir Topaz scene from <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span>, thus depriving Malvolio, Wolfit's part, of some meaty stuff, he said, &#145;I can't learn it, and if I can't learn it, Shakespeare didn't write it&#146;.<br>
<br>Wolfit believed in the theatre as a cultural and educational force. His contribution was immense, for he provided people all over the British Isles, especially during the war, with the opportunity of visiting a playhouse, perhaps for the first time, and seeing Shakespeare with the leading roles played by an actor of extraordinary gifts. From 1950 he appeared in films and on television. Although some thought him too theatrical as a film actor, he gave splendid and acclaimed performances as Sergeant Buzfuz in <span class="italic">Pickwick Papers</span>, in <span class="italic">Room at the Top</span>, and as Svengali.<br>
<br>In 1955 Wolfit had success on tour and in London with <span class="italic">The Strong are Lonely</span>, a play about the Jesuits in Paraguay. At the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith, in 1957, he presented two plays by Henri de Montherlant, but the public did not respond. Wolfit announced his retirement as an actor&#150;manager. That summer, however, he was knighted, and at once decided to come out of retirement and embark on one final tour under his own banner. He was the first actor to be twice honoured. &#145;I believe&#146;, he said, &#145;that makes me senior&#146;  (Harwood, 241).<br>
<br>Wolfit's last appearance on the stage was in a musical, as Mr Barrett in <span class="italic">Robert and Elizabeth</span> in 1966&#150;7. He died in the Royal Masonic Hospital, London, on 17 February 1968 and was buried in St Peter's Church, Hurstbourne Tarrant, Hampshire.<br>
