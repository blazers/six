</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wakley,  Thomas</span>  (1795&#150;1862), <span class="occ">medical journalist and politician</span>, was born on 11 July 1795 at Land Farm, Membury, Devon, the youngest son in the family of eleven children of Henry Wakley (1750&#150;1842), a prosperous farmer, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Minifie. He went to good grammar schools at Chard and Honiton, and at the age of ten was sent to Calcutta on a ship captained by a family friend. Although he never spoke of his experiences at sea, they probably affected his later campaigns against flogging and brutality in the armed forces. He returned to school, possibly at Wiveliscombe, Somerset, until he was apprenticed from the age of fifteen to a succession of medical practitioners: an apothecary in Taunton, a surgeon in Beaminster, and Mr Phelps, his brother-in-law and a surgeon in Henley-on-Thames.<h2>
<a name="Surgeonandmedicaljournalist"></a>Surgeon and medical journalist</h2>In 1815 Wakley went to London to complete his medical education. He remained primarily in the metropolis for the rest of his life. He enrolled as a pupil at the united hospitals of St Thomas's and Guy's, and also studied at the private anatomy school in nearby Webb Street run by Richard and Edward Grainger. He qualified for membership in the Royal College of Surgeons in 1817 and set up a private practice in the City, living in Gerard's Hall, Basing Lane. Two years later his prospective father-in-law, Joseph Goodchild, a wealthy lead merchant from Hendon, helped him purchase a fashionable practice in the West End and a fifteen-room house at 5 Argyll Street, near Oxford Circus. On 5 February 1820 he and Elizabeth Goodchild (1799&#150;1857) were married at St James's, Piccadilly. He seemed set fair for the comfortable life of a successful London practitioner. Six months later, his life was in complete disarray.<br>
<br>On 27 August 1820 Wakley was assaulted in his own home. He had had a headache and had applied leeches to his temple, wrapping his head in a tourniquet. A man knocked on his door and asked him to see a former patient of his and then requested a glass of cider. When Wakley went to the basement to fetch it, the man apparently admitted some masked companions. They knocked Wakley unconscious with a blow to his head, the tourniquet probably saving his life, and kicked and stabbed him. When he came to, the house was on fire. He escaped through the roof light, but the house and its wedding contents, which were heavily insured, were destroyed. The insurance company suspected Wakley of deliberate arson and refused to compensate him.<br>
<br>The incident attracted much attention in the newspapers. Although the assailants were never identified, it was suggested that they were members of a radical political gang whose leader, Arthur Thistlewood, and four associates had been executed in May 1820. Wakley was rumoured to have been the anonymous surgeon who had beheaded the victims after hanging. There is suggestive evidence that the Newgate beheader was actually a hospital porter and body snatcher named Parker, but the assault and fire forced Wakley and his bride to find another house in less genteel Norfolk Street, off the Strand. Wakley took the insurance company to court, where in June 1821 he obtained full compensation and costs.<br>
<br>His recuperation and the legal entanglement disrupted Wakley's medical practice, which among the poorer folk around Norfolk Street was in any case less lucrative. His wife expected more, and apparently suggested that he consider abandoning medicine for another career. At about the same time, he acquired the friendship of William Cobbett, the radical journalist, writer, and reformer. A visit in 1823 by Dr Walter Channing, a Boston physician and one of the founders of the <span class="italic">New England Journal of Medicine and Surgery</span> (1812), also prodded Wakley to consider establishing his own weekly journal in London. Channing may even have helped fund <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>, first published on Sunday 5 October 1823. It was Wakley, however, who made this journal what it was, and the journal was the making of him.<br>
<br>Wakley chose the title of his periodical carefully. As he pointed out, a lancet was not just a surgical instrument for cutting out the dross, it was also an arched window, for letting in light. It was successful from the very first issue, almost a quarter of which was devoted to a lecture by Sir Astley Cooper, London's leading surgeon, and a consultant at Guy's Hospital. The early issues were edited anonymously, although Cooper suspected Wakley and had his suspicions confirmed by going to Wakley's house disguised as a patient and discovering his former pupil correcting proofs.<br>
<br>Three features help explain the journal's immediate and continuing impact. First, it was published weekly, which allowed it to carry news of topical interest, to foster a correspondence column, and to encourage readers to anticipate its publication each week. Although <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> spawned other rival medical weeklies, in 1823 no other British medical periodical appeared more frequently than monthly, and several of them were irregular. This in effect allowed Wakley quickly to dominate the field.<br>
<br>Second, Wakley always aimed his journal at a wide audience. As a former general practitioner himself, he identified with the rank and file of the medical profession. Didactic lectures by eminent London teachers dominated the early volumes, which offered medical students and others the substance of these lectures without the necessity of paying the requisite fees. Initially, these were reproduced without the permission of the lecturer, Wakley or one of his collaborators attending and taking down the spoken words, usually in shorthand. Cooper had permitted the publication of his lectures, but John Abernethy, senior surgeon at St Bartholomew's Hospital, objected to seeing his own in print, grammatical infelicities and all, and took Wakley to court in December 1824. Initially Abernethy's injunction was denied, but a second application, in June 1825, was upheld, only to be overturned on Wakley's appeal in November, on the grounds that public lectures delivered in a public place were for the public good and therefore were public property. Wakley's version of these legal proceedings was fully and colourfully reported in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>. Eventually, medical teachers began to co-operate with Wakley, delivering copy of their lectures for reproduction in the journal.<br>
<br>In addition to publishing lectures by prominent teachers, Wakley also hoped to increase circulation in the early issues with general news items, including theatre reviews and a chess puzzle, two of his own passionate interests. <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> soon establishing itself, these non-medical features disappeared, as Wakley concentrated on a third successful ambition, using his journal to catalyse medical reform. He has been described as an improbable radical, but he retained his radicalism throughout his adult life. Reform was always top of his agenda, even after he became assimilated into the British establishment.<br>
<br>The first few volumes of <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> sought medical change through an aggressive, bombastic style. In the editorials and articles in his journal, Wakley assaulted nepotism, complacency, and secrecy within medicine. He campaigned for hospitals to make public their cumulative statistics of treatments and cures, and a series of articles, entitled &#145;Hole and corner surgery&#146;, exposed to ridicule surgeons who had bungled operations. A fatal lithotomy operation carried out in 1828 by Bransby Cooper, Sir Ashley's nephew, attracted much attention, especially after Cooper sued Wakley for libel. Wakley defended his own case and although he lost the legal battle, Cooper was awarded only token damages, which with costs were paid by public subscription. Characteristically, Wakley and Cooper became friends in later life. Wakley made frequent appearances in court during the decade, defending himself against libel charges brought by the surgeon Frederick Tyrell and Roderick Macleod, editor of the <span class="italic">London Medical and Physical Journal</span>. Wakley himself obtained libel damages from James Johnson, editor of the <span class="italic">Medico-Chirurgical Journal</span>, for the latter's malicious reference to the fire which had destroyed Wakley's house.<br>
<br>Wakley also attempted to open up to greater democracy the medical corporations, especially the Royal College of Surgeons, of which he was a rank-and-file member. The college's council was a closed, self-perpetuating oligarchy, whose members ran the college, approved each other's anatomy and surgery courses as obligatory for medical students wishing to obtain the college's qualification, and collected the lucrative fees for examining these new recruits. In a series of meetings, all of them animated and some of them violent, Wakley sought to put pressure on the college to reform itself, in addition to petitioning parliament to revoke the college's charter. The surgeons proved resistant to rapid change, especially as some of Wakley's earlier supporters, such as William Lawrence, began to modify their demands as they themselves achieved positions on the college's council. Significantly, Wakley himself was never elected to the fellowship of the college, created in 1843 partially as a means of expanding the number of doctors who could participate in running the affairs of the Royal College of Surgeons.<br>
<br>During the 1830s Wakley also attempted to create a radical alternative to the older medical corporations. His proposed London College of Medicine would have provided the basis of a universal medical qualification for general practitioners and consultants alike. He envisioned it as overseeing and improving educational and examination standards within medicine, an issue to which Wakley continued to devote much energy, both through his journal and, after 1835, as a member of parliament. The London College of Medicine never got beyond the blueprint stage.<br>
<br>Wakley continued to use his journal to publicize other medical and social issues that he wished to see reformed. These included the system of poor relief and its medical services, the adulteration of foods, public health, medical quackery, and flogging and other forms of corporal punishment in the armed forces. His strategies became more subtle than the blockbuster tactics of the early <span class="italic">Lancet</span>, and also more effective. A number of individuals helped Wakley conduct his journal. These included J. F. Clarke, William Lawrence, William Cobbett, and, before Wakley exposed his mesmeric experiments on two young female mediums, John Elliotson. He was not always liked, but he was admired by many, including Charles Dickens, William Thackeray, Henry Brougham, and others outside the medical profession. He was in effect the first full-time medical journalist who demonstrated how powerful the medical press could be.<h2>
<a name="Memberofparliament"></a>Member of parliament</h2>Medical politics infused <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> from the very beginning, and by the time of the <span class="roman">Reform Act</span> of 1832, Wakley had acquired a substantial reputation. He published from 2 January 1831 until late in 1832 a political weekly called <span class="italic">The Ballot</span>. This both reflected his wider political interests and more actively involved him in the radical political scene surrounding the debates about extending the franchise and reforming parliament. He also realized that his own ambitions had a better chance of being achieved with him inside parliament rather than simply as a critic of it. With Cobbett's backing, he agreed to stand as an independent radical for Finsbury, London, in the first general election after the <span class="roman">Reform Act</span>, in December 1832. Although his own financial situation necessitated a low-key campaign, he made a creditable showing, which encouraged him to stand again in 1834. He was successful in his third attempt, in January 1835. In June that year he made a great impression in the House of Commons with an impassioned speech on behalf of six Dorset labourers (the &#145;Tolpuddle martyrs&#146;) sentenced to transportation for combining to resist the reduction of their wages. Shortly after entering parliament, he published from 23 April to 22 May 1836 another short-lived political periodical, <span class="italic">A Voice from the Commons</span>. He remained a popular and conscientious member for Finsbury until ill health forced his retirement in 1852.<br>
<br>Wakley had consistently campaigned for parliament as an independently minded citizen who wished to extend the franchise, facilitate local democracy, increase parliamentary accountability, and reduce the rates. He was true to his word, and although he obviously took matters of medical reform most seriously, he participated in a wide range of parliamentary matters, attending sittings regularly and voting in the majority of divisions. His early speeches were usually brief, but he developed sufficient oratorical skills to bring himself into national notice. He addressed many of the leading questions of the day, including the reform of the law courts, prison and workhouse conditions, taxation, the state of the railways, church reform, copyright law, and Chartism.<br>
<br>Inevitably, however, medical matters preoccupied Wakley. With Henry Warburton and others, he helped draft and comment on the successive medical acts that were debated in parliament through the late 1830s and 1840s. These were eventually to culminate in the <span class="roman">Medical Act</span> of 1858, which legally defined the medical practitioner, and created the Medical Register and a professional regulatory body, the General Medical Council. Although Wakley had by then retired from parliament, the act disappointed him in perpetuating the variety of medical educational and licensing bodies, and in its failure to address directly the issue of quackery. It embodied a public recognition of professionalism within medicine, however, a subject always near the top of Wakley's agenda.<br>
<br>Wakley had earlier been successful in helping shape several pieces of medically related legislation. The <span class="roman">Medical Witnesses Act</span> of 1837, which gave coroners more power in requiring doctors to assist at inquests, also mandated payment for their professional services. He was much concerned with the public health implications of burial-grounds and with the <span class="roman">Public Health Act</span> of 1848. He used both his position in parliament and his journal to publicize the scandals in the Andover workhouse, and the death, following flogging, of a young private named Frederick John White in 1846. In the 1850s he created through <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> an Analytical Sanitary Commission, whose work exposed extensive adulteration of many foods and drinks and led to regulatory legislation beginning in 1860.<h2>
<a name="CoronerforWestMiddlesex"></a>Coroner for West Middlesex</h2>In addition to editing a weekly journal and representing Finsbury constituency in parliament, Wakley found the time and energy to offer himself for election as coroner in 1830. Lawyers had traditionally occupied this ancient post; Wakley was the first medical man to seek it. Unsuccessful at first, he was elected coroner for West Middlesex in 1839, a position he held until his death. It was his sixth campaign of the decade (four for parliament as well as the earlier one for the coronership), but Wakley was easily elected in 1839 on a platform of extending the powers of the office, investigating every case of suspicious death in the large and populous district, and of publicly exposing crime whenever he found it. This he subsequently did, finding his position more powerful as a result of the <span class="roman">Medical Witnesses Act</span> that he had helped push through parliament.<br>
<br>Wakley's insistence that determining the cause of a sudden or suspicious death was essentially a medical matter brought him into conflict with magistrates and their clerks. His determination to hold inquests on every appropriate occasion, and to pay his medical witnesses, meant that his expenses were much greater than those of his predecessors. However, a parliamentary committee of 1840 supported Wakley's view of the office. The use of deputy coroners was also queried early in Wakley's tenure of office, as was his right to commit individuals determined during the course of his coroner's inquest to have been guilty of murder. He also ran foul of workhouse officials by insisting that accidental or violent deaths of inmates should also be subject to coroner's inquests, which in several instances revealed negligence or maltreatment. Since Wakley and his journal had ever been critical of the new poor laws of 1834, and their medical provisions, neither Wakley's energetic use of his coroner's powers, nor the publicity he gave scandals in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>, endeared him to officialdom. He believed that the health of incarcerated paupers would improve were the poor-law infirmaries to be better provisioned, and poor-law medical officers given more power, status, and income.<br>
<br>Industrial accidents and railway injuries and deaths provided another highly contentious arena for Wakley's enterprise. He was able to use the ancient law of deodand to impose fines on employers or industrialists found guilty of causing death through negligence until the <span class="roman">Deodants Abolition Act</span> of 1846 abolished this possibility; although it was accompanied by a <span class="roman">Fatal Accidents Act</span>, tighter legislation relating to industrial accidents and injuries was not passed until after Wakley's death.<br>
<br>Above all, Wakley used his coroner's office as a platform to campaign for medical coroners as a matter of course. He was accused of being self-serving, but the stance was entirely consistent with his more general belief that doctors were undervalued, and that collective professional advancement was the way forward. He sought less to denigrate medical &eacute;lites than to raise the rank and file, through improvements in education, better conditions of employment, and more social respect.<h2>
<a name="Personallife"></a>Personal life</h2>Despite his personal historical visibility and the continuing importance of the journal he founded, Wakley remains enigmatic. He was ever indignant at social or political injustice, and he never lost his concern for the plight of the ordinary individual. He hated cant and humbug, which endeared him to Charles Dickens. At the same time he was personally ambitious, with a highly developed sense of his own worth. He maintained a home in Bedford Street, London, and an estate, Harefield Park, and entertained lavishly, even while remaining abstemious himself. He seemed addicted to the rough and tumble of turbulent public life, but he remained a devoted family man. A lifelong radical, he was also an active Anglican. His wife's death in 1857 affected him deeply. A daughter died young, but he was intensely proud and supportive of his three sons. Two of these, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36681/', "Thomas Henry Wakley (1821&#150;1907)")</script> and James Goodchild Wakley (1827&#150;1886), followed him into medical journalism, continuing <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> as a family business until the twentieth century. The middle son, Henry Membury, became a barrister and deputized for his father as a coroner.<br>
<br>Wakley was a large man with enormous energy, who routinely worked sixteen-hour days. In his early life he acquired fame as an accomplished boxer. In 1851, following a strenuous day involving seven inquests and attendance at the House of Commons until midnight, he was found unconscious outside the <span class="italic">Lancet</span> office, where he had gone to continue working. This episode convinced Wakley to slow down, and although he left parliament, he retained the coronership and <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>, which his sons joined him in editing. Their take-over was probably gradual, and Wakley retained the official editorship until his death.<br>
<br>In the late 1850s Wakley enjoyed a brief period of better health, and he contemplated running again for parliament. However, in late 1860, signs of active pulmonary tuberculosis supervened. He spent the winter of 1861&#150;2 in Madeira, where his lungs began to heal. He had made arrangements to return to England, but on 11 May 1862 he slipped on the beach, the haemoptysis recurred, and he died on 16 May. His embalmed body was brought back for burial beside his wife and daughter in Kensal Green cemetery on 14 June.<br>
