<span class="headword">Condell,  Henry</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1757, <em>d.</em> 1824), <span class="occ">musician and composer</span>, was born in London and baptized at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, on 15 December 1757. He was the son of John Condell (<i>d</i>. 1779), a Covent Garden box-keeper, and his common-law wife, Ann Wilson. His father had previously been married to Jane Wilcox (<i>d</i>. 1752) and they had two children, John (<i>fl</i>. 1779&#150;1784) and Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 1759).<br>
<br>Condell gave his first public performance on 23 May 1771 as soloist in a harpsichord concerto at Covent Garden Theatre. On 25 May 1773 he played his own harpsichord concerto for his father's benefit at the same venue. He was elected a member of the Royal Society of Musicians on 1 March 1778 and between the years 1793 and 1818 served as a member of its governing body, the court of assistants. By 1783 he was engaged as a member of the King's Theatre opera band and he played at the Pantheon with the same ensemble in 1790&#150;91. In his <span class="italic">Musical Directory for the Year 1794</span> Joseph Doane lists him as a performer at the Concerts of Antient Music and the Professional Concerts (1794). He continued at the King's Theatre from 1800; Sainsbury describes him as &#145;a good violinist&#146;  (Sainsbury, 1.169) there. Condell's compositions included several songs, a piano sonata (1806?), harpsichord duets (published after 1810), and overtures to Michael Kelly's new operas&#151;<span class="italic">A House to be Sold</span> (Drury Lane, 17 November 1802), <span class="italic">The Hero of the North</span>, and <span class="italic">Love Laughs at Locksmiths</span> (Haymarket, 25 July 1803)&#151;and William Dimond's <span class="italic">Hero of the North</span> (19 February 1803). He also wrote music for Fawcett's ballet <span class="italic">The Enchanted Island</span> (Haymarket, 20 June 1804) and for several stage plays and compilations. In 1811 he gained a prize at the Catch Club for his glee &#145;Loud Blowe the Wyndes&#146;.<br>
<br>Condell was a member of the committee that arranged the Royal Society of Music's annual concert at St Paul's in 1815. He left the King's Theatre in 1818, and by early December 1823 the news was shared with the Royal Society of Musicians that he was too unwell to attend meetings. He died at Cave House, Battersea, after a severe and lingering illness, on 24 June 1824. He is said to have had a wife and a daughter, Jane, but it seems that both predeceased him. His will, dated 5 April 1821, included annuities and jewellery bequeathed to friends and relations. His instruments and music collection were sold at auction by W. P. Musgrave on 30 March 1825.<br>
