<span class="headword">Fitzgeffrey,  Henry</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1639/40), <span class="occ">satirist</span>, was the second son of Sir George Fitzgeffrey, knight, of Creaken in Barford, Bedfordshire. He was a king's scholar at Westminster School, and went on from there to Cambridge, matriculating as a pensioner at Trinity College in 1612. On 5 October 1614 he was admitted to Lincoln's Inn. In October 1616 his elder brother, George Fitzgeffrey, died. George's will indicates that he was heavily in debt, that Henry had entered into numerous bands and sureties on his behalf, and that their father was still alive at this time.<br>
<br>Fitzgeffrey is known for one publication, which first appeared as <span class="italic">Satyres and Satyricall Epigrams</span> (entered on the Stationers' register on 9 October 1617), before being prefixed with a selection of unrelated elegies by Francis Beaumont, Michael Drayton, and other writers, and reissued in 1618 and 1620 as <span class="italic">Certain Elegies, done by Sundry Excellent Wits, with Satires and Epigrames</span>. Fitzgeffrey identifies himself on the title-page of the first edition as a student at Lincoln's Inn. A number of other Lincoln's Inn students are either recipients or contributors of epigrams: among them &#145;his Lou: Chamber-Fellow and nearest friend Nat. Gurlin of Lincolns-Inn&#146; (admitted 1613), &#145;his True friend Thomas Fletcher&#146; (admitted 1615), and the satirist John Stephens (admitted 1611). Also in Fitzgeffrey's poetic circle were Will Goddard and George Wither. Fitzgeffrey's satires describe London life and theatrical circles, with several references to debt that invite biographical application:<blockquote>
<div>
<i>Duke's not in debt</i>: yee do him wrong to say it:<br>
</div>
<div>The <i>Debt</i> is&#151;God knowes whose. His that will pay it.<br>
</div> (<span class="roman">Epigram 13</span>)</blockquote>Most interesting to modern readers, perhaps, is his pen portrait of John Webster, &#145;Websterio&#146;, that he claims is based on personal acquaintance. He portrays &#145;the Play-wright, Cart-wright&#146; struggling for inspiration in a tavern:<blockquote>
<div>See how he drawes his mouth awry of late.<br>
</div>
<div>How he scrubs: wrings his wrests: scratches his Pate<br>
</div> (&#145;Notes from Black-Fryers&#146;, 266&#150;7)</blockquote>Fitzgeffrey's problems with debt continued, as he and another student, Oliver Goode, were complained against by Mary Wythines in January 1618 for non-payment of money owed. The benchers of Lincoln's Inn suspended the two students until the money was repaid. In June 1618 the benchers ordered that Fitzgeffrey's &#145;chamber be disposed of for the payment of his dueties to the house&#146;  (<span class="italic">Black Books</span>, 199, 200, 206). None the less, he was called to the bar on 14 June 1621. Nothing further is known of Fitzgeffrey's later career, and by the time of the 1634 visitation of Bedfordshire, the manor of Creaken in Barford no longer belonged to the Fitzgeffrey family. His will, made and proved in 1639&#150;40, names three brothers and a sister  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/182/41).<br>
