<span class="headword">Ouvry,  Frederic</span>  (1814&#150;1881), <span class="occ">antiquary and lawyer</span>, born on 20 October 1814 at 6 Abingdon Street, Westminster, was the third son of Peter Aim&eacute; Ouvry, under-secretary at the Ordnance office, and Sarah Amelia Delamain, and was nephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5920/', "John Payne Collier")</script>. He was descended from James Ouvry, a Huguenot refugee from the neighbourhood of Dieppe who arrived in England in 1683 and settled in Spitalfields.<br>
<br>Ouvry served five-year articles with George Hildyard King, was then admitted a solicitor in 1835, and joined the firm of Hildyard and King at 13 Tokenhouse Yard in the City of London. He became a partner in Farrer &amp; Co. at 66 Lincoln's Inn Fields in 1855. His most famous client was his friend Charles Dickens, who instructed him to act on several occasions, including the drafting of the novelist's formal deed of separation from his wife, Catherine, in 1858. Ouvry was depicted as Mr Undery in &#145;The Haunted House&#146; in <span class="italic">All the Year Round</span> (1859). Another client, Coutts &amp; Co., bankers, presented him in 1869 with a portrait bust by Marshall Wood. Ouvry was also solicitor to the fifth duke of Newcastle and worked with W. E. Gladstone after the duke's death to administer Newcastle's complex estate. He was honorary solicitor to the Royal Institute of British Architects from 1862 and made an honorary fellow in 1877. He was also solicitor to the Royal Literary Fund from 1864 and treasurer from 1877. He achieved the highest office in his profession in 1871 as president of the Incorporated Law Society. The Ouvry family had a long association with the Weavers' Company; Frederic was upper bailiff in 1878, and presented the company with the badge worn by later upper bailiffs.<br>
<br>On 24 February 1848 Ouvry was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and from 1854 to 1874 he filled the office of treasurer. On his resignation he was made vice-president, and on 4 January 1876 he was unanimously elected president. He retired in 1878. He presented the society with many valuable books, and a portrait of William Oldys. He contributed two papers to <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span> (1853&#150;5), but his tastes and collections were mostly concerned with literary history. He had a fine library of manuscripts, autograph letters, and printed books, including the first four folios of Shakespeare. A catalogue of his collection of old ballads, compiled by T. W. Newton, was issued in 1887. He frequently printed facsimiles of rare publications of which only one copy was known; the first was <span class="italic">The Cobler of Canterburie</span> (1862).<br>
<br>Ouvry married Emily Anna (Minnie) Procter on 28 September 1854, and lived at Riverside, Maidenhead, Berkshire, and 12 Queen Anne Street, Cavendish Square, London. They had no children. He died suddenly at his town house on 26 June 1881, and was buried at Acton. His library was sold in April 1882 for &pound;6169 2<i>s</i>., and some items were acquired by the British Museum Library.<br>
