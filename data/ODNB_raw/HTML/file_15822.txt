<span class="headword">Kynaston, Sir  Francis</span>  (1586/7&#150;1642), <span class="occ">writer and founder of an academy of learning</span>, was born in Oteley, Shropshire, the eldest son of Sir Edward Kynaston (<i>d</i>. after 1638), gentleman, and his wife, Isabel, daughter of Sir Nicholas Bagenall. He matriculated at Oriel College, Oxford, on 11 December 1601, aged fourteen, and graduated BA from St Mary Hall on 14 June 1604. Admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 9 October 1604, he was called to the bar in 1611. He was awarded an MA degree from Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1609. His marriage in 1613 to Margaret, daughter of Sir Humphrey Lee, bt, produced one son. Knighted by James I on 1 January 1618, he represented Shropshire in the parliament of 1621. Named taxor of Cambridge University in 1623, he was proctor in 1634. In 1625 he became esquire of the body to Charles I.<br>
<br>Kynaston was almost certainly responsible for a substantial tract entitled &#145;True presentation of forepast parliaments&#146;, probably written in 1629. It survives in at least five manuscript copies and was the subject of extensive notes by Secretary Francis Windebanke, which identify the author as &#145;Sir Fr: Ken:&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/233/51&#150;2). Kynaston was provoked into writing by an anonymous book exalting the antiquity and authority of parliament, and more generally by what he perceived as the exaggerated reverence for the House of Commons and disrespect for kingship by many MPs in the 1620s. True parliaments, he argued, did not exist under the ancient Britons or Saxons, but instead originated in an assembly convoked by Henry I for the purpose of taking oaths of fealty from his subjects after he had usurped the crown. An elected House of Commons emerged still later through an edict of Henry III, proving that medieval kings had the authority to alter parliamentary procedures and privileges. Parliament's proper function was to offer the king advice and assistance solely with respect to those issues he and his council laid before it. Although parliaments often helped to draft laws, ultimate legislative authority remained in the king alone. Kynaston strenuously objected to the idea that MPs were mainly responsible to their &#145;countries&#146; rather than the king, which he thought had spread dangerously in recent years. He also criticized counties and boroughs for electing inappropriate representatives in order to please powerful local patrons.<br>
<br>Between 1633 and 1635 Kynaston published three works of translation. <span class="italic">Musae querulae: de regis in Scotiam profectione</span> (1633) presented Latin poems on the king's journey to his coronation in Edinburgh and English renditions by Kynaston on facing pages. <span class="italic">Musae aulicae autore Ionstono</span> (1635) did the same for Latin panegyrics to Charles and Henrietta Maria by Arthur Jonston, a Scottish physician to the king. In <span class="italic">Amorum Troili et Creseidae libri duo</span> (1635) Kynaston published a translation of Chaucer's <span class="italic">Troilus and Criseyde</span> on facing pages with the original. The text was prefaced by a large number of Latin and English dedicatory poems hailing Kynaston for having rescued Chaucer from the oblivion into which his antiquated language had thrust him, by making it possible for readers to appreciate his wit &#145;without a dictionary&#146;  (W. Cartwright, prefatory poem). The manuscript, together with that of his unpublished translation of Robert Henryson's <span class="italic">Testament of Cresseid</span>, survives in the Bodleian Library in Oxford.<br>
<br>In 1635 Kynaston also founded an academy, the Musaeum Minervae, at his house in Bedford Street, Covent Garden. For this he obtained a licence under the great seal, a grant of arms, and a common seal. Charles I contributed &pound;100 to the project. The text of a masque written by Kynaston and presented to Prince Charles to mark the opening of the academy was printed under the title <span class="italic">Corona Minerva</span> (1635). The next year Kynaston published <span class="italic">The Constitutions of the Musaeum Minervae</span>, describing the academy's regulations and curriculum. Only sons of peers and gentlemen were to be admitted, for training by a regent and six &#145;professors&#146; in subjects that men of high birth needed to understand. These included heraldry, the rudiments of the common law, antiquities, coins and medals, husbandry, anatomy, physiology and &#145;physic&#146;, astronomy, optics, navigation and cosmography, various branches of mathematics, music, ancient and modern languages including Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Italian, French, Spanish, and High Dutch, and skill at weapons. Additional instruction in riding, dancing and behaviour, painting, sculpture, and writing rounded out the curriculum. Strong emphasis was to be placed on ideals of honour and lineage, conveyed by &#145;exciting&#146; students to emulate the accomplishments of old English &#145;worthies&#146; and their own virtuous ancestors.<br>
<br>Late in 1636 Kynaston became involved with a Covent Garden neighbour, Edward Mae, in a project to develop a &#145;hanging furnace&#146; for use by the Royal Navy. This apparently consisted of an enclosed stove suspended by iron bars, intended to replace the heavy brick piles used to contain cooking fires on board ship. The invention received a trial, though with unknown results. By the late 1630s Kynaston had run heavily into debt and was in danger of being disinherited by his father. Francis Windebanke and the king himself interceded on his behalf.<br>
<br>Kynaston's last published work appeared in the year of his death, 1642. This was a facetious and slightly bawdy romance set in ancient Britain, entitled <span class="italic">Leoline and Sydanis</span>, to which Kynaston appended a number of love poems. In the dedicatory epistle he described himself as &#145;old and stricken in years&#146;, and claimed to have a number of pieces of &#145;solid learning&#146; ready for the press, none of which has since been identified. He was buried at Oteley. The Musaeum Minervae does not seem to have survived his death and the outbreak of the civil war. Letters of administration of his estate were granted to his son, Edward, on 13 November 1649.<br>
