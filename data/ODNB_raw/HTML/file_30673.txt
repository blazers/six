<span class="headword">Beevor,  Charles Edward</span>  (1854&#150;1908), <span class="occ">neurologist</span>, born in London on 12 June 1854, was the eldest son of Charles Beevor FRCS, and Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Burrell. He received his early education at Blackheath proprietary school and afterwards studied medicine at University College, London. He became MRCS in 1878, and graduated MB in 1879, and MD in 1881. He became MRCP in 1882 and FRCP in 1888. On 7 February 1882 he married Blanche Adine, daughter of Dr Thomas Robinson Leadam. After holding the appointments of house physician at University College Hospital, and resident medical officer at the National Hospital for the Paralysed and Epileptic, Queen Square, he went abroad in 1882&#150;3, and studied under Heinrich Obersteiner, Carl Weigert, Julius Cohnheim, and Wilhelm Heinrich Erb, at Vienna, Leipzig, Berlin, and Paris. On his return in 1883 he was appointed assistant physician to the National Hospital, Queen Square, and to the Great Northern Central Hospital (later the Royal Northern Central Hospital) in 1885. In the course of time he became full physician to both institutions, offices which he held until his death.<br>
<br>From 1883 to 1887 Beevor was engaged with Victor Horsley in experimental research on the localization of cerebral functions, especially with regard to the course and origin of the motor tracts. This work confirmed results obtained by previous investigators and established the reputation of the authors  (<span class="italic">PTRS</span>, 181B, 1890; also 1887&#150;9). In 1903 Beevor delivered the Croonian lectures before the Royal College of Physicians, on muscular movements and their representation in the central nervous system (published in 1904), and in 1907 he delivered the Lettsomian lectures entitled &#145;The diagnosis and localization of cerebral tumours&#146; before the Medical Society of London. He contributed many papers on subjects connected with neurology to <span class="italic">Brain</span> and other medical journals, and his <span class="italic">Handbook on Diseases of the Nervous System</span> (1898) became a leading textbook. His most important work was &#145;On the distribution of the different arteries supplying the brain&#146;, which was published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</span> (200B, 1909, 1&#150;56) and was the first published work to contain an accurate description of the cerebral arterial circulation. Beevor succeeded in injecting simultaneously the five arteries of the brain with different coloured substances held in solution in gelatin and by this means he determined exactly the blood supply to different parts of the brain. The importance of Beevor's discovery was not only from the anatomical side but also from the pathological, for it enabled the physician to know the exact portions of the brain which are liable to undergo softening when any particular artery is blocked by a clot of blood.<br>
<br>In May 1908 Beevor went to America, where his lectures were received with enthusiasm by the members of the American Neurological Society, and by the American Medical Association at its fifty-ninth annual session. In 1907&#150;8 he was president of the Neurological Society of London, and on its amalgamation with the Royal Society of Medicine he became the first president of the society's corresponding section, and died in office. For ten years he was honorary secretary to the Association for the Advancement of Medicine by Research.<br>
<br>Beevor ranks among the great authorities on the anatomy and diseases of the nervous system. He possessed great intellectual power, energy, and industry, and was unsurpassed in his accuracy of observation and recording of facts. He was however cautious in publishing his own observations when they seemed at variance with tradition and accepted teaching. Beevor died from sudden cardiac failure on 5 December 1908 at his residence, 135 Harley Street, and was buried at Hampstead cemetery on 9 December. He was survived by his wife and a son and daughter.<br>
