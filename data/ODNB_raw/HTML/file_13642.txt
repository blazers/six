<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Home,  George</span>, earl of Dunbar  (<em>d.</em> 1611), <span class="occ">courtier and administrator</span>, was the fourth son of Alexander Home of Manderston (<i>d</i>. 1593) and Janet Home (<i>d</i>. 1593), daughter of George Home of Spott. The date of his birth is uncertain. There were many divisions among the Homes as a family, including religious divisions. The Manderston sept was firmly protestant. The head of the family, Alexander, sixth Lord Home, was a Catholic, and in 1590 George Home married Elizabeth, daughter and heir of the Catholic Sir George Gordon of Gicht. His ties to both religious parties stood Home in good stead in the occasionally overheated religious atmosphere of Jacobean Scotland.<h2>
<a name="Thecourtier"></a>The courtier</h2>At some point in the early 1580s Home made his way to court. In March 1585 he was cleared of a charge, brought by a kinsman, of being in touch with the Ruthven raiders, a group of nobles and lairds who had seized the young James VI and taken control of government in 1582&#150;3; shortly thereafter he became a gentleman of the bedchamber. In 1589 Home accompanied King James on his voyage to Denmark to claim his bride. While there Home engineered his first major promotion, to the office of master of the wardrobe. James was annoyed at the incumbent, Sir William Keith, because, James said, Keith dressed better than he did. More importantly, the king was annoyed at the head of the family, George Keith, fourth Earl Marischal, his ambassador to the Danish court, who resented having to yield precedence there to the lord chancellor, John Maitland of Thirlestane, whom Marischal regarded as an upstart. In making his profit from circumstances for which he was not responsible, Home showed a sure touch and an ability to read the king's moods which he never lost. He became a favourite with James, but not of the usual kind. He was not a pretty young man. He did not share the king's passion for hunting. But he was good company, discreet, cautious, and, above all, loyal. As George Nicolson, the English agent in Edinburgh, who knew him well, put it in January 1603, Home acted &#145;by the King's good direction, without which he is noted to deal in nothing&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1597&#150;1603</i>, 1055&#150;6).<br>
<br>In the faction-ridden Scottish court of the 1590s Home became the quintessential courtier. As early as August 1590 Chancellor Maitland thought it worth while to have Home's support for requests he made of the king. On 4 November 1590 Home was knighted; he and Alexander Lindsay, who became Lord Spynie in that same month, were described as James's &#145;special favourites&#146;, who received &#145;a promise of a great part&#146; of the annual pension James received from England &#145;before it be arrived&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1589&#150;93</i>, 419, 473). Spynie was a rival. Both became privy councillors in June 1592, but by August they had quarrelled, and Spynie found himself accused of being friendly with Francis Stewart, first earl of Bothwell, the king's cousin but now the object of James's hatred and fear. Home was Bothwell's enemy, and had been ever since 1584, when Bothwell &#145;hewed Davy Hume [George's brother] all to pieces&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1584&#150;5</i>, 330), because Bothwell claimed the priory of Coldingham, currently in the possession of George's eldest brother, Alexander. Home solidified his position as the king's confidant. James frequently used him to carry messages to the English agents at court, one of whom described him in December 1591 as &#145;very wise and very honest&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1589&#150;93</i>, 595). Those in James's bad books, such as Bothwell's associate John Colville, found that the surest way to regain the king's goodwill was to enlist Home's support. In June 1594 Home in his capacity as master of the wardrobe received &pound;4000 Scots to buy cloth, chairs, and stools, and repair tapestries, in anticipation of the baptism of James's son and heir, which took place in August. A month later an English agent reported that Bothwell, who in 1592 had publicly urged that Home be killed, planned to seize the king and hang Home, in imitation of the aristocracy's treatment of James III's alleged favourite, Thomas Cochrane, in 1482. Within six months Bothwell had left Scotland forever. During these years Home managed to avoid denunciation by the kirk on account of his friendship with the Catholic earl of Huntly&#151;he was alleged to have obtained the notorious blank commission for Huntly before the latter's murder of the earl of Moray in 1592&#151;and indeed Home helped to persuade his kinsman Lord Home to submit to the kirk and follow the king's wishes.<h2>
<a name="Lordtreasurer"></a>Lord treasurer</h2>The appointment of the Octavians in 1596 to bring order out of the chaos of James's finances threatened not only the incomes of those like Home whom the contemporary historian David Calderwood described as &#145;cubicular courtiers&#146;  (Calderwood, 5.510), but also Home's ambition, which had surfaced as early as 1592, to become lord treasurer himself. It is possible, as Calderwood alleges, that Home had a hand in prodding some clergymen to take action against the Octavians, many of whom were regarded, accurately, as Catholics. The resulting anti-Catholic riot in December 1596 served Home well. James now viewed the Octavians, efficient though they were, as a political liability. Successive lords treasurer who replaced them were incompetent; so James finally turned to Home, whom Nicolson described in October 1600 as &#145;the only greatest courtier&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1597&#150;1603</i>, 720). On 1 October 1601 Home became lord treasurer. He retained the office until his death, although after 1603, when he followed the king to London and remained there, he exercised his authority through deputies.<br>
<br>During his eighteen months of direct supervision of the treasury Home acted with vigour. The collection of arrears of taxation was speeded up; Home himself received a share of what was collected. He tightened up the administration of acts of caution. In the interest of law and order as well as the treasury he ordered all sheriffs and their subordinates to pursue all those at the horn (outlawed) since 1596 and to seize their moveables until they found caution to appear in court. Paradoxically, his own record as sheriff of Berwick was none too good; the privy council in December 1599 cited him for negligence in pursuit of those charged with crimes, especially if their names happened to be Home.<br>
<br>These activities, and regular attendance at meetings of the privy council, kept Home busy, but never so busy that he neglected his principal occupation: constant attendance on the king. He had a reputation for ruthlessness in undercutting potential rivals; so much so that when in February 1601 the earl of Mar was preparing to go to London on special embassy, he had his cousin Thomas Erskine, one of the heroes of the Gowrie conspiracy, remain behind to be sure Home attempted nothing prejudicial to Mar's interests while he was gone. Only Home had the courage and tact to discuss with James the rumours of Queen Anne's possible involvement with Gowrie. When the royal couple's baby son died in June 1602 Home brought the body quietly at night to Holyrood Abbey for burial&#151;neither parent was there&#151;and then rode off to Dunfermline to comfort the king. He was not one of those officially involved in James's private correspondence with Robert Cecil in the last years of Elizabeth's reign, but he could foresee what would happen, and knew that it would pay him to have a good reputation among English officials. So he cultivated Nicolson, who in 1595 used him to urge James to write to Elizabeth about the situation in Ireland; he was helpful, wrote Nicolson, in keeping aid from going to the Irish rebels. Nicolson regularly praised him as &#145;a very good instrument for the peace and amity&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1595&#150;7</i>, 39&#150;40), and as regularly pointed out his closeness to the king: he followed James's wishes absolutely, &#145;so dutiful and observing of the king is he&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1597&#150;1603</i>, 924). His power was steadily growing; in July 1602 Nicolson wrote that Home and Comptroller David Murray of Gospertie, his colleague in the financial administration, were the dominant figures in the government.<h2>
<a name="Theunionofthecrowns"></a>The union of the crowns</h2>When James succeeded to the English throne Home and Murray loaned him large sums to pay the expenses of his journey south. And they accompanied James, along with many others. Most of the officials in James's entourage eventually returned to Scotland; Home did not. His power depended on personal contact with the king, and he was determined not to relinquish it. James wanted him to stay; he appointed Home to the English privy council, made him keeper of the great wardrobe, put him in charge of Norham Castle, raised him to the English peerage as Baron Home of Berwick on 7 July 1604, and in the spring of 1608 made him a knight of the Garter. Home established an excellent working relationship with Sir Robert Cecil, and in effect acted as James's principal gatekeeper: access to the king could be most readily obtained through him. Perhaps in anticipation of the successful conclusion of the union he had so much at heart, James also made Home chancellor of the exchequer, one of two Scots named to an English governmental office. The appointments were widely resented, especially as Scots monopolized those positions, such as bedchamber posts, that involved personal access to the king. In 1606 Home, who on 3 July 1605 became earl of Dunbar in the Scottish peerage, stepped down from his English office.<br>
<br>Dunbar took no part in the union negotiations of 1604. In the first two years after his removal to London he concentrated on another cause dear to James's heart: improved law and order in Scotland, especially on the borders. James could now afford a police force; Dunbar's ally, Comptroller Murray, was authorized to raise one. A separate border police was established in 1605, as was a joint Anglo-Scottish commission of justiciary. There were complaints on both sides of lack of co-operation; finally, in December 1606, James appointed Dunbar as chief of a revamped border commission with virtually full power to reorganize border administration and crack down on malefactors. Dunbar's crackdown was savage and efficient, so much so that his police chief, Sir William Cranston, was almost lynched in Dumfries. But by August 1609, following a mass hanging at Dumfries&#151;one of several over which Dunbar had presided in the previous three years&#151;Lord Chancellor Dunfermline could write to James comparing Dunbar's work to Hercules's cleansing of the Augean stables. His task was facilitated by the existence after 1608 of a refuge in the Ulster plantations for border reivers on the run from Cranston's police. By the time of Dunbar's death in 1611, writes one authority, &#145;there was no more Borderland in the old, wild, independent sense of the word&#146;  (Fraser, 327).<br>
<br>That Dunbar rather than one of the Edinburgh-based members of the privy council was put in charge of the borders was not surprising. By 1606 he had prevailed over Dunfermline, the head of the administration in Edinburgh, in their rivalry for the position of James's principal agent for Scottish business in the wake of the failed plans for Anglo-Scottish union. Once again Dunbar profited from circumstances not of his own making: Dunfermline's mishandling of an act of defiance by a group of ministers, who insisted on holding an unauthorized general assembly in 1605 in spite of a royal prohibition. James was very angry, and sent Dunbar north to deal with the ringleaders. In January 1606 six of the ministers were tried for treason and convicted by a jury packed with Dunbar's kinsmen which, even so, had to be bullied into its verdict. Dunbar returned to court to report and, if possible, to undermine the king's confidence in Dunfermline. In May 1606 Dunbar returned to Scotland to conduct a hearing that might have led to the chancellor's dismissal. Dunfermline saved himself, but had lost the power struggle. Dunbar's victory was facilitated by the technique he developed for exercising his influence: he travelled. From 1606 on he went back and forth between James's court and Scotland, as often as was necessary. When in Scotland he employed a combination of abruptness, violence, and distribution of favours which stimulated the fear and the greed of the Scottish political class. The method was extremely effective: Dunbar's appearances in Edinburgh had something of the impact of a royal visit.<h2>
<a name="Therevivalofepiscopacy"></a>The revival of episcopacy</h2>Dunbar was first, last, and always the courtier. He had no discernible views on public issues: what James wanted, he wanted. So he concentrated on James's priorities: the union, about which he could do little save to advise the passage of a parliamentary act prohibiting anti-English speeches, plays, and other writings; law and order; and the reimposition of the power of the bishops in the Scottish church. The first step toward the achievement of the last goal was taken in parliament in July 1606, with the repeal of the 1587 act of annexation of the temporalities of benefices to the crown, an action accompanied by lavish rewards to many members of the landed classes, and ratifications of their existing possessions, in order to allay their fears for their own holdings of church property. For the clergy there was the creation of a commission to improve clerical stipends. Dunbar was instrumental in implementing James's decision to exile his principal clerical opponents, including Andrew and James Melville, and the six ministers convicted of treason.<br>
<br>The next step was to convene a clerical conference in Linlithgow in December 1606, ostensibly to deal with Catholics and increase clerical harmony. Dunbar, amply provided with cash, went north to manage it&#151;his third trip of the year. He got the gathering to accept the king's proposal that each presbytery should have a permanent moderator appointed by the king. On being assured that this was a temporary measure, the gathering accepted it. When the record of the meeting emerged a few months later, however, it had been altered to declare that the meeting had been a general assembly, and that synods as well as presbyteries were to have constant moderators, namely, the bishops. Under pressure the synods and presbyteries, one by one, accepted this, and so did a properly convened general assembly in July 1608. Dunbar once again managed the meeting. He was accompanied north by his chaplain, George Abbot, and another English cleric &#145;to persuade the Scots that there was no substantial difference in religion betwixt the two realms&#146;  (Calderwood, 6.735). In January 1609 a convention of estates adopted a series of measures against Catholics and authorized the bishops to enforce them; in June parliament restored the bishops' jurisdiction over commissary courts; in February 1610 James created courts of high commission in the two archiepiscopal provinces, in imitation of England. Finally, in June 1610 a general assembly held at Glasgow approved the restoration of episcopal authority, subject only to the power of the assembly to censure or deprive a bishop, with the king's consent&#151;if the assembly ever met again: there was no guarantee that it would. Dunbar managed all these meetings with his usual combination of intimidation and bribery. When parliament ratified the actions of the Glasgow assembly in 1612, after Dunbar's death, there was no mention of episcopal accountability to the assembly. Thanks to James's determination and Dunbar's tactical skills diocesan episcopacy returned to Scotland after a lapse of fifty years.<h2>
<a name="Thefinalyears"></a>The final years</h2>With the question of episcopacy on its way to solution, Dunbar tightened his grip on power by a reorganization of the privy council. In February 1610 it was reduced substantially in size, and Dunbar swept out virtually all the judges of the court of session save those who were also officials: as lawyers they were more apt to be Dunfermline's allies than his. In August 1610 Dunbar took advantage of the death of the comptroller to combine that office with his own, thus monopolizing financial authority. Two months later he and Dunfermline persuaded James to approve a plan to revise customs rates and end free trade with England in order to increase the crown's income. Dunbar's power in Scotland was at its apogee when he suddenly died, at Whitehall, on 20 January 1611. There was evidence that he was beginning to interest himself in English politics, with the decline in the influence of Robert Cecil, now earl of Salisbury, after the failure of the &#145;great contract&#146; in the previous year. He recommended his former chaplain, Bishop George Abbot of London, for the vacant archbishopric of Canterbury; James made the appointment two months after Dunbar's death. After a funeral service at Westminster in April 1611 Dunbar's body was sent back to Scotland for burial in Dunbar collegiate church, where a splendid monument was raised to his memory.<br>
<br>There were no more earls of Dunbar. With his wife Elizabeth Gordon, whom he married in 1590, George Home had two daughters. The elder, Anne, married Sir James Home of Whitrig; their son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13644/', "James Home")</script> succeeded to the earldom of Home in 1633. The younger daughter, Elizabeth, married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13938/', "Theophilus Howard")</script>, the heir of Thomas Howard, first earl of Suffolk, one of Salisbury's political allies. Calderwood, who detested Dunbar for his role in restoring episcopacy, rejoiced that he died before he could occupy his &#145;sumptuous and glorious palace&#146; in Berwick:<blockquote>But the curse was executed upon him that was pronounced upon the builders of Jericho. He &hellip; left nothing undone to overthrow the discipline of our church &hellip; But none of his posterity enjoyeth a foot broad of land this day of his conqueist in Scotland. (Calderwood, 7.153)</blockquote>Even Archbishop Spottiswoode was hardly effusive:<blockquote>a man of deep wit, few words, and in his majesty's service no less faithful than fortunate. The most difficult affairs he accomplished without any noise, and never returned when he was employed without the work performed that he was sent to do. (<span class="italic">History of the Church</span>, 3.214)</blockquote>What can be said of Dunbar is that during his years of power Scotland saw greater change than at any other time in James's twenty-two years of absentee rule. There is a splendid portrait, painted in his last years, in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery.<br>
