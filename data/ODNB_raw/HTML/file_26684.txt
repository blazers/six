<span class="headword">Strutt,  Joseph</span>  (1749&#150;1802), <span class="occ">antiquary and engraver</span>, was born on 27 October 1749 at Springfield Mill, near Chelmsford, Essex, the youngest of five children of Thomas Strutt (<i>d</i>. 1751), a wealthy miller, and his wife, Elizabeth (1727&#150;1780), daughter of John Ingold, also a miller, of Woodham Walter, near Maldon. Only one brother, John, survived beyond infancy. Thomas Strutt died of smallpox when Joseph was not yet two. Joseph was educated at King Edward VI School, Chelmsford, and in 1764 was apprenticed to the engraver William Wynne Ryland, and moved to the latter's workshop in London. On 30 January 1769 he entered the newly established Royal Academy Schools, and in the first of the school's annual competitions, held in that year, took a silver medal for a drawing from the antique. Two years later, in December 1771, he won the gold medal for two oil paintings on classical themes. Despite these early successes and the fact that he exhibited work at the Royal Academy during the 1780s Strutt cannot claim any real distinction as a painter, for his real achievements lay in his work as an antiquary.<br>
<br>Strutt's first employment was with Foote Gower, the Essex antiquary, who commissioned him to complete a series of engravings of Roman antiquities. Through Gower he was introduced to Richard Gough, who was almost certainly responsible for securing him access to the British Museum in 1771. There he became acquainted with the collections of manuscripts and illuminated books, and conceived a series of antiquarian works drawing primarily on these visual sources that was to represent the majority of his subsequent published output. The first, <span class="italic">The Regal and Ecclesiastical Antiquities of England</span> (1773), owed its initial inspiration to Montfaucon's <span class="italic">Monuments de la monarchie fran&ccedil;oise</span>, and was the first book of its kind to be published in England. It was essentially a series of engraved portraits, illustrative of the English monarchs, drawn entirely from contemporary sources. Its aim, according to the preface, was to encourage artists to be more accurate in their representation of historic dress. In the same year Louis Dutens published the first of his three volumes on ancient coins, with engravings by Strutt, but by this time Strutt was devoting himself almost entirely to antiquarian subjects. His next work, <span class="italic">Horda-Angel-Cynnan: the Manners and Customs, Arms and Habits of the Inhabitants of England</span>, published in three volumes between 1774 and 1776, drew on an even wider range of manuscript sources&#151;from the British Museum, Lambeth Palace Library, the Bodleian Library, and Oxford and Cambridge college libraries.<br>
<br>Both these early publications were well received in most quarters, which encouraged Strutt to venture upon a third publication, <span class="italic">The Chronicle of England</span>, a more ambitious work, with fewer engravings, intended as a work of reference rather than a narrative history. Six volumes had been initially projected but only the first two were published (1777&#150;8). Together they covered the history of England from the Roman period to the end of the Saxon heptarchy. Strutt drew heavily on illustrated manuscript sources again, but the <span class="italic">Chronicle</span> inevitably contained much material similar to that of his earlier volumes. It also suffered from competition with other historical publications, in particular Robert Henry's <span class="italic">History of Great Britain</span> (1771&#150;93), which laid a similar emphasis on manners and customs. Reviewers were also critical of the style in which it was written.<br>
<br>While engaged on these projects in the early 1770s Strutt resided partly in London and partly in Chelmsford, but following his marriage, on 16 August 1774, to Ann Blower (1754&#150;1778) of Bocking, Essex, he took a house in Duke Street, Portland Place, London. Three children were born to the couple: two sons, Joseph and <a href="#cosubject_26689">William Thomas [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and a daughter, Elizabeth Ann, born on 24 August 1778. Ann Strutt died on 15 September 1778, soon after giving birth to her daughter, who survived her mother by only a few months. The following year Strutt published, anonymously, a short elegiac poem to his wife's memory.<br>
<br>Following the death of his wife and the disappointing reception to the <span class="italic">Chronicle</span> Strutt appears to have abandoned his literary and antiquarian researches to engage in more lucrative work; he exhibited nine paintings at the Royal Academy between 1778 and 1785 and produced several of his best stipple engravings&#151;using the style introduced into England from the continent by his master, Ryland. After the death of his brother, John, an eminent physician in Westminster, in 1784 Strutt shared his home with his widowed sister-in-law until he retired, to Bacon's farm, Bramfield, Hertfordshire, in 1790. In 1785&#150;6 he published the two volumes of his <span class="italic">Biographical Dictionary of Engravers</span>, a historical account of the art of engraving and of engravers from the earliest time to his own day that has remained the basis of all later studies of a similar kind. He continued to produce engravings, including thirteen, after designs by Thomas Stothard, for John Bradford's edition of <span class="italic">The Pilgrim's Progress</span> (published 1792). He also established a day-school and Sunday school in the nearby village of Tewin, where the local manor house, Queenhoo Hall, served as the inspiration for his posthumously published historical novel of the same name.<br>
<br>In 1795, with his health and finances slightly improved, Strutt returned to London and resumed his antiquarian researches. From this time onwards he undertook almost no engraving work that was not intended to illustrate his own books. <span class="italic">A Complete View of the Dresses and Habits of the People of England</span> was published by subscription in two volumes (1796 and 1799); this was the first detailed, illustrated, and properly sourced history of dress in England. It was followed in 1801 by <span class="italic">The Sports and Pastimes of the People of England</span> (1801). Both volumes concentrated chiefly on the medieval period. Strutt's antiquarian learning was considerably more advanced by this time but his emphasis was always on the engravings as the primary source of information in a period that was so notoriously barren of literary sources.<br>
<br>Strutt next conceived the idea of using his antiquarian knowledge to write a historical novel set in the reign of Henry VI, but did not live to complete it. After his death the unfinished manuscript was acquired by the publisher John Murray, who asked Walter Scott to prepare it for publication. Scott added a final chapter, bringing it to a rather abrupt and inelegant conclusion, and the book was eventually published in 1808. Intended by Strutt as a lively means of conveying information about the past, <span class="italic">Queen-Hoo Hall: a Romance of Ancient Times</span> is unsuccessful as a work of fiction; it lacks a coherent plot and the language is deliberately archaic. However, it sheds valuable light on the author's life, as it is substantially autobiographical, and was later acknowledged by Scott to have been influential in inspiring him to complete <span class="italic">Waverley</span>.<br>
<br>Strutt died, of an inflammation of the bowel, on 16 October 1802 at his home in Charles Street, Hatton Garden, London, and was buried on 20 October in the churchyard of St Andrew's, Holborn. When alterations were later made to the Farringdon Street viaduct his remains were disinterred and transferred to the city cemetery in Ilford, Essex. He did not die a rich man. By his own account he managed his financial affairs badly. His antiquarian works were unremunerative in his own lifetime and there seems little doubt that, had he pursued a career in engraving exclusively, he might have enjoyed greater affluence. He suffered from chronic asthma for much of his life and became increasingly corpulent, as is evident from a late portrait of him by Ozias Humphry in the National Portrait Gallery (no. 323).<br>
<br>Strutt may justifiably be regarded as the first serious historian of dress in England, and his pioneering works of scholarship were heavily drawn upon by nineteenth-century costume historians. Unlike many of his contemporaries, who doubted the reliability of artistic sources as historical evidence, he employed a comparative analysis of the manuscripts, showing that they were reliable indicators of changes not just in matters of dress but also of the &#145;manners and customs&#146; of the time. He was one of the first to realize the potential value of visual material as a historical source rather than as simply serving an illustrative purpose. He showed an early appreciation of the intrinsic merit of medieval art and was unusual in producing near-facsimile engraved reproductions of the originals. Antiquaries such as Richard Gough were critical of his antiquarian scholarship but appreciated the quality of his engravings. In his own lifetime <span class="italic">Manners and Customs</span> was probably the most successful of his antiquarian works (there were two subsequent editions, in 1779 and 1793) but <span class="italic">Sports and Customs</span> has enjoyed greater longevity and has been frequently reprinted, one edition appearing in 1973.<br>
<br>Strutt left two sons. The elder, <a name="cosubject_26685"></a><span class="headword">Joseph Strutt</span>  (1775&#150;1833)<span class="occ"></span>, was born on 28 May 1775. He was apprenticed to the printer John Nichols and later became librarian to the duke of Northumberland. He edited some of his father's posthumous works and contributed a biographical memoir of his life to Nichols's <span class="italic">Literary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century</span> (1812). He died on 12 November 1833 at Isleworth, Middlesex, leaving a widow and a large family.<br>
<br>Strutt's younger son, <a name="cosubject_26689"></a><span class="headword">William Thomas Strutt</span>  (1777&#150;1850)<span class="occ"></span>, was born on 7 March 1777. He held a position in the Bank of England but was also a miniature painter of some repute. He died on 22 February 1850, leaving several sons, two of whom, Arthur and William, were also painters.<br>
