<span class="headword">Cremer, Sir  William Randal</span>  (1828&#150;1908), <span class="occ">peace campaigner</span>, born on 18 March 1828 at Fareham, Hampshire, was the son of George Cremer, a coach-painter, and his wife, Harriet Tutte, daughter of a local builder. Deserted by her husband, Cremer's mother, a devout Methodist, brought up William in great poverty.<br>
<br>At the age of twelve Cremer began work as a pitchboy in a shipyard. Three years later he was apprenticed to a carpenter. In 1846 he moved to Brighton, where he came under the influence of Frederick Robertson at his Workmen's Institute. In 1852 Cremer moved to London as a carpenter and became involved in politics and trade unionism. A good speaker, he campaigned for the nine-hour day as representative of the building trades committee in 1858, and he led the lock-out of 70,000 men in 1859&#150;60. Out of this dispute Cremer helped found both the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners, on 4 June 1860, and the London Trades Council. In that year he married Charlotte (<i>d</i>. August 1876), daughter of J. Wilson of Spalding.<br>
<br>Cremer was secretary to the workmen's committee formed to support the north in the American Civil War, and organized the 1863 meeting in St James's Hall, addressed by John Bright, which attacked the British government's role in the <i>Alabama</i> affair. He was appointed the first secretary of the British section of the International Working Men's Association (IWMA) in September 1864 and was a delegate to its 1865 Geneva conference. Although he supported the general council on the questions of unionism, strikes, and the eight-hour day and in its opposition to the Proudhonists, Cremer also opposed any revolutionary activity and Marx effected his removal from the secretaryship. Cremer left the organization, though in 1869 he urged the delegates at the second Trades Union Congress to affiliate with it and the same year joined the IWMA-dominated Land and Labour League.<br>
<br>Cremer was a supporter of Mazzini and helped to organize the 1863 demonstrations in support of Garibaldi; he also addressed a meeting in London in July 1863 in support of Polish nationalism and in 1870 formed a committee of working men to press for British neutrality during the Franco-Prussian War. This committee became the Workmen's Peace Association in 1871 (later the International Arbitration League). Cremer was its secretary until his death, and he travelled on its behalf repeatedly to America and the continent, bearing petitions and appeals for international arbitration, and becoming a well-known international figure as a consequence. He was also on the executive of John Stuart Mill's Land Tenure Reform Association in 1873 and in 1889 became British secretary to the Inter-Parliamentary Union. For his tireless service in the cause of international arbitration (especially the 1897 Anglo-American arbitration treaty) he was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1903 and gave &pound;7000 of the prize money in trust to the International Arbitration League. For his work in the cause of peace he also received the French cross of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur, was made commander of the Norwegian order of St Olaf in 1904, and was knighted in 1907.<br>
<br>A political radical, Cremer was a member of the Reform League from its inception in 1864, though also supportive of the National Reform Union and the reform bills of 1866&#150;7, and as an executive committee member of the league he was a moving force behind the 1866 Hyde Park demonstrations. In 1868 he accepted an invitation to stand as radical parliamentary candidate for Warwick. He was defeated by the Liberal candidate, but received only 260 votes and lost there again as representative of the Labour Representation League in 1874, when he won only 183 votes. Twice he failed in his candidature for the London school board, in 1870 and 1873; but in 1884 he was elected to the St Pancras vestry. Under the widened parliamentary franchise Cremer was elected MP for the working-class Haggerston division of Shoreditch in 1885. He retained his seat in 1886 and 1892, but was defeated in 1895 by thirty-two votes. He recovered the seat in 1900 despite his unpopular hostility to the South African War, and kept it until his death. He vigorously opposed the rise of the independent labour movement and remained within the Liberal Party. Cremer was never endorsed by the Trades Union Congress or the Labour Representation Committee and let his membership of the carpenters' union lapse after it affiliated to the Labour Party. However, he continued to campaign on labour issues in parliament.<br>
<br>Following the death in August 1884 of his second wife, Lucy Coombes of Oxford, Cremer lived in his office at 11 Lincoln's Inn Fields. He died at 59 Weymouth Street, London, on 22 July 1908, and was buried in Hampstead cemetery after cremation. He had no children. Cremer's autobiography remained in manuscript note form and his literary work was confined to the pages of <span class="italic">The Arbitrator</span>, a monthly peace journal which he edited from its appearance in 1889.<br>
