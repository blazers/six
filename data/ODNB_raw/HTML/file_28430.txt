<span class="headword">Walcot, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1629&#150;1685), <span class="occ">judge and politician</span>, was the second of the three sons of <a name="cosubject_28429"></a><span class="headword">Humphrey Walcot</span>  (1586&#150;1650)<span class="occ"></span> of Walcot, Shropshire, and Anne (<i>d</i>. 1675), daughter of Thomas Docwra of Putteridge, Hertfordshire. Humphrey Walcot, presumably the son and heir of Humphrey Walcot (<i>d</i>. 1616?), matriculated from Clare College, Cambridge, at Easter 1604. He was receiver of Shropshire in 1625 and high sheriff in 1634. Thomas was born at Walcot on 6 August 1629. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, on 16 May 1646 and the Middle Temple on 12 November 1647, being called to the bar on 25 November 1653. By that date his father, a distinguished royalist, had died, on 2 June 1650. In 1655 he seems to have come into possession of Bitterley Court, Shropshire, which he made his home. He married, on 10 December 1663, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1695), daughter of Sir Adam Littleton, first baronet, of Stoke St Milborough, Shropshire. They had one child, Thomas, who died as an infant, and the lack of an heir may account for Walcot's decision to sell Bitterley to his elder brother, John, in 1672, on condition that he could retain it as a residence until his death.<br>
<br>Walcot's first important judicial appointment came on 15 February 1662, when he was made attorney-general of Denbighshire and Montgomeryshire. In the same year he became a freeman of Ludlow. In 1671 he became recorder of Bewdley, Worcestershire, a post he held until his death, and on 11 November 1671 he became a bencher of the Middle Temple. In April 1676 Walcot was appointed second justice of the north Wales circuit and a member of the council in the marches of Wales. As a Welsh judgeship did not preclude a Westminster legal practice, he continued to pursue his career as a barrister in London. Walcot was elected to parliament for Ludlow on 23 September 1679. He was created a serjeant-at-law in May 1680, his patrons being his brother-in-law, Sir Thomas Littleton, second baronet, and the lord chief justice of common pleas, Sir Francis North. On 21 November 1681 Walcot was knighted and became chief justice of north Wales, which he retained until his appointment as a judge in king's bench on 22 October 1683. In the interim, on 19 July 1683 he had been granted the king's licence to act as a justice of assize in his native county <i>non obstante statuto</i>. The earl of Danby described him as &#145;much at the devotion&#146; of the duke of York, and he presided over the trials of Thomas Rosewell, Titus Oates, Algernon Sidney, and Sir Thomas Armstrong. Walcot was reappointed to the bench on the accession of James II, but he died in York on 6 September 1685 and was buried on the 8th at Bitterley. Litigation from Armstrong's widow revealed that Walcot had died intestate and insolvent. His widow was buried at Ludlow on 1 December 1695.<br>
