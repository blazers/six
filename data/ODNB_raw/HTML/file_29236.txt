<span class="headword">White,  Andrew</span>  (1579&#150;1656), <span class="occ">Jesuit and missionary in America</span>, was born of Catholic parents in London. Two brothers, whose identities are not known, became priests. In April 1593 White matriculated at the English College at Douai and during the academic year 1594&#150;5 he studied at the English Jesuit college at St Omer. On 1 November 1595 he was received at the English College at Valladolid and he transferred in 1596 to the English College at Seville, where he completed his theological studies. Ordained most likely in 1604, White arrived in Douai on 4 June after visiting his two brothers in Lorraine. He crossed to England where he worked for two years, but returned to Douai on 24 July 1606, one of forty-nine Catholics expelled as a result of the Gunpowder Plot. On 1 February 1607 he joined the Society of Jesus at the recently opened English novitiate in Louvain. Shortly after his first vows on 2 February 1609, he returned to Valladolid; in 1611 he was assigned to Seville, where he remained for four years.<br>
<br>White was professor of theology or of sacred scripture (perhaps both), at the English Jesuit school of theology in Louvain from 1617 until 1619, but before 13 June 1619 he returned to London, where he pronounced his final vows. In 1622 he resumed his position as professor in Louvain, moving with the theologate to Li&egrave;ge in 1624. In spite of his being a prominent theologian and a lauded professor, well-versed in the humanities and in Hebrew, White's academic career ended in 1629 because of his rigorously conservative adherence to Thomas Aquinas. According to a Jesuit catalogue for that year, White had an excellent intellect and good judgement, but mediocre prudence. In the summer of 1629 he returned to England, where he worked first in London and then in Hampshire in 1630&#150;32.<br>
<br>In early 1629, before his departure from Li&egrave;ge, White had volunteered for the North American missions, in which, despite his melancholic temperament, he was most competent to teach and to work. In November 1633 he was appointed superior of the three Jesuits sent to found the Maryland mission. In three extant works, &#145;Relatio itineris in Marylandiam&#146;, addressed to the Jesuit superior-general in April/May of 1634, &#145;A briefe relation of the voyage unto Maryland&#146;, and &#145;Declaratio coloniae&#146;  (in E. A. Dalrymple, ed., <span class="italic">Relatio itineris in Marylandiam</span>, 1874, 10&#150;43), White described the journey and the colony both for his religious superior and for future colonists. White studied the native languages of the American Indians, and received the king of the Piscateway and his family into the Roman church. Unfortunately his dictionary, grammar, and catechism in the Timuquana language are no longer extant, but a few pages of prayers and commandments translated into Conoy, the language of the Piscateway, are preserved in the archives of the Maryland province of the Society of Jesus at Georgetown University, Washington, DC. White remained superior of the mission until 1638 and ministered both to the indigenous peoples and the settlers until he and Thomas Copley (alias Philip Fisher) were captured by English soldiers in early 1644 and sent back to England in chains. Charged with high treason because they were in England in violation of an Elizabethan statute (27 Eliz. c. 2), they pleaded that they were forcibly carried into the realm and held against their wills.<br>
<br>After his acquittal White was expelled and went to Antwerp where he arrived in March 1648. Either before or immediately after his arrival, he was involved in the controversy surrounding the &#145;three propositions&#146;, a Roman Catholic attempt to win toleration from the Independents in 1647&#150;8. White sided with the Catholic party negotiating with the Independents and wrote in their defence. Rome declared the propositions unacceptable and repudiated the agreement. After a very brief stay in Antwerp, White returned to England and is listed as working in Derbyshire in 1648 and London in 1649. By 1651 he worked in the Residence of St Thomas of Canterbury, Hampshire, where he remained for the rest of his life; he died, probably in Hampshire, on 6 January 1656.<br>
