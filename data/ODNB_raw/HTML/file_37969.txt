<span class="headword">Sisson,  Jeremiah</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1720, <em>d.</em> 1783/4), <span class="occ">maker of mathematical instruments</span>, was born in London and baptized at the Presbyterian chapel in Carter Lane, Blackfriars, on 14 December 1720, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37970/', "Jonathan Sisson")</script>, also a maker of mathematical instruments. By 1740 he was one of his father's workmen. According to the French astronomer Joseph de Lalande, writing in 1763, the elder Sisson was so infirm in his last years that it was Jeremiah who actually made the large mural quadrants for the observatories of Bologna, Paris, and Pisa, and for George Parker, second earl of Macclesfield.<br>
<br>When his father died in June 1747, Jeremiah took over a thriving business and the premises at the corner of Beaufort Buildings, Strand. Though his reputation as a craftsman equalled, if not exceeded, his father's, as a businessman he was a failure, being declared bankrupt in 1751. Lalande wrote of him in 1763:<blockquote>Sisson has been several times in prison for failing to pay his workmen; he starts many things and finishes nothing: he takes his instruments to the pawnbroker, where they have been seen selling for a tenth of their value. He is obliged to work in great haste, and so achieves nothing worthwhile, but nevertheless there is no one who has as much ability as he.</blockquote>Though Sisson's main stock-in-trade was probably small surveying and drawing instruments, it was his large astronomical instruments that made his reputation. He made the zenith sector that Nevil Maskelyne took to St Helena in 1761; all the larger instruments for the king's private observatory at Kew; and instruments for St John's College in Cambridge, Naples, Geneva, Milan, and Mitau in Latvia. In 1759 he prepared drawings and a model of a water-pump to be sent to Italy. In 1772 he was appointed mathematical instrument maker to the Board of Ordnance. His duties included the servicing of the instruments at the Royal Greenwich Observatory and making two new equatorial sectors.<br>
<br>In 1775 Sisson was again declared bankrupt and lost the ordnance appointment. However, Maskelyne, who had a high opinion of his abilities, lent him considerable sums and secured for him commissions for instruments, not only for his own observatory at Greenwich, but also for new instruments for Eger in Hungary, Mannheim, and Florence. Then, in 1780, Sisson was forced to vacate his premises in Beaufort Buildings and to make over the lease and mortgage of his house in Southwark to Maskelyne.<br>
<br>Of Sisson's first marriage nothing is known, but he was described as a widower when he married Ann Sidebotham at St Clement Danes on 1 January 1761, and again when he married Grace Plampin at St Anne's, Soho, on 14 February 1774. Of his death, the only reference found is the entry in Maskelyne's account book for 13 March 1784: &#145;Recd of Mrs Grace Sisson, thro' the hands of Mr Henry Robin Auctioneer my dividend for &pound;88.14.11 due to me from the Estate of the late Jerh Sisson&#151;&pound;15.0.0&#151;and gave it to the Widow.&#146;<br>
