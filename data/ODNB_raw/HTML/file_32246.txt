<span class="headword">Calkin,  John Baptiste</span>  (1827&#150;1905), <span class="occ">organist and composer</span>, born in London on 16 March 1827, was the third son of the organist and teacher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4392/', "James Calkin (1786&#150;1862)")</script>. Reared in a musical atmosphere, he studied under his father, and when aged only nineteen was appointed organist, precentor, and choirmaster of St Columba's College, Rathfarnham, near Dublin, in succession to Edwin George Monk. St Columba's College was a school mainly for the boys of the upper classes and for candidates for the ministry of the Anglican church; music and the Irish language were prominent features in the curriculum. From 1846 to 1853 Calkin zealously maintained a high standard of choral music at St Columba's and began exploring his own powers of composition. From 1853 to 1863 he was organist and choirmaster of Woburn Chapel, London; from 1863 to 1868 organist of Camden Road Chapel; and from 1870 to 1884 organist at St Thomas's Church, Elm Road, Camden Town. In 1883 he became professor at the Guildhall School of Music under Thomas Henry Weist-Hill, and subsequently devoted himself to teaching and composing. He was on the council of Trinity College, London, a member of the Philharmonic Society (1862), and a fellow of the Royal College of Organists, incorporated in 1893.<br>
<br>As a composer, Calkin tried his hand at many forms, but his sacred music is best known, especially his morning and evening services in B[flat], G, and D, his <span class="roman">Te Deum in D</span>, and a <span class="roman">Magnificat in F</span>. He wrote various pieces for the organ, including numerous transcriptions, and he scored many string arrangements. Many of his anthems and hymn tunes gained an enduring popularity, while his setting of &#145;Fling out the Banner&#146; (by Bishop G. W. Doane) became well known in America and the colonies, and was included in the Canadian <span class="italic">Book of Common Praise</span>, edited by Sir George Martin in 1909. His &#145;Agape&#146; was composed specially for the <span class="italic">Church Hymnary</span> of Scotland in 1871, to the words &#145;Jesu, most loving God&#146;, and was inserted in the <span class="italic">Church Hymnal</span> of Ireland in 1874.<br>
<br>Calkin died at 37 Hornsey Rise Gardens, Crouch End, London, on 15 April 1905, and was buried in Highgate cemetery.<br>
