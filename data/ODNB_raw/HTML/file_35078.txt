<span class="headword">Montague,  Francis Charles</span>  (1858&#150;1935), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born at the York Hotel, Albemarle Street, Piccadilly, London, on 31 August 1858, the eldest son of Francis Montague (1815/16&#150;1893), formerly of Drogheda, and his wife, Rosa McCabe (1826/7&#150;1906), daughter of a Drogheda merchant. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35077/', "Charles Edward Montague")</script> was his younger brother. His parents had married at Brighton in June 1858, and his father, a Roman Catholic priest, had renounced his priesthood. The family settled in St Margaret's, Twickenham, and lived off independent means.<br>
<br>Montague was a precocious child, reputedly able to read Greek at the age of eight. From University College School and University College, London, he went to Balliol College, Oxford, as an exhibitioner in 1875. After gaining a first class in classical moderations (1877) and in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1879), he graduated BA and became a prize-fellow of Oriel College in 1881, having also been elected fellow of University College, London, in 1880. He then took up law as a profession and was called to the bar by Lincoln's Inn in 1883, but returned to Oxford in 1891. There he lectured on law and was later lecturer in modern history at Oriel (1893&#150;1927), simultaneously acting as professor emeritus of history at University College, London; he travelled regularly between Oxford and London to deliver his lectures. He also played an important part in the training of candidates for the Indian Civil Service (1892&#150;1920), and was curator of the Indian Institute from 1900 to 1913.<br>
<br>For about twenty years Montague maintained a steady output of historical publications, all of them judicious, accurate, and well written. Besides reviews, an elementary textbook on English constitutional history, and contributions to the <span class="roman">Cambridge Modern History</span>, he published an essay entitled <span class="italic">The Limits of Individual Liberty</span> (1885) and a <span class="italic">Life of Sir Robert Peel</span> (1888). He also edited Bentham's <span class="italic">Fragment on Government</span> (1891) and Macaulay's <span class="italic">Essays</span> (1903) and wrote volume 7 (the history of England in the Stuart period, 1603&#150;60) for Longman's <span class="italic">Political History of England</span> (1907). In 1930 he was elected an honorary fellow of Oriel and was considered one of the most gifted members of the common room society.<br>
<br>Montague was a widely read and cultured man, with much of the eighteenth century in his mind and outlook: he was a tolerant rationalist and a blameless epicurean. A self-absorbed scholar, he seems to have been unsuited not only to his first profession of law but also to that of teaching and lecturing, only enjoying the company of his best pupils. Perhaps it is not surprising that in later life he became something of a recluse. He died, unmarried, at his home, 177 Woodstock Road, Oxford, on 8 April 1935, and was buried at Wolvercote cemetery on 11 April.<br>
