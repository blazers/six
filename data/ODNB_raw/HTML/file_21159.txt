<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Palgrave,  William Gifford</span>  (1826&#150;1888), <span class="occ">traveller and diplomatist</span>, was born at 22 Parliament Street, Westminster, London, on 24 January 1826. He was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21157/', "Sir Francis Palgrave (1788&#150;1861)")</script>, founder of the Public Record Office, whose name had been Francis Cohen until in 1823 he converted to the Church of England before marrying and entering the legal profession. Palgrave's mother, formerly Elizabeth Turner, was the daughter of Dawson Turner, banker, of Great Yarmouth. Palgrave's three brothers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21158/', "Francis Turner Palgrave")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61689/', "Robert Harry Inglis Palgrave")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35366/', "Sir Reginald Palgrave")</script>, all achieved scholarly distinction.<br>
<br>Palgrave attended Charterhouse School (1838&#150;1844), where he won the gold medal for classical verse and became the school captain. He then went as a scholar to Trinity College, Oxford, gained a first in <i>literae humaniores</i> and a second in mathematics, and graduated in 1846. He went to India and in 1847 received a lieutenant's commission in the 8th Bombay regiment of native infantry. His prospects as an officer were reportedly good, but after two years he converted formally to Roman Catholicism and entered the Jesuit college, Madras. He was employed in its missionary work in southern India until the summer of 1853, when he went to Rome. Following his conversion, Palgrave changed his name to Cohen, a possible indication of the deep concern about identity&#151;whether racial, national, or religious&#151;that runs through much of his writing. He was also known by other names, including Michael Sohail, before he resumed the name Palgrave.<br>
<br>After studying in Rome, Palgrave went to Syria, in 1855, drawn to the Arab world by early impressions from reading the Arab romance <span class="italic">Antar</span>. For some years he was a successful missionary, particularly in the town of Zahlah, making many converts and founding numerous schools. He became so accustomed to Arab society that he could pass as a native of the Middle East without difficulty. In the Druse attacks on Christians in 1860&#150;61, Palgrave was nearly killed at the Damascus massacre; later he is reported to have organized the Christian defence of Zahlah. The Syrian mission being for the time disrupted, he returned to western Europe where Napoleon III obtained from him a report on the causes of the persecution of the Syrian Christians. He also visited England and Ireland, where he delivered fund-raising lectures on the Syrian massacres which were afterwards republished from newspaper reports, under the title <span class="italic">Four Lectures on the Massacres of the Christians in Syria</span> (1861).<br>
<br>With Vatican permission, Palgrave became a French agent. His first mission was to sound Halim Pasha about becoming viceroy of Egypt under French suzerainty; although that project failed, Palgrave used the opportunity to prepare plans for a French invasion of Syria from Egypt. His next mission was to report on the Arabian kingdoms of Ha&#146;il and Riyadh. For many years Arabia had remained closed to Europeans. Ha&#146;il had been penetrated by Europeans only once; Riyadh, never. Disguised as a Syrian Christian physician named Selim Abu Mahmoud al-&#146;Eis, Palgrave now undertook an adventurous journey across central Arabia, which he accomplished in 1862 and 1863, thereby becoming the first westerner to cross Arabia by an approximately diagonal route (from the north-west to the south-east). Travelling among the Wahabbis, he was in considerable danger, should he be detected as a European. Once, at Ha&#146;il, he was recognized as having been seen at Damascus, and at Riyadh he was suspected and accused of being an English spy, but his skill at disguise, coupled with his presence of mind and good fortune, secured his safety. Palgrave returned to Europe in late 1863 and wrote <span class="italic">Personal Narrative of a Year's Journey through Central and Eastern Arabia</span> (2 vols., 1865), a classic of Arabian travel literature, though its veracity has been attacked by several distinguished orientalists.<br>
<br>Shortly after writing <span class="italic">Personal Narrative</span> Palgrave renounced both Catholicism and Napoleon III and began his final career with the British foreign service. In July 1865 he was sent to Abyssinia on a mission to obtain from King Theodore the release of Consul Cameron and his fellow captives. Falsely informed that the captives had been released, the Foreign Office halted Palgrave as he was passing through Egypt on his way out. There he remained until June 1866, when he returned home and was at once appointed British consul at Soukhoum-Kal&eacute;. In 1867 he was transferred to Trebizond, where he made extensive journeys in northern Asia Minor.<br>
<br>In 1868 Palgrave married Katharine Simpson, daughter of G. E. Simpson of Norwich; they had three sons. He was appointed consul at St Thomas in the West Indies in 1873, and in 1876 he was transferred to Manila; two years later he was appointed consul-general in Bulgaria, but Disraeli soon dismissed him for his conduct towards the Austrians. In 1879 he was sent to Bangkok. While travelling in the Far East, he came under the influence of various Eastern religious systems, especially Shintoism.<br>
<br>Palgrave's diplomatic career disappointed many who expected him to rise higher and in different postings. General Gordon forcefully proposed him as British minister to Cairo, but to no avail. Palgrave himself yearned to serve in the Arab world, but his tendency to disregard instructions and to act on his own, which caused repeated conflicts with the Foreign Office, cannot have enhanced his prospects.<br>
<br>In 1884 Palgrave was appointed minister-resident in Uruguay, where he became reconciled to the Roman Catholic church. His health, which had been impaired by hardships on his return journey from Arabia and by the Siamese climate, did not improve in Uruguay, and he died of bronchitis at Montevideo on 30 September 1888. His body was brought to England and buried in St Thomas's cemetery, Fulham, London.<br>
<br>Palgrave's published writings were, in addition to those already mentioned: <span class="italic">Hermann Agha</span> (1872), <span class="italic">Essays on Eastern Questions</span> (1872), <span class="italic">Dutch Guiana</span> (1876), <span class="italic">Ulysses, or, Scenes and Studies in many Lands</span> (1887), and a mystical religious poem entitled <span class="italic">A Vision of Life: Semblance and Reality</span> (1891), with which he had been occupied almost until the time of his death. He wrote a number of notable articles for various periodicals, especially the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span>, <span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span>, <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span>, and the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>. He was a notable linguist, and acquired languages with extreme ease&#151;Japanese, for example, he learned colloquially in two months&#151;but his interest was not that of a philologist. He learned languages only for practical use; when he no longer required them he ceased to speak them. He was an accomplished student of Dante, a good Latin scholar, and something of a botanist; wherever he went, as his writings show, he was a keen observer. He became a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, a medallist of the French Geographical Society, and a member of the Royal Asiatic Society.<br>
<br>Many who have written about Palgrave have assessed his accomplishments with reservations, sensing some measure of failure. He may indeed have dispersed his efforts while leaving his potential unrealized, but expectations for him were always unusually high. He earned a permanent place as a leading British explorer and scholar of the Middle East.<br>
