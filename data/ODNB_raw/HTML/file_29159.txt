<span class="headword">Whalley,  John</span>  (1653&#150;1724), <span class="occ">astrologer and almanac writer</span>, was born on 20 April 1653. He arrived in Dublin in 1682, where he settled and&#151;with one interruption&#151;remained for the rest of his life. His first address was at the Golden Last on the Upper Comb, and from there, beginning in 1685, he produced an annual astrological almanac, which brought him increasing fame and notoriety. His almanac for 1685 was entitled <span class="italic">Vox Urani</span>, and its author named as &#145;Iatromathematicus&#146;; that for the following year <span class="italic">Syderus nuncius</span>. These and future editions not only provided the usual information regarding the year's astronomical events and their astrological implications, but advertised Whalley's services in &#145;physick and mathematicks&#146;&#151;that is, dispensing remedies for various ailments, analysing their course astrologically from the time of onset (&#145;decumbitures&#146;), and providing astrological advice in response to personal enquiries (&#145;horaries&#146;). He soon had a thriving business.<br>
<br>Whalley was a lifelong whig polemicist, whose vitriol against &#145;popery&#146; stands out even in an age much given to extreme political and religious rhetoric. Using his almanac for this purpose too, he recommended a price of &pound;5 on the heads of priests, and described Catholics as &#145;God-eating monsters, cannibals true&#146;. Such sentiments naturally made him highly unpopular with the Irish people, and he was attacked in a bitter satire, composed by Ferdaragh O'Daly, of twenty-one stanzas in Irish. The accession of James II left him in a dangerously exposed position, and he was publicly pilloried in Dublin in 1688, after which he retreated to England. While working as a coffee-house keeper, he managed to produce <span class="italic">England's Mercury, or, An Ephemeris</span> for at least 1688 and 1690&#150;92. In the dedication for the issue of 1690, he took care to emphasize his connections with Daniel Finch, the secretary of state.<br>
<br>Some time about 1692, Whalley returned to Dublin and settled at the sign of the Blew Post, next door to the Wheel of Fortune, on the west side of St Stephen's Green. He recommenced his annual almanac, now entitled <span class="italic">Mercurius Hibernicus</span>, for this year. About 1698 he moved to Nicholas Street, next door to The Fleece tavern.<br>
<br>In 1701 Whalley published <span class="italic">Ptolemy's Quadripartite, or, Four Books Concerning the Influence of the Stars</span> (2nd edn, 1786), the first English translation of Ptolemy's work, which attracted some notice. In the same year also appeared <span class="italic">An Appendix Concerning [the] Part of Fortune</span> and <span class="italic">A Treatise of Eclipses</span>. In descending order of importance, these constitute Whalley's chief contribution to the astrological tradition. But here, too, there is a polemical element. His <span class="italic">Quadripartite</span> was dedicated to the London astrologer John Partridge (along with a physician in Drogheda, Michael Cudmore), a radical whig and protestant like Whalley, and the acknowledged leader of a correspondingly radical movement in astrology&#151;a campaign to restore, in Whalley's words, the &#145;Truely Natural and Primitive Purity&#146; of Ptolemaic astrology, with its Aristotelian naturalism and rationalism. Their enemies were the customary magico-divinatory astrology of the common people (exemplified by horary) on the one hand, and on the other the efforts to reform astrology along Baconian lines, led by Anglican and crypto-Catholic astrologers (usually also associated, however loosely, with the Royal Society) like John Gadbury, George Parker, and Henry Coley. In his preface to the <span class="italic">Quadripartite</span> Whalley lashed the &#145;Adulterous Innovations [and] Scandalous Ridiculous Falsehoods&#146; of the reformers. The source of Whalley's <span class="italic">Appendix</span> was the monk and astrologer Placidus de Titis (1603&#150;1668), who had attempted the same Aristotelian reform of astrology in Italy, led, as he wrote, only by &#145;Ptolemy and reason&#146;. Partridge's and Whalley's efforts were later taken up by John Worsdale.<br>
<br>In practice, of course, Whalley was often obliged to provide the divinatory services that he decried in theory; for one thing, the birth times required for drawing up a Ptolemaically proper nativity were often not known. One of his several Dublin competitors, John Coats, was quick to point out the hypocrisy of Whalley's claims to sole rectitude in this respect.<br>
<br>In 1703 Whalley moved first to 1 Patrick Street, and then to Arundel Court, near St Nicholas's Gate (between St Nicholas Street and Patrick Street), at the sign of the Blue Ball. While continuing with his almanacs, he also produced, from 1714, a popular non-astrological broadsheet, <span class="italic">Whalley's News-Letter</span>. Given his talent for scandal and satirical abuse, this too was a success, and inspired many imitators.<br>
<br>Whalley's last almanac was for 1724. Having predicted &#145;a year of darkness&#146; on account of an eclipse, he died in April. It is only from his will that the existence of his wife and family is known: he named his &#145;beloved wife Mary&#146; as sole executor, and left to his eldest son his two volumes of <span class="italic">Salmon's Anatomy</span> and his mathematical books, and to a cousin his three volumes of <span class="italic">Bibliotheca medica chymigica</span>. His almanac was taken over by Isaac Butler, apparently his favourite apprentice, who continued to produce it until his own death.<br>
