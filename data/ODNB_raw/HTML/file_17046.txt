<span class="headword">Loveday,  John</span>  (1711&#150;1789), <span class="occ">antiquary and traveller</span>, was born on 5 February 1711 at Cateaton Street, London, the elder child of Thomas Loveday (1680&#150;1720) of Caversham and Feens and his wife, Sarah Lethieullier (1682&#150;1761), daughter of William Lethieullier of Clapham, a Turkey merchant, and his wife, Mary. His paternal grandfather, a successful London goldsmith who had bought the lease of the old rectory at Caversham in 1666, had left the family well off financially. In 1739 Loveday married Anna Maria Goodwin (1717&#150;1743), daughter of William Goodwin of Arlescote, near Edgehill. They had a son, <a href="#cosubject_17047">John [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and a daughter, Mary (1741&#150;1749). He married, secondly, in 1745, Dorothy Bagshaw (1709&#150;1755), daughter of Revd Harington Bagshaw of Bromley, Kent. His third marriage was in 1756 to Penelope Forrest (1723&#150;1801), daughter of Thomas Forrest of Jamaica. They had a son, Arthur (<i>d</i>. 1827), and three daughters: Penelope (1759&#150;1846), who married Revd William Benwell (1765&#150;1796) in 1796 and Revd John Hind (1759&#150;1882) in 1808; Sarah (1766&#150;1832); and Mary (1768&#150;1840), who remained single.<br>
<br>Loveday had been educated at Reading School, under the sympathetic supervision of H. J. Hiley. He matriculated at Oxford as a gentleman commoner of Magdalen College in 1728, graduated BA in 1731, and proceeded MA in 1734. On arrival at Oxford he called on the antiquary Thomas Hearne, with whom he had corresponded, volunteering information about St Anne's Chapel on Caversham Bridge. A lasting friendship was struck up, and Hearne described Loveday in his diary as &#145;an ingenious Gentleman [who] takes great delight in antiquities&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 9.402). Loveday became a youthful member of Hearne's antiquarian circle in Oxford. Until his death in 1735 the older man was supplied by the younger with information from churches and graveyards, both near and far. Loveday made many friends and enjoyed Oxford life so much that he kept rooms there for ten years. In the vacations he returned to Caversham but from 1730 began to travel further afield and, undeterred by the poor roads, made a number of extensive tours on horseback throughout the British Isles, often with one or two companions. He described in great detail the architecture and monuments of many cathedrals and churches and also visited numerous country houses. He noted the progress of new buildings and gardens and was especially interested in the paintings and sculpture. He recorded on loose papers over 100 tours and short visits between 1729 and 1765, to which he added references throughout his life. His only visit to Europe was in 1737, when he travelled through the Low Countries to Aachen. His &#145;Diary of a tour in 1732 through parts of England, Wales, Ireland and Scotland&#146; was published in 1890 by his great-grandson J. E. T. Loveday as a contribution to the Roxburghe Club.<br>
<br>Loveday was brought up and remained a deeply committed member of the Church of England, regularly attending Magdalen College chapel or St Mary the Virgin at Oxford, and St Peter's in Caversham. He adhered to high-church principles and was always a tory, but not an Oxford high-church tory in the political sense, as was Hearne. He bought and read books extensively, being particularly interested in church history. He assembled a fine library and a good collection of coins. His only publications were occasional articles for the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> under pseudonyms. He corresponded with many scholars, to whom he was always ready to give assistance. Thanking him for &#145;many useful corrections and excellent hints&#146;, Thomas Warton begged in vain for permission to disclose his name, arguing that &#145;the public have a right to know by whom they have been obliged&#146;  (Loveday MSS). In 1802 Charles Coates used his notes on Reading (<span class="italic">The History and Antiquities of Reading</span>, preface and text) and those on the margins of his copy of Wood's <span class="italic">Athenae Oxonienses</span> were used by Philip Bliss in his edition (preface, 14). Loveday always kept open house at Caversham. The &#145;old Tory country gentleman&#146; was described in a visit by Mary Berry in 1774 as &#145;an elegant and accomplished scholar&#146;  (<span class="italic">Extracts</span>, 1.9), and John Byng referred to the &#145;well-known hospitality &hellip; where learning and virtue grace the mansion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Torrington Diaries</span>, 1.195).<br>
<br>Loveday was short and slight in stature, but blessed with physical courage and stamina. He died at the old rectory, Caversham, on 16 May 1789 of an internal disorder, leaving between &pound;5000 and &pound;6000 in bank stock. He was buried at St Peter's Church, Caversham, on 22 May. His directions for his diaries, excluding the tours, to be burnt were eventually carried out by his grandson Thomas, after he had copied the major part.<br>

<a name="cosubject_17047"></a><span class="headword">John Loveday</span>  (1742&#150;1809), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, born at the old rectory, Caversham, on 11 November 1742, was also educated at Reading School and Magdalen College. He graduated BCL in 1766, was made DCL in 1771, and was admitted an advocate in Doctors' Commons in 1771. He retired in 1777 on his marriage to his ward Anne Taylor Loder (1756&#150;1837), daughter and heir of William Taylor Loder (<i>d</i>. 1772) of Williamscote, near Banbury, where they continued to live. They had four sons and a daughter. He assisted his friend Richard Chandler, and compiled the index for the <span class="italic">Marmora Oxonienses</span>. He contributed papers on antiquarian and orthographic subjects to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> and continued to correspond with many other British and foreign scholars. In 1788 he inherited Arlescote from his grandmother Abigail Goodwin. He succeeded to the Caversham property in 1789 and retained it until his sons left Reading School. He sold the lease in 1799 and transported the books and their presses to a new library wing he had built for them and his own at Williamscote. He died there of pneumonia on 4 March 1809 and on 11 March was buried at the church of St Mary the Virgin at Cropredy. Over 2000 volumes from his library were acquired by Pennsylvania State University in 1969.<br>
