<span class="headword">Fitzgerald,  Gerald  fitz Maurice</span>, third earl of Desmond  (1338?&#150;1398), <span class="occ">justiciar of Ireland and poet</span>, was born probably in 1338, one of the younger sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9646/', "Maurice fitz Thomas Fitzgerald, first earl of Desmond (c.1293&#150;1356)")</script>, and his second wife, Avelina, daughter of Nicholas Fitzmaurice. The eldest son, Maurice, had livery of the lands of the earldom in October 1357, but was drowned in the Irish Sea some time between 20 April and 5 June 1358; the next brother, Nicholas, was an idiot and on 3 July 1358 Gerald was appointed to the charge of his father's lands, and these were formally transferred to him, as third earl (though he is sometimes, wrongly, called fourth earl), on 20 July 1359, on condition that he would marry Eleanor, daughter of James Butler, second earl of Ormond, and also see to the food, clothing, and maintenance of Nicholas. The territory thus entrusted to him covered not only the palatinate of Kerry, but also lands in Limerick, Tipperary, Cork, and Waterford.<br>
<br>Predictably Desmond found himself charged with various governmental duties: he had already been summoned to a council in Waterford in March 1359; on 30 March 1363 he was appointed one of a number of commissioners to inquire into charges of corruption and oppression against royal officials in Ireland. He was appointed justiciar on 20 February 1367, an office which he held until 20 June 1369 and which he exercised with vigour, convening parliaments and holding pleas, the latter both in parliaments and elsewhere. Thereafter Desmond was involved in resisting attempts by Brian &Oacute; Briain, the native Irish ruler of Thomond from 1343 to 1375, to expand his territory, but had the misfortune to be captured by &Oacute; Briain in an encounter in Limerick on 10 July 1370; he was held captive for over a year on an island off the west coast and released late in 1371. This was probably not the first such incident in his life: there is evidence that as a teenager he had been a captive, in 1355 or 1356, of the Mac Con Mara family in Thomond. Nor was this the last of &Oacute; Briain's threats to Desmond's territory: another is recorded in the spring of 1372, when the earl was ordered to go into Limerick to resist him.<br>
<br>Throughout his career Desmond was involved in administration, as far as can be traced in the gapped documentation surviving from the Irish chancery. Although he refused to become justiciar in January 1382, following the death of the earl of March, he was regularly summoned to parliaments and councils, was a representative in Munster of the king's lieutenant and also a justice in Kerry from January 1386, and a <i>custos pacis</i> in Limerick and Kerry from December 1388, a commission expanded to include Cork from October 1391. During Richard II's Irish expedition of 1394&#150;5 he was ordered to assist the earl of Nottingham in his dealings with Art M&oacute;r Mac Murchadha of Leinster, and he may have negotiated with Brian &Oacute; Briain of Thomond before the latter did homage to the English king. At the same time, however, Desmond was regularly involved in disputes with others, one with members of the Burke family lasting from 1377 to 1381, when it was settled by a fortnight's arbitration. In December 1380 he and the second earl of Ormond were denounced at mass in Dublin Castle by Richard Wye, bishop of Cloyne, for their destructiveness&#151;possibly directed at one another, since a mediation session was held between Desmond and Ormond's successor in 1384, and another one followed in 1387. The disputes were probably over claims to the lordship of territories on the border between them.<br>
<br>What distinguishes Desmond from other Anglo-Irish lords of the time is his close links with the native Irish and his involvement in Irish literature. One Irish annalist wrote of him that he &#145;excelled all the English and many of the Irish in knowledge of Irish language, poetry and history&#146;  (McKisack, 233). Both he and his brother Maurice were among the patrons of Gofraidh Fionn &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh, one of the most eminent Irish poets of the century. Desmond sent one of his sons, James, to be fostered by Conchobhar &Oacute; Briain in 1388; and he was also a close friend of Diarmait Mac Carthaigh, lord of Muskerry in Cork. There survives in the <span class="roman">Book of Fermoy</span>, a later fifteenth-century manuscript, a copy of <span class="italic">Duanaire Ghear&oacute;id Iarla</span>, &#145;The poem-book of Earl Gerald&#146;, containing thirty short poems in Irish attributed to him. Each poem ends with a verse to the Virgin Mary and is couched in metres which by the standards of the time required little technical skill, suggesting that he lacked professional training, and was essentially imitating better qualified practitioners. However, these verses show a wide acquaintance with a number of native Irish tales and touch on a number of aspects of the earl's life: three poems deal with his captivity in 1370&#150;71; others refer to Diarmait Mac Carthaigh, both in the latter's lifetime and after his death in 1381; two of them refer to the death of Gerald's wife in 1392. Desmond himself died in 1398 and was succeeded by his eldest son, John Fitzgerald (<i>d</i>. 1400).<br>
