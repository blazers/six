<span class="headword">Waghorn,  Martin</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1787), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, from Deptford, had probably already been some years in the navy when, on 2 May 1756, he married Ann Marriott, at St Thomas's Church, Portsmouth; they had at least four children. On 16 December 1762 he was commissioned lieutenant on the <i>Manila</i> by Vice-Admiral Sir Samuel Cornish. This ship was one of the prizes taken after the British capture of Manila from Spain. In August 1763 he was appointed, again by Cornish, second lieutenant of the frigate <i>Liverpool</i>, and in her he returned to England.<br>
<br>Waghorn was put on half pay in November 1764 and during the long period which ensued before his next Royal Navy lieutenancy he served as first mate in the East India Company's <i>Ponsborne</i> and <i>Lioness</i>, on four voyages to India and China between 1768 and 1777. On 19 March 1778 he was appointed third lieutenant of the <i>Victory</i>, then fitting for the flag of Admiral Augustus Keppel; Waghorn became second lieutenant on 29 April, and then, on 13 May, second lieutenant of the <i>Prince George</i>. He returned to the <i>Victory</i>, as sixth lieutenant, on 16 February 1779, and remained with her until 15 August 1781, when he obtained his first command, the sloop <i>Fly</i>. On 6 April 1782 Waghorn was promoted captain of the <i>Royal George</i> (100 guns), in which Richard Kempenfelt, who may have known him in the East Indies, and was now a rear-admiral, hoisted his flag.<br>
<br>On 29 August 1782 the <i>Royal George</i> capsized and sank at Spithead while heeled to replace a blocked seacock. Waghorn, two lieutenants, and 330 men were saved, but his son William&#151;a midshipman on board&#151;was drowned, along with Admiral Kempenfelt, over 400 crewmen, and 360 women and children. Waghorn was exonerated by the court martial held on 7 September, it being concluded that there had been a structural failure in the ship's &#145;old and rotten&#146; frame. However, it now seems that she was simply swamped through her open larboard lower gun ports, through which large rum casks were being loaded; there was a failure of communication and of supervision by the officers; and the procedure should never have been attempted in the first place. For all this, Waghorn must share much of the blame with the admiral.<br>
<br>From September 1783 to July 1785 Waghorn was captain of Commodore Sir John Lindsay's flagship, <i>Trusty</i>, in the Mediterranean. He died on 17 December 1787, at Dover Place in Surrey, and was survived by at least two of his children: one daughter who died on 19 December 1798, and Eliza, who on 3 June 1799 married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2548/', "Captain Henry Blackwood (1770&#150;1832)")</script>.<br>
