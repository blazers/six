<span class="headword">Opp&eacute;,  Adolph Paul</span>  (1878&#150;1957), <span class="occ">art historian and art collector</span>, was born at 157 The Grove, Camberwell, London, on 22 September 1878, the third son of Siegmund Armin Opp&eacute;, a silk merchant, and his wife, Pauline Jaff&eacute;. His birth certificate gives his name as Adolphus Opp&eacute;. He was educated at Charterhouse School, at St Andrews University, and at New College, Oxford, where he took first classes in classical moderations (1899) and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1901). In 1902 Opp&eacute; was appointed assistant to the professor of Greek and then lecturer at St Andrews, and in 1904 lecturer in ancient history at Edinburgh University. In 1905 he entered the Board of Education. Except for two periods of secondment to the Victoria and Albert Museum (1906&#150;7 and 1910&#150;13) as deputy director, and war service in the Ministry of Munitions, he remained there until his retirement in 1938. He served the board as head of the branch dealing with the training of teachers and was appointed CB in 1937.<br>
<br>Apart from essays on classical subjects published while he was at St Andrews and Edinburgh, Opp&eacute;'s first writings were studies in Italian art: <span class="italic">Raphael</span> (1909; rev. edn 1970) and <span class="italic">Botticelli</span> (1911). After these, he wrote almost entirely on British subjects and helped to establish the study of British drawings on a sound and scholarly basis. He had collected drawings, both British and foreign, since 1904, starting with a beautiful early work by J. S. Cotman, and his interest had soon been caught by the then almost unstudied British watercolours of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. In 1910 he made the most remarkable of his discoveries in this field: he acquired for 25<i>s</i>. a lot of seventeen drawings by Francis Towne, including the artist's two masterpieces of the <span class="italic">Source of the Arveyron</span>. At that time they could be compared only with a practically unseen collection at the British Museum; but some years later a chance remark led Opp&eacute; to the Devon home of the Merivales who still owned the mass of Towne's drawings, which the artist himself had left to the family. These and some Merivale papers enabled Opp&eacute; in 1920 to establish this forgotten artist's position with an article in a Walpole Society volume.<br>
<br>In 1919, in the <span class="italic">Burlington Magazine</span>, Opp&eacute; had demolished the legend that Alexander Cozens was the son of Peter the Great. Under his iconoclastic pen many similar legends about British artists were to be shattered. It was typical of his painstaking quest for finality that he did not publish any book on Alexander Cozens until 1952 when his <span class="italic">Alexander and John Robert Cozens</span> embodied the researches of over forty years. In this, as in all his books, his criticism was enriched by his extensive knowledge of the art of other countries and by his classical scholarship. In addition to these works, Opp&eacute; published <span class="italic">Rowlandson</span> (1923), <span class="italic">Cotman</span> (1923), <span class="italic">Turner, Cox and de Wint</span> (1925), <span class="italic">The Drawings of Paul and Thomas Sandby at Windsor Castle</span> (1947), <span class="italic">Hogarth</span> (1948), and <span class="italic">English Drawings at Windsor Castle</span> (1950). He also wrote the section on art in <span class="italic">Early Victorian England</span> (1934), edited by G. M. Young. All these publications exhibited his terse style and exacting and uncompromising scholarship.<br>
<br>Opp&eacute; was a born collector. With a perceptive eye, he bought regardless of fashion at a time when drawings were still relatively cheap. His collection included, besides its British treasures, drawings by such masters as Fra Bartolommeo, Giovanni da Udine, Barocci, Veronese, Poussin, and Claude Lorrain. Over 3000 of the British drawings and watercolours from the collection were acquired by the Tate Gallery, London, in 1996. Opp&eacute;'s judgement of drawings was widely respected, and for the last twenty years of his life he acted as adviser to the department of drawings of the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa.<br>
<br>In appearance, Opp&eacute; had a &#145;slight, rather stooping figure, sallow complexion, black curling hair, almost unsilvered to the end&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 1 April 1957, 14). The critical faculties which distinguished him as a scholar were reflected in his temperament: shallow learning and slovenly writing quickly irritated him and provoked displays of caustic wit. It was reserved for his friends to appreciate the humour and humanity which complemented his rigorous intellect and to enjoy his &#145;curious likes and prejudices: he liked long walks and the picaresque novel; he disliked halfpennies and afternoon tea&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 3 April 1957, 13).<br>
<br>On 23 February 1909 Opp&eacute; married Lyonetta Edith Regina Valentine (1886/7&#150;1951), known as Valentine, daughter of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/71299/', "Revd Ralph William Lyonel Tollemache")</script>; they had a son and a daughter. Opp&eacute; was elected FBA in 1952 and made an honorary LLD of Glasgow in 1953. He died at his home, 17 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, London, on 29 March 1957.<br>
