<span class="headword">Mudford,  William Heseltine</span>  (1839&#150;1916), <span class="occ">journalist and newspaper editor</span>, was born at 45 St George's Street, Canterbury, on 1 March 1839, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19482/', "William Mudford (1782&#150;1848)")</script> and his wife, Amelia Camp. He came from a journalistic background: his father was the proprietor of the <span class="italic">Kentish Observer</span> and the <span class="italic">Canterbury Journal</span>, and, according to his <span class="italic">Times</span> obituarist, Mudford's education &#145;owed nothing to public school or university training&#146;. He went to work for the London <span class="italic">Standard</span> in the 1860s, becoming a member of the newspaper's parliamentary staff of twelve, and was greatly aided by his mastery of Gurney's shorthand system. <span class="italic">The Standard</span> was a morning paper, but in 1860 an evening edition was also produced; the paper was owned by James Johnstone (1815&#150;1878), and at the time when Mudford joined it was edited by Thomas Hamber. It was pro-conservative, but always asserted its independence of Conservative Party managers, and was described by the <span class="italic">New Quarterly Review</span> in 1860 as &#145;<b>with</b> them [the Conservative Party] and not <b>of</b> them&#146;  (Koss, 1.137). But by the end of the 1860s <span class="italic">The Standard</span> was in something of a decline, and Johnstone decided to replace Hamber with Mudford, who was by now an experienced journalist. The date of Mudford's appointment is uncertain, but the most likely conjecture is 1871. James Johnstone later acknowledged Mudford's success by making a codicil in his will which gave Mudford the editorship of the newspaper &#145;for his lifetime or until such time as he shall voluntarily resign the editorship&#146;. The family beneficiaries of Johnstone's will were excluded from interfering with the running of the paper, and Mudford, who was to have a salary of &pound;5000 a year, was left with effectively absolute power over <span class="italic">The Standard</span> after Johnstone's death in 1878.<br>
<br>In the same year <span class="italic">The Standard's</span> new premises in St Bride Street were completed. Mudford had on his staff a highly talented set of journalists and literary men, including G. A. Henty, Charles Norris, Alfred Austin, Byron Curtis, and, later, Sidney Low. The paper had earlier benefited from Conservative Party subsidies in the 1860s, but its rapid rise in circulation in the 1870s and its dramatic increase in the 1880s (between 1874 and the mid-1880s circulation rose from 176,000 to over 250,000), allied to Mudford's safeguarded editorial position, enabled Mudford to assert the paper's independence of Conservative Party control or interference. <span class="italic">The Standard</span> became one of the most prosperous and influential newspapers of the day, and was second only to <span class="italic">The Times</span> as a morning paper. Mudford proved himself to be a good manager as well as editor: he used a daily American cable service, and paid &pound;800 for cable dispatches during the Anglo-Afghan War of 1878&#150;80. He replaced old machinery and paid his talented staff well: some 500 in number, they cost the newspaper &pound;1500 a week in salaries alone.<br>
<br>Mudford had access to the leading politicians of the time, but once he achieved absolute control of <span class="italic">The Standard</span> he deliberately set out to distance himself from direct contact with political society. The story that Mudford rose from the dinner table to receive the card of a &#145;great statesman&#146; (Lord Carnarvon) with the words &#145;Tell him I'm out&#146; is probably apocryphal, but it exemplifies his new style. But, while Mudford was anxious to demonstrate his freedom from political entanglements, he was prepared to exploit those of his staff who maintained them. T. H. S. Escott, one of his leader writers, enjoyed close contact with Joseph Chamberlain in the early 1880s. Chamberlain was disappointed by his lack of status in the new Liberal administration; the result was a series of leaks relating to the government's Irish policy in 1880&#150;82, which gave Mudford some exciting exclusives. On 6 April 1881, for instance, <span class="italic">The Standard</span> received advance information on the terms of the 1881 <span class="roman">Irish Land Bill</span>. Even when this source dried up, <span class="italic">The Standard</span> was still capable of surprising Gladstone. On 17 December 1885 it announced Gladstone's conversion to home rule for Ireland. Gladstone's son Herbert had discussed his father's position on home rule with the editor of the <span class="italic">Leeds Mercury</span>, Wemyss Reid; <span class="italic">The Standard</span> obtained the news, possibly through a leak from Reid, who dined with Mudford on 16 December, or through the National Press Association. On 17 December it was published as an exclusive, with a call for a general election as the &#145;best way of defending the integrity of the Kingdom and the loyalists of Ireland&#146;.<br>
<br>But, although the news was sensational, it was not printed in <span class="italic">The Standard</span> in a sensational style. There were no brash headlines: Mudford was an old-fashioned editor of a quality newspaper. But this proved a weakness as well as a strength. In the 1890s <span class="italic">The Standard</span> began to lose its leading position, and its circulation was overtaken by rivals representing the &#145;new journalism&#146;, such as the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, <span class="italic">The Star</span>, and the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>; they invaded <span class="italic">The Standard's</span> readership, which Mudford described as the &#145;villa resident order of Englishman&#146;. On 31 December 1899 Mudford relinquished his editorship to Byron Curtis (1843&#150;1907); four years later the paper was sold to Arthur Pearson, and by 1914 it was receiving subsidies from Conservative Party funds. But its influence in foreign affairs survived Mudford's departure.<br>
<br>Mudford's absolute power as editor was reflected in his relationships with his staff, which were cordial, but firm. On 14 October 1891 Byron Curtis refused to accept an article on the leadership of the House of Commons written by Alfred Austin following a discussion with Lord Salisbury, Curtis being unwilling to take the responsibility for it in Mudford's absence. Mudford occasionally admonished Escott for badly composed leaders. Despite his lack of personal contact with his staff, he was considered a good judge of men. His declared policy of &#145;independence&#146; must be qualified in the light of his use of journalists who had close political contacts, but he never surrendered his editorial veto: although he allowed Austin to send Lord Salisbury his leaders for amendment, he frequently amended the changes. The danger of exercising too much independence is revealed in A. J. Balfour's description of <span class="italic">The Standard</span> in 1893 as &#145;of no earthly value to the party in the way of making opinion, as their criticisms are a foregone conclusion&#146;  (Koss, 1.337).<br>
<br>Mudford was a cultured and likeable man of a broadly conservative disposition, with an interest in radical toryism. He was described by one of his contemporaries as of medium height, broad-chested, and of strong build. He lived a reclusive retirement at his house, Westcombe Lodge, Wimbledon Common. On 14 October 1916 he slipped and fell into the fireplace; he died at the house from his injuries on 18 October, and was buried at Putney Vale cemetery two days later. Mudford's standing as an editor came from his freedom from proprietorial control, that of his newspaper from his discreet contacts with government sources, a combination which explains J. L. Garvin's description of him as &#145;the consummate&#151;though almost invisible&#151;editor of the <span class="italic">Standard</span>&#146;  (J. Garvin, <span class="italic">The Life of Joseph Chamberlain</span>, 1, 1932, 307).<br>
