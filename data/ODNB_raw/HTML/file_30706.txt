<span class="headword">Bennett,  Alfred William</span>  (1833&#150;1902), <span class="occ">botanist and publisher</span>, was born on 24 June 1833 at Clapham, Surrey, the second son of William Bennett (<i>d</i>. 1873), tea dealer and botanist, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1891), author of religious books for the Society of Friends. His father was interested in education and apart from the winter of 1841&#150;2, which the family spent at the Pestalozzi School at Appenzell in Switzerland, Bennett was taught at home. He later attended classes at University College, London, and graduated BA from the University of London with honours in chemistry and botany (1853). He proceeded MA in 1855 and gained his BSc in 1868.<br>
<br>On leaving college Bennett became tutor to the family of the banker Gurney Barclay. In 1858 he married Katherine, the daughter of William Richardson of Sunderland, and started business as a bookseller and publisher. He was one of the first publishers to use photography for illustrating his books, whose topics ranged from alpine scenery to Yorkshire abbeys. For a time about 1860 he was both proprietor and editor of the weekly journal <span class="italic">Friends</span>; he later wrote on pre-Foxite Quakerism (1894). Among other works Bennett published were poems by John Leicester Warren, afterwards third Baron de Tabley, and his own parents. Bennett also prepared the original catalogue of the Lindley Library following its purchase by the Royal Horticultural Society in 1867.<br>
<br>In 1868 Bennett gave up his business and became a lecturer on botany at Bedford College and St Thomas's Hospital, London. He remained there until 1896 and was described as &#145;an excellent and painstaking teacher, and a careful examiner&#146;  (Baker, 157). He also had an interest in the higher education of women and opened his house to enable several female students to attend Bedford College. From 1870 to 1874 he was biological sub-editor for the newly established journal <span class="italic">Nature</span> and was also botanical reviewer and writer for <span class="italic">The Academy</span>. Bennett became a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1868. He briefly served as assistant editor of the society's publications during 1873&#150;4, but was &#145;grossly careless in his reporting&#146;  (Gage, 67). About this time he also wrote several papers on flower-fertilization and began his studies of the order Polygalaceae (milkworts) which allowed him to contribute a synopsis of the Indian species for J. D. Hooker's <span class="italic">Flora of British India</span> (1872) and also of the more numerous Brazilian species for the <span class="italic">Flora Brasiliensis</span> published by Martius (1874).<br>
<br>Bennett's knowledge of the German language enabled him, with the assistance of William Thiselton-Dyer, to translate the third edition of the <span class="italic">Lehrbuch der Botanik</span> by F. G. Julius von Sachs as the <span class="italic">Textbook of Botany, Morphological and Physiological</span> (1875). This had a great influence on the teaching of botany, &#145;turning it away from lectures &hellip; to courses on anatomy and physiology&#146;  (Baker, 157). Bennett also translated and edited the <span class="italic">Lehrbuch</span> by Professor Otto Thome, which was published as <span class="italic">Textbook of Structural and Physiological Botany</span> in 1877 and 1885. Throughout his life he made numerous botanical contributions to scientific periodicals and published <span class="italic">Mycological Illustrations</span> (1871) with W. Wilson Saunders and Worthington G. Smith.<br>
<br>An early love of natural history, walking, and flowers led to a tour of Switzerland in 1875 that resulted in Bennett's translation of J. Seboth's <span class="italic">Alpenpflanzen nach der Natur gemalt</span> as <span class="italic">Alpine Plants</span> (1879&#150;84), and of a work by K. W. von Dalla Torre as <span class="italic">Tourists' Guide to the Flora of the Austrian Alps</span> (1882, 1886). In these and his own <span class="italic">The Flora of the Alps</span>, published in 1897 with the coloured plates taken from David Wooster's <span class="italic">Alpine Plants</span> (1872), Bennett endeavoured to improve and widen the available illustrations of alpine plants.<br>
<br>In 1879 Bennett became a fellow of the Royal Microscopical Society, and thereafter confined his research to cryptogamic plants, especially the freshwater algae. He revised the section on cryptogams for the fourth edition of Henfrey's <span class="italic">Elementary Botany</span> (1884) and dealt with all the groups containing chlorophyll for the joint <span class="italic">Handbook of Cryptogamic Botany</span> with G. R. Milne Murray (1889), which has been recognized as his &#145;most valuable original work&#146;  (Baker, 157).<br>
<br>Bennett served on the council of the Royal Microscopical Society and became editor of its publications in 1897. He died suddenly from heart disease, collapsing on the top of an omnibus at Oxford Circus, London, on his way home from the Savile Club to his home in Regent's Park, on 23 January 1902. His wife had predeceased him and he was buried next to her at the Quaker burial-ground in Isleworth, on 28 January; they had no children.<br>
