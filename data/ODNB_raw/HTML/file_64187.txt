<span class="headword">Perry,  Philip Mark</span>  (1720&#150;1774), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and scholar</span>, was born on 5 March 1720 at Bilston, Staffordshire, the son of Peter Perry and his wife, Joan Westwood. The family had resided in the area for many years and the name Perry occurs in the recusant lists of 1641 and 1705. In 1740 he went to the English College at Douai, where he completed the two-year philosophy course. In 1742 he was sent to St Gregory's English College, Paris, to join the select band of students who were following the demanding theological course at the Sorbonne. His studies were interrupted by ill health and he returned to England for two years. He resumed the course in 1746, obtained his MA in 1748, was ordained priest on 18 December 1751, proceeded to the licentiate, and finally gained his doctorate in theology on 22 May 1754.<br>
<br>On his return to England Perry took up residence as chaplain to Rowland Eyre at Hassop Hall, Bakewell, Derbyshire. After eight years he moved to Heythrop Park, Oxfordshire, to be chaplain to the earl of Shrewsbury. From 1765 he resided at Longbirch, Brewood, Staffordshire. On the expulsion of the Jesuits from Spain in 1767 Bishop Challoner appointed him rector of the English College of St Alban, Valladolid. Having arrived in Spain with no previous experience of the country or language, Perry succeeded in putting into effect the agreement that had been reached between Challoner and the Spanish court that the three English seminaries at Valladolid, Madrid, and Seville should be amalgamated into one establishment at Valladolid and administered by the English secular clergy. He negotiated the sale and transfer of college properties and established good relations with both the civil and ecclesiastical authorities.<br>
<br>Perry had hoped that his appointment to Spain might enable him to further his researches into the life of John Fisher and the divorce of Katherine of Aragon, and he obtained permission to visit Spanish libraries. However, his administrative duties curtailed these activities. He had a lifetime friendship with Alban Butler, the author of <span class="italic">Lives of the Saints</span>, with whom he corresponded and who expressed the wish that Perry would be his literary heir. The wide range of his interests is shown in his acquisitions for the college library at Valladolid and the numerous manuscripts on historical topics that are to be found among his papers. After his death John Geddes, whom he had assisted in the re-establishment of the Scots College in Spain, brought some of his works to Britain with a view to publication. They included lives of John Fisher and Robert Grosseteste and a continuation of Bede's <span class="italic">History</span>. Perry's activities on behalf of the college meant that he had to make prolonged visits to Madrid. In his absence he corresponded with his vice-rector in Valladolid, and these letters afford an insight into the domestic situation as well as his scholarly concern for precision and accuracy.<br>
<br>It was during a stay in Madrid in the very hot summer of 1774 that Perry caught a fever and died on 4 September, in the Hospice of San Andr&egrave;s de la Nacion Flamenca. He was buried in its chapel the following day. In his will he left any goods and property in England to his surviving brother and two sisters in Staffordshire and his possessions in Spain to the college at Valladolid. During his lifetime his contemporaries remarked on his moroseness and rigidity; at his death they praised his learning, zeal, and prudence. We are told that he looked older than his fifty-four years and this is attributed to the time he had spent in study. John Kirk, in <span class="italic">Biographies of English Catholics</span> (1909), relates that Perry's nephew, the Revd John Perry, told him that after his death his uncle had appeared to him to prevent his taking evil ways.<br>
