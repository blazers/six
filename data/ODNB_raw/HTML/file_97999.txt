<span class="headword">Trent,  William</span>  (1653<span class="mult">x</span>66&#150;1724), <span class="occ">merchant and founder of Trenton, New Jersey</span>, was born into a merchant family in Inverness about which few further details are known. In the early 1680s William followed his brother James and cousin Maurice to Pennsylvania. There he quickly became one of the leading figures in Philadelphia, where about thirty-five merchants formed a nascent upper class. He was a committed member of the Church of England and served as a vestryman at Christ Church, Philadelphia, between 1717 and 1720. Although an Anglican in a society established and dominated by Quakers, and despite some difficult times, he achieved both financial and political success.<br>
<br>As a merchant Trent built and invested in a large number of ships, sharing expenses and risks with leading merchants in the area, as well as with the colony's proprietor, William Penn. In 1703 Penn's secretary, James Logan, wrote to his employer about an investment in a venture to collect rice from South Carolina and to trade it overseas, noting that it was &#145;with the Most Industrious thriving and Intilligent Traders here&#146; of whom Trent was one  (Dunn and Dunn, 4.248). Trent's exports and imports included tobacco, corn, bread, flour, furs, liquor, rice, and slaves. In 1704 he purchased with his fellow Philadelphian merchant Isaac Norris 7500 acres on the Schuylkill River, north-east of Philadelphia, part of which formed the site of modern-day Norristown. Certain ventures, like that of 1703&#151;undertaken during Queen Anne's War&#151;were risky and Trent's wealth fluctuated with the successes and failures of shipping during wartime. According to one early list for Philadelphia he was identified as the town's fourteenth wealthiest person while another document placed him third. He was sufficiently successful to invest in ships, goods, and property including Philadelphia's famous Slate Roof House, previously occupied by William Penn, which he owned between 1703 and 1708.<br>
<br>In 1703 Trent was appointed to Pennsylvania's provincial council; then, beginning in 1710, he was elected on five occasions to the assembly and selected as speaker in 1717 and 1719. In addition, and while not trained as a lawyer, he served as a provincial and then a supreme court judge. In politics Trent sided with the conservative proprietary faction, not surprising for an Anglican. At the same time, he did not believe that Quakers should be prevented from testifying in court or from holding office because of their refusal to swear oaths.<br>
<br>About 1693 Trent married Mary Burge (<i>d</i>. 1708), with whom he had three surviving sons&#151;James, John, and Morris&#151;and one daughter, Mary. After his wife's death in April 1708 he married, on 20 July 1710, the nineteen-year-old Mary Coddington, with whom he had two sons; one, Thomas (<i>b</i>. 1711), died young while the second, later known as Major William Trent (1715&#150;<i>c</i>.1787), became a pioneer and commander of Fort Pitt during the Pontiac War (1763&#150;6). A few years after the marriage Mary Coddington was one of three women in Philadelphia caught up in a scandal involving a possible affair with Francis Philips, rector of Christ Church, yet she subsequently moved with her husband to New Jersey in 1721.<br>
<br>In August 1714 Trent purchased 800 acres of land at The Falls, on both sides of the Assunpink Creek on the northern shore of the Delaware River. This was an area originally settled by a Yorkshire Quaker, Mahlon Stacy (<i>d</i>. 1704), from whose son Trent purchased the land and on which he now built lumber and fulling mills and started an iron forge. Here between 1716 and 1719 he also built a Georgian-style brick house that was originally used as a summer residence. The house&#151;which now stands in 2 acres of grounds between Market and South Warren streets, Trenton&#151;had two storeys, as well as a full basement that originally contained the kitchen and an attic (once used for storage and slave quarters). There were two parlours on the ground floor and four bedrooms on the first; the house has a large central hall, and two entrances, which originally faced onto the nearby Delaware River and a local road. Large by the standards of the times, the house was meant to impress visitors with its owner's wealth and status. On 4 January 1719 Trent also submitted a plan for &#145;Trent town&#146; to the Hunterdon county authorities; Trenton was first used as the settlement's name later that year though variations (including Trent's-town, Trent-town, and The Falls) were still used during the eighteenth century.<br>
<br>In 1721, in the wake of the economic crisis that followed the South Sea Bubble, Trent was forced to liquidate his Pennsylvania assets and moved to his summer residence. As in Pennsylvania he achieved political and judicial office in New Jersey. At the request of the governor, William Burnet, Trent was commissioned as a colonel in the Hunterdon county militia and in 1719 became a judge of the court of common pleas for Hunterdon. He also represented Burlington county in the colony's legislature and held the office of speaker of the assembly in 1723 and 1724. Shortly before his death he was appointed as New Jersey's chief justice.<br>
<br>William Trent died suddenly from a &#145;fit of apoplexy&#146; on 25 December 1724 at Trenton; he was survived by his children and his second wife. His place of burial is unknown, though it has been suggested that he was buried in a Quaker ground in what is now Riverview cemetery, Trenton. Trent died intestate and the allocation of his estate was contested by his wife and eldest son. The dispute was settled two years later when the executors valued Trent's listed property at &pound;1100 18<i>s</i>. 0&frac12;<i>d</i>. In March 1737 it was claimed that Trent had not died from a stroke but had been murdered by three slaves, who were arrested and subsequently executed on charges of poisoning.<br>
<br>Since his death Trent's New Jersey residence has had more than twenty owners, and was used by both the Hessians and patriots during the American War of Independence. It later served as a residence for three of New Jersey's governors and is now the oldest building in the state's capital city. In 1929 the house&#151;known variously as Kingsbury Hall and Bloomsbury Court and now as Trent House&#151;was donated to the city of Trenton by its last private owner, Edward A. Stokes, who stipulated that it be maintained as a public cultural institution. It was restored during the 1930s, furnished with period pieces, and opened to the public in 1939. Today the 1719 William Trent House Museum is operated by the city and the Trent House Association, and has been designated a national landmark by the United States congress.<br>
