<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mill <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Hardy; <em>other married name </em>Taylor]</span>,  Harriet</span>  (1807&#150;1858), <span class="occ">advocate of sexual equality</span>, was born on 10 October 1807 at 18 Beckford Row, Walworth, in south London, daughter of Harriet (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Hurst) and Thomas Hardy (<i>d</i>. 1849), surgeon and &#145;man-midwife&#146; of Walworth. Harriet Hurst's family lived in Walworth; they were of cavalier stock and very proud of their lineage. Thomas Hardy's family were of the gentry, with lands in Yorkshire, which Thomas was to inherit in 1836. At the time of his daughter's birth Thomas had been for five years a member of the Royal College of Surgeons and was practising in Walworth. Harriet was the middle child, with five brothers and a younger sister; only with her youngest brother, Arthur, did Harriet remain on good terms. She appears to have been educated at home; at least no outside schooling is known. On 14 March 1826, at the age of eighteen, she married John Taylor (1796&#150;1849) of Islington, eleven years her senior and a partner in a family firm of wholesale druggists in the City of London; they had three children: Herbert (<i>b</i>. 1827), Algernon (<i>b</i>. 1830), and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36431/', "Helen Taylor (1831&#150;1907)")</script>. The Taylors' first home was at 4 Christopher Street, Finsbury, close to the family firm and the Unitarian chapel at South Place, which they attended. At the end of 1832 they moved to 17 Kent Terrace, Regent's Park.<br>
<br>Although there is a tradition that Harriet Hardy married John Taylor solely to escape from a home dominated by an irascible father, the few extant letters from the first years of their marriage show great affection between Harriet and John Taylor, and affection would appear to have remained the hallmark of all the years of what was to become an unconventional domestic life. They remained on friendly terms, celebrating together family events and writing frequently, especially when she was travelling.<br>
<br>In the early years of their marriage Harriet and John Taylor had, through their Unitarian connections, become the centre of a small circle of radicals; in this group Harriet Taylor was an outspoken and passionate advocate of completely equal rights for women and men. One of their circle was William Johnson Fox, minister at South Place Chapel and editor of the advanced and feminist <span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span>, and it was he, probably near the end of 1830, who was asked to bring <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18711/', "John Stuart Mill (1806&#150;1873)")</script> to one of the frequent dinners at the hospitable and congenial Taylor home. Fox's daughter gave in her memoirs a description of Harriet Taylor as she remembered her in these years:<blockquote>Mrs. Taylor at this date, when she was, perhaps about five and twenty years of age, was possessed of a beauty and grace quite unique of their kind. Tall and slight, with a slightly drooping figure, the movements of undulating grace. A small head, a swan-like throat, and a complexion like a pearl. Large eyes, not soft or sleepy, but with a look of quiet command in them. A low sweet voice with very distinct utterance emphasized the effect of her engrossing personality. Her children idolized her. (Hayek, 25)</blockquote>And not only her children; John Stuart Mill too idolized her. The attraction between Harriet Taylor and John Stuart Mill was immediate, intellectually fired by their shared views about social, educational, and political reform, especially the removal of the legal disabilities imposed on women. It was for them both an intimate and lasting friendship at first sight.<br>
<br>In 1833 Harriet Taylor and Mill travelled to Paris together; after some weeks she decided a complete break with her husband would bring &#145;insupportable unhappiness&#146;  (Mill to W. J. Fox, 5 or 6 Nov 1833; <span class="italic">Collected Works</span>, 12.188). Some time in the late 1830s John Taylor agreed to her having her own establishment, and she moved with her daughter, first (probably for only a short time) to Keston Heath, Bromley, Kent, and in the late 1830s to Walton-on-Thames, 17 miles south-west of London in Surrey. (Algernon seems to have lived with them at least part of the time in his earlier years; Herbert lived with his father.) John Taylor stayed in Kent Terrace; John Stuart Mill remained at home in Kensington with his parents and siblings. Trying to avoid the gossip this <i>d&eacute;m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois</i> excited, and suffering from ill health, Harriet Taylor lived away from society, seeing only a few close friends including, of course, John Stuart Mill frequently, and her husband occasionally. As her lungs became worse, she made a number of tours in Europe seeking a warmer, drier climate, accompanied by her daughter and sometimes by Mill; she also spent part of several winters in the south of England.<br>
<br>In May of 1849, when John Taylor told her he was dying of cancer, Harriet Taylor returned to Kent Terrace to nurse him until his death two months later. After a suitable interval she married John Stuart Mill on 21 April 1851. They lived in Blackheath Park, south-east of London; Helen also lived there, continuing to take care of her mother and the household. In October 1858, after Mill's retirement from the East India Company on its being taken over by the crown, the Mills travelled to the south of France for her health. But to no avail: Harriet Mill died of a haemorrhage of the lungs on 3 November 1858 at the Hotel de l'Europe, Avignon. Mill wrote: &#145;while she lived, she never sought to be known beyond her small circle of intimates&#146;  (Mill to A. Ruge, 2 March 1859; <span class="italic">Collected Works</span>, 15.598).<br>
<br>It is not easy to estimate the importance and influence of a reclusive woman who wrote little; if there had been no John Stuart Mill, Harriet Mill would not be remembered. But there was, and her influence on and through Mill was great, changing his reasoned conviction that &#145;complete equality in all legal, political, social and domestic relations &hellip; ought to exist between men and women&#146; into a crusade for the improvement of mankind. He had held these advanced views before he met her, but it was she who showed him the practical consequences of the lack of equality, &#145;the mode in which the consequences of the inferior position of women intertwine themselves with all the evils of the existing society and with the difficulties of human improvement&#146;  (<span class="italic">Collected Works</span>, 1.252). This aspect of her influence is not unexpected, for her early essay on marriage, written probably for Mill in 1834 and not for publication, shows a young woman more strongly influenced by the Romantic movement than by any formal education, but acutely aware of the everyday effects on women and on men, especially in the married state, of women's social inequality. There can be little reason to doubt that it was she who convinced Mill that the complete equality of the sexes before the law&#151;the argument later developed in <span class="italic">The Subjection of Women</span>&#151;was the next immediate and essential rung on the ladder to the hoped-for heaven that was their shared vision.<br>
<br>The little that Harriet is known to have published does not refute Mill's estimate of her influence on him, although it makes credence in her genius difficult. She wrote eleven pieces for the <span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span> (one in 1831 and ten in 1832): critical notices, poems and mood pieces, reviews and historical essays, all short. Her most substantial essay, <span class="italic">The Enfranchisement of Women</span>, was published under John Stuart Mill's name in the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span> (55, 1851, 298&#150;311); in it she claimed for women &#145;their admission, in law and in fact, to equality in all rights, political, civil, and social, with the male citizens of the community&#146;. She argued that without equality between the sexes, society would remain tyrannical and corrupt; this argument was to be developed in the Mills' joint productions.<br>
<br>Harriet published nothing else on her own, but she unquestionably wrote or dictated part of the letters they wrote together to the newspapers (mostly to the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>) in 1846 and the early 1850s in response to reported cases of domestic brutality. There is evidence from these letters and also from drafts surviving in their papers that at this time they were attempting to work out together the practical consequences of sexual inequality, which Harriet Mill had touched on in <span class="italic">The Enfranchisement</span>. In the letters they emphasized the importance of domestic practices in corrupting or improving society. They had come to believe that the prevalence and acceptance of domestic brutality, especially among the English working classes, and its lenient treatment in the courts helped explain empirically why some hopes held nearly twenty years earlier by the band of visionaries writing for the <span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span> had not materialized. Women's legal inequality resulted in injustice and tyranny in the home, reflected not only in the relations between husbands and wives but also in the treatment and upbringing of children. These brutal qualities, imbibed from birth, permeated social attitudes at all levels and in all areas. They were convinced that the slavery in family life was the root cause for the failure of reforms to effect fundamental improvements in society and that thus it had a profound, historically crucial, effect on society.<br>
<br>Harriet Mill's share in and influence on John Stuart Mill's major works cannot be documented precisely with chapter and verse. She read and commented on the draft of his <span class="italic">Principles of Political Economy</span> (1848): Mill's dedication of the book to her&#151;a dedication John Taylor would not allow to be printed  (<span class="italic">Collected Works</span>, 3.1026, n. 2)&#151;and his attribution to her prompting of the chapter &#145;On the probable futurity of the working classes&#146; bear ample testimony to her part in this work. And one can attribute to her at least the heightening of his awareness that<blockquote>From an imperfection in our language &hellip; there is often almost a necessity for using the masculine <i>pronoun</i> where both sexes are equally concerned, but seldom the masculine <i>substantive</i>. The effect upon the mind of this phraseology is bad; it encourages the habit of <i>passing by</i> one-half of the race as not concerned in its highest interests. (<span class="italic">The Examiner</span>, 1 June 1834)</blockquote>Although Mill continued in his own work to sanction the practice, a silent but significant change occurred at the time of his marriage. In the revision for the third edition of his <span class="italic">Logic</span> (1851) and of his <span class="italic">Principles of Political Economy</span> (1852) he systematically altered, in gender-neutral contexts, &#145;men&#146; to &#145;people&#146; or &#145;mankind&#146; (to him evidently a neutral term), and &#145;a man&#146; and &#145;he&#146; to &#145;a person&#146;. He also added an explicit footnote in that edition of the <span class="italic">Logic</span> referring &#145;to the almost universal habit, of thinking and speaking of one-half the human species as the whole&#146;  (<span class="italic">Collected Works</span>, 8.837 n).<br>
<br>As their health, particularly Harriet's, became of increasing concern, they planned together the future publications on which John Stuart Mill should work, one of them being <span class="italic">On Liberty</span> (1859). On it Harriet's influence is usually acknowledged&#151;certainly it contains ideas she expressed in her earliest unpublished writings; but of the works which Mill wrote after his wife's death <span class="italic">The Subjection of Women</span> (1869) shows most undeniably her influence. The argument of the book is simple and straightforward, and is clearly a fulfilment of the idea, which Mill attributes to her early influence on him and which they had been developing together in the 1850s,<blockquote>That the principle which regulates the existing social relations between the two sexes&#151;the legal subordination of one sex to the other&#151;is wrong in itself, and now one of the chief hindrances to human improvement; and that it ought to be replaced by a principle of perfect equality, admitting no power or privilege on the one side, nor disability on the other. (<span class="italic">Collected Works</span>, 21.259)</blockquote>There are strong echoes of Harriet Mill's phrasing in her early unfinished pieces on marriage in <span class="italic">The Enfranchisement</span>, and in the newspaper letters they wrote together; the themes of male tyranny, domestic slavery, the husband's ownership of his wife and family, and domestic brutality set the tone of <span class="italic">The Subjection of Women</span>:<blockquote>[H]owever brutal a tyrant she may unfortunately be chained to&#151;though she may know that he hates her, though it may be his daily pleasure to torture her, and though she may feel it impossible not to loathe him&#151;he can claim from her and enforce the lowest degradation of a human being, that of being made the instrument of an animal function contrary to her inclinations. (<span class="italic">Collected Works</span>, 21.285)</blockquote>Harriet Mill's posthumous influence can also be seen in the activities of John Stuart Mill and her daughter Helen Taylor in furthering the suffrage cause. John Stuart Mill's amendment to the second <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> on 27 May 1867, to replace the word &#145;man&#146; with &#145;person&#146;, bears a singular resemblance to his earlier amendments to his own editions, and the arguments are many of them similar to those in Harriet Mill's article (but it must be said these arguments were the common coin of many suffragists by the 1860s). John Stuart Mill was honorary president of the first London suffrage society, and both he and Helen Taylor worked hard behind the scenes and spoke at public meetings for the society. The bond that joined John Stuart Mill and his stepdaughter and motivated them was their common devotion to Harriet Mill. John Stuart Mill bought a house overlooking her grave in Avignon, where they lived for six months of each year. There and in London John Stuart Mill and Helen Taylor laboured to advance the ideas they had shared with &#145;her&#146;. Mill and Taylor stood together at the graveside when the huge slab of finest Carrara marble was lowered onto the top of Harriet Mill's grave. There Mill had writ in stone:<blockquote>To the beloved memory of Harriet Mill, the dearly beloved and deeply regretted wife of John Stuart Mill. Her great and loving heart, her noble soul, her clear, powerful and original comprehensive intellect made her the guide and support, the instructor in wisdom and the example of goodness, as she was the sole earthly delight, of those who had the happiness to belong to her. As earnest for the public good as she was generous and devoted to all who surrounded her, her influence has been felt in many of the greatest improvements of the age and will be in those still to come. Were there but a few hearts and intellects like hers this earth would already become the hoped-for heaven. She died, to the irreparable loss of those who survive her, at Avignon, Nov. 3 1858.</blockquote>
