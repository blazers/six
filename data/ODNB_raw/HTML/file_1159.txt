<span class="headword">Baldrey,  Joshua Kirby</span>  (1754&#150;1828), <span class="occ">draughtsman and engraver</span>, was the eldest son of Andrew Baldrey (<i>d</i>. 1802), of Ipswich, and his wife, Mary (1728&#150;1806). Andrew, the illegitimate son of Andrew Rankin and Elizabeth Baldrey, was successively apprentice, partner, and successor in the general painting business of Joshua's godfather Joshua Kirby, and trained his own sons Joshua and Robert. Joshua in turn took as pupils Robert Clamp, stipple portrait engraver, and his own son John Baldrey, by his first marriage.<br>
<br>For over twenty years Joshua Baldrey worked in London or Cambridge, never settling permanently in either. His first imprints as engraver and printseller were issued from Mr Dibbs's at Green Street, Grosvenor Square, in 1780, but he was in Trumpington Street in Cambridge in 1785, and back at Doughty &amp; Co. in Holborn three years later, producing a series of satires against Hastings, Thurlow, and Pitt. He exhibited portraits at the Royal Academy in 1793 and 1794. Among his best works are <span class="italic">The Finding of Moses</span>, after Salvator Rosa (1785); <span class="italic">Diana in a Landscape</span>, after Carlo Maratta; <span class="italic">Lady Rawdon</span>, after Reynolds (1783); and <span class="italic">Atalanta</span>, after Henry Bunbury (1790). Baldrey worked after George Morland in soft-ground etching and after Bunbury in stipple. From about 1800 he and his son John, whose satires and portraits are in stipple and line, were together in Trinity Street, Cambridge. In 1811 Baldrey described himself as a miniature painter there, but in May 1809 he had published at 5 guineas a two-sheet reproduction of the east window of King's College chapel, Cambridge, which he had drawn, engraved, and, for an extra guinea, coloured by hand. His eight-page <span class="italic">Dissertation on the Windows of King's College Chapel, Cambridge</span> (1818) was to advertise the remaining stock of the prints and to solicit orders for a projected engraving of one of the south windows. His <span class="italic">Dissertation</span> concludes sadly: &#145;All these works have been executed by a man with a large increasing family, experiencing much sickness; and from the unpropitious state of the times, struggling with great difficulties&#146;  (p. 19). A large engraving of the Nollekens statue of Pitt in the Senate House, published in London in 1815, while competent, is heavy and lifeless.<br>
<br>Baldrey must have been a widower when on 12 June 1808 he married Mary Jane Copsey by licence at Great St Mary's in Cambridge; a daughter, Sarah, was witness. When he died in poverty at Hatfield Woodside, Hertfordshire, on 6 December 1828 it was reported that he left a large family.<br>
