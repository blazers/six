<span class="headword">Plowden,  Charles</span>  (1743&#150;1821), <span class="occ">Jesuit</span>, was born on 1 May or 19 August 1743, the seventh son of William Ignatius Plowden of Plowden Hall, Shropshire, and his wife, Frances Dormer, daughter of Charles, fifth Baron Dormer of Wenge. Four of his brothers also became Jesuits, Charles and Robert being nicknamed Sons of Thunder  (Abercrombie, 288) on account of their strong opinions. Another brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22390/', "Francis Peter Plowden")</script>, the historian. Aged ten, Charles began at the Franciscan school at Edgbaston, and between 1754 and 1759 studied humanities at the college of the English Jesuits at St Omer. He entered the Society of Jesus at Watten on 7 September 1759. He studied at Bruges during 1763&#150;4 and 1767&#150;9, and then left for Italy, somewhat reluctantly, to study theology in Rome (1769&#150;70) and at Bologna (1770&#150;71). He was ordained in Rome on 30 September 1770.<br>
<br>Besides his studies, Plowden acted as a popular tutor and companion in Italy to John Biddulph and Sir Thomas Gage, staying at the English College, Rome, and the College of Nobles in Bologna. Throughout 1772 he and Gage travelled, arriving in Paris in June 1772. He returned to Bruges between 1772 and 1773. At the suppression of the Jesuits in 1773 by Clement XIV he criticized the pope so severely in <span class="italic">A Candid and Impartial Sketch &hellip; of Clement XIV</span> (3 vols., 1785&#150;6) that it was withdrawn. At the suppression of the society he was minister of the English Jesuit &#145;great college&#146; in Bruges. Upon the violent destruction of the two Jesuit colleges there by the imperial government in 1773, which he described in a valuable account written in 1807, Plowden was detained in prison in Ghent as hostage together with the two heads of the Jesuit colleges. On regaining his liberty on 25 May 1774 he lodged at the English Jesuit academy at Li&egrave;ge, where he wrote his defence (1776) of Lawrence Ricci, Jesuit general at the time of the suppression, before embarking on further travels during which he acted as tutor and companion to William Constable-Maxwell (alias Middleton), with whom he visited Milan, Naples, Rome, and Venice between 1779 and 1781.<br>
<br>In 1781 Plowden returned to England, where he became chaplain to the Haggerston family at Ellingham, Northumberland. In 1784 he was appointed chaplain and tutor to the family of Thomas Weld at Lulworth Castle, Dorset, and occasionally acted as chaplain to the Arundells at Wardour. He continued his defence of the former Jesuits by writing his account of their unique survival in Belorussia (White Russia) thanks to the generosity of Catherine the Great. In 1789 Plowden's close friend John Carroll, bishop of Baltimore, tried unsuccessfully to persuade him to become head of Georgetown College. While at Lulworth, he became a leading spokesman for the &#145;orthodox&#146; party, which included Weld and John Milner, against the &#145;heterodox and schismatical&#146; Anglo-Gallican policies of the Cisalpine Club and Catholic Committee, though he maintained cordial relations with the Cisalpine leader, Charles Butler. He prevailed upon Weld to allow the consecration of the &#145;orthodox&#146; bishops William Gibson and John Douglass in the Lulworth chapel in December 1790, and he himself preached at the latter event. He attacked the Cisalpines, notably Sir John Throckmorton and the Revd Joseph Berington, in a number of works, including <span class="italic">An Answer to the Second Blue Book</span> (1791), <span class="italic">Observations on the Oath</span> (1791), and <span class="italic">A Letter to the Catholics of England</span> (1792). His charges of deception against Berington led the latter to liken him to Tartuffe: &#145;His sanctimonious air and oily diction veil a mind of artifice; and, at a distance, may be heard the sounding brass and the tinkling cymbal&#146;  (Berington, xxxi).<br>
<br>In November 1794 Plowden rejoined at Stonyhurst, Lancashire, his former Jesuit colleagues from Li&egrave;ge, and briefly acted as convent chaplain at York in 1796. On the first attempt to restore the English province of the Society of Jesus in 1803 he was appointed novice master at Hodder Place, near Stonyhurst, where he distinguished himself by his remarkable exhortations to preserve English Jesuit traditions and by washing the feet of all new novices, which was accompanied by a reading of <span class="roman">John</span> 13, a practice deriving apparently from Watten but terminated in 1808 on account of fears of anti-Jesuit feeling being stirred up. At Hodder he was solemnly professed on 13 November 1805. After the bull of restoration issued by Pius VII in 1814 Plowden was declared provincial on 8 September 1817, and at the same time rector of Stonyhurst College. Here, he continued to defend Jesuit rights against episcopal pretensions at Wigan, for instance, in 1818, and set himself the task of persuading Rome to restore formally the Jesuits in England despite the resistance of the bishops. In 1820 he was summoned to Rome for the election of a new general of the society and used this opportunity to advance the cause of restoration: &#145;I have been trotting the streets in quest of cardinals and prelates and losing time in their ante-chambers. Oh, what a bore!&#146;  (Basset, 378). Returning home, depressed at the lack of success, he died suddenly at Jougne in France on 13 June 1821, where he was buried, with military honours, as a general, in the parish cemetery, having been mistaken for a soldier returning from the appointment of a general in Rome. He was loved by his novices and students, among the latter being Richard Lalor Sheil, who described him as &#145;a perfect Jesuit of the old school&#146;  (&#145;Schoolboy recollections&#146;, <span class="italic">New Monthly Magazine</span>, Aug 1829).<br>
