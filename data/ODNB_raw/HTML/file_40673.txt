<span class="headword">Elias,  Norbert</span>  (1897&#150;1990), <span class="occ">sociologist</span>, was born on 22 June 1897 in Breslau, Germany (which later became Wroc&#322;aw, Poland), the only child of Hermann Elias, businessman, and his wife, Sophie Galevski. He attended the Johannesgymnasium, Breslau, and, after service in the German army during the First World War, read philosophy and medicine at Breslau University. As a teenager and young man, Elias was a leading figure in the Zionist youth movement Blau-Weiss, a fact which&#151;for whatever reason&#151;he took some trouble in later life to obscure.<br>
<br>Elias was awarded a doctorate in philosophy at Breslau in January 1924 for a thesis entitled <span class="italic">Idee und Individuum</span>. Financial difficulties caused by the great German inflation of 1922&#150;3 interrupted his studies, but in 1925 he went to Heidelberg to work for his <i>Habilitation</i> in sociology, at first with Alfred Weber (1868&#150;1958). In 1930, when Karl Mannheim (1893&#150;1947) moved to Frankfurt as professor, Elias accompanied him as academic assistant. His <i>Habilitation</i> was rushed through early in 1933, after Adolf Hitler came to power, but shortly afterwards Elias, as a Jew, sought refuge first in Paris (1933&#150;5), and then in London (from 1935), eventually becoming a British citizen in 1952. His father died in Breslau in 1940, and his mother died in Auschwitz about 1941.<br>
<br>In Paris and London, Elias completed the two volumes of his <i>magnum opus</i>, <span class="italic">&Uuml;ber den Prozess der Zivilisation</span> (published in translation as <span class="italic">The Civilizing Process</span> in two volumes in 1978 and 1982, and in a revised, single-volume translation in 2000); they were published in Basel in 1939, and received very little notice at that unpropitious moment. In 1939 Elias was awarded a senior research fellowship at the London School of Economics, interrupted by a period of internment as an enemy alien, and &#145;made himself useful&#146; to the British security services. After the Second World War he made a meagre living by extramural lecturing in London, and helped Siegmund Foulkes found the Group Analytic Society. Only in 1954, aged fifty-seven, did he obtain a post in a British university&#151;at Leicester, from where he formally retired as reader in 1962. From 1962 to 1964 he was professor of sociology at the University of Ghana.<br>
<br>Elias's international reputation was gained in his long and productive old age. <span class="italic">&Uuml;ber den Prozess der Zivilisation</span> was republished in 1969, to acclaim in Germany, the Netherlands, and France. His later books, in their English versions, include <span class="italic">The Established and the Outsiders</span> (1965), <span class="italic">What is Sociology?</span> (1978), <span class="italic">The Court Society</span> (on the court of Louis XIV, 1983), <span class="italic">The Loneliness of the Dying</span> (1985), <span class="italic">Involvement and Detachment</span> (essays on the sociology of knowledge and the sciences, 1987), <span class="italic">Quest for Excitement</span> (essays on the sociology of sport, 1986), <span class="italic">The Symbol Theory</span> (1991), <span class="italic">Time: an Essay</span> (1992), <span class="italic">Mozart: Portrait of a Genius</span> (1993), and <span class="italic">The Germans</span> (1995). A selection of his poems, <span class="italic">Los der Menschen</span>, appeared in 1987.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">&Uuml;ber den Prozess der Zivilisation</span> underlies all Elias's later work. It begins by examining how the word &#145;civilization&#146;, derived from <i>civilit&eacute;</i>, denoting the manners of courtiers, came to be used by nineteenth-century Europeans to express their sense of superiority over lower ranks or other cultures. The characteristics taken as evidence of this superiority had come to seem innate, and the Europeans were unaware that their own ancestors had acquired them through a long <i>process</i> of civilization. Through books about manners, from the middle ages to the nineteenth century, Elias traced the changing standards of good behaviour in matters such as spitting, nose-blowing, undressing, the toilet, and table manners. The threshold of repugnance had advanced, the expected standard of self-constraint had become more demanding, and many matters were hidden behind the scenes of social and mental life. Elias was, however, concerned not just with outward bodily propriety, but with violence and cruelty and changing feelings towards them. This provided a link to a long discussion of state-formation processes, including the &#145;taming of warriors&#146;. The monopolization of violence by the state, and longer chains of social interdependence, were associated with gradual changes in typical personality make-up.<br>
<br>Controversy about Elias's theory has concerned whether it is &#145;Eurocentric&#146;, whether twentieth-century &#145;permissive society&#146; represents a reversal of the civilizing process, and whether his ideas are refuted by events such as the destruction of the Jews during the Second World War. Yet <span class="italic">&Uuml;ber den Prozess der Zivilisation</span> in part represents Elias's own attempt to grapple with unfolding events in Nazi Germany. The fact that his own mother died in Auschwitz was the cause of the major psychological trauma of Elias's life, and may possibly be one reason why he published little between 1939 and 1965. He could be quarrelsome, and in relation to his work was very sensitive. At the same time he was delightful company, immensely knowledgeable and stimulating, a fascinating conversationalist with a puckish interest in the trivial details of life. He was short in stature, stronger than he looked, and swam daily until his late eighties. Photographs can be found in <span class="italic">Human Figurations</span>, his Festschrift, edited by Peter Gleichmann and others (1977), and among his papers in the Deutsche Nationalliteraturarchiv at Marbach am Neckar, Germany. Busts of Elias by the Dutch sculptor Gerda Rubinstein can be found at the Zentrum f&uuml;r Interdisziplin&auml;re Forschung, Bielefeld, at the University of Amsterdam, and in private collections. No paintings of Elias are believed to have been made.<br>
<br>In 1971 Elias was given the title and pension of professor emeritus of the University of Frankfurt. He was the first recipient of the Theodor W. Adorno prize, conferred by the city of Frankfurt in 1977, and had honorary doctorates from the universities of Bielefeld and Strasbourg II. He was also awarded the German Grosskreuz des Bundesdienstordens (1986) and was a commander of the order of Orange-Nassau (1987). In his adopted country of citizenship he enjoyed only a <i>succ&egrave;s d'estime</i>; from the mid-1970s he spent little time in Britain. Elias never married. He died peacefully in his study at J. J. Viottastraat 13, Amsterdam, on 1 August 1990. He was cremated at the Algemene Begraafplaats en Crematorium Westgaarde, Ookmeerweg, Amsterdam.<br>
