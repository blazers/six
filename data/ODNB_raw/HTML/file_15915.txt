<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lamb,  George</span>  (1784&#150;1834), <span class="occ">politician and writer</span>, had a disputed parentage. His mother was certainly <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47307/', "Elizabeth Lamb (bap. 1751, d. 1818)")</script>, daughter of Sir Ralph Milbanke, and wife of Peniston Lamb, first Viscount Melbourne (1745&#150;1828). His father was generally believed to have been <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10541/', "George IV (1762&#150;1830)")</script>. That monarch took a benign and lifelong interest in his career and stood as his godfather. Lamb was therefore the half-brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15920/', "William Lamb")</script>, the future prime minister; of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15914/', "Frederick Lamb")</script>, the future Lord Beauvale; and of Emily Lamb, successively the wife of lords Cowper and Palmerston [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40959/', "Temple, Emily Mary, Viscountess Palmerston")</script>]. Born on 11 July 1784, Lamb followed his brothers first to Eton College, from 1796 to 1802, and then to Trinity College, Cambridge, from 1802 to 1805. Unlike them, he spent no time in Scottish universities, but proceeded straight to Lincoln's Inn. He was called to the bar in 1809 and practised on the northern circuit.<br>
<br>Red-haired and red-faced, Lamb's immoderate intake of alcohol enhanced the Lamb family's reputation for high spirits. Melbourne described him as &#145;very intemperate &hellip; He drank a great deal, much more than we did&#146;  (Queen Victoria's journal, 6 June 1838). According to Lady Harriet Cavendish, &#145;he really has not half an hour's good behaviour in him &hellip; he is like a schoolboy, when he has been good and quiet for a long time for him, he begins making a noise, teizing [<i>sic</i>] the dogs, spoiling the furniture and then we say, &#147;Don't, George, pray be quiet, dear George. Oh, leave that alone,&#148; just as I do to your children when they question&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hary-O</span>, 268&#150;9). Animal spirits were moderated by a genial good nature that made him for some &#145;a most agreeable man&#146;. Within his family he was known as &#145;Curly Pate&#146;.<br>
<br>On 17 May 1809 Lamb married Caroline Rosalie Adelaide St Jules, the illegitimate daughter of Lady Elizabeth Foster and the fifth duke of Devonshire. She was henceforth known as &#145;Caro George&#146; or, unflatteringly, as &#145;Cleopatra&#146;. Generously, the duke settled &pound;20,000 on the young couple, together with an annuity of &pound;500 per annum. After the death of the first Viscount Melbourne in 1828 their income rose to &pound;3,000 per annum. In spite of this the marriage was somewhat uneven. In 1816 Lamb's wife decamped to Italy with Henry Brougham to conduct a much-publicized <i>affaire</i>, describing herself as the victim of neglect and drunkenness. Byron unkindly called Lamb &#145;Gay Thalia's luckless victory&#146; and all his relations that &#145;cuckoldy family&#146;  (Stuart, 159&#150;60). The couple were reconciled in 1817 and remained together until Lamb's death. There were no children from the marriage.<br>
<br>From a very early age Lamb evinced a passion for the theatre, first as an actor and writer in private theatricals, and then as a dramatist. In 1807 his play <span class="italic">Whistle for It</span> was produced at Covent Garden. This was a Gothic piece, brimming over with brigands and talk of daggers. In the denouement, however, a pair of young lovers are rescued by an anti-hero called Andrew, who cheerfully admits that he has never killed anyone in his life. In 1815 Lamb joined the management committee of Drury Lane, and, six years later, gave up the law completely as an unwelcome distraction from his dramatic pursuits. His sister observed that &#145;his heart is in Drury Lane, and he thinks of nothing but plays and epilogues and prologues&#146;. He was also a classical scholar of some quality. A translation of the poems of Catullus was published in 1821. He thought, perhaps significantly, that the Roman poet &#145;inclined to constancy in love, had his constancy met with return&#146;.<br>
<br>In politics Lamb was the most radical member of his family. In 1819 he agreed to &#145;rough it&#146; by contesting Westminster for the whigs. He won, though his committee rooms were sacked and he himself had to go into hiding. Losing the seat the following year, he was returned (on the Devonshire interest) for the Irish borough of Dungarvan in 1822, and represented that constituency until his death. He spoke in the house &#145;in a sensible and intrepid style&#146;, supporting such radical measures as triennial parliaments, the abolition of corrupt boroughs, and the setting up of an inquiry into the Peterloo massacre. He was a friend of both Daniel O'Connell and Francis Place. When his brother became home secretary, in November 1830, Lamb was appointed under-secretary in the same department, a post he held until his death. By all accounts Lamb showed himself to be an efficient and effective administrator. He was used as an intermediary between the government and the radicals in the difficult years before and after the passing of the first <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>. William Lamb later called George &#145;his great favourite&#146;  (Queen Victoria's journal, 14 June 1838); and after her husband's death, Caro George felt the prime minister must suffer &#145;a pang&#146; whenever he went into &#145;that room, where they were so happy together&#146;  (Panshanger MSS, D.ELb F 81). George Lamb died suddenly on 2 January 1834 at his house in Whitehall Yard, Westminster, London, and was buried at Hatfield on the 9th.<br>
