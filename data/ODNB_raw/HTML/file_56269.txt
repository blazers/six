<span class="headword">Kennedy,  Marion Grace</span>  (1836&#150;1914), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born at Shrewsbury on 23 November 1836, the second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15363/', "Benjamin Hall Kennedy (1804&#150;1889)")</script> and his wife, Janet (<i>d</i>. 1874), daughter of Thomas Caird. There were four daughters: <a href="#cosubject_56269">Charlotte Amy May [<i>see below</i>]</a>; Marion Grace, known within the family as Maisie; <a href="#cosubject_48418">Julia Elizabeth (Poppy) [<i>see below</i>]</a>; and Edith Janet (1842&#150;1922), who later married William Kitson, a west country solicitor; a son, Arthur Herbert (1846&#150;1885), went to Oxford and the bar but subsequently worked in the wine trade. All but the eldest daughter were born while their father was headmaster of Shrewsbury School. He was a benevolent, but fiercely and erratically impulsive man, prone to dismiss whole groups of boys (on one occasion, the entire sixth form), only to forget his decision overnight. He was no manager of money or keeper of records, and it was Janet Kennedy who held the purse strings.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_56269"></a><span class="headword">Charlotte Amy May Burbury <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Kennedy]</span></span>  (1832&#150;1895), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, the eldest daughter, was born at The Grove, Harrow School. She married on 10 June 1852 William Burbury (1821/2&#150;1865), second master at Shrewsbury School and, from 1861, rector of West Felton, near Oswestry (her father succeeding to the living after her husband's death). They had no children. She was for ten years secretary to the Cambridge Local Examinations Board, and from 1871 to 1876 was secretary to the London National Society for Women's Suffrage, standing unsuccessfully as a candidate for the London school board in 1873. From 1870 until her death she was a member of the committee of the Society for the Employment of Women. She was a governor of the London School of Medicine for Women and of the North London Collegiate School. Charlotte Burbury died at 4 Cambrian Villas, Queen's Road, Richmond, Surrey, on 14 November 1895.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_48418"></a><span class="headword">Julia Elizabeth Kennedy</span>  (1839&#150;1916), <span class="occ">supporter of education for women</span>, was born at Shrewsbury on 23 December 1839. She and her sister Marion remained single, and they lived with their parents, moving to Cambridge on their father's election to the regius chair of Greek in 1867. After their mother's death in 1874 they kept house for their father at The Elms, a large house in Bateman Street. The sisters became well-known members of Cambridge society, which from the early 1880s was transformed by the relaxation of celibacy rules for college fellowships. Several young fellows who taught at the new women's colleges (Girton, founded in 1869, and Newnham, founded in 1871) subsequently married their pupils. Marion and Julia were staunch members of the liberal reforming circle in this society; they were probably the two elderly spinsters whom A. N. Whitehead tried to embarrass by announcing advanced Liberal views&#151;only to be told how pleased they were that he shared their own opinions  (B. Russell, <span class="italic">Autobiography of Bertrand Russell</span>, 1975, 130).<br>
<br>Benjamin Kennedy was a firm supporter of women's education and of their admission to university teaching and degrees, and Marion and Julia worked hard for the cause of women's education. Together with the Sidgwicks and the Fawcetts they were among the original supporters of the movement for providing lectures for women students. In 1877 Marion Kennedy became executive secretary of the Association for Promoting the Higher Education of Women in Cambridge, which she supported with a donation of &pound;100; when the association was amalgamated with Newnham Hall in 1880, she became honorary secretary to what was henceforth Newnham College, a post she retained until 1904. In the college's early years, she devoted much time to the pastoral care of its students.<br>
<br>After the family's move to Cambridge, Julia Kennedy began to learn philology from W. W. Skeat, and was the daughter to whom J. E. B. Mayor referred as an intelligent member of his Latin class for ladies in 1871. By the following decade she was sufficiently competent to be asked to give lectures on Anglo-Saxon at Girton College. In 1890 she was elected to membership of the Cambridge Philological Society. This election may have been influenced by local knowledge of her part in writing the <span class="italic">Revised Latin Primer</span> which had appeared under her father's name in 1888.<br>
<br>The book was prepared when Kennedy himself was in his eighties. The schoolmaster turned professor had not kept up with the progress of comparative philology, being revolutionized in the 1880s by the New Grammarians led by Osthoff and Brugmann. In the surviving correspondence with the publisher Longman, most letters are from the pen of Marion. She wrote as if acting as her father's secretary, but it is noticeable that the book's progress was slowed after Marion had a riding accident. In 1913 a question of copyright payment forced her to inform Longman that she and Julia had written the book themselves, with the help of two of her father's former pupils, G. H. Hallam of Harrow and T. E. Page of Charterhouse. Marion had provided the examples, Julia the philological introduction. In the event they were persuaded by counsel's opinion that they should not risk litigation, since the book had been issued solely under their father's name and they had made no public claim to authorship.<br>
<br>Marion Kennedy died at Torquay, Devon, on 11 January 1914, and Julia Kennedy on 9 December 1916 at Shenstone, 7 Selwyn Gardens, Cambridge, the house which she and Marion had shared after their father's death. Their memory and that of their father survives in the name of Kennedy Hall in Newnham College. In 1888 a fund had been raised by subscription to found a research studentship named after Marion; its first two holders were Mary Bateson and Philippa Fawcett. Marion's support for female suffrage placed her in a minority in the Cambridge Women's Liberal Association and led to her resignation from that body. In 1913, aged seventy-seven, she joined the suffrage procession in London. She and Julia were born just too early to take advantage of the educational provision for girls and women which they so strongly supported. Both in this work, and in their unacknowledged writing of the <span class="italic">Revised Latin Primer</span>, they devoted themselves loyally to the causes they believed in.<br>
