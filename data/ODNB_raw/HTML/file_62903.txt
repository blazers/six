<span class="headword">McMorran,  Donald Hanks</span>  (1904&#150;1965), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 3 May 1904 at 22 Hillside Road, Wallasey, Cheshire, the son of William Edwin McMorran (1875&#150;1930), accountant, and his wife, Edith, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hanks (1873&#150;1968), a dressmaker. He was educated at Harrow county grammar school from 1915 and at Regent Street Polytechnic, London (1921&#150;6), where he received a second-year medal. At the end of his third year he was awarded a Pugin travelling studentship by the Royal Institute of British Architects, which he used to tour and study the architecture of Northumberland and southern Scotland. While studying he worked as an assistant to Horace Farquharson (1874&#150;1966), a former assistant of Sir Edwin Lutyens, at 14 North Audley Street, London. From May 1926 until 1935 he worked as an assistant to Emmanuel Vincent Harris (1876&#150;1971), during which time he entered numerous architectural competitions and passed his architectural examination in December 1930. He became an associate of the RIBA in April 1931 and a fellow in 1943. On 10 October 1935 he left Harris's office to rejoin Horace Farquharson, with whom he formed Farquharson and McMorran. In March of the following year he became engaged to Margaret Cox (1908&#150;1995), a nurse at St George's Hospital, London, and daughter of the Sussex county cricketer George Rubens Cox. They were married at St Margaret's Church, Warnham, Sussex, on 30 April 1937 and in the following year they had the first of their four children, Susan (<i>d</i>. 1989), later an art historian and author of <span class="italic">The New Sculpture</span> (1983). In 1941 they moved to Dorking, Surrey, where a second daughter and two sons were born.<br>
<br>McMorran had been taken on by Farquharson to assist with the design of the police station and section house at Greenwich, London (1935&#150;9). In 1946, when the building was belatedly awarded an RIBA bronze medal, it was described by the institute's president, Sir Lancelot Keay, as being &#145;not too traditional to upset the modernists and not too modern to upset the traditionalists&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Builder</span>, 14 Nov 1947, 541). In drawing attention to the building's &#145;perfect proportions&#146; Keay also observed what was to become a hallmark of McMorran's fastidious and scholarly approach to architecture. Their next project, Hammersmith police station (1938&#150;9), was a more conventionally classical design described as &#145;aesthetically nearly perfect&#146;  (Goodhart-Rendel, 292) and later as &#145;the best building that never got a London Architecture Medal&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Builder</span>, 13 Aug 1965, 331). Assisting Farquharson and McMorran on the commission for Hammersmith police station was the student George Whitby.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_101268"></a><span class="headword">George Frederick Whitby</span>  (1916&#150;1973), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 17 August 1916 at 42 Creighton Road, Ealing, Middlesex, the son of Cyril Simms Whitby (1879&#150;1957), police clerk, and Mabel Rust, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jennings (1881&#150;1945). Educated first at Ealing grammar school, he entered Regent Street Polytechnic in 1935. While studying architecture he worked as an assistant to Welch, Cachemaille-Day, and Lander before joining Farquharson and McMorran. At the outbreak of the Second World War he joined the Royal Engineers and was appointed MBE for his bravery in assembling Bailey bridges in the deserts of north Africa, where he was wounded; he spent two years in hospital in Jordan. In May 1945, during military training in Wales, George met (Rhona) Charmian Butler (<i>b</i>. 1924), army nurse and daughter of Arthur William Butler, farmer. On 3 April 1946 the couple married at St Bartholomew's Church, Tardebigge, Worcestershire, and in the following year the first of their six children (four sons and two daughters) was born.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Donald McMorran joined the St Paul's watch to protect the cathedral from bomb and fire damage, and also worked on the drawing team that designed the concrete casings for the Mulberry harbour used during the Normandy landings in 1944. After a hiatus in architectural projects during the early 1940s Farquharson and McMorran's work increased significantly later in the decade due to the urgent need for public housing and the accommodation of such vital services as education, policing, and public administration. Most of their work during this period was in and around London. The Phoenix School (1950&#150;52) for children with special needs on Bow Road for London county council [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/97268', "London county council architects")</script>] was notable for its unpretentious design and careful spatial planning of interconnected concrete-framed and glass blocks arranged around grassed courtyards, creating a safe and stimulating atmosphere. The project won an RIBA London architecture bronze medal in 1952.<br>
<br>The 1950s was a period of transition for Farquharson and McMorran as the elder partner neared retirement and the practice gained a growing list of commissions, including several housing and schools projects in London, the new campus of the King's School, Chester (1956&#150;66), and, most significantly, the new offices for Devon county council, in Exeter (1954&#150;63). George Whitby now moved into the spare rooms on the top two floors at 14 North Audley Street. Having passed his architectural examination in December 1946, he had been appointed an associate and a fellow of the RIBA in 1947 and 1954 respectively. After a brief period as a partner in the firm of Walters and Kerr-Bate, Whitby lectured at Hammersmith College of Art while pursuing architecture through competitions. In 1950 he came third in the contest for a new secondary school at Hunstanton, won by Alison and Peter Smithson. Four years later he designed Plashet county secondary school for girls (1954) in East Ham, London, a seven-storey building made from pre-cast, pre-stressed components and lauded for its economical use of materials and its standardized design.<br>
<br>In 1958 George Whitby formally joined Farquharson's and McMorran's practice, which soon after became McMorran and Whitby after Farquharson's retirement. The new partner brought renewed energy to the office, his exuberance complementing McMorran's discipline, and in many ways theirs was an ideal mix of talents. The period between 1958 and McMorran's death in 1965 proved the most prolific and successful of their careers. Principal commissions from these years included the superbly crisp Cripps Hall at Nottingham University (1957&#150;9), the dignified collection of offices of West Suffolk county council at Bury St Edmunds (1957&#150;68), the beautifully planned housing estates at Lammas Green (1955&#150;7) and Holloway Road (1959&#150;75) for the corporation of London, and the perfectly composed city police station, Wood Street, London (1959&#150;66).<br>
<br>The corporation of London became a major client, for whom McMorran and Whitby worked on their last joint project, the central criminal court extension at the Old Bailey, London (1960&#150;72). Described as a &#145;splendid fortress of the law&#146;  (Sir John Betjeman to Charmian Whitby, 14 Mar 1973, priv. coll.), its design was largely finalized by McMorran though construction was not completed until nearly seven years after his death. The court's fa&ccedil;ade is dominated by giant recessed segmental-arched window openings; these allow dramatic vertical strips of stone (containing ventilating shafts) to cascade down to beautifully angled chamfers that drive into the wall above the four low doorways. It is a structure that appears hewn, not built. Both peerless and ageless in an era of radical design ideologies, the central criminal court extension was later said to have &#145;stepped effortlessly beyond modernism without the struggles and indecision which have characterized the same step among others&#146;  (Appleyard, <span class="italic">The Times</span>, 20 Nov 1982). It encapsulated also McMorran and Whitby's approach to architecture&#151;their attention to detail, their consideration of materials and the craft tradition, the symbiosis of plan and elevation, and an emphasis on humanist values in design. Often labelled traditionalists, McMorran and Whitby were nothing of the sort. Both believed passionately in progress, but were not convinced by the rhetoric of the modernist movement dominant at the time, seeking instead&#151;as the architect William Eden noted shortly after McMorran's death&#151;&#145;a means of humanizing the monster buildings demanded by our present society&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 14 Aug 1965). Thus, in his capacity as assessor to the Golden Lane estate, London (1952), which preceded the neighbouring Barbican estate (1957&#150;82), McMorran had awarded the project to Geoffrey Powell (later of Chamberlin, Powell, and Bon) precisely because of his exceptional planning of a modern design incorporating housing, shops, and community and sports facilities.<br>
<br>With his strong views and conviction that the craft of building should be a central part of architectural education, McMorran's forthright attitude earned him respect and reprobation in equal measure, with relations being particularly strained with Sir Basil Spence, president of the RIBA from 1958 to 1960. He fought his ground on the various professional posts he held, including the RIBA's education committee (1952&#150;4), for which he produced the &#145;McMorran report&#146; (1955) on architects' training, a passionate denunciation of the growing trend for theoretical over practical studies. In 1956 he became master of the Art-Workers' Guild and was elected an associate and then a full academician of the Royal Academy of Arts, in 1955 and 1962 respectively. In 1965 he served briefly, and unhappily, as treasurer of the academy, where his views on education and training&#151;also pursued through the media and in regular letters to <span class="italic">The Times</span>&#151;revived his feud with Spence.<br>
<br>Donald McMorran died of bowel cancer on 6 August 1965 at his home, 1 Falkland Grove, Dorking, Surrey, and was buried at Dorking cemetery on 13 August. Thereafter supervision of the central criminal court extension passed to his former partner, who was wholly responsible for planning the building's interior of twelve court rooms. George Whitby died on 22 February 1973 at his home, Tylers End, Tylers Green, Penn, Buckinghamshire. His death came several days before a large IRA car bomb was detonated outside the criminal court extension, which, in contrast to surrounding buildings, survived virtually unmarked.<br>
