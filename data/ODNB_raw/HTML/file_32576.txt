<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Corry,  Montagu William  Lowry</span>, Baron Rowton  (1838&#150;1903), <span class="occ">politician and philanthropist</span>, was born in London on 8 October 1838, the third of four children (second of two sons) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6355/', "Henry Thomas Lowry Corry (1803&#150;1873)")</script> and his wife, Lady Harriet Anne Ashley-Cooper (<i>d</i>. 1868), second daughter of the sixth earl of Shaftesbury and granddaughter of the fourth duke of Marlborough; Corry's paternal grandfather was the second earl of Belmore, whose wife (his cousin) was a daughter of the second earl of Carrick. Monty Corry was educated at Harrow School and at Trinity College, Cambridge (BA 1861); he was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1863 and then joined the Oxford circuit. Successful in his profession and popular in society, he was also an occasional contributor to <span class="italic">The Owl</span>.<br>
<br>On 31 August 1865 at the duke of Cleveland's Raby Castle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7689/', "Benjamin Disraeli")</script> observed the handsome young man amusing some bored young women by dancing while singing a comic song, and told him, &#145;I think you must be my impresario&#146;. On 29 June 1866, when Lord Derby was forming his third administration, Corry reminded Disraeli of their meeting, although he could &#145;scarcely presume to ask for the honour of being Private Secretary to yourself&#146;. Disraeli, however, offered him the post, and on 11 July Corry wrote: &#145;it will be owing to no neglect on my part, if I fail to prove myself worthy of it&#146;. True to his word, he served Disraeli faithfully both in and out of office until (and even after) Disraeli's death in 1881.<br>
<br>Disraeli quickly developed great confidence in Corry, and by the autumn of 1866 was praising his work and frankly discussing with him his views on men and affairs. Meanwhile, Corry began keeping Disraeli informed of the opinions current in society. In October Disraeli asked him to be the nominal editor of a collection of his speeches on parliamentary reform; it appeared in January 1867. One of Corry's first assignments was to protect Mrs Disraeli at Grosvenor Gate from the crowds agitating for reform in Hyde Park, when he concluded, &#145;she sympathizes with them&#146;. He and Mrs Disraeli became close friends; from his watch by her deathbed in 1872 Disraeli wrote, &#145;She says she must see you&#146;. With the termination of her life interest in her first husband's estate, Disraeli left the search for a new town residence entirely to Corry, who increasingly looked after Disraeli's personal affairs, such as (in 1874) the redecoration of Downing Street, and the purchase of a wedding gift for the countess of Pembroke. Corry nevertheless maintained his freedom to look after his own family, especially his frail unmarried sister, Alice, who after 1873 usually lived with him at 71 South Audley Street. Disraeli invariably bemoaned his absences.<br>
<br>Although he never sought any higher office, Corry became so much an extension of Disraeli (especially in domestic affairs) that, as Lord Carnarvon remarked in 1874, &#145;M. Corry is in fact Prime Minister.&#146; He vetted political hopefuls, controlled access to the prime minister, suggested positions on major issues, and was Disraeli's link with the social world. After an invitation to Osborne in January 1868, he became friends with the queen, and established good relations with the court circle, as well as with the prince of Wales and his friends. Corry was privy to Disraeli's most confidential dealings, and attended him at cabinet meetings from an adjoining room, most famously in 1876, when Disraeli by a signal sent him to Baron Rothschild for a loan of &pound;4 million to purchase the khedive of Egypt's shares in the Suez Canal. In May 1877, when Disraeli (now Lord Beaconsfield) was too ill to attend cabinet meetings, the queen summoned Corry to report to her.<br>
<br>The heavy workload undermined Corry's health with bouts of depression, most seriously in early 1878, when he went abroad with his sister. Beaconsfield had other secretaries, but &#145;no substitute for him&#146;. Corry recovered in time to attend Beaconsfield at the Congress of Berlin in June and was present at the seven-minute meeting with Bismarck that broke the impasse with Russia in England's favour. Also in 1878, Corry negotiated with Longman the unprecedented sum of &pound;10,000 for <span class="italic">Endymion</span>, Beaconsfield entrusting him with completing the novel if necessary.<br>
<br>Corry never married, but he had many affairs and several children, whom he provided for as their godfather; one of his daughters was Violet Manners, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49527/', "Violet Manners")</script>, wife of the eighth duke of Rutland  (Lambert, 79). The queen originally saw him as &#145;a man of pleasure&#146;, and Beaconsfield remarked, &#145;What a Lothario Monty is&#146;. His most enduring liaison was with Lady Mary Dawson (from 1872 countess of Ilchester). Beaconsfield bemusedly tolerated this aspect of Corry's life; during one absence in 1879 he remarked to Lady Bradford: &#145;I want him, &amp; could have commanded his presence, but I can't work with a man, perpetually sighing, &amp; whose thoughts are in another place. In a week's time, I hope, he will think only of me&#146;  (Zetland, 2.243).<br>
<br>On leaving office in 1880, Beaconsfield told Lord Barrington that &#145;he chiefly deplored his fall from power on account of M. Corry, who in his opinion was fitted to fill any <i>Cabinet</i> office&#146;. When Corry loyally declined the many posts offered him, Beaconsfield recommended him for a peerage, making sure that Corry's aunt, Lady Charlotte Lyster, would bequeath him her estate (listed in 1883 at 6300 acres yielding &pound;5600 a year) to support the dignity. On 6 May 1880 he was controversially created Baron Rowton, of Rowton Castle, Shropshire, an unprecedented honour for a secretary. He continued (unpaid) as Beaconsfield's secretary, and was with his &#145;dearest Chief&#146;&#151;who typically addressed him as &#145;my dearest Monty&#146;&#151;when he died on 19 April 1881. Beaconsfield left all his private papers unconditionally to Rowton, who did much of the original work of putting them in order and preserved material (such as the Henrietta Sykes papers) which Sir Philip Rose wanted to destroy. Rowton was frequently the queen's guest, adviser, and link with her former prime minister and, after Beaconsfield's death, with parliament and the Conservatives.<br>
<br>During 1889 Rowton developed philanthropic interests; in November he accepted an active trusteeship of the Guinness Trust Fund for the provision of artisans' dwellings in London and Dublin and, after inheriting his aunt's estate in December, conceived the idea of a poor man's hotel. Against advice he invested &pound;30,000 in the first Rowton House, opened on the last day of 1892 in Bond Street, Vauxhall. Rowton Houses Limited was incorporated in March 1894, and five more houses were opened by 1905, providing cheap but respectable accommodation for over 5000 men while realizing a modest profit.<br>
<br>Rowton was made a CB in 1878, a KCVO in 1897, and sworn of the privy council in 1900; he was also a deputy lieutenant for Shropshire. He died of pneumonia at his residence, 17 Berkeley Square, on 9 November 1903, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery; he left his property to a nephew, but his title became extinct.<br>
<br>Lord Salisbury, who considered appointing Rowton to the Berlin embassy, said of him in 1895:<blockquote>He is charming, and sympathetically intelligent, without being what people call &#145;clever&#146;. His disposition is most sociable, and he delights in knowing all about his friends' griefs and joys, and helping them. Art and nature are words that mean nothing to him, so his whole mind is turned to friends.</blockquote>Disraeli's experience with Rowton is reflected in chapter 49 of <span class="italic">Endymion</span>:<blockquote>The relations between a minister and his secretary are &hellip; among the finest that can subsist between two individuals. Except the married state, there is none in which so great a degree of confidence is involved, in which more forbearance ought to be exercised, or more sympathy ought to exist.</blockquote>Queen Victoria said that Rowton devoted himself to Disraeli &#145;as few sons ever do&#146;, and it is as Disraeli's model secretary that he will always be known.<br>
