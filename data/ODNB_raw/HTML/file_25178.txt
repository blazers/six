<span class="headword">Seymour, Sir  Michael</span>  (1802&#150;1887), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25177/', "Rear-Admiral Sir Michael Seymour, first baronet (1768&#150;1834)")</script>, and his wife, Jane Hawker (<i>d</i>. 1852), was born on 3 December 1802. He entered the navy in December 1813 on board the <i>Hannibal</i>, with his father, but when she was paid off he was sent back to school, and in March 1816 was entered at the Royal Naval College at Portsmouth. On passing out from the college he was appointed in October 1818 to the <i>Rochefort</i>, which was going out to the Mediterranean with the flag of Sir Thomas Francis Fremantle. In her, and afterwards in the <i>Ganymede</i>, with Captain Robert Cavendish Spencer, he continued until he was promoted lieutenant on 12 September 1822. In July 1823 he joined the <i>Sybille</i> (Captain Samuel John Brooke Pechell), and was present at the demonstration against Algiers in 1824. On 6 December 1824 he was promoted commander, and in August 1825 was appointed to the brig <i>Chameleon</i> in the channel, and was made captain on 5 August 1826. In January 1827 he was appointed to the <i>Menai</i> for the South American station, which then included both the east and west coasts of South America and all the eastern Pacific. In September 1827 he was moved into the <i>Volage</i>, in which he returned to England in the spring of 1829. On 22 June 1829 he married his first cousin Dora 
    (or Dorothea; 1807&#150;1875)
  , daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15748/', "Sir William Knighton")</script>. They had a son, Michael Francis Knighton (1841&#150;1909), and three daughters.<br>
<br>In 1832 Seymour's father, who had been appointed to command the South American station, wished to have him as his flag captain. This the Admiralty refused, but in June 1833 he was appointed to the <i>Challenger</i>, in which he joined his father at Rio. He was afterwards sent round to the Peruvian coast, but returned to Rio on the news of his father's death. Later, on his way back to the Pacific, the <i>Challenger</i>, by an abnormal and previously unknown reversal of the current, was wrecked at Mocquilla Point, near Leubu, on the coast of Chile, on 19 May 1835. The men landed and were rescued after spending seven weeks shipwrecked. Seymour was court-martialled but acquitted of all blame and highly commended for his conduct following the wreck. In 1841 he commanded the <i>Britannia</i> as flag captain to Sir John Acworth Ommanney, and then the <i>Powerful</i>, which he paid off early in 1842.<br>
<br>From 1845 to 1848 Seymour commanded the <i>Vindictive</i> as flag captain to Sir Francis William Austen on the North America and West Indies station. In 1849 he made a prolonged tour in France, visiting the dockyards, arsenals, and engineering works, on which he reported to the Admiralty. In December 1850 he was appointed superintendent of Sheerness Dockyard, from which, in September 1851, he was transferred to Devonport, with the rank of commodore of the first class. In 1854, when war with Russia was imminent, he was appointed captain of the fleet ordered to the Baltic under the command of Sir Charles Napier. In this capacity Seymour had the unenviable responsibility of preparing the equipment and training the ships of the hastily assembled fleet. His reluctance to take the post reflected the obvious difficulties of the task. In addition, Seymour was expected to smooth relations between the irascible Napier, his subordinates, and later his French allies. At the same time he was requested to keep up a correspondence with the first lord, Sir James Graham, and Admiral Sir Maurice Berkeley, the senior naval lord. Promoted rear-admiral on 27 May 1854, Seymour remained in post until the end of the campaign, though he could not prevent a major quarrel developing between Napier and Graham, or the breakdown of relations between the admiral and some of his senior captains. In 1855 Seymour was appointed second in command in the Baltic to Rear-Admiral Sir Richard Dundas, and demonstrated his ability as a combat commander in detached positions. During the campaign he was blinded in one eye when one of the sea mines that had been picked up off Kronstadt exploded while he was examining it.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1856 Seymour went out overland to take command of the China station. Early in October he received news of the seizure of the British coaster <i>Arrow</i> by the Chinese authorities at Canton (Guangzhou). The governor of Hong Kong, Sir John Bowring, requested Seymour to bring pressure to bear on the Chinese viceroy. Accordingly Seymour seized the forts that covered the approaches to Canton, and, as the Chinese were obstinate, occupied the Bogue (Humen) forts. Troops were sent out from Britain, and Lord Elgin arrived with full powers to negotiate. However, the troops were ordered instead to India to suppress the mutiny and Lord Elgin followed them to Calcutta. Meantime the Chinese junk fleet was destroyed after a sharp action in the Fatshan (Foshan) Creek on 1 June 1857; on the arrival of other troops and the return of Lord Elgin, as the Chinese viceroy still refused all concessions, Seymour pushed up the river, and, after a clever feint, attacked and captured Canton with very little loss on 28&#150;9 December 1857. The viceroy was captured and sent, a prisoner, to Calcutta. As the Chinese government at Peking (Beijing) refused to negotiate, Lord Elgin considered it necessary to move the scene of action to the north. At the end of April 1858 Seymour, in his flagship, the <i>Calcutta</i>, arrived in the Gulf of Pecheli (Beizhili), and, on the request of Elgin, took the forts at the mouth of the Peiho (Beihe) on 20 May, and forced the passage up the river as far as Tientsin (Tianjin), where on 26 June the treaty of Tientsin was signed, in which the Chinese government conceded the demands of the British minister. This campaign reflected the lessons of the Baltic campaigns that, with the proper equipment, coastal forts could be successfully engaged from the sea.<br>
<br>Seymour afterwards escorted Lord Elgin to Japan, returned to Hong Kong, and reached England early in the following summer, at the end of his term of three years. The success of his operations in the Second Opium War was largely due to his foresight and attention to detail, though Lord Elgin publicly accused him of prevarication and delay in moving up to the Peiho and undertaking active operations. The charges were refuted by the Admiralty, and appeared absurd in the light of the failure of Sir James Hope's attack on the same forts in 1859. Seymour was made a GCB on 20 May 1859, and shortly afterwards was presented by the China merchants with a handsome service of plate. On 9 August 1859 he was returned to parliament as Liberal member for Devonport; he resigned his seat in February 1863. In January 1860 the duke of Somerset wanted Seymour to become senior naval lord, but the necessary reshuffling of seats could not be accomplished.<br>
<br>On 1 November 1860 Seymour was promoted vice-admiral, and on 5 March 1864 admiral. From March 1863 to March 1866 he was commander-in-chief at Portsmouth. In 1870 he was put on the retired list, and in 1875 was nominated to the then honorary office of vice-admiral of the United Kingdom. He died at his home, Cadlington House, near Horndean, Hampshire, on 23 February 1887. Seymour was a talented, professional officer who combined nautical accomplishments and diplomatic skill with success in operational command. His early promotion to captain's rank, at a time of very slow movement on the Navy List, was entirely due to the influence of his father.<br>
