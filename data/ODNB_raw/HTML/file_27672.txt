<span class="headword">Travers,  Rebecca</span>  (<em>c.</em>1609&#150;1688), <span class="occ">Quaker preacher and writer</span>, was the daughter of a Baptist. She married William Travers, a tobacconist at the Three Feathers, Watling Street, London, who died in 1664. She had been &#145;a reader of the Scriptures from a child of six&#146;  (Sewel, 2.329). Attending the Baptist church in Broad Street, where James Nayler, the Quaker leader, was holding a dispute, she was astonished to see &#145;the Countryman [who] stood up on a Form over against the Baptists and they were so far from getting victory that she could hear his words smote them&#146;  (Travers, 18). She was converted to the Quakers by Nayler after a dinner party where she was moved by his attack on &#145;forbidden knowledge&#146;, and she later claimed to renounce all intellectual pretensions. After Nayler's punishment and humiliation she dressed his wounds, and at his release from prison in 1659 he stayed at her house; she wrote a &#145;certificate&#146; on his behalf to parliament.<br>
<br>Travers became a leading woman preacher in London, sometimes preaching in the streets and suffering several imprisonments&#151;often for defending Quaker prisoners in her role as prison visitor in London and Ipswich. She acted both as host and minister at the &#145;six weeks meetings&#146; held at her own house. The leader of the Quakers' women's meeting in London, she issued <span class="italic">A Woman's Paper for Order</span> to stop gossip and backbiting. She attended at the &#145;second day morning meeting&#146;, the editorial board for Quaker publications. The conducting of Quaker marriages and care for poor Friends were also part of her duties. In her &#145;unsuitable great house&#146; Travers hosted visiting preachers such as George Whitehead, the Quaker leader, in 1664, and also George Fox: &#145;I was never better pleased with my house then when hee was in it&#146;  (Swarthmore MSS, 1.395).<br>
<br>Travers was the author of ten separate pamphlets as well as some postscripts and testimonies attached to others' writings: &#145;One Rebecca Trewish in Watling streit is a wryter of books and gets them prented by Widow Dover&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1664&#150;5</i>, 148). Adept equally at polemics and theology, she wrote for those both within and outside Quaker society. She directed her quill especially against apostate brethren; in <span class="italic">The Harlot's Vail Rent</span> (1669) she accused Elizabeth Atkinson of betrayal for inverting Quaker language to attack her former colleagues. Others were attacked for interfering with Friends or denying their principles (<span class="italic">For those that &hellip; Worship at &hellip; John Evangelist</span>, 1659). In <span class="italic">A Testimony Concerning the Life and Light of Jesus</span> (1663) she expounded the Quaker concern for &#145;inner&#146; life and preached renunciation of earthly power and conflict. Often she rebutted other pamphleteers, but she also took on the government for enforcing the <span class="roman">Conformity Act</span> (<span class="italic">This is for All &hellip; that Resist the Spirit</span>, 1664). Later in life she wrote &#145;testimonies&#146; for Quakers such as William Bayly (1676), Susanne Whitrow (1677), Alice Curwen (1680), and Anne Whitehead (1686).<br>
<br>Travers tried to reconcile the factions that developed between the followers of Fox and John Perrot, an antinomian, who denied all forms of worship. Her own sister Mary Booth became an adherent of Perrot. Travers wrote using feminine imagery: &#145;My dear Brethren and Sisters &hellip; all drawing from the one Breast the milk of the Word &hellip; for the Coat of the Lord is seamless&#146;  (<span class="italic">Testimony</span>, 10). Later she assured Fox that she wished only for unity among the Quakers. She wrote to him to clear herself of having worked to &#145;strengthen that Spirit of Gainsaying&#146;  (Travers to Fox, 17 Aug 1676, Gibson MS 8ii.335/119).<br>
<br>Throughout, Travers believed in the primacy of faith over institutions, but she worked within those institutions for unity among Friends. Accused of self-aggrandizement&#151;&#145;being a Great Mother and Governess&#146;&#151;she presented herself instead as &#145;a servant to this people&#146;  (Mack, 320) and defended Fox's party to maintain unity in the face of persecution.<br>
<br>Travers died, aged about seventy-nine, on 15 June 1688 in London. She was survived by a son, Matthew, and at least one daughter. Her funeral sermon was preached by William Penn in 1688.<br>
