<span class="headword">Holloway,  Benjamin</span>  (1690/91&#150;1759), <span class="occ">religious controversialist and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Stony Stratford, Buckinghamshire, the son of Joseph Holloway (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1720), a maltster. Holloway was educated under Dr Thomas Knipe at Westminster School, where he was a bishop's boy, and matriculated from St John's College, Cambridge, on 4 February 1708, aged seventeen. In 1713 he graduated LLB and on 5 July was ordained deacon by William Wake, bishop of Lincoln. He was appointed vicar of Willington and of Renhold, both in Bedfordshire, and was ordained priest on 27 May 1716. By this time Holloway had made the acquaintance of John Woodward. In 1715 he began work on a translation from Latin into English of a reply to Elias Camerarius, who had criticized Woodward's ideas about the geological history of the earth. From Bedford, where he was also acting as tutor to a noble family, Holloway wrote to Woodward on 6 July 1723 about a visit that he had made to the fuller's-earth pits at Wavendon, near Woburn. In this letter, which was subsequently published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>, he provided evidence for Woodward's theories concerning the laying down of rocks and minerals in strata. With the support of Sir Hans Sloane, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 30 November 1723.<br>
<br>Holloway's translation of Woodward's answer to Camerarius was published as <span class="italic">The Natural History of the Earth</span> in 1726. In this volume, which was translated into French by Jean Pierre Niceron in 1735 and into Italian in 1739, he also printed several of Woodward's letters and papers, concerning ancient mythology, biblical history, and the importance of the blood for sustaining life. On 17 March 1726 Holloway was presented by the crown to the second portion of the rectory of Waddesdon, Buckinghamshire, which he held together with the rectory of Middleton Stoney, Oxfordshire, where he had taken up residence in 1725. He resigned the living of Waddesdon on his preferment by Charles Spencer, third duke of Marlborough, to the rectory of Bladon in March 1736. In 1739 he handed the care of Bladon on to one of his sons, also called Benjamin Holloway.<br>
<br>From Middleton Stoney, Holloway composed an account of the pits at Headington, near Oxford, which he sent to the Royal Society in 1729, but he was prevented from attending the society's meetings by the distance that he lived from London. In the early 1730s he wrote annotations to <span class="roman">Ecclesiastes</span> &#145;in which there is a good deal that is Philosophical&#146;  (BL, Sloane MS 4051, fols. 105&#150;6) and tried unsuccessfully to persuade Sloane to publish parts of them in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>. By this time Holloway had begun to espouse some of the views of John Hutchinson about the interpretation of the Hebrew <span class="roman">Bible</span> and its implications for an understanding of nature. In particular, he now distrusted the use made by many divines of the <span class="roman">Septuagint</span> (the Greek <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>). In 1727 Holloway had published a work of controversial divinity, <span class="italic">An after-Commendation of the New-Lutheran's Answer</span>, and during the following decade he continued to write critically about contemporary theology. <span class="italic">The Commemorative Sacrifice</span>, a sermon that he preached at Woodstock on 8 October 1736, was based on his unpublished criticisms of Benjamin Hoadley, to whom he also addressed <span class="italic">Some Remarks</span> in 1741. <span class="italic">The Nullity of Repentance without Faith</span> (1739), which published three of his sermons, replied to the ideas of the deist Thomas Chubb. In a supplement to this work, Holloway deployed some of the ideas of Hutchinson and his followers about the significance of figurative language in the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, in particular suggesting that Melchizedek was a manifestation of Christ before the incarnation. Unable to print it at Oxford because of the opposition of the vice-chancellor, Theophilus Leigh, Holloway published <span class="italic">The True Doctrine of Repentance Vindicated</span> ([1739]) in London. Towards the end of 1744 he lived in the house of John Spencer, Marlborough's younger brother, acting as tutor to Spencer's son, John, afterwards first Earl Spencer. He became increasingly involved in the academic controversies that were developing over Hutchinson's theories, criticizing Thomas Hunt, Laudian professor of Arabic at Oxford, and his allies, who argued that knowledge of Arabic might help to explain the true meaning of obscure terms in the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>. In 1750 his <span class="italic">Marginal Animadversions on Mr. Costard's Two Late Dissertations</span> appeared, followed in 1751 by <span class="italic">Remarks on Dr Sharp's Pieces on the Words Elohim and Berith</span>, to which both Thomas Sharp and George Kalmar replied, and in 1754 by <span class="italic">The Primaevity and Preeminence of the Sacred Hebrew</span>. Holloway's own version of Hutchinsonian biblical criticism, <span class="italic">Originals Physical and Theological Sacred and Profane</span>, was composed during the 1740s with the encouragement of Duncan Forbes and published in two volumes in 1751, with a dedication to John Carteret, second Earl Granville, to whose mother Holloway had been chaplain in the 1720s. This work was largely concerned with the exposition of the meaning of the Hebrew text of <span class="roman">Genesis</span>, as was <span class="italic">Letter and Spirit</span> (1753), in which Holloway again relied on Hutchinsonian principles for the interpretation of the roots from which Hebrew words were derived. The reflections on the allegorical and spiritual interpretation of scripture that Holloway included in <span class="italic">Letter and Spirit</span> were a response to the work of the French critic Charles Fran&ccedil;ois Houbigant.<br>
<br>Holloway's links with the Hutchinsonians and their ideas, which were generally hostile to contemporary Judaism, may also help to explain his opposition to the <span class="roman">Jewish Naturalization Act</span>. Because of this, he voted against the whig candidate supported by his patron, the duke of Marlborough, at the Oxfordshire election in 1754. By this time, however, Holloway was in poor health and he died at Middleton Stoney on 10 April 1759. He was buried at the church there on 13 April. George Horne, who had been encouraged by Holloway during his studies for ordination, afterwards sorted through Holloway's unpublished papers and remarked on &#145;the example of his indefatigable industry &amp; primitive devotion&#146;  (CUL, Add. MS 8134, A/2, p. 90).<br>
