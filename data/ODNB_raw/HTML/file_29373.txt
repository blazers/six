<span class="headword">Wightman, Sir  William</span>  (1785&#150;1863), <span class="occ">judge</span>, the eldest son of William Wightman, gentleman, of St Clement's, London, a member of an old Dumfriesshire family, and his wife, Elizabeth, was baptized on 2 September 1785 at St Clement Danes, Westminster. He matriculated at University College, Oxford, on 23 March 1801, and in the same year moved to Queen's College as a Michel exhibitioner. He graduated BA in 1805, and MA in 1809. Admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 31 January 1804, Wightman practised initially as a special pleader. In 1819 he married Charlotte Mary, a daughter of James Baird of Lasswade near Edinburgh; they had four daughters.<br>
<br>Wightman was called to the bar in 1821, and in 1830 joined the Inner Temple <i>ad eundem</i>. On the northern circuit his reputation as a sound and clear-headed lawyer brought him a large practice. He was engaged in the prosecutions arising out of the Bristol riots of 1831, but owing to his modesty was little known outside the profession. He gave assistance to the law officers of the crown for several years as junior counsel to the Treasury, and was appointed in 1831 to the royal commission on the courts of common law, and in 1833 to the commission concerned to codify the criminal law.<br>
<br>On the resignation of Mr Justice Littledale, Wightman was appointed a justice of the court of queen's bench on 15 February 1841, and was knighted on 28 April of the same year. He served as a judge for nearly twenty-three years as the trusted colleague of three successive chief justices. He had a sound knowledge of the law, combined with patience, courtesy, and clear reasoning. As at the bar, he did not seek distinction, but fulfilled his duties with dignity and simplicity. Beyond his judicial capacity, he was a pleasant companion, and capable of displaying considerable literary knowledge. He was elected an honorary fellow of Queen's College, Oxford, in 1859. Seized with &#145;apoplexy&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>), he died on circuit in the judges' lodgings at York on 10 December 1863.<br>
