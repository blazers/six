<span class="headword">Cawston,  (Edwin) Richard</span>  (1923&#150;1986), <span class="occ">documentary film-maker</span>, was born on 31 May 1923 in Weybridge, Surrey, the elder child and elder son of Edwin Cawston, merchant, of Weybridge, and his wife, Phyllis, daughter of Henry Charles Hawkins. He always wanted to make films; as a boy at Westminster School he and a friend made a documentary of the school's evacuation to Lancing. In 1941 he joined the Royal Signals and then spent two terms at Oriel College, Oxford, doing an army short course in radio, electricity, and magnetism. He became a captain in 1945, and a major in 1946, while serving in the southern command in India. When he was demobilized in 1947, he took a post as assistant film librarian with the newly reopened BBC television service in Alexandra Palace.<br>
<br>Cawston did not stay a librarian for long. He soon became film editor and then the producer of the popular <span class="italic">Television Newsreel</span>. Between 1950 and 1954 he produced 700 editions and gained a depth of experience in the technicalities of film craftsmanship which few of his television contemporaries could equal. This early experience of volume production under pressure was the foundation of his success as one of Britain's (and later the world's) most respected television documentary producers over a period of thirty years. It is also a key to the kind of producer he became; he was a capable camera director, but he showed his greatest strengths in the cutting room and dubbing theatre after the film had been shot. The newsreel years gave him a grounding in the shaping and pacing of film, and the adding of commentary, music, and effects, which were to be of great value in guiding the work of younger producers as well as in developing his own.<br>
<br>In 1954 <span class="italic">Television Newsreel</span> lost its battle to stay independent of the BBC news division and Cawston left to join the talks department of the television service, as a documentary producer. The age of the old film documentary makers such as John Grierson and (F.) Humphrey Jennings was dead; Cawston was present at the birth of the new documentary on television. He produced a long series of major documentary films, many of which won national and international awards. He was especially interested in institutions and professions, with whom his frank and open approach, and high professionalism, created a trust which gained him an entr&eacute;e that would have been refused to most producers. His films documented the worlds of lawyers, pilots, the National Health Service, the British educational system, and, perhaps most memorably, the BBC itself in <span class="italic">This is the BBC</span> (1959). There was no &#145;typical Cawston&#146; film because he did not impose his own views or slant on his subject matter. His aim was to let the subject speak for itself, usually with the minimum of narration or (as in the BBC film) none at all. The common factor was meticulous craftsmanship.<br>
<br>In 1965, just after the start of BBC2, he was made head of documentary programmes. It was here that for fourteen years he coached and developed a new generation of documentary makers. The sessions in which he looked at rough assemblies of their films were master-classes that refined the skills of many of today's leading documentary makers. But he did not stop making his own films; <span class="italic">Royal Family</span>, in which he recorded a year (1968&#150;9) in the private and public life of the queen, was at that time the most popular and widely seen documentary in television history, and did much to restore the popularity the monarchy had lost in the mid-1960s. It led to his becoming the producer of the queen's Christmas day broadcast to the Commonwealth from 1970 to 1985, and to his appointment as CVO in 1972.<br>
<br>For most of his working life Cawston was an active and influential member of BAFTA, the television and film-makers' professional body; he was chairman from 1976 to 1979, and a trustee from 1971 until his death in 1986. It was largely through his energy and enterprise that BAFTA secured its home at 195 Piccadilly, and it was due to his advocacy that the queen made the initial major donation towards its funding out of the sales revenues of <span class="italic">Royal Family</span>.<br>
<br>Cawston left the BBC in 1979, having won almost all the major professional prizes, including the Italia prize (1962), three BAFTA awards, and the silver medal of the Royal Television Society (1961). He joined Video Arts Ltd as special projects director, but continued producing programmes for the BBC as an independent executive producer, and acting as consultant to the government and tourist board of Hong Kong.<br>
<br>Cawston was tall, clean-shaven, and well built; his dress was reassuringly conventional, more like that of a family solicitor than the usual image of a film-maker. In 1951 he married Elisabeth Anne (Liz), daughter of Richard Llewellyn Rhys, of St Fagans, canon of Llandaff. They had two sons. She died in 1977, and in 1978 he married Andrea, daughter of Michael Phillips, company director, of Cyprus. Cawston died of a heart attack in Cassis, France, on 7 June 1986.<br>
