<span class="headword">Oxenham,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1536&#150;1580), <span class="occ">sea captain</span>, was by his own account a native of Plymouth. He accompanied Sir Francis Drake's 1572 raid upon Nombre de Dios, on the Caribbean coast of the Panama isthmus; of him and Thomas Sherwell, the English mariners were said to have &#145;conceived greatest hope of them next our Captaine&#146;  (Wright, 169, 322). At Nombre de Dios, Oxenham and John Drake were appointed by their now injured leader to lead an attack upon the treasure-house there, but were obliged to withdraw when Francis Drake collapsed. The success of Drake's expedition inclined Oxenham to make his own attempt on the isthmus in 1576. With fifty-seven men and a ship of 100 tons' burden, he departed from England on 9 April. According to his later testimony, he intended to trade with the <i>cimarrones</i>&#151;escaped black slaves who preyed upon Spanish possessions in the isthmus&#151;but his subsequent actions indicate that any trade he undertook was only to acquire allies in plunder. In his ship he carried two dismantled pinnaces; these he assembled and, leaving his ship in a bay to the west of Cartagena, took them to range the isthmus coast. At Veragua his pinnaces assaulted a Spanish ship but were repulsed with some loss. At Acla, some 45 miles from Nombre de Dios, he struck inland and made contact with a group of <i>cimarrones</i>. In the meantime, Spanish forces found and took Oxenham's ship with most of his trading goods and artillery, and destroyed a small fortified camp he had built at Acla. Between September 1576 and February 1577 the Englishmen remained inland with the <i>cimarrones</i> at or near the Pacific watershed. There they built a new boat, and in spring descended the Pi&ntilde;as River to the Pacific shore: the first Englishmen to enter the ocean. For several weeks they raided the Pearl Islands, freeing slaves (whom they handed over to the <i>cimarrones</i>) and, according to Spanish eyewitnesses, desecrating Catholic churches. Finally, at Quayaquil, they captured a bark laden with Peruvian treasure. Following this hugely profitable seizure, they returned to the Pi&ntilde;as to begin their passage back to the Atlantic Ocean.<br>
<br>The Spanish authorities reacted swiftly to these new depredations. A small flotilla sailed north from Lima; at the mouth of the Pi&ntilde;as some 200 soldiers under Juan de Ortega disembarked to pursue the Englishmen. In May 1577 Ortega caught up with and fell upon a group of them, killing several, though Oxenham was elsewhere at the time. A ship's boy who surrendered to the Spaniards disclosed the nearby hiding place of his compatriots' hard-won treasure. The Spaniards thereafter attacked and destroyed the <i>cimarrone</i> village where Oxenham planned to replenish his supplies. Half of his remaining men left the expedition to make for the Atlantic and attempt to steal a boat in which to return home; the <i>cimarrones</i> themselves, apparently angered by Oxenham's refusal to kill every Spaniard he captured, would give no further assistance. When Ortega's men advanced upon them, they fled without warning their English ally. Oxenham and his remaining men were captured on 7 September 1577 in a banana grove near Villano.<br>
<br>The Englishmen were taken to Panama, where, after a brief trial, most were hanged. Oxenham and seven others were taken to Lima. For more than three years the authorities there hesitated to impose the death penalty; but news of Drake's depredations in the Pacific probably inclined them to make an example. Oxenham, his master, and pilot were hanged at Lima, several days after an <i>auto-da-f&eacute;</i> of 29 October 1580; the remaining five captives, all ship's boys, were alive still in 1586. During his interrogation at Panama, Oxenham had given his age as forty-two. Undoubtedly courageous and bold, he wantonly underestimated his enemies and paid the price. He was reported by his interrogators to have been &#145;thick of speech &hellip; of grave demeanour, much feared and respected and obeyed by his soldiers&#146;  (Wright, 112&#150;3, 234). Drake appears to have liked and respected him; while at the port of Calloa de Lima in February 1579, during his circumnavigation, he heard of Oxenham's incarceration and sent a Spanish prisoner to plead for his release and to threaten reprisals if he were executed.<br>
