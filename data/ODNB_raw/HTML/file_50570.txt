<span class="headword">Wallace, Sir  William</span>  (1881&#150;1963), <span class="occ">marine engineer</span>, was born on 25 August 1881 in Paisley, Renfrewshire, the son of Mathew Wallace, master dyer, and his wife, Agnes Reid. His early education was at Paisley grammar school, after which he was taken into apprenticeship in the Paisley shipyard of Bow, McLachlan &amp; Co.; during this time he also attended technical classes at the West of Scotland Technical College in Glasgow. His next step was to gain engineering experience and, as was common at that time, that meant a position as an engineering officer in a prominent shipping line. Wallace joined the British and Burmese Steam Navigation Company, with whom he gained the Board of Trade first class certificate and rose to the rank of chief engineer.<br>
<br>Wallace spent nearly ten years at sea before he came ashore in 1910 and joined the prominent Edinburgh firm of Brown Brothers, hydraulic and general engineers and iron-founders, whose premises were at the Rosebank ironworks. A talent for invention was quickly demonstrated, and Brown Brothers took out patents for his developments with steering gear and hydraulic equipment. In 1916 Wallace was appointed managing director and celebrated his advancement by marrying, on 24 March, Christina, daughter of John Stewart, a coachman. They had a son and a daughter. Brown Brothers was then deeply involved in naval work, especially in supplying gear for submarines; and in 1917 Wallace was on the submarine K13 on a test in the Gareloch when it sank with seventy-seven men on board. He is reported to have stopped water flooding the boat by blocking off the hydraulic system, and was one of the forty-six survivors rescued after being submerged for fifty-seven hours.<br>
<br>Wallace's most long-lasting engineering innovations came in the 1930s, when he was again undertaking work for the Admiralty. He was among the first to develop catapults for the early aircraft-carriers and regularly risked his life by being his own test pilot, insisting that he be the first to be catapulted by each of his improved devices. His most important development came in 1936, when he took out a patent to improve the stability of ships; the device was the first activated fin-ship stabilizer. The idea was ingenious but required considerable development, which was undertaken in co-operation with Maurice Denny (1886&#150;1955) of the famous Dumbarton firm of shipbuilders. Their collaboration finally produced the Denny&#150;Brown stabilizer, the first commercial version being installed in 1937 in the <i>Isle of Park</i>. The innovation was widely used by the Royal Navy during the Second World War to help stabilize gun-platforms, and in the post-war period it came into widespread use in merchant ships.<br>
<br>Brown Brothers prospered under Wallace's engineering inventiveness and shrewd management, and war work greatly extended its facilities until it employed over a thousand men, twice the size it had been when he had joined it before the First World War. Wallace's leadership and contributions to engineering earned him the CBE in 1944 and the KB in 1951. He was an active member of numerous professional associations, notably as vice-president of the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland, and also of the Institute of Marine Engineers. His inventive talent and distinction won for his firm in 1951 a royal commission award of &pound;27,510 for his work on stabilizers (shared with Denny of Dumbarton), and in 1954 the Society of Engineers awarded him the Churchill gold medal. The following year he received the gold medal of the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland, and in 1956 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and had an honorary LLD conferred on him by the University of Edinburgh.<br>
<br>At Brown Brothers, Wallace enjoyed a long and successful career as an inventor and engineer. He was managing director of the firm from 1916 to 1957, and then became chairman for a further two years before retiring. He was well known and respected in the business community and held positions on the boards of the British Linen Bank, Alex Cowan &amp; Son, and the North British Rubber Company. He was also a director of the First, Second, and Third Edinburgh investment trusts, of William Beardmore &amp; Co., and of the Leith shipbuilders Henry Robb &amp; Co. His active business life was backed by his passion for golf. He was a member of the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers (Muirfield) and captain of his local Bruntsfield Links Golfing Society. He was a family man whose son, William, succeeded him on the board of Brown Brothers. When he died on 27 May 1963 in a nursing home at 12 Drumsheugh Gardens, Edinburgh, his entire gross estate was worth over &pound;45,000. His wife survived him. The company with which he was associated almost all his life did not outlast him for very long, as it was taken over by Vickers Ltd in 1970.<br>
