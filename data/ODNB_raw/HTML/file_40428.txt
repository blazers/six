<span class="headword">Hickey,  Emily Henrietta</span>  (1845&#150;1924), <span class="occ">writer and schoolteacher</span>, was born on 12 April 1845 at Castle Macmine, co. Wexford, Ireland (home of her mother's Stewart ancestors), the second of two daughters of Canon John Stewart Hickey and his wife, a Newton-King related to the Stewarts of Stewart Lodge, co. Carlow. She was the granddaughter of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13209/', "Revd William Hickey (1787&#150;1875)")</script>, a philanthropist and writer under the pseudonym of Martin Doyle; her ancestral heritage was Anglo-Irish and Scottish. The family home was in Goresbridge, co. Carlow. Educated at home in early childhood, Emily Hickey attended day school at ten and boarding-school at thirteen. At twenty she published a poem in the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span> and shortly after, some narrative poems in <span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span>, and it became her ambition to be a writer.<br>
<br>Happily for that ambition, the Macmillans invited Emily Hickey to visit and introduced her to their literary circle. Determined to pursue her career in London, she took whatever employment was available to young women at that time: private teacher, secretary, governess, companion. She also took full advantage of the opportunities that London offered. She studied with Andrew Lang and, via correspondence, earned a first-class honours certificate from Cambridge. She attended the lectures of F. J. Furnivall, who was so impressed with her work that he helped her obtain an appointment as lecturer in the London Collegiate School for Girls, where she taught for eighteen years&#151;work for which she was put on the civil pension list. As a member of Furnivall's circle, she took part in Shakespearian readings, where it was remarked that &#145;her voice was singularly musical and her intonation faultless&#146;  (Dinnis, 26). Through Furnivall Hickey met Robert Browning, who admired her poetry and remained a friend until his death. She edited and annotated his &#145;Strafford&#146; and with Furnivall founded the Browning Society; her role as honorary secretary was celebrated in a fine caricature by Max Beerbohm.<br>
<br>Emily Hickey continued to write, publishing four volumes of poetry between 1881 and 1901. She translated Anglo-Saxon and French verse, and also wrote essays and criticism. Her interest in social problems brought her to know Conrad Roden Noel and to write on his work, and she also became interested in home rule; her blank-verse essay &#145;Michael Villiers&#146; addressed Irish problems. Her work appeared in major periodicals in America, England, and Ireland.<br>
<br>In the mid-1890s ill health sent Emily on a trip to France, Germany, and Switzerland, the only recorded journey that took her away from the British Isles. Switzerland inspired a series of nature verses, which with other works of this period were published in 1896. On her return to England she dedicated herself to social causes and became an active Anglo-Catholic. On 22 July 1901 she joined the Roman Catholic church, and for a time she wrote for the Catholic Truth Society. Her poetry became devotional and her prose dedicated to Catholic concerns; after her conversion she retracted her first three collections of verse (<span class="italic">A Sculptor</span>, 1881, <span class="italic">Verse-Translations</span>, 1891, and <span class="italic">Michael Villiers</span>), as they had expressed ideas at odds with her newly adopted beliefs. English critics largely ignored her post-conversion work; American and Irish continued to print and comment favourably upon it. In 1912 Pope Pius IX awarded her the gold cross &#145;pro ecclesia et pontifice&#146;. It was hung in the church of St Thomas &agrave; Becket.<br>
<br>In the last two years of Emily Hickey's life her health and sight failed, but she continued to write until she died on 9 September 1924 at the Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth in London. She left a poem, &#145;At Eventide&#146;, to be published after her death.<br>
<br>In retrospect Emily Hickey's is the story of a talented woman who was able to be independent and successful in acquiring higher education and literary reputation. Her biography, together with a selection of her poetry, was published in 1927 by her literary executor, Enid Dinnis. It is as objective a record as a friend and co-religionist can be expected to give, but does not, however, have the last word on Emily's literary reputation. Dinnis wrote,<blockquote>Little by little the brilliant essayist, the erudite student of early English texts, the spoiled child of Victorian verse-makers and co-founder of the Browning Society, receded from the world of letters &hellip; she remained a Victorian to the end. (Dinnis, 47)</blockquote>Interest in Emily Hickey's work has been more lasting than this; in 1982 the musical setting of her translation of the Irish &#145;His Home and his Own Country&#146; was included in <span class="italic">Seven Irish Songs</span>, and the late twentieth century also saw something of a revival of critical attention to her work.<br>
