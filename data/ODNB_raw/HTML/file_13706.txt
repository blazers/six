<span class="headword">Hooper,  John</span>  (1495<span class="mult">x</span>1500&#150;1555), <span class="occ">bishop of Gloucester and Worcester and protestant martyr</span>, was born some time between 1495 and 1500. Little can be said for sure about either his place of origin or his parents. According to Hooper himself, his father was wealthy; there is some evidence to suggest that he had prospered in the cloth trade. Tradition has always claimed that Hooper was a native of Somerset, but there is little evidence to support this assertion, first made by Thomas Tanner in 1748 and repeated ever since. There is, however, good reason to suppose that Hooper was born and raised either in Devon or Oxfordshire. Whatever the exact location of his birth, Hooper's connections with the west country seem sure.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>Hooper was educated at Oxford, graduating BA in 1519. His college is unknown, and his association with Merton College is the result of confusion with another John Hooper (<i>d</i>. 1522), sometimes wrongly thought to be a relation. Foxe claims that Hooper was &#145;a student and graduate in the university &hellip; after the study of sciences wherein he abundantly profited&#146;  (Foxe, 2.1502). But there is little evidence to indicate that Hooper proceeded beyond a BA, although he was styled &#145;professor of divinity&#146; by Edward VI and on the patent rolls, usually a reliable source. Speculation that he received a doctorate at a continental university is also without foundation, despite the claim made by Richard Hilles in the 1540s, that Hooper was studying at Z&uuml;rich.<br>
<br>The period between his BA at Oxford and his emergence as a heterodox thinker in 1539 remains vague. Foxe places Hooper at Oxford for most of this period where he encountered difficulty at the time of the <span class="roman">Act of Six Articles</span> (1539) from &#145;certain rabbins&#146;, most especially Dr Richard Smith  (Foxe, 2.1502). However, it is known from the charges brought against him in 1555 that Hooper was a Cistercian monk at the monastery in Cleeve, Somerset, and he seems to have been resident there. Hooper himself kept silent about this part of his life, but it is likely that he left Oxford some time after 1519 and entered the monastery at Cleeve, leaving in 1537 after the visitation of Sir Thomas Arundell, one of Cromwell's commissioners for the suppression of religious houses. This possibility is strengthened by Hooper's being found in 1538 as rector of Liddington, Wiltshire, a benefice in Arundell's gift. He was certainly a non-resident incumbent, for he appears to have served Arundell as his steward. His conflict with Smith and other Oxford &#145;rabbins&#146; may date from this period but is more likely to have occurred later, when he was in the service of Sir John St Loe after his flight to and return from Paris.<h2>
<a name="Conversionanditsconsequences"></a>Conversion and its consequences</h2>While in the service of Arundell, Hooper encountered the works of Huldrich Zwingli and Heinrich Bullinger for the first time and they changed his life. Hooper himself regarded his encounter with the writings of the Swiss reformers as a kind of &#145;road to Damascus&#146; experience and he was eager thereafter to portray himself as a reprobate renewed and rescued from living &#145;too much of a court life at the palace of our king&#146; by the works of these two divines  (Robinson, <span class="italic">Original Letters</span>, 1.33&#150;4). Quite how much of a reprobate Hooper had in fact been must remain open to question&#151;he had little time or opportunity to experience much of court life. But Hooper seems always to have been a rather severe personality and a harsh judge of the behaviour of others and himself. His conversion to a Zwinglian form of reformed Christianity seems to have served to reinforce and affirm his harsher qualities, ones which all too often made him irascible, stubborn, uncompromising, and even unapproachable.<br>
<br>Arundell was conservative in his religious views, and some time between June 1539 and November 1540 he became concerned about Hooper's new opinions and sent him to Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester, for examination and correction. Their encounter lasted four or five days and was a highly charged affair: neither man had an easy personality, and Hooper's characteristic refusal to alter or compromise his opinions only served to enrage the bishop. Despite Gardiner's promise that he would send Hooper back safely to Arundell, Hooper received intelligence that he was now in danger. According to Foxe, Hooper fled to Paris for an unspecified period, before returning to England and entering the service of Sir John St Loe, constable of Thornbury Castle, Somerset, and a man of evangelical sympathies despite being Arundell's nephew. Hooper himself records nothing of any of these events.<br>
<br>It was not long before Hooper found himself in danger again, though the reasons for his subsequent flight from England remain obscure. It may be that his controversy with Richard Smith at Oxford took place at this time. Despite the protection offered him by Arundell and his affinity, Hooper's encounters with ecclesiastical authorities tended to be explosive, and he seems to have found it impossible not to speak his mind regardless of the consequences. This second flight from England appears to have occurred some time in 1544, and he was certainly in Strasbourg by 1546, in the company of English expatriates and merchants like Richard Hilles, John Burcher, and John Butler. His associations with merchant communities were lifelong and there is some evidence to suggest that Hooper supported himself, at least in part, by trading in cloth. By now he had established contact with most of the major protestant thinkers in Basel, Strasbourg, and Z&uuml;rich, including Martin Bucer, Theodore Biliander, Simon Grinaeus, and Conrad Pelican. But the most important and long-lasting contact he made was with Heinrich Bullinger.<br>
<br>By January 1546 Hooper had already decided to move to Z&uuml;rich permanently. First, however, he returned to England to secure his inheritance from his father, a man he knew to be hostile to reforming ideas. Hooper claimed that he was imprisoned twice while in England (probably at Exeter) and that this depleted his fortune significantly, but there is no other record of these imprisonments. His account also suggests that he became involved in lecturing or preaching to underground protestants. After leaving England he married Anne de Tscerlas [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46906/', "Hooper, Anne")</script>], a Belgian attached to the household of Jacques de Bourgogne, seigneur de Falais. The marriage probably took place in February 1547. They had two children: Rachel, born in 1548, and Daniel, born some time after they returned to England in 1549. Anna Hooper died on 7 December 1555 at Frankfurt during an outbreak of plague and was followed shortly afterwards by her daughter. Daniel seems to have survived only a little longer: nineteenth-century claims for direct descendants from Hooper are without the least foundation.<br>
<br>Once he had returned to the continent Hooper quickly moved to Z&uuml;rich, where he lived near and studied with Bullinger, developing a deep and lasting friendship. Hooper remained in Z&uuml;rich for two years, during which he published three books, <span class="italic">An Answer to my Lord of Wynchesters Booke Intytlyd a Detection of the Devyls Sophistry</span> (1547); <span class="italic">A Declaration of Christ and his Office</span> (1547); and <span class="italic">A Declaration of the Ten Holy Commandments</span> (1548). He appears to have been in no hurry to return to England, although he was aware of the changes in religion begun following the accession of Edward VI. In Z&uuml;rich he found a Christian community that most closely matched his own ideas of the pure and primitive church and it was an environment that he admired. Here he developed his ideas on theology and church polity, influenced by Zwingli and Bullinger, that he brought back with him to England and, eventually, to his dioceses. By 1549, however, Hooper was coming under pressure to return to England, and there seems to have been some expectation that he would be made a bishop.<h2>
<a name="Evangelicalreformer"></a>Evangelical reformer</h2>Hooper arrived in London on 3 May 1549 and was immediately taken into the household of the duke of Somerset. This was probably by prior arrangement, as Hooper seems to have been gathering intelligence for the government about the emperor Charles V as he passed through Brussels, and he was also in contact with the English ambassador Sir Philip Hoby. Once settled in London, Hooper became a leader among the more advanced protestants and his influence appears to have been decisive in the foundation of the two &#145;Stranger Churches&#146; for Dutch and French refugees in London and Glastonbury, which were considered to be models of the Zwinglian form. Hooper was friendly with both the duke of Somerset and the earl of Warwick (later duke of Northumberland) and was useful to them in a variety of ways. Apart from his extensive contacts among the foreign protestant community, most notably his friendship with John &agrave; Lasco, he took part in the trial of Bishop Bonner in 1549 as a witness for the prosecution, an act which Bonner seems never to have forgiven.<br>
<br>Hooper was very popular in London as a preacher and lecturer, although the enthusiasm with which Anabaptists flocked to his addresses annoyed and embarrassed him. So effective was he in the pulpit that his old adversary Richard Smith reported that he was regarded as &#145;a prophet, nay they looked upon him as some deity&#146;  (Strype, <span class="italic">Ecclesiastical Memorials</span>, 2/1.66). He took part in several disputes, including a long and bitter argument with Bartholomew Traheron on predestination&#151;a doctrine with which Hooper seems to have had a great deal of difficulty, leading to accusations of Pelagianism. He also worked to move Thomas Cranmer to a more Zwinglian position theologically, and to mitigate the influence of Martin Bucer&#151;a man for whom Hooper had only the most grudging respect.<br>
<br>Untouched by the fall of the duke of Somerset in October 1549, Hooper still enjoyed favour at court where his sermons before the king during Lent 1550 moved Edward to offer him the see of Gloucester. The programme of reform that he outlined in his Lenten sermons on the book of <span class="roman">Jonah</span> was clear on two points: the oath bishops were required to take and ecclesiastical vestments. Hooper found both impious and papistical and declined the king's offer. While references to the saints in the oath were expunged by the king in person, the issue of vestments proved more difficult, and underlined the extent to which Hooper's aggressive stands on matters of principle and his desire to see all reforms instituted immediately could make him a difficult ally. Generating considerably more heat than light, the dispute&#151;a considerable embarrassment to the church establishment&#151;involved most of the leading divines of the day. A caustic debate between Hooper and Ridley saw Ridley emerge as the clear winner and the support that Hooper had counted on from Bullinger, Pietro Martire Vermigli, and Bucer evaporated; only John &agrave; Lasco stood by him. Cranmer and Ridley successfully managed to shift the focus of the debate away from the vestments themselves and on to the question of authority and good order. Against the background of the risings of 1549, this argument proved decisive. When Hooper obstinately refused to shift he was imprisoned early in 1551, first at Lambeth Palace and then in the Fleet. However Bullinger, like most of the other divines, did not see the vestments issue as worth the division it was causing. His intervention finally induced Hooper to relent and he was consecrated bishop on 8 March 1551, in vestments (though whether these ever saw the light of day again is doubtful).<h2>
<a name="BishopofGloucesterandWorcester"></a>Bishop of Gloucester and Worcester</h2>Hooper arrived in his diocese soon after Easter 1551. Hardly on the cutting edge of the Reformation, the diocese had a limited protestant presence although part of it had been under Hugh Latimer's direction from 1535 to 1539. A relatively new diocese (founded in 1541), it had been administered without much vigour by Bishop John Wakeman, and the clergy, when not openly hostile, did no more than acquiesce in the changes brought about under Edward VI. Hooper brought with him fifty articles of religion, thirty-one injunctions, twenty-seven interrogatories to be asked of the clergy, and sixty-one interrogatories to be asked of the laity. These articles and interrogatories served as the foundation for Hooper's programme of reform within the diocese and went beyond anything seen before, anywhere in England. They have much in common with the forty-two articles, promulgated in 1552, which Hooper had a hand in formulating.<br>
<br>Hooper also drew up a further nine questions to put to the diocesan clergy. The findings of this examination have been interpreted in the past as justifying a reformer's criticism of an ignorant clerical body, but this overstates the case. Few incumbents were disciplined or removed following this examination, but Hooper did institute a programme of clerical education and also took steps to improve communications between the parish clergy and their bishop. Sensibly recognizing that it would be impossible to create a church in Gloucester along the lines he had known in Z&uuml;rich, Hooper's injunctions concentrated on creating an environment in his parishes that would encourage piety, church attendance, and good order. His advanced reforming ideas are clear in his articles but he was judicious about enforcing them. He was undoubtedly responsible for the destruction of altars, images, and other components of traditional worship, but he was not an indiscriminate purifier and expressed detestation for those who enriched themselves by despoiling churches.<br>
<br>Hooper's moderation and personal attention to his diocese made him popular and respected there, if not loved. He was no respecter of status and applied his principles to all classes equally. A violent altercation with Sir Anthony Kingston of Painswick, who refused to attend a hearing in the bishop's court after being accused of adultery, came to blows but Hooper was not intimidated: Kingston later claimed that Hooper had changed his life.<br>
<br>In April 1552, after the deprivation of Nicholas Heath, bishop of Worcester, the diocese of Gloucester was dissolved and created as an archdeaconry within the diocese of Worcester to which Hooper was translated. The change meant a net loss for Hooper as he had to surrender much of the income of Gloucester to the government. By December 1552, Gloucester and Worcester were united as one diocese, &#145;like that of Coventry and Lichfield or that of Bath and Wells&#146;  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1550&#150;53</i>, 231). Hooper was to spend half the year in each diocese and to provide for preaching and services in the church from which he was separated.<br>
<br>Hooper attempted to institute the same reforms in Worcester as in Gloucester and undertook a similar visitation. Although he met stiff resistance in Worcester, his efforts in his two dioceses were herculean. He made two circuits of each between 1551 and 1553 in addition to fulfilling his responsibilities in parliament and acting as a member of commissions to review ecclesiastical laws and to survey and inventory parish goods in the city of Gloucester. He seems also to have been involved in preparing the 1552 prayer book and in the planned revision of the canon law.<h2>
<a name="Protestantmartyr"></a>Protestant martyr</h2>Following the death of Edward VI on 6 July 1553, Hooper opposed Northumberland's attempt to put Jane Grey on the throne and supported Mary Tudor both in writing and materially, sending Sir John Talbot and William Ligon with a troop of horse to her aid. Nevertheless, by August Hooper had been summoned before the privy council and by 1 September he was imprisoned in the Fleet. As the law had not as yet been changed to allow his arrest for heresy, he was imprisoned on the charge of owing the crown &pound;509 5<i>s</i>. 5<i>d</i>. in unpaid first fruits. Hooper denied this and claimed that he was himself owed more than &pound;80 by the government. The truth of the claims and counter-claims in this dispute was irrelevant and everyone knew it: Hooper was in custody because of his radical protestant views. Although he had ample time to escape, he chose to remain in England and face certain imprisonment and possible death. His wife and children, however, escaped to Frankfurt where they remained until their deaths.<br>
<br>Hooper remained in custody until his death. His imprisonment was harsh and he suffered a variety of physical ailments, notably sciatica. He was able to communicate with the outside world with surprising ease and encouraged the formation of protestant cells in London; notable among these was a congregation that met in Bow churchyard. In all some thirty letters survive from the period of his imprisonment and he probably wrote considerably more that were intercepted, lost, or otherwise destroyed.<br>
<br>On 15 March 1554 Hooper was deprived of his bishopric. A concerted effort was made to discredit him by circulating rumours that he had recanted, but the effort failed. On 22 January 1555 he was arraigned at St Saviour's Church; examined on the 28th, he proved obstinate. Next day the sentence of the court was read by Stephen Gardiner, and along with John Rogers Hooper was taken to Newgate to await execution. On 4 February he was degraded by Bonner and left for Gloucester early the next morning. He was burnt at the stake at 9 o'clock in the morning on 9 February 1555, his sufferings protracted by faggots of green wood which long failed to catch fire.<br>
<br>A copious writer, Hooper's books and letters were collected into two volumes by the Parker Society (1843, 1845). Additional correspondence was published in <span class="italic">Original Letters Relative to the English Reformation</span> (1846&#150;7). All attest the radical and uncompromising personality which made him as much an enigma to his contemporaries as he remains today.<br>
