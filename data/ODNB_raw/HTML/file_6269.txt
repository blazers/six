<span class="headword">Copley, Sir  Godfrey</span>, second baronet  (<em>c.</em>1653&#150;1709), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the eldest son of Sir Godfrey Copley, first baronet (1623&#150;1678), of Sprotborough, Yorkshire, and his first wife, Eleanor (<i>d</i>. 1659), daughter of Sir Thomas Walmesley of Dunkenhalgh, Lancashire. Although nothing is known of Copley's early education, he was admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1674 and to the Inner Temple in 1681. In 1678 he succeeded his father as the second baronet. Thereafter his place of residence alternated between Sprotborough and his London residence at Red Lion Square. He was married twice, first, on 14 October 1681, to Catherine Purcell (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1657), daughter and coheir of John Purcell of Nantriba, Montgomeryshire&#151;they had three sons and daughters, though only a daughter survived him&#151;and second, in 1700, to Gertrude Carew (<i>bap</i>. 1682, <i>d</i>. 1736), daughter of Sir John Carew of Antony, Cornwall. The second marriage remained childless.<br>
<br>Copley was an active member of the Royal Society, of which he became a fellow in 1691, and served on the society's council on several occasions. His interest in science and antiquities was accommodated by healthy financial circumstances. He also regularly attended the London taverns that served as meeting-places for politicians. These two interests provided him with a wide circle of acquaintances that included many leading politicians as well as men of letters such as Dr Hans Sloane and Ralph Thoresby.<br>
<br>Politically, Copley was a country tory back-bencher, who on occasion expressed his independence in relation to party politics. His early parliamentary career was uneventful, though after his election for Aldborough, Yorkshire, in 1679 a rumour was spread that he was a Roman Catholic, owing to his connection through his maternal grandfather with Catholic interests in Lancashire. Having represented Aldborough until 1681, Copley did not return to parliament until 1695, when he was elected for Thirsk, another Yorkshire constituency, which he represented for the remainder of his life. From 1695 onwards he was a very active MP, taking a particular interest in financial affairs. His legal training was also evident in his parliamentary activity, especially in the debates surrounding the attainder of the Jacobite conspirator Sir John Fenwick in 1696. Copley spoke on several occasions, warning of the consequences of dispensing with the legal requirement of evidence from two witnesses, emphasizing the danger of setting precedents in the method of the attainder, and pointing out that parliament could not ignore &#145;the eternal rules&#146; of equity, justice, reason, and conscience  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 1116). In keeping with these sentiments, Copley attended Fenwick to the scaffold. Copley also spoke in several debates relating to the Anglican church, of which he was a member, and which he believed was in less danger than was believed by many of his contemporaries.<br>
<br>In 1701 Copley was elected as one of the commissioners to be named in the bill of accounts. This new parliamentary commission was included in the bill on the instigation of tory back-benchers, including Copley, who hoped to prove the charges that millions of pounds, granted for the war with France, remained unaccounted for. In the following year he was again elected to the commission, which he proceeded to serve on until 1704. During Copley's time as a commissioner Ralph Thoresby visited him at Sprotborough and noted that although Copley received him kindly he had to return to London in a few days, owing to the commission's heavy workload. However, Copley did find time to show Thoresby his new canal, his house, his many paintings by great masters, and certain mathematical instruments of which Copley had a good understanding. In 1704 Copley precluded himself from any further service on the commission by accepting the office of comptroller of army accounts, which he held until his death. After 1704 he was less active in parliament, probably due to his closer association with the government, although he continued to adhere to his country principles on occasion.<br>
<br>Copley died at Red Lion Square, London, on 9 April 1709 of a &#145;quinsy&#146;, or inflammation of the throat, which was considered to be a rare ailment, and was buried at Sprotborough on 23 April. In his will of 14 October 1704 he made substantial financial provision for his second wife and his daughter, Catherine, as well as leaving &pound;100 to the Royal Society for the benefit of scientific knowledge. Although the first financial award was not made until 1731, in 1736 the society decided to use the bequest to fund an annual gold medal award, named after Copley. In time the Copley medal became regarded as the highest scientific distinction bestowed by the society, and is still awarded to this day. Copley's estates were put in trust for his cousin, Lionel Copley, though they were eventually inherited by Copley's grandson Joseph Moyle, the son of Catherine, who took his grandfather's surname by act of parliament.<br>
