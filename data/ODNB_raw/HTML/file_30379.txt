<span class="headword">Alington,  Cyril Argentine</span>  (1872&#150;1955), <span class="occ">headmaster and dean of Durham</span>, was born in Ipswich, Suffolk, on 22 October 1872, the second son of the Revd Henry Giles Alington (1837&#150;1928), an inspector of schools, and his wife, Jane Margaret Booth (<i>d</i>. 1910). In 1886 he went with classical scholarships to Marlborough College, where he was in the cricket eleven, and in 1891 he proceeded to Trinity College, Oxford. A first class in honour moderations (1893) and in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1895) was followed by his election at the second attempt to a fellowship at All Souls College, Oxford, in November 1896. In that year he had returned, as sixth-form master, to Marlborough. He was ordained deacon in 1899 and priest in 1901, and in the former year moved to Eton College where in 1904 he became master in college with a particularly gifted set of boys in his charge. He married, on 5 April 1904, Hester Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1958), youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17307/', "George William Lyttelton, the fourth Lord Lyttelton")</script>. Of her it is impossible to find any comment but affectionate praise. She kept open house and her advice was available to all. She was devoted to Alington, as he was to her.<br>
<br>In 1908 Alington was appointed headmaster of Shrewsbury School; he was younger than all except two of his staff. The school was down to 240 boys, but by the end of 1916 the number had recovered to 394. In January 1917 he succeeded his brother-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34656/', "Edward Lyttelton")</script>, as headmaster of Eton; again he was to preside over a recovery of numbers, from just under 1000 to 1150. He retired from Eton in 1933.<br>
<br>Alington was endowed with almost every gift to ensure a successful career. Extraordinarily handsome, especially in later years when robed and in the pulpit, he impressed the great majority of boys at Shrewsbury and Eton. As a young man he was a very successful cricketer and for years afterwards he maintained a high standard as a player of fives and rackets. He possessed a wide and extraordinarily retentive memory which enabled him to produce the apt quotation for any occasion. He was a most facile and brilliant versifier and he composed some admirable hymns. He was interested in political history and wrote some historical works; probably the best is <span class="italic">Twenty Years</span> (1921), a study of the party system, 1815&#150;1835. <span class="italic">A Schoolmaster's Apology</span> (1914) gives his views on education and religion at one of the most active stages of his career; he claims that he spent a week on it. Sermons and verses were published. He also wrote a number of detective stories and other novels: clever, witty, but quickly perishable. All these varied publications bear witness to the incredible speed at which his mind, his imagination, and his pen worked. He dispatched the routine business of a headmaster so rapidly that he did not require a full-time secretary either at Shrewsbury, where he employed a young cricket professional, Neville Cardus, or at Eton. He readily dominated masters' meetings, and his conversation was brilliant.<br>
<br>Alington was not a scholar in any true sense. As a teacher he was least successful with the ablest boys, who recognized his weaknesses. He would prepare lessons in classics where he knew his grasp was shaky, but he felt he could teach English and divinity off the cuff, with unfortunate results. Lack of self-criticism encouraged him to preach too often, with fables at the end of evensong as well as sermons. Yet he was at his best in the pulpit, and he could influence boys even to the end of his life. His Holy Week addresses at Eton indelibly impressed the hushed and crowded chapel; in these addresses his striking presence, his melodious voice, and his theatrical tricks were all at the service of convincing material.<br>
<br>As a headmaster Alington was not an innovator. He did not regard maths and science as educational disciplines of much value except to scientists. He was a considerable builder at Shrewsbury, though not all his projects were soundly financed. At Eton he brought about less physical change, but at both schools he cared for and improved the environment. His impact as headmaster, however, was above all personal. He knew surprisingly many boys, and took an interest in them; his own zest for life infected them. He was a firm disciplinarian (he reintroduced birching, which had been dropped by his predecessor), but severity could be tempered: boys in trouble and good boys could experience his kindness alike.<br>
<br>In 1933 Alington was appointed dean of Durham and transferred these qualities to his new job; he displayed the same affection and ready friendship towards Durham miners that he had shown to his pupils. Increasingly affected by arthritis, he retired from the deanery in 1951. The warmth with which he writes of his time at Durham makes that section the most appealing part of his very brief memoir, <span class="italic">A Dean's Apology</span> (1952).<br>
<br>Alington had two sons and four daughters. The eldest daughter died aged thirty, and the younger son was killed at Salerno, Italy, in 1943&#151;losses which were met with Christian fortitude. The elder son, Giles, also died before his mother; he was a much loved and respected senior tutor and dean of University College, Oxford. The three other daughters married Sir Alec Douglas-Home, Sir Roger Mynors, and the Revd John Wilkes, warden of Radley College, Abingdon, Berkshire, all of whom had been Etonians under his charge.<br>
<br>Alington, who had become DD at Oxford in 1917, received other honours: he was chaplain to the king from 1921 to 1933, and he was made an honorary fellow of Trinity College, Oxford, in 1926, and an honorary DCL at Durham in 1937. He died at his home, Treago, St Weonards, Herefordshire, on 16 May 1955 and was buried at Durham Cathedral.<br>
