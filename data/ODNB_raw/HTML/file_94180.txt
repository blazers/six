<span class="headword">Ehrlich,  Cyril</span>  (1925&#150;2004), <span class="occ">economic and social historian and writer on music</span>, was born on 13 September 1925 at 5 Copley Street, Mile End, London, the elder child of Henry Ehrlich, tailor, and his wife, Dinah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jacobs, also a tailor. Both parents were descended from eastern European Jews. Although they were skilled tailors the uncertain economic climate of the late 1920s and early 1930s meant that they often had to seek work outside their trade. Consequently the family finances were precarious and (since his parents moved frequently in search of work) Ehrlich had to move from school to school. While he was keen to succeed academically, his strength was sport and he won prizes for sprinting. It was during his school years that he developed his interest in music by exploring his father's record collection, and by teaching himself the piano. Recordings and the piano became lifelong passions and his knowledge of both was encyclopaedic.<br>
<br>Having joined the Royal Air Force in 1944, Ehrlich transferred to the army after being sent to India. There he was deployed to the education corps, for which he lectured on music appreciation. On demobilization in 1947 he enrolled at the London School of Economics, where he quickly came under the influence of the charismatic economic historian F. J. (Frederick Jack) Fisher. Although Ehrlich had enrolled initially to read economics the impact of Fisher's teaching was such that he decided to specialize in economic history. After accepting a post as a research assistant at the LSE in 1950 he began to consolidate his interest in the arts and could be found regularly at London's major concert and opera venues. During that period he heard most of the great musical figures of the age and was affected deeply by the work of the pianist Artur Schnabel, and the conductors Sir Thomas Beecham and Wilhelm Furtw&auml;ngler.<br>
<br>In 1952 Ehrlich moved to Uganda, where he taught at Makerere College. But music was never far away: before leaving for Africa he had acquired a good-quality gramophone system and later shipped out several uprights and a grand piano. It was in Africa that he wrote his PhD for the University of London on cotton marketing in Uganda, wrote his first book, <span class="italic">The Uganda Company</span> (1953), and began to write chapters for the second and third volumes of the <span class="italic">Oxford History of East Africa</span> (eventually published in 1965 and 1976). By placing the economics of cotton production in Uganda, and then of production and trade in east Africa more generally, within a cultural context he broke new ground. His writing style was clear and precise, and he blended sound historical practice with wit and humour. It was during his stay in Africa that he met Felicity Ruth Bell-Bonnett, whom he married in 1954. They had three children, a daughter and two sons.<br>
<br>In 1961 Ehrlich was appointed a lecturer in economic history at Queen's University, Belfast. He was a passionate and committed teacher and was promoted to reader in 1969 and professor in 1974; he served as dean of the economics faculty from 1979 to 1981. By the time of his appointment at Belfast his interest in music dominated his activities and he soon began to specialize in the history of the piano. With an insatiable appetite to learn, he quickly balanced his knowledge of piano playing with a comprehensive technical understanding of the instrument. His deep interest in the piano culminated in the publication of his much-respected and much-read book, <span class="italic">The Piano: a History</span>, in 1976. That book was followed nine years later by his study <span class="italic">The Music Profession in Britain since the Eighteenth Century</span>. After taking early retirement from Queen's University he wrote two further books: <span class="italic">Harmonious Alliance: a History of the Performing Right Society</span> (1989), and <span class="italic">First Philharmonic: a History of the Royal Philharmonic Society</span> (1995). Both were received with enthusiasm and soon became benchmarks against which all other books of their type were judged. Throughout much of his time at Queen's and after, Ehrlich also worked as a record, book, and concert critic for leading periodicals and newspapers. His reviews were always concise and balanced and were respected by performers, authors, and audiences alike.<br>
<br>Although Ehrlich retired officially in 1986 his keen interest in academic life never left him, and at his home in Oxford, known affectionately as &#145;the University of St Andrew's Lane&#146;, he continued to work with scholars and musicians of all ages. In 1995 he was appointed visiting professor at Royal Holloway, University of London, and from 1998 he was visiting professor at Goldsmiths' College, University of London. With Simon McVeigh of Goldsmiths' College and David Wright of the Royal College of Music in 1999 he established a groundbreaking seminar series examining the social history of music in Britain at the Institute of Historical Research, University of London. In 2000 he was honoured with a Festschrift, <span class="italic">Music and British Culture, 1785&#150;1914</span>, edited by Christina Bashford and Leanne Langley. His stature never diminished with age, and when the Wigmore Hall celebrated its centenary in 2001 he was invited to give a lecture about its history.<br>
<br>A man of catholic taste, Ehrlich balanced a deep understanding of the music of Haydn, Schubert, and Wagner with a love of films and novels. He would regularly engage in lively discussions with all who would care to join in about the latest cinematic release, and could shift the discussion from popular culture to high art with the ease of a natural orator. Though he lived in Oxford he could be seen regularly at operas and concerts in London throughout his last years. Ever keen to keep his finger on the artistic pulse, he balanced an admiration of the great artists of the past with a willingness to acknowledge new talent. Although he had been ill for some time, his vitality and enthusiasm for life meant that his death from heart disease at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, on 29 May 2004 came as a shock to all who knew him. He was survived by his wife, Felicity, and their three children, all of whom became professional musicians.<br>
