<span class="headword">Hobson,  William</span>  (1792&#150;1842), <span class="occ">naval officer and colonial governor</span>, was born in Waterford, Ireland, on 25 September 1792, the third of the five sons of Samuel Hobson, a barrister, and his wife, Martha Jones. In 1803 he entered the Royal Navy as a gentleman volunteer. He was first involved in North Sea action during the Napoleonic wars, in 1806 was made a midshipman while in the West Indies, and by 1814 had risen to lieutenant. From August 1816 he was unemployed for eighteen months, then had a brief posting in the Mediterranean before commencing a career of service against pirates and slavers in the West Indies. He was captured in 1821 and again in 1823, when commanding an attack on pirate strongholds on the Cuban coast. Promotion to commander in 1824 and captain in 1828 was fitting recognition of a distinguished record, but years of exhausting service and illness&#151;three bouts of yellow fever&#151;left the slightly built Hobson in indifferent health. From mid-1828 he was without a command.<br>
<br>At Nassau, in the Bahamas, on 17 December 1827, Hobson had married Eliza Ann (1811&#150;1876), the only daughter of Robert Wear Elliott, a Scottish West India merchant. The Hobsons lived at Plymouth for six years until, in December 1834, through the patronage of Lord Auckland, Hobson was appointed commander of the frigate <i>Rattlesnake</i>. Dispatched to serve in the East Indies and in Australian waters, the ship arrived at Port Jackson (Sydney) in August 1836 and helped with the foundation of Port Phillip settlement (Melbourne).<br>
<br>When Maori warfare in early 1837 led to an appeal from James Busby, British resident in New Zealand, Hobson left for the Bay of Islands, charged with drawing up a report on the country. The fighting subsided without need of mediation and Hobson made brief visits to several other locations. His report proposed limited British intervention in New Zealand&#151;a system of trading factories similar to those in India and a treaty with the Maori to confirm purchase of land and secure jurisdiction.<br>
<br>Hobson arrived in England in early 1838 and in February 1839 accepted appointment as British consul to New Zealand; a second commission as lieutenant-governor followed, with instructions provided by the Colonial Office. Prefaced by an apology for intervention, which acknowledged an 1835 declaration of the country's independence signed by northern Maori, these instructions were essentially guidelines for establishing a British colony. Land, purchased from Maori, would be sold to settlers at a profit to fund government business.<br>
<br>At Port Jackson Hobson conferred with his immediate superior, Governor George Gipps of New South Wales, and selected his staff. He arrived at the Bay of Islands in the <i>Herald</i> on 29 January 1840. The following day he read the queen's commission appointing him lieutenant-governor, cautiously adding that it was over the British settlements &#145;in progress&#146;.<br>
<br>With Busby's assistance a treaty was drafted and translated by Henry Williams, a member of the Church Missionary Society. Local Maori leaders met on 5 February 1840 at Busby's Waitangi residence, where Williams interpreted. Hobson wanted a cession of sovereignty but, aware that Maori suspected British motives, he presented the treaty as a limited intrusion on Maori rights; the treaty was needed so that he could better control unruly settlers and protect the Maori. Long-term implications were not raised. Heated debate followed, but the next day Hobson received assent from more than forty chiefs, twenty-six of whom had signed the 1835 declaration of independence. However, shortcomings of translation and lack of explanation left Maori leaders with inadequate understanding of the agreement.<br>
<br>Anxious to press forward treaty negotiations elsewhere, Hobson sailed for Waitemata harbour, but on 1 March 1840 a stroke left him partially paralysed. Willoughby Shortland, colonial secretary, began to organize the collection of treaty signatures by sending copies of the treaty to various parts of the country. Hobson, soon resuming most duties, expanded these missions by deploying Major Thomas Bunbury, who arrived in April with the Hobson family and a detachment of troops.<br>
<br>While treaty copies were circulating, Hobson became concerned about asserting British authority. Faced with an independent stance adopted by New Zealand Company settlers at Port Nicholson (Wellington), he proclaimed British sovereignty over the whole country on 21 May. Two months later, faced with a French attempt to found a settlement in the South Island, he responded with a show of occupation. Meanwhile he decided to relocate his government, and founded a new capital at Auckland on Waitemata harbour. Officials moved there in February 1841, and on 3 May Hobson took the oath as governor; by royal charter New Zealand became a crown colony. Now he was able to deal directly with the home government, rather than dealing via New South Wales as had been the case when he was lieutenant-governor, Hobson nevertheless had to rely on his own judgement: his staff, boosted by local recruits, lacked ability, and responses to dispatches took nine months to reach him.<br>
<br>Aware that his administration was closely scrutinized by a Maori population that vastly outnumbered settlers, Hobson depended on missionary support to influence Maori leaders. In April 1840 he appointed the missionary George Clarke as protector of aborigines, but, since Clarke was required to be government land purchaser as well as protector, this was less than reassuring to the Maori. When revenue failed to meet official expenditure, Hobson handled the crisis poorly. Sensitive to opposition, he was overly irritated when settler unrest over land and other policies was fomented by journalists. He had been unwell since his first stroke, and he suffered another stroke and died, at Government House, Auckland, on 10 September 1842. He was given a military funeral on 13 September and interred in a vault in Grafton cemetery, Auckland. Eliza Hobson, with their four daughters and a son, returned to live at Stoke, Devon; she died in 1876.<br>
<br>Hobson had enjoyed a warm family circle and was an entertaining host and speaker. A member of the Church of England, he was tolerant of other denominations. For his public office he was not well prepared, however. By training and disposition he was accustomed to exercising authority and commanding respect. The skills needed to control a constantly changing frontier situation within the parameters of unrealistic Colonial Office expectations were altogether different. The effort required of a new colonial governor strained his weakened constitution and hastened Hobson's end.<br>
