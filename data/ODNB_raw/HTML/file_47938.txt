<span class="headword">Fyfe,  John</span>  (1830&#150;1906), <span class="occ">granite quarry master</span>, was born at Goodhope, Bucksburn, Aberdeenshire, the eldest son of James Fyfe (<i>d</i>. 1846), quarry master, and his wife, Elizabeth Strachan. The region had for over two centuries been associated with the extraction of granite, and quarrying reached its peak in the latter half of the nineteenth century, when John Fyfe was the dominant figure. Fyfe was educated at the local school until he was sixteen, when he had to take over the family business following the death of his father. He continued operations at Newhills until 1857 when he moved to Kemnay and opened two adjacent workings on Paradise Hill, on land belonging to John Burnett. It had long been known that good surface deposits of granite abounded in the Kemnay area, but until the advent of the Great North of Scotland Railway into the Alford valley, the cost of extracting this stone and then transporting it by cart or even canal to Aberdeen made it uneconomic to quarry so far from an immediate market. Fyfe quickly secured an agreement with the railway company for transporting stone to Aberdeen, and, as the railway extended its network further into the Alford valley, he subsequently opened workings at Tom's Forest, Tillyfourie, and Corrennie on the outlying hills of the Grampians.<br>
<br>Fyfe's quarrying empire grew quickly and, while continuing to exert a high level of managerial control over his business, he was nevertheless forced to delegate the daily operations of his workings to foremen and quarry managers, the latter being recruited from the former. Fyfe's primary contribution to quarrying lay in developing the technology involved. Efficiency in granite quarrying depends very much on the speed at which stone can be blasted from the master joints, broken down, and then lifted to the quarry surface. Delays at any of these stages could (and still does) hinder a working's productivity. Fyfe's innovations had a positive impact on all these processes. Until the 1860s it was normal to drill blast-holes using hand drills&#151;a long, slow, physically laborious process; rock penetration would typically average 4 feet a day. Fyfe replaced hand drilling with steam-power drilling both for boring the blast-holes and for breaking up large blocks of stone. Once broken, the granite was raised to the quarry loading banks with steam-powered cranes but, because of their fixed jibs, their range and lifting power were limited. This problem was partially overcome by Fyfe through the introduction of the Scotch steam derrick with its movable jib, but the need for greater speed still remained. It was said that after watching a display of tight-rope walking by the most famous of all tight-rope walkers, Charles Blondin (1824&#150;1897), in 1872, Fyfe invented the &#145;Blondin&#146;, a suspension cableway with a travelling carriage that could be lowered to any part of the quarry from a fixed position. This new machine quickly proved its worth as the quarries became deeper, as it reduced the time taken to raise stone from the quarry floors from as much as an hour to a matter of minutes.<br>
<br>An equally important contribution to the growth of his operations was Fyfe's ability to attract and retain his labourers. Besides recruiting workers from the local agricultural labour force, he enticed skilled men from Aberdeen by offering them high wages and cheap building stone to enable them to build their own houses in Kemnay village. At the more distant Corrennie quarries he built blocks of tenement flats, known as barracks. As an employer he was generally regarded as being firm but approachable. By the end of the century, Fyfe ran the largest single firm in the industry, employing almost 600 men, and producing almost 100,000 tons of stone per annum. Fyfe was also extremely active within the industry as a whole, serving on the committees of both the Aberdeen Granite Quarrymasters' Association and the Aberdeen Granite Manufacturers' Association. He became a director of the Aberdeen Lime Company and the local branch of the London and Lancashire Insurance Company, and was a partner in another nineteen firms in the north-east.<br>
<br>Fyfe was married to Barbara Stevenson, daughter of the grocer in Dalmadilly, Aberdeenshire; they had two sons and eight daughters. In his public life he served as a magistrate, and was a member of Aberdeen University's building committee as well as being a significant figure in the city's business life. An &#145;In memoriam&#146; in the <span class="italic">Aberdeen Free Press</span> said after Fyfe's death:<blockquote>Aberdeen itself owes Mr Fyfe a lasting debt of gratitude, not only for the distinct lead he has consistently given in fostering the artistic development of architecture in granite work, but for his public-spirited generosity in making it possible on more than one occasion to retain inviolate the most striking aspect of Aberdeen as the Granite City. (<span class="italic">John Fyfe</span>, not paginated)</blockquote>Fyfe died of heart failure and Bright's disease at his home, Beechgrove House, King's Gate, Aberdeen, on 18 July 1906; his wife had predeceased him. His business was continued by his two sons.<br>
