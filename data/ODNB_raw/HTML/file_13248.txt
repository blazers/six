<span class="headword">Highmore,  Nathaniel</span>  (1613&#150;1685), <span class="occ">chemical physician and anatomist</span>, was born on 6 February 1613 at Fordingbridge, Hampshire, the elder son of Nathaniel Highmore, rector of Purse Caundle, a village near Sherborne in Dorset. Educated at Sherborne School and Trinity College, Oxford, Highmore graduated BA (1635) and MA (1638) with the aid of a scholarship at Trinity, which he then relinquished in favour of his younger brother, Richard. On 30 December 1640 he married Elizabeth, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12746/', "Richard Haydock")</script>, a prominent physician of Salisbury, with whom he probably worked as an assistant. Highmore returned to Oxford, where he was granted his BM in July 1641. Though he intended to proceed formally with medical studies for his doctorate, with the onset of civil war in 1642 Highmore became part of a scientific circle at Trinity College, Oxford, led by William Harvey, then physician to Charles I, and George Bathurst. In 1643 Highmore received his DM at Oxford under the so-called &#145;Caroline creations&#146; of royal command for those who had favourably served the king at the battle of Edge Hill and its aftermath. While Highmore could indeed be described as a moderate royalist, he may have acquired the DM for attending to Prince Charles during a spell of measles in November 1642, though this remains uncertain.<br>
<br>The Trinity experiments on the embryonic development of chicks drew in Highmore, whose friendship and collaboration with Harvey was underlined in the dedication to him, written in 1650, of his <span class="italic">Corporis humani disquisitio anatomica</span> (1651), in which Highmore wrote: &#145;It is now eight years since we first had it in mind to expose our careful studies &hellip; to the judgement of the public&#146;  (A1<i>r</i>&#150; <i>v</i>). The broad purpose of the textbook was to redesign physiology and anatomy in the direction of Harvey's theory of the circulation of the blood. The frontispiece incorporating an allegorical drawing of the new theory emphasized this. Agreeing with Harvey that the heart's sustaining relationship to the body was analogous to the sun in the wider macrocosm, Highmore explicitly defined the origin and function of circulation beyond Harvey's more circumspect treatment. Whereas Harvey, in his <span class="italic">Exercitationes de generatione animalium</span> (1651), focused on the unitary and vital nature of blood, Highmore advanced a particulate view of the blood that saw its carrying heat and nutrition and whose nature entailed constant motion. A similar shift is evident in Highmore's analysis of the pulmonary transit. Using Harvey's arguments to establish pulmonary circulation he considered the possible functions of the pulmonary vein to challenge the beliefs of those like Galen and Fernel who thought it sent air to the heart. Highmore believed that experiment showed that the pulmonary vessels contained blood and he used the techniques of Vesalius and Harvey to disprove the generation of vital spirits from the air. In describing blood as an oily substance Highmore was accepting that chemical distillation provided a surer analysis of its composition. Corpuscular philosophy also informed his understanding of respiratory functions. Believing that heat was innate in the heart and thus conveyed to the blood, respiration expelled excess heat particles residing in the blood. Moreover, the motion of the lungs helped the passage of blood from the right to the left ventricle, as experiment again proved.<br>
<br>In Highmore's <span class="italic">History of Generation</span> of 1651 corpuscularianism was extended to embrace atomism and it is noteworthy that the work contains the first published dedication to Robert Boyle, who was to become arguably the leading corpuscularian of his generation. Highmore had set up a practice in 1645 in Sherborne, just a short distance from Stalbridge where the young Boyle had recently returned from the continent to live on an estate purchased by his late father, the earl of Cork. A shared anatomical and medical outlook no doubt prompted Highmore to point to Boyle as &#145;both a pattern and wonder to our Nobility and Gentry&#146;  (N. Highmore, <span class="italic">History of Generation</span>, 1651, 3). Unlike Boyle, who was particularly reticent in using the term &#145;atomism&#146; in this period because of its atheistic association with Epicurean thought, Highmore took it as &#145;an unquestionable law of Nature, (if, prejudice laid aside, right reason takes her place) that all actions and motions are performed by Atomes, or small bodies, moving after a different manner, proportionable to their several figures&#146;  (ibid., 115). Bearing a strong resemblance to the atomism of Gassendi, which in turn powerfully influenced Boyle, Highmore's general analysis of atoms is embedded within a broader discussion critical of supposed cure of wounds by sympathetic action at a distance, which instead points to atomic effluvia as sufficient explanation. Refuting the embryological theories of Harvey's friend Kenelm Digby, Highmore uses atoms and the circulation of the blood to explain the nature of nutrition and genetic continuity.<br>
<br>In any rounded assessment of Highmore's work it should be remembered that there are clear limits to Highmore's modernism. A great deal of Highmore's physiology in his <span class="italic">Disquisitio</span>, for example, understandably reflects ancient and medieval theory and practice, as it did with many of his corpuscularian contemporaries. Attempting to account for the assemblage of the dissociated atoms of the conceptus and the orderly development of the embryo in his <span class="italic">De generatione</span> led Highmore to argue for the pre-existence of embryonic parts, an idea as ancient as the atomistic concept of matter upon which his analysis was based. Highmore's &#145;seminal atoms&#146; are transmuted into &#145;substantial formes&#146;, some of which are endowed by a directing force with an activating and vivifying principle. Also instructive is Highmore's criticism of Thomas Willis's views on hysteria and hypochondria, <span class="italic">Exercitationes duae &hellip; de passione hysterica &hellip; de affectionae hypochondriaca</span> (1660), which explained hysteria as the consequence of a disturbed pulmonary circulation. On this occasion Willis's response in <span class="italic">Pathologiae cerebri</span> (1677), that the nervous system was the arena of explanation, effectively refuted Highmore's attack.<br>
<br>Highmore became a JP and county treasurer in Dorset. He had a practice in Sherborne for forty years, where he was actively involved in church affairs and served for a lengthy period as a governor of Sherborne School and the town's almshouse. He died there on 21 March 1685, and was buried on the south side of the chancel of Purse Caundle church. His wife survived him. In his will Highmore endowed an exhibition to Oxford from Sherborne School, and left his tables of the muscles to the physic school at Oxford.<br>
