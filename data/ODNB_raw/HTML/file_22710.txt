<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pratt,  Samuel Jackson</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Courtney Melmoth]</span>  (1749&#150;1814), <span class="occ">writer and actor</span>, was born at St Ives, Huntingdonshire, on 25 December 1749. He was the son of a brewer in that town who twice served as high sheriff of his county, and apparently died in 1773. His mother was a niece of Sir Thomas Drury. He was educated in part at Felsted School in Essex, is said to have been for some time under the private tuition of Hawkesworth, and was ordained in the English church. His poem entitled &#145;Partridges, an Elegy&#146;, often included in popular collections of poetry, was printed in the <span class="italic">Annual Register</span> for 1771 (p. 241) as by the &#145;Rev. Mr. Pratt of Peterborough&#146; and he is described as &#145;an esteemed and popular preacher&#146;  (Britton and Brayley, 485).<br>
<br>About 1772 Pratt eloped with a &#145;pretty boarding school miss, whose Christian name was Charlotte (<i>b</i>. 1749, <i>d</i>. 1805 or 1823) and whose family name perhaps was Melmoth, the pseudonym Pratt was to adopt for his stage ventures and under which she also acted&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>, 10.181). His parents disapproved of the alliance, and the family property was much impaired by constant dissensions and litigation. Pratt soon abandoned his clerical profession, and in 1773 appeared, under the name of Courtney Melmoth, on the boards of the theatre in Smock Alley, Dublin, taking the part of Marc Antony in <span class="italic">All for Love</span>. He &#145;cut a tall and genteel figure but lacked conviction in his acting&#146; and his success was not great  (ibid.). At the end of the season he took a company to Drogheda, but after three months' lack of success the theatre was closed. In 1774 and 1775 he assumed at Covent Garden Theatre the parts of Philaster and Hamlet, again without success, and he also appeared as a reciter. Courtney and Charlotte Melmoth often appeared as a duo: in November 1774 as Leontes and Hermione of <span class="italic">The Winter's Tale</span>, and in March 1776 as Jaffeir and Belvidera in <span class="italic">Venice Preserv'd</span>, at the Theatre Royal, Edinburgh. They performed also in Bath (1778&#150;9), again in Edinburgh (1779), and probably again in Dublin, &#145;where Mrs. Melmoth was engaged regularly from 1780&#150;81 and 1788&#150;9&#146;  (ibid., 10.182). Courtney Melmoth's failure as an actor was perhaps due, says Taylor, to his walk, &#145;a kind of airy swing that rendered his acting at times rather ludicrous&#146; (Taylor, 1.45&#150;6; Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>, 10.182). Subsequently he and Mrs Melmoth travelled about the country telling fortunes, and they resorted to various other expedients to gain a livelihood. Some time after 1781, the couple, &#145;who no doubt had never been married by ceremony, separated&#146;, she emigrating to the United States in 1793, and he travelling to the continent &#145;to glean ideas for future literary efforts&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>, 10.182). They retained, however, feelings of &#145;cordial and confidential amity&#146;  (L'Estrange, 1.33&#150;5).<br>
<br>From 1774, when he published verses deploring the death of Goldsmith, Pratt depended largely on his pen for support. At first he generally wrote under his stage name. About 1776 he was at Bath, in partnership with a bookseller called Clinch, in the old established library, subsequently known as Godwin's library, at the north-west corner of Milsom Street. On Clinch's death Pratt's name remained as a nominal partner in the business under the style of Pratt and Marshall, but after a few years he left Bath for London.<br>
<br>Pratt's voluminous works, well catalogued in the <span class="italic">New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature</span>, assume many forms. Some works are tributes, such as <span class="italic">The Tears of Genius, on the Death of Dr Goldsmith</span> (1774); &#145;Garrick's Looking-Glass&#146; (1776); <span class="italic">An Apology for the Life and Writings of Hume</span> (1777); and <span class="italic">The Shadowe of Shakespeare</span> (1780?). His plays include <span class="italic">Joseph Andrews</span> (1778), a two-act farce; <span class="italic">The Fair Circassians</span> (1781); and <span class="italic">The School for Vanity</span> (1783). One novel, entitled <span class="italic">Emma Corbett, or, The Miseries of Civil War</span>, appeared anonymously in 1780, was translated into French in 1783, and ran into many editions. Among his efforts at landscape poetry are <span class="italic">Landscapes in Verse, Taken in Spring</span> (1785), <span class="italic">Gleanings through Wales, Holland, and Westphalia</span> (1795&#150;9); and <span class="italic">Gleanings in England</span> (1801).<br>
<br>One remarkable division of Pratt's diverse publications is that reflecting his humanitarian interests. Although Pratt was personally insupportable to many of his acquaintances, in print his persona could be gentle and caring. This streak in an already multi-faceted personality probably originated with <span class="italic">Liberal Opinions on Animals, Man, and Providence</span>, otherwise known as <span class="italic">Liberal Opinions, or, The History of Benignus</span> (6 vols., 1775&#150;7), which traced the adventures of Benignus, considered by many to be an autobiographical character. <span class="italic">Sympathy, a Poem</span> (1788) was many times corrected and enlarged, and was marked by &#145;feeling, energy, and beauty&#146;  (Polwhele, 1.132). Also included in this group are: <span class="italic">The Triumph of Benevolence</span> (1786); <span class="italic">Humanity, or, The Rights of Nature</span> (1788); <span class="italic">Bread, or, The Poor</span> (1801); and <span class="italic">The Lower World</span> (1810).<br>
<br>Pratt's contemporaries varied in their esteem for the man and his works. When his plays were produced at Drury Lane, he became intimately acquainted with Potter, the translator of Aeschylus, George Colman the elder, James Beattie, and John Wolcot. His popular poem, &#145;Sympathy&#146;, was first handed to Thomas Cadell, the publisher, by Gibbon. Pratt travelled at home and abroad; in 1802 he was at Birmingham, making detailed enquiry into its manufactures and the lives of its artisans. Pratt possessed considerable talents, but his necessities left him little time for reflection or revision. Some severe lines on his poetry and prose were in the original manuscript of Byron's <span class="italic">English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</span>, but they were omitted from publication.<br>
<br>One twentieth-century commentator states that &#145;to know [Pratt], it seems, was most often to despise him, a fact to which Byron's letters &hellip; attest&#146; and reveals that the actress Sarah Siddons and the poet Anna Seward loathed him, accusing him of abandoning a wife and child in Dublin in 1773  (London, 357). Byron made sarcastic allusions to Pratt's posthumous patronage of the poet Joseph Blacket in a letter to Mr Dallas of 21 August 1811  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 2.53&#150;4). Charles Lamb condemned Pratt's <span class="italic">Gleanings</span> as &#145;a wretched assortment of vapid feelings&#146; and wrote sarcastically of the credibility of Pratt's benevolent involvement in the Humane Society in a letter to Southey of 28 November 1798  (<span class="italic">Letters of Charles and Mary Lamb</span>, 1.151). To readers with less privileged information than Byron or Lamb, however, Pratt &#145;maintained a public reputation of a genial, kindly, and even sentimental presence&#146;  (London, 357). Robert Taylor thought well of him, opining that, &#145;if Pratt had been born to a fortune, a great part of it would have been devoted to benevolence&#146;, but even so, inevitably, Pratt &#145;injured his relationships by displays of rancour and viciousness, especially in his correspondence&#146; which was too often earmarked by impetuous begging-letters  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>, 10.184). The public and the private Pratts, it would seem, were two different Pratts altogether.<br>
<br>After a long, diverse, and prolific career in the arts, Pratt became ill after a fall from his horse in Birmingham in 1814. After a long decline, he died there at an address on Colmore Row, on 4 October 1814.<br>
<br>There is much more room for speculation about the death date of Charlotte Melmoth, as Highfill traces her career until her death in 1823, and states that the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> is simply incorrect in setting her death in 1805. This earlier date had been chosen because a letter from Pratt to Mr Mitford refers to the death of Mrs Pratt, whom Pratt had not seen for some twenty years, as occurring in 1805. Moreover, Pratt's will of 1806 uses the phrase &#145;my late wife, Mrs. Pratt&#146;. One could surmise that there were two Mrs Pratts, or that Pratt used the phrase to keep her out of his estate, but no definite conclusions can be drawn.<br>
