<span class="headword">Wightman,  Joseph</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1722), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was appointed ensign in the 1st foot guards on 29 December 1690. He progressed to lieutenant and captain on 7 August 1693, and to captain and lieutenant-colonel on 8 December 1696. He subsequently transferred to Sir Matthew Bridge's regiment and saw service in Flanders during the Nine Years' War (1689&#150;97). In 1701 Wightman went with the regiment to the Netherlands prior to the onset of the War of the Spanish Succession (1702&#150;13). He saw extensive active service during the duke of Marlborough's initial campaigns, and was promoted to lieutenant-colonel and took command of the regiment in 1702. On the recommendation of Marlborough, Wightman received the brevet rank of colonel on 26 August 1703, with the intention that he should command the contingent of troops earmarked for service in Spain. At this time Marlborough described Wightman as &#145;a very careful, diligent officer&#146;  (Murray, 1.192). In Spain, Wightman served with his regiment (now Holcroft Blood's) in the army of Henri de Massue de Ruvigny, earl of Galway; he was made brigadier-general on 1 January 1707, and fought at the battle of Almanza (25 April 1707). On Blood's death Wightman was appointed, on 20 August 1707, to the colonelcy of the regiment (subsequently the 17th foot, or Leicesters), and on 1 January 1710 he became major-general.<br>
<br>On 12 June 1712 Wightman was appointed the commander-in-chief in Scotland, as the deputy for John Campbell, second duke of Argyll. The appointment came on the recommendation of General John Webb, despite Argyll's preference for Brigadier-General William Breton in the post. Wightman's position was, accordingly, rather awkward and Argyll's attitude toward his lieutenant seems to have been most unco-operative, with official correspondence to Argyll delayed or ignored altogether. Despite this, Wightman made extensive efforts to bolster the government's position in Scotland, at a time of rising sympathy for the Jacobite cause. At the outset of the 1715 rising Wightman shrewdly drew together his meagre forces and secured Stirling town and castle. Argyll joined him there from London in mid-September. Wightman commanded the infantry in the centre of the army at the battle of Sheriffmuir (13 November 1715) and, although the troops on his left broke, his solid defence held the highlanders' rush. This local success enabled Argyll to employ his cavalry on the right wing to disperse much of the Jacobite army. Rather inevitably there was some dispute between Wightman and Argyll over the meagre honours of the day. Wightman's own account, printed in 1717 as a part of Robert Patten's <span class="italic">History of the Late Rebellion</span>, was subsequently criticised by admirers of Argyll for being unduly partial.<br>
<br>Wightman continued to serve in Scotland, and he commanded the government army at the small battle of Glenshiel during the Jacobite rising of 1719. His capable tactics, using mortars to unsettle the entrenched highlanders and then sending Campbell's dragoons (subsequently the Royal Scots Greys) to turn the flank of their position, were admirably successful. The rebels dispersed and the accompanying Spanish soldiers surrendered shortly afterwards.<br>
<br>In recognition of his services in Scotland, Wightman was appointed governor of Kinsale in Ireland. Before taking up the post he died of a stroke when in Bath, on 25 September 1722. Probate, granted on 7 November 1722, suggests that he was usually resident in the parish of St James's, Westminster; administration was granted to his widow, Eliza.<br>
