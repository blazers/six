<span class="headword">Johnston,  George  Lawson</span>, first Baron Luke  (1873&#150;1943), <span class="occ">food manufacturer and philanthropist</span>, was born on 9 September 1873 at 2 Blacket Place, Newington, Edinburgh, the second son of the thirteen children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48722/', "John Lawson Johnston (1839&#150;1900)")</script>, nutrition promoter and food manufacturer, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of George Lawson, baker and confectioner of Newington, Edinburgh. Both parents were Scottish.<br>
<br>Lawson Johnston was initially educated privately in Canada, where his father had significant business interests. He subsequently attended Dulwich College for one academic year, and then Blair Lodge in Scotland, after his parents had returned to live in Britain. He worked for Bovril, his father's company, even before leaving full-time education, and was a cashier at the Paris International Exhibition of 1889. On joining the firm, he was trained on the job and travelled extensively in South America, the main source of raw materials. In 1896 Bovril was floated as a public company by Ernest Terah Hooley (1859&#150;1947), and Lawson Johnston joined the board. Following the death of his father in 1900 he became vice-chairman. He succeeded to the chairmanship in 1916, and in 1932 became joint managing director, both of which positions he held until his death. On 4 December 1902 he married the Hon. Edith Laura St John (1879&#150;1941), fifth daughter of Beauchamp Moubray St John, seventeenth Baron St John of Bletso. They had four daughters and two sons, both of whom joined Bovril.<br>
<br>Lawson Johnston became the main decision maker in the firm after the death of his father, showing especial care in the marketing and financial fields, and diversifying the company into related products. He considered Bovril's sources of raw materials to be so insecure that it needed to acquire them itself, and so large tracts of land in both South America and Australia were purchased and stocked with beef cattle. Subsidiary companies were established in 1908 and 1909 to run these operations, and in subsequent years he arranged for prize bulls, purchased in England, to be shipped out to improve the quality of the herd. The estates in Argentina eventually exceeded 1&frac12; million acres, and included a fully fitted factory and river boats to carry the cattle to it. Lawson Johnston took a personal interest in these <i>estancias</i>, visiting them most years. The estates in Australia were never as productive or as important to Bovril, because rainfall was inadequate and transport facilities poor.<br>
<br>The other policy pursued by Lawson Johnston was to reduce Bovril's reliance on a single product by diversifying the range of commodities offered to the public. This strategy concentrated on other foodstuffs with a &#145;healthy&#146; image. In 1899 a malt tonic, Virol, was introduced and became so popular that a separate company was formed and a new factory was built at the junction of Western Avenue and the North Circular in London. This was soon followed by Stelna corned beef, a by-product of making the meat extract; it was later renamed Bovril corned beef to cash in on the well-known brand name. In the 1920s Bovril acquired the Marmite Company, which had been established in Burton upon Trent in 1902 by Frederick Wissler, a Swiss citizen, to manufacture yeast extract with similar uses to Bovril, but catering for a vegetarian clientele. However, in order to keep the two companies separate in the public mind, no formal announcement of this was made and the shares were owned by a family trust. In the same decade Bovril (through Virol) bought into Ambrosia, which manufactured a range of milk-based products, thus further diversifying its product range.<br>
<br>Lawson Johnston also reorganized the finances of Bovril, as the flotation by Hooley had left the company over-capitalized and illiquid. Lawson Johnston set about building up a reserve fund and ensuring that the family, who had become only minority shareholders after the launch, albeit holding the single largest block, retained control of the destiny of the firm. The annual profits rose from &pound;125,000 in 1899 to &pound;400,000 in the late 1920s and the reserve fund grew to over &pound;1 million by 1940. Lawson Johnston rearranged the capital base of Bovril, raising finance via eight-year notes, and then redeeming those and the debentures via an issue of pre-preference shares taken up mainly by the family, and giving them greater control by means of double voting rights. When Lawson Johnston died Bovril was financially secure, diversified into a number of strong brands, and had large holdings abroad providing the raw materials.<br>
<br>Lawson Johnston was on many boards of directors by virtue of large shareholdings, family or business relationships, and his knowledge of certain areas of business. The companies of which he was a director included the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, Sir Isaac Pitman &amp; Sons, Lloyds Bank, the Ashanti Goldfields Corporation, the Forestal Land, Timber, and Railways Company, and the Australian Mercantile, Land, and Finance Company. He was also chairman of the national committee of the International Chamber of Commerce and attended many general congresses. Politically Lawson Johnston began as a Liberal, serving on several committees to do with raw materials in the First World War, for which in 1920 he was knighted. He switched allegiance after the war to the Conservatives, supporting Baldwin and Neville Chamberlain, and helping to establish the Conservative Research Department. In Baldwin's 1929 dissolution honours he was ennobled as Baron Luke. He was throughout his life an active and committed Christian, moving to the Church of England on his marriage, but remaining low church, and abhorring all ritual in church services. Luke endowed the Scripture Knowledge Foundation, sat on its committee, and was president at the time of his death. He also supported the <span class="italic">Boy's Own Paper</span> and <span class="italic">Girl's Own Paper</span>, and established the Luke Trust, the income from which endowed Christian charities.<br>
<br>A governor of the Regent Street Polytechnic from 1915 to 1943, and a tireless worker to raise funds for voluntary hospitals, Luke served on a number of hospital boards, including those for King Edward's Hospital Fund, the Royal Northern Hospital, and the Thankoffering Fund for George V's recovery. He also introduced clauses to bills in the House of Lords to allow hospitals to recoup from insurance companies the costs of treating accident victims. He was chairman of the Ministry of Health's advisory committee on nutrition from 1935 to 1941 and of the ministry of information's advisory committee on advertising agents from 1941 to 1943.<br>
<br>Luke was a great patriarch, placing immense store on his large extended family. He took responsibility for the family's financial stability, involving members in his own financial successes through shareholdings, directorships, and other investments. An inveterate worker, perpetually making notes and jotting down ideas, he rarely relaxed, except in the countryside, which he loved. He enjoyed riding to hounds, in spite of an aversion to dogs. He was a poor public speaker, but a firm and effective chairman. The death of his wife in 1941 was a great blow to him, and he himself died from lung cancer on 23 February 1943 at 2 Weymouth Street, London; he was buried at St Paul's Church, Bedford, on the 26th.<br>
<br>Luke's elder son, <a name="cosubject_62625"></a><span class="headword">Ian St John  Lawson Johnston</span>, second Baron Luke  (1905&#150;1996), <span class="occ">food manufacturer and company director</span>, was born on 7 June 1905. He attended Eton College and read history at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating in 1927. He then joined Bovril, with the understanding that eventually he would take over running the business, and studied beef production in Australia and South America. He married on 4 February 1932 Barbara (<i>b</i>. 1911), the younger daughter of Sir Fitzroy Hamilton Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe, first baronet; they had four sons and one daughter. Lawson Johnston served in the Territorial Army and on the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 became second in command of the 5th battalion, the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire regiment. In 1940 he was transferred to the 9th battalion, which he commanded, and so escaped the appalling fate of the 5th in Malaya. Released from the army following the death of his father, Luke became chairman of Bovril and its subsidiaries. Under his leadership the business, including Ambrosia and Marmite, expanded and prospered. He continued his family's interest in advertising. He retired in 1970 (shortly after which Bovril was acquired by Sir James Goldsmith's company Cavenham). His other appointments included directorships of Electrolux, Lloyds Bank, IBM, the Gateway Building Society, the Ashanti Goldfields Corporation, and other companies. Like his father, Luke was a devoted Anglican and did much voluntary work, in particular for hospital charities. A friend, admirer, and host of Billy Graham, he criticized Michael Ramsay, the archbishop of Canterbury, in 1967 for unenthusiastic remarks about the evangelist. He was British member of the International Olympic Committee (1951&#150;88) and after his retirement was replaced by the princess royal. He lived at Odell Castle, near Pavenham, Bedfordshire, which had been bought by his father in 1934, and was a county councillor, JP, and deputy lieutenant for Bedfordshire. He was appointed KCVO in 1976. He died on 25 May 1996, survived by his wife and their five children, and was succeeded as third baron by his eldest son, Arthur Charles St John Lawson Johnston (<i>b</i>. 1933).<br>
