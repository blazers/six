<span class="headword">Wharton,  Thomas</span>, first Baron Wharton  (<em>c.</em>1495&#150;1568), <span class="occ">soldier and administrator</span>, was born at Wharton in Westmorland, the eldest son and heir of Thomas Wharton (<i>d</i>. after 1515) of Wharton and Nateby, Lancashire, landowner, and his wife, Agnes, daughter of Reginald Warcop of Smardale, Westmorland, and his wife. The Whartons were a long-established gentry family in Westmorland and Cumberland with a service connection to the Clifford family. Thomas Wharton's great-grandfather was MP for the borough of Appleby, Westmorland, 1436&#150;7, a seat controlled by Thomas Clifford, eighth Lord Clifford, and his family held the manor of Wharton from the Cliffords throughout the fifteenth century. His father, as well as serving the Cliffords, also served the crown, particularly in the Scottish campaign of 1513 under Thomas Howard, earl of Surrey. When his father died, some time after 1515 when he finished his term as escheator in Cumberland and Westmorland, his wardship was given to Henry Clifford, tenth Lord Clifford, who sold it for 200 marks.<h2>
<a name="EarlycareerandservicetothePercyfamily15151537"></a>Early career and service to the Percy family, 1515&#150;1537</h2>Little is known of Wharton's early life. By 4 July 1518 he had married Eleanor (<i>d</i>. 1547&times;61), third daughter of Sir Brian Stapleton of Wighill, Yorkshire, and his wife, Joan. They had two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29173/', "Thomas Wharton, second Baron Wharton (1520&#150;1572)")</script>, and Sir Henry Wharton (<i>d</i>. 1550), and two daughters, Joanna and Agnes. More significantly, marriage into the Stapleton family brought him into the affinity of the Percy earls of Northumberland. In April 1522 Wharton served under the captain of Berwick, Sir Anthony Ughtred, on a raid into Scotland accompanied by Sir Thomas and Sir Ingram Percy, two sons of Henry Percy, fifth earl of Northumberland. Two years later he was appointed JP for Westmorland, perhaps evidence of his rising status with the Percy family and continuing ties with the Clifford family. He was knighted between 1527 and 1530. In 1529 Wharton was returned to the Reformation Parliament for Appleby and this was immediately followed by his being chosen as sheriff of Cumberland (1529&#150;30). Wharton's involvement with parliament continued throughout his career despite his increasing commitments in the north: he may have been chosen for Appleby again in 1536 and 1539 and almost certainly, along with his son Thomas, was returned as knight of the shire for Cumberland in 1542. After his elevation to the peerage in 1544 he was a regular attendee in the House of Lords.<br>
<br>Wharton epitomized the successful servant of a great nobleman, who was then recruited into royal service as a result of his conspicuous abilities. He entered the household of Henry Percy, sixth earl of Northumberland, between 1522 and 1528. In May 1528 he was made comptroller of the earl's household and steward of the lordships of Tadcaster and Healaugh in the West Riding of Yorkshire, as well as receiving an annuity of &pound;20 for life. In October 1530 a series of grants transformed him into the holder of &#145;traditional Percy authority in Cumberland&#146;  (Hoyle, &#145;The fall of the house of Percy&#146;, 189). These appointments were the lieutenancy of the honour of Cockermouth to be held by him and his heirs in perpetuity; the stewardship of the lordships of Eskdale and Wasdale and the constableship of Egremont Castle; the herbage of the park of Cockermouth, and a grant of mills, mines, and six manors in Cumberland at a below market-level rent of &pound;72 to be held by him and his heirs male; and an annuity of &pound;100 payable from the issues of those manors, in effect in lieu of rent. Wharton's place within the earl's affinity was strengthened by the close friendship with other Percy servants such as Sir Raynold Carnaby, gentleman of the chamber, and further favours from the ailing and incompetent earl. In 1534, on the disgrace of William Dacre, third Lord Dacre of Gilsland, Northumberland recommended Wharton for the captainship of Carlisle. This favour, and his continued service to Henry Clifford, fifteenth Lord Clifford and first earl of Cumberland, led to royal grants that reinforced his position within border society: he was appointed JP for Northumberland and the East Riding in 1532. He reinforced his local consequence through a series of marriage negotiations with leading members of the northern gentry; his daughter Agnes married Sir Richard Musgrave in 1534 and his best friend, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76487/', "Sir Thomas Curwen (c.1493&#150;1543)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/71862/', "Curwen family")</script>], married his sister Florence by 1538.<br>
<br>The reasons for Northumberland's favouring Wharton seem straightforward. It was not, as M. E. James supposed, to bolster the failing Percy influence in Cumberland in the face of hostility by the crown and the Cliffords. Rather, as Richard Hoyle has shown, Wharton's rise to prominence was in large part due to Northumberland's ill health and inherited indebtedness, which forced him to rely more and more heavily on men like Wharton and Carnaby. Moreover, Wharton's military prowess made him the ideal candidate for leading the Percy affinity in the defence of the borders. The earl drew attention to Wharton's service against the Scots and his talents were predominantly military.<h2>
<a name="Servicetotheking15371544"></a>Service to the king, 1537&#150;1544</h2>Wharton's standing was transformed by the outbreak of the Pilgrimage of Grace in 1536 and Northumberland's death in 1537. During the early stages of the pilgrimage he remained inactive and perhaps even went into hiding but, possibly because of his poor relationship with Dacre or even his reputation as a harsh landlord, he found himself a target of the rebels' hostility. He aided Thomas Howard, third duke of Norfolk, in the suppression of the rebellion and was well placed to benefit from the redistribution of power in the north in its aftermath. Wharton was recommended as warden of the west marches but Norfolk advised against appointing a gentleman rather than a nobleman to the office. Norfolk's point was that he felt only an established nobleman with a long-standing affinity had the necessary stature to carry out the office. Therefore, on 28 June 1537, Wharton was made deputy warden under the discredited Cumberland but effectively carried out the office. He was promoted to full warden on Cumberland's death in 1542. Between 1537 and 1544 Wharton continued to carve a military career for himself. He was appointed captain of Carlisle in October 1541, and in 1542 he presented an audacious plan to raid Scotland and capture James V at Lochmaben, Dumfriesshire. This plan was rejected and he consoled himself with raids north of the border in October and November of that year. On 24 November Wharton achieved the pinnacle of his career: victory over a Scottish army of some 18,000 men with just 3000 borderers at the battle of Solway Moss. He was aided by his kinsmen Sir William Musgrave and Walter Strickland in this, and his outstanding military success calls into question Michael Bush's assertion that Henry VIII's attempt to defend the marches without resort to noble power was a failure. As a result, Wharton was created first Baron Wharton by patent on 18 March 1544, with grants of land in co. Durham, Yorkshire, and Westmorland.<h2>
<a name="Bordermagnate15441560"></a>Border magnate, 1544&#150;1560</h2>Wharton was reappointed warden of the west marches on 1 February 1544 and held the office until 17 April 1549, when he was replaced by his rival, Dacre, in the shake-up of offices following the fall of Edward Seymour, duke of Somerset and lord protector to Edward VI. He was a member of the king's council in the north from about 1545. He was added to the quorum of the commission of the peace for Westmorland in 1547 and his heir was made JP for Westmorland and Cumberland at the same time. Wharton saw to it that his son was sheriff of Cumberland in 1547&#150;8. His reports on a border raid by the Scots of March 1547 were essential as a pretext for Somerset's invasion. With Matthew Stewart, earl of Lennox, he provided a diversionary raid during the Pinkie campaign by entering south-western Scotland and capturing a series of castles between 9 and 14 September. Wharton frequently dealt with the Assured Scots, including disseminating English propaganda to them, and had quite an effective network of spies in Scotland. He led frequent raids and had the difficult task of keeping the English garrisons in Scotland supplied during the campaign between 1547 and 1550. Serving the crown, despite conflict with neighbours, brought satisfaction and pride as well as local power and financial reward; Wharton told Somerset &#145;I have had great comfort many years from the good acceptance of my poor services to the King&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1601&#150;9</i>, <i>addenda</i>, <i>1547&#150;65</i>, 376). He was appointed deputy warden of the three marches on 31 July 1552 under John Dudley, duke of Northumberland, but was replaced in the west march by Sir Thomas Dacre in November.<br>
<br>After Mary I's accession Dacre became again warden of the west march and Wharton was appointed between July and December 1555 as, among other things, warden of the east and middle marches, captain of Berwick, constable of Alnwick Castle (where he appears to have resided), and steward of Rothbury, Northumberland. He was JP for all three ridings from 1554. In August 1557, upon the restoration of Thomas Percy as seventh earl of Northumberland, Wharton was named as joint warden with him. During Elizabeth I's reign he served as a counsellor assistant to Thomas Howard, fourth duke of Norfolk, the lieutenant-general of the north, but the latter's recommendation that he be reappointed captain of Berwick in June 1560 was not followed. Wharton married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1585), second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26926/', "Francis Talbot, fifth earl of Shrewsbury")</script>, and his first wife, Mary, and widow of John Bray, second Baron Bray, on 18 November 1561. They had no children.<br>
<br>Wharton's position in northern society was secured, above all, by service to the crown. His income from the family lands was probably less than &pound;100 a year but his fees from crown office were already 200 marks a year by 1537. By July 1552, as deputy warden under the duke of Northumberland, his annual income from fees was 1000 marks. Moreover, Wharton profited greatly from the dissolution of the monasteries. By March 1545, for example, he was steward of the former lands of Furness Abbey, Lancashire, and M. E. James has estimated that at its height his annual income from fees and wages was some &pound;700. He also received grants of lands to bolster his position. These included former monastic land but also parcels of the lands of the attainted Sir Francis Bigod in 1537. Further acquisitions in the West and North ridings and Cumberland made Wharton an important regional figure. No complete rental for these new lands exists but James has estimated that his annual rental income must have been in the order of &pound;750, some eight times that which he had inherited from his father.<br>
<br>Wharton was clearly a difficult and unpopular man. His unpopularity stems not from the fact that he was a &#145;new man&#146;, erected by Henry as part of a concerted effort to attack the regional power of the northern nobility, but, it appears, from his character itself. In the 1540s and 1550s, despite his family's long association with the Cliffords, he quarrelled openly with Cumberland, causing the intervention of the privy council. Similarly, Wharton had a long-standing feud with the Dacres. In 1551 and 1554 the privy council forced them into public displays of conciliation. This animosity does not seem to have stemmed primarily from their dislike of Wharton as a &#145;new man&#146;. In 1549 Somerset prevented Henry Wharton from fighting a duel with William Grey, thirteenth Lord Grey of Wilton, warden of the east march, and their lack of co-operation probably foiled a joint invasion of Scotland in February 1548, although betrayal by certain Assured Scots and bad strategic planning were also major factors. The skills that served Wharton so well as a soldier did not endear him to others. His ongoing feud with Robert Maxwell, sixth Lord Maxwell, which originated when Wharton hanged the latter's pledges in February 1548, was instrumental in his not being appointed warden of the west march in 1560. At Carlisle he was constantly at loggerheads with his subordinate officials and feuded with other local gentry, such as the Lampleughs and Musgraves. He was also an unpopular landlord: he was the focus of tenant discontent during the Pilgrimage of Grace and according to the Wharton family history his decision to empark Ravenstonedale in Westmorland led to such hatred towards him among his tenants that he abandoned living on his Westmorland estates for Healaugh in Yorkshire. However, this story seems to be apocryphal because he was being assessed for the subsidy in Cumberland during the 1540s. He maintained a house in Cannon Row, London, too. His unpopularity and the difficulties the Tudors experienced in governing the north of England in the years after 1536 stemmed not so much from the folly of a royal policy aimed at extinguishing the ancient northern nobility but from the failure of the Percy, Clifford, and Dacre families to produce adequate men for the job and the character of the monarch's chosen successors, men like Wharton.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears15601568"></a>Final years, 1560&#150;1568</h2>That Wharton was no radical, planted by the Tudors to upset the traditional social and political order of the northern shires, is confirmed by his own traditional piety. Wharton's religious beliefs seem to have been governed by that Tudor ideology, obedience to the crown. Despite his involvement in the dissolution of the monasteries and the chantries, in parliament he voted against the acts of 1549 authorizing priests to marry and against images. He was appointed to inquire into offences against the <span class="roman">Acts of Uniformity and Supremacy</span> in 1561. The preamble to his will followed a Catholic formula. His grammar school, established at Kirkby Stephen, Westmorland, by the terms of this will, remained doctrinally traditional despite embracing some of the newer, humanist disciplines.<br>
<br>Wharton was less active for the remainder of his life and did not attend parliament in 1559, 1563, or 1566. His heir's behaviour drew suspicion on the family. Wharton made his will on 18 July 1568 and died on 23 August at Healaugh, where he was buried on 22 September; a funeral monument was erected there showing him alongside his two wives. There is also a funeral monument to him at Kirkby Stephen.<br>
