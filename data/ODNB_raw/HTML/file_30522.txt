<span class="headword">Bailey,  Cyril</span>  (1871&#150;1957), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born on 13 April 1871 in Kensington, London, the eldest child (of six) of Alfred Bailey, barrister and sometime Stowell law fellow of University College, Oxford, and his wife, Fanny Margaret, eldest daughter of George Coles, rubber merchant, of the firm of Warne &amp; Co. He was cousin and godchild of Walter Leaf, editor of the <span class="italic">Iliad</span> and chairman of the Westminster Bank. Educated at St Paul's School (captain of the school in 1888&#150;90), he went up to Balliol College, Oxford, as a scholar in 1890; he was to remain intimately connected with both institutions all his life. As an undergraduate he won the Hertford and Craven scholarships, but not the Ireland. Like many of his family, he was a good athlete&#151;as cricketer, walker, cyclist, and mountaineer (member of the Alpine Club). He acted for the Oxford University Dramatic Society, and in later years he was active in producing Greek plays. He was of middle height, with a characteristic springy walk; his face is described as &#145;brown, lean, ascetic&#146;  (Lawrence Jones, <span class="italic">Balliol College Record</span>, 30). He aged slowly.<br>
<br>After taking a first in Greats (1894), Bailey was immediately offered a fellowship and tutorship at Exeter College; in 1902 he was able to return to Balliol as fellow and tutor; here he stayed for the rest of his career, retiring in 1939, but teaching again in the Second World War. Balliol was at that time the leading classical college in Oxford, and for twenty-five years Bailey shared with Arthur Pickard-Cambridge the tutoring of pupils of exceptional ability; some were known as &#145;Picker's boys&#146;, others as &#145;Cyril's boys&#146;. Pickard-Cambridge went on from his college tutorship to become a vice-chancellor and a prominent figure in national higher education; Bailey took the other option and stayed on, combining the burdens of a conscientious college tutor not only with research and publication but also with a considerable load of administration.<br>
<br>He was a tutor of the old style, spending many hours with undergraduates, sitting and talking informally in his rooms in the evening, and on reading parties in England and in the Alps. He was a much loved tutor, who had the gift of sympathy, and many of his former pupils stayed in touch for decades; all those who knew him remark on his talent for friendship. He also found time to be a leading figure and trustee of the Balliol Boys' Club, a successful venture which brought together undergraduates and young men of the town. He wrote a short history of the club (1953). This activity was one expression of his concern for redressing the perceived injustices of society and spreading the benefits of education much more widely. His experience with the boys' club led to his becoming chairman of the Oxford Youth Advisory Committee; for his work in this area he was made CBE in 1939.<br>
<br>Bailey was a highly successful lecturer, though he used to comment wryly on the complete lack of instruction or help for novice lecturers. In the fashion of the time, much of his teaching took the form of &#145;composition&#146;, stylish translation from English into Greek and Latin prose and verse. Bailey was an elegant composer, and he had a fine presence and delivery; he was a natural choice as the university's public orator (1932&#150;9). But he was not, like some Oxford and Cambridge dons of the time, content with this sort of scholarly activity. He had a lifelong interest, which issued in a number of substantial books, in the philosopher&#150;poet Lucretius, one of the greatest of Latin poets, and in the Greek philosopher Epicurus, whose system Lucretius versified in his extraordinary poem <span class="italic">De rerum natura</span> (&#145;On the nature of the world&#146;).<br>
<br>In 1900 Bailey published, at the age of twenty-nine, a text of Lucretius in the <span class="roman">Oxford Classical Texts</span> series. The series itself was new; not many British classical scholars at the time had any real mastery of the exacting techniques of editing a text, and those commissioning the first volumes made a number of mistakes. As Bailey observed later, it was &#145;much too early really, as I knew little about Lucretius and almost nothing about the principles of creating a text&#146;  (unpublished autobiography). Housman was characteristically severe: &#145;Some care, some judgment, and some independence are shown here, but not quite enough&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Classical Papers of A. E. Housman</span>, ed. J. Diggle and F. R. D. Goodyear, 1972, 523). A second edition appeared in 1922. Bailey produced in 1926 <span class="italic">Epicurus</span>, a collection of the fragments and the evidence for this important thinker. The book is useful, but it is not all-inclusive; it did not replace the more voluminous work, <span class="italic">Epicurea</span>, of Hermann Usener. In 1928 appeared <span class="italic">The Greek Atomists and Epicurus</span>, a study of the background of Epicurus's philosophy. It was well received, but in these books he avoided tackling the extremely difficult problems posed by the newly appearing papyrus fragments of Epicurus. That sort of abstruse and detailed philological work was not really to his taste.<br>
<br>The crown of Bailey's long Lucretian labours was his massive edition of <span class="italic">De rerum natura</span>, with translation and commentary, in three volumes, which appeared in 1947. All his work has the great merit of clarity of thought and elegance of expression; it is no surprise that he succeeded in the extremely difficult task of producing a skilful and readable English translation of Lucretius. Housman had criticized Bailey's Latin text of 1900 as too conservative; that of 1947 had become still more so. The commentary is rich in illustrative material, and the reader is in the presence of a guide who is fair-minded, judicious, and well informed. Critics were generally respectful, but some remarked on a comparative weakness in the editor's mastery of, or interest in, early Latin. Sometimes, too, one does not quite find the sort of sharply angled discussion which would illuminate particular problems; and Bailey does not respond very readily to a certain vertiginous quality in Lucretius' style, a sense of violence and extremity, so strangely at odds with the Epicurean philosophy of serenity and calm.<br>
<br>Bailey is the only tutorial fellow of an Oxford or Cambridge college to have been invited to the University of California to give the Sather lectures, the most prestigious set of lectures in the classical field. In 1932 he gave a set of eight lectures, which were published as <span class="italic">Phases in the Religion of Ancient Rome</span>. The book is very much in the spirit of Warde Fowler, of Lincoln College, Oxford, who had a great influence on him. The American trip made a great impression, and in his unpublished autobiography he makes interesting comments on a range of things that struck him, not all favourably&#151;he records his shock at seeing a black professor being isolated at a separate table in a college refectory. Three years later appeared <span class="italic">Religion in Virgil</span>, a slightly disappointing production, in which the desire to set out the evidence in full and with fairness seems to have been indulged at the expense of exploring Virgil's thought or endeavouring to give answers to the questions raised.<br>
<br>Bailey had been convinced by Gilbert Murray of the vital importance for the classics of popularization. He edited a collection of essays, <span class="italic">The Legacy of Rome</span> (1923) to which H. H. Asquith contributed an introduction; the book was a great popular success. He also saw the importance of maintaining close links between classicists in universities and teachers of the subject in schools, and he was assiduous in visiting schools, a regular examiner in school certificate examinations, and for years the chairman of the annual joint conference affectionately known as &#145;Dons and beaks&#146;. He was elected a governor of his old school, St Paul's, in 1901, and served for fifty years. He also served as a governor of Marlborough College. After his retirement, living in the village of East Hanney, he became a member of the governing body of the village school.<br>
<br>At that period Bailey also served on the parochial church council and the Wantage rural district council: he was the sort of man whom people wanted on their committees and similar bodies. He was president of the Old Pauline Club from 1921 to 1931, &#145;after which&#146;, he used to say, &#145;they reduced the maximum term to three years&#146;  (unpublished autobiography). He was a founder member of the Governing Bodies Association. Closer to his academic interests, he was a delegate of the Oxford University Press from 1921 to 1946, playing a central part in the decisions of the press in that difficult time. He devoted many hours and infinite tact to the long struggles and the bitter quarrels that plagued the early years of the project to produce an <span class="italic">Oxford Latin Dictionary</span> to replace that of Lewis and Short. Work on the book began in 1932, but the first fascicle was not published until 1968, eleven years after Bailey's death on 5 December 1957, at his home, The Mulberries, East Hanney. His contribution to the project, of which he was for some years senior co-editor, was very great.<br>
<br>Bailey was the best-loved Balliol figure of his time and probably the most widely known, both to undergraduates and to old members. Many people expected him to be elected master of the college in 1924, in succession to A. L. Smith. When the college elected A. D. Lindsay, Bailey's response was both publicly and privately magnanimous. The charm of his personality was felt very widely. Eduard Fraenkel, a great &eacute;migr&eacute; scholar, who was sometimes impatient with the amateurishness of British classicists, was asked which he put higher, Bailey or Pickard-Cambridge. The audience expected that preference would be given to the more technically irreproachable work of Pickard-Cambridge on the Attic theatre. After a short pause, Fraenkel replied with a line of Aristophanes  (<span class="italic">Frogs</span>, 1413): &#145;One I think is clever, but the other is my delight&#146;.<br>
<br>In January 1912 Bailey married Gemma Creighton (<i>d</i>. 1958), youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32626/', "Mandell Creighton")</script>, historian of the papacy and bishop of London. She was Gilbert Murray's secretary, and they met at a class on Horace which Bailey was giving for women undergraduates at Oxford&#151;both facts, in their different ways, being marks of his comparatively liberal attitudes. The marriage was unassailably happy. They had three daughters and one son. In 1923 she published a <span class="italic">Short History of Lady Margaret Hall</span>. That college was one of their shared interests: Bailey was chairman of the council of Lady Margaret Hall from 1921 to 1939, and was elected an honorary fellow. He was also an honorary fellow of Balliol, received honorary degrees from Oxford, Durham, Wales, Glasgow, and California, and&#151;the honour which, he recorded, gave him most pleasure&#151;was elected FBA in 1933.<br>
<br>Music played an important part in Bailey's life. He was among the moving spirits of the Oxford Subscription Concerts, and for years he was a devoted member of the Bach Choir (&#145;one of the deepest joys of my life&#146;; unpublished autobiography), becoming its president, although by his own account his singing was less than ravishing. He published a lively memoir of its controlling genius, Sir Hugh Allen. Bailey was a man of deep Christian faith, regular in his attendance at the college chapel. There is a drawing of him in chalk by Sir William Rothenstein and an etching by Andrew Freeth, both in Balliol. Those who knew the sitter regard the latter as the better likeness.<br>
<br>Bailey's career, like that of Russell Meiggs in the next generation at Balliol, is in a sense a period piece. For a certain time, roughly perhaps from 1840 to 1990, there were scholars of first-rate ability and international reputation who preferred not to seek promotion, titles, or even relief from the duties of teaching, and who were content with the position of tutor at an Oxford college, lavishing much of their time and energy on their pupils. They are not likely, in the present atmosphere of British academic life, to have many successors.<br>
