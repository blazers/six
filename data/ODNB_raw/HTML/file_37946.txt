<span class="headword">Scrope,  Emanuel</span>, earl of Sunderland  (1584&#150;1630), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the only child and heir of Thomas Scrope, tenth Baron Scrope (<i>c</i>.1567&#150;1609), and his wife, Philadelphia (<i>d</i>. 1627), lady-in-waiting to Queen Anne and daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4649/', "Henry Carey, first Baron Hunsdon")</script>, a cousin of Queen Elizabeth I. He was born probably in Hunsdon, Hertfordshire, on 1 August 1584, matriculated from Queen's College, Oxford, on 25 June 1596, and succeeded his father as eleventh baron, and as steward of the royal honour of Richmondshire, in 1609. The Scropes owned extensive estates in Wensleydale (whose value had been increased in the late sixteenth century by mineral exploitation) and at Langar in Nottinghamshire. Scrope was much more the courtier than his father had been&#151;a participant in court masques and festivities and notorious as a gamester, burdened with large gambling debts. He had Catholic sympathies, however, and came to be regarded in the north as a patron of recusants. As a result, in January 1619, during one of the pro-Spanish phases of James I's foreign policy, he was appointed lord president of the council in the north, replacing Edmund, third Baron Sheffield, lately a persecutor of Catholics, probably at the prompting of the Spanish ambassador, Gondomar.<br>
<br>Scrope now headed an institution already discredited by the involvement of its late president, Sheffield, and secretary, Sir Arthur Ingram, in the hated alum monopoly, regarded as responsible for the depression in the West Riding clothing industry. His pro-recusant policies increased the council's unpopularity, particularly among the puritan clothiers, whose formidable leader was the late parliamentary oppositionist, Sir John Savile. The lord president tried to attract support by embarking on a reform of the council, particularly by a reduction in its fees, but could make little progress against the obstructionism of Secretary Ingram, who had the backing at court of the lord treasurer, Lionel Cranfield. Scrope relied almost exclusively on George Villiers, first duke of Buckingham, but consequently had to adapt himself to the tergiversations of the latter's policies. By 1627 Buckingham's pro-Catholic foreign policy had collapsed and he was bent on a French war; the need now was for the service of men with enough local influence to raise money for this purpose. Sir John Savile, Scrope's principal opponent, was therefore introduced into the council as its vice-president but effective head, Scrope's presidency retaining only a titular significance. He was compensated by being raised, on 19 June 1627, to the earldom of Sunderland. However, this arrangement too collapsed when the assassination of Buckingham in August 1628 led Charles I to call a parliament. In this Sir Thomas Wentworth, Savile's old Yorkshire enemy and rival, played a leading role in the House of Commons. There charges of corruption were successfully brought against the vice-president, and in November 1629 his resignation from the office was forced. Scrope followed suit in December, receiving &pound;3000 for his office, and Sir Thomas Wentworth succeeded him as lord president.<br>
<br>Irrespective of his merits, the weakness in Scrope's position made success in his office unlikely. He was hampered by his Catholic sympathies, his inadequate local following, and his lack of independent political weight at court. He was already in poor health at the time of his resignation, and he did not long survive it; he died on 30 May 1630 and was buried at Langar on 6 June. He left no children from his marriage to Lady Elizabeth Manners (<i>d</i>. 1654), daughter of John, fourth earl of Rutland. The barony of Scrope devolved on the representative of his niece Mary but was not taken up; the earldom of Sunderland became extinct. Scrope had a liaison with his servant Martha Jeanes, with whom he had a natural son and three daughters. John, the son, became a fellow-commoner of Trinity College, Oxford, and died unmarried. Two of the daughters, Mary and Annabella, eventually inherited the Scrope estates. A third daughter, Elizabeth, married Thomas Savage, Earl Rivers.<br>
