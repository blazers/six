<span class="headword">Arnold,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1635&#150;1702), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in Southwark, the first son of Nicholas Arnold (<i>d</i>. 1665) of Llanfihangel Crucornau, Monmouthshire, and his wife, Lettice Moore, daughter and heir of Sir Edward Moore of Drogheda, co. Louth. His marriage in September 1666 to Margaret, daughter of William Cooke of Highnam, Gloucestershire, brought him to the attention of the marquess of Worcester, who appointed him to the deputy lieutenancy and commissions of the peace in Monmouthshire. In 1677 he was removed from office by his former patron for opposing the latter's candidate at the contested Monmouthshire by-election ten years earlier and for resisting the enclosure of Wentwood Forest. Afterwards, Arnold joined Sir Trevor Williams and other local gentlemen to oppose Worcester's political ambitions in south Wales. In March 1678 he informed the House of Commons about the existence of a large Catholic community in Monmouthshire. The Commons ordered an inquiry which resulted in his restoration to the bench in 1679.<br>
<br>The heated political atmosphere of the Popish Plot gave Arnold the opportunity to proceed against Roman Catholics in south Wales. His efforts led to the dispersal of a Jesuit college at Cwm in Herefordshire and the executions of Fathers David Lewis, Philip Evans, John Lloyd, and others. He stood for Monmouth in opposition to Worcester's son at the second general election in 1679, but was defeated. It was thought that his &#145;violent and malicious proceedings&#146; had cost him political support  (Badminton muniments, FmE 4/1/6). However, he was seated after petitioning the committee of privileges (26 November 1680). In the meantime, Arnold worked to revive the flagging Popish Plot. In April 1680 he claimed to have been brutally beaten by papists in Jacknapes Lane, London. One contemporary described it as &#145;the second part of the Edmund Berry Godfrey tragedy&#146;, referring to the sensational murder of the London magistrate in 1678  (Althorp MS C2). The incident generated public sympathy (but also earned him the nickname from his enemies of Cut-Throat Arnold). When Arnold returned home to Monmouthshire he was greeted &#145;by some hundreds of my friends&#146; and was &#145;almost hugged to death&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1679&#150;80</i>, 483). Only later did the tory journalist Roger L'Estrange show his claims to have been false.<br>
<br>For several years Arnold played the part of a popular whig hero. He was admitted to the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92786', "Green Ribbon Club")</script> in November 1679 and he enjoyed a reputation as one of &#145;the most noisy, impudent and ignorant&#146; members of the second Exclusion Parliament  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1660&#150;90</span>, 1.546). He was re-elected for Monmouth in 1681, taking a large armed guard with him to Oxford to safeguard him from papist attacks. In November 1683 he and Sir Trevor Williams were arrested and charged under the <span class="roman">Statute of <i>Scandalum magnatum</i></span>. Arnold was found guilty of saying, among other things, that<blockquote>my Lord Marquis of Worcester is a rank papist, for all his dissimulation and outward appearance to blind the world, and if he had his own way &hellip; he would be a means to cut the throats of all you that are the Protestant clergy of the Church of England. (Badminton muniments, FmE 3/16)</blockquote>He also allegedly spoke in favour of a republic, saying &#145;we shall bring the King's head to the block, as the fool, the ass, his father's was, and then you shall see us play football with the bastards he leaves&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1660&#150;90</span>, 1.546). He remained in prison until 1686 in lieu of paying the &pound;10,000 fine.<br>
<br>In 1689 Arnold sat for Southwark in the Convention Parliament, where he was a very active member. He was appointed to ninety-one committees, including those dealing with the comprehension and toleration bills. On 28 January he seconded Gilbert Dolben's motion to declare the throne vacant. He also supported the disabling clause in the bill to restore corporations. A court whig under William III, he sat for Monmouth from 1695 to 1698. After Arnold's death in 1702, his heir, Nicholas Arnold (<i>b</i>. 1669), sold Llanthony and Llanfihangel to the Harleys of Brampton Bryan.<br>
