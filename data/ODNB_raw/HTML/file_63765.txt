<span class="headword">Lynegar,  Charles</span> <span class="st"> [Cormac &Oacute; Luin&iacute;n]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1708&#150;1731), <span class="occ">Irish-language scholar and antiquary</span>, was probably born in co. Fermanagh, Ireland, the son of Matha B&aacute;n &Oacute; Luin&iacute;n. The self-styled <i>ardollamh &Eacute;ireann</i> (&#145;chief master of bardic learning in Ireland&#146;), he belonged to the last generation of <i>seanchaidhe</i> (&#145;shanachies&#146; or antiquaries), hereditary keepers of the genealogies and legendary history of the Irish chiefs in medieval and early modern times. The medieval U&iacute; Luin&iacute;n, like many others of their profession, were also hereditary erenaghs, or stewards of church lands, in the parish of Derryvullen, co. Fermanagh. An &Oacute; Luin&iacute;n took part in transcribing the annals of Ulster, which record individuals of this surname as scholars and churchmen from the late fourteenth century onwards. Even after the Ulster plantation a Giollaph&aacute;draig, or Patrick &Oacute; Luin&iacute;n (<i>fl</i>. 1638&#150;1641), was employed as scribe and genealogist by the nobleman Brian Mag Uidhir of Tempo. The protestant Reformation resulted in erenagh families becoming simply tenants of Anglican bishops in the relevant dioceses, and many converted to Anglicanism, perhaps including Charles's grandfather, Matha &Oacute; Luin&iacute;n. He changed his name to Matthew Lynegar and translated the name of the family estate, Ard U&iacute; Luin&iacute;n, to &#145;Mount Lynegar&#146; and his hereditary profession of <i>seanchaidh</i> to &#145;chief antiquary and king-at-arms of Ireland&#146;, in which character he drew up pedigrees for many English planter families as well as the descendants of Irish chieftains.<br>
<br>Charles Lynegar appears to have inherited some of his grandfather's manuscripts, but not Mount Lynegar. The collector Charles O'Conor of Belanagare (1710&#150;1790) styled him Cormac (&#145;of the C&uacute;l&#146;), son of Matha (&#145;the White&#146;) &Oacute; Luin&iacute;n, suggesting an association with the half-barony of Coole, co. Fermanagh, rather than the barony of Tirkennedy in which Mount Lynegar itself lay. Army lists of the period have been searched in vain for a commission justifying his use of the title Captain Lynegar. The earliest definite information known is his employment by the fellows of Trinity College, Dublin, in 1708 to teach Irish to the divinity students there, not as a permanent member of staff, but paid by voluntary contributions collected among the fellows themselves. He used the title &#145;Professor of Irish at Trinity College Dublin&#146; thenceforth to 1731, when his teaching was interrupted by a sojourn in the city's Marshalsea prison for debtors. Nothing further is known of his career.<br>
<br>During these years Lynegar supplemented his meagre salary by drawing up pedigrees for the Anglo-Irish and Gaelic aristocracy and assisting John Richardson in translating the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> into Irish (published in 1712). As well as acting as scribe for John Hall, vice-provost of Trinity, he addressed an Irish eulogy to him in 1709, composed in a faulty version of the bardic metre <i>deibhidhe</i>. He was later to reuse some of the verses in a similar eulogy addressed to Lord St George, vice-admiral of Connaught (1727&#150;35). Lynegar formed one of the circle of Irish scribes and men of letters that gathered in Dublin around the leading figures of Tadhg and Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Neachtain, though he was not apparently popular with them. A satire in Irish accuses him not only of protestantism, but of falsifying genealogies to flatter the patrons who paid him. It is these Irish-speaking colleagues who sometimes refer to him as Cathal, the more usual Irish-language equivalent for the name Charles.<br>
