<span class="headword">Ram,  Thomas</span>  (1564&#150;1634), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland bishop of Ferns and Leighlin</span>, was born at Windsor, the son of Dr Francis Ram (1537&#150;1617) and his wife, Helen. He was educated at Eton College (<i>c</i>.1583&#150;1588) and at King's College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1588, graduated BA in 1592&#150;3, MA in 1596, and held a fellowship from 1591 to 1601. In 1599 he accompanied the earl of Essex on his ill-fated expedition to Ireland, subsequently becoming chaplain to his successor, Lord Deputy Mountjoy. In July 1600 he acquired the first of his many Irish benefices, the prebend of St John's, attached to Christ Church, Dublin, which he held until 1602. There followed, among others, the deanery of Cork (1601&#150;5), the precentorship of Christ Church, Dublin (1601&#150;34), the vicarage of Balrothery (1604), the deanery of Ferns (1604&#150;26), and the rectory of Wexford (1605&#150;22) and prebend of Fethard (1629&#150;34), both in the diocese of Ferns. Though made bishop of Ferns and Leighlin in 1605 (nominated 6 February, consecrated 2 May), he retained a number of his benefices <i>in commendam</i> because of the poverty of the sees, the result of his sixteenth-century predecessors' habit of leasing valuable lands for low rents and high entry fines.<br>
<br>One of a number of committed English protestants appointed to Irish bishoprics at the start of the seventeenth century, Ram proved conscientious, residing in Ferns and Leighlin, travelling to Dublin to attend the chapter of Christ Church, and making an annual visitation of his diocese, as well as producing detailed reports for official inquiries in 1612, 1615, and 1622. But efforts to restore episcopal finances and spread protestantism made very slow progress. He began legal proceedings to recover illegally leased lands, and increased the value of Ferns from &pound;66 when he was appointed to &pound;120 by 1622, though it was not until after his death that the firm hand of Lord Deputy Wentworth forced the issue. He built a new episcopal residence at Leighlin, and bequeathed his library for the use of his clergy (it was destroyed in the 1641 rising). He improved the quality of the ministry by attracting local ordinands and educating them at the new University of Dublin (Trinity College), but made little headway with the lay population. In a revealing account written in 1612, he told of his efforts to use his legal powers to make the inhabitants come to church. Though some of the ordinary people confessed privately to him their desire to conform, their social superiors were, he concluded, so firmly committed to Catholicism that, together with the priests, they could ensure that Catholics shunned the established church and its institutions. Thus all those who attended the two protestant schools in his dioceses were warned by one local priest that they and their children risked damnation. Ram joined with most of the other Church of Ireland bishops in 1626 to sign a protest against the proposed toleration of Catholicism, and is recorded in 1631 implementing official policies to close down Catholic mass-houses. He died on 24 November 1634, reportedly of apoplexy, while attending convocation in Dublin, and was buried at Gorey, co. Wexford, in a chapel which he had built on his own estate, Ramsfort.<br>
<br>Ram founded an enduring dynasty. He had married first Jane Thompson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gilford (or Gifford), with whom he had one son and four daughters, and second, Anne Bowen, with whom he had three sons and one daughter. His eldest son, Thomas, inherited Ramsfort, and one of his descendants, Colonel Abel Ram, was the &#145;ram of Gorey&#146; who fell foul of Swift in 1728. His second son, <a name="cosubject_23064"></a><span class="headword">Robert Ram</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1657), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated BA in 1611, MA in 1614 (incorporated Cambridge 1615), and was a fellow (1615), and where he was maintained by the income from a prebend in Ferns. After ordination he served first as rector of St James's Church, Colchester, then as minister of Spalding in Lincolnshire. In 1639 he married Anne, daughter of Tyringham Norwood. During the English civil war he came to prominence as a strong supporter of the parliamentary cause. In January 1643 he wrote to the people of the neighbouring town of Croyland condemning their folly in resisting parliament. They responded in March by launching a raid on Spalding, capturing Ram and some other inhabitants. These they deployed as hostages, twice tying Ram to the ramparts of Croyland in an effort to dissuade the attacking parliamentary forces. On 27 April the town was finally taken by Cromwell, and Ram freed after five weeks' imprisonment. Nothing daunted, he became chaplain to Colonel Edward Rossiter's regiment and is next found preaching to the soldiers in March 1646 before Newark, reassuring them that &#145;Your enemies are Gods enemies&#146; since &#145;The Lord of Hosts is our <i>generalissimo</i>&#146;  (R. Ram, <span class="italic">A Sermon Preached at Balderton</span>, 1646, 11&#150;12). His most popular work was <span class="italic">The Souldiers Catechism</span>, published in 1644, which reached its seventh edition by the following year. In it he defended the iconoclasm of the parliamentary soldiers, and attacked the prayer book as a brazen serpent, &#145;the most abominable idol in the land&#146;  (R. Ram, 21&#150;2). In 1684 the <span class="italic">Catechism</span> was republished, but this time it was dedicated to Chief Justice Jeffries to serve as a warning of the dangers of those times &#145;when men were taught rebellion as a principle of religion &hellip; to fight against God's anointed&#146;  (R. Ram, eighth edn, sig. A1<i>v</i>). Theologically, Robert Ram was an orthodox Calvinist, a defender of presbyterianism and of infant baptism, concerned about the excesses of the religious radicals. On leaving the army he returned to Spalding and was buried there on 4 May 1657.<br>
