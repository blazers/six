<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lassell,  William</span>  (1799&#150;1880), <span class="occ">astronomer</span>, was born on 18 June 1799 in Bolton, Lancashire, where his father, Nathaniel (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1812), was in business as a timber merchant and builder with James Gregson, a brother-in-law. Lassell's mother, Hannah, came from a Liverpool business family. The religious backgrounds of his family were Congregationalist and Independent, and William (who until the late 1840s was often known as William Lassell junior) completed his education at the Rochdale dissenting academy. He maintained religious interests throughout his life.<br>
<br>Although no record seems to have survived of the trade he entered, Lassell became an apprentice in Liverpool about 1815. By 1825 he was being listed in a Liverpool directory as a brewer. Two years later, on 8 May 1827, he married Maria King, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gregson, in Toxteth, Liverpool. Maria and at least three daughters survived him. The success of Lassell's brewing business, in which he sometimes traded with various partners, enabled him to lavish many thousands of pounds on his astronomical endeavours. Even so, at his death his estate was valued at almost &pound;70,000.<br>
<br>Lassell early developed strong scientific interests. These interests were linked to his fascination with machinery through the construction, as well as the use, of reflecting telescopes, a hobby he began no later than 1821. By 1837 he had completed an excellent reflecting telescope with a speculum metal main mirror 9 inches in diameter. This, his first major instrument, was followed by two much more powerful telescopes, the first a 24 inch reflector completed in 1845 (which followed an identical design to the 9 inch). A huge 48 inch that required two assistants for its operation went into service in 1861.<br>
<br>An innovative telescope builder, Lassell, along with Lord Rosse, was instrumental in pushing reflectors well beyond the state of the art as defined in the late eighteenth century by William Herschel. Lassell's tenacity and mechanical skills were evidenced by his mastery of the making and use of such awkward instruments (when the 24 inch was erected at the Royal Greenwich Observatory after his death, it was not a success in other hands). His main contributions were to apply equatorial mountings to large reflectors and to develop steam-driven machines for grinding and polishing big telescope mirrors in which the movements closely matched those used in polishing mirrors by hand.<br>
<br>Lassell was closely and directly involved in the construction of his telescopes, only some larger pieces of metalwork being contracted out. However, he was aided in his undertakings by his close friend James Nasmyth, one of the most skilled and versatile engineers of his generation, as well as an avid amateur astronomer. It was Nasmyth, for example, who built, from Lassell's design, Lassell's first successful polishing machine. Another intimate friend was William Rutter Dawes. For many years a dissenting minister at Ormskirk, Dawes was a renowned astronomical observer, and he eased Lassell's access to wider scientific circles.<br>
<br>The 24 inch telescope was built by Lassell while at Starfield, his first suburban mansion in Liverpool. In 1855 he moved 2 miles further from the centre of the city, to Bradstones. Here the 48 inch was assembled between 1858 and 1860. But in 1861, in order to escape the ever troublesome Liverpool atmosphere, as well as to observe from a more southerly latitude, Lassell, as he had done with the 24 inch in 1852, shipped the 48 inch to Valletta, Malta, where it served him for three years. As this was a far better site than that of Lord Rosse's 72 inch reflector, the more famous &#145;Leviathan of Parsonstown&#146;, in Ireland, Lassell's telescope was arguably the most powerful in the world.<br>
<br>When Lassell returned to England (taking up residence at Ray Lodge in Maidenhead, Berkshire), he did not re-erect the 48 inch, preferring to observe with his smaller but easier to manage 24 inch. In 1864 he offered the 48 inch as a gift to the Melbourne observatory in Australia. The Royal Society committee then charged with securing a large telescope for the observatory declined, preferring to start from scratch with a design for a new reflector by the Dublin maker Thomas Grubb, a choice with which the Melbourne authorities agreed. Eventually, in 1877, nearly all of the 48 inch was consigned to scrap.<br>
<br>As an observer, Lassell was little interested in the sort of painstaking positional astronomy pursued by professionals, nor did he possess the mathematical training and skills to engage in debates in theoretical astronomy. Although he did spend some time observing nebulae, he was most enthusiastic about examining the planets of the solar system (especially Saturn) and in searching for new satellites orbiting around them. His first major find was that of Triton, Neptune's largest satellite, which he first glimpsed within weeks of the discovery of Neptune itself in September 1846. In 1848 he found (almost simultaneously with W. C. Bond at Harvard) Hyperion, a satellite of Saturn, and in 1851 he detected Ariel and Umbriel, two faint satellites of Uranus. A catalogue of some 600 new nebulae was the work of his assistant, Albert Marth, an accomplished positional astronomer, whom he hired for the second stay at Malta. When Lassell engaged him, in 1862, Marth had published on, among other things, the planetary satellites of Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, interests very much in line with Lassell's keen pursuit of new satellites. It also says much for Lassell's independence of mind that he ignored the strident advice of the then astronomer royal, George Biddell Airy, not to employ Marth.<br>
<br>Lassell was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1849, and in 1858 he was one of the Royal Society's royal medallists. Active in a variety of scientific societies, he was president of the Royal Astronomical Society from 1870 to 1872. Lassell was an administrator, not a reformer who sought to take the society in a radical new direction. He died in his sleep at his home, Ray Lodge, Maidenhead, on 5 October 1880.<br>
