<span class="headword">Skipwith, Sir  William</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1320, <em>d.</em> in or before 1398), <span class="occ">justice</span>, was probably born about 1320, into an old Yorkshire family that took its name from the village of Skipwith. The second son of William Skipwith and his wife, Margaret, daughter and heir of Ralph Fitzsimon of South Ormsby, Lincolnshire, the younger William entered the legal profession, and became one of the longest-serving justices of the fourteenth century. His career as a lawyer may have begun in York. In 1341 the vicars-choral of St Peter's, York, appointed him their attorney, and in 1348 he represented the city in parliament. By 1345 he had married a Lincolnshire heiress, Alice Hiltoft, who was to inherit the manors of North and South Hiltoft and Ingoldmells from her father Sir William, and the manors of Cawthorpe, Covenham, and Uphall from her mother, Alice Muer, by 1361. At his own father's death (probably before 1361) Skipwith inherited parts of the manors of Skipwith and Menthorpe in Yorkshire, and the Lincolnshire manors of Bigby and Thorpe, his elder brother John having died prematurely. From his mother, he was to acquire by 1369 the manors of South Ormsby and Ketsby in Lincolnshire.<br>
<br>In Michaelmas term 1344 Skipwith was created a serjeant-at-law, and his arguments in court begin to be reported frequently in the year-books. He was retained as a king's serjeant in 1354, and in 1359 was appointed a justice of the common pleas. Within a few months he was knighted, and in June 1361 became chief baron of the exchequer. In 1344 he had received the first of many appointments to oyer and terminer commissions in the midlands and Yorkshire. He rode the midland circuit on assize from 1347 to 1359, and the northern circuit from 1360 to 1365. Throughout his career he saw continuous service on commissions of the peace and gaol delivery in the midlands and Yorkshire, and was also often appointed to survey dikes and ditches there. For six years after its promulgation in 1350 he heard cases under the <span class="roman">Statute of Labourers</span> in several counties. Service on judicial commissions had its perils. At an oyer and terminer session in Louth a defendant drew his sword and seized Skipwith by the throat, causing him to adjourn proceedings.<br>
<br>A number of wealthy magnates also sought Skipwith's services, including Ralph Stafford, earl of Stafford (<i>d</i>. 1372), and John, Lord Willoughby, to whose son and heir, Robert, Skipwith had married his eldest daughter, Alice, by 1370. But his most important private employer was Edward, prince of Wales, who in September 1355 retained him at 50<i>s</i>. per annum to provide counsel and plead; in 1362 this fee was doubled. At the height of his influence, however, in October 1365 Sir William suddenly fell from grace. The chronicler Knighton reports that he and Henry Green (<i>d</i>. 1369), the chief justice of the king's bench, were dismissed from office for &#145;enormous infidelities&#146;, and imprisoned until they had paid large fines to the king. No record of proceedings against them survives, but Sir William and several associates, mostly of Lincolnshire, gave two recognizances to the crown for the sum of 4000 marks in April and May 1366. On 10 February 1370, after half the money had been paid, Sir William was pardoned, and five days later he was appointed chief justice for pleas in Ireland. In 1373 he returned to England and began to serve again on judicial commissions. In 1374 he was appointed justice of north and south Wales by the Black Prince, and by October 1376 his rehabilitation was complete, with his reappointment as justice of the common pleas. In the following year he was back on the midland assize circuit, switching in 1385 to the northern circuit. His rapid restoration to office led earlier historians to invent a second Sir William Skipwith, whose first judicial appointment was to the Irish bench in 1370.<br>
<br>By April 1377 Skipwith had entered the service of John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, who appointed him his chief justice. Presiding over proceedings brought against William Wykeham (<i>d</i>. 1404) at Gaunt's instigation in November 1376, Sir William refused to grant the defendant an adjournment to seek counsel, expressly in retribution for Wykeham's similar treatment of Gaunt's ally, William, Lord Latimer (<i>d</i>. 1381), in the Good Parliament earlier that year. The Anonimalle chronicle also reports that Sir William sternly rebutted Wykeham's claim that as chancellor he was not accountable for his office, and Wykeham was fined &pound;64,000.<br>
<br>His memory of his own dismissal probably loomed large in the only crisis Skipwith faced during Richard II's reign. When summoned to the council at Nottingham in 1387 to give an opinion on the king's assertion of his royal prerogative, he pleaded illness, thereby avoiding the fate that subsequently befell his fellow judges. However, he and his two eldest sons were among the Lincolnshire gentry who swore an oath to uphold the lords appellant in 1388. That year he retired from the bench, although appointed a trier of petitions in parliament, as he had been in every parliament from 1362 to 1365, and from 1376 to 1386. In 1390 his service on judicial commissions also ceased, and he was dead by 15 November 1398.<br>
<br>Skipwith was survived by five sons and one daughter. He left an estate further enlarged by marriage and purchase. By 1370 his eldest son, William, had married Catherine d'Avranches, heir to the larger parts of the Yorkshire manors of Skipwith and Menthorpe. His second son, John, married Alice, daughter of Sir Frederick Tilney of Boston, represented Lincolnshire in three parliaments, and eventually inherited the bulk of the family estate from his brother's daughter. A third son, Stephen (<i>d</i>. 1398), was rector of the church of Ingoldmells, and the youngest sons, Patrick and Thomas, were still alive in 1415, when they and their mother received bequests in the will of the judge's second daughter, Margaret, wife of Sir Henry Vavasour of Yorkshire.<br>
