<span class="headword">Hinchliff,  John Ely</span>  (1777&#150;1867), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was baptized on 29 April 1777 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, London, the son of William Hinchliff and his wife, Mary. At an early age Hinchliff was apprenticed as a mason to John Hinchliff the elder, who may have been his grandfather. In 1806 the quality of Hinchliff's carving brought him to the attention of the sculptor John Flaxman, whose chief assistant he became for the next twenty years. In January 1808 he entered the Royal Academy Schools, when his age was given as thirty.<br>
<br>During that time Hinchliff established himself as a neo-classical sculptor in the style of Flaxman. In 1814 he exhibited at the Royal Academy a group, <span class="italic">Christian and Apollyon</span>. The following year he exhibited another group, <span class="italic">Leonidas at Thermopylae</span>. These were followed over the next thirty years by six further works at the British Institution and some thirty-six groups at the Royal Academy. Of these <span class="italic">Venus and Aurora as the Morning and Evening Star</span> was described by M. H. Grant as &#145;of first rate excellence, recalling the triumphs of Flaxman&#146;  (Grant, 126).<br>
<br>After Flaxman's death in 1826, Hinchliff completed many of Flaxman's unfinished civic and imperial commissions, including the statues <span class="italic">The Marquis of Hastings</span> (Calcutta), and <span class="italic">John Philip Kemble</span> (Westminster Abbey). He also executed a few busts, including one of his former master, which he exhibited at the British Institution in 1849. Hinchliff is best-known for his monumental work. His bas-reliefs and mural tablets can be found in Chichester and Canterbury cathedrals, York Minster, and Bermondsey and Marylebone parish churches. He died on 23 November 1867, aged ninety, at his home of many years at Mornington Place, 185 Hampstead Road, London. His obituarist noted that he &#145;enjoyed the sincere regard of a large number of friends&#146;  (<span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, 48). In the 1950s M. H. Grant noted his &#145;real talent&#146; in subjects of a &#145;classical and poetical nature&#146;  (Grant, 126). But Gunnis described his &#145;neo-hellenic&#146; work as neither &#145;exacting&#146; nor &#145;very inspired&#146;  (Gunnis, 202).<br>
<br>Hinchliff's son, <a name="cosubject_13331"></a><span class="headword">John James Hinchliff</span>  (1805&#150;1875), <span class="occ">landscape engraver</span>, engraved after topographical and architectural works by T. H. Shepherd (1829&#150;31), and for J. Brittan and E. W. Brayley's <span class="italic">Devonshire and Cornwall Illustrated</span> (1832). He contributed illustrations to S. C. Hall's <span class="italic">Book of Gems</span> (1838). In 1847 he engraved a portrait of Benvenuto Cellini after Vasari for Cellini's <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> (1847). He provided illustrations to W. Beattie's <span class="italic">Castles and Abbeys of England</span> (1848) and H. Gastineau's <span class="italic">Picturesque Scenery of Wales</span> (1860), and several portraits for the 1872 edition of John Evelyn's <span class="italic">Diary and Correspondence</span>. He retired to Clifton, Bristol, and later moved to Walton by Clevedon, Somerset, where he died on 16 December 1875.<br>
