<span class="headword">Pucci,  Francesco</span>  (1543&#150;1597), <span class="occ">theological writer</span>, was born on 11 February 1543 in the via Ghibellina, Florence, the eldest son of Antonio Pucci (<i>b</i>. 1496) and Lisabetta Giambonelli (<i>d</i>. 1590). He came from the junior branch of a patrician Florentine family. He was educated in the Accademia dei Lucidi in Florence, and took minor orders. His uncle, Mariotto Giambonelli, a rich Roman jeweller, made him his heir and decided in 1564 that he should be apprenticed to a Florentine banker in Lyons. The death of his uncle in 1570 enabled Pucci to leave the bank and recommence his education, and he enrolled in 1571 as a student of theology at the University of Paris. He witnessed the massacre of St Bartholomew's day there in 1572, and this persuaded him to leave Paris and become an undergraduate at the University of Oxford. He graduated MA on 18 May 1574. His quarrelsome and enquiring disposition led him into theological difficulties at Oxford and by 1575 he had been expelled from the university. He spent two years in London, where he became a member of the Huguenot church and quarrelled with its leading figures, arguing that each individual had the authority to decide on theological matters for himself. He left England in 1576, and went by way of Paris to Basel, where he began the first of his debates with the Unitarian theologian Fausto Sozzini. Pucci developed the idea that Adam before the fall was immortal. After just over a year Pucci was expelled from Basel for publishing a provocative list of his beliefs, and he returned to London, where he is to be found by early 1579.<br>
<br>While on this second visit to London, Pucci wrote two important theological pamphlets. In the <span class="italic">Informazione della religione Christiana</span>, which was printed in London in 1580, he outlined his humanist theology, called for a general council to reunite Christendom, and launched a vigorous attack on the Roman Catholic church. The following year Pucci produced his most ambitious and fanciful work, which seems to have circulated only in manuscript, the &#145;Forma d'una republica catholica&#146;. He advocated the creation of an underground secret society uniting those of goodwill throughout Christendom to prepare the way for the hoped-for general council. He described the structure of his secret utopia: it would consist of cells or &#145;colleges&#146; each run by a provost, chancellor, and censor elected for four years by universal manhood suffrage, who would regulate the marriage, education, and morals of its members, and tax them. Discipline would also be maintained by the use of spies and informers. The colleges dispersed throughout Europe would send delegates to a central diet, which would have supreme legislative and judicial authority. The members of this &#145;republic&#146; would, until the general council had pronounced, be Nicodemites, attending the local religious services enforced by law to a sufficient degree to avoid punishment, and then at home would practise a simple religion based on those beliefs which were accepted by all Christians. In June 1582 Pucci left London for Antwerp and then in 1583 he migrated to Cracow, partly to resume his debates with Sozzini who was presently ensconced in that city. Two years later (1585) he had removed to Prague, to meet the English alchemists John Dee and Edward Kelley. Pucci's thought was already increasingly millenarian and occultist, and in Dee and Kelley he found kindred spirits. He made the mistake of lending Kelley money at a time when his own financial position was increasingly precarious since he had nearly exhausted his inheritance.<br>
<br>By 1585 Pucci was trying to arrange for a return to Florence, negotiating through Florentine and Roman channels, although the Inquisition had already taken an interest in him. He wrote penitent letters to the pope and formally abjured his heresy at Prague. However, at the same time he continued to write and distribute as widely as possible works of speculative theology which were certainly heretical. All his works were placed on the <span class="roman">Index</span> in 1592, after the publication in that year at Gouda of <span class="italic">De Christi servatoris efficacitate</span>, dedicated to the pope, in which he maintained that Christ had saved the whole of humanity. He continued to drift from European city to city until at last in 1593 at Salzburg, where he was confined to bed having broken a leg in a carriage accident, he was arrested by agents of the Roman Inquisition who took him in chains to Rome. Here he was imprisoned, stripped of his property, and forced (at the insistence of his relatives) to change his surname. He was a relapsed heretic and hence liable to suffer the supreme penalty. He was saved from the stake by a second abjuration, but was killed instead by being beheaded at the Tor di Nona prison on 5 July 1597. His remains were burnt in the campo dei Fiori.<br>
