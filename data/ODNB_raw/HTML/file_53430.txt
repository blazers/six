<span class="headword">Robertson,  James</span>  (1813/14&#150;1888), <span class="occ">engraver and photographer</span>, son of Thomas James Robertson (occupation unknown) of Middlesex, was probably born in Middlesex. No record of his early years has come to light, but he spent most of his professional career in Constantinople, as chief engraver at the imperial mint. This appointment makes plausible the belief that he was the same Robertson who exhibited four medals at the Royal Academy in London, between 1833 and 1840. While still in England, he studied under William Wyon, chief engraver at the Royal Mint in London from 1828 onwards. When, about 1840, the new sultan decided to modernize the imperial mint in Constantinople, Robertson was one of several Europeans selected for the task, and his long career at the centre of the Ottoman empire began in 1841. In Constantinople, on 19 April 1855, he married Maria Matilda Beato, the sister of Felice Beato, the man about to become his partner in a photographic business. This family connection doubtless explains the intrepid plan Robertson made for the last years of his life. Less than a fortnight after the farewell dinner given to honour him in Constantinople on his retirement from the mint, on 29 October 1881, Robertson with his wife and three daughters embarked for Japan, to rejoin Beato, who had settled in Yokohama.<br>
<br>Within Robertson's forty-year career as a medallist and engraver is a fifteen-year spell as an active photographer. He enjoyed making sketches and water-colours, and with such tastes, coupled with his professional training, it is not surprising that he took up photography. From the first he seems to have thought of it as a serious occupation, not merely a hobby, and to have sensed its potential for bringing both fame and fortune. The earliest record of his work can be found in the entry for 4 July 1853 in the diary of the earl of Carlisle who, on that day of his visit to Constantinople, had just acquired some Robertson views. The last record is of the photographic firm established by Robertson some time later in Pera, the European quarter of the city. The company was still in business during the spring of 1867, but was put up for sale in the autumn of that year. Robertson's reputation rests on his beautifully composed views of cities and landscapes throughout the Ottoman empire and the Mediterranean world.<br>
<br>Settled in Constantinople, Robertson was well positioned to earn his place in history as one of the first war photographers. During the Crimean War (1854&#150;6) he photographed British troops after their disembarkation at Scutari, but fame was established by his sobering documentary records of shattered fortifications and destroyed dockyards on the Crimean peninsula, made after the fall of Sevastopol in the autumn of 1855 and spring 1856. His images became known to contemporaries through exhibitions (such as that in London in 1856), published albums, and woodcuts based on the photographs which appeared in such journals as the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>.<br>
<br>Robertson died in Japan, probably in Yokohama, on 18 April 1888, his wife surviving him.<br>
