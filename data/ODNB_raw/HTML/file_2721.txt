<span class="headword">Blunt,  John James</span>  (1794&#150;1855), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and theological writer</span>, was born at Newcastle under Lyme, Staffordshire, in 1794 and baptized on 29 June, the son of the Revd John Blunt (1765/6&#150;1843), master of the local grammar school. No details are known of his mother. He was educated by his father, a former fellow of St John's College, Cambridge, and was admitted a pensioner there in 1812, afterwards securing a scholarship. In 1813 he became first Bell's scholar in the university and was awarded the Browne medal for a Latin ode in the year following, and members' prizes for a Latin essay in 1817 and 1818. His degrees were BA 1816 (fifteenth wrangler), MA 1819, and BD 1826. St John's elected him to a fellowship in 1816, which he held for twenty years until his marriage. Having been awarded a Worts travelling bachelorship in 1818 Blunt visited Italy and Sicily; since he was required to write an account in Latin to the vice-chancellor of foreign customs and rarities he was fortunate to meet a peasant who related to him anecdotes of Napoleon at the battle of Waterloo. This expedition and further tours in 1820&#150;21 provided materials for <span class="italic">Vestiges of Ancient Manners and Customs Discoverable in Modern Italy and Sicily</span> (1823), which was translated into German but was not republished.<br>
<br>After his ordination Blunt obtained the curacy at Hodnet in Shropshire under Reginald Heber, and after Heber's appointment to the bishopric of Calcutta in 1822 he remained there for some years under his successor. He later held the curacy of Chetwynd in Shropshire. During these years of parish work he began to write long miscellaneous review articles for the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> on Heber, Paley, Parr, Milton, Gibbon, and other subjects. He is said to have known Butler's <span class="italic">Analogy</span> and <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span> almost by heart. Academic scholarship was not neglected; he gave the Hulsean lectures at Cambridge in 1831 and 1832, which were published. He held Great Oakley, a rich college living in Essex, between 1834 and 1839, where he rebuilt the parsonage and established the parish school. At Barlaston, Staffordshire, on 14 June 1836, he married Elizabeth Roylance Child, youngest daughter of Baddeley Child of that place; they had two daughters before his wife's early death on 12 April 1841. On 13 January 1852 at Uttoxeter, he married Harriet (1810&#150;1889), second daughter of Thomas Sneyd-Kynnersley of Loxley Park, Staffordshire; they had no children. On 9 May 1839 Blunt was elected to the Lady Margaret chair of divinity at Cambridge and worked conscientiously in that post. Lord Aberdeen, who preferred moderate, uncontroversial churchmen in the House of Lords, offered more than once to appoint him bishop of Salisbury in 1854 but he declined. Joseph Romilly, the university registrary, commented &#145;Blunt is now looked on as a prodigy by all Clergymen: he is not 60, but considers himself too old for a Bishop&#146;. In truth Blunt's health had begun to fail, and he died of erysipelas at Cambridge on 17 June 1855. He was buried with his first wife at Barlaston on 23 June.<br>
<br>Blunt's publications were successful and widely read for a generation. His most popular book, <span class="italic">A Sketch of the Reformation in England</span> (1832), went through many editions and was translated into French and German; it was followed in 1837 by <span class="italic">A Sketch of the Church of the First Two Centuries after Christ</span>, which like much of his work was revised from material originally given in sermons or lectures. His principal series of books on related themes was at the same time old-fashioned and novel, an attempt to widen the application of William Paley's interpretation of scripture on the basis of &#145;undesigned coincidences&#146;. It underlay his <span class="italic">Veracity of the Gospels and Acts of the Apostles</span> (1828) and works with a similar theme on the <span class="roman">Pentateuch</span> and other <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> scripture. They were brought together and revised as <span class="italic">Undesigned Coincidences</span> in 1847, which reached a sixth edition in 1859 but did not survive the new biblical criticism that was then in the ascendant. For Blunt, &#145;the truth of Christianity depends upon the truth of its leading facts&#146;  (<span class="italic">Essays Contributed to the &#145;Quarterly Review&#146;</span>, 1860, 147). His Cambridge lectures on the early fathers appeared in 1840 and 1843, and were reprinted together soon after his death, as were other unpublished lectures, <span class="italic">On the Right Use of the Early Fathers</span> (1857) and <span class="italic">A History of the Christian Church during the First Three Centuries</span> (1856). His pieces in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> were collected in one volume in 1860.<br>
<br>As early as 1832 Blunt had published on the role and duties of the Anglican clergy and this subject was considered in <span class="italic">Acquirements and Principal Obligations and Duties of the Parish Priest</span> (1856), which was based on his Cambridge lectures. Although he could draw on wide experience for this work it soon became obsolete, not simply because of its donnish tone but because the book presupposed a readership of university-educated country clergy (it recommended extensive reading for the preparation of sermons), whose parishioners were mostly agricultural workers: the industrial revolution and problems of the church in large cities might not have existed. Yet the Cambridge authorities during Blunt's time as professor were more aware than before of the need for a formalized training of the Anglican clergy, and (although he disliked the compulsory element enforced towards the end of his life) his teaching was well thought of. His schedule of lectures from 1840 appears in <span class="italic">Two Introductory Lectures</span> (1856 edn, xiii&#150;xiv). An obituarist wrote that &#145;It was by his lectures that he was principally known; and by their means the influence of a sound judgment and reasonable allegiance to the Church of England were spread through the land&#146;  (<span class="italic">Clerical Journal</span>). At second-hand Blunt's influence was carried through the empire. A moderate high-churchman, he eschewed overt theological controversy and, while his studies of the early church did not lead him to adopt Tractarian views, nor did they bring him to understate the place of tradition in its usages. Yet his writings and teachings were essentially polemical, since they expressed a conviction that the English church of the Reformation was consonant with early Christianity and that the contemporary church should seek to emulate both. In academic life he was conservative and voted against attempts to admit dissenters to Cambridge degrees. Writing in 1854 E. H. Browne detected a falling off in Blunt's influence, &#145;perhaps that he is older &hellip; but more it may be, because he is not quite up the age. The theology of the day is not the theology of fifteen years ago&#146;  (Kitchin, 228&#150;9).<br>
