<span class="headword">Clement,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1572), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was probably a native of Yorkshire. He was educated at John Colet's newly established St Paul's School under William Lily, and possibly for a time at Oxford. He made an early acquaintance of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19191/', "Sir Thomas More")</script>, who took him into his family, made him tutor to his children, and treated him with great kindness. He accompanied More on his Flanders embassy of 1515 and appears in the discussion that introduces <span class="italic">Utopia</span>:<blockquote>John Clement, my pupil-servant, was also present at the conversation. Indeed, I do not allow him to absent himself from any talk which can be somewhat profitable, for from this young plant, seeing that it has begun to put forth green shoots in Greek and Latin literature, I expect no mean harvest some day. (More, <span class="italic">Utopia</span>, 41)</blockquote>In April 1518 Clement passed into the service of Cardinal Wolsey. On learning of this, Erasmus, whom he had met while in More's household, sent him a warning not to overwork, and not to write at night if he could; if he must, he must learn to do so standing up  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 5.392). He did not remain with the cardinal in person, but was sent to Oxford, where he settled at Corpus Christi College as reader in rhetoric and humanity, a post Wolsey had just created. Michaelmas 1518 saw Clement lecturing, a proud More informed Erasmus, &#145;to a larger audience than anyone has ever had before; it is remarkable how popular he is&#146;, even impressing Thomas Linacre with his learning  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 5.215). In 1519, however, Clement devoted himself to medicine. He travelled to Louvain in Brabant for further study, and then made his way to Italy, visiting Erasmus at Basel <i>en route</i>. Clement stayed in Italy for several years, graduating MD on 30 March 1525 at Siena. About this time he assisted in the editing of the Aldine Greek edition of Galen's works, printed at Venice in 1525&#150;6. Among his colleagues in that project was Thomas Lupset, who had been his successor at Oxford.<br>
<br>Clement returned to England in 1525 and moved into More's old house, The Barge, in Bucklersbury, London. That year he obtained the minor court title of sewer of the chamber. In 1526 he married Margaret Giggs (1508&#150;1570) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5604/', "Clement, Margaret")</script>], More's adopted daughter whom he had taught while tutor to the family. By 1528 he was receiving regular half-yearly payments of &pound;10 from the court as a &#145;phisicion&#146;; and he was one of the physicians sent by Henry VIII to Wolsey when the cardinal lay languishing at Esher in 1529. On 1 February 1528 Clement was admitted a member of the London College of Physicians. On 16 April following he became an elect, and was consiliarius from 1529 to 1531 and in 1547.<br>
<br>Clement was imprisoned with More in the Tower of London in 1535 for refusing to take the oath of supremacy. Margaret, his wife, was a devout Catholic who secretly took food to the priors of the Charterhouse when they were chained in the Tower for the same reason. When More was executed she was the only one of his household to attend the execution and it was she who retrieved the headless corpse for burial. Clement was released after a while and his fortunes seem to have suffered no long-term harm. His royal payments as physician continued until 1540, and in 1544 he was elected president of the College of Physicians.<br>
<br>Under Edward VI, Clement was less fortunate. In July 1549 he fled abroad to Louvain, where he was joined in October by his wife, and in December by his daughter Winifred (<i>b</i>. 1527) and her husband William Rastell, More's nephew. He remained in the colony of English religious exiles supported by Antonio Bonvisi in Louvain until 19 March 1554, when he returned to England. During Mary's reign he practised at Marshfoot in Essex, but by 1560, soon after Elizabeth's accession, he again left the country.<br>
<br>Clement and his family next lived for a time at Bergen, before moving to Mechelen where he became one of the English colony's most important members. He died at his house in Blockstraate in St John's parish, Louvain, on 1 July 1572, and was buried the next day near the high altar of the cathedral church of St Rumbold, close to his wife, who had died on 6 July 1570. In addition to Winifred, Clement had a son, Thomas, who was a godson of More, and several other daughters, including Dorothy, who became a Poor Clare in 1571 at Louvain, and Margaret, who entered St Ursula's convent there.<br>
<br>Clement was not a prolific writer, but he did translate several religious works from Greek into Latin, including &#145;The epistles of Gregory Nazianzen&#146;, &#145;The homilies of Nicephorus Calixtus concerning the Greek saints&#146;, and &#145;The epistles of Pope Celestine I to Cyril, bishop of Alexandria&#146;. In this work he was assisted by Margaret, his wife. Clement also owned an important library of Greek and Latin manuscripts.<br>
