<span class="headword">Black,  Patrick</span>  (1813&#150;1879), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born in Aberdeen on 22 August 1813, the second son of Lieutenant-Colonel Patrick Black (<i>d</i>. 1819/20), of the Bengal army, and his wife, Jane Young. Black, like his father, was named after his ancestor Sir Patrick Dun, a former president of the King and Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland. Black's father died when he was only six years old, and after an early education in Aberdeenshire the family moved to London, in 1825, where Black went to Mr Roberts's school at Chelsea. Black attended Eton College between 1828 and 1830, and his subsequent failure at his first attempt to gain entry to Christ Church, Oxford, encouraged him to work harder, so that he spent six months in Paris studying anatomy, toxicology, and medical jurisprudence before matriculating from Christ Church on 10 November 1831. He graduated BA in 1835 and began his medical studies at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London. He graduated BM (1838) and DM (1844) from Oxford. He was elected assistant physician to St Bartholomew's Hospital in 1842, and became warden of the medical school (1851&#150;6), physician to the hospital in 1860, and lecturer on medical jurisprudence (1855&#150;61) and on medicine (1861&#150;78). He was elected fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1845 and was later its censor.<br>
<br>During the cholera outbreak in London in 1854 Black took charge of the cholera wards at St Bartholomew's Hospital. In 1855 he delivered the Croonian lectures at the Royal College of Physicians, on the forces of the circulation. Black was appointed examiner for the Oxford medical degree in 1874, and he also held positions as physician to Christ's Hospital, the Marine Society, the Royal Naval Hospital on the <i>Dreadnought</i>, and was a director of the Clerical, Medical and General Life Assurance Company.<br>
<br>The most significant part of Black's association with St Bartholomew's was his appointment as its first administrator of chloroform from 1852 to 1856. During this period he published <span class="italic">Chloroform; how Shall we Ensure Safety in its Administration?</span> (1855), which examines the exact source of danger in the administration of chloroform. In this pamphlet he expresses indebtedness to the writings of John Snow but differs in his interpretation of the cause of death from chloroform. Snow argued that death followed the paralysis of the heart after chloroform had been inhaled in too concentrated a form; Black believed it to be due to asphyxia&#151;the chloroform being too pungent to be breathed in the first moments of administration&#151;and referred to numerous fatal cases in support of his theory. He had presented these views in a paper read to the Abernethian Society in 1854, of which he was president for several years. Debates surrounding the probable cause of chloroform fatalities were intense during this period, and Black's pamphlet represents some of the then commonly held views.<br>
<br>Black was a tall and handsome man, and was respected and loved by his family and many friends. He married in November 1843 Julia Louisa Mark, daughter of William Mark, HM counsel at Malaga, and their marriage was noted by his friends to be a happy and fulfilling one, even though the couple sadly lost two sons within the space of two years&#151;one from a wasting disease and the second in the <i>Eurydice</i> disaster. Black was a careful observer, a just reasoner, well read in medicine and literature, and a physician who, as one of his patients remarked, hastened no one into the grave; yet he never attained a large medical practice. His contemporaries suggested that the reason for this was his strong scepticism of the value of therapeutics and a lack of interest in the new methods of physical examination and clinical enquiry. His practice of medicine was more akin to the traditions of the late eighteenth century, rather than the rapidly developing medicine of the 1860s and 1870s. As a result he questioned such practices as the value of quinine as a remedy for malaria and the use of lime juice in the treatment of scurvy. It was a trait which prevented him from totally fulfilling his promise. Another reason may have been the fact that &#145;he was a man of considerable property&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Nevertheless, he was sound in his judgement of character, firm in his friendship, and universal in his kindness.<br>
<br>In spite of a talent for original and lucid writing Black wrote little. He revised the Latin part of the <span class="italic">Nomenclature of Diseases</span> (1867) for the Royal College of Physicians, and his writings included <span class="italic">An Address to Students</span> (1852), <span class="italic">Respiration, or, Why do we Breathe?</span> (1876), <span class="italic">Scurvy in high latitudes; an attempt to explain the cause of the &#145;medical failure&#146; of the Arctic expedition of 1875&#150;6</span> (1876), and <span class="italic">An essay of the use of the spleen with an episode of the spleen's marriage; a physiological love-story</span> (1876).<br>
<br>On 12 October 1879, after several months of illness during which he had gained pain relief from morphia, Black died from pancreatic cancer at his home, 11 Queen Anne Street, Cavendish Square, London, leaving an estate valued at under &pound;60,000. His personal appearance, character, and manner of teaching were recorded in a Latin poem dedicated to him in 1876 by Robert Bridges (1844&#150;1930), a former house physician and later poet laureate. It was a lasting mark of esteem from one of his many friends. He was survived by his wife.<br>
