<span class="headword">Hunton,  Louis <span class="st"> [Lewis]</span></span>  (<em>bap. </em>1814, <em>d.</em> 1838), <span class="occ">geologist and chemist</span>, was born at Hummersea House, Loftus, North Riding of Yorkshire, and baptized on 6 August 1814. He was the son of William Hunton (1789&#150;1863), manager of the local alum works and ship-owner, and Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> March (1791&#150;1878). Little is known of his earliest years but he was probably educated at the school provided for children at the alum works by Lord Dundas. In 1832 Hunton entered King's College, London. He is said to have spent two years at King's, during the period when Charles Lyell and John Phillips were teaching geology there. However, he is recorded only as an occasional student of German language and literature. In 1835 Hunton went, for one year, to University College, London, where he attended courses on comparative anatomy, fossil zoology (both taught by Robert Grant), and natural philosophy.<br>
<br>On 25 May 1836 Hunton's only geological paper was communicated to the Geological Society of London by J. F. Royle (1799&#150;1858) of King's College. Published the following year, it recorded the results Hunton had obtained from detailed study of the Upper Lias and Marlstone strata exposed at Rockcliff, to the east of his father's Loftus works on the Yorkshire coast. Nearly one hundred years later, this paper was described as &#145;a truly remarkable document&#146; showing &#145;remarkable qualities&#146;  (Arkell). Hunton was the first to urge that accurate information about the distributions of fossils in rocks could only come from the study of samples taken from material still <i>in situ</i> within the beds in question; loose materials accumulated at the foot of cliffs should never be used. When <i>in situ</i> materials were used, they demonstrated how certain species, especially ammonites, showed much more limited vertical distributions through rocks than had previously been realized. Such discoveries greatly helped the more accurate discrimination of both strata and time in the geology of the next decade. Hunton's geological paper brought him election as a fellow of the Geological Society in November 1836; he was proposed by Robert Grant. The same year he discovered a fine 5 metre long ichthyosaur, which was presented to the Whitby Museum in 1867.<br>
<br>Hunton's only other published scientific work appeared in the <span class="italic">London and Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine</span> in 1837. The paper, on his other interest, chemistry, discussed combinations of sugar (of interest to any alum maker) with alkalis and metallic oxides. By this time, however, Hunton was ill with consumption and had had to abandon further scientific research. He travelled to N&icirc;mes in the south of France hoping his health would recover. It did not and on 18 February 1838 he died at rue des Lombards 12, N&icirc;mes, aged twenty-three. He was posthumously remembered by an ammonite named after him by Martin Simpson in 1843.<br>
