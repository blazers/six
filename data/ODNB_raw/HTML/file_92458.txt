<span class="headword">Perlin,  &Eacute;tienne</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1553&#150;1558), <span class="occ">writer and traveller</span>, is known largely through his observations of Britain in <span class="italic">Description des royaulmes d'Angleterre et d'Escosse</span>, a brief journal of his travels in those two countries, which he visited in 1553. He claimed to have prominent acquaintances at the French court, stating that he was presented to Henri II by Anne de Montmorency, constable of France, at the Tournelles, and received from the king the promise of a benefice; this encouraged him to continue his studies, though he still appeared to be waiting for his benefice at the time of the <span class="italic">Description</span>. He is styled &#145;Ma&icirc;tre&#146; in its preface, and the <i>extrait du privil&egrave;ge</i> from the original 1558 Paris edition of the book describes him as studying in the medical faculty at the University of Paris. The <span class="italic">Description</span> is dedicated to Marguerite de France, then duchesse de Berry, the daughter of Fran&ccedil;ois I and sister of Henri II, and Perlin explains he wished to honour her thus in acknowledgement of her reputation as a &#145;lover of letters&#146;  (<span class="italic">Description</span>, 4).<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Description</span> was in fact Perlin's second major work to be dedicated to a member of the French royal family; in its preface he mentions another publication, also produced in 1558, a Latin work of his entitled <span class="italic">De variis morborum generibus opusculum</span>. This book, which Perlin describes as &#145;treating of the human body and of many sorts of maladies&#146; was presented to Henri II by Perlin, and approved for printing by the king himself, to whom Perlin then dedicated it, describing himself as partly moved to write it by the ravages of disease in England. A well-organized but essentially conventional treatise, intended for the instruction of students and beginners, <span class="italic">De variis</span> depends very heavily on standard authorities, especially Galen and Hippocrates, though it also cites three times a mysterious &#145;Tuxiganus&#146;, described as Henry VIII's doctor. At the end of the <span class="italic">Description</span>, Perlin announces his plans for a future work on &#145;cosmography, and short description of all the world and the divisions thereof&#146; as an aid to the understanding of geometry and future needs for military fortification, but there is no evidence that the volume ever appeared  (<span class="italic">Antiquarian Repertory</span>, 520).<br>
<br>Despite his social aspirations, Perlin remains a shadowy figure, and what little can be said of his personality emerges primarily through the pungent and sometimes amusing commentary contained in his <span class="italic">Description</span>. It was published in an English translation in 1775, and a review in the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> of January&#150;June 1776 observed that the work provided interesting observations, from a fresh perspective, on events during the transition from the reign of Edward VI to that of Mary, when Perlin was in Britain, including descriptions of Edward's death and the attempted usurpation by Jane Grey, Mary's entry into London, and the duke of Northumberland's execution&#151;the last two he described as an eyewitness. He may have shown his cosmographical interests in the way he places England geographically, setting it among its surrounding seas and estimating its size. In many ways he admired the country, praising its beauty, riches, and abundant resources; he pronounces London &#145;one of the most beautiful, largest and richest places in the whole world&#146; after Paris, praises the women as great beauties, and records the conditions as generally prosperous. Fish he notes as especially cheap. But though he comments on their love of music, Perlin also condemns the English, as &#145;neither valiant in war, nor faithful in peace&#146;, and the &#145;common people&#146; as seditious and fickle  (Beeverell, <span class="italic">Pleasures</span>, 58, 60, 61). He expresses outrage that Edward VI should style himself king of France, and continually compares England with France to the former's detriment, deriding the English fondness for drink, condemning their intolerance of the French, and despising them as vain, ambitious, and neglectful of learning in favour of making money.<br>
<br>Perlin's text alternates between potentially useful social observation, for instance in comparisons of the coinage and of the prices of goods in England and France, and lectures on the superiority of French political and social systems over English ones. The frequency with which noblemen were executed in England, he observes, has no parallel in France. His perceptions of Scotland focus particularly on that country's usefulness as a means of attacking the English, and he claims that France could conquer England easily by using Scotland for access. Perlin's <span class="italic">Description</span> is not only valuable as a source for the minor details of mid-sixteenth-century life in England and Scotland; it also adds another, and a different, voice to those describing the great events taking place in Britain at that time.<br>
