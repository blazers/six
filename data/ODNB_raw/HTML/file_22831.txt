<span class="headword">Proby,  John</span>, first Baron Carysfort  (1720&#150;1772), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 25 November 1720 in Stamford, Lincolnshire, the eldest son of the six children of John Proby (<i>d</i>. 1762), politician, of Elton Hall, Huntingdonshire, and his wife, the Hon. Jane Leveson-Gower (<i>d</i>. 1726), the younger daughter of John Leveson-Gower, first Baron Gower. He was educated at Westminster School in 1736 and the following year entered Jesus College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1741 and MA in 1742. At the general election in June 1747 he was returned on the Sandwich interest to the House of Commons for Stamford. He married, on 27 August 1750, the Hon. Elizabeth Allen (<i>bap</i>. 1722, <i>d</i>. 1783), the elder daughter and coheir of Joshua, second Viscount Allen, and his wife, Margaret Du Pass; they had two children. On 23 January 1752 he was created Baron Carysfort of Carysfort in the county of Wicklow, in the Irish peerage.<br>
<br>In May 1754 Carysfort was elected MP for Huntingdonshire, and he continued to represent that county until the dissolution in March 1768. He was also the grand master of freemasons from 1752 to 1754. He took his seat in the Irish House of Lords on 7 October 1755 and was subsequently admitted to the Irish privy council. He was one of the lords of the Admiralty from April to July 1757. In 1758 he was chosen chairman of the two select committees appointed to inquire into the laws relating to the standards of weights and measures. He was invested a knight of the Bath on 23 March 1761, and was installed on 26 May following. He moved the address in the House of Commons at the opening in November 1762, and on 1 January 1763 was reappointed a lord of the Admiralty, a post which he resigned in August 1765.<br>
<br>Carysfort's final years were tainted by rumours of debts and sexual philandering. It was reported that he had wasted an &#145;enormous expense in kept women&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mrs Montagu</span>, 1.150). He died at Lille, France, on 18 October 1772, aged fifty-one, and was buried at Elton, Huntingdonshire. His widow died in March 1783. They were survived by both their children: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22832/', "John Joshua Proby (1751&#150;1828)")</script> also pursued a political career and was created earl of Carysfort in August 1789; and Elizabeth (1752&#150;1808) married Thomas James Storer (<i>d</i>. 1792).<br>
