<span class="headword">Simpson,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1584), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, is first recorded by John Foxe as one of the lay deacons of the secret protestant congregation of London during the reign of Mary I. On one occasion spies were waiting for the congregation near Aldgate, &#145;and had not Thomas Simpson the deacon espied them, and bid themselves disperse themselves away, they had been taken&#146;  (<span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>, 8.558). Foxe also states that Augustine Bernher and Simpson visited the deacon Cuthbert Symson on the night before his martyrdom in March 1558. That Thomas and Cuthbert were brothers, or at least closely related, thus seems highly probable.<br>
<br>What Foxe does not disclose is that, probably in November 1557, Thomas Simpson had been ordained priest in the redundant church of St Mary Axe by the congregation's &#145;superintendent and <i>presbyterium</i>&#146;. The four &#145;witnesses&#146; were three ordained clergy&#151;William Lyving, Augustine Bernher, and Robert Cole&#151;and Avery Brierton, a merchant tailor of the parish of St Martin Vintry. When Simpson subscribed the oath of supremacy in August 1559 he did so as &#145;minister in Honey Lane&#146;  (Carte antique et miscellanee, XIII/2/57, fol. 2). He was presumably serving as curate in the parish of All Hallows.<br>
<br>Simpson's clandestine ordination was accepted as valid by Edmund Grindal who, in one of his earliest acts as bishop of London, collated him to the vicarage of Brightlingsea, near Colchester, on the Essex coast, on 4 January 1560. Avery Brierton stood surety at the exchequer for Simpson's first fruits along with another member of the former London congregation, Thomas Gee, whose widow later married John Sterne, suffragan bishop of Colchester.<br>
<br>On 12 November 1562 Grindal issued Simpson with letters testimonial rehearsing the circumstances of his ordination &#145;five years since&#146;, and retrospectively ratifying and confirming it. It is implied, though not definitely stated, that it was justified by &#145;a time of persecution&#146;. It is the only known example of English orders at this time which did not involve the laying on of consecrated hands.<br>
<br>On 2 July 1569 Grindal further collated Simpson to the city rectory of St Botolph without Bishopsgate. He held both his livings until his death, without ever apparently becoming involved in nonconformist activities in the city or in Colchester. The preamble to his will nevertheless trusts that he will &#145;inherit the kingdom of Glory among the Saints&#146;  (will, fol. 324<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Simpson made his will as a widower, probably in January 1584. Nothing is known of his wife. After monetary bequests to the poor of both his parishes, he left a private house to his son, William, a minor, and his sixth share in a boat. The rest of his goods and possessions were divided between his other sons, Thomas, John, and Josias, who were all apparently of age. His daughters, Martha, Hester, Anne, and Mary, were left monetary bequests totalling &pound;120 and were to inherit at nineteen or marriage. He probably died in May 1584. Thomas and John, named joint executors, were granted probate on 3 June, the day on which Thomas was collated to Brightlingsea as his father's successor in the vicarage.<br>
