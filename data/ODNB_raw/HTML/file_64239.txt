<span class="headword">Carline family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1870&#150;<em>c.</em>1975), <span class="occ">painters</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_64264"></a><span class="headword">George Francis Carline</span>  (1855&#150;1920)<span class="occ"></span>, born on 11 July 1855 in Lincoln, the son of Richard Carline (1806&#150;1863) and Jane Frances Snow (1814&#150;1861). His father was a solicitor and three times elected mayor of Lincoln, but he numbered several painters, sculptors, and architects among his forebears. His own training as a painter began in Lincoln School of Art in the early 1870s and was pursued at Heatherley's Art School in London (1882), then in Antwerp, and finally at the Acad&eacute;mie Julian in Paris. On his return to London in 1885 he established a studio in Fulham and exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy after scoring a critical and popular success in 1886 with <span class="italic">Spelling out the List</span> (1885; priv. coll.). In 1885, while executing a portrait commission in Essex, he met and married <a href="#cosubject_73991">Annie Smith [<i>see below</i>]</a>. The couple and their growing family (they were to have five children, of whom the three youngest also trained as painters) remained in London until 1892, when they moved to Oxford. Except for several years in Switzerland (1898&#150;9) and Derbyshire (1899&#150;1903), they remained there until 1916, when they settled definitively in Hampstead.<br>
<br>From 1903 onwards George Carline was an active member of the Royal Society of British Artists. He specialized in landscapes and in charming, somewhat sentimental genre scenes featuring women and children, but he made his living mainly through portraiture and sporadic work as an illustrator and designer of advertisements (among others, for Pears soap). Although his most characteristic work in both oils and watercolours is meticulously executed and stamped with the Victorian taste of his generation, he was no die-hard conservative: there is evidence of his appreciation of impressionism and the peasant paintings of Jules Bastien-Lepage, who exerted a considerable influence on progressive British artists towards the end of the nineteenth century, and towards the end of his life he even experimented occasionally with novel materials and an abstracted style. This inquisitive attitude to vanguard developments was inherited by his children although they, like him, ultimately rejected stylistic innovation in favour of a traditional, naturalistic approach.<br>
<br>George Carline's marriage is further evidence of the unconventional streak in his character. Born in Buckhurst Hill, Essex, on 15 October 1862, <a name="cosubject_73991"></a><span class="headword">Annie Carline <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Smith]</span></span>  (1862&#150;1945)<span class="occ"></span> never knew her father, John Smith, or her mother. She was adopted by a relative and was employed as a housemaid when George Carline met her. She was a forceful personality, and her matriarchal role became more pronounced after his sudden death on 28 November 1920 in Assisi, during a prolonged family painting expedition to Italy. (His ashes were buried in Sunningwell, near Abingdon, on 14 December 1920.) Thus Annie Carline is the hub of the composition of Richard Carline's ambitious group portrait of family members and artist-friends, <span class="italic">Gathering on the Terrace</span> (1925; Ferens Art Gallery, Kingston upon Hull), and the subject of some compelling individual portraits by her children, notably Hilda Carline's brooding <span class="italic">Portrait of the Artist's Mother</span> (1930; priv. coll.). In 1927 she took up painting in watercolour herself and proved to have an innate talent. Her sharply observed landscapes and figure scenes delighted the artists who foregathered in the Carlines' home, and she was persuaded to exhibit them publicly, mainly with the London Group and the Artists' International Association. The cult of na&iuml;ve painting was at a height in the 1930s and in 1939, on the initiative of the cubist painter and theorist Andr&eacute; Lhote, she held an exhibition at the Galerie Pittoresque in Paris. Until her death on 20 October 1945 she was still active as a painter. She was buried in Sunningwell cemetery.<br>
<br>The Carlines were indefatigable, knowledgeable, and adventurous sightseers: annual painting holidays both in the English countryside and abroad were a fixed family tradition, which Richard and Nancy Carline kept up into the 1970s. Sometimes they were joined by painter-friends, as when Stanley Spencer accompanied them to Bosnia in 1922. In this manner bonds were reinforced, and so was the family commitment to painting and drawing on the spot. The family houses in Hampstead (first at 47 Downshire Hill, and from 1936 onwards at 17 Pond Street) reflected these practices: every available wall, kitchen included, was densely hung with paintings of all periods by all the members of the family and their friends, as well as with numerous artefacts from different cultures collected on their travels abroad. A &#145;museum&#146; of curiosities was installed in the basement. In this stimulating (but never luxurious or chic) setting, the Carlines and their friends met to discuss art, religion, and politics, for discussion was another fixture of their daily lives. In the 1920s and 1930s the Carline family home in Hampstead became a noted meeting place for artists, writers, and intellectuals of independent and radical tendencies, to the extent that the Carlines themselves tend to be remembered for their relationships with more prominent artists, such as Stanley Spencer, William Roberts, and Charles Ginner, rather than for their own achievements.<br>
<br>In 1898 George Carline had suffered severe financial losses through a disastrous speculation, and he at first tried to dissuade his son <a name="cosubject_64239"></a><span class="headword">Sydney William Carline</span>  (1888&#150;1929)<span class="occ"></span>, born in London on 14 August 1888, from taking up the precarious career of painting. (Later, by contrast, he did everything to foster the precocious talent of his youngest child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30899/', "Richard Cotton Carline (1896&#150;1980)")</script>, born on 9 February 1896 at 72 Woodstock Road, Oxford.) Not to be deflected, in 1908 Sydney began his training at the Slade School of Fine Art under Henry Tonks, financing himself through commissions for portrait medallions and illustrations. (In the First World War he received several official commissions for commemorative medals.) At the Slade he met Christopher Nevinson, Edward Wadsworth, Mark Gertler, and Stanley Spencer, among others, and in 1912 he joined Nevinson in Paris. This was to be a crucial awakening as, in the wake of Roger Fry's pioneering exhibitions of 1910 and 1912, he discovered the work of the post-impressionists, fauves, and cubists. Tonks was notorious for implacably opposing modernism, and Sydney reacted against the strict training in draughtsmanship for which the Slade was renowned. He enrolled at the private academy in Paris run by the eccentric symbolist painter Percyval Tudor-Hart, who advocated reliance on memory and an abstract, harmonic system for using colour and tone which had some affinity with the theories of Wassily Kandinsky. On Sydney's urging, Richard Carline abandoned plans to study at the Slade and joined him in Paris at the start of 1913. When Tudor-Hart transferred his school to Hampstead that October, they followed him there, and were joined by their sister, <a name="cosubject_64263"></a><span class="headword">Hilda Anne Carline</span>  (1889&#150;1950)<span class="occ"></span>. Born in London on 20 November 1889, Hilda Carline had hitherto painted under her father's guidance in Oxford and seems to have been more responsive than her brothers to Tudor-Hart's mystical tendencies. But all three, working and living together, strove to make their painting more expressive, bold, abstract, and &#145;primitive&#146; in appearance, and more like the avant-garde continental art to which their mentor had introduced them. Richard Carline recalled that &#145;We were a very united family and discussed our artistic problems endlessly&#146;  (<span class="italic">Richard Carline: Early Drawings and Watercolours</span>, exhibition catalogue, Anthony d'Offay Gallery, London, 1975, no pagination). A typical product of this period is Sydney Carline's primitivist memory painting <span class="italic">Bank Holiday on Hampstead Heath</span> (1915; Tate collection), but the sense of shared goals also emerges in the searching and candid portraits they painted of themselves and each other after the war (for example, Richard Carline's <span class="italic">Hilda with a Red Nose</span>, 1918, and Hilda Carline's <span class="italic">Self-Portrait</span>, 1923; both Tate collection).<br>
<br>Following the outbreak of war, Sydney Carline joined the Royal Flying Corps and received his commission as a pilot in 1916. Through Nevinson, he had come into contact with Futurist theory and was thrilled by the novel experience of flying and the transformation of the landscape when viewed from the cockpit. Richard Carline also joined the corps towards the end of the war, and in 1919 they were posted to the Middle East as official war artists. They made sketches from the air of the battlefields in Palestine, Mesopotamia, Syria, and Persia in preparation for a series of oil paintings for the newly founded Imperial War Museum in London (where the paintings and the majority of studies remain). They returned to England with numerous topographical watercolours of ancient temples, palaces, and ruins, and scenes of native life, which in their restraint, objectivity, and simplification of form reflect the muted style of modernism favoured in England after the war which is detectable in the contemporary work of the Bloomsbury painters. In March 1920 they held a joint exhibition of these works at the Goupil Gallery, London, and they exhibited again together in 1926 at the Bankfield Museum, Halifax. By that stage both were teaching in Oxford at the Ruskin School of Drawing, where Sydney had been appointed drawing master in 1922. Sydney Carline's sudden death from pneumonia in Drayton St Leonard, near Dorchester, Oxfordshire, on 15 February 1929, less than a year after his marriage on 12 April 1928 to Gwendolen Harter (1904&#150;1980), occurred only weeks after his first one-man exhibition at the Goupil Gallery. He was buried in Drayton St Leonard on 18 February 1929. On 13 June 1950 Richard Carline married, in Hampstead, Nancy Mona Carline, formerly Higgins (1909&#150;2004), also a painter. He died in Hampstead on 18 November 1980, and was buried in Sunningwell cemetery, Oxfordshire.<br>
<br>During the war Hilda Carline was in the Women's Land Army and from 1916 to 1918 worked on a farm in Suffolk. This experience nourished her romantic identification with landscape and was commemorated in the nostalgic and Gauguinesque composition <span class="italic">Return from the Farm</span> (1919; priv. coll.). Determined to develop her technical skills, she embarked on five years of part-time study at the Slade, where constant work from the figure resulted in a more draughtsmanlike and realistic style. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36211/', "Stanley Spencer (1891&#150;1959)")</script>, to whom she was introduced in December 1919, was impressed by her talent and intrigued by her striking looks and moody, imaginative, deeply religious personality&#151;like her mother she was an ardent Christian Scientist&#151;and on 23 February 1925 they were married. The years preceding her marriage were particularly productive: she benefited from the intellectual stimulus and challenge provided by the &#145;<i>cercle pan-artistique</i> of Downshire Hill&#146;, as the gatherings at the Carlines' home were dubbed by Henry Lamb  (letter to Richard Carline, 1923, <span class="italic">The Spencers and the Carlines</span>, no pagination), and like her brothers she exhibited regularly with the London Group. Although influenced by Spencer's fascination with material textures and sympathetic to his visionary interpretation of outwardly banal subjects, she never imitated his stylistic mannerisms and remained a more objective observer, as in her meticulous and candid portrait of their housekeeper, <span class="italic">Elsie</span> (1929; Brighton and Hove Museum).<br>
<br>Like many women of her generation, Hilda Carline experienced a draining conflict between her desire to paint and her domestic obligations (her daughters, Shirin and Unity, were born in 1925 and 1930 respectively), and painting became a relatively rare activity in the late 1920s. Proximity to an artist of such idiosyncratic vision, unassailable conviction, egocentricity, and brilliance as Spencer appears to have crushed her self-confidence, and some of her best later work was done after they began to lead largely separate lives in 1932. The marriage never ran smoothly, for both were uncompromising and argumentative; it ended in divorce in May 1937. Prone throughout her life to depression, she suffered a nervous breakdown in 1942, and in 1947 the breast cancer which ultimately killed her was diagnosed. She died in Hampstead on 1 November 1950, and was buried in Cookham, Berkshire. Spencer's obsession with her seems, if anything, to have increased after their divorce, and especially after her breakdown, and she inspired an unending flow of paintings and letters which ceased only with his death in 1959. Her achievement as a painter, rather than as his muse, is being re-evaluated, and in 1999 she was the subject of an important study and touring exhibition. Works by the Carlines are held in various public collections in Great Britain, including the Tate collection and Imperial War Museum, London, and the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, and in many private collections.<br>
