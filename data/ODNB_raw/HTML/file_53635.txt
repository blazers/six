<span class="headword">London,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1428), <span class="occ">Benedictine monk and recluse</span>, entered Westminster Abbey in 1377&#150;8 and said his first mass in 1379. The toponym may indicate his place of origin; his family is unknown. As keeper of the shrine of St Edward the Confessor, an office which he held as a junior monk, he was thrown into contact with pilgrims and sightseers. As the second of the two treasurers of Eleanor of Castile's manors in 1388&#150;90 and 1391&#150;3, he acquired experience of moneybags and the care of property, but without carrying the weight of responsibility falling on his senior colleague. A potentially useful, if not high-flying, career as an office-holder was terminated when he became a recluse. He probably took this step in or soon after 1393, when the monastery's <i>reclusorium</i>, formerly situated near the infirmary but now in the angle between the south transept and south ambulatory of the church, became vacant on the death of John Murymouth, its previous occupant. Murymouth was, it appears, the recluse to whom Richard II confessed on 14 June 1381, before his meeting with the rebels at Mile End, and whom Thomas Beauchamp, earl of Warwick (<i>d</i>. 1401), the former appellant, mentioned in his confession of treason in 1397.<br>
<br>In the later middle ages, the life of a recluse at Westminster was compatible with changes of scene, and London, accompanied by a servant, spent most of the year 1401&#150;2, and possibly a longer period, at Little Malvern Priory, Worcestershire. Abbot William Colchester's willingness to pay the cost of his board there underlines the special status he now enjoyed in the community: an abbot would not normally do this for a monk. There appears to be no good reason to doubt that London, long since in residence again at Westminster, was the recluse to whom Henry V confessed on the night of his father's death. The claims of William Alnwick, later the first confessor-general of the Bridgettine order, to this distinction depend on the St Albans chronicler's reference to him as a monk and recluse of Westminster. But no one of this name occurs in either capacity in Westminster sources for the period. Like many other recluses, London was sought out by devout, if in some cases politically deviant, members of the aristocracy. The bequest to him by Henry, Lord Scrope of Masham, executed for treason in 1415, of a rosary and the sum of &pound;5, a substantial legacy, points to more than a passing acquaintance between the two. A desire for greater solitude than could be enjoyed at Westminster may explain London's second absence, in 1416&#150;19, but this time his whereabouts are unknown. The bequest to him of &pound;10 by Thomas Beaufort, duke of Exeter (<i>d</i>. 1426), suggests that he again attracted an aristocratic clientele after his return to Westminster.<br>
<br>The St Albans chronicler believed that London died on or about the feast of St Scholastica (10 February), 1429. From Westminster sources, however, it appears that he died in 1428, in the late summer or autumn. He was probably buried in the monks' cemetery.<br>
