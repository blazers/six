<span class="headword">Lindsay <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Dunlop]</span>,  Anna</span>  (1845&#150;1903), <span class="occ">women's activist</span>, was born at 38 Melville Street, Edinburgh, on 24 June 1845, the elder daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8272/', "Alexander Colquhoun Stirling Murray Dunlop (1798&#150;1870)")</script>, Free Church lawyer and MP, and his wife, Eliza Esther, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Murray (<i>c</i>.1818&#150;1902). Educated at home in a liberal political atmosphere, she added a study of literature and philosophy to her early training, and was one of the earliest members of the University Classes for Women in Edinburgh, where her work was much praised by professors Tait and Campbell Fraser. On 8 October 1872 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34546/', "Thomas Martin Lindsay (1843&#150;1914)")</script>, who had just been appointed professor of divinity and church history at the Free Church college in Glasgow: she was to pass the rest of her life in that city.<br>
<br>In 1877 Anna Lindsay was one of the founders of the Glasgow Association for the Higher Education of Women, acting as one of the organization's honorary secretaries until 1883, when the association became Queen Margaret's College; she remained on the college council for some years. Anna Lindsay's wide range of work on behalf of women sprang from her Christianity; engaged in the home mission work of the Free Church at Broomielaw, her contact with poor women led her to consider other means, beyond the strictly religious, for improving their lot. She was actively involved in a number of philanthropic organizations for the benefit of working-class women and girls, including the Partick division of the Scottish Girls' Friendly Society, which she managed from 1881; the Ladies' Union for the Care and Help of Women, a preventive and reformatory association of which she was vice-president from 1885 until her death; the Training School and Temporary Home for Friendless Servant Girls; and the Mothers' Prayer Meeting (which evolved into the Scottish Mothers' Union).<br>
<br>From the 1880s onwards, however, the main focus of Mrs Lindsay's attention was women in industry. Margaret Irwin of the Scottish Council for Women's Trades (SCWT) commented of her that &#145;It is not possible to give any definite account of her work here, as the history of this would practically be the history of the Women's Industrial Movement itself&#146;  (<span class="italic">Anna Lindsay</span>, 6). She was one of the founder members of the Women's Protective and Provident League, which later merged with the SCWT, and chaired the executive committee of the latter for a number of years. Again according to Irwin, she was &#145;the mainspring of the whole movement. &hellip; Whoever might grow tired of committee work and drop away from time to time, Mrs Lindsay never failed, but was to be found standing loyally at the helm&#146;  (ibid., 7). From her desire to promote legislation in the interests of women workers, Mrs Lindsay was led into party politics. In 1889 she was one of the committee which formed the Glasgow and West of Scotland Women's Liberal Association, and was vice-chair until its merger with the Scottish Women's Liberal Federation (SWLF) in 1891. She chaired the SWLF from 1891 until 1899, when her health gave out.<br>
<br>Unswerving in her attachment to her church (she was an influential member and vice-president of the Glasgow branch of the Women's Foreign Missionary Society, and from 1892 to 1899 vice-president of the executive committee of the Free Church of Scotland), Anna Lindsay was valued for her capacity for seeing her opponents' points of view, for the catholicity of her sympathies, and for her great tact and judgement. The countess of Aberdeen observed that her domestic life was &#145;as ideal as her public life, and remains a testimony to the possibility of a mother's duties to the family and to the wider community outside the home being combined without clashing on one another&#146;  (<span class="italic">Anna Lindsay</span>, 17). The Lindsays had three sons and two daughters; their eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34537/', "Alexander Dunlop Lindsay, first Baron Lindsay of Birker")</script>, was to become master of Balliol College, Oxford, and their daughter Susan married Sir Frederick Maurice Powicke.<br>
<br>Anna Lindsay's health failed in 1899, and after suffering from Bright's disease for some three years she died early in the morning of 1 March 1903 at 37 Westbourne Gardens, Kelvinside, Glasgow; her death was certified by Dr Alice McLaren, her support for working women evident to the last.<br>
