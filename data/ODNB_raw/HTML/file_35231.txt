<span class="headword">Nicholson, Sir  Sydney Hugo</span>  (1875&#150;1947), <span class="occ">founder of the Royal School of Church Music and choral director</span>, was born on 9 February 1875 at 26 Devonshire Place, London, the third and youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35224/', "Sir Charles Nicholson, first baronet (1808&#150;1903)")</script>, of Luddenham, and Sarah Elizabeth Keightley. His first name recalled his father's residence in Australia (1834&#150;62). His brothers were the architect <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35225/', "Sir Charles A. Nicholson")</script>, and the stained-glass artist Archibald Keightley Nicholson. He was educated at Rugby School and New College, Oxford, taking a third-class degree in English in 1897. He studied organ and composition for three years at the Royal College of Music, London, under Walter Parratt and Charles Villiers Stanford, took the Oxford BMus in 1902, and studied at the conservatory in Frankfurt am Main (1903&#150;4). He was organist of Chipping Barnet parish church, Hertfordshire (1897&#150;1903), briefly of the lower chapel of Eton College (1903), and acting organist of Carlisle Cathedral from 1904. Offered a post as organist of Canterbury Cathedral in 1908, he withdrew in favour of a similar post at Manchester Cathedral, and in 1919 became organist of Westminster Abbey. As well as officiating at many royal services he and the choir made the first broadcast of choral evensong on the BBC on 6 October 1926. By his own admission he was not an organist of the first rank, and this may have contributed to his decision to resign from the abbey in 1928. In 1927 he founded the School of English Church Music, and was its first director. He was appointed MVO in 1926, was awarded a Lambeth doctorate in 1928, and was knighted for his services to church music in 1938.<br>
<br>An able organizer and administrator, not afraid of change and innovation, Nicholson made an impact at Carlisle, Manchester, and Westminster, though his musical taste was conservative. At Westminster Abbey he moved on most of the old lay clerks, introduced regular rehearsal, and doubled the number of boys to share the load of singing daily services. He also founded the large special choir with annual performances of Bach's <span class="roman">St Matthew passion</span>. Earlier he had instituted a church choral union (Barnet) and diocesan music societies (Carlisle and Manchester) to bring parish church choirs together. Through the Church Music Society and the archbishops' committee on church music (1922) he became engaged with questions of musical standards in Church of England parish churches. Much of this background influenced the two parts of his new foundation: the residential College of St Nicolas to train church musicians and the School of English Church Music, a network of affiliated Anglican churches committed to raising standards of music in worship.<br>
<br>Nicholson had considered turning his attention to these matters since at least 1925 or 1926. On 6 December 1927, at a meeting at Westminster Abbey, he founded the School of English Church Music, bought the first premises, Buller's Wood, Chislehurst, in October 1928, and became warden of the small College of St Nicolas in January 1929. Membership of the school expanded from 105 in 1928 to more than 2000 affiliates in Britain and overseas by the time of his death. The initial success of this ambitious enterprise depended almost entirely on Nicholson's enthusiasm and vigour, with financial support from <span class="italic">Hymns Ancient and Modern</span>. He toured widely in Britain and throughout the empire. Early achievements included four enormous choral festivals (one of which involved 4000 voices at Crystal Palace in 1933), residential courses for boys, day courses, and a summer school for choirmasters and clergy.<br>
<br>At the beginning of the Second World War the College of St Nicolas was closed and the school was relocated to St Michael's College, Tenbury, where Nicholson became acting organist and choirmaster until 1943, when he set up temporary quarters in Leamington Spa. In 1945 it was granted a royal charter and became the Royal School of Church Music. Both school and college were then re-established in Canterbury, and he continued as director of the school. Nicholson died at Ashford Hospital, Kent, on 30 May 1947 after several strokes; his ashes were interred in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey on 6 June.<br>
<br>Nicholson's ideas were reflected in <span class="italic">Church Music: a Practical Handbook</span> (1920), <span class="italic">Quires and Places where they Sing</span> (1932), and, with G. L. H. Garner, <span class="italic">A Manual of English Church Music</span> (1923). He wrote three musical dramatic pieces, including <span class="italic">The Children of the Chapel</span>, and a novel, <span class="italic">Peter</span>, which tells the story of a boy chorister through the ages. He guided much of the musical editing of <span class="italic">Hymns Ancient and Modern</span> from the supplement of 1916 to the revised edition, which appeared in 1950. A small number of organ and choral works were published.<br>
<br>An enthusiastic early motorist, Nicholson enjoyed sketching, carpentry, printing, and photography. His overall concern for the well-being of his boy choristers resulted in the establishment of a choir club and holidays at Carlisle and scout troops at Manchester and Westminster Abbey. His obituary in the <span class="italic">Musical Times</span> (July 1947) reported &#145;a man of excellent presence&#146; and &#145;courteous manner&#146;, &#145;a confirmed bachelor&#146; who &#145;lived comfortably, though simply&#146;.<br>
