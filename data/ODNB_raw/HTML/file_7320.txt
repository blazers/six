<span class="headword">Davy,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1780), <span class="occ">serjeant-at-law</span>, was the son and heir of William Davy (<i>d</i>. before 1741), druggist, of Exeter. Admitted to the Inner Temple on 16 October 1741, he was called to the bar in 1745. According to Lord Eldon's anecdotes he had originally begun in trade and had been made bankrupt, though it is possible that legend had confused the son with the father. Davy was one of a new breed of counsel who made his name at <i>nisi prius</i> and in the criminal courts, both on the western circuit and at the Old Bailey, where professional advocacy had once been virtually unknown; and his skill lay in the cut and thrust of trial practice rather than in legal argument. Nevertheless, some manuscript law reports taken by him between 1742 and 1755 survive in Lincoln's Inn, together with some notebooks on legal subjects and one on Latin grammar. His first important cases came in January 1753, when he defended a forger, who was found guilty, confessed, and was executed at Tyburn. In the same year he was engaged in the famous case of Elizabeth Canning (1734&#150;1773); Davy defended Mary Squires in this trial and afterwards conducted the prosecution of Canning.<br>
<br>Such was Davy's reputation as an advocate that he was created a serjeant-at-law only ten years after call, in 1755, his patrons at the ceremony being the duke of Somerset and the earl of Suffolk. After his appointment as one of the king's serjeants in 1762 he was less involved in defence work, though he was one of the counsel for Elizabeth Chudleigh, duchess of Kingston (1720&#150;1788) in the case against her for bigamy in 1776. He represented the black slave James Somerset in the great slavery case heard by Lord Mansfield in 1772. In his concluding speech Davy reiterated the view that &#145;this air is too pure for a slave to breathe in. I trust I shall not quit this court without certain conviction of that assertion&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Nevertheless, Davy's efforts were overshadowed by the brilliance of his junior Francis Hargrave. In other prominent cases he found himself supporting arbitrary powers of government against Serjeant Glynn, and in that of the radical politician John Wilkes he was criticized for citing precedents from the time of Charles I. Davy was renowned for his quirky humour and quick repartee, and numerous stories about him circulated at the bar. Two illustrations of his wit may serve. When Lord Mansfield interrupted him in argument, saying, &#145;If this be law I must burn all my books, I see&#146;, Davy instantly replied: &#145;Your lordship had better read them first&#146;  (Woolrych, 2.625&#150;6). On another occasion, when Mansfield proposed to sit on Good Friday, Davy is said to have reminded him that he would be the first judge to do so since Pontius Pilate. For the last three years of his life, by dint of seniority after the death of Mr Serjeant Whitaker in 1777, Davy was leader of the English bar as king's prime serjeant. He died at Hammersmith on 13 December 1780 after a short illness, and was buried at Newington Butts.<br>
