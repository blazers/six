<span class="headword">Thompson,  Donald James <span class="st"> [Don]</span></span>  (1933&#150;2006), <span class="occ">athlete</span>, was born on 20 January 1933 at 6 Cleveland Road, Hillingdon, London, the son of Lauri James Thompson, aircraft draughtsman, and his wife, Doris Alice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Denny. At the time of the registration of his birth his parents lived at 61 Keith Road, Hayes. He was educated locally. He took up running as a child, but an injury to his Achilles tendon when he was eighteen made him switch his attention to race walking as a member of the Metropolitan Walking Club. While working in insurance, he started to make an impact in the amateur racing world in 1954, when he finished second in his first London to Brighton walk, a distance of 52.5 miles.<br>
<br>In 1955 Thompson achieved national and international success as a race walker, winning the London to Brighton race and the 100 km Milan race. His diminutive frame&#151;he was 5 feet 5 inches at his tallest&#151;and his powerful performance earned him the nickname of <i>il topolino</i> (the little mouse) from the Italian spectators, a sobriquet that stuck. In 1956 he successfully defended his London to Brighton title, won the Race Walking Association (RWA) 50 km at Enfield, and represented Great Britain in the 50 km race at the Melbourne Olympic games. However, he suffered from dehydration in the Melbourne race, and withdrew after 45 km while in fifth place. Thompson dominated the sport in the late 1950s and early 1960s, regularly winning the RWA 50 km and the London to Brighton race, setting a course record of 7 hours 35 minutes 12 seconds in the latter in 1957. He also challenged for the European 50 km title in 1958, finishing in fifth place. In all, he won the RWA 50 km title eight times (from 1956 to 1962 and again in 1966), and the London to Brighton race nine times (from 1955 to 1962 and in 1967). His performances in the RWA's events won him that association's Edgar Horton cup in 1956, 1957, 1958, and 1961, while his performances on the London to Brighton race led him to be known as Mr Brighton in the race-walking world.<br>
<br>Thompson's fame spread beyond the relatively small world of British race walking in 1960 when he won the gold medal in the 50 km walk at the Rome Olympic games. He had learnt the lesson of his dehydration in Melbourne, and included some home-made climate training in his preparation for Rome. As well as concentrating on distance and stamina in his regular road training around his home in Cranford, Middlesex, he turned the bathroom of his mother's house into a heat chamber, blocking the doors and windows and using steam and an oil heater to get the temperature up to 43&deg;C. He carried out close to twenty of these sessions, exercising in the heat and humidity for up to three quarters of an hour each time. The carbon monoxide fumes from the heater were a problem, but when he got to Rome, and had to race in 38&deg;C heat, he found himself well prepared. With sunglasses and his trademark sunhat, made of a handkerchief sewn on to a cap, he started well, and when two of the early leaders were disqualified for losing contact with the ground, Thompson found himself battling for gold with John Ljunggren of Sweden. Thompson led for the last 5 km, and won by just 17 seconds in a new Olympic record of 4.25.30. Thompson later described himself as &#145;smugly happy&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>) with his victory, which was the only British athletics gold at Rome. He added to his international success later in 1960 by winning the Milan 100 km, and became the first&#151;and at the time of his death only&#151;race walker to be named sportsman of the year by the Sports Writers' Association.<br>
<br>As well as continuing to dominate domestic competition in the early 1960s and breaking British records at all distances from 20 to 30 miles and 25 to 50 km, Thompson also competed internationally, coming third in the European 50 km championship in 1962. He defended his Olympic title in Tokyo in 1964, but failed to retain the gold, ending in tenth place. However, his time of 4.22.39 was almost three minutes faster than his Rome time. He competed in the 1966 Commonwealth games in Kingston, Jamaica, switching down to the 20 km and finishing in fourth place. He also raced in the European championship and the Lugano cup in 1967, the last international performances of his race walking career.<br>
<br>On 26 May 1967, at Epsom register office, Thompson married Margaret (Maggie) Ball, a 28-year-old secretary at a teachers' training college, and daughter of John Arthur Ball, local government officer. They had one son and one daughter. They settled in Hythe, Kent, with Thompson joining the Folkestone Running Club. Although withdrawing from international competition, he remained active in both race walking and in long-distance running, managing over 150 marathons with a personal best time of 2.51. He maintained high mileage training for the rest of his life, combining his work as a self-employed gardener with training walks and runs of over 100 miles per week. In 1978 he achieved race walking's centurion status by completing the Leicester to Skegness 100 mile walk. He made an unlikely international return in 1991, when he was a member of the British team in a 200 km walk in France. He remained dedicated to the sport at club level, and was still active into his seventies as &#145;the elder statesman of English Walking&#146;  (Erickson). In March 2006, Thompson and his wife moved from Hythe to Fleet in Hampshire to be closer to their children's families. In October of that year, Thompson suffered an aneurysm. He died of a subarachnoid haemorrhage and pneumonia on 3 October 2006 at Frimley Park Hospital, Surrey. He was survived by his wife and their two children.<br>
