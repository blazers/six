<span class="headword">Cavendish,  William</span>, fifth duke of Devonshire  (1748&#150;1811), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was born on 14 December 1748, the eldest of the four children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4949/', "William Cavendish, fourth duke of Devonshire (bap. 1720, d. 1764)")</script>, politician, and his wife, Charlotte Elizabeth Boyle, Baroness Clifford (1731&#150;1754), daughter and heir of Richard Boyle, third earl of Burlington. He was known by the courtesy title Lord Cavendish until his mother's death, when he succeeded her as seventh Baron Clifford; from his father's accession to the dukedom in 1755 he was known as marquess of Hartington. He attended a school before becoming duke, but it is unknown which one. On his father's death on 3 October 1764 he became fifth duke of Devonshire and inherited vast estates in England, principally in Derbyshire and Yorkshire, and in Ireland valued at over &pound;36,000 a year. These included the properties of Chatsworth House and Hardwick Hall in Derbyshire, Londesborough House and Bolton Abbey in Yorkshire, Lismore Castle in co. Waterford, Chiswick House in Middlesex, and Devonshire House and Burlington House in Piccadilly, London. Further family estates were settled on his brother George, later first earl of Burlington (1754&#150;1834). After the deaths of his parents Devonshire was brought up by his three bachelor uncles&#151;lords Frederick, George, and John Cavendish&#151;and was presented at court in the spring of 1765. His uncles abandoned an idea that he should attend Cambridge University for fear people there would &#145;pay dirty court&#146; to him and that he would contract &#145;unbecoming friendships&#146;  (Lord John Cavendish to Richard Newcome, 11 Oct 1764, Chatsworth MS 428.12). He travelled on the continent in 1767&#150;8, and his uncles kept him informed of their management of his interest at the 1768 general election.<br>
<br>On 7 June 1774 Devonshire married the gregarious Lady Georgiana Spencer [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4934/', "Cavendish, Georgiana, duchess of Devonshire (1757&#150;1806)")</script>], eldest daughter of John, first Earl Spencer, at Wimbledon parish church, Surrey, despite rumours that he was to wed Lady Betty Hamilton. Earlier in the year he had fathered an illegitimate daughter, Charlotte Williams, by a London milliner, Charlotte Spencer (<i>d</i>. 1781). Georgiana bore him three children: Georgiana (1783&#150;1858), Harriet (1785&#150;1862) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38507/', "Gower, Henrietta Elizabeth Leveson-, Countess Granville")</script>], and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4951/', "William George Spencer Cavendish, the future sixth duke (1790&#150;1858)")</script>. In contrast to his extravagant wife, Devonshire was reserved and insular, prone to heavy drinking and gambling, and he possessed a greater affection for dogs than for people. As Nathaniel Wraxall described him:<blockquote>He seemed to be incapable of any strong emotion, and destitute of all energy or activity of mind. As play became indispensable in order to rouse him from this lethargic habit and to awaken his torpid faculties, he passed his evenings usually at Brookes's, engaged at whist or faro. Yet beneath so quiet an exterior he possessed a highly improved understanding, and on all disputes that occasionally arose among the members of the club relative to passages of the Roman poets or historians, I know that appeal was constantly made to the Duke, and his decision or opinion was regarded as final. (<span class="italic">Historical and Posthumous Memoirs</span>, 3.344)</blockquote>Devonshire came from one of the wealthiest and most powerful whig families. However, he possessed no great ability or political ambition. He was lord high treasurer of Ireland and governor of Cork from 1766 to 1793, and lord lieutenant of Derbyshire from 1782 to his death, but three times refused cabinet office: once during the formation of the Fox&#150;North administration in 1783, again during the regency crisis of 1788&#150;9 when Charles James Fox told him any post was his for the asking, and again in 1806 when he was invited to join the &#145;ministry of all the talents&#146;. He took his duties seriously: in 1778 he became colonel of the Derbyshire militia, and he spent summer the next year in camp with his men rather than go to Spa with his wife and her family, although this decision also reflected a measure of estrangement between Devonshire and the duchess. He made the first of his two recorded speeches in the House of Lords on 6 March 1780, when he opposed the dismissal of Francis Osborne, marquess of Carmarthen, and Henry Herbert, earl of Pembroke, from their lord lieutenancies. He was appointed KG on 19 April 1782, an honour he allegedly said he would no more ask the king for &#145;than I would ask him for a blue great coat&#146;  (<span class="italic">Last Journals of Horace Walpole</span>, 2.427). On 3 July 1793 he was created DCL by the University of Oxford.<br>
<br>In May 1782 the Devonshires met Lady Elizabeth Christiana Foster [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4930/', "Cavendish, Elizabeth Christiana, duchess of Devonshire (1757&#150;1824)")</script>], daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13111/', "Frederick Hervey, fourth earl of Bristol")</script>, bishop of Derry, and estranged wife of John Thomas Foster MP. Together the three formed a bizarre love triangle whose conspicuous interdependence provoked much gossip and speculation. Georgiana and Lady Elizabeth nicknamed the duke Canis because of his obsessive love of dogs. Lady Elizabeth gave birth to two children fathered by the duke: Caroline St Jules (1785&#150;1862), who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15915/', "George Lamb")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5643/', "Augustus William James Clifford (1788&#150;1877)")</script>, later a naval officer and a baronet. The irregularity of their domestic arrangements lent colour to Devonshire House, which remained the focus for the Foxite whigs through the 1790s. Neither Devonshire's hostility to the radicalism favoured by Fox and Georgiana's lover Charles Grey, nor his opposition to the policy of peace with France favoured by Fox's circle, threatened its status, which was guaranteed by the personal qualities of Georgiana, and by the willingness of the duke to divert his estate income towards the financial support of Foxite candidates and impoverished members of the circle.<br>
<br>Devonshire regarded himself as bound to the whig tradition by heredity. He was not a natural leader, and those who thought he could succeed Fox as the focus of the whig party when Fox temporarily retired from politics were disappointed: John Nichols dismissed him as &#145;a mere sensualist&#146;  (Foreman, 309). His sympathy towards some of the Pitt ministry's measures in the face of revolutionary agitation and invasion from France led him to make his second recorded speech in the Lords, supporting an address to the king on Irish affairs on 15 June 1798. It was said that when he voted with the government on an anti-Jacobin measure, his whig nominees as members for Knaresborough in Yorkshire arrived at Devonshire House the next day to submit their resignations; Devonshire responded: &#145;I never interfere with your vote&#151;I don't see why you should interfere with mine&#146;  (Thorne). Although a tolerant borough patron where his members were concerned, Devonshire jealously protected his rights as the proprietor of the majority of the burgesses in Knaresborough. At the general election of 1806, when the inhabitants attempted to disrupt the voting of the burgesses in the hope of overturning the limited franchise, he sent in 300 lead miners and soldiers of the Scots Greys to take on the disaffected residents.<br>
<br>From middle life Devonshire increasingly suffered from bouts of ill health, the consequence of excessive drinking, and spent less and less time in London, preferring Chatsworth, Chiswick, or visits to Bath. The death of Georgiana in 1806 shook his life both personally and politically. Lady Elizabeth Foster took over as female head of the household, to the fury of his unmarried daughter Harriet. It was only at this point that he made a great effort to know his children, and considered it a great expression of affection when in November 1807 he presented Harriet with a puppy, attempting to pass on his mania for dogs. Harriet wrote:<blockquote>he really thinks of little else and the whole time of dinner and supper he feeds and watches them, laughs excessively every time they squeak or run and listens to no conversation with half the pleasure as he does when these puppies are the subject. (<span class="italic">Letters of Lady Harriet Cavendish</span>, 232)</blockquote>His cohabitation with Lady Elizabeth Foster was regularized on 19 October 1809 when they married at Chiswick House, although the marriage seems to have scandalized society more than Lady Elizabeth's previous status as his mistress, and fewer people than before called at Devonshire House.<br>
<br>Devonshire died at Devonshire House, Piccadilly, London, on 29 July 1811, of &#145;water on the chest&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>), and was buried at All Saints' Church, Derby. He left an estate estimated at &pound;125,000, but expenditure on the acquisition of land and on property development during his lifetime, including The Crescent at Buxton, Derbyshire, as well as the burden of Georgiana's gambling losses and the other demands of the Devonshires' expensive lifestyle, had burdened the estate with debts calculated at &pound;593,000 in 1814, an unpromising legacy to his successor. Nevertheless most of his contemporaries would have agreed with Wraxall's assessment: &#145;if not a superior man, he was an honourable and respectable member of society&#146;  (<span class="italic">Historical and Posthumous Memoirs</span>, 3.344).<br>
