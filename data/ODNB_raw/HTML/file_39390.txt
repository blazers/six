<span class="headword">Haigh,  John George</span>  (1909&#150;1949), <span class="occ">murderer</span>, was born at home at 22 King's Road, Stamford, Lincolnshire, on 24 July 1909, to John Robert Haigh (1872&#150;1955), an electrical engineer, and his wife, Emily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hudson (1868&#150;1955), both natives of Yorkshire and married for eleven years. They were members of the strict religious body the Plymouth Brethren. When Haigh was one year old the family moved to Outwood, Yorkshire, where his father gained employment as an electrician at the nearby colliery. His upbringing was strict, in accordance with the faith of his parents, who affectionately called him Sonnie. The young Haigh soon displayed a musical talent that won him, at the age of ten, a choral scholarship to Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Wakefield. Seen as a smart, polite, intelligent boy with a good character and home life, he became a choirboy at the cathedral and later at Leeds parish church. He left school at the age of seventeen and, as he was lazy by nature, forgery and deception became the easy alternatives to work.<br>
<br>The suave, dapper Haigh discovered he could make money to finance his expensive tastes in cars and clothes without having to work too hard. On 6 July 1934, at Bridlington register office, he married Beatrice (Betty) Hamer (<i>b</i>. 1911), a former waitress and model, daughter of Harold Cleasby Hamer, artist. His occupation at this time was given as company director, and both gave their residence as the Alexandra Hotel, Bridlington. His business was fraudulent hire purchase and selling non-existent cars. The marriage did not last long. In December 1934, at Leeds assizes, Haigh received fifteen months' imprisonment for fraud offences, with six offences taken into consideration. He saw his wife only once again. She had borne a daughter while Haigh was in prison and the baby was adopted. Haigh never made a paternity claim and never saw the child.<br>
<br>A life of fraud still seemed the easy option and in November 1937 Haigh was sentenced at Surrey assizes to four years' imprisonment for false pretences with twenty-two offences taken into account. In wartime Haigh became a fire-watcher during the enemy raids on London; however, he was sentenced in June 1941, at the London sessions, to twenty-one months' hard labour for stealing bunks, kitchen and curtain material, and a refrigerator. In Lincoln prison he worked in the tinsmith's shop, where he gained a knowledge of sulphuric acid and its use. Late in 1943 he moved to Crawley, Sussex, where he lived with a family named Stephens. Ever the dapper, polite, businessman, he wore a small moustache and greased, slicked-back hair. He was always impeccably dressed. He became fond of the Stephenses' attractive teenage daughter Barbara, a friendship which lasted to the end.<br>
<br>Around this time Haigh took a room in the Onslow Court Hotel, South Kensington. The comfortable hotel was favoured by retired elderly ladies and the charming Haigh was a desirable table companion. There Haigh became friendly with a wealthy 69-year-old widow, Mrs Henrietta Helen Olivia Robarts (Olive) Durand-Deacon, who was amenable to business ideas. She was interested in marketing cosmetics. On 18 February 1949 Haigh took her to see his &#145;factory&#146; in Leopold Road, Crawley. There he shot her and put her body into a 40 gallon drum, which he filled with sulphuric acid, wearing a gas mask, rubber gloves, and apron to protect himself. He took her valuables, including jewellery and a Persian lamb coat. She was reported missing by a friend at the hotel, who was accompanied to the police station by Haigh. He came under suspicion, his criminal record was checked, and he was arrested. Mrs Durand-Deacon's property was traced to where he had sold it, for he had needed the cash to settle debts.<br>
<br>The search of the premises at Crawley was a triumph in forensic medicine for the pathologist Dr Keith Simpson. Remains consisting of a few bone fragments, fat, three gallstones, false teeth, plastic handbag, and a few personal items were recovered. With blood tests on stains found in the &#145;factory&#146; these were enough to prove he had murdered her, despite the lack of a body. Haigh then confessed to the murders of William Donald McSwann and his parents, William and Amy McSwann, in 1944&#150;5, and of Dr Archibald Henderson and his wife, Rosalie, in 1948, all for gain. They too had been disposed of in a similar manner. To avoid the hangman's rope his only recourse was a plea of insanity. He told of lurid blood-filled dreams and claimed that he had tapped blood from the necks of his victims and drunk it from a glass. The press gave him the nickname &#145;the Vampire Killer&#146;. He claimed three more unknown past victims, presumably to enhance his insanity plea.<br>
<br>The trial opened at Lewes assizes on 18 July 1949. He was found guilty, and on 19 July the judge, Mr Justice Humphreys, pronounced sentence of death on Haigh. Executed by Albert Pierrepoint at Wandsworth prison at 9 a.m. on Monday 10 August 1949, he was buried the same day within the precincts of the prison. The &#145;Acid Bath Murderer&#146;, as he was known, left clothing to Madame Tussaud's waxworks to dress his effigy, which remains there to this day.<br>
