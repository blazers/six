<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pankhurst, Dame  Christabel Harriette</span>  (1880&#150;1958), <span class="occ">suffragette</span>, was born on 22 September 1880 at 1 Drayton Terrace, Old Trafford, Manchester, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/93722/', "Richard Marsden Pankhurst (1835/6&#150;1898)")</script>, a radical barrister, and his wife, Emmeline Goulden (1858&#150;1928) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35376/', "Pankhurst, Emmeline")</script>]. The eldest of their five children, Christabel was her mother's favourite. In 1886 the family moved to London where their home in Russell Square became a centre for gatherings of socialists, leading reformers, Fabians, suffragists, and freethinkers. The young Pankhursts were encouraged at an early age to attend such meetings and to make themselves useful by arranging chairs, giving out leaflets, and collecting contributions. Dr Pankhurst, an ardent campaigner for the advanced cause of women's suffrage, would often exclaim, &#145;Why are women so patient? Why don't you force us to give you the vote?&#146;  (E. S. Pankhurst, 97). Such experiences had a decisive effect on Christabel. Nothing she learned from the inadequate education offered by governesses or, when the family moved back to the north in 1893, at the high schools she attended&#151;first in Southport and then in Manchester&#151;compared with the political education she received at home. One day, when the family were discussing women's suffrage, Christabel startled her mother with the remark, &#145;How long you women have been trying for the vote. For my part, I mean to get it&#146;  (E. Pankhurst, 35&#150;6).<br>
<br>In summer 1898, accompanied by her mother, Christabel went to Geneva to perfect her French; while she was there, news arrived unexpectedly of her father's death. Since Dr Pankhurst left nothing but debts, his wife had to sell their home and move to a humbler residence at 62 Nelson Street, Manchester. She gratefully accepted the post of registrar of births and deaths and also opened a shop in the hope that it might provide some income as well as employment for Christabel, who intensely disliked the work. Seeing her unhappiness, Emmeline suggested that her eldest daughter attend some classes at Manchester University, and it was there that Christabel met Esther Roper, who, with Eva Gore-Booth, was active in encouraging working women to campaign for the parliamentary vote. By the end of 1902 Christabel, who, like her mother, was already a member of the Independent Labour Party (ILP), was lecturing in Cheshire, Lancashire, Yorkshire, and Scotland for the North of England Society for Women's Suffrage, of which Esther Roper was secretary. Becoming increasingly critical of the ILP's lukewarm attitude on the women question, Christabel warned that working men could be as unjust to women as men of other classes. On 10 October 1903 Emmeline and a few other socialist women founded the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) to campaign for votes for women on the same terms as they were, or might be, granted to men. Taking the motto &#145;Deeds, not words&#146;, the WSPU restricted its membership to women only, and aimed to be free of class and party political affiliation. That same autumn, Christabel enrolled for a law degree at Manchester University.<h2>
<a name="ThemilitantcampaignoftheWSPUbegins"></a>The militant campaign of the WSPU begins</h2>Despite the demands of her university studies, Christabel became an energetic speaker in the early years of peaceful campaigning, but soon decided that a more confrontational approach was necessary if women's suffrage was to be won. Furthermore, she believed that government support was essential if women's enfranchisement was to be granted. Thus on 13 October 1905 she and Annie Kenney, a working-class factory worker recently recruited to the WSPU, attended a Liberal Party meeting in the Free Trade Hall, Manchester, where at question time Annie asked, &#145;Will the Liberal government give votes to women?&#146; When no answer was given, Christabel repeated the question. The meeting broke into uproar as the women were dragged outside where Christabel deliberately committed the technical offence of spitting at a policeman in order to court arrest. Charged with causing an obstruction, both chose prison rather than pay a fine, an action that brought the desired effect of media attention to the women's cause. From now on, heckling politicians became a key WSPU tactic, along with other minor acts of civil disobedience, including demonstrations to parliament.<br>
<br>In July 1906 Christabel graduated with a first-class honours degree in law and then moved to WSPU headquarters, now in London, where she became chief organizer on a salary of &pound;2 10<i>s</i>. per week. Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, married to a wealthy barrister, Frederick, was treasurer of the WSPU and, inspired by Christabel's faith in militant tactics as well as enchanted by her personality, the Pethick-Lawrences took her into their own home where she lived for the next six years. Surveying the London scene, Christabel decided that it was too dependent for its demonstrations on ILP women from the East End, and reaffirmed the policy of no affiliation to any political grouping or any particular class. At the Cockermouth by-election the following month, she announced that in the future the WSPU would oppose all Labour parliamentary candidates in addition to Liberals and Conservatives, a move strongly supported by her mother but not by her sisters <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37833/', "(Estelle) Sylvia Pankhurst")</script> and Adela [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56250/', "Walsh, Adela")</script>]. In September 1907 both Christabel and Emmeline resigned their membership of the ILP, since the Labour Party, fearing that votes for women on the same terms as men would only enfranchise middle-class women who would vote Conservative, now opposed the extension of the franchise on a property qualification to a section of the population. Through all the long years of campaigning ahead, the uncompromising and determined Christabel never wavered in her conviction that the breaking of the sex barrier against women was the key barrier to be broken, a view that had been undoubtedly strengthened by the fact that she had been refused admission to the bar because of her sex.<h2>
<a name="ChristabelasaWSPUleader"></a>Christabel as a WSPU leader</h2>Christabel's insistence on an independent policy for the WSPU and her increasingly autocratic style of leadership caused tensions among the membership, so that by the autumn of 1907 a splinter group had left to form another militant organization later called the Women's Freedom League. As Emmeline Pankhurst, the leader of the WSPU, spent most of her time speaking in the provinces, the daily administration of business fell to Christabel and the Pethick-Lawrences. Although Emmeline was consulted on major issues, she had the greatest faith in the political flair of her eldest daughter. It was Christabel who played the key role in policy making, emerging as a confident, fearless, and imaginative strategist.<br>
<br>Christabel helped to plan spectacular events that attracted widespread attention, such as the &#145;Trojan horse&#146; raid on the House of Commons in February 1908 when between twenty and thirty women jumped out of a pantechnicon van in an attempt to gain entrance. When Emmeline, Christabel, and Flora Drummond appeared at Bow Street court in October 1908, charged with conduct likely to provoke a breach of the peace, she acted as lawyer for the trio and, in a brilliant move, subpoenaed as witnesses two cabinet ministers, Herbert Gladstone and Lloyd George. Called &#145;Suffragette Portia&#146; by the press, Christabel's name became a household word. Her youth, charm, vitality, accomplished oratory, and wit as a speaker captivated her audiences. Furthermore, she outlined WSPU policy in regular articles published in <span class="italic">Votes for Women</span>, edited by the Pethick-Lawrences, and in a series of pamphlets.<br>
<br>In July 1909, the imprisoned suffragette Marion Wallace Dunlop refused to eat food until her demand to be treated as a political prisoner and placed in the privileged first division was granted. After fasting for ninety-one hours, she was released. The hunger strike was soon adopted by other imprisoned suffragettes, but two months later the government responded not by releasing the women but by forcible feeding, an act that was condemned with burning indignation by Christabel and the other WSPU leaders.<br>
<br>When the Liberals were returned to government but with no overall majority in the general election of January 1910, Christabel attributed their declining electoral fortunes to WSPU tactics. Realizing that a political situation where the government depended on the support of Labour and Irish nationalists could be helpful to the women's cause, Henry Brailsford, a journalist, formed a Conciliation Committee for Women's Suffrage which the WSPU leaders ultimately supported. Christabel, although full of doubts that Prime Minister Asquith would ever grant votes to women, nevertheless hoped that a settlement could be reached by peaceful means, since she believed that &#145;mild&#146; militancy was played out. The suspension of militancy, announced at the end of January, remained in force until 21 November 1911, apart from one week during 1910. When Asquith stated on 7 November 1911 that the government would introduce next session a <span class="roman">Manhood Suffrage Bill</span> that could be amended to include women, Christabel denounced his scheme as disreputable, and appealed for one thousand women to march to Westminster two weeks later. While the demonstration was taking place, however, a smaller group armed with bags of stones and hammers broke windows of government offices and businesses. Convinced that the government would not concede women's suffrage until they were forced to do so, the WSPU engaged in further window breaking, this time on a mass scale, in early March 1912; the policy had been jointly agreed by Christabel, her mother, and Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence. On 5 March, the police rushed to Clement's Inn with a warrant for the arrest of the leaders. Christabel, however, now lived in a flat nearby. Warned of what was happening, and fearful that the movement would collapse if all the leaders were in prison, she fled to France where a political offender was not liable to extradition.<br>
<br>Emmeline urged WSPU members to trust Christabel and those she put in command under her at Clement's Inn and, between imprisonments, travelled regularly between England and France to consult her daughter, as did the trusted couriers Annie and Jessie Kenney. At one such meeting, in the summer of 1912, Christabel and Emmeline decided that a more aggressive militant campaign should be conducted, involving widespread attacks on public and private property, a direction with which the Pethick-Lawrences disagreed. In October, Christabel risked detection and arrest by travelling in disguise to London, in order to tell the Pethick-Lawrences that she was in complete agreement with her mother that their connection with the WSPU should be severed and that, contrary to their wishes, she would not return to England but continue to direct affairs from Paris. Such plans must have been well prepared, since on 17 October a new official WSPU newspaper appeared, <span class="italic">The Suffragette</span>, of which Christabel was editor. From now on, militancy was driven further underground as widespread destruction of letters in mailboxes became common as well as arson, window breaking, and other acts of vandalism. The government responded by prohibiting WSPU meetings and raiding its central offices.<br>
<br>From April 1913 Christabel published a series of articles in <span class="italic">The Suffragette</span> on the double sexual standard, prostitution, and venereal disease, probably with the aim of heightening consciousness among her followers that they were fighting a just sex war. She outlined how, in a male-dominated society, where women were kept in a state of subservience and economic dependence, the social evil of prostitution was the fruit of women's slavery. The cure for the social evil, she explained, was to have stronger women and purer men, a situation that would come with and through the vote. By the end of the year, when the series was published collectively as <span class="italic">The Great Scourge and How to End It</span>, subscriptions to the WSPU had declined dramatically.<br>
<br>Despite criticisms of her policy and residence in Paris, Christabel remained convinced that escalating violence would eventually win the parliamentary vote for women since it would create, she believed, an intolerable situation for politicians. Furthermore, she would brook no opposition to the WSPU's independent political stance, even by a member of her family. Thus in early January 1914, she asked Sylvia to travel to Paris where she told her, in Emmeline's presence, that her East London Federation must be separate from the WSPU since it was allied to the socialist movement. Her distrust of socialism deepened when the Labour Party supported the government's <span class="roman">Plural Voting Bill</span> in the belief that it would bring in some electoral advantage, despite the fact that the sex disqualification against women would not be removed. Indeed, she warned:<blockquote>For Suffragists to put their faith in any men's party, whatever it may call itself, is recklessly to disregard the lessons of the past forty years &hellip; The truth is that women must work out their own salvation. Men will not do it for them. (<span class="italic">The Suffragette</span>, 17 April 1914, 10)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="TheWSPUandtheFirstWorldWar"></a>The WSPU and the First World War</h2>On the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, all suffragette prisoners were released unconditionally, and on 12 August Emmeline Pankhurst sent a circular to all WSPU members announcing a temporary suspension of activities. The following month Christabel returned to London and at a meeting at the London Opera House announced that the WSPU would abandon the votes for women campaign and support the government in its hour of need. In October she began a six-month tour of the USA, with financial backing from Mrs Belmont, a wealthy American suffragist, and the blessing of the British government, her role being primarily to persuade the Americans to support the allies by entering the war. In <span class="italic">Britannia</span> (the new name for <span class="italic">The Suffragette</span>, with &#145;For King, For Country, For Freedom&#146; as its motto) she expounded her views, including attacks on the war policy of Asquith. The offices of the WSPU were again raided, and <span class="italic">Britannia</span> was forced to be produced wherever it was considered safe. However, the government decided to utilize the skills of the WSPU leaders in a women's &#145;Right to Serve&#146; demonstration, to help overcome trade union opposition to widespread use of women's labour, and a successful march, financed by the government, took place in July 1915. Further verbal attacks by Christabel on government figures led to further raids and increasing difficulties for WSPU office staff. When Annie Kenney wrote to her in early 1917 explaining the problems, Christabel returned immediately from France to England.<br>
<br>Initially, Christabel stayed with her mother at 50 Clarendon Road, Holland Park, the new home that Emmeline had created for her four adopted war babies&#151;Kathleen, Mary, Joan, and Elizabeth (Betty). Then she moved to a flat on the top floor of the new WSPU headquarters at 4 William Street. Since it was becoming clear that, in the near future, women would be granted the parliamentary vote, a decision was made to remould the WSPU into a different organization that could serve the interests of women voters. Thus later that year the WSPU became the Women's Party, whose policies included a mixture of feminist concerns&#151;equal opportunity of employment, equal pay, equal marriage laws, and equality of parental rights&#151;as well as some anti-socialist measures such as the abolition of trade unions. Emmeline Pankhurst was the honorary treasurer, Annie Kenney the honorary secretary, Flora Drummond chief organizer, while Christabel continued as editor of <span class="italic">Britannia</span>, its official newspaper. The four women campaigned throughout the country, especially in industrial areas, warning against Bolshevism and arguing for industrial peace.<br>
<br>Neither Christabel nor Emmeline took an extensive part in the negotiations that granted a partial enfranchisement to women in 1918 if they were over thirty years of age and householders or wives of householders, occupiers of property with an annual rent of &pound;5 or more, or graduates of British universities. Instead they concentrated on a scheme dear to Emmeline's heart, that Christabel should be the first woman MP. In the general election of December 1918 she stood as a Women's Party candidate for the constituency of Smethwick, with the support of the coalition government, but lost by 775 votes. In early 1919, she announced her intention of standing again as a Women's Party candidate, this time for the Westminster Abbey division. However, the plan did not materialize since there was lack of support for the Women's Party, which ceased to exist by the autumn.<h2>
<a name="Postsuffragecareer"></a>Post-suffrage career</h2>For some years Christabel had been drawn to Christianity and she now became a Second Adventist. In 1921 she joined her mother in Canada and then went to California, preaching the second coming. She became both a popular speaker and author, publishing books such as <span class="italic">&#145;The Lord Cometh&#146;, the World Crisis Explained</span> (1923) and <span class="italic">Pressing Problems of the Closing Age</span> (1924). In 1925 Emmeline decided that the running of a tea-shop in the French riviera could provide a home, an income, and also an answer to her failing health in the cold Canadian winters. Christabel accompanied her mother and Mabel Tuke, a former WSPU colleague, to France, but the venture was unsuccessful and she returned to England in the spring of 1926. When the unmarried Sylvia Pankhurst became pregnant the following year and gave birth to a son in December 1927, Christabel was among those who kept the news hidden from Emmeline, who discovered the truth only the following April when reading an article written by Sylvia in the <span class="italic">News of the World</span>. The old rivalries between the two sisters hardened as Christabel refused her sister's requests to see their ailing mother who was deeply distressed by the news. Both sisters, however, attended their mother's funeral, witnessed by huge crowds, on 17 June 1928, just a few weeks before women over the age of twenty-one were granted the vote on equal terms with men.<br>
<br>During the years immediately following Emmeline's death, Christabel thought about rewriting her mother's autobiography <span class="italic">My Own Story</span> but eventually decided against it. She did, however, have a contract to publish her own memoirs but, after the manuscript had been delivered to the publisher, decided it should be withdrawn since she did not want to engage in a family literary duel with Sylvia, whose book <span class="italic">The Suffragette Movement</span> appeared in 1931; neither did she want to provide for the enemies of Britain a picture of the brutal way the British government had treated WSPU campaigners. She did, however, launch a new adventist monthly journal, <span class="italic">Present and Future</span>, but it ran only from May to November 1934. Christabel then spent all her free time ministering to the sick and the dying. Recognition of her services to the enfranchisement of women was not forgotten, however, and in the 1936 new year honours list she was created DBE.<br>
<br>In 1939 Christabel returned to the USA where she continued her career as an author and lecturer on religion. She was followed there by her adopted daughter, Aurea Elizabeth Clifford, but the relationship between the two, always strained, ended well before Aurea's early death, at a date unknown. On 5 May 1953, Sylvia's birthday, Christabel renewed contact with her sister, writing her a warm letter and wishing her well after her recent heart attack. The correspondence between the two sisters continued intermittently until Christabel's death at her home, 943 Ocean Avenue, Santa Monica, California, on 13 February 1958 from a heart attack. She was buried at Woodlawn cemetery, Los Angeles, on 17 February. At a memorial service held in March at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Frederick Pethick-Lawrence spoke of how Christabel had changed the course of history by undertaking the formidable task of rousing women to a sense of their own worth and dignity in order to break down the walls of prejudice and opposition. The following year the manuscript of her memoirs, discovered by Grace Roe, was published as <span class="italic">Unshackled: the Story of how we Won the Vote</span>. On 13 July 1959 a bronze medallion of Christabel was added to a low circular wall at the base of her mother's statue in Victoria Tower Gardens. It was a fitting tribute to the close relationship between daughter and mother who jointly had fought courageously for women's right to the parliamentary vote.<br>
<br>Historiographical interpretations of Christabel Pankhurst's life have changed over time, from the &#145;great woman&#146; style, through David Mitchell's critical approach, to more sympathetic interpretations by those who see her emphasis on male power and the sisterhood of women as anticipating many of the separatist concerns of radical feminism in western Europe in the 1970s and 1980s.<br>
