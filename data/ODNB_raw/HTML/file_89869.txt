<span class="headword">Acheson,  Roy Malcolm</span>  (1921&#150;2003), <span class="occ">epidemiologist</span>, was born at 67 Eglantine Avenue, Belfast, on 18 August 1921, the elder son of Malcolm King Acheson (<i>d</i>. 1962), medical doctor, and his wife, Dorothy Josephine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rennoldson <i>d.</i> 1976. He was originally named Malcolm Roy, but later reversed his forenames. His brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/102463/', "(Ernest) Donald Acheson (1926&#150;2010)")</script>, later became chief medical officer of England and Wales. Acheson was educated at Merchiston Castle School, Edinburgh, then went on to Trinity College, Dublin, in 1938, with the intention of following his father into the medical profession. However, he discontinued his premedical studies there during the Second World War and spent five years from 1940 as a volunteer with the North Irish horse in north Africa. He took part in the battle of Longstop Hill in Tunisia and also served in Italy. He was commissioned in 1944 and left the army as a lieutenant. After returning to Trinity after the war, he completed his clinical studies at Brasenose College, Oxford, qualifying in 1951. In 1953, and while working under Alice Stewart, he devised the &#145;Oxford method&#146; for assessing maturation of bone growth. He proceeded to his doctorate of medicine in 1954. Meanwhile, on 16 March 1950, at St Vincent's Roman Catholic Church, in Altrincham, Cheshire, he married a 22-year-old fellow medical student, Fiona Marigo, daughter of Thomas Vincent O'Brien, medical practitioner. They had two sons, Malcolm and Vincent, and a daughter, Marigo.<br>
<br>In 1955 Acheson received simultaneously a Radcliffe travelling fellowship from the University of Oxford on the strength of a paper on tuberculous meningitis and a Rockefeller travelling fellowship, the beginning of a fifty-year association with the Rockefeller Institute. He spent a year in the United States at the Harvard school of public health and Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio. He then returned to Ireland as a lecturer in the department of social medicine at Trinity College, where he was awarded a fellowship in 1957 and received his doctorate of science in 1962. From 1959 to 1962 he was a senior lecturer and then reader in social and preventative medicine in a joint appointment between Guy's Hospital and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.<br>
<br>In 1962 Acheson was recruited to the faculty of the Yale medical school as an associate professor to establish a new division of chronic disease epidemiology. During ten resident years there (he was made a full professor in 1964) he developed an enviable programme of teaching and training with a particular research interest in the field of musculoskeletal diseases, particularly arthritis. He wrote papers on gout, osteoarthritis, and the prevention of hypertension, and latterly on medicine in society, medical education, and the organization of medical care. He was also actively involved in undergraduate activities as a fellow of Jonathan Edwards College from 1966 to 1975. As a result of his time and appointments in America he became a naturalized American citizen in 1967.<br>
<br>Nevertheless in 1972 Acheson returned to London, to establish the Centre for Extension Training in Community Medicine at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, of which he remained director for four years. This was an especially important development. Following reorganization of the National Health Service (NHS) and local government, the roles of public health personnel were transformed. In addition to traditional duties, new responsibilities for planning and integration of local NHS clinical services were imposed. This offered possibilities of local health improvements&#151;but risks too of weakening overall concern with community preventative and health-promoting services. The school organized personal training and retraining proficiencies in health services management and economics, as well as refresher courses in epidemiology, to ease the transition to the new order. Acheson became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1972, and was a fellow of the Faculty of Community Medicine and of the Faculty of Occupational Medicine. In 1974 he became professor of health service studies at London University. In 1976 he moved on again, to Cambridge, where he was the founding professor of community medicine in the developing clinical school there; he also became a fellow of Churchill College. He was made an emeritus professor on his retirement in 1988.<br>
<br>Over many years, Acheson participated in several of the Rockefeller Foundation's initiatives. Probably the most important was his organization of the week-long seminar at Cambridge in 1979 that launched the International Clinical Epidemiology Network (INCLEN). A group of distinguished British and foreign academics introduced young clinicians from medical schools in the developing world to the potential power of epidemiology for evaluating their health services and allocating their limited medical resources. INCLEN continued to flourish at the time of Acheson's death, having trained some 500 faculty members from about 50 institutions in 26 countries. Acheson also organized a broad-based seminar at the Rockefeller Foundation's Bellagio Study and Conference Center that resulted in an important volume on public health education, <span class="italic">A History of Education in Public Health</span> (1991). He was an early member of the International Epidemiological Association, another effort initiated by the Rockefeller Foundation, serving for many years as the association's secretary, organizing many of its meetings and seminars, and editing or co-editing many of its published volumes. He served as adviser and consultant to many organizations and government agencies, including the Pan-American Health Organization, the World Health Organization, and the US National Institutes of Health.<br>
<br>Acheson was a keen rugby player in his youth, and later took up golf, tennis, choral singing, and ornithology. He listed &#145;meditating in the bath&#146; among his recreations in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span>. With a &#145;mischievous twinkle in his eye and a ready smile&#146;, he &#145;loved a good joke and although a stickler for protocol he deplored pomposity. At times he seemed shy but could become angry in matters that moved him deeply&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Lancet</span>, 19 July 2003). In retirement he lived at 21 The Cliff, Roedean, Brighton. His marriage was dissolved in 1990. He died at Dane House nursing home, 52 Dyke Road Avenue, Brighton, on 2 April 2003, of cancer of the prostate, and was survived by his three children. He had accomplished much in many different ways and his influence on the teaching of epidemiology and public health, in particular, was profound. Nevertheless, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that in some of his many activities he might have achieved even more than he did, particularly if he had been able to devote more time to his research on musculoskeletal disorders&#151;an area barely attracting attention when he worked in it and ripe for substantial advances.<br>
