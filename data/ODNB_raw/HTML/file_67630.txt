<span class="headword">Coates,  Albert Henry</span>  (1882&#150;1953), <span class="occ">conductor and composer</span>, was born on 23 April 1882 at St Petersburg, Russia, the youngest of seven sons of Charles Thomas Coates, businessman, and his wife, also born near St Petersburg, daughter of James Gibson and Mary Randall.<br>
<br>Coates was educated in England. After attending the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, he read science at the Liverpool Institute and studied music informally with an elder brother. Later he returned to St Petersburg and joined his father's business. But music continued to attract him and he entered the Leipzig Conservatorium in 1902. There he studied the cello with Paul Klengel, the piano with Robert Teichm&uuml;ller, and conducting with Arthur Nikisch. Coming from an affluent, bourgeois background, Coates was able to exploit his period at the institution fully. Envied by other students for his possession of two pianos, he used his financial security to further his knowledge. By buying and studying newly published works in four-hand arrangements for piano, he was able to experience new and progressive works at first hand.<br>
<br>Impressed by Coates's potential as an executant, Nikisch offered him work at the Leipzig Opera. Having started as a volunteer r&eacute;p&eacute;titeur, Coates was promoted quickly, and in 1904 he made his conducting d&eacute;but with Offenbach's <span class="italic">The Tales of Hoffmann</span>. After a string of successful performances, Nikisch recommended Coates for the post of first conductor at the Elberfeld Stadttheater in 1905. But his tenure was short, and he moved to the prestigious Dresden Hofoper in 1907. Impulsive by nature, he soon came into conflict with his immediate superior, Ernst von Schuch, and decided to accept a post at Mannheim in 1909. Again his tenure was short and, after a performance of Wagner's <span class="italic">Siegfried</span> at St Petersburg, his appointment as principal conductor of the Russian Imperial Opera was announced in 1910. On 23 July that year he married Ella Lizzie Holland (<i>b</i>. 1881/2), daughter of Alfred Robert Holland.<br>
<br>Coates returned to Britain in 1919. Although his experience was gained mostly in the opera houses of continental Europe, he was familiar to London audiences: in 1910 he made his Queen's Hall d&eacute;but with the London Symphony Orchestra; in 1911 he performed for the Royal Philharmonic Society for the first time; and on 11 February 1914 he conducted Wagner's <span class="italic">Tristan und Isolde</span> at Covent Garden. But June 1919 was a watershed for the conductor: after returning successfully to Covent Garden, he was appointed principal conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra. Accepting the post at a time of financial uncertainty for the ensemble, Coates refused to accept a fee for their first six performances together. But the orchestra's fiscal problems did not inhibit his adventurous programming policy, and at his first concert on 27 October 1919 the inclusion of Skryabin's <span class="italic">Po&egrave;me de l'extase</span> affirmed his commitment to both that composer and Russian music in general. But Coates was also a champion of British music, and as principal conductor he gave the first reading of the revised version of Vaughan Williams's <span class="italic">London Symphony</span> (1920), the first complete performance of Holst's <span class="italic">The Planets</span> (1920), and the premi&egrave;re of Bax's symphony no. 1 (1922).<br>
<br>Successful in the theatre and the concert hall, Coates soon attracted the interest of the fast-growing gramophone industry. And it is unsurprising that the works he recorded first were by Russian composers. For Columbia he recorded Tchaikovsky's <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span> on 6 August 1919, part of Rimsky-Korsakov's <span class="italic">Scheherazade</span> on 13 December 1919, and Skryabin's <span class="italic">Po&egrave;me de l'extase</span> on 27 April and 7 May 1920. He continued to work for Columbia until 1935, and his recordings of Bach's mass in B minor, extensive excerpts from Wagner's stage works, and Stravinsky's <span class="italic">Petrouchka</span> and <span class="italic">Firebird</span> suite were important additions to that company's catalogue.<br>
<br>Coates made his American d&eacute;but in 1920, and three years later was appointed co-conductor of the Rochester Philharmonic. Sharing its 1923&#150;4 season with Eugene Goossens, Coates conducted the ensemble between 16 January and 19 April 1924. His performances were successful, and he returned in 1925. Later that year he performed at the Leeds festival, conducting the first English performance of his tone poem <span class="italic">The Eagle</span> and the premi&egrave;re of Holst's <span class="italic">Choral Symphony</span>. But his career had begun to lack focus, and from the mid-1920s it began to decline slowly. For much of the next twenty years he toured as a guest conductor, directing performances with, among others, the Berlin State Opera and the Vienna Philharmonic.<br>
<br>Unfulfilled as an executant, Coates returned to composition: on 21 December 1929 his fourth opera, <span class="italic">Samuel Pepys</span>, was performed at Munich, and on 20 November 1936 his fifth opera, <span class="italic">Pickwick</span>, was staged at Covent Garden. <span class="italic">Pickwick</span> was the climax of the British Music-Drama Opera Company's first season. But both the organization, formed by Coates and the producer Vladimir Rosing, and the opera were moribund: the work fell from the repertory and the company disbanded after one season. Even so, <span class="italic">Pickwick</span> was important historically: it was the first opera shown on British television. Uncertain of his future in Britain, Coates spent most of the Second World War in the USA. He appeared as a guest conductor with the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and was involved in the films <span class="italic">Song of Russia</span> (1944) and <span class="italic">Two Girls and a Sailor</span> (1944). After the hostilities he returned to London and recorded for Decca. But his relationship with the company was short, and his six recordings of Russian music failed to impress either critically or financially. By 1946 it was clear that Coates's career had reached its nadir. That year he announced that he was moving to South Africa, and after a period with the Johannesburg Symphony Orchestra he settled in Cape Town. There he directed the local orchestra, taught at the university, and supervised the performance of his seventh opera, <span class="italic">Van Hunks and the Devil: the Legend of Table Mountain</span>, in 1952.<br>
<br>Coates was a talented musician whose inability to hold a tenured post for long periods harmed his career. Although he was important to the fortunes of the London Symphony Orchestra immediately after the First World War, his contribution to British musical life was ephemeral. As a composer he has lost his place in the repertory, and as an executant he is remembered generally by collectors with an interest in historic recordings. His second wife was Vera Joanna Nettlefold; little else is known about his personal life. Coates died at Milnerton, near Cape Town, South Africa, on 11 December 1953.<br>
