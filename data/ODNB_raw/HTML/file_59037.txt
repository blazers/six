<span class="headword">Greenwood,  Alice Drayton</span>  (1862&#150;1935), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born on 18 November 1862 at 15 Lime Grove, Chorlton, Lancashire, the eldest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11439/', "Dr Joseph Gouge Greenwood (1821&#150;1894)")</script> and his first wife, Elizabeth (Eliza) Taylor, daughter of the Revd John Taylor, a well-known Unitarian minister. Her mother died after the birth of a second daughter, and her father remarried in 1871. The family lived thereafter in Fallowfield, Manchester, where Dr Greenwood was first tutor, then professor of classics and history, and finally principal at Owens College (1857&#150;89). From 1880 to 1886 he was vice-chancellor of Victoria University of Manchester. Brought up in an academic environment, Alice Greenwood was educated at Cheltenham Ladies' College (1875?&#150;82), and on returning home attended lectures and classes at Victoria University, taking advantage of the fact that, although women were not admitted to the building, the teaching was conducted in separate premises in Brunswick Street. The friendship and encouragement of teachers at the college, notably Adolphus William Ward, then professor of English language and history, and later master of Peterhouse, Cambridge, of Augustus Samuel Wilkins, professor of classics, and Dr Herman Hager, a specialist in German literature, gave direction to her interests, while her father can be credited with a general, rather than a particular, influence. She developed a fine taste in reading, exact standards of scholarly accuracy, a strong sense of public duty, and an unobtrusive but strong attachment to the Church of England.<br>
<br>Alice Greenwood entered Somerville Hall, Oxford, in 1886, and obtained a first-class honours degree in 1888 along with one other woman, Gertrude Bell of Lady Margaret Hall, and nine men, though the two women's names did not appear in the published list. She was remembered at Oxford for her vivacity and leadership in debate, and won a money prize for a historical essay offered by Mary (Mrs Humphry) Ward to the Association for Promoting the Education of Women in Oxford. In 1888 she was appointed assistant mistress at Clifton High School for Girls, Manchester, greatly enjoying the teaching but expressing even then a dislike for the idea of becoming a headmistress, wholly engaged in administration. When a colleague at the school was appointed headmistress of the North Manchester High School for Girls in 1892, she moved there with her. Meanwhile Adolphus Ward succeeded her father as principal of Owens College, and under his auspices the independent Withington Girls School was founded in 1891. Alice Greenwood became its second headmistress in 1896, when the first moved to a larger school. She was a vigorous and successful holder of the post until 1900, when she resigned. Her first book, <span class="italic">Europe and Papacy in the Middle Ages</span>, for schools, had been published in 1892 (2nd edn, 1896), and the steady flow after 1900 of deeply researched work on literature and history, some of which served, or responded to, requests from Adolphus Ward, probably explains her decision at thirty-eight years of age to leave teaching for writing.<br>
<br>Under Sir Adolphus Ward's editorship of the <span class="italic">Cambridge Modern History</span> (1901&#150;12) and co-editorship of the <span class="italic">Cambridge History of English Literature</span> (1907&#150;16) Alice Greenwood wrote three chapters in volume 2 of the latter on the later middle ages, showing fastidious care in the study of variant texts and sensitivity in appraising literary style, language, and early grammar. Both for the <span class="italic">Cambridge History of English Literature</span> and for the <span class="italic">Cambridge Modern History</span> she did innumerable grinding chores, compiling genealogies, chronological tables, and indexes. Her two most notable, independently written, books dealt with eighteenth-century England. One was a two-volume study, <span class="italic">Lives of the Hanoverian Queens of England</span> (1909, 1911), demonstrating her thorough reading of manifold documents. She resisted the temptation, when evidence about the women was thin, to write more freely about the men, but following the conventions of her age cultivated a certain reserve which is tantalizing to the modern reader; her style is in contrast with the &#145;brazen candour&#146; of her sources. But some constraints were self-imposed, inasmuch as she deemed biography different from history, and strove to see circumstances &#145;as they probably appeared to the actors themselves&#146;  (A. Greenwood, <span class="italic">Hanoverian Queens</span>, 1911, 2.x). Her study <span class="italic">Horace Walpole's World: a Sketch of Whig Society under George III</span> (1913) better displayed her skill in depicting an age in succinct, arresting phrases. Other works included school textbooks on English and European history, tales from Richard Hakluyt, and a selection from the Paston letters. She always matched her style to her readership: her school textbooks were written in a friendly, informal way, yet summarized in sharply discerning sentences the most significant long-term trends. Her original scholarly research investigated fresh sources and private letters with impressive thoroughness. Above all she was concerned to place people at the centre of the stage and to achieve a sense of actuality that made the past live before her readers' eyes. She probed character and personality in order to arrive at portraits that went beyond the mere public image. Her judgements were shrewd and often memorable, especially in her opening sentences. She cared nothing for fame, but wished to &#145;hand on the torch of honest study and true patriotism&#146;. A pupil described her as &#145;a splendid and powerful woman&#146;  (Wilson, 9).<br>
<br>Alice Greenwood moved to Oxford some time before 1910 and was associated with St Hugh's College, becoming a member of council (1910&#150;16) and honorary secretary (1914&#150;16). In 1916 she moved with a former colleague, Helen M. Turing, to Wandsworth Common, London, and then to Somerset, first to an old house and then to a new one in Williton, looking towards the Quantock hills. There she much enjoyed country walks, her large garden, and birds. She did not give up writing until 1934 and died at Shercroft, Catwell, Williton, on 27 April 1935. Her grave is in Wolvercote cemetery, Oxford, next to her sister who died in 1912.<br>
