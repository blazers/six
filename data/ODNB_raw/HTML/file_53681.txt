<span class="headword">Adams,  Mary Jane  Bridges-</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Mary Jane Daltry]</span>  (1854&#150;1939), <span class="occ">socialist and educationist</span>, was born on 19 October 1854 at Maesycwmer, Bedwas, Monmouthshire, south Wales, the daughter of William Daltry, an engine fitter, and his wife, Margaret Jones. She was born into a family of civil engineers, and her father later held an appointment at the Elswick works, Newcastle. Mary began life as a pupil teacher, but achieved success in the University of London matriculation examination, where she was placed in the first division in 1881; a year later, in June 1882, she passed the University of London's intermediate examination in arts. Mary attended classes in English language and literature, English history, French, Latin, and Greek, and passed through Bedford College with distinction in Greek and mathematics. Eventually she became headmistress in a board school, and afterwards a teacher in Birmingham and London.<br>
<br>On 22 October 1887 Mary married Walter Bridges Adams (<i>d</i>. 1902), a tutor, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/140/', "William Bridges Adams")</script>, civil engineer and radical, and his third wife, Ellen Rendall. Marriage reinforced existing personal and political networks. Mary moved in the same progressive political circles as Peter Kropotkin and William Morris; Walter's sister, Hope, married the Bavarian socialist Dr Lehmann.<br>
<br>In 1894 Mary Bridges-Adams unsuccessfully contested the Greenwich division of the London school board, supported by the Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society, sixty trade organizations, and the London Nonconformist Council. On that occasion her campaign was swamped by the interdenominational controversy over religious teaching in the board schools, and she came fifth in the poll to elect four members, receiving 16,638 votes. She was elected in 1897 and held the seat as the sole Labour member until the 1903 <span class="roman">London Education Act</span> abolished the board, transferring its responsibilities to the London county council (LCC). Her chief demands were for free, compulsory education, for a secular curriculum, and for equal educational opportunity. Adding a concern for free school meals and medical care she joined Lyulph Stanley and Stewart Headlam in supporting the development of the higher grade and evening continuation schools.<br>
<br>In November 1901 Mary Bridges-Adams initiated the foundation of the National Labour Education League, which sought to give effect to the views of trade unions to strengthen and develop the educational side of the labour movement. She was active in the campaign against the Conservative <span class="roman">Education Acts</span> of 1902&#150;3, arguing that working people should be ready not merely with a negative policy of opposition but a positive education programme based on the scheme outlined by John Richardson in his book <span class="italic">How It Can Be Done, or, Constructive Socialism</span> (1895). On 21 March 1903 the executive (including Ben Cooper, W. D. Steadman, and H. R. Taylor of the LCC) lobbied Lord Londonderry, president of the Board of Education, to save the school board for London, the league's last recorded political action.<br>
<br>Mary Bridges-Adams was one of the few early Labour figures to be involved with the Froebel movement, and she supported what is generally recognized as the first free kindergarten in England, which opened at Woolwich in 1900. A member of the Woolwich branch of the Women's Co-operative Guild throughout the 1890s and warden of a women's settlement in Greenwich in 1897, she campaigned locally for improved housing and sanitation for the working classes, as well as the provision of such cultural facilities as public concerts, a municipal picture gallery, and free library. She was an honorary member of an association of trade union officials to facilitate the exchange of information on the legal position of trade unions; its council of management included Mona Wilson and Margaret Bondfield.<br>
<br>Mary Bridges-Adams continued the fight for free school meals and in February 1905 organized a motor tour with Frances, countess of Warwick, John Clynes, Sir John Gorst, and Will Thorne to publicize the cause. As Lady Warwick's secretary and collaborator she ran a London-based office and discussion centre, visitors to which included Gorst, Thorne, and Winston Churchill. One of her lasting achievements was the establishment of the first Open Air School for Recovery in Bostall Woods, owned by the Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society. At her request in May 1907 the society offered its land to enable the London county council to investigate the therapeutic effects of open air and regular meals on debilitated children. The countess of Warwick was the main speaker at an inaugural meeting arranged by the co-operators, and the day school opened on 22 July 1907. It continued until 19 October 1907, during which time forty-nine boys and sixty-four girls benefited from the scheme. The experiment was judged a success and in June 1908 the school reopened on Shooter's Hill. Both sites predate the pioneering work of Margaret McMillan at the school clinic and open-air centre in Deptford.<br>
<br>In 1909 adult education became a key focus of Mary Bridges-Adams's work. She was a fierce critic of the Workers' Educational Association, supporting the Marxist tradition of the Plebs League and the Central Labour College from a commitment to self-governing working-class adult education. Early in 1912 she began a campaign to establish a working women's labour college, and a year later established a Working Women's Movement. She installed herself as resident principal of the first of these colleges, Bebel House, and continued to live at this address, 96 Lexham Gardens, Kensington, until her death.<br>
<br>In 1914 Mary Bridges-Adams's political activism gained an added dimension when she fought to preserve the right of asylum enjoyed by refugees from tsarist Russia, among them Georgy Chicherin, a future Soviet foreign minister. Her main allies in parliament were two Liberals: Joseph King and Lord Sheffield (formerly the Hon. Edward Lyulph Stanley), an old colleague from the London school board and close personal friend. Her obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, written from close personal knowledge, stated that this last crusade exhausted her. It also attested to her skills both as a public speaker and as &#145;an inveterate flutterer of dovecotes&#146;: in March 1917 Lord Derby, the secretary of state for war, speaking in the House of Lords, denounced her activities as dangerous.<br>
<br>Mary Bridges-Adams's feminist credentials are less clear. The obituary notice refers to her belief in universal adult suffrage and dismissal of Votes for Women as a small &#145;bourgeois&#146; affair. She did belong to the Women's Local Government Society, but the suggestion that she was a militant suffragette is based on unreliable evidence. Speaking from the hustings in 1894 she herself said she disapproved of young mothers being school-board teachers and believed home was the best place for them. Six years later she reiterated the point, though she did not support the operation of a marriage bar. She died at Princess Beatrice Hospital, London, on 14 January 1939, and was cremated at Golders Green crematorium four days later. She was survived by a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32068/', "William Bridges-Adams")</script>, the theatrical producer.<br>
