<span class="headword">Spratt,  Thomas Abel Brimage</span>  (1811&#150;1888), <span class="occ">naval officer and hydrographer</span>, eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26174/', "Commander James Spratt (1771&#150;1853)")</script> and his wife, Jane, daughter of Thomas Brimage, was born at East Teignmouth in Devon on 11 May 1811. He entered the navy in June 1827, and from 1832 served in surveying vessels in the Mediterranean, first the <i>Mastiff</i> and then the <i>Beacon</i>, under Lieutenant Thomas Graves, who had trained as a surveyor under Captain Philip Parker King. Spratt passed his examination in January 1835, but though specially recommended in October 1837 for gallantry in saving a marine who had fallen overboard, as well as for valuable work in the survey, he was not promoted lieutenant until 15 October 1841. Graves had just been promoted commander but remained in the <i>Beacon</i>, as also did Spratt until 1847, when he was appointed to command the <i>Volage</i> on the same service. On 5 March 1849 Spratt was promoted commander and succeeded Graves in command of the <i>Spitfire</i>, in which he continued surveying in the Mediterranean. On 27 February 1844 Spratt married Sophia Dear, only daughter of Edward Price: they had children and she survived him.<br>
<br>During the Crimean War the <i>Spitfire</i> was with the Black Sea Fleet, and Spratt's ability as a surveyor was frequently utilized in laying down positions for the ships, especially in the attack on Kerch and Kinburn, and his service was specially acknowledged by the commander-in-chief. On 3 January 1855 he was promoted captain, and on 5 July was nominated CB. He made a major contribution to the strategy of the Black Sea campaigns, especially in 1855, when he was given the wholehearted support of Admiral Lyons. His surveys opened up the Sea of Azov, which, once occupied, cut Russian logistics in the Crimea. After serving on the allied council of war at Paris in January 1856 he surveyed the approaches to the Suez Canal, a project then opposed by the British government.<br>
<br>After the peace Spratt commanded the <i>Medina</i>, still on the Mediterranean survey, where he remained until 1863. He had no further service afloat and retired in 1870; he became rear-admiral and admiral on the retired list. From 1866 to 1873 he was a commissioner of fisheries, and from 1879 until his death was chairman of the Mersey conservancy board. Spratt died at his residence, Clare Lodge, Tunbridge Wells, Kent, on 10 March 1888.<br>
<br>Spratt, elected FRS in 1856, was known not only as an accomplished surveyor and hydrographer but one who contributed to knowledge of the classical and geological history of the eastern Mediterranean coasts and islands. He published <span class="italic">Travels and Researches in Crete</span> (2 vols., 1865) and several other books, and numerous papers in scientific journals. He was also important as an oceanographer, conducting pioneering if ultimately unsuccessful work on currents which brought him into contact with the scientific community. His career demonstrated the low status of surveying work and the limits placed on naval careers, however brilliant, by lack of influence.<br>
