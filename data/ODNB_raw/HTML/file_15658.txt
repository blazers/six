<span class="headword">Kirkby,  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1658&#150;1703), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the fourth child and second son of Richard Kirkby (<i>c</i>.1625&#150;1681) of Kirkby, Lancashire, and his second wife, Isabel, daughter of Sir William Hudleston of Cumberland. He passed his naval lieutenant's examination on 28 March 1689 and was appointed second lieutenant of the <i>Advice</i>. On 12 February 1690 he was appointed captain of the <i>Success</i> hired ship, a commission he owed to Arthur Herbert and to his cousin Sir John Lowther, one of the Admiralty commissioners. His ship was part of the fleet sent to capture St Kitts, but he was not employed as a captain for the fourteen months after the <i>Success</i> returned to England in April 1692. In 1694 he was appointed to the <i>Southampton</i> and served under Edward Russell in the Mediterranean. In a fight with two French vessels on 18&#150;19 January 1695 it was noticed that he &#145;kept as far off&#146; the heavily armed <i>Content</i> &#145;as his guns could reach reasonably firing now and then 2 or 3 guns at him&#146;  (TNA: PRO, ADM 51/3935/1), and he was excluded from a share in the prize money. Apparently the <i>Southampton</i> was not a well-disciplined ship; its chaplain, Ellis Cooper, left after some unpleasantness with Kirkby, the boatswain was broken and flogged for disobedience and insolence, and a seaman was sentenced to be flogged and &#145;towed ashore&#146; for &#145;scandalous actions&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1696 the <i>Southampton</i> was sent to the West Indies and was one of the ships which burned Petit Guave on 28 June 1697. On its return in 1698 Kirkby was tried by court martial on charges of embezzlement and cruelty, accused of punishing a seaman for straggling by ordering him to be &#145;tied up by the right arm and left leg for several hours&#146;  (TNA: PRO, ADM 1/5260). Though cleared, he spent the next two years unemployed and on half-pay. He blamed &#145;the great power and interest of my Lord of Orford&#146; (Edward Russell) for his being overlooked  (TNA: PRO, ADM 1/2004).<br>
<br>In February 1701 Kirkby was appointed to the <i>Ruby</i>, probably due to Lowther, and was sent to the West Indies. By March he had moved to the <i>Defiance</i>, and was &#145;eldest officer under the flag&#146; from the death of Rear-Admiral Henry Martin until the arrival of Rear-Admiral William Whetstone in May 1702. Second in command of the squadron under Vice-Admiral John Benbow which met a French squadron off St Mary on 19 August, he, like most of the captains, ignored Benbow's signals to close the enemy and engage. After a five-day running skirmish the English were beaten off and Benbow mortally wounded. On return to Jamaica Kirkby and his fellow mutineers were tried by court martial. Evidence against him came from over two dozen officers, and it was reported that he had not encouraged his men to fight but dodged behind the mizzenmast &#145;falling down on the deck at the sound of a shot&#146;. Though heard, he was condemned to be shot for cowardice and disobedience. In a long letter to the Admiralty secretary Josiah Burchett he alleged that Benbow's injudicious and ignorant conduct was the cause of the defeat, that his evidence was falsified, that members of his crew who wanted to defend him were browbeaten by the dying Benbow, and that the court was adjourned when he sought to present evidence. Captain Edward Acton carried him to England, where sentence was to be carried out, arriving in Plymouth on 15 April the day before the executions were to take place. In the evening Kirkby was &#145;very calm and easy, not railing or reviling, but forgiving all the world and praying, for the Queen's health and prosperity&#146;, a stance retained the following day also  (TNA: PRO, ADM 1/1436). He wrote an account of his actions which he hoped would be published, and drew up his will, leaving everything to his sister Elizabeth. During the day &#145;land and sea officers with others&#146; came on board the <i>Bristol</i> to see the execution, as did two parsons &#145;to pray and give the sacrament&#146; to Kirkby and Captain Cooper Wade  (ibid.). At 6 p.m. Kirkby, &#145;kneeling on the larboard side of the forecastle&#146; facing the six musketeers appointed to shoot him, was executed, having lifted his hand as &#145;a signal to be shot&#146;. After the execution Kirkby's body was placed in his coffin, &#145;being by him&#146;, which was carried on shore and buried under the communion table in Plymouth church  (TNA: PRO, ADM 52/7/8). Kirkby seems to have been a bully, resentful that his merits had not got him a flag rank, and a coward, a trait which led to his undoing and death.<br>
