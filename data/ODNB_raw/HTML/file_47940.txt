<span class="headword">Goodenough, Sir  Francis William</span>  (1872&#150;1940), <span class="occ">sales executive and educationist</span>, son of Henry Goodenough, currier, and his wife, Louisa Hatchwell, was born in East Street, Newton Abbot, Devon, on 9 September 1872, and was educated at Torquay Public College. At the age of sixteen he joined the Gas Light and Coke Company as an office boy. Although it was at that time the largest gas company in Britain, Gas Light and Coke had no sales organization to face the incipient challenge from electricity; only in 1903 was a department separate from engineering established for selling and customer service. Goodenough's talents for marketing were quickly recognized, and in 1902 he was sent to Berlin to report on gas street lighting. In the following year he was appointed the company's first controller of gas sales, a position he retained until his retirement in 1931. As early as 1907 he was publicly arguing that gas utility managers should regard sales promotion as part of their normal duties.<br>
<br>One of Goodenough's responsibilities was the placing of advertisements. At that time the industry was highly fragmented with no central body to encourage co-operation: in 1912 there were over 800 independent authorized gas companies, more than a third of which were municipally owned. In consequence, many of the advertisements placed by the Gas Light and Coke Company were seen by customers of other gas companies, whose policies and terms of trade were different, and much of their impact was therefore wasted, as far as the Gas Light and Coke Company was concerned. In discussion with the head of his advertising agency Goodenough conceived the idea of an industry-wide body to promote co-operative advertising. Under his leadership, the British Commercial Gas Association was set up in 1911. Some gas companies resented the leading role played by Gas Light and Coke in the affairs of the association, and others&#151;especially municipal undertakings&#151;saw no need for co-operative advertising. Gradually, however, Goodenough won over virtually the whole industry. The success of the advertising association opened the way for the creation by Sir David Milne-Watson in 1919 of the National Gas Council, a forum to improve co-operation within the industry and to allow it to speak with a common voice.<br>
<br>Goodenough's preference was for scrupulous factual advertising. There was some feeling in the gas industry during the 1930s that the association's promotional efforts were being outclassed by the aggressive advertising of electrical goods, but the pattern he established was maintained. Goodenough was elected a member of the Incorporated Sales Managers' Association in 1921, its chairman in 1926 (when he was also made a CBE) and its president from 1929 to 1934. For three years he was also president of the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers.<br>
<br>In the early 1920s Goodenough turned his attention to educational schemes for technical and commercial staff, in conjunction with the Institution of Gas Engineers and the Board of Education. In his view the development of scientific skills in management and selling, especially in export markets, was perhaps even more important for the future of the nation than developing manufacturing capability. Such views led to his acting as chairman of a government committee on education for salesmanship between 1928 and 1931. This provided him with a platform to promote his views; he addressed among others the British Association for the Advancement of Science and the Headmasters' Conference. Goodenough was a council member of the Federation of British Industry, and received a knighthood in 1930. He retired from the Gas Light and Coke Company in 1931, but remained chairman of the British Commercial Gas Association until 1936.<br>
<br>In 1900 Goodenough married Ellen, daughter of William Rees of Dolgellau and Chelsea; they had no children. An enthusiast for fly-fishing and golf in his spare time, he also worked for social and charitable organizations, notably as chairman of the Princess Beatrice Hospital. He never entirely lost his Devon accent. The last few years of his life were dogged by poor health, and he died at his home, 39 Holland Street, London, on 11 January 1940. He was survived by his wife, and left estate valued at &pound;4409 15<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>.<br>
