<span class="headword">Goudy,  Henry</span>  (1848&#150;1921), <span class="occ">jurist</span>, was born on 16 September 1848 at Strabane, co. Tyrone, the eldest son of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11129/', "Revd Alexander Porter Goudy DD (1809&#150;1858)")</script>, an Irish Presbyterian clergyman, and Isabella Kinross (1824&#150;1906), daughter of an Ayr merchant. After his father's death his mother returned to Ayr. Between 1864 and 1867 Goudy studied at the University of Glasgow. He matriculated as a law student in Edinburgh in 1868, and graduated MA in 1870 and LLB in 1871. Goudy then spent a year studying law at the University of K&ouml;nigsberg, before his admission as an advocate on 22 November 1872.<br>
<br>The Scots bar was currently confident and buoyant, devoted to energetic intellectual endeavour, stimulated by the revival of legal education in the universities after 1860 and by contacts with German legal science. Shortly after his admission, Goudy demonstrated a talent for scholarship by writing an article for the <span class="italic">Journal of Jurisprudence</span> on the controversial topic of the liability of railway companies, focusing on a new German statute. With William C. Smith he published <span class="italic">Local Government</span> in 1880, a memorandum intended to facilitate discussion of reform. This was followed in 1886 by Goudy's <span class="italic">Law of Bankruptcy</span>. A vitally important work, which reached a fourth edition in 1914, it was for long the authoritative text in Scots law in this field, and was not entirely superseded in some respects even at the end of the century. Goudy was the first editor of the <span class="italic">Juridical Review</span>, to which he contributed throughout his life.<br>
<br>A Liberal, Goudy held a minor public office in Gladstone's governments in the 1880s. He was a candidate for the chair of Scots law in the University of Edinburgh in 1888, when the Conservative John Rankine was appointed. In 1889 he succeeded his own teacher, James Muirhead, as professor of civil law at Edinburgh. The main duty of the holder of this chair was to teach Roman law. If Goudy's publications had hitherto indicated an interest in Scots law, his training in Edinburgh and K&ouml;nigsberg had prepared him for this office. Possessed of a &#145;striking face and tall, commanding figure&#146;, Goudy was, according to James F. Whyte, &#145;a born teacher&#146; who &#145;never missed an opportunity of helping his students&#146;  (Whyte, 163). He published a number of articles on Roman law in the <span class="italic">Juridical Review</span>, and in 1899 he produced a second edition of Muirhead's <span class="italic">Historical Introduction to the Law of Rome</span>, the plagiarism of which by Hannis Taylor he exposed in a notable article in the <span class="italic">Juridical Review</span> in 1908.<br>
<br>In 1893 Goudy was called to the regius chair of civil law in the University of Oxford, in succession to his fellow Ulsterman James Bryce, who had advised Gladstone on the appointment. Here he helped to develop the embryonic law school. His inaugural lecture, &#145;Fate of Roman law north and south of the Tweed&#146;, published as a pamphlet in 1894, was a slight piece. In 1910 he published the interesting, if scarcely profound, <span class="italic">Trichotomy in Roman Law</span>, a German translation of which appeared in 1914, by E. Ehrlich. Goudy himself translated as <span class="italic">Law in Daily Life</span> (1904) a work of R. von Jhering, which set out a series of examination questions on legal issues arising out of everyday experience. If Goudy stressed the importance of historical knowledge in understanding the law, he had a strong interest in law reform; he argued in favour of codification to the Edinburgh Merchant Company in 1893 and was still addressing the Society of Public Teachers of Law on its benefits in 1919. In 1908 he had been one of the founders and first president of the society (and served again in 1918&#150;19). Goudy also had a strong interest in international law and in 1915 was one of the founders and first vice-president of the Grotius Society.<br>
<br>Goudy was awarded the degrees of DCL from Oxford in 1894 and LLD from Edinburgh; in 1917 he was elected as an honorary bencher of Gray's Inn. Though troubled by ill health all his life, he did not retire from the regius chair until 1917. All Souls then continued him in his fellowship, and the university appointed him professor emeritus. He had long had a house in West Malvern. On 3 March 1921 he died, unmarried, at 7 Lansdown Crescent, Bath, and was buried in Bath.<br>
